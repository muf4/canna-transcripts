[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  1003
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.440]  All right, boys and girls. We are live. Welcome everyone. Take it away Brian
[00:07.040 --> 00:13.240]  Yeah, good morning living soil nerds last week was pretty epic for us. We were able to talk hash with a
[00:14.400 --> 00:18.160]  living legend somebody that was learning from legends and stuff like that and we had a lot of
[00:19.160 --> 00:23.960]  fantastic stories and memories that we were sharing and then unfortunately we found out that
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.540]  Most of the stories that we were sharing last Thursday were shared with a gentleman named Frenchy canoli
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.640]  And unfortunate for the community. He passed away on Sunday. And so I was hoping that we could just kind of start the show again
[00:36.640 --> 00:37.560]  I know
[00:37.560 --> 00:41.840]  Everybody here on the on the show today. It was a huge fan of him his work
[00:42.120 --> 00:49.220]  The way that he educated him as a human being there was definitely a light to him if you were ever able to smoke with him
[00:49.880 --> 00:55.160]  He's definitely one of those people that you would remember. I feel like whether you knew he was Frenchy canoli or not
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.560]  One quick story I had was I was able to smoke with him one time and we were walking down the streets and Palm Springs
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.620]  And there was a guy that was talking about how he'd never smoked hash before
[01:07.000 --> 01:09.560]  So the first time that that gentleman ever got to smoke hash
[01:09.560 --> 01:15.080]  He was smoking Frenchy canoli stuff having no idea who that gentleman was and just enjoying the evening
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.320]  So I thought that was really cool to watch Frenchy
[01:17.320 --> 01:21.880]  Just kind of always be giving always trying to open up people and I want to you know
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.880]  Obviously we brought Jim on because we want to talk about stuff. Unfortunately this happened, but I know that Jim's a huge fan of
[01:28.920 --> 01:30.760]  Frenchy canoli's work as well as Layton
[01:30.760 --> 01:34.620]  So I want to kind of open the show with that guys where you can kind of talk about that for a little bit
[01:34.620 --> 01:37.200]  And then Jim, of course, we want to get into your work as well
[01:37.440 --> 01:43.200]  it's just really unfortunate that we lost a living legend for our community for sure and I feel like
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.060]  All of the information and all the stuff that he's put out is something that is great about digital media because that will live on
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.360]  Hopefully forever
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.040]  Amen my friend amen, it was it was definitely a sad day in my life when I got home Monday night
[02:00.320 --> 02:01.960]  Pauline said
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.320]  Something's going on. What's going on with Frenchy? And I was like, I have no idea. What are you talking about?
[02:07.840 --> 02:12.880]  It was just devastating to lose such a you know huge pillar of the community
[02:13.540 --> 02:17.880]  You know the work that he did and the people he taught on so many levels
[02:18.600 --> 02:24.200]  You know, I I was blessed to have met him many times and hung out with him a number of times at the
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  Regen conference and at the Dempure hive event
[02:28.840 --> 02:34.080]  And I will I will sorely miss him. My my probably favorite time was a
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.900]  Roadtrip that we did from the regen conference Sunday night. He came up to me looking for a ride
[02:40.900 --> 02:46.400]  I guess the person that was going to give him a ride back to San Francisco bailed on him and I said sure no problem
[02:46.400 --> 02:48.080]  I'll be more than happy to give you a ride down
[02:48.080 --> 02:52.960]  so we got three hours just to hang out and talk about family and kids and our loves and
[02:53.520 --> 02:55.520]  You know, he was just sweet
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.360]  Soulful guy and at the end of the trip, he handed me a big chunk of one of his temple balls
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.280]  And I was like, wow. All right. Thank you. You know, that was kind of you, but you don't have to do that
[03:05.280 --> 03:07.280]  He's like, you know, I I want to do it
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.200]  and of course, you know, I got blessed to smoke at one of his
[03:11.840 --> 03:15.760]  funny cigarettes for lack of better words on the way down and that
[03:16.440 --> 03:18.440]  What an incredible pleasure it was
[03:19.760 --> 03:23.480]  Share both his smoke with him and and that time together
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.640]  ironically, I got back east and I
[03:27.160 --> 03:29.160]  Gave a chunk of it to my son
[03:29.480 --> 03:33.920]  And I told him, you know, it just was gifted to me by a gentleman named Frenchie cannoli
[03:33.920 --> 03:40.460]  I think he was at college up in in New Hampshire at the time and and he told some of his friends about it
[03:40.460 --> 03:43.520]  And he became like an instant his hit
[03:44.080 --> 03:50.480]  Hanging out with senior smoking Frenchies temple ball at college and so that was you know, that was a wonderful memory
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.880]  And I'm sure my son
[03:52.880 --> 03:58.960]  Be hurt to find out that yeah, he's no longer with us. And so rest in peace my friend. God rest in peace
[04:00.440 --> 04:06.920]  And I did speak to Kimberly and she's gonna she's gonna come on sometime in the next few weeks to
[04:07.240 --> 04:10.340]  Put on a tribute to him and all his work
[04:11.100 --> 04:15.940]  The love that he shared with so many people so we'll keep you posted on that is when it happens
[04:17.820 --> 04:21.020]  Well, no no on a light note, you know, I really didn't know him very well
[04:22.700 --> 04:26.140]  But I did get to meet him at the Emerald Cup and
[04:27.340 --> 04:30.300]  We had smoked some temple ball. It's still
[04:31.420 --> 04:35.020]  To date the highest I've ever been I think as an adult
[04:35.900 --> 04:42.500]  I had to like sit in my chair and talk myself down for about 30 minutes before I could even get up. So
[04:43.660 --> 04:49.300]  So Brian that guy that you mentioned who had never smoked ash. I am curious if you ever made it home that night, but
[04:50.540 --> 04:56.820]  He was definitely a little awestruck. I feel like afterwards there was you know, there's a bunch of people in that group
[04:56.820 --> 04:59.380]  I don't know if I want me to name their names or anything
[04:59.380 --> 05:03.260]  But there's definitely a bunch of quote-unquote famous people in the cannabis industry
[05:03.260 --> 05:06.780]  and what was cool is the guy had no idea who they were is just a
[05:07.100 --> 05:12.780]  Genuine good heart of individual and I feel like for whatever reason when we were walking down the streets of Palm Springs
[05:13.300 --> 05:19.660]  He crossed they cross and Frenchie saw him and a cool little moment happened there where we all just kind of enjoying hash and
[05:20.780 --> 05:27.740]  You know in the streets of Palm Street Palm Springs and just being able to to really see how genuine and gifting he was
[05:27.740 --> 05:30.180]  You know, he shared a psilocybin with us. We were able to
[05:30.740 --> 05:34.220]  You know, he was kind of joking he's like, all right, we all did our little speeches now
[05:34.220 --> 05:37.660]  Let's go have some fun and they weren't really at the hotel that we were at
[05:37.660 --> 05:39.740]  They weren't really allowing the group to enjoy ourselves
[05:39.740 --> 05:42.060]  So they all kind of pushed us to this one area
[05:42.380 --> 05:47.760]  by the pool and I felt like it was the greatest thing that could have happened for the that group that night is because we
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.460]  All just kind of bonded in this one little small area
[05:50.460 --> 05:54.780]  Nobody could really mingle too far away and it just kind of created this cool little vibe
[05:54.780 --> 05:59.720]  So that's something that I will always personally remember just enjoying that evening and watching
[06:00.500 --> 06:04.140]  living legends that were there interact with one another and there was
[06:04.980 --> 06:10.880]  Just respect there was a huge respect for everybody that was there and that was something that I like to see as well
[06:13.340 --> 06:15.140]  So no, I know that
[06:15.140 --> 06:21.700]  You ran upstairs for us and I was hoping maybe we could kind of kick this off with you and transfer into some some good
[06:21.700 --> 06:28.100]  Stuff but maybe you smoke in a temple ball and can you kind of explain that for the audience last week?
[06:28.900 --> 06:32.500]  Brett bird was able to explain a lot of that for the for you guys
[06:32.500 --> 06:37.240]  So if you haven't checked that out, I think it was at the hour 35 13 mark that I remember
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.620]  Check that out so that you guys can make that for yourselves another that's another huge gold bar that bird gave last week
[06:43.620 --> 06:48.820]  And you know if you learn to do that for yourself, that's a that's a huge advantage just to enjoy
[06:49.500 --> 06:51.140]  medicine on another level
[06:51.140 --> 06:55.060]  So Jim if you want to kind of explain that on your own terms as well
[06:55.900 --> 06:57.900]  totally, yeah, so
[06:58.100 --> 07:00.520]  You know, I I had found out about Frenchie
[07:02.580 --> 07:06.180]  Not I'm not sure how far into things I was but
[07:06.860 --> 07:11.820]  You know, I was really into the whole hash thing. I was never really into
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.020]  extracts
[07:14.020 --> 07:19.340]  Involving, you know chemicals and I'm just kind of in kind of a organic hippie that way
[07:20.060 --> 07:22.060]  little granola II so
[07:22.300 --> 07:26.020]  You know, I just never got into that stuff, but I really enjoyed dry sift
[07:26.660 --> 07:33.020]  And then I started seeing you know what Frenchie was doing with temple balls and
[07:34.820 --> 07:41.620]  You know, it just kind of seemed like taking dry sift to the next level and and really a way to
[07:42.700 --> 07:44.260]  have that
[07:44.260 --> 07:46.260]  that hash experience that
[07:46.460 --> 07:50.700]  You know all the hippies were having I mean you guys can probably tell I'm a little on the younger side
[07:50.780 --> 07:54.780]  And you know some of the older heads got to smoke all that like Moroccan
[07:55.300 --> 07:57.820]  Lebanese Afghan Pakistani hash
[07:59.060 --> 08:05.540]  And I was always really envious of that, you know, I'd read Robert Clark's book as sheesh and was just fascinated
[08:06.500 --> 08:08.500]  By by really that whole book
[08:09.100 --> 08:11.100]  And then, you know being here
[08:11.900 --> 08:18.580]  Stateside and growing up in the Midwest, you know, that stuff was so exotic. I I don't think I ever came across it
[08:19.340 --> 08:22.980]  So when I started cultivating and I found out about Frenchie, you know
[08:22.980 --> 08:26.700]  That was just it hit me like I need to try this. I need to do this
[08:27.540 --> 08:31.260]  and then of course, you know anyone who smoked a temple ball a
[08:31.860 --> 08:34.500]  Well-made one from well-grown flowers will know
[08:35.380 --> 08:38.180]  It's it's an incredible experience that you really can't
[08:39.180 --> 08:47.060]  You know have with just flour or with a chemical based extract. It's it's just a very unique experience. So
[08:47.740 --> 08:50.460]  So I really got raptured by that
[08:51.180 --> 08:52.740]  And
[08:52.740 --> 08:56.860]  I try to save my temple balls as long as I can, you know Frenchie
[08:57.740 --> 09:01.260]  made made the argument and had all the research about the
[09:02.020 --> 09:07.260]  secondary terpenes and cannabinoids that are produced during the temple making process
[09:08.300 --> 09:13.060]  And are not present in actual fresh flower or fresh resin
[09:13.820 --> 09:16.060]  So I've been hanging on to this temple ball
[09:16.620 --> 09:19.460]  This is from my 2019 outdoor season
[09:20.500 --> 09:22.500]  I'll get it unwrapped here
[09:22.580 --> 09:28.540]  We'll kind of try to get it on the camera. So I keep it in this cellophane and keep that in the fridge and
[09:29.180 --> 09:30.540]  I
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.660]  Had actually been saving this temple ball
[09:33.380 --> 09:38.300]  To get to experience with Frenchie someday. So now that he's passed
[09:38.940 --> 09:44.480]  I'm not really saving it for anything, but would love to have a little puff here on the show. So
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.340]  This is it. It's very cold. I just took it from my fridge
[09:49.100 --> 09:54.780]  So I can handle it but as soon as it starts to warm up it's gonna be too sticky to mess around with
[09:55.700 --> 09:58.220]  So let me get that in a bowl here
[09:59.460 --> 10:03.220]  I'm putting this on some Wi-Fi ghost flower
[10:05.060 --> 10:08.900]  Not too strong and hopefully will keep me articulate here on the show
[10:15.940 --> 10:22.700]  Now there's something that I want to point out to our viewers, you know your name on Instagram is higher thought guru you have a
[10:23.300 --> 10:29.700]  Blog where you basically review really high-end unique cannabis cultivars
[10:30.540 --> 10:32.300]  It's higher thought guru
[10:32.300 --> 10:36.260]  And I wanted to shout that out early because I really want you guys to start to see
[10:36.540 --> 10:39.860]  Just because somebody might not have the the platform and I hope you take this
[10:40.020 --> 10:43.100]  With love man, because I want to give you that platform today
[10:43.100 --> 10:48.660]  I really do feel like a lot of people could learn from you know, what what you are doing man. I mean
[10:49.660 --> 10:56.940]  You're taking cannabis to at least for when you're explaining things I feel like it's just the next level you're able to work with
[10:57.460 --> 11:03.980]  Freeborn selections. It seems like most of the gear that you work with is working with for you guys that don't know that's mean gene
[11:04.380 --> 11:09.220]  So you you're just on another level man. I feel like you understand things you live up to your name
[11:09.220 --> 11:13.380]  I think I mentioned that last week, you know the higher thought guru. I do do really feel like
[11:13.900 --> 11:18.420]  I don't mind saying that about you. I think when we first met right before kovat
[11:18.660 --> 11:23.100]  There's just something about the way that you talk about cannabis the way that you understand the plant
[11:23.380 --> 11:25.340]  And that's why I wanted to give you this platform
[11:25.340 --> 11:30.220]  But he is we're excited to learn more about how you think about cannabis and I hope a lot more people see
[11:30.500 --> 11:33.620]  the quality of cannabis that you're consuming as well as
[11:34.300 --> 11:40.880]  Critiquing man, that's those are incredibly generous words. That's very very kind of you to say
[11:41.860 --> 11:46.980]  You know the name higher thought guru. I definitely don't think of myself as a guru. So
[11:47.620 --> 11:50.860]  Anyone watching who's like man, this guy is just a total tool
[11:51.660 --> 11:56.260]  It you know, it almost started as an ironic thing. I thought it was kind of funny. So
[11:56.820 --> 11:59.260]  it's very nice of you to say that though Brian and
[12:00.140 --> 12:02.140]  you know, I started the blog because
[12:03.580 --> 12:08.620]  You know for the guys who are really into seeds and some of these more obscure
[12:09.700 --> 12:12.540]  Strains, you know, especially from Bodhi from freeborn
[12:13.580 --> 12:16.140]  Mean gene, you know that these guys
[12:17.340 --> 12:19.340]  They're doing so much breeding
[12:20.020 --> 12:22.020]  with such unique stuff
[12:22.860 --> 12:25.460]  it's really hard to find out about this stuff and
[12:26.660 --> 12:29.140]  So, you know what? I mean, I'm such a nerd about this
[12:29.140 --> 12:33.140]  I'd be looking on the internet trying to find out about these strains before I drew them and
[12:35.260 --> 12:39.740]  It it was always so frustrating to get any kind of meaningful information, you know
[12:39.740 --> 12:44.740]  you'd get a smoke report from someone and it's like the weed was really dank and
[12:45.140 --> 12:49.540]  You know, it got me super stoned and I spent the whole night on the couch and you're like
[12:50.660 --> 12:59.180]  That doesn't tell me anything about that strain about the real experience like, you know, it's just such a vague generic
[13:00.740 --> 13:03.220]  Really non descript description
[13:03.660 --> 13:05.660]  so the blog
[13:05.980 --> 13:13.020]  I really made you know in an attempt to kind of fill that hole of like I knew I was growing unique stuff
[13:13.020 --> 13:15.260]  I knew other people wanted to know about it
[13:16.140 --> 13:19.940]  And I knew that I would want to be able to refer back
[13:20.620 --> 13:27.820]  Years later, you know, you you certainly can remember a strain differently than it actually was and it's helpful
[13:28.380 --> 13:30.380]  To put it in writing at the time
[13:31.940 --> 13:37.220]  So then, you know, even if your memories get messed up you can go consult your blog or journal or whatever
[13:37.220 --> 13:39.340]  So so those kind of the birth of the blog
[13:40.220 --> 13:46.700]  You know just wanting to make get that information out there because I had been so frustrated trying to get
[13:47.860 --> 13:49.860]  information like that so
[13:50.300 --> 13:56.460]  So that was kind of how it was born. I've been you know doing this type of blogging since I was 17 years old
[13:57.980 --> 13:59.220]  So
[13:59.220 --> 14:01.460]  You know, I I do really love the plant
[14:02.100 --> 14:03.540]  it's
[14:03.540 --> 14:09.260]  You know, I mean I've had my ups and downs with the plant with with consuming the plant with
[14:09.900 --> 14:11.900]  every aspect of it
[14:12.100 --> 14:15.260]  But I think at this point in my life, it's probably safe to say that
[14:15.900 --> 14:20.820]  I will you know have a relationship with this plant in some way for the rest of my life and
[14:22.780 --> 14:24.780]  You know, I just
[14:25.140 --> 14:31.940]  Really really love it and the blog is a great way for me to kind of express my love and passion
[14:32.940 --> 14:36.980]  For the plant in in a lot of different ways, you know the growing of it the
[14:38.020 --> 14:40.020]  experience of consuming it and
[14:40.580 --> 14:47.460]  and you know, I I guess I do feel like I really don't like the culture of
[14:47.940 --> 14:55.460]  you know getting as stoned as possible and just kind of being a vegetable and I really appreciate the nuances
[14:55.980 --> 15:00.220]  that cannabis has to offer in terms of effect certainly aroma, but
[15:00.700 --> 15:05.540]  I just think it's incredible that you know, you can smoke a bowl of one flower
[15:06.180 --> 15:12.100]  Reliably get a certain feeling and then you smoke a different flower and get a totally different feeling
[15:12.980 --> 15:14.980]  So, you know when I was 17
[15:16.220 --> 15:23.580]  And kind of became aware of that that facet of cannabis that that it was so diverse in its effects and its aromas
[15:23.580 --> 15:25.420]  And that you could almost
[15:25.420 --> 15:27.420]  Not almost that you could customize
[15:28.420 --> 15:33.540]  Your own experience, I mean that was kind of game over for me I was so fascinated by that and
[15:34.340 --> 15:36.340]  really compelled to kind of create
[15:37.300 --> 15:40.680]  What I thought was the ideal experience for me
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.060]  so so it's been a
[15:45.340 --> 15:48.940]  Endeavor now that's you know, 10 10 plus years old and
[15:50.620 --> 15:52.620]  That's what got me into it so
[15:53.260 --> 15:57.140]  So and I've got got my bowl packed here
[15:57.620 --> 16:01.900]  It's an Amani summer day glass piece with a little temple ball on top. So
[16:03.100 --> 16:04.940]  so if my
[16:04.940 --> 16:09.060]  Conversation what I have to offer starts going downhill. You'll know exactly why
[16:10.460 --> 16:12.460]  It's all good brother. We'll cover you
[16:13.860 --> 16:19.820]  Perfect perfect. Yeah, I think my first experience with hash was god. I must have been
[16:20.620 --> 16:26.380]  16 years old and this guy had a green nugget of hash in a little container and
[16:27.420 --> 16:29.420]  We smoked it up, but it took me down
[16:29.980 --> 16:32.580]  It was not like the regular flower that I was smoking
[16:32.580 --> 16:37.220]  And so yeah, and then I then I got some blonde hash and some red hash
[16:37.980 --> 16:42.020]  we used to do hash under a glass on it with a with a pin head and
[16:42.820 --> 16:49.180]  So those are my first experiences and yeah, I was blessed because of my age to have been able to you know experience those
[16:49.700 --> 16:52.900]  Those hashes that were coming from overseas
[16:53.380 --> 16:56.060]  So those were import hashes, yeah, yeah
[16:56.060 --> 17:03.700]  Yeah, that tie stick and God the tie stick was amazing that I smoked out in San Diego when I was 18
[17:04.220 --> 17:08.340]  But those were probably the best some of the best treats that I got
[17:09.020 --> 17:14.340]  When I was younger and then of course then we got into the cauliflower and boy that that was it man
[17:14.340 --> 17:16.340]  I was changed forever on that
[17:16.780 --> 17:19.780]  But yeah, I have some fond memories of the old strains
[17:20.660 --> 17:22.820]  Being gold and Panama red
[17:24.220 --> 17:25.620]  Stuff you just can't get anymore
[17:25.620 --> 17:31.980]  Although I think mountain organics has still has some Colombian gold that I'd love to get a couple nuggets of at some point
[17:31.980 --> 17:36.540]  But I'll hit up Ian at some point in the near future when I've got some time to run around
[17:37.500 --> 17:39.500]  What was the most memorable?
[17:40.100 --> 17:43.820]  Import hash that you you had tried it was this red
[17:43.820 --> 17:48.460]  I think it was a Moroccan red boy that stuff would light you up like a Christmas tree
[17:48.460 --> 17:52.380]  It didn't take you down. It wasn't couch lock. It was it was more of a heady high
[17:53.380 --> 17:58.180]  Whereas that green stuff was was pure couch walk. I mean you smoked that you were down
[17:59.380 --> 18:04.300]  Hours and I'm like you I'm not a I'm not a big fan of just smoke until you drop, you know
[18:04.300 --> 18:09.060]  I'm more about you know, a couple hits here and there just to kind of you know
[18:09.340 --> 18:13.140]  Change your mood or enlighten you or get your mind working
[18:14.140 --> 18:19.900]  But I know there's there's quite a few people out there that just love to just smoke till you drop and that's cool for you
[18:19.900 --> 18:26.100]  You know, everybody's got their the thing and I got no hater hate on that, you know your style
[18:27.020 --> 18:34.660]  Sure. Yeah, that's that was probably my fondest memory was that that red because it just it just made you think just lifted you
[18:34.820 --> 18:37.380]  You know, like didn't even you weren't even walking on the ground
[18:37.900 --> 18:43.260]  Well, I I just think it's so incredible and striking that you know, I mean you you remember
[18:43.780 --> 18:47.540]  Experience that vividly from that long ago, you know
[18:47.540 --> 18:51.620]  I mean the color of it exact feeling the effect and I mean that's like
[18:52.260 --> 18:54.580]  You know, I think most of the people who are
[18:55.260 --> 18:57.220]  As nerdy as me into this, you know
[18:57.220 --> 19:02.420]  I mean that's kind of what we're after is a kind of like hunting for those memories, you know, really
[19:03.460 --> 19:05.460]  spectacular experiences that
[19:05.580 --> 19:10.340]  Just stick in your memory like that every aspect of them. So it's very cool to hear about that
[19:11.140 --> 19:16.540]  Yeah, and then there's you know, and seriously no joke that shit that Frenchie fucking smoked me up was
[19:17.540 --> 19:19.540]  Absolutely friggin amazing now
[19:19.540 --> 19:24.100]  It was like I think they call it a snake in the grass because I pretty sure there was some weed in there
[19:24.100 --> 19:28.100]  And he may have actually even put a little tobacco in there too to keep the temperature up
[19:28.660 --> 19:31.460]  But that stuff was incredible too. Very very heady
[19:31.460 --> 19:37.380]  You know wasn't it wasn't a couch lock of any kind it was it was a very, you know mind opening experience and
[19:38.420 --> 19:40.660]  You know, like I said, I got to spend three hours with him
[19:42.420 --> 19:44.420]  So that was a lot of fun
[19:44.420 --> 19:46.580]  Those are probably some of my fondest memories of ashes
[19:47.220 --> 19:49.620]  Frenchie stumple ball that read from
[19:51.780 --> 19:56.740]  Very cool. Well, I know when I had smoked with with Frenchie, I think he had strawberry banana
[19:56.820 --> 19:58.820]  I remember it tasted like
[20:00.020 --> 20:02.660]  Those candies the real chewy it was like a
[20:04.260 --> 20:10.500]  Like a starburst starburst, that's right. Yeah, there's a strawberry starburst like just coated my whole mouth
[20:12.180 --> 20:15.140]  So, you know naturally I took a few pulls from the hookah
[20:15.860 --> 20:17.300]  and
[20:17.300 --> 20:20.740]  That was a few too many. So I sat down and I
[20:21.460 --> 20:28.900]  Yeah, basically looked around I remember even thinking like if I wanted to stand up right now, I'm not sure that I could do that
[20:30.500 --> 20:32.660]  You know, it just felt like my legs were just
[20:33.300 --> 20:37.380]  waist down was totally I was like temporarily paralyzed and I was like
[20:37.860 --> 20:42.020]  All right, dude, just you know, chill out you're gonna be good and like 30 seconds later
[20:42.740 --> 20:46.980]  I was like, okay, I'm gonna be good. I'm gonna be good. I'm gonna be good. I'm gonna be good
[20:47.300 --> 20:53.140]  All right, dude just you know, chill out you're gonna be good in like 30 minutes or something and I mean I you know
[20:53.220 --> 20:55.220]  I just i've never been
[20:56.500 --> 21:00.980]  That incapacitated I don't think uh, probably since my teens so
[21:01.700 --> 21:04.340]  Um, that was a very memorable experience for me
[21:06.900 --> 21:11.700]  Let's see you hit that uh temple ball. All right. Yeah, I wish uh, I wish I could you know
[21:11.780 --> 21:15.780]  I wish I had the piece. I know Frenchie had those those pieces that um
[21:16.980 --> 21:21.380]  You could just smoke pure temple ball out of them. I'm not sure if you go pipe or the chum
[21:21.860 --> 21:26.980]  Yeah the pipe and it's got like instead of a hole in the bottom. It has three holes at the top
[21:27.620 --> 21:32.740]  Bert was showing that last week. Yeah. Yeah, I would really like like to get one of those so you don't have to get the
[21:32.740 --> 21:37.060]  Flower, but um, i'll try and get you guys a good good view here. Maybe you can see it bubble
[21:40.540 --> 21:51.490]  Ooh, la la
[21:52.130 --> 21:55.810]  There you go, nice, how's that taste
[21:57.650 --> 21:59.650]  So, um
[22:01.010 --> 22:03.010]  It's very unique, um
[22:03.890 --> 22:07.490]  You know this this temple ball was a mix of a lot of different strains
[22:08.050 --> 22:11.650]  like I said, it was a 2019 outdoor my season and um
[22:14.530 --> 22:18.210]  It it has a real flavor that reminds me of um
[22:19.950 --> 22:21.250]  Barbasol
[22:21.250 --> 22:25.810]  Or barbicide it's like, uh, whatever that whatever they keep combs in when you go to the barber
[22:26.370 --> 22:28.370]  That like weird green fluid
[22:28.610 --> 22:31.330]  You remember that shit? Yeah, I forgot about that
[22:31.890 --> 22:37.010]  yeah, that's I forgot about it too until I grew this bud and did this hash run and
[22:37.810 --> 22:42.290]  Every time I smell the temple ball i'm like dude that smells like the barber stuff. Um
[22:43.010 --> 22:45.650]  And it really tastes like it too and it's got this kind of
[22:46.290 --> 22:52.210]  Like hairspray on the back end kind of like sharpie or something just really astringent. Um
[22:52.370 --> 22:57.570]  But super pleasant not not too overwhelming, um, i'm standing so my legs are still working so
[23:00.290 --> 23:04.050]  Give it a minute. Yeah, right. Yeah, i've only taken one toke so
[23:05.970 --> 23:11.490]  Man I feel like you and sticky lungs you guys you boys are on another level of judging, uh cannabis
[23:12.050 --> 23:13.890]  Um speaking of like work and stuff
[23:13.890 --> 23:17.170]  I know we want to get deeper into just breeding and genetics
[23:17.170 --> 23:20.130]  But I wanted to start out with your genetics some of your work
[23:20.290 --> 23:27.890]  Some of your work I wanted to highlight you because I feel like you have access to fantastic genetics, um, then you are you know
[23:29.010 --> 23:33.810]  using your brain the way it seems like you do and you're coming up with some genetics that I feel like are
[23:34.290 --> 23:37.650]  Beautiful and as far as I understand from you know, the people around you
[23:37.970 --> 23:42.050]  Uh, the main one that they've talked about is your golden goat cross with your cherry lime pop
[23:42.370 --> 23:46.050]  Uh, so I was wondering if we could kind of start there and then another one that I always heard you talk
[23:46.370 --> 23:53.330]  Uh was that ripe ripe tide rush cross with the passion fruit I think you you and I briefly discussed that um
[23:53.810 --> 23:57.090]  At endo expo. So those are two two things that are your work
[23:57.170 --> 24:00.930]  that I would love to highlight you on and kind of talk about why you chose those and
[24:01.330 --> 24:07.250]  um kind of dive deeper into breeding because I feel like I try to push that sometimes with other breeders and they just don't
[24:07.730 --> 24:12.450]  Dive as deep as we wish, uh, layton myself and peter wish that they would so if you could kind of
[24:13.250 --> 24:18.610]  Just go a little bit deeper with why you're choosing certain genetics, you know, why are you you know, of course
[24:18.850 --> 24:22.130]  I think we all know why you're messing with mean gene, but like, you know
[24:22.850 --> 24:27.570]  What highlights those kind of high-end genetics for you so that you can take that work and then continue on?
[24:28.210 --> 24:30.130]  And make your own stuff
[24:30.130 --> 24:36.610]  Yeah, um, you know the the reason I really like to work with mean gene. I use tons of his mails
[24:36.850 --> 24:39.890]  Uh as everyone, you know who follows my stuff will know
[24:40.450 --> 24:43.170]  Um, I really like his and bode's stuff. Um
[24:44.130 --> 24:49.090]  Mean gene, I think is a great choice for males. Uh, particularly for someone like me
[24:49.730 --> 24:51.830]  Um, you know, i'm not running huge numbers
[24:53.170 --> 24:59.970]  So, you know, I don't have these giant facilities with rows of plants that i'm testing seeds, uh like crazy
[25:01.410 --> 25:04.130]  so, you know, that's a bit of a disadvantage and
[25:05.090 --> 25:07.250]  so from that perspective, um
[25:07.890 --> 25:09.970]  You know my odds are not as good
[25:10.690 --> 25:14.610]  uh to be you know hunting through if the next guy making seeds can
[25:15.250 --> 25:21.970]  Uh can sort through you know a thousand seeds to find his mail and i'm looking through 10, you know, I mean that's uh,
[25:22.130 --> 25:23.490]  a no-brainer
[25:23.490 --> 25:28.610]  so, um my experience with mean genes gear, uh freeborn selections is just
[25:29.490 --> 25:31.490]  Um, it's so consistent
[25:32.370 --> 25:33.810]  in the quality
[25:33.810 --> 25:34.850]  uh
[25:34.850 --> 25:36.850]  You know if you pop a 10 pack
[25:37.250 --> 25:43.810]  You'll probably find one plant. That's not a keeper or one female whereas, you know, if you're looking through something
[25:44.290 --> 25:47.650]  Um, you know, maybe some cheaper seeds or f1s or whatever
[25:48.130 --> 25:53.090]  Uh, it might be almost the opposite ratio, you know, you might find one or two really special plants
[25:53.570 --> 25:55.650]  And I feel like you know mean gene stuff
[25:56.210 --> 26:00.210]  It's it's like it's very rare to find a plant that you're not
[26:01.070 --> 26:03.070]  completely stoked about um
[26:03.490 --> 26:04.530]  so
[26:04.530 --> 26:09.510]  You know, I thought about that for a while and just thought well it's if that's the case with the females
[26:10.050 --> 26:12.130]  You know, it's got to be the case with the males, too
[26:12.850 --> 26:13.970]  um
[26:13.970 --> 26:16.070]  So for someone running lower numbers
[26:17.410 --> 26:23.010]  The odds of getting a really amazing male, uh from freeborn gear
[26:23.650 --> 26:26.690]  In in my experience is pretty good. Um
[26:27.490 --> 26:32.450]  So that's kind of why I picked him. Uh, and you know anyone who's grown or smoked his stuff knows
[26:33.410 --> 26:37.510]  The the terpene profiles are just unbelievably complex and unique
[26:38.050 --> 26:42.770]  and um, you know, I mean some some of this stuff i've never experienced in cannabis before
[26:43.490 --> 26:45.490]  only only in his seeds, so
[26:46.050 --> 26:48.290]  So that's kind of why I use his stuff. Um
[26:48.930 --> 26:52.370]  It or you know, uh quite a bit. I use his males. Um,
[26:53.010 --> 26:57.250]  and you know when I started doing that the results of my own seeds was just
[26:58.050 --> 27:01.810]  Uh ended up being a lot more consistent a lot more hits than misses
[27:02.930 --> 27:05.170]  so i've just kept up with that trend and
[27:06.130 --> 27:12.850]  Yeah, you know you talked about the golden goat cherry lime pop. Um people have really gravitated to that one. I'm not sure
[27:13.650 --> 27:17.250]  why in particular I I think maybe because both strains are
[27:18.850 --> 27:24.530]  Well known enough that everyone's heard of them, but they're not so well known that everyone's tried them
[27:25.250 --> 27:31.170]  So, you know, those are both two really nice like elite level strains
[27:31.890 --> 27:34.530]  Uh that most people don't have access to um
[27:35.250 --> 27:40.530]  And i'm not you know, cherry lime pop obviously because mean gene hasn't released it but the golden goat
[27:40.610 --> 27:43.510]  I'm, not sure why it never got popular outside colorado
[27:44.770 --> 27:46.770]  It's a really incredible cut
[27:46.930 --> 27:47.890]  uh
[27:47.890 --> 27:50.930]  you know, I I grew it for probably close to
[27:51.730 --> 27:54.610]  Seven or eight years in a row when I first started growing
[27:54.850 --> 27:56.050]  Um
[27:56.050 --> 28:01.650]  And you know, it was just it was ubiquitous. You'd go to a dispensary. They had clones. They had flower they had
[28:02.290 --> 28:07.270]  Everything you'd every dispensary had every golden goat item, um here in colorado
[28:07.970 --> 28:11.270]  And it's no longer really the case. It's kind of a disappearing
[28:11.970 --> 28:16.370]  Uh cut or at least relative to how prolific it used to be
[28:17.330 --> 28:18.690]  so
[28:18.690 --> 28:20.690]  um, I really you know, I got
[28:21.010 --> 28:21.970]  Uh
[28:21.970 --> 28:24.370]  A buddy wonder made me do it passed me the cut
[28:25.410 --> 28:26.450]  and
[28:26.450 --> 28:28.450]  You know, I I don't
[28:28.610 --> 28:35.090]  Enjoy keeping cuts around. Um, you know, I pop so many seeds and I have so many seeds. I just want to get to the next one
[28:35.170 --> 28:35.890]  so
[28:35.890 --> 28:41.090]  Um, he gave me the cut. I didn't really want to keep it around but I thought well, let's pollinate this thing. Um,
[28:41.970 --> 28:44.310]  And it's got you know, these incredible tropical
[28:45.070 --> 28:46.850]  aromas, uh
[28:46.850 --> 28:49.810]  Like really tropical really sweet really fruity
[28:50.450 --> 28:53.330]  Um with some kind of almost hazy notes in there
[28:54.130 --> 28:55.410]  um
[28:55.410 --> 29:02.130]  And you know, I i've always just really loved everything about the strain. It's easy to grow. It's vigorous it it
[29:02.770 --> 29:05.670]  Grows stout, but it smokes like a sativa
[29:06.290 --> 29:09.490]  um, really potent like psychedelic kind of high
[29:10.210 --> 29:11.730]  um
[29:11.730 --> 29:16.690]  So all around just you know, really a winner, uh in in my book and then
[29:17.250 --> 29:23.890]  You know having this killer cherry lime pop male, um right after I had tested the females and they were really special
[29:24.610 --> 29:31.330]  um, so I popped some more grabbed a male and just thought it would be a great match and um,
[29:31.650 --> 29:33.650]  And yeah, everyone has really gravitated
[29:34.530 --> 29:36.530]  toward that one for
[29:37.330 --> 29:42.050]  For reasons that uh, maybe I don't even totally understand but that's that's my take on it
[29:42.130 --> 29:44.930]  Anyways that these are two just really kind of rare
[29:45.650 --> 29:51.730]  Um rare strains with you know, I can't say a bad thing about either one. Um
[29:53.250 --> 30:00.050]  And those are going to be really special pretty fast we've seen some of those grow already so
[30:05.650 --> 30:09.890]  Well, I can uh, I can say that the reason why it's popular is because it's gorgeous
[30:09.970 --> 30:12.450]  I mean people can go to your blog and check it out
[30:12.850 --> 30:16.130]  Uh, there's a lot of especially I you know, I just got back from oklahoma
[30:16.130 --> 30:21.010]  there's still a lot of people out there growing brown wheat, you know that might not even know that like
[30:21.650 --> 30:27.650]  I mean if they've never seen your blog before they probably have no idea that cannabis can even look like that
[30:28.130 --> 30:32.610]  Right. So that's one of the other reasons why I want to kind of take it to the next level with you today is
[30:33.090 --> 30:39.090]  um, it doesn't really take too much other than understanding genetics and if you have the right genetics to play with now
[30:39.090 --> 30:41.890]  I feel like it makes sense to spend a lot of money and run out and
[30:42.210 --> 30:45.670]  But I feel like at the beginning and I made that mistake. I thought infrastructure
[30:46.530 --> 30:47.890]  Uh was extremely important
[30:47.890 --> 30:54.770]  I thought buying aeroponic systems and you know buying the the fanciest things and the high the most expensive nutrients is what grew the best weed
[30:55.170 --> 30:59.730]  Um, and as i've obviously gotten older the simplest things in life. It seems like is where
[31:00.450 --> 31:04.790]  You can really take off and you're able to manage things at a decent pace so that you are successful
[31:05.650 --> 31:08.530]  so that's something that I feel like with your blog man you um,
[31:09.250 --> 31:12.530]  You know, you're you're pumping out a lot of different reviews and I feel like uh,
[31:12.690 --> 31:16.210]  Most people probably have never even seen that cannabis outside of certain states
[31:17.570 --> 31:20.850]  Well, uh, yeah, I I appreciate that brian. Um,
[31:21.890 --> 31:23.890]  you know it it is
[31:24.110 --> 31:29.810]  Incredible that yeah, people are still growing some brown weed today. Um, but but that was certainly
[31:30.450 --> 31:34.690]  At least for me to even growing it, you know, not even the pictures or whatever. Um,
[31:35.650 --> 31:39.890]  That cherry lime pop is the most beautiful plant that i've ever grown. Um,
[31:40.610 --> 31:47.510]  I've just i've never seen anything turn colors like that put out the butt like it was just the complete package aesthetically
[31:48.370 --> 31:49.570]  um
[31:49.570 --> 31:56.290]  Outdoor plants looked like I grew them inside and just set them outside or something. They were just pristine. So
[31:57.250 --> 32:01.250]  um, so that's a really valuable trait that yeah, i'm sure people love and
[32:01.810 --> 32:04.610]  Hopefully is going to pass on to that next generation. So
[32:05.330 --> 32:06.610]  um
[32:06.610 --> 32:09.910]  So yeah, we got to get those to anyone growing brown weed in oklahoma
[32:11.570 --> 32:17.970]  Get yourself some some freeborn or uh, hopefully, you know, some of my seeds will be available here soon. Um,
[32:18.850 --> 32:21.330]  and uh, hopefully we can get some of that stuff out but
[32:21.970 --> 32:22.770]  um
[32:22.770 --> 32:29.250]  Let's talk about the uh, the other genetics that you're popular here in colorado with the riptide rush cross with that passion fruit
[32:29.570 --> 32:32.050]  I believe it's the connie. Am I pronouncing that correctly?
[32:32.850 --> 32:39.890]  Uh passion fruit, uh dakini or dakini. Yeah, so, um, yeah, there's a lot to to dive in there
[32:40.450 --> 32:41.570]  um
[32:41.570 --> 32:43.410]  Peter which one is that?
[32:43.410 --> 32:50.290]  That cherry lime pop. Yeah, so that that's a sister to the male that I use to pollinate that golden goat
[32:50.930 --> 32:52.290]  um
[32:52.290 --> 32:58.850]  And yeah, I mean if you if you scroll down peter there. Yeah, I mean like that's outdoor full season outdoor full sun
[32:59.250 --> 33:00.290]  flower
[33:00.290 --> 33:05.730]  You know never any kind of film, uh put over it totally exposed to the elements. Um,
[33:06.690 --> 33:10.450]  And and so I mean, you know just visually stunning just an absolute
[33:11.150 --> 33:13.150]  completely beautiful plant, um
[33:13.890 --> 33:15.890]  so yeah, you know the the uh,
[33:16.690 --> 33:20.130]  Riptide rush we can we can talk about that first. Um
[33:20.850 --> 33:25.490]  That was a cross that I made many years ago. It was one of the first crosses i've ever made
[33:26.130 --> 33:31.890]  Um, it's a cross of remedy and a chocolate rain f2 male
[33:32.690 --> 33:36.630]  Uh, so remedy is a clone only it's cbd dominant
[33:37.250 --> 33:42.130]  Uh, the ratio ends up being about 33 to 1 cbd to thc
[33:42.610 --> 33:47.730]  So very heavy on the cbd side, but the thc is about 0.6 or 0.7
[33:49.010 --> 33:51.010]  So it's not legal hemp
[33:51.010 --> 33:52.210]  Um
[33:52.210 --> 33:57.810]  And one year I was I was given a bunch of hemp clones and very high cbd clones
[33:58.290 --> 34:02.930]  Um, this was right when cbd was getting popular, you know, maybe 10 years ago or something. Um,
[34:03.810 --> 34:05.090]  and
[34:05.090 --> 34:08.610]  I uh, you know, I really wanted to lock down some of this stuff in seed
[34:09.330 --> 34:11.330]  So I grew out all the cbd cuts
[34:11.810 --> 34:18.210]  Um, you know r4 charlotte's web stuff like that and honestly, I thought it was terrible. Um
[34:19.170 --> 34:22.690]  Not you know, the plants weren't vigorous the the weed looked like schwag
[34:23.330 --> 34:25.330]  um, it was just
[34:25.410 --> 34:29.890]  Very disappointing. Um didn't enjoy smoking it but the remedy on the other hand
[34:30.610 --> 34:36.210]  Looked like high quality flower smelled like high quality flour grew like high quality flour
[34:36.850 --> 34:39.890]  um, and then you smoked it and it just didn't get you high and
[34:40.450 --> 34:42.450]  It was like the craziest thing to me
[34:42.610 --> 34:46.210]  Um that there was this beautiful gorgeous. It was even sticky
[34:46.770 --> 34:49.410]  Uh, it was like this incredible flower, um
[34:50.850 --> 34:52.850]  And we just call that beasters
[34:53.730 --> 35:00.130]  bc, yeah, right. Yeah, right. So, uh, you know, yeah, I grew up on beasters being in the midwest, you know
[35:00.130 --> 35:04.050]  We got all the import from from bc. Um, but it was uh,
[35:04.530 --> 35:09.650]  You know, even even beasters would probably get you more stone than remedy. So, um, you know, it was just
[35:10.130 --> 35:15.890]  But I I saw the value in that I guess, you know, I saw the value in this is still really high quality flour
[35:16.450 --> 35:18.450]  It's just very high cbd
[35:18.770 --> 35:20.770]  Um, so I wanted to breed with it
[35:21.250 --> 35:24.530]  Uh, I got some seeds from whiskey 420
[35:25.330 --> 35:28.370]  Uh, he had he had he's on the boards and stuff like that
[35:28.370 --> 35:31.890]  And I guess he had some chocolate rain from eskibar seeds, which is
[35:32.850 --> 35:37.250]  A cross of dj shorts cocoa cush and dna genetics chocolope
[35:37.490 --> 35:41.190]  So two of these kind of, you know strains with uh chocolate leaning aromas
[35:42.370 --> 35:48.690]  And you know whiskey made the f2s pass them to me. I popped some got a killer mail
[35:49.810 --> 35:53.810]  Smelled like, you know berries and and even on the stem rub had
[35:54.930 --> 36:00.130]  Those kind of astringent bitter dark chocolate notes like almost like a bag of cocoa
[36:01.170 --> 36:04.690]  And it was just really impressive. I I had never experienced that
[36:04.770 --> 36:09.810]  So I you know didn't know if it translated to the flower it was a male but I wanted to try it
[36:09.970 --> 36:12.850]  So hit the remedy with that pollen. Um
[36:14.050 --> 36:17.730]  Ended up growing out some of those seeds, uh in in my outdoor
[36:18.850 --> 36:20.850]  season the following year
[36:20.850 --> 36:22.850]  and
[36:22.850 --> 36:28.850]  It was it was really lovely smoke. Is this the right one that that is yep. So that's the riptide rush right there
[36:29.810 --> 36:31.810]  So you can see
[36:32.050 --> 36:35.090]  It's got huge huge calyxes, which is kind of cool
[36:36.770 --> 36:39.410]  And you can see that that's all full of seeds there
[36:40.050 --> 36:42.050]  but still very resinous and
[36:42.610 --> 36:46.610]  The reason I named it riptide rush. That's uh, that's a gatorade flavor
[36:47.810 --> 36:52.530]  And to me that flower smells just like that gatorade. It's like this grapey
[36:53.730 --> 36:55.330]  uh
[36:55.330 --> 36:57.330]  Um, it's like a grapey
[36:57.730 --> 37:00.150]  Just like that gatorade it's like this grapey
[37:01.170 --> 37:03.010]  uh
[37:03.010 --> 37:06.450]  like there's this weird funk on the back end to almost like
[37:07.490 --> 37:08.930]  mowed lawn
[37:08.930 --> 37:15.810]  Fun dip and like I don't know like a little bit of dumpster maybe just a hint of dumpster. It's just um
[37:16.290 --> 37:19.490]  Really complex but a very grapey fruity sweet
[37:21.250 --> 37:22.290]  And
[37:22.290 --> 37:26.550]  Fun dip like the with the little sugar stick and the powder back in the day. Yeah, exactly
[37:26.550 --> 37:28.550]  Yeah, like the grape one
[37:29.430 --> 37:31.430]  Totally it's like that kind of
[37:31.510 --> 37:33.190]  What was the highlight?
[37:33.190 --> 37:35.750]  Uh, so that was the most interesting part
[37:35.990 --> 37:42.070]  Um everybody, you know, all my friends that i'd gifted this to loved it. I loved it. It was like
[37:43.030 --> 37:45.350]  You know, I grew it next to all these. Um
[37:46.470 --> 37:51.270]  clone only strains and some freeborn and some bode and some of my seeds and
[37:52.070 --> 37:57.670]  You know even the triangle cush and I passed around these flowers to you know, all my buddies as usual
[37:58.390 --> 37:59.410]  and
[37:59.410 --> 38:05.750]  Everyone said the same thing. This was their favorite weed to smoke. Um, which was astounding to me because
[38:06.870 --> 38:09.190]  Uh, it doesn't get you the most high
[38:10.070 --> 38:13.110]  You know all the like the triangle will get you way more blasted
[38:13.750 --> 38:18.310]  all all the other stuff would just blast you and the riptide rush was just this
[38:19.250 --> 38:21.510]  Consistent good feeling. Um
[38:22.230 --> 38:24.330]  Like happy euphoric optimistic
[38:24.950 --> 38:31.610]  But also relaxed it it was just it's everything that you want from cannabis. Um from the cannabis experience
[38:32.310 --> 38:33.590]  and so
[38:33.590 --> 38:39.030]  You know pretty much everybody that I gave this to that was their favorite and I think if it wasn't they had said it was
[38:39.030 --> 38:41.030]  Like their second favorite. Um
[38:41.430 --> 38:45.750]  So super special, you know, just being that like cbd thc blend
[38:46.470 --> 38:47.430]  um
[38:47.430 --> 38:52.390]  Probably somewhere around to one a one-to-one ratio I would guess but i've never had it tested
[38:53.030 --> 38:54.310]  um
[38:54.310 --> 38:56.310]  And so that was the riptide rush
[38:56.950 --> 38:57.990]  and
[38:57.990 --> 39:00.950]  I've still got some of those seeds, but i'm you know
[39:00.950 --> 39:06.470]  I I gave so many out and nobody ever grew them and i've lost contact with a lot of those people
[39:06.790 --> 39:11.910]  Um, so what I do have i'm really trying to hang on to until I can increase those
[39:12.550 --> 39:13.910]  um
[39:13.910 --> 39:16.550]  So so hopefully I can can do that soon
[39:17.830 --> 39:23.990]  But that that plant that you've got pictured there peter. Uh, that's the one that I pollinated with the passion fruit
[39:24.530 --> 39:25.750]  daquini
[39:25.750 --> 39:32.070]  Uh or dakini so so we can talk about that one too and then kind of get into maybe how that's crossed
[39:32.310 --> 39:34.310]  Um, I hope i'm not just like rambling
[39:34.870 --> 39:36.150]  at you guys
[39:36.150 --> 39:36.550]  No, man
[39:36.550 --> 39:38.950]  we can't this is why you're on the show is because I
[39:39.350 --> 39:44.710]  I meant like you're living up to the higher thought like you you take this on another level than even other people that um
[39:45.350 --> 39:50.230]  I feel like really understand cannabis and I I truly do mean that I feel like you and sticky lungs are people that
[39:50.390 --> 39:56.390]  That stick out among a lot of talented people where you guys just have a nose you guys have a way of explaining things
[39:56.470 --> 39:58.150]  there's little um
[39:58.150 --> 40:02.070]  Hints, uh that it seems like you guys can pick up that other people can't
[40:02.470 --> 40:07.110]  uh, and i'm definitely one of them because when I hang out with that guy when he starts breaking down stuff i'm like
[40:07.750 --> 40:11.590]  I mean, it's just very impressive. So, uh, we want you to ramble man
[40:11.590 --> 40:15.990]  We want to kind of dive or dive deeper into this stuff and I have a bunch of different strands
[40:15.990 --> 40:17.990]  We're gonna we're gonna talk about for sure
[40:18.230 --> 40:26.070]  Right on. All right. Yeah, i'm just i'm not uh, totally i'm not conditioned to you know, just ranting at three other the other people here. So, um
[40:26.790 --> 40:28.790]  Just a little self-conscious. So
[40:30.630 --> 40:36.870]  All right, right on well, please please interrupt me if uh, if you've got any questions or you know anything to offer, um
[40:37.830 --> 40:38.710]  so
[40:38.710 --> 40:41.750]  uh, i'll get into the passion fruit though, which is um,
[40:42.790 --> 40:47.030]  uh, the the father to the cross that you were asking about brian, so
[40:47.670 --> 40:49.670]  so we had that uh
[40:50.070 --> 40:52.070]  Riptide rush female
[40:52.230 --> 40:53.190]  and
[40:53.190 --> 40:58.390]  the father that I pollinated that with um was from this passion fruit dakini, which is
[40:59.110 --> 41:00.070]  uh
[41:00.070 --> 41:02.710]  I hate to say I think I ripped the name off of bode
[41:02.950 --> 41:07.190]  Um when I was I think I like got stoned and forgot that he even made this
[41:07.590 --> 41:10.410]  Uh, he had a a strain called strawberry
[41:11.350 --> 41:14.330]  Uh dakini, I think, you know play on strawberry daiquiri
[41:15.590 --> 41:17.590]  a dakini is a
[41:18.390 --> 41:26.170]  Being from buddhist lore. It's a female entity that usually helps a bodhisattva achieve enlightenment
[41:27.030 --> 41:28.070]  um
[41:28.070 --> 41:30.070]  So I thought that that was kind of a cool
[41:30.150 --> 41:33.590]  Uh, you know name for the canvas plan. It's like this female entity that
[41:34.230 --> 41:37.830]  You know can really um open up our minds in some ways and
[41:38.470 --> 41:42.070]  um, but anyway, so I think that was bodhi's idea so I kind of uh
[41:42.710 --> 41:49.190]  Thought about changing the name and stuff. Um, but it's it's a cross of in the pines and copper chem
[41:49.990 --> 41:58.230]  um, which was interestingly enough kind of an accidental not necessarily accidental I should say incidental cross that I made um,
[41:58.630 --> 41:59.670]  I
[41:59.670 --> 42:01.670]  Was doing a copper chem pollination
[42:02.230 --> 42:07.270]  So I you know, I picked a male from that and at the time I had a much larger grow space
[42:07.350 --> 42:11.190]  I had a lot of plants. Um downtown boulder just blew up a house
[42:12.630 --> 42:14.630]  and
[42:14.630 --> 42:18.310]  I ate, you know, I I was very well connected at the time as well and uh,
[42:18.950 --> 42:25.430]  A guy in boulder had given me all the chem and sour cuts that he had it was like east coast sour chem four
[42:26.310 --> 42:27.910]  um
[42:27.970 --> 42:29.970]  lupus headband
[42:30.150 --> 42:32.150]  ghost og
[42:32.550 --> 42:35.430]  Aj sour, uh the east coast sour
[42:37.590 --> 42:42.790]  Chem three chem sister it was like, you know, almost all the chems and sours and uh
[42:42.870 --> 42:47.110]  We wanted to pollinate it with this copper chem and just have like this crazy
[42:48.230 --> 42:51.350]  You know, uh bank of sour and chem seeds
[42:53.110 --> 42:57.590]  So and at the time I just happened to have popped two packs of into pines from
[42:58.130 --> 43:01.030]  aficionado, but really mostly from mean gene
[43:02.710 --> 43:04.070]  And
[43:04.070 --> 43:08.870]  Popping those two packs, you know, I'd never paid that much for seeds before they're like 150 bucks a pack
[43:09.270 --> 43:11.590]  um, which is like mind-blowing to me and
[43:12.150 --> 43:15.990]  It's like dude, these have to be the best, you know, they've got this amazing packaging and all this
[43:15.990 --> 43:21.110]  So I was really pumped up by aficionado got these seeds. Um grew out two packs
[43:21.910 --> 43:23.910]  And pollinated every female
[43:24.550 --> 43:26.550]  with that copper chem male
[43:27.110 --> 43:30.870]  So it was mostly for the sour and chem seeds but we ended up, you know
[43:30.870 --> 43:33.990]  I ended up coming out of it with these in the pines copper chem
[43:34.550 --> 43:35.750]  and
[43:35.750 --> 43:37.750]  Again from that run
[43:37.750 --> 43:42.230]  Uh in the pines was by far my favorite thing to smoke from that run. Um
[43:43.190 --> 43:46.490]  It was you know, super euphoric super uplifting
[43:47.510 --> 43:49.510]  Very feel good very happy
[43:50.070 --> 43:54.070]  Um, you know made you laugh just like almost like smokable joy
[43:54.630 --> 43:55.590]  um
[43:55.590 --> 44:00.630]  so that was really incredible bud and it you know, it really did smell and taste like pineapple upside down cake or
[44:01.590 --> 44:05.910]  The the syrup that you get in canned pineapples. It was very intense pineapple flavor
[44:06.470 --> 44:08.470]  Um, which was really cool
[44:08.550 --> 44:10.150]  so
[44:10.150 --> 44:14.070]  I ended up, you know after that long story short just with my personal life
[44:14.150 --> 44:18.310]  I ended up going to new zealand for about a year, you know, I wasn't growing
[44:19.110 --> 44:21.110]  at all, um
[44:21.190 --> 44:27.670]  You know came back was just kind of bouncing around the states I I was just you know figuring out a lot of my life basically
[44:27.990 --> 44:29.110]  um
[44:29.110 --> 44:33.990]  And didn't grow for a while. And then when I did get back to growing that was really the first thing
[44:34.710 --> 44:40.070]  That appealed to my mind, you know, I just I remembered the in the pines remembered how awesome it was
[44:40.630 --> 44:42.070]  and wanted to
[44:42.070 --> 44:44.070]  Uh get back into it
[44:44.310 --> 44:45.110]  so
[44:45.110 --> 44:47.110]  I popped those seeds the uh
[44:47.590 --> 44:49.590]  in the pines crossed a copper chem
[44:50.470 --> 44:56.790]  And they ended up being this really bizarre mix as you might expect from two totally different strains
[44:58.310 --> 45:02.470]  But it was really incredible those were like my two favorite smokes from that big run
[45:02.790 --> 45:07.590]  And so to have crossed them like it was just it was all my favorite parts about weed. Um
[45:08.230 --> 45:11.670]  The flowers were sour. They were super dank like
[45:12.230 --> 45:17.510]  That like, you know nose crinkling funky dank smell like skunk vomit
[45:20.150 --> 45:21.190]  Just like
[45:21.190 --> 45:24.870]  acidic and skunky and funky but also
[45:25.430 --> 45:28.790]  Had these kind of hints of candy and so it was both
[45:29.350 --> 45:32.950]  Like repulsive and very attractive at the same time
[45:33.590 --> 45:34.790]  um
[45:34.790 --> 45:37.030]  and and then not to mention, you know, just uh
[45:37.670 --> 45:42.790]  Visually stunning just really beautiful tons of resin lots of purple coloring
[45:43.430 --> 45:44.310]  um
[45:44.310 --> 45:46.310]  Just nice flower formation
[45:46.630 --> 45:48.070]  um
[45:48.070 --> 45:50.070]  So that was the passion fruit
[45:50.550 --> 45:55.110]  And I liked it so much the next year. I ended up popping quite a bit more
[45:55.830 --> 45:57.670]  made some f2s
[45:57.670 --> 45:58.870]  um
[45:58.870 --> 46:00.390]  and
[46:00.390 --> 46:02.390]  With the males from that run I pollinated
[46:03.110 --> 46:04.550]  uh the
[46:04.550 --> 46:06.550]  Riptide rush as well
[46:06.790 --> 46:09.610]  So now, you know now we've got this kind of crazy combination
[46:10.310 --> 46:11.350]  of
[46:11.350 --> 46:13.350]  You know, I guess about a decade
[46:14.310 --> 46:15.590]  uh
[46:15.590 --> 46:19.510]  You know over the course of a decade of my growing experience, I guess of taking you know
[46:19.590 --> 46:23.750]  the the remedy to the chocolate rain f2 that I traded to some dude for
[46:24.550 --> 46:25.750]  and then the
[46:25.750 --> 46:27.750]  in the pines and the copper chem and
[46:28.790 --> 46:30.790]  combining those and then um
[46:31.670 --> 46:36.550]  Breeding both of those parents. So, uh, I've i've just recently seen
[46:37.350 --> 46:39.350]  Some of those crosses grown out
[46:39.830 --> 46:41.350]  that final cross
[46:41.350 --> 46:45.110]  Uh, one of my friends in missouri who grows incredible flowers
[46:45.670 --> 46:46.870]  um
[46:46.870 --> 46:48.870]  ended up growing those out and
[46:49.350 --> 46:50.550]  it uh
[46:50.550 --> 46:52.550]  really interesting you get um
[46:53.110 --> 46:58.870]  You get some plants that show up almost like remedy but with totally different turf profiles. So
[46:59.830 --> 47:06.710]  Uh, they still have that grapey fruit smell from the remedy like grapefruit and actual grapes and like bubble gum
[47:07.350 --> 47:09.750]  um, but there's so much more to it
[47:10.470 --> 47:11.350]  from
[47:11.350 --> 47:15.510]  Everything else in that mix. It's like it has some of that funk from the copper chem
[47:16.070 --> 47:20.630]  Uh, really sticky really beautiful. You break it up you roll a joint and smoke it. It tastes great
[47:21.110 --> 47:23.110]  and at the end of the joint you're like
[47:23.510 --> 47:29.430]  Should I even smoke any weed like i'm not high like you still you know, you still have the compulsion to smoke. So
[47:29.990 --> 47:35.770]  um, so those you know, those are funny plants, uh, and then on the total opposite end of the spectrum
[47:36.550 --> 47:39.270]  Um, I guess not total opposite, but we were seeing
[47:39.990 --> 47:41.270]  uh
[47:41.590 --> 47:46.950]  You know plants not only like the remedy but some that were showing up just like the riptide rush that really grapey
[47:47.670 --> 47:50.950]  Uh smell and taste and probably about a one-to-one ratio
[47:51.670 --> 47:57.830]  um, but all the color from the passion fruit zucchini and the resin and the structure is there so
[47:58.950 --> 48:01.910]  So it's a it's a really sweet combination. I think there's
[48:02.470 --> 48:05.830]  Quite a bit of hunting to be done in there depending on what you're looking for
[48:06.470 --> 48:08.470]  uh, there's just so much variation but
[48:09.030 --> 48:10.470]  Um
[48:10.470 --> 48:15.030]  definitely for anybody who enjoys that kind of, you know mix of CBD or
[48:15.670 --> 48:17.190]  um
[48:17.190 --> 48:22.550]  you know if if you're just after something unique, I mean it's uh, there there's not
[48:23.590 --> 48:25.590]  a whole lot of flowers out like this. So
[48:25.990 --> 48:27.430]  um
[48:27.430 --> 48:32.630]  Just yeah, really yeah weed light. Yeah, it says h70 below. That's exactly it. It's like
[48:33.270 --> 48:34.150]  um
[48:34.150 --> 48:39.030]  You smoke it and you're like, uh, you know again depending on the plant you might want to smoke something else or
[48:39.590 --> 48:41.590]  Or it might be your favorite flower
[48:42.150 --> 48:43.350]  so
[48:43.350 --> 48:46.390]  lots of hunting to be done lots of variation, but um
[48:48.150 --> 48:55.190]  Yeah, those are that's one of my cooler in my opinion but more obscure crosses that nobody really asks about so
[48:56.790 --> 49:02.230]  Now have you ever uh had your gear washed by someone and and they've come back and said like yo
[49:02.470 --> 49:09.430]  This is the one or anything like that, you know, I haven't um, I wash all my own stuff. Um,
[49:10.950 --> 49:16.730]  And you know most of the time there's so many strains in each run that I don't do isolated
[49:18.950 --> 49:22.310]  You know temple ball runs I do it every now and then sometimes i'll
[49:23.030 --> 49:27.830]  Fill up an area with with something. Um, but for the most part they're like blends
[49:27.990 --> 49:34.810]  So I hate to say i'm probably ignorant of what wash is great, uh things that extract fantastically
[49:35.510 --> 49:37.510]  And I just kind of speculate on that
[49:39.030 --> 49:43.750]  Right on yeah, so most of the you know, the feedback that I get from people is really just
[49:44.470 --> 49:49.270]  Friends that are smoking my flowers and then you know, i'll really kind of harass them
[49:50.230 --> 49:53.450]  About you know, what like what are you smoking the most? What are you enjoying?
[49:54.230 --> 49:56.310]  Uh, you know, what do you what are you doing?
[49:56.790 --> 50:02.310]  When you smoke this weed because I feel like a lot of times it's unconscious like you don't even know
[50:03.270 --> 50:04.550]  um
[50:04.550 --> 50:06.550]  You know, you might you might be
[50:06.950 --> 50:09.590]  Smoking, you know weed a every day
[50:10.470 --> 50:13.430]  right before you go for a walk because it happens to
[50:14.070 --> 50:17.430]  you know get you invigorated or get your mind going or whatever and
[50:17.990 --> 50:20.950]  you really like the walk and then next time you you
[50:21.430 --> 50:26.070]  Go buy a bag. It's weed b and now you're smoking it and watching a movie or something. You know what I mean?
[50:26.310 --> 50:28.310]  um, so I kind of like to
[50:28.710 --> 50:30.710]  To ask people like yeah. So what do you?
[50:31.270 --> 50:35.110]  You know, like what are you doing when you smoke this weed? What what kind of experiences are you having?
[50:35.990 --> 50:38.630]  um, i'm not sure if that that all makes sense, but
[50:39.670 --> 50:41.670]  Yeah, absolutely. And um
[50:41.670 --> 50:46.330]  Uh laden if you have a question, otherwise that he's he's reviewed so many um cultivars
[50:46.950 --> 50:49.750]  Uh, I say it different every time so I appease everyone
[50:50.150 --> 50:55.510]  Uh, you know, you know people get stuck on that shit. Uh, but you know, you had mentioned that um,
[50:55.990 --> 50:59.190]  You know, how come gorilla glue number four really didn't gg4?
[50:59.270 --> 51:02.790]  How come that didn't really take off? I feel like at least for us, you know
[51:02.870 --> 51:09.830]  It seems like now maybe a decade ago that and blue dreams were everywhere. It was 99% fake cuts
[51:10.230 --> 51:15.830]  um, and it definitely seems like jim that you have access to the real genetics and that's another thing why I want to dive deeper
[51:15.910 --> 51:20.710]  into the genetics that you not only are reviewing but it seems like again the ones you're breeding with and
[51:21.250 --> 51:23.250]  cultivating with and all of that stuff because
[51:24.130 --> 51:30.870]  As i've definitely gotten older and understanding things it really is the genetics that is going to allow you to separate yourself from the competition
[51:31.730 --> 51:33.730]  And if you can understand that from day one
[51:35.010 --> 51:38.370]  There's just a better playing field that you're going to have when you're doing your pheno hunts, you know
[51:38.450 --> 51:43.410]  I I personally thought like hey, you know, here's this guy when I first started especially at endo expo
[51:43.490 --> 51:47.010]  you'd see long lines and you'd find out the the prices for some of those packs and
[51:47.650 --> 51:52.690]  That was just too much for us back then. So we would get gear that was maybe 20 bucks 50 bucks something like that
[51:53.330 --> 51:55.330]  and then at the end of the day, you know you have
[51:55.970 --> 52:00.050]  Huge problems sometimes and granted that could have been us trying to figure things out back then
[52:00.690 --> 52:02.850]  But there was just a lot of issues that we had by not
[52:03.310 --> 52:10.710]  Focusing on genetics and focusing on more of the infrastructure of growing things and we definitely thought that the more futuristic
[52:11.010 --> 52:15.650]  So aeroponics seemed like the coolest thing to us or at least that's what we were sold on at the time
[52:16.290 --> 52:20.930]  And it really is the simplistic stuff just coming back to soil building your soil systems
[52:21.570 --> 52:24.690]  And moving forward with understanding how those systems work
[52:25.870 --> 52:30.050]  Absolutely. Um, so, you know, I could touch on a couple different points there. Um,
[52:30.930 --> 52:33.170]  when I first got into cannabis, uh
[52:34.130 --> 52:37.910]  I had actually partnered on a company called multiponics
[52:39.250 --> 52:43.670]  Which we used to manufacture high pressure aeroponic
[52:44.770 --> 52:46.290]  growing systems
[52:46.290 --> 52:47.810]  um and
[52:47.810 --> 52:51.090]  Part of the reason for that, you know, I was probably in the same boat as you brian
[52:52.210 --> 52:53.250]  before
[52:53.250 --> 52:55.250]  having any actual or
[52:55.310 --> 52:57.730]  minimal hands-on experience growing cannabis
[52:58.370 --> 52:59.410]  um
[52:59.410 --> 53:05.810]  You know, you only can speculate and after reading all the books, you know, it sounded to me like man high pressure aero. I mean
[53:06.370 --> 53:08.850]  NASA is using this technology. It's got to be
[53:09.650 --> 53:11.650]  the best way to grow
[53:12.210 --> 53:13.890]  So I was really into that
[53:13.890 --> 53:15.890]  uh for a little bit until
[53:16.770 --> 53:19.810]  You know, I grew it side by side with some organic living soil
[53:20.210 --> 53:21.010]  um
[53:21.010 --> 53:25.730]  And that totally that changed it for me. I uh, never grew aeroponics again. So
[53:26.370 --> 53:27.250]  um
[53:27.250 --> 53:33.810]  So we can get into some of that. Uh, there's a lot of detail there, you know, i'd spent years, uh doing the high pressure aero thing
[53:35.250 --> 53:39.830]  But you know you also mentioned, uh having access to genetics
[53:40.770 --> 53:43.970]  And that's something that I really can't take
[53:44.370 --> 53:49.570]  A ton of personal credit for um, it's either
[53:50.930 --> 53:58.210]  you know, it's really just been the generosity and grace of the people that I have, uh connected with or made friends with or
[53:58.770 --> 54:00.770]  or whatever out here, um
[54:01.250 --> 54:04.850]  you know, I I had gotten in with uh a guy who
[54:05.890 --> 54:11.010]  um, he owns, you know some cannabis businesses now and we we no longer really communicate but
[54:11.730 --> 54:13.890]  Uh, he happened to have
[54:14.690 --> 54:18.150]  An incredible genetic library that he had been compiling
[54:18.930 --> 54:20.930]  You know long before cannabis was legal
[54:21.410 --> 54:27.170]  And so he had you know, every clone only og every uh chem cut, you know all these
[54:28.210 --> 54:30.210]  hazes from amsterdam like
[54:30.370 --> 54:37.090]  he he had this amazing library and we connected and you know, he knew I was really into seeds and so
[54:37.810 --> 54:39.810]  I was fortunate to be
[54:39.810 --> 54:41.810]  past cuts from this guy and
[54:42.050 --> 54:43.010]  um
[54:43.010 --> 54:44.450]  and you know to be
[54:44.450 --> 54:49.570]  Most people will give you a cut one time and then they kind of expect that you're gonna keep it then
[54:50.130 --> 54:51.090]  um
[54:51.090 --> 54:56.690]  I could just do seed runs, you know and just go back to this guy and say hey get me x y and z for this run
[54:56.690 --> 54:59.410]  I'm using this mail and he'd say yeah, that sounds good
[54:59.410 --> 55:04.370]  Well, why don't you take abc too because I want those crossed your mail and i'd say great
[55:04.930 --> 55:06.930]  And that was a pretty good relationship
[55:07.010 --> 55:07.890]  um
[55:07.890 --> 55:08.690]  so
[55:08.690 --> 55:12.070]  You know, that was kind of my my in uh at the beginning
[55:13.410 --> 55:17.730]  and then making some of these crosses, you know people take notice and they want seeds and
[55:18.290 --> 55:22.450]  you can trade your seeds for their cuts and um, so it kind of snowballs and
[55:23.410 --> 55:26.210]  And so i've just been really blessed over the years, you know to know
[55:27.010 --> 55:27.890]  maybe
[55:27.890 --> 55:30.050]  three or four different people that um
[55:31.010 --> 55:35.970]  That really are the guys doing the hard work keeping these libraries around and
[55:36.850 --> 55:41.970]  um, you know if you're making seeds, I mean you can usually get in those guys good graces of
[55:42.850 --> 55:47.090]  Hooking them back up with seeds, you know and give them some seeds give them some flowers, you know
[55:47.170 --> 55:49.650]  get the cuts from those guys and um
[55:50.610 --> 55:53.250]  And you know, like you said brian. I mean a lot of this
[55:53.970 --> 55:56.770]  There's a lot of fake uh clones going around. So
[55:57.490 --> 55:59.490]  When you find somebody
[55:59.570 --> 56:02.610]  Who you know, you run their stuff and it's amazing
[56:03.330 --> 56:05.330]  And you know, it's the real deal
[56:05.970 --> 56:07.330]  um
[56:07.330 --> 56:10.930]  That's usually somebody who's you know, pretty good to be buddies with so
[56:11.490 --> 56:12.930]  um
[56:12.930 --> 56:17.730]  so i've really been blessed with you know, the people that i've connected without here and
[56:18.290 --> 56:24.050]  um, maybe that's you know something i've attracted with my kind of way of viewing cannabis, but
[56:24.610 --> 56:28.130]  um, just been really fortunate more than anything I think so
[56:29.730 --> 56:32.370]  Yeah, I think sometimes in life a little luck goes a long way
[56:32.850 --> 56:33.650]  um
[56:33.650 --> 56:35.650]  you're definitely running with solid stuff and
[56:35.890 --> 56:42.450]  uh something else that I learned um is that you know the gg4 until I actually uh started working for a brief a little
[56:42.450 --> 56:46.050]  Bit on oklahoma with cat from the gg4 crew
[56:46.770 --> 56:47.890]  uh
[56:47.890 --> 56:49.890]  I personally had grown gg
[56:50.130 --> 56:55.650]  Several, you know several different cultivars from friends and all this kind of stuff. It was from the homies homie blah blah blah
[56:55.730 --> 56:59.330]  And i'd never seen uh when we got the real cut from her
[56:59.810 --> 57:05.090]  Uh, you know the the full genetic profile the the beauty the the purpleness to it
[57:05.090 --> 57:05.650]  so, um
[57:05.650 --> 57:11.010]  Can we kind of dive into that because I feel like a lot of us still to this day even in like I like I just
[57:11.090 --> 57:17.170]  You know, I mentioned in oklahoma. It kind of reminds me of colorado, uh, you know, however many years ago where
[57:17.650 --> 57:23.250]  um, the public isn't educated enough to go like yo, no, like that's not biscotti like that's just
[57:23.570 --> 57:27.970]  Regular or like the real unique stuff that supposedly they're charging a higher price for
[57:28.530 --> 57:31.570]  Um and gg is always seems to be one of those out there
[57:32.210 --> 57:34.210]  That is a huge knockoff
[57:34.530 --> 57:39.170]  Same thing with blue dreams, you know, so, uh, let's kind of go into I know you reviewed the gg4
[57:39.810 --> 57:43.730]  It definitely seemed like it was the real cut to me from my experience of growing it
[57:43.810 --> 57:48.290]  So that's the the first review that i'd love to kind of dive deeper with you and talk about
[57:49.090 --> 57:56.530]  Sure. Yeah, that's funny. Um, you know, the gorilla glue is not particularly my favorite smoke. I think it's great. I love the aroma
[57:58.050 --> 58:00.610]  You know, it's so complex the smell. Um,
[58:01.890 --> 58:04.050]  Especially when it's grown well, um
[58:05.490 --> 58:07.810]  But yeah, you know it's interesting because
[58:08.750 --> 58:13.330]  Sometimes I've I think some of those really poor quality flowers that you get that
[58:14.130 --> 58:16.130]  You know, you don't think it's legit. Um
[58:17.410 --> 58:21.090]  Sometimes I wonder if it's really a fake clone or
[58:21.810 --> 58:27.090]  If it's the real clone and it was just grown and cured and processed really poorly
[58:27.810 --> 58:28.850]  um
[58:28.850 --> 58:31.330]  because you know, sometimes you'll get something that
[58:32.210 --> 58:38.690]  You know, like to me the best gorilla glue in the world smells it's again. It's very complex. It's like chocolate
[58:39.570 --> 58:40.850]  fuel
[58:40.850 --> 58:42.610]  um
[58:42.610 --> 58:48.370]  You know sour really funky like it's got it's got that nose crinkle kind of quality of
[58:49.090 --> 58:52.370]  You know what you might call stereotypical like dank. Um
[58:54.450 --> 58:56.130]  And
[58:56.210 --> 59:02.210]  You know and just beautiful flower obviously, you know stunning completely covered in resin extremely sticky. Um
[59:03.410 --> 59:04.450]  and
[59:04.450 --> 59:10.610]  You know, sometimes I think people do get the legit cut and then they do such a bad job of
[59:11.170 --> 59:13.250]  whether growing processing or both that
[59:13.970 --> 59:15.970]  By the time you get the flower
[59:16.370 --> 59:21.810]  It only has one of those qualities. So maybe it's or two so it's just kind of like sour and funky
[59:22.370 --> 59:27.410]  Um and it just you know, it ends up being kind of flat when you open the jar it's like oh, yeah, it smells all right
[59:28.530 --> 59:31.490]  Whereas something that's really been treated properly
[59:32.130 --> 59:34.550]  You open up the jar and it's this explosion
[59:35.170 --> 59:42.790]  Of you know sensation in your in your nose and your nostril like your uh sinuses, you know everything it's it's this whole experience
[59:43.170 --> 59:44.050]  um
[59:44.050 --> 59:48.850]  so sometimes, you know, i'm i'm not sure if it's because they they don't have the real deal cuts or
[59:49.090 --> 59:52.130]  Because it was grown poorly. I think I think it's probably both
[59:52.770 --> 59:54.050]  um
[59:54.050 --> 59:55.410]  but
[59:55.410 --> 59:57.410]  but yeah, I mean, you know people need to
[59:59.330 --> 01:00:04.690]  Label things as they got them. That's a huge pet peeve of mine when things get mixed up. So
[01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.450]  You know i've received some fake cuts before
[01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.530]  uh
[01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:13.410]  And it's always very frustrating because there's so much time
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.730]  involved obviously growing the plant and to figure out it's not the real deal, but
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:20.290]  um
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.850]  You know, I noticed that the uh synthetic
[01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:27.970]  Growers, um will often have a similar situation compared to you know
[01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:33.970]  The living soils people where you're just not getting those expressions. It's flat and you know, it doesn't smoke the same way
[01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.050]  It doesn't taste the same way
[01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:39.350]  So I think that probably is a big part of what you're you're experiencing
[01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.090]  Yeah, I I I agree and
[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:47.190]  So I think brian, I don't know like there might just need to be some education
[01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.810]  with the cultivators of
[01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.790]  You know, I mean i've seen even here in colorado
[01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:57.090]  A lot of people grow really really good weed
[01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:02.130]  and then by you know, somewhere between the time the weed gets chopped and
[01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:03.890]  It goes
[01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.890]  into your lungs
[01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.090]  It's abused and mistreated and loses
[01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.770]  um on on every level of quality, so
[01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:20.370]  Um, I think a big part of it is processing I think a big part of it is what layton pointed out the you know
[01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.570]  uh synthetics versus organics and
[01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:26.530]  even more nuanced than that, I mean there's
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:33.890]  You know, i've smoked some synthetic flower that has really nice aroma complexes and then we've all had synthetic flower that
[01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:35.970]  um
[01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:37.970]  Really just kind of sucks. So
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.170]  um
[01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:45.430]  So there you know, there's so many variables but I do think a big part of it is is the growing and processing
[01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.050]  to really bring out
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.290]  Uh all those traits from from each clone
[01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:58.930]  I feel like the big commercial farms. I personally hear them say a lot. Um, you know once it once it leaves my facility
[01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.410]  I just I don't really worry about it anymore
[01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:05.650]  and I when I hear that on the inside I cringe because I I would feel like as
[01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:08.130]  The producer of that that's kind of like
[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:13.730]  Your brand, you know, you're putting your name on that kind of stuff and there are a lot of commercial farmers
[01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:18.930]  Especially the bigger farm bigger scale farmers that do seed and have that mentality that once it leaves
[01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:23.490]  Uh, at least the the grow part of the operation, uh, they don't worry about it anymore
[01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:30.370]  Right, right. Yeah, I mean I you know, I if I was a producer I would probably want
[01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:33.570]  To take it all the way down to you know
[01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:39.730]  Getting it packaged with your brand on it just for that reason because I mean if you want to protect your name, um
[01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:46.290]  You know people bounce jars around they shake shake them to get the smell and you know, you're losing
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.010]  trichomes and resin and
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:53.090]  Um, just degrading that weed every time it's handled every time it's touched
[01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.970]  Every time it's moved. So, um
[01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.770]  So, yeah, that's a that's a big part of it for sure
[01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:06.850]  Another one that I I feel like you had a a real a review of was the skunk one skunk number one
[01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.850]  Can we kind of uh review that?
[01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:13.970]  Sure. Yeah, you know, I I hate to say uh, that one catches me off guard a little bit. I don't
[01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:16.930]  You know, i've smoked a number of skunk one
[01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:20.770]  Uh samples over the years. Um, i've smoked it
[01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.650]  I've smoked it
[01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:30.630]  By unknown growers in the states i've smoked it by known growers in the states i've smoked it in amsterdam
[01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.530]  um
[01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.650]  So I feel like i've got a pretty good feel for that strain. Um
[01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:39.330]  I'd say it's consistently really dense
[01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.150]  a really nice flower formation
[01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.170]  good resin content
[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.530]  um
[01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.090]  You know the the aroma isn't my thing
[01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.170]  Exactly. It's
[01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:53.170]  To me, it's kind of that generic-y
[01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:55.970]  sort of amsterdam style
[01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:58.290]  um of like sweet
[01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:04.610]  There's some skunk in it for sure, but it's not uh, it's definitely not like the roadkill skunk, you know that
[01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:07.650]  Most guys are talking about these days. Um
[01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:15.250]  But but yeah, I mean it's uh, it's nice flower. There's certainly nothing wrong with it. Uh for me, it's just
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:22.370]  You know, nothing stands out, uh, particularly in in an amazing way for me. Um
[01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:29.970]  But I mean it's it's a breeding block, uh, almost like northern whites, you know, it's in almost everything
[01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:36.770]  That we're smoking today. Um, I think a big part of that is the resin, uh the color, you know
[01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:41.410]  It can have really beautiful color. Um, and and the bud formation as well
[01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.290]  Just really nice structure
[01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.130]  so
[01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:49.970]  Was there was there a specific uh part of the skunk one that you were curious about brian or?
[01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:54.610]  No, I was just uh, I was wanting to kind of let people see like how you you know
[01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:59.410]  Just I feel like how reviews should be of cannabis like how you kind of kick this off where people are like yo
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.370]  This is fire. This is dank and then it's like okay great
[01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:07.890]  Um, but you know, you're taking it to the next level and I feel like you're articulating it so that people can understand what you're saying
[01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:08.850]  so like
[01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:13.030]  Uh for for me again in colorado, you know, there's a lot of people from california. So the sfv
[01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:19.430]  Uh, you want to break that one down because that was something for us that did really well for a long time the golden goat
[01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:22.310]  The blue dreams. I mean some of these ones that you're talking about today
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:28.150]  We're definitely staples in our garden and for for reasons, uh that I feel like, you know, you're explaining today
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:33.830]  I would say for the most part I didn't I never had the real cut of blue dreams or I never had the real cut of
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.910]  gg4
[01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:37.910]  Uh back in the day. I was sure
[01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:40.950]  You know one of those guys pushing stuff that I thought was real
[01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:45.830]  Sure, yeah, right. That's pretty funny. Yeah. Um
[01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:50.470]  Yeah, I mean, you know people I think need uh
[01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:54.710]  I'm, not i'm not sure if it's practice or what but um
[01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.350]  You know what I do when I sit down
[01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.870]  To be able to articulate all these things. I mean it it really does take some effort, you know
[01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:06.390]  I mean it's not like I sit down with a bud once
[01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.310]  And pop the jar and then write a whole review
[01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.070]  um
[01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.550]  Because I you know, I I really can't flesh out
[01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:18.310]  That much just about that little experience. So
[01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:20.550]  so I like to
[01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:25.670]  You know, i'll write a review after weeks of smoking something taking notes
[01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:27.430]  um
[01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:32.150]  you know every time I smoke it i'll take notes on the smell the taste the effects and
[01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:38.230]  You'll have different things pop at different times, you know, if it's maybe it's a little warmer day out
[01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:43.910]  You've got different turps that are volatizing and you pop the jar and you're going to notice notes
[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:45.910]  um that you don't
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:49.110]  Don't notice maybe when you're inside your air-conditioned house
[01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.150]  you know if you're
[01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:56.230]  If you eat like a consistent diet, you you might be
[01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.910]  uh
[01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.910]  kind of excluding certain
[01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.550]  Aromas or not noticing them
[01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.070]  because you're conditioned, you know to certain things and then
[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:12.470]  You go have this with your buddy or whatever and you know, they're like, oh dude it smells exactly like
[01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:15.670]  you know apples or whatever and
[01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:21.110]  All of a sudden it clicks and you're like dude. I didn't even notice that but this totally you know, that's what it is
[01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:22.950]  It's apples. Um
[01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.230]  so
[01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.390]  You know, I mean really to get to know
[01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:30.230]  These strains well enough, um to be able to write a review
[01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:35.690]  I do you usually have like an extended experience with the strain in different contexts
[01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:39.590]  To really see what's consistent about it
[01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:46.870]  What only comes out at certain times you'll find you know things that are really unique about it like
[01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:48.630]  um
[01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:53.670]  Like there's some limepop kush sky jarrow that's on my blog. Um that
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.510]  Uh, I I recently took out a jar from my freezer
[01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:00.470]  um to smoke and
[01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:05.270]  I mean, that's that weed i've i've just recently noticed this but it's like
[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:10.310]  I'm, so forgetful on that bud. It's unbelievable and I
[01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:13.990]  You know, I can't smoke that particular strain
[01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:15.910]  um
[01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:18.310]  At any other time other than right before bed
[01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:25.110]  Uh, unless I want to you know, i'll end up losing things not getting things done. Um, just kind of being a general
[01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:33.190]  uh, probably not as good person to like the people around me because you know, you're just like not as considerate not as uh, mindful of
[01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:36.710]  how you're affecting everybody and how things are going and
[01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:42.070]  You know, I mean I I just went camping and I was smoking that weed and I lost like three or four different things
[01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:44.070]  like I never lose anything like
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.350]  um
[01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:49.190]  You know that that's something that you smoke at once and you might just say. Oh, yeah
[01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:51.750]  You know, I was really stoned like sure I forgot something
[01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:58.790]  But when you smoke it like 10 times and then every time you're like super spaced out, um,
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.510]  Right. That's when you know. Oh
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:04.230]  That strain will do that every time
[01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:06.070]  um
[01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:09.590]  So, you know to be able to articulate all these different things
[01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:11.350]  uh
[01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:14.630]  I mean part of that is you know, there is a lot of effort involved like
[01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:19.350]  um, really noting what's unique about the experience and and um,
[01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.510]  And keeping track of that over time as well, so
[01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:31.110]  Well, you're definitely helping quickly. Were you just talking about the lime one jar? Oh, uh, lime pop kush
[01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:34.150]  Okay. Yep
[01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:35.510]  Yeah
[01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:37.510]  And real quick. Did you want to break down the sfv?
[01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:42.470]  Oh, yeah, we can do that. That is one of my favorite ogs of all time
[01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.190]  So I definitely feel like that is one of the classics
[01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:48.950]  There's even a place in colorado called shanahan's where I would smoke that out out
[01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:53.110]  At front and then lawyers and doctors would come over and be like, hey, can I hit that real quick?
[01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.670]  You know, so you knew it was something special
[01:09:56.230 --> 01:10:01.350]  Totally man. No, that's uh, it's a really special cut. I mean one of one of my favorite ogs for sure
[01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:03.430]  um
[01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:09.110]  Debatably, you know, I guess the ghost and triangle but to to me the ghost triangle and sfv
[01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:13.990]  I mean that's like the holy trinity of of uh og cuts right there. Um
[01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:16.070]  I think the the san fernando
[01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:22.310]  Might be my favorite because um what i've noticed about that one is with the effect
[01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:28.950]  Um, you know, it does have the characteristic og stone. It's very potent
[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:32.950]  Gets you very high like it's a very strong head effect, but
[01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:36.950]  Not like a classic sativa by any means. Um
[01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:42.390]  And you know long lasting all that stuff like every ever almost everyone loves og right?
[01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:48.650]  And but the san fernando has this kind of added dimension, I think to it where it is really euphoric
[01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:52.550]  And it makes me like really giggly and happy
[01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.870]  and
[01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:56.870]  Just like really friendly. Um
[01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:04.150]  So, you know that one to me like is a perfect one for like, oh you're going camping with friends and stuff like
[01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:10.390]  Very relaxing very happy, you know, you're real smiley just easygoing
[01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:16.310]  You know, it kind of puts you on island time, um, it's just like life is good bud, um
[01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.550]  And the you know the flavor, uh
[01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:26.470]  It's definitely the og sour fuel. I might I might have to look at my blog to see you know
[01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:28.470]  Exactly how it's nuanced. I'm not sure
[01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:33.430]  If i've got it on memory, but I know that I know the san fernando is a little bit more citrusy
[01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:38.390]  Than most og um, like a lot of those cuts come off of the og
[01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:41.290]  Like a lot of those cuts come off very astringent
[01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:45.430]  very uh, like kind of aggressive, um
[01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:51.990]  And the san fernando is almost toned back a little bit with that citrus. It like brightens things up. It's not the
[01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:58.070]  Not the lemon pine sol as much it is as it is like a lemon slice kind of thing
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.070]  um
[01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:06.650]  And you know, I mean i've even had uh, some samples of san fernando that maybe even had like a tiny bit of orange
[01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:08.730]  Um
[01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:14.250]  In there, you know instead of lemon, but but yeah, no, it's it's a really amazing cut. Um,
[01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.970]  I love just about everything about it
[01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:20.650]  uh as far as the consumer standpoint, so
[01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.330]  um
[01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:26.890]  Yeah, one of one of the best it's just got that classic kind of california like
[01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.210]  sweet skunky
[01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:32.490]  Smell, you know when you walk down the beach in california and you get that like
[01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.450]  sweet skunk hit in the face, um
[01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:38.890]  The san fernando comes to mind when I think about that
[01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:41.210]  Yeah, absolutely
[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:43.450]  and I feel like that's why when people walk by and they
[01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:47.530]  They smell that they they do go out of their way to kind of like, oh, hey, can I?
[01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:52.330]  You know, it kind of takes you back. It's definitely one of those nostalgia kind of smells
[01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:56.650]  Right, you smell it and it doesn't smell, you know, like maybe a skunk one
[01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:01.930]  you might smell that burning and it smells like, you know, whatever weed you smell the san fernando and it's
[01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.650]  You're like, oh dude, that's biting
[01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:06.570]  Yeah
[01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:08.570]  Let me get a taste. Yeah
[01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:12.650]  Uh, another one that I feel like is definitely
[01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:19.050]  Got a lot of bike to the fake cuts running around for the last few years is your review of the mac one the caps cut
[01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:23.930]  uh, you know, let's kind of talk deeper into that because I do feel like that's another one where
[01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:28.810]  You know, I don't know the percentages but it feels like nine out of ten of them have got to be fake
[01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:33.130]  I think so. I think there's probably quite a few fake ones
[01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:35.690]  Um, I think that always happens, you know when
[01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:38.890]  When a cut is really high value
[01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:45.930]  Uh, because then people right they take clones of whatever they have on hand and it's a little money grab
[01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.770]  You know, they can go tell you or go tell anybody that it's mac one
[01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:54.730]  Um and make way more money from those clones than they would have otherwise
[01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:57.290]  Um
[01:13:57.290 --> 01:14:03.050]  But yeah, I I think i've seen a lot of mac one over the last couple years and it's been
[01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:07.070]  You know, I mean it varies a lot in quality
[01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:13.370]  And its traits, um, but I I will say like after i've seen
[01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:16.010]  all these different samples, I think
[01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:20.090]  One thing I notice about the real deal. It's always really dense
[01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:25.850]  It has that furry look to it like it's so crystally it almost looks like fur
[01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.730]  Like white fur or something
[01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:32.330]  And it you know, the buds are just like completely wrapped in it
[01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:35.450]  You get the purple accents a lot
[01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:38.090]  and the smell is
[01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:43.770]  Like I get like, uh, some samples are like sour milk. Other ones are more like condensed milk
[01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.250]  But I definitely get like a milky
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:48.570]  um chalky
[01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:55.770]  Like almost like sidewalk chalk and like sour condensed milk or something. Um, that's what I think about when I when I hear mac one
[01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:57.770]  um
[01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:59.930]  and I mean beautiful strain I just I
[01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:04.890]  There's not a whole lot of mac one that I I really enjoy that effect
[01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:06.410]  um
[01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:12.250]  You know where I can really talk about how much I love the san fernando like I don't really feel that way about the mac one
[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:14.390]  personally
[01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:21.270]  I don't know. Well, that's what I that's what I like about you man is, you know, you're just you're just critiquing what it is
[01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:27.750]  Right. There's no favorites. There's no um, hey because this guy has this many followers. I better say that I like his stuff
[01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:31.590]  you're just critiquing it in the way that the way that you like it and obviously it's
[01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.790]  it's your perspective on stuff, but I just feel like you know, you
[01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:41.910]  You opened up my eyes when I first learned about you to truly understand stuff and um, and really understand genetics. Um,
[01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:48.070]  On a different level, you know, I feel like for a lot of us we were all trying to figure this out. Um,
[01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:53.750]  You know going from the forums and now to like youtube and digital media and stuff like that
[01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:56.150]  so I really appreciate you breaking all this stuff down because
[01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.550]  to sit there and read forums and to see
[01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:03.110]  Everybody's opinion on stuff and I feel like if you don't especially back in the day on forums
[01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:07.750]  If you didn't read all of that forum, there might be somebody at the bottom that was like, yo, that guy's trash
[01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:09.990]  I don't even know why he's saying that but you left it at like
[01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:13.590]  Um, these genetics are fantastic and you went out and grew them
[01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.470]  I feel like there was a lot of hype especially when you would get uh,
[01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:18.950]  Like t-shirt genetics is what we called it, you know
[01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:23.110]  We grew them out and the t-shirt was more valuable than the genetics that we got
[01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.190]  Yeah, so that was you know
[01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:27.190]  Those were the days that I feel like
[01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:31.670]  a lot of I feel like an old man saying that I guess but those were the days that a lot of you guys will
[01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:32.950]  never have to
[01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:37.590]  Experience or the the downtime of growing garbage genetics and figuring it out
[01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:41.190]  As a group or figuring out that you had fake cuts
[01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:47.190]  Right. Yeah. I mean, yeah, most people, you know, don't have to even go through the trouble of getting cuts now
[01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:53.750]  I mean seeds are sort of prolific and you can buy them with a credit card online now, you know, I mean there's websites where
[01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:58.310]  You can buy them like anything else. Um, which is really incredible
[01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.750]  um, but
[01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:05.910]  Yeah, you know, I I think part of what um
[01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:11.030]  Part of what i'm doing or trying to do with my blog is is almost like open up to people
[01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:16.310]  This way that they could be experiencing cannabis or um
[01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:20.230]  You know, I mean for for me it's just
[01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:23.350]  Enjoying weed the way that I enjoy it like
[01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:30.390]  Really savoring every aspect of the flower or the hash or whatever you're, you know, experiencing
[01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:35.510]  If you have never done that, I mean it's it's just if you have a really exquisite flower
[01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:41.270]  I think that's how it it really should be enjoyed like there's so much to that experience
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.670]  and you can get so much out of it and
[01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.550]  you know, it's almost like um
[01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.750]  you know the first time you go to a
[01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.790]  one of these like restaurants that does like a
[01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:55.590]  You know if you guys have been like i've
[01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.990]  There's a spot in Baltimore
[01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:59.990]  Right and
[01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.990]  It is
[01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:04.710]  uh, you know, I mean like normally, you know, i'd like
[01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:08.150]  I think this is a ridiculous experience, you know who needs to
[01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.750]  Go pay way too much money for dinner and and have this
[01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.990]  um
[01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:16.390]  Just over the top, you know who needs 13 courses, but
[01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:23.910]  It's an incredible experience because they take these everyday ingredients and every course and they take them
[01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:28.550]  And they make them into a meal and they make them into a meal and they make them into a meal
[01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:36.950]  And it's just it's such a unique experience because they take these everyday ingredients and every course is like
[01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:39.830]  a totally unique
[01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:44.870]  Experience unto itself that you will never have again
[01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:50.150]  You'll never have an experience like that unless you're going to these places all the time, but you know, it's so unique
[01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:52.230]  It's so enjoyable. It's so
[01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:54.370]  Unique, and it's like
[01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:57.190]  It's just it's like
[01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:59.430]  You know you're looking at food
[01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:02.130]  Differently than you did when you went in there
[01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:06.390]  You know seeing what's possible with food. Um
[01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:08.390]  seeing
[01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:14.870]  You know food through the chef's eyes this guy who's a genuine artist with it
[01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:19.510]  I mean, I I think that that's kind of the same maybe what i'm trying to do with weed
[01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:26.230]  to be able to enjoy it in these ways that you really can't have.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:30.190]  You know, some of the experiences that I write about on my blog, you're never going to get
[01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:35.790]  that from weed that you buy at a dispensary, at least in Colorado.
[01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:41.070]  You know, maybe there's some really good weed elsewhere in the country, but I think if you
[01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:47.790]  go buy commercially grown weed in Colorado, you know, it's like getting a burger from
[01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:48.790]  McDonald's or whatever.
[01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:51.470]  It's, you know, you know what you're going to get.
[01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:54.270]  It's going to do the job and all that stuff.
[01:19:54.270 --> 01:20:03.070]  But there are experiences to be had in cannabis that probably a lot of smokers don't even
[01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.070]  know exist.
[01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:10.510]  You know, just some of the complexities in the turf profiles, some of the flavors that
[01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:17.130]  you can get, some of the effects even from some of these really unique, unique genetics.
[01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:22.730]  So I think, you know, maybe that's kind of what I'm trying to do is I really love having
[01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:26.250]  that elevated experience.
[01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:34.570]  And I'm always pursuing that with cannabis, trying to get that experience or those really,
[01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:39.530]  you know, the highs of the highs, I guess.
[01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:44.970]  And yeah, just kind of illustrating to people like, you could do this too.
[01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:50.290]  And you should because then I can come smoke your weed and enjoy it.
[01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:55.570]  So I think the world would be better off with, you know, tons of really, really exceptional
[01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:56.570]  weed.
[01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:01.290]  And I do want to highlight, this is just kind of our opinions, obviously, but most of this
[01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.250]  is coming from living soil farms.
[01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:06.890]  Am I correct on saying that for you?
[01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:07.890]  Yes.
[01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:16.290]  Everything on my blog is either grown by me in living soil or by somebody I know that,
[01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:21.250]  you know, I know them really well and like have seen their garden operations and know
[01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.810]  all of it to be organic.
[01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:29.450]  And all, you know, I always put in each review, I'll say, you know, who this was grown by,
[01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:33.890]  who it was bred by, how it was grown, all that stuff.
[01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:37.850]  So I try to be, you know, as transparent as possible.
[01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:44.250]  But yeah, you know, I mean, Leighton mentioned that earlier that, you know, I mean, synthetics,
[01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:47.650]  there can be great synthetic bud.
[01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:53.330]  I just, I've never had the experience of having a side by side.
[01:21:53.330 --> 01:22:01.890]  Like if someone grows really nice synthetic bud and then gives me the clone, obviously,
[01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:07.610]  I'm biased, but I know that I'm going to enjoy my experience more with my homegrown
[01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:13.210]  organic flower than the flower from their synthetic garden.
[01:22:13.210 --> 01:22:19.450]  It's just, it's always more nuanced in the aroma, always more nuanced in the flavor.
[01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:21.730]  There's just so much there in living soil.
[01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:26.490]  It really gets the plant to express everything.
[01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:33.410]  Because I think, you know, with synthetics, you don't have the same diversity of inputs.
[01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:37.650]  And so I think that you're probably not going to have the same diversity of outputs.
[01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:43.690]  You know, if you're not getting all these obscure micronutrients that are produced by
[01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:50.010]  organisms in the soil, you know, the plant might not be able to metabolize certain cannabinoids
[01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:54.650]  or certain terpenes that they might be able to otherwise.
[01:22:54.810 --> 01:23:01.850]  I've had the displeasure of smoking synthetic versus living soil.
[01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:03.970]  And it's just, I mean, I can't even smoke the shit.
[01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:07.290]  It burns the back of my throat and it tastes like crap.
[01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:08.730]  So what's the point of it?
[01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:14.570]  You know, I mean, I still don't understand why the industry as a whole hasn't moved
[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:16.970]  toward living soils and gotten away from the synthetics.
[01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:21.290]  I mean, you can save money, which is the craziest part about it.
[01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:23.210]  You know, it's a commitment out of the gate.
[01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:26.450]  But once you do that commitment, you're not replacing your soil.
[01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:28.210]  You're not buying newts.
[01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:33.210]  You know, you may put some amendments in there or you may periodically do an uptick of some
[01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:38.530]  biology, but it's not nearly as expensive as a method to growing.
[01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:41.810]  And the expression from the plant is night and fucking day.
[01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:46.810]  Like you said, I mean, those little minor cannabinoids and those expressions really
[01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:49.570]  come through in a living soil system.
[01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.650]  And you can't replicate that with synthetics.
[01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:53.650]  You just can't.
[01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:59.410]  So, you know, and big ups to you because, you know, hopefully people, the listeners
[01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:03.450]  and the audience will, you know, have the opportunity to read your blog and hear more
[01:24:03.450 --> 01:24:10.330]  about it because like you said, I mean, there's so much more to understanding these nuances
[01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:14.370]  that are coming off of this plant that you don't even know about.
[01:24:14.370 --> 01:24:20.090]  You know, like, you know, some of those one to ones are wonderful daytime smokers or even,
[01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:22.810]  you know, three to ones or two to ones.
[01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:30.370]  I think they call them, what is it, C, the different cultivars or, you know, it's like
[01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:36.930]  type A, type B, and type C. And there are some wonderful ones out there that are highly
[01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:37.930]  enjoyable.
[01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:41.050]  So, you know, big ups and kudos to you for, you know, getting that kind of information
[01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:42.690]  out to the masses.
[01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:45.970]  Again, hopefully more people will tune in and see your work.
[01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.090]  And more people can see the real cuts.
[01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:52.370]  That's another thing that I want to highlight, you know, so if you're thinking about growing
[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:56.690]  something or you've spent a lot of money from someone or however it worked out, I feel
[01:24:56.690 --> 01:25:00.450]  like this is an excellent reference point to get the noses.
[01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:03.930]  You know, again, this is Jim's expression and his judge.
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:10.130]  But again, I put my stamp on it or whatever that I feel like you go out of your way to
[01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:13.850]  make sure that your review is tried and true in the way that you see it.
[01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:18.690]  And from what, you know, my limited experience of some of the genetics that you have, I know
[01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:22.570]  for a fact that as far as I understand, that's exactly what it looks like.
[01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:26.490]  So it's a nice reference point for people that want to start to grow the higher end
[01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:26.850]  stuff.
[01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:33.490]  Totally, yeah. You know, I've never even thought about it that way, but and it is
[01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:37.850]  subjective, obviously, to what I noticed personally.
[01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:46.090]  But yeah, I mean, it would be a nice reference if you're if you get past the Gorilla Glue
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:52.810]  or, you know, the Cherry Lime Pop or whatever, you know, grow it out and see, you know,
[01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:57.290]  take your own notes, see what you experience, go to your buddies, ask them what they
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:26:03.690]  smell, what they feel. And then, you know, then go find my blog, go find, you know, some
[01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:06.050]  notes on the forums guys might be talking about.
[01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:11.890]  You know, there's yeah, definitely you can use it, use it as a reference for that.
[01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:16.610]  But yeah, you know, again, I just I really think that.
[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:26.650]  A lot of people, probably most people just if you haven't experienced, you know,
[01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:33.210]  perfectly grown organic, just amazingly grown flower.
[01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:35.930]  There it really is a completely unique experience.
[01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:44.850]  Like, I think one toke can get you in a better state of mind than, you know, infinite
[01:26:44.850 --> 01:26:49.130]  amounts of whatever weed from the dispensary, you know.
[01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:56.970]  I just think there's a quality to the experience that you don't get anywhere else.
[01:26:57.010 --> 01:27:02.210]  So I strongly encourage people to seek that out, you know, grow a plant at home if you
[01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:07.490]  can. It's you know, if you have one plant and you can put all your focus into it.
[01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:12.170]  You know, a lot of people, I think, think that, oh, I can't do this like the
[01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:14.250]  professionals. I don't have this whole grow room like.
[01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:20.570]  You I've grown some incredible weed like when I was in college in the corner of my
[01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:24.730]  bedroom, you know, some really nice weed that I've grown.
[01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.730]  You know, some really nice weed that I'd be happy to smoke today.
[01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:34.690]  So, you know, people can people can have that experience.
[01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:41.130]  Kind of whatever situation they're in and there's probably if you're a cannabis
[01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:46.050]  enthusiast, you know, there there might be dimensions to cannabis that you're missing out
[01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:52.570]  on that, you know, are right around the corner that might just blow your mind and, you
[01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:55.090]  know, deepen your love for the plant even more.
[01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:55.570]  So.
[01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:58.610]  Yeah, that's some great advice.
[01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:01.210]  You know, they they do call it weed for a reason.
[01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:03.410]  It's really easy to grow.
[01:28:03.690 --> 01:28:08.810]  Now, if you're trying to push, you know, push production or push, you know, these minor
[01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:13.130]  cannabinoids, then yeah, there's definitely some art to it for sure.
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:16.210]  But nowadays we have the gear to do this.
[01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:21.850]  I mean, you've got products out there, you know, decent, solid biological products like
[01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:22.690]  fish brew.
[01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:28.330]  You've got, you know, Jeremy's Build A Soil Nude Packs, which, you know, again, are
[01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:29.610]  biologically friendly.
[01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:31.290]  They're not they're not easy.
[01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:33.610]  So you can do this.
[01:28:33.610 --> 01:28:38.290]  And, you know, like you said, you should people should try, you know, especially the,
[01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:42.650]  you know, the young kids where the states have opened up and they're 21 and they want to
[01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.450]  try. They should go for it.
[01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:49.130]  And, you know, like platforms like this are designed to help those guys from making
[01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:54.970]  missteps. And, you know, earlier, Brian stated about, you know, our focus was on the tech
[01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:59.010]  behind it. You know, all the I had a Growtron, I forget the name of it.
[01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:03.210]  It was this bubble that you grew the plants in.
[01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:05.490]  And it was a joke.
[01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.290]  You know, it was like expensive.
[01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:08.650]  And back in the 80s.
[01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:10.090]  Yeah. What was that thing called?
[01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:12.570]  Come on. John Walsh had the same one.
[01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:13.970]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:15.890]  What was that? What was the name of that thing?
[01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:23.050]  Anyway, and not focus on the genetics and the genetics are really the key to the whole
[01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:27.570]  thing. And nowadays, at least there's a lot more stable places to buy it.
[01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:33.330]  And we were kids. We ordered seeds from Amsterdam and you just prayed they showed up, you
[01:29:33.330 --> 01:29:38.570]  know, and they were actually grew because a lot of times they didn't.
[01:29:38.650 --> 01:29:44.810]  And but nowadays, you know, with with social media and platforms like Instagram, it's very
[01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:51.570]  easy to find decent breeders and find strains or cultivars, I should say, that are in
[01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:57.330]  your palate. And again, thanks to you for putting out the reviews so that people can
[01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:00.570]  understand what they're looking for or what it really looks like.
[01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:06.370]  So it's a complete package that didn't exist, you know, 10 years ago, literally.
[01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:14.490]  But now here we are in this open society and the plants less demonized and more people
[01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:20.090]  are willing to try it. And, you know, again, I think that the biggest problem we have as a
[01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:22.290]  society is the dispensary.
[01:30:22.770 --> 01:30:28.250]  First of all, I know so many people that have gone in there and been given the wrong
[01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:33.130]  recommendation on on what to try to smoke or medicine to take.
[01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:39.170]  You know, one of Pauline's clients like literally had a, you know, almost a complete panic
[01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:45.650]  attack and convulsions because they gave her an RSO that was too strong and a dosing that
[01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.890]  was way too high for what she needed.
[01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:54.370]  So, you know, big ups to Greenflower Media for putting together the Gangier and hopefully
[01:30:55.250 --> 01:31:00.730]  more dispensaries will bring in people that have knowledge and not just there for a
[01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:06.610]  paycheck to prevent stuff like that from happening and hopefully educate more about the
[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:12.290]  future of living soils and organically grown flower and not just buy this mids that are
[01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:14.650]  coming out of these chemical factories.
[01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:16.330]  Right, right.
[01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:19.970]  And, you know, I think, you know, people who.
[01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:27.650]  You know, I think when people have access to that really high quality stuff as opposed to the
[01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:32.450]  mids, it kind of deepens their passion for the whole for cannabis as well.
[01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:40.130]  You know, it's kind of a self-feeding thing where you have such an awesome experience that
[01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:44.810]  you fall in love with this and you want to pursue it even deeper and, you know, it just kind of
[01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:46.050]  builds up into this thing.
[01:31:47.690 --> 01:31:51.690]  So, you know, I mean, part of the reason that people aren't as passionate or knowledgeable as
[01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:56.330]  they might be is maybe that's not been ignited because, you know, they're only experiencing
[01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:57.250]  mids. So.
[01:31:57.290 --> 01:32:03.010]  So I hate to beat the dead horse, but people should should pursue this, you know,
[01:32:03.010 --> 01:32:09.210]  experience of excellent cannabis, I think, because there really is something a lot deeper
[01:32:09.210 --> 01:32:14.450]  there than, you know, just smoking a pre-roll from your dispensary or getting high or
[01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:15.290]  whatever. So.
[01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:18.930]  Those pre-rolls are trim anyway.
[01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:20.530]  Yeah, you're a flower.
[01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:25.850]  It's the difference between, you know, a medicinal approach versus a McDonald's for
[01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:28.130]  lack of better words. Yeah.
[01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:28.650]  Yeah.
[01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:32.290]  You know, they'll find a huge difference.
[01:32:32.810 --> 01:32:35.450]  Huge difference. What you got there, Brian?
[01:32:35.490 --> 01:32:36.330]  Doing a little burning.
[01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:37.530]  Oh, yeah.
[01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.410]  Quick shout out to K&F Gardens.
[01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:45.210]  Shout out to Hide the Hippie, keeping me super stoned so that I can mumble at the end of
[01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:46.130]  this, like always.
[01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.330]  With your eyes half shut.
[01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:51.210]  Look at that dude in the corner.
[01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:57.090]  But I appreciate, you know, this has really become quite the fun thing for Thursday's, man.
[01:32:57.090 --> 01:33:01.370]  And I, you know, I know that it was all kind of sad this the beginning of this week and
[01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:05.530]  stuff. But I do feel like being on social media and seeing Instagram, it was really cool to
[01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:09.250]  see how many people Frenchie has influenced.
[01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:14.130]  So, you know, I just I just hope that his his legacy lives on, like you had mentioned
[01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:19.210]  through the Ganja Eater and just all the videos and all the just, you know, we asked him
[01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:24.170]  even when we put together an event in Denver, he came through and, you know, gave a like
[01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:25.490]  a little talk and stuff like that.
[01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:28.090]  So there was just there's always a giving individual.
[01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:30.290]  And that's something that I feel like the community is going to miss.
[01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:35.410]  But hopefully these kind of platforms and stuff can live on where we continue educating
[01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:36.490]  and educating for free.
[01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:40.010]  I'm into that, brother.
[01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:46.090]  I'm into that. Yeah, Frenchie has tons, tons of material out there and he has.
[01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.610]  He's affected a lot of people in a really positive way.
[01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:51.890]  He's definitely a beacon.
[01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:54.090]  And all three as well.
[01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:57.210]  You know, I mean, he's all that material he's got out there.
[01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:01.570]  I mean, he just put it out and just just to get the information out there.
[01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:05.050]  So I always think it's admirable and people do that.
[01:34:06.930 --> 01:34:07.770]  Right on, brother.
[01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:13.210]  Absolutely. So do you want to there's a couple more like the Panama Red Death, like a
[01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:14.330]  tip of the hat to Leighton.
[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:16.450]  You kind of want to chop that up, you two with.
[01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:21.970]  That's that's something that I do feel like secretly my grandfather would kind of like
[01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:26.410]  whisper about and stuff that I feel like I wasn't even really old enough that I feel
[01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:30.850]  like understanding what he was trying to hint at me until I until he passed away.
[01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:35.410]  But it does seem like the tie stick, the Panama Red for you, Leighton, and to other
[01:34:35.410 --> 01:34:38.970]  individuals like that were able to experience those.
[01:34:39.610 --> 01:34:45.050]  That was more of like the the pure the pure form of something that we I guess we now
[01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:46.130]  call like a land race.
[01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:48.890]  Yeah. And again, they were grown organically.
[01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:51.050]  They didn't have back then.
[01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:57.610]  You know, these were basically planted in the nature and watered and, you know, maybe
[01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:59.330]  put some manure on them.
[01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:02.810]  But my God, they were just beautiful smoke.
[01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:07.930]  I mean, the Panama was like dense, hard nuggets broke up and just expanded out in your
[01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:09.570]  bowl. Yeah.
[01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:12.890]  And the tie sticks, boy, talk about slit eyes.
[01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:14.890]  A couple of hits of that stuff.
[01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:16.130]  You couldn't even open your eyes.
[01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.810]  It's beautiful. So, yeah.
[01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:21.410]  Talk to us about some of the work you've done with the Reds.
[01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:26.570]  You know, I haven't done any work with with them.
[01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:31.970]  You know, exactly. But a buddy had passed me some flower.
[01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:36.410]  He he's one of the guys who has a really impressive genetic collection.
[01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:39.890]  You know, I haven't grown.
[01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:41.650]  I've grown a few clones from him.
[01:35:41.650 --> 01:35:44.930]  And for the most part, they've been pretty good.
[01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:48.210]  And he he gave me some flowers.
[01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:52.810]  Just pull it up on my end here real quick to make sure I don't screw it up.
[01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:58.330]  But he had given me a Panama Red Death and then I think it was crossed.
[01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:00.210]  There is Panama Red Death.
[01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:02.130]  Is that a cross of Panama and Mexican?
[01:36:02.530 --> 01:36:02.930]  So.
[01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:06.690]  That's Peter, maybe you can dig that up.
[01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:12.530]  You know, it's let me find it here.
[01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:18.010]  I'm just I'm you know, when you're talking about it, though, Leighton, when you think
[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:22.890]  about Panama Red Death, is that a pure Panama strain or is that a cross of Panamanian?
[01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:24.770]  You know, I don't know.
[01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:32.010]  All I know is that we would get this just dark red bud that they called, you know,
[01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:34.050]  that came from Panama.
[01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:36.890]  We just called it Panama Red.
[01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.730]  So I you know, this was this was back in the 70s, dude.
[01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:43.530]  So, you know, who knows what it really was?
[01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:47.650]  But whenever it came to town, man, we were all about it.
[01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:49.290]  It was the it was the go to.
[01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:54.930]  OK, so so I did find it on my blog, it's.
[01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:59.570]  Wonder made me do it is indoor run.
[01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:05.730]  And, you know, I'm not sure, you know, his flower looks almost like a classic haze and
[01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:08.570]  it smelled about like that as well.
[01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:11.810]  It was very sweet, had some cedar in it.
[01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:12.690]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:16.090]  So the stuff we had was all red.
[01:37:16.210 --> 01:37:21.410]  I mean, it was just dark brown red, but more red than brown.
[01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:22.490]  And I don't know.
[01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:25.170]  You know, again, this was, you know, eons ago.
[01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:28.170]  I've never seen it.
[01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:32.210]  You know, I mean, it came around probably four or five years in a row.
[01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:39.250]  It would come in in the late summer and, you know, we would be all about it.
[01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:41.050]  And we just called it Panama Red.
[01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:42.530]  So but it was not green.
[01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:45.330]  I mean, it was literally brownish, dark red.
[01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:47.890]  Well, I'll tell you about it.
[01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:50.850]  Well, that's I mean, that's another one.
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:52.850]  I just I think there's so many of those.
[01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:57.970]  You know, land race varieties that you know, that's what I'm talking.
[01:37:58.810 --> 01:37:59.210]  Wow.
[01:38:01.730 --> 01:38:06.210]  Yeah, you know, I mean, there's there's so many of those varieties that.
[01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:10.850]  I've been personally bummed out by a lot of land race seeds,
[01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:15.810]  just for that reason, you know, guys like you, Leighton, talk about the tie stick.
[01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:20.370]  And every time I think I've, you know, ran some tie stick seeds or something,
[01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:24.890]  they're just never, never much to write home about.
[01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:31.210]  So I'm not sure if that's a product of, you know, taking the seed from one part of the world
[01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:35.530]  and growing it in an indoor room and just not performing due to environment
[01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:40.450]  or if those genetics have been lost or, you know, what's the case?
[01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:46.890]  But I think that, you know, that's probably sadly the case with Panama Red Death and some tie stick.
[01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:54.290]  It's probably pretty tough to find, you know, something that really resembles your experience from that era.
[01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:00.290]  Yeah, you know, and look, I think that you hit the nail on the head.
[01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:04.130]  The taro lob has a big to do, a big important piece of it.
[01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:11.850]  And maybe that expression is from, you know, the altitude or the humidity or whatever.
[01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:15.970]  And I know, you know, other people have said the same thing about, you know, the land race.
[01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:22.330]  And who knows whether those land race seeds are actually truly, you know, from a land race?
[01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:25.130]  You know, you just don't know unless you're collecting them yourself.
[01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:29.890]  Right. You know where they came from and where they were.
[01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:35.570]  They, you know, a genetic that has had drift, you know, because of repeated inbreeding.
[01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:37.450]  So it's just it's hard to say.
[01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:43.770]  And, you know, again, I have those wonderful, fond memories of being a kid and having some of these incredible
[01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:46.570]  smokes that I've never been able to find again.
[01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:50.290]  And but hopefully there are people people work on it.
[01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:58.610]  I mean, you got to believe that the that, you know, through proper breeding, some of those expressions can come back out.
[01:39:58.610 --> 01:40:03.730]  And I know, you know, like some people have had some great success and others have have not.
[01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:10.490]  You know, and I know like what's his name?
[01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:18.690]  Javan Jodri has, you know, has been able to bring back certain strains from near death experience.
[01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:24.490]  And, you know, with the earth box that Alan Atkins has put together.
[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:32.890]  So hopefully, you know, people do find their fathers or grandfathers seed that, you know, that they got in the bag and pop it.
[01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:42.010]  And hopefully some of this magic comes back into our our, you know, our presence again, because it was those were some wonderful, wonderful cultivars for sure.
[01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:49.010]  Well, I do think, you know, as we see increased legalization, it could go one of two ways.
[01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:57.810]  And one is, you know, we might end up with the equivalent of beefsteak tomatoes everywhere where there's very midsy weed everywhere.
[01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:11.170]  But the other one is that as things open up, you know, we'll start seeing people growing these different strains in all different environments and then processing them differently.
[01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:17.170]  And I think because of all those variables, there's going to be a lot of diversity of product.
[01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:19.170]  The more things open up.
[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:29.170]  And I think, you know, we might end up seeing flowers like the ones that you remember and experiences like those kind of resurface.
[01:41:30.170 --> 01:41:42.170]  You know, that all that stuff is kind of dormant in a sense in the gene pool and just kind of has to come out, you know, given given proper environment and processing.
[01:41:42.170 --> 01:41:49.170]  You know, I noticed everyone in the comments kind of mentioning that a lot of the color was due to the processing and that kind of thing.
[01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:53.170]  I mean, I you know, if you look at tea, it's kind of a parallel.
[01:41:53.170 --> 01:42:05.170]  There's a million ways to process tea leaves and you can have the exact same tea plant grown in, you know, different environments and then process differently.
[01:42:05.170 --> 01:42:08.170]  And it can be a totally different drinking experience.
[01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:19.170]  I think the more that the cannabis becomes legalized and normalized and, you know, the production really builds all over the world.
[01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:30.170]  Really, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of these unique, unique processing methods and really unique end products kind of start to come back out.
[01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:33.170]  You know, I think you're right.
[01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:47.170]  You know, Kevin was talking to me about curing rooms and actually using like like a wood room, kind of like they did with a tobacco over in Connecticut.
[01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:50.170]  Back in the day, you saw those tobacco sheds for drying.
[01:42:50.170 --> 01:43:09.170]  And, you know, there's there's there's definitely something to it because, you know, you can tell the difference between blood that has been really cured well and with love and responsibility versus stuff that has just been like, you know, thrown in a bucket, burped periodically.
[01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:22.170]  So, you know, again, those these types of things may help, you know, bring out some of those minor expressions and perhaps, you know, the genetics that have drifted away from some of the past cultivars.
[01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:29.170]  But I hope I hope your first view of the future isn't the truth because you're right.
[01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:42.170]  I mean, it very well could be that because of all the breeding and without having some land race or some ultimate beginning genetics that we may end up just breeding, breeding all the good things out of it.
[01:43:42.170 --> 01:43:47.170]  But I don't know. I still think there's enough of you guys out there that are really doing the work.
[01:43:47.170 --> 01:43:49.170]  Me and Gene, big shout out to him.
[01:43:49.170 --> 01:44:06.170]  I remember at the last region conference that he was there on the breeders panel talking about one of the sifts that he did was and I believe it was like probably one of the biggest sifts ever done in Humboldt, where he visited so many farms and popped so many beans.
[01:44:06.170 --> 01:44:21.170]  And, you know, guys like that are out there really doing the work. And, you know, I think that for the most part, the plant is in a safe place as far as being responsibly taken care of with breeders like he and Michael Hinden was another one.
[01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:29.170]  And there's the list goes on. I mean, I can go on and on. Kaya, he's another one. They're really doing the work responsibly.
[01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:33.170]  Coming up with some badass stuff.
[01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:36.170]  And it's not all the same.
[01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:40.170]  And Layton, this is the thing that John Walsh had in his bedroom.
[01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:41.170]  That's it.
[01:44:41.170 --> 01:44:47.170]  That's a family reference. Someone who we both knew.
[01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:49.170]  In the 70s and 80s.
[01:44:49.170 --> 01:44:50.170]  Four stars, huh?
[01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:51.170]  Yeah.
[01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:52.170]  I gave it a four star rating.
[01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:56.170]  Oh, man, I had mine. Mine was more like purple color.
[01:44:56.170 --> 01:45:03.170]  You know, I think it might have had something to do with the lighting inside, too, because it was these weird like grow lights in there.
[01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:10.170]  And my plant would just push up against the sides of it. Like, you know, you see the guy with his face pasted to the glass.
[01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:14.170]  That's what my weed looked like when I grew it in that thing.
[01:45:14.170 --> 01:45:19.170]  I never did really grow great weed. I was much better planting it outside.
[01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:23.170]  But that was my winter stash, you know, because we couldn't grow all year long.
[01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:25.170]  It's not like here in SoCal.
[01:45:25.170 --> 01:45:28.170]  That's fun memories, for sure.
[01:45:31.170 --> 01:45:34.170]  What about one that nobody seems to want to grow anymore? A haze.
[01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:37.170]  The mango Nigerian haze.
[01:45:37.170 --> 01:45:41.170]  Man, yeah, that was another one that Wunder grew.
[01:45:41.170 --> 01:45:47.170]  And, you know, he's just got like a bunch of really cool sativas that he hangs on to.
[01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:58.170]  And, you know, I had grown back when I was doing the aeroponic thing, I had grown some Neville's haze and some moonshine haze.
[01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:01.170]  You know, some of those more classics.
[01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:06.170]  I've never grown the original haze, but, you know, the Neville's is pretty close.
[01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:15.170]  And those are, they used to be probably my all time favorite weed.
[01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:18.170]  They were just, you know, the best.
[01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:20.170]  Peter, you got something to show there?
[01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:23.170]  Yeah, I can't see it. What are you holding up?
[01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:25.170]  Some Dreamtime haze.
[01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:27.170]  Oh, look at that.
[01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.170]  Did you just grow that?
[01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:31.170]  How long did that take you?
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:41.700]  I squeezed it in at the beginning of the summer.
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:46.700]  So it was kind of like a late winter, early summer seeding it out.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.700]  So it was more for seeds.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:53.700]  Oh, you just grew that for seeds.
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.700]  Nice.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:59.700]  How is your pot working? Did you finally get that thing planted up?
[01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:04.700]  We are about to, well, I want to put something in there that's going to be full term.
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:10.700]  So I have a whole bunch of stuff I just popped recently.
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:15.700]  And then some of the stuff from Alex Hardy and Mr. Toad.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:20.700]  So I need a female to put in there because I don't want to kill a male.
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:24.700]  I will do grow diaries. I see that comment.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.700]  I just need to set up.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.700]  Currently it's at Tom's house.
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:34.700]  And I like squirrel away grows at different people's houses.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:38.700]  So since I'm not allowed to do it at home.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.700]  And that's where the big greenhouse is hopefully going to come into play
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:44.700]  where I can just go nuts.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:47.700]  But yes, some grow journals.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:49.700]  Have you talked to him more?
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:51.700]  Yeah, no.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.700]  I sent him an email a couple of days ago.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:57.700]  I was going to check in with him later today and give him a call.
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:00.700]  But basically I was like, I'm ready to start.
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:01.700]  Are you?
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:05.700]  Dude, I would love to have a space to grow because I can't grow anything.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:09.700]  Ryan, I signed a lease and I love my way.
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:10.700]  I want to piss her off.
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:11.700]  It is.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.700]  It is equidistant between the two of us.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:15.700]  Right.
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.700]  Yeah, we should.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:18.700]  It's in for anybody who's listening.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:22.700]  It's in Camarillo, which is on the north side of the state.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.700]  And Camarillo, which is on the 101,
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:29.700]  kind of at the heart of strawberry country in SoCal.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:32.700]  So it's a cool spot.
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.700]  Yeah, and Rodale's there too.
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:39.700]  My good friend Ariana, who we're doing some work with,
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.700]  which we'll probably chop it up about sometime in the near future.
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:44.700]  But right now it's still really cool.
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:48.700]  Yeah, I was going to mic her up and walk the hemp fields
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:53.700]  because she's growing for microgreens for restaurant salads.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:49:01.700]  So she's trying to figure out what at an early stage level could you pull
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:08.700]  and get the tastiest mixed greens to mix into your hipster salads
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:13.700]  with the kale and arugula and other leafy greens.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:19.700]  Well, as we all know, they will take the expressions on of things
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.700]  grown with them, like in polyculture.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:25.700]  I should remind her that she should be growing peppers right next to the
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:29.700]  greens because they will take on that heat and that flavor,
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.700]  the spiciness of the vegetables.
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:35.700]  Well, I told her I wanted to take over all the acreage next to the hemp
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:39.700]  because she has like four or five other acres.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.700]  And she's like, I don't have anyone to help out.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700]  So I was like, I'll help.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.700]  I know.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.700]  She's got a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:50.700]  Let's go wild.
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.700]  Take turns going up there, right?
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.700]  Anyway, we got off subject there a little bit.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.700]  Sorry, Brian.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.700]  No problem.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:03.700]  It's like you're reminiscing in the future, you know?
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:06.700]  Like you guys were bonding over something that happened back to the future
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.700]  style or something.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:08.700]  There you go.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:10.700]  So that'd be really cool if you guys were able to pull that off.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.700]  Yeah.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]  We were going to talk hazes.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:14.700]  So is that something that even, you know,
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.700]  to incorporate what you're just talking about?
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.700]  Do you guys think that's going to be something that's worthwhile for you
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.700]  guys to do?
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.700]  Man. I mean,
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:25.700]  I think there's something unique about haze that you don't get anywhere else
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700]  in the gene pool.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:32.700]  My experience with the best hazes is, you know,
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.700]  I haven't tried the tie stick that Leighton was talking about.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:38.700]  I haven't tried, you know, the, all the exotic land races,
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:43.700]  the Panama red, the black Congo magic, all that stuff.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.700]  But by all reports,
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:51.700]  the way that haze affects me is the most,
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.700]  it's the closest that I think I can get to those experiences.
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:56.700]  I mean, I, you know,
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.700]  I've spent some time in Amsterdam,
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:04.700]  Smoked quite a bit of Amsterdam haze when I was over there.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.700]  And I did smoke some pure tie, some pure Cambodians, lay ocean.
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:11.700]  And they all, you know,
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:15.700]  I think haze probably has quite a bit of Southeast Asian genetics in it.
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:18.700]  But it's, it's such a unique,
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.700]  incredible experience that you don't get with other kinds of weed.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:25.700]  It's, you know,
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.700]  pretty much entirely in your head.
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:32.700]  If you try to smoke the volume that, you know,
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.700]  you'll find people smoking at like cups, for example. I mean,
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:41.700]  you're gonna have such a paranoid, like freak out experience.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:44.700]  It's, you know, there's, there's like no CBD in that stuff.
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:49.700]  No CBN, if it's fresh and can just be,
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:50.700]  you know,
[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:53.700]  really it can be overwhelming like electric,
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:57.700]  just racing thoughts. I mean, almost psychedelic, you know,
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.700]  you almost feel like you're on,
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:03.700]  on the come up on mushrooms or something where your thoughts just start
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.700]  going. And, you know,
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.700]  you find yourself kind of mentally almost spinning out and you have to kind
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.700]  of cool it and it'll even come in waves, you know,
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:15.700]  you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not,
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:17.700]  you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not,
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.700]  It'll even come in waves. You know, you're really, really, really high,
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.700]  almost too high, uncomfortably high.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:28.700]  And then all of a sudden you barely feel anything and it's,
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:31.700]  it was such a, such a rush that now you're, you know,
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.700]  packing another bowl and before you're even finished packing it,
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:38.700]  you're getting another come up and starting to get so high that you're
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:43.700]  paranoid again. But it's, it's such a fun experience.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:48.700]  I think if you don't overdo it, it can just be really exciting.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:52.700]  Colors can even be brighter, you know, textures are more vivid.
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:58.700]  You go out in the world and it kind of instills like wonder in you,
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:03.700]  you know, like childlike wonder. So I, I mean, to me,
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:09.700]  Hayes is an experience that is really kind of exquisite.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:13.700]  It's so exotic. It's so rare. People don't want to grow Hayes.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:16.700]  They don't want to, it's a total pain to grow both indoor and out.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:18.700]  Very long flowering,
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:22.700]  very easy to beat up the buds when you're processing them.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:26.700]  So lots of opportunity to go wrong, very hard to do right.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:33.700]  And when it's done right, it's just such a special experience that,
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:36.700]  I mean that, I mean, you know,
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.700]  really on the whole theme of today of finding experiences in cannabis that
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:42.700]  you might not have known existed. If you've never smoked Hayes,
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:45.700]  that's absolutely one of them. You know,
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:50.700]  find some super unique Hayes and I guarantee it's there,
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:54.700]  there's no other cannabis like it. It's, it's really incredible stuff.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:57.700]  You know what? You hit the nail on the head, dude. And this is,
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:00.700]  this is what we used to do. We smoked that shit.
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.700]  We'd play Frisbee or we'd go fishing or we'd go hiking.
[01:54:03.700 --> 01:54:06.700]  It's not one of those weeds you smoke and sit around.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:11.700]  You do things with it and that's the only way that you don't go to the point
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:13.700]  where you get paranoid and crazy.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.700]  You can't sit around, right? You have to go.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.700]  You can't really sit around, right?
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:23.700]  It's like you have to go do something because you've got this kind of extra
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:25.700]  anxiety almost.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:28.700]  Literally. And I like the way you described things.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.700]  Things look different. Like they're crisper.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.700]  They have a little bit more glow to them. No, you,
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.700]  you described it really, really well. So thank you for,
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:39.700]  for clearing that up.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:43.700]  And if any of you people have never smoked Hayes and you try smoking some glow
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:45.700]  and slow dude, big time, cause you will,
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.700]  you will get really crazy paranoid and have an activity plan.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.700]  Don't just plan to sit around with a bowl of popcorn.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.700]  You're probably not going to have fun with it and probably won't ever smoke it
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:00.700]  again. But there is an incredible uplifting energy that comes from it.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.700]  And you know, you'll,
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:06.700]  you'll enjoy whatever you're doing a lot more with a couple of hits of that
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700]  stuff in your lungs.
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:13.700]  Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, I mean, it's,
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:18.700]  that's like the true sativa experience to me is kind of everything.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:23.700]  You know, when I, when I hear sativa, I think about the Hayes experience.
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.700]  Whereas, you know,
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:31.700]  I think a lot of times today people will use that term sativa you know,
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:35.700]  on, on plants that are really not even close to that,
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:40.700]  that end of the spectrum maybe just not a super couch lock Indica.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.700]  But that, you know, for, for people listening,
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:48.700]  if you haven't had that experience with your,
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:55.700]  with your Hayes or some kind of sativa flower that's definitely one worth
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:56:00.700]  seeking out. And you know, the flavor I would say is just as unique as well.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:07.700]  You know, you get some of these cedar or frankincense or kind of incense like
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.700]  aromas that you know,
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.700]  you're definitely not going to find in designer strains of today.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:20.700]  Yeah. It's almost musky, right? It has that weird earthy kind of,
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:24.700]  I don't know how to describe it. I think it was frankincense. Yeah.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:27.700]  Definitely something funky, you know,
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:31.700]  there's like a sweet spice, like there's, there's sweet notes in there.
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:36.700]  There's spicy notes, there's incense. It's, it's just very exotic smelling.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:42.700]  Sometimes I describe it as like if you pop into like a really old like cedar
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:48.700]  chest or something that hasn't been opened for awhile and you know,
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:53.700]  you get that like first rush of still air that's been sitting there for a long
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:57.700]  time. Yeah. Musky, right? Yeah. Great way to describe it.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:02.700]  Brian taking a hit. CB blows his lungs out.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:08.700]  I try to do a discreet, but Peter didn't let that happen.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:10.700]  Or maybe I'm doing it too often.
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.700]  This is excellent conversation guys.
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:18.700]  This is the kind of stuff that I really like to kind of get into is because
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:23.700]  when you understand the variety of stuff and then you can see like with some
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:26.700]  kind of reference point of what the genetic should look like,
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:31.700]  I feel like then you can kind of make a more educated guess on, you know,
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.700]  maybe breeders that stick out to you.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:35.700]  I know when I was first starting with this stuff, I mean,
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:38.700]  everybody supposedly looked cool and on overgrow that, you know,
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.700]  people would talk about all how some still today,
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:44.700]  I mean some of these guys are still growing stuff and how awful the gear
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:48.700]  actually was when they would grow it at scale. They're, you know,
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:53.700]  just, it seemed like a lot of stuff and I'm sure it still continues with,
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:57.700]  with people that we don't even know about, but it does seem like for,
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:00.700]  for a long time, people were just putting out whatever.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:03.700]  And then we would all say like, Oh, this is fantastic.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.700]  And then it would kind of fizzle out or, you know,
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:09.700]  there didn't seem like when I first got into this,
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.700]  there was anything that really stood out until we ourselves went and started
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.700]  educating ourselves on genetics. And we were like, wow,
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:17.700]  we were getting trash back in the day.
[01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:21.700]  I even remember driving to the like the continental divide up on there to get
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.700]  like a purple cush.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.700]  And because we thought like purple weed was just going to sell.
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:29.700]  And I think that's like a two and a half drive hour drive one way.
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:32.700]  And then when we got there, they gave us this like puny little tiny plant.
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.700]  And that was supposedly for like 500 bucks. So again, you know,
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.700]  you're in certain situations where you just feel like you're getting ripped
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.700]  off. I mean, I wish I, I wish I would've taken a photo.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:45.700]  I wish I would've taken a photo of that because to drive that far, man,
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:48.700]  and to see those genetics, I mean, it just,
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:51.700]  it was cowboy esque back in the day when you're trying to figure this shit
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.700]  out. And now it's not.
[01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:58.700]  So you guys definitely need to educate yourself on genetics. I feel like that's,
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700]  again, personal preference. I mean, there's,
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.700]  you could name somebody's genetics and there's going to be a ton of people
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:04.700]  that love them and a ton of people that don't.
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:07.700]  So that's on you to do your homework. And that's again, why, you know,
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.700]  we're talking with Jim today is because I feel like, man, your, your references,
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:14.700]  it's somewhere where somebody can get more of like a cliff notes, if you will,
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.700]  just a quality review of something and then run with it.
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:20.700]  Yeah. If someone doesn't know what they're looking for, you know,
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.700]  if they're like just getting into this and you know,
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:27.700]  they've smoked a little bit and they have preferences, but you know,
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:32.700]  maybe aren't aren't so nerdy as to like have a whole library, you know,
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:36.700]  an actual like book library and, you know, have really delved into this stuff.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:40.700]  Yeah. It'd be a good starting place, you know, look,
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:45.700]  I would recommend like sorting through maybe my blog,
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:50.700]  like by breeder or something to kind of get a feel because each breeder,
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:53.700]  you know, passes on their own kind of style.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:58.700]  And, and certainly will, will cater to different tastes.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:02.700]  So if people have, you know, one preference versus another,
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:07.700]  that's probably a pretty good way, pretty good way to get acquainted. But yeah,
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:10.700]  yeah. I mean, it is amazing. You know, you talk about stories like that,
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:15.700]  like driving five hours for a plant and you pay 500 bucks for it. And you know,
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:19.700]  it's this little plant that you have to nurse probably back to health.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.700]  It probably wasn't even very healthy. And you know,
[02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:27.700]  everyone who was growing before it was really legal has all those stories,
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.700]  right. They were really passionate about this stuff.
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:33.700]  I got a good one for you guys. I was out,
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:38.700]  I usually go up to Humboldt County in the fall and see, Oh,
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:43.700]  look at the little one. What's up? Hey, Hey. Anyway,
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:46.700]  so I go up and I hang out with Wendy and Kev and, you know,
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:51.700]  see the crew up there. And I was having lunch with Kevin and this couple comes
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.700]  driving up and walks up to Kevin says, you know,
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:58.700]  we're here from Oakland and we're here to see you.
[02:00:58.700 --> 02:01:01.700]  And he's like, dude, you just drove from Oklahoma.
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:04.700]  I thought you were local man. He goes, all right, all right, hang on. Let me,
[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:05.700]  let me go back and get you the cut.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.700]  So he fricking went and got him a cut and handed it to him. And they're like,
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:12.700]  well, how much do you want? It's not, dude, you just drove from Oklahoma.
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:16.700]  Please have it. That shit still goes on.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.700]  There you go about getting lucky, man. Right.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:21.700]  Well reaching out to the right person, you know,
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:22.700]  the right people. Yeah.
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:23.700]  And I think that's the thing about it.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:27.700]  Peter just got booped. Did he?
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:31.700]  I don't know why, but kids love doing that. My boy is six.
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:34.700]  Can I get a boop?
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:40.700]  How old is she?
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.700]  She's six.
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:46.700]  And I think she's about eight or nine years old.
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:55.120]  How old is she?
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:00.060]  She just turned three last week.
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:03.700]  She needs more air time.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.700]  She just met Valentina.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.700]  What is this?
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:06.700]  Jellyfish.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.700]  It's a jellyfish.
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:08.700]  It's a very good jellyfish.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:11.700]  Did you make it at school?
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:15.700]  Or you don't have school Sunday, summer?
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:18.700]  No, she has school.
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:21.700]  Oh, she does?
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.700]  Yeah, keep that brain going.
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:26.700]  I love that feeling.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:32.700]  There was a semantics comment about, I guess, Couch Lock Indica.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:41.700]  So Cheddar Bob, if you can, or if someone can type out what the issue is, because I was not really listening, and I'll post it.
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.700]  Shout out to Cheddar Bob.
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:54.700]  Terminology is important, but I think that the general public, consumers have an idea of what Indica versus Sativa means, and people who grow have a very different idea.
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:59.700]  And it's like, which audience are you talking to when you say something?
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:03.700]  So Cheddar Bob says, what does Couch Lock Indica mean?
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:04.700]  Sure.
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:10.700]  Yeah, I would say that's a term that I refer to.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:22.700]  I guess, you know, it's really probably the majority of elite clones that are floating around today, I would say, kind of fit in that category.
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:32.700]  You know, they might not be necessarily pure Indicas or pure Indica genetics or anything like that, which is even debatable what that means, right?
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:46.700]  But, you know, when I use that term, I'm basically referring to some of these hype strains that have kind of muddled highs, kind of indistinguishable from one another.
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:04:02.700]  You know, like if you're smoking one and you smoke a different one the next day, and they're all just kind of blend together or are just not very characteristic in any one particular way.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:18.700]  I guess that's something I'll usually refer to as just, you know, Couch Lock Indica. It's just kind of a generic. And not that it's, you know, not enjoyable, but those are locators, not medical effects. I'm not really sure what that means.
[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:28.700]  Well, it's kind of like the high-immersing dominant strains are like that. They tend to, you know, knock you down. And if you've got pain issues, they work fantastic.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.700]  Absolutely.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:35.700]  Yeah, not something that you want to smoke at a party because everyone's going to get quiet and go lay down.
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:51.700]  Right, right. And the thing I guess that, you know, I feel about those strains is that it's something that's just, you know, it's not something you need to necessarily breed for. It's readily available in all kinds of different strains.
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:05:15.700]  So to me, it's not something that I'm going to go seek out because it's all over the place, right? You know, you can have that experience with any kind of flavor that you want. It can be easy to grow all that stuff. Whereas, you know, on the other hand, haze, which is very much not a Couch Lock Indica, you really need to seek that out.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:31.700]  And it's difficult to find a strain that has those characteristics. So, yeah, you know, Couch Lock Indica is just kind of a term that I throw around to some of these generally more generic type smokes.
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:59.700]  Now, I remember a cheese that I once bought in Arizona a few years back. And man, that thing took you down. I mean, two hits and you literally could not get off the couch. And I ended up giving it away because it's just like I don't enjoy that. You know, it's not what I really want to do is go into my deep headspace and then, you know, beat myself up while I'm trying to freaking come down.
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:14.700]  So I hear you. I think that's kind of a good term or a good expression. Perhaps maybe some of the newer people won't understand what that means, but eventually they'll figure it out once they have that type of experience.
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:39.700]  Right. And I think, you know, even most newbies, you know, for sure have had just different experiences with Bud where one really affects them, even if they can articulate how they really like how that one affects them, you know. So those are the things. Yeah, I mean, yeah, Mr. Toad, if you want to get into the whole argument, there's narrow leaf drug, there's broad leaf drug.
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:45.700]  That's what I was trying to let's talk about that because I definitely feel like that's the.
[02:06:46.700 --> 02:07:07.700]  And this this would be a good French conversation because he mentals out over the exact meaning of words. And the distinction I was trying to make earlier, which I think everybody can agree on, is that for your average consumer, those words mean a certain thing for the higher level people like Mr. Toad and Cheddar Bob in the chat and stuff.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:26.700]  It's like they have different meanings, but I think everybody understands when you're saying it for a different audience. The question is, do we want to reboot and like correct the terminology and maybe have new words that mean, you know, knock you out? It's like the knock you out. One fifty proof weed.
[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:45.700]  Don't put wheelchair in there. Remember that? Oh, don't smoke that. That's wheelchair weed. But yeah, I think that they're like everything there should be proper terminology so that especially these newbies that are trying or starting should have some.
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:49.700]  So what would you call something that will knock you the F out?
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:08:06.700]  We used to call it wheelchair weed. I mean, that was that was it in the day. You know, basically handicapped one way or the other. But I don't know. I don't know what the best terminology is other than, you know, it's a knock you out or it lifts you up.
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:10.700]  Broad leaf or narrow leaf.
[02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:14.700]  Right. So this is kind of a more articulate of what I was trying to.
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:16.700]  I was trying to say.
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:17.700]  That's accurate. Yeah.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:20.700]  Yeah, there you go. There you go.
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:33.700]  Well said, Cascadian grown. I mean, you know, there's Robert Clark tried to categorize all these. Right. He tried to make narrow leaf drug, narrow leaf fiber, broad leaf drug, broad leaf fiber.
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:51.700]  And, you know, he's got all these subcategories and all of the acronyms. And it's like those are all useful for a botanist, but they don't tell the consumer anything. And then the consumer, you know, is.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:58.700]  You know, I mean, Indica and Sativa necessarily mean anything. I mean, not really like they're interesting.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:00.700]  Right.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:16.700]  I think they kind of have proofed it. It's like, you know, type one, type two, type three. Like the type two is going to be almost CBD one to one. And that's not going to whack you. But again, you know, that's relatively new term to the to the discussion.
[02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:32.700]  Well, and, you know, I mean, this is really at the end of the day why I have the blog, you know, if it was easy enough to categorize a strain as couch lock Indica in one line, then there wouldn't be a need for my blog. Right.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:47.700]  So, I mean, these the terms Indica and Sativa are useful if they convey certain things to you. But I mean, yeah, if we want to get more nuanced and you really want to know what a strain does to you.
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:53.700]  I don't think you can put them in these categories. I don't think they are.
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:57.700]  Yeah, I think Cascadian grown is correct there again.
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:19.700]  But, you know, and that's what makes this so confusing. And at the end of the day, why you do need a really detailed blog, detailed descriptions, notes, different people's input, because, you know, it's such a diverse plant, so much variety and categorizing it in a couple words is difficult, if not impossible.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:45.700]  Yeah, again, you know, it's a new world and we've got to start figuring out better ways to communicate in subjects like this, which were, you know, come on, it's been illegal for how long, you know. And so the conversation wasn't widespread. So therefore, there probably needs to be have we need to have that conversation on a greater level.
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:52.700]  Shout out to Blue Tank. That guy's always educating. So I always like to support people that are.
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:59.700]  Yeah, you know, to the audience, you're in Maine. Go to Maristown. Yeah.
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:20.700]  Yeah, you know, people don't realize, but you can definitely buy terpenes from true terpenes that if you sniff it, it will it will knock the buzz down similar to eating a slice of pizza when you're when you're too stoned. It'll bring you back to some level. And so and coffee. There's another one. Coffee and cannabis, they go hand in hand, right?
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:31.700]  Yes, the word strain versus cultivar as well. Yeah, it's it's interesting. I'm glad we're having a pleasant conversation about a word. I don't think there's any one.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:35.700]  Right. Three. When we talk this long, just use all three and then everybody's happy.
[02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:42.700]  That's right. Yeah. If you read my blog, strange, strange. Boom. Yeah. Strain it.
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:44.700]  Landrace.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.700]  Say weed a few times.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:47.700]  Appalachian.
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:49.700]  Terroir.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.700]  Like, do you have humble Appalachian of all your soils, bag soil?
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:12:01.700]  Good question, right? And there's a huge debate on that. I mean, huge.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:07.700]  I know. So the question is how do you get the word out?
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:14.700]  The last I was involved in that determining the Appalachian was you had to be more than 51 percent.
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:18.700]  So you could blend in potting soil.
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:22.700]  Yep. Varietal. Yep. Chemovar and chemotel.
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:31.700]  So I feel like for a dispensary, if someone's coming in for medical purposes to develop kind of a thing, we talked about this in the past, but to develop kind of a chemotype,
[02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:35.700]  you have to have a lot of knowledge of the soil.
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.700]  So you have to have a lot of knowledge of the soil.
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.700]  And so you have to have a lot of knowledge of the soil.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:55.700]  So I feel like for a dispensary, if someone's coming in for medical purposes to develop kind of a thing, we talked about this in the past, but to develop kind of a chemotype system where someone would know,
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:13:05.700]  like, forget whether it's called Blue Dream because we know every dispensary is Blue Dream or even the same dispensary getting Blue Dream this week versus next week versus next month,
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:07.700]  it's not going to be consistent.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.700]  So that's irrelevant.
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:11.700]  But anyway, that's...
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:21.700]  You know what it should go to is cannabinoid testing and terpene testing, because even those levels are different, you're going to get different effects.
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:25.700]  So like proofing the alcohol, that would be a wonderful way.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.700]  But of course, it's very expensive to have that type of testing done.
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:33.700]  And until there's more labs and the price comes down, that's probably not the best way of doing it.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:41.700]  Because even in the same damn plant grown in the same damn environment, there's going to be various variations.
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.700]  So, you know, she's a crazy girl.
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:49.700]  And, you know, so I'm not sure what the best answer is to it.
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:14:01.700]  But at some point in the future, we do need to make it easier for the consumer to buy what they want and not put on a cultivar name that really doesn't represent much to them.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:06.700]  So to downshift the conversation.
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:08.700]  Look at that.
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:13.700]  Back into the red of the bullseye of the topic.
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:16.700]  What these conversations are about.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:18.700]  Yeah.
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:26.700]  Shout out to Green Goddess, because she's got to be like in just a few years, getting like a high level PhD education with this.
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:28.700]  Just straight from the source.
[02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:30.700]  So shout out to you for doing the homework.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:32.700]  Yeah. Deep respect, Green Goddess.
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:36.700]  Yeah, I'm flattered that she's asking.
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:42.700]  You know, what I feed with, I actually try not to feed.
[02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:57.700]  So I try to make a soil that's extremely rich in compost and minerals and is going to be able to carry those plants as far as I can on its own.
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:11.700]  Compost and compost extracts, I think, are really the way to get your soil in good shape, which are essentially probiotics for your soil, getting all the proper biology in there.
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:24.700]  And if I do need to feed extra nutrients, you know, Organics Alive has a really great line of powders that is totally water soluble that works good.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:31.700]  You know, if you need if you just need macro nutrients to get them into your soil or into your plants, that stuff's great.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:34.700]  I also use a couple other products.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:39.700]  I use some some stuff from Crescive Soil Services.
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:48.700]  Scott over there has hooked me up with some minerals and some other products that make those minerals more bioavailable.
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:53.700]  And I do foliar feed with those in veg.
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:55.700]  And they do make a huge difference.
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:15:59.700]  You can really see in the plants literally overnight.
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:11.700]  So, you know, really, I would encourage anyone who wants to get into living soil or has living soil and really wants to dial in their stuff.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:17.700]  One of the best things you can do is go get the best quality compost you can find.
[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:23.700]  You mix a handful of it up in a bucket of water and you water that in.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.700]  And that's a probiotic inoculant.
[02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:38.700]  And assuming the quality of that compost is on point, I think something that simple, you know, literally hand mix it into the water for under five minutes.
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:41.700]  And that's one of the best things you can do for your plants.
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:47.640]  As far as feed goes.
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:50.640]  Yeah, right on.
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:17:01.640]  So basically what you're saying is you're building that soil system and you're trying to let it become alive and thriving for all the right verbiage so that you can kind of manage that.
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.640]  And now you're more of like like we like to use again the verbiage of being more of like a coach now than a grower.
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:17.640]  You kind of like are just managing things and rocking and sometimes each little bed or pot or however you were farming is going to be its own little utopia.
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:21.640]  And you need to kind of or it could be tragic if things go haywire.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:30.640]  So there's you know, there's different ways to manage each system and there's going to be a lot going on there to manage when you're first trying to understand this from A to Z.
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:32.640]  Totally.
[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.640]  I mean, yeah, that's 100 percent it.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:44.640]  The more ego you have as an organic gardener, the more you think you're in control, the more you think you're feeding your plants, taking care of them, all that.
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.640]  I guarantee you the worst your quality flower.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:54.640]  The way I look at it is you make those little microbes happy.
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.640]  It's all you're trying to do.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:00.640]  Make the microbes in the soil happy and they are going to take care of your plant.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.640]  Your plant is going to thrive.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:07.640]  It has millions of years of genetics built inside of it.
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:11.640]  It knows exactly what to do, how to do it.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:17.640]  And if you give it everything it needs, then it's going to do the job.
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:26.640]  If you think you're in control and you're going to steer the plant and do this and that, I think you're going to run into all kinds of problems.
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:29.640]  So that's my perspective there.
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:32.640]  Exactly like you said, Brian, you're not the grower.
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:34.640]  You're kind of just a steward.
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.640]  You're facilitating the growth.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:42.640]  You're giving the plant an environment that it's going to thrive in and it's doing the growing.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:58.640]  So that's kind of how I look at it is if you have an incredible soil and keep those soil conditions as they are, that's going to translate directly to plant health, which is quite a lot.
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:02.640]  And that's going to directly translate to your smoking experience.
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:04.640]  Well said.
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:06.640]  I'm sorry I had to bounce out on that conversation.
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:19.640]  And by the way, you just remind me that last year the Organics Alive guys gave me a whole bunch of sample with all their stuff in it.
[02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:31.640]  So when I stuck, but like all the powders, more powders.
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.640]  I know they're all just meals.
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.640]  They're all just ground up organic material, right?
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:41.640]  They're the byproduct of microbial fermentation.
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:43.640]  These ones.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.640]  So here's the castor bean foliar.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:59.640]  So if you guys can think of a trivia question, I can ship one of these out to someone, which was kind of the original intent.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:07.640]  And then I forgot about David Copperfield over here.
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:17.640]  So, Jim, do you have a ready to go trivia question for USA viewers only?
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.640]  Ready to go trivia question?
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:27.640]  Should we get a I saw Greg McAllister in the chat.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:29.640]  We have the Seattle Kraken.
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.640]  Should we do a Seattle's newest hockey team question?
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:34.640]  No, I'm joking.
[02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:39.640]  But anyway, if not today, I'll think of a trivia question.
[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:41.640]  Send one of these out to someone.
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:46.640]  But if you can think of one today, we can pop it up.
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:48.640]  All right.
[02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:50.640]  Oh, what was it?
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:52.640]  All right.
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:56.640]  Cheddar Bob had what was the number one restaurant in the world in 2005?
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:02.640]  Yeah, I need to have like a bag of trivia questions ready to go.
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:08.640]  I need to buy like Trivial Pursuit and just pull random questions out.
[02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:12.480]  But anyway, carry on.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:16.480]  That was totally off topic, but I'll think of a question.
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:20.480]  No, I wish I wish, you know, on the spot a little.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.480]  I'm sure if I'm sure I'll something can come up.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:25.480]  Some weed related trivia.
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:28.480]  Could do a Marist M.
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:30.480]  Maine related trivia question.
[02:21:34.330 --> 02:21:36.330]  Or the state bird of.
[02:21:39.330 --> 02:21:40.330]  Maine.
[02:21:42.330 --> 02:21:45.330]  Those are basically whoever can Google the fastest.
[02:21:46.330 --> 02:21:50.330]  That's not the actual question, but that's where my head's at right now.
[02:21:51.330 --> 02:21:53.330]  It is the black capped chickadee.
[02:21:54.330 --> 02:21:55.330]  Did anyone know that?
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:21:59.860]  Not me.
[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:05.860]  I bet all our main listeners knew the I bet that rolled rolled off the tongue.
[02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:10.860]  How many pounds of lobster does the average.
[02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:14.860]  Bar Harbor resident eat per year.
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:20.860]  I don't know the answer to that one either.
[02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:25.860]  But all right, you can bring it back on topic.
[02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:29.860]  Well, how about this?
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:31.860]  Have you ever worked with any of Ben Holmes's gear?
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:34.860]  I know he was kind of closer to where you are.
[02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:37.860]  No, I'm not actually familiar with him.
[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:44.860]  I feel like he's another breeder out there that never gets enough credit for what he contributed to the industry.
[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:49.860]  And I would love to love to chat with someone like that.
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:51.860]  Ben Holmes, he said.
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:53.860]  Ben Holmes.
[02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:58.860]  So like, you know, you've obviously gone through some of the upper echelon stuff.
[02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:01.860]  There were some more that I wanted to kind of go through.
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:06.860]  I really like how you obviously we keep using the word articulating your thought process.
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:16.860]  And that's exactly what I was hoping that you were going to do for the viewers is if you're going to spend the money either in the flower form or you're going to spend the money in the seed form, depending on where you are in this.
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:21.860]  I still feel like you need to understand the nuances of obviously growing it.
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.860]  But at the same time, what is the customer experience going to be?
[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:35.860]  Because a lot of that stuff, like you had mentioned, you know, when you're your trim crew is handling it, if they're handling it in a horrible way, storing it in a horrible way, allowing it to cure in a horrible way.
[02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:39.860]  It doesn't matter what kind of brand you're trying to build for yourself on social media.
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:41.860]  The customers just aren't going to be there.
[02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:48.860]  A case in point is that that one guy, his name is Dan Bilzerian, a huge Instagram influencer, blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:50.860]  But at the end of the day, it was all fake.
[02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:53.860]  And the product was absolute garbage.
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:58.860]  So, you know, and then you have these other little farms around that I feel like are crushing it.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:10.860]  And I don't think a lot of people realize that there's still this is still new enough where if you have a small enough farm, case in point, Oklahoma, for everybody that's out there, you know, as far as I understand, it's still twenty five hundred dollars to kind of get a little bit of a boost.
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:12.860]  And get things rolling.
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:15.860]  That is extremely cheap compared to Denver, Colorado.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:21.860]  So a lot of you that, you know, maybe you do have a little bit more money or you have something to play around with.
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:26.860]  If you just want to kind of take a venture with this or just grow at your house again, you need to understand genetics.
[02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:28.860]  And that's kind of where we're getting at.
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:34.860]  Another one that stood out for me, man, that you gave a review on was the Cushmint.
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:36.860]  Is that cool that we can kind of talk about that?
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:40.860]  Because I feel like in my peer group, people were definitely on that for a little while.
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.860]  Yeah, you know, I kept hearing about it.
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:53.860]  So that was a flower that beneath the dirt had had actually gifted to me where we traded one of the other.
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:59.860]  I'm not sure, but. And, you know, he gave that to me with a few other flowers.
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:01.860]  I'd been hearing about it for so long.
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:04.860]  I'm sure most of the listeners have heard about it.
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:08.860]  And the flavor was really spectacular.
[02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:09.860]  Like, I mean, really noteworthy.
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:12.860]  It was really, I thought, pretty special.
[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:21.860]  If I remember, it almost tasted like it was it was very sweet and it had a note in it.
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:29.860]  You know, I mean, it had that kind of cookies note, but it also had notes almost like those ring.
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:31.860]  It reminded me of those ring pops.
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:37.860]  If you remember those from like grade school, they had a candy that was a lollipop on a ring.
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:45.860]  And for whatever reason, the flavor totally reminded me of those ring pops.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:50.860]  And so, I mean, the flavor I thought was phenomenal.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:26:00.860]  It's really a testament, I think, to indoor breeding and growing that we can have, you know, weed that tastes like that.
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:02.860]  It kind of blows my mind.
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:11.860]  But, you know, it's to if I want to, you know, poke some people in the comments again, I would say it's a couch lock indica.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:15.860]  It's, you know, a fairly generic smoke.
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:29.860]  I actually didn't think that it was like super overwhelmingly potent or, you know, this just total mind blower in the effect category really in any any way.
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:36.860]  So, you know, for me, at the end of the day, you know, I'm really smoking cannabis for the effect.
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:40.860]  That's the main thing I'm always after.
[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.860]  If it tastes good, that's icing on the cake.
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:55.860]  But I'm primarily looking for an effect that's really going to make me feel good, going to make me relaxed, is going to make me happy.
[02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:59.860]  And, you know, just generally a better, a better version of myself.
[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:05.860]  For me, Cushman's doesn't totally do that.
[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:10.860]  It's more of just kind of a relax, numb out kind of thing.
[02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:24.860]  You know, probably better for staying in for the night, watching a movie, you know, but not really like very reflectful or insightful or outgoing or.
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:31.860]  You know, it just didn't exhibit the favorite parts of cannabis that that make me really like the plant.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:34.860]  So, yeah, there it is there.
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:37.860]  So beneath the beneath the dirt does a great job growing.
[02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:39.860]  He grows organic soil.
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:43.860]  He feeds quite a bit.
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:45.860]  He's more commercially oriented than I am.
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:53.860]  But he his flowers always aesthetically stunning and very strong aromas, very loud.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:59.860]  So Cushman's was, you know, I mean, cool flower and stuff.
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:05.860]  But if he was offering me the cut today, you know, I'd personally rather pop some seeds that I've got.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:12.860]  Well, yeah, I mean, you got to you got to vote like you do.
[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:14.860]  I'm sure that's all I would do as well.
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:16.860]  Right. Yeah.
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:17.860]  You know, that's that's part of it.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:26.860]  But he's always trying to give me cuts and I'm always trying to make more room to, like you said, kind of pull from the vault.
[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:33.860]  So, you know, I've got a fridge drawer, actually two of them dedicated to seeds.
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:36.860]  So more and more than enough for my lifetime.
[02:28:40.390 --> 02:28:46.390]  Another one that we could just go over real quick that I feel like the viewers would like, especially for nostalgia's sake, as you reviewed,
[02:28:46.390 --> 02:28:49.390]  it seemed like, again, the the real version of the AK-47.
[02:28:51.390 --> 02:28:55.390]  Yeah, that's that's one, you know, you talk about fake cuts and stuff.
[02:28:56.390 --> 02:29:00.390]  That is one that's very hard to find the real, real deal.
[02:29:00.390 --> 02:29:02.390]  There's a lot of seeds going around labeled AK.
[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:04.390]  There's some cuts.
[02:29:05.390 --> 02:29:15.390]  And that was one that, you know, when I when I first got to Colorado about, I guess, 12 years ago or so, that was another one kind of like blueberry.
[02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:20.390]  Durban, Golden Goat, Kong.
[02:29:20.390 --> 02:29:25.390]  Those were all, you know, any any dispensary you'd walk into and they had those.
[02:29:27.390 --> 02:29:29.390]  And it's just kind of really disappeared, the AK.
[02:29:31.390 --> 02:29:34.390]  And that was kind of, you know, like you said, very nostalgic.
[02:29:35.390 --> 02:29:38.390]  You know, we used to get bags of AK growing up in the Midwest.
[02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:44.390]  I'm not sure where they came from, but people said they were AK and they were always better than the Beasters.
[02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:55.390]  And that buddy of mine who's now in Missouri, that's his favorite strain of all time is the AK-47.
[02:29:56.390 --> 02:30:03.390]  So he all he's always getting it from different seed companies and, you know, trying to see who's got the real deal.
[02:30:04.390 --> 02:30:06.390]  And this was one that he he had grown.
[02:30:08.390 --> 02:30:12.390]  And it was just everything that he remembered the AK to be.
[02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:16.390]  So he gave me a sample to get reviewed and get it up on the blog.
[02:30:18.390 --> 02:30:22.390]  And, you know, again, for me, it's it's a little bit almost like a skunk one kind of thing.
[02:30:24.390 --> 02:30:29.390]  You know, I I it's very familiar smelling it.
[02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:32.390]  You can smell all those aromas and other strains.
[02:30:33.390 --> 02:30:39.390]  But it doesn't necessarily do you know, it doesn't get me excited the same way.
[02:30:40.390 --> 02:30:48.390]  A new you know, some new freeborn or some new Bodhi or CSI Humble, you know, all those guys new drops get me like really excited.
[02:30:49.390 --> 02:30:52.390]  The AK for me, you know, sure, I'll do it.
[02:30:52.390 --> 02:30:54.390]  But and I'll enjoy it.
[02:30:54.390 --> 02:30:56.390]  You know, it's a creative, mostly up high.
[02:30:56.390 --> 02:31:00.390]  It's, you know, again, I'll poke some people in the comments.
[02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:05.390]  It's more leaning toward a sativa than it would be a couch lock indica or something generic.
[02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:10.390]  But it's just I don't know.
[02:31:10.390 --> 02:31:12.390]  I just feel like there's more interesting stuff out there.
[02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:18.390]  And again, you know, I'd rather look through some new seeds and try to find something different.
[02:31:18.390 --> 02:31:28.390]  But but yeah, you know, again, my friend, who's certainly a veteran by everybody's everyone's and anybody's standards.
[02:31:28.390 --> 02:31:30.390]  That's his favorite of all time.
[02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:31.390]  He loves it.
[02:31:31.390 --> 02:31:35.390]  He loves the creative aspect, loves the euphoria from that one.
[02:31:35.390 --> 02:31:38.390]  For me, it's just not particularly euphoric.
[02:31:38.390 --> 02:31:41.390]  So that's just my experience.
[02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:45.790]  I can sit here and do this all day.
[02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:54.790]  I don't know if there's questions for him or there's a few more that if you guys want him to kind of go through, especially like I was wondering, kind of asking this question as well.
[02:31:55.790 --> 02:32:00.790]  When you mentioned the gorilla goji cross with the blueberry, you mentioned Bodhi there with the gojis.
[02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:02.790]  Is that correct?
[02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:03.790]  Yeah, his goji.
[02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:09.790]  Yeah. And that's another one that I feel like really used to pay the mortgage, if you will.
[02:32:09.790 --> 02:32:12.790]  That was something that I feel like a lot of people would want.
[02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:18.790]  And then I feel like I started to recognize because he had more of like that Tiffany color bag with the gold sticker on it.
[02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:23.790]  Totally. Yeah, I that was you know, that was the stream that put Bodhi on the map.
[02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:25.790]  Right. Was the goji.
[02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:40.790]  And, you know, when right when I kind of got into Bodhi and started making seeds and swapping seeds with people, that was one that a guy on on Facebook, of all places, ended up trading with me.
[02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:49.790]  And he had crossed a blueberry sativa from DJ Short to that goji.
[02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:55.790]  I believe or I think so. Yep. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:32:55.790 --> 02:33:04.790]  So, you know, anyone who's had DJ Short to blueberry, the real deal is amazing, incredible, super unique.
[02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:14.790]  You know, you really do get blueberry or artificial blue raspberry, even those terpenes come up.
[02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:26.790]  And this one in particular had those those really kind of blue raspberry turps, you know, like tasted and smelled like a snow cone or cotton candy kind of thing.
[02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:39.790]  Which to me, you know, is just there's some flavors out there that are just you can't believe a plant is producing this, you know, and you smoke its flowers and you get to taste it.
[02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:44.790]  It's like the weirdest, most bizarre thing. Right. It's super crazy.
[02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:48.790]  So I you know, it grabbed me. I thought it was a crazy string.
[02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:54.790]  And it also happens to be extremely euphoric and uppity.
[02:33:55.790 --> 02:34:04.790]  And, you know, you smoke that stuff and you're just like on cloud nine, like your whole body's tingling with euphoria and energy and up vibes.
[02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:11.790]  And I mean, the fact that it tastes like blue raspberry is just, you know, the ridiculous kicker.
[02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:14.790]  So that's a really special string.
[02:34:15.790 --> 02:34:19.790]  And yeah, the guy guy out in Washington made that one.
[02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:21.790]  So big shout out to him.
[02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:24.790]  He did some really nice selecting to make that one.
[02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:26.790]  Yeah, it's gorgeous.
[02:34:27.790 --> 02:34:32.790]  I don't know if if Peter was able to find that one, but that is definitely one that that I would want to seek after.
[02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:44.790]  And, you know, when you would go around before the expo days and that kind of stuff, I mean, that little teal bag to me when you would kind of be a more of like the underground seed exchanges and stuff.
[02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:46.790]  I felt like that just meant quality.
[02:34:47.790 --> 02:34:48.790]  And it was a simple kind of thing.
[02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:56.790]  But at the same time, I just that's what I meant by like sometimes your brand will just speak for itself and you don't really need something with shout out to Duke Diamond.
[02:34:57.790 --> 02:35:00.790]  You know, he doesn't he doesn't come with a bunch of marketing and branding.
[02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:06.790]  I do feel like you need you definitely need that if you're not an older head in this industry.
[02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:17.790]  But it is cool to see that back in the day, at least more people valued like the actual quality of the genetics than just the hype train, because there's a lot of other people that are growing it.
[02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:19.790]  So it must be fantastic.
[02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:23.790]  Right. You know, I mean, it's really the hype train.
[02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:32.790]  Sometimes I wonder if, you know, it feels a lot like like the hype train is running everything right.
[02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:36.790]  Like the whole industry, the whole culture is just following behind it.
[02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:41.790]  And then other times I think that maybe the hype train is just the loudest.
[02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:43.790]  You know, it's like the loudest people.
[02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:46.790]  It's all the people spending money on marketing.
[02:35:46.790 --> 02:36:00.790]  And in the meanwhile, you know, there's all these guys on forums and swapping and breeding, you know, what appeals to them personally, independent of, you know, any market forces.
[02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:15.790]  So, you know, and sometimes you just have to draw those guys out because they're these like hermits who, you know, are often in states that are not very friendly and doing this in their basement or whatever.
[02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:24.790]  And, you know, so I'm not sure if it's if it's rare or if it's just that these guys are quiet.
[02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:29.790]  But I think there's plenty, plenty of really unique stuff being made out there.
[02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:33.790]  And, you know, you talk about the teal bag and everything.
[02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:36.790]  It does mean quality.
[02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:43.790]  And I also think, you know, when you connect with other people who are it's funny, like specifically into Bodhi.
[02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:48.790]  A lot of the guys who are into Bodhi are really doing their own thing.
[02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:51.790]  They're, you know, growing Bodhi strains.
[02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:56.790]  They're growing other people's strains from the forums, cultivars, sorry.
[02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:01.790]  And, you know, they're growing all this stuff and crossing all this stuff and swapping.
[02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:04.790]  And like there's this whole underground kind of movement.
[02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:08.790]  And a ton of these guys are big Bodhi fans.
[02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:15.790]  So when I see that teal bag with the gold label, you know, Bodhi's packaging for everyone listening like.
[02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:21.790]  You can if someone's into Bodhi, I kind of make some assumptions about them.
[02:37:22.790 --> 02:37:25.790]  Like I'll be like, oh, yeah, this guy's, you know, he's down.
[02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:30.790]  He probably is more into the side of cannabis culture that I'm into.
[02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:36.790]  You know, really enjoying things really about the plant, not about the hype, not about the marketing.
[02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:39.790]  So that's kind of my experience.
[02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:46.790]  I mean, Bodhi has created this really kind of amazing cult following with a lot of really cool people in it.
[02:37:47.790 --> 02:37:49.790]  But I feel like that's kind of the issue, though.
[02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:57.790]  Like if you don't know about him, you don't know about to seek the teal bag when you're brand new to this and your eyes probably scanning stuff.
[02:37:58.790 --> 02:38:07.790]  Or at least, you know, beforehand that might not stick out to you as as a quality brand unless you already know like, hey, that little bag, that's a steal right there for 80 bucks.
[02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:12.790]  Or, you know, there are definitely people that were just sometimes I felt like didn't really know what they had.
[02:38:13.790 --> 02:38:16.790]  Like when I was a little kid, I felt like you could hustle kids with baseball cards and stuff.
[02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:18.790]  And I felt like back then it was the same kind of thing.
[02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:24.790]  Like if you knew more about the seeds than they did, then you would be able to be like, yo, I'll give you these and these and these for those.
[02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:26.790]  And they're like, oh, yeah, that sounds like a great deal.
[02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:31.790]  So I feel like Bodhi Seeds is something that has been tried and true.
[02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:37.790]  Are there other brands? I know that you've kind of mentioned a few other ones, obviously, the main ones.
[02:38:38.790 --> 02:38:39.790]  So again, shout out to Mean Gene that you work with.
[02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:44.790]  It seems like the majority of your work, it seems like you're kind of rocking his stuff.
[02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:46.790]  Yeah, you know, yeah.
[02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:52.790]  And I do want to be clear, you know, I don't actually like do any work with Mean Gene.
[02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:53.790]  We don't have.
[02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:56.790]  Yeah, yeah. I just meant like you're you admire his work.
[02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:58.790]  So you're just running his stuff.
[02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:08.790]  Totally. You know, like I said at the beginning, I just think as far as if you're looking for consistent quality, you don't want to, you know, hunt that much.
[02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:10.790]  You don't want to have to sift through plants.
[02:39:11.790 --> 02:39:16.790]  I think Freeborn Genetics and Mean Gene is a great way to go.
[02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:22.790]  If you want to, you know, his stuff isn't cheap and it's very difficult to find.
[02:39:23.790 --> 02:39:25.790]  You know, I get DMs all the time.
[02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:28.790]  You know, where do I find Mean Gene? Where can I get it?
[02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:31.790]  And it's like, well, you got to be up on auctions.
[02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:33.790]  You have to follow the right Instagram pages.
[02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:36.790]  You've got to be trading with people.
[02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:39.790]  It's like it's very hard to get a retail pack.
[02:39:40.790 --> 02:39:43.790]  So, you know, I mean, Bodhi is a great one.
[02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:44.790]  Like his gear is great.
[02:39:45.790 --> 02:39:46.790]  It's affordable.
[02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:49.790]  You can find it everywhere.
[02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:53.790]  Like, you know, you don't need to be on these obscure forums.
[02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:56.790]  I think CSI Humboldt does a pretty good job.
[02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:58.790]  He's got some awesome genetics.
[02:39:59.790 --> 02:40:01.790]  They can be a little pricey as well.
[02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:07.790]  You know, I had really good luck with Greenpoint seeds back in the day.
[02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:09.790]  They're Copperchem male.
[02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:11.790]  I bought those when they were testers.
[02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:17.790]  You know, he did his first round of pollinating and was selling them untested for 30 bucks a pack.
[02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:22.790]  And I bought like, you know, 10 packs from the guy or something crazy like that.
[02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:25.790]  And they were really nice.
[02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:30.790]  You know, I see some people in the comments talking about Gage Green.
[02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:35.790]  I didn't have, I have not had super great luck with Gage Green,
[02:40:36.790 --> 02:40:39.790]  but I know some people who are big fans of their stuff.
[02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:45.790]  You know, those are probably my favorites right there.
[02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:48.790]  I think Mean Gene, Bodhi, CSI Humboldt.
[02:40:49.790 --> 02:40:52.790]  You know, a lot of people like to talk about Snow High stuff.
[02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:55.790]  I haven't had great luck with his stuff.
[02:40:57.790 --> 02:41:03.790]  Some of the hype stuff, you know, archive genetics, stuff like that can be cool.
[02:41:03.790 --> 02:41:09.790]  But I think you end up getting a lot of those more, you know, plants with generic effects.
[02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:13.790]  Very potent, but still kind of generic.
[02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:20.790]  I'm trying to think where else, but you know, really, I mean, it's amazing to me.
[02:41:21.790 --> 02:41:26.790]  Like if you just go buy from Bodhi, how much variety you can get,
[02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:29.790]  how many different experiences you can get with Bodhi.
[02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:32.790]  You know, I mean, he's doing land race increases, Indica, Sativa.
[02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:37.790]  He's doing crosses of those. He's doing hype cuts.
[02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:41.790]  He's got his own males, you know, that he's making F1s with.
[02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:48.790]  It's like, you know, if you just go to Bodhi, I mean, the options are like pretty ridiculous.
[02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:53.790]  As far as just, you know, they're unending.
[02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:56.790]  But if you want to spend a little more money,
[02:41:56.790 --> 02:42:02.790]  and you know, then I would really recommend probably going with someone like Mean Gene or CSI.
[02:42:03.790 --> 02:42:06.790]  I'm trying to think, you know, there's a lot of breeders out there too,
[02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:12.790]  who I'm going to bring up my blog real quick, but are really underrated.
[02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:16.790]  Like you never hear about these guys. Boneyard Seeds.
[02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:19.790]  That guy is just a dude on Instagram.
[02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:24.790]  He's making some amazing seeds, working with incredible genetics.
[02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:28.790]  And some of these people are unbelievably generous.
[02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:31.790]  There you go, dude. Peter's rocking them.
[02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:34.790]  Dude, Filial Feel from Boneyard.
[02:42:35.790 --> 02:42:37.790]  That dude hooked me up.
[02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:42.790]  So, you know, I think I sent him a message saying like I wanted to trade with him or something.
[02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:46.790]  And he ended up just sending me some crazy package.
[02:42:47.790 --> 02:42:48.790]  And didn't want anything back.
[02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:51.790]  Like, you know, messaged him a couple times, didn't want anything.
[02:42:51.790 --> 02:42:54.790]  So there's like some people out there who aren't well known,
[02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:59.790]  and he's got amazing gear, just as good as anybody out there selling stuff.
[02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:03.790]  Oh, and the one, I'm sorry, I don't even know how I spaced about this dude,
[02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:08.790]  but Emerald Mountain Legacy with the Royal Kush, the Oil Spill,
[02:43:09.790 --> 02:43:11.790]  all those guys do amazing work.
[02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:13.790]  They've got incredible genetics.
[02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:17.790]  The Long Valley Royal Kush is one of my favorites of all time.
[02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:23.790]  And, I mean, Doc D, Doc D is doing really cool stuff.
[02:43:24.790 --> 02:43:28.790]  You know, it's like there's so many people now, and there's so many genetics,
[02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:35.790]  and it's almost hard to go wrong in a lot of ways.
[02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:40.790]  So, I mean, yeah, I could talk about the breeders, you know, forever.
[02:43:41.790 --> 02:43:46.790]  But probably those ones, Mean Gene, Bodhi, Emerald Mountain, CSF,
[02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:51.790]  CSI, and then all these underground guys like Boneyard.
[02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:54.790]  There's been some Hawaiian guys I've been trading with.
[02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:56.790]  Just guys all over.
[02:43:57.790 --> 02:44:01.790]  So, you know, if people are interested in it, like, find a cool male,
[02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:06.790]  make some seeds, put it on Instagram, and you will get messages.
[02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:12.790]  Like, you know, people, if you have seeds, doesn't matter what the cross is,
[02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:16.790]  it seems like people just start messaging you, people want them.
[02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:20.790]  So, I think it's a great way to kind of get in and start trading with people
[02:44:21.790 --> 02:44:23.790]  and building a good reputation.
[02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:29.790]  I have no doubt that you're going to experience what's known as the DM flood
[02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:31.790]  after this show airs, you know.
[02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:35.790]  You're going to be getting like 178 messages, and everybody's going to be like,
[02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:37.790]  hey, how come you don't hit me back?
[02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:39.790]  Yeah, everyone's going to want seeds.
[02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:44.790]  And, you know, I'll just let people know right now, too, you know, seeds,
[02:44:44.790 --> 02:44:46.790]  I don't sell any of my seeds.
[02:44:47.790 --> 02:44:52.790]  I do, you know, with people that I've communicated with before,
[02:44:53.790 --> 02:44:57.790]  or, you know, if you meet me in person or whatever, you're in Colorado,
[02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:59.790]  glad to swap and stuff.
[02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:01.790]  But Peter and I chatted a little bit.
[02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:05.790]  I just wanted to, I can vouch for that, because you definitely gifted me some seeds
[02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:09.790]  without, you know, kind of the same way you were just describing Mr. Toad.
[02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:11.790]  So, shout out to him.
[02:45:11.790 --> 02:45:16.790]  I feel like a lot of people in the community, there's just something about when you're,
[02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:19.790]  when you're gifting and you're genuine, how that kind of just continues down the road.
[02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:22.790]  And it seems like it just, it just opens up for everybody involved.
[02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:26.790]  So I appreciate everything that you've gifted me as well.
[02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:30.790]  And it's pretty cool to see it be full circle with somebody that I know
[02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:33.790]  that we love seeing each and every week, Mr. Toad.
[02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:35.790]  Feel the feel.
[02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:40.790]  Absolutely. I mean, I'm, you know, I mean, it's just like pay it forward, you know,
[02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:46.790]  like you said, this is, it's a weird community because there's a lot of people
[02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:49.790]  who are unbelievably cool and unbelievably generous.
[02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:55.790]  And then there's a lot of shady people who want to get out with,
[02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:57.790]  without giving anything.
[02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:59.790]  And, you know, they feel good.
[02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:04.790]  Like they feel like they get something out of that, you know, like, oh, I, you know,
[02:46:05.790 --> 02:46:06.790]  I really made out on that interaction.
[02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:11.790]  So there's a lot of shady people who, you know, will just, you know,
[02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:13.790]  they want free stuff and they disappear.
[02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:19.790]  And then there's tons of people who are there because they love this.
[02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:23.790]  And if you're interested in show interest,
[02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:29.790]  they're like more than glad to lend a hand and give you seeds and give you advice.
[02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:33.790]  And, you know, just unbelievable how helpful and generous some people are.
[02:46:33.790 --> 02:46:38.790]  So, yeah, you know, you kind of have to, I think if you get into this,
[02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:41.790]  you have to be generous and get burned a few times.
[02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:45.790]  But in the process, you're going to figure out who you want to deal with
[02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:48.790]  and who you don't want to deal with and who's worth it.
[02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:51.790]  And you start seeing people's characters.
[02:46:52.790 --> 02:47:00.790]  And so I don't know, I'm kind of on the tangent now, but, but yeah, I mean,
[02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:04.790]  you know, it's, it's all about passing that on, kind of paying it forward, Brian.
[02:47:05.790 --> 02:47:08.790]  So, you know, there's been plenty of people who mentioned them, you know,
[02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:10.790]  Mr. Toad, Mean Gene, guys like that,
[02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:14.790]  who just have been unbelievably generous to me.
[02:47:15.790 --> 02:47:19.790]  So, you know, when I find people who are into genetics, it's like, you know,
[02:47:20.790 --> 02:47:23.790]  sure, dude, I love making people's days and, you know,
[02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:26.790]  hooking them up with some really cool, cool seeds.
[02:47:27.790 --> 02:47:31.790]  And you know, me personally, if I was some kind of upper echelon breeder,
[02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:34.790]  I would want you to judge my stuff because I feel like, all right,
[02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:37.790]  what do I need to improve on? I feel like this would be a real critique
[02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:42.790]  because there's just so much fanboy stuff that if you are an artist like that,
[02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:45.790]  I don't really know how, unless you got a good surrounding,
[02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:49.790]  how you would really know what, what I feel like more of the older heads
[02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:52.790]  would be like, all right, that's something that you should keep working with.
[02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:55.790]  There's some of these guys seem like they're in this yes man bubble
[02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:58.790]  where everybody's like, these are, this is the hype, this is the hype.
[02:47:59.790 --> 02:48:01.790]  And that's what they continue to put out. And it's just the same genetics.
[02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:05.790]  You know, you see the same cultivars that, you know,
[02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:09.790]  a variety of these guys are working with. And I just want, you know,
[02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:12.790]  no disrespect or anything. I just feel like a lot of that stuff is the same.
[02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:14.790]  And so if you are somebody that's new to this,
[02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:18.790]  you probably want to do a little research so that you can maybe grow
[02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:21.790]  something that's different. So you kind of are a little bit different
[02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:24.790]  than the competition, especially when you first start out.
[02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:27.790]  So that people want to come to you. If you know,
[02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:30.790]  this is the reason why when no one had purple weed, you know,
[02:48:31.790 --> 02:48:34.790]  we were trying to grow and drive and make something happen of almost
[02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:37.790]  a five hour drive is because we were trying to get genetics that,
[02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:40.790]  especially at that time, nobody could get their hands on.
[02:48:41.790 --> 02:48:44.790]  Very few people would even show that on Instagram is that this purple weed.
[02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:47.790]  And then, you know, another guy that I really liked, his name is Bog.
[02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:51.790]  He recently passed away as well. But his genetics were another one of those
[02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:54.790]  things that when I started to understand living soil,
[02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:58.790]  just those full genetic profiles started to appear. And I was like, wow.
[02:48:59.790 --> 02:49:01.790]  I mean, obviously genetics make a huge difference.
[02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:05.790]  And I'd never seen that before because I was be honest with myself, you know,
[02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:08.790]  I'm growing mid, especially when we were doing aquaponics. I mean,
[02:49:09.790 --> 02:49:12.790]  that shit was like, we'd have to low ball everything just to be able to pay
[02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:17.790]  the Excel bills and stuff. So when I saw Bog's genetics, you know,
[02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:21.790]  the one that stood out for me was this blue moon rocks and had this purple
[02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:25.790]  and real faint bluish hues. I feel like that was where I,
[02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:30.790]  I want newer farmers to also get that, but not have to wait, you know,
[02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:33.790]  three or four years, wherever we were at to experience that for themselves,
[02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:37.790]  was to do the research and then grow the genetics that you feel like might be
[02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:39.790]  something that's going to be unique to set yourself apart.
[02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:42.790]  The hype stuff is going to be really hard. You're going to,
[02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:46.790]  you're way behind the scenes. I'm sorry. You're way behind the,
[02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:50.790]  the way the market is moving. If you are in, you know,
[02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:52.790]  today thinking about growing some hype genetics.
[02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:56.790]  Absolutely. I mean, if you want to be ahead of the game,
[02:49:57.790 --> 02:50:00.790]  then be on your own, do your own thing. Right. I mean,
[02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:04.790]  it's, it's a kind of a trip for me, you know,
[02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:09.790]  that you guys invited me on the show. Cause like I've, you know,
[02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:14.790]  since I've grown, I've just been a dude doing this cause I love it,
[02:50:15.790 --> 02:50:19.790]  you know, like in my basement or, you know, sometimes in my whole house,
[02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:23.790]  and it's like you know,
[02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:26.790]  I do it cause this is what I want to do and it's what interests me and compels
[02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:31.790]  me. And then all of a sudden, you know, you do that for a while and,
[02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:36.790]  people start throwing seeds at you and people start inviting you on podcasts
[02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:40.790]  and people start trying to throw money at you for seeds. And it's like,
[02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:46.790]  you know, if, if I had been on the hype train for 10 years,
[02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:47.790]  instead of doing my own thing,
[02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:52.790]  then I would just be some other dude growing hype weed out there. Right.
[02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:53.790]  Like you guys wouldn't want to interview me.
[02:50:53.790 --> 02:50:55.790]  Like the people here probably wouldn't want to,
[02:50:56.790 --> 02:51:01.790]  they wouldn't think I had anything interesting to say. So, you know, that's,
[02:51:01.790 --> 02:51:06.790]  that's something that like, and to be totally honest, I, you know,
[02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:10.790]  I would, I kind of followed even the underground hype at some,
[02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:15.790]  at some points. But that would be my advice is like,
[02:51:15.790 --> 02:51:18.790]  if you have really unique flavors or,
[02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:21.790]  and you want to get into seed making,
[02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:27.790]  don't make what you think people are going to be really into.
[02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:31.790]  Make what you're really into. Yeah.
[02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:36.790]  And you'll, you'll just be so much happier with the results.
[02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:41.790]  And it's like a piece of self-expression that, you know,
[02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:45.790]  to me it's like a little bit magical. I think when we,
[02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:49.790]  just as a general life rule if you're doing things because you think you should
[02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:55.790]  be doing them or whatever it's got a totally different outcome and way that it
[02:51:56.790 --> 02:52:00.790]  affects the world than if you do something because you think it's right or you
[02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:05.790]  think it's good or you think it's going to produce good. Like if it's,
[02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:10.790]  if it really comes from your soul I think, you know,
[02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:12.790]  whether it's breeding or life or whatever,
[02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:18.790]  like it's going to have such a bigger and more meaningful impact maybe in ways
[02:52:18.790 --> 02:52:22.790]  that you can never even understand, you know,
[02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:26.790]  than if you do things for other people or for appearances or whatever.
[02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:29.790]  So that's my, my cheesy advice for the day.
[02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.790]  Yeah. And I think, I think it relates to other things. I mean, for me with music,
[02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:36.790]  I'm the same way where it's like, I have my own tastes.
[02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:40.790]  I have my conviction about, I don't care if other people don't like my tastes.
[02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:44.790]  I'm always listening to stuff, you know,
[02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:48.790]  that's out there and people I respect being like, okay, what are they into?
[02:52:48.790 --> 02:52:51.790]  And being like, okay, I like that. I don't really like that.
[02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:54.790]  But just staying on your own path.
[02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:59.790]  Yes. Amen to that. Amen. And not to change the subject,
[02:52:59.790 --> 02:53:02.790]  but do you guys ever remember seeing the weed,
[02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:04.790]  the green weed that had purple hairs in it?
[02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:06.790]  And dating yourself again. And we used to get, Peter,
[02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:08.790]  we used to get it up in your hood.
[02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:13.790]  That was the only place I ever found it, but it was crazy.
[02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:15.790]  I used to know it in Miller Hill Road.
[02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:23.790]  The only experience I had had with that was actually in high school,
[02:53:23.790 --> 02:53:27.790]  you know, in the Midwest, there was, someone said it came from California.
[02:53:27.790 --> 02:53:32.790]  And then we got, we got a pound of this reverse weed.
[02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:39.790]  And it was this really bright green bud and it had purple and pink pistols on
[02:53:39.790 --> 02:53:43.790]  it. And, you know, we had never seen anything like it.
[02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:48.790]  And it had to this day, it's the closest thing, you know,
[02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:52.790]  I don't know if roadkill is even real to be honest at this point,
[02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:55.790]  but it smelled like straight roadkill skunk.
[02:53:56.790 --> 02:53:59.790]  And it was the only time I saw it, only time I experienced it,
[02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:01.790]  but unbelievably beautiful.
[02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:06.790]  I'd love to get some of that again. Totally. That was one of my favorites for sure.
[02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:12.790]  The folklore with that is that it was so skunky that you had to breed that
[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:17.790]  away. And that's why nobody really has it anymore is because everybody had to
[02:54:17.790 --> 02:54:20.790]  start breeding it a little bit less because it was getting everybody in
[02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:21.790]  trouble with how far.
[02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:24.790]  Yeah. You got caught because it's skunk.
[02:54:25.790 --> 02:54:26.790]  Yeah. I mean, it was like,
[02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:28.790]  what do you have a dead skunk in your house permanently?
[02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:33.790]  I mean, I was just trying to hide it for my jars for my, my mom, you know?
[02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:37.790]  And it's like, I couldn't do it. Like it was sketchy for me.
[02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:41.790]  I had to keep it in a jar, not touch the lid after I touched the bud.
[02:54:41.790 --> 02:54:43.790]  And I, you know, when I had friends over,
[02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:45.790]  I wouldn't even open the jar in the house to show them.
[02:54:45.790 --> 02:54:50.790]  Cause it was, it was too crazy. And so I, I mean,
[02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:53.790]  I can totally see that back in the nineties or late two thousands.
[02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:58.790]  Yeah. It came in a double wrapped seal meal was the way it came.
[02:54:59.790 --> 02:55:02.790]  Cause it was just even, even in a seal meal, you could smell the fucking shit.
[02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:07.790]  Yeah. I remember that was how you would almost sell skunks to each other back
[02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:11.790]  in the day is to open up the jar. Now it's called like loud basically.
[02:55:11.790 --> 02:55:14.790]  So how loud is it? And if you could open up the jar and just,
[02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:16.790]  it starts to reek, then obviously, you know,
[02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:21.790]  that was really more of what sold it was just that if it had that specific
[02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:22.790]  skunks funk.
[02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:26.790]  Totally. Totally.
[02:55:29.790 --> 02:55:31.790]  Well, do we have a, do we have questions for Jim?
[02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:35.790]  I know at the three hour mark, everybody's kind of like,
[02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:42.790]  all right. If anyone has questions, throw them up there.
[02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:43.790]  Yeah. People are riffing.
[02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:47.790]  People are talking about kind of what they're personally going for.
[02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:53.790]  Blue wants floral and citrus.
[02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:58.790]  Someone has brain overload.
[02:56:13.390 --> 02:56:14.390]  That's awesome.
[02:56:14.390 --> 02:56:20.160]  From Jack and actually this reminds me, you know,
[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:22.160]  the last time you were on was I tried to,
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:27.160]  I thought conceptually it'd be cool to have a breeder on and then you know,
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:31.160]  conceptually it'd be cool to have a breeder on and then a bunch of people who
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:34.160]  have actually grown that person's stuff just kind of,
[02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:39.160]  and from different places like indoor, outdoor, New England, Colorado,
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:40.160]  SoCal,
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:46.160]  and just sharing stories and giving feedback to that breeder.
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:51.160]  I want to do more of those, which I think would be cool.
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:53.160]  Totally. Yeah, no, it was,
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:56.160]  it was awesome for me to be able to come on with mean gene, you know,
[02:56:57.160 --> 02:56:59.160]  I, you know, as much of his stuff that I've grown,
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.160]  I really haven't gotten to talk much shop with him.
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:08.160]  And I certainly look up to him, you know, in the cannabis industry.
[02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:12.160]  So it's very cool to, you know,
[02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:14.160]  have the opportunity to come on the show with them.
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:19.620]  Oh, that's, that's very sweet of Robin Thomas.
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:26.620]  I'm glad that glad that people are getting benefits from the information.
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:32.620]  You see that question? Yeah. My, my thoughts on auto flowers.
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:38.620]  You know, I think it's awesome that the convenience of them.
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:46.620]  I hate to say I've never really enjoyed like smoking much auto flower.
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.620]  Not that I don't enjoy it. You know, I'm not going to smoke it.
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:53.620]  And like, if I don't have weed and you give me a bag of auto flower,
[02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:57.620]  but I'm not going to be like, Oh, you know, I'm too good for this.
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:01.620]  But if it's sitting next to my own jars of, you know,
[02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:07.620]  homegrown OGs and freeborn and some sativas and stuff like I'm going to pick
[02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:08.620]  those every time.
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:13.620]  So I do think it's really convenient the way that auto flowers grow.
[02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:18.620]  I just, I, and part of it's maybe that I just haven't smoked very many,
[02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:24.620]  but the few that I have smoked, I just thought they were, they were, again,
[02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:28.620]  they were pretty generic. There was no standout turps, no standout effects.
[02:58:29.620 --> 02:58:33.620]  It seems like those are more catered to cultivators than they are to consumers.
[02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:38.620]  Yeah. I think it's going to be a while before that catches up with some of the,
[02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:41.620]  you know, the regular non-reals.
[02:58:43.620 --> 02:58:46.620]  I counted. Did I throw that? No, I did throw this up, right?
[02:58:47.620 --> 02:58:52.620]  Yeah. No, I didn't address it at all. My favorite freeborn selections.
[02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:56.620]  I mean, you know, it's always tough to answer the question favorite,
[02:58:57.620 --> 02:58:59.620]  especially with cannabis because of the diversity.
[02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:03.620]  But I can definitely tell you some of the most memorable.
[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:05.620]  So, you know,
[02:59:05.620 --> 02:59:10.620]  the one that really put Mean Gene on the map for me personally was In the Pines
[02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:13.620]  that he released through Aficionado.
[02:59:15.620 --> 02:59:19.620]  And I had, I had really never experienced anything like that.
[02:59:19.620 --> 02:59:23.620]  I think it must have some CBD in there. It's just, it's amazing effect.
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:24.620]  Amazing, amazing, amazing.
[02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:30.620]  And the flavor is like super unique and super intense.
[02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:35.620]  You know, it's not like a, Oh, it smells kind of like pineapple. It's like,
[02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:40.620]  dude, this tastes like I'm smoking pineapple syrup.
[02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:42.620]  So, you know,
[02:59:42.620 --> 02:59:46.620]  that's a really incredible experience that really made In the Pines stand out.
[02:59:46.620 --> 02:59:50.620]  And he has since released Pina, which is the father to In the Pines.
[02:59:52.620 --> 02:59:54.620]  And I hate to say that's been sitting in my fridge for years.
[02:59:55.620 --> 02:59:58.620]  I really want to make a big increase with those seeds and I just haven't gotten
[02:59:58.620 --> 02:59:59.620]  to it yet.
[03:00:00.620 --> 03:00:03.620]  Don't you have seeds, the cherry limeade cross with the Pina?
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:06.620]  I've got seeds of the cherry limeade Pina,
[03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:11.620]  and then I've also got Pina in it or sorry, pure Pina.
[03:00:11.620 --> 03:00:15.620]  So I've got both of those and I've grown the cherry limeade cross the Pina,
[03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:19.620]  but I haven't grown the pure Pina yet, but I definitely need to get to those.
[03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:21.620]  Those are super, super special.
[03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:26.620]  And then really, you know, the thing mean gene's known for is, is lime.
[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:31.620]  And he's got, you know, a million different versions of lime.
[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:35.620]  And it's really cool to kind of go through the different ones,
[03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:37.620]  but the best tasting,
[03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:41.620]  weed I think I've ever smoked is one of his new lime crosses.
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:45.620]  It's new lime crossed to macrotte mandarin crossed to lime pop.
[03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:52.620]  And it tastes like you're smoking lime rind or like a lime soda.
[03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:57.620]  It's just, it's really intense, really unusual.
[03:00:59.620 --> 03:01:02.620]  And so, I mean, you know, he's just, he's a, he's a,
[03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:04.620]  he's a really good guy.
[03:01:04.620 --> 03:01:06.620]  And so, I mean, you know, he's, he's just,
[03:01:06.620 --> 03:01:08.620]  his whole lineup is kind of like that, you know,
[03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:12.620]  everything he smoked from him is it's just very, very unique.
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:15.620]  You're not going to find that experience elsewhere.
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:20.620]  So, you know, if you're getting something from mean gene yeah,
[03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:24.620]  I would look for his lime. I've heard amazing things about his cherry west.
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:30.620]  And I mean, hard, hard to go wrong with him.
[03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:33.620]  I think everything I've had from him has been really impressive.
[03:01:36.620 --> 03:01:39.620]  Here's a breeding question.
[03:01:40.620 --> 03:01:43.620]  What, or if you can tell a story of something that you crossed with
[03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:47.620]  something else that had outcomes that were disastrous or.
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:51.620]  Sure. Yup. Yeah. The most disastrous.
[03:01:52.620 --> 03:01:54.620]  I might take a toke before, before I delved into this.
[03:01:54.620 --> 03:02:03.500]  So the most disastrous experience that I had
[03:02:06.500 --> 03:02:08.500]  was probably with a, a Herm run
[03:02:10.500 --> 03:02:12.500]  because I made several thousand seeds.
[03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:15.500]  It was probably my biggest seed run I've ever done.
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:18.500]  And none of them were used usable at all.
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:23.500]  And what that was, was some of my own seeds
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  from my, the first pollination I had ever done.
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:29.500]  Was using a Greedo stash male from Bodie.
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:32.500]  And I hit a couple of clones.
[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:36.500]  One of them was one of my all-time favorites, a 707 headband.
[03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:40.500]  And I grew a bunch of those seeds.
[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:46.500]  And some of them were amazing, like amazing, great smoke, stable,
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:48.500]  all that stuff.
[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:52.500]  And then some other ones were not stable and they ended up being
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:53.500]  super bad.
[03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:57.500]  And I left my grow, you know, I went like to the mountains
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.500]  for a bit or something and, you know, left it behind.
[03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:04.500]  And of course I come back and I think two or three of the
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:08.500]  females were just covered in male flowers, pollinated the
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:10.500]  whole room.
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:14.500]  So, you know, it was like several lights worth that were
[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:18.500]  just full of seeds from, from the, from the, from the
[03:03:18.500 --> 03:03:19.500]  hermgenetics.
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:21.500]  So that sucked.
[03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:23.500]  That's like the biggest horror story.
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:27.500]  But as far as advice for males, you know, it'd be like if you
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:31.500]  know a strain herms like that, like don't use a male from that
[03:03:32.500 --> 03:03:33.500]  strain cultivar, sorry.
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:37.500]  It's like, I, I'm not gonna, I might pick a stable female
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.500]  from that line and clone it and breed with that one.
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:45.500]  But I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:48.500]  gonna pick a male when I know it's sisters.
[03:03:49.500 --> 03:03:52.500]  Several of them have hermaphroditic tendencies.
[03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:56.500]  That male probably does as well and he's probably gonna pass
[03:03:57.500 --> 03:03:58.500]  on the gene.
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:03.500]  So, you know, the, the thing to me is like, and I also
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:07.500]  avoid males that are on the extremes.
[03:04:08.500 --> 03:04:11.500]  So a lot of guys will, you know, they'll, they'll, they'll
[03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:14.500]  look for the biggest male, you know, the one that's the
[03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:18.500]  biggest yielding, or they look for the stinkiest one, or they
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:22.500]  look for the most vigorous or I don't do that.
[03:04:23.500 --> 03:04:27.500]  I will look for the one that represents his sisters that
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:29.500]  I enjoyed the most.
[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:33.500]  And there's reason to believe that, you know, that's not
[03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:35.500]  the case.
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:39.500]  But I do look for the male that's the biggest yielding.
[03:04:39.500 --> 03:04:42.500]  And there's reason to believe that, you know, there might be
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:44.500]  some error with that.
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:47.500]  Like there's some traits that are tied to males.
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:50.500]  So they might not even express in the females.
[03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:54.500]  So if I'm looking for a male that looks like the female I
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:57.500]  like, it might actually look different.
[03:04:58.500 --> 03:04:59.500]  If that makes sense.
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:05.500]  But losing my train of thought after that toke.
[03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:07.500]  But.
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:08.500]  Well, yeah.
[03:05:09.500 --> 03:05:11.500]  So, yeah, you know, I mean, so, so that's, that's the thing
[03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:16.500]  though, is if you like the males that I pick are based
[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:18.500]  on, do I like it?
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:20.500]  Sisters?
[03:05:20.500 --> 03:05:21.500]  Have I grown those?
[03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:22.500]  Have I seen them?
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:23.500]  What traits do they have?
[03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:27.500]  Because the odds are, then if you pick a good male, he's
[03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:30.500]  going to pass down all those traits, all the same traits
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:33.500]  that's in the majority of the population of the females.
[03:05:33.500 --> 03:05:36.500]  So if you like the females, chances are their brother is
[03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:38.500]  going to be a great male selection.
[03:05:39.500 --> 03:05:42.500]  And the reason I don't pick, pick males on the extreme end
[03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:45.500]  of things is because I have not found females on the extreme
[03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:48.500]  end of things to be my favorite to smoke.
[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:53.500]  You know, the biggest females, the most vigorous, the ones
[03:05:54.500 --> 03:06:00.500]  with like the prettiest flowers usually are not the one, not
[03:06:00.500 --> 03:06:03.500]  the jars that you end up pulling down again and again and
[03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:05.500]  again.
[03:06:05.500 --> 03:06:09.500]  Usually those are maybe like the keeper plants might be like
[03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:13.500]  in the top 80th percentile of vigor, but really you need to,
[03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:16.500]  you need to vet them by smoking it, by seeing the finished
[03:06:17.500 --> 03:06:18.500]  flower, smelling it.
[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.500]  Does it have, is it complex?
[03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:22.500]  Is it one dimensional?
[03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:26.500]  Is the effect generic or is it something that you, you just
[03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:29.500]  even unconsciously you'll go after that jar again and again
[03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:31.500]  and again.
[03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:34.500]  So I really like to see the females and then I'll go back
[03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:36.500]  and pick out the brothers.
[03:06:37.500 --> 03:06:38.500]  Usually that's what I look for in a male.
[03:06:39.500 --> 03:06:40.500]  There's some good advice.
[03:06:42.500 --> 03:06:43.500]  Gold bar.
[03:06:44.500 --> 03:06:50.030]  You know, easy way to pollinate a small area.
[03:06:51.030 --> 03:06:56.030]  I mean, the easiest way is stick a male in there, you know,
[03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:58.030]  just let them, let them chill.
[03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:59.030]  Just, you know, have the male chill.
[03:07:00.030 --> 03:07:01.030]  Good way of putting it.
[03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:03.030]  Let them chill.
[03:07:04.030 --> 03:07:05.030]  Yeah.
[03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:07.030]  I mean, it's, they don't Netflix, but they grow light and chill.
[03:07:08.030 --> 03:07:10.030]  You know, it's like, stick the male in there with all the
[03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:12.030]  females.
[03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:15.030]  If you have a fan going, he's going to pollinate everything.
[03:07:16.030 --> 03:07:19.030]  If you have a larger space somewhere in that home or
[03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:23.030]  property or whatever that you don't want to pollinate, that
[03:07:24.030 --> 03:07:25.030]  can be dangerous.
[03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:28.030]  So my favorite way to pollinate actually is, you know, I'll
[03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:30.030]  grow out all my seeds.
[03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:35.030]  I like to pollinate best I can in the spring and fall, but
[03:07:36.030 --> 03:07:38.030]  you grow out all your seeds in the spring, just the way you
[03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:40.030]  normally would.
[03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:43.030]  And as soon as you've got males identified that you want to
[03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:48.030]  use, go inside and put them under 12, 12, or you can even
[03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:50.030]  do this early winter.
[03:07:51.030 --> 03:07:54.030]  So now in like March, April, May, you've got them in the
[03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:56.030]  ground and they're good to go.
[03:07:57.030 --> 03:08:00.030]  You can have a male vegged up that you know you want to use,
[03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:02.030]  put them on 12, 12.
[03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:06.030]  They'll start flowering and you can then stick them outside and
[03:08:07.030 --> 03:08:09.030]  the males will just keep flowering and they'll keep
[03:08:10.030 --> 03:08:11.030]  producing pollen.
[03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:14.030]  So, you know, as early as March here in Colorado, I can have a
[03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:17.030]  male on my deck producing pollen.
[03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:21.030]  I can collect that and save it for later, or I can cut off
[03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:24.030]  the pollen and put it in the, you know, the, the, the
[03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:26.030]  small areas, selected rooms.
[03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:29.030]  You know, very small areas of the rest of my home.
[03:08:30.030 --> 03:08:33.030]  And if he's out on my deck, that pollen's not, you know, it
[03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:36.030]  doesn't make its way indoor to my area.
[03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:41.030]  So, so that, that's, that's how I do things is, you know, if
[03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:45.030]  you have a way to isolate a male, and if you can't dedicate
[03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:49.030]  a tent or something to do that, then put them in 12, 12, get
[03:08:49.030 --> 03:08:51.030]  them out of the room, collect the pollen.
[03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:54.030]  And in the meanwhile, while he's outside, you have some females
[03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:56.030]  going now inside.
[03:08:57.030 --> 03:09:00.030]  So just kind of trying to create that isolated space for the
[03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:04.360]  male, get him in the tent or otherwise collect pollen.
[03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:08.360]  Cool.
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:11.830]  Good advice.
[03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:14.830]  Well, Peter, I hate to break up the party, but I have to
[03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:16.830]  scoot.
[03:09:16.830 --> 03:09:19.830]  I got another appointment and like almost now.
[03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:22.830]  So I'm going to bow out, but you guys can keep rolling as
[03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:24.830]  long as you want.
[03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:26.830]  All right.
[03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:28.830]  Why don't we take another question or two?
[03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:30.830]  Thanks, Leighton.
[03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:31.830]  Appreciate it.
[03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:32.830]  Thank you.
[03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:34.830]  Nice to meet you, brother.
[03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:35.830]  Keep up the good work.
[03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:37.830]  Yeah, you too.
[03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:38.830]  Appreciate it.
[03:09:38.830 --> 03:09:39.830]  Bye.
[03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:42.830]  Someone asked if you have any thoughts or experience on
[03:09:43.830 --> 03:09:45.830]  triploids, but I'm looking for the.
[03:09:46.830 --> 03:09:47.830]  Yeah.
[03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:48.830]  Yeah, I do.
[03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:52.830]  I mean, Oregon CBD is going to come on at the end of the
[03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:55.830]  season to talk about it, but go for it.
[03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:58.830]  OK, he'll probably have more to say.
[03:09:59.830 --> 03:10:01.830]  I haven't worked with a ton of numbers.
[03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:05.830]  Triploids, in my experience, are generally pretty, pretty
[03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:07.830]  slow growing.
[03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:10.830]  They're usually lacking in vigor.
[03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:14.830]  Sometimes they can kind of come out of it if you've had them
[03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:17.830]  long enough and then they catch up to everything else.
[03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:19.830]  My experience is that they're lacking on vigor.
[03:10:20.830 --> 03:10:22.830]  And, you know, I.
[03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:24.830]  Yeah.
[03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:26.830]  So this is the extent of my experience, Matthew, with
[03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:28.830]  triploids.
[03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:30.830]  They haven't been very vigorous.
[03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:34.830]  I have bred with some and I've even had those tested.
[03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:38.830]  And guys have told me, you know, the quality was really
[03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:40.830]  great of the smoke.
[03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:43.830]  But they did remark like, oh, yeah, they were kind of slow
[03:10:44.830 --> 03:10:45.830]  growing or kind of run to you or whatever.
[03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:49.830]  So I think that triploids can they can they can certainly be
[03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:52.830]  nice quality from the consumer point of view.
[03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:57.830]  But as a cultivator, you can definitely find something with
[03:10:58.830 --> 03:11:02.830]  the quality of a triploid plant, but also with normal or even
[03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:04.830]  above average vigor.
[03:11:05.830 --> 03:11:09.830]  So to me, my experience is that there's not really a reason to
[03:11:10.830 --> 03:11:11.830]  breed with them.
[03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:15.830]  But I could be I'm certainly open to hearing from people if
[03:11:16.830 --> 03:11:18.830]  they've had experiences different than that.
[03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:23.830]  And if there's a valuable genetics in triploids, I'd be
[03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:25.830]  very keen to hear about it.
[03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:30.830]  So and here back to the last question.
[03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:32.830]  No.
[03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:34.830]  Yeah.
[03:11:34.830 --> 03:11:35.830]  Not in my experience.
[03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:39.830]  So Solshine is asking about, you know, if longer light exposure
[03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:43.830]  stops pollen production and puts the male into reveg.
[03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:45.830]  That's not my experience.
[03:11:46.830 --> 03:11:49.830]  In my experience, if you have a male that is already producing
[03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:54.830]  flowers because you put them in 12-12 indoor, if you put them
[03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:56.830]  outside, he'll just keep flowering.
[03:11:57.830 --> 03:12:00.830]  They just they'll keep producing pollen and they flower just in
[03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:04.830]  essence and he'll eventually just kind of, you know, yellow out
[03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:06.830]  and.
[03:12:06.830 --> 03:12:07.830]  And dry up.
[03:12:07.830 --> 03:12:08.830]  But.
[03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:12.830]  But, yeah, I know you can definitely put them outside, like I
[03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:16.830]  said, as early as March and I've finished flowering and collecting
[03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:21.830]  pollen. And that's how I had such a prolific year of pollination
[03:12:22.830 --> 03:12:23.830]  last year, was doing just that.
[03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:33.830]  Sorry, my wife was calling.
[03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:35.830]  Me.
[03:12:36.830 --> 03:12:37.830]  Any other questions?
[03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:43.830]  I'm sorry, would Mac fall into that category of the triploid,
[03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:45.830]  right? That's what he's talking about.
[03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:48.830]  Probably not.
[03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:52.830]  I'm guessing Mac is not a triploid.
[03:12:54.830 --> 03:12:55.830]  You know, triple.
[03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:59.830]  I mean, you might be able to find triploids in Mac seeds, but I
[03:12:59.830 --> 03:13:00.830]  doubt anyone would keep those clones.
[03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:04.830]  They're just very slow growing and not not generally impressive.
[03:13:06.830 --> 03:13:09.830]  And let's see if there are any last questions.
[03:13:16.210 --> 03:13:17.210]  Three hours and 13 minutes in.
[03:13:20.210 --> 03:13:23.210]  So in addition to me, one of you making a Hawaiian road trip.
[03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:28.210]  Don Irie, if that's an invitation to Kauai.
[03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:30.210]  I'm not sure.
[03:13:30.210 --> 03:13:31.210]  Next week, my friend.
[03:13:31.210 --> 03:13:35.210]  I mean, I would love to to head out there and smoke some island bud
[03:13:36.210 --> 03:13:37.210]  and get to see some island plants.
[03:13:38.210 --> 03:13:41.210]  And, you know, I've heard nothing but good things about the Hawaiian
[03:13:42.210 --> 03:13:44.210]  people. So I would love to come see the culture.
[03:13:45.210 --> 03:13:46.210]  I've never been down there.
[03:13:47.210 --> 03:13:48.210]  So do you know there are any.
[03:13:49.210 --> 03:13:50.210]  Let me know about Kauai, Don Irie.
[03:13:54.830 --> 03:13:56.830]  Do you do any home tissue culture in?
[03:13:58.830 --> 03:13:59.830]  I don't know.
[03:13:59.830 --> 03:14:01.830]  And the only reason I don't is because I'm ignorant to it.
[03:14:02.830 --> 03:14:07.830]  I've got a book on tissue culture and I just have not taken the time
[03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:12.830]  to sit down and get hands on experience and learn about it.
[03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:18.830]  So I do think tissue culture is going to be the future of genetic
[03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:20.830]  libraries.
[03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:24.830]  I think it'd be a great boon to guys like me who could just keep
[03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:27.830]  tons of cultivars around without, you know,
[03:14:28.830 --> 03:14:31.830]  a dedicated veg space or all the hassle that comes with repeated
[03:14:32.830 --> 03:14:33.830]  cloning.
[03:14:34.830 --> 03:14:37.830]  So, no, I don't do tissue culture and I really wish I did.
[03:14:38.830 --> 03:14:39.830]  And I wish I knew how.
[03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:44.830]  We got a Dutch.
[03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:49.230]  Cultivar question.
[03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:54.880]  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer that.
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:55.880]  Cultivar question.
[03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:00.880]  Do I think about Dutch cannabis quality?
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:02.880]  You know, it's like everywhere else.
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:04.880]  There's very high quality stuff.
[03:15:05.880 --> 03:15:08.880]  There's very bad quality stuff and there's everything in between.
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:15.880]  That being said, they definitely do have a,
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:17.880]  you know, they do have a.
[03:15:20.880 --> 03:15:22.880]  Sorry, dude, I shouldn't watch the comments while I answer this.
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:23.880]  What was the question again? I'm all stoned.
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:25.880]  I don't remember.
[03:15:26.880 --> 03:15:27.880]  Oh, Dutch genetics.
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:30.880]  Sorry?
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:32.880]  I think Dutch genetics.
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:34.880]  The quality of it.
[03:15:35.880 --> 03:15:36.880]  Yeah. You know,
[03:15:37.880 --> 03:15:39.880]  it's interesting because they do sativa as well.
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:44.880]  I feel like they've got some really unique hazes and some,
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:48.880]  you know, like I said, I got to smoke pure Thai, pure Cambodian,
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:50.880]  pure Laotian over there.
[03:15:50.880 --> 03:15:52.880]  And there's some of the most memorable smokes in my life.
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:15:54.880]  And I mean that really genuinely,
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:15:58.880]  like I've never had anything like them since then or before then.
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:01.880]  So stuff like that is a total highlight.
[03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:03.880]  That being said,
[03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:07.880]  you have to look hard for stuff like that in Amsterdam.
[03:16:08.880 --> 03:16:12.880]  When you go to, and I don't know Dutch culture outside of Amsterdam.
[03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:16.880]  So it might be different in other cities,
[03:16:16.880 --> 03:16:19.880]  but my experience was the quality is pretty mediocre.
[03:16:20.880 --> 03:16:23.880]  If you want something like an OG, that's very American.
[03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:28.880]  Like you're going to get better OG in probably every state in this
[03:16:29.880 --> 03:16:30.880]  country than anywhere in Amsterdam.
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:34.880]  So, you know, it's really about what you're looking for.
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:38.880]  If you want something older, like the AK, the skunk one,
[03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:40.880]  you're going to get better OG.
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:42.880]  And if you want something older,
[03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:45.880]  like the AK, the skunk one, yeah, there you go.
[03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:49.880]  Neville's, Hayes, yeah, everything I just mentioned, right.
[03:16:50.880 --> 03:16:53.880]  Sativa's, Hayes, skunk, like all the old stuff.
[03:16:54.880 --> 03:16:57.880]  The Netherlands is a great, great place to go.
[03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:01.880]  You know, you can find all those seeds.
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:04.880]  They've been breeding those seeds for forever.
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:07.880]  And all those genetics are alive and well over there.
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:11.880]  So, you know, it's really about what you're looking for.
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:13.880]  It's just a unique place.
[03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:15.880]  It's kind of a bubble.
[03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:17.880]  But yeah, they've got some really unique Sativas.
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:20.880]  They've got import hash, which is cool.
[03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:23.880]  You know, as an American, we don't get, obviously,
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:25.880]  hash from the Middle East imported.
[03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:29.880]  And so it was cool for me to get over there and smoke, you know,
[03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:33.880]  all the import hash and get to experience some of that.
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:38.880]  But, you know, if you're after flower and you're like,
[03:17:39.880 --> 03:17:40.880]  consider yourself a flower connoisseur,
[03:17:40.880 --> 03:17:43.880]  I think that you can do a lot better, you know,
[03:17:44.880 --> 03:17:47.880]  on the West Coast of the United States than you could in the Netherlands.
[03:17:48.880 --> 03:17:53.140]  Just smoking, you know.
[03:17:54.140 --> 03:17:55.140]  Yeah, man. Well said.
[03:17:56.140 --> 03:18:02.120]  Well, my boys upstairs, I can hear him jumping up and down on the bed.
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:05.120]  So I appreciate your time, Jim.
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:07.120]  If nobody has any other questions,
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:10.120]  we can kind of do some house cleaning if you want, Peter,
[03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.120]  and wrap it up.
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:15.120]  What's today, Thursday?
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:21.120]  Yeah, my mind's, I haven't eaten anything all day.
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:23.120]  It's hot.
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:27.120]  That's the last thing Jim and I talked about was intermittent fasting
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:30.120]  because I haven't eaten anything either, but I feel fantastic.
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:32.120]  Hell yeah.
[03:18:33.120 --> 03:18:37.120]  I've been chewing. I found a piece of, so I brought,
[03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:40.120]  I bought Gemma gum,
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:42.120]  and I made her try Big Red from,
[03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:45.120]  from when I was little.
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:49.120]  So she could experience some old school flavors,
[03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:53.120]  but, and then I found it in my desk drawer.
[03:18:54.120 --> 03:18:55.120]  So that's what I've been.
[03:18:56.120 --> 03:18:57.120]  I barely ever chew gum,
[03:18:58.120 --> 03:19:01.120]  but chewing some Big Red for the past three hours.
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:04.120]  And it has zero taste right now.
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:07.120]  But I'm going to try it.
[03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:10.120]  I think Mr. Toad's going to do, and by the way, Mr. Toad,
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:12.120]  if you bowed out,
[03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:16.120]  Jim had some very kind things to say about you as a breeder.
[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:22.120]  And he's hopefully going to do an STS tutorial with Alex Hardy
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:27.120]  as his student who can ask these smart questions
[03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:30.120]  that I definitely cannot ask.
[03:19:31.120 --> 03:19:33.120]  So I'm going to try to do a little bit of a,
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:36.120]  I'm going to ask the smart questions that I definitely cannot ask.
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:41.120]  And what are we, Brian, next, next Thursday, we have,
[03:19:42.120 --> 03:19:45.120]  someone asked about Steve Cantwell. When's he coming back on?
[03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:49.120]  So that would be next week. We're going to talk about,
[03:19:50.120 --> 03:19:54.120]  I see a few other people out there, maybe in good, in goodwill,
[03:19:55.120 --> 03:19:59.120]  but it seems like they're going out of their way to work with sales brands.
[03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:02.120]  The salesman is the one that's educating.
[03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:06.120]  And so I got a lot of questions about indoor lighting.
[03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:10.120]  And so I reached out to three guys that are currently growing,
[03:20:11.120 --> 03:20:12.120]  not just trying to sell lights.
[03:20:13.120 --> 03:20:14.120]  So we have Green Bodhi coming back on the show.
[03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:16.120]  All three of these guys have already been on the show, by the way.
[03:20:17.120 --> 03:20:19.120]  So shout out to Green Bodhi, shout out to Steve Cantwell,
[03:20:20.120 --> 03:20:21.120]  and shout out to Joshua Steensland.
[03:20:22.120 --> 03:20:24.120]  So next week we'll be talking with three of the guys, like I said,
[03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:29.120]  that I feel like are not only being pioneers with their respective
[03:20:29.120 --> 03:20:33.120]  growing methods and that kind of stuff, but also a voice in this community.
[03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:37.120]  And I'm excited to hear three of their opinions on this kind of stuff,
[03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:41.120]  because I don't want to speak for them, but I do feel like, you know,
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:43.120]  they're kind of the future of this.
[03:20:44.120 --> 03:20:45.120]  And so if they're running with all of this technology,
[03:20:46.120 --> 03:20:49.120]  then I feel like the community needs to listen to three of my, again,
[03:20:50.120 --> 03:20:52.120]  my opinion, some of the brightest minds on the subject.
[03:20:53.120 --> 03:20:55.120]  That's not a salesman. That's not somebody that's going to be out there
[03:20:56.120 --> 03:20:57.120]  just trying to bullshit you. So you buy their brand.
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:00.120]  They're going to actually talk about their experiences,
[03:21:01.120 --> 03:21:03.120]  which I feel like is invaluable, especially if you're starting out.
[03:21:04.120 --> 03:21:06.120]  Well, it's also interesting to hear the perspective of,
[03:21:07.120 --> 03:21:10.120]  I think it'd be cool to get a, maybe not this time, but a home grower too,
[03:21:11.120 --> 03:21:13.120]  because I feel like if you're growing for commercial, well,
[03:21:14.120 --> 03:21:18.120]  actually I guess Josh is like, Steve's a commercial grower,
[03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:22.120]  but the other guys are kind of doing smaller scale stuff just because
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:26.120]  there's such a flood of like super cheap LED brands.
[03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:29.120]  And then you have the more expensive LED brand, you have the HPS.
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:31.120]  So it's like, if you're a home grower,
[03:21:32.120 --> 03:21:34.120]  can you just buy some cheap lights and get by,
[03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:38.120]  if you have kind of your soil humming and other stuff and save money on that
[03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:40.120]  front?
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:42.120]  Especially on the,
[03:21:43.120 --> 03:21:46.120]  at the commercial level because if you are running double enders or something
[03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:49.120]  like that, just the cooling aspects alone become a nightmare.
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:52.120]  So, you know, if you were going to talk about LEDs,
[03:21:53.120 --> 03:21:54.120]  then who else would you want to learn from?
[03:21:55.120 --> 03:21:59.120]  So I, I'm so excited that all three of them wanted to be a part of this.
[03:22:00.120 --> 03:22:04.120]  And do you have a commercial operation or are you just doing stuff at home?
[03:22:05.120 --> 03:22:09.120]  No, I don't. So yeah, I'm a total home grower.
[03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:14.120]  You know, I, I don't have any indoor garden right now,
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:18.120]  but generally generally I have at least one and I've got a couple of
[03:22:19.120 --> 03:22:21.120]  them. I've got three outdoor gardens this year.
[03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:24.120]  If you want to keep up with me,
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:29.120]  you can find me at higherthought.guru. That's a URL.
[03:22:30.120 --> 03:22:32.120]  So that's my website. That's also my Instagram handle.
[03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:36.120]  So yeah, higherthought.guru.
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:41.120]  Find me on there. Give me a follow, shoot me an email.
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:45.120]  I really like engaging with people in the community. That's why I'm here.
[03:22:45.120 --> 03:22:50.120]  So definitely get in touch and nothing commercial right now,
[03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:55.120]  but Peter and I did chat very briefly about maybe getting some seeds
[03:22:56.120 --> 03:22:59.120]  up from me soon.
[03:23:00.120 --> 03:23:05.120]  So hopefully we can proceed with that and be able to offer you guys some of
[03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:07.120]  my work here.
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:09.120]  Sorry. And someone was asking about Instagram.
[03:23:10.120 --> 03:23:13.120]  So there is the Instagram. Nice and big.
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:21.120]  So yes, you can all flood his DMs.
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:26.120]  Yeah. You know what I mean? You get in touch if you're interested in my stuff.
[03:23:26.120 --> 03:23:29.120]  If you're not, you know, you just want to chat, whatever. Like I said,
[03:23:30.120 --> 03:23:34.120]  I've got all this stuff to connect with people and there it is.
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:38.120]  There you go. Yep. So, so yeah,
[03:23:38.120 --> 03:23:40.120]  reach out and I'll look forward to hearing from people.
[03:23:41.120 --> 03:23:45.120]  Definitely got to make it down to Kauai and really appreciate it.
[03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:50.120]  All you guys just, you know, I mean,
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:54.120]  it's flattering that people want to listen and that people think I have good
[03:23:55.120 --> 03:23:56.120]  info. So yeah.
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:00.120]  I'm going to be on the big Island over Christmas. I'm,
[03:24:00.120 --> 03:24:03.120]  but with a bunch of small kids, so I don't know how flexible I'll be.
[03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:07.120]  I may be able to sneak out somewhere on the big Island, but in 2022,
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:12.120]  I would love to visit people all over the Hawaiian Islands if they'll have me
[03:24:12.120 --> 03:24:15.120]  and we'll bring a motley crew.
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:21.120]  There you go. Right on. Well guys, thank you so much for having me on.
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:24.120]  You know, it was, it was really generous. And like I said,
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:28.120]  flattering of you guys to have me on and be so kind.
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:32.120]  So Don Irie, I don't know if you've got an Instagram or whatever,
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:33.120]  but
[03:24:33.120 --> 03:24:37.120]  hell he's going to send me an email and I'll just reply and see you see you and
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:38.120]  you guys can connect.
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:42.120]  Perfect. Perfect. And cool. Well, again,
[03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:46.120]  thank you to everyone listening and all the kind comments and thank you,
[03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:49.120]  Brian and Peter for having me on.
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:52.120]  Absolutely. We appreciate you, buddy.
[03:24:53.120 --> 03:24:54.120]  All right. And with that,
[03:24:54.120 --> 03:24:59.120]  let us call it three hours and 24 minutes in everyone can get on with their
[03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:01.120]  day. Nor Cal
[03:25:04.120 --> 03:25:07.120]  Emerald cup. And ideally before then,
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:12.120]  but the wife is popping out daughter number three in a month.
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:18.120]  So that's that's putting it in perspective.
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:19.120]  Congratulations, Peter.
