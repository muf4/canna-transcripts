[00:01.020 --> 00:14.120]  Good morning everyone. 10 a.m. in Ojai, California. 11 a.m. in Colorado and in Petersburg, Virginia.
[00:14.120 --> 00:17.800]  We welcome Marco. It is, what is it, one o'clock in the afternoon?
[00:17.800 --> 00:19.600]  Yes, sir. One o'clock.
[00:19.600 --> 00:22.520]  Excellent. Well, welcome. Brian, take it away.
[00:22.520 --> 00:27.520]  Yes, sir. Good morning, everybody. Welcome Living Soil Nerds. It's another Thursday,
[00:27.520 --> 00:32.020]  so we're excited to bring to you another mind that we feel is definitely out there
[00:32.020 --> 00:36.520]  and spreading education, giving back to the community, and that is Marco's.
[00:36.520 --> 00:41.520]  Shout out to Marco's for the time that he takes putting into his posts and videos.
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.520]  I myself put a lot of time into Instagram, so I see the amount of effort that he's putting into these things.
[00:47.520 --> 00:54.520]  And this is very time consuming. He's very giving of his time and his education and the experiments and things that he's been running.
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.520]  I'm so excited to see him explain a lot of things that he's been working on.
[00:58.520 --> 01:03.520]  But I'm also excited to have Leighton and Marco's kind of have a nice dialogue today.
[01:03.520 --> 01:09.520]  We can kind of go back and forth and really take this, you know, move it again away from the pro science into real things that are happening,
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.520]  from experience, seeing it live, doing it hands on, and as well as from a lot of other viewpoints.
[01:15.520 --> 01:22.520]  So, Marco's, appreciate to have you on the show, buddy. And we would love to start to kind of find out more about you for our viewers.
[01:22.520 --> 01:27.520]  You know, what you've got up to, some of the videos and stuff that you've been putting on Instagram.
[01:27.520 --> 01:31.520]  If you could please explain a few of those for some of the newer viewers out there.
[01:31.520 --> 01:35.520]  OK, yeah, I want to say thank you all for having me on here.
[01:35.520 --> 01:46.520]  What I do is I do natural farming techniques in the traditional sense, as well as JADAM, the things that they do.
[01:46.520 --> 01:57.520]  And then I also do things which I take those traditional methods and then I put a little bit of a twist on them to make them better, in my opinion.
[01:57.520 --> 02:06.520]  So just as an example, like an IMO4, I'll make a traditional IMO4.
[02:06.520 --> 02:14.520]  But then one thing that I've been doing recently is I'll chop in some either comfrey or alfalfa,
[02:14.520 --> 02:23.520]  and then I'll water that with a JLF and then I'll feed that to black soldier fly larvae and I'll harvest that back.
[02:23.520 --> 02:29.520]  So what I like to do is take the things that are like traditional and keep it,
[02:29.520 --> 02:38.520]  keep the principles that we know about natural farming and then just do things like, you know, feeding that finished product to like,
[02:38.520 --> 02:44.520]  like I said, black soldier fly or even worms, you know, like red wigglers.
[02:44.520 --> 02:51.520]  So that's kind of it in a nutshell. We can kind of get into specifics a little bit more.
[02:51.520 --> 02:57.520]  But, yeah, that's kind of the broad stroke of what I like to do.
[02:57.520 --> 03:02.520]  Yeah, I know a lot of people want to definitely kind of pick your brains today, Marcos and Layton,
[03:02.520 --> 03:12.520]  and kind of understand more about how are we building almost this A to Z concept of a living soil that's going to be able to improve on itself week after week,
[03:12.520 --> 03:21.520]  month after month, year after year. And I feel like you two guys really understand those concepts from the horizons inputs as well as from the natural farming.
[03:21.520 --> 03:25.520]  And I feel like for a lot of us that are living soil coming up, especially self-taught,
[03:25.520 --> 03:31.520]  this is a lot of stuff that's going to minimize a lot of the experience for us starting to understand natural farming,
[03:31.520 --> 03:38.520]  especially for the newer viewers, because some of the gold nuggets that you guys drop off on this show as well as on Instagram,
[03:38.520 --> 03:44.520]  I don't think people really value as much as they should. Some of the stuff that you guys are actually giving to the community.
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.520]  So, Marcos, again, I think the majority of a lot of the questions I was getting throughout the week,
[03:49.520 --> 03:52.520]  they just kind of want to know more of like, what are the inputs that you're putting in there?
[03:52.520 --> 04:01.520]  Because you're producing some unbelievable results and people definitely want to kind of pick your brain on that. And Layton as well.
[04:01.520 --> 04:11.520]  Yeah. So one example. So just kind of an overall disclaimer for everything that I do, I do everything for like every plant.
[04:11.520 --> 04:16.520]  So a lot of people say, well, is this does this work for this? Or what if I'm growing that?
[04:16.520 --> 04:22.520]  You know, how does that work? I don't really try to differentiate too much.
[04:22.520 --> 04:33.520]  What I like to do is focus on the maximum amount of microbe diversity that I can get into my soil as well as nutrients.
[04:33.520 --> 04:43.520]  So when I say microbe diversity, you know, I'm talking about I use natural farming techniques of collecting IMO.
[04:44.520 --> 04:51.520]  And traditionally, you know, everyone's taught, you know, you start you definitely start around your garden space when you start your IMO collections.
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.520]  And I do the same thing. And that's great practice.
[04:55.520 --> 05:12.520]  And so where where I think people need to step up a little bit more and add a little more diversity is I think it's valuable to reach out farther than your garden and surrounding regions in order to collect even more IMO.
[05:12.520 --> 05:20.520]  And what I mean by that is, well, so the traditional way would be, OK, you collect IMO near your garden.
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.520]  Well, I trade IMO collections with folks all around the country.
[05:25.520 --> 05:31.520]  And some people frown upon that. And here's this here's my science behind it.
[05:31.520 --> 05:38.520]  So just as an example, I traded to my IMO with a friend of mine in the desert. Shout out Garrett Gardens.
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.520]  He had a little difficult time collecting at first because it's so dry out there.
[05:44.520 --> 05:49.520]  So we had to do a couple of tweaks. One of the things we did was we moistened the ground.
[05:49.520 --> 05:55.520]  I told him moisten the ground a couple of days and then try for another collection.
[05:55.520 --> 06:01.520]  So we got a good collection out of that. So I traded to my IMO with him.
[06:01.520 --> 06:12.520]  Now, I have this desert IMO here in Petersburg, Virginia, and the natural thing would be to say, OK, well, how is that going to benefit you in Virginia when that was collected in the desert?
[06:12.520 --> 06:22.520]  And the way that works is the IMO I was sent from the desert, there's millions and millions and millions of IMO in that collection.
[06:22.520 --> 06:26.520]  And will all of them survived here in Virginia? No.
[06:26.520 --> 06:31.520]  You know, all of them will not survive. However, some will survive.
[06:31.520 --> 06:37.520]  And the ones that survive now have told me they are tolerant to the desert.
[06:37.520 --> 06:42.520]  And they've also told me that they can grow here where I am.
[06:42.520 --> 06:55.520]  So now in my train of thought, I have a little bit more drought resistance in my IMO that I got from from Garrett out in the desert.
[06:55.520 --> 06:58.520]  And then so that's just adding diversity.
[06:58.520 --> 07:02.520]  Like the biggest thing is the thing about you're dealing with microbes.
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.520]  They're so small, like a drop can have a million bodies in it.
[07:07.520 --> 07:16.520]  So don't you know, why would you think that all the microbes would die that you got from a particular region?
[07:17.520 --> 07:25.520]  So that's kind of one thing that I you know, what I do, Brian, is kind of take that diversity and I've tried to build it up from all over around the whole country.
[07:25.520 --> 07:31.520]  You know what I mean? And I just feel like that adds to my, you know, to my garden.
[07:31.520 --> 07:41.520]  And it benefits it because it's just that many more microbes and they'll balance themselves out, you know, and then they'll be just breaking down all that organic material in my soil and then they get back to my plants.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.520]  That's kind of my thinking on micro diversity.
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.520]  That makes sense. Absolutely. Yeah, Mark, I had a quick question.
[07:51.520 --> 07:59.520]  What are you using the soldier's flies for? So what I do with the black soldier flies, it's funny you mentioned that, Leighton.
[07:59.520 --> 08:07.520]  I'm actually doing a part of what I'm doing. I have a urban farm here in my city, a few miles from where I live.
[08:08.520 --> 08:14.520]  And I'm actually going to do an aquaponics set up on this property.
[08:14.520 --> 08:22.520]  So I want to use a black soldier fly as a feed fish and also want to have just a few chickens and use them for that purpose, too.
[08:22.520 --> 08:41.520]  But the main thing that I like the black soldier fly for is when they feed, when they eat something, their gut biome changes what they eat a little by, you know, increasing the amounts of bacilli bacteria as well as a seno bacteria.
[08:41.520 --> 08:51.520]  So what happens is that IMO4 that they've eaten, it gains those bacteria, but it doesn't lose what it started with.
[08:51.520 --> 08:58.520]  Because when you look at it through a scope, you still see lots of fungi. You still see nematodes. You still see all that goodness in there.
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.520]  So that's kind of what the black soldier fly is, you know, what I'm doing with them.
[09:03.520 --> 09:10.520]  Yeah, there was a lot of work done early on to find a new feed for fish.
[09:10.520 --> 09:21.520]  And black soldier flies were one of the targeted insects for substituting the protein that's usually gotten through fish meal.
[09:21.520 --> 09:27.520]  You know, it's always been a quandary that if you are trying to grow fish, you need to kill fish to make the fish food.
[09:28.520 --> 09:38.520]  And for whatever reason, the black soldier fly has an enzyme or something in it that the fish key in on and they crash the food.
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.520]  So it was a great discovery. I don't remember how long ago it was.
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.520]  I mean, I remember early on, like, you know, 10 years ago, 11 years ago, there was a lot of chatter about it.
[09:48.520 --> 09:58.520]  And it never really took off. And I'm not sure why. Maybe it was just cost of operations for mass producing those.
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.520]  But I knew you had something up your sleeve when you mentioned that you were growing them.
[10:03.520 --> 10:04.520]  Yeah.
[10:04.520 --> 10:11.520]  And so that was what I was going to throw at you after that question was, have you worked with any of the aquatic microorganisms?
[10:11.520 --> 10:14.520]  And it sounds like you're gearing up to do just that.
[10:15.520 --> 10:23.520]  Yeah. Yeah. So I'm late now. I've had I've had aquariums pretty serious about my aquarium for 15 years now.
[10:23.520 --> 10:32.520]  And, you know, indoor aquarium fish. And just over the years, I've always used that, you know, that wastewater, you know, my plants.
[10:32.520 --> 10:37.520]  And I really started taking that and working with it now.
[10:38.520 --> 10:41.520]  You know, a lot of our inputs start with water.
[10:41.520 --> 10:52.520]  You know what I mean? So I do things like I'll start those inputs with aquarium water or, you know, or something like that, because that's loaded with microbiology as well.
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.520]  You know what I mean? And even if they don't survive in the soil, their bodies will feed the soil.
[10:58.520 --> 11:06.520]  So I think fish is a big thing. And I think part of the reason soldier fly didn't catch on here yet is probably just the stigma.
[11:06.520 --> 11:12.520]  Everybody sees them as maggots and maggots are nasty and all this and all that.
[11:12.520 --> 11:21.520]  But if you look at other countries like, say, India, like they have huge factories and things and it's really cheap and easy, you know, feed, like you said.
[11:23.520 --> 11:26.520]  Yeah, that's I do deep, deep respect for that.
[11:27.520 --> 11:34.520]  You know, I did a presentation recently on learnlivingsoils.com about AMO's aquatic microorganisms.
[11:34.520 --> 11:42.520]  And I told people, you know, there's no reason why everybody that's growing cannabis can't have a fish tank, even if it's just a 10 gallon tank.
[11:42.520 --> 11:48.520]  And I gave some demonstrations on how to collect the organisms via the filter.
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.520]  And there was this one really cool filter that ran off an air pump and you just throw it into your aquarium.
[11:53.520 --> 12:06.520]  And what it's doing is as it's driving the air up, it's sucking in all of the suspended solids around it and making it catching it in an easy way for you to pull out and then dump those organisms into a brewer.
[12:07.520 --> 12:14.520]  And you can actually grow them out so that you have a more potent product to water your fish, water your plants with.
[12:14.520 --> 12:16.520]  So, you know, big, big ups, dude, for that.
[12:16.520 --> 12:22.520]  I mean, that's been my my work for God since 2008, 2009.
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.520]  I've been diving down the rabbit hole of collecting fish waste from aquaculture systems.
[12:28.520 --> 12:30.520]  So scale, large scale systems.
[12:31.520 --> 12:39.520]  Yeah. And then I recently helped launch a product with a friend of mine, Keith Wilder, out on Cape Cod.
[12:39.520 --> 12:44.520]  And he has an amazing trout farm and the products that have been coming out of there are bar none.
[12:44.520 --> 12:57.520]  They have incredible population of diatoms, which I think is a really important part of the soil food web that's no longer present because we don't have mass migrations of birds, four-legged buffalo.
[12:57.520 --> 12:59.520]  So none of that stuff's getting up onto the shore.
[13:00.520 --> 13:08.520]  And even if we had those mass migrations, the the water quality and level of microorganisms in the wild is just depressing.
[13:09.520 --> 13:17.520]  You know, some of my, again, early work working with the aquaculture companies was also to go look at stream health and pond health.
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.520]  And so if you understand what fish fry live on, you'd understand they need rotifers.
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.520]  Rotifers are really important, not micro, well, they're still a microorganism.
[13:28.520 --> 13:34.520]  They're multicellular. But the amount of nutrient cycling they do in a water system is incredible.
[13:34.520 --> 13:45.520]  I mean, they literally pull all the organic matter, the very fines that are suspended in the water, use that as well as all the bacteria that are attached to them as a food source.
[13:45.520 --> 13:48.520]  And they become a food source for the fish fry.
[13:48.520 --> 13:58.520]  So we don't have a lot of fry in our rivers and streams right now because there's no rotifers, because they've been wiped out by the fertilizers and, of course, pesticides.
[13:59.520 --> 14:09.520]  So, yeah, it's been my 10 years worth of work to try to get that word out to people of how valuable of a product that is.
[14:09.520 --> 14:19.520]  And Keith was kind enough to figure out solutions to getting this product in the people's hands without forcing these cannabis prices, which are just ridiculous.
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.520]  He understands that farmers need these tools and at affordable rates.
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.520]  So he's willing to mass produce 250 gallon totes and ship them across the country.
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.520]  Now, he hasn't registered in every state yet. They're still working on that.
[14:32.520 --> 14:36.520]  As a matter of fact, I spoke to his lead yesterday to see how they were doing.
[14:36.520 --> 14:38.520]  And unfortunately, it's bureaucracy.
[14:38.520 --> 14:46.520]  So it takes time to get those stupid paperwork in place so that he can legally and comfortably ship this product all over the country.
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.520]  So keep your eyes open.
[14:47.520 --> 14:55.520]  I'll announce once they finally get through all the regulatory nonsense in the U.S., I'll do a post up so that everyone can start purchasing.
[14:55.520 --> 14:57.520]  But he's already starting to get hit up on it, which is good.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.520]  So I want to get the word out that this product's available.
[15:01.520 --> 15:08.520]  And believe it or not, California, as strict as they are, he can ship it out here with the experimental label on it.
[15:08.520 --> 15:14.520]  But he can't in other states, which is like, what?
[15:15.520 --> 15:18.520]  Well, that's well, you know how the laws are.
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.520]  We just kind of talked before we started.
[15:20.520 --> 15:27.520]  Virginia is one thing. And, you know, you guys got a lot of different things going on out there in Cali.
[15:27.520 --> 15:30.520]  But I like that you mentioned diatoms.
[15:30.520 --> 15:32.520]  That's that's very important.
[15:32.520 --> 15:43.520]  It's funny that I actually did a seaweed JLF, which is about a year and a half old now.
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.520]  And cruising through that thing, it's loaded with diatoms.
[15:47.520 --> 15:50.520]  And they're pretty they're pretty cool to look at.
[15:50.520 --> 15:56.520]  Another thing that I did is I. So I made traditional IMO three.
[15:56.520 --> 16:05.520]  And, you know, when you make IMO four, you're basically taking that IMO three and now combining it with garden soil to inoculate that.
[16:05.520 --> 16:12.520]  So and it's equal parts. IMO three to garden soil and water in your inputs to make IMO four.
[16:12.520 --> 16:16.520]  So what I did a little different was I took IMO three.
[16:16.520 --> 16:23.520]  I took half garden soil and then I took the other half diatomaceous earth.
[16:23.520 --> 16:29.520]  And so now I've pretty much made a diatomaceous earth IMO.
[16:29.520 --> 16:32.520]  You know what I mean? Just stuff like that.
[16:32.520 --> 16:37.520]  I think those are where things like that is where we can really experiment.
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.520]  Stay within the stay within the principles, you know, of what works.
[16:42.520 --> 16:49.520]  But I think there's a lot of room for folks to do some experimenting and combining some IMO and different things.
[16:49.520 --> 16:56.520]  Did you add the diatomaceous earth for the reason of its insecticide properties or were you more looking for the minerals?
[16:56.520 --> 17:00.520]  I was looking for the minerals. The insecticide properties.
[17:00.520 --> 17:10.520]  I think that would probably wouldn't be too great because it kind of takes it out at powder form and, you know, gets it kind of clumped back up.
[17:10.520 --> 17:13.520]  So I'm not sure if it may or may not help.
[17:13.520 --> 17:20.520]  Another thing you can do is you can also use azomite, something like that, or, you know, the volcanic rock dust.
[17:20.520 --> 17:25.520]  Anything like that is to me, I like to incorporate microbes when I when I add an input,
[17:25.520 --> 17:32.520]  I like to make it microbes and feed or nutrients and then or microbes and minerals, you know.
[17:32.520 --> 17:40.520]  So I like to just kind of double hit two for one on my inputs, especially when I'm dealing with like IMO stuff like that.
[17:40.520 --> 17:47.520]  Do you so you grow or you you garden, I should say, in containers for the most part.
[17:47.520 --> 17:55.520]  So I grow outdoors. I have a big outdoor space, but I also have an indoor that I grow only in the winter.
[17:56.520 --> 18:02.520]  It's a 65 gallon smart pot on a lazy Susan.
[18:02.520 --> 18:14.520]  And it hasn't and it's been growing for seven years straight, not flipping the soil, only adding more microbes and more inputs.
[18:14.520 --> 18:23.520]  So I only grow in this thing during half the year because of temperature, like winter months or when I do my indoor.
[18:23.520 --> 18:32.520]  And and like when in the off season, I wrap it up and literally this 65 gallon soil just turned into a big old mushroom.
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.520]  Really? And then I break it back out next winter and it's just crazy.
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.520]  So that's another thing. Reusing your soil.
[18:41.520 --> 18:52.520]  You know what I mean? A lot of folks, they think you have to every time you're done, you have to cut the plants, reuse brand new soil.
[18:52.520 --> 18:59.520]  And really that's counterproductive. You know, you're going to lose a lot of all those microbes you were working on, you know, building up in that soil.
[18:59.520 --> 19:07.520]  And just to toss it out to me, reuse your soil, chop your plants, let the roots decompose.
[19:07.520 --> 19:17.520]  Now, that might not be easy for a five gallon, but the bigger your container, you know, you can get closer to emulating kind of outdoors.
[19:18.520 --> 19:23.520]  Oh, that's sweet, dude. And I love that advice.
[19:23.520 --> 19:37.520]  So you probably then are upping your basalt rock and your other microbe available nutrients, which will never, never cause imbalances because they're they're bound up.
[19:37.520 --> 19:42.520]  And that's that's an important aspect that people don't take into consideration.
[19:42.520 --> 19:47.520]  And I love the fact that you're you're allowing those mushrooms to take hold in the off season.
[19:47.520 --> 19:55.520]  I've told so many people, like, you know, if you do an indoor and then an outdoor, if you do not keep the indoor going, you're crazy.
[19:55.520 --> 19:58.520]  I mean, it can be very low light. You can just water it periodically.
[19:58.520 --> 20:05.520]  You don't have to you don't have to intensely monitor, but you want to maintain that life through the season.
[20:05.520 --> 20:12.520]  So you're not having to try to unlock the hydrophobic nature of the material after it's completely dried out.
[20:12.520 --> 20:19.520]  So that's right. Yeah. Yeah. So I keep her, you know, wrap her up in plastic, not airtight, obviously, but just enough.
[20:19.520 --> 20:27.520]  Like you said, to keep our moisture in there. I may have to put a little water in there, you know, in July or something, you know, halfway through.
[20:27.520 --> 20:34.520]  I'll just check on it. But usually I'll just crack it back open around October and get back going.
[20:34.520 --> 20:42.520]  One of the things that you and like you said, Leighton, I did, you know, that soil started out amended, obviously.
[20:42.520 --> 20:51.520]  And I use, you know, kind of, you know, just single ingredient amendments, you know, rock phosphates, you know, things like that.
[20:51.520 --> 21:02.520]  But I always add a lot of nitrogen, be it alfalfa or comfrey, because, as you know, you know, nitrogen doesn't really fix in the soil very well.
[21:02.520 --> 21:14.980]  And it's one of those nutrients has got to be got to be re-added to each every so often.
[21:14.980 --> 21:18.980]  Sorry, Brian, go ahead. I just I was curious. Sixty five gallon.
[21:18.980 --> 21:24.980]  That's obviously a huge pot. And then did you make that lazy, Susan? Because that sounds brilliant.
[21:25.980 --> 21:36.980]  Yeah, so I got a few picture you're in a corner, five by five corner, and you really can't get to the backside of the plants like you want to.
[21:36.980 --> 21:40.980]  I dealt with that for years. And finally, I'm like, you know what? I just put it on lazy.
[21:40.980 --> 21:47.980]  Susan, I built it with some casters and it says low to the ground and it just makes it easy.
[21:47.980 --> 21:51.980]  I could just rotate around, get to the back. And also, it's pretty cool.
[21:51.980 --> 21:59.980]  I like to, you know, each day just rotate a partial rotation if I do anything or not, just to kind of I don't know.
[21:59.980 --> 22:05.980]  It doesn't really emulate anything in nature, but I feel like the plants just get a little bit different light exposure.
[22:05.980 --> 22:13.980]  If you go through that whole cycle and constantly just a little bit of a turn each time, it just evens out everything to me.
[22:14.980 --> 22:27.980]  I think that's a great idea. Really, really great idea because you're taking those pockets of light or stale air and keeping the plant rotating in and around it.
[22:27.980 --> 22:34.980]  So big, big ups for that one. I saw a couple of comments in the chat back a little bit about aquaculture.
[22:35.980 --> 22:45.980]  And the comments are true to some degree that a lot of these aquaculture companies are so focused on feed conversion, pumping the fish in and out,
[22:45.980 --> 22:54.980]  keeping up with markets that they don't always keep the cleansy environments that are needed for really healthy fish.
[22:54.980 --> 23:02.980]  The gentleman that I worked with in Pennsylvania before Keith got his farm, he sold in the live markets.
[23:02.980 --> 23:09.980]  And when he found out that I was using the fish waste to amend soil, he knew what I was doing.
[23:09.980 --> 23:11.980]  He didn't completely understand it, but he got it.
[23:11.980 --> 23:21.980]  And so when I came back to him and I said, hey, look, you know, it would be a lot easier for me to work with this stuff if it was more aerobic and less completely anaerobic.
[23:21.980 --> 23:30.980]  It would take often, you know, a serious amount of brewing to just to get it stabilized enough so that I could start working with it.
[23:31.980 --> 23:38.980]  So he and I worked together on cleaning up some of his old filtration systems. We changed the sand in the sand filters.
[23:38.980 --> 23:46.980]  We got rid of anaerobic pockets that were in his water distribution system. And all of a sudden it was night and day.
[23:46.980 --> 23:51.980]  I mean, I take that stuff. And by the time I got back to Rodale, it was completely stabilized.
[23:51.980 --> 23:59.980]  And he noticed that the fish, the health of the fish increased to the point where he could now charge more money in the live market because their fins were long.
[23:59.980 --> 24:03.980]  Their color was so. So, yeah, you got to know your source, people.
[24:03.980 --> 24:10.980]  I mean, yeah, if you're going to play with with a nasty manure, you've got to be smart about it.
[24:10.980 --> 24:18.980]  I mean, know your farmer, know your source. That's why, you know, when Keith bought that farm, the first thing I did, I don't think he even closed on it yet.
[24:18.980 --> 24:23.980]  And I met him over there with my microscope and started looking around at what was going on.
[24:24.980 --> 24:31.980]  And the reason he is able to put this product on the market is because it's a flow through trout farm.
[24:31.980 --> 24:36.980]  He's conscious about his feed. He doesn't buy the cheapest feed he can.
[24:36.980 --> 24:45.980]  And the water source that that is being used to grow those fish comes from an aquifer that's deep, deep under Massachusetts.
[24:45.980 --> 24:50.980]  It starts way up in Canada, upper state, New York and southern Vermont.
[24:50.980 --> 24:55.980]  And so it is so minerally rich that he has incredible plumes of diatoms in it.
[24:55.980 --> 24:58.980]  So when you buy his product, you're going to get live diatoms.
[24:58.980 --> 25:02.980]  I mean, it's not diatomaceous earth, which is all crushed up and jagged.
[25:02.980 --> 25:08.980]  This is these are live organisms. So they will not only produce, they will reproduce.
[25:08.980 --> 25:12.980]  They will die and leave those minerals in a intact form.
[25:12.980 --> 25:20.980]  So therefore, if a nematode swims by, it's not going to get ripped up or or an insect is not going to get its legs cut off.
[25:20.980 --> 25:26.980]  And that nutrient will then slowly be broken down by the bacteria and made plant available.
[25:26.980 --> 25:31.980]  So, I mean, I just can't speak enough about, you know, what he's done.
[25:31.980 --> 25:41.980]  He's listened to me. He's increased his his what I want to call scrubbing capacity to pull out the organic matter and all these microbes that are so
[25:42.980 --> 25:47.980]  desirable. And then he stores them in a way that it is, you know, truly aerobic.
[25:47.980 --> 25:55.980]  It's not even anoxic, which is great. And as I've told him, you know, when you start with dirt, it's actually better to be using an anoxic,
[25:55.980 --> 26:06.980]  which means anaerobic is zero parts per million oxygen. Anoxic is like six parts to one part per million parts of oxygen.
[26:06.980 --> 26:15.980]  And those organisms that live in that realm, which are kind of between aerobic and anaerobic, do an amazing job of setting up dirt.
[26:15.980 --> 26:18.980]  And so that you can turn it into soil very quickly.
[26:18.980 --> 26:21.980]  Are those your facultative anaerobes you're talking about?
[26:21.980 --> 26:25.980]  Yeah. Yeah. I like to call them oxygen tolerant.
[26:25.980 --> 26:30.980]  Facultative is a little bit of a misnomer. But yeah, you're absolutely right.
[26:30.980 --> 26:44.980]  And I know that in JDOM, they have a number of similar anoxic type organisms that both can live in a truly anaerobic environment as well as a aerobic environment.
[26:44.980 --> 26:48.980]  Right. And I think they're a critical step in.
[26:48.980 --> 26:53.980]  And again, and you brought this up a number of times, is that so what if they don't live?
[26:53.980 --> 27:04.980]  They're still a bio stimulant. They're still going to provide a successionary system for your for your whole ecosystem that you're trying to maintain and build in your indoor system.
[27:04.980 --> 27:08.980]  So, you know, big ups to the work you're doing there, brother.
[27:08.980 --> 27:10.980]  Yeah. You deep dived hard.
[27:10.980 --> 27:13.980]  Yeah. I've been doing this a long time.
[27:13.980 --> 27:22.980]  And there's I mean, I got a lot of I got a story I can't even tell on this format right now because of the way the world is and where I live.
[27:22.980 --> 27:25.980]  But yeah, man, I've been doing this a while.
[27:25.980 --> 27:31.980]  And one thing I do with the fish waste is I was kind of similar to your buddy.
[27:31.980 --> 27:42.980]  I guess what I was thinking was I wanted to find a way to kind of keep all that biology alive when I did my aquarium changes and, you know, my vacuuming on my gravel and all that.
[27:42.980 --> 27:59.980]  So what I did was I basically take all that wastewater and I put it in a cooler and that same cooler is this is where I rinse off like when I make like natural farming things or a bottle things up or make FPGAs and wash my hands.
[27:59.980 --> 28:06.980]  Anytime I do anything natural farming and I need to rinse, I do it in that same cooler where I've been dumping that fish waste.
[28:07.980 --> 28:11.980]  And looking at that over time, that stuff is so active.
[28:11.980 --> 28:18.980]  I actually I just pretty much start using it on my plants and and I actually sell it to man like people love it.
[28:18.980 --> 28:23.980]  Like it's really alive. It's active and it's low cost.
[28:23.980 --> 28:24.980]  You know what I mean?
[28:24.980 --> 28:31.980]  So like you said, if you're serious about growing plants, whether it be indoor or outdoor, like you said, invest in an aquarium.
[28:31.980 --> 28:34.980]  That's just another source of biology.
[28:35.980 --> 28:37.980]  It's pretty much free. You know what I mean?
[28:40.980 --> 28:52.980]  Yeah, that's a that's a great idea to actually be using wastewater from other components to feed the biology that you're that you're getting or collecting from your fish tank.
[28:53.980 --> 28:55.980]  Yeah, man, you're rocking it down there, dude.
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.980]  I mean, I tell you, you know, and it's I think it kind of comes natural to me.
[29:00.980 --> 29:03.980]  I've always been like in nature and observing and stuff.
[29:03.980 --> 29:12.980]  And it just like I'm the kind of guy if I see someone do something like when I started getting in natural farming, there's a lot of good YouTube videos out there.
[29:12.980 --> 29:15.980]  You know, soil store is a guy that everybody has watched his stuff.
[29:15.980 --> 29:16.980]  You know what I mean?
[29:17.980 --> 29:23.980]  One thing that I do is I definitely watch everything you do and I hear what you do, but I also do it myself.
[29:23.980 --> 29:25.980]  You know what I mean? I like to test things myself.
[29:25.980 --> 29:37.980]  And a lot of where we get into and I think you'll call it bro science comes in where people only hear something and then then they repeat it as if they know it.
[29:38.980 --> 29:47.980]  See, that's not always good because a lot of times people come up with some crazy shit when it comes to growing plants and it really doesn't make sense sometimes.
[29:47.980 --> 29:49.980]  So take the time.
[29:50.980 --> 29:54.980]  If you saw this guy do a video, if you saw me do something, check it for yourself.
[29:54.980 --> 29:56.980]  You know what I mean? Do the experiment.
[29:56.980 --> 30:00.980]  This stuff's really easy to do, you know, and it's really easy to verify.
[30:01.980 --> 30:02.980]  We don't have to be a scientist.
[30:02.980 --> 30:05.980]  You don't necessarily have to send this stuff out to a lab.
[30:05.980 --> 30:09.980]  You know, if you're in tune with your plants, your plants are going to talk to you.
[30:09.980 --> 30:12.980]  They're going to tell you that they like this stuff or they don't like it.
[30:12.980 --> 30:16.980]  You know, then if you want to get more scientific, that's available, too.
[30:16.980 --> 30:18.980]  But I think the basics are the principles.
[30:19.980 --> 30:23.980]  And then and then doing these things, don't just take someone's word for it.
[30:25.980 --> 30:27.980]  Right on. Good words, my friend.
[30:27.980 --> 30:28.980]  Really good words.
[30:28.980 --> 30:30.980]  You know, I speak about spirituality a lot.
[30:30.980 --> 30:35.980]  People probably think I'm a whack job, but you know, you can be in touch with nature.
[30:35.980 --> 30:38.980]  You can you can see the plants respond and react.
[30:39.980 --> 30:43.980]  You know, I make this product that's biologically active, humic acid.
[30:44.980 --> 30:48.980]  And when applied to landscape plants within 24 hours, you see plant reaction.
[30:48.980 --> 30:51.980]  You see the color change, the luster change.
[30:52.980 --> 30:54.980]  You see the plants vigor.
[30:54.980 --> 30:56.980]  But you have to pay attention to that.
[30:57.980 --> 31:03.980]  And that's where, you know, whether you use the word spirituality or connection to, those are critical.
[31:04.980 --> 31:08.980]  And so the new guys who are just starting out, you're not going to have that.
[31:08.980 --> 31:10.980]  You're going to have to learn that.
[31:10.980 --> 31:13.980]  And, you know, like Marco's saying is, yeah, watch the videos.
[31:13.980 --> 31:15.980]  Learn by observation.
[31:15.980 --> 31:17.980]  That is the best science.
[31:17.980 --> 31:20.980]  And, you know, Marco, you're a citizen science.
[31:20.980 --> 31:22.980]  Look at the shit you're doing, man.
[31:22.980 --> 31:29.980]  You're so far ahead of the vast majority of people that I speak to because of the diversity that you're working with.
[31:29.980 --> 31:31.980]  The idea of bringing in desert inoculant.
[31:31.980 --> 31:33.980]  Oh, dude, that was fucking badass.
[31:33.980 --> 31:43.980]  And realizing that there was an issue with trying to get the organisms awake so that you can actually collect them by watering the soil.
[31:43.980 --> 31:47.980]  Again, I mean, that's, you know, it's brilliant.
[31:47.980 --> 31:52.980]  And it's, you know, I know it's common sense, but I don't think anybody has common sense anymore.
[31:54.980 --> 31:58.980]  It feels like the world is, yeah, it's going away from the world a little bit.
[31:58.980 --> 32:02.980]  But I do have somewhat of, you know, I did go to Virginia Tech.
[32:02.980 --> 32:06.980]  So I do have my first major was forestry and wildlife.
[32:06.980 --> 32:12.980]  And I didn't really stick in that that long, two semesters.
[32:12.980 --> 32:15.980]  And then I ended up in construction management, which is where I'm at now.
[32:15.980 --> 32:20.980]  But so I do have that, you know, I always wanted to, you know, be that nature guy.
[32:20.980 --> 32:21.980]  And I was always in nature.
[32:21.980 --> 32:24.980]  But college, biology and all that stuff.
[32:24.980 --> 32:30.980]  I mean, you got to go through a lot of bullshit before you actually learn what you really want to learn.
[32:30.980 --> 32:31.980]  You know what I mean?
[32:31.980 --> 32:34.980]  So nothing wrong with learning it that way.
[32:34.980 --> 32:35.980]  That's all good.
[32:35.980 --> 32:38.980]  But you can kind of self-teach, too.
[32:38.980 --> 32:42.980]  And kind of pick it up as you go.
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.980]  One thing that.
[32:46.980 --> 32:47.980]  Well, go ahead.
[32:47.980 --> 32:48.980]  I lost my train of thought.
[32:48.980 --> 32:49.980]  But.
[32:49.980 --> 32:55.980]  Well, no, I loved what you were touching on is that, you know, the collegiate learning is.
[32:55.980 --> 32:58.980]  I don't want to discount it or discourage it.
[32:58.980 --> 32:59.980]  But you're right.
[32:59.980 --> 33:00.980]  You go through all this bullshit.
[33:00.980 --> 33:02.980]  You don't need to know.
[33:02.980 --> 33:07.980]  You need to know how to apply it, not how why it works.
[33:07.980 --> 33:10.980]  You know, you don't need to learn how to build a clock to tell time.
[33:10.980 --> 33:16.980]  So, you know, I highly encourage people to read simple books like Jeff Loewenfeld's trilogy.
[33:16.980 --> 33:19.980]  And now all of a sudden, now you understand what it's about.
[33:19.980 --> 33:26.980]  And you didn't spend a ton of money and a year of your life in a college class to learn something that.
[33:26.980 --> 33:27.980]  And spend a ton of money.
[33:27.980 --> 33:29.980]  You learned it on your own.
[33:29.980 --> 33:32.980]  And, you know, however long it takes you to read the three books.
[33:32.980 --> 33:33.980]  And you're off to the races.
[33:33.980 --> 33:35.980]  So, you know, thank you for bringing that up.
[33:35.980 --> 33:37.980]  That, you know, that is really important.
[33:37.980 --> 33:40.980]  Again, I'm not discouraging education.
[33:40.980 --> 33:41.980]  Correct.
[33:41.980 --> 33:42.980]  It is important.
[33:42.980 --> 33:48.980]  And if you want to really take your, you know, your knowledge to the next level, then, yeah, that's where you have to be.
[33:48.980 --> 33:50.980]  You have to be in academia.
[33:50.980 --> 33:59.980]  And you have to be surrounded by like-minded people that are on a journey to prove or disprove or uncover something.
[33:59.980 --> 34:07.980]  And that's one of these billions of mysteries that are still present in our understanding of how this whole ecosystem functions.
[34:07.980 --> 34:10.980]  So, dude, you're just a wisdom man.
[34:10.980 --> 34:11.980]  Pearls.
[34:11.980 --> 34:12.980]  Tons of pearls.
[34:12.980 --> 34:16.980]  The bearded wizard I heard some of those people were saying.
[34:16.980 --> 34:17.980]  Yeah.
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.980]  They really want to dive into like what you're doing.
[34:20.980 --> 34:22.980]  Like, you know, you're showing those IMO piles.
[34:22.980 --> 34:24.980]  It seems like you might be just doing it.
[34:25.980 --> 34:31.980]  Your style just seems to be a little more effective than some of the other people that I also follow on Instagram.
[34:31.980 --> 34:35.980]  They're trying to, you know, kind of obviously achieve the same goals that you are.
[34:35.980 --> 34:38.980]  But you're next level, man, with some of the stuff that you're doing.
[34:38.980 --> 34:44.980]  So are there some gold nuggets that you feel like you could kind of drop from your experience since we are talking about education?
[34:44.980 --> 34:46.980]  I mean, obviously, that takes a lot.
[34:46.980 --> 34:48.980]  That's a big dive into things.
[34:48.980 --> 34:58.980]  But, yeah, experience is, in my opinion, what what pays the bills at the end of the day is being able to operate certain facilities at a high functioning rate.
[34:58.980 --> 35:03.980]  And I feel like that, again, it all comes down to understanding soil food, wet and managing soil.
[35:03.980 --> 35:07.980]  And again, shout out to Jeff Lowenfelds because Teaming with Microbes was the book for me.
[35:07.980 --> 35:09.980]  That was an aha moment.
[35:09.980 --> 35:11.980]  And I said this all over.
[35:11.980 --> 35:19.980]  You know, that book changed my life because now I was able to start to farm in my style and my peers started to take notice.
[35:19.980 --> 35:26.980]  And that was something that really felt good for me because for years I had been growing, you know, just not that great.
[35:26.980 --> 35:32.980]  So I needed to refocus. And I feel like once you start to understand that it's the microbial world really taking hold, that's where you serve.
[35:32.980 --> 35:35.980]  Come on. Taking it to the next level.
[35:35.980 --> 35:37.980]  Yeah. Thank you, man.
[35:37.980 --> 35:45.980]  And that is that, you know, I'm probably like a lot of other folks, you know, you start with bottles, you know, green, brown, red.
[35:45.980 --> 35:49.980]  You know what I mean? So everybody kind of goes through that.
[35:49.980 --> 35:54.980]  I actually started soil and then but smaller containers.
[35:54.980 --> 36:00.980]  Couldn't figure out why things weren't going right. You know, the hydro comes into the scene.
[36:00.980 --> 36:04.980]  Try that. It's wonderful for the size and the yields.
[36:04.980 --> 36:08.980]  But then you're like, man, it's not good for you. You got too much stuff in it.
[36:08.980 --> 36:15.980]  So go back to soil and what they call sort of organic, you know, as they know, as we know today.
[36:15.980 --> 36:19.980]  But, you know, that term is just something you pay for more or less.
[36:19.980 --> 36:22.980]  You can be beyond organic. You know what I mean?
[36:22.980 --> 36:29.980]  If you all understand that. So and then back and then now to live in soil.
[36:29.980 --> 36:34.980]  It's crazy with living soil. I never have deficiencies.
[36:34.980 --> 36:39.980]  Knock on wood and pests. No pests.
[36:39.980 --> 36:44.980]  Like I have not had pests or deficiencies in six, seven years.
[36:44.980 --> 36:51.980]  Knock on wood. But I think that's a test to good soil microbes, high level in the soil.
[36:52.980 --> 36:57.980]  Microbes at a high level in the soil and foliar feeds.
[36:57.980 --> 37:08.980]  To me, those are huge coating the entire plant with beneficial microbes so that bad microbes can't get in and infiltrate.
[37:08.980 --> 37:15.980]  I think some of the main gems, like if I'm going to just throw it out there, like you got to watch nature, man.
[37:16.980 --> 37:23.980]  I did this year. I was able to collect acorns like at the perfect time.
[37:23.980 --> 37:29.980]  So I collected probably 50 pounds of acorns. I took some of those.
[37:29.980 --> 37:37.980]  I did acorn seed sprout. So in other words, I soaked them in SES, let them start sprouting,
[37:37.980 --> 37:45.980]  and then basically turn that into a and then basically fermented that and then turn that into a vinegar.
[37:45.980 --> 37:50.980]  So that's one thing like using what you got when it's acorn season.
[37:50.980 --> 37:57.980]  I use some of them for that. I crush some of them up and put them in my IMOs to make IMO three and IMO four.
[37:57.980 --> 38:04.980]  I put some combined with IMO also combined with JLF to make kind of a wet mix.
[38:04.980 --> 38:10.980]  Stuff that into burlap sacks, close them up on cardboard boxes, put them on the ground.
[38:10.980 --> 38:17.980]  And that's been sitting in those boxes since August. And that'll be a great input this spring.
[38:17.980 --> 38:24.980]  But to me, open your eyes, even if you garden indoors, go outside, see what's going on.
[38:24.980 --> 38:28.980]  Take advantage of a lot of the free ingredients we got.
[38:29.980 --> 38:36.980]  My neighbor's got a persimmon tree that each year I've been collecting. I've been dialing in like when to collect those persimmons.
[38:36.980 --> 38:41.980]  So this year I collected enough to make about 12 gallons of persimmon vinegar.
[38:41.980 --> 38:48.980]  Vinegars are huge. And lately I've been kind of getting away from the sugar.
[38:48.980 --> 38:58.980]  So I've been going straight from straight from plant material to fermenting it and then straight to vinegar without even extracting for FPJ or FFJ.
[38:58.980 --> 39:08.980]  So I've been cutting down on my FFJs, FPJs, but increasing my use of vinegars because I think the sugar, just like with our bodies,
[39:08.980 --> 39:13.980]  we can't, too much sugar is not good for us and too much sugar is not good for your garden as well.
[39:13.980 --> 39:23.980]  So to me, if you're in the natural farming, if you're doing sugar inputs, then balance that out and have equal amount of JADAM or decomposition type inputs.
[39:23.980 --> 39:27.980]  Those are some of the things that really helped me. And it's all about balance.
[39:27.980 --> 39:33.980]  You know, those are the things that kind of that helped me out of my garden.
[39:34.980 --> 39:37.980]  Oh, that was a nugget. Brian, did you hear that one?
[39:37.980 --> 39:48.980]  Yeah, I was going to say that has always been the biggest issue in natural farming is the accumulation of sugar because people are overusing it.
[39:48.980 --> 39:57.980]  And those kinds of things trigger different plant reaction, first of all. And second of all, if you use too much, they build up in the soil and it goes anaerobic.
[39:57.980 --> 40:04.980]  So I love the idea of offsetting that with a vinegar so that you're never getting that accumulation.
[40:04.980 --> 40:11.980]  It's being broken down by the vinegar. And so, wow, that was a huge nugget for the people listening out there.
[40:11.980 --> 40:17.980]  Yeah. And then so you still and the cool thing about vinegars, man, if you think about it, when you make a vinegar, you didn't lose anything.
[40:17.980 --> 40:22.980]  The vinegar is essentially because of the way I make them as I ferment with sugar.
[40:23.980 --> 40:30.980]  And we just said we don't want to use as much sugar. However, when that vinegar process go, that sugar gets converted to alcohol.
[40:30.980 --> 40:37.980]  So now it changes the whole composition of it. So when you do water in the vinegars, not only you get the acidic acid bacteria,
[40:37.980 --> 40:42.980]  but then you also get everything that was in the plant that made the vinegar.
[40:42.980 --> 40:48.980]  And vinegars, to me, are very, they're slept on a lot.
[40:48.980 --> 40:54.980]  I think people don't appreciate them enough because vinegars are really great for all plants, but especially plants we love.
[40:54.980 --> 41:00.980]  When you spray a diluted vinegar on those leaves, it thickens the wax layer on your leaves.
[41:00.980 --> 41:05.980]  You know, that's going to be extra protection against pests and mites and things like that.
[41:05.980 --> 41:11.980]  They can they can they can attack your plants. So definitely try your vinegars, different flavors.
[41:12.980 --> 41:17.980]  All you know, and I like vinegars. They've been really good lately.
[41:17.980 --> 41:22.980]  Another nugget that you just dropped, I'm sure some people picked up on that, is acorns.
[41:22.980 --> 41:27.980]  I feel like acorns is a game changer, especially when you're able to kind of break them down and then emulsify them.
[41:27.980 --> 41:31.980]  Can you kind of go more into depth and explain why?
[41:31.980 --> 41:34.980]  Because that is something I personally I have seen with experience,
[41:34.980 --> 41:38.980]  but then I don't really understand exactly what's all going down during that breakdown process.
[41:38.980 --> 41:42.980]  But it does seem to be another gold nugget.
[41:42.980 --> 41:49.980]  Yeah, man, I tell you, acorns are awesome because if you think about an acorn, I mean, it's it's a tree and that you're holding in your hand, basically.
[41:49.980 --> 42:00.980]  So pretty much everything, nutrients, enzymes, growth hormones, everything that that that that tree would need to get started.
[42:00.980 --> 42:05.980]  And so I know a lot of folks you know about the seed sprouted seed teas.
[42:05.980 --> 42:09.980]  So a lot of people do them with corn or various other things.
[42:09.980 --> 42:13.980]  And for me, just to do it with acorns just made sense, man.
[42:13.980 --> 42:17.980]  That's so crazy. I was walking. I do a lot of nature hikes.
[42:17.980 --> 42:20.980]  I was walking and I just, you know, stepping on acorns.
[42:20.980 --> 42:24.980]  I'm like, OK, so look down. Well, all these acorns were like partially sprouted.
[42:24.980 --> 42:30.980]  We're like they had like they dropped four weeks ago roughly and then it had rained a lot and they were just starting to sprout.
[42:30.980 --> 42:32.980]  So they each had a little nub sticking out of them.
[42:32.980 --> 42:42.980]  So that's things like that, man. Being out in the nature, that's what's going to trigger you because you say, all right, man, there's an acorn loaded with energy.
[42:42.980 --> 42:47.980]  First of all, loaded with hormones, loaded with growth plant growth hormones.
[42:47.980 --> 42:53.980]  All right. Let me sprout some of these. Then let me ferment them.
[42:53.980 --> 42:56.980]  And then let me turn them to a vinegar. So I don't know.
[42:56.980 --> 42:59.980]  I don't know. Is that you know why necessarily?
[42:59.980 --> 43:10.980]  But for me, it makes sense because I'm just taking what's there and I'm just converting it a little bit and making it where, you know, my garden can use it a whole lot more.
[43:10.980 --> 43:24.980]  Even with the IMO three like that, that really kicks off an IMO pile having that carb source like that, because you think those acorns laying in the forest, those things are they got tons of microbes already on them, you know.
[43:24.980 --> 43:31.980]  So it's just a win win. The acorns is awesome. Even different berries and things like that that you have, man.
[43:31.980 --> 43:37.980]  You try to just think what I do is I see something and I do the research to find out if it's usable.
[43:37.980 --> 43:43.980]  OK, and that's and that's kind of a good way to do it, I think.
[43:43.980 --> 43:49.980]  And that seems to really be the catalyst that seems to spark, especially faster fungal growth.
[43:49.980 --> 43:56.510]  At least in my experience, it seemed like once you started to work with that kind of stuff.
[43:56.510 --> 44:01.510]  Yeah, you you you're gaining all the endophytes. I think Brian lost us.
[44:01.510 --> 44:10.510]  Can you guys hear Brian? I can't. Anyway, yeah, the acorns, like you said, are packed with hormone.
[44:10.510 --> 44:19.510]  You're getting all of the endophytic bacteria and fungi that we know can switch between endophytic and saprophytic phases and actually aquatic phases.
[44:19.510 --> 44:24.510]  So it just only makes sense that that be such a viable source.
[44:24.510 --> 44:31.510]  Now, I did see someone in the chat saying something about worried about tannins. You don't have to worry about tannins on that level.
[44:31.510 --> 44:37.510]  It's not it's not like you're just using acorns. He's using acorns in steps and phases.
[44:37.510 --> 44:43.510]  And again, it's all about using common sense. You know, don't be a moron. Don't use all or too much of one thing.
[44:43.510 --> 44:48.510]  Diversity, diversity, diversity. So, of course, these things can't hurt.
[44:48.510 --> 44:55.510]  I actually did it kind of like the way he did it, you know, just by like saying, hey, you know, I have all these acorns all over the yard.
[44:55.510 --> 44:59.510]  Why don't I throw them in my compost pile? And I used to do a six month pile.
[44:59.510 --> 45:13.510]  So I built a hugel style compost pile. I would I would apply hay leaves layers, you know, all the different inoculants, chips, and then inoculate it with my product and then seed it.
[45:13.510 --> 45:19.510]  Yeah, I'd cover crop it and then let it go. And then six months later, I'd come back.
[45:19.510 --> 45:29.510]  Now, I'd still see some acorns, but the other cool thing was that I'd have chipmunks and squirrels going in there and turning the compost pile and, you know, doing their business.
[45:29.510 --> 45:36.510]  And and then six months later, that stuff was rocket fuel. I mean, the amount of organic in there was insane.
[45:36.510 --> 45:48.510]  So I'm glad you brought that up again, you know, using your local resources, you're getting your local indigenous organisms, you're getting your local sources of carbs and sugars.
[45:48.510 --> 45:51.510]  You know, you're just you're throwing all kinds of pearls and nuggets around.
[45:51.510 --> 45:58.510]  Yeah. Thank you, man. You know, and one thing about tannins, because folks have asked me that, too.
[45:59.510 --> 46:05.510]  So when you OK, here's the thing you're going to allow people say, OK, using acorns, let me go Google acorns.
[46:05.510 --> 46:10.510]  So they go Google acorns. First thing you're going to see is I got tannins. They're going to make you sick.
[46:10.510 --> 46:13.510]  Well, I'm not eating these. The forest is full of tannins.
[46:13.510 --> 46:18.510]  Like every there's a billion tons of tannins out there. Like it's not hurting anything.
[46:18.510 --> 46:27.510]  Just watch your info. You're reading. Sure. Tannins aren't good for us, but it's not going to be anything to hurt your guard.
[46:27.510 --> 46:41.510]  You know, that kind of thing. Another thing, another cool gem was with the black soldier fly.
[46:41.510 --> 46:45.510]  Oh, yeah. The IMO for. OK. Yeah. I'll just kind of flip it through my notes.
[46:45.510 --> 46:51.510]  You all see what else I had. Good. Well, did you lay them down so hard?
[46:51.510 --> 46:59.510]  I don't know if the audience can keep up. I know I'm forgetting some stuff.
[46:59.510 --> 47:03.510]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll kick it around a little and see where it goes.
[47:03.510 --> 47:11.510]  Have you experimented on your farm using like especially when you start to build those compost piles and stuff, the dung beetle?
[47:11.510 --> 47:18.510]  I have some friends that are messing around with that where supposedly the dung beetles are going to come and take from that and spread that all over your field.
[47:18.510 --> 47:24.510]  Have you ever heard of anything like that or do you think that, you know, just your thoughts on that, basically?
[47:24.510 --> 47:32.510]  I think, you know, it's kind of a cool idea. I think the way I build my pile, I'm not doing any manure at this time.
[47:32.510 --> 47:44.510]  So I wouldn't have that. But that's kind of fascinating if you think about it, if you put a big pile of manure near your garden and let just let the dung beetles come in there and just start rolling it out.
[47:44.510 --> 47:50.510]  Oh, that's interesting, bro. That's a great, great nitrogen source.
[47:50.510 --> 48:07.510]  Yeah. A lot of the biggest restoration in prairies, they've been doing a lot of that, importing manure, usually cold manures, you know, some cow patties that they could pull up as a patty.
[48:07.510 --> 48:22.510]  So it couldn't be in a feedlot. But then taking those cow patties and throwing them all over the field or putting the cows on that field for a period of time and letting them, you know, defecate all over the place.
[48:22.510 --> 48:34.510]  And then they come back and then they see that those beetles have come back and they have started to redistribute all of that into little nuggets all over the floor, all over the field.
[48:35.510 --> 48:47.510]  So there's, you know, there's real value there. And again, in letting nature do the work, like I saw in the comments, someone was like, I wish squirrels and chipmunks would turn my compost pile over. Right. Why don't you let them, dude? Let them.
[48:47.510 --> 48:51.510]  That's right. Every little bit helps, man. Put them to work.
[48:51.510 --> 49:07.510]  I think our biggest problem as a species is we're all about trying to conquer nature. We're trying to push back. And instead, we got to start working with. It's too late to be pushing back anymore. We've already, we've already. I'll get off that soapbox before I get too crazy.
[49:08.510 --> 49:24.510]  I'm with you there, brother. Yeah, we got to work with nature for sure. And, you know, another thing in our, in our, you know, industry or whatever you want to call it. A lot of guys want to take too much credit for growing a quality product.
[49:25.510 --> 49:42.510]  And maybe that sounds funny, but I don't care to take that much credit because I know that everything that's working is basically me putting things together and these microbes doing the work. You know, I'd rather take credit that I stayed out of the way.
[49:43.510 --> 50:00.510]  But I didn't mess that up. You know what I mean? To me, that's the credit that I took nature and, and, and, and, and helped it keep doing its thing. So part of that taking credit is also, we feel like we have to add too many things. You know what I mean?
[50:01.510 --> 50:20.510]  You know, the nutrient lines, you know, 10 bottles. It used to be three bottles. Now it's six, eight, you know, it's a bottle for every little stage or week of the process. That's ridiculous. You know, nature doesn't work that way. So really get off the bottles, man. Get yourself off the bottles.
[50:22.510 --> 50:24.510]  You know, bottles are for babies.
[50:26.510 --> 50:27.510]  Take them train wheels off.
[50:28.510 --> 50:50.510]  Take them training wheels off. And, and really, man, get involved. You're getting into your soil, man. You know, like I used to spend hours sitting in my room, you know, looking at my plants. You know what I mean? Now it seems like I'm looking more at the soil, you know, than my plants. So that's the kind of the mindset, you know, soil mentality.
[50:51.510 --> 50:56.780]  If you're focused on the soil, I mean, everything else just seems to come into place.
[50:57.780 --> 51:16.780]  You have an issue, you got to really kind of assess again what's going on in the soil, you know? And that's why I really feel like, you know, these Thursday shows are going to really speed up that process because there is a bit of, of a learning curve, you know, and you have to kind of trust the process as well, especially if you're just starting out with this, these kind of concepts.
[51:17.780 --> 51:26.780]  But the, the mountain that you're going to climb is worth the effort because once you're on top and you start to see from A to Z how these really improve terpenes, cannabinoids, the whole gamut.
[51:26.780 --> 51:39.780]  This is why you're like, okay, I get what's going on here. I get spending time and reading a lot of the books that we've mentioned and then taking it the next step like this, where I feel like the, you know, the majority of people now we want videos.
[51:40.780 --> 51:54.780]  We want to consume as much information in that manner. And that's why I feel like people are going to be able, you know, especially after the pandemic and all that kind of stuff, I feel like there's going to be a huge new variety of a lot of farmers out there that are going to start to see this light.
[51:54.780 --> 52:08.780]  And I feel like it's a part of what everything that we've been doing, you know, today and as we continue forward. So Marcos, I really appreciate, again, what you're also putting on Instagram, because that is going, you know, for us farmers, I guess on Instagram, you're killing it, buddy.
[52:08.780 --> 52:17.780]  You know, I mean, you're all your stuff's getting out there. And that's really the biggest thing that I think a lot of the farmers that maybe don't also have the Instagram skills.
[52:18.780 --> 52:31.780]  They're not able to really showcase a lot of that. So not only do you have the skill set that you do serve, but you also have the Instagram skill set to get that information out. And I feel like that is really what, you know, hats off to you, because that's a whole nother art form in itself.
[52:32.780 --> 52:45.780]  So to combine that, that's why I wanted to talk to you today, because people really appreciate when you're able to take complex subjects, and then break that down for the layperson so that they can continue and experiment.
[52:46.780 --> 53:02.780]  So, you know, at the beginning of this little rant, trust the process, because that is the biggest issue, especially as you get into the larger facilities, to let somebody know like, yeah, I don't really, you know, I'm not really involved as much, you know, or that I'm trying to choose my words here.
[53:02.780 --> 53:13.780]  I mean, like, when you're in a facility like that, to tell, you know, suits, if you will, the owner, that yeah, we're going to rely on the soil to make sure that everything is working for us.
[53:14.780 --> 53:20.780]  That does sound foreign, unless someone is really dialed in and understands what the Soil Food Web is, and has seen that process in action.
[53:21.780 --> 53:25.780]  We have a variety of people around the country that are starting to show that off.
[53:25.780 --> 53:30.780]  So for you guys that aren't on Instagram, I encourage you just to make a little account and check that out.
[53:30.780 --> 53:39.780]  It's pretty cool to see this kind of whole new movement for a variety of natural farming as well as living soil.
[53:40.780 --> 53:41.780]  Yeah, definitely. Well said, Brian.
[53:42.780 --> 53:48.780]  One thing I just add, like when you choose this way and when you go living soil, it gets better.
[53:48.780 --> 53:49.780]  Each year it gets better.
[53:50.780 --> 53:52.780]  You know, that goes for your indoor, your outdoor, whatever.
[53:53.780 --> 53:57.780]  I just started a new garden outdoor, you know, which for my food crops.
[53:58.780 --> 54:05.780]  And like just from last year to this year, like the yield was almost twice as much.
[54:05.780 --> 54:11.780]  It's just it just takes time for that soil biology to build up and for you to build it up.
[54:12.780 --> 54:19.780]  Another thing that definitely take a lot of IMO collections from all as many as you can.
[54:19.780 --> 54:29.780]  Like I think one thing people when they start making IMO piles, I think they're where they fall short as they don't start with enough different of the IMO 2s going into it.
[54:30.780 --> 54:35.780]  Like when I make an IMO 3 pile, I use like seven to eight different IMO 2s.
[54:35.780 --> 54:43.780]  And I know that might not be conventional to some of the traditional K&F people, but I'm the master of my garden.
[54:43.780 --> 54:45.780]  You know what I mean? And it works, you know.
[54:46.780 --> 54:47.780]  So that's how you got to look at it.
[54:48.780 --> 54:52.780]  You know, somebody did a video or me on Instagram or wherever.
[54:52.780 --> 54:54.780]  I'm not the master of your garden.
[54:55.780 --> 55:01.780]  There's no way I could ever tell you exactly what's going on there because you're there every day.
[55:04.780 --> 55:11.780]  Look at yourself as a student because I'm still a student, but also look at yourself as, okay, I'm a student, but I learned something.
[55:11.780 --> 55:13.780]  So I can also teach a little bit too.
[55:13.780 --> 55:14.780]  You know what I mean?
[55:14.780 --> 55:19.780]  So as you learn, you're learning and you're being a student and you're teaching along the way.
[55:19.780 --> 55:21.780]  It's not just learning. It's not just trying to teach.
[55:22.780 --> 55:23.780]  Come on up.
[55:25.780 --> 55:27.780]  And nobody will ever take that away from you.
[55:27.780 --> 55:29.780]  That is the biggest thing I think too.
[55:30.780 --> 55:32.780]  No one can ever steal that education.
[55:32.780 --> 55:33.780]  That's right.
[55:35.780 --> 55:39.780]  And the diversity, I mean, you just, the diversity is key.
[55:40.780 --> 55:49.780]  So by using, you know, seven, eight different versions of an IMO to build out a pile, you're providing that.
[55:49.780 --> 55:57.780]  The foundation of IMO, indigenous microorganisms are collected in a place that is the least disturbed you can find.
[55:58.780 --> 56:03.780]  If you're doing an IMO collection in your backyard, you're only collecting the organisms that are in your backyard.
[56:03.780 --> 56:13.780]  If you go off to a pine forest or an oak forest or down in a riparian system that you know to be healthy, think of the diversity that you're bringing in.
[56:14.780 --> 56:16.780]  And those are seasonal too.
[56:16.780 --> 56:21.780]  There's no reason why you're not collecting spring, summer, winter and fall from all these different locations.
[56:22.780 --> 56:27.780]  Once they're into the IMO2 form, they're shelf stable indefinitely.
[56:27.780 --> 56:30.780]  So you can pull them, use them as you see fit.
[56:30.780 --> 56:42.780]  So if you're, you know, you're building an IMO pile in spring, add your summer ones in there because by the time it's ready and kicking off, bam, you've got, you know, a product ready to go to amend in the middle of the summer.
[56:43.780 --> 56:46.780]  So, you know, huge ups for you on, you know, explaining that.
[56:46.780 --> 56:58.780]  And, and again, you know, I think the biggest missing piece of natural farming or K&F as we Americans call it, is the lack of understanding how critical IMO is.
[56:58.780 --> 57:00.780]  It's the foundation of natural farming.
[57:01.780 --> 57:02.780]  The inputs are secondary.
[57:03.780 --> 57:05.780]  They are only secondary.
[57:05.780 --> 57:13.780]  The foundation starts with the organisms first and then to help to build those organisms, keep them healthy.
[57:13.780 --> 57:16.780]  That's when their preparations come into play.
[57:16.780 --> 57:19.780]  And people just think that, oh, I'm just going to use some FPJ.
[57:19.780 --> 57:27.780]  Well, if you didn't, if you're not working on an IMO in your pot first or sprayed on your plants like a liquid IMO, why are you feeding?
[57:28.780 --> 57:29.780]  What are you feeding?
[57:29.780 --> 57:30.780]  You're feeding nothing.
[57:30.780 --> 57:31.780]  Right.
[57:31.780 --> 57:32.780]  Exactly.
[57:32.780 --> 57:36.780]  You're feeding, you know, some of the organisms that probably won't use those, those preparations.
[57:36.780 --> 57:43.780]  So, you know, I encourage, big encouragement to anybody out there that wants to go down the natural farming path.
[57:43.780 --> 57:46.780]  Start with your IMO.
[57:46.780 --> 57:48.780]  Focus all your energy on that.
[57:48.780 --> 57:52.780]  And once you've mastered that, then start thinking about getting the preparations.
[57:52.780 --> 57:56.780]  You can buy the preparations through a number of sources like Marco here.
[57:56.780 --> 58:01.780]  So, you know, don't worry about, you know, diving into that rabbit hole.
[58:01.780 --> 58:06.780]  Focus on the IMO first, build a foundation, then you can build a skyscraper on top of it.
[58:06.780 --> 58:07.780]  Yeah, that's right.
[58:07.780 --> 58:08.780]  Great words.
[58:09.780 --> 58:13.780]  Yeah, well, dude, like you, man, you're laying down the nuggets.
[58:13.780 --> 58:19.780]  You know, use Mother Nature's, you know, one billion years of anti-technology.
[58:19.780 --> 58:21.780]  Follow her lead, man.
[58:21.780 --> 58:23.780]  You don't have to test it.
[58:23.780 --> 58:24.780]  It's already been tested.
[58:24.780 --> 58:25.780]  You know?
[58:25.780 --> 58:27.780]  You don't have to test it.
[58:27.780 --> 58:28.780]  Certified.
[58:28.780 --> 58:29.780]  Certified.
[58:29.780 --> 58:30.780]  Yeah, certified.
[58:30.780 --> 58:37.780]  Oh, dude, I'm telling you, I'm working in a number of grows out here in SoCal.
[58:37.780 --> 58:43.780]  And the hardest thing with these guys is, oh, we'll just build a little section over here and we can try it.
[58:43.780 --> 58:45.780]  I'm like, try it.
[58:45.780 --> 58:47.780]  Why do you need to try it?
[58:47.780 --> 58:48.780]  It works.
[58:48.780 --> 58:49.780]  You know?
[58:49.780 --> 58:57.780]  And if you don't believe me, I'll give you a list of places that are up and running that are bigger than your facility that are knocking it out of the park because they did this.
[58:57.780 --> 58:59.780]  Well, there's one in Vegas that's killing it.
[58:59.780 --> 59:01.780]  And I'm sure you all know who they are.
[59:01.780 --> 59:07.780]  Yeah, there's another one in Parachute, Colorado, that's knocking it out of the park.
[59:07.780 --> 59:08.780]  First run.
[59:08.780 --> 59:10.780]  And these guys never grew cannabis before.
[59:10.780 --> 59:12.780]  And they knocked it out of the park.
[59:12.780 --> 59:16.780]  So, you know, they trusted the professionals around them.
[59:16.780 --> 59:22.780]  They hired people that were competent, not people that talked a lot, people that had been doing the work.
[59:22.780 --> 59:25.780]  And they trusted the process.
[59:25.780 --> 59:27.780]  And they got really good genetics.
[59:27.780 --> 59:30.780]  And, bam, the combination was killer.
[59:30.780 --> 59:35.780]  When we're environment, genetics, and soil, there you go.
[59:35.780 --> 59:36.780]  All right.
[59:36.780 --> 59:45.780]  So I feel like another thing that a lot of the viewers want to learn from you, buddy, is vermicomposting and how important, you know, I feel like I echo this on.
[59:45.780 --> 59:55.780]  It's just another way to kind of that ignition switch that you need to kind of start that spark can come from a variety of different amendments.
[59:55.780 --> 01:00:00.780]  But it also seems like the composting worms become the intestines, if you will, of that soil medium.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.780]  And as they begin to spread around in that medium, they're building those dissolved oxygen channels.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:12.780]  And it seems like that's where you, again, are able to take a step back and be more of a manager of that system.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:26.780]  And that seems where you, again, will have an aha moment when you start to have the praying leaves, the whole gamut of what it really takes to see that a living soil system is being beneficial.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.780]  Oh, yeah. And even you guys with the isopods and everything.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:40.780]  And I know you do a lot with jumpers. I keep a small, definitely keep a small worm bin for traditional red wigglers.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:50.780]  I also found that a friend of mine gave me a huge pile of like five-year-old wood chips and I brought them to my house and they were like loaded with jumpers.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.780]  So I didn't realize we even had the jumpers around this area.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.780]  So, yeah, worm and vermicompost is very important.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:04.780]  You know, it's a good way to break down even food scraps and things like that.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:11.780]  So what I like to do is not just so vermicompost is awesome, but I don't just put food scraps in there.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.780]  I like to bokashi my stuff first and then put it in the worm bin.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.780]  I feel like they break it down faster.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:26.780]  And, you know, I just feel like I like that with the addition of the lab.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.780]  You know what I mean? I think it makes a nice, healthy worm castings.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.780]  And so, yeah, I like I typically try to bokashi things first.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:41.780]  That's something we hadn't talked about, but that's a good method as well for fermentation and aerobic.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.780]  Yeah, just the overall health, it seems like of what you're creating there is again next level.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.780]  So you definitely understand the concepts of what it really takes to build these soil systems.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:59.780]  And then again, you can kind of take a step back and focus on other things to improve the overall health of your garden and continue education.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:06.780]  That's something else. When I was first learning how to do a lot of this, a majority of my day sometimes would be mixing.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:19.780]  So, you know, if you're able to minimize that and continue to improve week after week, I think a lot of people are starting to see the light just from a workload, labor load viewpoint as well.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:30.780]  It's easier like you set up a nice 65 or a good size indoor and get some blue mats or something.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:36.780]  It's so easy. Like, you know, like there's I don't know, some people must.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.780]  I'm getting older. I don't like all that hard work like I used to.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.780]  But, you know what I mean? So I like to let things work for me.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:51.780]  You know what I mean? And part of that is my soil. I like to let that work for me.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:03:00.780]  Like you said, the worms. Like right now, if we're sitting here talking and you've got millions and billions of bodies working for you, you know what I mean?
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.780]  And they're not doing anything but good. They're not taking any time off.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.780]  You know, so that's why that's the importance of just focusing on your microbes.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.780]  Like it's very important because it's all it's just it's power.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.780]  You notice when you build a compost pile, think of all the heat that that puts out.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.780]  You know what? What's making all that heat? There's tiny little microbes that you can't even see.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:30.780]  So that's energy. You know what I mean? Focus on getting that energy in your soil.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.780]  You know, things that you buy packaged in bottles and things like that.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:42.780]  That's energy as well, but it's not sustainable because now it's counting on you to go back to the store and do it again.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:47.780]  You know, so if you start focusing on your microbes, it's a lot cheaper.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:54.780]  It's where you can spend more money on lights, you know, or environment, you know, instead of nutrients.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.780]  And you don't have to work as hard.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.780]  You really don't. You really don't.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:07.780]  Yeah. Time is money, right? So you're not working as hard and you're letting the nature take her, take the reins.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:12.780]  Then you've got time to walk in and observe and collect wild craft.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.780]  I do my other businesses.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.780]  Right. Right. You're you're you're paying your day job.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.780]  So that's something I want to hit back on was the Bokashi.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:35.780]  Now, one of the things that I hear a lot of in beginners who are who are working in creating a Burma compost system is this stuff goes anaerobic and they have massive die offs.
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:44.780]  And that's that's because they're putting too much food in there quickly and it gets soupy and nasty and anaerobic and the worms won't eat it.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:49.780]  And in some cases it ends up killing the worms because they're trapped underneath it.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:55.780]  So by Bokashi, you're taking a lot of the pressure of them having to do all the work.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:03.780]  So it's like pre digesting it, making it more available and less risky for your for you to have a worm collapse.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.780]  So can you can you. Yeah. Can you touch a little bit more on that?
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:14.780]  Because, again, I think that was a really brilliant piece to a big problem when you're when you're starting out and you don't really know what you're doing.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:24.780]  Yeah. And I noticed I've had those trial runs with worm farms, you know, starting out and it was too wet and loaded with red mites, you know.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:34.780]  And I found, man, like with worm compost, vermicompost, less is more like putting a lot less and not tending to it as much.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:41.780]  You're going to get a whole lot more out of it. One thing like I grow a lot of comfrey and, you know, we all like comfrey.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:47.780]  It's an awesome plant. So, you know, you could just take those leaves and, you know, you could do a lot of things.
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:53.780]  What I do is right now I've been just got them all sitting in a bucket, you know, doing their Bokashi thing.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:58.780]  And then I'll just straight use those as feed for my black soldier fly.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.780]  So what you can do is you can kind of dial in.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:12.780]  So what I'm doing is I'm going to have this one run of black soldier fly, you know, vermicast or compost, and it's going to be all comfrey.
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:19.780]  It's going to be comfrey, you know, exoskeletons from the black soldier fly and all the bacteria and everything else they pooped out.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:25.780]  You know, so you can do that with comfrey. You can take in anything else. You can take alfalfa.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:32.780]  You can do that. So you can kind of find, you know, make yourself your own craft blends of these different things.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:39.780]  And you can kind of just keep them on, you know, use them when you want or, you know, use them, combine them with other things.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:45.780]  To me, that's all getting, you know, adding more diversity, adding more mineral diversity, nutrient.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.780]  Like all of that is is to me is beneficial.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:07:01.780]  So definitely when you work, if you have issues with your vermicompost, try to Bokashi the scraps first and then also less.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:07.780]  It's always going to be more with those little systems like that.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:12.780]  And I would say add some calcium. It seems like if they're sluggish like that, just add some calcium.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:19.780]  And if you guys are familiar with the avocado tech. So that's another way to really start to build up those systems.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:26.780]  If you only have maybe 100 to 200 worms in your soil medium, just check out the avocado tech.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.780]  That's all over Instagram. There's a variety of people that talk about that.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.780]  But I feel like that's another way to continue to grow those systems for pennies on the dollar.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:39.780]  Just make sure that it's an organic. They always put a nine in front of that avocado.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.780]  Some stores are pretty deceiving with the way that they pitch that stuff.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.780]  But a nine will always be on that product code so that you always know that it's organic.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:57.780]  And then my opinion, that's another little nugget that seems to really help the beginner farmers so that they don't have a huge fungus net issues and stuff like that.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.780]  By just having enough biology going on in there. Yeah.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.780]  Yeah, that's right. Don't overpopulate that baby.
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:19.780]  There was another little piece that you dropped too is that in your blends, you're giving yourself these incredible macro nutrient sources for feeding your plant.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:26.780]  A lot of people in the older cannabis crew, the OGs, were using a lot of insect frass.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:32.780]  And insect frass is an amazing source of your macro nutrients along with some of your micros.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:56.780]  And again, so you're combining all these different things and you could liquefy that and spray it on the plant fully and you're just going to power that plant up because it doesn't have to burn its energy currency, ATP, which is the conversion of sunlight into enzymes, into sugars or exudates to feed the biology.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.780]  So the biology feeds it.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:08.780]  So again, these tricks you've come up with are just amazingly simple, incredibly diverse and proven, time proven.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.780]  And so having a resource of insect frass is fantastic.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.780]  The biggest problem has always been that it goes anaerobic so quickly.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:27.780]  So having your own little bin of these black soldier fly larva and feeding them is an amazing resource that you have right at your fingertips.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.780]  Yeah, and it's easy to do.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:40.780]  Yeah, like if you put out some comfrey, a little bit of comfrey and some water or alfalfa and some water, man, black soldier flies are coming.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.780]  Like they'll come for free.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.780]  So just read up on that a little bit.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.780]  I have kind of my own little way that I do it because I got I use what I get.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.780]  A friend of mine had a pretty cool stainless steel grease tank.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.780]  It was like a restaurant grease tank.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.780]  So I kind of converted that.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.780]  But you kind of got to suit it to fit what you what you got.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.780]  But read up on your black soldier flies.
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.780]  Lots of little different techniques.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.780]  But they are like they come to you.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:14.020]  You don't have to spend money at all if you want black soldier fly.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:16.020]  Wise words, my friend.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.020]  Don't don't work.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.020]  Let nature come to you.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.020]  They flew right to me, man.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:27.020]  And I said, well, damn, I guess I'm black soldier fly composting now.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.020]  So, you know what I mean?
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.020]  That's kind of how it kicked off.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.020]  And then once once you got that, then you then now I say, OK, let me cultivate it.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:40.020]  You know, let me give it a little bit more massage and give them exactly what they want.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.020]  But they came for free.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.020]  So it's pretty cool.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:53.020]  Have you ever inoculated with predatory mites or anything to kind of just get that going, whether it's in the soil or within the foiler as well?
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:11:00.020]  I've done the I've done the like predator mites in the past when I've had things like spider mites.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:07.020]  And now in my outdoor gardens, I do the I grow a lot of eggplant and flea beetles are bad.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:13.020]  So I've been getting the beneficial nematodes and they really work, man.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:18.020]  Like my like last year, my my eggplants were shot all up like buckshot.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.020]  You know, it's tough. It was their flea beetles were tear my ass up.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.020]  And, you know, because obviously we're not spraying chemicals.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.020]  So, man, I got on those nematodes, man.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.020]  It was like night and day this year.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:34.020]  So I'm a believer in them and all the biological stuff.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.020]  I think all that stuff is wonderful.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:41.020]  I think there's a lot of that we don't even know the benefits of yet.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:47.020]  One thing I want to mention about black soldier fly, they also like when you get black soldier flies,
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:57.020]  their larvae produce different whatever chemicals, biochemicals that they actually prevent regular house flies from coming into that area.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:01.020]  They they outcompete them and they basically push them out.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:12.020]  So if you have black soldier flies, they're going to do really good at keeping the pest flies down in your garden, too.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:20.020]  Yeah, they'll rarely share like a bit like you rarely see like fly larvae and black soldier fly in the same food because they they just can't.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.020]  Have you experimented like, well, they kind of evolved to where you can have it,
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:30.020]  where the springtails will be in there as well as the black soldier larvae, as well as the rove beetle?
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.020]  Or will that one kind of take over that whole system?
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:41.020]  Now that I'm not sure. That's a good question. I'm not sure if the rove beetles will get in there.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:47.020]  But, you know, I think what what happens is when I look at my black soldier fly compost,
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:55.020]  it's I don't think that the rove beetles will have a lot of pests to even eat on in there.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:59.020]  So that's a good question, Brian, but I'm not sure.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:07.020]  Yeah, I've I've personally found that I have to add white springtails if I'm going to try to also keep up the rove beetles.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.020]  And back to that, a lot of that chitin, you need a ton of insect frass.
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:17.020]  Like Leighton was saying, it seems like to be able to properly reproduce the rove beetles.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:25.020]  Is there any certain food sources that you feel like help populate or speed up black soldier fly reproduction?
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:34.020]  Yeah, they really love. I did some research on that and I read a study they had and they really love.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:42.020]  It was funny. They they grew they grow the fattest on chicken feed for some weird reason.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:49.020]  But I'm not too concerned with, you know, maximizing their growth necessarily.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:57.020]  I more just want them to eat the stuff that I'm, you know, that I'm giving them for my own concoctions.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.020]  But but I did read if you if you get into them and you're going for production,
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:06.020]  the best bang for your buck feed is just an off the shelf chicken feed.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:12.800]  So that's that's like kind of the extent I know on that.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  I love the idea of you using your your other inputs, your comfrey and your alfalfa meal to feed them,
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:26.800]  because now you're getting a nitrogen bump as well as all those other micro and macro nutrients and the insect frass.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.800]  So it's just it's a wonderful, you know, it's like worm castings.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:37.800]  Yeah, it's digested, ready to use product that's that that you made at home for nothing.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.800]  Exactly. Super low cost, man. Super low tech.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.800]  Exactly. Easy. Like the stuff doesn't have to be, you know, expensive to do it.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.800]  Well, you know what I mean? I want to put in.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.800]  I'm gonna see if we can do a little slide of this black soldier fly.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.800]  Oh, that'd be awesome. I'd love to see that.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:06.800]  I'm just going to grab a question. I saw someone talking about the use of diatomaceous earth in their pots and soils.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:13.800]  Look, once again, peeps, you know, if you're using a moderate amount, if you're not being a moron and using a ton of it, you're going to be fine.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:24.800]  It's only if you're using it as a insecticide that you put a huge layer or a duff layer down on top of your soil that you're going to have that glass pile that you have to climb over.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.800]  You have to climb over to get up and down in and out of the soil system.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:39.800]  And that's where you're going to lose your insects and potentially nematodes and some of the other micro arthropods are macro or no micro arthropods that are beneficial to your system.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.800]  So, you know, everything in moderation, guys, you know, there's not no reason you can't use a little bit of it.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.800]  There's definite benefit to it. So, yeah, I can't wait to see the slide, brother.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:16:01.000]  OK, yeah, let me turn it on here. I think we're still on there.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  Definitely use the powder. You don't want to use the rock form if you're going to play with DE.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  Just if you if it comes rock, crush it. Actually, if you can better yet, roll it into your blended into your soil mix so that it's getting stuck and jammed into organic matter.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  That way, it's it's less detrimental or potentially less detrimental to organisms that are moving around in the soil system.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And they're right where you want them to be, where the bacteria is doing the mining.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  So the bacteria will create a biofilm over very quickly and then start mining the minerals that they want to pull out of the D.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  Hope that you see that. I'm sorry. Can you guys see that yet?
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:17:02.860]  No, you want to activate the mic camera? Yeah, I got the mark on.
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:13.130]  It must be working. Right.
[01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:23.130]  Brian, you're going around and around. OK, I guess I guess I have to be there.
[01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:34.130]  What's that? Now. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Boom. Give it one second.
[01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:42.130]  Yeah. Oh, it's probably because Mark likes to Mike's.
[01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:56.020]  Yeah, but I'm going to do this. You sound fine to me.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:03.680]  All right. This is the black. You're still hearing me pretty good. Yeah, we can't hear you.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:21.350]  All right. Yeah, it's the black soldier fly. Problem is, I can't really get it soon.
[01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:25.350]  What magnification is this? This is the yellow right here.
[01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:43.780]  This is the. Forty eight. Yeah. There's like a lot of rough neighborhoods in there, Marcos.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:58.160]  Oh, yeah. There's a lot of stuff in there, man. Let's see.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:10.160]  So this is just like you could I don't know if you are getting a good zoom in on some of this stuff, but there's a guy right there.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:18.160]  There's tons of life in there floating around. And hey, Marco, do you have like a full screen view on that?
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:24.160]  Is that is that a camera attachment that you can. It's it's one of these little camera attachments.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.160]  But I think on the show, it's not letting me for some reason do like a full.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:36.160]  Can you turn it? Are you able to turn it clockwise and take.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:47.160]  No, Brian, this is I believe this is one of the cameras that fit into the top port, so it doesn't have the the ability to become full screen.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:52.160]  Yeah, so that kind of sucks. I know everybody can't really see and get zoomed.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:58.690]  OK, I mean, you can definitely see stuff. I'm happy with it.
[01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:03.690]  Something cool here.
[01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:07.690]  It appears you have some fungi in there for sure, right?
[01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:16.690]  Yeah, there's definitely some fungi in there. A lot of little.
[01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:22.690]  Bacteria. Do you typically get a good protozoa count with that?
[01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:28.690]  That bug compost? Yeah, I usually do, man. Like who's that guy right there?
[01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:35.090]  One like a flatulent or something like that.
[01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:40.090]  But yeah, usually we get a lot of there's a lot of fungi in there. I'm going one more.
[01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:45.090]  We can get a little bit closer on some of this stuff. Nice.
[01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:54.090]  Yeah, and then the bacteria like is super high. Yeah, I get a lot of bacteria in there.
[01:20:54.090 --> 01:21:07.090]  I feel like that comes about and you can see that for someone that maybe doesn't have the money to get their soil tested, you can kind of start to see that once your worms turn that nice, dark purple color and they have that shine and shimmer to them.
[01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:11.090]  Using things like as indicators. That's right. Yeah.
[01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:18.090]  So this is obviously like the super fire for composting worms to be able to break all this down, eat all this.
[01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:24.090]  Exactly. So, yeah, all this stuff for most part went through black soldier fly.
[01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:30.090]  And you can just see there's so many tons of bacteria and I'm finding some fungi here and there.
[01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:37.090]  Like, here we go. So, yeah, man, it's just super active.
[01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:45.090]  So this is just like one drop. You know what I mean? So this thing is getting this a bunch of pound of this stuff in your day going back.
[01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:49.090]  It's just going to be crazy.
[01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:57.090]  It really is world upon world. Like when you start to dive down into this and you can keep going down in the magnification, it's mind boggling.
[01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:03.090]  It's really cool. It kind of makes you wish, damn, I want to go. I want to see more farther in there.
[01:22:03.090 --> 01:22:09.740]  There's a diatom. Sure looks like one.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:16.740]  Yeah, diatoms come in so many different shapes and sizes. It's insane.
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.740]  So that's kind of just I wish we could have got a better shot. But, yeah, you can kind of see.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.740]  I mean, that's biology. That's life in there. You know, there's a flagellum.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.740]  Well, that's a flagellum moving around in the center of that screen right there.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  Yeah, he is. He's like eating on this piece of. Oh, there goes something over there.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:43.740]  It was a new world. It looks like a paramecium of some kind.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.740]  There we go. He's going on finding that organic patch right there.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.740]  Yeah, but it's tough. Sometimes it's following stuff around, man.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:23:00.740]  You know, it's a whole. You look up and it's an hour later. You're like, damn, what was I doing?
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.740]  Yeah, there's man, there's all kinds of goodies in there. Brown fungi.
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.740]  And there was a little fly like a leg there.
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:13.740]  There's a cool diatom right there. Yeah, it sure looks. Yeah. Damn.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:20.740]  So, yeah, just that's you know, if you guys get a microscope, it's, you know, get it.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:26.740]  Get a real expensive one and just take your time. Learn stuff. Science only has identified 10 percent of the stuff we see in here.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.740]  So don't beat yourself up trying to figure out what every single thing is.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:36.740]  You know, learn to identify, you know, fungi and things like that.
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:43.740]  But yeah, definitely get a microscope. It just helps you verify what you know is already in the soil.
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:51.740]  It's one of the greatest, greatest asset tools that you can get to really understanding, you know, are you going in the right direction or are you not?
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:59.740]  And if you if you see that your soil is healthy and has a decent soil food web and there's some kind of plant reaction.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.740]  Well, now, you know, it's only a deficiency.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:09.740]  So it's a great tool for eliminating problems when you're in the diagnostic stage.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.740]  And again, you don't have to be an expert. There's so much information online.
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.740]  The Swift microscope I got was 350 bucks. I mean, come on.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:25.740]  Who can't afford that? Right. And then with the supplies, another 50 bucks and I'm set for life as long as I take care of it.
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:31.740]  I keep it covered. You have to respect the scope because if you if you get dirt in it, it's very expensive to clean.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:36.740]  You're going to lose it for months at a time while they're going through the cleaning process.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:45.740]  And now that schools are not in session, the microscope cleaning companies are not as busy.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:49.740]  So they've laid off a lot of people. So it's just, you know, keep that in mind.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:25:00.740]  And if you really respect this tool and take care of it, you will not have any issues with, you know, stuff getting in there and, you know, causing problems.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:12.740]  Exactly. That was something Dr. Elaine Ingham would talk about is how she's she has slides from when she started, because as long as you take care of it, why would you need to buy more slides?
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:20.740]  Just simple little things like that. I still have the same cover slips I originally bought when I was at Rodale.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.740]  Unfortunately, there in Connecticut, I had to buy new ones for out here.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:31.740]  But yeah, I just clean the cover slips and I clean the slides after every view and I keep using them until I drop them.
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:38.740]  Look at this. This is this is the sea. I mean, this is the sea.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:45.740]  And I mean, the ocean has ships, man, is this crazy?
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:50.740]  Oh, yeah. Some of those diatoms are like they're just lovely.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:56.740]  They're gorgeous. So many shapes and sizes. And again, they might just be a food source.
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:06.740]  You know, I talk a lot about soil evolution. It's constantly going through flux, changing from day to day, month to month, season to season.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:13.740]  So these guys may not be of any valuable right now and they may end up sitting up or they may end up becoming a food for something else.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:25.740]  But when they're needed, they come back. And so the more diversity you have in there, the more things that will function for you in different times of the season or even hours in the day.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.740]  There's another nice diatom.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.740]  That's a big one, isn't it?
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:34.740]  Yeah, it is. Dude, I can't wait to get you some of the AMO sent out to you. It's going to pop your cork, dude.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.740]  Yeah, I do that, man.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:42.740]  Yeah, we'll trade contact information after this. And Peter, maybe you can... Do you still have that picture that I sent you?
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.740]  For the company, so the audience out here can get a hold of them?
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.740]  I can dig it up. Hold on.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.740]  I could resend it if you prefer.
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:27:07.910]  Yeah, you know the crazy thing, guys? Like we're looking at this seawater... I'm sorry, seaweed FPJ. This shit is like almost two years old. It's just been sitting.
[01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:11.910]  And look at... I mean, look how much stuff is still alive in there. You know what I mean?
[01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:13.910]  It's loaded.
[01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:19.910]  It's loaded. So microbes are always going to be here. They're not going anywhere.
[01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:30.910]  Someone asked what my product is. Just go to kingdomaquaponicsllc.com. Hit me up there and I'll get right back to you.
[01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:34.910]  And Peter, if you can't find that, I can definitely text you it again.
[01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.910]  Oh, I forgot about... Oh, is that it right there?
[01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:44.910]  Yeah, yeah. Hit them up. Again, they're not ready to roll out into all states yet, but just get on their list.
[01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:50.910]  And as soon as they do come online, they'll hit you back with an email, get your information.
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:58.910]  But it's just a mind-boggling product. How diverse and how interesting.
[01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:01.910]  That's awesome. I can't wait to check it out.
[01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:05.910]  Layton, can you see that question on the screen?
[01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:09.910]  What do you use to clean slips and slides?
[01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:23.150]  Oh, that's easy. Just regular water and a paper towel. Again, you don't have to worry about scratching them.
[01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:27.150]  If something is in the water, you can just use a paper towel.
[01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:36.150]  So, just regular water and a paper towel. Again, you don't have to worry about scratching them, especially if you get quality ones.
[01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:38.150]  Oh, there's something moving around.
[01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:39.150]  Yeah, there you go, Layton.
[01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:42.150]  So, I just keep a roll of paper towel next to my microscope.
[01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:46.150]  So, as soon as the slide comes off, I squirt it with a little bit of water.
[01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:52.150]  Carefully find the cover slip. It takes a little practice to get used to cleaning those.
[01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:55.150]  If you squeeze them too tight, you'll break them or cut yourself.
[01:28:56.150 --> 01:29:03.150]  But you have to hold them strong enough that you can take the paper towel and gently rub both sides of it at the same time.
[01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:08.150]  Kind of like the way you clean glasses. You don't just clean one side at a time. You clean both at the same time.
[01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:10.150]  Look at those guys eating in there, man.
[01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:20.150]  Another thing I've been working on, guys, is Biochar. And I call it like Super Biochar.
[01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:29.150]  This is a look into that. And what I do is, this is charred, stinging nettle stalks.
[01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:39.150]  And I went ahead and inoculated them with basically sort of a maintenance solution and some IMO4.
[01:29:41.150 --> 01:29:44.150]  And this is that Biochar right here.
[01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:48.150]  So, this is some pretty good stuff. I saw a fun graph somewhere.
[01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:54.150]  So, don't sleep like Biochar are to me one of my next big things.
[01:29:54.150 --> 01:30:05.150]  Like that's, you can't beat the carbon. And then also the way that the structure of the carbon is, it's like a microbe hotel.
[01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:08.150]  You know what I mean? Basically. So, when you add this to your soil.
[01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:11.150]  And less is more with the Biochar as well. It's kind of like you had mentioned.
[01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:16.150]  So, again, you're able to start to really produce something for pennies on the dollar.
[01:30:16.150 --> 01:30:17.150]  Yeah, really.
[01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:28.150]  And the one thing you really have to be careful about is with Biochar is it will technically last you hundreds, if not thousands of years in your soil system.
[01:30:28.150 --> 01:30:30.150]  So, it's an add once and never again.
[01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:35.150]  If you get over 15 to 20 percent by volume, you will shut down the biology.
[01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:37.150]  It'll set up the next generation of plants.
[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:40.150]  If you get over 15 to 20 percent by volume, you will shut down the biology.
[01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:46.150]  It'll set up camp on those hotels because everything they need is right there and they won't work for you.
[01:30:46.150 --> 01:30:48.150]  Oh, thank you for telling me that.
[01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:49.150]  Yeah.
[01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:57.550]  Yeah, Steinslen has great discussions about that too for people that want to check that out more.
[01:30:57.550 --> 01:31:01.550]  I feel like Mr. Steinslen understands Biochar as well.
[01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:05.550]  So, there's just a lot of fantastic people to learn from.
[01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:16.550]  So, Marcos, we really appreciate you showing us in real time is basically like this is what's going on and this is what's going to build those soil systems that everybody's after.
[01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:19.550]  This is fire here.
[01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:24.550]  I'm sure a lot of people can obviously see that, but not everybody's soil systems look like this.
[01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:26.550]  Yeah, it takes some work.
[01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:28.550]  You got to definitely build up to it.
[01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:31.550]  And that's why I like all the craft you see me doing.
[01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:32.550]  It's not for nothing.
[01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:34.550]  It's you know, there's a reason.
[01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:38.550]  And like here's a little piece of fungi kind of trying to zoom in on that.
[01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:40.550]  But yeah, definitely, man.
[01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:44.550]  Biochar is awesome.
[01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:52.550]  Like you said, it really is like a hotel for the microbial world.
[01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:56.550]  They set up camp. They seem to just start to really start to thrive.
[01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:59.550]  Yeah. Look at that fungi there.
[01:31:59.550 --> 01:32:04.550]  It's linking all up between these two pieces of organic material.
[01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:07.550]  That's what they do.
[01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:13.550]  That is a great example of creation of a micro aggregate into a macro aggregate.
[01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:20.550]  So, the bacteria create the biofilm to bond the sand, silt and clay and organic matter together on a microscopic form.
[01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:23.550]  Then the fungi come and start connecting those together.
[01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:30.550]  And then the biology or the bacteria builds biofilm on top of the lattice that's created by the fungi.
[01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:33.550]  And then more particles stick to it.
[01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:42.550]  And before you know it, you have a healthy soil system that can gas off or have great gas exchanges as well as great water infiltration.
[01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:45.550]  So, thanks for showing that.
[01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:47.550]  That was a beautiful example of that.
[01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:50.550]  I talk a ton about micro aggregates and macro aggregates.
[01:32:51.550 --> 01:32:55.550]  Yeah, definitely. Thanks for sharing that. I like the way you put that, Lee.
[01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:57.550]  My pleasure, brother.
[01:32:59.550 --> 01:33:00.550]  I'm loving this, dude.
[01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.550]  Oh, here we go. This is fun.
[01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:05.550]  Look at that head on that fungi right there.
[01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:07.550]  So, that would be a yeast.
[01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:09.550]  Oh, is that a yeast?
[01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:10.550]  That's a yeast.
[01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:14.550]  And if you look up yeast, everybody goes, oh, it's bad. It's bad. It's like molds.
[01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:15.550]  Oh, they're bad. They're bad.
[01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:16.550]  No, yeast is good.
[01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:21.550]  Yeah, people don't understand, man. There's so much of this stuff that is good.
[01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:24.550]  Just there might be a couple bad ones, right?
[01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:27.550]  So, don't put a bad name on something.
[01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:38.550]  I mean, as soon as you do that, you're preventing a successionary system and saying that the succession is not correct.
[01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:42.550]  Well, Mother Earth's been doing this a lot longer than we have.
[01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:46.550]  We need to be stewards and not try to say, oh, well, that's bad or good.
[01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:56.550]  Well, you know, one of the biggest things with your IMO piles, the reason you don't want it over 125 are your yeast with the grade first.
[01:33:57.550 --> 01:34:00.550]  So, that's a good sign. It tells me I didn't overheat this baby.
[01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:05.550]  Your pile gave you a big hug, man.
[01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:08.550]  That's right.
[01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:16.550]  Do you also feel like, Marcos, when you started to understand and you're now seeing that, improving your skills under the microscope to see these things come alive,
[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:29.550]  it kind of is that catalyst for you, yourself, to want to continue farming in this manner because you can see, like, wow, I'm literally creating this little utopia and all these little soil mediums.
[01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:36.550]  Yeah, man. It's like they become little projects within the overall project of growing.
[01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:42.550]  Their overall outcome is the food you're going to eat or your product, whatever you're growing.
[01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:54.550]  But within doing that, it's like you've got these little projects that are also part of it, like making your inputs and adding different biology into your soil.
[01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:57.550]  So, yeah, I mean, it's just awesome, man.
[01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:04.550]  The microscope really enlightens you, just lets you know that, damn, what I'm thinking is there is there.
[01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:06.550]  That's always great.
[01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:11.550]  I feel like for some of us, we need that affirmation to kind of start to see, like, all right, here we go.
[01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:14.550]  We're starting to move forward. I'm checking on it every day.
[01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:23.550]  And then with the microscope, that's how you're able to take your skill set to the next level because you're like, I mean, your stuff, obviously, honestly, bro, is next level.
[01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:29.550]  And I'm sure Leighton would attest that most of the samples out there are not as live and active.
[01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:35.550]  So, again, that's kind of proof that you're out there just creating next level stuff.
[01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:41.550]  Not only show that your photos, but here we are in real time showing that under the microscope.
[01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:44.550]  Yeah, yeah. And I thought it was important to do this, man.
[01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:53.550]  I like that you guys are live and in a way like it's almost easier live because you know, you're doing a podcast.
[01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:59.550]  Not to say the wrong thing or look at, you know, but this I like the flow of this, man.
[01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:02.550]  And yeah, definitely like there's no cheating.
[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:07.550]  There's no cheating. It is either growing good microbes or you're not.
[01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:13.550]  There's things you can do, like we've talked about the whole show to kind of help benefit and boost that up.
[01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:17.550]  But, you know, the slides aren't going to lie on you.
[01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:22.550]  Hey, Marco, I got to give a little shout out to a friend of ours in Australia.
[01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:27.550]  Big ups, Riley, wherever you went. And he's he's getting a scope now.
[01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:31.550]  So, you know, he's on the journey now.
[01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:34.550]  Very good. I love that, man.
[01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:38.550]  I love people reaching out to me and you'd be surprised, man.
[01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:46.550]  A lot of women are hitting me up and saying, hey, I just made I am like, guys, y'all got to step up because of this.
[01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:49.550]  A lot of women are like killing it.
[01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:53.550]  Marco, look, I made IMO two. I'm ready to make the IMO three.
[01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:56.550]  Like, you know, jump in there, y'all. It's not that hard, man.
[01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:00.550]  And the worst thing you're going to lose is a little bit of rice or something, Marco.
[01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:02.550]  Sugar ain't the end of the world.
[01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:06.550]  No, you can't be afraid to try. That's for sure.
[01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:14.550]  And I don't know what it is. I mean, there's there's not a lot of women that are out there, you know, putting themselves out to say, hey, you know, I'm doing the work.
[01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:19.550]  So, you know, if you if you discover them or groups, you know, by all means, let us know about them.
[01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:23.550]  We're more than happy to bring them on the show and, you know, and showcase their skills.
[01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:29.550]  I mean, women think with both sides of their head, they're even smarter than we are for the most part.
[01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:32.550]  I found my wife there all the time.
[01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:35.550]  You got a dual Pentium processor.
[01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:39.550]  But you got to use it.
[01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:42.550]  But yeah, man. So what are we looking like on time?
[01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:49.550]  Yeah, we're about we're almost two hours in and I rarely sit down this long, fellas.
[01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:58.550]  Right. You know, and that's that's something that I've learned when when Brian originally wanted to do this.
[01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:01.550]  I was like, oh, so we're going to do it for an hour. Cool. No problem.
[01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:03.550]  I think we did that for about a minute.
[01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:04.550]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:08.550]  Yeah. You get rolling and you don't want to let the fun end.
[01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:15.550]  So like you said, we don't want to be structured or rigid with like what we're trying to do.
[01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:20.550]  We want everything to be organic so that we're sitting here having a conversation with one another.
[01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:24.550]  And what comes from that is, you know, we're trying to be organic.
[01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:26.550]  We're trying to be organic.
[01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:30.550]  We're trying to be organic so that we're sitting here having a conversation with one another.
[01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:36.550]  And what comes from that is hopefully extremely beneficial for the viewers.
[01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:39.550]  Oh, that looks like a rotifer there.
[01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:41.550]  Yeah. He's plowing through some stuff, ain't he?
[01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:46.550]  Yeah. Yeah. It could be a rotifer or a stock ciliate. It's hard to tell. He's buried in that.
[01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:49.550]  Look, he's sucking stuff in. He's sucking it in for him.
[01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:52.550]  He's pushing stuff out and pulling it back in.
[01:38:53.550 --> 01:39:00.550]  Yeah. They're great at building soil structure in what I want to call abused soil systems.
[01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:04.550]  So because they have, they look like street sweepers with a tail.
[01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:08.550]  And so they have the cilium are sweeping everything into their mouths.
[01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:18.550]  And they're just tearing through the organic matter that's covered with the bacteria and nutrient cycling like crazy.
[01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:28.550]  So they're great at decompacting soils and providing aeration or air pathways, of course, water infiltration.
[01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:33.550]  So Elaine used to get mad at me saying, oh, those are bad guys. Those are bad guys.
[01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:36.550]  And I'm like, Elaine, they're not. They're anoxic. They're not anaerobic.
[01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:39.550]  They're oxygen tolerant organisms.
[01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:41.550]  And they do serve a purpose.
[01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:47.550]  Yeah, they do. And, you know, I don't a lot of people get hung up on bad and good.
[01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:51.550]  And one of the principles, like we said, trust the process.
[01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:55.550]  One of the principles is good and bad are the same when the things are in balance.
[01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:58.550]  So think about it like that.
[01:39:59.550 --> 01:40:03.550]  Every every handful of soil you grab is going to probably have some anthrax in it.
[01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:08.550]  It's probably going to have some other shit that's bad, but it's not going to have enough in it.
[01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:12.550]  It's not going to have enough in it that's going to be out of balance and make anything or anybody sick.
[01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:19.550]  So when you when you focus on that micro diversity, you know, I feel like that's going to eventually just balance itself out.
[01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:22.550]  Yeah, I love the way you put that, my friend.
[01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:27.550]  You know, I often define that term good and bad as a problem.
[01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:31.550]  As soon as you define something as good, you've defined something as bad.
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:33.550]  There is no bad or good. Ying and yang.
[01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:36.550]  They're very important and they need to stay in balance.
[01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:41.550]  If one thing gets out of balance, you know, too good or too bad, you've got an issue.
[01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:51.550]  And so it's really about surfing the gray line and diversity, making sure that you have an incredible, diverse system and you're not going to you're not going to have any problems.
[01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:54.550]  Like you said, I mean, no pests, no diseases.
[01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:58.550]  To be honest with you, I truly believe that insects can't even see the plant.
[01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:04.550]  The insects are only here to consume things that are shouldn't be consumed by other animals.
[01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:09.550]  So they're doing a job of saving us or saving the cow or saving the bird.
[01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:11.550]  Killing the weak.
[01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.550]  Yeah, killing the weak, taking them out.
[01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:15.550]  And, you know, I hear people, oh, weeds, weeds.
[01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:17.550]  There's no such thing as a friggin weed.
[01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:19.550]  That plant is telling you something.
[01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:32.550]  It's telling you that there's a deficiency and that plant's job is to mine that deficient mineral, bring it up to the surface and make it available for the soil surface to continue on its journey through evolution.
[01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:36.550]  So, you know, no such thing as bad or good, man.
[01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.550]  Yeah. Look at that fungi growing out of that carbon right there.
[01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:41.550]  Peter, can you blow that up?
[01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:43.550]  Oh, there you go. Bam.
[01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:45.550]  And that, you know, that's another thing.
[01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:54.550]  I have a good friend, Dr. Efren Chavez, and he and I have been buddies and worked on a number of projects nationally over the last year, 10 years or so.
[01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:57.550]  And he and Elaine Buckhead's about this.
[01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:08.550]  And I truly believe he is correct that just because it is clear, low diameter and no visual septi or septa does not necessarily mean it's bad.
[01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:11.550]  It could be in its early teenage years.
[01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:22.550]  And the way Efren puts it, it takes seven to 10 days for a fungi to go from a spore into a mature adult, which you can identify as a saprophyte.
[01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:27.550]  So you can't watch that fungi for seven to 10 days in the microscope because it's going to dry out.
[01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:37.550]  So the only really way to decide whether this is a good guy or a bad guy is to use all the information around what you're observing.
[01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:41.550]  Are there good fungi? Are there good nutrient cyclers? Is there balance?
[01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:51.550]  And if everything looks healthy and good, then if it's clear and small diameter, then I'm going to assume it's good because all the other things are good.
[01:42:52.550 --> 01:43:03.550]  And so if the opposite is true as well, if there's no life, it's just bacteria, the plants or the soil that I took it from smell or look bad, then I'm going to say, okay, that's a pathogenic fungi.
[01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:06.550]  We need to get some good guys in play here.
[01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:08.550]  And they'll balance out.
[01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:33.550]  I mean, you know, on the Learn Living Soils, we talked to Dr. James White about the power of the diversity of biology in a point where if a pseudomona bacteria is present in a soil system where there's fusarium, that pseudomona will actually turn that fusarium into a saprophytic fungi, a good guy.
[01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:37.550]  And so again, there's all these interactions that we don't understand.
[01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:40.550]  Earlier, we've only identified about 10%.
[01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:42.550]  Dude, it's way less than that.
[01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.550]  It's less than that, right?
[01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:46.550]  One percent?
[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:49.550]  Yeah, every year they come out and say, oh, no, we just found another 10 billion organisms.
[01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:51.550]  That means we know a quarter of one percent.
[01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:53.550]  Right.
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:57.550]  So the more we learn, the more we realize there's so much more out there.
[01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:59.550]  Point is, we don't know.
[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:01.550]  We don't know shit.
[01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:05.550]  I'm going to be blunt about it. We don't know shit.
[01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:08.550]  Why do you think we don't focus on that as a. . .
[01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:11.550]  There's no money in it, Brian. There's no money.
[01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:15.550]  Because you cannot separate microbes and sell them, really.
[01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:17.550]  Yep, bottom line.
[01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:19.550]  Monsanto did GMO, right?
[01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:26.550]  They captured the seed market and fucked the farmers by producing seeds that didn't grow to seed.
[01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:32.550]  And worse yet, they gave it viruses so that plant would die off in a few years.
[01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:34.550]  So they had to buy more seed.
[01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:36.550]  You know?
[01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:40.550]  I hope and pray the U.S. government will never allow that to happen again.
[01:44:41.550 --> 01:44:42.550]  Yeah, that was horrible.
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:48.550]  And they've said that they won't, but I'm so discouraged with the system now.
[01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:55.550]  And the way all businesses are focused on producing products that break so that you have to buy another one.
[01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:57.550]  And so you throw it in a landfill.
[01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:00.550]  And we're just our own worst enemy.
[01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:02.550]  Nothing ever lasts anymore.
[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:04.550]  Nope, nope.
[01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:06.550]  It's really sad.
[01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:10.550]  Our washing machine started spitting grease on the sheets.
[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:12.550]  And so we called the landlord.
[01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:15.550]  The landlord called the guy and he said, OK, yeah, $600.
[01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:17.550]  And it's like, what?
[01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:23.550]  To come and change a bearing in a washing machine is $600?
[01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:25.550]  It's part of the system.
[01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:27.550]  Because they want you to throw it away and go buy another one.
[01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:29.550]  Yeah, right.
[01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:31.550]  Or they want a better one.
[01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:33.550]  It's cheaper to buy a new one.
[01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:38.550]  But, you know, again, that bearing is literally a dollar part.
[01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:41.550]  And they're doing it on purpose.
[01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:45.550]  They're not making waterproof bearings that will last like they did in the past.
[01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:49.550]  I mean, my parents had a washing machine for I don't know how many years.
[01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:56.550]  Here's the part that pisses you off, Leighton, is they spend money to find out how long the shit's going to last.
[01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:59.550]  And then, you know what I mean?
[01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:01.550]  That's the painful part about it.
[01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:02.550]  They're actually finding that out.
[01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:14.550]  Yeah, there's guys that are making millions of dollars sitting around figuring out how to time the obsolescence of that, whatever it is, whether it's your phone, your computer, your washing machine.
[01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:20.550]  It's just it's a disgusting example of humanities and their greed.
[01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:22.550]  It really is.
[01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:24.550]  What you got there?
[01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:26.550]  I might have to zoom out a little bit.
[01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:28.550]  Yeah, something big.
[01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:29.550]  I found fun there.
[01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:37.550]  That might be a yeast based on the club head because yeast can go back to filamentations.
[01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:39.550]  Oh, they do? OK.
[01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:42.550]  They can. Yeah. Yeah. And again, we don't know shit, dude.
[01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:49.550]  You know what? I appreciate that because normally it's just me, you know, and I like to have that second set of eyes.
[01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:53.550]  Hey, dude, we'll change it. We'll exchange contacts for sure.
[01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:58.550]  We can shoot, you know, micro porn back and forth.
[01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:00.550]  Definitely.
[01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.550]  And this is just an IMO for here.
[01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:08.550]  This is a sample of IMO for.
[01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:24.320]  And are you using any other like at this point, are you using anything to kind of improve IMO for at this, you know, at this level or are you just kind of against managing things now?
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:34.320]  Yeah, I'm just managing and then just trying a little bit of, you know, running it through different critters more or less.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.320]  But, yeah, not adding anything to it, still doing it the traditional way.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:44.320]  This one is actually this is actually a acorn.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.320]  IMO for nice.
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:51.320]  Can you zoom in on the mouse so we can identify it?
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.320]  And there was I'm going to I'm going to field a question in the chat.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  They wanted to know, you know, where to collect IMO.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  And to be honest with you, IMO, you want to find a place that has been the least disturbed as possible.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.320]  So you have to use a little common sense.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.320]  Look around your area.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:18.320]  Find a niche where the land was perhaps too rugged for development or for a house or road to be put in there.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.320]  And you see old growth trees and healthy trees, not trees that are dying off.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.320]  Do not collect where you see a lot of diseased organisms.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:32.320]  Again, you need to get you need to get into your spiritual space.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.320]  You need to bring in, you know, positive energy into the forest.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:45.320]  You know, say a little prayer, meditate, whatever you want to do, that the forest will guide you to where you're supposed to collect.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.320]  And then when you get to that spot that you think is right, use your nose.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.320]  The nose will never let you down.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.320]  It is here to make sure that we don't eat something that is going to be really bad for us.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320]  Like if it smells like it, don't eat it.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  Right. You know that.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  Smells really good.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  Chances are you're going to find a good collection there.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.320]  And then as many diverse places as you can find.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  So, you know, travel outside of your little comfort zone.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  Get out of the hood.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:20.320]  Go up, you know, go to a mountain or go to a park nearby that's been there for a long time.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:29.320]  Unfortunately, pretty much all of America has been disturbed, except for some places like in the Redwood Forest, you know, up in Humboldt.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.320]  Because those trees take thousands of years to grow.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.320]  So you can tell it has not been disturbed for thousands of years.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:39.320]  But for the most part, everything was logged off to build the shipping trade.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.320]  There's a beautiful fungi.
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.320]  So, you know, use your common sense.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  You want different diverse areas like a meadow, a riparian system, a grove of, you know, old pine trees or old oak trees or a mix of both.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  As many different places as you can find that are undisturbed and that you can, you know, you can tell there's not a lot of human activity.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.320]  Like hiking trails.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.320]  Like don't, you know, don't take a collection right next to a hiking trail, obviously.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:17.320]  And another trick is like get yourself some landscape flags or something that you can mark the spot with.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:25.320]  When I did an IMO collection this spring, the hardest thing was to remember, oh, I know it was somewhere around here.
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:32.320]  And so I could find it because you've, you know, covered it up and made it pretty obvious or not obvious to the human eye.
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.320]  It can become problematic to find it.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:42.320]  So, you know, a stick or, you know, upright stick or something, a little flag so you can make sure that you can find it when you get back there.
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.320]  That's another important trick.
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  All right.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:53.320]  And if you're in the woods where you still have a phone reception, I know a lot of people that use the they drop a pin.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.320]  And there you go.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.320]  Yes.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:05.320]  Here's another thing like I use like I'd like sharing on Instagram, but really Instagram is a way another way for me to keep records.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.320]  Like, you know, I've made this IMO on this day.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.320]  I made the video, you know, so like it kind of helps you as you know, kind of a way to keep your records.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  I think that one's that one's looks like he's about dead.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.320]  You know, it's hard to tell.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.320]  I can't see his mouth.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.320]  It's hard to see that mouth.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.320]  I can't see his stomach.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.320]  So I can't identify whether it's a bacterial.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:35.320]  It's definitely not a predator and it's definitely not a root feeder.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:37.320]  So it could be a switcher.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320]  It could be a switcher would be my guess.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.320]  An omnivore that can switch from eating fungus to bacteria.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.320]  Yeah.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.320]  So good diversity, my friend.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320]  Really good diversity.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.320]  And then you always see the thing that you don't even know what it is.
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:02.320]  That's the fun part is that is, you know, you learn so much without learning anything because the next time you see it, you go, oh, I remember last time I saw this.
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:04.320]  I was in this condition.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.320]  Right. And now I know, OK, I've seen it again in that condition.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:14.320]  So chances are that some kind of successionary species is that lives in this type of zone at this time of year.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.320]  But yeah, that's the beauty of this.
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.320]  It's it's it's the never ending story.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.320]  Oh, I wanted to drop this too while we were thinking just to kind of kick it around.
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:29.320]  So I was thinking I was like, you know, I collect IMO kind of different regions, different areas.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:36.320]  I'm wondering if like, you know, and some people have their their grow environment indoor.
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:43.320]  It's all set up. You know, some people don't have a lot of money to buy the heavy duty equipment or whatever, whatever.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:51.320]  I wonder if we could tailor the IMO to fit the way the person's environment is based on where we collected the IMO.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:59.320]  So if you know temperature and region wise kind of matching up to what you have inside your growth space.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:10.320]  Well, you know, there's there's a piece of this puzzle that a lot of people don't talk about, and that is barometric pressure, altitude and weather patterns.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:16.320]  Right. So even if you're indoors, you're still going to have some level of influence from the outside.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:21.320]  And that's why it's important to capture what you're trying to do regionally.
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:32.320]  But also, I love what you did is getting outside of your region, because remember, there was mass migrations of animals all across the country, thousands of miles.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:38.320]  And everywhere that animal stopped to eat, poop, drink, it's collecting these organisms.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  Whether they're in his feathers or in his fur. And no matter where he ran miles, the hair dried out, the bacteria, the biofilm.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:54.320]  The next time that animal got wet, guess what? The biofilm released, the organism was released in a new area.
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:01.320]  And I truly believe that that is why we were having such huge problems with our soil systems just collapsing.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.320]  So we do not have that piece of it.
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.320]  And so it's up to us to try to bring that back. And so, yeah, I mean, I'm working with a farmer in Illinois.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.320]  He's got thousands of acres and every single farmer around him is like, whoa, what are you doing?
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:29.320]  So, you know, he's gearing up to do some IMO stuff. We've already talked about getting him a compost stripper so that he can liquefy compost to apply to a field.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:36.320]  It's so much easier and cheaper and cost effective to do it that way than it is to try to spread a solid compost.
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  Especially as the wind blows, you know, it could, the compost, because you're top dressing it at an eighth inch, it'll just blow the frig away.
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:57.320]  But when it's liquefied, it's getting down into the soil and it's beginning to take hold and provide that nutrient for a very affordable price versus something that's not cost effective and not guaranteed it's even going to work.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.320]  So I think the equipment's cheaper too for spraying than it is to lay it down.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The manure spreaders are expensive and very hard to regulate.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:13.320]  Did some work back a number of years ago with biochar and trying to spread that evenly. And it was a frigging nightmare.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:29.320]  And that's where, again, on scale, this stuff is a lot more difficult to do without using some common sense and making it, you know, applying what you know to the equipment that they already have is the key to that.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:36.320]  And so they already have spray equipment. They don't do a lot of manure spreading. So, you know, we utilize what you have.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:40.320]  Oh, nice fat guy. Look at that guy go, huh?
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.320]  That's Peter.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]  That's Peter.
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:46.320]  Oh, okay.
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.320]  Oh, shit.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  That looks like a little whip tail. See how he has that little fine tail? They're usually very active. Definitely not a root feeder. Looks like a bacterial that is moving so fast, though. It's hard to see the stomachs.
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:10.320]  But I definitely don't see the spike in balls for the root feeder. So that's a good guy.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.320]  So where do you see the spike in balls when the root feeder is laid?
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.320]  So I hate to use the term, but I'm sorry, forgive me. It looks like a dick in balls.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.320]  Oh, does it?
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:36.320]  Yeah, literally. And it's inside its mouth. So, you know, the balls are the recoil. It's like the spring mechanism for it to shoot that spear into the side of the root and then recoil it so it can do it again.
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  Because a lot of times it has to hit that root, you know, a number of times before it penetrates it. And especially if you have really healthy plants, right?
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:57:11.320]  So if your plant cell walls are strong because they've been grown in both a really good humic and fulvic acid, like the power of fulvic acid is amazing. It builds cell wall strength. It increases the acidity or the enzyme inside of the bacteria so it can mine better. It elongates plant cells. It's the power of that fulvic acid is insane.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.320]  How do you make your own fulvic acid?
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  Actually, I do. I make it plant derived. So it's a difficult process. So what I do is I use worm castings, my own biological compost, and the AMO that I recommended from Keith. And I take those and I put them together and I agitate them and aerate them. And I call it soft colliding.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:51.320]  So like if we were underwater and I punched you, it wouldn't hurt, right? I would just brush you. I just brush you a little bit. So I'm brushing these, the particles and the organic matter together to strip off the fungi, strip off the protozoa, pull off all of the biofilms.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.320]  What are you doing? Just a little, like a light vortex brew or something?
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:07.320]  No. All right. Think about it this way, right? You know the difference between a mortar mixer and a compound mixer that you put on the end of a little drill?
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.320]  Yes. Yes.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:29.320]  Remember that has the fans that reverse each other? So it's like when you're spinning it, one is sucking up and the other one's throwing it down. So put your compost in the water in a five gallon bucket and use one of those on slow speed. You don't want to slash it and thrash it and throw it all over the place. You just want to collide it.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:54.320]  And then once you've collided it, you've made a biologically rich humic acid. It'll look like chocolate water. You pour that off and then you take the solids that are left and you put it in a plant press and you press it very slowly. And what you'll see come out of it is this amber colored liquid and that is pure plant derived, fresh fulvic acid.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:57.320]  What kind of screen, of screen size?
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:01.320]  Oh, good question. I use a 47 micron stainless steel screen.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.320]  Okay. So that's pretty small then.
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.320]  Yeah, it's really small. That way the particles stay in.
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:12.320]  Yeah. I got a 50 micron diesel, you know, those bucket screeners. You think 50 could do for her?
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:23.320]  Yeah. Yeah. So you got the same stuff. That's as low as I've been able to find was 47 micron. And so, yeah, that was a great suggestion is the diesel screens.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:41.320]  Well, that's good because I bought a damn fruit press a while back before I was years ago, but I didn't, uh, I thought you could press out your FPJs. I was thinking that'd be a way to get more and that's not the way to go. But so now I got this freaking fruit press. I need something to use it for.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:49.320]  You got something now, brother. And then that fulvic acid, man, oh, it just bangs the plant with health.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:57.320]  Now, now what we call humic acid is vermicompost as the leachate out of a vermicompost. Is that considered humic acid then?
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:09.320]  I would consider it humic acid if you're using humate as, or, you know, plants. If you're using manure as a bedding, it's a little bit different, but, um,
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:13.320]  Wood chips or things like that.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.320]  Yeah. Wood chips and leaves.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.320]  It's a more complete compost.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:25.320]  Yes. Yeah. What we call a vegetarian compost, right? So no, no manures.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]  No meats. That's right.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:37.320]  And you can still run like the kefir and that kind of stuff, right? Layton, if you're still trying to go the veganic route, like a kind of cooking route.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:53.320]  Yeah. There's a agro grow, the company that we talk about on the conference. They make this stuff that's called coconut cream. Right. You talk about bad-ass. Holy shit.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:02.320]  I mean, people know about coconut, coconut water because it has all the hormone in it. Wonderful additive or amendment for, for plants.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:09.320]  But the cocoa cream that he has, oh man, I put some of that on my compost pile and the fungi went nuts.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.320]  Is this a by-product of the coconut process?
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.320]  Yeah. It's part of the process, you know, of getting the meat out of the coconut.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]  That's what I was going to ask. Yeah. So it's the main meat part.
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:40.320]  So when they squeeze the meat to process it into, you know, like coconut, shredded coconut, all of the things that you use in cooking, you get this liquid that is, you know, super powerful, but highly unstable. It's again, you have to, he basically freezes it.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:42.320]  Okay.
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:53.320]  So that, so that it has shelf life. But he's not allowed to, I think, to keep it beyond a year. And he has just like this endless supply of this stuff because he's, he's moving coconuts all the time.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.320]  I need to get some of this. Who is he?
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:02.320]  Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. I'll hook you up off. Well, I, you know what, let me see if I can pull something up for the rest of the crew.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:11.320]  But coconut took it to the next level when you're using aloe, then you would kind of go to build a soil or a couple other brands out there that people know about.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:24.320]  And then when you started to mess around with that, maybe go out and buy a few coconut waters to kind of drizzle a little bit. But for the most part, I was using that powder form and it did wonders. I mean, it was, it was very.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:26.320]  Oh, you were able to get it in the powder, Brian?
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  Only in the powder. I also had never heard of the cream. So that's definitely a unique product as far as I understand.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:55.320]  The meat part is really what you want as far as, you know, as far as I understand, especially to speed up. And again, you know, adding all these little things, using our farmer brain to speed up that microbial world does seem like there is something very special about certain products as well as, you know, acorns like we were talking and then, you know, going next level with coconut meat.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  Heck yeah. I like that, man. That's the kind of thinking I like.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:01.320]  Yeah.
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:19.320]  Because you know, things like that are like cheap, you know, like somewhere somebody's throwing freaking coconuts away. You know what I mean? Or so that's stuff that's, we need to figure out, get our hands on it. But yeah, there's a lot of way, you know, a lot of stuff thrown away that we can really use.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:37.320]  Oh, dude, I'm so with you. I mean, that's why I went into, you know, starting to work with these aquaculture companies because I'm like, you guys are just dumping this in the stream. You're dumping it in. You're dumping it into the sewer system. I mean, what the fuck? That stuff's worth a fortune in agriculture.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:45.320]  You could probably dry that aquaculture water and get some kind of powder out of it if you just let it air dry.
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:04:07.320]  You know, that's a good question. The problem is the volume. A lot of these guys have to use so much water to keep the fish healthy. In recirculating aquaculture, you still have to do what's called water brightening, which is about 5 to 10% clean water pretty much daily to prevent what's called demineralization of the water.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:34.320]  Because there's this really cool thing that happens in aquaculture. I had a thousand gallon system, 150 fish. And basically all I did was add water and add fish food. Right. And when I went to clean my clarifier to collect the fish waste that I was looking for or was my goal, I would always get sand in the bottom of it.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:05:03.320]  So I finally one day I went back to a dear friend of mine, Dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons. I said, Fitzy, where the fuck is the sand coming from? Right. Like, I'm not a stupid guy, but I don't understand how water and fish food can turn into sand. And he's like, think about this. It's called mineralization. It's the reverse of what the bacteria do. Sometimes they mine material out and sometimes they re-bond the material back together in processes of taking something from something else.
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:30.320]  They create a magnetic or positive charge. And another biology does a different action. I mean, there's bacteria that eat electrons. There's bacteria that poop electrons. There's just all kinds of crazy processes that we don't completely understand. So it's called re-mineralization. That these particulate come back together again. And so that sand is extremely valuable.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:39.320]  So if you're not adding fresh water to your system, you're going to get to a point where you've stripped all the minerals out of the water and it's not going to be healthy for the fish anymore.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:06:00.320]  Well, let me ask you this, because here's how I have my plan to do my aquaponics. I was going to do similar to you said, like a thousand gallon above ground tank. But what I want to do is I'm going to link that to a natural pond that I'm going to build and kind of get them both in the same cycle.
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:13.320]  So would that help? Fish would only be in the thousand gallon part and then the pond part, I guess, I may, you know, maybe some smaller fish, but not to the volume of the big tank.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:34.320]  The only concern I'd have is the potential for a blue green algae outbreak. So my system was locked up in a commercial space in Connecticut. And unfortunately, I had the inlet for the sprinkler system for the whole building.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:48.320]  So once in a while, the fire marshal would have to come in and do his inspections. And the company that maintains it would have to come in and do a flush or whatever. And I had my tank, everything was cruising.
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:07:10.320]  One of the tricks to knowing that you're really sinking everything is when your fish water turns like a light amber color, just slightly yellow. And you'll notice the fish are like super aggressive. They're running around swimming hard. They look healthy. You know, they're playful. When you walk in the room, they all swim up and look at you.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:32.320]  So when you hit that sweet spot, you know, you're perfectly balanced. Your water quality is exactly where it needs to be. So I was at that point, I was in the sweet zone and they did some work on the sprinkler system. And one day I came in and my shop door was wide open, unlocked. And I was like, oh man.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:56.320]  And I went into my fish tank and I checked in my fish and the door to the fish, the aquaculture room was open. And I was like, oh man, someone's been in my fish tank. And I was within a few weeks after that, I started seeing fish die off. And I literally fought for, I don't know, three months to try to hold on. And in the end, I ended up losing every single fish in there.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:25.320]  Because the person that went in there obviously had been fishing in a pond or a lake nearby and accidentally brought something in and put it in and introduced it into my tank system. So I'd be really careful about, you know, keeping, unless you're keeping fish in both areas, so they can go back and forth, so that they're used to, they're not like sterile fish. They're used to having, you know, the exposure to some of these things.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:49.320]  It's kind of like, you know, getting the vaccination. You're exposing your body to that virus so that you have antibodies to fight it. My fish were sterile. They'd never seen the outside. And so I'm thinking if I can bring them to kind of the thousand and the natural pond all lying together and maybe get that balance before introducing the fish.
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:09:13.320]  Yeah. And you know what? The best thing in the world is to look at the trophic layers of a fish tank. So you want some fish that swim on the bottom, like catfish. You want some that swim in the middle, like a tilapia or a koi. And then also some that like to swim around the top. You know, because now you're having a balanced overall aquatic ecosystem.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  You'll notice that there's a synergy that happens. You know, they're all working together. One's, you know, one's cleaning the algae or the duckweed off the top. The other one's, you know, in the middle, just keeping everything stirred and agitated. And then of course the catfish on the bottom are cleaning up the waste of all the other fish and making it, putting it back into suspension so that your filtration system can collect it.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]  So there we go. Back to balance.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:10:02.320]  Yeah. That's a really good way to keep the, again, it's all about keeping the solids suspended in the water column so that you can clean it. You got it, brother. And we'll talk about it. We'll talk about a radial flow filter, which is the best way I've found to separate those fine particulate out of the water column and recirculate the water back into play.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.320]  Okay, cool. Yeah, we'll be talking for sure.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:30.320]  Yeah. Yeah. That's the biggest failure in the aquaponics world is that they don't take solid separation correctly. They don't take it responsibly. I've seen a number of different aquatic or aquaponics systems that fail to deal responsibly with suspended solids. Those suspended solids are going to build up somewhere in the corner.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:46.320]  Another thing is always use round tanks. Do not use square tanks because fish will swim right into the wall and ding their nose and then they'll get a disease. So if it's a round tank, they're more apt to just continue to swim around it and not run into a wall.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:55.320]  Right. And is it good to just keep that vortex going? Just kind of set it up to where they've got that one direction of swimming or is that not good?
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:14.320]  Well, they'll figure it out as they go. But the key to this is that you have to have a perfectly flat bottom. You have to have the appropriate size pipe at the center of that round tank out of the bottom to create the proper flow of water.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:38.320]  It's complicated, right? If your pipe is too small, you'll see a little whirlpool that happens. And now you're not collecting from the bottom. And you're going to have pockets of shit building up all the way around the outside edge and those pockets are going to go anaerobic. Now, if you have catfish, they're going to help prevent that. But there's still going to be pockets because you're not properly flowing the water in and out of the system.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.320]  We could do a whole show on aquaponics.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.320]  We actually have one coming up in end of April on livingsoils.com.
[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:51.320]  I'll be on there. I'll be doing that one.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:12:18.320]  Yeah, that's an important one. It's an important subject and I think that as humanity begins to get concerned about how we're going to get through this next hundred years, as we've destroyed our oceans, lakes, ponds, and rivers, we need fish. They're a valuable source of protein. Their feed conversion rate is insane. It's like 0.8. So every pound you put in, your fish ate 0.8 of a pound.
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:28.320]  With a cow, it's like you put in 20 pounds of food, you get one pound of growth. So it's a no-brainer.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:41.320]  The biggest problem I have, again, is the political system and money as a whole. They want huge returns. They don't want any risks. And they lobby against certain industries.
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.320]  There's no reason we don't have aquaculture systems all over our country like every other country has.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:59.320]  That's because of the damn politicians and the lobbyists who are trying to prevent that so that big industry has a stranglehold on all the fish products that come in.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  The Food Modernization Act was supposed to stop this from happening. And it in turn did the exact opposite. They're not hiring inspectors. So there's millions of tons of fish coming in from all of these countries, grown who knows how, exposed to who knows what, but they're so cheap that people will buy them.
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  And it's horrific.
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.320]  I don't.
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:34.320]  Yeah, that should not be allowed to happen. But if you've got no money and you're starving and that tilapia fillet is only a dollar for a pound, you're going to buy it because you've got no choice.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:39.320]  What I always say is, you pay for good food or you're going to pay for the doctor.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.320]  There you go. Spot on.
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:57.320]  I grew up pretty poor in Savannah, Georgia. And one thing I did learn is sockeye salmon can't be farm raised. So as long as you're looking for that, sometimes that shit is on sale. That's a way that I was able to feed myself for a long time and make sure that I was trying to get quality protein.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:13:59.320]  OK, they're only wild caught. Nice.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.320]  100. 100%. Yeah.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  OK, Savannah in the house.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:12.320]  Savannah, man, especially West Savannah. That's tough for certain reasons, you know, so it's hard to grow up in there. But I learned a lot.
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  Sure. Well, you heard of Fort Stewart. I grew up a little bit down there.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:22.320]  I learned that Edmund Ruffin fired the first shot that started the Civil War.
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:32.320]  All right, cool, man. Two hours went quick.
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.320]  Yeah, man, we appreciate it.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:41.320]  Yeah, I can't. I'm sorry, but I can't find that ad. So I'll get that for you.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.320]  OK, yeah.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:50.320]  I got a crazy.
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:53.320]  That would be me.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.320]  All right, is that better?
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:03.320]  Yeah, I have maybe like five, 10 minutes to answer some questions because that was really something that I know the audience really enjoys, man.
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  And yeah, if you don't, it's cool to know. I got time and we can ask questions because I've seen a lot of them come through. So.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  I might as well have them here because if not, they're going to hit me on Instagram.
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:25.320]  All right, so why don't we just start from the top? James Chrysler asked a while ago, have you ran into any pathogen issues from bringing in microbes from different environments?
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  No, I haven't. Kind of like we said, with the balance and everything balancing itself out.
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:37.320]  No, I haven't. I haven't. I haven't.
[02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:44.320]  No, I haven't. Kind of like we said, with the balance and everything balancing itself out.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:49.320]  No, I haven't, man. I've all of them have been collected the right way.
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:56.320]  And if I converted them to like IMO, I do it kind of the traditional and the correct way. So I haven't had any issues.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:05.320]  OK, Cheddar Bob asked, anyone know what nematodes are produced from worms, especially if different ones come from different foods?
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:15.320]  The worms are fed. So basically a correlation between what the worms are fed to the nematodes and microbes that may proliferate.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:25.320]  Well, nematodes don't come from worms, so I think that any relationship is coincidental.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.320]  Layton probably can jump into that a lot more deeper than me.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  Yeah, you're spot on. The worms do not generate the nematodes.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.320]  The nematodes are abundant in undisturbed soil areas.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:44.320]  They can get transported around, believe it or not, on the legs of flying insects.
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:50.320]  There can be tend to be in cyst form in a really good compost.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  So you're not going to see all of them active.
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:59.320]  But they are, in my opinion, the predator, the super predator of the soil system.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:07.320]  So if I'm microscoping and I see nematode, I already know that I'm in a good place unless I see a root feeder.
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:17.320]  Nematodes are relatively fast breeders because they live at a biological level, not at a level like we do.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:25.320]  So they multiply relatively quickly in time scale compared to a lot of other organisms.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.320]  And yeah, the diversity is huge.
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  Again, we've only identified a fraction.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  And more often we've identified the bad guys than the good guys.
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  But where they come from is undisturbed soil systems.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.320]  And so again, this is all part of the collection, whether it's an IMO or whether it's just a actual collecting of the duff.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.320]  But if you're going to collect the duff, please be responsible.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  Bring in some compost you made yourself.
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  Say a blessing to the forest.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:03.320]  Wherever you've taken that leaf duff, put it in one bucket and take what you've brought in and heal up that wound.
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:05.320]  Don't leave that wound open, man.
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  That's insult and slap in the face to Mother Nature.
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:12.320]  So if you're going to wildcraft, wildcraft responsibly and soulfully.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:14.320]  But that's a great place to get nematodes.
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:19.320]  And I could speak for probably half an hour on that, but let's not go there.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:27.320]  So Siddy asked a while ago, I wonder if the vinegar process breaks down hormones and enzymes.
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  The FFJ isn't about fermenting, it's about osmotic pressure extraction.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.320]  But what does vinegar do to hormones and enzymes?
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:45.320]  Well, vinegar, like we said before, FFJ is about extracting hormones and plant enzymes.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:47.320]  So that's correct.
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:53.320]  But when you make a vinegar, what I like to do is you still have those in it that they didn't leave.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:57.320]  They didn't go anywhere. But what happens is the vinegar, the sugars are converted.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  And so when you water a vinegar into your garden, you're not watering sugar into your garden.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:08.320]  So that's the reason I like to take the go straight to vinegars instead of doing the FPJ or FFJ.
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  It just depends. I still use those sometime, but I'm leaning more towards that as the reason why to eliminate the sugar.
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:21.320]  And Trinity Sacred Roots said a while ago, most things ferment without sugar.
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.320]  It's just a slower process.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.320]  That's right.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:31.320]  So you were talking acorns, John Doe KCK.
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:35.320]  I think I got that right. I dealt with this yesterday.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:41.320]  But almonds as a substitute for acorns, if you have access to almond orchards.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. If you got access, I was going to say that's going to be a good alternative.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:48.320]  But I don't know. I don't know.
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:55.320]  Hey, Peter, I just shot you a text from AgroCoco. Can you pop that up for the audience out there?
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:01.320]  They provide they make amazing, responsibly shipped,
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.320]  It's not shipped across this globe.
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:08.320]  It comes from Mexico where they're harvesting responsibly.
[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:10.320]  So it's a great alternative for the farmers.
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:12.320]  And they're doing a great job of it.
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:14.320]  And they're doing a great job of it.
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:16.320]  And they're doing a great job of it.
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:18.320]  And they're doing a great job of it.
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:20.320]  So they're doing a great job of it.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:22.320]  And I don't know if you've heard of AgroCoco.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:24.320]  I've heard of it.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:25.320]  It's not shipped across this globe.
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.320]  It comes from Mexico where they're harvesting responsibly.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.320]  It's not grown in brackish water.
[02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:32.320]  So it doesn't have the salt contaminants.
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:37.320]  You know, I was an anti-cocoa guy for years until I met this guy.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:41.320]  He only presses to 2.2 pounds.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:43.320]  So he's not crushing the fiber.
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:48.320]  When you crush the fiber, it no longer has the potential to hold nutrients and water.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.320]  And it actually becomes a problematic in the soil system.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:57.320]  But what also he has is that frozen coconut cream that is insane for your compost pile or your IMO pile.
[02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.320]  So highly suggest you hit him up.
[02:21:01.320 --> 02:21:04.320]  And, you know, again, it's on this continent.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:08.320]  It's not coming from Asia or other parts of the world.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:14.320]  So less or more non-sustainable, but definitely a step in the right direction.
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.320]  Good point.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:19.320]  Non-sustainable, but definitely a step in the right direction.
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:21.320]  Good deal.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:26.320]  And I saw someone popped up about wildcrafting.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:34.320]  Yeah, Brian, we should probably do a series on that at some point in the future, but not today, obviously.
[02:21:40.810 --> 02:21:41.810]  Any more questions there, Peter?
[02:21:41.810 --> 02:21:46.810]  Someone said they tried vinegar once when they were a kid and basically pickled their plant.
[02:21:47.810 --> 02:21:50.810]  Well, we're using diluted vinegar, sir.
[02:21:51.810 --> 02:21:55.810]  Can Marco explain the avocado water in the SES, please?
[02:21:56.810 --> 02:21:57.810]  Oh, yeah. OK.
[02:21:59.810 --> 02:22:07.810]  So I made an SES and I just added the one extra step of I took avocado seeds and I have this nice little
[02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:11.810]  grinder which can grind pretty much a grab marbles.
[02:22:12.810 --> 02:22:17.810]  So I took a few avocado seeds, tossed them in there and made a powder.
[02:22:18.810 --> 02:22:23.810]  And then I added that to my SES water to start my seeds.
[02:22:24.810 --> 02:22:34.810]  I felt like the avocado, my mentality behind is avocado seed is just like every other seed loaded with energy and growth hormones.
[02:22:34.810 --> 02:22:38.810]  So I just wanted to take that and get that into my SES.
[02:22:39.810 --> 02:22:51.810]  And of course, SES is a soak that you want to pre-inoculate kind of biology and inputs with seeds or bare root plants or anything that you're planting.
[02:22:52.810 --> 02:22:53.810]  So that's why I use the avocado.
[02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:59.810]  Just my little twist, me being a master of my garden, figuring out things that might work for me.
[02:22:59.810 --> 02:23:02.810]  And what are you using to emulsify an avocado pit?
[02:23:03.810 --> 02:23:06.810]  So I have a I got a little grinder.
[02:23:08.810 --> 02:23:10.810]  I can show you, but it's a little mini grinder.
[02:23:10.810 --> 02:23:13.810]  You can use it to like grind coffee or it's really a grain grinder.
[02:23:14.810 --> 02:23:17.810]  So you could toss in like wheat and then you make your grain flour.
[02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:21.810]  They're about 80 bucks like Amazon.
[02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:27.810]  Yeah, those are that's pretty tough to break down.
[02:23:27.810 --> 02:23:28.810]  Hold on, let me show you.
[02:23:28.810 --> 02:23:29.810]  Let me grab it right quick.
[02:23:31.810 --> 02:23:35.810]  I know there was a high end blender that could do it, but that thing costs like 400 bucks.
[02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:37.810]  So Leighton, a question for you.
[02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:43.810]  What can I start to add to my cocoa to complement my dual fuel feeding program?
[02:23:44.810 --> 02:23:46.810]  Is worm casting a good mix with cocoa?
[02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:56.810]  Yeah, you know, I would what I would do is liquefy the worm castings because then they will just soak right into the seed.
[02:23:57.810 --> 02:23:58.810]  The cocoa.
[02:23:59.810 --> 02:24:00.810]  That's the beauty of cocoa is two things.
[02:24:01.810 --> 02:24:09.810]  It has a high level of potassium and it's not going to screw up your calcium to magnesium to potassium ratio because it's not available.
[02:24:10.810 --> 02:24:12.810]  It needs to have the bacteria to break it down.
[02:24:13.810 --> 02:24:15.810]  But also its ability to store moisture is fantastic.
[02:24:16.810 --> 02:24:19.810]  It builds aggregates very quickly, especially if blended properly.
[02:24:20.810 --> 02:24:26.810]  Frank has some some really coarse stuff like like nuts like this big all the way down to fines.
[02:24:27.810 --> 02:24:28.810]  I'm not a big fan of the fines.
[02:24:29.810 --> 02:24:33.810]  I like, you know, mix some of the coarse with some of the medium with some of the chunky.
[02:24:34.810 --> 02:24:38.810]  And then you get a really nice blend that blend in with your soilless medium or your overrides.
[02:24:40.810 --> 02:24:41.810]  Nice.
[02:24:43.810 --> 02:24:45.810]  Yeah, here we just got grinder, y'all.
[02:24:46.810 --> 02:24:47.810]  Yeah, that looks badass.
[02:24:48.810 --> 02:24:50.810]  Yeah, they're not that expensive.
[02:24:51.810 --> 02:24:54.810]  And man, this thing is like it'll crush anything.
[02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:55.810]  Yeah, check it out.
[02:24:56.810 --> 02:24:59.810]  It's called a grain mill grinder and it's pretty handy little tool.
[02:25:00.810 --> 02:25:01.810]  Yeah, it is.
[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:05.810]  So.
[02:25:07.810 --> 02:25:18.810]  This gets back to, you know, once you're done with a run, if I take my use soil from a run to put it in the worm bin and use it as one third, two runs, is that still let me hold on.
[02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:27.810]  What I'm saying is that I don't like to reuse soil because of pest concerns, but by composting and worms, I can use old soil to still keep beneficials.
[02:25:28.810 --> 02:25:38.810]  So I guess the question is about, you know, getting rid of any pathogen buildup or pests or whatever after a run and concerns or.
[02:25:40.810 --> 02:25:43.810]  Well, does he had did he have problems?
[02:25:44.810 --> 02:25:47.810]  I mean, if he didn't have problems, he could have had a run.
[02:25:48.810 --> 02:25:52.810]  If he had problems, then he's there's no reason not to reuse the soil.
[02:25:53.810 --> 02:25:56.810]  But if he's so out of balance that he's having problems, then, yes, compost it.
[02:25:57.810 --> 02:25:58.810]  Do not throw it away. It still has value.
[02:25:59.810 --> 02:26:01.810]  So just heat it up. So you kill stuff.
[02:26:02.810 --> 02:26:05.810]  So you need to make it thermophilic. You need to make sure it goes hot, like real hot.
[02:26:06.810 --> 02:26:07.810]  So you've killed everything.
[02:26:08.810 --> 02:26:09.810]  So not not just throw it in a worm bin.
[02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:14.810]  No, I mean, the worms are going to kill some things, but not all the pathogens.
[02:26:15.810 --> 02:26:23.810]  The only way to kill some of the really nasty pathogens is to get that soil up to 160 degrees at least three or four times and then turn it.
[02:26:24.810 --> 02:26:26.810]  Don't let it turn get to 180. It'll turn to alcohol.
[02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:28.810]  Then you will have to throw it away.
[02:26:29.810 --> 02:26:32.810]  So if you if again, if you're dealing with pathogens, you've got to get rid of them.
[02:26:32.810 --> 02:26:41.810]  If you have no pathogens or you don't have any serious problems, a good, solid biological compost tea will get that stuff right back into the system again.
[02:26:42.810 --> 02:26:43.810]  That's right.
[02:26:44.810 --> 02:26:45.810]  Do you agree with this comment?
[02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:50.810]  I would be more concerned about pathogens planting into fresh soil.
[02:26:51.810 --> 02:26:52.810]  Honestly, I agree with that.
[02:26:53.810 --> 02:26:59.810]  I mean, fresh soil to me is like it's just out there, butt naked.
[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:00.810]  No protection.
[02:27:01.810 --> 02:27:02.810]  Vulnerable.
[02:27:03.810 --> 02:27:04.810]  Vulnerable.
[02:27:05.810 --> 02:27:13.810]  So if you yeah, I would be more concerned with just like a bag of fresh soil than I would something that I created or kind of worked on myself.
[02:27:14.810 --> 02:27:19.810]  So in other words, if you're using fresh soil, you got to use a good inoculant to get off to the races.
[02:27:20.810 --> 02:27:22.810]  So you're not that pathogenic outbreak.
[02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:25.810]  It'll be there, but they'll keep it.
[02:27:26.810 --> 02:27:27.810]  Keep each other in check.
[02:27:27.810 --> 02:27:28.810]  Right.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:33.080]  Man, Mark, I got mad respect for you, brother.
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.080]  Hey, man.
[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.080]  Likewise, I've been taking plenty of notes here myself.
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:48.080]  So I think that's it for the general questions.
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.080]  There was a comment about an organic grower starter boot camp.
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:58.080]  That's that's in the process.
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:07.080]  Soon to be announced that we'll have a place that you can start and work your way up because there's a lot of...
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:09.080]  Thank you, Brian.
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:11.080]  I like Brian.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.080]  All right.
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.080]  Well, is that a good good end point?
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:19.080]  Twelve thirty on the West Coast?
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:22.080]  Two and a half hours as usual.
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:26.080]  And we really appreciate it, Marcos.
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:27.080]  We know you're a busy man.
[02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.080]  We can tell, man.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.080]  So thank you.
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.080]  Thank you for all that you do, man.
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:37.080]  And I know there's a lot of people out there that are definitely benefiting from you putting in the time and showing what you do.
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:39.080]  Well, that's wonderful. I'm glad, man.
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:43.080]  So hot composting kills the good stuff, too, right?
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:45.080]  No, not necessarily.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.080]  If it's done appropriately, the good guys will cyst.
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:54.080]  And so they'll still be present, but it takes them a long time to recover.
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.080]  So that compost has to be cured or finished after you've cooked it.
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:05.080]  And then the good guys will start to come back into it, especially if you're storing it on healthy soil.
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:11.080]  If you're storing it on concrete, it might take you a year before those come back, especially if you don't plant it.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:18.080]  So, again, if you, you know, if you if you're beating this compost up, put it on good soil, cover crop it.
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:21.080]  And in six months, you'll have rocket fuel.
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:30.080]  Yeah. And one other thing you can do is if you did beat it up pretty bad on the compost, you can also inoculate it after it's cooled down with IMO.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:32.080]  Just start populating that back up again.
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:35.080]  Agreed. If you if you have inoculants.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.080]  Yeah, that's that is the way to go. You can get it.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:39.080]  You can get it back in that third of the time.
[02:29:40.080 --> 02:29:45.080]  Yeah. And hey, Peter, put up put up Marco's IG handle for the crew out there.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.080]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.080]  Thanks, guys.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:30:02.080]  And just for everyone who's not in Southern California, this is this is what's currently growing in the in the L.A. raised beds.
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:08.080]  Some some cauliflower and daikon and nice.
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:10.080]  So they're healthy.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:13.080]  And you just built those. Right, Peter?
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:14.080]  This summer. Yeah.
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:16.080]  Yeah, they're looking great, buddy.
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:22.080]  But basically, I left one daikon to to start producing seeds.
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:25.080]  So I'm waiting for those pods to fatten up.
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.080]  It's my last one.
[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:31.080]  Nice. Yeah, I love daikons.
[02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:33.080]  I got groundhog daikons.
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.080]  They get in there and bust it up.
[02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:37.080]  All that soil up real good.
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:39.080]  Oh, they're they're wonderful.
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:43.080]  Use them in a lot of projects to get the soil jump started.
[02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:45.080]  And then you just let them rot in the soil.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:47.080]  They become. Yeah, they stink for a little bit.
[02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:49.080]  But, you know, it is what it is.
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:51.080]  Embrace the funk.
[02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:55.080]  Yeah, you got to when you're a natural farmer.
[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.080]  You got to.
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:03.080]  You love fish using fish products, fish emulsion.
[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:05.080]  I like FAA.
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:09.080]  Yeah, I'm looking at the chat.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:13.080]  It's snowing in a lot of places around the country.
[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:17.080]  It's 50 and sunny here.
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:19.080]  It's been snowing.
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.080]  Wacky Colorado weather.
[02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.080]  All right.
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:27.080]  Well, thank you, everyone.
[02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:30.080]  And do we know who's on next week or now?
[02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.080]  Oh, yeah, it's NERDS Genetics.
[02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:33.080]  We'll be talking to him.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.080]  He definitely has the year here in Colorado.
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:44.080]  And then Saturday, there's a three hour marathon with Kevin Jodry,
[02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:50.080]  Josh Rutherford, Nat Pennington talking, selecting genetics for the
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:55.080]  California commercial and unregulated market.
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:58.080]  And then Sunday, James Loud.
[02:31:59.080 --> 02:32:02.080]  I'm totally blanking on who we have.
[02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:04.080]  Give me one second.
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:08.080]  Let me see if he sent something about Sunday.
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:11.080]  No, he did not send something about Sunday.
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:14.080]  I think he was talking with a aficionado, Leo Stone.
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:16.080]  Oh, right, right, right.
[02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:18.080]  Thank you.
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:20.080]  I rely on other people for my.
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:22.080]  Yes, Leo is on Sunday.
[02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:24.080]  Thank you for that.
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:26.080]  You're a busy guy, Peter.
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:28.080]  Thanks for all the time you put into this, man.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:30.080]  For real.
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:32.080]  Now I'm going to go see what's going on outside.
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:34.080]  Marco, thank you again, my friend.
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:36.080]  Yes, brother.
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:38.080]  Much respect.
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:40.080]  All right.
