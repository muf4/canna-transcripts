[00:02.940 --> 00:10.340]  Hello everybody, welcome to the East Bay Seed Collective show. Saturday at 9 a.m.
[00:10.340 --> 00:16.980]  we have Samantha and a bunch of the breeders from the grow-off on to talk
[00:16.980 --> 00:22.340]  about the grow-off and talk about the genetics that talk about genetics.
[00:22.340 --> 00:28.540]  Samantha, would you like to start it off? Sure, Jamal, thank you for having me
[00:28.540 --> 00:35.860]  back. This is one of my favorite podcasts now to do so and I'm so grateful for all
[00:35.860 --> 00:39.700]  the genetics partners that were able to join us this morning. This is our biggest
[00:39.700 --> 00:44.100]  year yet. We did this last year where we brought all the breeders at a roundtable
[00:44.100 --> 00:48.740]  on future cannabis projects and had a really good discussion and I know your
[00:48.740 --> 00:53.300]  audience is particularly interested in, you know, breeding, genetics, the technical
[00:53.300 --> 00:57.580]  side of growing and these are some awesome experts that have so much
[00:57.580 --> 01:02.740]  knowledge so I'm really excited to see what kind of chat questions come in
[01:02.740 --> 01:08.780]  because these folks know a ton. Yeah, so let's have people start off with just
[01:08.780 --> 01:17.580]  like a quick little intro. I guess maybe how long you've been breeding and
[01:17.580 --> 01:24.500]  anything that you're particularly stoked about, you know, any varieties
[01:24.500 --> 01:29.940]  coming up or with the mystery varieties, anything that you're really
[01:29.940 --> 01:36.460]  curious about seeing what happens. And just a reminder, please don't slip up on
[01:36.460 --> 01:42.180]  what the mystery varieties are. We'll try to keep that very closed but, you know, in
[01:42.180 --> 01:45.660]  general you can talk about whatever kind of breeding you are
[01:45.660 --> 01:48.700]  interested in. Let's start with David because I know you're in a car and a
[01:48.700 --> 01:53.940]  little more of a precarious situation. Right, luckily we're getting closer to
[01:53.940 --> 02:01.980]  civilization so I shouldn't have any kind of service interruption. But no, I'm
[02:01.980 --> 02:09.100]  Dave from Spencfoot Farms, Spencfoot Seeds. We're up in Maine, southern Maine.
[02:09.100 --> 02:15.020]  I've been growing since 2000 maybe, you know, when I was young.
[02:15.020 --> 02:20.300]  Seed breeding has always started with the necessity of how do I create more
[02:20.300 --> 02:34.520]  for what I have, you know, especially long-leaf leaves or good availability. So it's always been a part of the
[02:34.520 --> 02:44.590]  ethos. It would be how to move, we've moved from the states to the states. And, you know, another
[02:44.590 --> 02:49.430]  project portion of where the seed breeding sort of comes from is having
[02:49.430 --> 02:53.150]  the necessity of taking with you what you may not be able to just bring into
[02:53.990 --> 02:58.910]  Now it's about a lot more. Now it's moving into trying to capture those
[02:58.910 --> 03:02.910]  things we love from the past, like a lot of our favorite gas strains here on the East Coast.
[03:02.910 --> 03:09.030]  And then also working towards a lot more productive hash washing strains because
[03:09.030 --> 03:13.070]  that's where a lot of the market's going. A lot of the customers sort of want
[03:13.070 --> 03:17.590]  something in that product range so the better we can stoop to the flavors as
[03:18.110 --> 03:25.130]  breeders and as growers, the better. So working in that space.
[03:25.130 --> 03:29.130]  Excellent. Excellent. Let's go with Ian.
[03:29.130 --> 03:37.860]  I think Ian's muted.
[03:37.860 --> 03:47.880]  Oh and David, can you mute yours please? I think we're getting a little feedback. Thank you.
[03:47.880 --> 03:53.160]  Hear me now? Yes.
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.840]  Great. So I'm Ian from Fat Cat Select Seeds. We're based here in Massachusetts
[03:58.840 --> 04:08.040]  on the island of Marcus Vineyard. I've been growing myself roughly 94, 95,
[04:08.040 --> 04:16.320]  roughly 10 years. And before we started breeding and making our own strains,
[04:16.320 --> 04:23.040]  our seeds was more like hoarding seeds and collecting seeds from where we had
[04:23.040 --> 04:29.920]  been traveling, from family, friends, overseas, you name it. We tried our best.
[04:29.920 --> 04:36.040]  On the island of Marcus Vineyard we had notorious dry spells and if we wanted to
[04:36.040 --> 04:39.800]  have some high-quality cannabis we had to grow it ourselves and we always
[04:39.800 --> 04:49.800]  wanted to have new, exciting growth. I think we were successful in that way.
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.880]  Excellent. Do you want to go, let's go to Ian and Ben, Aaron and Ben, excuse me.
[04:55.880 --> 05:03.560]  Thank you. Let's see, we are a husband and wife breeding team from the state of
[05:03.560 --> 05:09.000]  Michigan. We also have a vested interest in a family operation in Oklahoma, so
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.280]  we've been spending time between both states. We particularly started out
[05:16.320 --> 05:21.200]  phenohunting and being very interested in working directly with the breeders to
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.080]  phenohunt out certain strains. And with that and getting to know them, learned a
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.920]  lot of the aspects of breeding and were able to, you know, get into kind of
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.800]  dabbling in our own breeding. And we met Sam and she brought us into this. We're
[05:36.800 --> 05:42.440]  really excited to be working with everybody. And we've been basically into
[05:42.440 --> 05:50.240]  the cultivation and breeding newer terpene concepts, prolonging the essence
[05:50.240 --> 05:56.040]  of the cannabis strain itself. One of my favorite things to discuss as to what we
[05:56.040 --> 06:00.560]  really base our breeding around currently is terpene stacking. So there
[06:00.560 --> 06:04.840]  are certain designations of degree changes in the terpenes in which they
[06:04.840 --> 06:09.240]  burn off at, meaning that everything burns off at a different temperature. So
[06:09.240 --> 06:14.080]  what we've been actually doing the most research in is how to actually prolong
[06:14.080 --> 06:17.360]  that on the palate. What we're discovering is there's certain
[06:17.360 --> 06:22.480]  temperature variances in which you get distinguished terpenes versus the fruit
[06:22.480 --> 06:27.160]  salad type experience. So one of the favorite things that we've been doing
[06:27.160 --> 06:31.960]  with these cultivars is extending the flavor from maybe a two-second or
[06:31.960 --> 06:37.740]  three-second experience into that 15, 20, 30-second experience in which really is
[06:37.740 --> 06:41.660]  a key marker in any of the national strains that really are been and will be
[06:41.660 --> 06:47.460]  successful. That's awesome and not something that we here talked about a
[06:47.460 --> 06:52.700]  lot. No, we've really been focusing our program more on the way that the terpenes
[06:52.700 --> 06:58.380]  interact with the cannabinoids instead of being very high THC focused. We've
[06:58.380 --> 07:03.900]  been lucky in the market and the cultivars that we're working with that
[07:03.900 --> 07:11.700]  we haven't always had to be so focused on the high T's, you know, more flavor. Can
[07:11.700 --> 07:17.660]  I ask a follow-up question really quickly? So my question is, do you
[07:17.660 --> 07:24.780]  find that there is a link between terpene expression and plant morphology?
[07:24.780 --> 07:31.060]  So like the plant that has this terpene in general is the
[07:31.060 --> 07:35.420]  shorter one and the plant that has this terpene is general, taller, or those types
[07:35.420 --> 07:39.460]  of things? Yeah, so that's a funny question because that leads into a
[07:39.460 --> 07:43.660]  couple different experiences that we've been looking into which we've been
[07:43.660 --> 07:49.580]  finding really exciting things behind it. Which is my first statement to lead into
[07:49.580 --> 07:54.340]  it which would be the seed is the first phenotypic expression of the plant. So
[07:54.340 --> 07:57.780]  when you're talking about your seed designation, what separates it from your
[07:57.780 --> 08:01.980]  other seeds? Is it the markings? Is it the size? Well actually it's all of these
[08:01.980 --> 08:05.860]  categories that are dictating to the parent lineages in which you'll find the
[08:05.860 --> 08:10.980]  more dominant traits. So what we've been really excited about is actually looking
[08:10.980 --> 08:15.860]  at past the actual final product and looking at prior to it and what
[08:15.860 --> 08:19.740]  designates things in the earlier stages so you can maybe separate your seed
[08:19.740 --> 08:24.500]  stock eliminating up to 66% of what you'd have to go through in order to
[08:24.500 --> 08:28.620]  find what you're looking for. So that's another end of our studies that we've
[08:28.620 --> 08:33.420]  been doing kind of leading into these terpene programs which actually is where
[08:33.420 --> 08:38.140]  we've been reliant on cutting down our availability of what we're searching
[08:38.140 --> 08:43.580]  through to actually get what we want. And like I said before it's around 33% of
[08:43.580 --> 08:48.780]  our actual stock we find our focus in now versus having a hundred percent
[08:48.780 --> 08:53.060]  variability playing into the role of what we're doing when we go pheno
[08:53.060 --> 08:58.340]  hunting. Interesting, interesting. Well let's let's jump back into that in a
[08:58.340 --> 09:04.500]  little bit but let's also now go into Jeremy please. Yeah sure my name is
[09:04.500 --> 09:13.180]  Jeremy Kledtke. I'm a founder of Davis Farms. I've been growing since the early
[09:13.180 --> 09:18.300]  90s. My first commercial crop and I'm happy to put it that way because this
[09:18.300 --> 09:24.700]  has been a stand-up industry for a long time. My first commercial
[09:24.700 --> 09:30.980]  harvest was in March of 1993 and I've been growing ever since. Growing and
[09:30.980 --> 09:38.100]  breeding for probably 22, 23 of those 30 plus years because I think as the rest
[09:38.100 --> 09:43.260]  of these guys kind of alluded to that if you were growing and you needed better
[09:43.340 --> 09:49.260]  access or the ability to preserve the genetics you had or if you were just a
[09:49.260 --> 09:54.980]  seed nerd or all three you ended up leading towards breeding. So I guess
[09:54.980 --> 09:59.900]  that's my intro for you. Happy to be here though. Stoked to thank you Jamal and
[09:59.900 --> 10:06.380]  thank you Sam. This is such a cool opportunity to get to be working at
[10:06.380 --> 10:10.220]  least in the same circle as the rest of you breeders because I really appreciate
[10:10.220 --> 10:16.620]  the work that you do. Even my girl wears the fat cat shirt frequently so we got
[10:16.620 --> 10:21.380]  some some love in the house for for all of you guys so thanks. And I want to say
[10:21.380 --> 10:27.580]  like I'm especially excited to have breeders one that I'm not familiar with
[10:27.580 --> 10:33.820]  and two that are not from the West Coast because as somebody born and raised in
[10:33.820 --> 10:40.580]  California we are very West Coast centric and it's really nice you know
[10:40.580 --> 10:44.980]  to see what's really going on in all these other places that I haven't been
[10:44.980 --> 10:48.980]  because it's it's you know it's just great to see what everybody else is
[10:48.980 --> 10:53.260]  doing. I'm glad you said that early Jamal because the two California breeders
[10:53.260 --> 11:00.580]  will be logging in soon. And I didn't add that but I'm Oregon based I've grown up
[11:00.580 --> 11:06.980]  in Oregon born and raised in the West Coast. Excellent so I guess my first
[11:06.980 --> 11:10.020]  question unless Sam unless you have a particular question you want to start
[11:10.020 --> 11:14.980]  with. No this is your show let's do it. So my first question is like with this
[11:14.980 --> 11:19.420]  competition which is a I mean in my opinion it's kind of like an attempt for
[11:19.420 --> 11:25.860]  us to use science to like see what's going on with our with our genetics is
[11:25.860 --> 11:30.620]  there anything particular that you are are looking for is there anything that
[11:30.620 --> 11:39.220]  you're like curious about do you guys have any is that a hypothesis right? I
[11:39.220 --> 11:44.500]  mean I loved I loved the direction Ben was going in because we we judge on
[11:44.500 --> 11:49.180]  total terpenes and total cannabinoids and I mean Jeremy can speak to this as
[11:49.180 --> 11:54.100]  well as the head of our hemp competition that you know we aren't just looking for
[11:54.100 --> 11:57.860]  a high tea strain we're looking for something super diverse something
[11:57.860 --> 12:04.380]  terpene rich you know something that's not common to shelves and also you know
[12:04.380 --> 12:08.180]  highlighting new brands or brands like you said that you haven't heard about
[12:08.180 --> 12:13.580]  and you know the all the work that all these folks are doing is so important so
[12:13.580 --> 12:17.580]  yeah I think terpenes are definitely obviously important to us and would love
[12:17.580 --> 12:20.860]  for some of these folks to talk about how they breed for those because that's
[12:20.860 --> 12:34.070]  I love that conversation Ben started. So I guess if we're talking about that
[12:34.070 --> 12:39.990]  particular area you know the seeds are really one of my favorite points to look
[12:39.990 --> 12:46.190]  you know it's one of those areas that as breeders we have these guys that we've
[12:46.190 --> 12:50.870]  known I mean a lot of us have been in for more than two to three decades so
[12:51.030 --> 12:55.230]  when it comes down to it we all know a crazy old farmer who handed us a bag of
[12:55.230 --> 12:58.750]  seeds and was like I'll tell you everything about everything in that bag
[12:58.750 --> 13:04.550]  and you're like sure dude you know and it's like this almost wonky experience
[13:04.550 --> 13:09.510]  that a lot of us have had it's interesting in my later years of looking
[13:09.510 --> 13:14.550]  at these processes and kind of noticing patterns a lot of these guys may have
[13:14.550 --> 13:18.630]  been onto something you know it might not be that far from the truth that
[13:18.710 --> 13:22.310]  those guys could actually told me a lot more about those seeds than what I would
[13:22.310 --> 13:28.150]  have given them credit for and as we get into the age of digitalization we have
[13:28.150 --> 13:33.070]  the ability to start taking photos and processing these seeds on a more micro
[13:33.070 --> 13:37.990]  macro level where we can actually dictate latitudes longitudes of certain
[13:37.990 --> 13:43.070]  markings and the actual tone of the seed size of the seed start to categorize
[13:43.190 --> 13:47.190]  these things start looking at the you know patterns that we see within that
[13:48.830 --> 13:52.630]  that to me is the most exciting thing of the future of cannabis because when we
[13:52.630 --> 13:56.830]  get into that phase of mind we get in the ability of being able to
[13:56.830 --> 14:00.870]  synthetically launch a batch of seeds through a computer and potentially have
[14:00.950 --> 14:05.430]  adequate results as to what each seed will do for us you know these are the
[14:05.430 --> 14:11.990]  potentialities these are the hypothesis or hypotheses excuse me if you will of
[14:11.990 --> 14:15.950]  the current culture in cannabis as we see legalization allow for studies to be
[14:15.950 --> 14:20.390]  on a more vast scale and a lot of our culture starts to come out of the dark
[14:20.390 --> 14:26.910]  and out of the you know basement so to speak and share what we know on a more
[14:26.910 --> 14:31.750]  vast level with a little bit less contingency plans behind how we're
[14:31.750 --> 14:33.830]  sharing it's fascinating.
[14:37.600 --> 14:46.560]  I like that visual idea I'm imagining a more traditional you know seed batch
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.200]  approach growing style say in more of a field or a larger you know genetic pool
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.880]  you're going to start pulling from females that you like and you're going
[14:55.880 --> 15:00.480]  to start noticing the visual appearance and remembering the traits that that you
[15:00.480 --> 15:06.200]  know female maybe carry like shucking through some plants today this morning I
[15:06.200 --> 15:09.920]  remember feeling and seeing certain expressions come out whether it was dark
[15:09.920 --> 15:15.680]  and no striations or heavily target tiger striped different things from
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.120]  different females you know so was the farmer sort of telling you you know a
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.560]  little bit more about which direction to go in if you went into that big you know
[15:25.560 --> 15:27.640]  Pandora's box.
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.480]  Yeah we started looking at different traits when we were running and chasing some grape
[15:35.520 --> 15:40.280]  lines and really looking we were noticing three distinct different
[15:40.280 --> 15:46.720]  expressions in the phenos we were getting and we started noticing because
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.280]  we had done so many runs of them that there was a correlation to the way that
[15:50.280 --> 15:55.760]  the seed style was as to which type of pheno expression we were going to get so
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.920]  if it was a smaller seed that didn't have a lot of markings it kind of
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.840]  favored the more soda profile that we were getting so it tasted more like a
[16:03.880 --> 16:09.920]  grape soda versus the larger seeds that had a lot of striping to it favored more
[16:09.920 --> 16:15.480]  gas so as we were trying to find this soda that we were desperately trying to
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.240]  get that great candy flavor you know we started going through some of the
[16:20.240 --> 16:27.080]  smaller seeds and saw you know a lot of correlation between what we were finding
[16:27.080 --> 16:31.320]  and it really helped us to narrow down and find that final expression we were
[16:31.320 --> 16:39.590]  looking for faster. Excellent. It shows me how much data you really need to be capturing.
[16:39.590 --> 16:47.590]  Right. And you know also Sam Jamal you guys brought a meeting of the minds today.
[16:47.590 --> 16:57.630]  I saw Ian pop in for a second. Here's Robbie and Marty. Yeah I would say you know once
[16:57.750 --> 17:03.390]  you when you counted millions of seeds you definitely get to know them and you
[17:03.390 --> 17:07.590]  you can see the different striping on them and the different I mean just the
[17:07.590 --> 17:11.070]  different characteristics of that particular seed when you're looking at a
[17:11.070 --> 17:16.830]  million of them so I completely agree. I would love to have is that Marty
[17:16.830 --> 17:21.590]  introduce himself if you would like and also who at Nerd Genetics I'm sorry I
[17:21.590 --> 17:29.710]  don't recall your name. Robbie. Robbie. Marty would you like to
[17:29.710 --> 17:34.830]  introduce yourself? I saw you just came on a little late. Yeah sure yeah I just
[17:34.830 --> 17:40.510]  didn't see the invite link at nine so it took me a little bit sorry about that.
[17:40.510 --> 17:46.310]  I'm Marty. Yeah that's right. I'm Marty Yip with my company is Sensational
[17:46.310 --> 17:51.350]  Solutions. We're actually a micronized organic fertilizer company and we're a
[17:51.430 --> 17:57.270]  representing I'm actually representing the Humboldt Legacy, Humboldt Grace
[17:57.270 --> 18:03.910]  Canopy Rights group that we do for securing your genetics through like DNA
[18:03.910 --> 18:08.710]  and all that stuff. But my company the background of my company and reason why
[18:08.710 --> 18:15.390]  I'm here is we're gonna just probably eventually talk about the skunk lineage
[18:15.390 --> 18:21.990]  and all that stuff and the project we're doing with it. And anyways so I'm
[18:21.990 --> 18:27.470]  a micronized organic fertilizer company. We've been around for about 12 years.
[18:27.470 --> 18:33.230]  Been growing weed. I'm 47 so I've been growing weed in the cornfield since I
[18:33.230 --> 18:38.070]  was 16. I'm from Davis, California but I'm living here I reside in Humboldt County
[18:38.070 --> 18:43.110]  for the last 20 years. So I've been actually growing cannabis for about 30
[18:43.190 --> 18:50.310]  years now and was been breeding since the late 90s. And it's interesting you're
[18:50.310 --> 18:55.030]  talking about those skunk stripes because breeding for 20 years. I'll talk
[18:55.030 --> 19:00.510]  about it later but anyways yeah so. But anyways I've been breeding for 20 years
[19:00.510 --> 19:05.110]  been overseas to collect different varieties of seed. Been to different like
[19:05.110 --> 19:09.310]  Jamaica and all those other places and grabbed land-raised seeds before any kind
[19:09.310 --> 19:14.310]  of Dutch influence or American influence from all the farms and all that stuff. A lot of
[19:14.310 --> 19:18.190]  it was the trusting factor because I had like ankle-long dreadlocks throughout
[19:18.190 --> 19:22.630]  most of my life. And so don't let the short hair fool you but you know I had
[19:22.630 --> 19:27.190]  to cut them off just for because I own a fertilizer company. And so part of what
[19:27.190 --> 19:31.190]  our fertilizer company was doing and this is great for breeding too is
[19:31.190 --> 19:36.430]  Samantha here has partnered up with Orange Photonics and I have been doing a
[19:36.430 --> 19:43.790]  lot of analytics the last starting with liquid chromatography and pretty much
[19:43.790 --> 19:50.870]  bought a light lab mini HPLC right at the beginning when Dylan and Stephanie
[19:50.870 --> 19:56.150]  were at the shows probably about a good six years ago. I was using liquid
[19:56.150 --> 20:00.670]  chromatography where I was just doing the drops for a while and then they had
[20:00.670 --> 20:05.110]  an actual HPLC and I bought it for the hemp industry to test out nutrient doses
[20:05.110 --> 20:12.870]  for specific cannabinoids increasing at specific times for giving a diet
[20:12.870 --> 20:19.830]  you know giving a specific diet and seeing what's making it go hot and
[20:19.830 --> 20:23.750]  what's not making the hemp go hot. So then I started implementing that with my
[20:23.750 --> 20:28.230]  traditional breeding of you know dude I have this whole lot of plants I heard
[20:28.230 --> 20:32.590]  someone talk about you get that special female you get that special whatnot. A
[20:32.590 --> 20:36.910]  lot of my senses come from the epilepsy that's why I've been medical since 1996
[20:36.910 --> 20:42.590]  here in California. I have epilepsy so I bleed from my epilepsy. I'm not a legal
[20:42.590 --> 20:46.350]  farm because I focus on my fertilizers and my research and development for
[20:46.350 --> 20:52.510]  medical strains here in California. But anyway so I find those special ones and
[20:52.510 --> 20:56.870]  I start to test them live to see what the cannabinoids they carry and I've
[20:56.870 --> 21:01.110]  been finding I found these land race ones I have a African one I found with
[21:01.110 --> 21:08.990]  1.5 times more THC VA than THC in my mail. So I've been breeding with that and
[21:08.990 --> 21:12.630]  it's very interesting if you don't have the right tools you're just kind of like
[21:12.630 --> 21:18.070]  blindly looking for specific like aspects because all the human can only
[21:18.070 --> 21:25.770]  can only sense certain things out of the strain. But you need that actual data to
[21:25.770 --> 21:32.850]  be able to further something and excuse me but the way Humboldt County and a lot
[21:32.850 --> 21:37.690]  of the industry is right now you can't waste time you know. And so I've been
[21:37.690 --> 21:42.850]  implementing and talking about these things with DNA markers and with
[21:42.850 --> 21:46.210]  medicinal genomics and that's part of that whole skunk thing that we're gonna
[21:46.210 --> 21:51.170]  probably talk about here later. But yeah I've been doing a lot of analytical work
[21:51.490 --> 21:58.810]  fertilizers and seeds and I am 50-50 with the skunk stripes now that we're
[21:58.810 --> 22:04.130]  talking about that I'm 50-50 with that because I've seen white almost like gray
[22:04.130 --> 22:09.570]  seeds be way more flavorful and way pack a way better punch and to be skunkier
[22:09.570 --> 22:13.690]  than some of the ones with tiger stripes. But then again I've had tiger striped
[22:13.690 --> 22:17.930]  ones have the tiger stripes come off because once they hit the water tiger
[22:17.930 --> 22:22.730]  stripes disappear. So I don't know I mean I've been through quite a few
[22:22.730 --> 22:28.210]  million seeds because I breed been breeding and have bred my own cannabis
[22:28.210 --> 22:32.410]  strain to become compliant. So I've been through a lot of seeds and work with
[22:32.410 --> 22:36.530]  like honeydew farms I work with a lot of huge farms that work with Humboldt seed
[22:36.530 --> 22:40.970]  organization Humboldt seed company. I work a lot of different seed companies
[22:40.970 --> 22:46.810]  and I don't know if there's a real it's just opinion right now but I think I
[22:46.810 --> 22:51.490]  don't know if there's a true correlation to that because you know
[22:51.490 --> 22:57.650]  I've seen gray seeds all the way you know have gray seeds and tiger stripe
[22:57.650 --> 23:05.010]  seeds have similarities that you just couldn't tell without actually growing
[23:05.010 --> 23:09.490]  them out and smoking them. So anyways that's a little bit about myself and
[23:09.490 --> 23:12.490]  that was just my quick little opinion on the tiger stripes. It could have a
[23:12.490 --> 23:17.250]  correlation but I just through planting for 30 years I don't know if there is a
[23:17.250 --> 23:25.850]  correlation. So all right sorry. Awesome. I want to pop in before we go to Robbie real quick that
[23:25.850 --> 23:30.410]  Marty did not like unnecessarily spill the beans we haven't announced this yet
[23:30.410 --> 23:36.730]  this is kind of like the debut of the skunk grow off that we're doing. So
[23:36.730 --> 23:40.570]  surprise one of the California competitions we will be running a
[23:40.570 --> 23:45.610]  special pheno of skunk number one that Marty has found and discovered and so
[23:45.610 --> 23:49.290]  that this is the first we're talking about it so he is allowed to say that
[23:49.290 --> 23:53.370]  everyone's gonna know that it's a skunk strain but nobody else can say what the
[23:53.370 --> 23:57.770]  strain is that we're working with this year. And with that I would love Robbie
[23:57.770 --> 24:02.930]  from our Oklahoma competition with Nerds Genetics to intro himself. Hey Robbie.
[24:02.930 --> 24:08.850]  Howdy all. So yeah coming coming live from Connecticut actually from this
[24:08.850 --> 24:16.690]  Anycan event which is something. It's been it's pretty cool so far. But I'm
[24:16.690 --> 24:23.810]  just off in the little exhibitors lounge doing this. So anyway yeah I'm from
[24:23.810 --> 24:28.250]  Nerds Genetics we're in Oklahoma now. We still have a facility out in Colorado
[24:28.250 --> 24:34.690]  but all of our genetic R&D got moved to Oklahoma. So we're doing the grow
[24:34.690 --> 24:43.210]  offs there. Our strain for the grow off this year is something that I find to be
[24:43.210 --> 24:48.370]  wildly different than a lot of the things that I see in dispensaries and
[24:48.370 --> 24:51.850]  shops people putting on Instagram anything like that. I wanted something
[24:51.850 --> 24:57.890]  that was gonna be able to be in somebody's stable once they they grew it
[24:57.890 --> 25:02.250]  out for their dispensary or for their home or whatever. But also something that
[25:02.250 --> 25:05.650]  didn't look or smell like everything else that they were used to getting. So
[25:05.650 --> 25:10.770]  we we went into the catalog and picked out something that I think is going to
[25:10.770 --> 25:16.810]  be going to be really interesting for the competition. And you know other than
[25:16.810 --> 25:23.850]  that I've been breeding since 2010. We've been we've been working on this for a
[25:23.850 --> 25:29.410]  really long time. Not as long as Marty certainly but we've done a whole lot of
[25:29.410 --> 25:35.090]  work into it made millions of seeds. And I want to also throw in my little two
[25:35.090 --> 25:41.090]  cents about the tiger striping. And what I have seen over the years is that
[25:41.090 --> 25:46.250]  different genetic lineages tend to produce different colors and looks of
[25:46.250 --> 25:52.410]  seeds. So specifically anytime I run out something that holds like a Pakistani
[25:52.410 --> 25:59.490]  lineage I end up getting much much darker seeds then you know say something
[25:59.490 --> 26:03.130]  that comes out of like a gelato or something like that that tend to produce
[26:03.130 --> 26:09.850]  a lot more like gray colored seeds. And I haven't seen any correlation at all of
[26:09.850 --> 26:15.850]  any kind from the way the seed looks to what it grows. Across the board anywhere
[26:15.850 --> 26:20.590]  never. You know like I put two seeds and they looked exactly the same and got two
[26:20.590 --> 26:26.310]  wildly different things out. So if you guys have been able to select within
[26:26.310 --> 26:33.830]  your your breeding stock and be able to to say well you know this one is more
[26:33.830 --> 26:37.630]  like mom or this one's more like dad then that's that's a really awesome
[26:37.630 --> 26:41.910]  thing to be able to do because you know most of the time I haven't been able to
[26:41.910 --> 26:45.870]  find any kind of correlation like that. So we just kind of pop them out and see
[26:46.230 --> 26:53.750]  what we get. So one of the neater things that I found along the way is you're exactly right.
[26:53.750 --> 26:59.710]  It is a variation based on the actual inputs right. So we're all working in a
[26:59.710 --> 27:06.950]  world of vectors and variables and when that comes into play if X and Y are
[27:06.950 --> 27:11.430]  different on a scale they're always going to have a different variant middle
[27:11.430 --> 27:16.510]  right. And so just like what you guys have been explaining I've been finding
[27:16.510 --> 27:20.870]  like when I mix in northern lights back genetics the bigger seed does mean that
[27:20.870 --> 27:27.430]  I'm going to see more northern lights in it. When I went into the lemon G from
[27:27.430 --> 27:33.150]  Ohio I ended up having a lot of smaller seeds constantly from that genetic and I
[27:33.150 --> 27:38.610]  found that that was actually expressing itself inside this seed popping within
[27:38.730 --> 27:43.010]  that phenotyping. So I do believe that you're you're on to something when you
[27:43.010 --> 27:47.730]  start to say that it's going to be different from X and Y and only going
[27:47.730 --> 27:51.650]  through those genetics can find those traits and similarities. But if you're
[27:51.650 --> 27:55.970]  trying to say it's always going to be X or it's always going to be Y because
[27:55.970 --> 27:59.930]  there's different parents involved we're always going to see that not be true. So
[27:59.930 --> 28:04.570]  I'm really I'm thrilled to hear what I'm hearing because it it does in a way
[28:04.570 --> 28:09.690]  affirm some details but also kind of helps clarify what we're exactly
[28:09.690 --> 28:14.650]  discussing. Well and for all the growers out there that are watching this I just
[28:14.650 --> 28:20.570]  want to say that like in my experience I have never seen anything that made a big
[28:20.570 --> 28:24.650]  seed better than a little seed or a tiger striped seed better than a non
[28:24.650 --> 28:29.490]  tiger striped seed or anything along those lines. There is no I've never been
[28:29.490 --> 28:34.770]  able to look at a pack of seeds and say oh this one's gonna be fire. It's you
[28:34.770 --> 28:38.850]  know you just never really know and a lot of times like I've popped seeds that
[28:38.850 --> 28:41.970]  were the craziest most tiger striped things that you've ever seen and none of
[28:41.970 --> 28:49.010]  them germinated. So you know it just that's not necessarily a indicator for
[28:49.010 --> 28:52.890]  health. So you know I just I just want to put that out there for for all of the
[28:53.210 --> 29:02.810]  growers out there. Interesting it's a it's a it's a kind of a somewhat
[29:02.810 --> 29:07.850]  controversial subject for sure and I mean even for for me for example my two
[29:07.850 --> 29:14.370]  cents would be seeds that are light are not as marketable. And so even if you
[29:14.370 --> 29:20.410]  have that's for sure true. You know if you have a line like Dutch treat is a plant
[29:20.410 --> 29:24.250]  that I've grown a lot and the seeds are very tiny and a lot of them are very
[29:24.250 --> 29:31.170]  very light. And if I bought those seeds I would probably not be I wouldn't believe
[29:31.170 --> 29:36.450]  that they were as good because in my mind they're tiny and they're not as as
[29:36.450 --> 29:42.530]  you know voraciously appearing. But that is just the line it just comes out with
[29:42.530 --> 29:47.250]  a lot of light seeds a lot of smaller seeds. I would actually I've asked Jeremy
[29:47.250 --> 29:52.050]  about that I know you look through a lot of seeds just going into that into
[29:52.050 --> 29:58.570]  that area do you find that any type of characteristics that you know that
[29:58.570 --> 30:03.970]  correlate between like a certain seed type and a certain plant morphology?
[30:03.970 --> 30:08.370]  Because I mean the one thing that I would state that I would affirm from my
[30:08.370 --> 30:12.490]  experience is that when you have a particular clone it doesn't matter what
[30:12.490 --> 30:18.410]  pollen goes into that plant that seed should be the same. So if you have let's
[30:18.410 --> 30:23.050]  say Dutch tree clone if I hit that with an Afghani if I hit that with the pure
[30:23.050 --> 30:29.090]  sativa no matter what that seed is gonna be it's gonna have it's gonna be this it
[30:29.090 --> 30:33.210]  have the same appearance in shape and size. If you mix those all together
[30:33.210 --> 30:37.650]  you're not gonna be able to like separate them. But if you have various
[30:37.650 --> 30:40.970]  phenotypes I think that's kind of you know like kind of where it's getting
[30:40.970 --> 30:45.890]  mixed up if you have various phenotypes of let's say the Dutch tree and I hit
[30:45.890 --> 30:53.450]  all of those with a different male those seeds are going to look they're not
[30:53.450 --> 30:56.970]  going to be as they're not going to be as uniform as if it was that clone where
[30:56.970 --> 31:00.690]  they're all gonna be the same and that is the size of that seed is dictated by
[31:00.690 --> 31:09.370]  the seed bract. Like the space where that's. That's totally true.
[31:09.370 --> 31:13.130]  I think everybody on here will say that I mean like anytime I hit lemon g to
[31:13.130 --> 31:18.050]  anything it always comes out as lemon g with seeds. You know like the seed is always the
[31:18.050 --> 31:21.370]  same coming out same with any of the Pakistani stuff like I always get super
[31:21.370 --> 31:26.530]  dark stuff. But something else that I think is worth noting is that the
[31:26.530 --> 31:31.410]  marketability fact of it is a hundred percent true and it goes back to the
[31:31.410 --> 31:37.810]  90s like there there's a story that I always relate to Neville you know from
[31:37.810 --> 31:43.210]  since he feeds back in back in the 90s his game plan was always to sell all the
[31:43.210 --> 31:48.330]  biggest seeds and then keep the smallest seeds for his breeding projects which
[31:48.330 --> 31:53.610]  you know is something that we started incorporating just for for large outdoor
[31:53.610 --> 31:58.810]  crops where we keep a lot of the small seeds for for large outdoor crops and
[31:58.810 --> 32:03.410]  put those into our into our own fields and we get the same vigor and everything
[32:04.410 --> 32:12.610]  else so interesting one of the things I also say about the marketability though
[32:12.610 --> 32:17.770]  is like for instance like when you get the tiger stripes on some of these seeds
[32:17.770 --> 32:22.490]  some people and depending on the husk you know super thick some people
[32:22.490 --> 32:25.970]  actually score and score their seeds when they're doing separation and when
[32:25.970 --> 32:29.370]  they're scoring before they sell them so then make sure they sprout a lot of
[32:29.370 --> 32:35.250]  those tiger stripes are gone so that's why I'm like it's kind of like a
[32:35.250 --> 32:41.650]  subjective like thing about the seeds and color because yes they do produce
[32:41.650 --> 32:46.370]  different ones but like for instance I the the strains that I work with I do a
[32:46.370 --> 32:51.730]  lot of land-raised breeding and you know try to preserve a lot of like older
[32:51.730 --> 32:56.970]  genetics like AFCU and then you know been working with the NL to not the ones
[32:56.970 --> 33:01.810]  from Todd but the old NL to clone and stuff like that I've been working with
[33:01.810 --> 33:10.050]  like a lot of older stuff and the dominant parents seem to yes have more
[33:10.050 --> 33:14.370]  of the seed that you're used to seeing from the dominant parent but if you're
[33:14.370 --> 33:19.170]  working with two strains that have you know trying to establish dominance in a
[33:19.170 --> 33:26.690]  parent then you do get a variation of maturity a variation of size but then
[33:26.730 --> 33:29.970]  once you've isolated those genetics because you guys are all talking about
[33:29.970 --> 33:37.370]  really worked genetics so if you're starting from a and a you're gonna have
[33:37.370 --> 33:42.970]  I don't know I come from my wife was the microbiology lab director at Humboldt's
[33:42.970 --> 33:49.130]  note now called Cal Poly Humboldt so I am friends with a lot of geneticists a
[33:49.130 --> 33:54.130]  lot of plant physiologists and so we discuss these things because it's humble
[33:54.130 --> 34:00.170]  humble all about cannabis even before legalization and so you're gonna have
[34:00.170 --> 34:03.730]  it's like Mendel you know you're gonna have a variation and how you're
[34:03.730 --> 34:06.890]  seeing from crinkle all the way to whatnot you're gonna crinkle we all
[34:06.890 --> 34:09.210]  those things so things have been isolated then you're gonna have
[34:09.210 --> 34:14.050]  established dominance so once you've established that dominance and you start
[34:14.050 --> 34:18.610]  seeing one parent one parent stock more dominant than the other parent stock
[34:18.610 --> 34:22.050]  then you're gonna start seeing probably more consistency like you guys are
[34:22.050 --> 34:28.130]  talking about you start all over like I did about 12 years ago I have like a
[34:28.130 --> 34:32.210]  like what home what's his name we were talking about it came in with me what's
[34:32.210 --> 34:36.050]  the second guy that came in with me we were just talking about correlation of
[34:36.050 --> 34:43.530]  seeds anyways that's when I started noticing that I was like yeah and so
[34:43.530 --> 34:47.970]  that's why I was like whoa okay there's there's I got these ones that you know
[34:47.970 --> 34:52.930]  got hit by the pond early I left my mail like a true open pollination is
[34:52.930 --> 34:57.250]  you're leaving your mail all the way through and not calling you leave it to
[34:57.250 --> 35:02.930]  its bed and so anything that flowers early all the way to late it's gonna get
[35:02.930 --> 35:07.050]  that pollen it's not like just saving that farm and hit it whenever okay so
[35:07.050 --> 35:09.970]  you're leaving this mail out and you're just hitting all these different
[35:09.970 --> 35:15.770]  varieties and so sometimes you get second swell and it's taking in more
[35:15.770 --> 35:20.850]  pollen so you get super mature ones and you get ones that are pretty mature and
[35:20.850 --> 35:25.450]  the super mature ones are dark and then you get the ones that are kind of mature
[35:25.450 --> 35:28.770]  within the tiger stripes right so the tiger stripes are gone on these dark
[35:28.770 --> 35:34.330]  ones the minute I start scoring them all they all look the same so that's why I'm
[35:34.330 --> 35:41.210]  just like okay we could do that but it's like you know judge it on that because
[35:41.210 --> 35:46.850]  it's like cannabis and looks but what's really behind the seed is really what
[35:46.850 --> 35:52.050]  matters the consistency of the diet how fed the different aminos and enzymes
[35:52.050 --> 35:57.010]  that were put into the seed the plant took in to allow the seed to absorb and
[35:57.010 --> 36:02.290]  store for the future that's more important than the way the seed looks in
[36:02.290 --> 36:06.570]  my opinion because I make my own fertilizer blends I test it and I do
[36:06.650 --> 36:11.530]  analytics and I breed with my own blends then I plant my seed from those blends
[36:11.530 --> 36:17.050]  and see the reaction of the various seeds so I never the last 12 years have
[36:17.050 --> 36:25.450]  never changed the way I grow indoor or outdoor is there any seeds companies out
[36:25.450 --> 36:30.850]  there that make their own nutrient blends that sell them registered breed
[36:30.850 --> 36:36.770]  and see what's going on through HPLC on a weekly basis because I did a lot of
[36:36.770 --> 36:42.850]  beta testing with orange photonics and their live their live module so I was
[36:42.850 --> 36:46.770]  doing a lot of weekly testing and seeing the differences between nutrients how
[36:46.770 --> 36:51.410]  some plants react differently in certain environments obviously we know that but
[36:51.410 --> 36:56.570]  then do you take that same plant with the same diet out to heat to a humid
[36:56.570 --> 37:00.450]  climate here in the coast where I live and then my other house inland which is
[37:00.450 --> 37:05.970]  a dry in the mountains with 12 hours of direct sunlight because my coastal ones
[37:05.970 --> 37:10.290]  in a greenhouse and then you test those results of each and every phenotype and
[37:10.290 --> 37:16.970]  seed and then you breed the seed from both indoor coast and inland and you
[37:16.970 --> 37:21.370]  plant all those seeds you start seeing the difference that's how you really
[37:21.370 --> 37:28.450]  know what you got going on and I'm gonna jump in just because we have a lot of
[37:28.450 --> 37:34.530]  people and I know that all of us love to talk as cannabis people I'm just
[37:34.530 --> 37:40.370]  gonna jump in a little bit but Marty thank you for all of that I I think you
[37:40.370 --> 37:46.570]  might be one of the very few people who breeds and has designs fertilizer and
[37:46.570 --> 37:49.970]  grows in multiple climates at the same time and that's really what I'd like to
[37:49.970 --> 37:57.490]  segue into the area that I'm kind of one of the most mostly interested in is what
[37:57.490 --> 38:04.770]  are your predictions for your varieties being grown indoors versus outdoors or
[38:04.770 --> 38:10.650]  you know drastically different light spectrums which I mean essentially what
[38:10.650 --> 38:18.970]  it is so like what are your predictions with that and let's start with David so
[38:18.970 --> 38:23.050]  like well one of the things we like to do is grow in multiple different
[38:23.050 --> 38:29.010]  environments we do full term we do greenhouse depths and then also indoor
[38:29.010 --> 38:33.530]  and finding plants that are functional throughout all of those spaces
[38:33.530 --> 38:42.370]  especially in me excuse me means pretty quick and ever-changing climate so we'd
[38:42.370 --> 38:46.890]  like to try to find plants that aren't gonna rot or could hold we're gonna hold
[38:46.890 --> 38:53.730]  up to a few frosts and you know as far as transferring into indoor or vice
[38:53.730 --> 38:59.250]  versa I find a lot of plants like love going between or don't mind it there are
[38:59.250 --> 39:04.210]  very few that maybe like lower light and don't like being out with full Sun or
[39:04.210 --> 39:08.250]  other plants that get under the artificial and maybe don't quite as
[39:08.250 --> 39:15.130]  expresses perfectly as it could but I think that's an important aspect of a
[39:15.130 --> 39:21.330]  plant something that we we sort of chose for our plan is something we use
[39:21.330 --> 39:27.690]  in production as in our medical business having a good extraction quality having
[39:27.690 --> 39:34.930]  good terpene mix so we have big bright loud fruits or very long-lasting fuels
[39:34.930 --> 39:40.850]  pallet coating is a huge part for us if it doesn't taste the same at the end of
[39:40.850 --> 39:46.850]  joint at the beginning it's something you know we try to stay away from those
[39:46.850 --> 39:50.850]  very volatile terpenes but a lot of times those work really well for extracts
[39:50.850 --> 39:57.170]  so there's there's some play that we had there but for us it's about the ability
[39:57.170 --> 40:04.910]  to be in diverse climates and be functional for the grower excellent can
[40:04.910 --> 40:11.630]  we have Ian answer that same question yeah I agree with David on the point of
[40:11.630 --> 40:16.910]  I'm an outdoor grower so I'm producing strains that do well in my environment
[40:16.910 --> 40:23.230]  I got to deal with a lot of things wind humidity and a whole bunch of other you
[40:23.230 --> 40:27.950]  know insect related issues because we're on the Atlantic Ocean we're very close
[40:27.950 --> 40:34.510]  to the shore I'm about that's a quarter mile from the coast so it's humid all
[40:34.510 --> 40:38.910]  the time we're in a direct West winds and I have to make plants that are gonna
[40:38.910 --> 40:44.910]  hold up to like the strong you know wind storms we get and also the humidity
[40:44.910 --> 40:51.470]  but I find transferring my plants to an indoor environment they do quite well
[40:51.470 --> 40:57.150]  the biggest issue that people have is are these plants gonna grow too big like
[40:57.150 --> 41:03.230]  in my tent or in my closet and have to tell them yes most plants are gonna grow
[41:03.230 --> 41:12.590]  large yeah I guess that's I agree with David on that one thanks yeah let's go with
[41:12.590 --> 41:24.430]  let's do let's do Aaron and Ben next pretty much right along the lines with
[41:24.430 --> 41:29.630]  what David and Ian both said when we chose this strain we chose something
[41:29.630 --> 41:35.950]  that is kind of one of our most versatile hitters I would say extremely
[41:35.950 --> 41:41.070]  resistant to powdery mildew to the effect of I've grown it in a facility
[41:41.070 --> 41:46.830]  that was riddled with powdery mildew and the entire row was completely resistant
[41:46.830 --> 41:52.590]  to it so really tried to select something that would be great for
[41:52.590 --> 41:58.830]  greenhouse we've also grown it in deep water and kind of give that versatility
[41:58.830 --> 42:01.790]  across the strain and make sure that it's something that no matter who
[42:01.790 --> 42:05.790]  participates and you know what they're doing as long as they're doing their best
[42:05.790 --> 42:09.710]  job they're gonna have success with it you know a lot of it comes down to the
[42:09.710 --> 42:14.910]  rigidity of your BPD and the way that the plant can actually process with this
[42:14.910 --> 42:20.110]  variation going through its system in vast quantities or in light quantities a
[42:20.110 --> 42:23.550]  lot of this comes down to bigger traits and it's interesting to see different
[42:23.550 --> 42:27.790]  cultivars not do well in different states and elevations and I believe a
[42:27.790 --> 42:32.270]  lot of that revolves around not only environmental but majority when it comes
[42:32.270 --> 42:36.830]  down to it just generally expressing differently in different environments it
[42:36.830 --> 42:42.110]  all comes down to your BPD and I equate it to like maybe working out with you
[42:42.110 --> 42:46.990]  know and wrestlers might understand this with the trash bag suit on versus not
[42:46.990 --> 42:51.470]  you know all of a sudden your limitations have changed your your actual
[42:51.470 --> 42:55.710]  individual inside the process hasn't changed but because the exterior has
[42:55.710 --> 43:01.390]  changed it now has to respond differently based on that volume so
[43:01.390 --> 43:07.070]  excellent I see I want to do I want to do Jeremy last because I feel like he is
[43:07.070 --> 43:13.230]  kind of like the the like outlier and I want to ask him the question a slightly
[43:13.230 --> 43:27.320]  different way so maybe do can we do Robbie oh you're muted oh am I now yeah
[43:27.400 --> 43:32.920]  can you hear me now okay cool so I think my favorite thing about the grow-off is
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.040]  that it really shows not only what the genetic of there the potential of the
[43:38.040 --> 43:42.760]  genetic is but also the potential of the grower at every single show I go to and
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.320]  like on my booth right now there's a picture from the Colorado one that has
[43:47.320 --> 43:52.120]  30 different things with the same strain that are all grown in different ways and
[43:52.120 --> 43:57.640]  then a set of the test results next to it so anytime somebody comes up and says
[43:57.640 --> 44:01.560]  well is this going to hit 30% I say well are you going to be able to be capable
[44:01.560 --> 44:07.000]  of making it hit 30% because it can do it but it has to do a lot with whether or
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.680]  not you are capable of doing it on your own and whether or not your grow is
[44:10.680 --> 44:16.760]  capable of producing it you know as far as indoor outdoor goes what I always
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.680]  tell people is that the the strongest weed is produced outdoors the prettiest
[44:20.680 --> 44:23.720]  weed is produced indoors and the strongest prettiest weed is produced in
[44:23.720 --> 44:30.040]  a greenhouse so you know if you're a good grower and you have a good method
[44:30.040 --> 44:37.240]  for for your things then the potential to to grow a 34% strain outside is
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.560]  totally there you can absolutely do that you can do it indoors too it really
[44:41.560 --> 44:47.400]  comes down to your your techniques your nutrients your lighting source all of
[44:47.400 --> 44:52.440]  the things that go into a grow your vapor pressure deficit like all of those
[44:52.440 --> 44:55.800]  things matter and if you don't take them seriously and you don't take them as
[44:55.800 --> 45:02.840]  part of the the way to really make the genetic shine then it doesn't matter
[45:02.840 --> 45:07.640]  what the genetic is because we had some stuff that tested at 34% and so in the
[45:07.640 --> 45:13.080]  same contest that tested at 17 so you know I don't think the THC numbers are
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.320]  the only thing that are involved but in this contest that's what we're aiming
[45:17.320 --> 45:23.080]  at and so like it really is very important to know that like we can do
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.320]  the best as providers that we possibly can for the genetic but you have to show
[45:27.320 --> 45:31.400]  up as a grower you have to show up as the cultivator you have to show up as
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.120]  the one who's going to take the belt home because I don't ever get to take
[45:34.120 --> 45:39.960]  the belt home as much as it you know makes me a little bit upset but the the
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.160]  belt always goes home to the best grower and that's what we're looking at here
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.240]  you know like as providers we're trying to give somebody the the best chance to
[45:47.240 --> 45:54.760]  hit the highest numbers but you got to do it so that's my two cents on it for
[45:54.760 --> 46:01.960]  sure Marty sure yeah I I'm agreeing with
[46:01.960 --> 46:07.080]  everybody it's like it's all the personal vibes that's what the art of
[46:07.080 --> 46:11.960]  growing is about the personal vibe and what you want to present to everybody
[46:12.120 --> 46:16.920]  it's that's the there's no there's no contest about that everyone's a winner
[46:16.920 --> 46:24.040]  right what you just said Jeremy about it's like giving someone a baking recipe
[46:24.040 --> 46:28.680]  and saying make this dough everyone's dough is going to come out different no
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.440]  matter who you know what I mean because they're going to put their own spice into
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.200]  it and everyone's going to wonder hey we use the same ingredients how did you
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.840]  make yourself fluffy and mine came out like a brick and you're like oh because
[46:40.920 --> 46:45.480]  you're too aggressive with it right and so the same thing goes with analytics
[46:45.480 --> 46:52.040]  yes you can hit 30 you know I don't know I test I have a HPLC machine so I'm able
[46:52.040 --> 46:58.840]  to test and see but really all three methods can produce the best quality as
[46:58.840 --> 47:02.600]  long as the grower that you said knows what they're doing and has the perfect
[47:02.600 --> 47:08.200]  timing on nutrients because I've worked with growers before who had an awesome
[47:08.200 --> 47:11.640]  looking crop but they're a mighty amount I don't understand why we're testing at
[47:11.640 --> 47:16.360]  15% and all my neighbors are testing at 24 and I start looking and I go well
[47:16.360 --> 47:19.960]  what are you giving oh this we're giving some blood meal we're giving these
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.800]  guanos and I go let me see the guano oh man that's fossilized guano that's time
[47:23.800 --> 47:27.080]  released you just got caught with your pants down dude it's still releasing
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.200]  nitrogen so the plant's not producing the cannabinoids it needs to do at the
[47:30.200 --> 47:33.880]  right time so yes you're getting structure you're getting this green but
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.320]  your plant's not producing what you need to produce you need to go a little
[47:37.320 --> 47:42.280]  longer brother and he's just like what so I need to go two more weeks and these
[47:42.280 --> 47:47.720]  guys need it now I'm like if you would if you would take away that nitrogen
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.760]  a little earlier and what you can't have that control with sometimes with
[47:51.760 --> 47:58.080]  amendments and your soil because your your DPD your environment can mess with
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.960]  how it's taken up in the soil so then you don't get the proper up to the plant
[48:03.960 --> 48:09.560]  the proper uptake unless you have analytics to really prove that you are
[48:09.560 --> 48:15.760]  getting it I mean I had one strain I did Georgia pie indoor and outdoor in LED
[48:15.760 --> 48:23.040]  HPS my coastal which never gets seven above 70 degrees and humid like 80
[48:23.040 --> 48:28.520]  degrees humidity I'm like two miles from the coast here in West Coast Pacific
[48:28.520 --> 48:34.360]  Ocean and in the trees you can see all the trees and I pulled it early but I
[48:34.360 --> 48:39.960]  because I didn't use it for extracts but because I analyzed it it was good enough
[48:39.960 --> 48:47.800]  in the 20s to use for a live extract and then out inland I was able to you know
[48:47.800 --> 48:57.200]  hit it at 31% and outdoor dry climate you know 100 degree weather 12 hours of
[48:57.200 --> 49:03.360]  Sun and then my LED and HPS all hit the same numbers because I adjusted the diet
[49:03.360 --> 49:11.120]  to the discipline and so yes you have to know your discipline whether it's
[49:11.120 --> 49:15.640]  hydroponics whether it's you know drained away whether it's living soil
[49:15.640 --> 49:20.400]  regenerative whether it's you know whatever you're doing timing is crucial
[49:20.400 --> 49:26.000]  when it comes down to one strain so that's how that's my take on it
[49:26.000 --> 49:35.920]  excellent so Jeremy you're the type three person and so I guess to reclarify
[49:35.920 --> 49:44.160]  the question was I don't know I mean how much of this hemp is grown indoors but
[49:44.160 --> 49:50.040]  or maybe perhaps in greenhouses or maybe just in different locations but are you
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.000]  seeing I mean I would assume like what are the big variations that you're
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.480]  seeing I know you guys are getting me sweating a little bit as you're talking
[49:59.480 --> 50:02.800]  about all the variability because I'm thinking Sam what the heck you set us up
[50:02.800 --> 50:09.040]  for here these people understand I have to now be sorry and that's how I talk
[50:09.040 --> 50:25.400]  sorry bro that's how I talk yeah so so anyway yeah what we're doing is we're
[50:25.400 --> 50:32.360]  doing 50 states obviously right and we're doing all the climate zones with
[50:32.360 --> 50:38.080]  the grow off here and then of course we're seeing indoor greenhouse and
[50:38.080 --> 50:43.240]  outdoor this the way the industry is kind of evolved Jamal has been really
[50:43.240 --> 50:49.000]  unique yes in 2000 you know 14 and 15 when we started the breeding program for
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.360]  type 3 plants and I want to be really clear like these are not this is not
[50:53.360 --> 50:57.760]  hemp there's nothing about this this is hemp we have been cheating a system and
[50:57.760 --> 51:03.440]  using drug drug type cultivar anomalies that just happened to be CBD leaners
[51:03.440 --> 51:09.080]  that we find pushing them towards the 30 to 1 ratio or as close to that as we
[51:09.080 --> 51:14.520]  can get consistently but these are very very diverse compound genetics way more
[51:14.520 --> 51:19.440]  diverse than most of the polyhybrids that we're working with today in the THC
[51:19.440 --> 51:24.480]  realm just because going back to you know to Robbie brilliant statements
[51:24.480 --> 51:29.200]  there buddy but you if you start targeting for something you're gonna get
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.040]  it that's what this plant does this plant responds to what we ask for from
[51:33.040 --> 51:38.400]  it so if you're if you're you know hey I want a 30 plus percent THC plant you're
[51:38.400 --> 51:43.440]  gonna get it anyway going back to climate diversity yeah we have an
[51:43.440 --> 51:47.600]  incredible challenge in front of us oh I'm sorry I left that talking about when
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.680]  we started breeding in 2014 we didn't know we only bred for hardiness we
[51:52.680 --> 51:56.320]  didn't know what what we were going to be you know that the industry was going
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.880]  to evolve into what it has we were looking at a single compound diverse a
[52:00.880 --> 52:07.840]  single compound industry or an industry based on extracting CBD and so when we
[52:07.840 --> 52:11.320]  started that breeding program we kind of said look you can make us breed for one
[52:11.320 --> 52:16.040]  compound but as cannabis breeders you can't make us breed out the rest we're
[52:16.040 --> 52:19.720]  gonna we're gonna carry all the terpenes and everything secondary metabolites
[52:19.720 --> 52:25.400]  forward with it now the industry is just matured in a direction that suits that
[52:25.400 --> 52:31.400]  so going you know fast-forwarding today yes we have this massive craft CBD
[52:31.400 --> 52:36.160]  industry that is blossoming in the United States and so we are seeing a
[52:36.160 --> 52:40.880]  ton of people putting you know converting rec space you know high-end
[52:40.880 --> 52:47.800]  LED rec space into craft CBD production we do see people producing greenhouse
[52:47.800 --> 52:52.400]  craft CBD like crazy and you know everybody should take a look at that
[52:52.400 --> 52:57.400]  because the economics of it aren't that far off when you remove metric and you
[52:57.400 --> 53:02.280]  remove 280e it starts to make sense and I think that's a lot of what stimulated
[53:02.280 --> 53:07.840]  that market but yeah we we see all of the different products and you know
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.000]  going to to what we're doing today I really want to just talk about that
[53:12.000 --> 53:20.960]  Jamal that we're about to see thanks to OP orange photonics who has in my
[53:20.960 --> 53:26.000]  humble opinion the most repeatable and reproducible machine on the market
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.840]  there's nothing that gives us consistency like that and that's coming
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.160]  from a guy who's had to deal with these bullshit that the labs have fed us for
[53:35.160 --> 53:41.920]  so long and create a stable line of genetics off of that bullshit right
[53:41.920 --> 53:46.200]  pardon my language that we had to hit a point three mark you know we had to hit
[53:46.200 --> 53:51.280]  that mark consistently and deliver that in a seed line to farmers so thanks to
[53:51.280 --> 53:59.000]  OP we're gonna be able to test hopefully 500 samples grown in all of those
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.640]  different climates and regions so in all those different environments and regions
[54:03.640 --> 54:10.080]  so meaning indoor greenhouse outdoor all the way around the country so one yeah
[54:10.080 --> 54:14.800]  the breeding for me was really tough but we came from that place we we were
[54:14.800 --> 54:19.560]  already breeding for all these climates and finding genetics that would stand up
[54:19.560 --> 54:23.960]  to everything the world would dish out um you know but whether that's mold
[54:23.960 --> 54:30.640]  tolerance pest resistance frost resistance you know so we we are we were
[54:30.640 --> 54:34.640]  up against that but even more I think we get to now see what everybody is kind of
[54:34.640 --> 54:41.080]  touching on all these smart breeders here on this you know podcast is plant
[54:41.200 --> 54:45.920]  plasticity you know we're gonna get to see a little bit about plant plasticity
[54:45.920 --> 54:50.960]  that we haven't been able to see before and the the skunk study will give us a
[54:50.960 --> 54:56.400]  lot you know but California is really forgiving man I mean it it's a really
[54:56.400 --> 55:00.840]  wonderful climate to grow in in most of the regions and then trust me Marty
[55:00.840 --> 55:04.360]  that's come from a guy who grew up in Western Oregon so I mean I know the
[55:04.360 --> 55:08.880]  challenges were up against in the fall but I still say it's a very forgiving
[55:08.880 --> 55:15.000]  climate so when we expand that out to not only the different you know
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.040]  environmental challenges but the different photo periods I think we're
[55:19.040 --> 55:24.640]  gonna see a lot in plant plasticity so thanks to OP for doing that we hope to
[55:24.640 --> 55:29.440]  get some other people involved and maybe look at some morphology as well but yeah
[55:29.440 --> 55:34.920]  I'm very interesting thing this plant plasticity deal I'd love all the
[55:35.240 --> 55:39.880]  I'd love all the breeders that are participating to do the hemp grow off
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.480]  because we can get you all a plant it's something really interesting to work
[55:43.480 --> 55:49.160]  with too and Jamal I have to hop off but I want to thank you again so much for
[55:49.160 --> 55:53.140]  bringing us all together and I know you I'm gonna hop in the comment section so
[55:53.140 --> 55:56.760]  I'll be chatting with you there and I think everyone's demonstrated how
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.800]  knowledgeable and like how much work has gone into these grow off plants so I'm
[56:01.800 --> 56:06.640]  gonna pop everyone's Instagrams in the comment section so everyone can follow
[56:06.640 --> 56:12.840]  you and hopefully join the grow off in your states we all owe this to Sam
[56:12.840 --> 56:17.840]  thank you thanks guys I'll be in the comments yeah all right so I just want
[56:17.840 --> 56:22.360]  so I want to kind of clarify this question and I think we're touching on a
[56:22.360 --> 56:25.680]  lot of things which is awesome this you know really is the meat and potatoes so
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.160]  we're talking about plant plasticity environment spectrum photo period
[56:32.160 --> 56:38.560]  terroir right how all of these things kind of mixed together the main impetus
[56:38.560 --> 56:47.400]  is for me I'm a mostly outdoor guy and I noticed that some lines hit outdoors and
[56:47.400 --> 56:53.080]  other ones not so much and that's kind of really what I'm like kind of
[56:53.080 --> 56:59.240]  scratching at is like for example purple urkel I love purple urkel I don't
[56:59.240 --> 57:06.160]  feel like it hits outside you know maybe I'm which one do you have did you know I
[57:06.160 --> 57:10.400]  don't need or the old is it the old California cold cut from back in the day
[57:10.400 --> 57:18.560]  and that's fine out here in Humboldt you know we did that back in the 90s 98 and
[57:18.560 --> 57:23.720]  it's outdoors if you know if you let it go longer you know you know maybe that's
[57:23.720 --> 57:29.360]  maybe that's that's the tip is that it needs to go longer because for me when I
[57:29.360 --> 57:36.000]  would do urkel it did great indoors it was nice you know it danced out it had
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.440]  the nice color it had everything outdoors it was a little bit more leafy
[57:41.440 --> 57:47.640]  it you know maybe we weren't able to let it go as long as it needed to before it
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.520]  would get butter on and you know maybe that was the issue but there is just
[57:51.520 --> 57:57.840]  certain lines in my experience that hit outdoors and certain ones that don't and
[57:57.840 --> 58:03.040]  in general most of them do fairly well indoors but like for example sour diesel
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.320]  sour diesel does great indoors it also does great outdoors and if you do a
[58:07.320 --> 58:12.880]  really good outdoors it almost looks very close to indoor so I'm just kind of
[58:12.880 --> 58:17.160]  trying to like I think that's where temperature and climate and how the
[58:17.160 --> 58:21.440]  season affects the soil comes into play like in Maine you know like in our
[58:21.440 --> 58:27.040]  greenhouses we grow sour diesel that could stand next to anyone's indoor but
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.880]  as soon as you put it full term we call it like sour without the diesel and it's
[58:31.880 --> 58:38.840]  it's across a lot of fuel heavy streams that don't quite have that note until
[58:38.840 --> 58:44.640]  later in their flower period so like it in Maine if it hits you know you go from
[58:44.640 --> 58:52.680]  say 75 85 degrees in late September all of a sudden October 1st through the 15th
[58:52.680 --> 58:58.720]  you're not getting over 65 degrees and I feel like that's when that 10 degree
[58:58.720 --> 59:04.520]  boost and then also that the warmer soil temperature in places like Humboldt or
[59:04.520 --> 59:08.960]  places that hold that temperature longer you really get that full maturing of
[59:08.960 --> 59:14.480]  those streams like in Maine a lot of times if the turf isn't there in early
[59:14.480 --> 59:18.440]  to mid flower like you're never just you're never gonna get it so a lot of
[59:18.440 --> 59:25.480]  the more successful streams it has to sort of like meet that criteria I agree
[59:25.480 --> 59:30.480]  Jamal with with what David is saying but I would add to that having had our
[59:30.480 --> 59:36.320]  catalog of the same seed grown 49 degrees north latitude down to 15
[59:36.320 --> 59:43.680]  degrees north latitude don't underestimate the photo period and the
[59:43.840 --> 59:48.280]  spectrum of the Sun as well so that's what we've seen the greatest influence
[59:48.280 --> 59:53.640]  on I think that's one of the coolest aspects of outdoor growing because
[59:53.640 --> 59:58.840]  that's a variable lack of control area where you won't ever have it I mean it's
[59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.560]  like you're relying on Mother Nature and the positioning of the Sun and then
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.160]  you're also getting different spectrums at different points of the season so it
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.640]  triggers different awarenesses of the plant so I mean it's one of the most
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:17.040]  exotic ways to experience the genetic is growing it outdoors and to your point
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.480]  you know it's funny because as a cultivar you'll know what's been bred in
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:30.400]  an intermediate area because you'll see certain you know strengths and
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.600]  resiliencies that you won't in the other populations based on the evolutionary
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.840]  evolutionary took meaning I can take the same genetics and if it's grown
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.000]  drastically different over a course of let's say Stokes Gardens all of a sudden
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.480]  all can see this right Robbie can you can you mute for a second we're getting
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.620]  a little bit of sound of squishing thanks no worries I'll consistently be
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.840]  seeing different expressions to the way that it's actually gonna protect itself
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.880]  from certain pests so in cases of like powdery mildew acceptance you know and
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.680]  the way that it's actually expressing itself and I think that's something that
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.960]  is really exciting as a breeder is to see actual outdoor gardens with your
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.640]  expressions if you're breeding for those traits and a lot of us lost focus we
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.320]  only bred for high teens or we only bred for a certain turkey profiles and so we
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.080]  lost the old-school way of looking at a strain and actually is this rep
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.840]  repeatable in all these environments because you see guys like Casey brains
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:40.040]  all of his strains did well outdoors in the early years we didn't really look at
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.080]  him like an indoor breeder well none of his strains were developed indoors and
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.960]  that's one of the reasons why he had such an outdoor allotments and when we
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.920]  were looking at outdoor strains in a catalog based out of the late 90s early
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.760]  thousands Casey brains was the guy we were looking at when it came to outdoor
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:01.920]  genetics because he literally only kept his stuff outdoors so over these course
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.800]  of times it's almost like your background right if you're raised a
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.600]  certain way you might have a higher ratio of turning out a certain way it
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.800]  doesn't mean you will be but means that those ratios are now in a higher
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.120]  statistical value and so the percentage in which you'll see it do that then
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.520]  great and that's the life of a plant if we far too often have this line of
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.600]  separation of human and plant when really if we look at it like our life
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.320]  experiences if a doppelganger of myself was raised differently we'd be two
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.000]  totally different adults we'd have a lot of same physical aspects but we'd
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.400]  be two totally different adults and that's something that's very true in the
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.240]  plant world I was thinking about you guys remember the movie twins with
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.680]  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.480]  yeah like it's nothing like that the expression so looks for now it's one of
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.080]  those breeding companies that I thought would be around forever you know where
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:18.160]  are they interesting the indoor culture really took over and from what I
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.600]  understand it kind of worked his seeds into a lesser sold category and that's
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.960]  kind of how that worked out I may be mistaken mind you uh this is a lot of
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:34.160]  old news coming back through my mind so no it's just it's the reality I think of
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.400]  I think about you know a hipster walking into a dispensary saying I want this
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.840]  like the Tiva heirloom blah blah and like the idea of that is is so
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:52.120]  interesting but the reality we're gonna choose the second stream that will give
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:57.160]  them more fight with their friends and actually smoke green and I feel like
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.040]  I wonder how many of our control mechanisms we lose to these processes
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.960]  right like when we start to get these categories that now have a genetic of
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.080]  everybody's genetic and it we've almost bottlenecked the expressions into where
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.440]  you can pop two different separate cultivars and see very similar
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:20.760]  expressions in an almost twin like setting and you almost wonder where it
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.000]  came from and it's kind of intriguing because we're overlooking a lot of this
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.440]  moving the ball forward and now we're starting to look backwards and a lot of
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.600]  us have looked backwards in the circle which is why I'm really thrilled to be
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.280]  here with all y'all we know that though the older genetics hold the key you know
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.680]  we can always move the ball forward but we can't move the ball back so if these
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.600]  things aren't protected we now are setting in a situation where we're a cat
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.520]  without whiskers trying to stay from behind the fridge you know where we may
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:58.120]  find ourselves in a dead-end street we put ourselves there accidentally I think
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.720]  that's why we need to be weaving these things back in constantly I keep hearing
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.120]  about this three-headed snake idea and just talking about bringing genetics
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.840]  that are either similar in parallel or vastly different and weaving these
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.280]  three things together constantly to like allow that old expression to find its way
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.840]  into new expressions and then also double up on traits that you're really
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:29.880]  looking for a not reading out diversity though I think it's nice that the
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:35.080]  conversation is at least there that we're all at that phase that we all have
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.240]  evolved to the point where we recognize that breeding for one compound is not
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.440]  the direction that we want to go and that it hurts the plant so and on this
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.240]  particular in this particular group we have a bunch of preservationists so you
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.960]  know I know Robbie does preservation work I know Marty does Jamal does I do a
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.760]  lot of preservation work so just holding those seeds for now while we all wake up
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.960]  this is very important but yeah it's neat the diverse diversification
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:11.320]  conversation is happening yeah I have to jump off here but before I do I just
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:17.160]  want to say that if we wanted a hundred percent THC we would all smoke distillate
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:26.400]  I don't think anybody here smokes distillate so yeah if that's really the
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.960]  important thing let's all just go get a fucking distillate set up and we'll we'll
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.480]  all just smoke a whole bunch of distillate but since we know it's not
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.360]  you know that's why we're going for what we do anyway I really appreciate all you
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.480]  guys this time and the the brilliant minds that are in this con and this
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:46.000]  podcast and be able to be part of it so I'm sorry I can't stay any longer but I
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.040]  gotta go attend to my booth so good luck at all your states so what oh go
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:00.840]  ahead I'll say what you're talking about not just to kind of chime in on that
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.960]  when you're talking about like you know the diversity of one plant and you know
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.880]  the humans and the twins that was that kind of triggered me and then also what
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:15.040]  Jeremy was saying so when the I own the light lab before they have even the hemp
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.600]  module even available so once they had it I started testing my regular cannabis
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.560]  genetics and so that's where I found a hemp compliant one from regular CBD non
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.640]  hemp strains I think it was back in 2017 or something like that when they fish
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:37.880]  released that first firmware anyways it's interesting from the same seed
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:43.840]  stock though is it was originally bred to be a one-to-one so I found the hemp
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.240]  compliant one and then I found ones that are very low in like a 1% but then
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:56.320]  there was a few seeds that actually tested 30% with no CBD so that's why
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.920]  analytics and the different areas that we were doing too is whoa we were
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.280]  testing them you know indoor outdoor and greenhouses that same strain with our
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.160]  same nutrients and hitting them at different times already like in 2018 and
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:18.640]  then we found that that one that was 30% and it looked exactly identical to the
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.840]  hemp one and I was just like no way this is crazy how you know like all these are
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:31.360]  CBD dominant and then you got this outlier that's like 30% and 30% THC
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.720]  tastes the same smells the same but gets you a way different high so I just
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.680]  wanted to add to you about the twins thing is like yeah we got Arnold
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:50.840]  Schwarzenegger over here and then we got a little Danny DeVito so Marty Marty do
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:57.560]  you find that while using analytics does that increase the predictability of
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.440]  your breeding it's like if you're looking for oh yes no because what what
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:10.320]  I do and what I suggest everyone does and this is why when once what tanks
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:20.360]  came to my house and dropped off a unit free pre hemp firmware was because I
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.520]  take the same sample that I I'm gonna take the ISO lab and I split that
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:32.040]  between the ones I'm gonna test on my own against my own SOPs and the liquid
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.480]  chromatography that I do old school way with the drops and compare all the
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:42.520]  results and see my how far off I am and so if the ISO lab that I trust that I've
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.360]  been through because you know that's where we're one of the biggest problems
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.440]  and with breeding is like you take it to them mean you tell them what you expect
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.880]  and they might give you something different they want to fuck with you or
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.480]  something like that she's my language but they literally do you know they want
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.880]  you to tell them oh it's hemp compliant then you go to another three different
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.640]  labs and they tell you yes and compliant and that one just starts messing with
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.880]  you because they don't want you to be compliant or they want yours to be
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.600]  inflated to 30% that's why I was like okay take it and send that sample to all
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.960]  the different labs that you tested and start comparing those to your SOP that's
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.600]  how you know when you're starting to breed and starting to see these things
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.880]  you can start to see the predictability you just have asked about you can start
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.760]  predicting it through the analytics saying okay wait a second here although
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:40.600]  some although some cannabinoids are pretty hard to predict like THC VA right
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:44.840]  now I have I've been breeding with some thinking that they're gonna pass on to
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:49.480]  every single seed that's not the case okay so it's it's a whole new journey
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:56.560]  okay so once I do get established some dominance yes of that cannabinoid then
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:03.360]  yes I predict that the it'll all be predictable past that point interesting
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.320]  whenever I would love Jeremy to Ben you're welcome to touch in but I would
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.880]  love Jeremy at one point I know he has some experience with that real quick I
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:18.720]  just wanted to touch base on that and ask if this is a grandparent trait you
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.760]  know how in the human genome we have the skippage generation traits right and I'm
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.320]  wondering if this THC V process may fall under that category and have you
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.960]  cracked into the grandparent or the grandchildren of these strains to look
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:41.440]  for the same thing or is this so so that I I got what you're saying because it's
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.360]  two generations and I have no idea because the way I got this was my guy
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:52.880]  grew up with in Davis a buddy of mine his family has owned like a lot of land
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:59.280]  in Zambia since like the 70s and so he after his divorce he decided to go live
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.040]  in Zambia for a while he got these seeds from the bush and from Zanzibar and so
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:11.800]  who knows I mean this is a trait that was probably passed on for generations
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:18.000]  and generations and generations and they weren't using it for you know to get
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.800]  high they were using it for spirituality and for Medicaid you know medicating and
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.000]  different kind of ceremony you know different things that they were using it
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.520]  for so they weren't really looking for they're looking for more the effect of
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:38.000]  what the what was going on lo and behold that these 20 plus year old seeds had so
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.680]  when I do analytics usually the numbers are really low so I'll give you an
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:50.880]  example like OG kush will typically test around three and a half to four percent
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:57.600]  when it's a clone right so that's when you're doing live analytics that's just
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.560]  to give you a baseline right so that usually translates to about mid 20s in
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:09.960]  THC that number so when I start seeing these little categories of ratios with
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:18.840]  live numbers then I can track it through growing it right so the THC V actually
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:26.120]  was one a 1.5 percent higher than the THC which was like 2% which I'm assuming
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:33.880]  is going to be about mid teens in THC so that means the THC VA if this is true is
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:43.710]  going to be in the 20s there's no very many strains that have 20% over 20% THC
[01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:49.990]  but this is a male so now I got to like breed this into other strains and one
[01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:54.910]  of the projects I am doing right now is my CBD strain so I've already made seed
[01:13:54.910 --> 01:14:00.670]  with it with the high THC VA and because of the orange photonics and what Jeremy
[01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:08.110]  does now with his thing I've I'm gonna now do a series of back crosses to try
[01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:18.830]  to establish a zero THC a or you know compliant THC a with THC VA strong and
[01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:26.430]  high CBD because that they don't track THC VA you know so that's my project
[01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:30.550]  right there and I'm open about that because there's people like phylos and
[01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:35.470]  this frontier trying to do that already they have a whole science team and I'm
[01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:39.350]  just this little fertilizer guy that's a pothead for 30 plus years going shoot I
[01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:44.430]  can do this myself you got I've been doing I've been breeding and doing
[01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:51.510]  medicating myself for over 30 plus years I got this you know but yeah it's
[01:14:51.510 --> 01:15:04.290]  interesting about how plants can establish to hominids muted Jamal I was
[01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:11.370]  gonna Jeremy do you want to touch on you know the necessity to use what is it
[01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:14.770]  like the orange photonics machine I mean that was basically the question
[01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:21.330]  was how effective is it to use these extra testing tools and send out samples
[01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:26.610]  to get where you need to be with breeding okay well I'll say I'll just
[01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:30.730]  touch on that from two sides like first off there's a danger in using analytics
[01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:38.610]  because early on what drove us to all of these great expressions was this and
[01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:44.250]  this right so our experience and so we have to be very cautious when we use
[01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:52.050]  HPLC and analytics to sort of guide us and and so but but that doesn't take
[01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:55.810]  away from the fact that it's a powerful tool once you start to really open it up
[01:15:55.810 --> 01:16:02.290]  the consistency like that we can see in our reports as a breeder you know they
[01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:08.170]  they improve and so I guess what I would just say to the breeders here speaking
[01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:14.170]  breeder to breeder and you Jamal like you know that that little box go back to
[01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:18.330]  the beginning and when we started breeding type 3 and breeding for
[01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:24.210]  compliance like Marty says what we realized very quickly and we've come to
[01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:29.570]  learn this and and validate it through understanding analytics better today you
[01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:34.690]  know that these HPLCs have a really hard time the lower down that they get in
[01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:39.610]  trying to quantify these compounds right so when you get below 1% the
[01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:44.770]  machine gets all frickin wonky and and we didn't know that back then so what we
[01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:50.570]  learned real quickly is that okay so if we want to get a real picture of what
[01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:55.970]  this mature flower actually looks like in a cannabinoid testing this is
[01:16:55.970 --> 01:17:02.130]  embarrassing we take one pile of that flower and we break it into eight samples
[01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:07.170]  so we'd homogenize it break it into eight samples and then tell the lab that
[01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:12.130]  they were all different and then send it to them and you guys would be amazed 20
[01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:19.450]  plus 20% variability same day same machine same sample and then we'd take
[01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:23.570]  that median number and that was our number that was okay there's our
[01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:29.850]  baseline that's how we bred compliant genetics now fast forward not only do we
[01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.410]  have a tool that doesn't cost prohibitive for us right and I'm not
[01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:38.010]  here to pitch Opie I'm just a breeder that's me like I bottom line I'm
[01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:43.570]  breeding for all this time I've been here before HPLC was accessible to us
[01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:48.490]  when it became accessible as Marty starts to talk about and then as it's
[01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:52.810]  improved technologies improved but today where we are is we don't have labs as a
[01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:57.770]  gatekeeper because of that for our breeding programs you know one it was
[01:17:57.770 --> 01:18:02.770]  cost prohibitive for us to look at any kind of a decent population because
[01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:06.690]  you're not going to look at a hundred samples you got to narrow that down as a
[01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:11.530]  breeder phenotype down from plant morphology commercial as I you know is
[01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:17.490]  it commercial is it commercially viable and then you test those populations and
[01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:21.210]  they're narrow populations so now we have the ability not only to test these
[01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:26.730]  populations completely at the end of the cycle in a way that's 12 and 14 minutes
[01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:32.010]  and is not cost prohibitive because of consumables but now we can even look at
[01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:36.250]  what Marty was talking about is we're going through the plant cycle we can
[01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:40.530]  start to determine what's going on and you know bring it back I think Marty is
[01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:44.850]  very evolved in this process but what he's talking about there is actually
[01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:51.170]  looking at the presence leaf presence of on early young plants of cannabinoids
[01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:54.970]  and looking at the ratios and determining which population to move
[01:18:54.970 --> 01:19:00.530]  forward from that which you know I I would say that's probably my like the
[01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:04.330]  one that I would hold up to you guys as a statement of what these labs did to us
[01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:10.130]  early on to build breeding programs is I have a $30,000 receipt just one
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:15.770]  $30,000 receipt for presence testing and that was one of a whole subset of those
[01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:21.010]  because that was the only way that we could learn is using these labs with
[01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:27.810]  chemists so you know one it's dangerous let's let's never forget to use I left
[01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:35.410]  this one out our hearts right our hearts our noses our eyes and our minds to
[01:19:35.410 --> 01:19:40.970]  breed towards what we want because you know it does come from us Jamal like you
[01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:45.090]  know these these errors the best plants out there in my opinion are these heirlooms
[01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:49.890]  we're preserving we call them land root races guys but almost all of these
[01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:54.010]  plants have been touched by humans you know they've been pushed into a
[01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:58.050]  direction and and there's a reason those are some of the best and it's not because
[01:19:58.050 --> 01:20:03.850]  those guys had HPM so but then the other side of that is look breeders if they're
[01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:11.090]  requiring certain you know compounds of us there are tools that we can use to
[01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:16.850]  accelerate our process and give us a competitive angle against as what Marty
[01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:22.130]  referenced the phyllosis of the world that are just out there sequencing and
[01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:27.610]  you know with a full lab with GC and HPLC so I guess that's the beauty of
[01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:33.730]  the orange photonics light lab and it was half the cost of what you said that
[01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:37.090]  tab you just said right there when you said 30 something thousand like dude you
[01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:43.050]  just are you kidding me 14 why pay 14 now they're more but 14 yeah you can get
[01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:48.730]  them for under the flexibility yeah you can get them for under 20 and the main
[01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:53.770]  thing is is like then you've got the box man I mean you just you you go through
[01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:59.530]  your consumables there's a recal you know every so many tests you call them
[01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:04.690]  replacement but no the cost of running these things is really low once you
[01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:11.570]  justify the expense and I don't know like Ian Aaron Ben you know Marty already
[01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:15.690]  knows like everybody that's been on here we're all looking we're all heading
[01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:19.770]  the same direction I don't know a single person that's sitting on this podcast
[01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:24.650]  that plans to do anything but fuck with cannabis for a long time so you know I
[01:21:24.650 --> 01:21:28.770]  like this aspect I like this aspect that you can walk right by with it you know
[01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:34.010]  you just like it's super small super easy this is what I like about it it's
[01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:42.530]  really small crack it open Marty show them what it is so this is a mini HPLC
[01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:50.650]  initial okay let's see if we get the camera right okay so it's a you guys see
[01:21:50.650 --> 01:21:54.290]  it I'm just on the iPhone yeah there you go okay
[01:21:54.290 --> 01:22:02.330]  disclaimer Marty does not work for me and I do not we just we're just breeders
[01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:08.970]  how about for the system to it's an amazing system as a breeder to have
[01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:14.770]  access even if it's just helping you establish a baseline of where you are in
[01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:18.090]  that current hunt that you're doing or the current breeding set that you're
[01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:24.970]  doing and then at that point you know we've used it in the past to pick our
[01:22:24.970 --> 01:22:29.250]  top five top six in the direction we're going with and then we pay to have the
[01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:34.930]  lab analysis done on those genetics and it's really saved a lot of money and
[01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:39.410]  allowed us to accelerate things in the program by using it as a guideline well
[01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:45.890]  um so when you did that I assume that you probably had some favorites or some
[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:50.250]  like you had like you had an idea of like which ones you thought were gonna
[01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:57.650]  be the keepers where you prove correct or you proved wrong both both and it
[01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:01.250]  came down to smoking and I gotta be honest when you're doing your your
[01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:08.770]  pheno hunts you know now one thing you end up missing stuff you can't sit here
[01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:12.730]  and proclaim that this is better than this when it's you know six joints apart
[01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:17.890]  and you're high off the other six you know and so our way of going through
[01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:22.050]  things is really interesting because you're talking about months and weeks
[01:23:22.050 --> 01:23:27.050]  not just one experience of this genetic but actually going back and forth and
[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:32.130]  touching them all repetitive almost like an OCD kid just to see if you're
[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:37.210]  right and different days different experiences you know your biology is
[01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:42.290]  technically slightly variated on any given so you know time and motion so
[01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:45.330]  your experience can vary and all these things have to play an account when
[01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:49.330]  you're pheno hunting yeah well we've actually been leaning more on an
[01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:53.970]  analytical side with a program called canal itx where we're able to designate
[01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:59.410]  with the terpenes as well as the the cannabinoid counts how this conditionally
[01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:04.250]  can score in certain categories and it's been helping us to actually dictate
[01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:09.810]  where we're going more so than you know maybe fog our own experience yeah so we
[01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:14.210]  have been leaning a little bit more towards using the analytics but
[01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:19.410]  specifically with what our program what we're doing is we're working with this
[01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:23.010]  catalytic program it weighs the cannabinoids against the terpenes and it
[01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:27.690]  has an algorithm that has a weighted effect and it tells you what the actual
[01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:33.490]  effect is so instead of being maybe high THC focused we're starting to steer
[01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:38.250]  towards how it actually makes you feel or the medicinal properties and how it's
[01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:44.050]  going to affect you at the end of the day you know for instance I'll just give
[01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:48.650]  one example sleep is a good one a lot of people go into the dispensary and they
[01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:54.010]  ask for something that's gonna help them fall asleep you know my next
[01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:59.490]  question would be are you trying to help get up all sleep faster are you trying
[01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:04.530]  to stay asleep longer are you trying to get more REM sleep well those are three
[01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:10.050]  you listen those are three unique cannabinoid to terpene profiles that are
[01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:15.530]  gonna give you that effect you know and a common misunderstanding from the lay
[01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:20.370]  person that walks into the dispensary is maybe they're in pain and they want high
[01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:25.730]  THC high THC well what they're not being educated about is that the higher the
[01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:29.450]  THC the less pain attributes you're actually gonna get the pain relief from
[01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:34.570]  because the high THC is inhibiting those lockers in your brain to allow for the
[01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:39.570]  pain relief you want to be a little more CBD focused so it's really been
[01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:43.970]  interesting to see now that we're using science instead of just an educated
[01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:49.290]  guess to see the direction that we're going but ultimately you know I got to
[01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:53.050]  agree with Jeremy still at the end of the day even though we have all of this
[01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:57.410]  analytical software that we are using to drive our current breeding program we
[01:25:57.410 --> 01:26:02.330]  also still very much rely on how does it make you feel at the end of the day with
[01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:07.370]  the taste and the flavor and the memory and what it leaves in your mouth of you
[01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:11.330]  know wanting more or it brings you back to that moment you know that you
[01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:15.170]  remember because that flavor was something you had back in you know the
[01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:23.450]  90s so it's just been very interesting to see how both sides are starting to
[01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:26.410]  you know build out the future of cannabis and we're finding that certain
[01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:32.750]  things so you can't just go get single quantity volumes anymore it's if this is
[01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:36.370]  in play then you've got to reduce what that's doing for you in the other
[01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:41.310]  category and that's where this canal it X program steps in for us so we still
[01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:47.070]  like everybody specifies we go off of what we feel but from there we take it
[01:26:47.070 --> 01:26:51.830]  the next step forward and see if it actually catalogs itself properly or if
[01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:56.030]  there's other things in play we're not actually calibrating for excellent I
[01:26:56.030 --> 01:27:04.110]  would like to have a conscious cultivars I saw that you just gosh and well yeah
[01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:11.110]  and I don't know if you'd like to touch on that if you use any type of analytics
[01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:18.790]  type of your breeding the the chase for THC right now is the biggest detriment
[01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:23.950]  to our genetic base since prohibition or maybe even before that so we've we've
[01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:28.270]  got a completely different route not chasing THC at all over these last 25
[01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:35.470]  years definitely going for flavor Angela here she perverse flavor and and taste
[01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:39.470]  and effect over you know any of that which I'm speaking to the choir here but
[01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:44.350]  to anyone listening you know chasing those THC scores is causing breeders
[01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:49.750]  maybe not these on the show here but other breeders to let strains fall off
[01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:56.910]  and what we've done over like missing the forest or the trees kind of approach
[01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:04.030]  with the you know trying to the THC part of you know there's so many other parts
[01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:10.150]  and like the lady who was saying something I'm just getting in here so
[01:28:10.150 --> 01:28:15.310]  I'm that's why I'm kind of like but everything you said you were you were on
[01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:22.270]  point I like what you were saying yeah yeah so you know as you guys know chasing
[01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:25.670]  these THC scores with the way the recreational market is strains were
[01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:30.510]  falling off left and right especially in the last 10 years even prior that we're
[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:37.670]  preserving strains once we've made but also fellow breeders made to that fell
[01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:41.990]  out of desire from the virus we still set those aside for breeding purposes
[01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:49.110]  later and have actually you know found a good place in the market for people
[01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:53.950]  seeking seeds and genetics but also sunflower to shops nationwide is that
[01:28:53.950 --> 01:29:00.230]  they are preferring these old-school flavorful strains there is a you know a
[01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:06.350]  younger generation pushing towards those THC scores but you know like you said
[01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:11.550]  we're losing sight of the whole thing and I do appreciate the analytics and we
[01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:15.710]  are using the analytics to know what to bring to market but we aren't letting
[01:29:15.710 --> 01:29:21.550]  anything go extinct in that meantime and I think that's just you know that's a
[01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:25.430]  lot of our passion why we're even doing what we do first of it's just the love
[01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:31.670]  of ganja and you know the love of reggae music that brought this together and
[01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:36.590]  into fruition and keeping something after we lost a strain in like 98 we're
[01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:44.590]  like oh we can't do that again and so we started you know trying to capture those
[01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:48.430]  genetics this is way before analytics any DNA testing any of that stuff so
[01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:53.190]  we're just going on our noses our sites and how they held up to you know the
[01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:59.270]  lost coast of California and really we just want to see more people pushing for
[01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:04.070]  the flavor we talked in Illinois recently to the regulatory department
[01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:09.710]  there about not even and same in New York but trying we were pushing for not
[01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:16.710]  having THC scores because I think you guys all know what's what's happening
[01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:24.350]  with that and those that don't know is that buyers go in and and will go in and
[01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:27.430]  say hey what's the highest THC like you're just talking about it's like I
[01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:30.750]  need to sleep better I need high THC that's there's so many more questions
[01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:34.870]  beyond that and most likely won't even work in the effect they want you know
[01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:39.190]  what we're smoking right now one of these strains in here tested 12%
[01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:44.150]  originally the juicy fruit and the other one is a stinky pink which is at 16% we
[01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:50.390]  spoke that for all sorts of things that we do about our day you know from just
[01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:57.310]  easing the mind and focusing to being able to you know go out and enjoy a
[01:30:57.310 --> 01:31:02.830]  social gathering more we're looking at those kind of effects of things and we
[01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:07.230]  realize that it's almost impossible to sell those kind of THC scores now but
[01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:11.790]  we're starting to gain traction and with like-minded people like yourself we see
[01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:15.470]  that going a lot further that I have been listening we have been listening
[01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:19.590]  from backstage so we wanted to touch on some other stuff but we don't want to
[01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:24.550]  hog the conversation right now so you know we'll chime in when when we see fit
[01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:28.670]  or if you guys got a question for us for sure for sure for sure I wanted to also
[01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:34.550]  get Ian in because I noticed that we haven't got you involved too much
[01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:39.830]  yeah I'm quiet by nature and there's a lot for me to take in listening so I've
[01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:46.390]  been enjoying that but I just want to mention that using machine or not using
[01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:51.830]  the machine for analytics it's not better and it's not any worse it's just
[01:31:51.830 --> 01:32:00.710]  different the way I do yes thing is all by my eyes nose and hands and my
[01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:06.510]  analytics are that paper and pencil so as long as you're recording what you're
[01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:10.150]  smelling and seeing and you can actually remember to the end of your
[01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:15.590]  grow what's going on you're gonna get the same results it just takes a lot
[01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:22.510]  longer to do a lot of determination yeah and a lot of effort involved it's a
[01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:26.870]  different route you're navigating yes same destination yeah and I'd love to
[01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:34.830]  share you know my process which is um I really like to select by how fast the
[01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:41.710]  jars get smoked yes the jar yes that's you know because ultimately I'm the
[01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:44.950]  person that's gonna be smoking it I'm the person that's gonna be testing it
[01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:53.190]  and for me I want with my seeds the imprint to be oh yeah that's Jamal stuff
[01:32:53.190 --> 01:32:58.990]  you know like it may not be the prettiest the plants may not yield the
[01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:06.230]  most but when I smoke it it's it gives me a certain thing and you know like all
[01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:10.950]  the strains are a little different but they have this yeah you said it you know
[01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:15.870]  and it's like yeah or imprint on to like the plasticity of the strain it's like
[01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:21.750]  they're kind of like yeah you know like for example DJ short great example are
[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:28.550]  the buds super flavorful and do the plants grow that well and but does it
[01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:33.430]  give you a certain effect yes that's what it does you breed with it it goes
[01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:37.150]  in a specific direction and that's just like the direction when you meet DJ
[01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:41.590]  short he's totally like that you're like okay like I can see with his
[01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:46.230]  personality he bred for a specific thing and I can just kind of see that there's
[01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:52.350]  other people like for example I mean this is a total stereotype but like
[01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:58.670]  swamp boys you've seen them they all are tatted out that crew of people you
[01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:03.030]  know they're like all cool guys I'm like okay you see their weed it's like it's
[01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:09.110]  frosty the buds are fat that's that's their thing you know what I mean like
[01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:13.510]  it's just like everybody kind of has their thing that like they imprint onto
[01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:18.870]  their genetics or hopefully and that's kind of in my opinion like what you're
[01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:23.550]  purchasing is like you're supporting a strain that's been put in a certain
[01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:29.750]  direction by by the first or like Bodhi is another great example where he runs
[01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:35.710]  clones that tons of people have but then he puts his mail on it so in like a
[01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:41.750]  certain direction it gives it a certain vibe to it that like you know which is I
[01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:45.790]  think really awesome because I mean at the end of the day you're supporting
[01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:50.990]  this breeder and you're supporting like their brand they're the idea of them
[01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:55.350]  that's kind of why a lot of people are like you know I don't like cookies I
[01:34:55.350 --> 01:35:00.110]  don't like burner I don't like all that stuff is a straight fire well yeah but
[01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:10.070]  there's people sorry that was just my someone to jump in with yeah and now that
[01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:15.910]  everyone's been talking out of like you know what how it should be in your
[01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:20.390]  adding all the different elements because like for instance Josh is your
[01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:27.910]  mic on anyways I had this super haze strain and dust streak as you're talking
[01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:31.070]  about dust treat from like a while back and so we've had dust treat from
[01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:36.830]  overseas from like in the 90s and I took this super haze to which is skunk haze
[01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:49.070]  three before I started it turn your mic off Josh I'm muted anyways I bred it to
[01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:54.750]  an f3 in the early now I'm here the spotty signal 2000s before any kind of
[01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:58.110]  analytics doing the same exact thing that Ian was saying you know I do the
[01:35:58.110 --> 01:36:02.350]  traditional breeding but I you know I incorporate the analytics into it now
[01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:06.670]  I've been popped in all my seeds from that super haze cross from back in the
[01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:11.110]  early 2000 and see now back to the consistency because of what I've
[01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:15.790]  selected from the f3 male I'm starting to see a lot of those characteristics
[01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:20.150]  dominate into a lot of those other crosses from my blue cheese all the way
[01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:23.590]  to OG kush all the way to this I was like wow everything I've been planting
[01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:27.990]  is starting to see some dominance but you get the structure of like the OG I
[01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:33.110]  wasn't even doing any kind of analytics doing the same smell taste blah blah
[01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:37.190]  then once I stopped started getting this machine it's like okay why is this
[01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:41.790]  one giving me and all my friends of that no effects good so you do hit high
[01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:48.510]  cannabinoids and it has good effect I just call that a bonus and you're lucky
[01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:55.670]  you got a bonus if you're not seeking it but at least you know you have it but
[01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:59.030]  yeah if you go by your senses that's traditional breeding I totally agree I
[01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:04.310]  do that before even like I do the smell rub I do all that stuff and then you
[01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:11.590]  know and then I tested the plants now like the ones that stand out the ones
[01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:14.790]  that can withstand a lot of the things or I even wait until they're totally
[01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:19.630]  finished just to for the element of surprise to not even know so it's kind
[01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:23.510]  of fun to have that machine or around opie around the light lab around so you
[01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:26.670]  can you can choose your own adventure you know you can go now I want to go
[01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:31.110]  back to my roots and see what you know what I'm selecting again and just kind
[01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:36.550]  of watch the plants and then you're like that's what I thought you know 30 years
[01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:40.350]  of doing this man I go I can know what I'm looking for okay here we go I'm
[01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:45.030]  looking for this right here also because I've epilepsy and so I know what my
[01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:49.430]  senses are wanting to like pull a medication out of my certain strain so
[01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:53.630]  I'm like I know that this one right here like I can feel that vibe so yeah a lot
[01:37:53.630 --> 01:37:57.550]  of it's the senses you know and then well hey Marty speaking of medication
[01:37:57.550 --> 01:38:01.710]  did I hear you speaking about a male that was testing high THC V because I
[01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:09.630]  had that female yeah yeah or THC V yeah cuz I had one that when you come down
[01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:13.270]  when you come down when you come down for searing about it we'll hash it out
[01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:17.810]  dude we'll talk about it okay yeah I mean I have we had we had one I love
[01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:21.870]  hashing things out that's my one of my favorite things do but we had this
[01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:29.950]  compliant him cultivar THC V but low Delta 9 that I'd like to we kind of put
[01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:34.950]  a lot of our hemp breeding on on hold after we'll just last couple years once
[01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:40.550]  we got licensed for a nursery but basically that we should we should work
[01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:44.990]  with that a little bit because as far as I know THC V is still him compliant if
[01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:55.190]  if it tests in the threshold you guys are going to it was an 18% er what's up
[01:38:55.190 --> 01:39:03.430]  yeah yeah yeah we should all march down together yes you're going every year
[01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:12.310]  20 years almost no way so you can't say with Angela yeah mean Josh actually at
[01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:23.550]  angels camp I was one of the main stages DJ's yeah Angela and I would go there
[01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:33.410]  before we ever dated or anything like way before we decided to be a couple we
[01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:40.090]  both would party at Sarah Nevada together yeah it's a good spot and you
[01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:43.130]  know I got to say Sarah Nevada where it is especially now in Boonville just to
[01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:47.090]  anyone else listening these other readers on the panel here it's is the
[01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:51.250]  most breeders I ever met and and been in one place with in my life was at Sarah
[01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:56.170]  Nevada you know Emerald Cup could you could say now rivals that now you know
[01:39:56.170 --> 01:40:00.370]  obviously these people come from all over but as far as coming together
[01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:04.210]  without the purpose of everyone come to shop the genetics just you'd be in a
[01:40:04.210 --> 01:40:09.370]  camp and there's you know legendary breeders from Humboldt Mindo all over
[01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:14.450]  the west coast and and you know from far beyond to people come from Canada and
[01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:21.610]  it's worth checking out a lot of them are yeah yeah and it was a way I was
[01:40:21.610 --> 01:40:26.610]  able to procure like that's how we got a lot of our genetics Angela's a lot of
[01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:31.690]  hers you know she grew up in Michigan and you know most of her family still
[01:40:31.690 --> 01:40:37.650]  there and keeping strains going and stuff but then we have you know she got
[01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:42.770]  it clicked a lot of hers in Oregon I was working in Humboldt and Ray Ray got the
[01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:47.330]  river and Sarah Nevada is where we would exchange our our plants for the year
[01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:55.890]  like I would I would trade with this Ross the mondo brought for male plants
[01:40:55.890 --> 01:41:00.850]  we'd switch male plants and stuff and you know just different different people
[01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:06.330]  you come about and and from those you know Reagan music bringing us together
[01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:11.090]  we were able to you know come across just some of the greatest strains the
[01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:15.490]  world's ever seen funneling right through there and took that home we're
[01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:21.930]  living you know on the lost coast in down the you saw area basically you know
[01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:26.330]  just worked on preserving it at the time it was just a personal hobby or
[01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:30.250]  something because no one really cared about preserving genetics like that but
[01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:34.530]  you know we stoked we are we're at the spot we are now and we're we're excited
[01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:38.610]  to share it with people in other spots now that we're above ground we're
[01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:42.450]  licensed we're all this stuff's going on we really want to connect with all of
[01:41:42.450 --> 01:41:46.810]  you like I don't think I've met most of you guys and we'd love to come out or
[01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:51.490]  have you guys come out to the you know R&D farm or or whatever and help us
[01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:59.210]  help us sort through this we're always down for yeah well we don't get an
[01:41:59.210 --> 01:42:02.890]  opportunity to actually festival when we're on the west coast usually when
[01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:07.690]  we're out there we're working now one of them I know I bet clips and where you
[01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:13.370]  at now we're actually in Michigan right now so electric forest is like our
[01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:19.290]  hometown festival and we did come out to Eclipse in Oregon when the Eclipse
[01:42:19.290 --> 01:42:24.090]  happened so that was our first West Coast area festival but y'all know how
[01:42:24.090 --> 01:42:30.930]  to do it that was electric forest it looked it looks amazing it's it's
[01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:35.330]  slightly over commercialized but it's still an amazing time so you know it
[01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:40.770]  yeah it's it's actually it's amazing into the one there in Michigan yeah yeah
[01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:44.890]  they say into the forest to lose your mind and find your soul so I feel like
[01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:50.090]  every year you leave that's right piece of you there and you're waiting till the
[01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:56.450]  next year to go back so really I mean honestly I was brought into festivaling
[01:42:56.450 --> 01:43:04.630]  when I was 40 and now I wouldn't change it for anything I the actual yeah is
[01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:11.050]  amazing it's very similar to the cannabis culture yeah you always got
[01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:15.890]  some festival buddies in Angela night yeah so when you guys are going through
[01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:20.130]  your heritage genetics there's talks of how to crack your seeds and get better
[01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:24.450]  viability and some of the discussion is actually leaned towards the freezer in
[01:43:24.450 --> 01:43:30.810]  certain cases for a 24 hour to 48 hour freeze period to signify almost a winter
[01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:35.810]  coming have y'all had experience with that or have an opinion on that as
[01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:40.490]  you've been going through your older genetics I've only heard of that with
[01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:47.010]  poppy seeds you know you plant poppy seeds during a hail in the spring I've
[01:43:47.010 --> 01:43:51.730]  thought about it but I I don't know I get lyric like if I got some really rare
[01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:54.850]  old seeds I don't really like to mess with them and put them in and out of the
[01:43:54.850 --> 01:43:59.130]  freezer and stuff like that I you know I'd love for someone else on here to
[01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:03.090]  try to pop some real old seeds actually because to me it's just too fragile to
[01:44:03.090 --> 01:44:08.730]  mess with I kind of in a stasis I'm waiting for science and technology to
[01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:14.610]  pick up I'm sorry Marty what was that I thought I talked over Marty said
[01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:28.330]  scoring which is the next I have a little experience with not as much old
[01:44:28.330 --> 01:44:34.770]  seeds but a lot of heirloom or like quote-unquote land-raised heirloom stuff
[01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:40.290]  from other countries I find to be a lot more difficult to sprout in particular
[01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:49.890]  there was a low lab lemon cashmere from a raising and these were f2 so somebody
[01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:55.330]  who grew them and it was guy downtown who did like a seed reproduction in
[01:44:55.330 --> 01:45:00.410]  Maine I believe but it was still like a pure reproduction and they were very
[01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:06.850]  very tiny and I had a terrible germination rate he gave us like a
[01:45:06.850 --> 01:45:10.210]  hundred of them or something I had a terrible germination rate but I just had
[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:16.570]  this inkling to like put this put it in like the corner like outside and wouldn't
[01:45:16.570 --> 01:45:23.370]  you know like three weeks later 80% of them popped up so you say they did for a
[01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:28.370]  slow start a slow pop they were very very slow pop and they were healthy
[01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:33.010]  they were nice and dark and well to clarify to it was the guy's second
[01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:36.610]  generation like he brought in land race cross the male and females that's what
[01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:41.410]  he gave you or he gave you his first what he brought no he gave me the
[01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:46.170]  reproduction so that would be okay the f2 so they were yeah my experience that
[01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:52.650]  would be stronger yeah that'd be just poor seed production you know you think
[01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:58.210]  you know where it's to me it's where it's from you know you like where to
[01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:02.130]  come from and where do you live that's what that's what the delay was you know
[01:46:02.130 --> 01:46:05.930]  it's used to grow if it's a real land race thousands or you know let's say
[01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:10.170]  hundreds of generations most likely it's been grown in that particular soil
[01:46:10.170 --> 01:46:15.450]  climate water and now you're bringing it somewhere else you know it'd be hard to
[01:46:15.450 --> 01:46:20.810]  recreate that you know like my thought was that I noticed that the seeds fell
[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:25.890]  off very easily and so I thought it was just a variety that like it kind of wild
[01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:34.650]  sows and you know it just takes a while for the seed shell to crack open and you
[01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:37.610]  know going back to our other conversation like I saw two different
[01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:44.490]  phenotypes and one of them was extremely like wild looking very thin buds very
[01:46:44.490 --> 01:46:48.930]  small buds and that's the seeds that came out of that that I made were also
[01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:54.130]  extremely tiny seeds that looked similar to what I received and then there was
[01:46:54.130 --> 01:47:01.690]  another Dino that was slightly more quote-unquote modern looking and you
[01:47:01.690 --> 01:47:10.210]  know had bigger buds and that one the seeds looked more what we would hope for
[01:47:10.210 --> 01:47:14.290]  what we would expect what we would think a cannabis seed would look would look
[01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:20.810]  like so you know like for me like a lot of what I get out of growing these
[01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:24.530]  heirloom varieties is a lot of learning and understanding about the cannabis
[01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:29.130]  plant in general because if you're just growing a bunch of hybrids I mean the
[01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:32.690]  seeds don't usually look more similar than different you're not really seeing
[01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:37.490]  these expressions of the plant that you would see more when you're growing these
[01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:42.770]  more wild varieties like for me I was like shit this little lab lemon
[01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:48.970]  Kashmiri like is it really for smoking but could you wild so it and have that
[01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:54.010]  be a variety that could live next to like the irrigation and there's a
[01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:58.370]  Christian yeah they're diverse in compounds to those wilder varieties are
[01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:02.930]  more diverse in compounds circling back to analytics you know when we looked at
[01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:07.250]  our type threes because of the feral influence on them and I know that's why
[01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:11.890]  when we looked at them in the Israeli studies where we were able to see 153
[01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:17.450]  compounds these things have like you know 40 quantifiable terpenes and 45
[01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:21.490]  quantifiable cannabinoids plus a whole bunch of other unnamed peaks so there's
[01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:27.170]  a there's a beauty and a diversity in in that work have you on that note have you
[01:48:27.170 --> 01:48:31.610]  germinated those and this will circle back to Aaron and Ben to have you
[01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:39.850]  germinated those aqua focal gold that I sent to you yet I have not okay so so I
[01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:45.330]  that's exciting I try some of those and those are in 1975 Josh those were in
[01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:52.330]  1975 seed it was verified from an old head that we had 10 of we were able to
[01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:57.970]  get six to germinate is the narrowest preservation we've done five of them
[01:48:57.970 --> 01:49:02.690]  were females and only one male so we probably won't have the entire picture
[01:49:02.690 --> 01:49:08.330]  but we'll have some diversity from that so you know one talking about why we
[01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:12.450]  like those genetics Jamal is I think it has a lot to do with not only their
[01:49:12.450 --> 01:49:18.650]  heartiness but there's something to that compound diversity and to you know going
[01:49:18.650 --> 01:49:24.210]  back to Aaron Ben if you if anybody on here has seed cracking questions like
[01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:29.250]  I've been doing very very serious preservation work for you know 15 years
[01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:33.730]  now and I've had to come up against that scenario a number of times and to me
[01:49:33.730 --> 01:49:37.730]  that one was Jamal where we were able to produce 5,000 seeds from that and give
[01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:42.890]  them to Jamal and Peter and a whole bunch of other people here to to breed
[01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:48.570]  with openly no charge this is what we do this is how the community works you know
[01:49:48.570 --> 01:49:52.730]  but but I'm sorry I lost train of thought that that's really just the
[01:49:52.730 --> 01:50:00.170]  foundation of all of this I think is no that's awesome yeah yeah no I got we got
[01:50:00.170 --> 01:50:07.490]  questions and when I got questions about popping old trees well sorry I just say
[01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:11.090]  you know Marty you're sorry you're always trying to start old seeds to and
[01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:15.250]  stuff but yeah we'd love to have some assistance because like you said we got
[01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:21.010]  one for stalled out on yeah so some of these old seeds that I got even from
[01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:27.330]  irising like back in like 2015 when he was a high power or it was a full power
[01:50:27.330 --> 01:50:33.610]  seeds some of them were super dry and so I've done the soak I did all that and
[01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:38.170]  then I was like I gave up on them and so one thing I technique I kind of developed
[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:41.530]  from that was some of them need to be rehydrated before they can actually
[01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:46.290]  crack so that's why they take so long because some of them I've had a great
[01:50:46.290 --> 01:50:51.290]  idea you know next to well some of my left next to the window on a soaking
[01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:55.890]  paper towel and I had some in a jar and those you know those ones ended up after
[01:50:55.890 --> 01:51:00.730]  like four days of soaking in water and I had to do some with a drop of hydrogen
[01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:06.690]  peroxide and then I these ones that were in the paper towel on the window were
[01:51:06.690 --> 01:51:11.810]  soaked and then they dried out the paper towel dried out I was like oh shoot I
[01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:16.090]  ruined them so I re soaked them and lo and behold they cracked and I was like
[01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:20.370]  hmm maybe there's something about like so then what I did was like because I'm
[01:51:20.370 --> 01:51:24.250]  gonna coast so I have to you know use some kind of like dry method to make
[01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:27.850]  sure my seeds stay dry without going in the refrigerator or the freezer and
[01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:31.730]  take up a bunch of space so I keep them in a cool dark place with silica gel
[01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:37.050]  packs so I've learned that the dry dry one dry out my seeds too much and then I
[01:51:37.050 --> 01:51:42.130]  was like did it that trick again and with them and I was like no way you just
[01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:46.410]  got to rehydrate them and then they'll eventually will crack so someone will
[01:51:46.410 --> 01:51:52.250]  take longer so that is another technique that I've learned that will work you're
[01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:55.450]  not gonna get a hundred percent germination all the time because I did
[01:51:55.450 --> 01:51:59.690]  that with my Jamaican stock that I brought back I had to have like one male
[01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:05.130]  and like a bunch of females and I reopened the population after that so
[01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.730]  then I used a few males the next generation and opened it up more and
[01:52:08.730 --> 01:52:12.850]  I'm a little more comfortable with where it's at so you can reopen up the
[01:52:12.850 --> 01:52:17.410]  generation once you you know just after saving and preserving it but hey hey
[01:52:17.410 --> 01:52:21.010]  Marty I wish I knew
[01:52:22.290 --> 01:52:26.210]  hey Marty I kind of got a question for it was like for the whole group here and
[01:52:26.210 --> 01:52:29.330]  actually Jamal maybe you could help me out here I got two questions really I
[01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:33.850]  see three people fell off one was Sam I was wondering who the other two breeders
[01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:39.410]  were and then the second thing can can we get like everyone to go around just
[01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:43.530]  say I know everyone has probably a lot of land races or maybe maybe maybe not
[01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:49.010]  but is there a couple like ourselves we're trying to further a tie line and
[01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:55.050]  we're always consistently furthering our Missouri line but is there everyone say
[01:52:55.050 --> 01:53:00.610]  like a couple of their land races that they have a desire to you know keep
[01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:04.730]  going and maybe there's some assistance or some crosses we going to they just
[01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:09.170]  heard of the Acapulco gold you know Marty's talking about is Jamaican we
[01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:14.250]  actually we actually got this this Thailand right when we heard that the
[01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:18.930]  you know legal going legal in Thailand we knew there's gonna be influx of
[01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:23.010]  cookies and all these strains so we got some the most pure Thailand right we got
[01:53:23.010 --> 01:53:26.290]  and you're gonna keep that pure because I think it's gonna be a mess over there
[01:53:26.290 --> 01:53:30.130]  you know they don't there's obviously gonna be always pockets of breeders like
[01:53:30.130 --> 01:53:34.450]  us trying to preserve things but they're gonna go on that hype of like hey we
[01:53:34.450 --> 01:53:40.730]  want to be like the American big time you know cookies and all this stuff and
[01:53:40.730 --> 01:53:43.890]  and you already know like we've had people go over there and say hey it's
[01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:48.010]  all our strains over there right now this is a this extreme detriment to the
[01:53:48.010 --> 01:53:56.650]  whole cultural smokers it's hard to find it anyways it is because of what's that
[01:53:56.650 --> 01:54:01.330]  you know it's hard to find pure strain pure varieties anymore they haven't been
[01:54:01.330 --> 01:54:05.610]  influenced by modern hybrids because of things like strain hunters and other
[01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:09.530]  people like that exact I know yeah that's a whole nother subject I don't
[01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:14.730]  think we should get into that but about about those guys in particular I think
[01:54:14.730 --> 01:54:17.490]  they're a big part of the problem unfortunately I don't think they
[01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:23.170]  intended to be but here's the thing yeah yeah I mean here's the thing we just
[01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:25.850]  got to keep it all in perspective there's no way to really change the
[01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:30.610]  flow of things you know I'm I lived on it in a cabin off the grid for like 10
[01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:36.210]  years and in humble and really missed out a lot of the technology technology
[01:54:36.210 --> 01:54:41.130]  revolution and stuff and so you know wasn't it wasn't good for the progress
[01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:47.130]  but I was I was trying to be a holdout point is we got to just do our part so
[01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:53.490]  Josh I close well is there any like strains by saying that go ahead by saying
[01:54:53.490 --> 01:54:58.490]  that seeds that predate a certain year don't have that influence that's true
[01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:05.890]  and seeds hold I go 98 Baba or the 91 Kim dog things like that which the two
[01:55:06.210 --> 01:55:11.530]  strain only Eric clone only strains we hold we got that original unadulterated
[01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:17.170]  Kim dog and the the Bubba Bubba Kush 98 Bubba but so I see what you're saying
[01:55:17.170 --> 01:55:21.170]  there but what I'm more wondering about is the you know five five six of us here
[01:55:21.170 --> 01:55:29.130]  on on the thing like myself we you know Angela likes to work with the Jamaican
[01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:34.890]  and we have some Malawi like generational purebred line from a good
[01:55:34.890 --> 01:55:38.090]  friend of ours actually bid by bill he's here on YouTube you guys should
[01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:42.810]  check him out if you want some reggae influence but this guy got us the most
[01:55:42.810 --> 01:55:47.650]  pure Malawi we got our Missouri that I've been kept going pure for you know
[01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:54.010]  almost 30 years now 25 years and you know at least 30 years before that for
[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:59.490]  my elder down in humble and the other ones now this tie so we're gonna do our
[01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:02.370]  best to keep this a pure line but is there anything that you guys feel is
[01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:06.210]  real pure in your seed stock or that you have access to maybe it's not even
[01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:10.010]  yours but you know someone that had you know the aqua gold so like that and we
[01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:16.330]  can I think we need to be assisting each other to keep that going just for
[01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:19.490]  preservation because we don't know where it's gonna come in and it might not be
[01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:23.090]  your grandkids but your grandkids grandkids are all smoking this
[01:56:23.090 --> 01:56:30.290]  monocrop strain like like all our food crops I mean we could yeah I'd just like
[01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:34.010]  to hear what you guys have well what's interesting about this conversation
[01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:39.010]  topic is the land races are actually the most vital component to a natural vigor
[01:56:39.010 --> 01:56:43.610]  program and if you're not using your land races to create the the vigor for
[01:56:43.610 --> 01:56:47.890]  generations out and bringing it back you're not expressing all the variances
[01:56:47.890 --> 01:56:51.810]  in which you can move the ball forward with that genetic so it's also
[01:56:51.810 --> 01:56:56.770]  technically where a lot of us are are being told I don't know if this is true
[01:56:56.770 --> 01:57:01.170]  science or not mind you but I've been told multiple times that these genetic
[01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:04.930]  vigor programs are where we've seen the 30% increases in certain cannabinoid
[01:57:04.930 --> 01:57:09.250]  productions and you know where we've actually seen the potency level of
[01:57:09.250 --> 01:57:13.690]  cannabis go directly in a skyward position and I know that selective
[01:57:13.690 --> 01:57:17.810]  breeding can I got I got data to back that up what you're saying I got I got
[01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:22.370]  analytical and and even some DNA data to totally deck that back that up right now
[01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:27.770]  which we only came across in the last couple months but you're you're I can
[01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:35.010]  almost say you're 100% right I mean I only got limited data but yeah THC I was
[01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:40.490]  an a sayer to it I was like there's no weed that test 30% when more but maybe
[01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:45.730]  there is you know and that's what selective breeding involved with these
[01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:51.010]  bigger programs say is it a or B or is it actually see with the combination of
[01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:57.810]  the two and I believe it to be see you know you're nailing it yeah jump in with
[01:57:57.810 --> 01:58:04.410]  with the land race variety question that you had conscious cultivator please
[01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:11.610]  please thank you so yeah like when I first got into not if when I first got
[01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:17.050]  serious into breeding I was like I want to grow land race genetics that's the
[01:58:17.050 --> 01:58:26.330]  world needs and as you grow them you realize that a lot of them need a lot of
[01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:31.970]  work and yeah you're not gonna your buyers I can be asking for that again
[01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:37.010]  you know it's kind of like yeah there's a whole other part of it yeah you know
[01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:44.450]  you got it you got a sacrifice right like I want to save the world and then
[01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:51.210]  you're like my man you know you're like well maybe I can't how is every single
[01:58:51.210 --> 01:58:57.730]  person I have to be more strategic on how I'm gonna save the world and then as
[01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:04.810]  you learn how you can affect change in the world or in the cannabis gene pool
[01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:11.010]  that's kind of where I'm going where it's like a lot of these things even if
[01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:17.490]  people will smoke it when they look at it they're like and so I'm kind of it's
[01:59:17.490 --> 01:59:22.250]  like I'm right now I'm working with a work the Malawi line from hazel and
[01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:28.970]  seeds and nice it's super frosty you look at it and you're like is this the
[01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:36.970]  land race but at the same time it's like some of the phenos are a little bit wild
[01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:44.130]  but most of them are nice and so it's kind of like that's kind of where I'm
[01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:49.570]  at is like kind of bouncing between like straight you know I have like a blue
[01:59:49.570 --> 01:59:55.250]  chest and from you know I full power selection so I'm working in the blue
[01:59:55.250 --> 02:00:00.290]  chest and also and that's awesome but I'm also working the Malawi gold that
[02:00:00.290 --> 02:00:06.530]  looks nice has some frost they all have crazy melon turps and it is different
[02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:12.410]  and you know I think that we got it we got to compare notes on that because
[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:17.690]  like what yeah we're in the same sentiment here it's like yeah you know
[02:00:17.690 --> 02:00:21.530]  some it's good and like hard to believe like this land race is better than a lot
[02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:26.290]  of stuff that anyone has but you know the saying goes that my gold is the best
[02:00:26.290 --> 02:00:34.930]  weed on earth is what there's like a whole shirts and everything about it but
[02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:39.970]  you know yeah and also like for me like that smoke well and it has to do well in
[02:00:39.970 --> 02:00:45.810]  my environment so for example I've grown a whaling Valley and that's from India
[02:00:45.810 --> 02:00:53.970]  and it was it looked nice but at the end of the year there was almost a pound of
[02:00:53.970 --> 02:00:59.890]  weed that did not get smoked it just nobody smoked it and that was that to me
[02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:05.250]  was like okay well I'm not gonna grow this if nobody's gonna smoke it if I
[02:01:05.250 --> 02:01:09.330]  don't want to smoke it nobody wants to smoke it I can't give it away that's not
[02:01:09.330 --> 02:01:12.290]  something for me that doesn't mean it's not good but that's something that I'm
[02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:18.490]  not gonna choose to keep in my gene pool because it doesn't work for me and you
[02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:21.850]  know that's kind of what I've been trying to learn is like you can't save
[02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:25.970]  all of them not that they don't have value but that you have to be selective
[02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:31.050]  of what you choose to kind of adopt right do you want to adopt a crazy
[02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:37.330]  people are gonna hate crazy pit bull puppy that's bites people or you know
[02:01:37.330 --> 02:01:43.010]  maybe you do or maybe you want a little poodle or something in between well you
[02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:47.410]  know that sentiment I almost think that this holds true for any you know hunter
[02:01:47.410 --> 02:01:55.090]  actually I know it does we smoke a lot of myths you gotta try it in there and
[02:01:55.090 --> 02:01:59.090]  get it done in the second joint of the day you're saying that you're so right I
[02:01:59.090 --> 02:02:05.610]  see yeah that's true you got it I mean you don't know that on that same note
[02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:09.250]  though we're actually getting a lot of people asking us for clones like we have
[02:02:09.250 --> 02:02:14.050]  a license nursery here in Oregon they do a lot of it I'd say we're getting close
[02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:19.730]  to 50% extraction state for for you know the legal realm and sales but basically
[02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:25.090]  they you know there's guys asking we don't care if it smokes good or not we
[02:02:25.090 --> 02:02:29.530]  just need it to make good rosin you know dump good it's got to be a good dumper
[02:02:29.530 --> 02:02:35.130]  so all of a sudden and this is only you know I mean you know the rosin phase
[02:02:35.130 --> 02:02:41.370]  you've all seen it you come around and and you know only last year so have
[02:02:41.370 --> 02:02:44.090]  they been asking specifically for something you know and some of these
[02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:47.930]  strains we've been doing research on the ones that it wouldn't make our cut
[02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:51.730]  usually for reasons you said it's got to smoke well and things like that but
[02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:57.450]  it produces really high quality and high yields rosin whole different thing and
[02:02:57.450 --> 02:03:02.130]  that's really coming from our Missouri hash plant line which makes sense you
[02:03:02.130 --> 02:03:09.610]  know but when you mentioned some of the the Malawi was real wild that made me
[02:03:09.610 --> 02:03:13.330]  think what you know I don't know if they there was much of a hash production
[02:03:13.330 --> 02:03:17.810]  region in Malawi I don't I don't think so but you know maybe this or something
[02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:22.130]  else you know ailing Valley's a half producing that's the lawless Indian one
[02:03:22.130 --> 02:03:25.690]  that's why they all look funky is because they're making charas they're
[02:03:25.690 --> 02:03:28.770]  not worried about the way it looks you know some of those regions yeah that's
[02:03:28.770 --> 02:03:33.530]  what they're doing is making the charas they're not even concerned about but so
[02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:40.450]  yeah yeah for a thousand years or more they were making it for ash I don't
[02:03:40.450 --> 02:03:45.210]  remember what we sent you you just got the the Acapulco gold or if you got the
[02:03:45.210 --> 02:03:51.850]  Belvedere from Katama as well so when you talk about hash producing region
[02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:56.730]  that's an ancient hash plant those seeds are from an old family one of the like
[02:03:56.730 --> 02:04:01.850]  eight you know traditional generational families there in Katama they predate
[02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:07.470]  not only the influence all the DNA crap and all the modern Dutch crap but they
[02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:11.650]  predate a lot of the influence of the modern Afghani as well so those are a
[02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:16.810]  very good line to start working with I want to add when you guys are talking
[02:04:16.810 --> 02:04:22.010]  about Malawi's been very special for us to work with type 3 plants because we
[02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:26.690]  have and specifically globally compliant type 3 plants because it's opened up all
[02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:31.450]  these doors in other countries one of those doors is we've been working for a
[02:04:31.450 --> 02:04:36.010]  couple of years with a group in Malawi there are about five farms in Malawi I'm
[02:04:36.010 --> 02:04:40.290]  also proud to say that our type 3 plants have been grown for two years now on the
[02:04:40.290 --> 02:04:46.530]  ground in Malawi successfully but this one gentleman in Malawi right it has
[02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:52.370]  been kind enough he's a very young guy he's 26 years old gets it though and
[02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:57.490]  last year he took a sabbatical and went all around Malawi trying to find seed
[02:04:57.490 --> 02:05:02.130]  that predated any of the modern influence and wherever possible he was
[02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:07.170]  trying to find lineage of this Malawi gold and he is sending us yeah show
[02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:11.610]  different lines for us to do increases on of these pure Malawi's they've never
[02:05:11.610 --> 02:05:16.010]  been grown outside of Malawi there was no increases done there so that's
[02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:20.130]  something I'm super excited about and just like the stuff that we offered on
[02:05:20.130 --> 02:05:28.050]  FCP before the Veldia the Acapulco gold the Highland Thai and the Tora Bora all
[02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:31.850]  of that stuff you know it's the same we're gonna do with this Malawi we're
[02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:39.290]  gonna do the increases and then offer it to the community for free and that's
[02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:44.730]  awesome I do plan on growing some of your stuff Jeremy I like to sprout it
[02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:53.010]  later because they get big you know like for me one of the biggest outdoor
[02:05:53.010 --> 02:05:59.290]  mistakes that people make is they get their plants and you know perhaps I
[02:05:59.290 --> 02:06:04.010]  might even throw it back indoors for a couple weeks right at the end because
[02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:06.930]  you know they'll probably gonna need a few more weeks so that's kind of my
[02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:12.250]  technique is to like keep them on the smaller side because no matter what they
[02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:20.930]  always seem to like get big enough yeah we plant that way too now we plant
[02:06:20.930 --> 02:06:27.610]  different strains later it's it's just nicer to work with big plants that are
[02:06:27.610 --> 02:06:32.250]  overshadowing and and taking up all the time and energy of the other plants like
[02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:35.090]  sometimes you've got a big plant you got to concentrate on all the time and then
[02:06:35.090 --> 02:06:41.490]  you know hey guys let's jump in for just a sec I'm gonna lose battery here so it
[02:06:41.490 --> 02:06:48.170]  may drop off but on the land race what I've been measuring is an Afghani that
[02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:54.730]  was acquired probably between 50 and 60 years ago by my uncle and passed down
[02:06:54.730 --> 02:07:00.330]  and it's never seen any other pollen besides itself in its whole lifetime
[02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:09.530]  here on Martha's vineyard what's it like that that's amazing it is very skunky
[02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:16.650]  not too dense of flowers kind of wispy very frosty and get you high as fuck is
[02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:22.250]  the clone getting tired or is it is it a line um it's only in seed form right now
[02:07:22.610 --> 02:07:29.610]  for several years that's awesome yeah you are related to Nancy Ochoa are you
[02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:38.330]  know about 45 minutes from you right now so I'm right I'm living in outside
[02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:42.130]  south of Boston right now so if you guys ever want to link up and get some
[02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:46.370]  analytics testing I remember meeting you last year in Vegas really enjoyed it
[02:07:46.370 --> 02:07:50.930]  appreciate what you're doing and you know we're we're 3,000 miles away from
[02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:54.210]  you generally but we all need to make these links man we need to make these
[02:07:54.210 --> 02:07:58.370]  connections there's a huge culture going on all across the country right on
[02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:04.330]  heck yeah so like we I think this will have one more question that battle will
[02:08:04.330 --> 02:08:11.490]  wrap up our conversation for today my question will be what are you most
[02:08:11.490 --> 02:08:16.250]  excited about for the future whether it's like a line or just in general the
[02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:24.610]  industry yeah what are you guys most most excited about okay I'm most excited
[02:08:24.610 --> 02:08:29.850]  about the this what we started talking about early on which is this 50 state
[02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:33.410]  grow-off that we're doing with Sam right because it's the first time we're gonna
[02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:39.250]  have 500 of the same clone same generation of clone it's a diverse
[02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:42.810]  compound plant grown in all these regions so we're gonna get to see plant
[02:08:42.810 --> 02:08:48.010]  plasticity we're gonna measure 19 cannabinoids on all of those 500
[02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:53.170]  examples as well as terpenes I think we're measuring nine terpenes we're also
[02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:58.690]  gonna take a subset of those and do a deeper look and as we're all talking
[02:08:58.690 --> 02:09:03.690]  about the nose right and all the the way that we've been selecting for years I
[02:09:03.690 --> 02:09:08.090]  just get excited because I think there's a parallel happening with analytics that
[02:09:08.090 --> 02:09:12.330]  we need to wake up to and that's we've only been looking at a very small
[02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:17.090]  subset of compounds and once we start to open that up and look at more
[02:09:17.090 --> 02:09:21.770]  diversity I think we're gonna be able to kind of make these parallels now most
[02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:26.170]  people won't but everybody on this podcast will be able to we able to see
[02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:33.090]  okay it's these files these esters these ketones these flavonoids that that are
[02:09:33.090 --> 02:09:37.810]  driving us in this direction and so with for the first time with this 50 state
[02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:45.130]  grow off a subset of these plants and it's going to include the top 10 highest
[02:09:45.130 --> 02:09:52.290]  cannabinoid testers on on HPLC as well as the top we're picking 12 one from
[02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:59.050]  each region so there'll be 22 tests done total that have 350 compounds on so
[02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:02.970]  we're gonna take yeah so we're gonna take one subset of this and we're gonna
[02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:07.850]  look at everything like I said all the esters ketones thiols I think they're
[02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:13.410]  poly phenols a whole bunch of different flavonoids as well as monoincessant
[02:10:13.410 --> 02:10:18.410]  terpenoids to get a sense of that plant plasticity around the nation but I think
[02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:22.810]  it's going to be really interesting for all of the breeders to get a neat look
[02:10:22.810 --> 02:10:28.650]  at a deeper set of compounds and so I want to extend that opportunity to
[02:10:28.650 --> 02:10:35.130]  everybody the first clone is going out on the 17th we're going to continue to
[02:10:35.130 --> 02:10:39.530]  deliver clones all across the nation ship clones across the nation and
[02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:45.730]  probably until the end of June the competition ends in January so depending
[02:10:45.730 --> 02:10:49.610]  on your growing type greenhouse deprivated photo period extended
[02:10:49.610 --> 02:10:54.170]  outdoor indoor whatever it is you may be able to get a couple of runs with the
[02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.650]  clone the clone is also breeding stock that's why we're doing it we're
[02:10:58.650 --> 02:11:03.450]  literally left you know copy lefting this genetic out into the community to
[02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:07.690]  say look here's a diverse compound type 3 genetic that you guys can breed
[02:11:07.690 --> 02:11:11.770]  forward for your type twos anything if you want to breed type ones that are
[02:11:11.770 --> 02:11:17.010]  compound diverse off of it so so jump in on this thing because if you get if
[02:11:17.010 --> 02:11:20.530]  you're either one of the ten regions and those would have to be outdoor that's
[02:11:20.530 --> 02:11:25.050]  selected or if you're one of the 12 regions or if you're one of the 10
[02:11:25.050 --> 02:11:29.930]  highest testers then you'll automatically get that set of analytics
[02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:34.690]  and for all of us breeders I mean that's the next step we know there's 700
[02:11:34.690 --> 02:11:38.490]  compounds I've been able to see a hundred and fifty three of them on our
[02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:43.890]  genetics out of Israel this is the first time we're looking at 350 compounds so
[02:11:43.890 --> 02:11:47.690]  there's kind of what I'll leave it with that I'm super excited about for us all
[02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:58.440]  to have an opportunity to learn that is exciting I myself well I myself I'm
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:08.960]  excited about what the what the discovery unfolds this year and you know
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:14.120]  yeah being able to see what what comes from what we have here right on the home
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:20.840]  you know and testing and you know yeah like you know pop in all the new
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:26.800]  strains yeah we got so many new of our hybrids going and like said so those
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:32.000]  land-raised sons just to see the results of you know the further progression but
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.320]  you know I know for me it's it's for both of us it's the networking and being
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:45.040]  able to now you know it's been a few years that we've been part of the the
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:49.440]  cannabis industry instead just the cannabis community which was more hyper
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.120]  local in the past right now you're talking about yeah we were 3,000 miles
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.280]  away I am 3,000 miles away from you guys right now some of you and we're all
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:01.680]  you know to finally network and and really you know put our heads together
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.200]  and our data together you know like I'd really like to compare some of that
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:12.480]  Malawi work you guys are both doing and you know things like that helping one
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:17.160]  thing I'm excited about is being able to preserve genetics to where when certain
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:20.520]  people you know are looking for something again and this might even
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:26.920]  happen for whole countries and and you know cannabis production regions would
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:32.400]  be the whole you know they're needing something back like hey we lost our land
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.960]  race here we need that back it sounds like what you're kind of doing with your
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.240]  Malawi project there and everything I did have to ask real quick with the hip
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:45.520]  production there in Malawi is that is that open pollination going there though
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.440]  is that some of that no or is it all these are these are feminized seeds
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.640]  being used for cannabinoid production so they're either extracting depending on
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:00.120]  the farm they're either extract using it for CBD or full spectrum or a lot of them
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:06.240]  now are doing turkey extraction nice and then they just call any males or
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:11.440]  potential pollen going out or anything if they get the seed from us they don't
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:15.200]  have any enough pollen to make an influence we have like essentially our
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:21.080]  fem rates although they say 100% that's not the truth when you get the population
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:25.120]  wide enough but what we're seeing yeah one in five thousand on the high side
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.840]  one in nine thousand on the low side and really know her macrodytic potential
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:34.440]  no brack Paul and that's good yeah so we're not we're not having problems
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:39.760]  influencing other fields or other farms I this is a big part Josh for me is like
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.520]  being a craft cannabis producer getting into this is looking at the studies from
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:48.400]  like Larry smart at Cornell and understanding what pollen drift really
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.160]  does what our potential to negatively influence other crops is and then
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:59.400]  working as hard as we can to remedy and limit that oh yeah and you're close to
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:04.320]  us in Oregon right so my our ranch yes right now I'm living in Massachusetts
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.760]  but our spot in Oregon is in a funny place we're in southern Oregon on 140
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:15.320]  but not over by Medford we're like on the east side east of Klamath Falls up
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:21.480]  on the Sprague River oh nice okay yeah we're just coastal Oregon here actually
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:26.120]  well not coastal word you know hat we call it hash Hill up here in the coast
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:31.960]  range so you know just need some of that humid climate for our our breeding and
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.480]  testing but yeah we should link when you're back in Oregon sometime anytime
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:41.280]  Josh would love to yeah good thing I just all to say I appreciate meeting all
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:45.840]  you guys and and having the link like I said that's the biggest most exciting
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.800]  thing please you know feel free to come see us or have us come out and see you
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:55.240]  guys if you ever get a chance Jamal you rock dude as usual bringing everybody
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:58.400]  together like this I don't know if you know how huge of a voice for this
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:06.760]  community you've been right thank you thank you jump in um I don't have too
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:13.300]  much to say but I'm looking forward to things it's a gosh we have so many new
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:17.840]  strains that we're creating so it's just seems to take forever to go through them
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:25.800]  all so I out for us here for sure a tester you need a tester I'm over here
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.400]  I'm out of my element I don't have lots of jars of good smoke so I'm just
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:37.040]  putting it out there awesome Marty what are you excited about for the future
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:44.080]  well what am I excited about for the community or the industry or just in
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:50.160]  cannabis in general I get to see everyone and hear all the different
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:57.240]  states and all all the different kind of like hear all the different kind of
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:01.680]  aspects of what's going on with the you know out there I just kind of want to
[02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:07.720]  see everyone progress I want to see everyone stay simple I want everyone to
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:15.360]  not over you know make everything too complex for themselves and so that's
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.960]  where I kind of see hopefully see the future going is a more simple better
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:25.120]  cleaner you know cannabis that's you know not going to make growers struggle
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:32.720]  and you're so right Marty there's going to be a more variety of strain hopefully
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:37.400]  there's a more variety of strains that are gonna be more available to even the
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.680]  medicinal states that aren't legal that don't have recreational because you know
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:48.120]  they're just being passed on other varieties and then being aware of that
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:51.760]  like hey you know it doesn't the industry and come from fertilizer side
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:57.240]  is not necessarily meaning that a quality isn't from synthetics always you
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:03.360]  know so you can if you learn how to do it right but it's just trying to see
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:09.000]  that the future of cannabis going to more cleaner medicine to translate to
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.120]  extracts to edibles to you know everything and you know we've been doing
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:18.320]  our part and honestly if you're listening right now and you find
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:23.000]  interest in what we do our products check us out at sensational solutions we
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.320]  have been giving away free packs of seeds that we breed some land-raised
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:31.560]  seeds some old classics with a lot of like you know one thing people buy like
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.280]  the whole one pound thing or in which toss season and you know we have a lot
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:38.720]  of people in Virginia a lot of a lot of people in Virginia they've been getting
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:42.800]  our stuff Florida and all those things and I just like passing on those seeds
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.440]  because I'm like I'm sitting on like thousands of seeds that are bred with my
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:54.040]  fertilizers one miles miles will let them grow them with our stuff so you
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:58.040]  know that's my part of trying to help that future generation of growers is to
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:02.920]  give them a package to grow it and so hopefully they take that and and the
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:07.640]  next generation you know learns a cleaner approach and you know has some
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:11.320]  good good genetics to start with and don't have to seek out you know
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:17.480]  whatever's out there on the internet and so I just that's my thing is I want I
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:30.360]  want to see the future have more more collaborations less envy you know so
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:36.240]  that's that's what I want to see it just as a fertilizer person yeah I got a
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.640]  really second way he said about the simplicity of it all we're definitely I
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:47.000]  see most new farmers or you know grow small growers and and big you know
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:53.200]  industry people over complicating keep it simple that's what we do for success
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:20:00.200]  I'm pretty sure that's what Marty's you know focuses there keep it is as you
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:05.800]  know quality and moving forward as possible but also simplicity so thanks
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:14.400]  for saying that Marty I'd sometimes forget and cheers to that excellent
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:21.440]  have we had Ben and Aaron go I don't I don't think so I don't think so I think
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:27.360]  for us well I can say for me personally I'm very excited to be the first female
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:33.720]  breeder participating in the grow-off so it's amazing that Sam gave Ben and I the
[02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:38.840]  opportunity and that you know I'm looking forward into the future of
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:42.520]  cannabis on that personal level of changing the narrative about the
[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:47.720]  representation of women and breeding and cannabis and you know really being part
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:52.320]  of the culture and being seen on the same level as some of you guys is a real
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:57.840]  honor so you know I appreciate that as far as tank farms goes you know what
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.880]  we're excited about in the future is I think all the analytics that are coming
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:07.760]  forward that are really allowing us to you know focus on the future while
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:12.240]  preserving the past you know one thing we didn't touch on today that you know
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:16.640]  I'm really getting into that kind of speaks to Marty with sharing things is
[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:23.440]  as a pheno hunter once I find a pheno if I'm working with another breeder I'm
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:28.680]  loving tissue culture and being able to put that pheno into tissue culture and
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.720]  actually preserve it and then offering it back to the breeder to use for their
[02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:39.040]  breeder stock so that they're not just using you know the one thing that they
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:43.320]  have access to but they're using the it thing that they found that they had that
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:48.360]  you know maybe it's been five years and they're seeing a representation of
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:53.000]  something that they want to be able to you know if I had just had that thing
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.040]  but from five years ago it would be amazing to cross with this well now it's
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.640]  tissue culture we have the opportunity to start doing that and really changing
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:06.560]  the narrative about how cannabis is seen on more of a medical level instead of
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:11.760]  just this you know end-user party lifestyle but actually really putting it
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:17.400]  back to why we all got into this in the first place and I think I'm most excited
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:22.280]  for Aaron's influence on the way that we've been moving our company forward I
[02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:28.360]  started at this alone 20 years ago 20 plus years ago now and she's come on
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:31.480]  board in the last seven years and reinvigorated the way that I look at my
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:37.960]  company and the way that I now look at our position and and I misspoke mind you
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:45.560]  our company I'm thankful for it because just like what's going on now new school
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:50.600]  practices where's your mom there's no live mothers in today's market space you
[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:54.280]  talk to all the breeders who are on the market that are moving around in large
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:57.640]  volume and those guys don't even know where their genetics come from half the
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:02.080]  time yeah it's without whiskers games that we're all playing as a culture and
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:08.680]  buying into at a hundred bucks a ten pack you know and it's like to me to put
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.640]  a light on some of that and start to protect some of these of variabilities
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:20.080]  that we can then rely on creating true dominant traits rather than a semi like
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:24.520]  dominant trait from another specimen I mean we look at the old-school breeding
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.760]  habits of Amsterdam when they were working out of the Switzerland and
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:33.440]  Austrian grow houses they were all protected by live culture they had
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:39.080]  generational gapage no they had their original genetics five six seven years
[02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:43.440]  from before still functioning that they could go back and breed with and it
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:47.280]  wasn't until the EU came in and decided that they were gonna put European law as
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.000]  a whole and eradicated those greenhouses we watched years and years
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.160]  of our most stable stock disappear in a heartbeat and we've been trying to
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.160]  remember man what you're like they did that I didn't think anybody knew about
[02:24:00.160 --> 02:24:06.920]  that I was there in 97 and 98 working in Switzerland that's crazy you're the
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:13.960]  heart of our culture dude yeah big time you know all of what we've been going up
[02:24:13.960 --> 02:24:17.240]  against in the last two decades that nobody gets to talk about because we're
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:22.280]  just becoming legal so I'm thankful for all this talk this is where we really
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:26.480]  find out what's what and we're able to cement our good not just being a stone
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.720]  around a couch but a guy with a microscope you know that's an
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:33.200]  incredible story you just brought up Aaron that most people don't know that
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:36.920]  we had this really unique opportunity over there for a couple of years and we
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.120]  were moving and we were banging and then you say is the EU I would go further and
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:45.800]  say it was pressure from the US government the global drug police that
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.520]  put the pressure on the EU to put the pressure on Switzerland to close that
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:55.720]  shit down and that yeah set us back a long way you're correct that's yeah I
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.800]  didn't realize that's how it went down because you know we're Angela and I we
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:05.600]  preserve still the same clones like we can't have massive bank of clone only
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:10.640]  still even some from 96 and 98 the orange blossom the juicy fruit things
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:15.320]  like that the Missouri but also inbreeding the line just like you you
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.840]  know I don't realize other people were doing it quite that way but if we were
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:26.200]  to lose those you know mothers from you know like 15 20 year old mothers it
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:29.240]  would really put a detriment into the progress we're doing the way we do
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:35.400]  things the other thing though I said Angela had to walk away Aaron but as a
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.760]  Michigan girl Michigan girl herself and and you know she had to run away take on
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.240]  her plants but she would love to collaborate on a breeding project with
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.520]  you we were talking about it before maybe mentioned it to Sam or something
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:53.120]  but you know two Michigan girls being successful in the cannabis market
[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:57.120]  working together on collaborating some strains she'd love that she's real picky
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.320]  about who she works with but she already mentioned you and just had to step away
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:09.320]  well I know she elevated my game times a thousand so did he just he just jumped
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:13.200]  out I don't know if that was an accident
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:22.920]  huh all right well I'll wrap her up I want to thank you guys for coming on I
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:29.040]  thought it was an excellent show I normally do shows with one other person
[02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:33.920]  honestly I was a little apprehensive having so many people come on but I
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:38.880]  thought that we we shared time really well and had an excellent show I was not
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:45.920]  able to follow the chat too well trying to focus on the conversation the thing
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:49.960]  that I'm the most excited about in the cannabis community is the normalization
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:54.720]  of cannabis and what I would call the professionalization of cannabis so a
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  story I was out with my wife and all of her work friends who are all professional
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:07.040]  people highly professionals and they go to ask me oh what do you do for a living
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:13.920]  I'm like well actually I breathe cannabis and they said oh that's
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:20.280]  extremely interesting please tell me more and I'm used to people being like
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:27.520]  oh you're basically a pothead trap artist you know and it's like no you
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:34.560]  know like we're just normal people who are just in the plants and to a lot of
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:39.800]  people it's a normal thing and I'm really excited for me to feel that it's
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:44.240]  a normal thing because I mean we're just people who like plants I mean I like
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:48.720]  Sal you know I also like collecting salvia plants also like collecting
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:55.280]  lupins and you know I mean it's like we're just plant people we're not like
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:03.960]  crazy druggy whatever I mean we might be but you know it's like so like to me
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:08.040]  that's that's what's exciting is that we can we can meet on a professional level
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:15.880]  as plant people and you know that this is our profession and that's that's nice
[02:28:15.880 --> 02:28:20.160]  because that you know we can learn from each other as professionals and you know
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:25.720]  I will say like speaking with you Jeremy it always really inspires me and I can
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:30.600]  see the education that you put into this field and just hearing you talk about
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:36.720]  things and hearing the vocabulary that you put out I'm just like okay no taking
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:41.080]  here there there there are even better words that can be used to describe what
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.240]  you're trying to do and that you can continuously put your game to the next
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:50.760]  level and when you work with the right people they respect you in that they you
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:55.800]  by surrounding yourself with others of a certain level it raises you by just
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.600]  being part of that conversation yeah brother don't underestimate the value of
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:03.400]  the nomenclature we use to move this forward and normalize things you know
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:08.760]  and I don't ever mean to speak above anybody but there's a very purposeful
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:13.320]  moment right there when I'm using those words to say look we want we want that
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:18.200]  normalization that you're talking about and look we've driven an industry long
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:24.080]  before you were here messing with it in a very intelligent and efficient way and
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:28.280]  really you've kind of train wrecked it now so if you need me to learn the
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:32.640]  nomenclature that's that speaks to you and resonates with you will learn that
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:37.280]  so I appreciate you saying that because I never mean to sound lofty or like I
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:41.160]  think I'm smarter than anybody I'm a super humble guy I serve it to did the
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:46.480]  plant all my life no and I would say in also the other guests as well you know
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:52.320]  like by hearing the different takes on things it increases my own breeding tech
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:58.680]  as well because I'm like oh okay you know Aaron and Ben you know you guys you
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:01.640]  know some of the things you guys are talking about like multiple terpenes and
[02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:06.120]  like the different terpene stacking yeah I was like oh yeah I know exactly about
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:09.960]  that because you know what in my opinion OG kush is the perfect terpene stacker
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:14.600]  because it's like you get the gas and then you get some fruit and then you get
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.640]  something else in the end and the back end is almost like the most important
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:25.200]  part because it's like if it lingers and it's all ashy you're like you know but
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:29.920]  like you know those are those are totally things please please jump in if
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.320]  you guys are interested I highly recommend you Google terpene temperature
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:39.480]  chart look at images there's a thermometer that basically will specify
[02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:43.720]  the degree in which these terpene traits burn off at it'll help you
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:47.160]  prospectively not only gauge what you're experiencing but it'll also show you
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:52.040]  that there is a weird peak that shows up when you start to experience terpenes
[02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:55.400]  goes from the coolest terpene temperature to the hottest terpene
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:59.120]  temperature and then back to the coolest and what is really cool about this is
[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:03.280]  you'll acknowledge yes that's the first and last thing I tasted and all of a
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:08.480]  sudden you'll understand what you're experiencing awesome so yeah thank you
[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:14.320]  guys for for coming on and you know we'll probably need to have some
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:17.280]  follow-up conversations with all of these things because I mean this is
[02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:22.080]  really the meat and potatoes of it so yeah thank you guys and hope everybody
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:25.440]  has a nice Saturday
[02:31:27.080 --> 02:31:32.320]  appreciate what you all do very true
