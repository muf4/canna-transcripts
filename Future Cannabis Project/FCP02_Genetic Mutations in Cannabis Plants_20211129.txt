pieces which is the only time that I ever use a mask. I'm running low on stuff.
Alright so we're live now so Ryan if you want to kick it off. Ryan may take a
second I know he's trying to get in contact with a special guest to come on
up. Trevor you can freestyle on this topic. Cool yeah so I think we're gonna
be talking generally about mutations today. There's a lot a lot of different
avenues we can take in this discussion. There's a recent paper that's been
shared around that talks about genetic mosaicism in cannabis and
it's specifically about the accumulation of mutations in the plant.
They're called soma clonal mutations and so essentially the term that we used for
years was genetic drift and we talked about how a clone may change over time
from the mother plant and this was termed in the cannabis community
genetic drift. That's not the actual technical term. The technical term is
genetic mosaicism and so we can go down that Avenue. We can talk about also
different germline mutations that are heritable mutations. I hope we can bring
on high-grade mutations, canna research and talk about the freak show. I reached
out to him earlier today. Seems like he's down to come on. So yeah we can talk
about a lot of different things. Some other people brought some comments up in
my on my page about both the variation that you get in the mutations that you
see in tissue culture which is a discussion that hopefully we can get
some experts to weigh in on and also sexual mosaicism. Essentially like
mosaics in the chromosomes of plants and talking about that subject. So lots of
different stuff to go on today. Welcome Christian. Yeah so Christian if
you don't know is the author of that paper. That's incredible. I found him on
Twitter and he's kindly agreed to pop in and be part of this conversation. So
that's pretty cool. Welcome Christian. Hello. We can hear you. Okay sorry. I'm messing with headsets and
headphones and whatnot. Hi guys yeah thanks for bringing me on and it's my
pleasure to be here. I'm excited to talk about you know mutations and cannabis. If
anyone has any questions or anything feel free. Well yeah just for starters
for anybody in the audience who and we're both here in Clubhouse and on
YouTube. So could you give us some background just on the specifics on the
paper that you published and some of the the ideas that are involved because I
know that in the cannabis community we used to use the term genetic drift to
refer to this phenomena and finding your paper really helped to put a term and
the label to a phenomena that we had kind of observed and talked about but
not necessarily had the language to describe. Yeah and maybe you can tell us
a bit about yourself too Christian and where you're working or studying and all
that kind of stuff. That'd be great. Yeah would be nice to have a little intro. Yeah so
essentially my name is Christian Adamic. I am a PhD student at the University of
Guelph. I'm currently doing my PhD on mutations and cannabis essentially. So my
first like phase of my PhD has now like been fully completed and the paper has
been fully published and everything. That was last Monday. So it's called
accumulation of stomatic mutations leads to genetic mosaic ism in cannabis.
So to kind of summarize that a little bit and make it a little bit more easy to
understand. So I guess I'll kind of bring it back to where like where we started
with this project because plants having mutations is nothing new. It's you know
it's something we've known forever and it's where we've gotten a lot of stuff
like apples or grapefruits like different varieties of different fruits
and stuff that actually came from mutations. So something we actually know
it exists and like one of the big reasons why this kind of occurs and why
there's you know variety within a single plant is as a plant grows each like
branch it kind of like separates is like a mare stem either the mare stem or
branch mare stem and essentially each one of those mare stems can accumulate a
different amount of mutations like and as that branch grows on it can keep like
potentially having errors and then you know issues that cause the mutations or
just random chance it's also spontaneous. So we knew that already existed
essentially no one really looked into cannabis however like you guys are
saying you guys have this term genetic drift for what you guys have been seeing
because this has been going on in the cannabis industry and breeders have been
talking about it for a very very long time. So it's essentially you know what's
going on with your plants when you start seeing you know the traits kind of start
to deteriorate your clones are starting to become weaker not as strong like you
know the term we use is a vigor it's like the plant health and then on top of
that potentially like cannabinoid levels were also decreasing. So something
that's been known in the industry for a very very long time so essentially my
lab and my advisor we just kind of came up with the idea like we know mutations
occur in other plants and this genetic mosaic is occurs other plants so no
research has been done in cannabis and it kind of gives an opening into
explanation of what you know breeders have been seeing for so so so many years.
So and like another interesting part of this is that you know it's kind of
shining light onto like the term you know genetic drift but I'd like to also
like bring in the fact that like mutations are just one aspect of the
large picture. The other area is like epigenetics for anyone who doesn't know
that it's essentially like alterations to the DNA without actually like fully
altering it's like little changes can occur within the DNA that doesn't
actually fully alter it but can alter the expression and stuff like that so
that could actually have an also an effect on things like your plant vigor
and your cannabinoid levels and then lastly there's also the whole world of
viruses and viroids and pathogens that you know the cannabis world is
still discovering still finding out so yeah it's a little bit of rundown any
other questions feel free I hope I didn't talk too much time or anything. No
no listen there's no time limit on this we're gonna be going for until we're
done. Don't worry about it thanks for coming on and sharing your perspective I
just I want to ask I think that we should probably stop using the word
genetic drift I mean we all know that it's wrong so let's not use it yeah we
can get into what genetic drift actually means later I just want to
throw a couple other points that I mean I've been breeding cannabis for 30 plus
years I've grown a fair amount of mother plants and had you know a lot of plants
hang around for a long time and I actually haven't noticed this that much
so I mean obviously there's mutations can be silent mutations of their you
know they're occurring in a like a section of the DNA that's not
responsible for a coding region or a promoter or anything like that but I
actually haven't noticed I mean I've done a lot of lab testing I actually
haven't noticed these vast changes to the same degree that it's talked about
in the community so I also wanted to just bring up the point too I think that
you only used one at one genotype right Christian is that correct yeah it's the
challenging issue with the research in time we'd love to have done more the big
thing interesting with my research too was the degree of sequencing that we did
like the depth of coverage which was greater than 50x which is really really
really precise on like what we were finding and what we were seeing we were
very confident with the results as the sequencing was just deep deep essentially
so yeah it's one genotype but it's essentially the big thing we were looking
at is like first phase was looking at intro plan just like one single species
right and again each we did three samples like a top middle and bottom
sample and each one of these samples were like over I think like somewhere in
the range of $1,000 per sequence for each one of those samples so it starts
getting real expensive real quick as you start trying to add more and as I'm only
like a PhD student I don't have that infinite kind of timeline and education
and like in the in the world so I'm trying to like you know finish within my
timeline so ideally we would have done more but time and money is usually a
huge issue with research oh absolutely I'm a researcher too I just kind of
wanted to raise it as context because you know I think all species have I
don't know there's any species that don't but all species that I know of you
know there's like a natural mutation rate that happens through cell division
and that's you know that's kind of understood you can look it up online
just Google like you know eukaryotic cells mutation rate and because you know
we do have these DNA checkpoints in these DNA repair mechanisms that are
part of the cell they're actually part of the genome those those repair
mechanisms are actually coded for in genes themselves so what you know I my
because it's an n of one the question became to me how prevalent is this
really in the species and obviously we don't know that but I you know I had the
you know cannabis as we keep saying every week cannabis is an obligate
outcrosser and so that typically obligate outcrossers they compile
genetic mutations I mean there's no real selective pressure against them and so
we kind of accumulate these genetic mutations throughout the genome and
that's to be expected and you know so my thought went to because this again
because this is an n of one is it possible that this plant or this line
that the plant was taken from has you know genetic defects like mutations in
those DNA repair mechanisms right it would be really interesting if we could
somehow put a scale to this right and kind of calibrate how often does this
actually happen in the cannabis genome yeah well I think like again like this
kind of breaks down to like like my literature review like all the research
I did before looking into this like we know this phenomenon exists within
plants right that they're spontaneous mutations can occur and because each
branch is technically like independent of each other they can each independently
accumulate different amounts of mutations and they can have different
effects whether like one branch might have a beneficial mutation which has
been seen and stuff like grapefruit where so we got actually pink
grapefruits came from a single branch from pink or from a white grapefruit
tree so this phenomenon's been going on ever interesting thing was also is like
because mostly cannabis is done with the vegetative propagation which is like
taking clones from a mother plant we've eliminated that sexual recombination
that is really really essential for you know down regulating and controlling
like deleterious like mutations that can have negative effects so like there's a
situations where mother plants can you know be kept for 10 years or something
and usually from what I understand is around like the two-year mark they'll
actually breeders will take a clone of their own mother plant and then regrow
it up and start taking clones from that as like kind of a rejuvenation kind of
technique but with doing that you know if you're doing 10 years of constantly
kind of doing that technique there has to be an accumulation of mutations and
it's eventually a matter of time before that has a negative effect obviously
mutations are very very low and like the chances of actually affecting anything
are obviously low but if you're looking at a mother plant for 10 years and you
constantly are taking it and you're not allowing you know recombination to a fit
like fix you know recessive genes and genes that could have negative effects
so then get into an interesting situation on and like a big thing too is
like I'm not saying like this is some mayday like crisis that everyone should
panic about this is you know I'm just more kind of like this exists this is
something to like acknowledge and kind of you know respect in a sense right and
like another practical end of like my research was like kind of promoting a
best practice if you are to be renewing your mother plants or if you're taking
like very very small amount of cuttings is it's looking like there's higher
mutations at like the very top like the apical section so if you were to do that
renewing or you're taking low amounts of clones that may be like a basal section
like I just started something like somewhere in the lower to mid region
would potentially give you a clone that has less accumulated mutations is the
theory of course like you said this is one genotype in my paper I stay like
this this is only like you know preliminary kind of almost like in fact
like my second phase was to be actually expanding on this and actually looking
at generational like apical exclusive and basal exclusive clones and then
looking at the sequencing and the mutation loads after around five
generations unfortunately the company that I was working with for my first
phase of project kind of they shift gears and essentially change their
entire business project and plan so I've actually moved into tissue culture and I
think someone was talking about tissue culture and hopefully we could speak
about it later in the talk and yeah I definitely work with some tissue culture
now and I actually shifted a lot of my projects and like my different phases
into tissue culture so yeah very cool listen man it's it's definitely a
valuable contribution to the the scientific understanding of the plant
and you know these new papers they they are just opening up a new region right
for for something for us to pay attention to as we're going about doing
our business so it's it's very cool thank you appreciate that yeah no I
definitely agree with that and just the way that like I said earlier and I agree
with Ryan we can shift away from the incorrect vernacular and move to
actually correct scientific nomenclature here and so that's that's a great
contribution in itself and I think that this kind of points itself towards and I
believe you indicate and mention as much about some of the limitations in the
paper with it being a single cultivar but it would be great to see replication
trials and demonstrating this in other cultivars other environments and across
environments seeing what different variables might play into it and to that
I know there's in the paper it talks to some of the regions where these
mutations accumulate and that you looked specifically at cannabinoid and terpene
pathways synthase genes could you speak to some of that and I noticed you you
indicate in the paper that there aren't major impacts but that there are there's
at least proximity between some of these somatic mutations and these synthase
genes yeah great questions and again thank you for appreciating my work that
means a lot to me so yeah essentially we did we looked at the two pathways
cannabinoid and terpene pathways and essentially we use bioinformatics which
is using programs and whatnot on the computer to analyze and so essentially
we looked at like a region like break it down first we did the entire genome
where we kind of looked at the entire genome and saw how many mutations we
accounted for and kind of got like an average of across the whole genome and
then what we did is we went down to where the gene we found where the genes
were located and we took like essentially a section of I think it was
like around five or ten thousand base pairs before and after the gene because
essentially mutations in regions before like mutations don't have to necessarily
be right in the gene to actually have an effect there's promoter regions and
regions that actually have an effect on me the gene that aren't actually
necessarily on it so so we looked at like a wider kind of picture and then
like you said yeah we didn't find anything that was categorized as a high
impact mutation which would mean essentially that like a full stop code
on kind of deal where just completely ceases the function of the gene so none
of that was found however we did find essentially four genes that were over
double than what that average across the whole entire genome was and again it's
kind of just mostly not nothing huge but mostly to just kind of shine light that
there are mutations that are occurring occurring there or near there and they
need to be acknowledged that eventually enough of them could have an impact
right so well we didn't find anything again it's kind of acknowledging
acknowledging that you know they're there and that they can do something
interestingly to was it was I think CBD yes and then oh well s both of those
which are major major major enzymes and pathways for the for any THC or CBD or
CBG or whatever so it's really interesting to see you specifically that
like one again like it didn't mean anything and all the mutations didn't
have any sort of effect the ones that I found but they were there so I guess I
like you know that's that's kind of the big takeaway from that oh well that's
for people that don't know is I think I believe it's a little like acid
the short form for it and then CBD acid CBD acid synthase so a little like acid
is one of the precursors not only for terpenes but also for for cannabinoids
and CBD synthase of course is the gene that's responsible for the conversion of
CBG into CBD so those are some pretty important some pretty important traits
there for sure and I wonder I know some of the limitations of the study may
preclude this but was there any were you able to ascertain any of the underlying
variables that could influence the expression of these somatic mutations
for instance you know light type soil pests it's pathogens etc I mean like I
necessarily didn't identify anything like the potential causes but I mean
like you said all of the above could have potentially had effect there's so
much that kind of goes on with the whole world of mutations and what can be
causing effect that's makes it really challenging as like you know I'm trying
to look at one specific kind of area or something but there's you know five
other things influencing it and that just becomes a mess to like try to
pinpoint what is causing what and how much of an impact it's causing I know my
University of Guelph we just recently got a phytotron to essentially start
growing full-grown plants at the facility and I know we have some sort of
plans to eventually bring cannabis plants into like growth chambers like
here at the University of Guelph we have like some high-tech growth chambers that
you can adjust almost everything within them from your co2 levels lights
amounts quality the different light colors like etc etc so that'll be really
cool to be able to kind of bring it into a much much more controlled environment
and start kind of picking an impart what's going on and what's affecting
what and you know in what potential way so it's interesting but yeah in my
research we can't really say or pinpoint exactly what could have caused
and at the end of the day like there might not even been any sort of cause
right this could have just been a spontaneous kind of mutations that are
occurring as that does happen you know your DNA repair mechanisms can sometimes
make it like errors and mistakes so so it could have just been spontaneous as
well so I can't really comment on an exact cause of it but there's many it
would suggest there's a cause though I mean they're all localized if it was
more random you'd think that it would be you know live that mutation rate would
be a lot more consistent across the plant but again depending on how many
samples you took I mean it's like you said it's hard to tease that kind of
stuff out we you know you know my first thought was you know we know that the
Sun can actually cause DNA mutations right UV causes mutations in in DNA so I
realized this was indoor and you're set up but you know that that's one
potential explanation do you know if they had they were running an IPM
program or like were they spraying their plants at all um yeah occasionally like
neem oil mother plants weren't too much like of a concern they were just you
know basic maintenance they're kept like in their own room and their own space
and stuff so basic maintenance nothing special from what I know just like you
know your standard kind of procedures and care and whatnot so yeah yeah I know
a lot of I mean there are a list of approved pesticides that you can or
pesticides and fungicides that you can spray in can in the Canadian system if
someone's asking in chat if you said meanwhile I don't think you actually can
use neem oil in the Canadian I can't remember exactly I wasn't doing the
spraying and stuff I just know there was I sometimes and I don't even think the
mother plants were really sprayed from my knowledge so but yeah well they
probably probably work I'm sure that they do preventative spraying for
yeah but yeah I mean people are some people are saying in the chat you know
potentially that it was mean the jet mutagenic keep in mind to like you we
could be spraying stuff on the plant and some of these you know like I said these
these DNA repair mechanisms and stuff they're also gene based products so when
a gene is made that becomes a protein that has an effect in the plant
sometimes you know maybe a spray is interacting with that protein and it's
inhibiting its ability to do whatever right it's it's ability to do its DNA
repair so there's like a lot of potential cons not confounds in the
experiment per se but there's still a lot that we really need to learn I think
we're talking about good practices I did say on one of these chats about a month
ago or so maybe a little bit longer we were talking about preserving a line and
I also said essentially the same thing that you said earlier Christian about
taking clones from lower parts of the plant and my rationale before seeing
your paper was just that you know the lower part of the plant those more like
bottom kind of cuts they really do grow much slower so they're undergoing less
cell divisions right I don't know people a lot of people are probably looking at
the big top goal as always but you know after years and years and years of
growing and cutting plants down you can see that there's these little shoots at
the bottom or where they're getting low light especially in low light gardens
that they really don't grow at the bottom down there and you know that
might be a good thing if you're taking cuts at least if you're taking cuts to
start new moms I would probably be suggesting that people be doing that and
you know we've also mentioned cryo a few times in this whole thing it's kind of
hard to predict what cultivar is going to become you know the next chem dog for
example but it probably is not a bad idea to be taking marist ems and putting
them into cryo pretty early on in their in their life I mean obviously there's
gonna be some epigenetic changes likely when plants come out of cryo but it is a
way to store plants without any cell division so you're not gonna have any
any change right any any DNA mutations during that phase so keeping a bank of
frozen plant for a story of marist ems from from from like you know any given
plants say you have like you know if you could put like a hundred marist ems into
cryo you could take those out ten of the time over like a couple of decades right
and essentially just keep reseeding the cultivar from it's like more juvenile
tissue say but yeah I mean it's it's really an interesting technique because
I can see people doing this as we go about studying things like cryo right so
that we can actually get an idea of genetic stability and even through
tissue culture processes I mean you know there's other ways to look at mutation
rates but deep sequencing is definitely the best way yeah tissue culture is
definitely a cool world I've really grown to respect now that I'm working
kind of more closely with it and so cryo cryo preservation I know my advisor he's
actually currently kind of looking into that within cannabis and kind of seeing
all the effects and the potential of it because I know I know he's pretty
advocate about using it to preserve genetics and and something that we need
to jump on to is start preserving genetics start making gene banks and
start really promoting and pushing and sharing because we haven't been able to
for so long now that we can we should definitely do as much as we can now but
tissue culture is really cool it's got its pros and cons from what I can tell
and from my early research it's like seeming like when you put a plant into
tissue culture its mutation rate is gonna kind of skyrocket potentially it
seems that like just the environment and everything of it is causing plants to
have a much higher mutation load obviously this is other species not
nothing's been studied in cannabis but from previous plant species it's looking
like you know you got to increase mutation loads but I mean there's pros
and cons with those another like benefit of though I mean of tissue culture is
what a lot of people have seen is when they bring their plants in and then
bring them back out when they bring the plants back out the plant exhibits like
juvenile traits where it essentially have like let's say three leaflets
instead of your regular five or seven or stuff and it'll grow quicker and faster
essentially it seems that there's some sort of epigenetic effect of putting a
plant into tissue culture and then bringing it back out and it can have
some sort of like rejuvenated kind of health and growth so and that's that's
been used in other species a lot so also an interesting thing I forgot to
mention too like you said mostly my research is kind of recommending for
taking clones for a new mother plants from kind of more more middle to basil
kind of area depending on how you kind of deal with your mother plants because
I know in the picture if you've read my paper you can see that it's mostly kind
of trimmed at the bottom and it's just kind of a preference for certain
breeders with their mother plants so so that's a kind of a factor essentially
the best spot would be somewhere that isn't too affected where hasn't been
pruned too much or like you know clones have been taken too much and then sorry
yeah another point that I want to mention was the fact that cannabis is an
annual plant it's it's genetically and naturally supposed to live for one you
know one year around one year one season it's supposed to grow flower and produce
seeds and die so with mother plants we're keeping these plants for up to ten
years and we don't really have a very good idea on what's that gonna do to
essentially the mutations and then as we were talking like DNA repair mechanisms
those only start to like become worse and worse as we age actually a really
interesting paper I read about super century Arians essentially people over
100 years old they did a next study where they essentially sequenced like a
bunch of these very very old people and they found that they had essentially
like a higher expressed DNA repair gene expression so so that kind of goes like
you know kind of you can see as the DNA repair mechanism you know gets worse
you're more likely to get mutations so it's kind of a concern when you're
looking at you know mother plants that are kept on years after years after
years because there is the whole world of perennial and annual and early
research and current research is looking like there might be a mechanism for you
know large trees to actually deal with their mutations while annual species
don't really have per se mechanism we don't really know what it is but we
theorize it exists essentially so you know an annual like why would it put
investment into preventing mutations over a long term if it's only supposed
to live for a year correct so so when you look at a perennial that lives for
longer it makes sense that it doesn't you know accumulate as much per
generation than per se an annual so those two little kind of interesting
points forgot to mention that is a good point and I see Tony just dropped off
but he's he points that out Tony Boneyard he's a regular here on the
breeders roundtable and when he read your paper and explains it to people
that's something that he always points out is that we've taken an annual plant
and put it into a perennial life cycle that isn't normal so that's a really
good explanation of the underlying you know differences between species and
explanation for why they may have different you know expend energy or
genetic material towards those types of different ways of modulating mutations
sorry to jump in Ryan if you had something to to go on there
yeah I've never apologized for jumping in man it's it's definitely an
interesting thing I don't I mean I don't know if I buy it to be perfectly honest
look DNA mutations changes in DNA are the raw materials upon which evolution
happens right I mean we're just talking in chat someone was saying that there's
no there's no positive mutations usually when you see mutations are not usually
positive that's true to a degree I think a good example to think about that in
the context of you know the world that we're living in today is this virus that
we're all seeing run around the world when when mutations happen and mutations
like are much more prevalent or more likely to happen in an RNA based
organism like the coronavirus they're just more frequent and so these
mutations you know one of the first like when you have when you have a genetic
code what genetics codes genetic the genetic code is essentially a recipe for
making proteins so DNA I don't explain this without getting too deep DNA DNA
essentially makes a template for amino acids to come together in in a recipe to
make a specific protein and there's a little bit of wiggle room in the genetic
code so like you can have a genetic mutation that occurs if it's if we're
talking about a snip or a single nucleotide mutation like a base pair
substitution or something like that that doesn't necessarily mean that the that
mutation causes a change in the protein because again there's this redundancy in
the code where like you can have two spellings of a genetic word essentially
mean the same thing in the in the language of you know of codons being
transcribed into and into proteins right and so when if a mutation does happen
that causes a change it's usually a loss of function but that mutation doesn't go
anywhere right and so over time and we've actually seen this through the
sequencing that's been done on some of the you know there was some work done by
a group over in Europe where they essentially looked at THC acid synthase
over a like a series of populations and you can see that like there's mutations
that pop up spontaneously or they build upon each other and you know for example
I think Kevin McKernan showed quite early that it's likely that the THC
acid synthase evolved from a CBD acid synthase right and it just happened
because again we know these things have like if you look at those two molecules
side-by-side they're almost identical it's really just a slight different in
the way that those those molecules are simply or the synthase works either
closes one of the rings or not but anyway the point is that over time these
mutations can pile up and eventually that might evolve into some new trait
right like it did with THC so just to point out like mutations aren't always
bad they are like I said again before like they are the raw material upon
which Mother Nature selects new traits and it's part of nature and you know
there's all sorts of mutations right we have this this word in genetics we call
indels but essentially it means there's like you know we can have a DNA like a
an a change to a T or a C change to a G in the genetic code and that's a point
mutation or a single nucleotide polymorphism is usually what arises out
of that but there's also all sorts of different types of mutations that can
happen we can have like you know little chunks of DNA where like a word drops
out of a genetic sentence for example that's called a deletion you can have an
insertion where there's like a double copy you know and there's a problem in
the in the synthesis of the DNA and it kind of makes a little stutter and you
might have you know whereas like it should say CTG it'll say CTG CTG right
so that's called an insertion and there's all these anyway there's all
these different types of mutations that can happen and they lead to genetic
changes I mean we know for sure that we have transposons are active in the
cannabis genome so transposons are what's what's known as jumping genes
people can go and look up Barbara McClintock and she she figured out that
there is the retro transposons or what she called jumping genes back in the day
and and they act through these little pieces of like they're little they're
kind of like viruses they're like little DNA viruses that they hop into a
genome and they cause havoc and then they hop out of that chromosome and they
might go and join another chromosome and so the you know these things when that
when they hop in and out they leave little mistakes or they can hop in and
break a gene or they can jump out of the gene like it's you know I think it's an
important thing to understand because you know when we start talking about
more complex things like CRISPR people get all bent out of shape and start
talking about playing God and you know we're changing the genome or we're
changing the plant those things are true but the what is also true is that the
genome is in flux it's not fixed right and I think that this paper really even
shows that it's not only like it's not only the genome is not only constantly
changing in the species it's also changing in a given plant right and so
when we use tools like CRISPR to go in and very accurately change the spelling
of a genetic word or we remove a genetic word or add a new one in it's important
for people to realize that like these mutational processes are always
happening in the genome right so it's really we're really not doing anything
that's that's really not already happening we're just doing it in a much
more precise way and you know everybody knows you know we I think good you know
people have been talking about in the chat I mean we have these plants like
freak show and the Australian bastard cannabis the ABC or what hives now
calling the subterfuge those are those leaf variants those you know what what
people call you know quote-unquote mutants kind of like in the you know the
comic book X-Men kind of way we talk about a mutant as being oh look there's
some right there we talk about a mutant be you know being like this phenotypic
trait but really that phenotypic trait is the result of a genetic mutation so
it's a change in the DNA code that leads to a physical representation in the
trait and we can see those ones that appear in like you know the crucial
genes for the development of leaves because they're quite easy to see you
know the freak show it's you know the the lamina are all serrated the bastard
cannabis which is now on the screen in the in the YouTube channel that's also a
mutation in a key gene involved in the formation leaf or the the appearance of
the leaf but those things are really you know at the at the core it's it's
that there's a genetic mutation that's going on in those plants and and they
can happen so there's the bastard again on the screen it's really a bizarre
little plant I mean they essentially appear to lack serrations on the leaves
right but I think the theory should hold true and I've been trying to beat this
drum for the last few weeks just to really make the make the point stand but
like we have to understand that there's in the in the cannabis population as a
whole or the cannabis gene pool as a whole there's gonna we're gonna be able
to find mutations in every gene on the chrome in the genome right every gene on
every chromosome it's just what do those mutations do and we haven't done you
know again through prohibition we haven't done a great job in cataloging
those things I think that with the advent of you know the new next
generation sequencing and just more folks like Christian being able to work
in I mean look he's a Canadian PhD student at a university working on
cannabis and growing cannabis it seems bizarre to people in the States I'm sure
but this is what happens when legalization happens right we get access
to all the systems and we're gonna start learning cool things and I you
know when you guys get legalization down south as well I mean I see it really
taken off as well I mean you know Guelph is an incredible school it's kind of
like our you know our big ag University in Canada I would say it's somewhat akin
to Davis UC Davis but yeah it's like I'm I just I love when like Christian
are able to contribute stuff to this plant because they're doing their you
know their university degrees it's it's to me it's really cool because I you
know I tried to get my university to grow cannabis 20 years ago and they
definitely didn't want to have anything to do with it at the time so it's it's
really quite quite cool to see this the world changing and you know you guys
being able to contribute to the cannabis world yeah my pleasure and again thank
you for you know such humble and kind words and you know I'm so glad to
contribute and give back to this community as well I know it's a very
strong and tight kind of community and you know breeding community cannabis
have been sharing all their secrets and all their little knowledge with each
other and it's it's cool to see it kind of shine like in the light it kind of
more and then be more you know mainstream almost and you know not so
unknown and hidden anymore kind of deal which is really nice I also want to
share it on just like mentioned you did a great job kind of explaining mutations
kind of where they come from what they do you know good or bad kind of deal
you did a great job on that Ryan but yeah again essentially just kind of just
to elaborate a bit more like mutations are the basis of all pretty much
evolution back before you know we had gene editing or anything plants were
mutating by themselves and competing with themselves essentially in these
mutations where you know they compete with each other and whichever performed
better if it was a beneficial mutation would be carried on or through its
population however if there was a duality or tier it's like a mutation that
causes you know a negative effect it would probably die out in the population
and be kind of non-existent so like that's been going on since plants have
existed kind of deal like mutations have been occurring and plants have been
you know selecting or breeding with like the beneficial ones the ones that are
you know give them some sort of advantage compared to the other ones so
this is mutations you know causing some sort of phenotypic changes has been
going on as long as history knows so so that's something to acknowledge also as
well most mutations are bad yeah there's no denying that it's a lot easier
essentially to knock out a function of a gene to somehow essentially make a
gene perform better right to have your you know single nucleotide change or a
singular indel or insertion or whatever to correct that gene and for it to
actually have a beneficial effect it's it's much more likely that that change
will cause some sort of negative effect and cause that gene to function less or
not at all so that was kind of interesting thing like mutations are
good because like I mean before we even had like energetic like chemicals or and
whatnot like I can't remember the statistics but like crazy amount of US
patent for things like apples and grapefruits and stuff like that like it
was all just mutations essentially that's how we have actually like
thousands of different varieties of apples are all just somatic mutations
that occurred and essentially gave rise to a new cultivar that we have now
started to produce and cultivate essentially so it's it's they can be
good but they're mostly bad but you know it's still it's respectable and you just
acknowledge them and you know respect that they exist and try to work with
them because yeah what else can you do yeah I mean it's to me it's that I don't
know they I mean good or bad is really a judgment call right it's like like for
example Pinot Noir right if people know Pinot Gris or Pinot Blanc
you know those those clones Pinot Noir or sorry Pinot Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc
they're actually Pinot Noir it's all the same plant it's just at
some point in time there was a mutation in the gene that caused the pigment in
the plant right and somebody found a you know someone was walking through the
vineyard one day and noticed that there was a group of grapes on the on a
specific tree or a specific plant that had like a light pink or a kind of a
yellowy green grape rather than a dark purple one and so that plant that branch
ended up being cut off the plant and rooted on its own and like like
Christian was saying that you know that can be actually a new variety like you
can actually go and get a registration on on on because the distinctive traits
of the plant are now different from what is described in the variety registration
right so yeah when we say like a trade is bad or you know mutations are bad I
think that that's maybe a little bit misleading it kind of assumes that all
genes are good well there are genes that you know you might want to shut a gene
down like a plant that you know for example look at canola right canola was
a plant called rapeseed and it produced these acids in the seed oil that
essentially made it not good for humans to be consuming and they actually I
believe it was through EMS mutagenesis they do they actually it's kind of like
we do with colchicine you soak you soak the seeds in a chemical and there's like
random mutations that are generated in the plant and they actually they did
this process and one of the genes that got destroyed in the in the canola was
the the gene responsible for that particular acid that was in the seed oil
and so shutting down that acid in the seed oil and breeding that into a line
it actually made for a healthier seed right or sorry a healthier seed oil and
canola then became like you know one of these crops that we use for producing
massive mass amount of cooking oil all over the world I mean like to the tune
of like you know we're talking millions and millions of gallons every year so
you can't you know let's I just want to point out it's not all mutations are bad
and even destroying the gene is not necessarily bad in some in some cases we
want to do that and it's beneficial so yeah yeah no another example of that is
barley durable resistance to some pathogen I can't remember what it was
but it was achieved through a similar similar method of using mutagenic
breeding where they knocked out the susceptibility gene and it's conveyed
like decades worth of resistance in barley to that particular pathogen and
has been incredibly successful there was a paper talking about essentially
cannabis and powdery mildew susceptibility and how it doesn't have
the same knockout gene or at least not in the samples that had been sequenced
in the study that was looking at it and I posted it on my IG recently and you
would mention Kevin McKernan who did an interview with the author of that paper
and they were looking at it and saying that it's more likely going to be
difficult to read for the quantitative traits of powdery mildew resistance
whereas in barley there was just a very simple qualitative trait where they were
able to take out the susceptibility gene through mutagenic breeding I think it
was x-rays that they used in that case but anyway that's definitely it's one of
those things where sometimes there are genes that we want to take out in which
case mutations are kind of an easier pathway and then there's other you know
I can see where it's difficult to get a mutation that increases or improves
function but to the extent that that's also been mentioned earlier by you Ryan
Kevin McKernan's presentation on the Jamaican lion genome was very
informative specifically on copying copy number variants for THC synthase
genes and the the jumping genes the retro transposons that you had mentioned
and he gives a very good very specific explanation of all of these concepts in
the context of THC synthase and terpene synthase genes another quick thing to
mention someone in chat I think it was Oz something Australian grower or I
can't remember what his name was but he was talking about the difference between
germline mutations versus somatic mutations you know we use the term
somatic mutations in this paper I think when we're talking about somatic means
of the body and germline means mutations that are gonna end up in reproductive
tissue so you know as a human look at your hand you know if you've got a
mutation in this mutation occurs in the cell division on the back of your hand
and your skin there's no way for that to end up in your offspring right like you
can't have an example of that because I have I have two earlobes on one ear and
none of my kids do but I mean like granted that could theoretically I only
have two kids so sample size two but you know from what I know it's a exact
example of that this germline is just something that can be passed down and
the somatic just can't be is that just the easier way to say that yes yes and
so in that's well that's kind of the point that I was trying to make I want
to get back to Trevor's here in a second but yeah that's that's essentially the
idea that if you have like as a human a mutation that happens like in your neck
or on like your hand or in your earlobe or whatever that's not gonna get passed
down because it needs to be in the cells that that become you know sperm
cells right or in the case of a woman it would happen in your ovaries cannabis
isn't like that right because cannabis essentially all cells have the ability
to generate flowers at some point in time I mean if the mutation happens on
us in a stem right where from which a meristem will grow anywhere on the plant
like any any mutation that happens in those stems can eventually get passed on
so somatic mutations really could be germline mutations in cannabis in ways
that doesn't really happens with you can happen with humans a quick genetic
analysis thing Trevor I think it might have been interesting thing for people
to note that your double earlobe that mutation probably didn't happen in your
body it actually might be coded for that that might be a coded for gene for
example that you inherited and your kids might not have that trait because
it could be recessive it doesn't mean that it's not passed on it just you know
you'd have to you know about breeding humans we can't do that right like if it
were plants you'd you'd self the offspring or or do a sib cross of the
offspring and see if that you know if 25% of the of the progeny have that
parent pack but you know that that trait come back again but it's you know I
think from a breeding point of view it's a good way to start thinking about
analyzing your progeny to try to determine what the genetics are doing
right don't get don't necessarily be fooled and think oh that's not a mute
it's not a germline mutation you couldn't actually tell that from that
experiment the only way to know would be to do you further inbreeding which of
course we're not gonna do with humans right anyway little point to think about
and just as a teaser Trevor when you come back Wednesday everyone wants to
see your two earlobes and the YouTube chat
fair dues fair dues yeah no very good points all well taken there Ryan and
sorry everyone for the for the ping there it was just too funny so I had to
had to send a little emoji there but um yeah good time so sorry to cause a
little digression we will will cover all this on Wednesday does anybody know
anything about a creeper type mutation I know that I put a picture up that's
actually what my picture is currently that I found online but the only time
that I've seen this in nature was whenever I was in Hawaii and the best
way to describe it it's almost like the plant doesn't grow a main cola that it
almost more the energy goes to the lower branching and then I even saw some
of the lower branching establishing roots so I don't know if this was just
more of the the tropical environment that I was in and just maybe humidity
thing or if this was actual mutation that was done with that but I would like
to learn a little bit more about that if anyone knows about that because I've
only seen it with with like thin plated or equatorial lines yeah I'm not so sure
if this is the cause but I'll give you a little story I got a hold of the genius
cutting at one point in time one of mr. souls cuts and I grew up because every
you know it was so hyped online this is so hype I just wanted to see what it was
and I grew it up and I actually really hated the plant I thought it was fucking
horrible it didn't have it didn't grow up right at all the angle between like
if you if you look at a plant like especially on the main stem but you can
kind of look at on the side branches too there's an angle at which when you have
a leaf come out of the plant obviously the leaf comes out of the stem in
between that leaf petty old junction and the main stem is a new shoot will form
and that shoot grows out of the main stem at like an angle that you can
measure and so I really prefer plants that have between a zero and 45 degree
angle if you're using the main stem for example as the zero degrees because they
tend to stay more upright right but anything past a 45 degree angle the
plant when it starts to get laden with flowers you don't have enough often you
don't have enough support in the plant just falls down like kind of like Chase
was talking about and it starts to grow sideways and genius does that really
really terribly another plant that actually is also really quite poor in
that regard as she is the UK Exodus cheese it's not quite as bad as the
genius the genius is the worst I've seen but cheese is actually pretty bad too
and so what happens with these plants is they're fine until about like week for a
flower and then they just start falling over the branch side branches start
falling over under the weight and so when I'm selecting for plants I really
tend to prefer plants that have you know preferably like a zero to 30 degree
angle because I find it makes them much more rigid and less likely to do that
phenotype that Rob calls creeper in the marijuana botany book which for those
that haven't read it essentially it's like what you could do is imagine you're
at the top of a cliff you could plant a plant on the side on the top of the
cliff and rather than it growing upwards it kind of grows down and over
the plant or over the cliff kind of like a hanging basket would so yeah just
another little great but again like I think it probably comes out from a loss
of some type of lignin gene look look all mutations all phenotypes of the
result of mutations everything that we see in any plant or any human or any
animal is as a result of a mutation over time and you know like we were saying
again before like mutations are bad they are bad it might shut down the way a
gene works but over millennia that broken gene might evolve into something
else as it as it acquires mutations so I think that like we just need to like
keep in mind that these things are always happening right mutations are
always happening and they are part of the way of life of it's just it's a it's
a fact of life right I mean it's a fact of organisms being alive is that the
genes change and that change allows us an opportunity for something new to form
right so anyway yeah this is an interesting discussion because it
doesn't really flow like a lot of the other topics we have does anybody have
any questions on on mutations or anything that we talked about so far so
far that we haven't made clear well I think coming kind of what Chase was
touching on and coming at it from more of the observational level of I mean
things like freak show and ABC kind of stuff you guys have seen less less on a
genetic scientific level and more on kind of the weird shit I've come across
in my growing lifetime on that level I sent out a DM to high-grade mutants and
so hopefully he's gonna come on he said that he was driving and that he may be
able to come on depending on how long we go so hopefully you know worst-case
scenario we'll just stretch it out and he'll be able to come on and talk about
the freak show from you know personal experience breeding with it and his
observations there but um I know that when I posted about this paper a couple
a week or two ago a number of the comments focused on different me or no
actually it was after the the discussion with dr. Anna and Nishan there was some
freak show discussion and specifically people were talking about how there's
been examples of these types of leaf mutations back in the literature from
old Indian hemp literature from the 1800s and that there's also examples
that I've seen in the DEA's different every year they basically produced a
report on the different raids and busts they had done all across the country and
I remember at some point in the 1980s they identified a another leaf mutation
in a confiscation that they had done and specifically noted that it was part of a
project that was trying to breed for variation and for like hiding and
obfuscating the cultivation and so it was something that you know it high
refers to the ABC is the subterfuge and people kind of had this idea of
breeding for these leaf mutations as a way of disguising cannabis plants and as
early as the 1980s the DEA was already aware of and looking into that
possibility so it's just I know that's some of the literature that's out there
on some of these mutations and other than that my own observation this year
we had a holy banana open pollination cross and the holy bananas related to
the freak show freak shows holy banana pineapple Express I believe and we had
one branch on a plant that was showing a trifoliate expression for quite a while
for like the first as soon as it germinated and then and trifoliate being
essentially three leaves when it first emerged and then three branch sets at
every branching for probably about the first four or five feet and then it
returned to more of a normal binary sort of branching or whatever but there was
one branch on that particular plant that produced a very unique variegation where
essentially three quarters of the plant were all yellow had no chlorophyll and
then one stripe in the branch had chlorophyll and my buddy says that it's
it's one of the best branches that he smoked so far this year I haven't tried
it but he said that it's actually very very cron so that's an interesting
outlier and it comes from a population that seems to throw some freaks is that
like an albalism or a LB I and I SM correctly yeah yeah kind of and I know
that there's been some people who've worked with DJ shorts lines that have
some variegation and produce albinism or albino ism I'm you know I don't know how
to pronounce things but that's my stab at it albinism is how it is yeah that's
that's actually there's actually a really interesting little thing about
Albert about that form of irrigation so when you have a plant cell there's not
just one chloroplast in every cell there's actually a population of
chloroplasts in a given cell and so I'm you know let's just give it a number say
there's a hundred chloroplasts in that cell they they again they they self
duplicate they have their own DNA systems or their own DNA genome within
the chloroplasts kind of like mitochondria do and so they'll reproduce
themselves before the cell splits and half that population of the hundred ends
up in one half of the cell in one half one half ends up in the other self you
can now now genes on chloroplasts or genes in mitochondria they're really not
very susceptible to mutation because there's such crew there's so few genes
and they're all such crucial genes that if you have a loss of function in that
gene the the the chloroplast or the mitochondria doesn't do well like
they're essentially at a really really big disadvantage but in the case of the
chloroplast gene where that green pigment is is produced you it because
you have a population of cells that are kind of population sorry of chloroplast
in a cell they kind of make up for each other if one of them does get a mutation
so what can happen is you can get a mutation in the chloroplast in the in
the gene that produces that green pigment the chloro the chlorophyll and
you can have actually have a loss of function in that gene whereas the
chloroplast still does all the rest of the stuff that it's supposed to do but
it just doesn't produce that gene and that's fine because as long as there's
other members of the chloroplast living in that cell they kind of make up for
the deficient guy but what happens is over many cell divisions you know like
we've seen these variants change in the put in in you know with the with the
coronavirus I keep going back to that but you might have for example a a cell
that that becomes made up that all the chloroplast in that cell only have they
were they were derived from that chloroplast or the chloroplast with the
with the defective gene right and so you end up with a cell that doesn't produce
any green green pigment and this is something we see actually all the time
in cannabis you know if you're growing lots and lots of seeds you'll see this
probably once or twice a year and so as that cell divides if that cell ends up
for example like in a in a shoot then you'll have a whole shoot that comes off
that plant that is albino or what we're calling albino but really what it is is
it's a lack of chlorophyll and so the the only reason that plant is really able to
stay alive is because it's sucking on the energy and the ATP Drive that's
being made in the rest of the plant but but when that does happen you get some
really beautiful flower phenotypes like you can I had a friend put one up I'll
actually let me send it to to Peter in a second here but you know for example you
have it you can have a flower that's like half yellow and if the if it's
growing on a branch that is completely albino the entire flower will be yellow
well now if that plant produces like like a court like anthocyanin for
example you can get these really beautiful pinks that occur on the flower
so again you know it's like how do we say it it's like really it's like you
know the the value of a mutation is kind of in the beholder right we were
talking about good mutations and bad mutations like here's an example somebody
asked if there was a mutation that happens that leads to a change in in
chemotype so the expression of CBG in a plant happens when we shut down the THC
acid synthase or CBD acid synthase if it was a type 3 plant so so let's say we're
talking about you know a pure THC plant if that pure THC plant acquires genetic
mutations in the THC acid synthase gene on both chromosomes that plant now
doesn't have the ability to turn CBG into THC and so what happens is CBG back
backs up and accumulates right because there's no enzyme there to functionally
turn that CBG into THC so there's like an example of a mutation that happens
where we destroy a gene but it results in a phenotype a new chemical a new
chemical phenotype or chemotype that is different and novel right so again not
all mutations are bad sure I know that another one that I've seen is like a
polyembryonic seed where you'll have one seed that will actually have twins that
will pop out of them I know that for me I look at it from the standpoint that
you know I've just increased my yield by a hundred percent potentially by having
something of that nature and I posted some stuff on twins on my Instagram page
showing how they've induced twinning by injecting vitamin C into the embryo and
it's causing a split it's something I'm gonna try to start diving into here
myself late this year that's super interesting I know that I have another
one that some people know it as duck foot but I have like some fries and
purple stuff with this you know the same family of plants that has like
webbed leaves that will usually put off you know purple flowers which I don't
know if that particular mutation leads to the plant having more anthocyanins
than normal but it's something that I have noticed with any of the the web to
leaf cultivars that are out there I believe Trevor you're talking about like
cannabis plants that were like had three branches I think you had the terms
for it I know when I was working like with the master grower at the facility I
was that she she essentially would call them like like they were rare mutations
and then there's something she would like hunt after because like you said
they they were really high quality or really just like beneficial and I'm not
exactly sure what ways I shouldn't really go into too much details but she
also had the term for them she called them Queens they're special plants of
hers so sure found one where essentially like you know your apical
meristem essential branches off into like three different like branches from
the center one they're just very unique and special I'm not exactly sure but it
definitely seems like it's a mutation and it definitely seems like a
beneficial one from her observations and comments and I'm hearing Trevor so
that's something I've seen or not seen but heard about so that's interesting
I've seen that a few times and now once cloned it seems to not replicate on the
same level you'll get some of the cuttings from that top where one of them
will repeat that same expression and the other ones from the other two cuttings
that do not so I'm not sure how reliable it would be to to work with the the
cuttings that weren't showing it well how does that affect the expression of
the mutation so if you get those three tops and only one and the clonal
generation repeats it what's the thoughts on that my first thought
essentially it may be the mutation kind of like branched off of a single like a
one of the branches essentially so you're saying you know some of the
clones would cause it so my first guess is maybe the mutation wasn't carried on
to the you know to these X cells essentially wasn't carried over and
essentially the two branches maybe don't have that mutation while that one
branch does have that mutation so that's that's my first thought yeah I've always
noticed that it ends at a certain point so I've grown out a number of plants
male and female different populations that express the trait and it seems like
some pop out of it very quickly and only have said about three or four branches
with the like three nodes but then this one and one other plant that I've grown
out have both kind of gotten it granted these are just in their initial sort of
like I'm sexing them out stage in like five gallon buckets or so and they're
about like three or four feet tall maybe five feet tall was the highest I've ever
seen one go in terms of continuing to produce that and then after that it just
goes back to more of a conventional pattern and one reason I could see it
being beneficial is just you're increasing productivity for all of the
lower part of the plant and getting more branches per you know square foot
theoretically depending on your growth style that may help for productivity but
this this variegation was unique in terms of you know I've seen plenty of
variegation and particularly in the older DJ short lines but it was pretty
muted it wasn't like this and this was more of a yellow variegation it wasn't
there's somebody who's working with one of his lines that it literally looks
like the plant material itself the leaves the inflorescence of the actual
flower are white in expression I can't remember the Instagram user off the top
of my head but that's that's another one and what you said I think is definitely
right Ryan like there's enough energy going from everywhere else in the plant
to sort of offset the lack of chlorophyll production in that one area
that it didn't there was no loss of vigor in this particular plan it was
actually relatively speaking out of all of the holy banana open pollination
crosses that we did it was probably the biggest and also just to say that that
population seems to really put out some interesting expressions and something
I'm not sure what it is in there but for some reason that combination produces
unique phenotypes or you know I guess in this case genotypes my next guests are
kind of thoughts on that I was essentially like epigenetics maybe like
the cultivars sensitive to epigenetic changes because if you're saying that
you've seen like the try kind of branching and eventually kind of reverts
back it kind of almost seems like it's not as like ingrained in the DNA and it
could mean potentially it's just like an alteration of the expression of the DNA
something with methylation and I mean epigenetics is in general is still like
a very unknown kind of subject but maybe the cultivar just sensitive to
epigenetic changes and certain environmental changes or whatnot could
cause certain expressions to trigger or to silence so it's my thoughts there
yeah it's one of those things we also see with are you talking about kind of
that world phylotaxy phenotype Trevor like where you get three three shoots to
a node I mean I don't know if that's what you're talking about but on that on
that topic is it is kind of a you know quote-unquote phenotypic mutation that
really seems to happen in in young plants right like usually you when you
see like a plant that comes up with that world phenotype it's usually gone by
like the third or the fourth or fifth node right like you'll see it happen in
very young plants and then it goes away so I don't know if it's like something
to do with the juvenile state or a hormonal thing or what it is but yeah
that could be some kind of again epigenetics means it literally means
standing like it means above genetics so like you can kind of kind of think of it
as like something standing on top of the genes that like is another factor that
that changes the way that those genes are transcribed yeah and like Christian
said we don't really know a ton a ton about the mechanism of action of that
but we know it happens for sure yeah that's exactly the trait that I was
referring to and I think that's a great point like there's this sort of there
seems to be a belief that epigenetics explains a huge amount of like sort of
unknown heritability but I that seems way overstated and that really
epigenetics is much more about the expression of the individual the traits
in an individual over time and much less about necessarily heritability that's
not to say that there aren't heritable elements in terms of epigenetics and
environmental influences that can then be encoded into a genetic trait or an
epigenetic trait that's passed on through generations but it it feels like
to a certain extent in the the layman's sort of pop science world that
epigenetics gets thrown around as if it's the explanation for everything on a
heritable level as opposed to just variation and trade expression within a
plant due to the plasticity that exists in the expression of genes and to the
extent that's a question I just think the two of you are way better versed in
explaining and talking about this Christian and Ryan than I am yeah I mean
you bring up some good points with like a epigenetics it's some people do
definitely just default on to it as like an easy answer to a lot of questions
yeah the truth is we just really don't know a lot and that's kind of the funny
thing than being you know in school and then doing my PhD is more I research the
more I look into the more I realize we don't know so there's so much to look
into and I mean yeah it's easy to just kind of say oh you see some sort of
change like oh epigenetics and because I don't know no one really even knows too
much about epigenetics to just kind of like okay and just accept it as a just
as a term and as a concept but it definitely could be wrong or it could be
something else going on like such a my big you know project on what I'm really
looking into is just kind of like what's causing this genetic very variety like
to exist within cannabis or and I don't see any species right and you know the
big three that essentially I'm looking at and you know I'm hoping expands in
the future is essentially stomatic mutations which is you know my phase one
the next is essentially epigenetics so I actually have a colleague who is looking
at like the RNA which is like the the genetic material that you can that gets
transcribed into proteins so he's looking at RNA and seeing the expression
of RNA and stuff like that and that gives you a much better idea of
epigenetics so he's hoping to look at that and then the last you know subject
is essentially viruses and by roads and pathogens it's another topic that you
know the cannabis world is pretty you know minimal knowledge about it because
of prohibition and just you know the regulations etc so those just three huge
areas that could have an effect but we don't know how much or what effect and
you know why I'm researching and trying to you know provide some more answers
and see what's really going on and what's really the culprit to changes and
phenotypes and etc I sent Peter a couple of pictures of some variegated plants or
one that one that was like an albino shoot and then one that was kind of a
sectoral chimera I don't know Peter if you've got those or not I didn't see
them come up on the screen in the in the YouTube video but I I wasn't watching
it that that closely so oh here they are right now so this is a guy a friend of
ours in the in the Twitter sphere that's a Canadian grower working on getting
licensed and he grows for medical patients but you can see this is one of
these plants that had you can actually see very clearly right down the midline
of that one leaf where half of its yellow and half of its green that's a
result of that chloroplast thing we were talking about last time where you end up
with you know a given cell that has some some chloroplast functional search sorry
some functional chloroplast and some non-functional and you end up with a
cell that inherits only non-functional copies and so you see a branch that half
of the plant has functional copies and half doesn't right and then there was
another plant as another one I showed you Peter as well did you get the one
with the albino which is essentially a shoot that that grew out of you know the
left you for her sorry the yellow side of a plant so it wasn't actually
variegated it has both copies sorry it has it has only a hair ago so it appears
white you can actually see the plant looks a little bit dirty that with this
was grown in a greenhouse and this is actually a variegated plant it's just
one of the branches from that variegated plant grew completely without chloroplasts
that would not normally live right because again if it's the whole plant
if the whole plant is doesn't have any chloroplasts that the plant can't
absorb any sunlight so it's not going to grow in the laboratory in tissue culture
what they'll do is they'll you know usually if you can feed the plant sugar
and kind of bypass photosynthesis but on a full plant it doesn't really work but
you can see there's a little bit of a purple just starting on this one this
wasn't the hikes how I anthocyanin expressing plant but if you have this
combination of the albine albinism with a like a blueberry or something that's
you know like a purple plant like you know purple oracle or something like
that you end up with these really incredible pink hues and you know if
you're growing a greenhouse full of these plants you might only get like you
know say like even in like a you know a 10,000 square foot greenhouse you might
also just get like you know like a couple of ounces but I always thought
that if you could go through and pull out like a couple of ounces of pink
flour that they'd be selling for top top dollar anyway maybe we'll see that one
day maybe we won't who knows thanks for thanks for putting those up Peter
appreciate that and Trevor I've yours the last two you sent me in the first
one too cool yeah they're just samples of what I was talking about earlier
showing the the variegation in in that particular branch and also when it got
chopped and I think it kind of has some of what Ryan's talking about in terms of
the like the pinking and purpling there was definitely some of that that
happened in the holy banana population and so but it was only one branch so you
know it wasn't a whole plant and then as intense nearly as intense as that what
we just saw there that that's pretty striking and but yeah go on right no I'm
just looking at the plant the flowering plant so that's a variegated plant too
that was the one that's pure and yellow I can't tell of it yeah yeah that's the
branch that so the variegated branch that is in the picture in veg when it
got harvested that's what that branch looked like gotcha cool yeah yeah and my
buddy says that it's his fav one of his favorites that he's tried from quite a
bit of different I think we had about 300 different plants in like specific
seed phenotypes that we ran through this year and it's one of the one of the
winners it definitely it it had a lot of unique characteristics and was not
something that we really expected to you know we've had our eye on it all along
but we kind of were like oh yeah this thing has some like cool novelty sort of
like traits but it's not gonna be the banger and it turns out it's a banger
Tony you posted a little bit about this on Instagram you want to jump in and you
got to unmute yourself the stuff that I had posted on Instagram was just kind of
helping other folks dive into the same topic so that they can learn along with
us at the same time instead of just trying to bro science it off their
friends information that they might have heard from the next guy because like
everybody on here is a little bit higher educated than I am on this topic I've
only learned about most of this stuff from just witnessing it happening in
front of me or whether or not it had like I so many people I consulted
talking about genetic drift in their clones and then going in and seeing what
they were talking about by taking a cut from one spot and putting it in another
place and seeing how the expression changed or how an og went from expressing
five and seven bladed leaves to now expressing three-fingered leaves on
there and they think all of a sudden they have a novel mutation it just most
of the time I wasn't seeing what people thought they were seeing I was just
seeing a phenotypical plasticity in the plant since none of that was replicating
in a clonal generation of that actual plant a lot of people would take cuts
off it they pass it to their friend and the mutation that they believed they'd
seen in the clone that they were caping as a mother wasn't ever showing up
anywhere else so I was always under the impression that most of the time what
people were offering up in the canoes community had something to do with the
issues of the environment that they had put it in or the plant just showing a
different phenotypical expression based on those like the world phylo taxi
something was causing this in the plant early on and then it disappears as you
take clonal generations off the plant by the time I usually take a third
generation of clones from that plant it never shows back up in the plant or
folks seeing the the leaf growth of like bud growth on a leaf when they
start to alter the hormones in a plant now they believe they've got a novel
mutation of epithelial growth on their leaves which just happens to now be a
problem with the hormone production in the plant from the root tips to the tips
of the leaves from it traveling through the floam and xylem in the plant it just
basically comes down to people were being too quick to call something a
mutation and not understanding it fully which is why I wanted to be on here today
to learn and to help people with maybe recognizing it and something else if you
see a variegation in a plant it could be a form of a mutation if you see a plant
that's got it's fasciated like a cactus or you see a mutation of plants like the
white blackberry that's a way for folks to recognize it in something outside of
cannabis so that they can understand that maybe what they're seeing in their
plant isn't exactly a mutation and instead is a just a plasticity in the
plant and that phenotypic expression yeah that's a great point I mean we
truly don't know sometimes when people are quick to either throw away like say
mutation or even jeppy genetic and people are just they don't truly know
what's going on without actually sequencing the DNA and actually you know
using bioinformatic tools to analyze and assess it you don't truly really know so
people are easy to just take the easy route and just take the you know through
this term through that term and then just you know just keep going on with
their day who really knows what's really going on with the genetics that's why
I'm here I'm trying to research and trying to figure out what's actually
happening you know hey we just I invited max up to speak max's canna research
high-grade mutants on Instagram those are two separate Instagram accounts but
for people who don't know max it was involved in the discovery and breeding
project that helped to bring the freak show to the world so max if you want to
introduce yourself and talk about the freak show it's a it's really great to
have you on to discuss the freak show your dad's work and your work and
everyone who's kind of like you know run with the freak show yeah definitely can
you guys hear me yeah there's a little bit of static but we can definitely hear
you man and I mean it's not bad static it's just you know if you're on the road
it's road noise but you're you're good I think I think it's background fan noises
word okay yeah I'm max second generation pollen
sucker self-proclaimed scientist yeah if there's any questions you guys have
particularly about the freak show I could go over some really simple stuff
the first thing that I would say is if you're interested in you know mutations
mutation breeding is um learning the difference like what you guys are
talking about right now somatic versus germline mutations a somatic mutation is
going to be occurring in the somatic cell which is any cell besides the
gametes gametes and germline mutations going to be a mutation that occurs
inside of the sex cells inside the gametes so that means every cell of the
organism is going to be affected this is how most of our known cannabis mutations
that have a observable phenotype their germline mutations ABC freak show duck
foot the ones that we know of somatic mutation would be like kind of like bone
was talking about fasciation a plant that just has a couple odd leaves here
and there if you were to take a clone for example of a fasciated branch or one
of those plants that has a few leaves that are odd they're gonna revert back
to normal because DNA has essentially cellular mechanisms machinery that kind
of tidy things back up and yeah there's different kinds of mutations when we go
into that when you're talking about somatic and germline you have point
mutations indels which are insertions deletions you have duplication event do
we lose you max what's up with that little phone thing you got a call oh is
that when you get a call now I think that's if you got a call there's the
phone call again hold on he'll be back it's the man they don't want us to have
this information so they're shutting down dude no it's definitely a wife or
girlfriend where he's like okay I can't talk right like call call call call call
call call but yeah by way of some more introduction if people don't know max
from as I know the story max went up and actually got the holy banana plants that
were used in the cross that created the freak show and so he's he's been there
at every step of the way with the plants his dad bred the freak show initially he
bred the berry freak he's been involved in the entire process from going and
getting the genetics to you know having his dad is dead apparently and he can
speak to this more than obviously I can his dad read the initial freak show
found an isolated it and they've done a lot of work with it and it's you know
these are definitely some unique genetics and like I was saying that holy
banana population that he went and picked up the plants from that helped to
make the freak show cross is the same population that I used to get that you
know the the odd variegation and trifoliate world world taxi pheno so
it's it's an interesting genetic population that puts out some weirdos
for sure hey max update your profile dude so we
can people can follow you on IG you can put your you can put your IG handle on
your profile and then people will know how to find you there oh it's on there
it's on there it's high-grade mutants no underscores or nothing just high-grade
mutants okay I could I could kind of kind of kind of a test of what Trevor
saying about the holy banana like it does seem even outside of the pineapple
Express cross I I see a lot of unique themes like Trevor was talking about the
trifoliates I have a pineapple by holy banana that I crossed to a dual og and a
bunch of quad phyto taxis popped out of there and I've never seen that and it
didn't go away the plant just continues to produce four branches at the exact
same node so that was kind of notable also I've seen people take freak show
and cross it back to genetics that just contain holy banana and they come out
with some really neat serrations you know a higher leaf set and that's just
you know a hybrid so I've seen someone take freak show by I've read 24k to the
holy banana same father is freak show and someone took that it crossed that to
freak show and they ended up with a lot of unique plants right out of the f1s
which is pretty notable actually yeah if anyone has any other questions just
let me know no I had a point though not really question the freak show is you
know I think it's actually a really good example of what a variety is right you
know we talked about we're trying to correct the use of the word strain or at
least I have and pushing people to use cultivar because cultivar is really the
most appropriate term but variety is also a valid plant term you know we're
talking about types of type types of plants or types of population a variety
is essentially a population for which there is a disc like a describing or
defining trait that is hair that is inherited by all the the point you know
it's inherited and shared by the entire population and so so the freak show
plant with that weird leaf is actually like you know it might be a good good
example of what a variety is because when you breed the plant at least within
its type it always comes back that always trait comes back so there's a
there's a good example of a cat and it was ready for you right and that that's
what I initially started kind of deviating each version because the most
of the heterozygous versions are really deeply serrated they're you know kind of
quasi turning into that pinnate leaf shape and that's what we designated them
to variety one and variety two for the pinnate one that was at least my
designation and I more recently changed that to variation because the
heterozygous version technically isn't really a variety because it's actually
not very stabilized and it's I don't really know how you would stabilize
something that every time that you breed it to itself it results in a different
phenotype well it's not it's like it's like a type 2 plant like so like a CBD
THC plant if you breed a CBD THC plant itself you get pure THC plants do you
get the THC CBD plants and then you get pure CBD plants so it's really what
would be called a hybrid variety because again that like you said the the
defining characteristic is controlled by like in a heterozygous state right so
there's really no way to inbreed it as a true like what we would call a variety
right so yeah that would be a hybrid variety I had a quick question for you
real quick Ryan how do we define the difference between S&P and a point
mutation okay well they're really they're different words a point mutation
results in different like okay S&P or SNP really stands for single nucleotide
polymorphism and so the word polymorphism if you break it down poly
just means more than one morph is really a word that means form and you know isms
as Ferris Bueller says in my opinion are not good but yeah it's it's really like
what it really means is that there's multiple forms of a gene so you might
have like a single you might have a point mutation that results in different
polymorphisms right so when you're talking about like a SNP you're really
talking about a gene set rather than one gene the point mutation is what happens
in a gene to create the genetic variation that we'd see in an allelic
series right so I don't know if that answers your question so it would be
technically that the point mutation would come first and if it persisted
anywhere in the genome then it would become a SNP well again this is like the
isn't talking about one gene a SNP really means like it's like it's like
again think about the the word single nucleotide polymorphism right so it's
you're looking at the G you're looking at two genes and seeing that there's
different forms at one very split what way one nucleotide right or one very
exact single genetic letter spot in a gene right and so if you have two genes
with with one letter difference in the genetic code those are polymorphisms
right and so you'd talk you would talk about that single nucleotide more
polymorphism really in the context of two genes it's not really something that
you talk about in the context of one gene because it doesn't really make
sense right like you can't have multiple forms in one gene there's only one of
them right so if you have two genes and you say you see that they're different
in one single nucleotide then those genes would would have you know you can
you could refer to those genes as SNPs right so or sorry you could you could
refer to the genetic differences as SNPs and so when we talk about SNPs in like a
pop you know when we're talking about SNPs and like say the phylos context or
the galaxy right like those are just single nucleotide changes throughout the
genome that are different between different plants so again that was like
a really terrible explanation or answer the question that you're asking but yeah
I think just with like the phylos example what they did was they took all
the different reference samples that they collected early on and I don't know
how many it was and they identified I think 2,500 or 3,000 SNPs single
nucleotide polymorphism in those reference samples and basically they
just took each of the samples sequenced it we don't really know exactly where on
the genome they were looking specifically but they took the
references and or they took the samples cross-reference them and identified
2,000 or you know 2,500 to 3,000 of these different variations and that's how they
built out their reference set. So those point mutations that happen happen at
those SNPs and create those changes in those SNPs and those SNPs then become
you know present in the genome and you can see those in different varieties
where there's variation under a particular point and that's kind of like
yeah it doesn't it doesn't even really matter where they are is just that
they're what they are is that their genetic differences between lines and
then we can use those genetic differences to essentially track
populations. I think Christian do you want to I don't know if you're still
here but if you could if you can still if you're still listening could you jump
in and talk about SNPs and how what kind of software is used to identify those
things and how like how that process works? Yes essentially SNP is like a
change in the base essentially across the whole entire genome while like a
point mutation is looking at actual like mutation within a gene that's my best
understanding from it. So SNP can kind of happen across the entire genome
whether it be an actual gene or uncoded region while a point mutation is more of
an actual mutation or change within a specific area like a gene that you're
looking at or whatever. So and then on to the whole software side of things that
was interesting I didn't really have too much background experience with like
bioinformatics which is you know using computers for large data sets. So I had
to learn on the fly and stuff but it was pretty rewarding it's like a lot of
coding and stuff so essentially the program that we use primarily for
analyzing it was called analyzing like the genome and then the samples was
called VCF tools. So that's the main tool we use to essentially filter it and you
know do our analysis and essentially make you know present the data that it
was presented. So yeah any other questions or can I elaborate on anything
or do you want clarifications? I feel like we've all done a really poor job of
explaining what a SNP is. Point mutations result in SNPs okay so like for example
say we got one chromosome and that chromosome doubles and then mates with
another plant and then so that chromosome is now in two different
plants right. If one of those plants undergoes a genetic change at one
nucleotide or one genetic letter that change results in what we call a SNP
right or a single nucleotide polymorphism because now we've got one
of one one individual with the original chromosome in its original form and then
we've got this other individual with a change in one genetic base pair or one
nucleotide and so if you compare those plants together there is a mutation in
that chromosome at one place so that really is like that that is a SNP right
or could be used as a SNP that we can use to sort like any plant for example
that was descended from the mutants you know we could trace back to the mutants
and so you could use that in the SNP call right like you could essentially
you can have a computer program go through after sequencing and find this
genetic change at that one letter that's really the basis of like a single
nucleotide polymorphism and I cannot feel like I gave a really bad
explanation of what that is I don't know someone wants to jump in and try to do better
we're on the fly here and I think I think everybody's hitting it like all of
the explanations do touch on the fundamental the fact that they are
connected that there is a there are point mutations that happen then there
are SNPs and these point mutations lead to the SNPs but when you're looking at a
point mutation and you're looking at a particular trait or gene it becomes a
little bit different in terms of that verse doing a comparative analysis on a
genome level between two different samples and identifying the individual
variations which are the single nucleotide polymorphisms that happen at
the basis in the genome of the two samples that you're looking at and I
probably just added more confusion and butchered it more but you know we're all
I think I think the important thing to remember is that like again the key word
there is polymorphism or meaning multiple forms right so multiple the
polymorphism really just means there's multiple forms of genes and those
multiple forms we might call them alleles right because they might have
that single nucleotide change might lead to a change in phenotype but it doesn't
always because again I was talking about this like redundancy that's built into
the genetic code which kind of gives like a little bit of wiggle room so you
can have mutations that happen at the DNA level but they don't lead to a
phenotype change and this is something we're gonna cover on that in that course
that we're talking about doing but yeah like I think the the best way is to say
it is is that like a point mutation just means a change in the genetic code at
one very specific DNA letter right when you have point mutations that occur that
then means that we've created multiple forms of genes right and the snip is how
we identify that those genes are different forms if that makes it gonna
give an example for people on the humans so that folks can kind of see it it
would be blue right there's a protein that causes people's eyes to turn blue
instead of brown eventually and it the snip I'm trying to get it here it's the
snip RS 1 2 9 1 3 8 3 2 is a gene called the Herc 2 it's affecting the protein
made by the nearby genes low levels of this protein cause the jury version of
the snip which lead to lower levels of melanin which in turn leads to blue eyes
visualize
yeah again a loss of function right so that the the wild type we call it here's
a concept that I don't think we've touched on on the plant but there's the
concept of a wild type of a trait so the wild type for humans for eye color is
brown right that's the that's the version of the trait that is the most
commonly found in humans when at some point in time there was a point mutation
that occurred that led to no pigment being deposited in the in people's eyes
and the result of that was blue eyes right so the genetic there was a point
mutation that led to this genetic change sorry I guess the point mutation was the
genetic change but the phenotypic outcome was a change in I color without
the brown pigment being deposited in the eye the eyes appear blue right so
it's it's in a way it's kind of like that CPG mutation right like the wild
type for CBD or sorry the wild type for chemotype would be either THC or CBD but
if we break that gene or we find a mutant version of the THC gene or the
CBD gene the CBD acid synthase gene or the THC acid synthase gene when those
genes are non-functional we back up CPG because there's no enzyme to turn it
into THC and so the the the phenotype is a CPG dominant plant but the genetic
mutation happens in either the THC acid synthase gene or the CBD acid this sorry
the CBD acid synthase gene I've got a question for Max if he's still around
bring it back to the freak show talk
I'm actually there okay oh just wondered if you or know anyone who's like
sequence the DNA kind of know anything about the genetics of Rick show you
could elaborate on that have we ever sequenced it no we haven't that's
something that I'm trying to get done as much as I can any kind of sequencing I
have kind of genes I'm interested in that I'd like to sequence and compare to
some kind of normal reference that we if we could do something like that hey hey
Max I've got I picked up some of your freak show seeds I actually haven't
started them but they're in one of my libraries that I've actually moved into
Canadian system so one stuffs in the system it can move around between you
know either universities or producers so if if that was something that Christian
wanted to tackle I don't know if he's got the funding to look at it but we
could arrange for that to happen yeah I think that'd be awesome my whole goal is
to kind of try to do this open source so everybody could kind of see what's going
on I also have when I read read the initial f1s and I made my version of
pineapple expressed by holy banana I have every version that goes along too
so I have the version that came before the mutation I have you know the variety
the ones that I call variety one variety two I think it'd be kind of important to
genotype both of them and see exactly where that change from the variety one
to variety two is going there's definitely something going on there it's
the only mutation that I could say that I note that has an intermediate phenotype
so all the other mutations that I've seen so far and I've seen people doing
research with seeing people reading there's not an actual intermediate
phenotype or a co-dominant phenotype so I would be interested to see exactly
what's going on on a genomic level with that something interesting about that
population is that I'm pretty sure it was part of an early and it was limited
but it was a early experiment that BAM did with steep hill and I think they
were only looking at THC synthase genes but that holy banana population was
grown out and was part of a genomic study that BAM did with Reggie Godino
over at steep hill so there may be some information that steep hill had or has
on the parent generation granted I think it was very limited and focused at a
particular area that wouldn't really tell the you know the leaf traits yeah I
mean if we could test you know at least somewhere that came from the father's
side the mother's side and you know both intermediate phenotypes we could
actually see where it happened my best guess honestly is that it was a
combination of the genes coming together and the environment that they were in
but I wouldn't take it away at all from you know the holy banana side or the
pineapple Express side I think they contributed to making it what it is
really my dad initially when he found his mutations he started back crossing
to the pineapple Express because he saw right away a variety one which came out
of that back cross so he thought right then okay well this must be where the
genes coming from but that was you know before further research and finding you
know we could find variety ones in certain certain crosses will display
that just depending what the genetics are some show more of intermediate
phenotype than others and I've back crossed it to holy banana and seen the
same kind of results so it's kind of undefinitive on does it come from this
side or does it come from that side reading doesn't tell us much as you
know you know other people like CSI had went through hundreds of those same holy
bananas you know kind of trying to find an inkling of you know some kind of
mutation and no one really found anything on both sides but as soon as
you look into those f1s of the cross it's fairly evident yeah I definitely
saw a lot of those holy bananas grown out because I remember when BAM started
the population and then gave those plants out and it was it was pretty
uniform and stable I don't recall seeing anything in the actual holy banana
population that was released that had those traits BAM would obviously and
other people who grew them out would be able to speak to it but I just remember
following along and not really seeing any certainly no freak shows and you
know what you guys were able to find was unique yeah the one other thing that I
you know always wanted to trace down and grow out a population of such but it's
just not possible unfortunately is the big sir holy weed there was just always
this kind of thing in the back of my mind you know that maybe that's where
some of this came from because there's a lot of I don't know it kind of has a
mysterious background and it's a pure land rate people worked it quite a long
time and I have heard certain kind of anomalies from certain stories like that
of unique serrations and stuff like that but I've never seen any photo evidence
and I ping BAM to see if you can jump on I will say one more thing for you
know anybody interested in reading mutants and mutations when you have a
mutation from you know my experience and from other researchers that are working
on mutations it's kind of a give-and-take situation the more of a
full-blown mutation that you want to go the more that you dig into that that
gene and get it to express itself you know the more of maybe a negative
connotation you're gonna have in terms of really perfect budding structure and
you know immaculate growth forms and stuff like that so all that has to be
kind of taken in account and you know there there definitely is some gene
linkages that go on with having extremely complex leaf shape it makes a
smaller bract and it takes a lot of breeding to breed those kind of things
away from each other because they are actually linked and I'm sure if you know
Hyde was on here he's another mutant breeder he could attest to you know that
kind of thing you know using the most highest THC types that he had available
it took him quite a long time to probably push it away from you know
whatever the ABC leaf shape was connected to but um yeah there's a you
know there's a few other people that are definitely more knowledgeable in this
subject and have more many more years of experience
Callie from Callie seeds a mutant breeder that I'm gonna be interviewing
actually did the interview and I'm just waiting for him to finish that up and
obviously HYB shape shifter my dad he's got a few other things up his sleeve
we're not exactly that close I don't I haven't talked to him for a while but
the last time that I was he was working on what he calls virgin Mary Jane which
was basically a cannabis strain that has no pistols and won't take
pollination but yeah that's kind of my take is if you're gonna get into it it's
gonna be a lot more breeding than normal to get where you want to be and we could
go into that later into the intricacies of what kind of breeding for these
recessive traits are kind of required yeah that pistol is variety that's
actually so they've documented all these different flower morphologies and
Arabidopsis and there's essentially different genes that are responsible for
different parts of the flower and so you know there's a flower type that was
called a gametes which just means without gametes but there's also one
called pistol a lot of and I think pistol a lot is the one that actually
has no pistols or it's actually would be no stigmas the pistol would be removing
the whole calyx which is obviously we don't want to do that because that's
where all of the the fun stuff juice is located on the plant the resin plans of
course but yeah you can if there's you can actually find in traits that have a
mutation in the stigma or genes involved in the production of the stigma so what
you end up with is like a calyx with no little hair sticking out of the top and
so like you were saying the plant is essentially functionally sterile sorry
sterile as a female plant it's hard to breed those plants obviously because you
can't there's you know there's nowhere for the pollen to land to get into the
ovule so the plant is functionally sterile but if you reverse it you can
often still get them to make pollen and breed it that way through a different
channel and then do a back cross but I think those plants will probably be the
ones that are you know they end up being solely propagated by clone they
won't be seed varieties just because they're too hard to to engineer that
trade into the variety yeah I definitely agree with that too it would be
something that ends up being cloned I think he has a sister or a seed that's a
sister to it that produces little pistols that he was thinking about doing
some kind of interbreeding but I think you're right once it doesn't have the
capability to really sexually reproduce then it kind of is what it is but it's a
great strain I mean my sister brought me some samples of it the other day it's
like it's it's it's definitely a og it's a mutation of some sort of og it has
it's kind of like a kosher SFV kind of flavor and really nice og buds but it
has absolutely no hairs hey max another question if you don't mind now you say
work with like mutagenic like cannabis and stuff like that are you inducing the
mutations like are you adding immunogenesis or any chemicals or
anything are you just like mass screening or mass producing and then
what kind of like work do you work with these kind of weirder you know cannabis
plants what do you do with them you can elaborate that'd be awesome thanks no no
no mutagenic substances no TC and manipulation anything like that is
pretty much just you know happenstance I have some theories of you know
possibly why the mutations would have you know occurred but it's just too too
numerous I do know that the you know mutation happens somewhere in the germ
line obviously the sex cells of one of the parent plants or maybe possibly
mutations in both of the parent plants gametes for whatever reason was going on
but no essentially it's just all from selection the this whole entire thing
couldn't have it could have technically just not existed we could have chose to
breed the regular ones me and my father from you know both of our experiments
with what we were doing we could have can just threw everything away that
looks kind of odd but after I you know saw what he was doing I basically
followed his exact same breeding protocol which when he initially bred
his variety one together he just mass screened the seeds like my dad actually
did something different than what I did he looked at the seeds and he looked for
any seed that had any kind of deviation and he only sprouted those and out of
those he called anything that was relatively normal and I did a similar
protocol when I went through my f1s and called everything that was regular but I
didn't screen through my seeds or anything like that I actually wasn't a
hundred percent positive that I was going to even find anything in my f1s
because they're actually clones that were bred at a separate facility so it
actually took me quite a while to you know actually go through the seeds and
make the f2s and have people you know send me back reports and see what's in
there cool thank you I was wondering like are you doing anything to like
stabilize these genetics and stuff I'm not sure I think you maybe mentioned
something with that but yeah it's all been stabilized pretty much on both
parts my dad's part he stabilized what I would consider like you know a
terpenelein lemon-lime kind of version of that mutation you know complete
pretty homogenous fully homozygous recessive he took that I don't know
maybe to f8 f9 or something I'm not positive exactly what generation that
he's on right now but um yeah essentially just by selection and sib
breeding brother-to-sister breeding and fgenning and selecting only the
mutations that's the way we stabilized it I tried to keep my genetic pool open
as I can so sometimes I would use multiple males multiple females I've
also done you know heterozygous to homozygous crosses on purpose to see
what I would get out of that and I have basically every version in between that
you could possibly think of in the you know they all show kind of different
ratios depending what their what their cross do what they're out cross to stuff
like that that's awesome that's really amazing thank you for sharing the
details and whatnot I also really I'm excited and hopeful for your sequencing
of those genomes especially if you have you know the parents and whatnot you can
see what's actually happening through at the different stages if I could get my
hands on that and I had the time for it oh I would I would be very happy and
very excited to work with that but I'm sure there's someone out there that will
jump on that any day now and or if not yourself right so yeah that's all really
awesome stuff I'm really excited to see what what's found yeah I know Anna
Schwab is pretty excited about all those weird little mutants so you might see
her tackle that job but are you in max are you still in color Colorado is your
doors your dad in Colorado because I mean she's at the University there so
that might be an avenue for you no we're we're from California actually my
dad's he's moving out to Oregon so I'm California he's Oregon guy I'm just
realizing Anna's on the East Coast now so I don't even it doesn't matter though
anyone that's interested I don't care if they're from Spain I want to get this
you know whole entire thing sequenced you know it's not a big deal there's not
very much you know preventing us from getting seeds to where they need to be
and stuff like that aside from the law yeah well like I said man I've got some
of them up here in the Canadian system so if there's any Canadian researchers
that want to dive into that we can talk about it that's easily solvable yeah
awesome I think would make a killer dissertation Caleb's doing some really
interesting work with the crossing both I don't know if you still keep you keep
on going with it but he crossed the ABC to the to the freak show to see if they
would you'd get like a third more strange morphology and when he crossed
those two types together he got back the wild type which probably just means that
yeah there's something in genetics called complementation and so if you've
got two mutants in different pathways when you cross them together they those
mutant phenotypes disappear but if you self the plant you know you might have
when you self the plant you get like you know one for one for one sixteen sorry
one of sixteen that that will show the double mutant type right so I'd like to
really see that that second generation of the self generation of that cross
because you might end up with some really bizarre leaf morphologies out of
that project I've seen it already I don't think that those two genes mix
like I don't think you're gonna end up with an intermediate phenotype by doing
that what ends up happening is either the intermediate heterozygous phenotype
will dominate over both the normal leaf shape and the recessive on both sides or
so you end up with an ABC phenotype type 1 phenotype or a type 2 freak show
phenotype or a normal leaf one but you don't really end up with a combination
of either of them you could kind of read in either direction but the f1's are
pretty unique like you have these really deeply serrated phenotypes
compared to most most f1's that I've seen but um there's another mutant
breeder his name's Callie and I've also kind of theorized on the same thing is
depending on where the genes land you should be able to get a mix of
phenotypes and he's done just that so I can't really exactly go into what all of
his stuff is made with and the genetics behind it but he has an intermediate
phenotype of one of his types and freak show so two different mutant types come
together and yeah there's another kind out there because of him so he beat me
to the punch on that one that's not exactly true when you cross the two of
them together you might not get that phenotype in the first generation but
that's only half the experiment to really understand if you're getting like
what we would call a double mutant or a double knockout in whatever those genes
are is you'd have to take it down you'd have to self and self the f1 or like do
an open pollination and look through the f2 generation because you really can I
bet you we could would get some altered phenotypes yeah I think that you know you
might end up doing something like maybe seeing a slightly more serrated ish ABC
type leaf or maybe a you know freak show leaf that's not quite as serrated
but I don't think it's gonna be as you know mind-blowing as as you would think
I think it's gonna be rather close to the initial phenotype rather than a
full-blown mixture I know that the normal leaf shape and you know the freak
leaf shape will mix but ABC will not mix really with a normal leaf shape so
that's kind of why I've came to that conclusion if ABC could have an
intermediate phenotype with a normal leaf shape then I would kind of maybe
assume that to be true also but um ABC is such a tiny small leaf I wouldn't see
a benefit of mixing those two kinds together hey I just wanted to point
something out to you for a little bit of a different perspective when you say
mutant breeders we're all mutant breeders right I mean if you're breeding
mutations everything oh yeah definitely something that I've tried to get across
before and I've got into many of arguments because people do not like to
hear that yeah it's not not to argue with you it's just to you know to kind
of make a point for for those that are listening I mean we're talking about
mutations on the episode everything that we see every every representation of
every trait is a result of some form of mutation right and we're looking at what
one given trait but there's different versions of the traits we are looking at
the observable phenotypes of mutations right so I think my point was 100% like
my point really was that like all all breeding is mutation breeding right
that's what I always try to tell people everything is a mutant so they don't
like they don't like to believe that the breeding is about stacking different
mutations together right I mean it's like you know it's like the even you
know the cannabinoid pathway or the cannabinoid profile it's a series of a
series of traits and so when we stack together different mutations in any
given trait that's what yields this like altered outcome right for this thing
that we were observed as phenotype but really it's like you know to get the
the variance is all we're doing is stacking different mutations in a given
pathway right and I like kind of reminds me of the whole and like when I was
studying my ideas like the idea of sorry pan genomics it's something that's kind
of up-and-coming in the whole genomic world which is essentially having
multiple forms for a reference genome instead of the world of having one
single reference genome for a species is over that's just not realistic it's
you know it can't continue a more realistic approach is that like you know
we have a reference that also you know reveals and you know you can update it
and show the different allelic states like the different expression of genes
right so hypothetically and you know in the future when we have better computing
and better sequencing and everything like you could have you know sequence you
know hundreds of different cultivars and have you know one kind of reference
that has the different like varieties of the different expressions within that
kind of like reference so just the idea of pan genomics is really cool something
I have been kind of looking into it's still really in the infancy stages but
huge potential and huge you know implications for the future yeah it's
kind of like the thousand genomes project right I mean when we first
sequenced the human genome you know we had the genome of one individual right
like it doesn't really inform us a hell of a lot it was like a white guy too so
it's like you know having the gene the genetic code of one dude doesn't really
teach us anything about like the genetic variation genetic variability that exists
in the species right and I kind of feel like we're at that point in time with
cannabis with the relatively few deeply sequenced genomes that we have we're
really you know tip of the iceberg kind of thing we're really only seeing like a
little bit of the story about what's gonna be obviously a much much more
complex thing right once we have deeper sequencing of more plants yeah that also
like brings me on to the whole idea of tissue culture sorry like I I recently
started doing tissue culture like with new phases of my PhD that I've been
working on and essentially from from conferences that I've been watching
research that I've been doing and even just seeing with my you know own personal
experiences it's almost seeming like every single cultivar will need it like
specific media media is like the the thing that they instead of having to go
through like photosynthesis they get all the nutrients supplied with them and so
you know we term it as the media so it's looking like in this media we provide
the nutrients micro and macro and then different concentrations and you know
one media works for one strain or sorry cultivar I keep using it don't use the
wrong term a cultivar might not work for another and it just goes to show you
that there's there's some sort of genetic difference some sort of
difference going on but if we were able to like sequence a lot more and have
that information available it would be a lot easier to say you know make these
kind of media specific for certain you know cultivars and and that goes for all
plants not even just cannabis right so the idea of pan genomics and having like
all those different you know possibility possible genes expressed in like one
reference is you know super super valuable and so much can be done with it
so something very exciting for the future
definite sorry um no that is definitely something that you know getting past the
purple cush vanola and I think you know the handful of other samples there's
also the Jamaican lion were we definitely have a limited set of
reference genomes that get referenced in all of the literature and not all but in
most of the literature in cannabis and it'll be very nice to see when more of
these data sets get brought online and get used for actual you know broadening
the reference set because like Ryan said there's there's more to the genome of
cannabis than what exists in purple cush and a good example of that is Brian had
also mentioned Judith booths work on terpene synthase genes and in her 2017
paper I think she looked at finola and found like nine terpene synthase genes
this is you know I could be wrong here but this is just off the top of my head
and then in the purple cush found something like 30 and so it just
indicates that if you the reference set that you use and the samples that you
use are going to change the outcomes and the more of this that we get in terms of
data sets and sample sets is the better
big pauses in the discussion today huh it's just a flow in the way they normally
do definitely high level it's really good to have you on Christian and you
Max because it's like the two of you being able to talk to somebody who's
doing breeding that's really like dedicated and focused on this particular
area and also somebody who's doing this I'm very interested in your work
Christian particularly what you you do going forward looking at how tissue
culture interacts with the the somatic sort of changes that happen there that's
very interesting as well as adding on this epigenetic layer it's something
that's just under research and under discovered or under explained in cannabis
and unfortunately until more papers come out like you know if you do a review of
the literature unfortunately it's just inundated with medical literature on the
epigenetic effects of cannabis consumption and there's it's almost
impossible to find good literature on epigenetics of the cannabis plant itself
and I'm totally interested in hearing more that you have to say about that
understanding that you're still doing the research and you know have to have
to do more research but anything you have to say on that subject is super
interesting that means so much to hear you say that
and everything like it really means a lot yeah you know I'm trying to help the
community like the cannabis community and then you know it's just nice to have
somebody acknowledge it and also just like thank you guys for having me on and
just kind of like having your perspective of things because I'm a
student right I'm my heads in a book most of the time like I did a bit of
growing like for my phase one but now I'm just working like in tissue culture
I've done a little bit of growing like since legalization but very minimal
compared to some of you guys who have years of years experience so it's really
cool to like hear your sides of things and your thinking perspectives so thank
you so much for having me on it's really really cool that we can share each
other's like perspective of things so it's really great to share that's
awesome yeah and so yeah it's really cool to be able to bring on area experts
who you know this paper it definitely it caught all of our eyes I know max posted
it up on Instagram early on I had posted it and lost it and then found it again
so it's and Ryan surprised us all the night by bringing you on as a special
guest so it's cool to have two special guests who really do know the this area
so thank you both for coming on guys thanks huh yeah honestly I think it's
it's a really cool kind of unraveling of events to see really when I first you
know kind of showed the world what you know the freak show wasn't all that
there was a lot of a lot of a lot of hate a lot of you know kind of
reluctancy to even accept you know having anything like that and now
there's people that are actively breeding it growing for medicine using
it for cancer turning it into RSO people who just you know enjoy it as you know
kind of a craft in its own it's kind of emerging I see people really interested
in mutants and excited to see where it builds from here because it's just
getting started like from from what I'm seeing is we're gonna see more
morphologies we're gonna see more leaf shape diversity we're gonna see unique
mutants that didn't exist before and become you know available to the public
which is really neat yeah I think this is really there's always been a little
bit of a niche you know there was the duck foot there have been other sort of
leaf morphology mutants but I really feel like it's developed its own lane as
an area not just of like commercial
exploitation I don't mean that like that was like I don't mean in a bad way but
it's not just for commercial purposes but like I feel like scientifically the
fact that people have identified these and you know hopefully we can actually
get this material into the hands of some researchers who can do some of the
sequencing or you know do it ourselves on sort of a community-based level it
would be really nice to not just have these go for their you know their
definite value and what they've developed into in terms of a sort of like
commercial commodity but also as a incredibly valuable scientific resource
because we can like we've been talking about if we have the populations in
terms of the parents the offspring and do the breeding programs with the
intention of like seeing how these different traits combined together and
breed out in different populations we can actually understand a lot more about
the plant on a deep level and these are like incredibly valuable scientific
resources that and you know Ryan pointed out their distinct varieties
which is something that is underappreciated I think by people who
just look at it is like a novelty like these aren't just novelties these also
have scientific value and potential differentiation in terms of nomenclature
and characterization of varieties
definitely I think that the you know research potential is actually kind of
overlooked because in a lot of other fields some of these mutations are
extremely valuable for understanding how the functions of you know cellular
functions are working when you take out one thing they're intentionally doing
that usually creating transgenic plants taking out the gene here adding a gene
here and that's the actual premise of how they find out how that leaf shape is
created how they find out what's the function of these serrations what's the
function of all the internal processes of a leaf and yeah they definitely could
be used in the same exact context for cannabis and it could kind of come full
circle because the people that are doing the other research could benefit off of
our research as well. Totally and earlier Ryan had kind of mentioned and
you've kind of just hinted at like mutagenesis breeding is something that
is it's been going on for a long time and in particular I've mentioned him a
couple of times on different talks that I've done here on future cannabis
project but Herman Nelson L he was the director of the Sevlov Experimental
Breeding Institute for the Swedish Seed Association and he he did extensive
mutagenesis research and breeding with barley all the way back in the 1920s and
I think they even went as far as to like I think they mutated every single
gene and like characterized the expression and variation in the
population and it's one of the most extensive research projects that went on
back then it's very interesting I have to go back and look at it but it's it's
a subject that's definitely worth looking into and understanding kind of
like the deep history of how this type of breeding is done because there's
definitely the the GMO side of things and the CRISPR side of things but then
there's just like fucking x-rays and like x-raying seeds and shit like that
and so checking that stuff out and Colchicine the different things that
people are doing with that like there's a lot of areas of mutagenic breeding
both natural like what you guys have done where you're just identifying
mutations within hybrids that you've created and then these more intentional
mutagenic breeding methods yeah so mutagenic mutagenesis sorry is usually
reserved for like inbreeding species or plants that don't have a lot of genetic
variation I think that we've seen the discussion today and Christians paper
that you know we're always we're always creating variation in cannabis right like
or mutations in cannabis they're there they're an ongoing process let's and
it's just kind of like it I think it's more about shuffling through the genome
to find mutant versions rather than having to necessarily induce mutations
there's something called but we what we call mutation breeding in in in the real
plant breeding world is like you know you'll take like call it a thousand
seeds and you soak you soak them in a chemical like EMS which is I think it's
like it was EMS it's like if ethanol methyl sulfonate or something like that
but essentially what it is a compound or a chemical that causes mutations
causes DNA changes and so the idea is that you soak a shitload of seeds
usually they do it in like a selfing species so like for example Arab adopts
this like you've you soaked a bunch of seed it's you get mutations that happen
randomly throughout the genome but they you know the chances of hitting the same
mutation on two homologous chromosomes or the two chromosome pairs in the plant
is like really really low so usually what you do is you grow the plant you
grow those treated seeds out and you let the plant set seat because rabbit off it
rabid ops's naturally self's and then you screen f2 population looking for
plants that have weird phenotypes that are in that 25% class in the f2
generation where you get you know two copies of the of that mutant allele
coming back together in the f2 you you know so usually when when we go about
doing that kind of stuff it's it's in it it's in a gene pool that is really
really quite rigid and there's not a lot of mutations from which to go in and
select I don't know if we really need to do that in cannabis because there is
such a high rate of mutation or at least there's a rate of you know there's all
these different alleles right like we've been saying over the last few
weeks like again because it's not we get out crosser cannabis doesn't purge these
mutations they kind of just get buried in the genome in in the in the
heterozygous state and we only see the cause as of that phenotype when we get
two copies of those genes coming back together so anyway there's a little
thing on EMS breeding and mutations that's really really interesting stuff
and I appreciate you bringing that all oh and kind of speaking about it my I
guess input on it is like using EMS and stuff I mean I think I read a paper
recently where it's like we've used it and we've been doing it using UV x-ray
like you guys said to create like new phenotypes and stuff the recent paper I
read was like the worry that other mutations are kind of getting created
while they not may not be expressed they kind of exist within that genome so it's
kind of because right like when you're using their immunogenesis your EMS like
you're just hoping for a chance at the mutations land and do a good thing but
you're not sure what other effects or other mutations could have occurred
that's where it kind of CRISPR kind of comes in and you know if we're able to
actually precisely you know etta genes or do something I think looking into
mutations really valuable and then you know once we understand mutations like
and CRISPR continues to be developed like once we know what the mutation does
either we can you know silence it or activate it I know there's cast systems
for that so it's a really really cool things a lot of people worry about like
GMOs like Oh inserting DNA inserting like foreign DNA oh it's like you know
people still are worried about that but like CRISPR casts which one I think 9a or
something or 9i there's different casts versions essentially you can activate or
deactivate so you're not actually inserting or you know doing anything of
that you're just kind of turning on or off a gene essentially which can have
you know huge phenotypic effects and changes which would be you know amazing
if we were able to find which genes we could you know silence or activate and
you know then benefit from the phenotypic effects inducing random
mutations works but it's just like a longer and harder process but I mean
it's kind of what breeding is breeding is a lot and long process I mean future
tools and biotechnology will definitely has and is going to continue to assist
breeding but it's still very tedious and still you know involves a lot of work
with finding those right phenotypes but I guess like a big thing to do with this
and with like mutations and genetics is just like the future so bright I think
just being in this field and you know doing my research you know I definitely
very very good feeling about the future and the technology that's coming out and
being used and the applications of it so yeah I did a quick question for you
Christian when you guys wrote the paper on the holy banana I mean honey banana
excuse me was was it suffering from any kind of loss of vigor when you started
that's or did you have a baseline of sorry you're kind of cutting out there
but I think I got most of your questions I think you're just asking how was the
health of the mother plant when we took our samples correct yeah okay so I'm
gonna assume that's that's what I heard um yeah no we didn't see any issues with
it in fact like the reason why we chose that mother plant I think we had a
choice of like up to five I think there's five mother plants at that
facility the reason we chose it was just because of its incredible growth and
it's credible just vigor just if you see the paper you can actually see a picture
of the mother plant it was gigantic and actually just kept growing from that
point on eventually we had to put it into like a garbage bin size pot
essentially literally just got a garbage bin and filled it up with soil and
transplanted into that eventually it got up to I think 10 or 11 feet tall it
was an insane mother plant so one of the reasons we picked it was just because of
the you know it's traits and it was also very like tall growing which I think was
another reason we we wanted to use that plant because we're kind of looking at
like the accumulation of mutations right so the taller of the plant and theory in
there you know accumulated maybe more and it'd be much better to look at than
like a short something if we're looking at like an accumulation of mutations
right there's more space between the cells you know there's more chances for
those mutations to be there and appear so yeah I hope that answers your
question yeah thank you man I just sent Peter a copy of the picture from the
study
he may not be at his computer or phone but he's got it I can't running back
from the kitchen hold on no worries did you text it yeah I think so
let me check did it not go yeah I texted it oh it's processing sorry okay it just
went through all right hold on queuing it up and actually there were some
questions earlier in the YouTube chat just about like and this is not
necessarily about mutations but I think about just vigor and things like that of
like taking a clone from a clone from a clone from a club like if all your mom
stock for 20 years has been all clone is there any sort of issues around that
yeah yeah no that's exactly kind of like what really inspires this project
is that there's certain mother plants that are kept for you know decades if
not like longer a it's crazy amount of times and usually that's done by you
know taking a clone from a mother and redoing that over and over every you
know around two years I think is the mark that people around there obviously
every breeders different but so you know just like just so taking those
yeah it's just it's it's very valuable and sorry I lost my train of thought it
happens on club us man you get your halfway through the worst is the
multitask I was like looking at pictures cuz I was trying to see if I have any
of those really really tall pictures to show you like 11 foot pictures so
talking and then looking at pictures is totally threw me there I'd say yeah
generation generation generation yes end up having you know a gradual decline
that's why a lot of you know tissue culture facilities are talking about
cryo preservation of you know the first clone generation and being able to put
that away and then come back to that because it doesn't have you know so many
subsequent mutations or possible you know viral load etc yeah exactly and I
especially the whole concept of like the accumulating mutations is a concept has
been looked into and other species and is known so the theory is you know if
there's no sexual recombination or you just keep taking these clones you're
essentially keep accumulating these mutations and they have the potential
effect to cause more likely to cause a negative effect than a beneficial effect
so yeah this project was really kind of looking at that and then I guess like
you know the practical side was like promoting a best practice that if you're
doing this like constant renewal of your mother's maybe instead of you know
taking it right from the apical take it somewhere more in like the middle or
basal somewhere that isn't maybe as like disrupted with pruning or you know
environmental like wind or or you know something that just seems to be more
kind of left alone than something like the apical where it's constantly getting
pruned like the eight on the oxen like the plant growth regulator like the
hormones inside the plant are constantly kind of getting like shocked essentially
right a plant's not naturally supposed to be constantly getting pruned and
taking clonal cuttings from so so who knows what that kind of effect also has
within the plant right so so my theory like right I don't expect you know every
grower to start just going for basil or middle clones all right but but for
mother plants and if you're looking at these really long time periods I think
that's where it starts to really potentially have a beneficial effect
especially if you're trying to preserve your elite mother right like you know
you might want to do everything you can to make that puppy last as long as
possible right so because sometimes when she's his mother some people lose their
complete genetics with it right so so yeah that's that's kind of my thoughts
on that and Trevor I have the image ready to go it's up cool so yeah that's
the image from the study of the honey banana and kind of I think it's the
graphic that shows the it illustrates kind of what you're saying where it
shows the the I almost said viral load but the mutation at the level at the top
the middle and the bottom and so it describes that sort of or gives a visual
visualization of those differences and where people may want to select from
for you know maintaining their own clonal stock like an interesting if that
image is still up as something like we originally expected to see like a linear
increase of mutations from bottom middle to top but what we ended up seeing was
that they're slightly more you know we found slightly more variation mutations
at the bottom in the middle and then we hypothesized and theorized and stuff but
I think one of the best things we've kind of like my lab stuff we just agreed
upon was that just the way that it was maintained a lot of you know growers
maintain their mothers where they just trimmed and complete basil area as seen
in that image so with that in mind that's probably what kind of caused a
slightly higher mutations found or variations found than the middle the
kind of elaborate also on that like image the Venn diagram there if it might
be kind of confusing I remember the first time I saw it I was confused
honestly but so it's like the total amount of variations that we found where
you know the center is like what's shared and then when you're looking at
like the separate colors on the outer edges that's like unique variations that
we found within the genome and so essentially we use the reference genome
as kind of like an out group to essentially allow us to see the
variations because something I had a hard time myself was like the term
variation verse mutation right I don't want to be calling something a mutation
was just slightly a very so one thing that we couldn't like because we're
looking at a single species what we can say is like you know the changes from
middle to top at least that we can confidently say those are mutations
right we see you know we sequence the middle DNA and we have found a bunch of
variations differences within the top sample which which leads to the had to
have been mutations right within a single species right if you're if we
were just be comparing you know are my sequences of the sequences we dug to the
reference genome doesn't really give us much but because we're using the
reference gene was more of like an out group we can kind of see with a story of
what's happening within the mutations where you know you see there is a big
jump from the middle to the top so yeah any other questions feel free there any
did you guys try possibly taking clones off of plants that were younger so that
they hadn't aged as long as these mothers that the samples were taken off
of to see if possibly there was a smaller level of mutation on the plant
based on the actual age of the plant that's great question something
definitely we wanted to look into with phase two with this phase we were pretty
much just kind of looking at just identifying like genetic variety and you
know differences within a single plant this mother is also was a kind of good
for what we kind of wanted to go for or it wasn't too young or kind of too old it
was but when we took the sample the samples it was around like a year and a
half so we felt like that was appropriate age anything younger I don't
know like the idea of mother plant is that you know that you keep them longer
than a year longer than you know an annual species normally supposed to be a
life for so and then that's kind of like we also wanted to investigate that kind
of side of things right like when you start taking an annual and push it you
know to make it live longer than it you know normally naturally does you know
what is that also doing something because currently not really no no one
really knows right it's still under investigation so it would be cool to see
like a younger mother plant and an older mother plant and see that comparison but
for age kind of deal we were looking at potentially like a generational thing
where we're gonna grow full-grown plants for a few months depending we were kind
of still figuring it out unfortunately the facility kind of closed on us before
we had all the final details on the second phase but we're gonna do multiple
generations of looking at just top only clones and bottom only kind of clones
like basil you know middle area clones and seeing the kind of differences
between the generations and you know seeing if as you keep going is it really
gonna have a you know negative impact or what's really the impact something I'd
also that kind of reminds me of bananas actually they are propagated because
they're seedless they're sterile they're propagated from tissue culture and in
tissue culture with bananas they actually throw away and like start from
fresh material and tissue after around five subcultures in tissue culture so I
think they also acknowledge that you know as you keep repeatedly you know
taking a clone and you know propagating it again there is you know some
potential negative effect that could occur and you know it's something to to
be aware of it's also something I also kind of interest I wonder how much the
you know industry kind of side of things knows like no little secrets that they
can't like keep from the public and from like you know competitors and stuff like
that I know cannabis can be a competitive industry and then you know I
wonder you know how much knowledge is out there but you know companies are
keeping for themselves because I mean I get it and especially with genetics where
people really feel attached to that kind of material so yeah I definitely
think there's some people out there with a lot of knowledge that you know I wish
I had my hands on but yeah no there's definitely really good people out there
and they're doing some great stuff with genetics definitely and I mean the fact
that you and Ryan are on here together it's a two people up in Canada who are
able to do some of this research and source it these genetics and you know
he's got some in the system it's it's very cool and hopefully more you know
hopefully you get funding and support for your research because that way you
can do more and really investigate some of these things because I know myself I
would be very interested to see different pests or pathogens and what
the mutation load is in those types of plants if you have hoplite and viroid
infected plant material on a genetic level what are you seeing in terms of
the viral or the not just the viral load obviously that's good to know but also
seeing how it's interacting with the DNA and the RNA of the plant itself and try
to sort of like track that because really for a long time this discussion
focused around one the misnomer that we discussed earlier but more around this
idea of dudding and there was this phenomena where and I think it's a
distinct phenomena where plants were just showing up and they weren't
producing the way that they had people had kept clones for years and years and
even if there's the sort of natural drift that are there I go the natural
sort of variation that you see from clone generation to generation and that
you've described here there's also something over and above that was going
on which is the impact of this byroid on the plant and now we have a better
understanding of it but for years these two things were also kind of linked and
these concepts were connected and it wasn't thought necessarily to be an
outside pathogen but instead just a you know effect of long-term cloning of the
plant and so it would be interesting to see very specifically though how the
virus impacts these clone only or mother plants over time.
Yeah I completely agree is actually something I was quite interested and I
remember even bringing it up with one of my advisors but there's only so much I
can do I remember talking to him like oh this is interesting like people aren't
really looking into viruses and this could be like you know another
explanation for why people see their clones start to deteriorate and like you
know lose plant vigor I was like oh this is you know cool but it's you know I've
got you know two other major phases with you know a bunch of other things on my
plate so I wish I had you know another clone of myself or something so I could
you know keep doing research and keep doing other projects because yeah that's
a big topic I think is really kind of unexplored currently in cannabis and I
feel like you know they're just still even discovering her and like viruses
and you know people haven't really dove deep into it and yeah that's definitely
a big concern like I know currently I have a few samples that are getting sent
out for sequencing and I'm gonna gonna try to push and look to see if I can see
if there's any sort of like viruses that I can detect within like our lab because
I know a lot of viruses don't even like show some sort of phenotype until further on.
Yeah no that's definitely a phenomenon the dutting thing it popped up but there
was the virus was in plants and they were spread around for a long time
without people necessarily noticing it and there are people who have talked
about having it and being able to sort of through different plant health
regiments improve the health of the plant and sort of like at least produce
sort of like a viable plant that sort of overcomes the some of the dutting
phenotypes but it's an incredible amount of work and it's one of those
things that the fact that we had the plants it wasn't expressing in so many
different plants it's spread around like wildfire and so at least in the
California recreational market it's everywhere so if you want samples come
to California I've heard it's up in Canada too so I think we're good here
it's everywhere I've seen it in Oklahoma and Missouri as well yeah it's
in it's in New Zealand I mean someone brought in a bunch of seeds over there
and it ended up in their facility and they didn't even bring in clones so this
thing definitely travels well what you're touching on there Ryan is also
people always ask the question can it be transmitted through a seed yeah it can
it's looking like somewhere between five and ten percent of of the seeds that
come from an infected plant will still show it it's been kind of reported that
it's not trying to get it through seed but more and more I'm hearing from people that are
starting clean facilities and ended up with it too and they're starting from
seed so it's definitely getting in there somehow curly beat curly tops
about that same percentage through seed also so I don't see why they would
believe that this these specific ones are finding in cannabis are solely
different than the other ones are they're gonna be passing to the seed at
some point somehow and then you're in trouble if you can't if it's not gonna
show on the plant for a while so that's why they're late and viral it's they're
not gonna show until they decide to show under certain conditions and now it
could be too late you've passed it to everything in your facility even though
you started from seed yeah I I was just gonna confirm what you had said Ryan
I've heard that number of five to ten percent as well from people who have
done apparently I mean this is from I can't really say who it is because they
told me in like a private message but they work with a firm that does
scientific research and they they said that they were seeing five to ten percent
of seeds with hoplite and transmission yeah I mean even tissue culture is not
perfect right especially with something that's blatant and so these these
facilities really need to be incorporating nucleic acid tests where
the you know PCR type test to to show whether these things are actually truly
free of free of iroids and I think that in the future
sure you know certified seed certified seed made with plants that are tested
specifically for the by right right before they even before they ever had
off into pollination and then you know sub testing the seed lots to come out
just to confirm that everything is clean I think people are gonna demand that
well how could you not right I mean we we all know the impact that this has the
economic impact this has and how much it can really fuck up your your your
facility right if it sneaks in and moves through everything talk about THC drop
and you know like these things can again this thing it it doesn't even have a
gene it just essentially comes in at many copies of it and that's like we're
talking about before with those variegated plants like you know it's
essentially a parasite that's living within the plant and so it's diverting
all of your resources from the plant could be using for its own you know its
own life cycle and so that they just really don't perform as well when
they're infected so I think it's really important that people start you know
these these nursery providers they start certifying their shits clean not just
saying that it's clean there's a whole bunch of tissue culture labs that they
operate without new DNA technology right and what's the point of doing all this
cleanup if you're not monitoring stuff to make and and auditing your group your
you know the sale Sega this company in Canada I know they do like they're
they're taking samples from the clones the clones that are going out to
customers just to confirm right they do a random sampling from within batch even
though they're sampling all the way through they do it right again at the
end before the clones go out because again it's just it's that important as a
nursery partner you know you can't be fucking up the business of the people
that you're supposed to supposed to be supposed to be supporting right so and
that's that's where the future is exciting again where you know PCR
testing and being able to test your material and stuff is only getting
cheaper and cheaper as the years go on you know sequencing a full genome used
to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars you know not even too many years ago but
you know now you know I can go out and get a full genome sequence for you know
around thousand dollars and I'm pretty sure even around 500 it's literally like
only getting cheaper and cheaper every you know quarter and every half year so
it's exciting let's do it man
hey Ryan I have a question you were mentioning variegation as well I guess
I've always looked at plants with variegation as probably having a virus
just curious is that general consensus is when you see variegation in plants
that it is you know we I the idea back in the day was it was like a mosaic virus
or whatnot I would say likely not again I don't know if you were listening
earlier on but we we talked about variegation being the result there's
different types of variegation for one but the variation we see mostly in
cannabis it seems to mostly occur from mutant chloroplast genes essentially
there's there's pigment genes on the chloroplast that are responsible for the
chlorophyll and if those genes get damaged you end up with a population of
chloroplast within your cell that have functional copies of the chloroplast of
the chlorophyll gene and non-functional copies of the chlorophyll gene and if by
random through cell division you only end up with chloroplasts that have this
dysfunctional chlorophyll gene then that part of the plant won't produce green
pigment right and so you can get what's called a sectoral chimera or like a
specific section of the plant that has this different DNA state which is why
they call it a chimera and it yeah they essentially don't produce pigment but if
you weren't listening you might want to go back and and listen to that part on
the SCP YouTube channel because we went into it a little bit follow-up question
how do you listen to recorded clubhouse chats so it's this is co-broadcast the
future cannabis project also broadcast the club the discussion on YouTube so
if you go to YouTube and you look for the future cannabis project channel
number two then you'll find today's topic and I'll send you all message you
a link to where you can watch the first three hours okay thank you hey I've
gone how are you I didn't see earlier I was looking to invite you but I didn't
see it I just figured you weren't coming today how are you doing I am great I was
trying to finish work I think we're finally there ish mostly so yeah I was
thinking about you guys and I've been in and out of the room and I absolutely
love the conversation and I'm super happy that Christian has joined because
I think a lot of the topics you guys have been going over and it was really I
just I love that this is the level of conversation that we're finally having
because it's so nice I'm so grateful to future cannabis project and Trevor and
you Ryan and everybody else also on the panel because I feel like this level of
conversation just really it's like super stimulating for my mind and I'm so
grateful that we're we've been having it over the past you know chunk of time and
it's gonna keep going and I think a lot of these topics are super important and
I've seen a lot of weird mutations and I've seen a lot of the stuff you guys
have spoken on and that was fun for me to kind of tie the observations I was
actually flipping through my photos for a second trying to find some of the
pictures of when I've had to deal with variegation in the breeding projects and
I've noticed a lot of the time that happens more with type 3 plants in my
experience like I'm feeling like there's a lot a lot of that and I've even seen
it with multiple different you know different lines and different times and
different places and different breeders and I've seen it a lot in the past few
years actually so it's really interesting and I think it's really
beautiful I hope that at some point it's like we get to I always was looking to
see if there's a difference in the finished flower or like resin production
or like there's ever any nuances you know but I've never really seen anything
like that and then in the nursery space I've definitely seen during germinating
seeds I see a lot of weird things and that's the other thing I was trying to
flip through and look for was some like my weird seedling photos and I know
somebody mentioned the twinning and I've also seen a lot of like the three leaf
clover and four leaf clover kind of style where it doesn't have the two
cotyledons but it has like three or four or you know some sort of weird shaping
of the of any of the first true leaves or anything along those lines so I'm
curious if other people have seen some of those other strange things and I'm
actually curious what Christian's perception is because I've been trying
to follow the and all anybody Ryan everybody's is like the long-term storage
really does seem to be a major issue for our community and I think cryo is really
interesting and it's like but it's kind of watching the long-term storage space
with tissue culture and how we can preserve some of these things especially
the things now that we're dealing with the hop slate and thyroid I really think
that bad mother rooms are kind of like an epidemic in our industry and have
been for a really long time just within this space so I'd be curious on that and
then also I had a question about the you know there's other sorts of mutations
that I feel like I saw with the triploid and so I'm curious if anybody
else has seen some strange things happening especially with the when the
plants were immature I was seeing a lot of strange behavior and it was another
thing I was looking for in my photos that's it
Eddie and I'm done to speak about like the preservation and stuff like that
yeah it's it's exciting but it's a challenge I think like one of my gut
instinct is kind of just saying is that cannabis is just generally so
heterozygous so trying to do long-term preservation is kind of hard when the
genetics is already kind of not too stable right there's there's a lot of
heterozygous elements and then a lot of repeat like genes and stuff like that
and it just creates a kind of not too stable gene essentially and then I guess
preserving that and like you know when you do have a good you know genotype you
definitely want to preserve that and cryo is looking really interesting my
person like my advisor is definitely looking into it more and I believe he's
released a paper on it not positive on that one but yeah
presence preserving genes is crazy um it's really important to use like tissue
culture gets really kind of thrown around as like the solution for keeping
your your genetics pure and genetics you know stored and in a safe environment
but like you know tissue culture isn't perfect either one whole expensive and
in the very manual and like labor-intensive but you know research is
kind of looking and seeing that you know putting a plant in that like a new
environment might be inducing a lot more mutation might like increase the
mutation rate obviously results and then data still too early to really say
confidently but you know research is still going on we're still looking in
into it but yeah I think like preserving genetics is very huge another
big thing that I know my advisor is advocate of is as gene banks like for
for all over the world and I know he's even had like struggles trying to even
create a gene bank in Canada and you know it's it's something we need to do
and start to you know acknowledge and be aware especially of the viruses as well
and then start you know preserving genetics and genes and everything oh
sorry sorry Ryan yeah I'd be curious about the paper it's kind of what I was
gonna ask you is if you wouldn't mind sharing if you do know it's available to
to review I would love to take a look at it and then also the other part is the
we're seeing in the hops late in the byroid not in our populations but I work
with a lab that were tests through medicinal genomics and we're seeing that
results coming back negative and then obviously with the latent thing like
later on things are showing up and there's a different viral load I would
be curious also like if you know somebody that tests for that or I'm not
sure if that's something any of the labs I worked with do and how we do all these
things to manipulate plants all along same with like even feminization is it
like I don't know how that would even be sorry Abby on you were breaking up at
the end there I couldn't hear exactly what you were saying
while we're waiting to see if she comes back Christian can you tell us what's
what's your PI's name what's the the advisor in your program Max Jones Andrew
Maxwell P Jones but you probably just find him under Max Jones the University
and yeah yeah I believe I have the paper up right now cryopreservation of
13 commercial cannabis sativa genomes using in vitro nodal X plants so they
used in vitro and for 13 different commercial so he's the corresponding
author for that so if anyone has any detailed questions then feel free is
that the the paper where they're using those V cryoplates they got these like
little they're like little aluminum bars that they're freezing the marathon so
I'm pretty sure yeah I think that's one for me yeah it's good to know I mean
while we're talking mutations something we haven't touched on today
by day as wrong which is a chemical it's very often used for as a site as a
in cannabis tissue culture is known in other species to increase mutation rates
so there are challenges and when we had Connor was actually in here Connor
Stevens was in a couple of weeks ago and he was talking about some of the work he
was doing down at Cornell he does tissue culture down at Cornell and he tries to
do his tissue culture with as little hormone hormones as possible just because
they do influence morphology but they also have the potential to be you know
increasing mutation rates so if you're trying to destabilization or not
stabilization sorry you're trying to do like a preservation step where you're
keeping genes around for a long or plants around for a long time you
probably don't want to be like using mutagenic chemicals on them right so
something to keep in mind for people that are in the TC space oh looks like
we lost Evian well she'll be back I found that paper who should I send it to
who's interested if you can send it to Peter then he'll put it up on the or at
least the name of it up on or a picture of it sorry up on the YouTube and then
all the viewers can check it out yeah and I know I have a copy of it too I was
going through looking at it earlier on the show just because when we jumped on
the topic of tissue culture it happens to be in my folder on that subject so
yeah very interesting work being done there Michael did you have a question
you wanted to chime in on so you raise your hand yeah I did thanks for thanks
for bringing me up and interesting room I think one of the first times that
I've been in on it but you guys were talking about inducing mutations and I'm
just wondering you you may have touched on this earlier and I just joined late
so but what about using I've run into some old texts using colchicine as a
mutagenic agent like soaking the seeds in it before before germination I was
wondering if any of you guys had any experience or thoughts on using
colchicine thanks yes the culture scene is what's called a myotic spindle fiber
inhibitor so when cells are dividing you probably might have seen like I
think they even have it like the Big Bang Theory of like opening credits
there's a picture of like these cells dividing right and you have these kind
of like they look like latitude lines on a globe that form across the cell and
those are like you can kind of think of it like maybe like a pulley system or a
zipline system that the chromosomes attached to and they get they they
actually travel along these spindle fibers towards the pole ends so when
when the DNA ends up at opposite ends of the cells it then splits down the metal
and you get those daughter cells colchicine inhibits the formation of
those fibers those spindle fibers and so what happens is the chromosomes can't
like segregate properly during mitosis or when the DNA is when the DNA doubles
in the cells divide it's really good it's so what what is really used for is
changing the ploidy level right so if you want to go to like a polyploid plant
that's the technique that you would use when you're doing mutation reading they
use something called ethyl methanosulfonate or EMS and that's like an
alkylating agent that actually gets in and actually causes mutations at the
genetic level so that's probably the type of chemical that you'd be thinking
about it should be noted that these things are incredibly toxic and like you
definitely shouldn't be handling these chemicals if you don't know what the
fuck you're doing because like you can really you can really fuck yourself up
or even kill yourself you know what I mean like I mean it's not gonna kill you
on the day but you can definitely increase your cancer rates and stuff
like that so really proper lab processes should always be used when you're using
those kind of chemicals thank you for saying that Ryan I'm sorry Michael I'll
just give I just wanted to say really quickly that I think that I've had some
really powerful conversations with breeders recently who I realized were
actually using you know when their feminization reversal that you know it's
like those are the same thing you know we're using chemicals and I was realizing
that a lot of people maybe don't fully understand that those things need to be
handled very very carefully even at a small scale and are incredibly toxic to
the environment so I really hope that people who are out there doing any sort
of feminized breeding or any of these things that are like you know it's like
really please follow the like SDS and all those things because it's a little
bit devastating for me when I hear that maybe some people don't even understand
that and they do it I'm like oh god yeah thanks a lot for those really good
explanations I appreciate thanks thanks for contributing Josh did you have
something that you wanted to chime up and I know see for your hand on I
invited yep feel free to ask away or make a point hey yeah no I just noticed
a few things that people were mentioning there especially with the culture scene
there I know that there's people that are using things like the Rizalin now
which is slightly less toxic but again like you said you know stuff that should
be used in a lab and a controlled environment with people that are trained
to know what they're doing but Christian something you'd mentioned earlier about
tissue culture I found really interesting about having different media
for different cultivars and I'd done some work with tissue culture in the
past as well and I found with five different cultivars that I needed five
different hormonal concentrations to induce you know the same effect that I
was looking for whether it be you know inducing callus induction or you know
rooting or whatnot but yeah I just found that really interesting and yes
bring that up but with generationally like old plants that have been cloned and
cloned I find in my own experience at least I found using like organic system
seems to really kind of bring those plants back to life and taking clones
from them after they've been in that organic system it seemed to really do
very well I've got some bedrock buggy that's pretty old as far as you know
when it first came up here to Canada and like I just finished a crop of it and
like it's phenomenal so so I mean like I think there's definitely something to be
said with you know how the the plants are taken care of and you know the you
know epigenetic changes that can happen depending on the environment and you
know like unless it grows haven't always been the most you know standard kind of
places that have you know consistent environment so you know having those
dramatic swings you know even seasonally I think probably have a significant
effect on the epigenetics and kind of contributing to that clonal variation
over time yeah that's it thanks appreciate that yeah that's definitely
an interesting kind of topic and you know subject to investigate is you know
the media's for the different cultures and from what I've seen it's it's like
you said you have to pretty much make a new media for every single different
type that you have which when you think about there's different like you know
thousands of different genotypes it seems very intimidating but again you
know bringing it back to the hopeful future stuff like machine learning I
think has like a huge you know role and you know as it can be a very very
valuable tool and actually one of my colleagues is using machine learning
right now to essentially trying to right now he's manipulating I believe
sucrose percentages anywhere like from like 0.1 all the way to like 5% and
essentially trying to use machine learning and trying to create
experiments with that and you know fine-tune the tool to essentially
produce better results but you know in a future where maybe we have the genetics
and sequencing is cheaper you know we can use computers and you know analytical
machinery to essentially give us you know the answer of what kind of media to
prep or you know what macro and micronutrients to include for you know
this genotype versus that genotype so yeah it's it's a bright future it's very
interesting and very valuable so yeah I look forward to it. Yeah, macroassisted
breeding is definitely really cool I never even thought of you know looking
at it and not kind of light using you know some kind of marker assisted
selection to identify you know the the media type that you know you know a type
of cannabis would be best suited for very interesting. Yeah I feel like this
is I like your question a lot Josh because I was kind of wondering similar
pieces and how we're going to utilize these tools to move things forward I was
wondering also if anybody has seen the like did you talk earlier about dwarfism
as a potential mutation and I'm not talking about like rents or stunted but
like actual dwarfism in the plants because I've seen also a lot of those
and I don't know if it's all rudralis or like what is actually coming through
because it seems to show up differently did you guys discuss that already? We have
not we have not discussed dwarfism or auto flowering expression as like
potential mutation anomalies but that's definitely a an important area
particularly in light of I think it was Ernest Small wrote the paper a couple
years ago talking about the potential impact and implication of breeding for
dwarf traits and auto flower traits in cannabis so yeah that's definitely
something that well I don't know about the underlying genetic mechanism and
mutation that happened it does seem that some underlying mechanism that altered
the plant sensitivity to photo period changed and that's or like I think
either Christian or Ryan could explain that a little bit more articulately but
there are very big implications for the future of breeding and just you know
agronomics of cannabis. Yeah I specifically don't know exactly on
dwarfism like the genes affected or the you know the whole process involved but
I know from even my own experience I remember talking to a facility someone
who owned a facility and they were showing me like their camera systems
where they had like you know cameras for every room and they you showed me
essentially a strain that he had which was I believe it was Jack Hare which is
normally a very tall growing sativa and he had them literally a couple feet tall
that were just filled with bud and essentially I'm not sure if it was
breeding or mutation I don't think I got that detail but I mean dwarfism has such
huge potential to you know shrink that size but keep the yield you know still
high and also kind of again brings into future ideas of you know vertical
farming because at the end day like cannabis is a medicinal plant as well as
a recreational so I like to look at as a you know it's a medicine as well and the
fact that there is you know vertical farming and if we can get dwarf traits
you know in cannabis you know safely and stably then you know you're looking at
creating you know large-scale like vertical farming with dwarf genetics
that could be you know produced for medicine because the benefit of vertical
farming is it's very controlled and very very consistent and with how what we
know about you know the environment and the impacts you know keeping that very
consistent and controlled would be very good for you know maintaining a medicine
kind of deal so so dwarfism has a lot of potential but I'm not sure exactly the
whole genetic end it could be as simple as like knockout genes which would be
you know really simple and easy where you know if we had you know CRISPR Cas9
and we were able to just simply silence a gene so that dwarfism would be active
or something then you know the potential is huge and the impact and you know
everything would be massive so it's a very good question very good and you
know kind of thought process and you know idea yeah I think about it in terms
of when you say vertical farming because I visualize I mean I hope that in the
future we kind of get away from don't I don't want to get like knocked out for
this because I came from some in you know the indoor facilities right now I
would say I have a lot of wishes for them to be more sustainable and I would
love to see it go towards a more sustainable plant factory model and
that's when those smaller plants but the dwarfism could be a benefit and I know
that there's ways you can do it with like crop steering and other things but
that's a little bit more labor-intensive obviously so I'm curious because I've
been told that the auto flowers just because of unless we use CRISPR I got to
just be honest unless we use CRISPR and we're getting better with the auto flower
breedings but I also you know because of how they're bred I don't think that it's
possible to without using that sort of technology to complete to completely
like whittle out the outliers and like the phenotypic variation has gotten a
lot better over the past three years but like it's still I mean just the
variation with not of flowers is still all over the board and the THC numbers
haven't been quite hitting the mark so I think maybe with quicks or something
compared like we're bred with these different things maybe we'll have
something along those lines but Ryan I don't know if you could speak to your
ideas around dwarfism and as a mutation I guess yeah usually so usually it's a
mutation in either the gibberellin gene itself or the genes that that
produce gibberellin or the gibberellin receptors so it's kind of like you can
kind of think of it like the kind of the same way we do with STS you know with
with where we're blocking the ethylene receptor and shutting down that pathway
gibberellins are one of the five major hormones in the plant but they're really
responsible for like how tall a plant is or how stretchy a plant is right so you
ever see like these plants that they have like you know eight inches or six
to eight inches kind of in as like an inner node space between the nodes
that's like if you spray gibberellin on them they'll grow to be like 16 inches
in between nodes and in a lot of other crops I you know I know in certain other
crops at least I don't know it's a lot of other crops but they they breed
gibberellin receptor mutants so essentially that that pathway it gets
shut down and the plant loses that ability to stretch out and the phenotype
as a result is this dwarf phenotype so yeah it's it's definitely possible again
it's just screening for the mutant it's actually one of the things that we're
gonna start being able to do now that we have these genomes you know we have these
reference genomes we can start looking at at these genes and the species and
then targeting or going through population screening or doing something
called tilling or eco it's actually eco tilling but essentially what you're
doing is you're you can pull groups of plants DNA and then look for use a
genetic technique to look for a specific DNA mutation in that whole pool and so
you got a thousand plants you make like ten pools of a hundred and then you can
quickly screen a hundred plants looking for this one gene and if it's not you
know if you don't if you don't find it or you don't find your mutant version of
that gene gene in the pile that means that that hundred plants don't have that
trait and so if you you know if you do find a mutant gene then you start
dividing up your pool right instead of having a pool of a hundred you have a
pool of ten and you can essentially narrow down which plant has this
genetic mutation and then once you find the mutation then you just breed it like
we would classically into any other given line on the topic of autos autos
are like they're there they're a challenge there I think they're a
challenge partly because well you know their genetic background is such they
come from you know let's let's call it root arousal even though it might not be
but you know that it was a wild escape of a plant at one point in time and they
really were low THC low cannabinoid production even not just THC they've had
really low smell and low cannabinoid production so the only thing that's
really useful from that line is the auto trait but as you know as you're aware I
think anybody that's thought this through autos you can't keep you can't
keep cuttings of them right so this way that we have a growing plants out keeping
cuttings doing harvest selection sending samples off to the lab evaluating the
plants based on the lab results and then going back to the clone copy of the
plant that we have alive you can't do that right so you have to be able to
make you have to essentially do your breeding before you know the quality of
the plant so it really is a different way you have to approach it in a
completely different way and I think that with the really rudimentary
techniques that most cannabis breeders are using I don't think it's I think
that it's gonna be hard to improve those populations there are methods where we
can actually do there's there's things that you can do there's tricks around it
but you have to really shift your thinking in terms of how how you're
gonna execute your your breeding program and and it's really it's it's
not kind of the same way that we do it it's it's much more along the lines of
like it's much more along the lines of like how cannabis breeds naturally
really so it's just it's just a shift in the breeders way of thinking I think and
and kind of changing your expectations and your timelines but you really also
have to just change your method because you can't you can't do it the
traditional way that we do drug cannabis yeah I mean I kind of refer to it as
it's like a little bit of a pain in the ass because even if you get some of
those traits into like I know that there there's a whole bunch of the different
genetics that we've held and I'd be curious if other people have this
experience too that they just they all have a tendency to pre flower a lot of
those like early girls and quicks and things like that they're harder to keep
in the vegetative state so it's harder to do so I'd be curious how they kind of
react with with TC and I I think it's really interesting that I mean because
you can like the crop steering you can kind of steer things but if you could
breed the plants to be kind of more I mean it kind of goes to uniformity I
think that's why people do that in general is like I know I like it when
everything is like super uniform and it's not just about training sometimes
it is about genetics and like the steering of your crop essentially to
make it do what you want to do so it's really it's really interesting I see
that autos for sure like have a limited application also and I don't know Ryan
if you were on that conversation but recently I know that there was somebody
who there's like some University or something made a breakthrough with the
auto flower breeding that they've basically done something with CRISPR to
essentially make it so we are not going to have as many outliers and that they're
more stable and potentially that kind of opens it up so I know people are working
towards those ends I'd be curious if anybody knows yes so we know now the
region of the chromosome that that trade is on I think it's on I think it's on
chromosome number one actually Aurora just filed a patent on it or file us
also has a patent on that same thing it'll be interesting to see how that
whole thing plays out who tries to claim ownership of that apparently that
section of the crop or that section of the chromosome doesn't really undergo
crossing over so they patented this like huge chunk of the chromosome because you
can't like rather like for example there's a there's a gene involved on
that section of the chromosome that has to do with flowering time sorry yeah
this gene has to do with flowering time so normally you go in and you develop a
PCR test that's looking for a mutation in that specific gene but because it
doesn't go under grow crossing over like you could also use the gene next door as
a marker for it right because because again if those two genes are tied
together and they can't be separated through through a combination then you
can use either as a marker for the other right it's kind of like a reporter gene
so that that makes it a little bit easier because you can start tracking
that trait really all you want is you want that one trait in the in the drug
in the background sorry you want that one trait in a genetic background that
is otherwise all of the from the drug side of the cross right because again
we've been selecting these drug these drug plants for so long and breeding
them that we've you know we've we've nailed all the for the most part we've
nailed the genes involved in cabotite synthesis but also you know also terpene
production and and you know a whole bunch of growth characteristics and yield
and all that kind of stuff those things have largely been unselected in what
we'll call you know the autos and so unless you really know what you're doing
and you have like a breeding program that is actually really well thought
through it's gonna be hard to only move that one piece of the chromosome into a
genetic background that is otherwise like the drug plants so I think as a
whole most of the auto work has kind of been rather hit and miss you know and
it's it's the same thing happened with these CBD plants that came out you know
somebody would cross can of tonic into blue dream and then all of a sudden it
was like you know that first generation they were calling CBD blue dream but
there's nothing that they couldn't be farther from the truth right like you'd
want a CBD like CBD blue dream should be blue dream in every other trait except
CBD right it should be blue dream like across the board if you're gonna call it
CBD blue dream so and same with the autos but instead what happens is they'll
cross autoness into a cookie and do a generation like one generation removed
to make it stable for the auto trait and then they call that you know auto
cookies well like none of the plants look there's look or smell or taste
anything like cookies right so it's like again it's just this it's like I kind of
feel like it's a lot of amateur breeders don't know what they're doing they're
making seeds and capitalizing on a name to make money right whereas like to me
that's really misleading like cook you know I was I would expect if I bought
seeds called cookie autos or auto cookies right that when I grew them they
would be auto flowering and they'd they'd look and taste like cookies and
every other in every other regard right so it just takes a little bit more of a
thought well thought out breeding program with very intentional selection
to get to that point and I personally don't think that we've done a great job
of that up until now yeah I 100% I love I love this conversation it's so it's so
good because I feel like you know we're seeing leaps and bounds and things and
we're seeing a lot more genetics available that were I feel like well
thought out breeding program could be like a whole topic for one of these
breeders because it really like I've seen a lot of things and I don't think I
see that very often and I think I was asking maybe Trevor and you Ryan last
time to that maybe we need to come up with a classification of like these
different layers and levels of breeding that's actually happening because I
think a lot of people are doing different things and then a lot of
people are also just doing like seed production or you know it's a there's a
lot of different animals I think in this space I'm curious I actually I love
personally I gotta say I have a lot of love for auto flowers and I've been
really impressed with what I've seen them do over the past few years and I
think even within that amateur breeding that you know I'm not want to say it's
amateur breeding because I know some people are like super brilliant and
genius and they're like there's I know some incredible auto flower breeders and
I have a ton of respect for them because it's it is more complicated if you're
not starting you know from clonal parents so it's definitely a trickier
game and I think that there has been a lot of leaps and bounds and I'm curious
you know especially with the leaf to calyx ratio and the test results and
like the yields that are coming off of them and the uniform like there's a ton
of things and I really I really appreciate it and I hope that those
plants do get to stay in the space in some certain way because I think they're
cute and yeah I wanted to ask also about the nucleic acid with the if you were
saying for the hops latent viroid testing because my understanding is the
you know I'm seeing all these things where it's like lower it's what I was
saying when I cut out earlier is that I you know we're seeing a lot of different
results coming back from labs like our population right now is clean and I'm
super excited about that but other people that I work and consult with are
having like results come back negative and then the plants are actually testing
positive later with the latent thing and so I'd be curious because we're not
actually like not very few labs are actually testing the viral load in the
plants and when you really it's really a huge issue and I hope that people are
taking this very seriously and like starting to use we've been trying to
work out like a best practices for the industry but I you know it's definitely
like my assumption is it's going to cause mutations within the plant also
and with it especially if people are breeding with these plants that are
active with the virus so I'd be very curious about the the other testing
right and I think you mentioned it earlier yeah it has to do with the
sensitivity of those tests right they're not infallible we can definitely get
false negatives put it that way when the when the expression of those plants is
or those sorry when the expression of the byroids low that that test is very
sensitive like PCR as a technique is a very sensitive technique but there is
you know a limited detection essentially right and so if the viroids
present that below that that limited section you're kind of up Schitt's Creek
which is why again like repeated testing is to ensure that you're clean is really
kind of crucial right it's not just a one and no one and done thing like I
listen I don't know how we're ever gonna get rid of it the way that the world
works right now with everybody chasing clones and you know wanting to have the
latest greatest thing rather than looking through see it's to find their
own thing if everybody kind of went back to seeds and then tested on a small
scale and stop passing things around we might be able to get rid of it but you
see how it is on Instagram I mean everybody's throwing clones all around
trading clones with everybody and if you're doing that kind of stuff without
testing it's like you know again I use the I always go back to the Kovat
example like it's kind of like the asymptomatic carrier of Kovat right like
if you don't know that you're infected you don't have any symptoms you're
walking around and in fact and everybody else right and we're just not doing it
in a way that is I think the way that we're acting in the campus community in
the cannabis growing community I mean look at you look at the Canadian system
right like we we didn't we started with this system that everybody had to bring
in their own seeds through legal channels and they realized that all the
California stuff was more popular and people wanted to bring clones in so they
did like some people smuggled up clones from the States and this didn't only
happen with the viroid but also happened with broad mites you know all of a sudden
there's facilities popping up when these genetics enter the system there's no
facilities popping off with like you know broad mites and HLVD right it's
because they moved it in through or outside of the channels that would
require phytosanitary procedures and testing right and as long as we keep
doing that with you know the goal is always money like someone realizes you
know oh we want to have that Sherbert cut from California that's making all
the money you know and then they you know they make a decision based on money
and you end up jeopardizing not only your own facility but like really it
puts the entire industry at risk right and until we address this problem as an
industry it's not going away. Oh a hundred percent I mean this whole we
could have a whole rant on and that's maybe another topic for another time
but I think that the hype genetics are like I'm worried that it's like watering
down the you know what we're doing it's just the same kind of cookie cutter
flavor that comes over and over and over again a lot of the time or it needs to
look a certain way or it's a certain thing and these everybody pushing high
THC numbers and it's all about who wraps about what I mean we've been having some
pretty deep conversations around this lately because there are so many
incredible genetics out there that are getting like no play because everything's
all about what's trending for next year and I mean and honestly as somebody that
does like production I am curious I'm like what's gonna trend next because if
we can be ahead of the curve and I can't believe this stuff is still trending and
all of these hype cuts also like her me out all the time I mean it's like a
whole rant that I feel like I feel like we're doing it wrong and I feel like at
the end of the day it's the consumers that are the ones that are missing out
and the farmers who don't get to like grow the wide variety of things and like
the unicorns and we can't even get like one-to-ones or mixed ratio stuff on
menus you can't sell it at this point so I feel like I'm excited about the freaks
and the mutations and all the weird stuff and all the minor cannabinoids and
all of the formulation because that's like it's the public and it's I loved
what Christian said earlier about you know that it's it's like consistent
medicine for people we cannot forget we get like so caught up with this hype
game but it's like a fine balance because there's you know we can have
both I think at the same time maybe is kind of my perception right now that I
would love for people to be buyers especially to be more educated around
like what is unique and special because that's not what I'm seeing right now I'm
seeing a whole bunch of stuff that looks exactly the same and it's super
temperamental so and and not like that great a yield honestly across the board
smoke alarm yeah those great points so you mentioned and to add on to that like
you know breeders are the big hot thing was like THC levels I'm not sure if it
is I'm not personally breeder so I don't know what the current trend is but like
very very high levels of THC was the trend and what the research is showing
is that like you know the more production of THC is causing less
production of other cannabinoids even CBD or other you know you know the
hundred fifty plus other cannabinoids that exist within cannabis like as
breeders are just focusing on THC it's actually affecting the other cannabinoids
and the chemotype and stuff like that that people aren't really aware of so
you know like you know we do have to remember this is a medicine and some
people are using this plant for treatments very serious illnesses so we
have to keep that in mind and you know breed for for traits that are also
medicinal as well as for recreational because I think we can't have both both
sides of it right so and then I think you know genetics and biotechnology in
the new advanced you know equipment that we get our hands on is only gonna make
that easier and and you know more of a reality so it's exciting stuff well on
the other end of the spectrum too it's like I'm still I really hope that we can
like type 3 plants are not actually 0.03 total THC at harvest and now that we're
doing weird things with the breeding and doing CRISPR stuff to try and like knock
out the you know knock that out essentially so we have like a zero
detect hemp but that's not actually hemp hemp is all word so it's kind of like
insanity what we're being forced to do by like poor regulations outdated 1960
science I mean how poor regulations and consumer education affects like trends
with breeders is a whole thing it's like super deep and I think that you know I
don't know it's a little bit away from the topic of the mutations but it's very
important that people understand that also
yeah the world of hemp is is really interesting I personally don't know too
much on it but um my thoughts are that the science is a bit more progressed and
then you know a bit more accessible and you know published and whatnot just
because temp has had a little bit less regulation and has had more access to
research at least from my knowledge in the US and whatnot well yeah speaking on
just temp and just the shame of you know the 0.3 THC and even bringing it down to
zero whatnot it's it's it doesn't make sense and I don't know the system just
seems weird I know here in Canada forget the exact numbers of cultivars that we
have for hemp but I swear it took at least like 10 plus years to for them to
add like one or two cultivars to this this list that they have there you have
a list in Canada of cultivars that you're only allowed to grow for him and
and this list is just never evolving never changing and never really being
updated and it's just you know you know this is just behind right we should be
you know I think hemp also has a huge potential of like breeding for you know
high CBD right it could be a multi-purpose plant instead of just
being for you know fibers and whatnot right now so yeah there's regulations
and the laws and you know all those issues as just kind of setting us back
kind of but we're still making steps forward we know one one day at a time
but yeah the future's great they opened that up this year in the last year it
was pretty locked down but they they were getting so much pressure from
industry that they finally started allowing stuff on that new list of
approved cultivars so we do actually have some type some type 3 sorry pure
CBD stuff I feel like I need to mention to it was a video put up on the FCP
channel last night where someone was talking about type 1 type 2 and type 3
seed and it had nothing to do with cannabinoid content and I was like oh
shit this is gonna undo like a lot of education about what is type 1 versus
type 2 versus type 3 cannabis because we also use those words to describe
chemotype right and that's also an imperfect system but when somebody else
has come along and is using it to describe like if a seed comes from like
a known or an unknown parent and we're using the same words I kind of fear that
like people are gonna get really tossed over I think in this context we really
use type 3 to mean plants that are you know vastly CBD predominant with a
little blips of THC anyway it's just something I should point out because it
you know it could get confusing if we use the same words to describe two
different things right like we were doing with genetic drift
exactly yeah no whole nother can of worms there yeah I feel like we need to
put a quick stop to those things before they get out of control because I think
as we've seen in the cannabis community people learn a new word whether it's you
know sativa indica or genetic drift or whatever it is and they run with a
definition that's wrong and it just gets out of control and then we lose the
ability to effectively communicate ideas because everybody you know we got
multiple definitions for the same word it's kind of bizarre could you break it
down for the audience Ryan because I feel like you're maybe I don't know if
there's somebody else that's more qualified up here but I feel like other
people ask a lot and I know that I have my way of describing it but I feel like
I really wish that the community would start to use the types more because I
mean it goes beyond type 3 to like the actual definition there's type 4 type 5
as well yeah and even to listen even like this breaking it down into five
classes is really insufficient when I was working in April we came up with all
these different chemotype cannabinoid chemotypes that aren't even
described in that system so but that system came from hemp and I think was an
Italian guy that came up with it but essentially type 1 cannabis is what is
sold in the recreational market so that's like you know high THC cannabis
with very little CBD so that's the main that's the primary THC type I'm gonna
skip type 2 for a second and go right to type 3 type 3 is hemp hemp would be
considered type 3 so hemp is essentially very low sorry very low cannabinoid
content plants with a genetic background that only produce CBD or they produce
predominantly CBD with a little blip of THC and so that's what we call type 3
plants anything that is high in CBD with a little bit of THC now if you cross
type 1 plants to type 3 plants and you create a hybrid you actually get what a
type 2 plant is and so type 2 plants typically vary from you know we call
them they're generally referred to as one-to-one Canada or one-to-one THC to
CBD varieties but really that ratio can be anywhere from two to one to one to
two and anything that kind of falls within that ratio range is what we call
type 3 or sorry it was what we call type 2 my apologies type 4 is those plants
that we talked about earlier on that have the mutation in either the CBG or
that or sorry either the THC acid synthase or the CBD acid synthase gene
that backup CBG as a precursor because the enzymes aren't present to turn it
into the end product we call those ones type 4 and then type 5 is without cap is
hemp essentially is cannabis without without cannabinoids at all and you can
you can do that through a whole bunch of ways one the mate the easiest way to do
it the single mutation is to have a knockout in geez what is that gene
called I the anyway there's a gene essentially that brings together GPP
drowned pyrophosphate and a live it to like acid and when those things come
together you get the formation of CBG and so if you can knock out that enzyme
that brings those two things together you're essentially knocking out the
entire cannabinoid pathway so that would be a type 5 now having laid all those
things out someone that understands you know these these other types that we can
have in cannabis like THC V predominant or CBD V predominant they're nowhere to
be found in that five class system right and so when I was working at Napro we
started referring to those plants as like type 1 V or type 2 V or type 3 V
the V standing for Marin that also wasn't a great system because typically
this you know what these are written they're usually written in Roman
numerals or we stopped doing that but you'll see it in the scientific
literature people write like type 4 with a Roman numeral and you know IV looks
like 1 V right or you know the Roman numeral for 4 it kind of looks like 1 V
so it also wasn't a great way to describe it but the truth is is that if
you if you just add in that V into the type 1 class or the type class it makes
a little bit of sense because you can have a type 1 plant so when you when you
introduce variance or THC V but what we call the propyl cannabinoids into a line
usually you have like a one-to-one ratio between the pentyl and the propyl
cannabinoids so that just means like the three carbon and the five carbon tail on
the on the cannabinoid so like a type 1 V plant would have say ripped 50% of the
of the cannabinoid fraction would be THC and the other 50% of the cannabinoid
fraction would be THC V you can also get the same in a type 3 plant so you'd have
a type 3 V would be a plant that had like 50% of the cannabinoid fraction
more or less would be CBD the other 50% of the cannabinoid fraction would be
CBD V and then if you have that type 2 V class you know you can have what you'd
have a plant that would be you know 100% cannabinoid fraction say 25% would be
THC V 25% would be THC 25% would be CBD and then the other 25% would be CBD V
and you know this also works the same for like a type V plant or sorry a type
for V plant would be you know CBD CBG and CBG V and then then you can get in
and you can actually start modifying the cannabinoid pathway to essentially shut
down the propyl or sorry you shut down the pentyl or the traditional cannabinoids
so you can through you know again through through stacking mutations you
can you can essentially shut down the production of like THC in a type one
line and push that ratio between THC V and THC towards THC V dominance right so
I don't know if that was too rambling it's kind of esoteric but if that wasn't
clear let me know that was awesome thanks thanks Ryan I wanted to I wanted
to ask if like there was anybody that had been you know just with the
mutations I've really been trying to rack my brain on the other things and I
would be curious like if other people like other breeders on the panel or just
anybody in general has questions around like specific targets or if you know the
people on YouTube are asking because I'm not over there too like I'm trying to
think of you know if there's ways that we've tried to steer things or usually
it's always like trying to avoid mutations because I've seen some other
like really strange things I was gonna try to pull them up but they're beyond I
don't know they're just like strange shaping of the seedlings and especially
with the the trip that triploid seedlings this year definitely there was
a lot that were they were weird like in the whole entire nursery I don't know I
don't know if like weird is like a good way to describe scientifically but they
were definitely strange like I could tell the difference and I've handled a
lot of seedlings over the years but these ones we just they looked very
different to me and I thought that there was more mutations so I was trying to
look at my photographs and I just be curious like because I feel like a lot
of the time we're trying to avoid those things in breeding not like and I love
freak show because it's encouraged but I'm trying to think of like is there a
traditional path people have been trying to mutate like is there something that's
like a standard mutation that people are going for I guess is the how to refine my
question I'd really say it depends on the vigor and the growth of the plant
like if you're just looking at me I see tons of like runs and small slow growing
plants through different cultivars the mutated ones and the non mutated ones it
could be some sort of somatic mutation or something like that that just causes
it to be they almost look sickly the leaves are crumpled up crinkled up and I
saw a lot of that this year certain breeders Feminine seeds and I'll have
some of the variety one types right next to that and they'll outpace those kind
of a really slow stunted mutants of that sort but I would say you know select
away from anything that has no vigor yeah oh hey Jody how's it going welcome
up you had a question well yeah seems that there's a this has been such an
awesome room I appreciate all this um Ryan when when you was asked about the
class one two three the first thing I thought as well it's are we going to
about four and five because I'm over here in the hemp side of it and I loved
hearing your perspective and your your way that you explained it now on my side
what I'm being taught is that when they went to the class for class three being
the more dominant all we got to do is keep it below 0.3 Delta 9 for hemp you
know when we're talking about the hemp side of it but the class three would be
in low THC and high dominant mainly CBD but I take it it could be CBG or it
could be CBC you know that long as we're keeping that class three there
and then they rolled into class four to go into for grain and then they ran
class five to go to fiber in a way that's sort of what you said but yeah
you sort of you had a little different spin to it but I do see things getting
thrown around everywhere and sitting back here being in the in the industry
or learning how to grow and feed I guess I'm I got a breeder that I'm with
but that's his lane I'm learning with him but I'm a feeder you know I help
that genetics grow um right there so I have an interest in and I'm in the hemp
lane so I do this for hemp but I really have an interest in this fiber aspect
and things for the genetics because if we're playing with these genetics to do
what we're doing with these class three what we call hemp is like certainly
some people are going to put some great cultivars out for these farmers for
fiber and for seed and for grains and stuff like that and there's all kinds of
concern about pause you know cross pollination and keeping this stuff from
drifted numb is there a lane to keep us safe that we can have all the hemp
growing out here and keep all the other the Paul the cross pollination down and
I think everyone's pretty worried about that but I'm still new so I'm asking
questions and trying to learn I don't could I just really quickly just say to
two points is that I love how you say Jody that it's easy like oh all we've
got to worry about is breeding for 0.03 total THC because I've been surrounded
by tons of breeders I've read myself we've been doing tons of work with this
for years and without $500,000 sequencing machine like my experiences
it's not easy it's definitely like to me it's like one of the hardest things
actually like it's made me cry a lot it's not easy without like a lot of
technology and I would say that in my opinion I think triploids are the future
of you know that it's a little bit concerning because then they're seedless
and so it's like but if you're gonna have you know type one crops and type
three crops within proximity to each other there definitely needs to be a lot
of caution the only issue I really see with the triploids is that you
continually have to go back to the seed breeder and you can't breed them
yourself so I mean it's a it's a deep conversation but those are just my
points I'm sure other people have things no I took that well I picked up on what
you're saying that I enjoyed that yeah I mean it's it's kind of funny that's not
funny but I mean the way that these early half rice came around I mean
remember it was like when they came in and knocked put in prohibition it was
like that let's ban all cannabis like hemp went out the window too and we had
to have a big fight even to get people to start growing cannabis and you know
you know the right wing and the the folks that were really the
prohibitionists maybe was better way to say it in the right wing they they
really wanted to shut down all cannabis they banned hemp because they thought
that hemp was one step towards Canada was one step towards drug cannabis so in
that period of like like hysterical reasoning that when people actually
started bringing hemp back in it was so heavily like you know the people that
when when when it was allowed to come back in and start being grown there was
such a heavy importance put on the fact that there couldn't possibly be any THC
in the plant and so there's two things that you would do as a plant breeder
sorry if you were looking if THC was the only thing that we're looking at there's
two ways to get to no THC plants one you select for type 3 or type 4 or type 5
right so that's either a CBD dominant a CBG dominant or a no cannabinoid variety
all of those things will give you like you'll help push the THC numbers way way
down the other way to do it is to take the cannabinoid biosynthesis pathway and
turn down the precursor genes so that the plant just produces relatively less
total cannabinoids so if you go and you look at hemp varieties or some hemp
varieties they might be type 3 plants but they only have they only produce
like 1 or 2 percent total cannabinoids right so if you got a type 3 plant that
is say 95 percent or 98 percent CBD with the rest being THC if that's in a in a
genetic background that only produces 2 percent total cannabinoids you're gonna
be really low on your THC numbers right so yeah those are those are kind of all
tricks that you can get I think I think eventually a little evolved to the point
in time where you've got in the States at least you'll have federal regulation
federal legalization and then they'll grow hemp in one part of the country
outdoors and that's not where they'll grow drug cannabis and so it probably
won't be like a huge issue I don't know why we need to be produced I mean I
guess it's part of the the the local thinking you know we can do everything
locally but to me growing type 3 plants in like Southern Oregon or you know the
Emerald Triangle or or even down like in some of these other places in the
Central Valley it's like it to me that doesn't make sense like why don't you
ship that stuff off to like Idaho or somewhere like that you know or Iowa
whether you get these big open fields grow the hemp out there and then do the
drug production in another part of the country and then you just don't have to
worry about that but the way that it's the way that the whole States is
essentially cut up into 50 islands right where these systems can exist on the
state level but you can't move from one district you can't move materials from
one district to the other at least medicinal cannabis or recreational
cannabis like that really it puts a whole set of regulations in place that
are kind of stupid right and it's like again like we were talking about before
we spend all this time and energy trying to be compliant rather than just making
smart laws right it's like it'll things will get a lot I think things will get a
lot better and more simplified when we don't have to be you know plan duck and
cover from the the leak the the illegality of cannabis right sorry more
rambling no that's all on point definitely I mean as somebody in
California where it depends on what jurisdiction you're in whether or not
you can grow hemp or whether or not you can grow you know recreational and even
for a while like legalization prop 64 it happened but our county had only allowed
for while at the same time banning all commercial cultivation there was a small
window of time where we were allowed to operate medically and so the
incongruence of all of the regulatory systems are just wild it's one of the
things that like so much of how we've like the germplasm has been shaped
throughout this entire you know history of the plant since it's been sort of
like dealt with in a legalistic framework since prohibition and it's
like instead of just being you know human decisions science rational plant
breeding these sorts of things that have determined the shape of the germplasm
it's been prohibition and stupid laws if anyone from the audience has any
questions just raise your hand there's a little raise your hand button and we'll
bring you up and keep the conversation going a quick question back on the
tissue culture side Christians since you've been working on cannabis with
tissue culture it's been I know about three or four years since I've been in
lab doing any tissue culture and back when I was doing that we'd had a lot of
trouble with shoot induction media from cows and I was just wondering if you
know where the industry is kind of gotten to at this point if people have
you know started succeeding with that and you know that's been made public
through academia or if like you'd mentioned before you know people are
possibly doing it but it's just you know they're keeping it private because you
know they want to protect that IP oh yeah so tissue culture is definitely
it's just getting better and better as you know more people are getting their
hands actually with cannabis and you know tissue culture and tissue culture
in general is just kind of growing as its own little industry people are
acknowledging it more and things are getting cheaper for callous and stuff I
know right now my colleague is actually using machine learning to pretty sure
look at media for callous as well as trying to remember I think I had another
colleague who potentially either is currently working on or did publish a
paper about like callous generation and then like creating shoots you have a
shoot generation from callous so I can't I feel like I've seen something about it
but I can't quite remember if it's been published or if it's just some
discussion or some talk I've had with a colleague but it's definitely in the
works something my colleague actually really brought up and really kind of as
an interesting kind of topic was using callous to essentially essentially
breed or cultivate a cambinoids so instead of actually having flowers right
because people use extracts and whatnot on people who are desirable for those
cambinoids so in theory if you were able to create you know callous that was able
to create those secondary metabolites and like I'm be able to harvest it I
would kind of be sort of a game-changer so that's something he's actually
interested in I'm pretty sure other plant species have experimented with
that or I don't know there's some sort of probably more work that's been done
but yeah I know it's something that he's actually interested in yeah I think
I think with cannabis that might be problematic because the tissue that you have generating
callous is the cell like the plant cells themselves and the trichome cells are
where the secondary metabolites are synthesized and created and stored so
like I mean it is completely over my head if they can do you know tissue
culture with trichome material somehow I mean if they could do that that would be
pretty next-level stuff yeah I believe the theory is like is that you know DNA
is DNA right it has all the you know genes all the you know yeah the genes
there that you need just certain ones are activated and certain aren't and in
certain tissue what he's interested in is essentially bringing in CRISPR and
essentially bringing CRISPR and essentially finding which genes you know
relate to you know secondary metabolites and then your trichomes whatnot essentially
trying to activate those genes inside callous tissue and then you know see see
what that produces it's pretty insane but it's something he's interested in
something that's kind of being worked right now with callous I know that shoot
induction from callous has also been worked on I'm pretty sure I'm actually
quickly Google see if I can find a paper work on for a little bit just kind
of privately but yeah they I don't know I'd seen that several papers on it but
just you know very few you know even even trying to recreate those papers was
extremely difficult and we never really had any actual success ourselves yeah you
missed up the you miss group I meant lots of those guys they did they did a
or sorry she's a female they did a little bit of work on it and they
published a method and I use that method on like 50 genotypes and I think it
worked on one or two of them it's not it's definitely not reliable I think of
the method that they had worked on their specific genotype and they published it
because if you get if you go look at the paper it's one of those papers no no no
Christian it's one of these papers that used one genotype right and so they made
they made representations based on that one genotype and it turned out that it
didn't apply to other genotypes so the you miss method is you know it's a it's
a starting point it's not a solution put it that way I'm not gonna name drop did
that person start like the author start with an owl because if so I know that my
advisor had the exact same issue where he just went through so many different
genotypes trying to replicate you know the results of tissue culture cannabis
and was ending up with nothing close to what the paper had published so her name
is from Mon Lata she works at UMS in Michelle's lab yeah sorry not Michelle's lab but also
his lab so yeah yeah my advisor had the same and he talked to you partners other people
and academia even in industry and you know no one could make it replicable and like you know
reproduce the results that those published in the paper and then you know resulted in
him having to you know try to find his own you know methods and whatnot and I'm pretty
sure one of the master students I think published recently like protocols for micropopulation
and cannabis tissue culture so I know one of my colleagues has recently published a
paper on that but yeah no big issue and not even just you know with just that one author
I think it's an issue just in general in cannabis right now just reproducing results
even general science to be honest reproducing results is a lot harder than should be right
the whole purpose of education like academia is are you present results that you know anyone
can pick up and redo themselves right that's why you have material and methods and why
you go into all those details is that you know someone should be able to pick up your
paper and reproduce those results right and that's why they're peer review and there's
a process but you know you pick up papers you try it yourself and it doesn't work and
it's you know it's an unfortunate reality of it but you know you just continue you do
your own thing and then you know you publish results and you know I'm pretty sure the master
student that I believe he's now on to his PhD he definitely referenced you know her
papers and mentioned that you know he could not reproduce those results like he had to
do his own kind of methods and investigate his own protocols so yeah it's definitely
interesting but yeah tissue culture is definitely got a lot of potential but also a lot of more
research required which I guess is a repeating theme in the science world.
Christian I really appreciate that you said earlier around just that the plants were healthy
because I always wonder with the studies and like are the plants like what do the plants
actually look like because I've seen plants but like schools and some of these larger
facilities that just they don't look like healthy happy plants to me so I'm happy that
you're pointing to and that people are starting to get like more photography because it's
definitely something I wonder about is like the health of the plants like are they vibrant
and so I appreciate you saying that and I'm so glad that this conversation is happening
especially Ryan and thank you for sending me that paper I'm gonna read it excited.
My pleasure yeah no again and thanks for having me it's and I've already mentioned it before
but so cool to kind of collab and you know have different perspective of you know people
who've been breeding for a long time well you know I'm much more you know school and
you know both kind of educated right I've done a bit of you know growing myself I don't
know large-scale breeding or anything you know so it's cool to see you know it's it's
a nice that I can share with you guys and you guys share with me so I you know I'm
really really appreciating this this invite and this opportunity.
I'm glad it worked out man when I saw someone mentioned your paper I mean I'd read the preprint
and when I saw someone mentioned your paper I saw your Twitter name so I just figured
it would be interesting to have you here talking you know talking about your work for yourself
rather than us kind of like third party it you know but yeah it's been really cool really
appreciate your contributions and to for so thanks for being open and coming out.
My pleasure yeah and we're do another deep dive into the paper on Wednesday so we will
be going into it even further and this helps you know this helps gives us context and understand
really where you're coming from and the scope of the study and also if you want to you're
more than welcome to join us on Wednesday I understand you know you've already given
a lot of time tonight and it's very short notice but you're totally welcome to come
on again on Wednesday with us.
Is the time the same?
I got a look I believe it is let me pull up my IG yeah it's it's 7 p.m. P. Western Pacific
Standard Time.
I invited Max on there sorry not Max I invited Matthew on as well yesterday when I saw his
pre-video I sent him a message I said hey show up tomorrow I didn't tell him why but
yeah it was unfortunately he didn't make it in but that would be cool if Christian ends
up going.
Yeah I'm checking my calendar right now and yeah I should be available in the evening
you said 7 p.m. Pacific Time right?
Yes yeah.
Okay yeah so I think Easter and what is that for again I think I think it's three hours
yeah it'd be three hours later there yeah it's later yeah okay cool yeah yeah I should
be able to make that I'm always down to talk about my paper I mean I'm sort of really really
busy which is the unfortunate part but in the evenings I obviously I'm not studying
24-7 I'm currently actually studying for my qualifying exam for a PhD it's just like this
big exam that you have to pass to kind of continue your PhD so that's happening in a
week from now I think next Tuesday it's like three separate days so it's pretty intimidating
I've been crazy in the books but yeah no I should be able to make time for that I mean
I'm happy to promote and share my research I think has a lot of value to everyone from
commercial to you know small-scale growers so yeah I'm more than happy.
That's awesome and we really appreciate it I think there's a lot of value and honestly
like I mentioned it earlier but there just haven't been that many papers that have come
out and kind of like had an aha moment where it's like oh shit finally we've got the word
for the thing that we've been you know referring to for all these years wrongly and so that
for me was definitely very cool reading the preprint and then I just did the search and
you had mentioned that it just got published and so it's really cool to see that it's it's
it's up and it's open access so anybody who wants to search out both the preprint you
can find that but you can also find the the actual peer-reviewed I think it was in plant
genetics that it was published in the plant genome a plant genome journal yep that's also
my first lead author paper so that makes that a little bit extra special at least for me so
yeah it's pretty incredible to you know be a first lead author you know it's pretty unique
and special so I think it's awesome and I'm super excited I've just scanned it and I'm excited to
dive deeper into it because it has come up like this topic has come up so frequently
more recently but over the past few years so I really I'm excited to dive a little deeper and
I was curious like if there was anything that came up for you with the terpene pathways I know
that was like a part of it that like the impact that it has or you know how those things like
how you kind of came to those conclusions because there's a couple other white papers I find really
interesting around like the breeding with for terpene specifically and how you can kind of
manipulate pathways or do things along those lines yeah no the terpene pathway was interesting
both cambinoid and terpene pathway we kind of investigated further we had over like 40 genes
that we had that related to those pathways and essentially like overall we didn't find any like
you know mutations that could actually have an impact or change anything you know they're
probably just you know snips where they didn't actually change the amino acid the actual protein
that got created but the thing is is that we did identify that they existed there you know
whether it be you know in large quantity or not they exist so it's kind of just like a
good knowledge of it it's not too much to be like oh you know in theory if you kind of like you know
push the idea further it's how you know you can hypothesize that if you know you had a plant that
kept accumulating mutations it eventually would maybe you know affect one of those pathways ones
those enzymes and then you know create you know a you know plant with less vigor or less
cambinoid or you know whatever it be that could be you know deleterious which is a mutation that
has a negative effect and you know not all bad like not all mutations are bad that's definitely
true for sure but the unfortunate thing is that the majority of them are right and i'm like you
know i've said before it's a lot easier to knock a function out than to improve in function it's just
how genetics is and how genes are and how proteins are you know graded so yeah
yeah and also in the context of the particular paper like when you have a clone only mother plant
reproducibility of the specific expression is the thing so even if on like a broader sort of
breeding perspective or even if occasionally you get the the sports or the you know the pino sort
of example that was given earlier or the different apples that are different somatic variations that
were you know kept in clones that's you know very rare i don't think i know of a single example in
cannabis where somebody's taken a particular branch cloned it reproduced it and we have
something on par with freak show or some of these others and certainly or on par with like a pino or
something like that and you know really for for the mother plants you want that consistency
and reproducibility so that level of you know variation that or mutations that caused variation
in the trade expression would more times than not be deleterious in that instance whereas they could
be you know it's one of those things we've used uh the good bad framing to a certain extent and a
lot of that has to do with the context of the particular applications and it's always good to
remember that it's all about adaptive you know the adaptation within a particular selective regime
or niche so in a crop species if it's got some sort of a good selective variation that you want
to have then it's good you know the freak show mutation it's something that you know we've
addressed the novelty aspect but there's also additional levels of value that come along with it
um just from a research perspective and understanding genetics and how things
how the traits can be inherited and stuff like that and so i just think that
it's one of those things mutations they happen um they're either adaptive or they're not adaptive
and certainly if you've got a clone only plant that you're trying to keep and replicate for a
long time you don't want those mutations and i just think that the fact that you're helping us
have the terminology and hopefully more research can go into identifying the specific areas where
we can minimize that level of variation because we're not getting rid of mother rooms tissue
cultures doesn't necessarily eliminate this issue we need to figure out the different variables that
produce the phenomena and mitigate or reduce their impact on you know our our clone only
varieties and that's not to say that it's causing any impacts yet but just for the preservation of
the clone varieties that we have in production we want to limit it as much as possible sorry for the
long rambling comment if anyone from the audience has any questions to raise your hand
i i just wanted to say thank you christian for actually you know taking like it's a really cool
i'm excited to read more into it because this is i just want to also point out that this has been
it really has been a big conversation it's been something that everybody's also seen like and it's
nice to have like we have this um what's the word i'm looking for you know this uh anecdotal kind of
like we see these things especially because we've kept you know it's like we've kept mothers
really really long periods of time like we have populations of like years six seven eight you know
it's like i have a friend you know stuff is we see this all the time and then we don't really
have explanations for it and then sometimes we think it's just our imagination and the one thing
i've seen is like over it would be really cool to see a study that was like over the course of time
to what how it makes a difference um because i know that you know doing a lot of research on
genetic sequencing and genomic sequencing is great but it's also curious to see like
when you actually start to notice differences within your population over the course of a
long period of time and through data and you pointed to machine learning and kind of the ai
piece earlier so i'm super excited over time how we're going to see more with the science and the
cutting edge technology um because i think that there's also some things that are impacted over
time i guess would be the thing yeah no 100 i agree and the same with trevor just disappoints
it's definitely a lot more uh to look into but it has an insane amount of value um like you
mentioned like yeah the long term of of you know um other plants who we don't really know
what exactly happens and i think a big concern that like my lab and you know our research kind
of looks at is the fact that cannabis is an annual plant where it's naturally supposed to be just you
know one year so we're prolonging its life unnaturally you know it's artificial prolongment
environment that we provided in right um so who knows what that's really going on um i actually
had an experiment where i was going to kind of look at you know generational kind of effects where
i was essentially going to take the mother plant that was in that phase one and then take
apical and basil like the top clone and like a bottom section clone and then essentially grow out
you know for three or five months um and then you know redo that process except with that apical
clone i took i would only take an apical um you know clone and then you know restart that you
know generation and then the same um for the basil like the lower side where i would take it and then
you know only exclusively um take basal clones for that line so look at the two lines and then
essentially we'd sequence because sequencing was expensive i think we were only going to do
the third generation and the fifth um because we kind of had you know some data to fall back on
because we already sequenced the original mother plant that we would have been using um so yeah that
would have been all wonderful and fine but uh real world and research um nothing goes perfect and
nothing goes as exactly planned so um the agency like the facility that um i was working at they
ended up changing like business plans so they don't actually produce cannabis at their facility
anymore um so essentially i've taken that project and i've brought it into tissue culture where i'm
looking at uh apical like um you know segments from tissue culture versus you know basil segments
and tissue culture of cannabis um you know it it works it's something to look at we'll see what the
results reveal um you know i would have much preferred to have the full-grown plants and i
think it would have provided a much more you know detailed and more you know versatile kind of
explanation um but tissue culture is still valuable and still has its place so i think you know um
we'll see what what that shows and and yeah so but yeah i definitely agree looking into some sort of
long-term effect and seeing what's happening especially with age and especially that we know
that like you know dna repair mechanisms slowly degrade and slowly become worse as you age um you
know with with all species right if if your mechanisms to repair dna start to you know
degrade and not perform as well then you know your dna is just going to accumulate more and more
mutations so it could be like an exponential effect um so so it's interesting uh there's a
lot of questions but yeah i'm excited to you know start it and kind of look into it and then you
know provide some insight and provide some terminology um to stuff that was kind of no
question before so yeah it's my pleasure you know just really quick i feel like the annual um thing
has always been interesting me with cannabis because i've grown lots of other plants which i
really hope other people who are breeding we talked about this before like breed it breed and grow
other things because it really is eye-opening but um the annual so there's a i forget the term it's
like a thing that can happen with genes with annual plants and i don't know if it's actually a
mutation or not but they can become biennial and then even almost like it's like there's a
perennialization that happens and it's something on the gene level and it definitely happens with
plants when they're grown in different regions um that are traditionally annual but can convert
over to biennial or perennialize and i'm curious if ryan or anybody else knows like what that is
because it essentially is what we you know we've kind of forcing cannabis to be this you know where
you really think about it like that i'm like wow we're like keeping alive these things but i guess
it's the same across the board with like basil and you know wine and all these other plants that
we've been doing this for i guess thousands of years so it's really kind of interesting
propagation is very interesting in general i personally don't know too about the uh bi
perennial um i i specifically when i did my literature review was mostly looking at like
the differences between annual and perennial um i didn't come across you know any sort of like
hybrids or anything like the the vibe perennial that you mentioned that uh sounds really interesting
i actually kind of probably write that down and look into it because yeah i've i've missed that
i only really looked at like the two differences between them so thank you one of my teachers told
me it was it was a mutation that can also be induced by like stress in the environment because
i was asking about some some other specific plants that are annuals and i was like i've seen it
do this weird thing and then also had polyploidism as well like where the flowers like sprout other
flowers out of the flowers and it's super cool looking at like it's such a trippy thing so
that's why i was like wow these plants have like starting to perennialize and then also they're
having like it's super bizarre it's like a flower with like shoots that come up out of the flower
and it's generally induced by stress so essentially weird um but it happens at the same time so it's
like the flower keeps growing and then the plant starts to perennialize over time yeah i would be
curious ryan if you kind of know what i'm talking about because i've never seen cannabis do that
but essentially it's kind of what we're doing so it's weird i i really don't evian i'm sorry
it's not really a topic i'm i'm very familiar with interesting like point that you brought up
that i'm not sure how unique it is to cannabis but like the amount of stress that breeders will
purposely induce on their plants to like you know what is it uh super cropping is such a thing right
you guys probably know that right and there's there's crazy techniques that you guys will
purposely induce you know stress to the plant to to create you know some sort of beneficial
effect um like i've even heard of like ice baths before harvest or night cycles before harvest um
yeah no it's it's interesting how like stress kind of can you know be beneficial to uh to cannabis
and you know people are manipulating it and using it and it's interesting i wonder what's kind of
like going on you know behind the scenes where uh you know the genetic side of things where you're
inducing these stresses um because an interesting thing where um you know it's not just unique to
cannabis where like you know stresses to certain plants uh will force them to produce more uh
secondary metabolites and in cannabis that would be your cannabinoids and terpenes right
so other plants definitely do such things as well and
yeah no it's it's really cool just you know manipulating plants with stress it's such a cool
thing it'll be really fun to have you on with matthew he um he's an entomologist and knows a lot
about um the impacts and really the he has a very interesting take on uh how stress from pathogens
and different mutualists um can induce different responses so the two of you can definitely deep
dive deep into that as uh you know we can cover the paper and also as we have here
go into some of these these side digressions it'll be interesting to listen to for sure
yeah i think that's an observable thing too that we've seen you know with like pest pressure
because that's essentially like what i was just talking about in other plants is that it's like
it literally pest pressure is one of the things that can do that and then i i feel like i'm so
curious about the stresses with the terpene production because i've seen and i've been
this is somewhere we'd love to see in the future maybe like the ai or the being able to aggregate
the data more because and it'd be great to talk to matthew about this too is like you see
and because i think essentially i don't know if it would be considered a mutation but
you definitely see that across the board there's more terpene production of certain things
um in in the cultivation when there's certain stresses and certain pressures and i've been
curious if like uh over time like when we can start to look at the data of some of these genetics over
the long term and seeing like different years how different terpenes are more prevalent due to the
different stresses so i'd be very curious to to hear what uh what matthew has to say about that
or like how we because we haven't really had a chance to i think look at a lot of this data
it's like you know now we're starting to get to the point where maybe we have enough and we can
start to understand yeah i think um the whole stress is causing you know some change in secondary
metabolite or other sort of phenotypic changes i think that falls more under the category of
epigenetics i'm not sure how much we covered that during this talk but i think we touched
about a couple times um and the other general consensus is we don't do too too much about
epigenetics which essentially is like um it's alterations in like the form of the dna so um
essentially your histones can get methylated or your dna can get methylated uh it's where a methyl
group gets attached and kind of changes the form a bit which essentially changes the function um so
essentially what you know it seems is that you know a stress comes in and causes the you know
dna to be expressed differently you know these histones or the dna gets methylated um and i
believe there's other methods for this for the epigenetics but it's still a very you know
unknown universe but that allows the plant to you know um essentially like react to its environment
and change uh depending on what you know its needs are so yeah but i'd be i'm excited to
further talk about that and you know talk with more experts it's been such a pleasure to you
know get everyone's opinions and sides of things i really appreciate it well do you guys want to
wrap it there and uh continue the conversation wednesday night yeah it's getting late here for me
and uh i think i started the room so i'm not sure if i can just leave or not whether the
whole thing collapsed but you well why don't you close us out uh you can kill the room
and uh we'll regroup uh in a couple days cool right on thank you right on thank you ryan
christian thank you man thank you man thanks for having me on you guys great show great
information fellas i learned a lot yeah thanks again yeah thanks again for coming on christian
and uh tony for holding it down and chatting sharing all that information in there and um
thank you to all the speakers and obviously to the audience with you guys we're just a bunch of
idiots talking to each other so um thanks for for chiming in and and listening and um we'll see you
guys back here next week on the future canvas project clubhouse readers roundtable
thanks again everyone wait i don't think he killed the room i think he just left the room
all right let me try to kill this i think i can kill it or i think yeah go for it go for it
huh weird um okay there we go okay everyone thank you so much have a great night max christian
evian anthony everyone thank you for for joining in yeah cool take care
i accomplish many things in those four hours and 43 minutes i uh
uh cooked dinner ate dinner cleaned up after dinner
came back down here all right so but interestingly in addition to wednesday night with mr chad
westport uh who's lurking in the chat right there um i'm actually excited additionally about friday
if i can pull up our
handy
and i'm back that was a uh the internet crapped out
yes all right take two so here we go oh fuck i gotta
uh hold on by the way you guys can see and hear me right uh
share yes hillbilly herb you are still awake uh share a screen share a calendar all right take two
all right let me know if you can hear me amazing thank you australian grown land of the abc
so anyway here on friday we have uh jim faust who uh is gonna give a since it's
christmas time coming up another photo period plant the poinsettia uh from oh this is my
loose title for it but from common mexican shrub to the icon that it is today because it
originally looked nothing like what it looks like now um and then immediately after that
and then immediately after that if trevor is still watching i hope he's part of this conversation but
we have a conversation about nikolai bavilov soviet agronomist uh from the 30s and well into
the 40s and uh he was basically put into a gulag by stalin and eventually died in prison
and then let's see oh so today's no today's monday all right so tomorrow's tuesday the dank hour
in the afternoon growing with marco on wednesday and brian and then this is uh
chad and trevor and matthew uh but anyway the friday stuff is uh what i was focused on
we'll be talking the history of oh so so the poinsettia conversation is going to be a lead-in
to uh the photo periodism in hemp uh studies that jim faust and allison justice have done
um so i figured a a non-cannabis christmas related teaser to that which oh my god look who's
still here go to bed my god um yeah no tonight tonight's tonight uh i have a three-year-old
who's on the couch right now upstairs waiting for me to come back up but anyway everyone with that
have a good night and we will see you tomorrow morning uh alex hardy if you want to go live at
7 00 a.m and surprise everyone that would be amazing drop some knowledge and then at 9 00 a.m
we got the uh the cannabis news hour uh but anyway i will see you all uh sometime tomorrow all right
good night
