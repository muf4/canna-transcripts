[00:01.340 --> 00:09.940]  Welcome, everybody, to episode 16 of the James Loud Show. Today's special guest is James
[00:09.940 --> 00:14.340]  Rushing from White Coat Services, formerly called what?
[00:14.340 --> 00:17.820]  No, it always been White Coat Services.
[00:17.820 --> 00:21.340]  What was the cool Hawaiian name, though?
[00:21.340 --> 00:24.460]  Oh, well...
[00:24.460 --> 00:25.740]  Pre-disencarnation.
[00:25.740 --> 00:37.420]  By pre-White Coat Services, it was... Akuna Mount... I forgot what the name of it was.
[00:37.420 --> 00:44.380]  That was so many years ago. I've been White Coat now for, what, eight years now?
[00:44.380 --> 00:47.740]  As long as I've known you, you've been White Coat.
[00:47.740 --> 00:54.740]  So before James kicks in, we're going to tee up the topic with a little video. So this
[00:54.740 --> 00:56.740]  was shot earlier today.
[00:56.740 --> 01:04.140]  Okay, come here. Okay, come here. I want to show you something. Come on. Well, come here.
[01:04.140 --> 01:10.540]  Okay, get off your scooter. And look at that. What's that?
[01:10.540 --> 01:11.540]  Is that a bug?
[01:11.540 --> 01:12.540]  Yes.
[01:12.540 --> 01:15.740]  And is that a good guy or a bad guy?
[01:15.740 --> 01:16.740]  Bad guy.
[01:16.740 --> 01:17.740]  Yeah?
[01:17.740 --> 01:18.740]  Yeah.
[01:18.740 --> 01:22.740]  So today... Oh, bye-bye. Say...
[01:23.740 --> 01:25.740]  Punga, punga.
[01:25.740 --> 01:31.740]  That's close. Can you say, IPM? Today we're going to talk about IPM.
[01:31.740 --> 01:38.740]  Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh, he's still alive. What do you think?
[01:38.740 --> 01:39.740]  I don't want to see him.
[01:39.740 --> 01:45.740]  You don't want to see him. Okay. Say, bye-bye, bug. Say, smell you later.
[01:45.740 --> 01:46.740]  I can't go.
[01:46.740 --> 01:49.740]  Oh, you want to go. Okay. All right, do you want to bring your scooter?
[01:49.740 --> 01:50.740]  Yeah.
[01:51.740 --> 01:53.740]  That was adorable.
[01:53.740 --> 02:05.740]  Anyway, that's what I was doing 45 minutes ago. So anyway, with that, I thought that would queue up our topic nicely. So, Mr. James Loud, over to you.
[02:05.740 --> 02:10.740]  How's it going, everyone? Welcome to week 16 of the James Loud Show. Thanks for tuning in.
[02:10.740 --> 02:21.740]  Today we have one of my friends, James Rushing, who I've known for probably... I think we met at the Cup in 2017 and he gave me some weed, actually.
[02:21.740 --> 02:29.740]  And we've been friends ever since. We have a whole bunch of mutual friends. We should have been friends for 20 years. We both love good music, obviously.
[02:29.740 --> 02:33.740]  Yeah, we were in Amsterdam at the same time and all that stuff. We just never...
[02:34.740 --> 02:44.740]  Yeah. And so, yeah, we've been on panels together. He's the guy, when I have IPM questions, I go to James. When I have IPM referrals, I give them to James.
[02:44.740 --> 02:54.740]  He's a solid guy and really knowledgeable. So you want to give a little bit of introduction, talk to everybody about what you do, where you're from, a little history on yourself.
[02:54.740 --> 03:16.740]  Sure, sure, sure. I grew up in Chicago. I started my cannabis career there as a cultivator. And for many years was into... just fascinated by the plant and the way that it brought cultures and people together.
[03:17.740 --> 03:32.740]  Very quickly after that, I realized that there was a life for me in other places. And I took my projects and everything out to Hawaii in the mid 2000s.
[03:33.740 --> 04:01.740]  At the same time, I was traveling all over the world trying to find wonderful genetics and new techniques and talking with new growers. And I ended up landing in Hawaii there to better my plant education and ended up enrolling in college out there and getting a degree in tropical plants and soil sciences.
[04:02.740 --> 04:17.740]  I ended up going after that and pursuing a master's degree in tropical conservation biology and environmental science. After that, I ended up working with the University of Hawaii as a professor of sustainable agriculture for a little while.
[04:18.740 --> 04:36.740]  At that same time, I was getting into the business development side of cannabis businesses and starting up new licenses and ventures. Ended up becoming a founding partner and putting a team together for one of the licenses in Hawaii, which came out several years ago.
[04:37.740 --> 04:50.740]  The company is Laola. It's known as Big Island Grown on the Big Island of Hawaii. It's probably the largest revenue company in Hawaii and they're doing very well.
[04:51.740 --> 05:14.740]  We had to design and build a spaceship-like cultivation facility out there because Hawaii is one of the hardest places to cultivate cannabis, especially for medical cannabis with the regulations that they have out there with parts per billion on a lot of the contaminants.
[05:15.740 --> 05:27.740]  We ended up putting that together and that kick-started my need to start cannabis businesses all over the world.
[05:27.740 --> 05:41.740]  Since then, I've been working with a company called Origins Investment. Origins from Washington. They have a couple of dispensaries in Washington, Oklahoma, and a couple of cultivation in Oklahoma.
[05:42.740 --> 06:03.740]  I partnered up with them a couple of years, well, I guess last year. Now, we are implementing as many applications in as many emerging markets as possible, which include Missouri, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maine, Illinois.
[06:03.740 --> 06:16.740]  We're still shooting California, Utah, Arizona. I'm working on an application right now for Georgia. When you talk about the hardest markets to get, starting off in Hawaii was probably the hardest one.
[06:17.740 --> 06:20.740]  Then, it just kept it going after that.
[06:20.740 --> 06:49.740]  While I've been doing that, over the last 12 years, I've been helping large-scale grows with integrated pest management solutions, operational management solutions, really just bringing cultivation centers from more of the amateur black market methodologies to large-scale agro-business and agronomy sciences.
[06:51.740 --> 07:05.740]  Really, just trying to steer people to use the right methods for their budget and still attaining eradication when it comes to pests and pathogens.
[07:06.740 --> 07:22.740]  More importantly, increasing efficiencies and just showing groups that there is a different way of doing things than the old-school way and bringing agriculture sciences into the cultivation area.
[07:23.740 --> 07:39.740]  It's multifaceted. I do business development. I do plant science. In the end, it's all just trying to support the success of the cannabis business industry. That's a rundown where I've been at.
[07:40.740 --> 07:44.740]  Awesome. Fantastic. You're in Chicago right now. How warm is it over there?
[07:45.740 --> 07:48.740]  20. It's 20 degrees. It's snowing.
[07:49.740 --> 07:57.740]  It's 70 here. You were living in California for quite some time. Nice and warm here.
[07:58.740 --> 08:13.740]  I'm missing it, to say the least. The kids are out sledding for the first time of the year. That's nice. We've been able to get them exposed to the winter lifestyle that they've been missing in Hawaii and California.
[08:14.740 --> 08:17.740]  Hopefully, it won't freeze in place.
[08:18.740 --> 08:24.740]  You got to know about the six and eight-year-olds. They don't feel pain and they don't sense temperature.
[08:27.740 --> 08:40.740]  Nice. You want to talk about some IPM techniques that you use and that you recommend for... I guess we can go from the home-grow to talk about scaling, but basic practices, procedures, things that you recommend.
[08:41.740 --> 08:55.740]  In the end, when you look at it from 30,000 feet, it's all the same. The small-scale cultivation, large-scale cultivation, you might be using different materials. You might be using them in different quantities. You might have different budgets.
[08:55.740 --> 09:04.740]  In the end, to me, it's all about the right methodologies and redundancy in those methodologies.
[09:05.740 --> 09:20.740]  My biggest thing for integrated pest management suggestions and consultations is recommending that you focus on redundancy in your modes of action and in the things that you're targeting.
[09:20.740 --> 09:40.740]  For instance, if I am targeting powdery mildew, it would be a normal method to come at it with one, maybe even two methods to try to eradicate or eliminate or suppress or prevent powdery mildew from happening.
[09:40.740 --> 10:07.740]  If I was to look at powdery mildew and say that I want to attack it from a chemical, biological, and maybe even a physical level, or maybe I'm doing it from two biological modes of action that target the same problem, but yet use different biological methods,
[10:10.740 --> 10:16.740]  biological activities, and enzymes, and modes of action to eliminate the one problem.
[10:17.740 --> 10:20.740]  A lot of folks will ask me, how do I get rid of powdery mildew?
[10:20.740 --> 10:40.740]  For powdery mildew, the first thing I'm going to recommend is eradicating what you currently have if it is a problem, making sure that anything that we're talking about isn't systemic, and then focusing on how can we put multiple modes of action onto this powdery mildew.
[10:40.740 --> 10:52.740]  For instance, I might put out some sort of streptomycete as a treatment. In addition to that, every two weeks I might hit it with potassium salts.
[10:53.740 --> 11:05.740]  Then maybe I'm adjusting my humidity levels and I'm improving my climate. Those are multiple things you could do to attack that one problem.
[11:06.740 --> 11:29.740]  If I have spider mites, predatory mites, in addition to endopathogenic fungi, which would physically attack the eggs and the mites, and then in addition to that, maybe a CO2 treatment in the room where I'm bringing the room up to 3,000 ppm for 12 hours, which doesn't kill the plant, it has a really good effect on mites.
[11:29.740 --> 11:58.740]  Doing something like that, whether you're in a tent or you're in Copper State down in Arizona with 35 acres under glass, it's really the same thing on my recommendations to make sure that you're attacking all of your integrated pest management problems with multiple swords for multiple directions and making sure that you're utilizing preventative measures in addition to eradicative measures.
[12:00.740 --> 12:12.740]  Redundancy to me is the biggest factor when it comes to succeeding in integrated pest management. With that is the understanding of your thresholds.
[12:13.740 --> 12:31.740]  If you walk into your grow and you see signs of russet mites, at that point, you really have to make the effort, whether you're in 35 acres of glass or in a tent, you have to put in the effort to find out if it is russet mites.
[12:32.740 --> 12:51.740]  Also, what population density is there in that grow space? At what point are you supposed to act in an eradicative way to eliminate those russet mites?
[12:52.740 --> 13:12.740]  Is seeing one russet mite your threshold to move into eradicative measures? Or seeing one russet mite after two hours of inspection, maybe we just stick with preventative measures until we see more and more and more of them.
[13:13.740 --> 13:37.740]  Really understanding at what point do you enter eradication versus prevention and understanding not only that, but where from a chemical or biological or physical perspective are you going to max out on your available tools?
[13:38.740 --> 13:58.740]  For instance, if I have a mite problem, spider mite problem, it just doesn't go away. Am I going to come in with something harsh that is not going to allow me to pass testing if I'm in a legal market or something that might endanger the individual who's going to be enjoying the product?
[13:59.740 --> 14:19.740]  Am I going to go to that level? Or have I reached a level on my pesticides list? So for instance, I have a threshold for pesticides where I do not apply anything harsher than potassium salts.
[14:20.740 --> 14:38.740]  An example of potassium salts would be MP products, also potassium salts, nucum, those types of things are things that I wouldn't go any further on the chemical level to try to treat those.
[14:39.740 --> 15:01.740]  I would have exhausted my chemical eradication measures by getting to potassium salts. So I have several levels of thresholds where if the mites are this bad, I use this material. If the mites are this bad, I use this material. And if the mites are this bad, I use this one.
[15:01.740 --> 15:16.740]  And if it gets any worse than that, likely it's a teardown scenario, full sanitation and eradication through fallow, which means letting your grow go without plants for a period of time.
[15:17.740 --> 15:28.740]  So there's redundancy and then understanding your thresholds, both on pest populations and then your thresholds on the materials that you're going to use for integrated pest management.
[15:28.740 --> 15:48.740]  I recommend that most people that are using cannabis or growing cannabis to look at California state regulations, as maybe even Hawaii state regulations, as far as the materials that can be used and stick to those because those generally are fairly safe.
[15:49.740 --> 15:55.740]  And not too many of those are above the potassium salt line when you talk about chemical thresholds.
[15:55.740 --> 16:11.740]  So that's just a little bit of introduction as to how I attack it, whether we're in a large scale grow or a small scale grow, it's redundancy and then understanding your thresholds of population density and chemical treatments.
[16:12.740 --> 16:13.740]  Nice.
[16:13.740 --> 16:22.740]  Just quickly, James, we're going to try to troubleshoot the audio crackling again. I feel like you're peaking. So are you on a Mac?
[16:23.740 --> 16:24.740]  I am.
[16:24.740 --> 16:37.740]  So in the top left, I feel like I'm talking to my dad right now, but on the top left, your your Apple icon. Go to system preferences. And then do you see sound?
[16:38.740 --> 16:41.650]  Yes.
[16:41.650 --> 16:49.650]  The sound icon. Click on that. And then in the top nav of the sound dashboard, click on input.
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.650]  OK.
[16:52.650 --> 17:01.650]  And do you see your input volume? You have a slider. Can you bring it down a little bit? Bring it down. Like what's it at right now? 100 percent?
[17:03.650 --> 17:04.650]  No, I think.
[17:04.650 --> 17:05.650]  Perfect. Yeah, perfect.
[17:05.650 --> 17:06.650]  Yeah, you just muted.
[17:08.650 --> 17:09.650]  Did you?
[17:09.650 --> 17:10.650]  It's at the bottom.
[17:11.650 --> 17:13.650]  How's that? Better? Can you still hear me?
[17:14.650 --> 17:15.650]  Yeah, no more cracking.
[17:16.650 --> 17:17.650]  Good. Thanks, Dad.
[17:18.650 --> 17:19.650]  Should I sing?
[17:20.650 --> 17:21.650]  You got it?
[17:21.650 --> 17:25.650]  There's a little cracking. So the other thing is, can you unplug your headphones?
[17:26.650 --> 17:27.650]  Yeah.
[17:31.080 --> 17:33.080]  All right. You talk? Yeah.
[17:33.080 --> 17:34.080]  Talking.
[17:36.080 --> 17:37.080]  Better?
[17:37.080 --> 17:39.080]  Keep going. Yeah, I think so.
[17:40.080 --> 17:45.080]  OK. OK. Yeah, I'm using old school headphones. Usually I have my earphones on.
[17:46.080 --> 17:57.080]  I think we still have the crackling, but let's keep going. We'll do another round of troubleshooting if it's still going. All right. Go for it. Other James.
[17:58.080 --> 18:05.080]  So we had a recipe, the Newcombe recipe that we were kind of working on. How's that going?
[18:06.080 --> 18:09.080]  I put it I put it to a group of people to.
[18:11.080 --> 18:15.080]  To to try to put together, I just didn't have the time to do it.
[18:16.080 --> 18:28.080]  But I have people that have put it together and said that it worked, but it didn't really save a much money because the acquiring of the large batches of materials that go into it.
[18:29.080 --> 18:31.080]  It really wasn't it wasn't the savings.
[18:31.080 --> 18:34.080]  Yeah. Newcombe's an amazing product. It's expensive, but it's amazing.
[18:35.080 --> 18:46.080]  Yeah, it really is. The yeast, the citric acid with the potassium salts. I mean, that combination is is is highly effective against mites and any other things.
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.080]  Yeah. You just got to watch out spring micronized sulfur and back to back with it.
[18:51.080 --> 18:57.080]  Yep. Yeah. I don't even use that again. That's as far as my thresholds. I don't I don't utilize it.
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.080]  Because it's just not allowed in most of the markets that you're in.
[19:02.080 --> 19:11.080]  Yeah. Excellent. So let's talk a little bit more about IPM and we could talk about.
[19:12.080 --> 19:24.080]  Yeah, I think we have a lot of breeders on the show that are curious as to what can I spray if I have issues when I'm intermingling my plants and I have pollen that I'm concerned about.
[19:24.080 --> 19:30.080]  We got pollen flying, but I don't want to use any. What would you recommend besides prevention?
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.080]  Because I feel like prevention is the best thing. So you never get to that point.
[19:35.080 --> 19:44.080]  You recommend taking your males out of the room and then if you can take take your males out or what would your best suggestions be for issues like that?
[19:45.080 --> 19:52.080]  Yeah, definitely separating and segregating as much as you can and then having different treatments for for the different plants.
[19:52.080 --> 20:18.080]  For me, I like I like to make sure that people understand that that when you talk about treatments, physical treatment, when you talk about a barrier between a risk area and a low risk area is more effective, 10 times more effective than prevention or chemical treatments in any way.
[20:19.080 --> 20:42.080]  And so if there is a way to physically segregate out your population, no matter whether you're doing breeding or just general cultivation, separating and segregating as much as you possibly can through some sort of barrier is much higher recommended than any chemical or biological tool.
[20:43.080 --> 20:58.080]  Things like air curtains in large scale grows. Things like PPE, the use of PPE and actual sanitation protocols, physical barriers, those types of things are so much more effective.
[20:59.080 --> 21:15.080]  And then the next recommendation down would be biological methods, which are going to use either isolates or communities of microorganisms or macro organisms to combat your integrated pest management tools.
[21:16.080 --> 21:30.080]  And then after that, it's chemical treatment. So my recommendation is that no matter what you're producing, if there is a way to physically separate, like you're saying, physically separating out and then treating individually, I would recommend that.
[21:31.080 --> 21:40.080]  Nice. So definitely setting your grow up correctly from the beginning is probably the most important thing right there.
[21:40.080 --> 21:57.080]  Yeah. Don't skimp on your facility, whether it's a tent or a greenhouse or indoor facility. Never skimp on the climate, the stuff that will prevent pest management solutions or prevent pathogens and insects.
[21:57.080 --> 22:10.080]  The initial capital that it takes to build a grow properly to the point where you're not going to have issues, or at least you're going to be able to mitigate those issues to the maximum of your ability is so important.
[22:11.080 --> 22:21.080]  And that's where I see a lot of the cultivators fail is they winged it in the beginning so that they could pull revenue so that they can use that revenue to improve their grow.
[22:22.080 --> 22:27.080]  It doesn't work that way when it comes to pest prevention and integrated pest management. Definitely.
[22:28.080 --> 22:31.080]  Yeah. It's so much easier building it from the ground up than retrofitting too.
[22:32.080 --> 22:43.080]  Always. And we'll talk about that later on the business development side. But at the same time, it's a lot cheaper to do that retrofit. There's a way to do both.
[22:43.080 --> 22:59.080]  But when it comes down to having the right tools in place and having the right equipment in place and having the right climate in place, there's no way to skimp on that and be as successful as if you bucked up in the beginning.
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.080]  Right.
[23:02.080 --> 23:03.080]  You asked about some of the...
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.080]  Do you want to say something?
[23:06.080 --> 23:07.080]  Yeah, go ahead.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.080]  A little bit about seeds of redundancy?
[23:10.080 --> 23:11.080]  I'm sorry, what?
[23:11.080 --> 23:12.080]  Oh, methods of redundancies.
[23:13.080 --> 23:29.080]  Yeah. Some of the methods that I recommend on redundancy, like for instance, I mentioned a lot of issues that people have are mites or root aphids. That's a very common thing that I encounter in the industry.
[23:30.080 --> 23:45.080]  If you're going to attack, for instance, root aphids and redundancy, using some sort of biological inoculant could have a great effect on those insects.
[23:46.080 --> 23:54.080]  And the ones I recommend are endopathogenic fungi. And so those are going to be the Iceria fumicera fumarosa.
[23:55.080 --> 24:01.080]  There's the Bavaria bassiana, which is commonly used in cannabis production.
[24:01.080 --> 24:30.080]  And how that works is the microorganism actually inoculates the outside of the insect and eventually works its way, pushing hyphae into the squishy insides of the insect through the spherical holes on the side and through the holes and through the eyes and eventually gets into the pest and kills it.
[24:31.080 --> 24:45.080]  Not only does it kill it, but it actually uses that as a nutrient source to sporulate and set out more propagules into the environment so that it can affect that aphid's buddies.
[24:46.080 --> 24:53.080]  And so endopathogenic fungi is highly recommended as something that I use as prevention and eradication.
[24:55.080 --> 25:12.080]  When you weaken the populations with an endopathogenic fungi and then you come in with a chemical treatment, maybe a couple days or a week afterwards, it takes about seven days for endopathogenic fungi to even settle and to become effective when you put them into their environment.
[25:13.080 --> 25:24.080]  And then about seven, maybe even two weeks afterwards, coming in with a chemical treatment, the ones I recommend are going to be full spectrum extracts of neem.
[25:24.080 --> 25:34.080]  I didn't say neem oil. I did not say neem oil. Neem oil is garbage. It is sludge. It's like smoking sludge concentrate.
[25:34.080 --> 25:46.080]  No, there's a product out there that have the full spectrum extract of neem. For instance, there's a product called debug turbo.
[25:46.080 --> 25:52.080]  Debug turbo is a product that is made very similarly to cannabis sauces.
[25:53.080 --> 26:01.080]  It extracts with high terpene sauces. And what they do is they use hydrocarbon extraction on neem seed oil.
[26:01.080 --> 26:08.080]  And they take everything out of the neem seed oil that's good and all the lipids and waxes and everything else is taken out of it.
[26:08.080 --> 26:16.080]  The azidectrin that's in it, that's naturally in it, becomes a more concentrated level.
[26:17.080 --> 26:26.080]  And the reason why neem sucks is it clogs up stomata. It causes caking.
[26:26.080 --> 26:31.080]  And then eventually microorganisms come in and eat those lipids and waxes and causes films.
[26:31.080 --> 26:38.080]  So with a product like debug turbo, like I said, they put through full extraction.
[26:38.080 --> 26:48.080]  They take only the good things out. And then that is applied to the root zone in high concentrations, regular applications, two to three times a week.
[26:48.080 --> 26:59.080]  And you can have a pretty high effect using redundancy in the endomal pathogenic fungi and then the extract of neem.
[26:59.080 --> 27:04.080]  See, the beauty of the extract of neem is it just doesn't have the azidectrin in it.
[27:04.080 --> 27:10.080]  It actually has the triterpenes that are what make neem good.
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.080]  That's a part of neem, the azidectrin and then the triterpenes.
[27:14.080 --> 27:17.080]  Those are the parts that are actually worth a damn.
[27:17.080 --> 27:23.080]  And those burn the eyes and the ectoskeleton of the insects.
[27:23.080 --> 27:33.080]  They actually leave the area. They try to leave the root zone of the plant when you put these triterpenes in versus kind of waiting it out or maybe having a reactive,
[27:33.080 --> 27:41.080]  reproductive period where you spray the chemical or whatever on it and then the aphid just shoots out more female babies.
[27:41.080 --> 27:45.080]  And those are not as affected by the chemical that you had come down with.
[27:45.080 --> 27:52.080]  If the if the if the aphids are leaving the environment to get the hell out of there because it's a toxic place to be, that's what you're looking for.
[27:52.080 --> 27:58.080]  And then you do sanitation protocols and regular cleanings to make sure that your aphids are cleaned up.
[27:58.080 --> 28:11.080]  So using that in addition to, if you can afford it, predatory nematodes for root aphids, highly effective.
[28:11.080 --> 28:19.080]  And you can put those out with the triterpene and azidectrin and the and the endomopathogenic fungi and they do not interact.
[28:19.080 --> 28:28.080]  They do not cancel each other out. And there's no issues with that. Multiple modes of action attacking one creature from different angles, using different weapons.
[28:28.080 --> 28:32.080]  For root aphids. For root aphids. But yeah, for root aphids.
[28:32.080 --> 28:40.080]  That's just an example of that redundancy, the chemical, biological and even physical, which is the sanitation protocols afterwards.
[28:41.080 --> 28:49.080]  If I spray out the material and then they all leave the pot and then they all walk back in after you've done the watering, what's the point?
[28:49.080 --> 29:00.080]  So if you're if you're actually staying on it and you're doing the root treatment and then as they're exiting, you're actually doing sanitation protocols and cleaning your trays and physically removing them from the environment.
[29:00.080 --> 29:07.080]  Again, three times a week for up to 10 weeks, depending on your population density. And that that is effective.
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.080]  The problem with that is people don't budget for that.
[29:12.080 --> 29:21.080]  Right. They don't write that into their production plan. They go, holy shit, I have root aphids.
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.080]  Well, I got to go. I got to do so. And then they go to the store and they're dropping this. They bring it all together.
[29:26.080 --> 29:33.080]  They don't get the right tools because this one doesn't have what they need. And so I'm just going to get azidectrin. I'm going to get azomax instead of this.
[29:34.080 --> 29:38.080]  Yeah, probably. James recommended and then it's not working and I don't understand why.
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.080]  The cranberry juice. I don't understand how the cranberry extract didn't work for the root aphids.
[29:44.080 --> 29:49.080]  You know, but there's lots of there actually is clients that believe stuff like that.
[29:49.080 --> 29:54.080]  You know, there's people out there that are like, oh, well, what's the most ineffective treatment that I can afford?
[29:55.080 --> 30:02.080]  Yeah. Yeah. And again, they don't. I always recommend to all of my clients to build a medicine cabinet.
[30:03.080 --> 30:18.080]  And a medicine cabinet to me is having the tools, the chemicals and materials, the tools that you need to eradicate any potential pest that you're going to have over the course of the next quarter, six months, a year.
[30:19.080 --> 30:27.080]  And knowing that you might have when if you're growing outdoors or in greenhouses, you might have periods of the year where you have more pressures than than not.
[30:28.080 --> 30:37.080]  But build a medicine cabinet so that you have a solution, at least one, if not two, if not three redundant solutions for each one of the problems.
[30:37.080 --> 30:49.080]  And it's in your medicine cabinet, in your grow, ready to be used and not having some sort of reactive solution to it, but more of a immediate control.
[30:50.080 --> 31:01.080]  So if you know that you're an indoor grower and you're in California, you might want to have aphid eradication tools ready to go in your medicine cabinet, ready to go.
[31:01.080 --> 31:08.080]  You might want to have Russet mites as a targeted potential threat for you.
[31:09.080 --> 31:13.080]  And then you have those materials on hand ready to address that issue if you don't have it.
[31:14.080 --> 31:22.080]  This stuff doesn't go bad for a year or two. I mean, the chances of you stocking up and not utilizing what's in your medicine cabinet, it never happens.
[31:23.080 --> 31:29.080]  You end up going through your medicine cabinet and re-upping it every year because everybody has the same pressures.
[31:29.080 --> 31:44.080]  So if you can identify what your biggest pathogens and pests will be, create a medicine cabinet that supports those pressures and pests and have it written down somewhere.
[31:45.080 --> 31:54.080]  How do you address those things so I don't have to look at the back of the bottle and then wonder, oh, do I use 50% of the recommended amount for it to work?
[31:55.080 --> 31:57.080]  Do I use 100%? Do I use 200%?
[31:57.080 --> 32:09.080]  You already know this stuff by putting it into a journal and having a plan for how to attack it, especially if you're in a large scale grow and you have employees doing this for you.
[32:10.080 --> 32:12.080]  Operating procedures are so important.
[32:13.080 --> 32:19.080]  If you don't have the operating procedure written down for how to address root aphids before you grow cannabis, you're already behind the ball.
[32:20.080 --> 32:29.080]  And so budget for it. Know how much those materials cost. Put them in your medicine cabinets so that you know exactly how much you paid for it. Put it in there.
[32:30.080 --> 32:36.080]  And then if you don't use it, that's even better. Say I bought $400 worth of material that I don't use.
[32:36.080 --> 32:43.080]  If I don't use that, that's nowhere near the amount of money I would have lost if a problem arose.
[32:44.080 --> 32:48.080]  If root aphids come in, I'm going to lose a lot more than $400.
[32:49.080 --> 32:50.080]  Sure.
[32:51.080 --> 32:58.080]  My recommendation is always have a medicine cabinet and a budget set aside for those materials.
[32:59.080 --> 33:09.080]  Have SOPs in place and make sure everybody understands why you use these materials and in what quantities and what schedule and regularity.
[33:10.080 --> 33:15.080]  One of the biggest things I deal with when I talk to people at large scale grows is I go out to the growers.
[33:16.080 --> 33:18.080]  The ones that are actually doing the applications for integrated pest management solutions.
[33:19.080 --> 33:22.080]  I ask them, what are you spraying in there? I don't know.
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.080]  Or they know what it is. Why are you spraying it? What does it do?
[33:29.080 --> 33:33.080]  And they go, I don't know. I'm just spraying this thing on because the thing says to do it.
[33:34.080 --> 33:42.080]  The most important part is making sure that everybody on your team understands why these materials work, how they work, and what regularity do they work.
[33:42.080 --> 33:48.080]  If I don't apply endomalopathogenic fungi every week, then there's no point in doing it.
[33:49.080 --> 33:55.080]  Don't waste your money. You might as well burn your cash if you're putting it out once a month as an eradication tool.
[33:56.080 --> 33:57.080]  At least you'll be warm. I hate that.
[33:58.080 --> 33:59.080]  That's right.
[34:00.080 --> 34:07.080]  Again, using PPE and sanitation protocols is the other recommendation.
[34:08.080 --> 34:28.080]  Even if you're in a tent, if you're in a large scale grow, keeping your grow clean and your employees clean is probably the second best way to prevent integrated pest management solutions.
[34:29.080 --> 34:30.080]  Super cost effective.
[34:30.080 --> 34:37.080]  Yes. Putting on clothes to go into my tent that don't go out everywhere else, it costs me a couple cents in the laundry.
[34:38.080 --> 34:45.080]  If I'm covering up in Tyvek suits to go into my large scale grow, those Tyvek suits, when you buy them in bulk, they're about five bucks a piece.
[34:46.080 --> 34:52.080]  It's worth it to invest in those barriers and those PPE and sanitation protocols.
[34:53.080 --> 34:59.080]  I think that's where a lot of companies and people are failing.
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.080]  It's not washing your hands, using gloves, cleaning their tools after every cut.
[35:06.080 --> 35:11.080]  Those types of things are the things that prevent problems.
[35:12.080 --> 35:14.080]  It's not some spray, not some chemical that you're going to hit with it.
[35:15.080 --> 35:19.080]  Employees going home in their grow rooms and bringing stuff back into the facility.
[35:19.080 --> 35:22.080]  I think that happens all the time, everywhere.
[35:23.080 --> 35:29.080]  All of our companies that we start up, it's a policy we sign an employee that you're not actually cultivating.
[35:30.080 --> 35:33.080]  Everybody signs those papers and then goes home to their grow.
[35:34.080 --> 35:40.080]  That's right. I can't follow them home, but at least I can protect my ass when the lawyers are asking, did you do what we did?
[35:41.080 --> 35:42.080]  Yes, I did.
[35:43.080 --> 35:46.080]  At the end of the day, you can't solve everything. You just have to try your best.
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.080]  What are some of the really common problems you see in grows that have easy fixes?
[35:52.080 --> 35:59.080]  Sanitation. Cleaning with the right materials. Sanitate. Zero-toll.
[36:00.080 --> 36:10.080]  Please, everybody, use a product like that or those two products in your grow and you will change the whole climate in there.
[36:11.080 --> 36:13.080]  Let's talk about those two products really quickly.
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.080]  Sanitate and zero-toll are almost identical. They're just in different concentrations.
[36:17.080 --> 36:30.080]  Correct. I like to use zero-toll for surfaces, tools, equipment, floors, walls, foggers, those types of things.
[36:31.080 --> 36:33.080]  For putting on surfaces to clean it.
[36:33.080 --> 36:42.080]  Sanitate, I actually will utilize in lines, in irrigation lines, and actually will utilize on the plant itself in the root if necessary.
[36:43.080 --> 36:53.080]  If I need to come in and clean and eradicate anything, say I have a bacterial infection that's going on in the root zone, I'll come in and treat it.
[36:54.080 --> 36:59.080]  Create a clean slate scenario that's going to be a lot easier for me to do.
[36:59.080 --> 37:06.080]  I can come in and treat it and create a clean slate scenario that I can re-inoculate with some sort of beneficial microorganism.
[37:07.080 --> 37:22.080]  I think that the reason why those two tools are effective is that zero-toll and sanitate, they have peroxic acid in addition to hydrogen peroxide.
[37:22.080 --> 37:33.080]  Peroxic acid is, if anybody's ever worked in an analytical laboratory, the way that you clean your materials is you wash them and then you do an acid bath.
[37:34.080 --> 37:40.080]  The acid bath breaks up all the minerals and mineralates that are stuck to the surface that soap doesn't clean off.
[37:41.080 --> 37:43.080]  Those mineralates are what microorganisms consume.
[37:44.080 --> 37:51.080]  If I just use soap or I use even bleach, which doesn't get off the mineralates, it kills the microorganisms, but it doesn't get the mineralates off.
[37:52.080 --> 37:57.080]  Then an algae comes along, hey, there's a bunch of minerals here for me to digest and utilize.
[37:58.080 --> 38:05.080]  Now you have an inoculated surface because your surface is covered in food for the microorganisms.
[38:06.080 --> 38:12.080]  If I use an acid or a peroxic acid solution, it's going to wipe out all those mineralates and you actually have a clean surface.
[38:14.080 --> 38:17.080]  That's really the difference in why those are awesome.
[38:18.080 --> 38:31.080]  Utilizing isopropyl alcohol when it's necessary for anything that's metal, your tools, your scissors, anything that's metal, I would recommend using isopropyl alcohol.
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.080]  Unless you're trying to prevent HPLV, then you need bleach or something a little stronger.
[38:38.080 --> 38:47.080]  When you cut to the viral level, bleach isn't as effective, but the Sanodate and all those other things are as effective.
[38:48.080 --> 38:58.080]  Using chlorine products, it's an iffy subject in cannabis, but if it's all you have, it's better than nothing.
[38:59.080 --> 39:04.080]  CLO2 to clean your lines, I get it. That's chlorine dioxide. That works great for cleaning lines.
[39:04.080 --> 39:07.080]  Let's take a step back and talk about alcohol.
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.080]  I think there's a lot of people that think 90 plus percent alcohol is better than 70 percent.
[39:14.080 --> 39:17.080]  I think that's one of the biggest misconceptions in the whole world.
[39:18.080 --> 39:20.080]  People go, oh, 90, it's a little more expensive. It must be better.
[39:21.080 --> 39:22.080]  You want to talk about that a little bit?
[39:23.080 --> 39:30.080]  Yeah. When you talk about 70 percent alcohol, a 70 with 30 percent being distilled water.
[39:30.080 --> 39:45.080]  If you're attacking microorganisms with an alcohol, there needs to be a water barrier between the microorganism and the alcohol.
[39:46.080 --> 39:53.080]  The microorganisms absorb water and they utilize water for their metabolic activities.
[39:53.080 --> 40:02.080]  If you have a precursor of water into the microorganism, or at least a higher concentration of hydrogen and oxygen bonded together,
[40:03.080 --> 40:14.080]  being there next to the microorganism as the alcohol is attacking it, the microorganism literally absorbs that water and then it takes in the alcohol as well.
[40:15.080 --> 40:27.080]  70 percent to me, from all of the studies that I've ever read, and please look them up, there are plenty of scientific studies and journals that talk about this,
[40:28.080 --> 40:38.080]  where having a water barrier with microorganism eradication with alcohol is highly effective versus having 99 or pain alcohol or 90 percent.
[40:39.080 --> 40:47.080]  Totally. And then even surfaces. The other thing is, if you're sanitizing a surface and you have 90 percent, the evaporation rate is so much faster than the 70 percent.
[40:48.080 --> 40:56.080]  I think most people, when you look at a stainless steel table, depending on the grade, there's different grades.
[40:57.080 --> 41:02.080]  There's ones that are $50 and there's ones that are $700 for the same exact table, at least looking at it.
[41:02.080 --> 41:09.080]  But then if you look at it, Peter McGuire taught me this about the porous, the ones that are more expensive are less porous.
[41:10.080 --> 41:15.080]  And that 70 percent, you basically put that on there, it's going to evaporate slower, so it's going to sanitize better.
[41:16.080 --> 41:22.080]  Yep. So it's going to evaporate less and it'll be there longer, killing more microorganisms. Correct.
[41:23.080 --> 41:31.080]  Right. Totally. Excellent. So what other things do you see all the time that people can correct?
[41:32.080 --> 41:40.080]  Basic stuff. Well, let's talk about how people can fix problems. I mean, everybody knows what the problems are, right?
[41:41.080 --> 41:47.080]  There's aphids and there's powdery mildew and there's molds and there's, yeah, I could sit here all day and talk about each one of those.
[41:48.080 --> 41:55.080]  I think it's more important that you're able to identify what your problem is. Right. So to me, it's all about microscopy.
[41:55.080 --> 42:01.080]  Get yourself a digital microscope and utilize it. Have the ones that shoot the image to your phone.
[42:02.080 --> 42:08.080]  And they're so effective in identifying what your problems are, especially when you talk about mites.
[42:09.080 --> 42:18.080]  Try to identify the species of mite. I know I walked into a grow one year and everybody's freaking out about all these new clones that keep coming back or mites all over it.
[42:18.080 --> 42:27.080]  And so they keep spraying chemicals on it and bringing the genetic strength down. And by the time these cuts are growing into veg, they've just been phytotoxied.
[42:28.080 --> 42:39.080]  I go, let's take a look. Pop it under a microscope. Those are predatory mites that were put up there by Dark Heart and they put them on there so that you wouldn't have issues.
[42:40.080 --> 42:50.080]  You need to need to have the full picture identifying and knowing what your problems are. Is it a rusted mite or is it a spider mite? Is it a two spotted?
[42:51.080 --> 42:57.080]  What is it? And then understanding that each one of those have completely different eradication techniques.
[42:58.080 --> 43:05.080]  So microscopy and then I think analysis, if you have it, if you're in a larger scale grow or you're in a licensed grow,
[43:05.080 --> 43:16.080]  if you can get your plants having a crown analysis, I don't know too many people in cannabis that do this. Everywhere I go, I recommend it. And then they are much more successful.
[43:17.080 --> 43:24.080]  And it's essentially just sending in actual plants with a little bit of root material, the crown of the plant.
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.080]  And then you just slice off the plant at the top. So it looks like just a stalk, a little bit of roots on the bottom.
[43:30.080 --> 43:40.080]  Sending those into the laboratories to see if you actually have some sort of pathogen, some sort of vascular tissue damage.
[43:41.080 --> 43:48.080]  You would never be able to know unless you send these off to the lab. I have gone into so many groves and they just don't even know what their issue is.
[43:49.080 --> 44:00.080]  Turns out it's a phytophthora or some sort of Pythium. Right. And every time we try to grow the plants, they grow to this stage and then they turn to crap.
[44:01.080 --> 44:12.080]  Well, that's what Pythium does. It doesn't want to kill the plant. It wants to utilize the plant enough so that it can send out more Oomycetes and more Propygules into the environment.
[44:13.080 --> 44:22.080]  So identifying if you have those issues by getting crown samples. Those are done in California by hemp farms.
[44:23.080 --> 44:33.080]  Just a recommendation. Every state that has hemp now has hemp analysis laboratories for doing crowns.
[44:33.080 --> 44:41.080]  Even the universities are doing them. And a cannabis plant and a hemp plant when sent to the lab as a crown are essentially the same.
[44:42.080 --> 44:50.080]  So if you have the resource available to you to utilize those laboratory analysis and actually identifying what your problems are.
[44:50.080 --> 45:10.080]  I had a grove in Oakland that did this and they had 100% inoculation rate for Fusarium. They had no idea. And so every day, three buildings, every one of their buildings had it.
[45:11.080 --> 45:24.080]  And so if you don't know, you don't know. And so microscopy, identifying your problems and using lab analysis is probably the best way to cure all of your issues when it comes to integrated pest management.
[45:25.080 --> 45:38.080]  Now, you're asking what are the biggest problems that people see? The biggest problem I see is getting genetics from other people and having them bring garbage into your grove.
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.080]  Your brand new facility you're bringing dirty clones in.
[45:43.080 --> 45:55.080]  Yeah, getting into a facility and bringing clones from any company in California is risky, to say the least. There are some wonderful companies out there that have clean products.
[45:56.080 --> 46:08.080]  And so doing the research and not chasing how much does the cut cost? No, it's how clean it is. Do they let you go visit? Can you go see your cuts before you take them home?
[46:09.080 --> 46:16.080]  Can you treat them at the nursery before you take them home?
[46:17.080 --> 46:30.080]  Can you tell your nursery to address these issues for you because you're scared of getting these problems? Can you put these products out on my cuts before I get them because that's part of my integrated pest management plan?
[46:31.080 --> 46:46.080]  You can stop all of those issues. If you buy clones from a retailer or even black market or whatever, chances are, I don't know, give me a number James, 80% chance there's something on it? 60% chance?
[46:47.080 --> 47:02.080]  Yeah, higher. It's probably above 80%. I would say into the 90s. It's very rare that you have someone on the black market that has a clean... I know a couple people. But most people in those environments, they have closed loop systems that they keep for themselves.
[47:03.080 --> 47:11.080]  There's not a lot of people that put the time and effort into having a good IPM program for their nurseries. It's challenging and it's difficult.
[47:12.080 --> 47:28.080]  Yeah, I think that if you can have a preventative, sorry, eradicative treatment ready for your cuts and clones before they come in. Here's an example of something that I would utilize, right?
[47:28.080 --> 47:40.080]  If I'm not allowed into the nursery before I purchase them, but I go out and I drive out with my box truck and I go out to pick up 1000 cuts or 2000 cuts, what have you.
[47:41.080 --> 47:50.080]  First thing I'm going to do is bring all of my materials with me to treat those plants right there in the box truck.
[47:51.080 --> 48:02.080]  As we're loading them in the box truck, they go through a dip process and I already have my bins out and I have everything. Every tray comes in and gets dipped and it gets moved over to this one and it gets sprayed on the top.
[48:02.080 --> 48:20.080]  If I feel that there's an issue or risk of root aphids, yeah, I'm going in with the debug turbo dip on the roots and then maybe an MP treatment or maybe something with a potassium salts on top.
[48:21.080 --> 48:27.080]  And then that goes into the box truck and then usually I take that box truck back to the grow.
[48:28.080 --> 48:41.080]  I'll wheel out a couple CO2 tanks, put that in the back of the box truck, pop that CO2 tank wide open, got my little meter in there, keeping it above 3000 ppm and sometimes 4500.
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.080]  And just letting it sit in there and make sure that it's climate controlled and the sun's not beating down on my box truck.
[48:47.080 --> 49:02.080]  But just having that CO2 treatment go in and then as it's coming out, they go to a separate area within the grow, usually within a loading dock area, where they are fully inspected by, get this everybody, an integrated pest management specialist.
[49:03.080 --> 49:11.080]  Every company, if you're doing large scale or just medium scale grows, should have an integrated pest management specialist and you doesn't have to be college trained.
[49:12.080 --> 49:19.080]  It has to be somebody whose job it is to make sure that you are preventing and eradicating all the microorganisms possible.
[49:20.080 --> 49:21.080]  And that's their job.
[49:22.080 --> 49:23.080]  Pretty much every grow should have one.
[49:24.080 --> 49:25.080]  Every facility, as you're saying.
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.080]  And then at what point do you scale to one person that that's all they do for their full time job?
[49:30.080 --> 49:33.080]  I think if you have a license, that's it.
[49:34.080 --> 49:35.080]  You have one person that there's a full time job.
[49:36.080 --> 49:37.080]  If you're a hemp farm, definitely.
[49:38.080 --> 49:40.080]  You should have one, maybe even three.
[49:41.080 --> 49:42.080]  Sure.
[49:43.080 --> 49:48.080]  But their job is to inspect the problems and go in and do audits.
[49:49.080 --> 49:56.080]  Their job is to focus on making sure that they have all the materials necessary.
[49:57.080 --> 50:02.080]  They focus on making sure the equipment is sanitized and ready to be used.
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.080]  They do the scheduling for the applications.
[50:07.080 --> 50:09.080]  They do the acquisition of all the materials.
[50:10.080 --> 50:11.080]  They have their own budgets.
[50:12.080 --> 50:25.080]  And the growers work in tandem with these individuals on a schedule, meaning the growers know that the integrated pest management solution specialist is coming into grow room five to do a fully run inspection.
[50:26.080 --> 50:27.080]  And they're going to do your treatment on this day.
[50:28.080 --> 50:29.080]  And that's on the schedule and that's part of it.
[50:30.080 --> 50:31.080]  But he's not part of the team.
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.080]  He's not part of the grow.
[50:34.080 --> 50:38.080]  You're not pulling a grower from one room who is doing planting.
[50:39.080 --> 50:40.080]  And then now he's got to go do integrated pest management.
[50:41.080 --> 50:42.080]  No, no, no, no, no.
[50:43.080 --> 50:45.080]  That way somebody focuses on that all day long.
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.080]  And then you have one person who's task it is to ensure that you don't have those pressures.
[50:51.080 --> 50:52.080]  It's the only way to be successful.
[50:53.080 --> 50:55.350]  Awesome.
[50:55.350 --> 50:57.350]  So we had a question about CO2 treatment.
[50:58.350 --> 51:00.350]  How long do you do the CO2 treatment for?
[51:01.350 --> 51:02.350]  12 to 24 hours.
[51:03.350 --> 51:04.350]  12 hours is good.
[51:05.350 --> 51:06.350]  But no, no less than 12.
[51:07.350 --> 51:08.350]  No less than 12.
[51:09.350 --> 51:10.350]  OK.
[51:11.350 --> 51:12.350]  Let's see.
[51:13.350 --> 51:14.350]  Let me talk about another treatment real quick.
[51:15.350 --> 51:16.350]  Sure.
[51:16.350 --> 51:20.350]  If you have a large scale grow or even if you don't.
[51:20.350 --> 51:26.350]  If you can get your temperature in your grow room after you've taken the plants out.
[51:27.350 --> 51:28.350]  So you've done a harvest.
[51:29.350 --> 51:34.350]  Well, first of all, everybody stop doing continuous harvests and continuous grow rooms.
[51:35.350 --> 51:36.350]  Stop, stop, stop.
[51:37.350 --> 51:42.350]  The only way to really have a clean environment is to chop your plants down and clean the entire room.
[51:43.350 --> 51:47.350]  If you have plants growing in tandem at different phases, you're always going to have issues.
[51:47.350 --> 51:51.350]  But if you can isolate your grows into one room or you're doing it in a tent.
[51:52.350 --> 51:54.350]  And after you take those plants out and you harvest.
[51:55.350 --> 51:59.350]  If you could treat that area at 140 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours.
[52:00.350 --> 52:05.350]  You will successfully kill definitely every micro-organism.
[52:06.350 --> 52:07.350]  Sorry, every macro-organism that's in there.
[52:08.350 --> 52:13.350]  Or at least push the populations down to a preventative level treatment level.
[52:14.350 --> 52:23.350]  But for instance, if I can go into a large scale grow and we can make sure that the sprinklers are rated to 140 degrees.
[52:24.350 --> 52:28.350]  Because you don't want to set off the sprinkler systems by by blasting heat in there.
[52:29.350 --> 52:34.350]  And actually using an artificial heat source.
[52:35.350 --> 52:40.350]  Propane burners, the heaters they use to dry out buildings when they flood.
[52:40.350 --> 52:45.350]  Gas heater systems that bring tubes into the room and bring in that temperature up.
[52:46.350 --> 52:48.350]  Using your lights does not work.
[52:49.350 --> 52:50.350]  It does not work.
[52:51.350 --> 52:53.350]  So you can bring your temperature at 140 degrees with your lights.
[52:54.350 --> 52:59.350]  But because of the different temperature zones above the lights, it just doesn't have the same effect.
[53:00.350 --> 53:06.350]  But if you can treat your rooms at 130, 140 degrees for two hours, highly effective.
[53:06.350 --> 53:07.350]  Plus CO2 treatments.
[53:08.350 --> 53:13.350]  If you have injection lines or burners and you can bring that CO2 level up at the same time.
[53:14.350 --> 53:21.350]  Then you are doing a really good job at non-chemical integrated pest management solutions.
[53:22.350 --> 53:26.350]  So what's your best recommendation for getting your temperatures up?
[53:27.350 --> 53:28.350]  Turning off the fans?
[53:29.350 --> 53:30.350]  Letting it go? Trying to control it that way?
[53:31.350 --> 53:32.350]  With your lights?
[53:33.350 --> 53:34.350]  No, not with lights.
[53:34.350 --> 53:35.350]  Again, using a separate...
[53:36.350 --> 53:38.350]  I was listening.
[53:39.350 --> 53:42.350]  Peter was listening. Okay, good.
[53:43.350 --> 53:46.350]  So do we want to jump into sanitation?
[53:47.350 --> 53:48.350]  Yeah, we could do that.
[53:49.350 --> 53:54.350]  Yeah. So some of your techniques that you use for sanitation and common problems.
[53:55.350 --> 54:03.350]  Sure. I mean, really the biggest technique is maintaining your air quality.
[54:04.350 --> 54:05.350]  Your air flow systems.
[54:06.350 --> 54:20.350]  Making sure that if you're in an indoor grow, in a large scale grow or a licensed grow, that you're cleaning your ducts, your vents, your HVAC system and your coils.
[54:21.350 --> 54:24.350]  If you're using some sort of climate system, right?
[54:25.350 --> 54:29.350]  Heating, air conditioning. If you're cleaning your coils and maintaining those, that's true sanitation.
[54:29.350 --> 54:36.350]  If you're walking into a room and spraying Xeritol on the walls and on the floor and then that's it, that's not sanitation.
[54:37.350 --> 54:47.350]  Because when your air blows right back into that room with all of those spores and powdery mildew and who knows, body parts of whatever mite that's in there.
[54:48.350 --> 54:52.350]  If you're not cleaning out your ducting systems, I think you're really missing out.
[54:52.350 --> 54:58.350]  Even if you're in a tent, making sure that your air filters, if you have filters using those, are clean.
[54:59.350 --> 55:03.350]  If you're using HEPA coming in, make sure your HEPA filter is replaced and clean.
[55:04.350 --> 55:17.350]  But I think really just maintaining your HVAC and ducting is the number one place where most companies don't succeed in their sanitations.
[55:18.350 --> 55:24.350]  Floors and walls. Using a fogger to treat your walls.
[55:25.350 --> 55:30.350]  If you're in a room that has drywall, don't use a fogger. I guess you could.
[55:31.350 --> 55:35.350]  If you're in a room with drywall, don't. Stop, please.
[55:36.350 --> 55:40.350]  Put some sort of insulated, or not even insulated, panelling, steel panelling on the wall is more effective.
[55:41.350 --> 55:47.350]  Just so that you can get in a way that you can actually spray liquid on your walls and be able to clean them off.
[55:48.350 --> 56:06.350]  If you have that already set up, say you have IMP panelling in a cultivation centre, using foggers with Xerotol, and then getting as much of that material into every crevice that would allow it as possible.
[56:06.350 --> 56:16.350]  Hand wiping and cleaning is very effective. There has to be some aspect of wiping down in grows when you talk about sanitation.
[56:17.350 --> 56:24.350]  Biggest problem that people don't do is the conduit. You've got to remember the conduit is warm. This is where the power runs through, right? It's warm.
[56:25.350 --> 56:30.350]  This is a great place for powdery mildew to sit and wait and actually go into a hibernation state.
[56:31.350 --> 56:45.350]  This is a great place for mites and other insects to hibernate and wait out this phase until the next phase of lush, beautiful plants comes in on your lights and around your electrical.
[56:46.350 --> 56:54.350]  Focusing heavy on those, but making sure that you're not soaking those areas. That's when hand wiping comes into play.
[56:55.350 --> 57:03.350]  If you're using a fogger around conduit, danger, danger, Will Robinson, watch where you're spraying that thing. For those areas, come in and do hand wiping and hand cleaning.
[57:04.350 --> 57:07.350]  Benches and trays.
[57:08.350 --> 57:21.350]  Most grows I see, the guys who are in charge of cleaning the trays are not the most educated growers. They are not the ones who understand the plant science.
[57:22.350 --> 57:26.350]  Generally speaking, they're usually the guys who just started there and they're working their way up.
[57:26.350 --> 57:33.350]  These guys and girls tend to not understand proper ways for cleaning benches and trays.
[57:34.350 --> 57:40.350]  Making sure that you're getting in between all of the cracks. If you see any green or any red color, that's algae.
[57:41.350 --> 57:48.350]  A lot of people don't realize that a pinkish hue to their previous white trays, now they're pink.
[57:49.350 --> 57:59.350]  That's actually an algae. If you're not eradicating that, you're causing enzyme issues for your roots and enabling other pathogens to exist.
[58:00.350 --> 58:05.350]  Really taking the time to make sure that you clean it properly.
[58:06.350 --> 58:12.350]  Tops and underneath. A lot of times I walk into a grow and there's rolling benches.
[58:12.350 --> 58:17.350]  They don't go underneath and clean the rolling bench areas. The mechanism is underneath there.
[58:18.350 --> 58:27.350]  Really it's just being anal retentive and being a total hypochondriac when it comes to am I cleaning properly.
[58:28.350 --> 58:34.350]  Using the right tools, the right brushes, the right sponges, the right rags.
[58:35.350 --> 58:38.350]  Making sure that those materials are clean and new when you start.
[58:38.350 --> 58:43.350]  I see a lot of companies that use the same sponge over and over and over again.
[58:44.350 --> 58:50.350]  You're sanitizing it with the materials, but after a while those just become vectors for disease.
[58:51.350 --> 58:58.350]  Would one of the onboarding questions to new employees be, do you have a little bit of OCD?
[58:59.350 --> 59:00.350]  I mean, totally.
[59:01.350 --> 59:03.350]  That'd be a positive trait.
[59:04.350 --> 59:08.350]  There's a certain type of person that I like when I get into a grow.
[59:09.350 --> 59:14.350]  Somebody that just cannot do it wrong.
[59:15.350 --> 59:17.350]  Has to do it right every time.
[59:18.350 --> 59:23.350]  Especially when you talk to people that want to work their way up in the company.
[59:24.350 --> 59:25.350]  People that recognize those things.
[59:25.350 --> 59:30.350]  Being able to train people to do it right.
[59:31.350 --> 59:34.350]  Anybody off the street can be trained to do any task in a grow.
[59:35.350 --> 59:38.350]  You just have to have the right training and you have to have the right standard operating procedures.
[59:39.350 --> 59:43.350]  You have to have auditing and testing of that individual.
[59:44.350 --> 59:46.350]  Does this individual understand how to clean a bench?
[59:47.350 --> 59:48.350]  How do I test that?
[59:49.350 --> 59:51.350]  He doesn't know I'm watching. I'm looking at him on the cameras.
[59:52.350 --> 59:53.350]  Or I'm sitting outside the grow watching him clean the thing.
[59:53.350 --> 59:54.350]  And he's worried about his headphones.
[59:55.350 --> 59:56.350]  And he changes his song every five minutes.
[59:57.350 --> 59:58.350]  He touches his face.
[59:59.350 --> 01:00:00.350]  He's not wearing gloves.
[01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:03.350]  And again, then I write up a little report.
[01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.350]  Put it in front of him. Let him know that this is not the protocols.
[01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:08.350]  Here are the protocols.
[01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:10.350]  And you don't start firing people and writing them up.
[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.350]  It's just about education.
[01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:16.350]  If I have to teach this guy nine times how to clean a bench, that's okay.
[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:18.350]  That's okay.
[01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.350]  Maybe people just don't get it.
[01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:29.350]  If you teach them the right way to do it and they consistently know the right way to do it and choose to do it another way, that's a different subject.
[01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.350]  Yeah, you have to get rid of people like that for sure.
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:36.350]  Totally. And that's three out of four people, generally speaking.
[01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:39.350]  Unfortunately, yeah. There's just so many people they want to be creative.
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.350]  It's not a creative role typically.
[01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.350]  But that goes away. You can look across different occupations all over the place.
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:50.350]  Me with my background in kitchens, people want to be creative. You got to be the chef to be creative.
[01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:53.350]  If you're a cook, you just need to cook.
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.350]  You're like, I get to be creative. None of you do.
[01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:58.350]  Right.
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:00.350]  I'm the boss.
[01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:02.350]  My father taught me at a very young age. He said to me one thing.
[01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:07.350]  He said, the worst thing you could do is show initiative.
[01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:15.350]  Do what the boss wants you to do and you will be president of the company.
[01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:17.350]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:20.350]  Do not show initiative.
[01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.350]  Take it how you want. But I took it that way. It really makes sense. It really does.
[01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.350]  Just do what the guy wants because he knows more than you.
[01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:36.350]  And then in a couple of years, months, whatever, you could be at that level.
[01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:38.350]  Definitely.
[01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:44.350]  Yeah, I think even breeding, I think following the people that you respect the most and kind of seeing what they're doing.
[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:51.350]  I feel like there's a lot to be said about mimicking people, whether it's breeding or anything like that.
[01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:56.350]  If you're just starting out, kind of looking at what the best people do and kind of following those paths.
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:02:03.350]  Rather than trying to think outside the box and see what concentration of STS you can use that's more effective.
[01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:06.350]  There's one recipe that really works. Use that.
[01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.350]  Yep. And never stop learning, right?
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:15.350]  I still go and visit growers and meet with people and watch them do what they do.
[01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:20.350]  And I learn something every time. And so don't think you know everything.
[01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.350]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:24.350]  Because you don't.
[01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:30.350]  Yeah. No matter how old you get, you're constantly learning because we're constantly evolving in this industry.
[01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:36.350]  In some ways, it's so new. We've been around a while. You've been doing stuff a while.
[01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:40.350]  I've been smoking since 91. I've been growing for a really long time.
[01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:42.350]  Yeah, 95.
[01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:46.350]  I'm constantly learning stuff. Thanks to the Grateful Dead, right?
[01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:49.350]  Among other people. Some people, right?
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.350]  Yeah. I want to talk a little bit about tools for sanitation.
[01:02:55.350 --> 01:03:01.350]  One of those things can be light treatments in your intake.
[01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:10.350]  There's a lot of good science behind UV and titanium dioxide lighting inside your light ducts.
[01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:15.350]  And I think that that's a portion of sanitation that a lot of people don't consider.
[01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:25.350]  And it costs very little for the return that you get if you put UVs in your coils, in each one of your HVAC systems.
[01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:27.350]  It's highly effective.
[01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:34.350]  And then also, there's using lighting UV in your grow facility.
[01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:45.350]  If you're putting UV bars up, they've shown in studies with UV bars in greenhouses that there's a much lower pathogen occurrence.
[01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:52.350]  If you just have those in the cultivation facility, which benefits the plant, right?
[01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:57.350]  Because it sees that spectrum that most lights and LEDs don't provide.
[01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:04.350]  So when you talk about equipment, yeah, using lighting, UV specifically and titanium dioxide systems.
[01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:11.350]  There's a system called FICEL that uses that as well.
[01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:26.350]  I think that if you're looking at a large scale grow or even something as big as a room, utilizing those UV lights for your air systems is something that I recommend.
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:28.350]  Nice.
[01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:37.350]  Can I give you an opportunity to plop your big KNF nuts on the table?
[01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:41.350]  So here's the comment.
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:47.350]  And I want to give you the opportunity to respond and maybe drop your domain.
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.350]  Do you dislike microbes?
[01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:52.350]  Are you a microbe hater?
[01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:54.350]  That's great.
[01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.350]  And go.
[01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:59.350]  Yeah, so I've actually trained mycologists.
[01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:01.350]  So I would say I dislike them.
[01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:05.350]  They actually got me into academia.
[01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:21.350]  So for everybody who doesn't know, I did working at the University of Hawaii and publishing papers for the University of Hawaii during my master's thesis period.
[01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.350]  I did four years of research on KNF farming.
[01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:35.350]  I've studied every material you can use in KNF from the fish solutions to the fermented plant solutions.
[01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:38.350]  I am 04.
[01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:57.350]  I wrote a hundred and something page study on the review of inoculants, indigenous microorganism inoculants, and how effective they are in large scale production or in agricultural production systems.
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:01.350]  And so I learned a lot of things over that time.
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.350]  I trained with Cho and all the groups out there.
[01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:10.350]  I'm sure a lot of you guys know Drake Weiner and all that are good friends of mine.
[01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:25.350]  And so I have, I feel like I've gone down the road as far as you can go on KNF on studying it from an analytical perspective.
[01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:35.350]  In my thesis, we studied the use of IMO4 in field application of corn and a couple other crops.
[01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:47.350]  We made the batches of IMO4 in multiple locations and did multiple tests in multiple production areas.
[01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:52.350]  So if you could understand how complicated that is to do, we did it.
[01:06:52.350 --> 01:07:07.350]  And in the end, you know, to make a long story short, we were able to discern that there was no significant effect of IMO4 on crop production.
[01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:36.350]  Mainly because, and the reason is, in Hawaii, at least, the microbe rich soils that they have there, by isolating out microorganisms from the environment, and then almost babying them at a level to create a compost pile like IMO4 with all of the high carbon and high nitrogen.
[01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:43.350]  Amendments that are added to it. Those microorganisms become very settled in that compost environment.
[01:07:44.350 --> 01:08:04.350]  But when they are applied to the field in competition with all of the other microorganisms that are in the field, they tend to not survive, or at least they don't show any significant change to microbial levels in the soil.
[01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:23.350]  So applying IMO4 multiple times over a long period of time, we did not see any difference of growth, crop size, microbial respiration, which is a measurement of the amount of microorganisms that are in soil.
[01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:39.350]  There was no nutritional difference, and no physical appearance from the crop, being leaf size or yield or what have you.
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:54.350]  No different than if I had taken IMO4, which I did, I made the IMO4, and then I took that IMO4 and put it in an oven, and I killed all the microorganisms that were in it.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:09:00.350]  So I had IMO4 that didn't have any microorganisms in it, it was essentially compost.
[01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:07.350]  Then I had IMO4 that did have the microorganisms in it, made it multiple locations, and then planted in multiple environments.
[01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:14.350]  There was no significant difference between the non-inoculated and the inoculated IMO4.
[01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:35.350]  And that when I look at the efficiency and the cost effectiveness of producing these materials and putting them in field application, it was much more cost effective to put out compost or some sort of mulch material and not inoculate it at all.
[01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:50.350]  And actually we found that there's more microorganism presence in the areas that are just given compost, because not ones that were toasted, if you will.
[01:09:51.350 --> 01:10:02.350]  A different study, putting out just compost actually has a better effect than going through the rigmarole of turning and heating and all these other things.
[01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:10.350]  So, no, I don't hate microorganisms, and I don't hate IMO4, and I know people that have had an effect with it.
[01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.350]  Notice I say an effect.
[01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:22.350]  And I know that people will take this material, put it at the base of their plants and see wonderful things happening to their plants.
[01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:40.350]  But from what I was able to discern, there would be no difference than putting out compost materials at the base of your plant and then just walking away and spending all that time with your family instead of stirring heated compost piles.
[01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:50.350]  But at the same time, the materials like fermented plant solutions that we studied that did have a pretty good effect on plants.
[01:10:52.350 --> 01:11:09.350]  But we also did discern that if we were to apply those same plant materials soaked in water and filtered with a strainer and then applied to the plant, we had very similar effects.
[01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:33.350]  Then if I went through the whole process of fermenting this type of root or that type of leaf or, you know, bringing these Japanese and Korean plants together to bring up the health of the plant, in the end, there was no different effect than, like I said, soaking your grass clippings in water and then putting it back out on your lawn.
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:12:02.350]  The fish solutions, those things work great. They are amazing. I have been using those since day one and I still utilize them. The issue is, is if you get those analyzed, depending on where you're at, there is a very high risk for cadmium and not cadmium, heavy metals.
[01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:17.350]  Generally, from those fishes coming from the ocean, that can contaminate your plants. And so that is something that I have experienced with the use of the fish material.
[01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:30.350]  If you're going to use it, all I have to say is please take the time to put a little in a bottle and send it to the extension laboratory near you and have them do an analysis for heavy metals before you utilize it.
[01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:50.350]  But the overall Korean natural farming thing, right, the overarching umbrella of it, there's a business aspect to it that you have to really understand.
[01:12:51.350 --> 01:13:10.350]  There's a money making scheme here. I hate to use that word, but they're trying to make money through the system and selling books and doing seminars and all those things. You got to understand that there is some capitalism as part of that.
[01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:37.350]  I can say you could take a lot of that away from it and there's some valid claims there. Now when you talk about living soil, most people's definition of living soil is a little bit different than K&F. Living soil, I would say the thing about K&F that I don't like is the language about
[01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:50.350]  these indigenous microorganisms are unique or would only be effective in this specific area with these specific plants on this specific hillside and all that. Okay, I get that.
[01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:53.350]  In the end,
[01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:56.350]  when you talk about
[01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.350]  just sustainable agriculture,
[01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:11.350]  the techniques of, and I'm forgetting the name, is it the German technique where we're planting logs and different brush.
[01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:13.350]  Hugelkultur.
[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.350]  Hugelkultur, right.
[01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:35.350]  There it is. Sorry, I was just brain farting on it. Something like that. That is highly applicable and I support that 100% and I think that anybody who does those types of systems are going to have a lot less pathogen issues. They're going to have a lot less pest issues and will be enriching their soils and making their environment a better place to be after they leave.
[01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:43.350]  Hugelkultur, right. That's the type of stuff that I do support and I know that there is some validity to.
[01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:59.350]  And it only makes sense because you put high lignin concentrations in the soil with wood and wood chips, you're going to have a high fungal population. If you're putting in manures, you're putting in green leaf materials.
[01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:12.350]  If you're putting in waste materials, you're going to have a high bacterial population. And so bringing those two together, it just makes perfect sense. And when you see it in application, it does have a wonderful effect.
[01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:17.350]  Those types of techniques when you say living soil,
[01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:23.350]  yeah, yeah, there's definitely some validity there. There needs to be a lot more research on it.
[01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:29.350]  I can't say that it gives you better yield. I can't say that it gives you a better product.
[01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:38.350]  What I can say is it helps the environment and when you leave that place, you will leave it better than what you saw when you got there.
[01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:50.350]  And you will be utilizing tools in biology that you wouldn't be able to access through conventional systems. So that's my little support of that. And then,
[01:15:50.350 --> 01:16:09.350]  again, I don't want to sound like I'm bashing KNF. What I want to make people realize is, after four years of working on something, and then every single time the data coming back a certain way, at some point, you switch sides.
[01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:31.350]  I got to understand, I chose and I funded my own thesis for four years at a state university so that I could study KNF. I was not going to be able to get any funds from any investor, any education, research grants or anything like that. Why? Because there's no data on it.
[01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:43.350]  I went to every place out there and said, I want to study this material that's an up and coming farming technique that's happening in Hawaii and in the West Coast and in Asia.
[01:16:44.350 --> 01:17:00.350]  There's been all of these books and all these things written about it. I want to do research on it. And then they keep saying, well, where's the peer reviewed article that says anything about this stuff? It didn't exist when I started doing it in 2014, 2015.
[01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:16.350]  It didn't exist. So I funded it myself, the four years of research, not cheap. And I did that because I was passionate about KNF. I thought it was the God's end of all agricultural methods.
[01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:34.350]  And then at some point when the data keeps coming back and keeps coming back, I've just gone down the road and I've gone as far down the road as I think I can. I'm sure that there's a lot more research I can do. But what I'm scared of is that it all comes back the same as what I saw over the course of four years.
[01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:50.350]  I think if I worked at KNF anymore, my wife would just kill me because I was all about it for years. And then all of a sudden the data just showed me that it's just not something as viable as people claim.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.580]  I think there are a bunch of unhappy people in the chat right now.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:17.580]  I debate this with people constantly. And I'm more than happy to take anybody's questions and anybody's thoughts. Yes. What I say is before you do that, read my paper first. Find the paper, read it, and then tell me what you think.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:39.580]  What was Drake's response when you told him the IMO for data? And then this, I know, sorry, this is the wrong. This guy asked related to the IMO for not being effective. Is that specific to Hawaii or do you think that's applicable if you're like in the Midwest or you don't know?
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:19:08.580]  No, because microbial densities in soils in South Dakota and in Iowa, in Canada, in Europe, in Hawaii, the density, the amount of CO2 that soil is expelling from microorganisms is generally about the same. I wouldn't say that there really would be much difference. What I can say is I don't know because nobody's done that same research project in South Dakota or where have you.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:28.580]  So I'm going to take the scientific scientist stance on that and say I really don't know. But I would say the level of competition that is naturally existing in soils is very high. Those microorganisms in that soil have been there for millennia.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:57.580]  And for you to take a fungi from the environment, build it up, and then bring it in high concentrations into that same environment, there's not enough resources for it. The tools that the, every microorganism has an archenemy, right? So whatever, you throw a high population of this fungi in, the other populations of the predators are the ones that don't, that compete for the resources. They increase as well.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:20.580]  What happens is they bite and then they both crash because there's no more resources left. If you're consistently, constantly putting IMO4 out, you will see an increased effect. But I recommend if you're going to do that on a plant that's right next to it, put compost out and then see if your effect is any different.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:37.900]  Nice. I'm sure we got some questions from the viewers. Let's just go right into some questions. So if you have questions, ask them now. Sound good, Peter? How you doing? Did we break the internet?
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:21:08.620]  I like giving different people kind of long form ability to make their case. Other people may disagree and I'm like, Steve, I see you. Happy to bring you on and let you talk about your, you know, experience, which is different. And we can do all of this in a civil way. But there were, yeah, I grabbed some questions earlier.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:22.620]  So Bud Kilowatt asked a while ago, and this was something we were talking about a couple of days ago on the show. Do you think Harpin protein is effective for IPM?
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.620]  Harpin protein? What's Harpin protein?
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:37.620]  That's a fair answer. All right. So we'll move on from that question. I like when people just say, I don't even know what that is.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.620]  I'll always tell you if I don't know. I'm not a fucking genius.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.620]  James, you can see the chat too, right?
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:53.620]  Yeah, I can. Where is the IMO research published?
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:22:03.620]  If you Google James Rushing, University of Hawaii, IMO 4, it'll probably be the first thing that comes up.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.620]  Google is your friend.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.620]  Yes.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:31.020]  So how about like, you know, you studied with Master Cho and then JADAM came along or JADAM. And have you done any research on that or played with it at all?
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:46.020]  No, to be honest, right at the time I published the IMO, the big paper, I went on to start up Big Island Grown and I left my analytical hat in the laboratory.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.020]  You hung up the cleats?
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.020]  The lab coat?
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:23:11.290]  How about, I mean, I have a question in terms of, you know, you talked about California common pests. What were some of the common pests or what you're dealing in Hawaii still? What are like some different pests you see in different places?
[01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:35.290]  So Hawaii pests is botrytis. I mean, when you talk about what is the thing that really puts a stop to any cannabis production system, whether it's indoor, outdoor, it's botrytis and bud rot. I'm sorry. Yeah, bud rot. Usually caused because of the temperature fluctuations and humidity fluctuations.
[01:23:35.290 --> 01:24:04.290]  And then if you're doing outdoor systems with the cabbage butterfly, causing all of those issues associated with bud rot. And that's where even in the licensed grows on Oahu, some of them on Big Island of Maui, when you're throwing away 25 to 50% of your product that you grow indoors or in a climate controlled system for botrytis, that's, you know,
[01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:18.290]  that's definitely I would say the biggest issue. How do you combat that? Making sure that you're growing in a consistent climate controlled environment. I know it's hard to do outdoors.
[01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:33.290]  If you're growing outdoors, the only way that you can really address it is preventative microorganism inoculants. One of them that is highly effective is EM1. So back to all you guys that love that stuff.
[01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:58.290]  I'm a big fan of EM1, effective microorganism one, Dr. Higa's invention that is essentially 17 plant effective microorganisms that you can batch make and you can brew your own from cultures and really maximizing your potential on your purchase.
[01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:15.290]  So say I could buy a gallon of EM1, I can turn that into, what is the ratio? What's 30 gallons or something like that. And then actually apply that on the plant multiple times a week during the bud phase.
[01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:29.290]  It's one of those few materials that goes onto a plant that I have not found had any effect on the trichome production or the calyx production of pistils or the general structure of the bud.
[01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.290]  Other effective tools.
[01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:44.290]  Back to the KNF stuff. The milk solution, the fermented milk solution works really good for botrytis.
[01:25:46.290 --> 01:26:01.290]  Where you're taking rice wash water and inoculating, taking that which is inoculated with microorganisms and then you add milk in there because those are lactic acid bacteria.
[01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:11.290]  And then applying lactic acid bacteria solutions to the plant. Now those you don't want to apply past maybe four weeks in the flower.
[01:26:11.290 --> 01:26:22.290]  They will affect pistol production and those proteins that are in there are a little iffy when you start talking about safety of buds if you were to get those tested.
[01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:29.290]  Those are some tools and really the biggest problem in Hawaii again was the rotting away of buds on the plant.
[01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:43.560]  Yeah, which is also a genetic issue using the right cultivars in your environments. I feel like so many people just want to put everything everywhere and really, you know, not everything belongs everywhere.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.560]  I was very successful in Hawaii with growing sativas, tropical sativas, staking with the louse and the ties.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:04.560]  And then several of the Moroccan strains that are coming out of Europe and some of the stuff that was in Amsterdam in the 90s did pretty good in Hawaii.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:14.560]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with breeding terpene profiles into structured plants that will work better in specific regions like Hawaii.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.560]  There's no reason to grow OG Kush out there outdoors or stuff like that. It's not meant for those regions.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  But so many people want to try or they're like, we need OG Kush.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.560]  And it's like, well, you can get the gas and you can breed that into equatorial or tropical varieties.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.560]  And that's the way of the future. Geoclimatized varieties of cannabis.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.560]  I think the more we learn about it, the more we'll know what to put where and what to breed and how to breed into stuff.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.560]  So it's actually not as complicated as what people think.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.560]  No, no, it's not. And again, in Hawaii, there's a lot of people who are like, well, we need OG Kush.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:04.560]  It's a big movement right now. You're going to see a lot of genetics coming out of Hawaii and coming into the market as far as seed products.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:18.560]  Look for those. Anything coming out of there is probably what it is, is probably a local Hawaiian that is blended with some sort of Amsterdam or West Coast strain and then stabilized.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.560]  A lot of the stuff, Pocalo seeds make some really great stuff.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  Gray skull, probably one of the best that are out there.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.560]  There's a lot of good stuff coming out of Hawaii right now, for sure.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.560]  Yeah, they've always had good quality cannabis. I mean, I remember getting stuff in the 90s from Hawaii that was really, really good.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.560]  So it's all the love. It's all the love. That's what makes it good.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  We have a cooking question.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.560]  All right.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.560]  What is the name of the amazing stuff you scrape up with the liquid after braising meat?
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.560]  I don't know.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.560]  Technical questions. You can Google that, I'm sure.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.560]  Yeah, that's funny.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.560]  Yeah.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.560]  How long is it soaked?
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:10.560]  Yeah.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:17.560]  How long is it soaked? 24 hours? No more than 24 hours. 12 to 24 hours.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:30.560]  They've shown in tests where they take blades of grass and then they put it in solution and they do measurements of the amount of materials that are coming out of the broken end of the grass.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.560]  And they've proven that between 12 and 24 hours, that is totally expelled.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.560]  And it's really just a matter of pressure density.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:53.560]  The amount of hydrogen molecules that are on the outside of that plant get pulled out because the amount that are on the inside of the leaf or what have you is less.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.560]  And it just gets pulled out because of the hydrogen that's in there.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560]  Nice.
[01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:06.990]  So, oh, banker plants. You want to talk about banker plants at all?
[01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.990]  Yeah.
[01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.990]  We haven't really discussed bankers yet.
[01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:14.990]  They're very effective. Trapments, those types of things.
[01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:22.990]  Having a plant that can receive your pests for you, right, and you can control them better.
[01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:27.990]  It really depends on where you're at.
[01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:40.990]  I highly recommend, especially if you're growing outside, that you're utilizing a local plant or you're utilizing something that can grow really well there in tandem with the cannabis.
[01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:50.990]  Having plants that also attract things like ladybugs are also highly effective as well.
[01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:56.990]  Some of the spiky weeds have great effect on keeping other weeds out.
[01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:07.990]  So if you're fine with having one species of weed and not 15 kinds that are competing for resources, you might want to start identifying those.
[01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:11.990]  Yeah, I think that there's a lot of science behind it.
[01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:36.990]  But at the same time, if there is a way to have a biological approach in addition to those banker plants, again, redundancy, having some sort of inoculant on the plant or in the soil environment that causes problems for the plant.
[01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:46.990]  If you're looking for the same pest that you're using the banker plants for, I say it's a great tool, not something you're going to utilize exclusively.
[01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:55.990]  Nice. Yeah, it's all about those tools used in tandem, as you've discussed.
[01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:58.990]  Yeah, and having the redundancy.
[01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:09.990]  Everything's about redundancy. If you're making seeds, it's important to have redundancy. It's a good idea to have some pollen saved in case your reversals don't go well if you're making feminized seeds.
[01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:13.990]  Redundancies are always great.
[01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.990]  Are we taking dabs now?
[01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:20.990]  Yeah, you should take dabs. You got some holy water? Is that from 2012?
[01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:26.990]  Yeah, this is from Nectar's Collective. He's now producing again.
[01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:31.990]  Oh, wow. So, Noel is now working for Flower Corp in Canada.
[01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:46.990]  No longer. They released him, but I'm not going to disclose that. He's getting stuff going back in California, and he's actually working with me as well under the consultancy umbrella.
[01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:55.990]  Oh, that's fantastic. So, Noel is one of our good friends that started Holy Water. He's one of the founders of Holy Water along with some other guys.
[01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:04.990]  They were the first guys to really focus on liquid terpenes like that where you can actually just pour it onto your dab.
[01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:11.990]  When it came out in the end of 2012, first part of 2013, people didn't even know what to do with it.
[01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:22.990]  We entered it together in some cups. When I was entering flowers, they came to Denver, and the judges said it was amazing, but they didn't know how to grade it against shatter.
[01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:28.090]  Sorry, is my torch being too loud?
[01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:31.090]  I muted you.
[01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:35.090]  Sorry, I'm a little high right now.
[01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:37.090]  That's okay.
[01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:42.090]  That also explains why I didn't hear you talking anymore. I was like, he just stopped saying what he was talking about.
[01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:44.090]  Yeah, so 2013 we entered…
[01:33:45.090 --> 01:33:46.090]  Stopped mid-sentence.
[01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:52.090]  Judges had no way of… I mean, it was really hard because we had a liquid product that we were entering in a cup.
[01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:55.090]  I feel like it was better than everything else, but they didn't have a way to really…
[01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:00.090]  It was hard to say how is it better than shatter and crumble and all these other things.
[01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:07.090]  Things have changed, and I feel like a lot of people have gone that sauce and diamonds direction, and now rosin is really popular.
[01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:10.090]  I believe he was working on some rosin projects and stuff like that as well.
[01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:14.090]  So, Noel is just an awesome extractor and a great guy.
[01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:22.090]  He has his Nectars now, right? He's Mr. Nectars.
[01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:26.090]  Yeah, Nectars Collective. Follow him on Instagram for sure.
[01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:30.090]  So, we're all going to watch this monster dab.
[01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:37.090]  Yeah, we're waiting. When you get a big snake, one gram dab, we're waiting.
[01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:43.090]  I'm going to put you full screen. Sorry, I need to cue up the music.
[01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:45.090]  Do we have music for this?
[01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:56.090]  I'm setting up my other computer where I can just pull stuff that's like snippets of songs that wouldn't get dinged for copyright.
[01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:07.710]  Look at that. Have you ever had 300 plus people watch you dab before?
[01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:09.710]  No, I haven't.
[01:35:10.710 --> 01:35:12.710]  All those investors, you're scaring off right now.
[01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:14.710]  Man, I'm already married.
[01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:16.710]  Let's talk about this.
[01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:21.710]  I'm married right now. I got a company I'm working with, Origins Investment.
[01:35:22.710 --> 01:35:24.710]  Awesome. They're out of Washington?
[01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:30.710]  Yeah, they're out of Washington. They own a dispensary in Redmond and one in West Seattle.
[01:35:31.710 --> 01:35:37.710]  They also have some in Oklahoma City, a couple of girls in Oklahoma City.
[01:35:38.710 --> 01:35:44.710]  They asked me to join their business development side of the company.
[01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:46.710]  Now I'm partners with them.
[01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:56.710]  What I've been doing the last year during COVID is, to be honest, is just sitting in front of my computer every day and getting licenses across the country.
[01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:03.710]  Buying and purchasing or renting land or facilities or pre-existing facilities or building them.
[01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:07.710]  And applying for licenses in emerging markets.
[01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:17.710]  Right now I'm working very hard on Georgia, which is a market that is only allowing low THC oil.
[01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:26.710]  And then we're in markets like California. We're shooting at Maine, which is recreational with cultivation, extraction, retail.
[01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:35.710]  And we're looking to expand as much as we can for the purpose of getting our IP out there.
[01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:44.710]  Because we are not just a cannabis company who owns licenses and operates, grows in cultivation facilities.
[01:36:45.710 --> 01:37:01.710]  We're actually an IT company who has developed a state-of-the-art recommendation engine for customers to really kind of sift through all of the products that are available in these emerging markets.
[01:37:02.710 --> 01:37:06.710]  And also competitive markets like Washington and Colorado and California.
[01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:17.710]  And it, through a series of questions, can make recommendations for cannabis products for individuals.
[01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:20.710]  Specifically ones that are kind of new to the game.
[01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:26.710]  So that they aren't overdosed. So they aren't given the wrong products.
[01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:33.710]  If they're not into smoking or they're not into vaping, what solutions do they have?
[01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:46.710]  And it's a wonderful IP program that can isolate out a person's needs from a cannabis menu.
[01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:57.710]  And let them know when new products that meet their criteria come out. Provide promotions for those.
[01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:05.710]  And then also this system is a fully operational ERP system for operational analytics.
[01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:21.710]  Which basically means if I change anything in operations, if I change this fertilizer or these lighting, I'm able to see what that effect is or could be to my bottom dollar in production.
[01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:28.710]  It's also seed-to-sale tracking all together in one. Plus POS systems.
[01:38:29.710 --> 01:38:34.710]  So that seed-to-sale plus the systems at the retail locations are all tied in together.
[01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:41.710]  And then it's also a marketing platform where you get text messages or emails and promotions based upon your needs.
[01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:52.710]  And not necessarily to one dispensary. You might have this list of products available to you in this region.
[01:38:53.710 --> 01:39:03.710]  So it's something we're trying to do is get these licenses and open up these facilities to show this system in application.
[01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:13.710]  And once it's been worked through in the cannabis environment, it's definitely something of value.
[01:39:14.710 --> 01:39:22.710]  Plus owning several licenses and being a multi-state organization is highly profitable now.
[01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:31.710]  So again, it's just a group of people who are trying to expand as much as we can and get into the emerging markets.
[01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:38.710]  At the same time, getting our IP in application and getting it working.
[01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:46.710]  We're talking with companies in Europe and Greece. We're talking with companies in London.
[01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:53.710]  We're just a small group of people that know what we're doing.
[01:39:54.710 --> 01:40:00.710]  We are really good at it. And we are taking over right now the East Coast and the Southeast.
[01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.710]  Awesome.
[01:40:03.710 --> 01:40:05.710]  So it slices, it dices.
[01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:13.710]  Wait, so what's the name of the software platform?
[01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:18.710]  So the software platform come out. It's almost like you're competing with like GreenBits, Baker.
[01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:30.710]  What was it? Baker would be like the marketing and loyalty stuff. Right. GreenBits or Meadow would be like the point of sale.
[01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:35.710]  Then you have cultivation tracking software as well.
[01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:38.710]  Like ERP, right. So efficiency management software.
[01:40:39.710 --> 01:40:46.710]  And that's tied into the security system. Right. So you know where everybody's at and what they're doing.
[01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:52.710]  And you have security tied into this single dashboard software system.
[01:40:53.710 --> 01:41:00.710]  Yeah. It's bringing all of the best ideas in IT for cannabis production all together in one platform.
[01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:03.710]  So you're implanting chips in the employees.
[01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:06.710]  You're implanting chips in the employees.
[01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:07.710]  So you get track of it.
[01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:09.710]  If we could, we would. No, no, no.
[01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:17.710]  And to show everybody how good this software is, you're getting licenses in every state as like a showroom example.
[01:41:18.710 --> 01:41:23.710]  Yes. And now you get it. And I hope other people see that as a model.
[01:41:24.710 --> 01:41:29.710]  Because there's not a lot of money to be made in cannabis.
[01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:35.710]  If it's all said and done. There's a lot more money to be made in ancillary.
[01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:40.710]  So if you can tie ancillary in with cannabis touching, you got both of them.
[01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:46.710]  And you have a direct line from ancillary business right into plant touching.
[01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:52.710]  Then that's definitely a sought after package for anybody who say would want to roll that up.
[01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:59.430]  Has anyone ever said you're trying to do too much?
[01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:02.430]  Every day.
[01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:09.430]  You're like, I want to create every software category product known to the cannabis industry.
[01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:12.430]  And then I want to open licenses in every state.
[01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:16.430]  And then go be a plant scientist and help people.
[01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:21.430]  I'm sitting underneath rolling benches teaching people how to scrub.
[01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:30.430]  And then I'll leave that and go to a meeting for investment into a business in Greece for $7 million.
[01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:32.430]  So yes, I do too much.
[01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.430]  And I've been good about stepping away from a lot of these duties.
[01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:41.430]  But in the end, it's just my nature. I've always been that way.
[01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:44.430]  And I was in the restaurant industry.
[01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:50.430]  And so James probably understands that there's a million people like me out there that just can't do one thing.
[01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:54.430]  You've got to get it all. And it all has to be done right. And I have to oversee all of it.
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:59.430]  I'm like that. I try to piece pieces of the puzzle together.
[01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:07.430]  I hope the future is for me is white coat services is getting bigger.
[01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:14.430]  And I have gone from a one man show to a multi person show very quickly.
[01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:22.430]  And what I've been doing is taking the best resources in the industry and funneling through white coat services and providing them as a service.
[01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:27.430]  Like for instance, Noel, if you wanted some of the best extracts in the world,
[01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:34.430]  if you wanted to learn how to make this, if you wanted to have a recommendation for a facility design and a layout,
[01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:41.430]  plus the equipment purchasing and protocols for code and all that stuff,
[01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:51.430]  that's available now through white coat services where we can set you up with a consultation plan, an operational management plan, whatever you want to do.
[01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:59.430]  And so white coat services is becoming a departmentalized at this point, extraction, business origination, application, whatever.
[01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:09.430]  Actually, I take that back. Application is off limits. Any applications that are done by me or my team are done for origins, which just makes more sense.
[01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:14.430]  But we used to do the application side. We don't do that much anymore.
[01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:20.760]  Nice. Hey, so do you know anything about the drones that they've been using at Fresno State?
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.760]  They're able to use and identify different issues.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:35.760]  Well, I've heard cameras. I've heard cameras that can identify because of the way the UV light bounces off the surface,
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.760]  because of the leaf temperature changes that a disease might cause,
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:45.760]  because of the respiration rates that diseases can, well, could trigger.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  I didn't know that they're putting them on drones, but that makes perfect sense.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.760]  And yeah, somewhere in California, that makes perfect sense. Yeah.
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:04.760]  I do know those cameras are still in the works, but some of them are useful.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:14.760]  When you talk about leaf temperature sensing and stuff like that, that's definitely a technology that exists and could be utilized, certainly.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.760]  Yeah, it's interesting. That's all going to change.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:26.960]  I think the future of agriculture is computers.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960]  Yeah, it's automation.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:30.960]  I don't think cameras are that different.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.960]  Yeah, to scale, I feel like, I think, I think it's a little bit different.
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:45.960]  Yeah, to scale, I feel like even with genetics, it's like they're going to pick apart cultivars and figure out how to optimize them being grown in specific environments.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.960]  And automation is going to be done on large scale, for sure.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.960]  It's already being done. It's just going to be, you know, take it to that next level.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  I mean, just the simple things like, I went out to Cornerstone in Arizona,
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:18.960]  and them using robots for sprays and putting a robot between each row and having that go up and down the rows, as opposed to a person, their efficiencies completely changed.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:27.960]  And the coverage, because if you're sending out four or five of these robots at the same time, done corresponding rows,
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:37.960]  you can go through an entire room and just fog out the entire room and have the best application that you can have without paying an employee.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:44.960]  And making sure that every droplet is always the same size and application rate is completely even all the way across.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.960]  And people will say, oh, you're taking away jobs or anything like that.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.960]  To be honest, no, those machines need to be operated by people.
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:02.960]  So again, it's just taking a new look at industry. Forget agriculture, forget cannabis, just industry in general.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:10.960]  It's all about coming to automation. And so if you want to make money in cannabis, and you have a background in technologies,
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:17.960]  put down the grower shovel and design an ERP system or something, you know.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.960]  The industry is ready and waiting for those types of technologies.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  Right.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.960]  I'm going to take a quick pee break while you guys keep going.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  Just don't bring the mic with you.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.960]  Yeah. No, I'm going to mute myself.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.960]  Wait, did he smile about not paying employees? That's great.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  Okay, let me justify that statement. Okay.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.960]  Okay. I work with groups with 250 employees.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:48:00.960]  Okay. And those employees that do certain tasks have a thing called human error.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.960]  And they have a thing called inconsistently caused by human error.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:18.960]  When you have 250 employees, and you can ensure that your entire room is getting the right spray at the right time and the full magnitude, and it's all uniform.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.960]  That's something you just can't attain with humans.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:37.960]  And so if I can utilize that system and get the best result, and then use those resources elsewhere, those human resources, right?
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:45.960]  Those hands elsewhere in places where computers can't go, then we're just opening it up further.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:54.960]  Or even better yet, take that grower who was spraying plants all day and I put a robot out there. Now I made him a manager. I paid him more.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:49:02.960]  You know, it's like, you just got to look at it that way. We don't let people go in cannabis industry. You just move them around, man.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960]  You'd be crazy to fire a good employee.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.960]  It's more like putting them in the right place and then knowing that maybe these robots can handle that greenhouse.
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:19.960]  But I need a good eye on my clone systems, which can't be automated over here.
[01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:25.930]  Nice.
[01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:29.930]  So who else did James offend in the two minutes I was gone?
[01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:33.930]  A whole bunch of people. He's getting rid of employees.
[01:49:34.930 --> 01:49:36.930]  He hates K&F.
[01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:41.930]  He's like, universal basic income for all the employees. It's okay.
[01:49:43.930 --> 01:49:49.930]  Jeff Bezos of Weed got it. No, that's not how James is. James is a good guy.
[01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:51.930]  Is anything wrong with Jeff Bezos?
[01:49:52.930 --> 01:49:55.930]  Well, obviously, look at my office. I mean, come on. I'm not Jeff Bezos.
[01:49:57.930 --> 01:50:02.930]  I was admiring the non-dead poster side of your background.
[01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:05.930]  Are you a hoarder?
[01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:07.930]  Yeah, he's on the next episode, actually.
[01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:13.930]  You want to know the truth is I live in a new place every two years and have done that since I was 17.
[01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:18.930]  So in the end, it's not hoarding. It's just I'm not using it right now.
[01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:23.930]  Yeah, someone wants to buy one of the strollers.
[01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:30.930]  Yeah, we could eBay off. We could do a live auction.
[01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:32.930]  We've done this before.
[01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:34.930]  We could get the kids to do it. I'll put the kid in the stroller.
[01:50:39.930 --> 01:50:44.930]  So Marlon is not coming on it looks like right now. He's busy.
[01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:47.930]  And so we're going to do some giveaways.
[01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:53.930]  And we're going to use some technical questions from Mr. James rushing to give away some seeds.
[01:50:55.930 --> 01:51:00.930]  So we're going to have a Gaja Pharmacy. We're going to do the Ja Fata, a 10-pack of Ja Fata.
[01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:03.930]  And James, you got a good question for me here?
[01:51:04.930 --> 01:51:05.930]  All right.
[01:51:07.930 --> 01:51:10.930]  Can someone describe what systemic acquired resistance is?
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.840]  Systemic acquired resistance.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840]  People are furiously pecking on there.
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.840]  If they can't figure that out, we'll just have to go down to what is systemic.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:26.840]  We can go there.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.840]  Any answers?
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:35.820]  They're about to come in.
[01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:43.230]  Can you see the chat?
[01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:47.230]  When food is unavailable, but the means are there to make food.
[01:51:48.230 --> 01:51:49.230]  No.
[01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:52.230]  Natural building of the immune system.
[01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:54.230]  Yes.
[01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:56.230]  Okay, let's see.
[01:51:57.230 --> 01:51:58.230]  Systemic acquired resistance.
[01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:02.230]  That's a Marion. There we go.
[01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:04.230]  All right.
[01:52:04.230 --> 01:52:16.230]  That's very general, but what it essentially is, is it's when something causes a plant to think that it is sick.
[01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:26.230]  It is being attacked by a pigeon, and it sends out its defenses to combat that pathogen.
[01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:38.230]  Now, I can put things on a plant like venerate, and that will cause the plant to think that it's being attacked.
[01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:41.230]  It will increase its cuticle layer on the leaves.
[01:52:42.230 --> 01:52:46.230]  It will cause girth growth in the stems and stalks.
[01:52:47.230 --> 01:52:54.230]  It will enable stomata opening and closing to be faster in response to respiration.
[01:52:55.230 --> 01:53:02.230]  And so, it's essentially, it's like getting immune shot in the arm for the measles.
[01:53:03.230 --> 01:53:10.230]  Your body thinks you have the measles, you bring up that immunity or those antibodies for that very similar process.
[01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:12.230]  Good job.
[01:53:13.230 --> 01:53:14.230]  Good question.
[01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:17.230]  That's better than most of the questions we ask people.
[01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.230]  Yeah, you're going to email Jamesloudgenetics at gmail.com for your seed pack.
[01:53:23.230 --> 01:53:26.230]  And we need question number two.
[01:53:27.230 --> 01:53:29.230]  We're going to give away loud jelly beans.
[01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:31.230]  One pack of loud jelly beans.
[01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:33.230]  Can I win those?
[01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:35.230]  I'll send you some anyway, yeah.
[01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:40.230]  That's a Candyland times OG, or Candyland times Gelato 41.
[01:53:41.230 --> 01:53:42.230]  Let's see.
[01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:43.230]  Let's see.
[01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:48.230]  Guess they have one of my, let's see, let's do a...
[01:53:53.630 --> 01:53:56.630]  Which one goes inside of the plant?
[01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:59.630]  Endomycorrhizae or ectomycorrhizae?
[01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:01.630]  Go.
[01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:03.630]  And why?
[01:54:04.630 --> 01:54:05.630]  Let's do either.
[01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:19.270]  We got, oh, sorry.
[01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.270]  I keep...
[01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:25.270]  Endomycorrhizae, there's no...
[01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:27.270]  Yeah, where was the first one though?
[01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:29.270]  Because that's how it's absorbed.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.720]  Yeah, so this would just be a partial answer.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.720]  The first person to say endo.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.720]  I think that's fair.
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.720]  Quick to the draw.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:45.720]  And then the explanation part.
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:47.720]  Where does that start?
[01:54:51.010 --> 01:54:54.010]  God, trying to have, I'm like squinting trying to see all that.
[01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:57.010]  Where the lipid layer engulfs an external thing.
[01:55:00.010 --> 01:55:01.010]  Yeah, that's nailed it.
[01:55:05.010 --> 01:55:06.010]  To transfer shit.
[01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:08.010]  That's another answer.
[01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:11.010]  Let's see.
[01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:13.010]  Is that accurate?
[01:55:14.010 --> 01:55:15.010]  All right, we can do this.
[01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:17.010]  We can change the question.
[01:55:18.010 --> 01:55:19.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:21.010 --> 01:55:24.010]  All right, in an endomycorrhizae situation,
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:30.010]  what is the name of the organelle that pierces the plant?
[01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:33.010]  Nice.
[01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:36.010]  What is the name of the organelle that, on a fungi,
[01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.010]  So one word answer.
[01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:46.000]  They're still answering endo.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  You might have to look that up.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.400]  Stipule is the first answer.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.400]  I know, sorry.
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.400]  Now, before, Jesus, these things blow by me.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:55:59.400]  Proviscus.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.400]  Proviscus is the part that goes into the plant on a insect on his nose.
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:05.400]  Tendril?
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.400]  Tendril, no.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400]  Hyphae?
[01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:12.400]  Hyphae is what goes into the plant.
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.400]  The penis.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  I would go with that one.
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:20.400]  Wait, is that actually right?
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.400]  No.
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:27.400]  I was like, I didn't put that one up because it's obviously not right.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.400]  And then you're like, that's the answer.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.400]  All right, I'll give you a hint.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]  It starts with an H.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:35.400]  And it's not hyphae.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.400]  No.
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400]  It's a vocabulary session.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400]  Yeah, seriously.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.400]  Someone asked for the question again.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.400]  What is the name of the organelle that pierces into a plant?
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:52.400]  On a fungi.
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:54.400]  On a fungi.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:56.400]  What is the organelle that pierces into a plant?
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:05.400]  Like in an endo mycorrhizae, as it goes into the plant and sets up shop on the inside of the actual structure of the root.
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.400]  It uses a special organelle.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.400]  Yes, the Haustoria.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:13.400]  Very good.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.400]  So now let me just see if this was answered earlier.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:19.400]  But that might be.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.400]  Yeah, I don't see anyone before.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:22.400]  All right.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.400]  So we have a winner.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.400]  And you got here.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.400]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:30.400]  Harry Humperdinck was not the right answer.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:36.400]  Yeah.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.400]  Email me.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:38.400]  JamesLoudGenetics at Gmail.com.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:40.400]  We'll get the seed packs out.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:47.400]  And to our French viewers, your seed pack from the Christmas show is somewhere over the Atlantic.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.400]  Right now, I DM you on Instagram to.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.400]  Yeah.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.400]  They got pigeons.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.400]  And by the way, for everyone who did not win any of this stuff, you can always pick them up right there.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:07.990]  All right. Wait, do we have a new question or are we still waiting for a question?
[01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.990]  One more question.
[01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.990]  Oh, we need a question.
[01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.990]  Yeah.
[01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:18.480]  Of the macro.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.480]  Of the macro nutrients.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.480]  N, P, K.
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.480]  Which one of them regulates stomata opening and closing?
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:32.480]  It's it. You got a 30 percent chance.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.480]  Thirty three.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:42.230]  We had a K.
[01:58:43.230 --> 01:58:44.230]  Yeah. K is the answer.
[01:58:45.230 --> 01:58:46.230]  Oh, my God.
[01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:49.230]  He's you can. That's one one shipment.
[01:58:51.230 --> 01:58:53.230]  He's cleaning. He's cleaning up.
[01:58:55.230 --> 01:58:56.230]  Yeah. Very good job.
[01:58:56.230 --> 01:59:02.230]  The K molecule is what regulates the opening and closing of the stomata on those lips.
[01:59:03.230 --> 01:59:04.230]  And.
[01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:08.230]  Yeah, that's it. Where does the K come from?
[01:59:09.230 --> 01:59:10.230]  He's pretty psyched.
[01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:16.230]  The K has to come from your nutrients.
[01:59:16.230 --> 01:59:21.230]  So if you don't have enough K in your environment, your stomata don't open and close correctly.
[01:59:21.230 --> 01:59:22.230]  You don't respirate correctly.
[01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:27.230]  And then you just do wicked nutrient absorption because the stomata are either all the way closed or all the way open.
[01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:31.230]  And in the whole thing gets messed up.
[01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:33.230]  So that's why K is so important.
[01:59:33.230 --> 01:59:40.230]  OK, so we have to have a fourth question because someone felt that these were discriminatory against people who haven't gone to college.
[01:59:40.230 --> 01:59:47.230]  And so we need a less PhD oriented question for the.
[01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:49.230]  All right. Yeah, I can understand that.
[01:59:49.230 --> 01:59:50.230]  I can understand that.
[01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:51.230]  How about a Grateful Dead question?
[01:59:52.230 --> 01:59:53.230]  Ah, all right.
[01:59:55.230 --> 01:59:58.230]  What month? You didn't have to you didn't have to go to college to like the dead.
[01:59:58.230 --> 01:59:59.230]  Yeah. OK.
[02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:05.230]  In what month did the Grateful Dead play the pyramids in Egypt?
[02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:10.230]  All right. Looking at the chat.
[02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:14.690]  We have a December.
[02:00:14.690 --> 02:00:15.690]  Casey Jones is the answer.
[02:00:16.690 --> 02:00:17.690]  No, that's not the end.
[02:00:17.690 --> 02:00:18.690]  We have December.
[02:00:19.690 --> 02:00:21.690]  Oh, wait, hold on. Jesus.
[02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:27.410]  So I think there's a December and August.
[02:00:28.410 --> 02:00:30.410]  So December, August.
[02:00:31.410 --> 02:00:33.410]  I mean, you got a one in 12 chance, right?
[02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:36.410]  March, June.
[02:00:38.410 --> 02:00:40.410]  May. I haven't heard it yet.
[02:00:41.410 --> 02:00:43.410]  December again. June, July.
[02:00:43.410 --> 02:00:45.410]  Jesus. Jesus. A lot of answers.
[02:00:46.410 --> 02:00:48.410]  All right. June, September, January.
[02:00:54.590 --> 02:00:55.590]  You just tell me when I get it.
[02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:57.590]  September.
[02:00:57.590 --> 02:00:58.590]  What? September.
[02:00:59.590 --> 02:01:00.590]  I think we had a September.
[02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:02.590]  We may have. Hold on.
[02:01:02.590 --> 02:01:04.590]  I see Richard Lamb said September.
[02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:05.590]  Let's see.
[02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:06.590]  Marion.
[02:01:07.590 --> 02:01:08.590]  I see.
[02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:10.590]  September 78.
[02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:11.590]  Even more specifically.
[02:01:12.590 --> 02:01:13.590]  Very good.
[02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:14.590]  What day? What day?
[02:01:14.590 --> 02:01:15.590]  There's two shows. What was the date?
[02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:17.590]  Yeah.
[02:01:17.590 --> 02:01:19.590]  So I think Philip was the first.
[02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:21.590]  Yeah.
[02:01:21.590 --> 02:01:24.560]  I don't see.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:25.560]  All right.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.560]  I'm pretty sure I got the pyramid.
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.030]  Yeah, I actually have the poster on my wall.
[02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:34.030]  You're going to be sending an email.
[02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:38.030]  To this guy right there.
[02:01:40.030 --> 02:01:41.030]  All right.
[02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:42.030]  So I think we have a December.
[02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:44.030]  I think we have a December.
[02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:46.030]  I think we have a December.
[02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:48.030]  All right.
[02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:49.030]  I feel like everybody.
[02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:55.030]  Unless people who didn't listen to the Grateful Dead.
[02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:56.030]  You could just Google that.
[02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:59.030]  You gotta be quick to draw that.
[02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:01.030]  You could easily Google that.
[02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:03.030]  Us Grateful Dead head weirdos.
[02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:05.030]  We know that show.
[02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:09.030]  Yeah.
[02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:11.030]  There's a lot of Grateful Dead, you know, trivia out there.
[02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:13.030]  Millions of questions.
[02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:17.030]  Well, thank you for coming on the show, man.
[02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:19.030]  It's been great.
[02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:20.030]  I think everybody learned a lot.
[02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:22.030]  We got some haters out there.
[02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:24.030]  You can send the hate mail to my DM.
[02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:30.030]  So anybody who is offended by today's show.
[02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:32.030]  That's the editor.
[02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:34.030]  You can write a letter to the editor.
[02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:36.030]  Yeah, it goes to him.
[02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:39.030]  I'm not responsible for the content of this TV show.
[02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:43.030]  And if you want to respond.
[02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:44.030]  You can send an email there as well.
[02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:46.030]  And we'll bring you on to point counterpoint.
[02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:49.030]  Sure.
[02:02:50.030 --> 02:02:51.030]  All right.
[02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.030]  Well, with that, I'm going to go watch some football.
[02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:55.030]  Nice.
[02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:57.030]  Maybe go outside.
[02:02:58.030 --> 02:03:00.030]  I got my Instagram spread out like two weeks ago.
[02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:02.030]  So I started.
[02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:05.030]  What was it the right Instagram that we had?
[02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:10.030]  I looked at white code services LLC is what it is now.
[02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:11.030]  I'm still trying to get the other one back.
[02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:13.030]  You'll get it back.
[02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:15.030]  You just have to be patient.
[02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:17.030]  Yeah.
[02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:18.030]  Well, wait.
[02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:20.030]  But if you go to.
[02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:22.030]  Yeah.
[02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:23.030]  White Coat Services LLC.
[02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:25.030]  But you go to the Web site.
[02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:30.030]  Who is there's another guy mentioned.
[02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:33.030]  Abe Froman.
[02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:35.030]  Yeah.
[02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:36.030]  Who's Abe?
[02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:38.030]  The sausage king of Chicago.
[02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:39.030]  Oh, got it.
[02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:40.030]  Got it.
[02:03:40.030 --> 02:03:41.030]  Got it.
[02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:42.030]  All right.
[02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:46.030]  I was like, because when we tag, you know, I'm like quickly making sure it's like the
[02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:47.030]  right Instagram.
[02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:48.030]  OK, so that is you.
[02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:50.030]  Yeah.
[02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:51.030]  All right.
[02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:58.030]  I can even put that if everybody can wait one more second at.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  Is that right?
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  There you go.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  So, yeah, you can redirect the hate mail to that guy.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:13.360]  Just slide into his DMs and let him know exactly what you think about his opinions and where
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  he can put them.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  So a lot of upset Koreans right now.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  Make it funny.
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:28.360]  Angry old Hawaiian women watching right now.
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.360]  Here's the thing.
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:30.360]  Here's the thing.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  If you do it in your backyard and you're making a pile, you're sprinkling it out and it makes
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  you feel better.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:45.360]  Dude, do it like don't don't stop yourself from from pleasure like this.
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:51.360]  Make yourself happy if you want to sprinkle, you know, this or that on your plants that
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  you made your backyard with.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:54.360]  You go ahead.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:58.360]  If it makes you whole as a person, then I'm advocating that.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.360]  Yeah.
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.360]  Great way to end the show.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.360]  Thank you, guys.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:08.360]  All right.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:09.360]  Should I kill it?
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.360]  Yeah.
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.360]  All right.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.360]  We'll see you.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.360]  Oh, and just quickly.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  Got it.
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  Tuesday, we have Tad Hussey and his business partner.
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:28.360]  Wednesday, I think Matthew Gates wants to do a can or not can have an IPM segment.
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.360]  And that's as far as I've gotten.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:34.360]  So anyway, see you, everyone.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.360]  Yep.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  Have a good week.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:37.360]  Thank you.
