[00:01.980 --> 00:08.100]  And we are live. Welcome everyone. Sorry we were waiting for one more
[00:08.100 --> 00:14.780]  participant who will hopefully be jumping on shortly, but I guess this
[00:14.780 --> 00:23.180]  conversation was inspired by some Instagram post, right? Yeah, it's a
[00:23.180 --> 00:31.700]  long-running conversation, definitely, and observation of how we communicate
[00:31.980 --> 00:40.900]  when we're discussing the things we do. Gosh, it's something I've been,
[00:40.900 --> 00:46.980]  like my emblem for my seat packs is, working on since 85, and I lost context
[00:46.980 --> 00:53.380]  to which land races were in a hybrid about 93. The polyhybridization that was
[00:53.380 --> 00:58.220]  coming through in commercial smoke was getting complex, and I could say this had
[00:58.220 --> 01:02.660]  Nigerian, this had Afghan, and this had some Mexican, but then once it got past a
[01:02.660 --> 01:07.460]  triple polyhybrid and we started getting out with these fancy elite strains, I
[01:07.460 --> 01:15.020]  didn't know what the heck was in it. It was great, but yeah, so the discussion
[01:15.020 --> 01:21.140]  of the land race is, what does that word mean? And somebody says it. The people
[01:21.140 --> 01:27.100]  want to bring up fisticuffs over an acute definition, but if we open up the
[01:27.100 --> 01:32.940]  dictionary, there is no definition in the dictionary of the word land race. So
[01:32.940 --> 01:39.940]  people appoint all sorts of different scientists as this, or, and they
[01:39.940 --> 01:44.460]  literally, people want to get fisticuffs online over, you know, as far as you can,
[01:44.460 --> 01:49.780]  I'm right stuff, and it's like, well, the fact of the matter is, words get used in
[01:49.780 --> 02:01.780]  common context, and as well as scientific context, as well as, so
[02:01.780 --> 02:05.260]  that's the broad spectrum there, and then when somebody's gonna insist on
[02:05.260 --> 02:11.300]  my jargon or my word usage, then it complicates things, because someone over
[02:11.300 --> 02:15.900]  here has heard something and just need to clarify really what everybody means
[02:15.940 --> 02:20.860]  when they say it, and the fact of the matter is, that does range from
[02:20.860 --> 02:26.780]  completely wild, and if it exists, there's debate on to whether wild
[02:26.780 --> 02:35.860]  cannabis, natural stands of wild cannabis actually exist or not feral, right? And so
[02:35.860 --> 02:44.260]  hence the technical taxonomic term sativa, which means cultivated, right?
[02:44.700 --> 02:48.620]  People get in debate over whether there's three specifications that have
[02:48.620 --> 02:53.340]  been determined through genetic information now, Ruderalis, Sativa, and
[02:53.340 --> 03:00.100]  Africanica, okay? And so all this stuff can get confusing, and how were these all
[03:00.100 --> 03:08.940]  escaped from cultivation? Are they pre-Diluvian, pre, I'm sorry, Greater Dryas
[03:08.940 --> 03:13.900]  period, right? Did this stuff distribute before then on the winds, with the birds,
[03:14.020 --> 03:21.460]  or is it all in this historical period? Okay, these are huge questions that we
[03:21.460 --> 03:27.540]  can ask in defining whether even a wild stand of cannabis that's been there for
[03:27.540 --> 03:36.900]  time and more memorial is actually feral or native, right? And this is, this is a
[03:36.900 --> 03:46.420]  huge, like, wow, that goes back, when did cannabis separate from hops? And I
[03:46.420 --> 03:50.020]  didn't take a second to look it up, was it 20 million years ago? I don't remember
[03:50.020 --> 03:58.020]  exactly, but so specification and diversification, and was it wild all the
[03:58.020 --> 04:06.180]  time? Man, once it got to, you know, we know in the Chinese tomb, I believe 6,000
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.420]  years, and I'm just going off the top of my head, I've not researched this stuff
[04:08.420 --> 04:12.700]  recently, and these are articles we can all verify, but they found the pale-skinned,
[04:12.700 --> 04:17.460]  blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy that was buried with cannabis plants, and they're
[04:17.460 --> 04:23.780]  like, yeah, that stuff was potent, right? So we've had this genetics around for a
[04:23.780 --> 04:27.780]  long time, and people have been cultivating it a long time, and how long
[04:27.780 --> 04:33.300]  is it, once it's gone feral, does it become naturalized? At what point is it a
[04:33.380 --> 04:40.820]  native plant, or a new endemic versus an island endemic? These are terms that
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.620]  people use. I try to keep in the middle ground here, so everyone understands
[04:44.620 --> 04:51.420]  between the scientist and the end consumer of a seed, for instance, because
[04:51.420 --> 04:56.220]  it's really hard to buy commercially produced land races at any level, because
[04:56.220 --> 04:58.900]  most of them take a long time, they're difficult to grow, and there's all sorts
[04:59.060 --> 05:03.500]  of intricacies to growing them. Is it the same thing once you move it outside of
[05:03.500 --> 05:07.780]  its place of origin? And those are all part of the definitions that are
[05:07.780 --> 05:17.540]  discussed, is how true it stays, does it stay true to seed? How much diversity is in
[05:17.540 --> 05:23.380]  there in it? And once it's left its place of origin, when is it no longer a land
[05:23.380 --> 05:28.140]  race, and it's become something else, because somebody's inbred it just by the
[05:28.220 --> 05:32.700]  nature of bottlenecking once you remove from that population that's so diverse
[05:32.700 --> 05:37.940]  with all the males and females blowing in the wind, whether it's feral or native,
[05:37.940 --> 05:42.900]  or if it's a commercial population that's produced near one of these feral
[05:42.900 --> 05:46.900]  or wild populations. All of this changes... Go ahead.
[05:46.900 --> 05:48.500]  No, no, keep going.
[05:48.500 --> 05:53.300]  So all of this has changed exactly what it is in your hand when you have what we
[05:53.340 --> 06:02.340]  might call a land race. So that word and its usage is broad spectrum. It covers a
[06:02.340 --> 06:06.660]  lot of stuff. And so what I'd like to do is... I got sick and tired of saying that
[06:06.660 --> 06:11.900]  my understanding of what a land race is, and part of it might have been fantasy
[06:11.900 --> 06:16.460]  from just ignorance, and that's what we're trying to alleviate here.
[06:16.460 --> 06:23.020]  But growing up and then going through college and studying plant breeding from
[06:23.020 --> 06:28.460]  the perspective of a forester, the term land race was referred to as the wild
[06:28.460 --> 06:40.260]  stock. And so to me, in my mind, land race is like... Was taking a wolf and
[06:40.260 --> 06:48.100]  back-crossing it in, staking out your prized breed of race dog in Alaska so it
[06:48.100 --> 06:53.420]  can get bred to by the alpha male, the wolf pack. And so the wolf pack being
[06:53.420 --> 07:02.100]  the land race was my understanding of what the land race was. Now, of
[07:02.100 --> 07:04.620]  course, other people have a very different understanding of what land
[07:04.620 --> 07:11.540]  race is, and there's some very firm, astute beliefs, and people are firm on
[07:11.540 --> 07:15.420]  this, and that's their right, that land race only means stuff that's been cultivated
[07:15.420 --> 07:24.060]  by the handmaid. So it would be actually the pack of race dogs that's getting
[07:24.060 --> 07:32.540]  cultivated, and not the wolf. Okay? And so if we think about that, that's two
[07:32.540 --> 07:37.820]  major schools of thought right there, or in the definition of what constitutes a
[07:37.820 --> 07:44.500]  land race. So would the person who calls the race dog land race call the
[07:44.580 --> 07:49.780]  wolf wild and feral, or... And they would say the word land race does not apply.
[07:49.780 --> 07:53.980]  Okay, so for them, wild, then land race.
[07:53.980 --> 07:59.020]  And I'm sorry I even used the word race dog. Okay, sled dog would be better.
[07:59.020 --> 08:05.300]  Please, sorry, scratch race dog, sled dog. Okay? So we don't confuse land race to
[08:05.300 --> 08:09.380]  race dog, because that's too very... If you look at the... On my Instagram today, I
[08:09.380 --> 08:13.980]  posted... Because there is no definition of land race in any paper dictionary that
[08:13.980 --> 08:18.180]  I have, and I collect dictionaries that don't have any newer ones, but they go
[08:18.180 --> 08:26.980]  back into the 50s. There's no land race is a common usage word in the
[08:26.980 --> 08:31.860]  English language. And so how do we agree on this stuff? And I just have all
[08:31.860 --> 08:36.060]  these papers we can research, and say this or that, and I presented one, and the
[08:36.060 --> 08:40.020]  way I read it from my perspective, it's like it says, yeah, it's barely
[08:40.180 --> 08:47.060]  work by man, or it's not. It's wild. Okay? And that's how I read that paper. But
[08:47.060 --> 08:50.060]  someone else who has a different perspective reads it and says, it says
[08:50.060 --> 08:54.260]  clearly that it's work by man. Okay? So I'm not saying you have to use it my way.
[08:54.260 --> 08:59.380]  I'm saying this when I'm talking, these are the words I use, and this is why I
[08:59.380 --> 09:04.700]  use them. And the discussion definitely developed on my Instagram page.
[09:05.220 --> 09:11.620]  But the part of it had to do with, Zarian has developed this wonderful
[09:11.620 --> 09:23.060]  concept of looking at the plant where it developed on the earth. And so again, for
[09:23.060 --> 09:25.780]  my forestry perspective, I'm studying all the plants and identifying where I
[09:25.780 --> 09:32.260]  might find one on the landscape, so I can know what a plant community is. And like
[09:32.300 --> 09:36.740]  dealing with what kind of trees I should be planting on the landscape, maybe. You
[09:36.740 --> 09:40.740]  can identify it by the brush and the plants that grow there, because of
[09:40.740 --> 09:49.620]  elevation, and you know, latitude, and your relativity to bodies of water, like
[09:49.620 --> 09:54.420]  the ocean, or various other things like that. If you got horticraft, any of that.
[09:54.420 --> 10:01.060]  How the landscape affects weather, right? And that has to do with where you are
[10:01.140 --> 10:10.860]  north and south, and elevation. Okay? And so I know the further north I go, I can
[10:10.860 --> 10:15.580]  find lichens at lower elevations. But the further south I go towards the equator
[10:15.580 --> 10:19.980]  in the northern hemisphere, I have to go to a higher elevation to find a lichen,
[10:19.980 --> 10:26.300]  or a pine tree, because they have specific requirements they've adapted to.
[10:26.300 --> 10:31.620]  But if you go north, those can be found at lower elevations. And that has to do
[10:31.620 --> 10:40.900]  with proximity to the Sun, right? And how much spectrum of light you get when the
[10:40.900 --> 10:44.740]  Sun's affecting you, right? And so we all talk about our spectrum in our
[10:44.740 --> 10:48.460]  groves, whether it's in a greenhouse and we're adapting with supplemental light,
[10:48.620 --> 10:56.700]  or if it's in a closed environment, and we want to be specifically maximizing our
[10:56.700 --> 11:00.500]  returns for the energy inputs and lowering our footprint, right? And
[11:00.500 --> 11:05.180]  understanding the spectrum that the plant that we're working with originated
[11:05.180 --> 11:11.020]  in to maximize its returns is a really pretty cool tool. That's just one way I
[11:11.020 --> 11:17.300]  interpret what I see here. When I look at his graphic that he's come up with in
[11:17.740 --> 11:19.340]  Land Race Description.
[11:19.660 --> 11:25.140]  So actually, just quickly, I found the better quality version of the graphics.
[11:25.580 --> 11:31.260]  But do you want to start by just setting the table with when you personally, with
[11:31.260 --> 11:34.540]  an understanding that other people mean different things, but when you personally
[11:34.540 --> 11:38.100]  say a word, what it means to you? So I'll walk through the slides, and you can just
[11:38.100 --> 11:39.180]  talk about each one.
[11:39.620 --> 11:43.660]  Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. And this is, you know, I've been typing out my scribble
[11:43.660 --> 11:48.740]  scrabble, chicken scratch. I can't type, I can't write and the stuff. It's hard, you
[11:48.740 --> 11:52.780]  know, how many people follow. This is the words I've been using as long as I've
[11:52.780 --> 11:59.340]  been teaching through the internet and were developed through my diverse,
[11:59.700 --> 12:07.260]  personal, I don't just bring cannabis medicine plants. I've bred maize from,
[12:07.940 --> 12:15.020]  shall we say land race corn varieties to have a multicolored blue corn. And that I've
[12:15.020 --> 12:16.740]  worked on this for 20 years.
[12:17.660 --> 12:19.980]  And I have it growing outside right now.
[12:20.020 --> 12:25.100]  Yeah, and that can express its ancient corn origins. This is socially it can come out
[12:25.100 --> 12:31.580]  with with really bizarre expressions of its original genetic that you will never find in
[12:31.580 --> 12:34.980]  a polyhybrid. Okay, and this is where here's a huge separation.
[12:35.980 --> 12:39.820]  Once it's gotten past a certain amount of bottlenecking, and we'll get through these in
[12:39.820 --> 12:44.780]  these slides, it's no longer a land race, it becomes inbred, and it becomes a cultivar and
[12:44.780 --> 12:50.020]  it becomes we have a just like looking at soil horizons, it's like there's there's O
[12:50.020 --> 12:58.060]  horizon, there's the O A horizon, there's the A horizon. And so there's that section where
[12:58.300 --> 13:05.180]  it entered phases. Right? And so at what point does it no longer be a land race and
[13:05.180 --> 13:09.980]  cultivars? So yeah, go ahead, go ahead, bring those up. And we'll go through those. In my
[13:09.980 --> 13:16.700]  perspective, and again, I do, I collect wild grasses. To me, a true land race has been a
[13:16.700 --> 13:23.860]  wild plant that that wolf out in the woods, right? Okay, and zero hand of man steering the
[13:23.860 --> 13:28.700]  populations, these are the rarest of land race, if they exist in the cannabis population, we
[13:28.700 --> 13:33.980]  can debate that. My understanding is there are maybe 100 different wild populations in
[13:34.020 --> 13:39.060]  China alone, talking to somebody who lived there a couple years ago, who's collected some
[13:39.060 --> 13:44.900]  of them crazy wild treks in the nomads land, and literally canyoneering and mountaineering
[13:44.900 --> 13:55.780]  in the wild remote places. And so we're intermixing the entire pop. So we're talking about
[13:55.820 --> 13:59.980]  this is the most genetically diverse populations when they're when they're wild, because
[13:59.980 --> 14:04.500]  they have all the males and females, nothing's been removed. And they're intermixing through
[14:04.500 --> 14:10.780]  the wind at all times, and just being naturally selected to that environment. They become
[14:10.780 --> 14:17.380]  endemic. And however much time it might take, that's a great, a great debate, because that
[14:17.380 --> 14:24.980]  covers the next one, which is the feral wild populations, right? And I claim to have a true
[14:24.980 --> 14:31.060]  North American wild land race. And this is the word usage on music, where it's a, actually, so
[14:31.060 --> 14:38.020]  before general animals, we had, we had a feral, we had native wild separation in true land
[14:38.700 --> 14:46.020]  and down in the red, there's bottom. Okay, I missed what was going on there. And so the feral
[14:46.020 --> 14:51.820]  naturalized adapted. And so in the discussion, we can say that that could be happening through
[14:51.820 --> 14:57.660]  as man moved around as man traded, and or through animal transfer, and it gets to a new
[14:57.660 --> 15:04.460]  location and adapts. And so there's there's a great, a great diversity in how long it takes any
[15:04.460 --> 15:08.660]  given plant to adapt, like with garlic, which is pretty much clone only, unless you know the
[15:08.660 --> 15:17.380]  secrets of actually sexually reproducing garlic, which can be done. There, that's a clone, a clone,
[15:17.380 --> 15:26.460]  a clone, and self clones, right? And it totally adapts through man selecting it, right? Over, and
[15:26.460 --> 15:30.860]  it usually takes about three years when you put it into a new environment, you plant the best of
[15:30.860 --> 15:36.820]  the cloves, you get off a bulb, boom, boom, boom, and you select the best cloves that come out of
[15:36.820 --> 15:44.820]  your new soil and microbial and air environment, right? And rain and water coming out of whatever
[15:44.820 --> 15:48.660]  tap you're feeding it, right? All those things are affecting how that garlic's going to grow,
[15:48.660 --> 15:57.860]  or the field and the difference from my, my home here, and 17 miles away, and the sand and the,
[15:58.060 --> 16:04.700]  and the clay and the irrigation water versus the tap water here, right? So it takes three years for
[16:04.700 --> 16:09.660]  that kind of, even in that sort of distance in space, in the landscape and temperatures and
[16:09.660 --> 16:14.700]  things, three years for it to adapt with garlic as a clone, and you're choosing each one, right?
[16:14.700 --> 16:26.860]  Choosing that clone that's, that's expressing epigenetically. Okay, so, so we have that feral
[16:26.860 --> 16:35.340]  adaptation, whether a sailor dropped some seed, whether it was a farmer growing their rope, or
[16:35.340 --> 16:41.980]  growing a medicine plant, or whatever it was that it was being cultivated for and transferred around
[16:42.060 --> 16:49.420]  the world by the hand of man, you have, or whether it was a bird or whatever, it's gone feral and
[16:49.420 --> 16:57.500]  adapted, and that's what my New Mexico land or land grant is, right? And, and so it's, it's
[16:57.500 --> 17:04.860]  escaped captivity at some point in time between the late 1500s and three generations ago of human
[17:05.500 --> 17:14.220]  occupation. And, you know, grandpa says it's old, so, and my history understanding was that the
[17:14.220 --> 17:19.500]  priests brought what they needed with them, and they were growing hemp back in the day when they
[17:19.500 --> 17:25.100]  were conquistadoran, because they needed their brown robes and their ropes. So, you know, how long?
[17:25.100 --> 17:32.460]  That's, that's hundreds of years, okay, through epigenetic adaptation. Down in South America,
[17:32.460 --> 17:36.460]  in Central America, and Mexico, we have other things that we classify as land race that have
[17:36.460 --> 17:43.500]  been, they were brought over either and or by slaves, sailors, and what for not for different
[17:43.500 --> 17:48.940]  purposes, whether it's medicine for physical medicine or medicine to spiritual medicine.
[17:51.420 --> 17:58.140]  For instance, my, my New Mexico, I'm sorry, my Nigerian Yoruba Bantu is a cultivar that
[17:58.380 --> 18:04.540]  is a regional expression there. And that gets into our different, the next slide, I guess,
[18:04.540 --> 18:08.060]  it talks about those ones have been all been steered by the hand of man, and some of them
[18:08.060 --> 18:16.460]  have escaped and have wild populations near where man grows them. Okay, and so the general usage
[18:16.460 --> 18:21.500]  that most people talk about land race may or may not include that first category of wild that I
[18:21.500 --> 18:27.660]  call true land race. But most people talk about land race, they're thinking about these, these
[18:27.660 --> 18:34.460]  fields that or small plots, small gardens that people utilize, that involves the hand of man,
[18:35.180 --> 18:41.180]  we're selecting no modern technology, no laboratories being involved in this, right?
[18:42.940 --> 18:48.620]  Way I read the definitions used over time, it is the most minimal usage of the hand of man if there
[18:48.700 --> 18:54.380]  is any involved in it. So for instance, over time, and they talk about something that's been
[18:54.380 --> 19:03.980]  grown in place for time immoral. So that that would be like a grain, for instance, right,
[19:03.980 --> 19:08.060]  these old grains that people have grown in different places, whether it's a rice or a wheat
[19:08.060 --> 19:13.660]  or barley or corn here in America, whatever. You know, it was selected from a wild plant.
[19:14.300 --> 19:19.020]  And it was grown in a region and it was selected using just like man, that one looks a little
[19:19.020 --> 19:22.780]  better, that one produced a little better that one if I plant it, and eventually it's like this
[19:22.780 --> 19:29.420]  doesn't necessarily going to grow if I don't plant it. Right, I got to shuck it. A couple of micro,
[19:29.420 --> 19:33.980]  but eventually it's going to fade out over time, it's going to be this weak little wild stand
[19:33.980 --> 19:37.580]  barrel and they don't produce a whole lot if they don't get the proper tilling of the soil and
[19:37.580 --> 19:46.220]  things like that. So, you know, grains can go back to feral too. But so associated with a land
[19:46.220 --> 19:58.140]  space, a geographical area, a nation that embodies the people and the land. Okay, so that's the
[19:58.140 --> 20:06.460]  weather that's going to do with the geological forces that create the weather and the soil.
[20:07.180 --> 20:12.300]  Right, and where you are in that northern latitude and that elevation zone,
[20:13.420 --> 20:20.940]  all that's going to affect both what the people who are using it and or
[20:21.980 --> 20:27.260]  steering it are doing with it. So we're talking about a grain again, that was selected a long
[20:27.260 --> 20:32.940]  time ago from being a wild plant and it was grown right in the same proximity as those wild plants
[20:32.940 --> 20:38.940]  over long generations and continued to be interacting with. And eventually it was less
[20:38.940 --> 20:45.100]  interaction with the wild and more just like just an open population of males and females
[20:45.100 --> 20:53.420]  interacting, but they didn't select into a bottleneck. And you know, then we get into like
[20:54.380 --> 20:59.980]  people still using the general terminology for the land race of these cultivars. They get,
[21:00.860 --> 21:08.140]  once it's been collected by a botanist or a seed company or the name of the company that
[21:08.140 --> 21:15.420]  shall not be mentioned, you know, comes in and says this is now my invention because I found
[21:15.420 --> 21:22.060]  this one particular genetic strain. But it, you know, it was grown by this village in India,
[21:22.060 --> 21:26.940]  particular Basmati rice for time immemorial, right?
[21:29.660 --> 21:34.860]  And so I've got these cultivars and at what point was my cultivar no longer,
[21:35.740 --> 21:39.820]  can I call it no longer land race, right? I've been growing Pakistani Chitra Kush.
[21:42.940 --> 21:49.420]  That's one that's derived from a wild population somewhere near the Hindu Kush region of
[21:49.420 --> 21:56.620]  Afghanistan. Downhill, it's south of there and then the foothill regions from the wild
[21:56.620 --> 22:03.420]  populations as I understand it originated. A lot of people say most of the wild populations
[22:03.420 --> 22:09.580]  from Afghanistan were wiped out during the Russian occupation and those genetics only
[22:09.580 --> 22:17.740]  exist in seed collections, those cultivars that evolved in it, right? One of the things I wanted
[22:17.740 --> 22:26.860]  to point out with having Azaria around is that they are actually in India, there's a place that
[22:26.860 --> 22:32.380]  white people just really aren't really, we're not allowed to go. It's a national preserve of
[22:33.180 --> 22:41.020]  genetic diversity of all plants and animals and species and whatnot. And that is like, there's
[22:41.980 --> 22:49.740]  wild original cannabis growing there from time immemorial, right? And that is kind of, so when
[22:49.740 --> 22:56.380]  you get into some of the populations that people have cultivated for churros in areas nearby,
[22:56.380 --> 23:01.260]  how far does that pollen go? Is it interacting and things like that are all vast questions. And
[23:02.060 --> 23:04.700]  some of the stuff I was going to bring up is how do we prevent
[23:04.940 --> 23:13.100]  man's pollution as we move things around and polyhybrids and distribute them? And that's
[23:13.100 --> 23:18.940]  something my mentor lamented with in his own reality that he took seeds when he traveled
[23:18.940 --> 23:22.940]  the hippie trail and gathered from the sweet spots around the world where people were growing these
[23:23.580 --> 23:30.220]  garden varieties, regional heirlooms in proximity to the wild populations. And he was able to
[23:30.220 --> 23:35.420]  examine the wild population and go out and compare it with what they had in the garden and
[23:35.420 --> 23:42.300]  say, well, I want, where am I getting my seed from? Right? And, but he would leave some polyhybrids
[23:42.300 --> 23:47.660]  with them. Some people say in a smaller population, you're going to pollute it. And
[23:47.660 --> 23:53.100]  then the larger population is going to get wiped out. But I have a hard time accepting that a small
[23:53.100 --> 23:58.060]  population gets wiped out and a bigger one just absorbs it, that that's not in there somewhere,
[23:58.060 --> 24:06.060]  the recessive situation. And so, I'm kind of of the understanding and belief that
[24:07.340 --> 24:13.180]  besides these really remote pockets of wild genetics that aren't affected by anyone's
[24:13.980 --> 24:17.740]  pollen blowing around that's been selected by man, there isn't a whole lot of wild stuff out
[24:17.740 --> 24:29.340]  there left. And that true original and adulterated even for those, I think a lot of the
[24:29.340 --> 24:32.380]  varieties has just been corrupted personally. And that's one of the things I'd like to talk to him
[24:32.380 --> 24:39.100]  about at CC and that in dealing with people and documenting folks around the world and who are
[24:39.100 --> 24:46.940]  growing in situ and really some really cool cooperatives to get these genetics out and
[24:46.940 --> 24:56.780]  rediversify. So if we think about like an hourglass, you know, wild populations got the
[24:56.780 --> 25:02.940]  most diverse. It's got all those males going around, females going around, right? But as you
[25:02.940 --> 25:06.460]  get more selection, it's getting narrower and narrower and narrower and narrower. Right? And
[25:06.460 --> 25:10.780]  you bottleneck when you bring it out of the field and we have these cultivar. And so,
[25:11.500 --> 25:17.660]  when someone uses the word land-raise, again, a good thing we want to know is what level of
[25:19.420 --> 25:24.860]  that selection process is it at? Is it something that's grown in proximity to wild? Is it something
[25:24.860 --> 25:30.700]  that might've been a wild, feral, wild, whatever, right? It's gonna be super diverse. It's also
[25:30.700 --> 25:37.340]  gonna be wild, right? It's gonna be wild. You gotta tame it. It takes work to bring that into
[25:38.300 --> 25:45.100]  submission to where it's something that you can do a production thing with. Besides being sadistic,
[25:45.100 --> 25:49.180]  why would you even bother? What most people say, they see those little sprinkly little flowers and
[25:49.180 --> 26:00.380]  stuff. They're like, why would you even bother with that, man? Having a fully better understanding
[26:00.380 --> 26:09.580]  of how everything works, that's one thing for me. My desire and strife to produce more sustainable
[26:11.100 --> 26:19.180]  production methods, affecting how agricultural systems work in the world has been one of my
[26:19.180 --> 26:22.780]  life goals, even along with being a household name for hard work and the best dad I can for
[26:22.780 --> 26:29.980]  my daughter. Those are my three life goals. And so, if I collect wild grasses and my hikes on
[26:30.220 --> 26:36.860]  hills and from in my front yard, is it now a land race? Is it a wild cultivar?
[26:37.900 --> 26:41.820]  But we're not talking grasses. I'm just using these as examples. These are things I do.
[26:45.340 --> 26:57.420]  When you get, for instance, something, a Thai genetic, right? And there's a couple of
[26:58.380 --> 27:02.780]  it's kind of long understood from some of the older generations that there's a highland and
[27:02.780 --> 27:07.900]  a lowland in Thai. And that's stuff that you see in a theory in this chart describing.
[27:11.340 --> 27:19.580]  My descriptions deal with the end user concept of where did that come from? Is that coming from
[27:20.140 --> 27:24.220]  a garden patch in the jungle? There's a bunch of wild plants and these things can grow
[27:24.220 --> 27:30.780]  for 18 months of flower after nine months of vegetation and throw off an entire arm of male
[27:30.780 --> 27:35.580]  flowers off of a female plant and completely destroy somebody's growth three generations in
[27:35.580 --> 27:45.980]  if I didn't tame that wild genetic. That's where my word usage comes from and why I want to expand.
[27:46.460 --> 27:52.220]  When people are talking, it's like, and then versus I've got this PCK, it's been worked out.
[27:52.220 --> 27:58.140]  I don't know how many generations Ganabagian ran it before the guy I got it from got it. And he ran
[27:58.140 --> 28:05.420]  it for six generations and I've now run three, four. I'm getting into like F5 of an inbred
[28:05.420 --> 28:09.420]  side shoot and trying to keep two males and two females on my main line going, right?
[28:10.380 --> 28:14.460]  Trying to keep that 60, 40 purple, but I've been selecting towards more potent purple.
[28:15.420 --> 28:19.900]  And then my offshoot is just like everything's pinks and purples and oranges. There ain't no
[28:19.900 --> 28:25.420]  green left except for on the leaf. And it's got the frost and the potency of the green.
[28:25.420 --> 28:31.180]  It's no longer PCK, right? It's no longer Pakistani Chitwil Kush at that point.
[28:32.540 --> 28:37.260]  My hybrid stuff is, it still has diversity. You're going to find, my mentor told me walking
[28:37.260 --> 28:48.700]  in the fields around the Chitwil and Khyber, it was the narrowest leaf plant he had ever
[28:48.700 --> 28:56.300]  experienced in all his travels, right? In all his breeding and what for not was what we call
[28:56.300 --> 29:02.060]  Pakistani Chitwil Kush. And main line think of as an indica because most of the selections were
[29:02.060 --> 29:07.100]  more of a wide leaf plant. He says that was the narrowest plant he'd ever seen as far as
[29:07.100 --> 29:13.580]  the leaf structure goes. And I ended up getting some and they were coming out of this genetic
[29:13.980 --> 29:17.900]  was already inbred those many generations that were thinner than a pencil.
[29:18.780 --> 29:22.220]  Just amazing. And I wish I could find these pictures and repost. I don't think I have them
[29:22.220 --> 29:33.500]  on my Instagram. So when you see something for me called Purple Mutant Chitwil Stardust,
[29:33.500 --> 29:37.020]  I literally found the narrowest leaf mutated
[29:37.900 --> 29:43.340]  inbred Pakistani Chitwil Kush. I don't know how this guy I got it from said he thought he had
[29:43.340 --> 29:47.980]  bred that trait out, but there it was. And I had to tease some pollen out of it because it
[29:47.980 --> 29:53.580]  seemed like such a runt, right? And this is the stuff that my mentor and I would discuss. Why
[29:53.580 --> 29:57.740]  would you do that? Well, it ended up producing one of the largest colocides I'd ever grown.
[29:57.740 --> 30:06.140]  It's like Scott growing a moldy grow room so he knows how to fix it. I do the same thing with
[30:06.140 --> 30:12.780]  bugs and stuff, but I also do the same thing with these runt plants. And so we're really just
[30:12.780 --> 30:17.740]  opening up the genetics of these plants and we're just going to keep on growing them. And I think
[30:17.740 --> 30:21.660]  that's the most important thing. And I think that's the most important thing. And I think
[30:21.980 --> 30:29.340]  plants and so we're really just opening up the genetics of these plants. And we don't
[30:29.740 --> 30:37.500]  understand the true potential of individualized medicine regimes and all this stuff that's
[30:38.140 --> 30:47.820]  we've lost a lot. I mean, there used to be 12 precursors to human and we really or humanoid type
[30:47.820 --> 30:52.820]  things that were cruising around at one time.
[30:53.480 --> 30:57.360]  And we keep finding the Indonesian hobbit people, right?
[30:57.360 --> 31:01.440]  And various other lineages that became us
[31:01.440 --> 31:02.700]  and it's all lost.
[31:04.320 --> 31:06.320]  There might be a little bit of genetic code
[31:06.320 --> 31:09.200]  in some people in some regions of the world,
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.400]  but for the most part.
[31:10.400 --> 31:12.520]  So we don't want to lose all these capacities
[31:12.520 --> 31:14.080]  of these plants.
[31:14.080 --> 31:15.800]  And that's why we do preservation.
[31:16.640 --> 31:20.600]  Okay, and that's why we do these expansions first.
[31:20.600 --> 31:22.640]  And when I get ahold of any genetic
[31:22.640 --> 31:24.800]  that's been bottlenecked or not,
[31:24.800 --> 31:26.360]  I try and do an open pollination
[31:26.360 --> 31:28.580]  as many males and females as I can.
[31:29.560 --> 31:34.120]  And I do have, we all have the tendency of initially
[31:34.120 --> 31:38.320]  you're trying to remove whatever hermaphrodization we can.
[31:38.320 --> 31:40.000]  Right, and so I try and do two of them
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.680]  where I do a select and if I was one
[31:41.680 --> 31:43.920]  that didn't express hermaphrodization or intersecting,
[31:43.920 --> 31:45.080]  I'm gonna use that one.
[31:46.320 --> 31:48.400]  Or inbriding at the same time
[31:48.400 --> 31:50.520]  I'm doing an open pollination.
[31:50.520 --> 31:54.560]  We get to the next situation and it's a lot of work to do.
[31:54.560 --> 31:56.200]  The passion, right?
[31:56.200 --> 31:58.160]  It's not for everybody.
[31:58.160 --> 32:00.920]  There's a lot of intricacies for doing it
[32:00.920 --> 32:01.960]  when you get these plants in
[32:01.960 --> 32:03.760]  from different parts of the world.
[32:03.760 --> 32:04.840]  One of the things that cued me in
[32:04.840 --> 32:07.120]  to understanding the lighting and stuff,
[32:07.120 --> 32:09.320]  DJ Short would talk about in his projects
[32:09.320 --> 32:11.920]  and he's observing cultivars
[32:11.920 --> 32:13.520]  and moving them around in his room
[32:13.520 --> 32:15.240]  where they would get different angles of light
[32:15.680 --> 32:17.200]  and different spectrums from the mixed lighting
[32:17.200 --> 32:20.440]  back in the day was HPS and metal halide, right?
[32:20.440 --> 32:22.360]  And that's all you have with the blue and red.
[32:22.360 --> 32:26.200]  And he would observe the ones would be stouter
[32:26.200 --> 32:29.680]  under a direct angle of blue or red
[32:29.680 --> 32:32.280]  versus the side angle of one or the other.
[32:32.280 --> 32:36.280]  And these are observations I make with timing a year
[32:36.280 --> 32:39.360]  and putting things out from flip back into the sunshine
[32:39.360 --> 32:41.480]  and trying to determine like how do they respond
[32:41.480 --> 32:42.800]  with re-vegging and stuff.
[32:42.800 --> 32:44.120]  And I'm kind of reverse engineering
[32:44.120 --> 32:47.160]  trying to figure out what's in this, right?
[32:47.160 --> 32:50.080]  What exactly went into this poly-poly hybrid
[32:50.080 --> 32:53.720]  that I'm trying to read to cross back,
[32:53.720 --> 32:58.320]  cross to my wolf strength and produce better stuff.
[32:58.320 --> 32:59.640]  What's gonna pair with it?
[32:59.640 --> 33:00.720]  Who am I gonna give it to?
[33:00.720 --> 33:02.400]  So, and they asked me what fits
[33:02.400 --> 33:05.040]  in this region of the world, right?
[33:06.160 --> 33:10.040]  All these are reasons why I love what he's doing
[33:10.040 --> 33:12.760]  with this chart and describing the origins
[33:13.000 --> 33:16.000]  and it's just another way of describing
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.280]  where we found failure in, for instance,
[33:19.280 --> 33:22.600]  calling it a wide leaf or narrow leaf drug type
[33:22.600 --> 33:25.080]  when we see that Pakistani, Chitral Kush
[33:25.080 --> 33:26.320]  that we all think of as an indica
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.760]  actually can have an extremely narrow leaf.
[33:28.760 --> 33:31.800]  And of course, everything I'm saying here,
[33:31.800 --> 33:33.880]  there's somebody out there who's sitting there going,
[33:33.880 --> 33:37.000]  fucking Alex is full of bullshit, right?
[33:37.000 --> 33:37.840]  This is my reality.
[33:37.840 --> 33:38.680]  This is my experience.
[33:38.680 --> 33:41.560]  This is how I've gone through the last 35 years
[33:41.560 --> 33:42.440]  and come to this point.
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.280]  And I'm trying to explain to you
[33:44.280 --> 33:45.720]  how we all need to communicate
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.480]  and make sure we keep moving forward
[33:47.480 --> 33:49.480]  and why I've given up on saying
[33:49.480 --> 33:51.360]  you have to talk like I talk or something.
[33:51.360 --> 33:53.960]  If you see my discussion on this today,
[33:53.960 --> 33:55.200]  it came up and it's like, yeah,
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.840]  this is people get up in arms over,
[33:57.840 --> 34:01.120]  we have all egos and go back to it.
[34:01.120 --> 34:02.600]  It's like, I'm owning it up.
[34:02.600 --> 34:05.040]  Everyone loves Frenchie and I have real bad experience
[34:05.040 --> 34:08.840]  with them over word usage, literally the word keef.
[34:08.840 --> 34:12.320]  And I've been using it since I was a teenager
[34:13.200 --> 34:14.040]  and I broke out the dictionary
[34:14.040 --> 34:16.360]  that was printed the year I was born.
[34:16.360 --> 34:19.560]  That literally describes the etymology
[34:19.560 --> 34:22.720]  of the word keef from old Moroccan.
[34:22.720 --> 34:26.320]  I'm sorry, old Arabic, right?
[34:26.320 --> 34:30.000]  And Frenchie's first experience with the word
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.920]  was in Morocco and it describes chopped up leaf and tobacco.
[34:35.960 --> 34:37.360]  And that's awesome, that's his experience.
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.680]  And for whatever reason, our frequencies are so tight
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.440]  and there was this incongruency in our communication.
[34:45.440 --> 34:48.960]  And then, sorry, Frenchie, you're not an asshole.
[34:48.960 --> 34:52.160]  We just miscommunicated and had a,
[34:52.160 --> 34:53.640]  this is what I'm trying to say here
[34:53.640 --> 34:56.160]  is let's all continue to move forward
[34:56.160 --> 34:58.280]  on this communication and understanding why
[34:58.280 --> 34:59.920]  there's so many diverse forms.
[34:59.920 --> 35:02.680]  There's also, Arizona on his page shows these guys
[35:02.680 --> 35:04.960]  and I wanna say it's in Miramar.
[35:04.960 --> 35:06.760]  I could have this wrong, but these guys use
[35:06.760 --> 35:10.880]  that exact technique for consumption of cannabis
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.160]  where it is literally this just pressed ball of cannabis
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.520]  that they chop up with tobacco.
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.240]  And it's just like regional process.
[35:18.240 --> 35:21.880]  And I meant to, at one point when we were in that discussion
[35:21.880 --> 35:24.280]  look up what the word was that they use for it.
[35:24.280 --> 35:27.840]  Okay, and because there's a culture that's using that today
[35:27.840 --> 35:30.680]  and has that process and that's their culture.
[35:30.680 --> 35:32.880]  Like that's their exclusive consumption process.
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.720]  It's really crappy, just wet process packed together
[35:37.720 --> 35:40.640]  into these big bundles and like anything
[35:41.320 --> 35:42.160]  that's in the Western culture.
[35:42.160 --> 35:46.320]  And they have this amazing cultural process
[35:46.320 --> 35:49.080]  and a piece of a special knife and the stone
[35:49.080 --> 35:52.200]  and then they carry tobacco and they,
[35:52.200 --> 35:53.640]  a little thing of water to wet it with
[35:53.640 --> 35:56.040]  and they mix it all up and they make this paste
[35:56.040 --> 35:58.520]  and they smoke it and that's how they consume.
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.120]  You know, we want our dabs or some of us do.
[36:03.120 --> 36:05.520]  I like flour personally, whatever or hash.
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.200]  I love hash, I've been making hash since the mid eighties.
[36:11.240 --> 36:12.720]  I haven't stopped.
[36:12.720 --> 36:14.000]  I like playing with it, I like handling it.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.360]  I love all the different forms of it from around the world.
[36:16.360 --> 36:18.080]  And there's some amazing different techniques
[36:18.080 --> 36:19.440]  of producing resins.
[36:20.480 --> 36:24.000]  But we all today use the word kif the same way.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.880]  It's that resin that collects at the bottom of the bag
[36:26.880 --> 36:28.840]  and it's very similar to the chopped up.
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.520]  But the original word means feels good
[36:32.520 --> 36:34.360]  in the best translation I can find.
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.360]  And so, yeah, I love making land-raised hashes,
[36:42.800 --> 36:44.600]  the different flavors and stuff.
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.720]  Yeah, so I guess I was heading into about
[36:49.720 --> 36:51.200]  like some of the intricacies of growing
[36:51.200 --> 36:55.640]  and understanding those lights and stuff in your grow room
[36:55.640 --> 36:57.800]  and understanding that use more blue light
[36:57.800 --> 37:00.000]  when you're in flower sometimes might be important
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.600]  to keep a plant from stretching out of your ceiling.
[37:05.360 --> 37:10.360]  And I don't know, I've got a list of things
[37:10.840 --> 37:13.120]  that we were gonna go through.
[37:13.120 --> 37:16.280]  So just quickly on our slide chart.
[37:17.680 --> 37:21.440]  So after general land-raised garden variety.
[37:24.940 --> 37:26.380]  Right, so I kind of went through that,
[37:26.380 --> 37:28.180]  just talking about how as we move through
[37:28.180 --> 37:32.260]  from selecting a wild or feral
[37:32.260 --> 37:34.980]  or whatever it is population,
[37:35.140 --> 37:37.060]  something's getting grown in a small plot,
[37:37.060 --> 37:40.220]  whatever in primitive agriculture,
[37:40.220 --> 37:42.340]  it's gonna spread, it's gonna go feral
[37:42.340 --> 37:45.940]  and you've got a wild populations nearby.
[37:47.180 --> 37:49.900]  A great example, parallel example would be like,
[37:49.900 --> 37:54.900]  for instance, Bozeman, Montana, sweet pea festival.
[37:56.780 --> 37:59.700]  Right, sweet peas grow wild all over the place.
[37:59.700 --> 38:01.700]  And then people have their prize sweet peas
[38:01.700 --> 38:03.340]  and they're interbreeding and stuff, right?
[38:03.340 --> 38:05.180]  And they got their garden varieties of sweet peas
[38:05.180 --> 38:06.900]  and you can go online right now
[38:06.900 --> 38:09.740]  and find hundreds of very specific garden varieties
[38:09.740 --> 38:12.460]  of sweet pea and they are all getting produced
[38:12.460 --> 38:14.300]  whether it's been cultivated into,
[38:14.300 --> 38:16.660]  but they kind of select from something like that.
[38:18.820 --> 38:20.940]  And that's kind of the best way I can describe that.
[38:20.940 --> 38:22.500]  It's more of a, it's getting intermixed
[38:22.500 --> 38:25.740]  with a wild population still in my mind, right?
[38:25.740 --> 38:28.340]  And, but as we all understand,
[38:28.340 --> 38:29.980]  there's so many diverse pathways
[38:29.980 --> 38:31.460]  of how all this stuff moved about,
[38:31.460 --> 38:34.780]  so many possibilities that, you know,
[38:38.180 --> 38:40.580]  consider maybe with my New Mexico land grant
[38:40.580 --> 38:45.300]  when the Padres and the farmers there were growing that
[38:45.300 --> 38:50.300]  and it was, first went wild, right?
[38:52.460 --> 38:56.180]  And they kind of, they had a cultivar, it went wild,
[38:56.180 --> 38:58.580]  the wild population started adapting,
[38:58.580 --> 39:00.380]  however long they continued cultivating it,
[39:00.380 --> 39:02.420]  it was interacting, right?
[39:02.420 --> 39:05.180]  So there's different pathways of this happening,
[39:06.660 --> 39:09.260]  whether it was growing wild and they like,
[39:09.260 --> 39:13.460]  so, and hey, that's a better one for fiber.
[39:17.180 --> 39:18.660]  It's kind of weird, so it's kind of hard
[39:18.660 --> 39:21.060]  to just literally see, this is how it happened, right?
[39:21.060 --> 39:24.020]  It's like, how do birds migrate from,
[39:24.020 --> 39:25.740]  and the weather patterns in North America
[39:25.740 --> 39:28.700]  and they go all over the place, where's the water at?
[39:29.660 --> 39:30.980]  And how does it happen?
[39:30.980 --> 39:33.380]  It's confusing, so to simplify it,
[39:33.380 --> 39:36.660]  say this is the only way, you know,
[39:36.660 --> 39:38.380]  once upon a time ago, I used to believe
[39:38.380 --> 39:40.900]  all cannabis originated from Hindu Kush.
[39:40.900 --> 39:42.340]  I don't believe that anymore.
[39:43.300 --> 39:45.260]  It's quite possible the pollen says it came
[39:45.260 --> 39:48.800]  from the Himalayan pactos of Northwestern China.
[39:49.940 --> 39:51.380]  Today in the discussion, somebody brought up
[39:51.380 --> 39:52.980]  the possibility that it all came from Africa,
[39:52.980 --> 39:54.900]  I'd never heard that one before.
[39:54.900 --> 39:59.300]  So, but there's definitely, there's ways
[39:59.300 --> 40:04.300]  that we able to see with better information, science.
[40:05.300 --> 40:06.740]  Somebody asked us to bring up today
[40:06.740 --> 40:11.740]  that if there's actually three species of cannabis,
[40:14.340 --> 40:16.860]  and I'm not a geneticist so much,
[40:16.860 --> 40:20.800]  but somebody has come up with genetic proof
[40:20.800 --> 40:22.680]  showing that the Ruderalis is different
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.440]  from the Sativa from the Afganica, right?
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.440]  And how did those develop?
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.360]  Did Ruderalis go wild from Afganica
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.640]  or from a fire plant or, you know,
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.400]  and then we look at some of the chemical analysis
[40:44.400 --> 40:46.200]  of some of the older genetics and say,
[40:46.200 --> 40:47.960]  well, there's a lot of CBD in some of these
[40:47.960 --> 40:49.560]  and what were they, you know,
[40:49.560 --> 40:51.500]  some of them have that long inner node
[40:51.500 --> 40:53.300]  that have some of that CBD
[40:53.300 --> 40:55.900]  and you get that kind of natural one-to-one
[40:55.900 --> 40:59.620]  developed over time to that heirloom selection process
[40:59.620 --> 41:02.140]  that I've described in there,
[41:02.140 --> 41:03.820]  whereas we don't got any science to look at
[41:03.820 --> 41:05.220]  what's going on here, you know,
[41:05.220 --> 41:07.380]  it's a whole different thing once you have a laboratory
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.780]  and you're creating these hybrids
[41:09.780 --> 41:14.180]  that are scientifically analyzed, like the genetic,
[41:15.180 --> 41:20.180]  the genetic analysis guys are doing,
[41:22.420 --> 41:24.140]  looking for the markers and say,
[41:24.140 --> 41:26.900]  this one here is the mold preventer
[41:26.900 --> 41:29.300]  or this one here marker says,
[41:29.300 --> 41:31.980]  this one's susceptible to mold, right?
[41:31.980 --> 41:33.580]  And they're looking in and that's the same thing
[41:33.580 --> 41:36.140]  with our tomatoes, but what ends up happening at that point,
[41:36.140 --> 41:38.480]  you get all these super polyhybrid tomatoes
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.380]  that are developed in the university for disease resistance
[41:42.860 --> 41:44.540]  you know, TMD sucks in your tomatoes
[41:44.540 --> 41:46.100]  and you grow heirloom tomatoes.
[41:48.460 --> 41:52.280]  You ever seen a wild ground cherry tomato?
[41:53.340 --> 41:54.780]  It's a whole different thing.
[41:55.860 --> 41:58.260]  So, but the super hybrids,
[41:58.260 --> 42:00.140]  they don't necessarily have the flavor
[42:01.340 --> 42:04.380]  and so then they started breeding back in
[42:04.380 --> 42:08.740]  and doing these resistant heirlooms
[42:08.740 --> 42:11.380]  and same kind of concepts I'm looking for
[42:11.380 --> 42:13.020]  when I'm breeding with land race
[42:13.020 --> 42:18.020]  of whichever level of them breeding from wild
[42:18.020 --> 42:22.220]  to, you know, full on, I got to change the name now,
[42:22.220 --> 42:25.100]  it's no longer Pakistani, it's Jigil Kush,
[42:25.100 --> 42:26.180]  Zakhastani Kush.
[42:28.060 --> 42:30.780]  If you've never been to Zakhastan, visit,
[42:30.780 --> 42:31.740]  it's a great place.
[42:33.780 --> 42:35.620]  After the pandemic.
[42:35.620 --> 42:38.260]  Yeah, so let's see, I guess the next slide was
[42:38.260 --> 42:41.180]  regional heirlooms is what I'm talking about, right?
[42:42.100 --> 42:44.580]  That's what most of us get is a land race,
[42:44.580 --> 42:46.740]  I think literally when it comes down to it,
[42:47.940 --> 42:50.220]  we're getting something, I mean, we call it an Afghan,
[42:50.220 --> 42:52.500]  right, but you know, since I started breeding
[42:52.500 --> 42:55.580]  or working with Afghans, I got like 30 different Afghans
[42:55.580 --> 42:59.380]  that come from different families or regions, right?
[42:59.380 --> 43:01.100]  And like that Pakistani Jigil Kush,
[43:01.100 --> 43:03.060]  that's what I call a regional heirloom.
[43:04.700 --> 43:07.420]  And the discussion that we see in the literature
[43:07.420 --> 43:09.680]  talking about what is the land race,
[43:09.680 --> 43:13.480]  this kind of like really gives us that heart of that name,
[43:13.480 --> 43:15.280]  right, and I think this is what most people
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.240]  are really getting at when they say land races,
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.320]  is it's like, what, this is a,
[43:21.320 --> 43:24.360]  it totally coincides with a region,
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.560]  the weather, the land, it's not necessarily
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.960]  a selected one parent bottleneck hybrid, you know, inbred,
[43:35.720 --> 43:38.280]  it's got this diversity to it,
[43:38.280 --> 43:40.000]  it's got the hand of man to it,
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.000]  it's a production cultivar that's been selected
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.400]  for desired traits, right?
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.000]  And so that is, I think, like if you've got a bell-shaped
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.800]  curve of word usage in the word land race,
[43:52.800 --> 43:55.400]  that's gonna be the hottest point of occurrence,
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.120]  the top of your curve.
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.120]  Let's see, China did cannabis studies on the land race,
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.400]  determined it was the latitude that was the key factor.
[44:08.400 --> 44:10.160]  And the key factor to what?
[44:11.160 --> 44:13.080]  If you don't mind following up on that.
[44:14.680 --> 44:15.520]  They got a lot of different-
[44:15.520 --> 44:17.280]  I'll let you know when he responds.
[44:17.280 --> 44:20.160]  Cool, cool, yeah, they got a lot of diversity there,
[44:20.160 --> 44:22.000]  it's a big place, all right?
[44:22.000 --> 44:27.000]  And, you know, and also wasn't always all China.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.560]  So I have something from China that we were,
[44:29.680 --> 44:31.400]  several of them that I would love to get into a laboratory
[44:31.400 --> 44:33.520]  and try and revive, I've been interested with,
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.640]  that seemed to be dead, no one was able to revitalize
[44:36.640 --> 44:38.160]  and we need to get these into an auger
[44:38.160 --> 44:39.160]  with enzymes and stuff.
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.400]  But this other one that I got a hold of,
[44:41.400 --> 44:46.400]  and it went through a collection in Glaster Ban, I think,
[44:46.600 --> 44:48.560]  Germany, in their seed bank, and it was released
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.000]  and I acquired it through the infamous Preston,
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.800]  and I ended up acquiring pretty much the entire stock
[44:54.800 --> 44:56.640]  of original cannabis.
[44:56.680 --> 44:58.680]  I ended up acquiring pretty much the entire stock
[44:58.680 --> 45:01.560]  of original hemp seeds that he had before he bastardized
[45:01.560 --> 45:04.360]  a bunch of stuff with it and whatever happened.
[45:04.360 --> 45:07.240]  You know, hands off of that, but I ended up with,
[45:07.240 --> 45:09.720]  whatever went down, I ended up with people giving me,
[45:09.720 --> 45:13.200]  or I acquired through trade, one of the largest collections
[45:13.200 --> 45:15.720]  of old genetic hemps.
[45:15.720 --> 45:18.720]  And one of them was a,
[45:22.080 --> 45:23.640]  and it's funny, because he was calling them land races,
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.320]  but they weren't, these were full on,
[45:27.320 --> 45:30.440]  like, turn of the last century into the 30s in Europe,
[45:31.560 --> 45:34.600]  cultivars primarily, but some of them were closer
[45:34.600 --> 45:36.920]  to land race, like this thing from China
[45:36.920 --> 45:39.520]  that is called the pink, or Sengfei,
[45:39.520 --> 45:41.200]  is what I have understood it to be called,
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.080]  and it is tested at 3% and 3% THC and CBD
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.160]  by people who had access to doing that.
[45:47.160 --> 45:50.280]  And it was a, definitely it's a fiber and a medicinal,
[45:50.280 --> 45:52.800]  and it also produced a very beautiful, healthy seed.
[45:52.800 --> 45:54.280]  So it was a protein plant as well,
[45:54.320 --> 45:56.200]  and it was multipurpose.
[45:56.200 --> 46:00.080]  And that one particularly was spread all over the mainland
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.240]  of old China and into Korea and Japan as well,
[46:04.240 --> 46:06.480]  all tend to have that same genetic
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.720]  as what was reported there.
[46:10.720 --> 46:12.400]  I'm not sure if that one came out of the glass turbine
[46:12.400 --> 46:14.320]  or one of the other seed repositories
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.800]  that disposed all of their seeds sometime in the 80s.
[46:18.800 --> 46:23.800]  I'm not gonna, after our government,
[46:24.840 --> 46:26.880]  went even more full bore on the war on drugs
[46:26.880 --> 46:27.800]  and stuff like that.
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.800]  But yeah, so it's pretty neat trying to really look
[46:34.040 --> 46:35.440]  at the whole big question there,
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.200]  that the China genetics had determined they had more,
[46:39.200 --> 46:42.160]  they had three zones, one southern, one northern,
[46:42.160 --> 46:43.600]  and one in the middle.
[46:43.600 --> 46:45.160]  Yeah, which coincides pretty much
[46:45.160 --> 46:50.160]  with what Azarian's presenting.
[46:50.160 --> 46:52.560]  And he goes a little bit further
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.400]  and adds that elevation factor into your latitude.
[46:57.400 --> 47:02.400]  And because you get island endemics and such
[47:02.840 --> 47:07.840]  like with plant species, they get separated away.
[47:09.320 --> 47:13.240]  You know, like for instance, Morocco, right?
[47:13.240 --> 47:16.280]  And the Atlas Mountains, the elevations,
[47:16.280 --> 47:18.640]  they're growing over 12,000 feet in elevation
[47:18.640 --> 47:20.880]  right near the equator, right?
[47:20.880 --> 47:25.200]  So you take that and you put it down at sea level
[47:25.200 --> 47:27.680]  and it's not gonna perform the same thing.
[47:29.240 --> 47:31.520]  And that's where he's getting into
[47:31.520 --> 47:33.760]  and determining how and what.
[47:33.760 --> 47:35.000]  It's beautiful watching these guys
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.400]  growing their bellidia, right?
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.160]  And I think we'd all agree we consider bellidia
[47:40.160 --> 47:44.640]  to be grown over time immemorial in that location
[47:44.640 --> 47:49.640]  as an open pollinated but cultivated strain, right?
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.200]  So regional heirloom is what I would call that.
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.080]  May or may not have wild populations nearby.
[47:58.080 --> 48:00.200]  And but watching these Moroccans
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.320]  when they plant that, like right about now,
[48:02.320 --> 48:04.040]  I think starting to sprout up there.
[48:04.040 --> 48:07.800]  You know, they're up to 14,000, 12,000 feet or above.
[48:07.800 --> 48:10.040]  And here it's covered in snow.
[48:10.040 --> 48:13.000]  I went deep powder skiing and had one of the best runs
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.720]  in 10 years and 24 inches of snow the other day.
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.820]  10,000 feet was my top elevation, right?
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.120]  So we take those things into account, right?
[48:26.360 --> 48:29.400]  They plant those now and they're little seedlings
[48:29.400 --> 48:33.000]  and come into, I don't got it wrong.
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.340]  I think it's end of June or July.
[48:37.400 --> 48:38.480]  I could be wrong.
[48:38.480 --> 48:39.920]  It could be the very beginning of August,
[48:39.920 --> 48:42.020]  but it's like I'm harvesting garlic
[48:42.020 --> 48:45.780]  and they're sifting dry sift of beautiful bellidia.
[48:47.400 --> 48:48.920]  And it's like, well, is that an auto flower?
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  And it is what it is there.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.760]  I don't know how that's gonna perform specifically
[48:56.760 --> 48:58.560]  elsewise like that, right?
[48:58.560 --> 48:59.680]  I know some of the people have grown it
[48:59.680 --> 49:02.760]  and that's all.
[49:02.760 --> 49:04.900]  So knowing how bottlenecked it is,
[49:04.900 --> 49:06.520]  once you get it after those people grew it
[49:06.520 --> 49:08.600]  and things like that, it all changes.
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.520]  Some of the stuff that I was gonna tap on today
[49:12.520 --> 49:15.280]  and we'll bring up, we found out early
[49:15.920 --> 49:19.600]  when Azaria and I were doing interactions
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.160]  that taking seed even from a local cultivator
[49:28.520 --> 49:33.260]  and sending it to some location far away,
[49:34.800 --> 49:37.240]  that seed might not ever germinate.
[49:37.240 --> 49:40.960]  And so it was best for people in that location
[49:40.960 --> 49:44.440]  to select a cultivar or a representative
[49:44.720 --> 49:47.920]  of whatever that land race might be from wild
[49:50.760 --> 49:55.760]  to very well inbred regional cultivar or heirloom.
[49:56.080 --> 50:01.080]  And that getting reproduced in mass
[50:02.280 --> 50:05.880]  in modern kind of situation
[50:05.880 --> 50:08.160]  where it can epigenetically adapt
[50:08.160 --> 50:13.160]  to a different growing situation, not in the field.
[50:13.560 --> 50:16.440]  And then move from that position
[50:16.440 --> 50:18.920]  to people's private collections
[50:18.920 --> 50:23.840]  for breeding preservation abroad, exit to.
[50:23.840 --> 50:25.840]  And that's a word you might see.
[50:27.720 --> 50:30.160]  The word that brought me on the show actually
[50:30.160 --> 50:32.580]  was when I saw you guys talking about exit to.
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.080]  And again, so that's reproduced as best you can
[50:39.080 --> 50:40.980]  away from the place of origin.
[50:41.940 --> 50:45.060]  And in situ is reproducing in its place of origin.
[50:45.860 --> 50:48.780]  So, and that compounds that whole,
[50:48.780 --> 50:49.740]  like, well, is it wild?
[50:49.740 --> 50:53.260]  Is it not wild inclusive in land race?
[50:54.700 --> 50:58.340]  So once, and here's where the magic happens is
[50:58.340 --> 50:59.780]  once you go to a wild population
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.940]  and take it to the hand of man,
[51:00.940 --> 51:02.380]  does it magically become a land race
[51:02.380 --> 51:04.180]  if it only includes the hand of man?
[51:06.060 --> 51:09.000]  Anyhow, these are all just deep thoughts from Alex.
[51:09.840 --> 51:12.880]  Because I'm not telling you
[51:12.880 --> 51:14.800]  you have to utilize my word usage.
[51:14.800 --> 51:17.080]  I'm saying this is the word usage that gets used
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.520]  and this is the discussion around it
[51:19.520 --> 51:21.120]  and have a better understanding
[51:21.120 --> 51:25.540]  of what you're getting when you get it or don't.
[51:27.120 --> 51:30.320]  It'd be nice if people did more production
[51:30.320 --> 51:34.780]  of some of these because they're amazing.
[51:36.520 --> 51:37.880]  Again, you're gonna get it and you're gonna go,
[51:37.880 --> 51:39.200]  man, that's just horrible.
[51:39.200 --> 51:40.960]  I'm gonna show you something right now.
[51:40.960 --> 51:44.540]  This is one of the most asked for medicines from patients.
[51:45.560 --> 51:46.400]  Let's see.
[51:47.440 --> 51:51.880]  And it literally, it was just foxtails.
[51:54.200 --> 51:57.400]  And it was a feral Sheela Guapi from India
[51:57.400 --> 52:00.920]  that Zarian sent me back in the day.
[52:02.440 --> 52:06.000]  I had it inbred and sent back and hybridized
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.560]  and created something I call Peacemaker,
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.300]  taking that Pakistani, which is horrible for mold.
[52:14.680 --> 52:17.200]  Those dry climates, they don't do well
[52:17.200 --> 52:19.000]  when you move them to a wet climate.
[52:22.760 --> 52:26.120]  And I hybridized it with that tropical open stem.
[52:28.840 --> 52:31.560]  The picture in my mind is a bunch of small little golf balls
[52:31.560 --> 52:33.160]  on a big long stem.
[52:33.160 --> 52:35.920]  They're too small to get big enough to rock inside.
[52:37.120 --> 52:39.560]  If you can keep those smaller than two inches, they won't.
[52:39.560 --> 52:43.800]  But those are all reasons why it really helps to know
[52:43.800 --> 52:48.000]  what the person you're talking to
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.200]  when he says land race means.
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.520]  And again, we all know there's some people
[52:52.520 --> 52:56.040]  that this only means that.
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.280]  And I'm saying, well, it means this, this, this.
[52:59.280 --> 53:00.780]  It depends on who's saying it.
[53:01.780 --> 53:02.980]  That word, fuck.
[53:04.620 --> 53:05.660]  If we open the dictionary,
[53:05.660 --> 53:07.460]  we're gonna find an actual definition of it.
[53:07.460 --> 53:10.660]  And that's where, if we could, it'd be great
[53:12.300 --> 53:14.060]  to agree on it that way.
[53:17.740 --> 53:20.080]  Jargon, just don't pull the thumb over somebody
[53:20.080 --> 53:22.540]  because they didn't use it the way you want them to.
[53:22.540 --> 53:25.140]  That's where I come to, is just like,
[53:25.140 --> 53:27.240]  hey, this is how I use it and this is why.
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.720]  So there's this last slide.
[53:33.720 --> 53:35.880]  We did the regional, right?
[53:35.880 --> 53:36.720]  Yeah, we did.
[53:36.720 --> 53:37.800]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:37.800 --> 53:39.340]  And then this one.
[53:41.520 --> 53:42.880]  Called the bar of land race.
[53:42.880 --> 53:44.200]  Yeah, so I kind of went over that.
[53:44.200 --> 53:48.480]  That's what, once somebody who's gone out
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.800]  to that location on the land where the people interact
[53:52.800 --> 53:56.800]  and have created that, what was mostly referred to
[53:56.800 --> 53:58.440]  as land race out in the field,
[54:00.520 --> 54:04.520]  it becomes a cultivar, right?
[54:04.520 --> 54:06.040]  You selected it.
[54:06.040 --> 54:08.840]  And at that point, it bottlenecks.
[54:08.840 --> 54:11.400]  There's no way to maintain the diversity
[54:11.400 --> 54:13.760]  of those field crops above, right?
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.880]  And in descending order, you're losing diversity.
[54:17.880 --> 54:22.480]  And so we cultivate, we cultivate, we IBL, we select.
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.720]  And for the most part, most of us are just using
[54:24.720 --> 54:27.720]  the same heirloom selection processes.
[54:27.720 --> 54:31.200]  And some of us might have access to testing
[54:31.200 --> 54:34.960]  in the laboratory for afterwards,
[54:34.960 --> 54:37.000]  seeing what the contents of the plant is.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  And some of us might now have access to genomics
[54:42.920 --> 54:45.680]  to see if this is susceptible to rot, okay?
[54:45.680 --> 54:48.840]  So at that point, these things are no longer land races,
[54:48.840 --> 54:49.680]  right?
[54:49.680 --> 54:51.160]  They are cultivar of land races
[54:51.160 --> 54:53.920]  and to call them a land race is incorrect
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.320]  unless you're utilizing that hyphenated,
[54:58.360 --> 54:59.280]  that word, right?
[54:59.280 --> 55:03.160]  But again, that's mostly what we're buying
[55:03.160 --> 55:06.800]  when we buy a land race is something that's been bottlenecked
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.240]  in bread, whether it's two males, two females
[55:11.240 --> 55:13.400]  is sometimes the best I'm reproducing.
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.080]  And we have the best of our capacities to do these things.
[55:19.680 --> 55:21.400]  One of the most important things I find
[55:21.400 --> 55:25.160]  in the ethics of it all is just disclosing what did
[55:25.160 --> 55:27.680]  so the next person has a clue, right?
[55:28.520 --> 55:30.080]  A lot of the stuff I get, I got in trade
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.080]  and have not a lot of knowledge of its previous stewardship.
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.440]  And so it helps to know all that stuff
[55:40.440 --> 55:41.560]  that we're talking about in these charts
[55:41.560 --> 55:44.080]  is to know when I do grow it to see what happens,
[55:45.160 --> 55:50.160]  you know, and by region, what was it used for?
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.520]  These things all vary greatly and how did they process it?
[55:55.520 --> 55:56.640]  And that's gonna make a big difference
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.160]  in whether it's in what you're doing
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.200]  and you're breeding or producing a medicine
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.720]  for yourself or others, searching for that medicine.
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.080]  Think about that was for CBG plants,
[56:13.080 --> 56:17.080]  scraggly ass, scraggly looking little things, right?
[56:17.080 --> 56:18.920]  And just in the matter of like three years,
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.120]  those guys hybridized that CBG production
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.280]  into these beautiful big plants.
[56:24.520 --> 56:27.160]  It looked like cannabis flowers, marijuana flowers,
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.680]  whatever you wanna call it, using the terminology,
[56:29.680 --> 56:31.520]  it's all cannabis, but it looked like
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.800]  these scraggly wild plants when we first started out
[56:33.800 --> 56:36.360]  with just a couple of little calyxes on it, right?
[56:37.960 --> 56:40.760]  There's potentials in all of this stuff.
[56:40.760 --> 56:43.760]  The story about the miracle pig, right?
[56:43.760 --> 56:47.640]  Wilbur and name your empty plants
[56:47.640 --> 56:50.160]  that do the right medicine for you, Wilbur.
[56:50.160 --> 56:55.160]  Yeah, yeah, so yeah, then you start hybridizing with them.
[56:56.440 --> 56:58.400]  They'll finish that bottleneck talk
[56:58.400 --> 57:00.240]  or the hourglass, right?
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.360]  So we bottlenecked in and species or genetic diversity
[57:04.360 --> 57:07.360]  is been completely refined from that wild
[57:07.360 --> 57:10.040]  at the most diverse in this wild populations
[57:10.040 --> 57:12.400]  with no selection of male or female
[57:12.400 --> 57:15.040]  and they're able to adapt to that locality.
[57:15.040 --> 57:18.680]  And then as it interacts with garden or regional
[57:18.680 --> 57:20.040]  and you still have open pollination,
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.840]  but not necessarily may or may not have wild populations
[57:22.840 --> 57:26.600]  around them because of agricultural sanitation
[57:26.600 --> 57:27.600]  and things like that.
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.720]  You might have a couple of males,
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.920]  but when you're doing these production runs,
[57:34.920 --> 57:37.680]  those guys are doing these huge fields in Afghanistan.
[57:37.680 --> 57:40.600]  They can't do that all with just one male, right?
[57:40.600 --> 57:42.200]  They do go through and call males and stuff
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.440]  and I'm sure they have specs for it.
[57:43.440 --> 57:45.120]  I've not been able to chat with any of them about that.
[57:45.120 --> 57:47.680]  I just see some videos of them doing it sometimes.
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.600]  And people do this differently.
[57:51.600 --> 57:54.680]  Every village, every region,
[57:55.760 --> 57:57.440]  how many land races are there?
[57:58.560 --> 57:59.720]  You name a village,
[58:01.600 --> 58:03.320]  anywhere where it hasn't been eradicated
[58:03.320 --> 58:05.020]  and there's a land race, right?
[58:05.960 --> 58:10.960]  That's, you know, we don't have places here where we get,
[58:12.600 --> 58:15.080]  we're starting to develop land races back in the States
[58:15.920 --> 58:17.800]  and everything gets bottlenecked after selection.
[58:17.800 --> 58:19.080]  It gets more bottlenecked, more bottlenecked,
[58:19.080 --> 58:20.920]  more refined, more refined.
[58:20.920 --> 58:22.960]  And then you start breeding with it.
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.240]  And maybe some of those recessed traits get expressed
[58:26.240 --> 58:29.920]  in those pretty much every time you start hybriding,
[58:29.920 --> 58:31.440]  that's gonna happen.
[58:31.440 --> 58:35.240]  You've got to refined cultivars of anything,
[58:35.240 --> 58:36.880]  whether you're super polyhybrid
[58:36.880 --> 58:39.840]  and then back refining an IBL5
[58:39.840 --> 58:42.960]  and you cross that to another, it's possible to be there.
[58:42.960 --> 58:45.080]  Any seed you open up, it's a new hybrid.
[58:45.080 --> 58:48.400]  There is those possibilities with some recessive
[58:48.400 --> 58:52.280]  or double recessive or chain linked double recessive
[58:53.200 --> 58:56.780]  comes out and expresses itself through.
[58:58.160 --> 59:00.080]  All that's important in understanding.
[59:00.080 --> 59:02.480]  But in case, so yeah, is we polyhybrid though,
[59:02.480 --> 59:04.400]  we're just polyhybrid and we're like, man,
[59:04.400 --> 59:07.080]  we've got all this diversity and all this gene pool
[59:07.080 --> 59:09.320]  that we have with all of these polyhybrids
[59:09.320 --> 59:10.160]  we have on the shelf.
[59:10.160 --> 59:14.440]  It's like, no, those all came from a very select few group
[59:14.440 --> 59:18.120]  of land-raised cultivars back in the 80s.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.200]  And that all, everything hybridized from that.
[59:22.200 --> 59:25.880]  And now we're just in the last through the internet
[59:25.880 --> 59:30.120]  been able to go global and make these connections
[59:30.120 --> 59:32.160]  where we're now re-diversifying
[59:32.160 --> 59:36.080]  from those open pollinated populations.
[59:36.080 --> 59:38.720]  And people are getting this genetic populations
[59:38.720 --> 59:39.880]  that they'll be able to select through
[59:40.880 --> 59:45.880]  and each person who goes through a 10 or 20 pack
[59:45.880 --> 59:49.200]  of one of those is gonna have a different representation,
[59:49.200 --> 59:52.480]  a different cultivar and a different possibility
[59:52.480 --> 59:54.760]  of where that can go, especially with their libraries
[59:54.760 --> 59:56.160]  that they have to work with.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.080]  Yeah, that's.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.280]  So.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.320]  Oh, here's a question.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.000]  Smiley's garden had a question I was thinking about earlier
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.640]  which is let's go back 100 years ago
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.920]  when it wasn't being eradicated or 150 or whatever
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.800]  and people were traveling around the world
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.440]  and this is something that was growing
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.720]  in different regions of the world.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.720]  If I brought seeds from outside the local wild population
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.240]  and introduced them, wouldn't I be adding genetic diversity
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.120]  rather than starting the bottlenecking?
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:33.960]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.680]  So in that scenario, that's totally hypothetical
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.880]  because back 120 years ago,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.640]  say before eradication really began,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.760]  it was going seaport to seaport.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.600]  It was getting traded by overland traders
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.600]  and nobody who was selling it knew the breed,
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.920]  we're gonna get that happening.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  But in the 70s when my mentor was doing this,
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.400]  exactly what happened was that.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.240]  But what happens is if you bottleneck
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.240]  into a dominant genetic presentation
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.120]  and bring it into that diverse population,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.320]  it's going to dominate and overbear, right?
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.480]  You've got an extremely diverse population there
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.880]  but if you end up overbearing that population
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.520]  like what Arjun says happened in Jamaica, okay?
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.240]  And they say bringing in polyhybrids into that zone
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.200]  completely wiped out all the native land races
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.680]  that they had heirloom there for generations, okay?
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.000]  And there could be legal reasoning for that as well
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.600]  where eradication was happening, right?
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.920]  But at the same time when they're saying
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.560]  that it had no effect in the land race populations
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.280]  of Africa totally absorbed or India totally absorbed
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.120]  the genetics they brought in.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.240]  That's questions that my mentor and I were like,
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.240]  yeah, and he had, I believe a master's in plant genetics.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.720]  His parents were human cancer geneticists,
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.240]  both Nobel Prize winning doctors and stuff.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.320]  So our discussions would go as far as I can
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.360]  but I don't even understand so much, right?
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.600]  I have so much science and other people have none
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.680]  and some people have extremely more than me, right?
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.120]  So trying to figure that out, my understanding,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.120]  my belief is those original diverse populations
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.680]  were way more diverse than after we bottlenecked
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.120]  and created these dominant strains
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.760]  that have dominant bottleneck polyhybrid situation.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.520]  So if you went in there with like a less dominant population
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.880]  with a more dominant hybrid
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.920]  that it wasn't so strongly bred in
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.920]  and it would more easily be absorbed, right?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.760]  And so these are things that you hear about people
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.520]  who were breeding with the male over time
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.000]  and they're looking at, I know what this male does
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.480]  and I hit it to a new female
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.200]  and see what the response is, right?
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.480]  Eventually in breeding, you get to be able
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.320]  to really understand these intricacies
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.960]  and part of the hard part of as we move
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.760]  into the scientific world and legality of cannabis
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.920]  is translating all of this
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.000]  before it does completely bottleneck.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.040]  And here at the University of Utah,
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.920]  they're studying for instance,
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.880]  hemp genomic scientifically in a laboratory
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.640]  and wonderful, does Bugsby?
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.560]  I'm sorry if I got it wrong, I totally got it wrong.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.000]  But the good doctor up there is used to working,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.440]  he's a master of understanding light
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.080]  and plant response to light.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.480]  And my understanding is he did quite a bit of work
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.720]  with lettuce, all right?
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.080]  And but lettuce had already been inbred
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.240]  to these specific cultivars for a hundred years
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.400]  and laboratory analyzed and everything.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.080]  And then here we all know and understand
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.760]  that each one of these different,
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.880]  what we will call a strain of cannabis
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.960]  or hybrid of cannabis completely acts differently
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.960]  to all these different environmental stimulus
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.560]  and epigenic response to these things.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.960]  And so one cultivar does not feed the same way
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.320]  and it's very difficult to feed them all at the same time
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:45.040]  on one hydro system for instance, right?
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:48.760]  And so but they're doing science with a strain of hemp
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.560]  in a hydro system and hemp just doesn't even like hydroponics
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.320]  to begin with unless you've adapted, cultivated
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.440]  and bred one that likes a wet foot,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.280]  but it generally likes a more open loam
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.280]  for it to grow in preferably in general, right?
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.480]  I'm gonna say that because they're all different.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.360]  And that's where we end up having issues
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.640]  with moving into science.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.440]  It's like, man, this thing is,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.600]  it's a big thing you put your head around.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.880]  And wrapping your head around that entire concept,
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.720]  it literally each five minutes of what I said today
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.800]  is a whole two hour show with a panel, right?
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.640]  Having a discussion.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.800]  I'm not saying anything other than
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.360]  it's not my way or the highway, it's a big wide way.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.840]  And let's all walk our way along it.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.320]  And some point along the way here,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.360]  everyone's gonna get healed hopefully.
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:06:00.830]  Let me bring up this chart.
[01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:05.790]  You can kind of give your comments on it.
[01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.470]  And then maybe next week we can, let me see.
[01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:10.390]  I'm guessing he's asleep.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.310]  That would be my best guess.
[01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:13.030]  Yeah, I mean, it may well be,
[01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.110]  literally on the other side of the world from us, right?
[01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:21.110]  There's also a bunch of controversy came up on my post today
[01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.390]  preluding to the talk.
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:27.190]  And I don't think he really wanted to pursue controversy
[01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.470]  and might've felt shy at that, whatever.
[01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:30.950]  I don't wanna presume either.
[01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:36.190]  But this right here and this whole,
[01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.950]  today's talk was spurred from his second presentation
[01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:39.790]  of this.
[01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:42.110]  I'm not sure if you got the, it's so fine for me.
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.990]  I can't see it on my phone.
[01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:48.030]  But so the May 13th of 2020 is when he first posted it
[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.630]  and it's clear in the newer one he posted it,
[01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:51.950]  it's a little fuzzy.
[01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:55.910]  Basically what I was describing here is like,
[01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:59.430]  so up in the Arctic at sea level, you can find lichen
[01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:04.430]  and at the equator,
[01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:10.950]  you gotta go up to 18,000 feet if you can find it, right?
[01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.230]  But it's there.
[01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:15.310]  And you think about like the snows of Kilimanjaro,
[01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.630]  right there in the middle of where?
[01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:19.790]  And of course they're like melting away,
[01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.870]  but that's a whole another.
[01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.270]  Reason why we want to understand land race is like,
[01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:29.350]  where can we do this and use less water?
[01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.990]  Where can we adapt?
[01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:32.510]  Where can we make things work?
[01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.310]  Backgrass and that wolf,
[01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:41.270]  you select where you're living on that chart.
[01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:45.310]  You select someplace around the globe that corresponds,
[01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:46.150]  right?
[01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:47.430]  And you can go up and down.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.990]  You can go from the far corner, right?
[01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:51.670]  As long as you're kind of like looking at like,
[01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.670]  okay, I live that this amount of latitude
[01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:00.550]  that's up and down, North and South, right?
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.310]  And I'm at this elevation,
[01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:07.030]  where else on the globe can I select a particular
[01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:12.950]  to match what I'm wanna back cross this polyhybrid
[01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:14.350]  I have to strengthen it.
[01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.910]  Okay.
[01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.670]  How am I gonna make something work better for me
[01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:25.910]  where I live to provide for all those around me
[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.670]  with putting less energy in it,
[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:30.470]  reducing my footprint.
[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:36.390]  How all this knowledge adds up, right?
[01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.950]  Some of us just grow these things and see what they do.
[01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.430]  And like, not everyone can do that.
[01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.350]  That's not,
[01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.950]  but the amount of people I've helped
[01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.190]  with some of these more wild plants.
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.030]  And they're like, dude, that one,
[01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:52.790]  man, so hard to grow.
[01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.150]  Here, take the seed and grow it.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.750]  It's a powerful thing when you've got it all
[01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.630]  under control though, right?
[01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:06.430]  The communication, the acquisition,
[01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:10.430]  the presentation for our medicines.
[01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:13.830]  Our medicines, let's go away.
[01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:16.270]  It's so fine.
[01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:18.510]  And at 50 years old,
[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:20.550]  I haven't found a pair of glasses that work yet.
[01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:22.990]  And I don't know exactly why, but.
[01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.550]  Well, this is talking about zone A,
[01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.910]  tropical lowlands, A1, 16 to 20 weeks,
[01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:32.190]  tropical highlands, A2, 14 to 18 weeks,
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:37.190]  zone B, temperate lowlands, 13 to 15 weeks.
[01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:40.030]  Same exact thing as the round chart
[01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:41.910]  but in a different form, right?
[01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:43.110]  Different graph form.
[01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:47.150]  So yeah, so it literally is just,
[01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:48.230]  just kind of like saying,
[01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:50.310]  hey, this is where this was done at.
[01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:55.270]  Because we can find tropical plants with wide leaf.
[01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:58.710]  We can find Alpine Northern Latitude plants
[01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.030]  with narrow leaf.
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.030]  Okay.
[01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.150]  And so those are great descriptors,
[01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.350]  but they don't cover everything.
[01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:10.870]  And mine, my little group of words,
[01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:12.630]  they cover what they cover.
[01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.710]  And they don't,
[01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.350]  they aren't ultimate descriptors of everything, right?
[01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.110]  And what he's describing here
[01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:21.750]  does not ultimately describe everything either.
[01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:25.550]  It's just another tool we can use to communicate
[01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:30.550]  in discussion of what, why, where, when.
[01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:36.030]  You know, if you know, it might be 120 days of flowering.
[01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:39.790]  That might not be something you want to spend,
[01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:42.230]  you know, your hard-earned dollars on
[01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.950]  investing on trying to reproduce
[01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:48.950]  without having an artificial environment for it.
[01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:50.550]  Depending on your location.
[01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:53.710]  If you live in a Mediterranean zone,
[01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:57.270]  you can play with just about any of these things, right?
[01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:02.030]  Because if you understand how your personal environment is,
[01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:05.350]  right, that's another thing,
[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:07.150]  is understanding where you live
[01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:12.150]  and how much you can minimally adapt to your microclimates
[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:16.550]  with a greenhouse or a cold frame, right?
[01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.830]  And that's one person's cold frame
[01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:20.430]  is another person's greenhouse.
[01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.190]  But that makes a huge difference.
[01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:27.630]  You know, understanding what these things are growing in,
[01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.750]  whether it was a field or a wild or whatnot,
[01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:30.950]  or what they prefer,
[01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:32.630]  and like the kind of soils
[01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:35.870]  and what kind of cultural practices were done to the soils
[01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.750]  and the fields they were growing,
[01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.270]  all that stuff can really add up
[01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:42.550]  into trying to reproduce that experience,
[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:45.870]  whether that is exactly what you want to do,
[01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:50.870]  is reproduce the particular sacred plant experience
[01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:52.830]  that comes from a various region
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:55.030]  that we no longer have this international shipping trades
[01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.710]  that used to bring this stuff around from various ports
[01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:00.990]  and different medicines.
[01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:05.510]  And, you know, you hear people talking
[01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:07.390]  about the little tender joints,
[01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.670]  you'd smoke it and several hours later,
[01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:11.510]  you're just spaced out of your gourd,
[01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.790]  like what just happened to me?
[01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:16.390]  And it was like an 11% sativa.
[01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:19.550]  You've never experienced that
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:22.230]  because you've never grown 120 days of sativa.
[01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:23.150]  Even though I think, you know,
[01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:25.230]  they might be a little more potent than that, some of them.
[01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.950]  I know I'm quite certain
[01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:32.070]  the Malawi gold I offer is considerably more potent
[01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.910]  than that.
[01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:36.270]  I don't know that the Shiloh Vlathi was though,
[01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.470]  when it came down to it.
[01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:42.310]  And maybe 15% tops,
[01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:45.630]  but that's the one when I had it that everybody wanted.
[01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.470]  So actually Magma Seeds asked in the very beginning
[01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.830]  and I told him I'd ask you later,
[01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:53.990]  but he asked where you sourced your Malawi from.
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:02.220]  There's a guy that went by the name of the Illegally Alive,
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:08.580]  who I supplied his FECO for his cancer treatments.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:13.780]  And he went full on pushing the legality
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:20.380]  of cannabis medically in Florida
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.380]  after we saved his life with FECO, raw cannabis oil.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.580]  And he was so damn sick.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.700]  So I ran a group called the Land Race Traders Club.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.020]  And through that group, there's about a thousand of us
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.380]  that we had a mission statement
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.100]  that was basically to provide medicine
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.700]  to those who need it and reproduce and preserve
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.620]  for those who need it in the future.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.420]  And our only deal was you could get cannabis
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:52.420]  and you could trade and get paid in stamps.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:58.020]  And through that group, I made quite a lot of connections
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.140]  and we did some other amazing things.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.140]  Some other groups spun out of that.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.460]  We healed a lot of people.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.380]  We saved a lot of lives, a lot of things shizzled off.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:12.020]  And then, but people saw that there was a financial potential
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:12.860]  for that group.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.620]  And we're quite angry about A,
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.060]  not being able to advertise in that group.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.940]  We were very strict.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.940]  And or B, I did do an offering charging postage
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.100]  for years of hard work where I distributed
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.500]  a shit ton of seed for free.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.660]  Otherwise, it's small, nonimal.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:32.980]  I think it was under $20 a pack and included the,
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.980]  whatever it was, people got upset
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.420]  and that place fell apart.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:41.020]  And somebody reported it for selling drugs,
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.460]  which never happened through there.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:47.100]  And that's where I acquired that.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.940]  That particular fellow that everyone was hating on
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.460]  because they didn't realize he was like dying
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.620]  in the hospital, you know, and in need of love
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.580]  and not people harping on him for not getting the seed
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.060]  they traded with them.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.940]  And that's exactly where that seed came from.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.700]  It was labeled Malawi Gold on the pack when I got it.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:08.660]  And there's later, there's definitely once you become
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.180]  a public figure, there's people who disagree with you
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.740]  with all sorts of stuff.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.420]  And some people become enamorated to you.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.580]  And by no means do I have all people who love me.
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.500]  You can read that discussion day on Instagram.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.380]  I'm an asshole to people who perceive me to be an asshole.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.220]  There is one person in particular who's called
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.860]  into question a particular person who grew that seed
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.580]  from seed 12 and 12.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.020]  And it produced a wider leaf throughout
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:44.540]  that entire growth period of growing from 12 and 12
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.500]  from seed than you would expect to see
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.940]  from a fully mature plant that was grown
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:55.940]  from sexual maturity stage after it had vegetated
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.620]  for a while and then flipped over.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.620]  And as we all know, every plant will have a wider leaf
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:06.620]  to a narrower leaf as it progresses into flower.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.460]  And you can see pictures of Franco standing in fields
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.380]  of Malawi Gold particularly,
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:18.340]  where you have extremely wide leaf down by his calf
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.300]  and extremely pencil thin leaves up by his elbows.
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.220]  So this is just a trait that occurs in all plants.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.940]  And as I said before, there is diversity
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.580]  in all of these plants.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.260]  And before I even presented and I checked
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:40.540]  with a group called the Malawi Land Race Preservation.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.500]  And it was a couple of brothers there in Malawi.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.700]  And I checked with them and he said, yeah,
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.820]  we have great diversity depending on highland and lowland.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.620]  We cover all of our geography and weather here
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.740]  that this wonderful country has.
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.740]  And it's part of our land race.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:02.460]  And I grew it out 120 days before it matured
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.820]  under the microscope and smoke it.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.300]  And I was like, holy shit,
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.940]  this is nothing I've ever smoked before.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.540]  And I went ahead and sent out some packs of Malawi Gold,
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.860]  maybe a dozen.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.780]  And like you said, this one patient grew it like that
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.300]  from seed 12 to 12 to try and cut out some of that
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.540]  to six month period.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:25.860]  And one person who had enmity to me decided to say,
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.380]  this person who had also never grown an Afghan skunk
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.940]  in their life or Malawi Gold in their life,
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.580]  started a huge controversy and tagged me 300 times
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.940]  in one day in another land race group,
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.140]  declaring that it was not Malawi Gold.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.060]  But other people have grown it out.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:46.060]  Kimberly Lydia in Colorado grew it out
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:51.020]  and affirmed in her belief it is definitely 120 day
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.060]  Malawi Gold with THDV in it.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:56.820]  Whatever, y'all can buy a sack and grow it out
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:59.100]  and have it genetically tested if you desire.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.620]  But that's part of the reality of all of this.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.300]  We really, we don't know.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.220]  Unless you went out to the field and got it yourself,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:08.060]  you don't know.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.940]  But I went through all of that confirmation
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.860]  and dealt with like everybody asking where that came from.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.900]  You're the first person in two years now
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.340]  since I've heard anyone bring that up.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:22.920]  And then I've blocked Mike on every platform I possibly can.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.700]  Because I just don't need it.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.060]  Someone wants to pay for the genetic test,
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.340]  I got some of it downstairs.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.840]  I'll send it, please do.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.040]  It'd be neat to find out if it got hybrid
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.040]  at some point or whatnot.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.200]  But there is something else I'm gonna work on very soon
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.200]  with Stan Craig.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.680]  I'm not sure if Stan Craig has kicked the bucket or not.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.000]  I know he was sick.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.960]  And I acquired sort of the same group of people from him,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.840]  Malawi Gold that he had inbred down over 12 generations
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.040]  into something closer to 60 days, maybe to 70.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.800]  And soon open that up and do a compare comparison
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.360]  to see what we can do with them.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.960]  But definitely at some point,
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.640]  the particular Malawi Gold I have was bottlenecked away
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.360]  from that general population.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.960]  So if at any point, you look at it and you say,
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.680]  it doesn't look like the Malawi Gold I've grown.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.260]  Well, it probably isn't.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.600]  And that's the nature of it.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.200]  This is definitely an inbred cultivar that I've got.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.160]  I can't fathom it being anything that was close
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.560]  to being a wild or garden variety from Malawi.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.080]  But it does still retain specific flavor notes
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.000]  that meet the criteria, flower structure
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.080]  from what I've seen meet the criteria.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.960]  Yeah, it's a great question.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960]  And thanks for bringing it to the forefront.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.700]  Appreciate the opportunity to teach and learn.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.560]  Yeah.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.240]  The social media though is like,
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.560]  anyone can say anything, right?
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.800]  I've never grown that, but I know what that is.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.640]  That's what we call a troll.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.480]  But I have an opinion.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.480]  It could be a troll.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.580]  I have the pointy red hat, a beard and a red shirt.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:17.920]  Sorry.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.280]  Well, is it too late for you and your daughter
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.600]  to go skiing?
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.120]  It's only 1.20 right now.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960]  She doesn't get out for another hour.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.760]  So if there's questions and stuff,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.360]  people wanna have discussion, I'd love to.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.520]  If that's all we've got for now,
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.960]  I've got plenty of work to do.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.240]  That's all I really had in my notes that I can think of.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.680]  I hope I didn't offend anybody,
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.120]  cause I know I always do.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:45.960]  But.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.480]  I think it's funny,
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:52.000]  cause my biggest takeaway from what you said
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.200]  is we all have different definitions for things.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.480]  That's okay.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.440]  As long as we clear that up at the beginning,
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.280]  we don't get into arguments and fights.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.800]  We're just like, hey, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.520]  This is what I mean.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.520]  What do you mean?
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.620]  We're, you know.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.080]  I had somebody on one of my little soil presentations
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.480]  of natural soil tell me,
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.080]  hey, you're gonna bring some bugs in
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080]  to your garden at some point.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.720]  I'm like, yeah, that's the point.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.240]  And then you look at his page,
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.240]  and it's like salt grower, never organic.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:34.000]  It's like, well, yeah, I guess I wasn't talking to you,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:34.840]  was I?
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.240]  But that's what I do is I teach organic
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:43.920]  and more of this more basic rudimentary cannabis
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.840]  history, science, love stuff.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.840]  I'm trying to make it go from,
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.800]  we're all in this from the scientist to the end consumer.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.720]  And that word sativa means a very different thing
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.320]  all along the spectrum.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.200]  It ain't no better than you,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.240]  because my meaning of the word sativa
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.800]  wasn't proper in the context you put it in.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.200]  Which doesn't help.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.800]  Someone pointed out we have ironically
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.080]  420 people watching right now.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.760]  Perfect.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.120]  So why don't we end on that,
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.800]  and we can always come back later.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.640]  Cool.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.320]  I got a whole lot of shit to pack up.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.200]  And hopefully some patient people on the other end.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.040]  Cool, I got some seeds to go out to.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.640]  And all right, well, thank you everyone.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:42.640]  And yeah, we'll regroup with Indian Land Race Exchange,
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.120]  possibly next Tuesday, possibly tomorrow.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.640]  Not sure quite what day.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.400]  Maybe we'll try a different time slot
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.000]  to make sure you're still awake.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.800]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.640]  Appreciate you all.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.120]  Thanks for listening, watching,
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.240]  and having a great discussion, and go on.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.720]  All right, thanks everyone.
