[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  He's asking, what's the major differences between the Northern Lights cuts you hold
[00:04.080 --> 00:06.720]  because they're all named with numerics.
[00:06.720 --> 00:14.850]  What's the significance of that and what does it mean to you and how you use them?
[00:14.850 --> 00:17.730]  So that's a very good question.
[00:17.730 --> 00:22.770]  So we would really need the guys here that originally bred the Northern Lights strains
[00:22.770 --> 00:24.450]  to answer all these questions.
[00:24.730 --> 00:32.410]  From what I've read and understand and what I've heard through the cannabis culture is
[00:32.410 --> 00:36.290]  Northern Lights number one is the pure form.
[00:36.290 --> 00:46.450]  Two, three were crossed to Indica's and L5, six, seven, eight, nine were crossed to Sativa's
[00:46.450 --> 00:48.010]  to hybridize.
[00:48.530 --> 00:53.930]  And L5 has the best bag peel and the best marketable bud.
[00:53.930 --> 01:05.610]  And L2 has the strongest, most Indica, a lot of juniper, just real cush smell.
[01:05.610 --> 01:10.450]  Northern Lights number one is the backbone of all the other ones.
[01:10.450 --> 01:12.850]  You can smell it in there.
[01:12.850 --> 01:14.170]  It was the building block.
[01:14.170 --> 01:17.810]  That's what Neville used.
[01:17.810 --> 01:22.330]  If he had a clone and he wanted to recreate that clone, that was the male he used.
[01:22.330 --> 01:28.290]  When he wanted to make a pure hash plant off the hash plant cutting, he back crossed off
[01:28.290 --> 01:30.130]  of the Northern Lights number one.
[01:30.130 --> 01:36.010]  When he wanted to bring big bud to the market and he just had the big bud clone, he back
[01:36.010 --> 01:40.330]  crossed off of Northern Lights number one.
[01:40.330 --> 01:41.610]  It's a real building block.
[01:41.610 --> 01:46.650]  As far as by itself, it's great smoke, but it doesn't have the bag appeal.
