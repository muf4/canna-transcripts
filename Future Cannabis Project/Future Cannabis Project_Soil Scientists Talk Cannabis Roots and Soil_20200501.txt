[00:00.000 --> 00:04.420]  So, all right, this is what we are talking about.
[00:04.420 --> 00:08.600]  And then let me cut back to me, and there I am.
[00:08.600 --> 00:09.800]  So thanks for joining us.
[00:09.800 --> 00:17.520]  We're talking pesticides and analytical testing, among other topics, with Scott, Sarah, Lydia,
[00:17.520 --> 00:23.160]  Eric, Kevin Jodry is probably going to come on a little late.
[00:23.160 --> 00:26.880]  So why don't we kick it off with Scott.
[00:26.880 --> 00:37.080]  Talk about when he crossed paths with Lydia and what her area of domain expertise is that
[00:37.080 --> 00:38.080]  you respect.
[00:38.080 --> 00:39.080]  Yeah.
[00:39.080 --> 00:46.880]  Yeah, I can't even remember where we first met Lydia, but we've crossed paths a few times
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.160]  at like the Emerald Cup.
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.480]  We've spoken at events that she's also spoken at.
[00:53.480 --> 00:59.540]  There was one particular presentation that Lydia did when she had her industry counterparts
[00:59.540 --> 01:03.160]  up there, and you could tell who was prepared and who wasn't prepared.
[01:03.160 --> 01:10.760]  So I respect that Lydia always prepares and brings the seriousness, which I appreciate.
[01:10.760 --> 01:16.000]  Sarah and I tried to hold a certain level of analytical accountability within the industry
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.080]  because I feel that that's a major gap.
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.560]  I just based on what I've seen of Lydia's work that she is after the same goal, I'd
[01:24.560 --> 01:25.560]  say.
[01:25.560 --> 01:27.060]  So that's what I appreciate.
[01:27.060 --> 01:29.840]  So I just I'm mostly just curious.
[01:29.840 --> 01:34.840]  You know, I know a tiny sprinkling of what she's seen come through that lab.
[01:34.840 --> 01:41.080]  And I'm really fascinated by some of the studies that Stiepel did several years back trying
[01:41.080 --> 01:46.040]  to warn the market of what was coming and how contaminated their environment actually
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  was.
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.040]  I don't know how much she can talk about what, so I'm sure she knows how to manage that discretion.
[01:52.040 --> 01:59.200]  But I'm just kind of interested like what the regional issues are or what are the common
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.720]  consistent tripping points that everybody seems to be experiencing that nobody wants
[02:02.720 --> 02:03.840]  to talk about.
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.320]  That's the hardest part about our job.
[02:07.320 --> 02:12.520]  So yeah, I'm just mostly interested of, you know, what her world and experience has been
[02:12.520 --> 02:14.440]  of the last couple of years.
[02:16.440 --> 02:17.800]  I'll just I'll just leap in.
[02:17.800 --> 02:22.320]  So what I've noticed and seen within the industry is I'm sure the exact same thing that you've
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.600]  seen and you were commenting on privately earlier is that, you know, a lot of the products
[02:26.600 --> 02:32.360]  that are OMRI listed, a lot of the chemical pesticides that are invited for use by, you
[02:32.360 --> 02:37.720]  know, different state agricultures, you know, different parts of different departments of
[02:37.720 --> 02:41.080]  pesticide regulation that, you know, they're not necessarily clean.
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.080]  And so we're having people that, you know, not only are introducing chemicals to an already
[02:45.080 --> 02:51.480]  contaminated environment, but they are unknowingly doing this and it's causing them testing
[02:51.480 --> 02:53.880]  failures and they can't get their product to market.
[02:53.880 --> 02:54.880]  Right.
[02:54.880 --> 02:55.880]  Which we all know.
[02:55.880 --> 03:00.120]  And then a few years ago when Steepl did their clean clones study, they were driving all
[03:00.120 --> 03:04.840]  up and down the state, picking up clones from different locations and then testing the leaf
[03:04.840 --> 03:08.320]  tissue for presence of pesticide residues.
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.680]  And they found out that even if you're growing plants up to a fairly large, you know, fairly
[03:13.680 --> 03:18.280]  large size in vegetative growth and then taking cuttings, you're going to be going
[03:18.280 --> 03:23.080]  through multiple successions, multiple generations of cuttings to get to the point where you're
[03:23.080 --> 03:28.800]  actually diluting the amount of pesticide that's in the leaf tissue before it negatively
[03:28.800 --> 03:33.180]  affects your flower on the, you know, on the product end.
[03:33.180 --> 03:39.800]  So what I've seen in cannabis in California specifically is, you know, the presence of
[03:39.800 --> 03:45.480]  those really, really persistent chemicals that were used in cut flower greenhouses.
[03:45.480 --> 03:50.880]  You know, we all know those four individuals that work in counties that require them to
[03:50.880 --> 03:54.920]  refurbish, reuse old cut flower greenhouses.
[03:54.920 --> 04:02.000]  And, you know, they've got chlorpyrifos, chlordane, all sorts of other chemicals that are just
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.240]  going to stay around in the soil, going to stay around in their wooden greenhouse that
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.680]  they never place.
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.760]  And they don't clean and they can't, you know, paint over.
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.660]  And so we're just, you know, they don't wipe down the fans, you know, there's such a huge
[04:14.660 --> 04:19.120]  push in the industry normally when you get into a new facility is to immediately start
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.080]  going as quickly as you can.
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.240]  And you, we all know that preparation will save you so much stress and anxiety on the
[04:26.240 --> 04:27.240]  back end.
[04:27.240 --> 04:29.800]  So that's kind of what I've seen a lot of.
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.560]  We've also seen different counties where cultivation is not allowed.
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.680]  You know, the industry is really not welcome there, even in California, you know.
[04:38.680 --> 04:43.440]  And so there have been low key studies that we've done in conjunction with groups of growers
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.120]  in different counties to try to prove that the product that they will be bringing to
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.880]  market would be clean.
[04:48.880 --> 04:52.680]  You know, and we hear guys that are swearing left and right, they've never used micro,
[04:52.680 --> 04:55.840]  they've never used certain types of pesticides that are really common within the industry
[04:55.840 --> 05:01.120]  or really common in agriculture in California in general.
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.040]  And then it comes back that, you know, most of them are clean, most of the samples are
[05:05.040 --> 05:10.240]  clean and some are dirty, some will get hits, you know, and that variation isn't really
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.160]  something that you can take to a city council meeting and say, hey, you know, we're mostly
[05:14.160 --> 05:17.400]  clean because they just don't want to hear it.
[05:17.400 --> 05:21.280]  You know, they're so biased against cannabis already that they're just not going to let
[05:21.280 --> 05:22.460]  it come forward.
[05:22.460 --> 05:27.480]  So that's what I've been seeing a lot of and helping people figure out where their contamination
[05:27.480 --> 05:29.520]  points are coming from.
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.760]  And, you know, again, testing at the beginning, getting in a good relationship with your lab,
[05:34.760 --> 05:42.200]  understanding what their LOD, LOQ, instrumentation capacity, analytic capacity is will help you
[05:42.200 --> 05:48.720]  in the long run is what I've seen since that Emerald Cup 2017 panel with the Department
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.400]  of Pesticide Regulation, Josh Wurzer from SC Labs, Eric actually was the one that was
[05:53.400 --> 06:02.040]  running the mic and then Ron Whitehurst at Rincon Vitova, who's spectacular as well.
[06:02.040 --> 06:08.260]  So that's what I see.
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.260]  That's great.
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.260]  Fantastic.
[06:10.260 --> 06:13.660]  Our mics are muted and we're talking, but they're muted.
[06:13.660 --> 06:16.220]  So it just looks awkward.
[06:16.220 --> 06:21.220]  But essentially what you're saying is, there's like 10 other things that can trip up a farmer
[06:21.220 --> 06:26.420]  going to regulated cannabis that they haven't even heard about yet.
[06:26.740 --> 06:27.740]  Yeah.
[06:27.740 --> 06:32.020]  I think one of the most interesting things that I heard of is like how persistent some
[06:32.020 --> 06:37.220]  of these compounds are in ducting of air conditioning systems or in drywall.
[06:37.220 --> 06:42.580]  And that when the temperature and the humidity in the cultivation space goes up, they what,
[06:42.580 --> 06:47.500]  re-volatilize or whatever the word is, they go back into the air, settle on your flowers
[06:47.500 --> 06:48.940]  and now you fail testing.
[06:48.940 --> 06:53.020]  And, you know, I think unfortunately there's so many situations where everybody at the
[06:53.020 --> 06:58.260]  facility is claiming clean and then someone's sneaking in at 2am and actually spraying systemic
[06:58.260 --> 07:03.300]  fungicides or other pesticides that like, when you start to present these other, what
[07:03.300 --> 07:09.580]  sound like far out scenarios of compounds persisting in the air conditioning or in the
[07:09.580 --> 07:15.220]  walls, for example, people then think that's more kooky than someone sneaking in at 2am
[07:15.220 --> 07:19.940]  and just using it or the neighbors using or something more nefarious, which I think is
[07:19.940 --> 07:25.500]  interesting to me that less people seem to believe that that these compounds were persist
[07:25.500 --> 07:30.540]  in the building itself than a neighbor spraying them or a friend brought it in or somebody
[07:30.540 --> 07:31.540]  in the facility is doing it.
[07:31.540 --> 07:33.820]  And that's pretty interesting mentality mindset.
[07:35.100 --> 07:40.540]  So it's funny that you say that, because what we have seen greenhouses, you know, large
[07:40.540 --> 07:44.340]  acre greenhouses that are under glass, you know, they're fairly controlled.
[07:44.340 --> 07:49.420]  I mean, they still have vents and all sorts of wet walls and all that sort of stuff.
[07:49.420 --> 07:53.540]  But, you know, we've definitely seen, you know, the strawberry grower next door spraying
[07:53.540 --> 07:57.300]  something, avocado grower, you know, and that there's just pesticide drift.
[07:57.300 --> 07:58.620]  We've absolutely seen that happen.
[07:58.620 --> 08:02.700]  They've a lot of these places, excuse me, have a 24 hour security.
[08:03.100 --> 08:05.820]  You know, you can't you got to have your security system.
[08:05.820 --> 08:08.620]  You got to have everybody that works for your team.
[08:08.940 --> 08:10.020]  And so they'll watch.
[08:10.220 --> 08:13.940]  And it's actually the impetus is on the crop duster.
[08:13.940 --> 08:15.180]  It's not on the next door neighbor.
[08:15.220 --> 08:19.380]  It's on the crop duster to know that they're not, you know, spraying in a situation where
[08:19.380 --> 08:21.060]  they're going to be causing an issue with drift.
[08:21.420 --> 08:27.180]  And then I do agree with you that there is a large portion of population that they don't
[08:27.180 --> 08:31.340]  realize what they're spraying and the persistence of the chemical in cannabis because
[08:31.340 --> 08:35.980]  they're reading a label that's not ever been studied for, you know, for cannabis use
[08:35.980 --> 08:39.940]  that, you know, it says pre-harvest interval for this pyrethrin.
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.620]  You're going to have totally no problem.
[08:41.620 --> 08:46.900]  And I recently talked to a client, which is no disrespect to anyone, but I recently
[08:46.900 --> 08:50.820]  talked to a client in a different state that's, you know, more new to the industry.
[08:50.820 --> 08:54.900]  And they were saying that they were having, you know, they were going to buy hygienic
[08:55.500 --> 08:56.740]  and that they were going to spray hygienic.
[08:56.740 --> 08:58.620]  And I was like, this is not something that we are doing.
[08:58.620 --> 09:03.100]  And and then we started having a discussion about, you know, synthetic versus
[09:03.100 --> 09:08.380]  naturally occurring pyrethrins and pyrethroids and what can be used and what can't
[09:08.380 --> 09:14.460]  be used and the differences in the action limits by state and how that affects, you
[09:14.460 --> 09:17.660]  know, the cultural knowledge, because everybody, you know, this we all watched it
[09:17.660 --> 09:21.860]  happen. Everybody was following Colorado and then it was Washington and Oregon.
[09:22.100 --> 09:23.420]  And now it's California.
[09:23.420 --> 09:26.940]  And it's like, you know, California is the we're doing what they always do and
[09:26.940 --> 09:32.220]  hyper-controlling everything to what we have no idea to what benefit or not.
[09:33.220 --> 09:39.580]  But I do find a very small portion of the population and you know it and I know it.
[09:40.140 --> 09:43.500]  Once you have a conversation with someone well enough to realize that you're not there to
[09:43.500 --> 09:47.740]  be their hall monitor and you're there to help them figure out what their problem is and
[09:47.940 --> 09:51.420]  whatever you used to do, it's completely fine as long as we have an honest
[09:51.420 --> 09:55.420]  conversation. I'll often find that people it's maybe about half and half.
[09:55.500 --> 09:59.980]  Someone sprayed something they didn't realize was either like adulterated or with
[09:59.980 --> 10:03.380]  another pesticide or they didn't realize it was going to stay around in their plant
[10:03.380 --> 10:05.300]  material and cause a fail.
[10:05.300 --> 10:07.460]  And you normally only have to learn that lesson once.
[10:07.860 --> 10:10.940]  But it's definitely a case where it does persist in the environment.
[10:10.940 --> 10:14.700]  And these are chemicals that we know that that's the situation because they were the
[10:14.700 --> 10:17.580]  stop sale for them was in the 70s and the 80s.
[10:17.580 --> 10:22.340]  So like it's not like these chemicals are readily available at a hydro store.
[10:22.700 --> 10:26.220]  And so people aren't picking up chemicals and going from there.
[10:27.060 --> 10:29.260]  So that's just something to think about, too, that I've been seeing.
[10:30.980 --> 10:37.300]  And there's when you were talking about the other state, I thought of in Nevada, when
[10:37.300 --> 10:42.020]  they first started going, they had like a green, yellow, red strategy for different
[10:42.020 --> 10:43.260]  compounds and pesticides.
[10:43.260 --> 10:45.740]  It had like different clearance rate times or what have you.
[10:45.740 --> 10:52.140]  And there was a facility that we were working with that had a lead grower make the
[10:52.140 --> 10:55.700]  decision to do pyrethrin bombs on the whole facility at once.
[10:55.700 --> 11:00.780]  And it was the week when pyrethrins went from yellow to red or something like that.
[11:00.780 --> 11:06.460]  It changed one block the same week that they did something that might have worked last
[11:06.460 --> 11:09.300]  week, which now caused a six month facility reset.
[11:09.300 --> 11:12.540]  It was a pretty wild scenario.
[11:13.060 --> 11:14.300]  Just trying to navigate that.
[11:14.660 --> 11:18.620]  I haven't been following along if California is taking a strategy like that, but
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.260]  they're not. Yeah, it's pretty hard and fast.
[11:22.260 --> 11:24.780]  No, no, no. You know California, they over-regulate.
[11:24.820 --> 11:27.900]  And that's how they keep everybody controlled enough so that the large...
[11:28.620 --> 11:32.460]  Anyway, it's not what you see happening in Colorado, where they come in with like
[11:32.460 --> 11:36.700]  relaxed rules because they're trying to get the industry started.
[11:36.700 --> 11:38.860]  And then you see like what happened in Colorado.
[11:38.860 --> 11:43.300]  And then by absolute complete opposite comparison, you have California, which is
[11:43.300 --> 11:46.380]  like, you know, 64, 66 pesticides.
[11:46.740 --> 11:49.060]  We're looking for different isomers.
[11:49.060 --> 11:53.380]  They're, you know, the type of analytical equipment, the level to which they're
[11:53.380 --> 11:59.980]  looking, the validation that's required by the state for a analytical third party
[11:59.980 --> 12:04.820]  testing laboratory to operate in the legal cannabis space is like more so intense
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.180]  than, you know, ISO accreditations.
[12:07.500 --> 12:13.140]  So the level of requirement of repeatability and just the minutia of looking at all
[12:13.140 --> 12:17.900]  of this is so, I mean, it's the same thing as when you're looking for, you know,
[12:17.940 --> 12:23.780]  biologicals and you do broad quality indicator tests and you can't use biofungicides,
[12:23.780 --> 12:27.500]  you know, or you have some issue there as opposed to looking directly only for E.
[12:27.500 --> 12:31.380]  coli, you know, things of that nature is what we're seeing.
[12:31.380 --> 12:34.820]  But and then again, actually something that's being mentioned in the comments right
[12:34.820 --> 12:39.780]  now is that once you figure out what the problem is, most people do have a difficulty
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.460]  in cleaning their equipment, whether it's like actually having a difficulty in
[12:44.500 --> 12:48.580]  cleaning it or just cleaning it is technical.
[12:49.100 --> 12:52.420]  Right. So we get residues from there, too.
[12:52.780 --> 12:58.300]  Yeah. Somebody is asking, that takes a lot of brainpower to listen to you, follow along
[12:58.300 --> 13:00.140]  and read the comments on the side.
[13:00.140 --> 13:01.980]  I'm like, whoa, got one eye.
[13:03.020 --> 13:06.380]  But one of the questions is what's a pyrethrin bomb?
[13:07.300 --> 13:11.580]  Pyrethrin is a compound found in what the chrysanthemum.
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.980]  And then it's in a fogger.
[13:13.980 --> 13:19.020]  So like a bed bug bomb from back in the day, we'd go throw it in there like a
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.300]  military guy, pull the cap and the fog comes out.
[13:22.100 --> 13:24.300]  It was fun. Bed bug.
[13:24.300 --> 13:27.820]  And the premise that, oh, sorry, I was going to say the premise that works behind
[13:27.820 --> 13:32.140]  them is like, you know, when you're spraying a liquid, we're talking you got into
[13:32.140 --> 13:35.580]  droplet size and paint sprayers recently, which I adore.
[13:36.700 --> 13:38.100]  And so I'm not going to go into that.
[13:38.100 --> 13:43.020]  But, you know, when you're using a fogging system, it's those cracks and crevices and
[13:43.020 --> 13:44.180]  all the nooks and crannies.
[13:44.180 --> 13:47.220]  And that's like the cell for a fogging system or a bomb.
[13:47.220 --> 13:53.740]  They do. It's a similar kind of premise to burning sulfur, which is illegal in most
[13:53.740 --> 13:56.380]  cannabis legally producing states.
[13:57.140 --> 14:01.660]  So, yeah, a pyrethrin bomb is just, you know, just like you would do if you were
[14:01.860 --> 14:05.460]  trying to get rid of bed bugs or other types of infestations in your house where,
[14:05.460 --> 14:08.260]  you know, you tarp everything down and you let it go.
[14:08.380 --> 14:12.900]  What you got in Southern California, just quickly, is pyrethrin the thing that like
[14:12.900 --> 14:17.900]  slices apart the exoskeleton of the bugs or is that something else?
[14:20.020 --> 14:21.700]  That's not my area of expertise.
[14:21.900 --> 14:23.900]  I don't know. Yeah.
[14:24.220 --> 14:31.300]  I defer. I think it could be interesting because recently Eric was working in
[14:31.300 --> 14:33.300]  distribution and procurement of trim.
[14:33.700 --> 14:37.340]  I think it could be really interesting to see the patterns that are being used.
[14:37.460 --> 14:43.460]  The patterns that Eric was seen bounced off of Lydia's same experience with these
[14:43.460 --> 14:47.540]  compounds, because there was like a like when I was just personally checking in with
[14:47.540 --> 14:50.780]  Eric, there was like almost like a compound of the week.
[14:50.780 --> 14:55.780]  It felt like there was three common compounds that were found in all the problems.
[14:56.340 --> 14:58.260]  And then there seemed to be like regional trends.
[14:58.260 --> 15:03.020]  I'm always fascinated by like, you know, what are the regional detects?
[15:03.020 --> 15:05.540]  Because people just do what their neighbors in their region do.
[15:06.260 --> 15:09.820]  So I don't know if there's any sort of correlation or if it's all across the board or
[15:09.820 --> 15:14.260]  is it like, you know, because I think that should be considered for the Appalachians
[15:14.260 --> 15:16.340]  consideration, myself and Terroir.
[15:16.820 --> 15:19.460]  Like we're using pesticides by region.
[15:19.460 --> 15:21.460]  That's a little side digression.
[15:21.460 --> 15:26.740]  But nonetheless, I don't know if Eric's out there to comment.
[15:28.940 --> 15:29.820]  Can you hear me now?
[15:30.500 --> 15:34.820]  OK, yeah, well, some areas are more contaminated than others.
[15:34.820 --> 15:40.580]  Like in Salinas Valley, for instance, some of the there weren't backflow prevention
[15:40.580 --> 15:43.500]  devices required until about 20 years ago.
[15:43.780 --> 15:48.700]  And chlorodane was outlawed 30 years ago and people still pop for chlorodane right now.
[15:49.060 --> 15:55.100]  And so, you know, there's a lot of contamination in regular ag that now is hard to
[15:55.100 --> 15:56.940]  keep out in some of these areas.
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.580]  And RO doesn't always do it.
[15:59.500 --> 16:04.100]  And then you have the other pesticide companies where dilution is the solution.
[16:04.100 --> 16:08.900]  I know one of them when I was chasing around the trim, there was people in the north and
[16:08.900 --> 16:13.940]  the south popping for malathion and no one knew where this malathion was coming from.
[16:13.940 --> 16:18.260]  But not too long after that, Oregon, I think it was Oregon Department of Ag or
[16:18.260 --> 16:23.700]  Washington found a couple of name companies or one name company with five products that
[16:23.700 --> 16:25.020]  had malathion in it.
[16:25.540 --> 16:27.940]  So it was a little sneaky on that part.
[16:27.940 --> 16:31.980]  But, you know, these detects and fails come from all sorts of shit.
[16:32.980 --> 16:36.980]  Well, then you talk about regional procurement of clones, right?
[16:36.980 --> 16:40.220]  And if somebody is like spraying their moms and their clone population, I can't tell you how
[16:40.220 --> 16:44.140]  many times I go in a facility and they bring in fresh clones from wherever and they already
[16:44.140 --> 16:49.420]  have some sort of like very clear virus disease, thrips, infestation issue.
[16:49.420 --> 16:53.980]  And like if I can see disease and pests on your plant, like it's real obvious to me that you
[16:53.980 --> 17:01.060]  came from a dirty environment and using those more industrial pesticides, especially with
[17:01.820 --> 17:03.140]  the recalls that you were talking about.
[17:03.140 --> 17:07.660]  If anybody's interested, the Oregon Department of Ag is amazing.
[17:07.780 --> 17:11.820]  You know, they're really on top of their game about doing the recalls and telling people
[17:11.820 --> 17:16.220]  that their business, you know what their business is, which is really helpful because I'm
[17:16.220 --> 17:18.740]  not even going to bother in the name of companies because if anybody Googled it, they
[17:18.740 --> 17:21.620]  could easily find the recalls that the ODA put out.
[17:21.620 --> 17:24.300]  But, you know, I hear you.
[17:24.300 --> 17:27.780]  I'm sure that that's what you're seeing, too, Eric, because everybody listens to what their
[17:27.980 --> 17:32.260]  buddy knows. I mean, that's still a rampant industry behavior, whether their buddy is a
[17:32.260 --> 17:36.300]  pesticide broker or somebody that they've known for 20 years.
[17:36.300 --> 17:40.260]  Like there's a lot of communal knowledge that's shared in the industry.
[17:40.260 --> 17:42.260]  And when a product works, people talk about it.
[17:42.260 --> 17:46.580]  And if it works because it's adulterated, everybody's in trouble.
[17:47.940 --> 17:52.180]  Well, and that's the problem, too, of chasing these aphids, they survive or get stronger
[17:52.180 --> 17:53.620]  with some of this stuff over time.
[17:53.620 --> 17:57.940]  And there's only so many things you can use in cannabis to try to defeat some of these
[17:57.940 --> 18:03.420]  pests. And it's getting tougher and tougher to, you know, defeat some of these
[18:03.420 --> 18:08.580]  infestations. When these infestations, especially the aphids, it's like I mean, it's
[18:08.580 --> 18:14.140]  unbelievable. And I've been seeing on the threads from Instagram that it's pretty heavy
[18:14.140 --> 18:15.340]  up in Humboldt this year.
[18:15.340 --> 18:18.780]  And so it's not like it's just one area safer than another.
[18:18.780 --> 18:24.700]  The nurseries in general create a lot of these so-called problems and they get
[18:24.700 --> 18:26.340]  proliferated throughout these farms.
[18:26.340 --> 18:31.220]  And if the farms don't know what to do about it, it just becomes a long battle for the
[18:31.220 --> 18:31.940]  whole season.
[18:33.340 --> 18:37.500]  And you were mentioning last I watched last week, sir, the week before it was workflow,
[18:38.020 --> 18:39.780]  you know, who's designing these facilities?
[18:39.780 --> 18:43.980]  You know, it's certainly not the people necessarily that are they're paying attention
[18:43.980 --> 18:47.620]  to the workflow of the whole situation.
[18:47.660 --> 18:50.380]  You got your soil or your substrate stored somewhere.
[18:50.660 --> 18:52.140]  It's not in a clean environment.
[18:52.140 --> 18:57.380]  You know, you're not regularly disinfecting or cleaning the whole space and then
[18:57.820 --> 19:01.940]  trying to determine where your problem's coming from when I can just like watch it
[19:02.140 --> 19:05.060]  travel across a whole a whole building.
[19:05.060 --> 19:06.660]  I know you know what that's about.
[19:07.340 --> 19:12.140]  Well, it's hard to realize or it's a tough concept to wrap your head around sometimes
[19:12.140 --> 19:16.180]  because they're so small, they're so tiny and sometimes it's easy to take stuff for
[19:16.180 --> 19:21.860]  granted. But eventually these things, you know, get wings and take flight and stick to
[19:21.860 --> 19:24.900]  all kinds of shit. And so it's really hard to see.
[19:24.900 --> 19:28.340]  And the funny thing is, is that they start out at such a small size.
[19:28.340 --> 19:34.260]  And so if you're not going through greenhouses with, you know, if somebody isn't
[19:34.260 --> 19:39.220]  really scoping things with just one of these basic little, you know, jeweler scopes or
[19:39.220 --> 19:44.740]  whatever they call it, it's you know, our eyes just don't see it quick enough.
[19:44.820 --> 19:49.860]  And so you really have to scope, you know, up to 30 or 40 leaves of clones coming in
[19:49.860 --> 19:52.860]  before you actually find a little nymph or whatever they're called.
[19:52.860 --> 19:56.900]  And if you find one of those, you know, it's safe to say that you're in a little bit of
[19:56.900 --> 20:01.740]  trouble. You like, I mean, all it takes is one of those little tiny things to cause a big
[20:01.740 --> 20:07.500]  problem. And so when clones come in, you know, some of the facilities I'm at and trying
[20:07.500 --> 20:12.940]  to help or work with it, you know, scoping is, you know, or scouting is a huge part of
[20:12.940 --> 20:17.260]  the deal. And it honestly is something that I didn't realize how big of a part of the
[20:17.260 --> 20:22.020]  process it really is and how sneaky some of these little bugs are.
[20:22.380 --> 20:27.220]  Because like Scott was saying in the last one, too, is the way that they spray, the way
[20:27.220 --> 20:31.140]  that these bugs are able to go tuck themselves up under the underside of the leaf right
[20:31.140 --> 20:33.340]  against the stem material.
[20:33.340 --> 20:38.780]  And so the sprays and the washes and even some of the dips sometimes can pass right over
[20:38.780 --> 20:40.220]  the top of these little buggers.
[20:40.220 --> 20:42.180]  And it's frightening.
[20:43.940 --> 20:49.660]  Oh, yeah, I can completely commiserate that that experience is what a lot of people have.
[20:49.660 --> 20:53.820]  And then additionally, exactly like what you say is the operations that I've seen be most
[20:53.820 --> 20:58.420]  successful are the ones that have an established IBM team, you know, integrated pest
[20:58.420 --> 21:02.420]  management. You got somebody that really knows their business, somebody that is has
[21:02.660 --> 21:08.460]  experience in the type of cultivation that you're doing and also the size, right,
[21:08.460 --> 21:11.740]  outdoor versus indoor, you know, five thousand versus multiple acres, five thousand
[21:11.740 --> 21:15.820]  square feet versus multiple acres and someone that can really lead a team and educate
[21:15.820 --> 21:17.100]  people to do this work.
[21:17.100 --> 21:22.340]  Because especially in California, you know, there's a historic agricultural worker
[21:22.340 --> 21:27.300]  community and they're all completely capable of learning new crops if we have people
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.340]  that are competent to teach them crops.
[21:29.660 --> 21:33.940]  And so once you get into the habit of really scouting and looking around, understanding
[21:33.940 --> 21:37.860]  how to use sticky traps, understanding banker plants and companion plants and trap
[21:37.860 --> 21:43.740]  plants and what's your capacity as a facility and kind of finding your own, you know,
[21:44.020 --> 21:48.620]  lockstep, figuring out a way to work it out so that you're not wasting too much time,
[21:48.620 --> 21:53.460]  wasting money and and producing a really terrible product or something that's just
[21:53.460 --> 21:57.940]  giving you stress and you're losing all your hair constantly from the anxiety that
[21:57.940 --> 21:59.060]  you're dealing with.
[22:00.300 --> 22:02.260]  That's something that I've noticed.
[22:02.740 --> 22:07.140]  Well, and people throw around a lot of what they use or what they use, but not everybody
[22:07.140 --> 22:10.340]  has the same problems across the board at the same levels.
[22:10.340 --> 22:14.500]  And so there are a few products that are able to use out there.
[22:14.500 --> 22:19.940]  But how you use them, when you use them, how often and a lot of farms here, oh, they're
[22:19.940 --> 22:21.060]  using that for this.
[22:21.060 --> 22:25.060]  But what is the level of infestation or what is the level of problems that we're dealing
[22:25.060 --> 22:30.380]  with? And, you know, I just went to a farm today and, you know, was talking to some
[22:30.380 --> 22:34.140]  other people and it's like this rotation of different things that they use.
[22:34.140 --> 22:39.020]  But, you know, who can there's only a few people out there that are quantifying the
[22:39.020 --> 22:40.820]  death rate on some of these things.
[22:40.820 --> 22:44.420]  And it sucks because, you know, pyganic works really good on aphids.
[22:44.420 --> 22:50.900]  But but, you know, other products like I don't want to, you know, I don't want to say,
[22:50.900 --> 22:52.740]  you know, products and get into it right now.
[22:52.740 --> 22:57.900]  But there's some people really believe that I think the aphids drink that shit and get
[22:57.900 --> 23:03.900]  stronger. They're like Popeye with spinach, you know, and and unfortunately, you know,
[23:03.900 --> 23:08.300]  I mean, they work good for PM and late harvest rinses and things like that.
[23:08.300 --> 23:14.020]  But to really fight the aphids like, you know, for instance, you know, unfortunately,
[23:14.020 --> 23:17.140]  pure crop one isn't going to solve your aphid problem.
[23:17.140 --> 23:21.780]  They'll solve a lot of other things, but they're not going to solve the aphid problem to
[23:21.780 --> 23:23.100]  throw one product out there.
[23:23.100 --> 23:24.620]  And I'm not throwing it under the bus.
[23:24.620 --> 23:30.700]  I'm just saying don't plant your flag in aphid management with, you know, that
[23:30.700 --> 23:34.540]  particular product, let's say, you know, might be good in a rotation, but I wouldn't
[23:34.540 --> 23:40.980]  single it out on that fighting for the aphids only if I'm, you know, hopefully I don't
[23:40.980 --> 23:42.500]  get blasted too hard for that.
[23:44.380 --> 23:48.580]  Well, different modes of action is where it's at, you know, tank mixes is where it's at
[23:48.780 --> 23:53.940]  using surfactants, you know, talking about mentioning Scott and talking about the
[23:53.940 --> 23:59.500]  topography of a cannabis plant and all the nooks and crannies and using, you know,
[23:59.500 --> 24:04.700]  using the wrong type of sprayer applicator, using something that doesn't have a like a
[24:04.700 --> 24:07.780]  mixing tank, like all of that's going to inhibit capacity.
[24:07.780 --> 24:13.620]  I've seen a lot of people go from, you know, spraying way more often, much more
[24:13.620 --> 24:18.620]  aggressive to using like less chemicals and cleaning up their facility just by using the
[24:18.620 --> 24:21.780]  right sprayer. And frankly, with the cannabis aphid, I mean, a large part of it is
[24:21.780 --> 24:27.220]  sanitation. And I'm not saying that people that have, you know, have the aphid are dirty
[24:27.220 --> 24:30.180]  facilities because that's overgeneralization.
[24:30.180 --> 24:34.660]  But it is a huge issue that I have noticed there, you know, just like when you release a
[24:34.660 --> 24:37.020]  ton of ladybugs and then they all just die in the crop.
[24:37.020 --> 24:41.140]  It's a very similar looking thing when you have an infestation of cannabis aphid or
[24:41.140 --> 24:43.700]  bang aphid. There are dead little bodies everywhere.
[24:43.700 --> 24:48.980]  You know, it just looks like soils all over the all over the greenhouse when, in fact,
[24:48.980 --> 24:50.820]  it's, you know, the dead bodies of bugs.
[24:50.820 --> 24:52.460]  So, yeah.
[24:52.460 --> 24:57.420]  And there's a lot of facilities that say they're clean, but they spray every fucking day
[24:57.420 --> 25:01.020]  something. And that's a problem, too, because the plants are stressed.
[25:01.020 --> 25:03.180]  You can tell they're shlacked with oil.
[25:03.180 --> 25:08.060]  And it's really hard to see the trichomes or to see the resin rails or, you know, anything
[25:08.060 --> 25:09.380]  coming outside of the plant.
[25:09.380 --> 25:12.180]  You really have to break it open to see, oh, it's inside.
[25:12.180 --> 25:15.780]  You know, there's it's going to get you stoned if you get inside there.
[25:15.780 --> 25:19.860]  But from the outside looking in, it's just kind of like, you know, a little oily.
[25:19.860 --> 25:23.140]  So there are people that are clean, but they spray every day.
[25:23.140 --> 25:27.700]  And even though they're clean, their cannabis is kind of like on that mids level from being
[25:27.700 --> 25:29.260]  sprayed every day.
[25:29.260 --> 25:33.380]  You know, you can't. That's the other part of the whole process, too, is that the plants
[25:33.380 --> 25:36.140]  can't handle. They might be OK.
[25:36.140 --> 25:38.020]  I don't know. The word handle is one thing.
[25:38.020 --> 25:44.060]  But, you know, come out of it being top shelf is is really the the problem.
[25:44.060 --> 25:45.220]  It won't be top shelf.
[25:45.220 --> 25:49.460]  You have to spray every single day, even every other day.
[25:49.500 --> 25:52.100]  Yeah. One of the just wanted to chime in real quick.
[25:52.100 --> 25:57.260]  One of the kind of questions that's being asked, you know, is in regard to other
[25:57.260 --> 26:02.740]  products. And I think what's actually important of what Eric and Lydia and we are
[26:02.740 --> 26:08.260]  saying is that, you know, the cultivator always focuses on the aphid and what compound
[26:08.260 --> 26:09.340]  to use to kill it.
[26:10.140 --> 26:15.700]  And there's five other layers of considerations to keep your your facility pest free.
[26:15.700 --> 26:17.060]  One of those is cleanliness.
[26:17.060 --> 26:18.660]  One of those is facility flow.
[26:19.020 --> 26:23.380]  I think one of the common things that we always see is, you know, people are moving
[26:23.380 --> 26:26.580]  into a facility that was not designed for cannabis cultivation.
[26:26.580 --> 26:28.860]  It was a warehouse or an office or something.
[26:29.420 --> 26:33.340]  And then they just chop it up to where they get the most flowering square feet without
[26:33.340 --> 26:34.940]  consideration for flows.
[26:35.740 --> 26:38.860]  How do you actually quarantine something in your facility?
[26:39.780 --> 26:43.860]  The big one you said is bringing in clones like, you know, some of these facilities are
[26:43.860 --> 26:45.180]  bringing in so many plants.
[26:45.580 --> 26:46.900]  You need an army to scout them.
[26:47.140 --> 26:49.580]  Even if you only bring it in a tray, you still need to scout them.
[26:49.580 --> 26:54.740]  But nonetheless, like a lot of the facilities that we go to don't have an actual
[26:54.940 --> 26:57.660]  functional quarantine space or process.
[26:58.020 --> 27:01.900]  They don't have functional divisions in their areas of cultivation.
[27:01.900 --> 27:06.700]  In the event they do have a pest problem, they're not able to isolate it and contain it
[27:06.700 --> 27:12.100]  to control it. And I think that might be what Lydia was talking about, about cleanliness.
[27:12.100 --> 27:15.900]  And, you know, all three of us seen the consideration with facility flow, whether we've
[27:16.180 --> 27:20.820]  gone to the homies back door grow or the largest state of the art facility.
[27:21.180 --> 27:26.380]  I mean, I can only think of like, you know, less than five cultivators we've worked with
[27:26.580 --> 27:32.020]  that had like a very diligent flow and facility movement through their building that
[27:32.220 --> 27:35.380]  could even isolate and separate pests and disease problems.
[27:37.540 --> 27:44.020]  Yeah, movement's huge and and there's a few ways to do good scouting besides using the
[27:44.020 --> 27:47.060]  jewelers thing. I mean, that's the main thing to look for those aphids.
[27:47.060 --> 27:52.220]  But, you know, there's simple ways to look for thrips by using a white piece of paper,
[27:52.220 --> 27:54.860]  hold it underneath the plant and tap the shit out of the plant.
[27:54.860 --> 27:57.020]  And if anything falls on it, it's wiggling around.
[27:57.020 --> 27:59.500]  You can easily kind of see where the thrips are.
[27:59.500 --> 28:05.140]  And so I think a lot of people avoid or don't do the scouting that needs to be done in
[28:05.140 --> 28:08.860]  first place because it takes a little bit of time and it's kind of exhausting in some
[28:08.860 --> 28:14.660]  ways. But a little bit more of it would be done, the forecasting to be able to get on
[28:14.660 --> 28:17.940]  top of some of these things and maybe use some of those products that we've mentioned
[28:17.940 --> 28:22.380]  before that would be effective, you know, if you find it early enough at the smallest
[28:22.380 --> 28:28.860]  stage. But that's the whole thing with this process is being able to set those
[28:28.860 --> 28:33.580]  protocols up and not waver from them, no matter how much of a hurry you are to get
[28:33.580 --> 28:38.860]  those clones out into the field or whatever it is, because the nurseries are doing that.
[28:38.860 --> 28:44.020]  And I'm starting to believe more and more that the viruses are passed by a lot of these
[28:44.020 --> 28:49.660]  bugs, even though I think some of the stuff that's been recorded or documented says
[28:49.660 --> 28:53.140]  otherwise. There's a couple of people online and they're looking at things.
[28:53.140 --> 28:58.780]  I just don't see how that bugs, you know, with their mouths full of sucking shit and
[28:58.780 --> 29:03.940]  going from one plant to another can't be, you know, passing on a virus.
[29:03.940 --> 29:07.020]  It's just it's disgusting to think about what they do.
[29:07.020 --> 29:12.780]  And and I think I saw I mean, I see characteristics of
[29:12.780 --> 29:16.580]  dudding more and more. And I asked farms if they've gotten the test and they say no a
[29:16.580 --> 29:20.660]  lot of times. And I think it's kind of scary to them when I do ask.
[29:20.660 --> 29:25.300]  But I think it's helpful to do the testing no matter what, even if things are looking
[29:25.300 --> 29:31.700]  good. I mean, like you say, Scott, with soil and water and Sarah, you guys say test,
[29:31.700 --> 29:35.580]  test, test every bed, every well, water, all these things.
[29:35.580 --> 29:40.540]  So we can get a pathway. And it kind of goes for the same thing now with working with all
[29:40.540 --> 29:43.500]  these nurseries and having to get the byroid testing done.
[29:45.580 --> 29:51.260]  I think one of the things that we address in IPM protocol is as
[29:51.260 --> 29:56.220]  the very first thing we address is the nutritional aspect of the plants.
[29:56.220 --> 30:01.380]  That is what's going to create the food source, the actual causality of bringing in any
[30:01.380 --> 30:06.380]  pest. And so that's that's definitely been our number one strategy.
[30:06.380 --> 30:10.060]  Of course, you can bring in all these other things, but and you don't have to necessarily
[30:10.060 --> 30:12.820]  base it on the microbiome like we do.
[30:12.820 --> 30:18.180]  You can get sound nutrition, you know, as sound as you can get based
[30:18.180 --> 30:23.060]  on in hydroponics and things like that, as long as it's, you know, nutritionally
[30:23.060 --> 30:26.340]  sound and based on that science that supports the plant's health.
[30:26.340 --> 30:28.060]  So that's that would be number one.
[30:28.060 --> 30:33.100]  That would be the glaring thing that I would say is is missing from what we've talked
[30:33.100 --> 30:35.780]  about so far. That would be number one.
[30:37.180 --> 30:42.020]  But that just comes from my two cents with a background in in health care, I'm always
[30:42.020 --> 30:47.380]  looking at causality, and so I don't like to glaze over that portion because for
[30:47.380 --> 30:50.060]  me, it's like taking a taking an antibiotic.
[30:50.060 --> 30:52.180]  Well, what caused the issue in the first place?
[30:52.180 --> 30:56.060]  And so that to me is much more effective and fascinating.
[30:56.060 --> 30:57.140]  So anyway.
[30:57.700 --> 31:02.860]  Well, yeah. And using the beneficial pests or bugs to fight a lot of these things
[31:02.860 --> 31:04.980]  can work and actually do a good job.
[31:05.740 --> 31:09.540]  But it's I'm learning a lot about the ones that chase down the aphid.
[31:09.540 --> 31:12.340]  I forget their proper name, so I'm not going to bother trying.
[31:12.340 --> 31:19.020]  But, you know, you can only apply certain things up until a certain point of flower
[31:19.020 --> 31:23.940]  because those bugs then remain on the flower cocoons and exoskeletons.
[31:23.940 --> 31:27.300]  And now we're starting to see in Lydia might be able to talk about this more.
[31:27.300 --> 31:33.580]  I'm seeing more labs failing things for filth and foreign material, I think it's
[31:33.580 --> 31:40.100]  called. And it has to do with either too many aphids left over or exoskeletons from
[31:40.140 --> 31:44.220]  the little buggers that go in there and fight it because they're dispersed too late
[31:44.220 --> 31:49.660]  into flowering. A lot of times these bugs do leave when they harvest, but there's a
[31:49.660 --> 31:53.940]  considerable amount that can be left behind either from not doing enough work to fight
[31:53.940 --> 31:55.940]  them or fighting them too hard.
[31:56.700 --> 32:00.380]  Have you guys dealt with any of that, Lydia, with the filth and foreign material on
[32:00.380 --> 32:01.380]  that end?
[32:02.700 --> 32:06.780]  So California's regulation is like a fourth of the material, like a quarter.
[32:06.820 --> 32:12.940]  And so unless it's egregious, you know, most labs are not trying to come after
[32:12.940 --> 32:16.260]  somebody for their product.
[32:16.260 --> 32:21.620]  You were saying mummified aphids and then the molted skins of the aphids, or the
[32:22.620 --> 32:26.780]  exoskeletons of the aphids being found in flowers.
[32:26.780 --> 32:31.580]  So you're talking about chasing, the beneficials chasing, that's an aureus, the
[32:31.580 --> 32:32.700]  minute pirate bug.
[32:32.900 --> 32:35.340]  And then, but again, those parasitic wasps.
[32:35.340 --> 32:41.300]  So we do see, typically it's actually it's normally like
[32:41.300 --> 32:45.740]  bud rot, you know, bud rot issues are the thing that we have seen being like a really
[32:45.740 --> 32:47.420]  big problem with filth and foreign materials.
[32:47.420 --> 32:54.060]  And I know that you heavily follow the Bureau of Cannabis Control's reasons for fail
[32:54.860 --> 32:55.940]  by week or whatever.
[32:55.940 --> 33:00.780]  And, you know, we still see the pesticides are a very, yeah, I know you still see the
[33:00.780 --> 33:04.860]  pesticides are like a very large portion of that of that problem.
[33:05.620 --> 33:08.140]  As opposed to filth and foreign materials being fairly small.
[33:08.140 --> 33:10.260]  And then what Sarah had said, I completely agree.
[33:10.260 --> 33:15.660]  I actually think that very similar to we don't understand our gut microbiology yet.
[33:15.900 --> 33:20.980]  We don't understand the microbiology of the plant, about what's going on in the soil,
[33:20.980 --> 33:25.140]  about what's going on in the on the leaf surfaces, what's happening inside, enough to
[33:25.140 --> 33:30.340]  really be able to understand exactly what necessarily triggers an infestation.
[33:30.340 --> 33:33.860]  Although I know that Scott or that you guys have done a bunch of work over aggressive
[33:33.860 --> 33:38.060]  soil to be able to determine, you know, if you're seeing this under your microscope,
[33:38.060 --> 33:41.380]  you're like, you know, this is probably attributing to a certain problem that you're
[33:41.380 --> 33:45.460]  having, which I think that research that you guys put out is fascinating.
[33:45.980 --> 33:52.900]  Thank you. Yeah, we what Lydia is referring to is, you know, in our work of doing
[33:52.900 --> 33:57.580]  microscope analysis of cannabis soils from the smallest farm to the largest farm, there
[33:57.580 --> 34:00.820]  are very consistent patterns associated with problems.
[34:01.820 --> 34:07.820]  We worked on a specific job that was 40,000 square feet, and we had to identify the
[34:07.820 --> 34:11.380]  difference between the plants that had visible mold and the plants that did not have
[34:11.380 --> 34:16.340]  visible mold. And we went through and broke up the facility into zones and we broke up
[34:16.340 --> 34:19.020]  the zones into zones so that we could, you know.
[34:19.900 --> 34:23.780]  Aggregate all the data points, and nonetheless, we spent three months monitoring this
[34:23.780 --> 34:29.220]  property and there was extremely clear lines where mold became visible on the plant and
[34:29.220 --> 34:32.020]  where mold was not visible of plants even right next to each other.
[34:32.500 --> 34:36.540]  And so, you know, we see this time and time and time and time and time again.
[34:36.540 --> 34:43.340]  There are very clear correlations between biological populations in the soil and
[34:43.340 --> 34:45.220]  various pests and disease issues.
[34:46.460 --> 34:50.180]  You know, we have more of a background in the biological side, but as a function of my
[34:50.180 --> 34:53.740]  job, I've had to also become proficient in the mineral side.
[34:54.060 --> 34:59.060]  And, you know, it's less clear because maybe my eye is less sharp, but there's also
[34:59.060 --> 35:01.180]  patterns with nutrient issues.
[35:01.180 --> 35:05.540]  Like we were working with a particular facility that could not get on top of the aphid
[35:05.540 --> 35:10.620]  and then they're running into approved compounds that actually kill the aphids, which
[35:10.620 --> 35:11.740]  is a pretty small list.
[35:12.420 --> 35:18.180]  And, you know, the questions that keep coming back to me are how do I kill this pest?
[35:18.180 --> 35:24.340]  And my response is always, you know, your potassium is three times ideal and the
[35:24.340 --> 35:26.820]  nitrogen is two to four times ideal.
[35:27.380 --> 35:31.300]  And then the questions returned back to me are how do I kill this pest and what compound
[35:31.740 --> 35:34.220]  kills these aphids?
[35:34.220 --> 35:37.780]  And my response is always like these numbers are quite atrocious.
[35:37.780 --> 35:39.060]  We need to fix these numbers.
[35:39.060 --> 35:41.420]  But that doesn't really settle on people.
[35:41.420 --> 35:43.820]  And I think it's mostly because they don't have a reference point for that.
[35:44.220 --> 35:48.780]  They have a reference point for using products, but there's not a lot of people that
[35:48.780 --> 35:51.100]  have actually done data and correlated that data.
[35:51.100 --> 35:55.660]  It's a lot of experiential science of I did this, did this, mixed it together, got a good
[35:55.660 --> 35:59.700]  outcome. There's not a lot of people that are actually doing quantitative data of their
[35:59.700 --> 36:01.860]  nutrient process on any level.
[36:02.380 --> 36:06.540]  And I think that in of itself can solve most of these issues.
[36:06.900 --> 36:11.020]  Like when your soil is low in calcium or your nutrient reservoir is low in calcium,
[36:11.020 --> 36:12.220]  you're going to have a pest issue.
[36:13.900 --> 36:20.460]  You know, and conversely, on the biological side, if there is an imbalance of these soil
[36:20.460 --> 36:22.460]  organisms, you're going to have a problem.
[36:22.460 --> 36:27.460]  And, you know, we stay far away from we don't ever recommend compounds.
[36:27.460 --> 36:29.100]  I try to really stay out of that lane.
[36:29.340 --> 36:31.420]  I don't make any suggestions for killing pests.
[36:31.740 --> 36:36.140]  I pull data points of the facility, aggregate the data, try to identify where the imbalance
[36:36.140 --> 36:40.980]  is coming from and work on that while somebody else determines what to do with the pests.
[36:40.980 --> 36:43.340]  And normally, you know, we outrun the pests.
[36:43.340 --> 36:48.020]  We've we've yet to really have a facility that we couldn't get on top of any problem
[36:48.020 --> 36:51.580]  really by making those changes and taking that strategy.
[36:51.700 --> 36:57.100]  So, you know, I and then there's all the other complications like there was touch on
[36:57.620 --> 36:59.020]  the Oregon Department of Ag.
[36:59.020 --> 37:02.420]  Like they have done an amazing job at identifying what.
[37:03.900 --> 37:08.220]  Organically approved calm products have a whole bunch of garbage in it, and there's just
[37:08.220 --> 37:13.180]  so many considerations about taking the strategy of reaching for a product to solve a
[37:13.180 --> 37:17.900]  problem, because we're now seeing time and time and time and time again that more problems
[37:17.900 --> 37:19.380]  are coming with that product choice.
[37:19.860 --> 37:24.580]  And we need to shift our focus to what is the underlying cause that's leading to this
[37:24.820 --> 37:30.340]  health problem that is bringing this pest as a messenger to imbalance of our process,
[37:30.340 --> 37:35.180]  whether it's, you know, cleanliness to your facility, whether it's a nutrient issue,
[37:35.180 --> 37:37.260]  whether it's an environmental issue, all of that stuff.
[37:37.260 --> 37:39.900]  It's they're trying to tell you there's an issue, you know.
[37:41.300 --> 37:46.020]  The funny it's funny because I look at a lot of the stuff you were saying now or how
[37:46.020 --> 37:51.820]  you say you explain that stuff a little differently than I did before, because when I
[37:51.820 --> 37:57.100]  go to a facility, sometimes what you see is a mixed amount of varieties, maybe in one
[37:57.100 --> 37:58.140]  flowering house.
[37:58.140 --> 38:04.460]  And a lot of times people will say certain bugs or certain strains attract bugs more
[38:04.460 --> 38:08.380]  than others. Or they'll be like, man, this this strain right here sure is in fact, you
[38:08.380 --> 38:13.140]  know, the aphids love the blue dream or the blackjack or whatever it is.
[38:13.140 --> 38:17.260]  But a lot of times those different varieties mixed in that greenhouse are uptaking
[38:17.780 --> 38:19.260]  nutrients differently.
[38:19.580 --> 38:24.180]  Water, it can be the same soil and the same watering regimen.
[38:24.180 --> 38:27.700]  But I see all these different plants in there and they all have different needs at
[38:27.700 --> 38:33.300]  different times. And some of them simply are on the indica sativa level and the way
[38:33.300 --> 38:34.860]  that they uptake or handle things.
[38:34.860 --> 38:39.140]  And it could be maybe, you know, the virus or something else has something to do with
[38:39.140 --> 38:42.700]  it. But I'm starting to notice that, yeah, they are on certain strains, but there's more
[38:42.740 --> 38:46.700]  of a reason for that. I don't think it's the turps they're after, so to speak.
[38:50.130 --> 38:56.490]  Yeah, and crop timing, how much time, how much time the creatures have to to infiltrate
[38:56.490 --> 38:59.050]  the system, it's definitely, it's definitely an issue.
[38:59.050 --> 39:02.810]  But, you know, I mean, I think that we all see it, too, is the way that they work.
[39:02.810 --> 39:04.290]  Big Ag is the same way that they work.
[39:04.290 --> 39:08.090]  Big Pharma, which is like, let's just put a bandaid on the problem instead of really
[39:08.090 --> 39:14.970]  diving into, you know, managing it on the front end so that the problem never arises.
[39:16.930 --> 39:21.010]  These are these I'm really loving the comments in the group chat.
[39:22.010 --> 39:27.450]  But I was wondering if you, Scott, and also you, Eric, if you want to chime in here.
[39:27.730 --> 39:32.490]  I have my own opinion, but I would love to hear yours about Soilless Media, Juan, and
[39:32.490 --> 39:37.890]  about Rockwool and what you see, especially in the conversation about the aphid, the
[39:37.890 --> 39:41.290]  cannabis aphid that's going all around and like how much worse it is.
[39:41.290 --> 39:45.530]  Is there a difference between the different growing mediums?
[39:45.530 --> 39:47.730]  Do you all notice this? Because I have.
[39:49.050 --> 39:51.290]  Yes. Yes.
[39:52.130 --> 39:53.370]  Yes. Yeah.
[39:54.170 --> 39:59.450]  I guess we'll say, like, if I think through the clients that we've had active in the last
[39:59.490 --> 40:05.650]  year, whether from casual call in to full intense, we only had one facility that had
[40:05.650 --> 40:09.610]  aphids in a living soil that was difficult to control.
[40:10.370 --> 40:15.170]  They were battling the fact that, you know, they were essentially trying to do living
[40:15.170 --> 40:17.530]  soil on a Soilless Media media.
[40:17.530 --> 40:19.650]  It was it was it was the wrong product.
[40:19.650 --> 40:23.970]  So I think that was more to cause for the aphid.
[40:24.250 --> 40:25.730]  And then we changed out the soil.
[40:25.730 --> 40:27.610]  Now it's getting under control.
[40:27.610 --> 40:31.170]  But nonetheless, we're seeing it less there.
[40:32.330 --> 40:35.250]  We do. We work with everybody.
[40:35.250 --> 40:38.250]  Like I said, we try to help everybody move towards sustainability.
[40:38.250 --> 40:39.490]  We work with large ag.
[40:39.490 --> 40:41.090]  We're working with 30 acres of grape.
[40:41.330 --> 40:43.050]  We work with 10 pot growers.
[40:43.250 --> 40:45.610]  We work with large commercial cannabis facilities.
[40:45.810 --> 40:51.810]  And I also do work with a certain range of, you know, farms in the hydroponics because a
[40:51.810 --> 40:53.290]  lot of the math is very similar.
[40:53.570 --> 40:58.890]  I don't at all profess to be a rockwell expert, but if I can help a rockwell facility be
[40:58.890 --> 41:01.130]  more sustainable, I still think that's a good goal.
[41:02.290 --> 41:07.330]  And one of the things that I noticed in this last year is like on some of the rockwell,
[41:07.330 --> 41:09.650]  they're starting to get like this weird white mold.
[41:09.970 --> 41:14.650]  And, you know, all the photos I get sent to my phone of, hey, bro, what's this kind of go
[41:14.650 --> 41:19.210]  through trends? And this entire last year, I've gotten a whole bunch of like this weird
[41:19.210 --> 41:22.410]  white fuzz on the top of the rockwell saying, what's this?
[41:22.410 --> 41:28.290]  And I mean, you got 20, 25 year old or 20, 25 year rockwell guys seeing something they've
[41:28.290 --> 41:29.410]  never seen before.
[41:29.410 --> 41:32.210]  And, you know, I don't really know what the issues is.
[41:32.210 --> 41:36.170]  Some of them had some heavy metals, but, you know, in those same facilities, they also
[41:36.170 --> 41:37.210]  have an aphid issue.
[41:37.690 --> 41:42.890]  I think one of the consequences of never analyzing anything from a nutrient quantity is
[41:42.890 --> 41:49.530]  you don't measure variations when they become remarkably ideal and are remarkably skewed
[41:49.530 --> 41:52.250]  from ideal. And, you know, we haven't been
[41:52.250 --> 41:56.690]  measuring a lot of these things like we're just recently now measuring the substrate for
[41:56.690 --> 41:58.730]  heavy metals because it's a test issue.
[41:59.130 --> 42:03.410]  So we don't even really know what to compare it to because five years ago, rockwell guys
[42:03.410 --> 42:06.250]  weren't doing heavy metal testing of their rockwell.
[42:08.330 --> 42:12.370]  Well, these products have changed over time, the quality of products changes with the
[42:12.370 --> 42:13.570]  supply and demand.
[42:14.410 --> 42:19.090]  You know, a lot of manufacturers on the soil side or you see this, Scott, one of the
[42:19.090 --> 42:22.810]  things people do is they go for a cheaper cocoa to add to the mix or whatever.
[42:22.810 --> 42:26.970]  And there comes a little bit of a detriment to the whole system when we change
[42:26.970 --> 42:31.730]  something like that up and we compromise the quality or just it comes with a higher
[42:31.730 --> 42:33.490]  salt value or something like that.
[42:33.490 --> 42:39.210]  And so when you get into some of these bigger areas of production, everybody goes to
[42:39.210 --> 42:42.130]  the same soil company, but they call for their own blend.
[42:42.170 --> 42:45.410]  They all call for their own mix or blend or whatever it is.
[42:45.730 --> 42:50.730]  And some of them are 50 percent cocoa, 50 percent perlite or, you know, it's crazy.
[42:50.770 --> 42:56.010]  You know, some of the craziest things that I've heard, one facility uses all salts and
[42:56.010 --> 42:57.650]  they use no biologicals.
[42:57.650 --> 43:01.090]  But when I was here on their soil mix, they use earthworm castings and they're trying to
[43:01.090 --> 43:02.170]  get their costs down.
[43:02.410 --> 43:06.810]  And the earthworm castings are the most expensive part to their nutrient, to their
[43:06.810 --> 43:08.610]  soil mix. And I'm like, well, wait a minute.
[43:08.610 --> 43:12.810]  You just, you know, God told me that you use salts.
[43:12.810 --> 43:15.730]  You don't use biologicals, but you got earthworm castings.
[43:15.730 --> 43:17.370]  And I'm like, what the fuck are we doing?
[43:17.370 --> 43:21.570]  Like, you know, so I mean, at the end of the day, there's not a lot of data driven like
[43:21.570 --> 43:23.170]  what you're saying to that point.
[43:23.410 --> 43:29.370]  But also on the salt side of things, too, is that with the rock, we'll even even if it's
[43:29.370 --> 43:32.810]  not flood and drain, they're using the netafim little pricks that go on the top.
[43:33.170 --> 43:36.770]  Nobody's really from what I can tell, except for a select few.
[43:36.770 --> 43:38.410]  And I'm learning a lot about it right now.
[43:38.410 --> 43:41.930]  And shout out to Aaron Levy, the dude that I'm learning a lot from right now.
[43:43.050 --> 43:44.730]  He does big greenhouse stuff.
[43:44.730 --> 43:46.810]  And so drip and drain reports.
[43:46.810 --> 43:53.250]  I mean, I can't I'm new to this stuff myself, but the drip and drain reports tell a lot.
[43:53.530 --> 43:58.090]  I mean, it tells so much that you can tell on the weekends of people underwater because
[43:58.090 --> 44:02.290]  there's Monday through Friday crew and then there's the skeleton crews that come in on
[44:02.290 --> 44:06.170]  the weekends that are in charge of also making sure that the facilities are watered.
[44:06.450 --> 44:10.450]  And if they're not necessarily conducting drip and drain reports on the weekend to know
[44:10.490 --> 44:15.450]  how much water is being used on some of these warmer days, when you come back in on
[44:15.450 --> 44:20.410]  Monday, that drip and drain report tells you a lot in the EC and the leachate reading.
[44:20.810 --> 44:27.050]  And so, I mean, that actually has a lot to do with what's tied up in those systems so
[44:27.050 --> 44:30.170]  that we have deficiencies or not.
[44:30.170 --> 44:34.930]  And, you know, Scott and I always joke around about the purple stem pheno because, you
[44:34.970 --> 44:41.090]  know, these plants that are lacking in calcium show purple stems and the more throughout
[44:41.090 --> 44:44.610]  the plant it gets, the more problematic it is.
[44:44.610 --> 44:48.450]  And so the inside joke has always been, oh, is that the purple stem pheno?
[44:48.770 --> 44:54.010]  And a lot of times the the growers or the people don't get the joke or because, you
[44:54.010 --> 44:57.850]  know, but I mean, I see a lot of purple stem pheno these days.
[44:57.850 --> 45:02.930]  And I mean, it can be a lack of watering, too, that people try to conduct as a measure
[45:02.930 --> 45:04.090]  to prevent mold.
[45:05.130 --> 45:07.450]  But it creates a whole bunch of other problems.
[45:11.780 --> 45:16.900]  Well, I mean, unfortunately, you know, to one degree or another, we have this we have
[45:16.900 --> 45:20.180]  this great section of the cannabis cultivation population.
[45:20.180 --> 45:22.700]  You know, these farmers are really they know their business.
[45:22.700 --> 45:24.980]  They know their growing method.
[45:24.980 --> 45:26.940]  They've got it down at their facility.
[45:28.140 --> 45:31.820]  Hopefully they have the proper support from upper management.
[45:31.820 --> 45:35.180]  Hopefully they have the finances to run the business the way that needs to be run so
[45:35.180 --> 45:40.020]  that things can be controlled in a way that's most advantageous to everybody in the
[45:40.020 --> 45:46.340]  system. And then, you know, again, as we're seeing these as as the regulations unfold
[45:46.500 --> 45:51.500]  and we see the new players come in in different states, it's highly variable whether or
[45:51.500 --> 45:55.220]  not you're going to get someone that's really educated in cannabis or really educated
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.500]  in the size of facility and the type of facility, like I was saying earlier, that's
[45:59.500 --> 46:01.620]  going to be able to help you run your business.
[46:01.620 --> 46:06.420]  You know, I've seen people be immensely successful and then, you know, they have a
[46:06.420 --> 46:09.140]  problem and it turns out that they're not cleaning their drip emitters.
[46:09.140 --> 46:10.860]  You know, they're not cleaning their irrigation.
[46:10.860 --> 46:14.980]  And then they have some sort of, you know, root borne disease that they're dealing with
[46:14.980 --> 46:16.140]  or even the aphids.
[46:16.140 --> 46:20.420]  You know, the the parasitic wasp will go in, will burrow down.
[46:20.620 --> 46:25.940]  And as long as they have enough movement and will parasitize and mummify aphids inside
[46:25.940 --> 46:27.620]  of drip emitters. I have photographs.
[46:27.620 --> 46:29.580]  It's disgusting and fascinating.
[46:29.620 --> 46:30.620]  That's so crazy.
[46:31.460 --> 46:33.260]  It's real gross, but it's cool.
[46:34.500 --> 46:39.060]  So if that's their capacity and, you know, nobody's like using any sort of cleaning
[46:39.060 --> 46:42.420]  solution and they're not using it for the right amount of time, if they're not washing
[46:42.420 --> 46:45.820]  their emitters, you know, letting things dry, putting them back in a new plant.
[46:45.820 --> 46:48.260]  It's like there's your major problem.
[46:48.540 --> 46:52.260]  Even if you did everything right, like that's a situation that's going to keep you from
[46:52.260 --> 46:56.540]  being successful and gaining a level of control.
[46:57.500 --> 47:00.300]  That lets you, you know, really, really do well.
[47:01.460 --> 47:05.420]  Yeah. One thing I'm seeing is like, you know, it's touched on a little bit earlier with
[47:05.420 --> 47:10.260]  Lydia was that, you know, cannabis is essentially coming from a by all means necessary
[47:10.260 --> 47:13.700]  approach, like nobody was looking, nobody was there, you could do whatever.
[47:13.700 --> 47:19.020]  And I, you know, coming from Southern California during really the peak of the OG era,
[47:19.020 --> 47:20.460]  like I saw some wild shit.
[47:20.620 --> 47:25.260]  And, you know, most of the cultivation strategies, techniques and even nutrient
[47:25.260 --> 47:30.540]  formulations have been propped up by this by all means necessary spray, whatever
[47:30.540 --> 47:35.060]  approach. And then the other side of it is we have people coming from agriculture that's
[47:35.540 --> 47:37.060]  remarkably unmonitored.
[47:38.460 --> 47:42.860]  And then you have people from the cut flower industry, again, remarkably unmonitored.
[47:42.860 --> 47:47.460]  And so you have all these groups coming in to cultivate cannabis and almost none of
[47:47.460 --> 47:52.820]  those people have been working on a strategy that leads to actual health without a by
[47:52.820 --> 47:54.220]  all means necessary approach.
[47:54.740 --> 48:01.940]  And we need to get to the underlying level of the problem, which is the reason why we're
[48:01.940 --> 48:06.380]  battling this aphid so much is because the way we conduct ourself is conducive to
[48:06.380 --> 48:13.260]  problems. You know, the one like, for example, on the one farm that the aphids were out
[48:13.260 --> 48:17.780]  of control, there's a certain value on the mineral nutrient test that we quantify that is
[48:17.780 --> 48:19.140]  correlated to problems.
[48:19.180 --> 48:25.900]  And, you know, they were two to three times the value of a facility that had root aphids,
[48:25.900 --> 48:30.460]  for example. And so there were, you know, this aphid problem that was biblical that they
[48:30.460 --> 48:31.700]  couldn't get under control.
[48:32.100 --> 48:34.660]  There was an undesirable value on the nutrient test.
[48:34.900 --> 48:39.460]  There was two to three times above other problem that we've quantified is what I'm
[48:39.460 --> 48:45.820]  trying to say. And so, like, one of the reasons why I think this aphid is so problematic
[48:45.820 --> 48:51.900]  and is so hard to get under control is because something is driving things that far out
[48:51.900 --> 48:52.380]  of whack.
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.540]  Just what nutrients were they too high in?
[48:57.620 --> 49:02.940]  Well, so in this particular instance, what I was monitoring was something called
[49:02.940 --> 49:04.100]  exchangeable hydrogen.
[49:04.500 --> 49:09.500]  And again, my background is not in chemistry and I don't have a full foundational
[49:09.500 --> 49:12.340]  knowledge to really articulate what exactly that means.
[49:12.340 --> 49:17.420]  But essentially it starts to disrupt how calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium
[49:17.420 --> 49:18.780]  occupy the soil particle.
[49:19.260 --> 49:25.620]  And so like a normal healthy soil mix, usually that value is, you know, five or less.
[49:27.940 --> 49:30.900]  Where it starts to get elevated is when fish products are used.
[49:30.900 --> 49:37.900]  So if like a fish based compost or a lot of fish hydrolysate was used in every situation of
[49:37.900 --> 49:42.860]  farm we've worked with that did high levels of fish hydrolysis also had elevated levels of
[49:42.860 --> 49:43.860]  exchangeable hydrogen.
[49:44.420 --> 49:50.020]  And so, you know, on that value, like most farms we see it's under 12.
[49:52.100 --> 49:58.420]  You know, the couple of root aphid farms were like 20 to 30 and the biblical aphid farm was
[49:58.420 --> 49:59.340]  like 53.
[49:59.340 --> 50:02.620]  They had a range of like 36 to 53 at their particular farm.
[50:02.940 --> 50:04.340]  And that's like the highest I've seen.
[50:04.340 --> 50:06.860]  And they had an aphid population that was like biblical.
[50:08.340 --> 50:13.540]  And so, you know, I don't have the foundational chemistry knowledge to explain why those fish
[50:13.540 --> 50:15.060]  products lead to this.
[50:15.060 --> 50:21.460]  I just know it disrupts those four main cations, which are important for soil structure and cell
[50:21.460 --> 50:27.820]  development. So I don't know how that correlates to like the salt based facilities, but, you
[50:27.820 --> 50:34.140]  know, nonetheless, the same root issue is there's an extreme discrepancy in mineral balance as
[50:34.140 --> 50:38.020]  correlated to ideal health or at least tolerable levels of pest pressure.
[50:42.360 --> 50:43.600]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.120]  The the there was a comment in there that said, but what about eradication?
[50:52.160 --> 50:55.160]  You know, we're talking about control, control, control.
[50:55.520 --> 51:01.760]  And I honestly don't think eradication is is really I mean, maybe it's possible on the small
[51:01.760 --> 51:05.880]  scale, but eradication, especially if you're bringing in clones from nurseries, you're not
[51:05.880 --> 51:09.560]  doing yourself. The element of human error is still great, too.
[51:09.600 --> 51:15.920]  So, I mean, eradication just is really on the bug side of things is really, you know, a
[51:15.920 --> 51:20.720]  tough pill for me to swallow, whereas control is really, you know, ultimately the name of
[51:20.720 --> 51:25.080]  the game, because if you don't stay in control, that's where things get out of hand.
[51:25.400 --> 51:27.840]  And we can hope for full eradication.
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.680]  But I think that only consists of tissue culture, like until you tissue culture something.
[51:32.680 --> 51:35.760]  But then again, the plants reintroduced and back into the world.
[51:35.760 --> 51:41.480]  And, you know, it's not that it can ever tissue culture is the end of all your problems, but
[51:41.480 --> 51:45.960]  it's a way to definitely clean things up and go for a restart on the eradication end of
[51:45.960 --> 51:51.200]  things. But will you stay eradicated, you know, throughout the course of time?
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.200]  I mean, I doubt it.
[51:52.200 --> 51:54.760]  I mean, this is just how the world works.
[51:55.760 --> 52:01.000]  Yeah, that's I think that's still under there's an underlying mentality issue with
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.720]  eradication. Like you're talking about saying, what can I do to wipe out 300 million
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.120]  years of evolution? Like I'm telling you, like all these little insects are perfectly
[52:12.120 --> 52:13.720]  serving a purpose on the planet.
[52:13.720 --> 52:17.960]  Like you're not going to overcome that with a bottled nutrient or a bottled pesticide.
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.280]  Like you have to change the chemistry of the plant to be less desirable as a food source
[52:24.280 --> 52:30.480]  for the pest. And back in 2016, we worked for a really large cultivator and got to see
[52:30.480 --> 52:34.800]  some wild stuff. And, you know, that particular dude was a wild man.
[52:34.840 --> 52:38.960]  And during that time, broad mites and russet mites were a big problem.
[52:39.240 --> 52:43.360]  And I was working out of some smaller greenhouses that provided moms and clones for the
[52:43.360 --> 52:48.160]  rest of the operation. And he would bring plants in with broad mites and russet mites
[52:48.160 --> 52:50.360]  into this little greenhouse.
[52:50.360 --> 52:52.960]  And, you know, that seemed pretty wild to me.
[52:52.960 --> 52:56.320]  And his response would be, look, everybody else is afraid of these things.
[52:56.320 --> 52:58.000]  I'm paying you to understand them.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.080]  So go understand why these pests are here.
[53:00.440 --> 53:05.440]  And what was crazy is he would bring plants in and like two and three gallon pots that
[53:05.440 --> 53:06.560]  other people had abandoned.
[53:06.560 --> 53:10.320]  Usually it was really good genetics that another cultivator like finally threw up their
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.360]  hands. So he'd get like this little sickly like two gallon and he would throw it into the
[53:14.360 --> 53:17.480]  greenhouse with all these other plants and the russet mites and broad mites.
[53:17.480 --> 53:21.960]  Not one single time did they move from those infected plants to his plants.
[53:22.520 --> 53:27.440]  And we would take those plants that were infested with russet mites and broad mites, plant
[53:27.440 --> 53:30.680]  them up into a 30 gallon with soil and put them on his program.
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.960]  And the russet, that plant would grow out of it.
[53:34.520 --> 53:39.240]  Some it wouldn't necessarily turn into a beautiful mom, but we're able to rehabilitate it
[53:39.240 --> 53:41.720]  in a sufficient way that we could clone it, reproduce it.
[53:42.160 --> 53:47.800]  But, you know, through this entire period of like nine months, he would do this.
[53:47.800 --> 53:51.320]  And not one time did those bugs move to the other issues.
[53:52.560 --> 53:56.880]  We did have a situation where it was a sealed greenhouse and it got real hot and it
[53:56.880 --> 53:58.280]  became a spider mite issue.
[53:58.960 --> 54:02.800]  But that was a little bit more of an environmental consideration that was creating that
[54:02.800 --> 54:08.560]  problem. And so, you know, that was a really powerful learning opportunity for me,
[54:08.560 --> 54:12.040]  because for one, somebody was paying me to understand the difference between the russet
[54:12.040 --> 54:14.360]  mite and the broad mite and the healthy plants.
[54:14.640 --> 54:21.400]  But I also got to see like there is a nutritional correlation to the pest or disease
[54:21.400 --> 54:23.280]  issue that that plant is expressing.
[54:23.800 --> 54:29.880]  And if we can change the metabolism of the plant and we can change how the plant is
[54:29.880 --> 54:34.360]  forming cells and making complete proteins and building healthy cell structure from a
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.680]  balanced mineral nutrition, that they can be more resilient to bugs and disease.
[54:39.640 --> 54:40.840]  You know, other people say this.
[54:40.840 --> 54:42.400]  John Kemp speaks about this.
[54:42.400 --> 54:45.560]  Other people say the things that John Kemp says.
[54:45.560 --> 54:49.760]  And a lot of times, like the practical farmer rolls his eyes at these concepts.
[54:50.200 --> 54:57.320]  But the reality is like, you know, I think the best metaphor I've come up with is like
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.760]  us as humans don't look at a gravel, a pile of gravel rocks and say, hmm, that's
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.720]  lunch. Like we know as a human that that's not a food source for us and our body is not
[55:07.720 --> 55:10.680]  equipped to chew the rock and turn it into lunch.
[55:11.040 --> 55:16.200]  But like if nature weathers that rock, turns it into soil and I plant carrots, I can eat
[55:16.200 --> 55:21.440]  the carrot. But that carrot is just the mineral composition of that rock at a different
[55:21.440 --> 55:22.480]  stage of development.
[55:22.680 --> 55:25.360]  It is now a food source for my human body.
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.040]  My teeth are designed to eat that carrot and I can now form nutrition from that.
[55:30.040 --> 55:32.040]  Like pests are the same way.
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.520]  Like powdery mildew has certain nutritional needs and capabilities of digesting plant
[55:37.520 --> 55:43.600]  material. Russet mites have certain abilities to digest plants and plant sap.
[55:43.600 --> 55:50.360]  And so the different pests, I think, is correlated to how out of balance or how broken
[55:50.360 --> 55:55.520]  the cells of that plant are, because then whatever components are in that plant sap are
[55:55.520 --> 55:58.000]  now digestible by that specific plant species.
[55:59.120 --> 56:04.520]  That's a big idea, though, the you know, we haven't really we don't talk about that in
[56:04.520 --> 56:07.680]  health care. We don't talk about that in agriculture.
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.360]  The fact that your plant has the capability of being completely healthy and completely
[56:12.400 --> 56:18.480]  pest free. So, I mean, I guess we need to start talking about that as a attainable goal.
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.920]  Obviously, we have a lot to learn as a community and as a people.
[56:22.920 --> 56:27.800]  But I think it's definitely a valid and worthy goal.
[56:28.560 --> 56:30.280]  But anyway, that's a big picture idea.
[56:30.280 --> 56:33.560]  So we have to wrap our minds around that for sure.
[56:34.520 --> 56:38.040]  Yeah, I think, hey, hey, Kim.
[56:38.560 --> 56:45.360]  Yo, this is a killer topic because it's a it's a concept mentally that people have to
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.600]  understand that when the organism is balanced, it wards off issues better.
[56:51.440 --> 56:58.240]  And what we've what we've done is we've become so dependent on chemical solutions that we
[56:58.240 --> 57:04.800]  use it for ourselves and in plant situations and for conventional ag, you know, you have
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.640]  a spray that can kill most anything.
[57:06.640 --> 57:12.480]  And so with conventional ag, you can control in a way differently, but you're also
[57:12.480 --> 57:15.440]  eradicating everything around it and yourself over time.
[57:15.840 --> 57:18.280]  So I question the logic.
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.480]  But it's the truth that when the plants are unbalanced, they're vulnerable.
[57:23.720 --> 57:26.360]  And I look at that as unmetabolized nutrition.
[57:26.640 --> 57:33.560]  And I equate it to plant obesity, like human obesity, where you are carrying too much of
[57:33.560 --> 57:36.360]  something that's desirable by something that wants to eat.
[57:37.400 --> 57:42.720]  And when the plant has adequate epidural level, so the surface is tough, it can't be
[57:42.720 --> 57:47.200]  chewed. When you get an adequate calcium transport, you get and sell walls that are
[57:47.200 --> 57:48.400]  turgid and strong.
[57:49.040 --> 57:52.840]  And our approach is to always push the plant, I think, faster than it can.
[57:52.840 --> 57:55.320]  It can take it up because we look at it like it's buffered.
[57:56.040 --> 57:57.680]  So we're blowing the shit out of these things.
[57:57.680 --> 58:00.160]  And you can tell because the lateral growth is supernatural.
[58:00.640 --> 58:06.040]  So we're putting a level of nutrient load into the plant to make it do a thing.
[58:06.640 --> 58:09.520]  And if it's not in a vacuum, man, it's a smorgasbord.
[58:10.360 --> 58:12.160]  And every bug wants to eat it.
[58:12.160 --> 58:17.640]  And so it's this it's like a reeducation of what we what we can do and what we can't.
[58:17.920 --> 58:23.440]  And that'll set the real baseline of what's possible in production until we learn how to
[58:23.440 --> 58:24.800]  go past that correctly.
[58:26.280 --> 58:28.160]  Yep, I agree 100 percent.
[58:28.160 --> 58:31.840]  And I think the people want to know how to fix that problem or how to deal with it.
[58:31.840 --> 58:33.040]  And it's really math.
[58:33.040 --> 58:38.560]  It's a mathematical equation through water testing and soil testing or drip and drain
[58:38.560 --> 58:43.480]  testing and all these things to make sure that you're balancing everything appropriately,
[58:43.480 --> 58:49.360]  because as Scott has pointed out, a lot of the soils nowadays are high in potassium.
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.800]  There's not a total balance in that.
[58:51.800 --> 58:55.080]  And so sometimes we get off track right out the gate.
[58:56.080 --> 58:59.760]  If we don't get that balance in or maybe we're spraying the wrong mineral, that's
[58:59.760 --> 59:01.400]  actually adding to the problem.
[59:01.400 --> 59:06.480]  And so it's not about just adding minerals in general, but it's about knowing what
[59:06.480 --> 59:09.800]  you're deficient in. And most people know they're deficient in sulfur.
[59:09.800 --> 59:14.800]  That's why you see a lot of people spray sulfur, especially on the OGs and veg, to
[59:14.800 --> 59:19.040]  try to prevent that late flower PM and things like that.
[59:19.040 --> 59:23.160]  And Scott lately or over time has been putting adding the sulfur into the soil, I
[59:23.160 --> 59:25.480]  believe. Correct me if I'm wrong, Scott.
[59:25.480 --> 59:29.840]  Yeah, I've been learning a lot about this sulfur spraying, too, because of the phyto
[59:29.880 --> 59:33.880]  that it creates and the agitation that's needed, especially in the sulfur sprays.
[59:34.160 --> 59:36.120]  And then a lot of people want to spray kelp.
[59:36.120 --> 59:41.000]  And so what I've learned also is that the big guys will mix the sulfur and kelp
[59:41.000 --> 59:47.920]  together and spray it at one time because it also darkens that residue, which lessens
[59:47.920 --> 59:50.360]  the phyto even at good agitation rates.
[59:51.080 --> 59:55.240]  Yeah, just to comment real quick, what Eric was talking about is I had kind of an aha
[59:55.240 --> 01:00:00.240]  moment working with a couple of OG growers back to back that were growing in soil.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.040]  And, you know, there's some issues in California now with using sulfur.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.200]  So like there's a facility down in Los Angeles that we're working with.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.480]  They're able to use sulfur.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.800]  But these guys in this particular region were possibly not able to use sulfur.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.400]  It's kind of confusing the whole thing.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.800]  But nonetheless, we're running into an issue where people have been reliant on
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.600]  spraying sulfur on the plant to deal with problems.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.720]  And some people may or may not be able to use that anymore in the regulated space.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.200]  So there was a motivation for finding another alternative.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:39.240]  And one day I sat down with the soil mineral reports from an OG grower and I calculated
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:47.280]  out how many pounds of wettable sulfur they were defining as the need for that crop.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.680]  So they had a certain amount per week they were spraying.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:55.040]  I calculated all that up to figure out how many grams of elemental sulfur they were
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.200]  using throughout a harvest cycle.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.320]  And then I correlated that to the mineral test into PPMs of what the bare minimum
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:10.160]  should be. And it was really close to how much sulfur they felt they need to spray in
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.240]  the course of a harvest cycle to hit the goal was really close to how many PPMs of
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.280]  sulfur should be in the soil to have healthy protein formation with calcium.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.200]  So I started looking at that more a little bit closer, but just a little little tip.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.600]  I think I think there's two things.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.640]  I think there's a contact kill benefit, but I think a lot of these plants maybe need more
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.720]  sulfur in their diet.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.800]  And we've become dependent on spraying it when we just be feeding it as a nutrient.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.120]  Yeah, totally.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.760]  That's the sulfur thing is tricky, too, because the labeling, there's not a lot of
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.080]  wettable sulfurs that are labeled properly that you can actually use in cannabis with
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.680]  these registered materials because of all the the lingo.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:57.160]  If it says it's not used for ornamentals, this, that and the other, or I forget what the
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.240]  key word is.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.720]  There's a couple of key phrases that need to be in that list of what it's used for.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.880]  And so most of the sulfur sprays are not.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.120]  That's why a lot of counties deem them as not usable in cannabis, because it's not
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.360]  labeled right. Basically, it's totally fine to use.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.880]  But, you know, if people take stuff to the county and go, this is what I'm using.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.040]  Plus, there is use reports that have to be submitted to the county of what you're
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.680]  using. So there's a lot of transparency on that end.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.840]  So what people end up doing, there's one product that is labeled properly as a
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:35.120]  wettable or a sprayable sulfur that I think I think Urban Grow out of Colorado sells
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  it or whatever. And I forget the name of the stuff and it's high dollar.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.240]  And so what people do is they leave that in the cabinet for inspection, but then they
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.320]  spray the you know, what most people use in the berries and other things is called
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.080]  microfile disperse.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.640]  And so the microfile disperse mixed with kelp.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.200]  Boom. Everybody seems to love that.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.360]  But when the inspection time comes, they throw out the high dollar labeled shit, right
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.920]  type of thing or something like that.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.120]  You know, it's kind of the thing.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.560]  But, you know, most people are used to using a lot of those products down there
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:14.360]  anyway. So sulfur is really kind of low on the on the fuck you up totem pole and some
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.480]  of these other big ag areas compared to maybe in the triangle where they're really
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.120]  zeroing in on everything and they don't have much other ag going on.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.040]  So this is it. They're going to follow the follow the book, basically.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.640]  So it's funny that you say that you mentioned the Opera sulfur.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.400]  That's what it is.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.240]  Yeah. So and I love my crowd.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.840]  So actually, that's the one that I told people to use if they have like a rest of my
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.800]  issue. Obviously, there's application instructions that go along with that recommendation.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.000]  But that's a product that I really like.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.840]  I've seen be extremely successful.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.440]  What I have noticed and what I do think is very interesting within the industry is the
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.080]  formulation of products and then the intention of the product.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.360]  So if the label or if any of the supporting materials for the label indicate that this is a
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.760]  pesticide or and that's going after something that you have completely different
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.880]  regulations than if we're talking about a nutrient or an additive or like an inoculant.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:20.120]  So one of the ways that we were dealing with one of the species of fruit that that really
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.960]  popped up in Colorado a few years ago was that, you know, hitting them with Bavaria
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:32.200]  bossy on a metarizum, Paley, Paisley, my seeds, and a couple of other different fungi in the
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.200]  root zone.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.040]  You know, the studies are still out on which one of them is the most effective if in
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.000]  different ratios you have a greater kill rate than another.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.520]  But, you know, as we all know, the industry is a lot of research.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:50.200]  And then there's also a real lack of control that's able to be achieved in greenhouses
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.480]  and outdoor to be able to determine what actually works to keep cannabis clean and safe.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:01.080]  And so one of the ways that Urban Grow privately labeled and got that product through which
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:06.280]  I'm pretty sure it's sulfur six is a dry flowable that comes out of another.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.880]  It's just they relabel it and the product already exists.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:14.200]  But the way that they were able to get that product through the Colorado market was that
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.840]  they were saying that it is a pesticide or an additive or an additive.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.560]  And they were saying that it is a nutrient.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.560]  It's a foliar nutrient spray.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:30.440]  And so that kind of, you know, the people that are running the departments of ag like,
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.480]  you know, and that are looking into this type of information, like they're smart, you know,
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.680]  they do their job.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.800]  They know what's going on.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:43.800]  But like if you're able to prove and to offer scientific papers that say, hey, feeding the
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.040]  sulfur makes the plant healthier.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.560]  Because the plant's healthier, it doesn't have russet mites anymore.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.240]  That's kind of a workaround that a lot of people are using in different areas of the
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.720]  industry with varying levels of success.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:03.240]  I got to say, Lydia, Scott, Sarah, Kevin, it's an honor to be on here with you motherfucking
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.560]  G's like this shit is got me.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.200]  I'm like into this like damn like.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:09.980]  Whoo.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.400]  I love it.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.040]  Dang.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.000]  It's next level.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.560]  Watch your hats.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:20.280]  Yeah, and that's I mean, I've always just felt like that's kind of what people are clamoring
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:27.320]  for is just to listen to it's like, Scott, I think of it as like nutrients and microbes
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.280]  and stuff like that.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:36.360]  Like, Scott, I think of you as someone who like eats books and does research and then
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:42.760]  you poop out digestible, intelligent, coherent thought bites for the community.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.520]  Yes, that's actually been my role the entire time.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:52.280]  People I think the Internet and shockingly, a lot of people don't want to eat your poo,
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.960]  but I've been out since day one.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.640]  So there's no let's just clarify.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.000]  There's no feces involved.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.680]  But no, that's totally what happened.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.240]  Like, you know, I come from Southern California from a pretty diverse neighborhood.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:09.240]  And, you know, some of the homies from high school went really hard on the indoor OG cultivation.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.600]  And so I used to come along and check it out.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.520]  And it would be me and like a bunch of homies.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.000]  And I'd be like, well, why is that happening?
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.440]  And someone be like, the plants need the proteins.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.800]  And I'd be like, the plants need the proteins, like the plants need the proteins.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.720]  And I'm like, why are we doing this?
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.400]  Plants need the proteins.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.480]  And I'm like, none of you motherfuckers know any reason why we're doing stuff.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.800]  And so no disrespect, but like they were doing a great job.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.480]  But like nobody knew why.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.120]  And my compulsion and obsession was the why.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.280]  Like, I have to know why I'm doing something if I'm going to tinker with it or else it's
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.160]  not worth my effort.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.920]  And so I would just.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.720]  It actually works.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.600]  Yeah, it has to work.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.800]  So I just would, you know, try to figure out why something was happening or what was the
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.480]  new like, what did the nutrient even do?
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.080]  What is nitrate didn't even do?
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.360]  What is potassium even do?
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.240]  And how do we solve these problems?
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.440]  And that just carrying on that same energy brought me here, I guess, trying to figure
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.760]  out problems in digesting complicated stuff.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.840]  I loved learning about the minerals and the spray and the minerals from you and Sam from
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.720]  SoilScape, like that whole mineral additive or doing that and spraying is often like you
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.160]  were doing down at that nursery.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.840]  Like, I mean, if more people would do that and like even the big facilities, I'd like
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.000]  to somehow like slide that in there, you know, at least one mineral spray.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:32.760]  You do?
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:33.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.560]  No, Sam had me check it out too.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.960]  And I needed it for my hill because I have such an aggressive wind that I theorized that
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.120]  I wasn't getting calcium transport adequately through the roots because the environment
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.080]  was so aggressive.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.480]  And I was just like, you know what I said, I think I really have to run a foliar program
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.680]  to offset my environmental issues.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.720]  And I talked to Sam, he's like, Kev, I got this killer program.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.840]  I want you to run it.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.120]  And so I ran it last year.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.680]  And I mean, the plants have never looked so good.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.360]  I had so few issues.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.040]  It just kept them on point, you know, and it is it's a gift to be able to be around
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.880]  people who are working on all the fringes.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.320]  That's why I always love hanging out with you because I'm like, you've been touching
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.200]  the hoops since before people knew what hoops were.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:25.880]  Well, so can we stay on this as a kind of a coherent topic, which is spraying minerals?
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.560]  Yeah, they call it a phylo, I think it was a phyloscape program that Sam had over at
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.200]  a soil scape out of Arcata.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.800]  And it's just really a good comprehensive mineral nutrient spray program.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.640]  And what I went into it for is that, you know, my situation is I have such a rough
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.040]  environment up the hill that the finished product is excellent, but I never get the
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.760]  growth out of the plants that I wanted because they're working so hard to work in that
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.800]  environment.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:00.360]  And so I theorize that I needed to go into leaf foliar development so that I could get
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.200]  around having to have the plant go through the metabolic process from the root zone up.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.400]  And one day, Sam gives me a call and says, hey, we have this beautiful program coming
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.440]  out. I'd love to talk to you.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.680]  So I went down the shop, I took a look at an operation that he had been using it on
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:19.000]  and the quality of that, it was an indoor that he was shooting and it was stunning.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.160]  And so I said, look, let me let me run it on my hill.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.560]  So I picked the program up and I had the best run last year.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.680]  And like I said, when I ran those varieties on that white label, there was at least 25
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.560]  farms that ran the same exact plants that I ran.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.200]  And I had over anyone in California using those varieties.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.040]  I had the highest turp levels and highest cannabinoid levels.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.600]  And I had zero problems with the plants growing.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:51.480]  And I use beneficial insects in terms of inoculation so that I had releases throughout the
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.360]  season so that if I had any problems come in, I would have a bank of beneficials to do the
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.800]  job for me because I didn't I don't like to use any kind of spray, especially in tough
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.440]  environments. Sprays are tough on leaf surface.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.440]  And if the leaves are going through the beet and they take up on the hill, the plant stresses
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.240]  out because of it.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.960]  And that foliar program gave me incredible growth.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.720]  The end product came out beautifully.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.480]  It came out so good that I picked up enough to do the 18,000 square foot this year.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:26.760]  So I'm going to run it a second season because I had such success with that foliar program.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.640]  I believe in it because Scott turned me on to it and I got some clones that had a little
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.400]  spider mites or whatever issue.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.400]  And the first, you know, like we were talking about earlier, we're really spraying for war
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:37.880]  all the time.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.000]  But if more people were spraying for health, they would actually see a better result in
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.800]  the plant health.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.560]  And secondly, the bugs don't like getting sprayed with just plain water anyway if you
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.360]  do it every day.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.440]  And there was a certain point where I was trying to mimic what Scott was doing at a
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:57.640]  nursery where in the evening time I was spraying like five, six nights a week with a different
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.960]  mineral throughout those whole programs.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.480]  I hadn't done any soil analysis or water tests.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.840]  I just said, I'm going to spray minerals and have fun with it.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.480]  And one of them was just one of the things he had me spray was cocoa and aloe.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.720]  And so, I mean, the plants just loved it and the bugs hated it and they went away.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.400]  So I never sprayed any type of pesticide.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.280]  I just sprayed for health the whole time and the plants got better.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.400]  The bugs didn't like it.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.720]  And it was just this win-win situation.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.440]  And I feel like that can be done more at scale.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.720]  It's just hard to implement and get people to jump onto that, you know, swallow that
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.760]  pill because we're so forced into the IPM program of actually the war path.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.880]  And, you know, the health has to be part, you know, has to be there too, obviously.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.600]  But, you know, I think we could make a big turn in some of these, you know, bigger facilities
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.720]  if we could incorporate some more health sprays.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.560]  Oh, guaranteed.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.680]  I fully agree.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.880]  You have to be proactive.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880]  And for me, it was every, it was three times a week.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.440]  So Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.840]  And I would either get in at four o'clock in the morning or I could shoot the evening
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.080]  too so it had time to penetrate in.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.360]  And it made such a difference that the people who've been up the hill prior and saw the
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:18.840]  plants using that treatment couldn't believe it because we've always historically had
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.800]  transplant issues in terms of just slower growth.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.640]  And I know that I'll never get giant plants up there because I have such a wind load all
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:32.600]  the time that when I run my test crops down low, say at 550 feet at my spot, or I run
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.680]  it up at my farm at, you know, 2300 feet, I get, you know, two to three times bigger
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.440]  plant down below.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.440]  Same mix, same media, same operator, same cultivar, only difference environment.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.040]  So I know that that particular place has an impact on the plant.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:57.240]  But when we utilize that foliar nutrition program to just assist with the plant's uptake
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.560]  so it didn't have to work so hard to pull it through the vascular system from below
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.240]  up, the plants just exploded.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.680]  And my friends that came up and saw it, they were just like, what did you do?
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.720]  And I mean, it was so dramatic.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.440]  And then the quality of the flower was phenomenal.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.280]  And when I got hit up by the company and they said, hey, they said, you just clean house
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.600]  on your terps and your cannabinoids.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.360]  And I said, well, nice.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.760]  So not only was the plant healthy, but because it was healthier, it was able to actually
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.880]  go through its chemical process and generate what we want, which is those desirable chemicals.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.520]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.960]  I mean, that's what we want.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.520]  So without a doubt.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.240]  So just quickly, Kevin, you mentioned frequency, which is three times a week.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:50.200]  Scott, can you talk about kind of what minerals are in the mixes that you're recommending?
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:57.240]  And then do you change it based on different stages of plant growth?
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.200]  Like you'd have different mixes during the early stages, veg and so on?
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.920]  Yeah, so I guess to further clarify, the kit that they're talking about is, yeah, it's
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.200]  defined as the Phyloscape.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.720]  That's the name of the product.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.800]  And there's like 11 or 12 bottles in the kit, some powders, some liquids.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:21.480]  And it's made by Soilscape Solutions out in Arcata, which I'm, you know, one of the
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.440]  things that I say is like this kit that Sam came out with, I will say, we'll look back
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.720]  in history and say this kit was one of the more dramatic impactors on the organic sector.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.720]  He assures me that everything in there, except for one product is all organic and it's used
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.000]  with amino acids.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.520]  It does look like chemicals.
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.000]  You know, some of the stuff's blue because copper is blue.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.440]  And so it does look like chemical nutrients, but I trust Sam that all of them, except just
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.680]  the nitrogen phosphate product are organic.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.480]  But it gives you the flexibility of hydroponics, which is what I like.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.920]  And so the standard kit has two recipes that you do three times a week and alternate it.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.800]  That has worked everywhere we've used it.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.800]  I use the kit in a little bit different way.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.760]  I personally use it as a toolkit for hitting ideal math numbers.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.040]  And that does change slightly by the farm.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:20.040]  I also don't use every product in the kit because we have some other products that I
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.080]  use in substitution.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:29.000]  But in essence, what Sam's kit allows me to do is you can formulate a full year nutrient
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:34.200]  that has ideal values of almost every main nutrient.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.040]  And I have not seen anything else that compares to that capability at all.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.800]  There's nothing on the planet that I think gives you those capabilities.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.480]  And so we use them everywhere.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.000]  We use them with the hydroponic farms.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.520]  We use them at the living soil farms.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.800]  I think every single commercial farm I work with at least gets a sample kit.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.240]  And so, which is a funny deal.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.640]  I think it shows how much I believe in that product is that by definition, Sam is an exact
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.360]  competitor to me.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.640]  We both make soil.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.080]  We both do consulting.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.520]  We both do mineral analysis and we both do biological analysis.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.560]  I enjoy that kit so much that I send my competitors to his office to order products.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.960]  I think that speaks to Sam as well.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.480]  I don't feel threatened by him and I trust him and I respect him.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.520]  So far, nothing's good from turning our clients to him as well, which I think is rare in the
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:28.840]  industry.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.400]  And shout out to people who make good products that support this industry and what we're
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.000]  trying to do and achieve.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.880]  That kit's extremely powerful.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:45.160]  So I guess to more clearly define, I more go for a full fertility approach every chance
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.560]  I get because I'm trying to be simple and scalable.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:54.520]  Most farms that hire us have an ultimate goal of allowing to cross state lines, whether
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.800]  that means they invest further in their own business and go across the states or they
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.240]  find outside investment, they create set, whatever that means to them.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.000]  Most farms that we work with are ultimately looking to expand and take advantage of the
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.400]  open market or the open borders when that comes in the United States.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.320]  And in order to do that, you need to have scalable techniques.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:23.880]  And so far, most farms that we've worked with, there's one, two or three key components that
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.000]  makes that system work.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.560]  And you can't scale yourself.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.840]  You need to scale processes that are repeatable and easy and predictable.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:40.120]  And so we take an extremely simplified approach to cultivation and try to just provide full
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.200]  fertility at each step that we can while monitoring biological activity in the soil.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:51.320]  And when we do that, then your cultivation experience is actually scalable.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:57.320]  And so what it's what it starts to do is it simplifies the process so that any employee
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:03.480]  can execute it and we choose process that have really low volatility and really low
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.360]  chances of going haywire so that it keeps it within the comfort of health.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:14.360]  And then, you know, the way that you can then scale that to multiple properties is that
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.040]  the initial analysis is being moved to a data point.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.640]  If we take all the data points of a farm, I can sit down and aggregate all the information
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.800]  of multiple facilities and identify where the problems will be.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:33.080]  That's the biggest obstacle to scale right now is if your strategy for cultivation is
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.320]  spraying everything three times a week and you keep adding more square footage, how many,
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.280]  you know, at what point does that become the breaking point?
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.120]  And so Sarah and I have learned to take key data points of soil nutrition, you know, the
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.680]  nutrition of the feeds and foliar and then the populations of the organisms in the soil.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.440]  And by taking a look at those data sets, you can make very clear correlations as to where
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.720]  the problems will be and you can focus those efforts.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:07.240]  And then you can either determine is the reason for the dysfunction of cultural practice,
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.000]  like our employees doing something that's leading to problems, or is there an imbalance
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.120]  problem that we need to correct?
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:19.960]  And still that allows you to then maintain those one, two or three key employees that
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.240]  make the facility run, but they can then scale their focus.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:29.640]  And I based on what I've seen from, you know, very intensely watching cannabis operations,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.840]  because even from the first day I went into a cannabis growing facility, I was watching
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.560]  it in extreme interest of how to make it successful.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.080]  And so I've kind of watched these obstacles of scale.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.280]  And even in those early black market days of buddies trying to scale the same problems
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.160]  that my buddies ran into going from a couple of houses to a 20,000 square foot building
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.120]  are the same obstacles that every cultivator everywhere is running into.
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.520]  And there just becomes a certain point where you can't do everything the way that you've
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.160]  always done it.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.120]  And that's tripping up anybody that's going up in any scale, whether that's from four
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.160]  to 12 lights or from four facilities to 26 facilities.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:19.400]  Sarah and I have provided advice and consulting to farms with as many as I think the largest
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.240]  group was 26 different properties.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:28.360]  And we have to provide solutions that can be emailed to 26 properties and come up with
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.800]  something that will work.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.440]  And those same strategies apply to a tent grower.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.080]  It's the same systemic imbalances that lead to headaches.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.840]  That's just moving the ball to prevention and getting to the cause of things when we
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:47.400]  talk about these IPM strategies versus always chasing your tail and spraying to kill.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.320]  We always say spray to heal, not to kill.
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.480]  If you can help it at all.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.800]  Which is what Eric was talking about.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.600]  Like, and that's what Eric's really championed that phrase.
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.240]  And that's the thing.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.080]  It's like everybody's mindset is what do I do to kill these aphids?
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.800]  And, you know, from our standpoint, now that accountants are involved counting everything
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.360]  about our process and everything that the cultivator does to determine if it's financially
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.000]  viable.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.840]  Well, one of those things is sending employees to spray something.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:23.000]  And so those employees can either spray a pesticide or like in Kevin's experience, he
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.040]  sprayed a foliar nutrient that led to more terpenes, more potency, more saleability,
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.360]  higher velocity in the market, all those things like, you know, we're not going to do that.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.120]  You know, the bugs hate it too.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.520]  You got to remind them that the bugs don't like that.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.760]  They don't want the plant to get healthy and they don't want to get hit with water even.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.800]  Exactly.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.120]  Yeah.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:48.840]  It's like, how do tornadoes affect reproduction rates of humans?
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.280]  How do hurricanes affect reproduction rates of humans?
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.600]  Like, we can see it in our own life.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.600]  Like, you know, babies slow down a little bit when there's a major catastrophe and a
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.680]  wave coming over the shore.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.040]  And it's like, I can only imagine that the same thing is happening to a bug.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:09.160]  Like, if you go in there three, four times a week and spray anything, you're at least
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.160]  pissing them off and killing a couple of eggs.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.640]  You know, like you might as well spray something that can increase yield, spray something that
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:21.880]  can increase health, spray something that can increase quality markers that will ease
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.480]  your product selling on the market.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.520]  You know, Oregon and Washington, all these markets that are completely destroyed by percentage
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:34.200]  points is really unfortunate, but it's really shown us a lot about our process and what
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.800]  leads to higher numbers.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.840]  Because if that's the focus, that's what we're being put to work on.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.400]  Like, how do we increase potency numbers?
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.760]  Well, you definitely have to decrease aphid problems.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.880]  That's the first step, you know, and then provide supplement that increases those numbers.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.480]  What's the overall support of the plant?
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:01.160]  Yeah, the massive replicating a natural system you were mentioning earlier, it's only six
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.000]  plants that are being infested and you know, the bugs are doing their job.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.480]  You know, the insects and the diseases are there to break down that plant material that's
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.280]  not thriving.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.560]  That's the purpose and point.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.800]  And that's why those things occur in the first place, as we all agree.
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:21.000]  And so watching that develop and as the industry moves more towards a greater understanding
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.080]  of what's going on on leaf surfaces around roots, you know, understanding how to that
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:34.520]  the process of, you know, individually picking out a specific, you know, endo or ecto mycorrhizal
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.440]  fungi and choosing whether or not, you know, your company is able to grow all that up at
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.600]  a vat and make it into a, you know, a uniform product that people can apply.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:49.400]  You know, that's a completely different type of system than understanding the minutia of
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.200]  being able to figure out your own compost pile.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.400]  Right.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.800]  And knowing like the conditions of the place that you're at and the different materials
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.880]  that you have to create, you know, new soil, new materials to be able to feed the plant
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.600]  is sure.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.960]  Surely it does take longer and surely there are different types of facilities than others.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.320]  But, you know, if you're dealing with plants that are not healthy or sick, you know, or
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.680]  they don't have fans, you know, they don't have the right amount of air circulation.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.000]  There's like a very, there's lots of things going on.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.160]  Can be causing these issues in the first place.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.400]  You just want to watch out before they get started.
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:25.640]  Okay.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:31.560]  So I want to I want to change gears because we're we're we got a couple more topics to
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:31.960]  cover.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:37.800]  So one of the things I wanted to talk about was, you know, I had like my my mixed martial
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.640]  arts analogy where, you know, someone's the college wrestler at Ohio State and they get
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.640]  into MMA and, you know, when it comes to a ground game, they're amazing, but they need
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.760]  to learn how to box.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:55.720]  They need to learn how to kick box, jujitsu, maitai, all these other kind of languages
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.080]  to get in the ring and fight.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.680]  And in growing plants, I feel like, you know, there's not one right way of doing it.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.960]  And people are kind of gravitating towards different languages or methodologies.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:18.360]  And so, for example, Korean natural farming and we have our, hold on a second, we have
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.760]  our master Cho.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.440]  And so, Scott, I was hoping you could kick it off.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:34.840]  And I want to talk about kind of the roots of Korean natural farming in the 50s in Korea,
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:42.360]  you know, in a specific period and time and geography and how you've seen kind of the
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:53.960]  cannabis community embrace it, you know, here in the US and any issues or concerns you have
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.120]  with how you see people applying it practically here in the US.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:05.720]  Well, so, well, I'll start with the preface.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.760]  You know, I'm a huge advocate of any sustainable strategy.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.240]  I'm a huge advocate of any regenerative strategy.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:20.200]  I'm a huge advocate of anybody that wants to pursue low cost, sustainable solutions.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.880]  And I feel that, you know, I've got some friends that are big into K&F and they've met the
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.680]  Cho's and I feel like, you know, they were in essence trying to communicate the same
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:31.240]  message.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.720]  I think there's some obstacles with context with K&F that are really problematic in the
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.400]  regulated space, especially.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:47.000]  But then there's also some problems with just cultivation in general with some of the K&F
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.040]  for cannabis.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:54.280]  One of my biggest obstacles with it is, you know, there's the issue of having enough raw
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.120]  materials within your own property or farm to create your ferments.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.680]  And most humans are relying on some outside source to provide either the fruit, the vegetables
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.760]  or the milk or the sugar or whatever the inputs are used to make those K&F ferments.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:16.680]  And when we work in the cannabis cultivation space and we take flour and we take the
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.280]  And we take flour and we concentrate it into oils.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.120]  You know, the flour might pass, but the trim is going to fail and the oil is definitely
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:24.920]  going to fail.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.680]  And so we see phenomenons in other areas of cannabis where we take a large amount of
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:34.440]  biomass and concentrate it down into an oil or other product.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:39.160]  And you see pesticides, chemicals or compounds that were in that flour that become higher
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.680]  level of detection.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:48.360]  And so I think one of the major obstacles to K&F right now is, you know, Sarah and I
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.120]  have worked with large organic farms.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.360]  We've seen pretty good ideas to the cheating that goes along.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.760]  And, you know, there's study after study that shows, you know, I remember one where they
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.160]  took some produce from outside the United States that was deemed organic and like of
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.240]  the 12 products, all 12 had something that shouldn't be on it, you know.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.520]  And so we have an industry wide issue with contamination.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:16.040]  We have an industry wide issue with unregulated agricultural activities that are using other
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.320]  products that they shouldn't be doing.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:24.120]  That people in the effort to apply regenerative tactics to the cannabis space are then
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.920]  concentrating these pesticides and applying them to their plant.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.120]  So I'm kind of curious as to what maybe Lydia is seeing in her analytical work.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.280]  The obstacle with K&F is I suggest these concerns.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.560]  I have two people that do K&F and they go, well, I'm trying to save money, so I'm not
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:46.680]  going to spend $150 to test for pesticides on my ferments, which makes perfect sense.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.040]  That makes perfect sense, you know.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  But like I saw one the other day.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.920]  So I haven't had a K&F farm that then sends their their product in for testing because,
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.520]  yeah, it doesn't make sense financially.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.840]  But like I saw an Instagram the other day where a guy had a bunch of bananas and it
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.800]  had the sticker on it, the PLU sticker.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:09.320]  We could read it very clearly.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.960]  It was 4011, which is conventional banana.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.880]  And if there's a nine before it, it's organic.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.400]  And so dudes fermenting conventional bananas.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:24.360]  And if you look into how bananas are grown, like they actually take a plastic bag that
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.080]  is infused with pesticides and insecticides.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:32.200]  And then as the banana flower starts to shoot shoots, they wrap it in the pesticide and
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.440]  it grows inside of a pesticide bag.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.920]  Because they're so ridden with pests.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:43.960]  And so I think there's a there's a considerable disconnect between the agricultural process,
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.440]  the areas of contamination and how that then affects your plants.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.880]  And I just, you know, I haven't seen a K&F garden survive more than a couple of harvests
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.440]  in the regulated space because of these phenomenons.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.320]  But that's something that's nobody's talking about.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.840]  There's the issue of pesticides, but there's also the issue of sort of the way that they're
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:11.000]  using it ecologically and microbially speaking, and the balance of that is may or may not
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.840]  be scientifically sound as far as results and what they what they get with how they
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.320]  use it.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:26.280]  And then the other issue is in just being able to make the products consistently with
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.960]  knowing what that end product does.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.840]  Consistently with knowing what that end product does, they have alcohol in it, even, you know,
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:39.240]  those kinds of things that I think if you're using it in a commercial space or any any
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:43.800]  space, you actually need to sell the product and have a good harvester need that money
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:49.080]  from the from the harvest that it would be good to know and get that process down so
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.200]  you know what you're making.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.440]  Well, I think that, you know, I come from a business background like I come from what
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:00.040]  Sarah is saying is that, you know, part of being regenerative and sustainable is that
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.080]  your business needs to be regenerative and sustainable.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:08.840]  And so, you know, one of the core components of our business is helping farms stay in
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.320]  business.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:17.160]  And so in order for organic or sustainable practices or the regenerative movement to
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:22.440]  be sustainable and have an impact on the market, we need those farms to make it more than
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.560]  three harvests.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.640]  We need these farms to stay in business.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.480]  And, you know, I think that's been one of my gripes that people, other people in the
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.280]  industry have a large objection to how vocal I'm being.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:39.480]  But I don't think people would people understand where I'm coming from is that, you know,
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:44.360]  if there's bad advice given to farmers that puts farmers out of business, you know, that's
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.720]  not sustainable.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.520]  And we need to first be a business that can make it from harvest to harvest to harvest
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.840]  so that we can stick around, so that we can produce products on the market, so our voice
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:59.240]  can be heard, so that we can actually make a lasting impact on the market wide.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.320]  And if all of our farms are going out of business because they're concentrating banana
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.600]  pesticides, like that does not help sustainability.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:11.240]  I mean, OK, so go ahead.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.360]  Just quickly, Lydia, can you kill your video?
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:22.360]  Because I think your audio is going to come in a little less jerky.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:22.840]  There we go.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.320]  Perfect.
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.060]  Ta-da.
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:32.600]  OK, so I was just going to say, I mean, there are some tenets that go along with K&F, you
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.760]  know, that are similar to permaculture, that are similar to regenerative ag, is, you know,
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:43.240]  you're being able to use indigenous microorganisms, not using synthetic herbicides, pesticides,
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.200]  fertilizers, you know, improving your growing environment, creating a more sustainable
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.920]  culture as best you possibly can with your facility is going to lead you down the proper
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.600]  direction in the long run.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.560]  But, you know, we see a lot of issue.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.560]  I mean, if we're not even talking about cultivation, we see an issue, you know, with the
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.400]  sourcing of chocolate and using chocolate for edibles.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.360]  And then that results in, you know, heavy metals failure.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.960]  Or, you know, you're talking about Cavendish bananas.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.400]  You know, how many different types of bananas do they regularly ship around the world?
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.680]  Like literally three.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.560]  And the Cavendish are the ones that are the most popular.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.080]  And it's because, you know, we all know the reasons why ag works the way that it does.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.880]  But, you know, trusting that the source of the material that you're getting is going
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:36.440]  to be clean and that you're not going to have an issue is poor planning, you know,
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.440]  in no offense.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:42.760]  It's just not something that, you know, if it were me, even whenever I'm buying or
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.480]  recommending that someone purchase a new bat of pesticides, it's like you make sure that
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.280]  you get that material tested in a laboratory against the standards that you are going to
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.440]  be up against as a cultivation facility trying to get your product to market.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.160]  Because mistakes happen, you know, manufacturing mistakes happen.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:06.120]  There are problems where things get adulterated and they're not meant to be, even without
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.360]  it being the intention of the manufacturer.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.840]  And so that's just something that I've seen a lot of.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:16.280]  And, you know, as we all know, it's like the horror stories of using municipal compost,
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.040]  you know, and using that material to start a compost pile and what you're going to be
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:25.560]  dealing with is totally different than if all of your materials come from your land,
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.760]  which, as Scott was saying, turns into a pretty big sourcing issue.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.640]  Have you guys when you were...
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.680]  Sorry, sorry, Kevin.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.400]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:36.640]  Sorry.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.760]  Start over again, Kevin.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.400]  What I'm saying is that I see...
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.600]  The reason why I don't work with KNF is that I don't think I'm qualified at this time,
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:52.880]  where my understanding of using fermentations to drive my plants direction, to me, is too
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.760]  risky with this crop at the level that I need to perform.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.520]  But I know farmers that run KNF operations that are succeeding in terms of their products
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.200]  do pass COA and they're killer products.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:12.320]  But there are also some really dedicated, hard working, driven to understand those
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.840]  methodologies type people.
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:19.280]  And I think that the reason why you see it fall off is that someone throws that word
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.040]  on top of it, KNF, and automatically, oh, it must be, it's better.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.640]  And so it's, they approach it and they don't understand it.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.520]  And that's where you start sourcing regular bananas.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.680]  You find out that you don't have enough diversity on your property to do fermentation.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.480]  So you have to acquire material from somewhere else.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.640]  And now you're picking up stuff that's covered in insecticides, fungicides, whatever, because
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.400]  it's just ad products.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.440]  But I know people who are successful with it.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.720]  And the people that I think of that, the top of the food chain with that would be like,
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.640]  in our world, Chris Trump and the crew that rolls are under Chris, they're growing some
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.560]  fire and they're doing it.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.880]  But I think that it's way more in depth than people want to admit.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.040]  And that you have to say that there's a level of professionalism in every aspect of what
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.480]  we do as cultivators.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.720]  And you have to kind of define your success.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.800]  And you can have ideas of how other things operate, but you have to work with what you're
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.200]  good at.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.880]  And when you start to play a little of this, a little of that, whatever it said the other
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.760]  day, you guys were talking about, they were going to do the operation and they're only
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.240]  going to do 10% of the operation correctly.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.440]  The rest of the 90% of the operation was going to be half assed.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.640]  And we're going to just wing it.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.520]  That's the same situation here that just because it's organic doesn't mean it's safe.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.280]  And just because it's organic doesn't mean it's better.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.160]  It's just another method of working with it.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.440]  And I think that when people start to put the buzzwords on, it makes them feel like
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.120]  they're going to do something so like you're competing for who's most organic.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.800]  And that's not the point.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.480]  We're trying to deliver a crop to a customer consistently, profitably, and morally.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.880]  It's kind of like aquaponics.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:53.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.720]  Aquaponics, you got to have a water scientist on board.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.640]  And that's a whole other thing.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.160]  People want to do aquaponics.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:00.960]  And I think it's cool.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.680]  We did it at our office on a small level with Pucked Around and it was super difficult on
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.320]  that level.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.480]  So, you know, trying to scale up and I even watch vegetable farmers.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.520]  I've done a, my wife did a class in Florida with a main aquaponics farm that did it in
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:16.320]  greenhouses.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:22.000]  And it's totally impressive, but, and super sustainable, but the level of risk and how
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.320]  hard it is and how you got to be so sharp to do it is unbelievable.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.640]  And I can tell why people don't do it in cannabis.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.320]  I mean, it's just not.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.040]  No, they don't.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:31.540]  Yeah.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:38.240]  Steve Ray's in the good, you know, aquaponics Steve has the podcast and stuff, you know,
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.040]  Long Dreads dude.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:39.840]  Fertinponics.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.360]  Kid's a fish wizard.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.640]  Yeah, he's a fish wizard, man.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.360]  And, but the thing is what he was, you know, what I got from him on the last time we were
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.880]  hanging out was that he has to use like a composite system in order to get the yields
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.080]  that he needs because you can't drive the fertility from the fish end of it safely,
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:02.160]  or the fish end up becoming damaged from too much concentration of ammonium in their tank.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.720]  So you end up having a sick fish population if you want to drive the fertility.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:13.360]  So they have to use a hybrid system of mineral nutrition in some form of pot that's put into
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.680]  it, the irrigation system where it's aquaponics.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.760]  So it's not a pure aquaponics system.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:25.440]  So you can use aquaponics to drive wheatgrass, but wheatgrass has a far lower value of nutrient
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.720]  load than cannabis does.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.640]  You know, so every, every one of these systems is incredible.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.240]  If you just admit that they have limitations in specific areas and you address it, but
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.080]  people get romanticized with this shit.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.480]  And they do.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.840]  It's, it's, it's, it even, they get romanticized with scale too.
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:47.120]  Like once I got my Venlo, I'm going to be somebody I'm like, you can be fucking bankrupt.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.360]  It's that, that alone doesn't make you somebody it's just a tool.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.600]  And I think that these organic methodologies as fascinating as they are to me, because
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.320]  they are art.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.800]  You have to admit that, like I said, I don't have the ability to ferment everything in
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:07.440]  my woods and close my loops and do this operation in that way and make money, you know?
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.400]  So I use an organic bottom end that I, and I charge it so that I have a bacteria base
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:12.960]  that's solid.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.280]  So my base level of fertility is consistent and I can get analysis done.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.560]  So I know I'm within range.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.040]  And then I said, then I utilize that phyloscape technology to get around the environmental
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:25.440]  stress.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.880]  But I just admitted to myself that when I'm 70, maybe then I can be a fully closed loop
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.480]  farmer because I can start to grow all the products that are needed.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.960]  When I was in Columbia, they were growing all these products that they were using for
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.960]  their ag in general.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.960]  And once they got into cannabis, they just had to increase the acreage of the things
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:50.480]  that they were already producing to use as ferments because that's how they operated
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:51.680]  naturally.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:57.440]  So for them, K&F situation made total sense because they were already really following
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:00.080]  it, but it was more like Columbia natural farming.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.480]  They weren't copying, you know, Master Cho.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.960]  They were copying how they've been doing it since the dawn of time.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.160]  And I think you just have to be really honest about your situation and just say, look,
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.240]  there's a lot of ways to get to the destination.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.760]  Choose the one that's going to work for you.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.360]  And it's OK.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.840]  You're not in competition with each other for who's coolest with their grow technology.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.240]  Honesty isn't the first policy in cannabis, it seems.
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:26.720]  I don't know.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.560]  Ego is the best policy or something.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.280]  Either you don't want to spend shit and show everybody you can grow great weed or you want
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.840]  to spend everything and show everybody you can grow great weed.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.280]  There's not a lot of in between.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:50.160]  And the one consistent thing I would say what the biggest problem with K&F becoming extremely
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:55.200]  successful is that once something becomes popular, people don't want to fall out of
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.840]  that cool click and they don't want to admit they didn't go well.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.400]  And so everybody just keeps smiling and saying everything's fine like that meme when the
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.600]  thing's on fire because nobody wants to be nobody wants to be the guy that didn't do
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.320]  it well.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:15.440]  And that's that's systemic across the board, which I keep saying is the number one throttle
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.600]  on evolution of the industry wide.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.640]  As soon as people can be authentic and honest about how bad things aren't going, we can
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.720]  start talking about how good they can go.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.160]  And, you know, people aren't quite ready.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.920]  We're not big like that yet.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.000]  We're just not just it's not enough.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.560]  You know, when when shit's going wrong and strawberries, everybody's talking about it
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.760]  when shit's going wrong and sugar beets or grapes or anything.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.560]  I remember when I was a kid, they had this weird phenomenon going through sugar beets
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:50.400]  and it was wiping everybody out and all the farmers, all the, you know, companies, everybody
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.040]  rallies around this shit to fix it and figure out what the problem is and kind of do a reset.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.240]  It's just we're not in that category as much as that's the part of big ag we should be
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.160]  in. Everybody really gets together and really does these things.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.400]  And some of these people share these trials that are being done.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:13.280]  I know a guy that's really I mean, he's a big ag guy, moved into cannabis and he loves
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.480]  cannabis. So it's a great way of looking at it.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.040]  It wasn't a big ag guy trying to get in it for the money.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.520]  He was already in big ag, wanted to be into cannabis and bring what he knew and learn
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:28.400]  what he can. And so basically, you know, I actually was talking to Peter about this guy
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.080]  and say we should get him on the podcast.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.840]  And I talked to him about it the other day and he was like, fuck, no, I can't go on there.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.400]  The company I work for won't let me talk to anybody about shit, you know, and I was
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.760]  just like, well, that's, you know, fuck, you know, and he would be great.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:48.160]  You know, I've learned a lot and things like that, but if it's not the company itself,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.120]  well, it's the company itself holding back even good people within that company to share
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.640]  that information. So, I mean, it's kind of crazy how how bottled up it is or the.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.080]  Well, so just quickly sticking on our
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:09.040]  KNF topic, Chris Trump's actually confirmed for next week.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:18.960]  So, Scott, just quickly, can you touch on the use of rice to kind of to collect
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.920]  and grow things? You had mentioned something about rice and kind of concerns there.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:33.440]  And then also kind of how Master Cho, from your perspective, has evolved his way of thinking and
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.920]  what how he thinks about things differently. And now we're going to get on to Elaine Ingham and
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.760]  the Soil Food Web. Yeah, I think.
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:54.160]  You know, one of the things that I think is really missing from the KNF community is a little bit
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:45:00.880]  more solid foundation of the entirety of the Soil Food Web and how these things interplay in
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:08.960]  the root system of plants and lead to good results or bad results. You know, one of the objections
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:16.640]  that Dr. Lane Ingham has had is the concept that we're taking a strategy from Korea using rice,
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:22.560]  which is something that naturally exists in that region. They're using it to catch organisms and
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:29.520]  using that to be their inoculum, which I think Kevin nailed it like they're doing Columbia natural
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:35.680]  farming like, OK, so those Colombians have adapted these same principles of using the available
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.280]  materials in their environment to compost them or ferment them down that they can then use for
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:47.920]  healthy plant growth. And I think that's something that's being missed in the United States. And so
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:54.240]  when we take rice, which is something that doesn't naturally occur in the forest of the redwoods,
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.760]  and we put it into the root system or soil or mulch layer, whatever it is they're doing with it,
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.840]  they're harvesting organisms from that environment that are suitable to decomposing that material,
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:10.320]  not necessarily organisms that lead to healthy plant growth within that environment.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:18.400]  And, you know, the the community just objects to my objection and nobody really, you know,
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.800]  opens a textbook to even see what they're doing or, you know, takes Dr. Lane's microscope course,
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.080]  which, again, is contradictory to the principles of being low cost. So we just have this kind of
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:38.080]  obstacle where, you know, the entire community, from my standpoint, is neglecting a major portion
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.840]  of soil biology that's easily and readily found in textbooks that you can read up on and understand
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.600]  how these systems work, what these organisms do, and how they do or do not positively affect plant
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:55.520]  growth. They're kind of in the wizardry side, which I'm down for wizardry, but you can't live
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:02.880]  on wizardry and deny the law of gravity, you know. Well, even the tea brewers have a little wizardry
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.120]  too, a little sprinkle of this and a sprinkle of that. So, I mean, everybody gets their wizard
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.320]  hat on sometimes, but you're definitely going to break the internet on this one, Scott. You might
[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.720]  have to unblock some people or something. I don't even do, I don't even do, I don't even, I don't
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:22.560]  belong to the internet anymore. It doesn't, I know, you gotta get back on. No, I don't belong to the
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.200]  internet. I come from, I come from Southern California and I was raised by skaters, surfers,
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.960]  and gangsters where it wasn't real, it wasn't okay to be fake. Like, you got called fake every day if,
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:38.480]  you didn't drop in on the ramp properly. So, I'm not going to participate in Instagram. It's just
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:42.720]  like, it's like the bar scene of fake asses. I'm not trying to participate in that shit.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.360]  Like, I don't even, I don't got, post COVID, I got no time for this shit. I got no time for this shit.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:58.960]  None. All right. So, just quickly, give me your perspective on ferments and alcohol and Master
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:06.320]  Cho's evolved thinking and water. Can you, and go? Well, I guess, so what, so what Peter, I guess
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:12.960]  to catch up the live listener, I don't, I don't at all want to speak for the Cho's necessarily,
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.120]  but to my understanding, like the evolution of K&F has even been to like the Jadam or Jadam,
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.920]  which is a sun, which to my understanding, that's been communicated to me by K&F people,
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.920]  that's more of a water-based ferment. And so I was kind of shocked to hear that the people here
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.920]  in the United States trying to grow cannabis are doing like sugar-based ferments, which leads to
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:39.120]  a lot of alcohols. And it seems that the Cho family themselves are evolving to a water-based
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:45.440]  ferment. And, you know, I don't know the intricacies of that, but what I do see is an
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:52.000]  evolution from the Cho family on their own process. And so we need to say that same evolution within
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.640]  the cannabis space of their process, because, you know, my wife and I's job is as a lab and we were
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:05.200]  trained by a scientist to identify organisms, whether you're a K&F garden or a living soil
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.560]  garden, when we do this analysis and put these organisms into different categories, it's very
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:17.120]  clear indicator of success or bad outcome, regardless of the type of farm you're at. And,
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.560]  you know, there's these phenomena in the root zone that are very important. I was trying to dig
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.000]  through it last night, but we got so many damn textbooks at this house, I couldn't find it.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.360]  But there was this one, we were both flipping through books like, where's this quote? If you're
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:34.800]  going to quote science, you got to be accurate or else they rip you to shreds on the internet. But
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:41.840]  nonetheless, this whole paragraph was speaking about all the functions of plants that stop
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.600]  under an anaerobic condition in the root zone. And this is important because major metabolic
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:54.880]  functions stop working under decreased oxygen conditions and a whole bunch of other compounds
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.280]  are produced. And, you know, so we run this lab where people send us soil samples from the
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:05.440]  smallest garden to the biggest garden, living soil, non-living soil, hybrid, K&F, we get a lot of it.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:13.040]  And by far the weirdest plant symptoms come from the K&F sector. Like nobody that's doing a living
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:18.320]  soil farm calls me because their stem turned to gush and the plant fell over. Like nobody in
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:24.160]  hydroponics has ever called me like that. You know, there's some really, really weird plant
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.720]  phenomenon that are happening. And I believe it has something to do with the horrendous amount
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:30.960]  of alcohol that are being poured on the plants.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.000]  Yeah, I'm going to second that.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:40.170]  Yeah, yeah. It's just, it's because I like, I think what happens is the internet starts to rebut
[01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:46.090]  me saying that I'm saying everybody needs to be on my camp. And that's not what I'm saying at all.
[01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:51.290]  What I'm saying is if you're going to engage in organic activities and talk about biological
[01:50:51.290 --> 01:50:56.490]  concepts, you should familiarize yourself with these functions and foundations from readily
[01:50:56.490 --> 01:51:02.890]  accessible textbooks, in the form of a book, a book, a book, a book, a book, a book, a book, a book,
[01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:07.930]  in the library. Like it's not just my information. Like there's major complications with the
[01:51:07.930 --> 01:51:12.890]  strategy. And I'm not saying it can't be done because we've assisted some farmers that have
[01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:17.770]  had some pretty good success with a hybrid approach. And there's definitely an increase
[01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:22.570]  in terpenes. There's definitely an increase that comes with using some of these K and F functions,
[01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:31.290]  but you cannot ignore foundations of biological concepts that are just as absolute as the law
[01:51:31.290 --> 01:51:40.580]  of gravity. So that's my two cents. We would just say, you know, what, what to echo kind of
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:46.100]  what Lydia and what Kevin was saying, just whatever you're going to do, whatever system you
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:52.500]  resonate with, just make sure you take the time to quantify what it is you're doing. So you know
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:56.420]  why you're doing it and you don't waste that effort only to find at the end of the harvest
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:52:00.580]  that you failed for whatever pesticide that you didn't see coming down the pipe because you
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:05.140]  overlooked something. And that happens to all of us that happen. That's a major learning lesson for
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:10.580]  everyone. We're all in a great big learning lesson right now on that, but just quantify what you're
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:16.580]  doing. It, it take the time, spend the money to do it. Otherwise, you know, at the end of it, you could,
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:23.220]  you know, definitely miss something and, and fail testing and not get that money. Yeah.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:30.180]  If you don't fail testing, you just, you have an off crop. Right. The product isn't right.
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:34.900]  It doesn't have a home anymore. That's right. Yeah. The low shelf.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:43.540]  What I know, and that gives me the right production at that location. And so I think
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:48.100]  that direction always has to be specific where, you know, it's in terms of scalability. I never
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:52.500]  intend to scale that operation. That is always meant to be the size it is. And I'm cool with
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:58.820]  that for its duration. So I can use that as a specific, but anytime you go to any operation,
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:04.740]  you know, you have to identify the people have the ability first to even run and do what they intend
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:09.300]  to run and do. And I just think that there's people who are brilliant and they know how to
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:14.820]  make these systems work. And then there's shortcuts that occur because people don't understand that,
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:19.780]  that that isn't a shortcut that if you do this, you will get this problem as a result.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:25.780]  And there hasn't been enough experience in the U S for operators. I would be interesting to go
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.980]  to Korea and see people farm and ask them, you know, do you use K and F and what, like,
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.940]  how do they approach farming in their culture? Because that's what I get kind of caught up in
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:39.460]  is how does the, how do the people in these, these other countries that don't have commercial
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:44.580]  ag to the same degree we do in the way we approach it, how do they generate the products? That was,
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:49.060]  what was so interesting about the Colombian situation was they was scaling out the crops
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:53.780]  that they were going to grow to create the products they needed. So they had full control
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:58.180]  of what they did as an input. And they knew exactly why I asked them, why, why do you grow
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:02.660]  this? And he said, this is what we get from this. This is what we get from that. So they had a full
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:08.340]  strategy and had been based off the success. It's just that like, for me, my farm isn't,
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.340]  isn't developed to that degree yet, but the people that I know that are having success,
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:16.740]  when you go to their properties, it's almost like a plant Oasis to where they have so many
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:20.820]  different things growing in such a balance that they can create these balance systems.
[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:26.980]  And, you know, and I, I strive for that as my long-term goal, but I know that I can't jump
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:33.620]  right into it and succeed. It's too much of a risk. It has to be a progression. You know,
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:37.860]  like we talked about last time, you start off with something, you prove the concept,
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:42.340]  you increase it exponentially until you've reached fruit, you know, the full max potential.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.460]  But if you're just, if you're just moving through time and space running as fast as you can,
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:54.180]  you can run right into a fucking wall. Yeah, exactly. And, and our core message is
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:59.060]  we're trying to keep these regenerative farms in business. That's the thing. Like, you know,
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:03.540]  Kevin's taken the strategy he is because he knows it ensures his survival in the market.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:07.700]  Like we're trying to keep all these people in business so that we can make a broader impact.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:12.340]  You know, if we have all of our organic farms go out of business because they planted in a
[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:16.580]  first year hookah culture, like that ain't, that's not sustainable. Like we need to,
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:22.900]  we need to develop systems that are actually repeatable that actually lead to sustainability
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:27.700]  of your business. And that's, that's why I like Kevin so much. He's got a business mindset. I
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:32.980]  came from a business family as well. So yeah, I'm on the regenerative camp, but I'm always looking at
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:39.620]  from a small business survivability standpoint. Like we have to start with being successful
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:45.380]  and repeating that that's where sustainability starts for me. You know, and I, a lot of times
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:50.420]  I see farms make it to the commercial scale and a lot of them have hired us to help them.
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:55.460]  And they go so far to the regenerative that it's not practical for their survivability in the
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:56:01.060]  market. And we have to start with survivability in the market and inch our way towards full
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:07.300]  sustainability of our property, or it's just going to be a boneyard of stories of what almost
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:12.420]  was, you know, because I can tell you the hydro facilities, they're not slowing down.
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:18.580]  They're ramping up. And, you know, unless some of these regenerative farms figure out how to be
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:25.220]  profitable to make an impact on the market or how we community-wide figure out how to
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:31.060]  communicate strategies that lead to regenerative opportunities and sustainability, you know,
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.100]  what impact are we actually going to have and how do we actually get there?
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:39.300]  So, yeah, go ahead Peter.
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:42.820]  What if you have one last comment, because I was going to change topics. So go ahead.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:46.980]  No, change the topic. We can probably go all day.
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:54.820]  Okay. So I'm going to get my, I'm going to get a religious reference in. So talking about
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:57:01.700]  Elaine Ingham, Soil Food Web, there are a lot of Elaine disciples in this conversation today.
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:09.380]  But like if I think of Christianity, there are a lot of forks, right? Like you had Catholicism
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:14.500]  and then you had the Protestant Reformation where, you know, we agree with 99% of Catholicism,
[01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:17.860]  but we disagree with this one thing and we're going to go down our own path.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:26.740]  So can you all talk from your own perspectives, kind of where you have a different philosophy,
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:31.380]  where your philosophies are slightly or very different than Elaine's, like some of the
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:37.220]  differences between how you see her approaching things and your personal approaches?
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:44.820]  Well, I guess to tie it into your religious thing is within the agricultural sector, people are as
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:50.580]  devout as religious people are, and, you know, each religion lives and dies by their uniqueness.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:59.860]  And nonetheless, so we're, I think we're personally in a stage where we're kind of going from this,
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:07.620]  you know, religious approach where it's us against them. It's, you know, you're seeing
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:14.420]  this mineral analysis against biological analysis. Like Sarah went to the Bionutrient Food Convention
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:19.540]  last year and met up with Todd Harrington, another big soil food web guy from the East Coast,
[01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:23.860]  and they went and talked to John Kemp and introduced themselves. And in that next segment,
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:28.340]  John Kemp is talking about how you don't need to measure soil organism populations, you know,
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:32.980]  and it's just, Elaine kind of does this thing. I love and adore Elaine. I would not be here
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:40.260]  without her, but she responds in kind with all you need is biology. And I think where we're unique
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:47.220]  is that we incorporate everything. I come from a very qualified group of hydroponic cultivators
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:54.260]  in Southern California. I absolutely take that into my living soil strategies, you know, and so
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:59:00.180]  you cannot... Just quickly, what are some of the things you've adopted from the hydro community?
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:05.220]  Oh, it's the mentality. You know, growing up in Southern California, like,
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:10.100]  like you couldn't be fake about it. Like you had to actually do it or you had to
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:15.940]  completely be quiet. And so in the organic sector, it's much more important to be the guru,
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:21.940]  know the guru, or regurgitate the guru, and actually be good at growing pot. And that's the
[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:28.180]  biggest disabled aspect of the organic sector is it's much cooler to be like, you can cut down
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:32.820]  three quarters of your garden each year and you still be a guru. Like that's insane to me from
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:37.940]  my hydroponic background, like you had to be good or nobody even listened to a word you said. And so
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:45.940]  I've taken that mentality and tried to be as regenerative as possible. And, you know, you know,
[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:51.220]  just take a holistic approach. Sarah comes from medicine. My family's in medicine. I was raised in
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:57.060]  a hospital with my single mom. I spent a lot of time sitting in a nurse management office,
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:04.820]  listening to patient information prior to the HIPAA. Nonetheless, but, you know, we take a
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:09.780]  holistic approach. We take a science-based mathematical approach that I can approach it
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:15.620]  without emotions. And I can make a quantified decision that leads to a result that's either
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:21.220]  predictable or unexpected, but at least measured so that we can come to a result that can be
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:29.700]  repeated. So Elaine is biology only, the mineral people are mineral only, and we do as full effort
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:35.700]  on every aspect as we can. And then we foliar feed like we're doing hydroponics. Holistic biology.
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:42.180]  Yeah. And so, so what happens is as there's a disruption in one component of the system, so like
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:48.900]  in organics or living soil, the soil minerality moves at such a slow pace that if you're correcting
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:54.500]  a mineral imbalance, you might take two or three harvests to get that under control. You need to
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:59.220]  balance that with your soil feeds or your foliar feeds. And that's why all these water only people
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:04.820]  either don't do water only, or they fail saying water only is because the soil moves so slow. You
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:11.700]  have to, you have to correct to the context of the situation with soil feeds or foliar feeds
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:17.940]  while using the biological population as an indicator. The main anchor of what we do is
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:24.100]  making sure that nothing we do reduces biological populations. And I think that's what makes Sarah
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:30.580]  and I actually unique is that lots of people say biology, everybody says soil food web, they all
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:36.900]  hashtag it, but like, by what measure are you doing any of these things? And we govern all decisions
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:41.380]  based on what my wife measures through the microscope. If something I come up with that
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:48.020]  I think is a good idea, wipes out populations, it obviously was not a good idea from a biological
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:55.620]  standpoint because we harmed the most sensitive biological members in the system. And so it might
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:00.900]  still lead to a yield, but if you're compromising soil organisms, you're also compromising plant
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:09.380]  health because it is also a biological system. And I would say just to kind of touch on your
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:16.580]  your religious little opening there is that, you know, the first law of chaos is that the truth is
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:22.260]  different for everyone. And that's the beauty of science is that science can unify us on what we
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:27.860]  can all, you know, achieve if we adhere to certain principles, whether you're KNF, whether you're
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:34.420]  soil food web, whether you're hydro, anything, there's certain principles that underlie biological
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:38.500]  systems. And so that's all we're trying to say is just quantify it, know what you're doing,
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:45.060]  and integrate that into your IPM strategy as your number one thing you do is get that system in
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:49.780]  place that you know what you're doing nutritionally to support that plant. And if there's something
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:56.580]  that's been going wrong, a messenger being sent to you via a bug or a disease, then you start
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:01.860]  looking, okay, where is the crack in the system? What are, you know, is it nutritionally based?
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:07.300]  Are we pretty sound there? Do we need to do more analytics there? Do we look at, like Lydia was
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:11.540]  saying, do we need to, we're seeing a certain pathogen? Do we need to look at our water system?
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:16.420]  Are we cleaning that enough? Just those kinds of sound principles, but just to wrap that all in.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:22.980]  The only real issue that, you know, Elaine and I, because I respect the shit out of her, I think
[02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:28.260]  she's a brilliant woman. But, and she came to me to speak to me about, remember, we had talked about
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:33.940]  driving those viruses out of those plants in the earth boxes. And so she was fascinated because
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:40.580]  that's anaerobically driven using lactic acid and sub-irrigation. And so what we came to was that,
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:46.820]  what's the definition of aerobic? Because really it's a certain parts per million of oxygen present.
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:52.260]  And so in this gray area of interpretation, there was which method is it considered an
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:58.340]  anaerobic delivery or aerobic delivery? And that's where, like my mom was a scientist and she's
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:04.340]  brilliant, but she always made sure I remembered that you used to be burned alive because the sun
[02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:08.500]  rotated around the earth. And if you didn't say that they're crucified. And that was pretty current
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:14.580]  science at the time. And so she always kind of let me understand that we only see snapshots
[02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:20.340]  and we know as much as we can right now. And we have to work with that. And it doesn't mean that
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:25.220]  we don't know, but it's, it means that's our limit of understanding. And I think when you get into
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:30.740]  this religious dogma, what happens is you start to take away reason and you just follow blindly.
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:36.900]  And what you need to be able to do is take the education from the individual and understand
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:42.740]  how to apply it. And if other people are having success with contrary methods, you need to
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:48.980]  investigate and try to find out what is the common success of all methods, because something is
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:54.420]  occurring that's succeeding. And so I think that, you know, with what we're all trying to do is
[02:04:54.420 --> 02:05:00.820]  understand there's an art and a science we're trying to merge. And we only know so much about
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:06.500]  either. And I think that's where Dr. Ingham gets jammed is because I don't think she could be any
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:09.860]  smarter at what she is. I mean, she's, if you've spent some time with them and she's brilliant,
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:17.460]  and she's got such a nice rhythm with it, it's, she lives that shit, but that's what she knows.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:22.580]  And then when you run something that you don't have the same understanding, but it's doing something,
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:27.540]  it can't be wrong. And so it's really trying to bring everyone into the same area to say,
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:32.340]  hey, look, with all our understandings, we maybe can get our arms around part of the problem.
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:38.260]  But none of us are so comprehensive that we control the information on a thing because
[02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:45.620]  the thing is so complex. Right. So that's the only. And it's always evolving. And that's what
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:50.500]  she always says. But what Scott ended up doing and why I kind of why I mean, I appreciate what
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:55.860]  he's done. And actually, there was a guy that was one of the advisors. Elaine has these advisors.
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:01.620]  These are the people that go and do all her work all the way through. And, you know, for the street
[02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:06.820]  explanation of things is what I'm given right now. Not the scientific like you guys, but
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:14.340]  basically within her group of advisors, they all perform her work and like the disciples,
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:19.140]  so to speak. And Scott and Sarah, those have gone through that process. And there was somebody
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:24.740]  before them, a homie of mine named Ian Davidson. He started a company called Biologic Crop Solutions
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:30.580]  and a lot of people use, but he ended up moving to Hawaii and getting some other stuff. And Scott
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:35.780]  and Sarah, when I met Scott, he was basically jumping on as an advisor and learning and doing
[02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:41.940]  and saying the stuff where Ian stopped his work and moved into something else. And one of the
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:48.500]  examples is going from brewing compost teas to doing these extracts. But what Scott did and Sarah
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:54.340]  is they took her information and geeked out on it and went deep and deep into cannabis. You know,
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:58.900]  a lot of people kind of fuck with Scott sometimes going, do you grow and stuff? And I'm smoking some
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:04.260]  of his weed right now, but he's been on big facilities doing big work. And I've been to those.
[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:10.980]  And even Kevin, you've recommended something to a farm to have me go check out. And then after I do
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:15.860]  my work, I recommend Scott next. You know, the place is blowing up. And so at the end of the day.
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:21.620]  Yeah. And so at the end of the day, what's happened and what Scott decided to do was create
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:26.980]  those events. And we did them with Elaine because Elaine was kind of like, you know, something that
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:31.860]  really drove a lot of people to get in there. But Scott's data that had been collected in cannabis
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:36.900]  was the real eye opener. And I remember the first one we did, Elaine was at the edge of her seat,
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:42.500]  like, holy shit. By the third one, I don't know if she can handle the spotlight that Scott was
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:46.820]  taking anymore. And she kind of started deteriorating those events. And then we had
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:52.820]  Kevin jump on with us. And we had some good ones after that. And then eventually, I'm no longer
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:57.940]  with the situation that we were doing to create those. And so subsequently, a lot of that has
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:04.020]  stopped. But the information was insane. That was coming out of that stuff. And that's what I
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:10.820]  clinged on to was Elaine seeded, but Scott and Sarah sprouted. And it was much easier for me to
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:15.780]  understand because I've read her papers or looked at some of her shit. And I don't even know,
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:21.460]  I don't even speak that language. Yeah. Well, that's what you said. Like, I called you on the
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:28.500]  phone back in like 2013, trying to get some compost tea brewing products. I got you on the phone. And
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:34.100]  I was asking like really specific questions about Dr. Elaine, and regards to my family's farm. And
[02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:38.180]  you're like, look, kid, if this is important to you, like you got to find this Dr. Elaine woman
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:42.660]  and figure out what she's talking about. And then you must have had a bowl or two because you're
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.300]  like, look, man, all these cannabis people, they keep saying soil food web, but I don't know
[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:51.620]  anybody that's measuring it like this woman is saying it, you know. And so if you like growing
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:56.660]  pot and you think you can swing a microscope, like get down. And I took that really seriously.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:02.580]  And I did do that. And I don't think the market at wide really understands the level of analysis
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.820]  that we can and have provide an aggregated and distilled down into really functional
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:12.660]  advice. And it's just, I think it's a symptom of the market's not quite ready yet. Still,
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:17.540]  you know, we, well, we were trying to take that to big ag too. And so I had already spent a shit
[02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:23.380]  load of time spraying walnuts with, with compost tea when, oh, we needed to get it into the
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:29.060]  irrigation system, spraying it was barely doing shit. And when you called me, you were like, yo,
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:33.860]  we're going to set up this thing and spray these fields or hay or whatever fields. And I was like,
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:40.020]  no, no, you got to drench that shit. That's what we did. Yeah. And so basically it kind of evolved
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:44.980]  from, you know, like a lot of ball from there. But, you know, again, it was, you know, the
[02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:49.700]  comprehension of these things and the way that was laid out to us, everybody that I knew. And
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:56.260]  at that time was, we only sprayed compost tea, you know, you maybe put a little into the soil, but
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:03.140]  it was a big spray thing at the time. Well, but what we did was we, we did the data points. So
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:07.700]  both Sarah and I are capable of doing the full microscope process. And we showed up to a farm.
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:12.660]  That's exactly what we did. And to my knowledge, we're the first people to really provide that to
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:17.940]  the market. And we went crazy because both, you know, Sarah comes from medicine where lives are
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:23.140]  on the line. And if you don't document properly baselines, then, you know, a lot of problems come
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.780]  from that. And I had a construction business that had a lot of liability working in schools.
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:32.500]  So when we got into commercial cannabis officially, you know, the first thing we did was
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:36.900]  establish all those baselines so we could know where we're starting. So we can know where we're
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:42.740]  going. And what we ended up finding was, you know, one particular facility had like a perpetual
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:48.420]  harvest model. And we came in and took samples of each of the populations that were on this two
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:56.500]  week cycle. And we were able to drill down to a decision that was made by the cultivator that
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:11:01.940]  turned things into the direction of mold. And so as far as four years ago, we were able to come
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:08.260]  into a facility and within 48 hours, figure out the week that led to all the problems and what
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:14.020]  that decision was. And I just don't think people are still really ready to wrap their mind around
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:18.500]  that that's an analytical technique that can be executed and what they can learn from it. But,
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:24.180]  you know, the people that have figured out how to use it, you know, back to square one of not saying
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:29.140]  anything about it. And so people don't know that it exists because the people that have used it most
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:36.020]  definitely don't champion it. You know. Well, the thing that Elaine deals with more than anything
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:41.540]  else is that, you know, she came in where, you know, the papers didn't exist on any of this
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:47.620]  material, you know, like soil microbiology wasn't a common discussion. Certainly wasn't anything
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:53.620]  that was able to be communicated to the point that you can have a conversation in an eight or six
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:57.620]  hour class in one day and give people more information than they had ever been exposed
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:01.940]  to in their entire life. You know, and they've been cultivating or farming for a real long time.
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:07.540]  So, you know, and she also comes from this point of I really like Elaine. I think she's phenomenal,
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:11.380]  just like everyone else has said. But, you know, her position, at least originally,
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:16.740]  was very defensive against traditional ag. You know, she has a lot of people
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.860]  that are trying to argue with her. She has issues with, you know, grant money and, you know,
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:26.740]  who's funding the university that she was working for at the time and how all of that's like changed
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:32.260]  and modified in her life and how that's impacted and driven her to, you know, author over 100
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:39.140]  papers and really, you know, initiate the science in this realm in a whole new way. And, you know,
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:42.180]  just like I said earlier about the gut microbiology, this is something that we're
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:47.780]  going to be watching for, you know, decades to come. All of the different tiny little intricacies
[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:52.660]  of how these microorganisms work together, how they work with the minerals, how it all like works
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:58.020]  with pH and gets into the plant and how all that can be very finicky, you know, especially with
[02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:03.620]  cannabis strain by strain or with different species of plants in general. This is just
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:08.500]  something that's going to be developing over time. And as we all know, you know, what works
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:13.140]  for some person, you know, one guy doesn't work for the next one, you know, five miles down the road.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:17.300]  And there's a series of reasons why that's the case. And so you just have to tune into your own
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:24.100]  farm, what you've got going on, what the benefits, you know, what the drawbacks are of your
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:28.580]  current situation and research it to the best of your ability. Because that's the other thing too,
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:31.780]  is like we live in a culture where everybody just wants to look at something on Instagram
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:37.140]  instead of actually reading a paper. And then if they actually do go read papers,
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:41.860]  they don't know how to determine whether or not this paper is sound, if it has, you know,
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:46.580]  if there's a large enough sample size, if there's any statistical relevance to what's being spouted
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:53.140]  at the end in a conclusion. And, you know, taking those jumping off points, you know, Elaine does
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:57.220]  really, you know, spectacular science, but taking the jumping off points that she's providing and
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:14:02.100]  the stuff that Scott's giving and putting it into practice in your own facility to the best of your
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:06.340]  ability and coming out with something that was better than what you had started with before,
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:12.260]  you know. And I think that we're seeing that, you know, the quality of the material just increases
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:18.820]  day by day, which is great. Context is everything. It needs to be appropriate to your context,
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:26.180]  what you're capable of. Yeah. So just quickly, I'm cognizant that it's 4.15 in the afternoon.
[02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:34.420]  I had two more topics, but I don't know if you guys, basically the two topics were for Lydia's
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:45.300]  soil biosolarization and then the CDF separate topics, CDFA just dropped their proposed organic
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:50.740]  certification standards for the state of California. Do you guys want to, and then I had
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.260]  some viewer questions, but do you guys want to wrap or do you want to tackle one of those?
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:59.060]  I'm down for anything. I'm committed to finishing the process. So.
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:05.300]  Well, which one, which one do you guys want to start with? Lydia, do you want to,
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:08.420]  do you want to introduce us to solar biosolarization?
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:15.220]  Well, if we start with the OCAL organic regulations that came out, then you can clip
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:23.300]  us on our commentary time and we can move into the soil biosolarization and it'll keep us at a,
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:28.660]  cause I know that we could all wax poetic on our own personal thoughts about the fact that this has
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:32.900]  come out. So I would start there and then I'm ready to talk about. All right, so let's do it.
[02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:47.480]  So give me one second to queue us up. I could go faster, but all right, so here we go. So we have,
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:56.040]  let me just make sure that I am, there we go. All right. So we have proposed regulations for
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:01.240]  certification of comparable to organic standards for cannabis in the state of California.
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:06.520]  Anybody want to give their, actually, Scott, I'd just like to start with you.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:14.600]  Give me your thoughts. So I read it before the podcast and it seems very similar in nature to
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:21.320]  what we deal with in agriculture. I guess to be clear and concise is yeah, we work in the organic
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:27.560]  sector, but I'm not an advocate of organic certification. You know, we've worked for large
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:34.280]  scale organic farms that use glyphosate right in front of us so casually, you know, so to me,
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:45.560]  I view it as unnecessarily restrictive, which will keep you into a certain type of problem set.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:53.560]  So I don't believe that it's not necessarily that beneficial. It's unnecessarily difficult
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:58.280]  to navigate as a farmer. And I think it's a far better goal that is community-wide.
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:04.760]  We determine a new category that has merit with the public that we inform them on like living soil,
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:10.680]  or like what Elaine is doing with biologically complete, because, you know, there's certain
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:15.400]  products that we use that are too much of a hassle to get organically certified because
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:19.240]  of intellectual property on how they're created and how the nutrients are chelated.
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.080]  And they're perfectly fine, but because they're not stamped, you can't use them. But if you do
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:28.680]  use them, you don't have pest issues and don't need pesticides. So that's kind of the problem of
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:36.040]  it. You know, I'm not a big advocate of the entire process personally. And I think it's better to
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:41.720]  just farm really respectably and don't worry about a label to confine yourself further to further
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:49.240]  regulation and scrutiny. You know, I was excited to read it because, you know, you always want to
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:56.760]  see the positive, but you get to about page 30 of the 66 pages. And from that point to the end,
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:03.560]  it's punitive. It's these are all the punishments and costs you will incur if you do not comply with
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:10.120]  this. And it was only like maybe 10 pages of material that directed you on what they wanted
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:16.760]  you to do. And then it really referred to addendum lists of licensed products that had been certified
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:23.480]  by somebody who paid to be able to be in that position. But it was the half of the document is
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:28.600]  punitive. And so I read it and I said to myself, I said, you know, I was going to go grab,
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:33.960]  I wanted to go for this because I was like, hey, this would be beautiful. We can create this
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.640]  beautiful situation. It's accepted. People understand it. But as you go through it, you realize that
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:48.360]  it's another punishment and an extraction in pricing. And so if you start your certification
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:53.880]  program early, it's this much. But each year you go forward and wait to begin the program,
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:19:00.040]  it increases the cost of the actual program. So it's if you're not a first adopter, you're going
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:08.040]  to get taxed two or three years into it. And there was costs on it that was confusing, but it was
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:12.120]  the lesser, the greater of a hundred dollars or 25 percent of your gross.
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:19.880]  And so I'm trying to understand how they intend to extract the monies from you and how they will
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:26.200]  structure the fees. And it gets to the point where it started making me wonder, did I want to even go
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.160]  through it? Exactly. And I was somebody that was really like, hey, you know, this is something that
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:36.840]  could be positive because it could give us some form of recognition in the in the agricultural
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:41.480]  world as a clean product, because we have such a stigma, even though we're really the cleanest
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:47.560]  product in the market, which is the ironic part. Yeah. Being certified, does that mean you're not
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:51.800]  going to fail a test, though? I mean, you can be certified, whatever, and get a heavy metal
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:59.480]  fucking drift. And so then what is it going to cause? Is it going to get more money? Because
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:05.160]  I don't know what certification has got fetched more money because the price of weed is the price
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:10.280]  of weed. You can add value. There's a story behind it. You can get more volume sold, maybe.
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:16.920]  But is any certification saying, OK, boom, now you get this much more money? Not yet.
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:23.000]  Not yet. So if you compare it to what's going on in the industry already with Dragonfly Earth
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:29.320]  Medicine doing the Dempura certification, then you have EnviroCan. And then there's Clean Green.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:35.160]  There's a series of different certifications that are being offered. What's Bronner's, Lydia?
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:43.560]  I'm sorry? What's Bronner's, sir? Sun and Earth. Sun and Earth. Yeah, that one as well. Exactly.
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:49.320]  And so there's multiple options for what's going on in the industry. I really like Dragonfly Earth
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:54.600]  Medicine. Kelly and Josh really have it together. I really like everyone that runs with their crew,
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:00.200]  just as a personal aside. But you have people in the industry that have been in the industry for a
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:06.360]  long time that respect the plant, that are here for reasons that go far beyond just trying to
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:12.520]  make a bunch of money and run a large-scale process. But you're going to be seeing adopters
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:17.160]  of this just like they're a biodynamic. There's people that are doing organics, people that are
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:24.280]  doing biodynamics in the regular ag world. And it's a small percentage, even still. And so just
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:28.120]  like you guys are saying, from a laboratory perspective, just because something's organic
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:32.840]  doesn't mean it passes. People go through and they get organic products to make their edibles,
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:40.600]  like I was mentioning earlier, and they can still fail the testing requirements that are put out
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:44.920]  and mandated by the state for cannabis products to get to the market. So it's one of those things
[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:48.600]  where I do think it's really important that if you have any interest in the game, you should
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:54.360]  definitely be looking at the OCAL proposed regs. You can make comments on it until July 7th,
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:59.960]  which I encourage anybody that has a commentary about that specific topic to please submit it,
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:03.240]  because they really do seem to listen, is what I've noticed in California.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:09.720]  But whether or not someone decides to adopt that or not doesn't necessarily mean that their product
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:13.560]  is going to be better or worse than another person's. And then additionally, as we're
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:19.320]  watching the Appalachians project unfold, that started years ago, and they still haven't come
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:25.400]  into a reality with that yet. Terroir and the amount of plants that are actually grown in
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:31.640]  native soil versus those that are not, which is a fairly large swing between the two.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.760]  And it's just something to really be considerate of. Again, those organic certifications,
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:42.680]  they can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars, the amount that they're going to be taking off
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:46.840]  your back end when we're already dealing with such difficult tax hazing issues in the cannabis
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:52.440]  industry anyway. And whether or not that's right for somebody's business is a personal decision.
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.560]  But I do think that it's interesting that after a couple of years, they finally came out with it.
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:03.000]  I think the naming convention is pretty interesting that they're actually using the word
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:09.400]  organic certification through the state of California's Department of Agriculture. And so
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.640]  I think that at least within the realm of this conversation, it's going to be interesting to
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:16.920]  watch all of that come into reality, no matter what it looks like.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:26.440]  Yeah. One of the hydroponic facilities we work for has an employee that's a lobbyist,
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:30.600]  and they're actually very active in the OCAL. And so I think what the organic people need to
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:36.200]  understand is that they need to be as active in their own certification as their opposers are.
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:44.110]  And I would start there. In real ag, it's mostly paperwork, though. It's not a lot of testing. I
[02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:50.270]  mean, they do check to see where you store all your shit. But I mean, my farm was certified
[02:23:50.270 --> 02:23:57.150]  organic. I went through the whole process to do farmers markets many years ago. And it's just a
[02:23:57.150 --> 02:24:02.190]  big paperwork thing. You know, they come look at the farm and go right on. You know, but other than
[02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:06.990]  that, there's no soil testing that they did, at least, you know, through any of the processes I
[02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:11.150]  went through. So I mean, it's a watered down at best.
[02:24:16.570 --> 02:24:22.890]  All right. So have we have we covered the organic certification standards for the CDFA?
[02:24:23.610 --> 02:24:28.090]  Yeah, I think Kevin had the best distinct description of the first three pages are
[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:33.450]  definitions. There's nine pages of what to do, and then 33 pages of how much it's going to cost you
[02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:37.770]  and how much trouble you're going to be like, I think that tells you most of what you need to know
[02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:45.210]  right there. Okay, so just quickly, Lydia, do you have time to give a quick intro to solar
[02:24:45.210 --> 02:24:53.530]  by solarization? Yeah, I do. I have a I have a moment. So so wait, before you go before you
[02:24:53.530 --> 02:25:00.170]  start it. Let me cut to the one graphic I could pull up so people know what we're talking about.
[02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:03.770]  Does that is that a reasonable graphic for what we're talking about?
[02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:10.010]  Look at those fun words, digest states and mesocosms.
[02:25:12.090 --> 02:25:17.130]  Yes, this is okay. So this is bad. This last image is real helpful. So basically, the the
[02:25:17.130 --> 02:25:23.930]  general process and thought that we're talking about here is the the use of different types of
[02:25:25.050 --> 02:25:32.170]  plastics to cover up to cover soil and heat it up to a certain temperature for a certain number
[02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:40.250]  of days that basically thermally and activates weed seeds and pests and disease within a certain
[02:25:40.250 --> 02:25:47.770]  you know, depth of the soil surface. And so we were chatting about this. Privately, one of our
[02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:56.090]  other IPM friends in the cannabis space had shared a slide from Jim Stapleton's work over at UC Kearney
[02:25:56.090 --> 02:26:03.530]  Ag Research. And so basically, you know, this is a practice that you see implemented in like
[02:26:03.530 --> 02:26:08.330]  strawberry fields. So when you drive past a field and, and there are furrows and then in between the
[02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:13.930]  furrows, there are these sheets of plastic that are just covering like long, long rows.
[02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:21.450]  And these big fields, essentially, the purpose and the point is to, like I said, like knock down
[02:26:21.450 --> 02:26:26.730]  anything that would be causing a difficulty in managing pest or disease. And once the actual
[02:26:26.730 --> 02:26:33.930]  crop comes up, they utilize this type of thing when it comes to managing spring mix, you know,
[02:26:33.930 --> 02:26:38.650]  like the greens, you know, there's a zero tolerance policy for having weeds in your spring mix crops,
[02:26:38.650 --> 02:26:45.450]  right? But you can't go through and hand weed, you know, acres and acres is exactly right, right there
[02:26:45.450 --> 02:26:51.610]  that you just put up, you can't go hand weed acres of spring mix, it's just something that's,
[02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:55.050]  you know, it's a limiting factor, the number of people that you're going to have to do that,
[02:26:55.050 --> 02:26:59.050]  you know, their capacity to get it right every time, like it's pretty intense. And so
[02:26:59.770 --> 02:27:08.010]  what's been going on with the biosolarization is essentially taking the soil solarization topic,
[02:27:08.010 --> 02:27:13.450]  you know, the whole background of heating up the soil to inactivate these, these things that you're
[02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:20.410]  not wanting in your, your system. And then the bio part is adding organic material into that
[02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:26.650]  heating process. And as the organic material decomposes, there are toxic breakdown products
[02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:31.770]  that eliminate soil pest organisms. You know, we're talking about something that's as little
[02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:37.930]  as an addition of 5% of something like they tested tomato pumice, white wine, grape pumice,
[02:27:37.930 --> 02:27:44.170]  and red wine, grape pumice, saying that the tomato byproducts from the traditional, you know,
[02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:50.810]  food ag was really helpful in eliminating some of these plant pathogens that they were concerned
[02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:55.450]  about. But you know, as with everything, it does have limitations on its effectiveness.
[02:27:56.010 --> 02:28:01.770]  You know, you wouldn't want to complete the this type of solarization and then move all of your
[02:28:01.770 --> 02:28:07.370]  soil or till it or, you know, get it all mixed up because you're only inoculate or you're only
[02:28:07.370 --> 02:28:15.450]  really inactivating those first top inches, you know, six inches ish of, of topsoil up top. And
[02:28:15.450 --> 02:28:22.490]  then the kind of the thought process is that the beneficial organisms, you know, earthworms and
[02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:30.090]  other, you know, fungi, bacteria that, you know, they're used to a larger range and change in their
[02:28:30.090 --> 02:28:35.450]  environment. They're, they're much more like plastic and capable of, of managing environmental
[02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:41.050]  stress and change differently than perhaps disease and pest organisms that are going to
[02:28:41.610 --> 02:28:51.210]  more similarly need an environment that matches their host plant. So, you know, there's, there's,
[02:28:51.930 --> 02:28:58.570]  there's lots of information that UC Davis, UC Kearney has put up. There's other scholarly
[02:28:58.570 --> 02:29:04.650]  papers that had put out, been put out about this. You know, when I worked for BASF, we would put all
[02:29:04.650 --> 02:29:11.850]  of our, all of our media into this like deep, deep freezer and freeze everything for a period of
[02:29:11.850 --> 02:29:17.370]  time. And then have to take out the big bales of material and let them thaw before we use them in
[02:29:17.370 --> 02:29:22.730]  the greenhouse for pesticide research. And so it kind of works on the polar opposite end is that
[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:29.290]  if you create this like massive environmental change or in temperature shock that you can reduce,
[02:29:29.370 --> 02:29:34.810]  you know, pathogens and pests and disease. And I bet that, that Scott and Eric and Kevin and
[02:29:34.810 --> 02:29:38.170]  Sarah have all seen this employed, especially down in Salinas Valley
[02:29:38.970 --> 02:29:44.170]  and other places where there's a lot of, a lot of crops and a lot of dirt instead of soil.
[02:29:48.570 --> 02:29:54.250]  For sure. There's a cannabis company that does like a whole steaming thing actually. And,
[02:29:55.210 --> 02:29:59.530]  and I don't know what they bring in to do it, but they tarp everything over and actually
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:09.130]  inject steam in there. Wow. Yeah. This is where I really started to defer to what I learned from
[02:30:09.130 --> 02:30:13.930]  Dr. Lane and that like all the problems live in decreased oxygen conditions and all the
[02:30:14.570 --> 02:30:18.970]  good things live in the increased oxygen conditions. And there's like a gray area in
[02:30:18.970 --> 02:30:25.050]  the center. And, you know, I, I think what's been missing on the growing community at wide,
[02:30:25.050 --> 02:30:30.090]  whether it's big ag or the small cannabis farmers that, you know, there's aerobic strategies for
[02:30:30.090 --> 02:30:34.970]  dealing with problems. And I think that's something that Dr. Lane has discovered and
[02:30:34.970 --> 02:30:41.930]  communicated that hasn't really settled in with the market too much. You know.
[02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:48.010]  But this, it still wouldn't, this, this sounds like you're also dealing with weed seeds, which is a,
[02:30:48.570 --> 02:30:54.410]  a pretty good strategy for dealing with that. Are they're doing this in preparation then on these
[02:30:54.410 --> 02:31:00.410]  rows for, for doing this? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And the thought process is that a plant soil,
[02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:04.330]  or the soil solarization can take four to six weeks, you know, at a certain temperature during
[02:31:04.330 --> 02:31:09.130]  the hottest part of the year, you have to have, you know, bright sun, really high temperatures,
[02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:14.730]  And what they're implementing the bio-solarization is they're trying to reduce that time. And then
[02:31:14.730 --> 02:31:20.010]  also reduce the temperature window requirement. And so they're changing something that's like
[02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:25.690]  four to six weeks of, of your, your field being down, you know, not, not cultivating anything
[02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:31.210]  to making it, you know, seven to 10 days and achieving a similar effect without going anaerobic.
[02:31:31.210 --> 02:31:34.330]  Like Scott mentioned, right. You don't want to like drench your soil and then put a big,
[02:31:34.890 --> 02:31:38.570]  it sounds like by adding, it sounds like what they're saying is by adding plant material,
[02:31:39.130 --> 02:31:43.130]  they shorten the duration of what's needed to be effective because they're
[02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:48.570]  composting in place essentially. So by adding the grapes or the, you know, any of the
[02:31:49.210 --> 02:31:53.770]  agricultural crop residues you're adding or getting rid of, you're getting rid of the
[02:31:53.770 --> 02:31:58.730]  weeds and the weeds are going to be more effective. And so that's, that's the goal.
[02:31:59.530 --> 02:32:05.610]  Or the, you know, any of the agricultural crop residues you're adding organic matter that
[02:32:05.610 --> 02:32:10.970]  probably probably gets hotter quicker or something because it's composting. I don't know.
[02:32:10.970 --> 02:32:15.450]  Yeah. I'm a little unclear how that process is totally, you know, layering out.
[02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:24.490]  There's no benefit in that either. Exactly. So you must have to do it in a crop rotational form
[02:32:24.490 --> 02:32:30.090]  where you're doing grid A and then grid B is the one where you'll do solarization and then
[02:32:30.090 --> 02:32:36.330]  application of material to develop a better tilth. And then, you know, you'll into, into mix it and
[02:32:36.330 --> 02:32:41.130]  then next year you would reverse it. So you're, you're taking like, you know, a hundred thousand
[02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:47.290]  square foot and you're only growing on 50,000. And so you do 50,000 this year, 50,000 next year,
[02:32:47.290 --> 02:32:52.170]  but this way that solarization would work in the hot part of the summer because how can you cut a
[02:32:52.170 --> 02:33:00.730]  chunk of the growing season out and get paid? It's a tough one. Yeah. You know? Yeah. That's
[02:33:00.730 --> 02:33:06.250]  the hard part is that some of this stuff is just tough for us with, cause the benefit outdoor is
[02:33:06.250 --> 02:33:11.450]  doing it outdoor and catching the season. You don't have anything but that window.
[02:33:12.090 --> 02:33:17.290]  Maybe, maybe this is, sorry, I was gonna say, maybe this is a strategy for like, you're seeing
[02:33:17.290 --> 02:33:22.250]  a lot of hemp people move into old agricultural grounds. So maybe this is like a, before we start
[02:33:22.250 --> 02:33:28.010]  strategy or something. Yeah. I got like a three year fallow prior to organic. Yeah. You're right.
[02:33:28.010 --> 02:33:33.210]  Exactly. Yeah. As long as it doesn't create any like disease, as long as it's, you know, the,
[02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:37.370]  the goal and the actual effect of it is to bring it down to something like neutral and you're not
[02:33:37.370 --> 02:33:41.290]  actually causing disease. I don't see a problem with it. It seems like it could fit somewhere.
[02:33:42.090 --> 02:33:46.330]  You know, as long as I'm always mindful that whatever we do produces a solution has a
[02:33:47.130 --> 02:33:52.330]  doesn't linger around for eons of generations and plastics and things like that. As we go forward,
[02:33:52.330 --> 02:33:56.890]  if we can come up with solutions that don't that biodegrade or whatever, as they come into the
[02:33:56.890 --> 02:34:01.850]  environment. But but it sounds like to me that if you did bring it down to neutral and a strategy
[02:34:01.850 --> 02:34:07.850]  like this, you could easily then revive it with a good inoculum like the compost and things like
[02:34:07.850 --> 02:34:12.410]  that. And this is where like, you know, we spoke about some of the obstacles that, you know,
[02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:18.250]  maybe Elaine, Dr. Lane has, but like, this is where I put her as the undisputed world champion.
[02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:24.570]  Like we have yet to run into a facility that had a soil pathogen problem that we couldn't get under
[02:34:24.570 --> 02:34:30.090]  control in a reasonable amount of time with the same strategies that we use to increase yield.
[02:34:30.090 --> 02:34:37.370]  And that that's where what Dr. Lane has not missed once, you know, you know, despite her views on
[02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:43.530]  mineral balancing or what she thinks is the correct goal, you know, when we take strategies
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:48.490]  and cultivation that lead to an aerobic root zone, we don't have those problems at all.
[02:34:49.050 --> 02:34:54.250]  Yeah, you know, I mean, I could see it being utilized as a first time strategy to implement in a field.
[02:34:55.130 --> 02:35:01.690]  And then as you go forward, so the way that in soil ecology, as we deal with weeds, as we move
[02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:06.650]  along the ecological succession underground in the microbes, and so that's how we start
[02:35:06.650 --> 02:35:11.770]  just selecting for which plants then thrive in the system. But that's a much longer term strategy,
[02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:16.010]  depending on, you know, what your base soil is starting out with. So I could see this being
[02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:21.690]  something definitely utilized as a start of a system. If your system is a young system, so let's
[02:35:21.690 --> 02:35:25.850]  say you're doing greens all the time, and it doesn't take much to inoculate it every time, and you
[02:35:25.850 --> 02:35:32.490]  could do this every time because you're not growing trees that need a very long, you know, growth,
[02:35:32.490 --> 02:35:39.130]  ecological growth time to get that fungal component up. They have a much lower
[02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:46.010]  threshold of biological numbers that they need. So for something like greens, I could see that
[02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:52.890]  being a good strategy. Yeah. And they're introducing this as an alternative to conventional fumigation,
[02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:57.930]  you know, fumigating your soil, which we all agree is not an option for canning. Yes.
[02:35:58.010 --> 02:36:06.010]  Not a good idea. Yeah, methyl bromide. That's how they do organic walnuts, because it takes four
[02:36:06.010 --> 02:36:12.170]  years before there's nuts. So they dig out the old tree, methyl bromide the whole, plant a new one,
[02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:17.610]  and then in four years when it produces, it can be deemed organic. Wow.
[02:36:19.290 --> 02:36:26.170]  What? There's no loophole though, you know? Gang shit. Yeah, one of the most profound moments in my entire,
[02:36:26.890 --> 02:36:33.450]  you know, growing career was I was at a greenhouse in Salinas, and, you know, the owner of the
[02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:38.890]  property also is growing strawberries, and they brought in like a flat of clamshells of strawberries,
[02:36:39.450 --> 02:36:44.650]  and all the weed, all the white weed people were just devouring down, but like not one of the
[02:36:44.650 --> 02:36:49.530]  non-English speaking agricultural workers would go anywhere near those strawberries, and I even kind
[02:36:49.530 --> 02:36:54.410]  of was like, you want some? And their face was like, that was a really profound moment.
[02:36:54.410 --> 02:36:59.210]  Like they've been in the trenches, they know what goes down, and which I think is the beauty of
[02:36:59.210 --> 02:37:08.010]  regulated cannabis right now. Like we're getting a real strong snapshot with major financial losses
[02:37:08.010 --> 02:37:13.850]  tied to the things that we regularly do in agriculture that affect cat 3 testing, which I
[02:37:13.850 --> 02:37:19.770]  think is really the kind of poetic aspect of cannabis is so good at bioremediating that it's
[02:37:19.770 --> 02:37:24.410]  like cleaning up the agriculture that's next door because of the contamination that's leading to a
[02:37:24.410 --> 02:37:30.330]  cat 3 failure and a loss of investment. So now there's a motivation to look at how toxic our
[02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:36.170]  farming is and how far that spreads away from the actual agricultural field. He's remediating
[02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:49.210]  the cultivators too. It's great. All right, so just quickly, we'll end. Lydia, I know you got to get off.
[02:37:49.210 --> 02:37:54.330]  Gemma, come over here. Say hi to everyone. We'll end with one viewer question. Gemma, do you want to say hi?
[02:37:55.210 --> 02:37:56.970]  What have you been doing while we've been talking?
[02:37:58.250 --> 02:38:06.410]  Hi. No, what have you been doing? You've been watching what? TV. Yeah, that's my babysitter. All right, all right.
[02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:12.730]  So we got one. Lydia, we'll let you go because I know Lydia has to leave. A viewer question.
[02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:16.090]  Let me cue it up. Gemma, you got to be quiet though.
[02:38:18.490 --> 02:38:24.810]  Bye, Lydia. Good talking with you. I really appreciate you fielding questions like this.
[02:38:24.810 --> 02:38:31.450]  My question revolves around living soil and decomposition rates and nutrient cycling from
[02:38:31.450 --> 02:38:37.130]  season to season in a greenhouse that is not climate controlled. All right, so what we have
[02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:46.490]  here is a couple of grassroots fabric beds, living soil edition, equipped with glue mat, glue soak.
[02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:54.330]  And I built the soil that the intention was high porosity, good drainage, and getting away from
[02:38:54.330 --> 02:39:00.250]  the use of the unsustainable peat. And so what I did is I used a greater proportion of rice hulls
[02:39:00.810 --> 02:39:09.130]  in the soil and I would say outfitted it with the appropriate amount of organic amendments. And
[02:39:10.890 --> 02:39:19.690]  my plan was to put around six inches or so of hardwood chip and then inoculate it with
[02:39:19.690 --> 02:39:25.690]  King's Tropharia mushroom spawn. And we have a nice thick mat here. And then I laid down my blue soak.
[02:39:25.850 --> 02:39:32.650]  And everything did really well last season. And now going into this season, I was surprised in
[02:39:32.650 --> 02:39:38.490]  looking at a few spots that the rate of decomposition from what I'm used to inside in my
[02:39:38.490 --> 02:39:51.610]  living soil systems is far lower. And so my main question is, what can I do in this bed to stimulate
[02:39:51.610 --> 02:39:57.450]  some rapid decomposition to ensure that I have enough nutrient cycling to provide my plants with
[02:39:57.450 --> 02:40:04.970]  what I need this year? So if you have any suggestions, whether it be a more of inoculation
[02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:10.010]  of worms, as you can see, there's one slithering by right here. So they have survived the winter,
[02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:17.290]  but I figured that they would self-populate. Or maybe a sprouted seed tea or compost extract.
[02:40:17.290 --> 02:40:20.570]  Wondering what you guys would recommend. Appreciate it. Thanks in advance.
[02:40:23.050 --> 02:40:30.570]  All right, Scott. I'm gonna let the wife get this one. All right, Sarah. Do it, wife.
[02:40:30.570 --> 02:40:36.010]  So that was a long time viewer, first time caller. Yeah, long time viewer.
[02:40:36.010 --> 02:40:41.770]  Thanks, professional. Welcome. Yeah, that was solid. Yeah, I like it.
[02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:48.810]  Yeah. Well, first of all, I would say there's a couple of things off the bat that I would
[02:40:48.810 --> 02:40:55.050]  kind of steer on this is that anytime you're wanting to increase the nutrient cycling in a
[02:40:55.050 --> 02:40:58.890]  system, you need to quantify what you have first and what that balance looks like. So I would get
[02:40:58.890 --> 02:41:03.610]  it quantified because you don't really know what you got and where you need to address the issues
[02:41:03.610 --> 02:41:09.130]  or any changes until you take a look. So I would quantify that if you're serious about this.
[02:41:10.090 --> 02:41:16.010]  The second thing is you want a natural decomposition in the system, a sort of natural
[02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:23.450]  steady decomposition in the system that is advantageous to growing a plant and not necessarily
[02:41:24.570 --> 02:41:30.890]  a compost site. So I would say that is steered by the amount of organic matter and the combination
[02:41:30.890 --> 02:41:37.770]  of organic matter in the system and on top of the system. So first and foremost, if you're growing
[02:41:39.130 --> 02:41:44.330]  cannabis, if you're growing any cash crop, right, for money or whatever, you're doing this
[02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:52.490]  seriously. I would make sure that your organic matter and your rates of nutrient cycling are
[02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:58.410]  the first and foremost priority of the system. And that requires oxygenation of the system.
[02:41:58.410 --> 02:42:02.570]  And that means that the soil, you need to understand that the soil needs to respire.
[02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:07.610]  And for the soil to respire and breathe, it needs to be able to get access to that air. If it's
[02:42:07.690 --> 02:42:14.890]  smothered with any thick cake layers of anything, whether that be caked on new minerals that are
[02:42:14.890 --> 02:42:20.650]  too much, you know, anything can be too much. You know, any organic material, any mineral material
[02:42:20.650 --> 02:42:27.130]  can be too much if it smothers that surface layer, even if it's roots growing in the surface
[02:42:27.130 --> 02:42:33.370]  layer. So you can have a living mulch layer, a crop layer that is too much, that it's
[02:42:33.370 --> 02:42:37.130]  holding on to so much water that now you're getting gnats and now you're getting other
[02:42:37.130 --> 02:42:41.290]  things like that, that maybe you don't want to have to deal with in your system. So
[02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:48.010]  understanding that when you're dealing with a living soil system, you want that aerobic
[02:42:48.010 --> 02:42:53.290]  respiration in the system. So yes, you want organic matter and that can come in the form of roots.
[02:42:53.290 --> 02:42:56.570]  Make sure that they're not overwhelming your system. If you're getting too many gnats,
[02:42:56.570 --> 02:43:02.010]  thin that down. Make sure that your mulch layer is something that is not suffocating the system.
[02:43:02.010 --> 02:43:07.930]  Again, if you're having gnats, you're seeing that you're accumulating water on the system.
[02:43:07.930 --> 02:43:17.370]  And don't try to emulate necessarily too much of a decomposition in the soil per se. Leave
[02:43:17.370 --> 02:43:25.210]  that portion for composting on its own off to the side, I would suggest. So those are the
[02:43:25.210 --> 02:43:30.970]  steps that I would immediately take. I get that it sounds like he's in a colder climate and he's
[02:43:30.970 --> 02:43:36.010]  trying to buffer through when he didn't have the plants and that's fine. Just take off that huge
[02:43:36.010 --> 02:43:42.810]  mulch layer when you go to plant the plants and make sure that your soil can respire, that it
[02:43:42.810 --> 02:43:48.410]  can breathe, that you can kind of see here and there into the soil and see what is going on. Now
[02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:53.930]  if you're in a hot climate and you want to mitigate water loss, you want to make sure that you have
[02:43:53.930 --> 02:44:00.970]  enough mulch layer that you do mitigate that water loss. So it's just a everything is context
[02:44:00.970 --> 02:44:07.770]  and a balance, but keeping in mind that you want that aerobic microbial life doing those processes
[02:44:07.770 --> 02:44:11.930]  for you. That's what gives you all the nutrients in the form that you want them. That's what gives
[02:44:11.930 --> 02:44:17.370]  you all the enzymes. That's what gives you all of the hormones and different things like that,
[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:22.330]  that the plant needs. And that's what engages the genetics of the plant to give it what it needs
[02:44:22.330 --> 02:44:27.530]  when it needs it. So I mean microbes aren't perfect. You do have to balance that with,
[02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:34.170]  you know, your mineral profile too. But anyway. I think what's important, I was gonna say on
[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:40.810]  decomposition though, when if you're laying that much rice hull into a media and you're not putting
[02:44:40.810 --> 02:44:46.730]  in enough of a nitrogen source in order to go along with it, it's effectively drawing as a nutrient
[02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:52.890]  sink. Wouldn't that also slow down that decomposition process? Because you almost
[02:44:52.890 --> 02:44:58.490]  like whenever I've used rice hulls in a mix, I compost it first and then add it. I don't add
[02:44:58.490 --> 02:45:04.810]  it as an aeration component because for me, it's always been a nitrogen thief. So it ends up stealing
[02:45:04.810 --> 02:45:10.890]  my effective nitrogen in order to break down naturally under microbial level. And so he might
[02:45:10.890 --> 02:45:17.130]  have had enough to drive fertility, but he's not getting enough of biological activity in the way
[02:45:17.130 --> 02:45:24.410]  he needs to really do composting. And I'm just curious from your opinion, does that make sense?
[02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:29.610]  Yes. 100%. Yeah. Which is what I was going to say is that the conditions are what's important for,
[02:45:30.250 --> 02:45:34.410]  you know, if there's no water out there, there's no organisms doing any decomposition
[02:45:35.370 --> 02:45:40.010]  at all because wherever the organisms are, whether it's under the snow layer or in the
[02:45:40.010 --> 02:45:47.050]  rainforest, they need ideal levels of moisture for those sets of organisms. They need organisms
[02:45:47.050 --> 02:45:52.570]  that will operate within those temperatures. So if his bed doesn't have any organisms that are
[02:45:52.570 --> 02:45:57.050]  suitable to operating during those extreme cold, then nothing's going to be happening anyways.
[02:45:57.770 --> 02:46:04.890]  You know, Dr. Lane did a bunch of research and her work found that some of the highest rates
[02:46:04.890 --> 02:46:10.410]  of decomposition happen under the snow layer during the winter. And what she
[02:46:11.370 --> 02:46:18.410]  supposes is happening is that where the snow meets the soil, it's not completely
[02:46:18.410 --> 02:46:24.970]  frozen and there's a little free water layer that is the ideal moisture percentage for organisms to
[02:46:24.970 --> 02:46:30.970]  perform decomposition activities. And so I would start to look at the main differences between his
[02:46:30.970 --> 02:46:36.170]  indoor that's having high rates of decomposition and the outdoor that's not having high rates of
[02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:41.770]  decomposition. I would think one of the easy components is he's watering the indoor and he's
[02:46:41.770 --> 02:46:47.610]  not watering the outdoor because he's just letting it try to decompose. So if there's not adequate
[02:46:47.610 --> 02:46:53.290]  moisture in that compost pile, so to speak, then nothing's going to be happening. And then if
[02:46:53.290 --> 02:46:59.290]  there's too much of anything, you're suffocating it and again nothing's happening. So we need
[02:46:59.290 --> 02:47:06.250]  adequate and ideal aeration and levels of oxygen for rates of decomposition to happen. You need
[02:47:06.250 --> 02:47:11.450]  ideal levers of moisture for that decomposition to happen because they need to be awake and
[02:47:11.450 --> 02:47:17.370]  operating with certain amounts of water. And you need the organisms that will function and operate
[02:47:17.370 --> 02:47:24.690]  under those conditions with which they're under. And you need that again that
[02:47:25.410 --> 02:47:31.330]  taking a look at what organisms are there. Are the organisms even there to do the decomposition?
[02:47:32.290 --> 02:47:37.250]  So you may be asking the system to do something that it can't really do at this stage in its
[02:47:37.250 --> 02:47:42.930]  evolution. And he did ask about acceleration techniques and yeah if you add supplemental
[02:47:42.930 --> 02:47:48.370]  things that can encourage biology which will encourage decomposition. One of the things that
[02:47:48.370 --> 02:47:55.570]  he mentioned was the sprouted seed tea which is a very popular thing. Of all the things that
[02:47:55.570 --> 02:48:01.250]  collapse beneficial populations of organisms in the organic sector, I would say the sprouted
[02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:07.330]  seed teas are the most effective and they're just as capable at completely wiping out soil organisms
[02:48:07.330 --> 02:48:11.170]  as an application of a systemic fungicide is. They have the same amount of...
[02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:17.330]  Yeah, yeah it's crazy. People don't think about that but an accelerant can also blow the head
[02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:22.530]  off. So yeah you can start your car with a little shot of ether into the air cleaner every day but
[02:48:22.530 --> 02:48:27.970]  at some point the motor is going to blow up. And so you know if you do add anything to that
[02:48:27.970 --> 02:48:33.570]  mulch layer to accelerate decomposition, you have to also factor in that we're most of us are way
[02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:39.890]  over applying things which causes a actual destruction of the organism populations through
[02:48:39.890 --> 02:48:46.210]  overstimulation. So you need to not collapse it through overstimulation. It's like a boom bust
[02:48:46.210 --> 02:48:50.930]  effect in any ecological system. So like even if you have too many rabbits and now you're going to
[02:48:50.930 --> 02:48:55.490]  have a big proliferation of coyotes and whatever eats rabbits and they're going to decimate the
[02:48:55.490 --> 02:49:00.210]  population and then you'll have too many of the predators and that can go back and forth in
[02:49:00.210 --> 02:49:06.930]  extremes in the microbial community as well. Yeah, 100%. 100%. And Scott you had said something
[02:49:06.930 --> 02:49:13.090]  interesting about what Elaine said about snow and what happens underneath it. Now I know so he...
[02:49:13.570 --> 02:49:19.090]  Blue is growing in Maine but he's growing in a greenhouse so there's not a layer of snow but
[02:49:19.090 --> 02:49:23.970]  if he didn't have that top, can you talk about what would happen with the snow and what goes
[02:49:23.970 --> 02:49:30.130]  on underneath? Well and I'm... yeah I'm not necessarily advocating adding snow either. I just meant I
[02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:35.730]  think what's important is I think what's important is that the snow is providing the ideal level of
[02:49:35.730 --> 02:49:42.370]  moisture on the soil surface where the decomposition is happening. And so if he harvested those plants
[02:49:42.370 --> 02:49:48.690]  and never added any more water in there, well water, oxygen, and microbes are the three things
[02:49:48.690 --> 02:49:54.050]  that cause decomposition to happen. So without the water it's not going to happen. Without the
[02:49:54.050 --> 02:50:00.610]  oxygen it's not going to happen. Without the organisms it's not going to happen. So you know
[02:50:00.610 --> 02:50:06.130]  whether he adds moisture out there, I think what he really needs personally is he needs to get a
[02:50:06.130 --> 02:50:13.810]  good foundational composting technique to get that aspect covered to where he is providing
[02:50:13.810 --> 02:50:20.130]  benefit to his farm in the off-season. And just let the soil be soil. Don't try to force it into
[02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:26.210]  composting because by the time you plant again you might still be composting. Like Kevin said, you get
[02:50:26.210 --> 02:50:31.570]  too many rice holes, your carbon to nitrogen ratio is off, your composting is going to be ineffective,
[02:50:31.570 --> 02:50:36.850]  and you're going to have problems. So I would say focus on getting a really healthy worm bin.
[02:50:36.850 --> 02:50:41.650]  You know you don't need a ton of compost. Everybody's after like mounds and mounds of
[02:50:41.650 --> 02:50:48.690]  compost. Like Sarah and I take little tiny totes, like three cubic feet. So two soil bags of compost
[02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:56.850]  will treat 40,000 square feet of cannabis. Like you don't need like a worm bin and a rubbermaid tote.
[02:50:56.850 --> 02:51:03.730]  That's enough compost to treat 40,000 square feet of plants. You don't need a massive amount.
[02:51:03.730 --> 02:51:10.130]  What you need is a very healthy amount of compost. And what we call, what we're trying to term
[02:51:10.130 --> 02:51:15.330]  biologically complete so that we delineate and differentiate between like municipal compost,
[02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:21.090]  which is a very different thing than the type of compost we're talking about. So biologically
[02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:25.570]  complete just means it has, it's inoculum grade. It has all of those organisms we're talking about
[02:51:25.890 --> 02:51:28.930]  are doing the job that he's asking the system to do.
[02:51:31.330 --> 02:51:36.050]  All right. On that note, Gemma, you want to close us out?
[02:51:36.610 --> 02:51:37.110]  Bye-bye.
[02:51:38.690 --> 02:51:39.190]  Bye-bye.
[02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:46.130]  Thanks everybody. And thank you Gemma for being so patient for almost three hours.
[02:51:46.130 --> 02:51:48.370]  Thanks Peter. Good seeing you guys.
[02:51:50.770 --> 02:51:53.410]  And we got Chris Trump next week.
[02:51:53.970 --> 02:51:54.470]  Nice.
[02:51:59.490 --> 02:51:59.990]  Bye guys.
[02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:10.390]  I am stopping the recording and...
