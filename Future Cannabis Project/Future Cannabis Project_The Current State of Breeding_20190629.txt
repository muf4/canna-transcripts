[00:05.120 --> 00:10.120]  Give some love to someone whose genetics are like blowing you away right now.
[00:10.120 --> 00:13.120]  To be honest, it's been a genetic that was an 11-year hunt for me.
[00:13.120 --> 00:19.120]  I thought it was in seed form, turns out it was a clone only form, and it was from southern Ohio.
[00:19.120 --> 00:21.120]  It was a strain called Lemon G.
[00:21.120 --> 00:24.120]  A lot of our breeders are currently using it.
[00:24.120 --> 00:29.120]  It's a strain that's predominantly, or I'm sorry, a cut that's predominantly saturated the market.
[00:29.120 --> 00:32.120]  But the chirping profile to me is timeless.
[00:32.120 --> 00:35.120]  The original formation of that was totally by chance.
[00:35.120 --> 00:37.120]  It was a bagged seed from what I'm told.
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.120]  I actually had contact with the original breeders over the years.
[00:40.120 --> 00:45.120]  The original breeders, I can't necessarily tell you their names just based on the fact that they're still in a state
[00:45.120 --> 00:49.120]  where technically they could be obtained for what they did.
[00:49.120 --> 00:51.120]  However, I can tell you this.
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.120]  They are some of the most fantastic people I've ever had the graces of coming into contact with.
[00:56.120 --> 00:59.120]  Very, very much community-type people.
[01:00.120 --> 01:03.120]  That was a seed strain where it was a total random crack.
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.120]  They got everything from a waxy overtone of that Lemon Turpine down to-
[01:07.120 --> 01:08.120]  How were they crossing?
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.120]  It was a Lemon genome, or I'm sorry, it was a Skunk genome.
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.120]  I believe they said somewhere in there was the original G13,
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.120]  but to be totally direct, I'm not 100% on the statement.
[01:21.120 --> 01:28.120]  I had only heard them actually reference the original parent genetics twice in my lifetime after countless sit-downs.
[01:28.120 --> 01:33.120]  It's something that I know they hold very dear, and I'm kind of glad I don't know if that's the case.
[01:33.120 --> 01:36.120]  But ultimately, I do know that the Skunk genetic is in there,
[01:36.120 --> 01:41.120]  and that's attributing to the Turpine profile from what they were gathering.
[01:41.120 --> 01:49.120]  That Lemon Turpine ended up being everything from acrylic wax to full-on, just straight-up pine salt.
[01:49.120 --> 01:53.120]  The one that I came into contact with actually nine years ago-
[01:53.120 --> 01:55.120]  Well, no, it would be 11 now.
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.120]  Had the strain for two years, so that would have been a nine-year hunt.
[02:01.120 --> 02:03.120]  That one was the Pine Sulfeno.
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.120]  That was one that didn't sell, and like Rick was saying earlier when we were talking about
[02:07.120 --> 02:10.120]  sometimes the Turpines can be a double-edged sword
[02:10.120 --> 02:16.120]  because all of a sudden it's a great after-dinner strain, but not necessarily an every-moment strain.
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.120]  And that becomes a very big issue when you're producing,
[02:19.120 --> 02:25.120]  especially on a commercial scale, because sellability is always number one on that based on-
[02:25.120 --> 02:31.120]  Well, I shouldn't say number one, because ideally the health of the plant and the people consuming it is the number one.
[02:31.120 --> 02:33.120]  Let's say that'd be the number two.
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.120]  So ultimately, it's one of those things where you've got to pay attention to your market,
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.120]  and you've got to adjust, which is one of the reasons why we're seeing the MAC takeover.
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.120]  What worries me about this is, yes, it's a great strain, and yes, the cookies are great,
[02:44.120 --> 02:49.120]  but when the cookies oversaturate the market and the glue oversaturates the market,
[02:49.120 --> 02:52.120]  we start to see crossbreeding reliant on these strains.
[02:52.120 --> 02:54.120]  This is where it becomes a very big danger for us,
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.120]  because now we're starting to single-channel all of our genetics into another genetic.
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.120]  What this does is it actually lopsides the market and creates a dog breeding issue, if you will,
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.120]  where all of a sudden inbreeding is almost a direct result,
[03:08.120 --> 03:12.120]  and there's no around it because of the way that the prior genetics have been bred.
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.120]  That's going to destabilize over time and create issues or genetic mutations,
[03:16.120 --> 03:18.120]  which could be good, could be bad.
[03:18.120 --> 03:23.120]  I also believe that that's possibly why we've seen such a dramatic THC increase,
[03:23.120 --> 03:30.120]  because in the last 20 years, all the breeding we've been doing has been crossing these genomes so aggressively
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.120]  that we see stresses that we never would have seen in a naturalized environment.
[03:34.120 --> 03:36.120]  These are plants that would have never met in nature.
[03:36.120 --> 03:39.120]  When that happens, we're stretching the genetic rubber band
[03:39.120 --> 03:44.120]  and creating a lot of genetic variabilities that don't necessarily mean everything we want.
[03:44.120 --> 03:47.120]  A lot of destabilization comes from these processes,
[03:47.120 --> 03:53.120]  which is also part of the cause of today's multi-pheno generation, we'll call it,
[03:53.120 --> 03:57.120]  where it's okay if I have 30 different phenos come out of a seed pack.
[03:57.120 --> 03:59.120]  It's a sellable seed.
[03:59.120 --> 04:01.120]  Really, in the old market, that would not have been sellable.
[04:01.120 --> 04:05.120]  In fact, that's one of the reasons why the Amsterdam market was so closed off,
[04:05.120 --> 04:08.120]  because those breeders had processes to maintain quality.
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.120]  We don't see those practices being transformed today in very many seed banks,
[04:12.120 --> 04:15.120]  albeit great genetics coming out of those seed banks.
[04:15.120 --> 04:19.120]  As far as quality of genetics, that's not necessarily the equation here.
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.120]  What's the equation is the long game.
[04:21.120 --> 04:27.120]  The long game of having that genetic or some traits of that genetic not be mutated down the line
[04:27.120 --> 04:35.120]  by an incestual pattern of breeding, which is almost, in some cases and in some markets, impossible to escape.
[04:36.120 --> 04:43.120]  Imagine the old days when we had a lot more quarantine going on to our groups and collectives.
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.120]  We maybe had three friends that we got introduced into the same thing we were doing,
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.120]  and then out of those three friends, maybe we have six, seven genetics.
[04:51.120 --> 04:53.120]  That's our breeding pile.
[04:53.120 --> 04:58.120]  That's a very shallow breeding pool, and that's where a lot of these hybridized things came out of.
[04:59.120 --> 05:06.120]  As America expanded its seed collaborations and became a seed-creating populace,
[05:06.120 --> 05:13.120]  which used to only belong over in Europe at the time and maybe down south in South America,
[05:13.120 --> 05:16.120]  we literally skipped some processes.
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.120]  We didn't have a teacher, so they were accidents that were made accidentally,
[05:20.120 --> 05:24.120]  which should be harmless, but they're not to the end game.
[05:24.120 --> 05:29.120]  It's one of those things where a miseducation and a little bit too much fun too early
[05:29.120 --> 05:34.120]  is going to cause us future problems in this industry if we don't pay attention to them currently.
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.120]  When I say things like the Macs are great or the cookies are great,
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.120]  but what I really mean by that are they're fantastic.
[05:41.120 --> 05:45.120]  The people working with them are working with them for a very specific reason, and that's awesome.
[05:45.120 --> 05:48.120]  I hope that they get what they need out of it.
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.120]  But if we're overbreeding these strains, we're destabilizing our future availability
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.120]  to further creation of terpene profiles, terpene mixes,
[05:56.120 --> 06:01.120]  the availability to having a good THC volume with heavy terpenes,
[06:01.120 --> 06:06.120]  or just the anomalies that we're not currently seeing prevalently on today's market.
[06:06.120 --> 06:10.120]  And really prevalently ever, because we've been continually developing this crop
[06:10.120 --> 06:15.120]  only aggressively, let's say, in the last 20 years notably.
[06:15.120 --> 06:18.120]  That's really different when we talk about agriculture.
[06:18.120 --> 06:21.120]  We're talking about things that have been kind of corn
[06:21.120 --> 06:24.120]  was something that had over 200 years of development.
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.120]  So it's a big change in pace, and we still have time to fix these problems
[06:28.120 --> 06:34.120]  that we're now realizing have been caused by shallow gene pools.
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.120]  So when we see destabilizing genetics, we see pollen late stage,
[06:38.120 --> 06:42.120]  like basically week 7, week 8, popping out, single little bananas.
[06:42.120 --> 06:45.120]  These are all things that say we should have went further generations
[06:45.120 --> 06:48.120]  or further genomes out before backbreeding back in.
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.120]  And that's really where the stabilization comes into play,
[06:51.120 --> 06:54.120]  and one of the reasons we're not seeing it in today's game, because that takes years.
[06:54.120 --> 06:58.120]  Because we're going to do that maybe 3, 4, 5 times, but in order to do that,
[06:58.120 --> 07:04.120]  that's 4 times a set out that it has to mix with its parents, 4 generations back.
[07:04.120 --> 07:08.120]  Then we go back and do the same line of sequence over and over again,
[07:08.120 --> 07:12.120]  and that's how you get to the F16s, F18s, F20s.
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.120]  And when you get there, you narrow down your phenos that way.
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.120]  And so what basically Rick was talking about with the parents breeding to create those seeds
[07:21.120 --> 07:26.120]  is once you have that, that is your, that's your Mona Lisa.
[07:26.120 --> 07:32.120]  And so what his techniques allow and why I have such a respect for Rick and Brothers Grimm
[07:32.120 --> 07:37.120]  is they do a great deal of work just safe lining their painting.
[07:37.120 --> 07:39.120]  They don't store their paintings in direct sunlight.
[07:39.120 --> 07:44.120]  They literally sit there and have them behind covered glass making sure that they're protected
[07:44.120 --> 07:48.120]  so when somebody wants to enjoy them, they enjoy what they're expecting.
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.120]  They're enjoying what they remember.
[07:50.120 --> 07:55.120]  For instance, and this is not a slam on Nirvana, I've gotten great genetics out of Nirvana.
[07:55.120 --> 08:00.120]  Back in the early days, we worked with Nirvana on a couple of strains of ice.
[08:00.120 --> 08:05.120]  We worked with them on Mystic Blue and Papaya.
[08:05.120 --> 08:10.120]  Great strains. Amongst others, Medusa, Snow White, all kinds of stuff from them.
[08:10.120 --> 08:20.120]  But what I noticed was after the EU formed and kind of took over and altered our industry over in Europe,
[08:20.120 --> 08:25.120]  we ended up having genetic issues with retaining what we remember.
[08:25.120 --> 08:30.120]  Now some of the terpenes were still there, but the flower formation was completely different.
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.120]  I had a papaya that looked like it could have been wheat from the way it grew.
[08:35.120 --> 08:41.120]  I mean it would have produced crazy amounts due to the almost, I'd have to say, a thousand heads it had,
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.120]  but they were all no bigger than wheat.
[08:44.120 --> 08:46.120]  So it was kind of a really weird flower formation.
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.120]  Papaya is known for big chunky flowers. It had the smell.
[08:50.120 --> 08:53.120]  So somewhere along the line, destabilization of these genetics occurred
[08:53.120 --> 08:56.120]  because now these are phenotypes that we never used to see in the early days.
[08:56.120 --> 09:01.120]  These are all obscurities and they're from the same genetic profiles.
[09:01.120 --> 09:07.120]  That's why work like Rick was talking about with going back and having these parents on safeline is a big deal.
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.120]  Now over in Europe with the EU shifts and the raids that happened in Switzerland and Austria,
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.120]  we started to see that destabilization be caused by the government
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.120]  and not necessarily something these breeders did.
[09:19.120 --> 09:22.120]  So to hold it against them is absolutely asinine
[09:22.120 --> 09:26.120]  because they were just trying to make sure that they were staying in line with what they had.
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.120]  Now granted, they just got crippled by their own people and pushed back super far in their genetic lines
[09:31.120 --> 09:34.120]  and had to go back and crack seeds for mothers again.
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.120]  And like Rick was saying, if you want to change your lineup and get variants, that's how you do it.
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.120]  If you want to go for consistency, you need your mother and your father to rebreed, rebreed.
[09:43.120 --> 09:45.120]  Otherwise your seed batches will vary from time to time.
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.120]  And yes, aging can be an issue, but that's where proper usage of boron during these processes
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.120]  and phosphates end up allowing for these seeds to be produced with all the micro, macro minerals
[09:56.120 --> 10:00.120]  and elements that's needed for the protection of this genetic.
[10:00.120 --> 10:06.120]  Now I reference boron mainly because its main thing in a plant system is to create plasma,
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.120]  which is basically the cushion inside the cell for all the material to stay from placking and getting damaged.
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.120]  So that's one of the reasons why boron is actually very important in the seed industry
[10:16.120 --> 10:19.120]  as well as phosphates because that increases vigor to the plant
[10:19.120 --> 10:22.120]  and generally keeps the root base healthy as well.
[10:22.120 --> 10:28.120]  So there are ways to kind of almost have better and worse seed batches
[10:28.120 --> 10:31.120]  based on your chemistries in your grow room as well.
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.120]  So there's a lot of variables that we don't necessarily take into account
[10:34.120 --> 10:37.120]  when looking at who's consistent and who's not.
[10:37.120 --> 10:42.120]  And that's a big deal because we get one chance to draw an opinion off of most seed packs.
[10:42.120 --> 10:47.120]  Very few of us are like myself and a few other breeders I know that go out and buy 10, 15 packs
[10:48.120 --> 10:52.120]  of regular seeds to go pheno hunting through, get a feel for the genetic
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.120]  and try and pull something that we can make a market with.
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.120]  And that's really where feminization loses its foothold
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.120]  because feminization, yes, will give you what the breeder wants,
[11:02.120 --> 11:07.120]  but you're going to ultimately end up with the same pheno that the dude 200 miles away has.
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.120]  Now when your market's mesh, it's going to interfere.
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.120]  So the whole idea with rego seeds or regular seeds, sorry for calling them regos,
[11:16.120 --> 11:22.120]  regular seeds is the idea of actually getting a true, unrepeatable phenotype.
[11:22.120 --> 11:27.120]  Because like Rick was saying, there's very fine subtleties that will change along the way
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.120]  and that's really what you're cornerstoning on.
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.120]  You want that change in the flavor. You want that change to the actual physical growth of the plant.
[11:35.120 --> 11:37.120]  Maybe it's a denser plant than the others have.
[11:37.120 --> 11:39.120]  We look at the Gorilla Glue.
[11:39.120 --> 11:42.120]  An original conception of the Gorilla Glue, when it came out,
[11:42.120 --> 11:46.120]  there were two actual Gorilla Glue cuts from my knowledge of what it was.
[11:46.120 --> 11:52.120]  And the first one out was a lower yielding strain that was identical to the higher yielding strain in almost every way.
[11:52.120 --> 11:55.120]  And now this could be a little bit of folklore, mind you.
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.120]  So there's no, I don't have this, I haven't spoken with the breeder and had him say, yes, this happened.
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.120]  Okay, so, but the idea is this.
[12:03.120 --> 12:09.120]  They sold out on the lower yield and aided that in the public market.
[12:09.120 --> 12:15.120]  And from what I remember, they handed it out, which at that point, you're thankful to have an awesome genetic, right?
[12:15.120 --> 12:19.120]  I mean, it's Gorilla Glue. It's freaking great, regardless of how much it yields.
[12:19.120 --> 12:26.120]  Well, later on, there was some issue that ended up happening and I guess they lost ability to have access to that strain.
[12:26.120 --> 12:32.120]  And there was kind of the all of a sudden lift in the volumes we saw from Gorilla Glue.
[12:32.120 --> 12:38.120]  Now, is that substantially due to genetic drifting off of cuttings? Could be.
[12:38.120 --> 12:42.120]  Or it could be that they actually came out with the two different cuts, which is something that can happen.
[12:42.120 --> 12:45.120]  And that's just kind of an example of genetics.
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.120]  It's literally like looking like your brother, but being two inches taller.
[12:49.120 --> 12:52.120]  And that's exactly kind of the process.
[12:52.120 --> 12:59.120]  And why it's important to have your own is out of a pack of a thousand, we say there will be a couple of superstars.
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.120]  You're looking at the superstar to really build your facility with, maintain your market.
[13:04.120 --> 13:12.120]  If you want to go national or even want to go and take over a state or even a portion of a state or even a portion of your city with what you're doing,
[13:12.120 --> 13:15.120]  you've got to have something nobody else has.
[13:15.120 --> 13:21.120]  Otherwise, the next guy can come down, knock $10 off your price, and he's going to take your market and walk with it.
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.120]  That's where we see this drastic destabilization of the pound, too.
[13:25.120 --> 13:31.120]  And that's where I get worried because like we were talking earlier with all the genomes kind of bottlenecking,
[13:31.120 --> 13:36.120]  we're starting to see price per pound drop because everybody's going to have this or everybody's going to have that.
[13:36.120 --> 13:39.120]  And that's going to eventually affect the entire market.
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.120]  And so not only are we shooting ourselves in the foot in the future of having variabilities to our genomes,
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.120]  but we're also creating a decomposition to our market at a much faster rate by centering around just a couple of these genomes
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.120]  and not truly having that kind of what's next feel.
[13:56.120 --> 13:59.120]  And it's one of my favorite parts about this is not knowing what's around the corner.
[13:59.120 --> 14:03.120]  You get a seed pack from a regular bag that you had from years and years ago,
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.120]  and you get a sativa that blows your socks off because it was done inside, not out,
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.120]  or it wasn't brought over in a tire and sprayed with ammonia.
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.120]  Now, granted, that's extremely rare, but if you're not going out and looking for these genomes,
[14:15.120 --> 14:20.120]  you're never going to find the new genetic crunch, the thing that everybody wants.
[14:20.120 --> 14:27.120]  And we all have this essence of wanting to be the creator of our own art, and that's really what it comes down to.
[14:27.120 --> 14:32.120]  When we want a canvas, do we want something that consistently has a road painted in it before we get there,
[14:32.120 --> 14:36.120]  such as having a genetic that everybody else has in that genome?
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.120]  And all of a sudden, I'm stuck painting land scenes.
[14:39.120 --> 14:43.120]  What happens if I want to paint an ocean scene and have a big wave and an iceberg?
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.120]  I got a road sitting right in the middle.
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.120]  It's like somehow there's a road there, folks.
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.120]  But, you know, and that's kind of what we're doing with the genomes, and it's exciting, though.
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.120]  You know, I speak on it as almost a negative thing, but it's the exciting parts,
[14:57.120 --> 15:00.120]  because you never get the bruises until you fall.
[15:00.120 --> 15:05.120]  You never get the bumps on the nose to tell you not to run down the hall until you face the wall.
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.120]  So, you know, these are our wake-up calls.
[15:07.120 --> 15:13.120]  These are our moments to see, and we've hit that point in the creation of these genetic availabilities
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.120]  to really start to see the flaws and follies and also the grands and the glories
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.120]  and know what's what and how to produce and proceed with it.
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.120]  Thankfully, with today's Internet age, we have access to more books than we could speak of.
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.120]  Back in the day, when we first started, it was a situation where you'd go to Barnes & Noble's
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.120]  and have your friend buy your book, and then he'd meet you at a gas station 10 miles from your house.
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.120]  I mean, it was absurd, but it was what we had to do to feel safe.
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.120]  And nowadays, you just hop on the Internet, Google up plant deficiencies,
[15:43.120 --> 15:45.120]  and you'll find out what's going wrong in your garden.
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.120]  I mean, it's one of the greatest turnarounds in this industry.
[15:51.120 --> 15:55.120]  I would have not, let me say this, it's a great turnaround that I would have never seen coming in my lifetime,
[15:55.120 --> 16:00.120]  especially growing up in this industry at the ages of 15, 16, figuring it out
[16:00.120 --> 16:05.120]  and having the old ways kind of translate into the new availability.
[16:05.120 --> 16:11.120]  And what I see from that is a lot of carelessness, but from this carelessness can come a lot of greatness.
[16:11.120 --> 16:15.120]  It comes a lot of wake-up calls. It also can cause a lot of problems.
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.120]  But just like anything else, anybody who's grown a business or grown genetics or grown anything,
[16:20.120 --> 16:22.120]  it all comes with problems.
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.120]  So these problems that I speak of are not necessarily truly negative.
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.120]  In fact, they're absolutely positive to this industry.
[16:29.120 --> 16:33.120]  Because without these lessons, we ultimately might find ourselves lost in the middle of the woods
[16:33.120 --> 16:35.120]  instead of still in view of the path.
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.120]  And that's a big deal when we're able to create health in my garden.
[16:41.120 --> 16:46.120]  I'm able to do this. I'm able to maintain and care for others and myself
[16:46.120 --> 16:50.120]  and really focus on the health and quality of the material.
[16:50.120 --> 16:54.120]  And that's something we're starting to see with commercialization, with mass spectrometry,
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.120]  and it's creating a safer product for all of us.
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.120]  And ultimately, when you have the genetics, the next thing is, what was that genetics grown with?
[17:02.120 --> 17:06.120]  I mean, we look at this market and we say, oh, food's food. Well, no, it's not.
[17:06.120 --> 17:09.120]  Are you going to feed your kid noodles every day and just oatmeal
[17:09.120 --> 17:13.120]  and see him develop into a great, fantastic, multidimensional human being?
[17:13.120 --> 17:17.120]  No, he's going to lose his eyesight. He may not have brain development.
[17:17.120 --> 17:20.120]  These are the same things that we don't know we're doing to these plants yet
[17:20.120 --> 17:22.120]  by not knowing how to feed it properly.
[17:22.120 --> 17:26.120]  We aren't necessarily giving these plants everything they can to create their best,
[17:26.120 --> 17:30.120]  and we don't know it. And that's what we're realizing in the hemp industry as well.
[17:30.120 --> 17:35.120]  And a lot of these farmers are intentionally starving these crops to not permit to making THC.
[17:35.120 --> 17:40.120]  So the understanding of food in the cannabis plant is very much in its infancy in this industry,
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.120]  just based on the understanding of the public.
[17:42.120 --> 17:45.120]  It's not in its infancy as far as its development.
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.120]  And that's where a really interesting correlation comes in.
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.120]  It's almost like handing a six-year-old a cell phone.
[17:50.120 --> 17:55.120]  They may not know what they have, but they know they like it, and they know that it does well.
[17:55.120 --> 17:58.120]  And that's where focusing on all aspects of your growth comes into play.
[17:58.120 --> 18:02.120]  I mean, you talk to a gardener about what's their water source, and all of a sudden, oh, I do well.
[18:02.120 --> 18:05.120]  Are you treating your water? No.
[18:05.120 --> 18:07.120]  Why are you not treating your water?
[18:07.120 --> 18:12.120]  Why are you not setting a zero variability in the biggest variable area of your room?
[18:12.120 --> 18:17.120]  I mean, your chemistries, your genetics, none of that may work right with the wrong water.
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.120]  So it's very important to start with the full picture.
[18:21.120 --> 18:23.120]  You start at the base and work your way up.
[18:23.120 --> 18:30.120]  You can work your way up, but every single volume of this cultivation and this state of being is important, and just as important.
[18:30.120 --> 18:35.120]  And so it's interesting because you may say, oh, nutrients are more important, or lighting's more important,
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.120]  or medium's just as important.
[18:38.120 --> 18:45.120]  But the reality is, is it's all important because it's a symbiotic nature in which they mesh that's going to create that end product.
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.120]  You can use a nutritional line and see a pound and a half production per light,
[18:49.120 --> 18:54.120]  or you can use that same nutritional line properly and see three pounds of light.
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.120]  And there's a variance we don't know as gardeners because it's a misunderstanding.
[18:58.120 --> 19:01.120]  We've been working with GMO crops on the ag fields for too long,
[19:01.120 --> 19:05.120]  and so when we associate farming, we ultimately think of big ag.
[19:05.120 --> 19:12.120]  And then we think of genetic development and not realizing that those implementations have not been applied to this area yet,
[19:12.120 --> 19:19.120]  and hopefully never, because that will ultimately narrow down genetics and lead into the problem we originated from.
[19:19.120 --> 19:22.120]  It's a monster deal.
[19:22.120 --> 19:28.120]  So what I'm excited about is the massive allowance of education that we've been able to get from the internet,
[19:28.120 --> 19:32.120]  the availability of clean nutrition, the availability of clean mediums,
[19:32.120 --> 19:38.120]  the availability of good, stable genetics that we've been working on for decades
[19:38.120 --> 19:43.120]  and breeding the same parents to create repeatable seed crops.
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.120]  Who are some of the sources you go to online?
[19:47.120 --> 19:50.120]  Are there any people on Instagram that you're following or websites?
[19:50.120 --> 19:54.120]  So I've been doing a lot of, I've worked with Brothers Grimm's for years.
[19:54.120 --> 19:58.120]  I've done work with Nirvana. I've done work with Greenhouse, Barney's.
[19:58.120 --> 20:06.120]  Paradise was a really interesting kind of run for me because a 15 to 18 percent ice cream plant
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.120]  went through mass spectrometry from a greenhouse and hit 30 percent.
[20:10.120 --> 20:17.120]  So somewhere along the lines those genetics got upgraded, but after going over what I knew of it from the book of buds,
[20:17.120 --> 20:23.120]  it set every format and profile of the original genetic and that creamy flavor down to the rock hard flowers,
[20:23.120 --> 20:28.120]  down to the, you know, two and a half ounce maximum per plant that I was seeing.
[20:28.120 --> 20:30.120]  It was phenomenal.
[20:30.120 --> 20:36.120]  So really just about anybody's good.
[20:36.120 --> 20:39.120]  I like the older breeders because they tend to have a certain style.
[20:39.120 --> 20:42.120]  I've been working aggressively with Ethos lately as well.
[20:42.120 --> 20:45.120]  I've been really excited with a lot of his limited releases.
[20:45.120 --> 20:49.120]  And like I said, you know, just because it's limited, just because it's a one-time run,
[20:49.120 --> 20:52.120]  doesn't mean that it's truly a lazy man's strain.
[20:52.120 --> 20:56.120]  Some of us may call it that, but it really is something special.
[20:56.120 --> 21:02.120]  And to maintain its being special, some of these guys will put out limiteds that are not just,
[21:02.120 --> 21:04.120]  hey, I had this accident and here you go.
[21:04.120 --> 21:09.120]  They're actually limited for being awesome.
[21:09.120 --> 21:14.120]  I mean, we look at some of the old, like the Reservoir Sour Diesel.
[21:14.120 --> 21:16.120]  You couldn't necessarily get that.
[21:16.120 --> 21:17.120]  It was a cut only.
[21:17.120 --> 21:23.120]  I mean, a lot of these old school strains that were breeder strains and backbones for a lot of these new school genetics
[21:23.120 --> 21:28.120]  as well as old school genetics came from that time period.
[21:28.120 --> 21:35.120]  And what's messed up about it is that bottlenecking because we're sitting in the middle of that issue right now.
[21:35.120 --> 21:38.120]  And we're seeing that with the saturation of cookies and glues.
[21:38.120 --> 21:44.120]  I mean, you look at any breeder's line and if they don't have a glue or a cookie, then they're not in today's market.
[21:44.120 --> 21:46.120]  That says something because that's been in their shop.
[21:46.120 --> 21:52.120]  The potentiality for issues down the line are there because that genetic is everywhere.
[21:52.120 --> 21:55.120]  It's one of those things where it's cool until everybody has it.
[21:55.120 --> 21:57.120]  And that's been the cannabis game.
[21:57.120 --> 21:59.120]  That's kind of been our crowd.
[21:59.120 --> 22:04.120]  And it's important to remember that's where we come from because that's going to safe line not only the future
[22:04.120 --> 22:08.120]  where we can have things like the cookies and the glue come out, saturate the market.
[22:08.120 --> 22:14.120]  But as long as we recognize not to necessarily take that as a crutch but to use it as a tool,
[22:14.120 --> 22:16.120]  that's going to be the biggest thing.
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.120]  And right now we're getting a good equalization of people realizing that it's more of a crutch than a tool right now in most gardens.
[22:22.120 --> 22:25.120]  And that we need to walk away from.
[22:25.120 --> 22:29.120]  So as much as I love these genetics and have great respect for the breeders
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.120]  because they did a lot of hard work to get these phenomenal things to the market,
[22:33.120 --> 22:37.120]  there's a lot of danger in the excitement that surrounds them.
[22:37.120 --> 22:43.120]  So it's almost dangerous to a certain level.
[22:43.120 --> 22:47.120]  It's kind of been one of my more focal points of concern in the industry lately
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.120]  and one of the reasons I've been focusing on terpenes.
[22:50.120 --> 22:55.120]  Because terpenes are a really interesting profile format that follows through those genetic lines.
[22:55.120 --> 22:57.120]  Like the hazes, for instance.
[22:57.120 --> 23:00.120]  You'll smoke a lemon haze. You'll smoke a silver haze.
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.120]  You'll smoke a super silver haze.
[23:02.120 --> 23:08.120]  And you will find that exact terpene profile that's dominant in the haze genome.
[23:08.120 --> 23:10.120]  We had the same thing going on in our elephant tooth.
[23:10.120 --> 23:18.120]  Which was a blue ice cream, which is blue tooth from BC seeds before the scandal, mixed with elephant.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.120]  And Paradise's ice cream.
[23:21.120 --> 23:26.120]  And that one turned into a full-blown haze based on the blue tooth genetic.
[23:26.120 --> 23:32.120]  Now what was interesting about that was the ice cream would have been the main genetic producer, I would have thought,
[23:32.120 --> 23:37.120]  or the dominant replicant based on the fact that the seeds came from the ice cream plant.
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.120]  Which was one of the reasons why I really wanted it.
[23:39.120 --> 23:41.120]  I thought, hey, that'd be dominant.
[23:41.120 --> 23:43.120]  Well, it doesn't always work like that.
[23:43.120 --> 23:50.120]  And that's something that we're starting to also evolve and recognize is it's not as easy as it seems.
[23:50.120 --> 23:54.120]  And it's interesting because if we're paying attention, it'll show us that constantly.
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.120]  And we got a lot of interest in this market as far as retention,
[23:58.120 --> 24:02.120]  but we got a lot of people wondering how to do that.
[24:02.120 --> 24:07.120]  So if they're wondering how to do that and it's their end goal to do it, currently it's not being done.
[24:07.120 --> 24:20.350]  And we're starting to see that interfere with, you know, I think we beat that one up a bit.
[24:20.350 --> 24:22.350]  So I'm just going to leave it there.
[24:22.350 --> 24:26.350]  But it's been a big bothersome reason for me to be very vocal about.
[24:34.350 --> 24:35.350]  I'm going to leave it there.
