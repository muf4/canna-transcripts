[00:00.000 --> 00:06.480]  In one week.
[00:17.590 --> 00:17.990]  Okay.
[00:17.990 --> 00:26.270]  So this plant died because the filter got stuck and the plant didn't get enough
[00:26.270 --> 00:26.670]  water.
[00:27.630 --> 00:34.470]  And this fan, which gives the, the plant circulation was pointed in that
[00:34.470 --> 00:35.070]  direction.
[00:35.310 --> 00:40.510]  And so when the humidifier comes on at night, the humidity gets low.
[00:40.790 --> 00:43.350]  So the medium dried out.
[00:46.510 --> 00:50.270]  And so you have it in, uh, these are Hugo's.
[00:50.950 --> 00:54.750]  Those are six by six Hugos and grown and blocks.
[00:54.750 --> 01:08.460]  And then you have your use in a psycho nutrients company out of Australia,
[01:09.420 --> 01:13.060]  residual from the, what's the name of that group?
[01:13.220 --> 01:14.220]  Advanced nutrients.
[01:14.300 --> 01:16.420]  And we're playing classical music.
[01:16.540 --> 01:17.260]  That's correct.
[01:20.500 --> 01:22.100]  Are they enjoying the classical music?
[01:22.220 --> 01:22.700]  They do.
[01:25.180 --> 01:29.620]  And so what, so is each section a different cultivar?
[01:30.860 --> 01:35.180]  And the bar one or over there, those are strawberry bananas.
[01:35.260 --> 01:35.540]  Yeah.
[01:36.940 --> 01:37.980]  These are wedding cake.
[01:38.820 --> 01:40.060]  And those are gas leak.
[01:42.540 --> 01:44.380]  And then how'd you settle on those three?
[01:44.420 --> 01:45.900]  Like, where'd you get them from?
[01:46.900 --> 01:49.860]  I got them from LA genetics was LA genetics.
[01:51.620 --> 01:52.540]  I'd have to look it up.
[01:54.860 --> 01:56.540]  And you're generally, you're happy with it.
[01:56.980 --> 02:02.540]  Well, I've grown the wedding cake before my last operation was closed.
[02:02.980 --> 02:08.180]  And this is a little bit different than the variety that I was growing, but I was
[02:08.180 --> 02:08.820]  always happy.
[02:08.820 --> 02:10.420]  And so it was my customer base.
[02:12.140 --> 02:14.820]  And I've grown the strawberry banana before as well.
[02:16.980 --> 02:21.020]  These are a thousand watt HPS single ended bulbs.
[02:22.020 --> 02:22.660]  Old school.
[02:22.780 --> 02:27.420]  And you, uh, and you have one, two, three, four, five, you have six in total.
[02:27.420 --> 02:29.300]  And for how many square feet basically?
[02:29.660 --> 02:33.860]  Uh, I guess the canopy in here is about 96 square feet.
[02:33.900 --> 02:35.540]  Each table is a four by eight.
[02:36.100 --> 02:39.940]  So that's 32 square feet times three.
[02:43.460 --> 02:49.020]  And then you basically have this on a, uh, basically.
[02:49.340 --> 02:50.300]  Totally automated.
[02:50.740 --> 02:56.620]  It's a 55 gallon drum and I'll use that for three days.
[02:57.660 --> 03:03.300]  The plants are drinking anywhere from 10 to let's say at this later stage, 15
[03:03.300 --> 03:05.140]  gallons a day.
[03:06.180 --> 03:12.540]  And so I'll use this mix for three days and then whatever's left, I dump and
[03:12.540 --> 03:13.100]  refill.
[03:14.100 --> 03:14.300]  Got it.
[03:15.100 --> 03:22.100]  A and B and all the other nutrients, uh, that are needed during the different
[03:22.100 --> 03:22.940]  stages.
[03:23.020 --> 03:26.540]  And so what are some of those that you'd like to add at different stages?
[03:26.540 --> 03:29.980]  Let's talk like when they're, when they're rewounds.
[03:30.820 --> 03:34.980]  Well, in the beginning of the A and B, the grow is pretty simple.
[03:34.980 --> 03:40.100]  So you have an A and B, you have a B vitamin, a Zyme.
[03:43.580 --> 03:47.580]  And a CalMag basically calcium, magnesium.
[03:50.770 --> 03:53.250]  And then as you kind of progress, what's going on?
[03:53.610 --> 03:54.930]  Like what, what are you adding?
[03:55.570 --> 03:59.530]  Well, later in the stage you'll add a silica to provide strength.
[04:00.650 --> 04:08.370]  Uh, and I guess density as far as the base of your plant and then add it to, to
[04:09.290 --> 04:10.530]  promote root growth.
[04:11.370 --> 04:19.890]  And then in the beginning stages of flowering, I'll add a potassium and a
[04:19.890 --> 04:26.130]  nitrogen additive for the first couple of weeks and then phase that out.
[04:26.130 --> 04:26.650]  For what?
[04:27.650 --> 04:35.250]  The, the nitrogen based additive helps keep the plants green because in the
[04:35.250 --> 04:41.250]  changeover from metal halide to HPS, it can be light shock and then that will
[04:41.250 --> 04:42.890]  start yellowing out your leaves.
[04:45.210 --> 04:51.650]  And the nitrogen helps number one with the continued root development as well as
[04:51.650 --> 04:54.770]  the, uh, keeps the leaves nice and green.
[04:56.970 --> 04:59.370]  And then as we're nearing the finish line,
[04:59.570 --> 05:07.520]  When you're nearing the finish line, you want to give some sweeteners and a Bud
[05:07.520 --> 05:16.320]  Hardener, a bat guano provides a little bit of a taste as well for that old school
[05:18.120 --> 05:19.400]  terpene development.
[05:21.520 --> 05:27.320]  And through the stages you'll want to give a little bit of a sweetener.
[05:27.320 --> 05:34.080]  And through the stages you'll ramp up your PPM, which is your parts per million
[05:34.120 --> 05:36.080]  as far as the nutrient level.
[05:36.560 --> 05:39.400]  And then at the end you'll start to phase that off.
[05:40.480 --> 05:44.240]  So what do you peak at from a PPM standpoint?
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.760]  I'd say about 14 to 1500.
[05:48.360 --> 05:52.960]  If it gets to 1600, that's not really a big worry, but not really any higher than
[05:52.960 --> 05:53.120]  that.
[05:53.240 --> 06:02.800]  And then, so talk about what you were like back in, I mean, were you in the city in
[06:02.800 --> 06:03.080]  New York?
[06:03.800 --> 06:10.720]  Yeah, I mean, I grew up in New York and I've had grows in Manhattan, Queens and
[06:10.720 --> 06:11.080]  Brooklyn.
[06:12.800 --> 06:13.320]  What was that like?
[06:15.880 --> 06:17.880]  Like just in an apartment or like in a warehouse?
[06:17.880 --> 06:21.520]  I started out in an apartment that was above mine.
[06:21.680 --> 06:22.920]  That was above mine.
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.520]  I subletted an apartment when one of my neighbors was moving out and they wanted to
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.440]  keep the apartment.
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.160]  So I subletted it for a couple of years and that's where I taught myself how to grow.
[06:35.360 --> 06:42.680]  And then later on, I was able to get a warehouse and expanded from there.
[06:45.880 --> 06:50.000]  And kind of what were, what was this like in the mid 90s?
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.400]  Yeah, mid 90s.
[06:52.600 --> 06:55.200]  So what was hot in New York in the mid 90s?
[06:55.640 --> 07:00.640]  Well, the genetics that I had available to me were, you know, few and far between
[07:00.640 --> 07:07.000]  because it's not like you can broadcast what you're doing and it's hard to find
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.440]  like minded individuals.
[07:08.440 --> 07:10.320]  So everybody keeps to themselves.
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.200]  Actually, let's go out.
[07:13.200 --> 07:15.760]  We'll just do the rest of it as audio.
[07:16.040 --> 07:16.320]  Yep.
[07:16.960 --> 07:19.400]  And so actually you're keeping it pretty cool in there.
[07:19.920 --> 07:20.840]  At nighttime, yeah.
[07:22.160 --> 07:26.360]  Well, no, I'm saying like right now during the day, it feels like it's like in the
[07:26.360 --> 07:26.880]  60s.
[07:27.040 --> 07:28.520]  It's about 68 in there.
[07:28.560 --> 07:28.840]  Yeah.
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.720]  And I can check my greenhouse grower controller to tell you exactly where it's
[07:33.720 --> 07:33.880]  at.
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.960]  But do you feel the need to keep it that cool?
[07:36.240 --> 07:37.600]  In the later stages, yes.
[07:37.640 --> 07:37.960]  Okay.
[07:37.960 --> 07:42.160]  That promotes the purpleness that would come out.
[07:42.600 --> 07:48.720]  So, so in like kind of peak growth, you don't feel like you need to keep it that
[07:49.000 --> 07:49.560]  no.
[07:49.560 --> 07:55.040]  And in peak growth, I go anywhere from 72 to 78 and maybe as high as 80.
[07:55.280 --> 07:57.080]  Yeah, that's kind of where I was getting that.
[07:57.160 --> 07:57.480]  Yeah.
[07:59.680 --> 08:05.240]  And then, okay, so what, so you were growing what in New York in the 90s?
[08:05.720 --> 08:13.560]  In the 90s, I was growing Northern Lights, a Hawaiian and an Afghan.
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.160]  Okay.
[08:14.680 --> 08:18.160]  And where were you sourcing those genetics from, given that you couldn't be like,
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.200]  hey, everybody, I flew over to Amsterdam to get seeds.
[08:21.240 --> 08:21.480]  Okay.
[08:22.080 --> 08:22.360]  Got it.
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.560]  I smuggled them back and, uh, yeah, started the process.
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.760]  And what was, okay, so that's what you're growing in New York.
[08:36.840 --> 08:40.760]  And then you moved out to Seattle.
[08:41.040 --> 08:41.960]  I moved to Seattle.
[08:42.360 --> 08:49.400]  Uh, basically any of these underground operations that I've had haven't really
[08:49.400 --> 08:55.680]  lasted more than three years and there's no good time for a bad thing to happen.
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.640]  So when it happens, you're not necessarily prepared for something like that to go
[09:00.640 --> 09:03.720]  wrong, but then you have to deal with the consequences.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.680]  So did something happen in New York?
[09:06.040 --> 09:06.320]  Yeah.
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.320]  The warehouse that I had, which was my major source of income was broken into.
[09:13.320 --> 09:20.600]  And the police showed up and arrested the thieves and then put the grow on them.
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.840]  So I was able to come out of that unscathed.
[09:25.880 --> 09:31.200]  So they got the double whammy of breaking in and then being accused of it being their
[09:31.200 --> 09:32.040]  grow operation.
[09:32.040 --> 09:32.320]  Yeah.
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.600]  And so you just never went back to that space?
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.160]  Exactly.
[09:37.480 --> 09:37.720]  Yeah.
[09:37.880 --> 09:38.560]  Wash my hands.
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.000]  I didn't.
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.280]  Were they trying to steal the flower or the flower, trying to find money or?
[09:43.880 --> 09:45.880]  Usually, you know, you keep those two separate.
[09:46.360 --> 09:46.440]  Right.
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.120]  There's no reason to keep finished product in your grow or money.
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.800]  And did they know, so they knew that you had just harvested or?
[09:55.400 --> 09:57.600]  No, it was right before I was going to harvest too.
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.280]  It was really hard blow and the smells weren't entirely contained at that point
[10:03.320 --> 10:05.560]  because they were really, really stinky at that point.
[10:05.560 --> 10:10.000]  And so you think someone smelled it, told their friends and their friends came in?
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.560]  Yeah, I mean, as large as New York is, it's also a small, tight knit community,
[10:14.840 --> 10:16.920]  especially in that arena.
[10:17.320 --> 10:21.320]  And the warehouse that I had was a grow before.
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.120]  So the.
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.920]  I guess the nuance is that if it was a grow then, then it's a grow now.
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.480]  So let's see.
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.320]  So if they were arrested, they were arrested.
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.600]  I found out I knew who it was.
[10:34.640 --> 10:36.840]  And were you like, oh, I know those guys.
[10:36.880 --> 10:37.760]  I knew who they were.
[10:37.800 --> 10:37.960]  Yeah.
[10:38.000 --> 10:38.320]  Okay.
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.000]  Were you like, you guys are assholes?
[10:40.040 --> 10:40.720]  No question.
[10:40.760 --> 10:41.000]  Right.
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.600]  And then, okay.
[10:43.600 --> 10:45.080]  So that's why you left New York.
[10:45.760 --> 10:47.840]  That was the beginning of the end.
[10:47.880 --> 10:51.080]  So after that, it was that warehouse.
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.720]  It's about, there were two levels or about 25 to.
[10:57.560 --> 10:58.880]  22 on each floor.
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.760]  So one floor was 25 to 22.
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.200]  And both were going.
[11:03.720 --> 11:04.560]  On opposite.
[11:04.600 --> 11:09.600]  And you were getting like four turns out of each room.
[11:09.600 --> 11:16.560]  I had a vegetative room, so they were popping every four to five weeks.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.640]  I was harvesting one or the other.
[11:19.760 --> 11:20.080]  Okay.
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.240]  Then, then you go to Seattle and you kind of go to New York and you go to New York.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.760]  And then you go to New York and you go to New York and you go to New York.
[11:26.760 --> 11:28.520]  And then you go to New York and you go to New York.
[11:28.520 --> 11:29.480]  And then you go to New York.
[11:29.480 --> 11:33.320]  And then you go to Seattle and you kind of like, did you know people there or you just.
[11:33.400 --> 11:33.600]  Yeah.
[11:33.600 --> 11:39.400]  So then when the warehouse closed down before I moved to Seattle, I bought a
[11:39.400 --> 11:42.240]  house upstate and then grew upstate.
[11:42.440 --> 11:42.760]  New York.
[11:43.040 --> 11:43.280]  Yeah.
[11:43.320 --> 11:43.600]  Okay.
[11:43.880 --> 11:45.120]  Now right outside of Albany.
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.320]  And that was a commute of about an hour and 45 minutes, two hours each way.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.240]  And I did that for about two years.
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.360]  And then during a storm, the transformer blew.
[12:00.480 --> 12:08.240]  And when the power company came to replace it and I was obviously paying for power, I
[12:08.240 --> 12:14.280]  wasn't stealing it, but they saw that there was a lot of usage in that area.
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.360]  And so they visited my house and on paper, my house was listed as a farm.
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.800]  So it wasn't out of source that a farm would be using that sort of power.
[12:25.200 --> 12:29.200]  But then when they saw it was just a residence, they investigated further.
[12:29.520 --> 12:33.520]  And then alerted the authorities and then closed it down.
[12:35.360 --> 12:36.040]  That was.
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.640]  And how many square feet do you have going up there?
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.480]  I had about 30 lights in that house.
[12:43.840 --> 12:48.440]  And so the cops come and like, did you take off or did you.
[12:49.520 --> 12:55.720]  I had somebody working for me at that point and they were going back and forth and they
[12:56.160 --> 12:57.560]  followed that person.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.840]  And then.
[13:03.200 --> 13:09.480]  They arrested them, they detained them and they sung, they were terrified at the
[13:09.480 --> 13:15.920]  prospect of being locked up, they were green green card holder and they scared them
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.640]  into telling them what was going on.
[13:18.080 --> 13:23.200]  And so they were arrested and then they put out a warrant for my arrest and then I
[13:23.200 --> 13:25.320]  surrendered and.
[13:26.800 --> 13:27.800]  Started that whole.
[13:29.200 --> 13:31.360]  Horrible process, so what was the outcome of that?
[13:32.120 --> 13:40.040]  They wanted to give me a felony and give me jail time, but the land that I was on was
[13:40.040 --> 13:46.000]  privately owned and they were on my property dressed as the power company.
[13:46.120 --> 13:49.800]  So there were a bunch of holes in the way that they approached it.
[13:50.160 --> 13:55.800]  And I just held Pat and my lawyer told them that I wasn't willing to take a plea.
[13:56.600 --> 14:02.080]  And at the end of that, I accepted a misdemeanor charge with time served.
[14:03.120 --> 14:05.680]  So it was basically a slap on the wrist.
[14:05.680 --> 14:07.120]  I didn't even really have to pay a fine.
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.000]  So basically they like didn't do the warrant process properly.
[14:11.000 --> 14:11.600]  Exactly.
[14:12.240 --> 14:13.840]  You got off on technicalities.
[14:13.840 --> 14:14.080]  Yep.
[14:15.280 --> 14:16.800]  Thank God for technicalities.
[14:17.600 --> 14:19.600]  All right. So so then you move out west.
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.040]  Then I asked buddies, you know, like, what can I do?
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.680]  You know, I've got to recreate myself.
[14:24.680 --> 14:26.760]  You know, do you have any opportunities for me?
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.360]  And so I moved out to Seattle and worked with some people that I had known from New
[14:32.360 --> 14:35.320]  York and started growing for them.
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.280]  They had a small underground network and they were on the cusp of going legal.
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.560]  And they had a really genuine genetic that they were working with that was highly
[14:51.560 --> 14:53.000]  touted, it was it was an O.G.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.640]  strain. And I grew that for them and I increased their production and all their
[14:59.640 --> 15:05.480]  various grows and taught the people that they had in their underground network how
[15:05.480 --> 15:07.120]  to get more out of the plants.
[15:07.920 --> 15:11.240]  And then they opened their dispensary.
[15:11.280 --> 15:12.400]  All right. So two things.
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.360]  Tell me about the genetics and like everything from how it grew to how it looked as
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.240]  a cola, to how it smelled, to how it smoked.
[15:20.240 --> 15:25.560]  And then also what were some of the things they were or were not doing that you were
[15:25.560 --> 15:29.320]  like, oh, let's do X, Y and Z and increase yield.
[15:29.320 --> 15:29.560]  And.
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.120]  Well, the genetics that they were working with was an O.G.
[15:35.200 --> 15:41.440]  I guess I don't necessarily want to be too specific as to which one, but they had an
[15:41.440 --> 15:42.480]  original O.G.
[15:43.040 --> 15:44.600]  and O.G.
[15:44.600 --> 15:45.920]  is a notoriously finicky.
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.280]  And so you have to provide the correct environment for them to thrive.
[15:51.880 --> 15:55.400]  And so they like a high humidity and vegetative state.
[15:55.680 --> 16:00.680]  And then that humidity has to drop off at a certain stage in order to get the most out
[16:00.680 --> 16:04.240]  of the plant. Also, the plant was kind of
[16:05.360 --> 16:11.880]  spindly in that if you didn't train it, then the branches wouldn't be strong enough to
[16:11.880 --> 16:14.920]  hold the buds that you actually would want out of that.
[16:15.360 --> 16:22.120]  And so I set up trellis systems for them, controlled their environment and then not
[16:22.120 --> 16:30.840]  so much super crop as actually training the plants, giving them stress along their
[16:31.040 --> 16:34.240]  growing period in order to make them stronger.
[16:35.840 --> 16:45.400]  OK. And so that was Seattle, and then from there you came out here from Seattle, I
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.480]  moved to Oakland.
[16:47.760 --> 16:54.160]  OK. And then I lived in Oakland with a buddy of mine and he had to grow underneath his
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.680]  house and we grew a great ape and.
[17:01.360 --> 17:03.760]  The ballpark, what year was this?
[17:04.200 --> 17:05.400]  This was.
[17:06.560 --> 17:13.880]  At this point, about eight years ago, so 2011, 2010 to 2011, I lived in Oakland.
[17:15.600 --> 17:22.240]  And we grew grape ape and the shatter scene was just burgeoning, so we would sell our
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.040]  flower and then turn all the waste into shatter.
[17:25.520 --> 17:29.120]  And we were working with different dispensaries in the area.
[17:29.720 --> 17:36.320]  And the problems that I ran into there was that my partner had one way of doing things
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.800]  and I had another. And so too many cooks in the kitchen.
[17:40.280 --> 17:42.800]  So the hearts weren't always uniform.
[17:43.200 --> 17:46.920]  And so at the end of the day, it wasn't as profitable as it could have been.
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.080]  And he didn't want to acquiesce as to his control.
[17:52.520 --> 17:59.320]  And I had my way of doing things, problem beings that I was going back and forth from
[17:59.520 --> 18:05.200]  Oakland to the East Coast to visit my children because I hadn't saved enough money in
[18:05.200 --> 18:08.560]  order to move them and I hadn't narrowed down a place where I was willing to move my
[18:08.560 --> 18:13.480]  family. Oakland is an armpit, not a place that I wanted to raise my children.
[18:14.480 --> 18:17.760]  So at some point, our relationship became untenable.
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.040]  And a buddy of mine who lived in L.A.
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.520]  had an opportunity for me to take over a grow that wasn't doing well.
[18:25.800 --> 18:27.440]  And so I moved to Los Angeles.
[18:28.960 --> 18:32.600]  And then what what were you growing there?
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.560]  And when I first came to L.A., the blue dream.
[18:38.200 --> 18:39.280]  It's a popular stream.
[18:39.280 --> 18:41.480]  Popular stream. I can't go wrong with that.
[18:41.680 --> 18:42.720]  So talk to me.
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.120]  I mean, New York, upstate New York, New York City, upstate New York, Seattle, Oakland,
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.600]  down to L.A. like what are some of the differences you noticed in each market, like in
[18:52.600 --> 18:56.920]  terms of what what's hot, what's selling, what people want?
[18:58.240 --> 19:06.480]  On the East Coast at that point, there was a big cry for sour diesel and purple haze.
[19:07.040 --> 19:12.840]  And I guess a lot of the sour diesel was coming from the West Coast and the purple haze
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.360]  was coming from basically Florida.
[19:16.240 --> 19:19.120]  And I had a niche market.
[19:19.640 --> 19:25.880]  I was growing strawberry cough at that point, right before everything went haywire.
[19:26.400 --> 19:35.840]  And that was a sativa indica cross, mostly sativa, which had a really nice effect in
[19:35.840 --> 19:38.320]  that you could smoke it and not be couched.
[19:39.440 --> 19:42.480]  And then it would let you off nicely.
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.560]  Could be creative on it and whatnot.
[19:45.560 --> 19:51.720]  And so I was supplying the underground to spend, I mean, delivery services at that
[19:51.720 --> 20:02.720]  point. I think that once I moved to Seattle, then that being a West Coast market, the
[20:02.720 --> 20:08.200]  OGs were really what the public was crying for and really wanted.
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.160]  And I found that to be consistent from there down to down here.
[20:14.400 --> 20:23.400]  So the the blue dream, I think, didn't have a big hold in the East Coast.
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.720]  They call it pretend to go.
[20:27.040 --> 20:31.600]  You know, it smells nice, it looks nice, but it doesn't, you know, wacky over the head.
[20:32.080 --> 20:38.160]  You know, it's not for the streets and it did very well in dispensaries.
[20:38.440 --> 20:39.560]  They couldn't get enough of it.
[20:40.160 --> 20:47.640]  But the the market here also feeds the market over there.
[20:47.960 --> 20:53.840]  So you kind of have to, especially in the underground market at that point, had to.
[20:54.840 --> 21:01.040]  Focus on where your market was and where you were getting the most money for your end
[21:01.040 --> 21:08.760]  product, and it seemed that everybody who was working in New York in the industry had a
[21:08.760 --> 21:09.920]  friend in California.
[21:10.760 --> 21:13.880]  So a lot a lot of times the.
[21:15.120 --> 21:19.480]  And product would go out of state, and I think that that's still true.
[21:20.480 --> 21:27.080]  And the dispensary market was not something that once I had my own operation, I was
[21:27.080 --> 21:31.520]  particularly interested in because of the way that the payout works.
[21:32.680 --> 21:33.800]  They weren't paying.
[21:35.760 --> 21:40.320]  Cash on a barrelhead, you had to go back and forth and have it on consignment.
[21:41.360 --> 21:44.920]  That's not necessarily the most attractive option.
[21:45.640 --> 21:48.200]  When you get paid upon delivery.
[21:50.440 --> 21:55.560]  Talk about kind of pricing trends over the past however many years.
[21:55.760 --> 21:56.840]  Oh, my goodness.
[21:56.920 --> 21:59.840]  Yeah. What was the best year per pound?
[22:01.640 --> 22:06.440]  In the early 90s, I was getting anywhere from fifty five hundred to six thousand a
[22:06.440 --> 22:12.480]  pound. And when I first started in the game, I was a middleman.
[22:13.480 --> 22:20.280]  And I would get my product from the Midwest where I went to school and sell it to the
[22:20.360 --> 22:21.920]  underground market in New York.
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.240]  There came a time where I was the stuff that was grown in the Midwest.
[22:26.240 --> 22:26.920]  Yeah. OK.
[22:28.600 --> 22:31.840]  And the and so tell me about the Midwest market.
[22:32.160 --> 22:33.440]  Like are we talking like Michigan?
[22:33.440 --> 22:36.200]  Like is what's kind of the dominant Midwest?
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.480]  Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky.
[22:39.920 --> 22:40.920]  OK. Area.
[22:42.200 --> 22:50.120]  The farmers out there, they grow corn basically and the secondary market is
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.200]  marijuana. So they're growing outdoors.
[22:53.240 --> 22:54.400]  Yeah. This is outdoor.
[22:55.120 --> 22:56.960]  And they're just kind of hiding it in the cornfield.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  Exactly that.
[22:58.480 --> 23:03.120]  Exactly that. So the the farmers out there.
[23:03.160 --> 23:04.640]  And this is like early 90s.
[23:04.840 --> 23:06.800]  This is late 80s, early 90s.
[23:07.240 --> 23:10.280]  And what were kind of the dominant like Midwestern?
[23:11.960 --> 23:17.800]  Back then, the strange, there weren't really anything, any real names that were
[23:17.800 --> 23:21.440]  attached to the product, it was either good or it wasn't.
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.480]  Right.
[23:24.080 --> 23:30.320]  Largely indica based, some sativas, but, you know, for on boats, you know, like
[23:30.640 --> 23:32.280]  healthy, healthy, outdoor.
[23:33.920 --> 23:34.920]  Excellent product.
[23:35.160 --> 23:36.160]  OK.
[23:39.080 --> 23:46.160]  There came a time, though, where the cocaine dealers in New York switched from
[23:46.160 --> 23:53.400]  that business to the marijuana business and the opportunities available for
[23:53.400 --> 23:56.840]  middlemen dried up unless you could speak Spanish.
[23:57.800 --> 24:04.880]  So I was getting squeezed out of that market and I adapted and became a producer.
[24:05.480 --> 24:06.560]  Rather than a middleman.
[24:06.840 --> 24:08.280]  And that's what drove me to start growing.
[24:08.280 --> 24:12.560]  So why is that? Because if you're sourcing from the Midwest, it's not Spanish
[24:12.560 --> 24:15.040]  speaking and you're selling in New York where.
[24:16.360 --> 24:18.640]  Is it because there was a lot of Mexican weed coming up?
[24:19.400 --> 24:21.720]  It came from everywhere, basically.
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.760]  Mexico, California.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  Right.
[24:26.480 --> 24:29.080]  But not speaking Spanish was a hindrance.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.320]  To the underground market.
[24:32.320 --> 24:33.520]  Yeah. The.
[24:34.720 --> 24:37.280]  Major outlets for.
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.560]  Retail were basically the.
[24:44.880 --> 24:49.080]  Delivery services and corner street sellers.
[24:50.360 --> 24:51.800]  So like the Mr. Nice guys.
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.120]  Yeah, it's half baked.
[24:56.280 --> 24:58.600]  And there was a large.
[25:00.200 --> 25:01.480]  I guess marketplace.
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.200]  At the bridge and tunnel points.
[25:06.200 --> 25:10.120]  So across from the George Washington Bridge is Washington Heights.
[25:12.360 --> 25:18.160]  Very well known drug market and the out of staters will come over the bridge.
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.760]  Stop in that area to get there and then just go right and go right back.
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.560]  So I had connections up there, but that community is all Latin.
[25:28.800 --> 25:29.800]  OK, yeah.
[25:30.120 --> 25:33.560]  So it basically changed from the Harlem guys.
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.720]  To the Latin guys.
[25:39.200 --> 25:40.200]  Being the.
[25:42.600 --> 25:46.040]  Gangs that were controlling what industries?
[25:47.040 --> 25:52.920]  I lived on one hundred and forty second and Broadway for about a year and a half.
[25:52.920 --> 25:56.720]  Right. So that's like the middle ground between Washington Heights and Harlem.
[25:56.840 --> 26:01.800]  OK, so so that's when you were like, I need to be growing my own so I don't have to deal with.
[26:02.920 --> 26:06.000]  There was a lot more competition and the numbers started dropping.
[26:06.920 --> 26:14.240]  So the numbers went from five, five, six down to five and then from five down to forty five.
[26:14.680 --> 26:17.400]  At forty five, I'm, you know, I'm tripping out now.
[26:19.280 --> 26:21.760]  I was making so much more money just a minute ago.
[26:21.880 --> 26:22.880]  And so. All right.
[26:22.880 --> 26:25.960]  So and it's down to forty five around what year?
[26:28.520 --> 26:29.520]  That had to be.
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.320]  Two thousand, two thousand one.
[26:36.920 --> 26:42.120]  And maybe late 90s that late 90s, early 2000s.
[26:42.920 --> 26:48.120]  And then as you move to like six, seven, eight, nine, ten, you know,
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.280]  early 2000s.
[26:50.040 --> 26:54.080]  And then as you move to like Seattle, which was what, late.
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.160]  Almost like 10 years later.
[26:58.280 --> 27:02.640]  Yeah. At that point, it had dropped to about between twenty eight and thirty two.
[27:05.820 --> 27:09.300]  Oakland in 2011, it was around twenty eight.
[27:10.540 --> 27:11.540]  Then dropped to.
[27:12.740 --> 27:13.740]  Between.
[27:15.020 --> 27:19.340]  Twenty eight, sometimes twenty six, depending upon when the outdoors came down.
[27:20.500 --> 27:24.740]  And then when I moved to Los Angeles, it was pretty steady at twenty eight.
[27:26.300 --> 27:27.460]  And that went from twenty eight.
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.420]  And this is for all high end.
[27:29.900 --> 27:31.020]  Yeah. All high end indoor.
[27:31.460 --> 27:32.460]  That was my market.
[27:33.900 --> 27:42.460]  And then the bottom of the market was like late 2017 and the 2018.
[27:43.220 --> 27:46.940]  And down to like sixteen hundred, fourteen hundred.
[27:48.580 --> 27:49.580]  For.
[27:50.180 --> 27:51.700]  Bomb, bomb indoors.
[27:51.740 --> 27:52.740]  Right.
[27:54.140 --> 27:57.020]  And then now what are you kind of seeing it climbing back up to?
[27:57.780 --> 28:00.060]  Well, recently it's gone.
[28:02.060 --> 28:05.860]  Look, six, eight months ago, it was still around 16, 18.
[28:06.380 --> 28:09.100]  And right now it's twenty two to twenty eight.
[28:09.100 --> 28:10.100]  Nineteen.
[28:10.500 --> 28:13.860]  And now we're September, basically twenty nineteen.
[28:14.300 --> 28:15.460]  Twenty two to twenty eight.
[28:17.540 --> 28:21.500]  And what are your projections for you think it's going to hold steady there?
[28:22.340 --> 28:23.340]  The.
[28:24.420 --> 28:29.100]  The government has gotten involved because it's pushed back from big companies to get
[28:29.100 --> 28:30.220]  rid of the black market.
[28:31.020 --> 28:36.420]  And there's been a lot of closures of warehouses.
[28:37.420 --> 28:42.660]  As of late and also a crackdown on the light up and outdoor farming.
[28:44.460 --> 28:45.460]  That's on license.
[28:45.500 --> 28:46.500]  The diesel.
[28:46.660 --> 28:47.780]  Right. The diesel market.
[28:48.060 --> 28:49.060]  Yeah.
[28:51.260 --> 28:54.660]  So that's drawn prices up again.
[28:54.980 --> 28:58.620]  And so whoever's still in business is obviously benefiting from that.
[29:01.860 --> 29:03.140]  So it's become a commodity.
[29:03.940 --> 29:08.100]  And then there's obviously because of that, there's higher demand.
[29:08.140 --> 29:09.340]  It's spurring that.
[29:12.300 --> 29:15.380]  And talk about because you said you've also grown outdoors to.
[29:16.340 --> 29:18.340]  I've grown outdoors a couple of different times.
[29:18.900 --> 29:19.900]  The.
[29:20.700 --> 29:26.580]  Product isn't as good and certainly for my market, the.
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.420]  The discerning customer.
[29:30.660 --> 29:33.580]  Just look at this. I just want to make sure that they are pulled out.
[29:33.860 --> 29:39.740]  But but when you're defining a good product, is it based on like look and THC?
[29:41.660 --> 29:45.500]  Old school heads can tell whether or not it's grown outdoors and grown indoors.
[29:46.220 --> 29:47.220]  Some people can't.
[29:47.660 --> 29:53.140]  And so there are some times where you'll get a light that that's passing for an
[29:53.140 --> 29:54.980]  end. And.
[29:55.980 --> 30:02.580]  I guess certainly there's more margins to be made there, but I like my product to
[30:02.580 --> 30:07.100]  sell itself and I don't want to have anybody come back and tell me that it wasn't
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.100]  what I said it was.
[30:08.940 --> 30:13.420]  So I've always dealt with environments that I can control.
[30:13.660 --> 30:17.420]  And if I'm going to put my stamp on it, it's going to be the bomb.
[30:17.780 --> 30:18.780]  Hey, number one.
[30:19.780 --> 30:25.900]  In growing outdoors, there are so many variables that you can't control, and so
[30:25.900 --> 30:32.340]  then you're at the whim of nature and the like I said, the end product is is
[30:33.180 --> 30:34.620]  certainly not up to snuff.
[30:35.940 --> 30:38.820]  Well, I think it depends to who, though, because I know plenty of right.
[30:38.860 --> 30:46.180]  Amazing cultivators who are old school people who can tell indoor and don't like
[30:46.700 --> 30:51.300]  right. I know this is an allure to the sun grown product.
[30:52.660 --> 30:57.340]  Like for me, I'm always kind of like you don't drink wine that was grown from
[30:57.340 --> 30:58.500]  grapes and door.
[30:58.740 --> 31:06.060]  No, it's kind of like like I feel like indoor obviously has the bag appeal because
[31:06.060 --> 31:14.700]  it looks perfect and you can crank up the kind of THC percentages and really for the
[31:14.700 --> 31:16.500]  streets, that's the end result.
[31:16.500 --> 31:22.220]  That's how I guess what I'm getting at is like the judgment of what is and is not
[31:22.220 --> 31:23.900]  good is different for different people.
[31:23.940 --> 31:24.940]  Right. Right.
[31:25.260 --> 31:26.700]  So your average L.A.
[31:26.700 --> 31:31.060]  market consumer is basically does this look like a shiny red apple?
[31:31.060 --> 31:33.900]  And is it dripping with THC?
[31:34.340 --> 31:35.340]  Exactly.
[31:36.340 --> 31:41.500]  What about when a like kind of purple punch and kind of the.
[31:44.100 --> 31:50.060]  Like I'm just thinking of things that were desirable and like trends, you've
[31:50.060 --> 31:53.020]  noticed that have become fads and desirable in the market.
[31:54.940 --> 32:02.420]  I guess there's a lot of different strains that have presented themselves that I
[32:02.500 --> 32:06.220]  guess get some noise, but then that noise kind of quiets down.
[32:06.700 --> 32:14.500]  So it may be hot for a minute and then it's not Gorilla Glue, for instance.
[32:14.500 --> 32:17.700]  Like there was a time where you couldn't grow enough of it.
[32:18.260 --> 32:22.460]  And then people was like, well, OK, I've had enough of that.
[32:23.140 --> 32:26.780]  And so then you have all this Gorilla Glue and then you can't get rid of it.
[32:27.420 --> 32:34.180]  And so then another strain will be heard in a rap song or whatnot, and then it
[32:34.180 --> 32:36.700]  becomes desirable and then you run to that.
[32:37.700 --> 32:41.580]  For me, I try and stick with the tried and true.
[32:42.180 --> 32:46.940]  Oh, geez, will always be marketable because they do what you want them to do.
[32:46.980 --> 32:52.220]  And it's a smell that's reminiscent of what you're accustomed to.
[32:53.260 --> 32:54.980]  Much the same as a sour diesel.
[32:56.980 --> 33:02.420]  I think that a lot of these strains are really nothing but residual from Northern
[33:02.420 --> 33:05.380]  Lights, the grandfather of all.
[33:08.140 --> 33:16.300]  The land race strains, and so for me, I can't really gamble on.
[33:17.620 --> 33:24.380]  The what's new, what's hot right now, I can't feed my family that way, it takes a dip
[33:24.700 --> 33:29.900]  in the market and then doesn't get what I thought it was going to three months ago
[33:30.100 --> 33:31.740]  after going through that process.
[33:32.220 --> 33:40.260]  So I've always stuck to what is tried and true and is representative of what my
[33:40.260 --> 33:41.220]  market wants.
[33:42.420 --> 33:46.460]  Well, how about this, if we forget the market, if you were just growing for
[33:46.460 --> 33:52.260]  yourself. Oh, well, those purples, they taste nice, you know, and give you a nice
[33:52.260 --> 33:59.940]  effect. But as a grower, for instance, purples take a lot longer to vegetate than
[33:59.940 --> 34:01.140]  some of the other strains.
[34:01.460 --> 34:06.060]  So then your calendar is extended and then it costs you more to produce it.
[34:06.420 --> 34:10.820]  And you're not necessarily getting more for the product at the end of the day.
[34:11.100 --> 34:16.260]  So if it were me, first of all, for me, it's not a hobby.
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.420]  It's a way of life.
[34:17.980 --> 34:22.460]  But if I were just growing for myself, I would have all those different varieties
[34:22.460 --> 34:27.500]  because they taste nice, they have different effects, and they all I guess they have
[34:27.500 --> 34:29.260]  their moments when you would want to consume them.
[34:29.260 --> 34:34.980]  Right. When you said the purples take a lot, why is that that they take longer?
[34:36.020 --> 34:37.780]  Is it the flowering stage that takes longer?
[34:37.780 --> 34:38.780]  No, it's the vegetative.
[34:38.940 --> 34:39.300]  OK.
[34:41.820 --> 34:46.260]  Genetics do different things, you know, some plants mature faster than others, just
[34:46.260 --> 34:47.740]  like kids.
[34:48.580 --> 34:49.820]  OK, yeah.
[34:49.820 --> 34:53.940]  And I think that's a big driver, especially in the indoor market of like, you know, if
[34:53.940 --> 34:59.940]  you look at the past 30 years of what people have bred towards, right, it's like
[34:59.940 --> 35:04.540]  short plants, you know, fast flowering.
[35:06.060 --> 35:10.860]  I had this strain called Sensi Star.
[35:11.860 --> 35:18.460]  It took two, two and a half weeks to grow large enough to flower and with flower in
[35:18.460 --> 35:21.460]  six weeks, start to finish.
[35:21.780 --> 35:22.700]  It was awesome.
[35:25.020 --> 35:27.980]  Once my warehouse was closed, I lost the strain.
[35:29.780 --> 35:31.420]  Same with the strawberry.
[35:31.780 --> 35:33.420]  Actually, we used to call it strawberry.
[35:33.420 --> 35:35.620]  I think now it's more referred to as strawberry cough.
[35:36.540 --> 35:38.540]  But that was a wonderful plant.
[35:39.540 --> 35:44.540]  So the Sensi, that would be an example of something from a long time ago that you wish
[35:44.540 --> 35:45.540]  you could get your hands on.
[35:45.540 --> 35:46.540]  Oh, certainly.
[35:47.540 --> 35:51.540]  I'm pretty sure it has its roots from the Netherlands.
[35:52.060 --> 36:01.260]  But so another strain that I really liked was, was it AK-47?
[36:01.260 --> 36:02.260]  Yeah.
[36:02.260 --> 36:03.260]  Yeah.
[36:03.980 --> 36:11.420]  That string grew vigorously and in different systems, you know, it'll grow at
[36:11.420 --> 36:17.820]  different rates. But I had this NFT system that I was using and they really thrived in
[36:17.820 --> 36:19.820]  that system and literally.
[36:19.820 --> 36:20.820]  What's NFT stand for?
[36:21.340 --> 36:22.580]  Nutrient film technique.
[36:24.540 --> 36:29.900]  And the buds that were coming off of that plant was as large as your head.
[36:30.900 --> 36:35.900]  Christmas tree size, like plants that were, you know, eight feet tall, six to eight feet
[36:35.900 --> 36:36.900]  tall.
[36:36.900 --> 36:37.900]  And where were you at this point?
[36:37.900 --> 36:38.900]  That was when I was in Brooklyn.
[36:38.900 --> 36:39.900]  In Brooklyn, okay.
[36:41.900 --> 36:42.900]  Massive.
[36:43.900 --> 36:45.900]  And you can't get that, you can't find that?
[36:46.900 --> 36:49.900]  Look, a lot of those strains, like I told you, I got from Amsterdam.
[36:49.900 --> 36:54.900]  And so some of those companies are still in existence and some of those companies that
[36:54.900 --> 36:56.900]  are still in existence still have those strains.
[36:56.900 --> 37:00.900]  But, you know, those things develop over time.
[37:02.900 --> 37:07.900]  Are there, is there any, because right now you're growing basically hydroponically,
[37:07.900 --> 37:08.900]  right?
[37:08.900 --> 37:11.900]  And you've also grown in soil.
[37:12.900 --> 37:18.900]  So can you talk about like same genetics that maybe you've grown both different ways
[37:18.900 --> 37:20.900]  and just some nuanced differences that you've seen?
[37:21.900 --> 37:27.900]  I find that growing in soil, it takes longer for the plants to develop in a vegetative
[37:27.900 --> 37:28.900]  state.
[37:29.900 --> 37:32.900]  I think that the taste and the after product is better.
[37:33.900 --> 37:38.900]  But the bottom line for me is production.
[37:39.900 --> 37:40.900]  And so the time, yeah.
[37:41.900 --> 37:44.900]  So the time involved is always a factor for me.
[37:44.900 --> 37:49.900]  And if it doesn't fit within the timeline, then it's not going to be something that I'm
[37:49.900 --> 37:50.900]  going to consider.
[37:52.900 --> 37:58.900]  So everything is about kind of marginal, this like marginal improvement in taste.
[37:58.900 --> 38:01.900]  Does that lead to marginal per pound?
[38:02.900 --> 38:06.900]  No, I mean, I get good results out of the method that I use.
[38:06.900 --> 38:10.900]  And that's been over trial and error throughout the years.
[38:11.900 --> 38:15.900]  There are a lot of different ways to grow marijuana.
[38:15.900 --> 38:18.900]  I would say hundreds, but maybe that's a stretch.
[38:18.900 --> 38:25.900]  But there are certainly a bunch of different ways to grow marijuana.
[38:26.900 --> 38:28.900]  And the variables then vary.
[38:29.900 --> 38:35.900]  The medium that you grow in, how long you're going to vegetate, the nutrients that you
[38:35.900 --> 38:44.900]  use, the techniques that you use, the light spectrums that you use at different times.
[38:45.900 --> 38:46.900]  All those are factors.
[38:47.900 --> 38:51.900]  Can you touch on light spectrums and kind of your thought process of different stages
[38:51.900 --> 38:52.900]  of growth?
[38:53.900 --> 39:00.900]  The, I guess the plant in a vegetative state likes blue light, which is a metal halide.
[39:00.900 --> 39:04.900]  And then in the flowering stage, likes a red light.
[39:06.900 --> 39:10.900]  The first couple of weeks in flowering, your plant will start to stretch.
[39:12.900 --> 39:16.900]  And under a red light, that stretching can be significant.
[39:16.900 --> 39:23.900]  So in a lot of times, the grower will use a metal halide for the first two weeks of
[39:23.900 --> 39:28.900]  flowering to keep the profile of his garden down and avoid stretching.
[39:30.900 --> 39:33.900]  So that's one technique some people would use.
[39:33.900 --> 39:39.900]  The plant needs the red light to flower.
[39:39.900 --> 39:45.900]  And look, there are some people who use blue light to flower or a combination of the two.
[39:46.900 --> 39:52.900]  I found that I get good results with the genetics that I'm using out of using the blue light
[39:52.900 --> 39:58.900]  in veg and the high pressure sodium red light in the flowering stage.
[39:59.900 --> 40:01.900]  And I account for the stretching.
[40:02.900 --> 40:07.900]  Also, when you're growing different strains, they'll like different things and they'll
[40:07.900 --> 40:10.900]  react differently to conditions.
[40:11.900 --> 40:20.900]  So the other aspect of that is that all strains don't like the same mixture that you're giving.
[40:21.900 --> 40:25.900]  And in your ideal world, you have those, each of those three strains would be in different
[40:25.900 --> 40:26.900]  groups.
[40:26.900 --> 40:31.900]  Ideally, and then I'd be able to tweak their needs.
[40:31.900 --> 40:38.900]  So with those three, can you talk about what each of them, something that each of them
[40:38.900 --> 40:43.900]  would like that's different, but you had to kind of compromise and go kind of down the middle?
[40:44.900 --> 40:49.900]  It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the needs are for the different strains.
[40:50.900 --> 40:55.900]  For instance, the sour diesel doesn't like additives.
[40:56.900 --> 41:00.900]  It likes a very basic soup, if you will, nutrient mix.
[41:02.900 --> 41:08.900]  The formulas that I'm using right now, that strawberry banana loves what I'm giving it,
[41:09.900 --> 41:12.900]  as does the wedding cake.
[41:13.900 --> 41:23.900]  But the gas leak, it could use a little bit different additive list, if you will.
[41:24.900 --> 41:27.900]  Not saying that it would need more, it probably needs less.
[41:27.900 --> 41:28.900]  Less is more.
