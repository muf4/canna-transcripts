with the rest of what I'm going to say here until I've actually set up
the recording device because otherwise I'm going to say it again and y'all
might not enjoy that as much as hearing me say it once.
So we're going to do that right now.
And it looks like Peter's set up. I just got the Jiggimy Jigger
sent over from Future Cannabis Products. I'm going to bring up
Corey as well. We are at the recording point and we're
looking pretty good here.
Awesome. So we are ready to go and set up and we have our moderators
populating the stage. We may have a few more pop in as time goes by. Naturally
life is busy and things do happen so we like to
keep the show moving forward. So we may bring up
some people in the audience to contribute and join the conversation.
Today we have an amazing conversation that I've been
looking forward to the last couple days. I've actually been
on a harvest week this week. I'm on a three-week schedule. Every three weeks I
do a harvest. Leaping my plans going to nine weeks. So I'm very excited to kind
of see what all of our experts have to say
as well as all the little details and methodologies that they use because I
think there's a lot of misconceptions going on.
I think this is an excellently open topic and it's also there's a lot of
personal preference as well. So we're going to have an excellent
group of people here to discuss these facts today
and continue forward as well. So again I'm Lendon Nero, your mediator
or maestro of moderation and a dictator of dialogue and I look
forward to enjoying this conversation with you today on the Dank Hour. As
usual we do about an hour worth of panel time and then we
bring it then we bring up potential guests to talk about the show
and but as usual we start by introducing all of our
fantastic moderators that are on the stage
joining us from their perspective locations which is always very exciting.
I'm just going to do a quick shout out to everybody in the audience.
Matt, Christophe, I'm going to shout out and Jason to you guys
who are regularly here on the show. Kelly, Angel,
everybody out down there. Andrew, Leah, Chris, Peter, Lewis
thank you for joining us today. I have shot you a follow so that you
can make sure to come up and join the following the speaker section next time
you're in the room. And don't forget if you want to click the house and
if you enjoy the conversation what's going on here don't forget to click the
little green house and follow the club and click all of
our moderators up here because they're fantastic people
that are really doing a lot of amazing things in the industry so it's
very important to check them out and make sure to click and join them
as well. So I am going to bring up Sam there too because he's
always a great point of conversation and again my name's London.
I'm going to start and we're just going to go through all of the moderators one
after the other and if you don't mind moderators please when you're done
speaking through these introductions so I'll go at
the end of this. Dr. Anne it's your turn and we'll just kind of go through
that way that way the following moderator speaker will know it's their
turn to go so if you just follow the PTR so it'll be
Dr. Anubis, Josh, Damon, Anita, Peter, Ashley, Corey and Sam in that order.
I would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and
Dr. Anubis take it away. Hi this is Anna Schwalbe and I am a
let's see I'm a biologist, an educator, a cannabis scientist. I teach
modern cannabis science and I am currently in New Jersey growing
cannabis aquaponically. I think with my like 70 year of growing cannabis
you know in my backyard and whatnot but yeah I'm here bringing my
cannabis science expertise to the table and I'm complete.
Hey everybody I'm Josh Virk. I've grown up in the cannabis community in the
legacy community. I have also worked in the legal industry
and research and development for several years.
I did a lot of work working on a molecular breeding project
to identify various traits for future breeding
projects. Yeah currently my focus is more on to
phenohunting and trait tracking and finding cultivars that have medical
benefits for pediatric patients and yeah thanks. I
appreciate the opportunity to be here and Damon up with you buddy.
Hey thanks Josh, thanks Anna, thanks London.
My name is Damon. I am a cannabis inspector for the Zagame Cannabis Board.
I've co-founded a company called Drive Scientific where
we're studying epigenetic signaling within the cannabis plant.
I'm an advisor to CanUmo which is a CBD operation based out of Switzerland,
Lithuania and Valencia, Spain.
Yeah I've been at this for about two decades now
so yeah that's me. Anita you're next. Thanks everyone.
Well hi everyone I'm Anita. Wow I come from a
long line as well. I actually started off as a patient in
in the cannabis world with an injury, a brain injury and
learned about CBD and so on and I started writing about it and letting
other people know about it and kind of amassed a little bit of a
social media following with my website and blogging. That's what we'd
said and then I started
working within the cannabis industry as a sales
in marketing and helped launch this past year
nine cannabis brands in the OCS. I work mainly in Ontario and I'm also
just launched my own business WeedSed Consulting as well
where I'm helping with brand development and
some marketing solutions because marketing in Canada as we all know
it's very challenging and I have this incredible opportunity to leverage what
I have built over the last several years
and so I'm doing that to try to move the
industry forward and you know de-stigmatize and all that
so and that's where I'm in this so and now Peter take it away
Peter future cannabis project I am cooking dinner for the family right now
so I'm just going to listen
Go ahead Ashley you're next nice mic drop there Peter we appreciate you
Hey guys my name is Ashley Hubbard I am the director
of cultivation for a fully aeroponic facility
here in Michigan I've been in the industry
professionally since 2007 or I'm sorry wow
2014 started as a trimmer and then worked my way up to director
I obtained my master's degree with Anna same lab looking at plant
population genetics and have a lot of fun doing what I love
I'm just there sorry there buddy I had to do a couple clicks to get on mute in
London apologies brother my name is Corey I'm a principal
managing partner at Resonate Cannabis Incorporated up here in Canada
we're a large-scale cultivation service we also cover quality assurance
with a lovely little cohort down below me there Sam
shout out to Sam but yeah we're stationed all over the world
Canada United States Portugal and yeah just trying to help get better
medicine or you know at least what we could call
medicine out to the different patients around the world the pleasure to be here
Sam you're up next hello that's me um
uh yeah I'm Sam I have been in the industry uh not as long as almost
anybody here I've I've been in since it was legalized
here in Canada in 2018 um yeah I I am in quality I'm currently a
quality assurance manager at a facility out here at Vancouver Island
and yeah that's me oh I work with Corey uh at Resonate that's pretty cool yeah
that's me
awesome and as usual I'm London here to guide the conversation and move it along
and we have an awesome conversation for you today
when to harvest your cannabis and we have a diverse group of experts here
to talk about just these specific subjects
just before I get rolling here RJ are you available I know you usually
may be tracking home right now would you be available to introduce yourself at
this point in time or should we come back
yep can you hear me 100 loud and clear there
awesome hey everybody I'm RJ Ellis I'm an extraction and process specialist for
Canada's leading third-party extraction company
um love this topic today because in extractions
we deal with all kinds of material harvested at all kinds of different
times and some material that's been handled
better than others so love it and uh thankful to be here
awesome and again I'm London and I look forward to having this conversation with
you don't be afraid to check out my website
youcannagrow.thinkific.com
there you can sign up for my newsletter and get invites to all of our live shows
and anything else going on in the community that we
are aware of we I love linking up people and I think it's all about working as a
community and working together to grow and develop together so if you
have something going on and you're interested in sharing it don't hesitate
to reach out as well because I love working with the community and
continuing forward but let's get on with today's
conversation and I mean I'm I'm gonna I'm excited for it for sure and I'm
gonna throw Josh right into the fire if he's available
for it because I the way we spoke on our first meeting I
wanted to just ask him the straightforward question how do you
know when to harvest your plant?
Well thanks for uh throwing me in the fire there's but the
light of a button here um so uh harvesting plants uh
I know one of the main things a lot of people like to do is
use trichome color as an indicator of uh ripeness which
uh that really isn't but um it can be used um if used correctly so if you if
you you if you've grown a strain out several
times and you've assessed the trichome color when you harvest
um you know and you like that effect then you know you can
you know use that but um a lot of the time uh the you know the peak THC or the
peak of the terpenes is not going to
necessarily be when you know everything's going cloudy and
you have just a couple ambers there um but um yeah I mean personally I
you know if I have something that's stated as you know an eight week strain
um I'll normally grow everything out and replicate
and um you just kind of you know do some destructive sampling on the
the final weeks you know week eight week nine week ten or
even though week seven if you if bud looks like it's ready
uh generally the bud will get a lot denser near the end
the hairs will all kind of go red and you generally won't see much white
hair is popping back up again and you know once that kind of density has
kind of been achieved there you can kind of see that the bud is ready
just by looking at it um but again that you know kind of takes
you know a bit of experience having done it for you know
quite a few years now it you know looking at it just you know the bud can
tell me but uh using the trichome color is
definitely you know a helpful guide for people but I
just wouldn't use it as you know the the solid indicator that
you know this is going to be you know more uplifting or more couch
locky um the longer you go you just have a
different you know change in the you know cannabinoid
profile um but yeah I mean if you want something
technically with more THC taking it a few days earlier normally will give you
a slightly higher amount when you have less biomass because
as you go past that right point the plant will continue to accumulate
biomass but it won't really accumulate any THC so
your overall THC level will end up going down like a percentage but the
actual total THC will remain the same but yeah
that's uh what I do that's a really interesting
perspective and and I I like that as a point to
really highlight is is that the that you've seen and and run
through examples where you've taken a plant and and brought it
to um you know eight weeks and then brought
it to nine weeks and received kind of the same volume of THC
cannabinoids terpenes out of the same plant
but an increased biomass so your THC levels went down and that's
uh yeah that's exactly it so let's say for example
if you've grown a plant out you know time and again
you're gonna have a pretty good idea if you veg it for you know three weeks and
you know your two gallon pot that you use you're gonna end up with
you know 150 grams for example um if you then take that and you you know
multiply it by your percentage and you know let's say
it's uh 20 you've got your you know 20
some odd grams of THC and if you then push that strain you know an extra week
or two you can you know get that biomass you know
the bud yield up to say 180 grams instead of
150 the the THC the total THC in that plant
won't have changed which will inevitably bring down your actual THC
percentage on your CON.
Interesting interesting in a world where the numbers matter in Canada and a
lot of a lot of the areas as education continues to develop it's
it's always about a lot of what people go into the stores about having the
highest THC and terpene content or highest THC or CBD content so
that's pretty important for a lot of growers to to know that and understand
that now when we're talking about THC and CBD one of the things that has been
commonly said and and voiced and that I hear left right
back and forth on message boards and this that and the other is that as the
plant grows and develops it starts with THCA
and that THCA turns into CBD and CBN. I was wondering if Dr. Anubis
maybe you could break down a little bit of like is this how it does does the THC
turn into CBD the longer you leave it in the plant is that why you get more of
this so this you know general consensus or
is this a little bit of a old wives tale that's not exactly how it works
that plants generate their own thing what's your thoughts or what what is
so my thoughts are that you know we start with
CBGA which is the precursor to all the cannabinoids
we have enzymes that then convert that CBGA
to THCA a different enzyme that converts to CBD
A and a different enzyme that converts to CBCA
that's the biological mechanism in the plant
beyond that there's no biological mechanism
that converts THCA to THC delta 9 or any other of deltas
the way that happens is through oxidation or heat or something like
that just doing the doing the decarboxylation
conversion same thing with CBDA it doesn't just
transform into THC just like THC doesn't just
THCA does not just transform into CBDA in the plant
it can you can you're gonna naturally have like a little bit of
in a high THC plant you're naturally going to have a little bit of CBD
and vice versa in a high CBD plant you're naturally going to have a little
bit of THC but you it's not you're not
not going to convert those things in the plant as it's growing
if you if you're letting it mature longer it's not going to convert that
THCA into CBDA or the small amount of
THC that's converted in in the plant it's not going to then convert into CBD
like you actually have to push it harder than that and do
you know have it really be in some adverse conditions like hot weather or
in some crazy storage or something like that
so no I don't I and I and I
believe Jocelyn would agree with me that no if you are
uh letting your plant mature on on the on the plant and pushing it beyond
maturity it's not converting THC to CBD that's
um that is a a tale a tale that doesn't actually um have
anything behind it awesome I mean you couldn't have answered
that any better I mean talk about again and I think that's
really important to understand there's been some misconceptions over time
and and though plants might you know put out
CBD at different points in time during their development it doesn't mean that
a plant is going to like turn anything into another I wanted to jump
down to Ashley now Ashley I had the fortunate
chance last week to have a little bit of a
video tour of Ashley's facility and I will tell you this
it is the most amazing thing I've ever seen she is the Willy Wonka of cannabis
no um which is probably the most
technically advanced aeroponic facility and largest
that I've had the fortunate chance to see the inside of and I mean it is just
absolutely beautiful now with the time frames and harvesting and the growth of
aeroponics I thought it would be I'm really really quite interested to
hear how your system forms and how you kind of make these dictations because
your growth I mean aeroponics growth vegetative
growth this is of course a lot faster in development so I wanted to learn
and see if there's a little bit of a change or if you've had to make some
adaptions in this style of growing versus maybe a
more traditional media um or you know just your general breakdown
of how you decide to harvest your plants um yeah well thank you very much
for that London um it's been a definitely a learning curve
moving into aeroponics it was not what I was used to cultivating
back in Colorado so got this opportunity with this company to kind of build it
from the ground up and it's definitely um it's definitely I mean it's rewarding
with great risks there's great reward right but um we're fortunate enough
to with the aeroponics cut off a substantial amount of veg time because
they grow so robustly but you know with us quite honestly we have to make our
harvest schedule fit our room cycles and so by doing that
you know there's been a handful of strains that I've had to eliminate just
because I know that they're not going to be ready
um in the time frame that I have to have them so we've selected
our strains to try to make sure that they're always
at a developmental mature stage when we harvest them but we do go off of
the notion of like Josh was saying um you know the pistol colors but we
recently have been I've actually on the weekends
every room that's getting ready to come down checked the color of the trichomes
with a really cool it's called a dynalite you can plug it
into a usb port on your computer and magnify just to
I don't know what the x value is but it's pretty remarkable to really get a
good now you can do the same thing with a
jewel basic jewelers loop they're maybe less than five dollars so
we like I said go off of what we know we've got to fit
which is you know so many so many pounds per year and
our full cycle in the rooms including veg
is uh 63 days so we get a week of veg time and then kick them into flower
but yeah we uh we definitely go off of what we know works and has time to
finish in and we've been pretty successful in
keeping consistent THC results and can uh
well actually total cannabinoids and then terpene values as well
so we we I would love to we're actually running an experiment right now with a
a couple of our strains that we hypothesize need a little bit more
flower time so we kind of made a unique tweak to the
schedule for this batch to see if we can do a side by side
and see if that extra week impacts our uh
impacts our end product so yeah
awesome awesome answer and I really loved
the fact that you actually kind of almost go the opposite direction you
start at the start of the plant right you're
you're you're starting at the pheno hunt and using that as the dictation of
which plants and that you're going to use as specific genetic strains
um and and using that as your kind of guiding light because
I mean there's all sorts of other amazing stuff but when you're running a
commercial facility like yourself it's about
you still have numbers that you need to hit on a regular basis
so starting with a plant that you know is going to finish it at appropriate
time and using that in a light schedule I think it's super
awesome and interesting it's very kind of opposite way that a lot of people
approach something when in pheno hunting it's about finding
the best flower and usually that's put into it and I think
having a relevance on the system that you're using for example like for myself
I do medical growing at home and you know I take care of the family
so there needs to be a certain amount of input and output every single three
weeks when they come in and out so it but at the same time if I time it
correctly and have a certain route a certain you know amount amount of
plants go in at a certain amount of time I can give them that extra bit a week so
I can actually have this routine and set going so knowing
kind of your plants and where they're going to
but also repeat runs is a lot of what I'm hearing especially from Josh and
Ashley is like you know what the the trichomes are a great judgment because
they give you a point in time and give you a repeatable trackable image
to repeat but it doesn't mean that this color and this tone and this cloudiness
is going to be when you want to harvest it means
that this is where they were at with flavor THC
at this point in time during this point of
of development each plant is individual in its own way so I wanted to jump up
a spot to Damon and ask him I mean other than in Canada which when you're
doing outdoor you just hold on for dear freaking life
and hope you could get that plant out as long as possible without it rotting to
death but I've been a little bit extreme but
apart from outdoor growing how do you Damon decide when to harvest
your cannabis is there any special tricks?
Yeah when it's ready like and sorry to like leave it at like
such a broad thing but when I first started growing the big
mistake that I was making is I was cutting way too early
the second that a leaf would turn yellow that was it you know I was like I'd go
into panic mode and I'd start you know flushing it and
then take it down the longer that I've been doing this the
more that I've realized you know that plant
will give you not just the color of the trichome heads but there's other
indicators that you know are physical or physiological that you just look for
and then you know like density of the bud
you know is it starting to lose its green and yellow off
right things like that so the most common thing that I see even now with
legalization and the four plant growers is they're
cutting too early right they're not writing things down
because it's going to take you know a minimum of seven to eight weeks
but you know genetic wise the indoor there's some stuff that can go 14 weeks
right and they bought it as an indica dominant
thinking that it's an eight week strain but if you let that plant go to 14 weeks
you're going to get more THC and you're going to get a lot more weed
so that's just that's just because I really
when I first started growing you know I didn't have a loop didn't have a digital
camera or anything like that and I just there was one day where a buddy
said he's like you're cutting too early leave your plant up when you think it's
ready leave it up for another three weeks and
you'll be surprised to see what happens right
so that's kind of and then you know you end up getting those nice flares the
purples come out you know your carotene and things like
that so it's the longer you leave a plant up
in my opinion the better right there are genetic
stability issues that you have to watch out for
right like anthers or something like that and like London you shared on
Instagram today that you know it's your third run on a plant
and you have to cut it down at a certain day
because that next day you've got bananas and next thing you know you've got a
herndell crop so enjoy your pounds or pounds however
much you get London. Thank you David yeah so I
I noticed that so I've had this OG18 and if you PTR in the audience I have
actually this is a great opportunity for this David this really let it through
well so I actually have a picture for y'all
so on the we all I have three very different
plants from three very different breeders that breed
for very very different reasons and they're
they're very cool very interesting so on the top you have OG18
and these are very bulbous shaped bracts and I find that their development like
this plant 55 days you go any longer and you have bananas
and you've you've pollinated your whole tent but it
is a stellar crystally beautiful plant that is
very resistant to mold and other issues now due to the fact that it drops these
these bananas it means that I need to cut that plant down just before that
point in time now I've concluded that for
continuing on with this specific genetic even with the advantages
of everything it's better to get rid of it and call it out of the herb
but I gave it three rounds and and I really gave it some time and a few
chances to succeed and I think it's really important for people to do that
because you don't know a how long it's going to take the first time I took this
plant I took it to 10 weeks and it was and like
like I said I got a lot of seeds and a lot of bananas and I brought it
down shorter and I found that you know this is a mark and point in time
let's give it a third run see what the development is like and I got a great
harvest you know I did eight plants that were veged out for six weeks and
they went nine weeks in the tent and I got you know a pound total out of
those eight plants and it was a pretty good run I'm pretty happy with this it's
a small home grow I'm talking like I got like maybe 650
watts worth of led lights growing in my 4x8 tent like I don't have a
huge setup I don't have anything to hide but it's it's
it's about having that routine and knowing the genetics and when to harvest
so this way I could pull eight and eight out on a regular basis now Corey
I really am excited about this one because we have a lot of this same kind
of active plants and things that we look at when we're looking for a strain
or or a genetic so I really wanted to hear kind of what's your
precursors when do you start making those judgment calls to harvest is there
a cue point in the plant or a signal that you see
that says hey maybe we're getting close to that point
in time or you go or is there like hey you know this happens and I give it two
weeks after that the first time I run this plant every single time and then
I'll back away from there what's your kind of
best practices for a first time run? Oh no I appreciate that London I think
you know a lot of really good things have been said so far
I think that you know it's definitely kind of watching it all come together
I think the one thing really though from like a data perspective if you're doing
your first run so you're not kind of you know going
off of experience in that sort of way is I really like to watch runoff numbers
and so when I'm doing you know runoff tests and kind of seeing
you know where how is my plant feeding how is it eating
and there's kind of a certain point where it just stops
and it kind of tapers off a little bit of where the feeding schedule is
that's where I really start to pay attention to where
you know that's good you said it really well actually is where there's that one
certain point where you kind of set a time frame up
and go from there and there's usually about you know again a little bit
rough here I hate to you know not be so specific
but somewhere in the neighborhood of about 21 to 28 days is when I'm going to
chop it for when it starts to taper off its
food ability and so I know again that might change you know with your
different cultivars but as far as doing one run
I think it's safe to kind of you know look at your runoff numbers
see when that plant starts feeding and then really kind of you know
I think it helps build a nutrition program that is cultivar specific
and enables you to kind of do it a little bit easier for your runs after
that so that's the one thing that I think hasn't
been mentioned that I really like to do especially at large scale you know when
we're trying to get a consistent number and things you know need to happen a
little bit seamlessly to say the least I kind of like to watch
my irrigation numbers and yeah kind of play off where that runoff
has happened when the plant stops feeding.
I would love to jump over and Damon did you want to respond to that
you're gonna hop in. Yeah, runoff numbers are absolutely a
great place to start as new grower and this might sound a little bit
twisted to a lot of people but I know guys that the way that they do
their stuff and they're dinosaurs before pens were even invented
and they told me they're like you know you know
you're good on your flush because if you had to drink your runoff
you would right so it's kind of more of a smart ass comment
or a joke but Cory's absolutely right like a new grower go out
spend the you know you can get cheap pens off Amazon
pick those up and just you know make sure that
everything is out of that plant out of that soil and it's chelated and flushed
properly. So I want to jump in and say one thing
is I've noticed something really interesting and I love
the point that you've brought up here Cory because it is
really something I've noticed before and I've wondered this to a C
because what I see is usually about two
about three weeks before the plants are ready to harvest
is their actual water consumption drops so
they'll go to like every other day and sometimes
even at their peak production even at their peak growth I find that they'll
get to like you know every day they could even take a
watering I'm using larger pots so there's less frequency for that
but I've wondered if that was kind of the signal it's like okay we're tapering
off like I noticed this at the end on a repetitive basis so I'm really happy
to hear that that somebody else is seeing this and Ashley you have
one of the questions that's actually graphed that stuff out
so do you notice on a regular basis the last little while of your plant
do you know it notice a diminishment in the consumption that they have because I
mean you have you have running data at all points in
time on your plant consumption and on exactly what they're taking in
and how much do you find that there's a point in time
that that starts to happen yeah absolutely it's a really interesting
trend and just so to explain a little bit
about how our system works so we've got built-in sensors that take
a data reading every five seconds so there's about a hundred plants that
share one reservoir so we can see
one row's data and it's always it triggers you'll start to see EC
rise usually week week five especially week six of flower
you'll see actually so previous to that you'll see them actively eating
because you'll see the EC decrease with each irrigation cycle
and then middle of flower the EC actually with each irrigation cycle
starts to increase so we try to implement multiple flushes
because we've found that you can
the plants will uptake certain ratios or certain
ingredients in that recipe more than others
so we give them a good flush before when we see that but yeah middle of flower
you'll start to see that EC graph increase versus decrease every every
round i've never been so nerded out by seeing
graphs before ashley i mean like i've seen some of those
some of those detailed graphs but it's very interesting to see and like i mean
just another point here that we're seeing in a regular ways in the
industry is that we're hitting about the midway point
and that or closer tail end midway tail end of the mid
part of flower and we see this kind of go and one thing that i've always
i've always those things like how far can you push it i've noticed that a lot
of plants some will almost once they get too far
in the flower they almost go back into a vegetative they'll like
throw throwing single leaves out and get like a single leaf stress vegetative
almost thing i've seen some plants that just keep
putting out calyx and they just end up rotten because they just get so thick
and i've seen you know plants that drop bananas in in the process
now i was always kind of wondering about this now
when you're doing extracting and you have plants that have
you know pollen sacks that have burst in them because pollen spawn
like i mean it is small small small small
and pollen sacks and then you have seeds that have a certain amount of oil in
them and stuff like that when you're extracting from these plants
are j i'm coming over to you when you're extracting from these plants
and these oils and lipids are there maybe potentially even broken up
into the plant material due to the fact that you know there's
been some movement some crushing your packaging large stuff i mean like
you're saying there's been all manner of of levels of greedy how does that stuff
come out um and and and then uh if
and then i have a follow-up question for you after that so like i
specifically like the the fats and lipids from the seeds and then also kind
of what do you do about the that's a really good question um
by and large i would say that certain material is going to be
selected for certain extraction methods to mitigate stuff like that
um i mean unless you just run one type of extraction equipment
then you kind of just have to deal with it yourself um
so in terms of some of the larger companies that have several extraction
methods i would say that material would be
you know selected more so for like a bulk extraction like
co2 or ethanol where there's going to be substantial post-production
so it's not really going to affect anything because it's going to be taken
out in standard remediation
versus something like i don't know hydrocarbon or solventless
i mean you might have to deal with that a bit more i think for
something like hydrocarbon you can use like selective filtration with regards
to mesh mesh size like particle size so you
could filter out the actual pollen particulate or seed
matter that biomass can just be separated from the resin
fairly easily so when it comes down when it comes to extraction we're not
really going to have the same problems that uh that the growers are you know
what i mean it's it's easily it's easy to separate it
and easy to deal with it um kind of depending on the method
because i was thinking about that today like if you take a like because there's
a lot of people that are like just smashing nugs nowadays i mean it's a
popular pastime smashing it's a good time and and you know some of these
people are at home smashing nugs that potentially have
seeds in them and when i'm smashing a seed with heat like that
that's going to excrete oils it's like literally how you make
like hemp seed oil and stuff like that so i imagine like as a rosin press it
would be you need to remove all of that matter and bubble sift it and stuff like
that so as a follow-up question what is kind of are there like if you
had the perfect flower for extracting what would that look like to you and can
could you describe down to like maybe as much as you can in
detail on what the result of that product would be i mean like
do you have you seen the perfect product for you have you seen a plant this
perfectly or jim could you go in it in in my in my career
absolutely uh in the legal space not really in the legal space we just
kind of get what we get especially being in canada
so i've seen some really really nice flower um
stuff that would otherwise be sold on the shelf
and we've gotten that by certain customers to extract and it's come out
phenomenally well um my personal kind of feeling on the
optimal material i'd prefer like a
like a fresh a recently freshly dried material
not quite a fresh frozen but you know just
before stems start to snap and then i would freeze that
um reasons why to mitigate a bunch of the water content i know i'm
gonna lose some of the monos but i mean
grand scheme of things it's going to present
a better base of extraction uh with that material because i'm gonna have less
issues to deal with on the front end and then less things to
mitigate like in situ um and it's still gonna allow me
the majority of what i want on the back end i can still manipulate the resin the
way that i want to i'm still gonna have a super high terpene content
it's still gonna be fresh it's just not fresh frozen it's also not cured
right it's not fully dry so it's kind of right in
that middle that's that's my personal optimal material that that actually
blew my mind a little bit because i mean for me
it's it's always about that cured final process material and
we're talking and and the more i go and the more we do these shows
the more and more i realize and continue to realize that there are so many
different aspects and ways to look at that and that just because this
methodology has been used so long we need to reevaluate
and think about some of these things because when we're talking about
extraction in this way like i would have thought that
like the best flower you've ever extracted would be
or your ideal form would be like this nice finished cured product
um and and not really that direction and so it was very interesting to kind of
hear that you would prefer that that you've had a lot of good
results it really comes down to the resin
right like what do we want from the resin
i'm not saying the dry cured terpene profile and
and that expression of the plant is bad or wrong like it's great
right a lot of the time a perfectly cured material can make
incredible resin but also we're missing a lot of the monoterpenes and a lot of
the more volatile organic chemicals that we want to
trap and we want to retain that's why there's been such a push
for fresh frozen it's to to get that more nuanced subtle profile that we can
get from the dry cured material so that's why i personally like the
goldilocks zone right in between where i'm still able to
get some of those monos and retain that terpene value but still
have a reduced uh water content because i've
actually taken time to remove that from the material itself
awesome i mean the fresh frozen seems to be something that's more and more common
and popular and there's always this like debate on like well how do we get fresh
frozen out in the field using liquid nitrogen and stuff like that
and i've always found these things has been an interesting debate because
agriculture has been doing this for quite a long time actually they've been
harvesting peas frozen in liquid nitrogen in the field for a while so
i think it'll be interesting to see how we adapt some of those agricultural
techniques to harvesting outdoor cannabis in the
agreed it's just it's just recycled science right we're just taking pages
out of the book of other industries that's all we're doing
with regards to the chemistry with regards to
extraction with regards to you know growing to some extent
i mean we're always going to have the little things about cannabis that make
our method our methodology completely unique
but i mean we're just stealing science and just transferring that knowledge by
and large anyways well we're going to open up the floor
in about 50 minutes for people to come up and say hi and speak and ask some
questions as it heads up this is a recorded show
and it does get put onto youtube so when we get to that point in 50
minutes we will do that up so if you would like to i'm going to invite the
people that have requested to come up to speak to raise their hand again
and i will invite you up on stage and in about 15 minutes once we finish off our
panel discussion we will have your questions answered so i
want to just get to our last couple of our panelists here
and ask them the big fat hairy question of the day so sam
you know what is the cue point for your harvest is there
some sort of you know adjacent point that you that really goes to you to
harvest are you doing out first question just real real quick are
you doing any outdoor on the island because you're on
vancouver island right yes and yes respectively
um i'm not a grower i follow the sops which are usually written
in conjunction with the growers so i i don't have anything fancy i just
harvest it when the plant when the standard operating
procedures tell me to harvest it and even then i'm
not actually harvesting it i just make sure that the paperwork is good
so yeah it's um i fucking i really fucking love that answer
because it's it's true like these practices and steps in canadian market
are parts of the procedures and knowing when
to harvest guess what in a legal in the legal canadian
market is also part of an sop procedure that needs to be followed now
depending on you know what your location is i mean
we're talking to sam here and he's growing
if there's outdoor cannabis on vancouver island this is no easy feat
and it's very challenging with the amount of mold and pests and problems
that you can run into so i'm sure he's got
a mile high of paperwork of problems and potential issues
that they need to keep in question of concern now anita
you're coming up to your outdoor harvest and do a fair bit of other harvesting
as well now damon did you want to touch on something before i pop up
yeah actually i just wanted to ask sam with
uh the precision agriculture that he's doing
how easy is it to get the same repeatable results like
we're three years in now where the markets opened up
are is he seeing his qa that his garden is coming out the same way
every time because he's following that precision agriculture
um good question outdoors no uh there's too many independent variables
uh every single so the last three summers have been radically different
out here on the island not that i've been
at one company for three years but nonetheless
it's for to use this place as an example um
or even just this place as a growing for as an example
uh you have three different events you have
the heat wave uh last year it was extremely
i think it was last year it was very wet and the year before that we had a very
it was very very late uh spring and summer
if i remember correctly it might been got those two mixed up regardless it's
just you have the weather events in and of themselves
or can be so radically different that you will never be able to grow
similar stuff you need to have a almost tropical
climate but one not subject to hurricanes because that is also there
regardless on the indoors there's much more
standard uh not not standard but there's much more
uh repeatability but even then um depending on the strain depending
uh both the the physical genotype and the actual strain that the
plant is producing from pests or pathogens or
people accidentally walking into the rooms
when it's uh supposed to be on its night cycle and giving it day because that
happens all the time it you really end up with you can
make that margin closer but in the end these are growing plants you're never
going to have it be like a
you're going to get it exactly the same there's always going to be wiggle room
and i think that people who come into this who expect
that we are going to have this strain and we're going to do the exact same
thing every time and it's going to hit this exactly every time i don't
think that they are realistically going to have their expectations met
i i just want to jump in here and just just throw this out there because manny
is not here but just so everybody is aware cannabis
is not a fucking widget guys you cannot just
make shit and throw stuff at it and get some numbers out it's
it's so much more complex and in-depth so that you need to have a passion for
the plant and stewardship to the plant to
really care for it it's not like a corporate fucking widget
where you can just throw a bunch of crap at it and call it a is it does that help
rj do you want
uh i would say it depends on the state of the cannabis i would i know manny's
gonna love that but uh i would say it depends on the
state like raw flower yeah i agree dry like
flower in the sense of like actual flower itself
absolutely the second you start doing extractions
refinements and changing it then it starts to turn into a widget
personal personal opinion
i am so gonna put that on as a little cut out quote for like a post on on
instagram and it's gonna be manny getting mad about it being a widget and
then your quick response afterwards so just so you know it's going to happen
i'm sorry but it's going to be there i'll give you i'll give you more sound
bites too like it's oh hell yeah but it's really what it comes down to is
like look at all the products that we can make
with extracts
like sky's the limit anything you could conceive of we can essentially make or
infuse so like that doesn't happen with raw
flower that happens with the extractions and the refinements so
absolutely cannabis raw flower itself not a widget but the second we start
manipulating it and doing more things to it it starts to
change the optics on everything again my personal opinion i actually
think i think many would agree with that i i think i think we would all more or
less agree with it in in some way shape or form i wanted to jump down to anita
how are you doing today now i wanted to ask
a lot of the flower in the market that is coming out is usually an eight week
strain that's in the canadian market like what do you
a what are you doing in canada in in ontario how are you doing there because
it's been a rough season to harvest and is there a few points that you really
jump to or have heard as a new grower or or as with your heard from some of
the new growers that follow you um that come up like what's your
dictation point is there something that gets in there and also how
uh thanks for asking um it it's it's good um it's stressful this is like the
most stressful time like besides the weather like last summer
and was different than the summer before and it's been such an interesting
conversation listening to everybody because i've had
a few like oh like aha moments of like oh okay that that totally
i can relate to that because like i've grown the same strain
three summers uh outside and then inside as well and each time it's been
different and like i would say is it the seeds of
course it's a little bit of the seed but some of the differences have been like
quite drastic like where um two summers ago it was very wet
i got a lot of botrytis i didn't know how to identify it was my first outdoor
grow so i let it go way longer um like to the point where i
waited until it was brown and gross and then went what's this
um because as a new girl you don't know right i'm like i thought it was damaged
but um last summer um it was drier and we had a
really like warm long fall and my my cbd plant that's
what i've grown several years now um is
was massive i have pictures of it on my instagram it's huge it's like way bigger
than me it looks like a big throne of like just shooting out buds it was
great but this year same plant is so it's like
half the size um and it's just been so freaking wet
um so like it's been it's been kind of interesting watching the personality
change with the weather and stuff it's so fascinating i love it
um but my other plants yeah now that i know what to look for
i've noticed yeah we've been i've been getting some pm and
bud rot and stuff so um and i don't have time to cut anything
down yet but i've um like you know cut down branches a
lot of people are asking me like how do i it does this look
sneaky and or like when should i what do i look for and i'm like look for like
the first sign for me to look for like if if you're not sure when to harvest
first look for any rot like if you have any rot
any like leaves that are looking like wilty
like look behind behind it near the branch if you see brown cut it down
like it is just better to have a little bit of loss and to cut early than to
like lose an entire crop or half of it because of bud rot and that's what
happened to me that the first year and so
you know a lot of people are kind of um asking when to um right now and i
think that this is why this is such a great topic to talk
about today um because a lot of people don't know
um outdoor especially uh but you know they're getting into the
indoor right now as well as as we're getting into the cooler weather too
everybody's bringing in their plants inside so
um but yeah that's the garden's good i think she's all coming down except for
my cbd plant because actually she's the only one that actually has like a
i think it's like 11 like weeks like she did what
last couple of years she's not done until the end of october
so one's gonna be staying and then three are coming down though this weekend so
and it's not because they're trichomes or anything it's just because rot
i i don't want to lose any more to it so yeah
i think i think that's also a great answer is there's
points in time when you have to make a decision and and whether or not to lose
your plant or to harvest it especially for new growers
especially for people in temperate climates like ourselves go ahead
i was just gonna say or i mean this isn't
necessarily possible or maybe it is for large cultivation but for those
people all these people in the audience and there are a lot of them this week
um if you're doing a home grow if you're not sure when to harvest it's okay
to take a branch you know or what you think might be a little early and
then take a branch a couple weeks later and then take
another you know and then and then cut down the whole plant
and cure it as you would it of course you need to label everything
well so that you know what's what um but do an experiment see which one
and take some notes and see which one what the trichomes look like blah blah
see which one you like for that particular strain and and strains are
going to change they're going to be different um
you know as we've said and there's a bunch of nuances
uh in all these different cannabis varietals and stuff
so it's okay to not chop the whole plant down but just take a branch and be like
okay well these ones are you know what i think are maybe a little
early but i'm not sure and then you can kind of do a little
experiment at home and figure out what it is
what what your harvest time is um is ideal for you i just you know
it's okay what a great point that is because yes guess what you can
harvest plants at multiple points in time and they will not like
detriment as long as you don't like cut off a huge portion i think it's like
90 or 90 of the plant but it'll come back and you can allow the plant to
develop further and try it which is really good i think
as we spoke about in a previous episode uh that i believe
just dropped onto my youtube with the edited version and the next audio
is uh rj mentioned when it comes to extracting
and because a lot of the times when you have to harvest these plants early and
like we need you said and like i mentioned before especially in canada
sometimes it's a battle of of the botrytis it's you gotta fight that but
in in and like i said even when it comes to
it uh extraction if you have botrytis and it
is affected your plant that product isn't good for extraction
and it does it which just means you're not going to be able to dry sift it
you're not gonna be able to extract out of it
so it's better to cut that plant down and lose the rest of it because that
stuff goes crazy fast through a space it's nuts
so i think it's better to harvest in general and in a lot of those
points now we're getting close to the top of the hour here and we have had an
awesome show so again i'm going to open up the stage to come
up and say hello and maybe ask some questions this is a recorded story
show as you can see with a dot record on the top left there
so come on up and ask some questions i would love to jump
over and kind of ask like i did have someone asking is it using nitrogen or
way to lower the temps to decrease the volatility is that a
good way of helping with the extraction method to kind of
keep your plants in a better way to go like using liquid nitrogen
in terms of like sorry i missed the question like at point of harvest
yeah i believe at point of harvest yeah yeah like yeah liquid nitrogen would be
good liquid co2 would be good anything that you can get it that cold
that fast especially in a way that can help maybe drive out a bit of moisture
yeah absolutely great way to uh to store fresh frozen and a great way to
harvest absolutely and even better if you can store it you
know below negative 40.
So again we're going to take a dive here and see if you'd like to come up
Damon i'm going to invite you up as you have a very meager like kind of
blank profile so i do advise you to fill that out a little bit more so we get to
know you but you're uh up in front of our panel
of experts do you have a question? um yes um new
at all at this but i was interested in the business aspect i think i said that
one time before in one of the rooms and um i guess what what what i wanted
to know is like if you wanted to do something indoors
um what would be the best way to kind of like start something like that
and would you recommend like i guess like good seeding companies or
anything like that or like how do you go about
like doing that and do you have trial and error phases like
so should i expect a certain amount of loss in the beginning or
like how did how does that work? So a couple things
uh just as it has that's a huge question and we're going to stay
on topic because we're talking we brought this panel of experts in from
all over Canada and the U.S. to come and talk specifically about when to harvest
so if you don't have a direct question about that we're going to
continue the conversation forward but i will throw this
out there as a point of reference too if
yeah no it's okay i do have a point of reference too is if you click me
um and shoot me a message in the back chat i could send you towards a couple
great uh great methods and things like that and
and do expect that like anything you start like any hobby
or like any passion or anything that you want to do
well and take a lot of care in there's going to be trial and error
and to have that as part of your expectation plan
with whatever you do in life a failure is never a failure it is
only a potential to create more success later on
so yeah definitely mitigate that shoot me a message in the back channel and see
which i can help you out did you have any direct questions about kind of when
to harvest your can
uh i was i was in i guess what you call that i was showing you a message i'm
sorry no i don't i'm gonna just sit back and
listen i'm gonna just learn um and if i have a question i will send
it to you or send it to one of you guys um that's a moderator and uh i'll just
listen but again i apologize i didn't i didn't
actually uh realize uh that you guys are like kind
of staying on topic so i apologize about that
no worries it's all good again this is the dank hour here every tuesday come
check it out so i'm going to just move you down to the audience if you have any
direct questions don't hesitate to raise your hand
again and come up and say hello to the group so i think
in summary when we're talking about harvesting
um and bringing plants and making the judgment call on when to harvest
your plants at home whether it is at home in uh in a home growing
environment or in a professional skill a don't worry about it take the
pressure off if you want you you want to try out you think it's ready to go cut
off a little bit let it dry and try it out right you can't
you can't unkill the plant you know what i mean like you can't like
you if you if you chop down the whole plant you can't plant it back and have
it grow again so it's okay to chop a little bit off like dr annabeth said dry
it cure it and try it out and see if that's where it's ready to go
take a little bit more time and try it again the next time if you're in a
commercial scale depending on what you're doing
you'll want to really follow suit with what's going to meet your needs and
environments it might take a little bit more time and effort with phenol hunting
to find a genetic that's going to perfectly suit your environment and
speed and rate of harvest so i just wanted to i mean many questions hopped
on stage it's been a while it's always wonderful to see you how is your outdoor
garden going would you have a moment to say hello
hey everyone yeah just jumping in here and
yeah thanks for asking the outdoor harvest is well underway
we had four guys over here today we're we're
we have to do it off in about five different sections just based on
the dry room size that we have the top floor of a barn
we've got five four air conditioners going and a big dehumidifier pulling
240 pints a day that we rented just to keep up but no
everything's good happy to see everyone hope everyone's well
just jumping in here awesome well mediakitch while i have you on this stage
and i i'd love to ask you to because i mean you grow in a quite a a challenging
environment but you you do have a great spot as as as we all hear today's
subject has been when to harvest your cannabis so may i
ask you when do you decide to harvest your
plants is there a specific sign that gives you the general point of reference
that makes you want to move towards harvest
yeah i mean i take every every plant in every
every situation and every year basically differently
so i don't have nothing is set in stone especially you know i'm on the east
coast of canada we're in the annapolis valley we're in
our hurricane season right now so i mean if we see big you know hurricane
or tropical storms heading our way you know we have to act quickly basically
so i mean we're at the mother of we're at the mercy of mother nature
but in terms of if you know if you have the time i always
always tell people to try and let that plant go an extra week or often it's two
weeks i see most people i see online in my
opinion are harvesting plants too early however with that being said you've got
to factor in those weather conditions thieves
um you know moisture rain buttritis is a big one powdery mildew this time of
year becomes a big problem um so in essence the answer to your
question is you know it's a day by day type thing
and there's nothing set in stone and and everyone's situation sort of changes
you know by the hour basically i love that because i've never even thought
of that in bc like i mean we're always fighting but right that's
we're always gonna fight powder mildew and buttritis always a war
but i didn't even think about like holy shit there's a tropical storm coming
guys like it's gonna take out like we got a harvest we got like
four days before it's here i mean like talk about the world bearing down on
your your on your garden that is for sure and
then it totally changes your plants and it is adaptable i mean
have you found that some of those occasions has resulted in really great
product yeah i mean if if they're fit to last and make it through sort of to
halloween you'll see you know the the the reward
is is worth the wait type thing and those plants are usually very hardy
um and often you know they're all going purple and reds right now basically so
over the next couple weeks they'll they'll go through that final um fade
out i call it but you know not a green leaf on the plant by the
time i'm harvesting them especially come october and yeah there's something
out there i mean rj may know more about you know how those terpenes and those
glands are you know stronger it seems like or
maybe they've got more of a mono uh layer of water protecting them
but at the end of the day it's all smelling excellent my property and
you know within a couple miles of my property right now you're
you're smelling skunk for the most i feel like the oils that are
kind of created on outdoor plants are much different than the indoor plants
all the outdoor that i've ever processed in my life has always come out
different than anything indoor it's always been
sappier it's always had a little x factor to it so
i'm not sure exactly what it is but there's something about the sun
that lights cannot replicate you know yeah i agree so just as a heads up i am
opening up the stage now i'm gonna i'm gonna
just because we've gone for an hour and 10 minutes we've got plenty of recording
stuff like that so i'm gonna just annex any of the recording stuff now so thank
you all for showing up i appreciate all of you and come on up to stage say
hello to our experts and open up the conversation feel free to
join the um don't drink your runoff i need i i just
want to fully disclose that don't drink your
runoff the key is why if you were in a buy
well because of the arsenic lead cadmium and everything that's probably in it
don't tell me what to do don't tell me what to do my body
but if you were in a bar water i'm fine
okay i love you guys you're the greatest what do you mean don't drink the water
i'm gonna drink that water you don't tell me what to do damon
you know you know i would not have met you guys
had it not been for covid and there is a silver lining to
every fucking shitty circumstance so thank you i love all of you i'm gonna
mute myself now don't drink your runoff okay
especially if you're putting um borax in the water like definitely don't drink
i was wondering that's funny a lot dude i love that
go ahead matt oh i was wondering if i could throw something in there
on harvesting something that i didn't really
hear that was mentioned because i think is
pretty often overlooked um is dry and cure time a lot of people
try and like cut you know right on you know like
day 75 or you know day 80 according to what the breeder said
but um the plant's still living once once you cut it and you can
kind of work into that schedule especially if you're trying to keep a
a cycling um grow going so like say it's like
five days away four days away i've found that um you can harvest a
little bit earlier and you're not necessarily losing too
much because the plant is still processing through um through
those days and then also one thing i want to add
two on top of harvesting is um if you can get you know
like a 60 to 75 x
um scope it's um really neat to track
the essential like oil um kind of ascension to the top of the
trichome head and there's a there's an instagram page called uh or
their names trichome trichome institute and they have
a bunch of good like pictures essentially
showing the different stages of the trichomes
um life and when it starts to brown like a lot of people
like to do is actually when it's starting to burst and a lot of
those oils are starting to leave so you can um still get some of that
that uh that like you know like amber effect by
harvesting right before they burst but still keeping them to a point
um uh that you're still getting everything
just want to do that well i mean that's a
point how at dr anubis i mean with your pc plant genetics how long does plant
tissue stay alive after it's been severed from the root system
i've always kind of wondered this because i've heard this before there
were many plants that do this and actually there's like peppers that
you harvest and hang them upside down for a long period of time and
that way you complete the process of them developing so is it the same way
with cannabis is there still a lot of activity in
no so the same way that everything when it quote unquote
dies i mean you know you cut off the cells aren't all going to know at
the same time like hey we're done there's no more movement but eventually
like very quickly cellular activity will slow
down water transport will slow down everything's going to cease to a grinding
halt and that organism is dead it doesn't take very
long um and you can see it happening cannabis
if you pull a leaf off in a matter of minutes it's going to
wilt it's going to be floppy that leaf is going to die it's not still
alive it's not going to continue to grow
unless you put it into water or something like that
uh to keep those cells potentially thinking they're still alive and
sometimes they do and and many times they do if you're doing
cloning um no uh you know anytime you harvest
something um bananas um
uh climatic and i mean there's we had a show about
this a couple of weeks ago about harvesting and curing so yes the the
chemical profile continues to change over and past harvest time but that
doesn't mean it's still living and changing it what it's
doing is it's curing it's like when you pick a green banana
that banana doesn't just stop be and continue to be green
it continues to ripen over time and eventually it will rot and turn brown
and black and and be a rotten banana that's not the
same as it living and growing and and um respirating and doing
photosynthesizing and doing things that a plant does it's
different it's a different process now it's um going through
an aging process things are oxidizing and
doing other things um so it's it's kind of a different process aging and
curing curing and harvest time it stops
that that plant from from living and breathing um but there is more to the
process after harvest which you know curing and
all that stuff is also an important process but not
this part of the when do you harvest question that we're addressing here
tonight so i just want to pop over and say like
awesome response because like i mean if you don't have a clone in a dome at
90 over 90 humidity it doesn't live like it just doesn't survive
so i thought it was an interesting point because there is a lot of reaction there
and i've heard this a lot matt i've heard this multiple times
before and i've wanted it but i just want to take a moment and just jump over
to manny uh as as he is the guy that put the
dank hour to get put the dank in the dank hour
congratulations manny we were talking about you a little bit earlier cannabis
is not a widget that is definitely something we'll often hear so
welcome to stage manny could you like maybe give a quick introduction because
we do have a pretty big audience as well as how do you decide when it's
almost time to harvest your cannabis hey guys uh nice to see the show doing
really well there's a very broad audience in here tonight so i'm
manny de silva from ontario canada i am the founder of forest farms cannabis
in ontario a licensed facility i also have
a facility that i'm doing in portugal and a few other things on the go that i
can't exactly talk about so when we talk about
harvesting everyone seems to have their own
sort of ideal time as to when to harvest
but for me it really depends on what you're doing with your harvest
for me i look for when my trichromes are cloudy with just a little tiny bit of
amber coming through and that's the optimal time to harvest
flower if you were going to harvest for hash i
would probably be looking at clearer trichromes and be
harvesting at that time and that's really what i based my uh my
harvest on over the years and i've been successful with it
and i'm done speaking
awesome manny and welcome to the stage and it's always
great to hear i can't wait i can't wait for you to be able to talk about the
stuff you can't talk about because we all know it's like
gonna be badass it's gonna be really interesting there so chase welcome to
the stage you meant you you shot me a message in
the back chat about nitrogen otherwise lower temp i don't know if i
100 percent got your question answered i'd love to give you the
opportunity to state it again and and and yeah if if if you would like
welcome to the stage sure thank you guys for for having me
um i did want to uh ask a couple of questions
um i i see this quite frequently that most large operations
you know they have issues when it comes to being able to harvest
large increments especially if you're looking at acreage
you know not everyone has the ability to be able to afford
nitrogen or some of the other methodologies to be able to flash
freeze things so what i see a lot of is tractor trailers that just have you
know some type of refrigeration type like a freezer like a us foods or a
cisco thing but what i see a lot of times
happening is by the time that they cut the plant
down they buck all the leaves pull all the buds off and then they get
these into their freezer bags and then they get it put into their tractor
trailer you're not looking you know within a two
hour time frame before that freezes because they're throwing
pounds on top of pounds on top of pounds so
you know by the time you are looking at 500
to say 5,000 pounds that you know it's literally
hours before some of those things freeze so
what would be an option to be able to do that where you have
terpene retentions because i'm seeing a lot of the outdoor
material on some of these larger scale farms
not having any terp profiles that are testing over two and a half percent
just because of the fact that they don't have the ability to use
co2 or liquid nitrogen and scale and then on top of that once they freeze it
and it's got across the state and say that it takes 10 hours to get back to
your operation you know what type of temperature
fluctuation well it was kind of what my question was
and then my second question is when you are harvesting for
like live resin or you're doing something that's going to be harvested
for concentrates and you are harvesting a week or two
early how does that affect the flush cycle
during that process just because stereotypically the last two weeks of
flower is when people are doing their flush
so when you are harvesting sooner does that mean that you are stopping
the feed regimen sooner and beginning that flush cycle ahead of
time and this is prominently with like your
live resins and stuff of that nature and how do you
combat that versus having significant
no residual nutrients still in that material so chase let me start off
by answering the last part of your question and then
i'm gonna let rj jump in because i know he's got answers for
the rest so flushing is a misnomer
and a um non-event it doesn't exist cannabis is a
bioaccumulator everything that that flower has
accumulated during its life cycle is in the plant no amount of straight
water is going to remove it that's first and foremost
so anybody that's still flushing you're just wasting your time
you can gradually reduce nutrients as you're going through the flower stage
so that by the time you get to your last um your last week or so you're down to
somewhere around between 50 and 100 ppm however flushing has been
scientifically proven on a number of different
levels that it is absolutely useless and a complete waste of time
so that's first and foremost i'll let rj answer the other question because i
know he's got an answer for it go ahead okay so um the temp the temp
fluctuation question uh with regards to shipping that's a
great question i actually was just talking about this
like two hours ago so i have the answer fresh in my head so
you can you can harvest with like lco2 ln2
or whatever you know as long as it's really getting frozen
but shipping is where it's tough because even the coldest freezer trucks
only go to minus 25 so if you're freezing that you know ln2 or lco2
temps you're you know negative 80 negative 100 and
lower so you're going to have a pretty drastic
fluctuation albeit still within the freezing temps but you
you will see that amount of fluctuation until you can get it back indoors
and get it into another another form of freezer
um i hope that answers your question uh question two
um in doing extractions i would just like kind of many said i
would just i would just chop it kind of when it was done
don't really need to worry about the flush i mean dependent on
the extraction process live resins yeah i mean to get it as clean as possible
you could definitely do a flush but you know like many said it's also
really not needed especially the way that we can do
extraction and refinement these days down to
like particle size filtration so even if you're saying to do
like a hydrocarbon extraction you wouldn't need to do
any remediation with any adsorbents you can still filter below one micron
which is outstanding um you know with rosin i think you know
you're getting between 25 and 37 microns so
there's a little bit more uh there but um yeah i don't think uh i don't think
the flush or you know what others would consider
the flush matters really at all when it comes to
extractions i mean extraction dependent right so if i
can if i could jump into so a check out we have an amazing episode
where we get all of these amazing people and talk about flushing and we actually
have that drop uh i don't know if it's on the youtube
yet or somewhere but it's out there and it or it's coming so make sure to
follow like but one thing that i would say for jace i mean you spoke about
having to find an alternative method in which to freeze your product out in
the field now i mean yeah i there are some
equipment it's it really it can be a lot cheaper than
people think to use liquid nitrogen or or or co2 to freeze but if you don't if
you don't have that option and you just need to find an alternative
is is a look at a lot of looking at the way that you freeze the product off is
are you putting it in a bag so that it's sealed are you putting it on
trays open out of the bag and allowing it to freeze first
and then placing it in the bag or even better yet are you taking it once you've
bucked off all these leaves throwing them on trays that are great
so there's airflow in between upside downside everywhere so you're
putting it in the freezer and you're getting the fastest freeze time you can
possible and then moving that into a bag that
is going to ensure that you're going to have the fastest rate of freezing we do
this all the time in the kitchen and in restaurants to freeze large volume of
products like i see this a lot and i've heard of this a lot of like packaging
like herbs or anything in in a plastic bag
first and then throwing it in the freezer slows down the freezing process
because there's no you know there's no air going through
anything so your center never ends up having a temperature
differential and that's when you get frost and you get freezer burn and all
these other issues because it's all about mitigating that increasing
time and storage right so if you can it decrease that freeze time as much as
possible by you know putting grates like open
grates like if you took a roll rack from a kitchen and put that
into a stand-up freezer and you were somehow able to power that
on the field and that was your work freezer okay you take that and you put
your you load up your trays and it'll freeze and that stuff will
freeze if you have a good like a good deep freeze stand-up freezer
with racks in it that stuff will freeze pretty fucking quick like i mean
like within an hour and then you can take it and put it
and store it afterwards into a bag and that way you can decrease that time if
you if you can't go that that alternative route and this is
just i'm just throwing out what i would do
theoretically and if anybody else on the stage has any other ideas or
alternatives go ahead and jump in there i mean chase
unfortunately uh certain quality processes you just can't skip and if you
do i mean you're going to pay for it in the
end product you know we're we're doing a massive field right now that's all
fresh frozen you know we're using nitrogen we're vacuum packing and we're
putting them in refrigerated reefers right away
unfortunately there there really isn't a less expensive way to do it
that still preserves the product at the level that you're looking for
i'm the same belief in regards to uh you know flushing and not being an
issue but i've had a situation where it's
actually made me kind of even still question that um and what it
was i don't know if you guys have ever heard of roots organics they have a
tea that you can use as a top dressing and we had a commercial facility that
literally did their last feeding with this stuff
and the stuff does have uh two percent sulfur in it and
they only were able to get like two or three days flush out of it and it
literally altered the taste of the product to the point where like it
was distinguishably noticeable um and the product that was able to
finish out and actually go the whole duration of time
um didn't have that so it made me question
you know and maybe it was that one particular
nutrient line i just don't have that much experience running any of the
aurora type stuff um or the roots organics product but it was something
that i did observe in the field that kind of made me
question that too because i used to have that same thought process that
you know it made a difference and then you know i've listened to the same
things that everyone else has in regards to it not making a difference and i've
seen some of the scientific reporting saying that it doesn't make a
difference but i guess in a scenario that
contradicts that i'm still trying to figure out
how that happened why that happened and don't
sorry chase just just to kind of give you a little context on that
i do not believe that it it is um that it is exactly as what you're
saying and the reason why i'm saying that is that
whatever the plant uptakes cannot be removed
so if near the end of your plant cycle your flowering cycle
you're jamming the plant with all kinds of nutrients
that's going to show up in the plant however
the science has shown and has proven that what you put in you can't remove
back out and i think that's that's where the disconnect is that
people think that you know if you've overfed it
in the last couple weeks that miraculously you can feed nothing but
straight water and it's going to strip whatever um overfeeding you've done
away from the plant and i think that's where where the misconception is
if you do feed a plant a ton of nitrogen or a ton of sulfur whatever it is it's
going to show up in that bud because obviously
when you cut that bud down if you're if you're not flash freezing
if you're drying and you're curing that plant is still going to be alive
during that that time and that uh metabolic process is still going on
you follow so before we get a little bit late go ahead josh i just i think we're
gonna slowly start moving towards the shutdown
here and getting towards the end of vernon
no problem uh so i'm just gonna speak to that a little bit as well so
with the sulfur um and flushing um so people like the you know the two
weeks when people normally flush at that point
if you're feeding to that stage of growth
that's very different than feeding you know
to the stage of growth previous to that which would be the bulking stage which
you're going to be pounding nutrients to it if you're in a salt-based system
um even in an organic system when you you know top dress your nutrients
the plant will take that up that nutrient will be stored in vacuoles
within the cells until it's utilized by the cell and
incorporated into the plant structure um so it is
in there um and then it needs to get used up so if it hasn't been used up
it's gonna be retained in the plant material and plant cells
um that's when you're gonna have you know like the really black ash and stuff
like that that's you know the buildup of the mobile
nutrients that haven't been utilized yet um but if you're feeding to the
you know stage of growth and it's in the ripening stage and you're just giving it
like a very very small amount of food that's not you know it's
using up that amount of food that you're giving it so there's a very
you know very different than just you know giving continuing to give
the plant what you would have given it in week six you know in week seven week
eight week nine um you need to tailor your nutrients to
the stage of growth but yeah i appreciate the insight i
wasn't talking about my own growth this was just something that
i was doing a consulting gig for and just trying to figure out you know why
because um you know i do try to educate myself
as much as possible but you know whenever there was something there
and then you know having that argument but at the same time not really
um you know because it goes against you know this has only been in the last few
years that this has come to light um so anyways
appreciate all the feedback and insight and i'll
shut up now so thanks guys no chase you brought
an amazing point of conversation to the table and i
really appreciate it and i think before we we jump too
hard into flashing is that we need to remember that we are talking about
winter harvest cannabis today uh but if i just want to ask to any of
the moderators or anybody else left up on the stage if you have
anything you would like to say go ahead and flash your mic now
otherwise we are going to shut down the room
and you can come and check out this i release them every month on my youtube
um so don't forget to check this out click on instagram check out all the
amazing moderators that we have dr anabis does takeovers and like she's
got her own website under her name believe it or not so dr
anna shout yourself out real quick there i think you want
um well i was going to say something about
um this whole harvesting thing is like when i started out my cannabis journey
and people told me to harvest at 80 percent this and that i was like
what the fuck like i'm a scientific person i'm a logical person i like
numbers and graphs and definitive answers and i was like
how are these people like harvesting at 80 percent clonid tritones and 10
percent amber and i'm like oh my god this is not scientific at all
no wonder uh test results are all over the board for
the same strains like this is ridiculous um which is why you know my
recommendation is to harvest that harvest your one plant at different
times during its growth during its maturation
phase to find out what what you like because everybody's
different um all the all growers are different
everybody has different sop so just um you know uh explore your journey
and figure out what it is you like um of course if you're facing
some issues that for example any just facing where you have weather conditions
that may not be conducive to keep pushing it just go ahead and harvest
but you know what i'm saying anyway you can reach me
pretty easily i have my own website www.annaswabi.com
which i'm working on having my other two web domains
um pointed to that website which will be drannabis drannabis and dr
annabis pointed at that so you'll be able to find me um which then you can
find me on linkedin and if you're savvy enough you might be
able to find me on a facebook i may or may not friend you but you can
always try um and uh yeah i'm always you know down to help
people wherever i can and i think that's all i have to say
if you if you flash the giant green marijuana leaf in the sky
dr annabis will find you
uh it depends maybe i mean i might be asleep
but no i you know if you really have um if you really have a question for me
it's not if it's something scientific and and
um or if i don't know the answer i sure do know somebody that knows the
answer i can kind of point you in the direct direction or
or suggest some literature or a book to read or whatever the case may be and i
i just love that there are so many folks that are
um able now to grow their own plants legally and uh kind of just
get fascinated about this plant that i am so
friggin passionate about i think it's fantastic
so i'm never going to turn away anybody um
who is has has questions it doesn't matter how silly you think
the questions may be everybody's at a different place in
their journey so um if you need something you know hit me
up if you can um or just come and hang out
with us here on on tuesday night i also have a thing
on monday nights where we talk about scientific papers where
many science we don't prove anything we collect evidence
and we support what we think but we don't ever prove anything
for example flushing um but you can come listen to us talk about science on
monday nights at 8 30 um yep yep i'm done
awesome do they have a good yeah so actually uh one of the topics
for when to harvest your cannabis that i
realized we didn't actually cover was you know what
time of day uh to harvest your cannabis and
personally with my outdoor you know presuming that
i've actually been able to get it to go to the
you know the time that i want i generally will harvest my plants
uh very early in the morning um before the sun comes up if i can but
i'm a bit of a night owl so generally it's as the sun is coming up
with indoor um it's relatively similar you know as the lights you know are
coming on and an indoor uh if you're in a you know like a
commercial facility i normally would just have
the working light to come on instead of the actual room lights so that you don't
have you know the intense heat from the
the uh the grow lights um but yeah that way your you know
terpenes are generally around the into the highest
point in that day but again you know every strain is different
you know if you're in a grow room all the time and you know that
at around 11 o'clock in the day the plants just really really put off
their you know the terpenes and you know aim for a
harvest around that time um but yeah that's uh my two cents
thanks everyone. Josh way to kick it because that is like
such a good point and we totally didn't cover it because i mean uv light
and and very strong light can break down these things they're essentially like a
sunscreen so i mean it's super important to touch
on these little facts now matt did you have something to say to our moderators
before we shut down? well i was just gonna essentially
like tag on like everything that that the research
shows and all of the old like you know herb books
for the most part across the board unless it's a harvest at night you know
plant it's like always like first thing in the morning or like right when the
sun kind of starts to get it to wake up and it
starts to first express itself is what i've seen but then also a
little rule of thumb i like to keep in my mind that i like to share with
everybody you can't or like i like to remind myself
you can't go too late in harvesting because when i was in the
middle east i would see these guys with like snow on their plants like
leaning over and i would like you know like you
ask these guys like are you gonna harvest that or they
remember i asked him and they'd be like no it's not ready yet
it's not ready and like it's like looking like it should be ready but
i mean this plant will go and go so it's never too late you know there's
always a sweet spot for everybody
go ahead christopher hey hello guys i just wanted to say
something about the harvest you can manipulate the harvest by light
cycles if you have a for example ruralis or you
have indica so you have sativas and you want to make it longer or you
want to make it shorter or you're not sure you make the light
the dark cycle longer like normally i do 13
and in bec on my back i do normally 10 hours of back
of dark like that i do like a kind of it goes slow and the reason why the
the indoor the outdoor is so different is because the conditions
and out outside the sun goes really really slowly so you have the time
to the plant to adapt to all these kind of things in
indoors you suddenly one day you just cut it you put in
12 12 and the plant doesn't have the time to adjust
all the things inside to start to flower to start to change the metabolism so
if you really want to rush your harvest change the cycle make it 14
i've heard a little bit about this before i hear you can also
like depending on some strange like banana sometimes like you have to be a
little bit careful they have to be super stable
that mostly is because they don't have a male and because they don't have a male
around they get really like a worry and they
start to kind of like after really long periods of flowering they start to get
worry and they start to get bananas to try to reproduce themselves so
sometimes it's really good to have just a male
cover it in a tent and the girls are happy it's all about keeping the girls
happy and conditions you can have the shitty
genetics and you can make a really really the
top shell by conditions it's all about this
guys it's the only thing i want to say awesome
well thank you christopher for coming up because i mean you
you're here for every single show that we do so we appreciate it and thanks for
going out to join in so i am going to shut down the room everyone
i just want to say thank you to dr anubis again for every little bit that
you put in here josh your wealth of knowledge and
you get you make sure that we keep every single point damon you're always a joy
and i'll laugh and you gave a very blunt but also very
in-depth anther 90 percent all right thank you everyone so later
tonight we got hash tuesdays my god for all the
hash smokers
uh that is tonight that's 9 p.m pacific and uh
that's not me that's me and by the way this is
this is what this is
what i got to deal with today
so i'm weak i'm spineless i have zero knowledge i'm money grubbing
clout chasing but it's cool ain't no one serious ever gonna come near
your show sealed your own fate ain't just speaking
for myself either people make choices that affect them permanently with the
folks that were here long before you so matt
right evidently was here long before me
got here and will be here long after you leave and start your next podcast and
whatever you think will make you money because i am making money hand over fist
right now sitting in the garage sad really i always hope
the next generation will have someone upstanding
show up so anyway that was uh
that was the you're good enough you're smart enough and doggone it people like
you uh motivational comment of the day for me
anyway i feel like i'm just feeling the money roll in right now
uh so anyway tonight yes i don't know uh
what i did to him but uh anyway more hap on a happier note
this is uh later tonight so i'm gonna get uh my three-year-old out of the crib
bring everyone to the dinner table and chad and
brett and crew will be with you at 9 p.m pacific that would be
midnight bar harbor main and with that i'm gonna kill the
broadcast thanks everyone
