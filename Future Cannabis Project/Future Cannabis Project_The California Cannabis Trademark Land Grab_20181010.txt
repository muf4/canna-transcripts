[00:16.120 --> 00:23.120]  What's the current state of, and what do you project the future for, people who create
[00:23.120 --> 00:30.120]  killer genetics being able to give it out and know that they're not going to lose control
[00:30.120 --> 00:37.120]  and get fucked and never be the ones, like someone's just going to steal it and call
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.120]  it their own?
[00:38.120 --> 00:42.760]  There's really two areas of intellectual property that that would relate to.
[00:42.760 --> 00:46.320]  One, your strongest level of enforcement would be a patent.
[00:46.320 --> 00:55.240]  Also really hard to get, but if it could be granted, it would have a range of profile
[00:55.240 --> 01:00.040]  for cannabinoids, growing style for the plant.
[01:00.040 --> 01:03.480]  It's going to be very specific to that kind of plant.
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.920]  Now we haven't seen any of that enforced yet in the industry, but in theory, if someone
[01:08.920 --> 01:15.400]  stole your genetics that was inexactable one for one, if you could have a patent registered
[01:15.400 --> 01:22.880]  on this prior to putting it in commerce or prior to the theft, that would be the strongest
[01:22.880 --> 01:24.340]  enforcement.
[01:24.340 --> 01:25.660]  Most people are not going to do that.
[01:25.660 --> 01:27.860]  Most people can't afford that.
[01:27.860 --> 01:34.360]  The question of being able to show the evidence that you actually cultivated in a specific
[01:34.360 --> 01:44.220]  way that would qualify for the patent registration, most people can't really provide that evidence.
[01:44.220 --> 01:49.100]  The more accessible way would be through a trademark.
[01:49.100 --> 01:53.640]  What you would do is you would concede that the genetics are going to get out, but what
[01:53.640 --> 02:00.640]  you would focus on is this is, so we'll say the strain is stardust.
[02:00.640 --> 02:02.520]  That's what you decided to call it.
[02:02.520 --> 02:10.000]  You would focus on I am great seeds, which is the brand, trademark, stardust.
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.760]  If other people are buying stardust from other creators or other cultivators, they trust
[02:19.760 --> 02:20.760]  your brand.
[02:20.760 --> 02:27.640]  I think that is one of the best ways we can do it right now because if you see other packaging,
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.000]  so long as you record your trademark with the state of California, which as of January
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.760]  2nd at 9am, they started accepting cannabis trademarks for cannabis goods and services.
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.360]  So long as you're not trying to trademark the name of the strain, which is not allowed
[02:42.360 --> 02:50.600]  at the federal level, if a plant has ever been identified by its cultivar, rule 1202.12,
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.960]  I believe of the TMEP states that any plant identified by its cultivar, that cultivar
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.840]  is not able to be registered as a trademark.
[02:59.160 --> 03:03.160]  If you want to do more research on this, check out what happened with the Honeycrisp apple
[03:03.160 --> 03:09.720]  situation that they filed the patent in the patent, identified Honeycrisp as the cultivar.
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.560]  Then University, I think it's a Minnesota, went to seek trademark protection at the federal
[03:13.560 --> 03:20.520]  level for Honeycrisp to which for the application, the inquiry was, well, is this the name, the
[03:20.520 --> 03:23.040]  cultivar name of the plant?
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.600]  And on the patent, it was registered as the cultivar name.
[03:26.600 --> 03:29.520]  So that, they ended up getting denied.
[03:29.520 --> 03:32.440]  They filed a trademark on Honeycrisp.
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.000]  So this law is already in effect for plants and actually for doing more research, they
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.960]  use the same law in Canada.
[03:38.960 --> 03:44.200]  So there is a novel issue with trying to protect strain names as trademarks right now that
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.720]  I think the industry is going to have to deal with a lot in the upcoming years.
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.240]  Probably in the next two years, we're going to see a lot more of this.
[03:51.240 --> 04:01.000]  But if you are the farm, the seed company, any of these brands, and you sell it as farm
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.160]  trademark TM, this strain for Stardust, that is a way to protect it.
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.480]  And you can have strength in this because if you see anyone else claiming, sure, the
[04:11.480 --> 04:16.180]  genetics might get grown, we're going to assume it's inferior quality.
[04:16.180 --> 04:20.240]  If it's better than yours, that only in certain ways helps to your legacy.
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.400]  If you say, I originally came up with this strain, but if anyone else is claiming that
[04:24.400 --> 04:29.240]  it's directly from your source, you're going to be able to fight that, which is a new opportunity
[04:29.240 --> 04:30.240]  in California.
[04:30.240 --> 04:31.240]  So.
[04:31.240 --> 04:35.760]  Which didn't previously exist before January 2nd, 2018.
[04:35.760 --> 04:37.560]  Yes, of this year.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.560]  Okay.
[04:38.560 --> 04:39.560]  Yeah.
[04:39.560 --> 04:48.560]  If I'm just an amazing grower and breeder, I think the issue now is I want to guard that
[04:48.880 --> 04:51.600]  like the Colonel's secret recipe.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.600]  Right.
[04:52.600 --> 04:53.600]  Which is a trade secret.
[04:53.600 --> 04:54.600]  Right.
[04:54.600 --> 05:00.200]  So do you see any time soon us getting to the point where I, as the amazing breeder
[05:00.200 --> 05:10.000]  slash cultivator, would willingly, for example, give my clippings to a nursery to then propagate,
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.600]  to then sell to growers who would then flower it out, who would then get Stardust into the
[05:16.600 --> 05:17.600]  market?
[05:18.520 --> 05:19.600]  Kind of a cheeky answer.
[05:19.600 --> 05:26.480]  It depends on the range of penetration you want your genetics to have in the market.
[05:26.480 --> 05:32.200]  Maybe you're like, you find a sweetheart deal and you just do a license of, I'm going to
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.200]  write a contract with this cultivator and give them just one plant that they're, and
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.040]  this is the one company that I'm going to do it with because I really believe in their
[05:40.040 --> 05:42.320]  ability to propagate this.
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.680]  Maybe you would do that, especially if you have some mystique or some renown for being
[05:46.760 --> 05:49.280]  a geneticist.
[05:49.280 --> 05:50.680]  I think that could be viable.
[05:50.680 --> 05:57.480]  But if you want to hold it really tight, trying to establish that chain of control is very
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.760]  difficult right now.
[05:58.760 --> 06:03.440]  Because really, if one clipping gets out, unless you've taken steps like filing a patent
[06:03.440 --> 06:07.960]  or registering a trademark and the genetics get loose, trying to assert ownership over
[06:07.960 --> 06:09.400]  that is unrealistic.
[06:09.400 --> 06:11.200]  It's just not going to happen right now.
[06:11.200 --> 06:16.440]  So I think you either have a really structured, I mean, if you wanted to try and, I don't
[06:16.440 --> 06:20.360]  even think protecting it as a trade secret would work that well, because as soon as you
[06:20.360 --> 06:22.320]  share it with someone, it's not really a secret.
[06:22.320 --> 06:26.960]  So yeah, I think protecting the name of it as a trademark or trying to get registration
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.840]  as the patent is best.
[06:28.840 --> 06:35.080]  But I do think there is incentive for people developing genetics to share this.
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.320]  You just have to create the brand around the genetics.
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.540]  That's the thing that'll be easiest for you to protect.
[06:40.540 --> 06:46.040]  And then it's just an incentive of, I provide quality clones or quality seeds, which I think
[06:46.040 --> 06:49.760]  there's going to be an increased demand for.
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.240]  That I think there's a really solid role for nurseries, especially supplying consistent
[06:55.240 --> 07:00.060]  clones to these large scale cultivating operations that maybe don't want to deal with having
[07:00.060 --> 07:04.240]  a constant clone supply or dedicating part of their grow operation to creating mother
[07:04.240 --> 07:06.460]  plants and doing that upkeep.
[07:06.460 --> 07:10.680]  So I think you could make a name for yourself definitely as a nursery.
[07:10.680 --> 07:19.160]  So if I'm, this actually gets into the contracts and agreements, if I'm the amazing breeder,
[07:19.160 --> 07:26.280]  what clauses would you recommend I put into a contract with a nursery that I think I trust
[07:26.280 --> 07:34.040]  to propagate my genetics and then sell them out to other people to flower?
[07:34.040 --> 07:36.120]  It's going to be a lot of restrictive clauses.
[07:36.120 --> 07:39.760]  So focused on how much plot space do I get?
[07:39.760 --> 07:41.920]  How many plants are you going to have in production for me?
[07:41.920 --> 07:47.320]  How many clones are, do you have to be accountable for tracking how many clones you take?
[07:47.320 --> 07:50.720]  Do I get to try and dictate who you sell the clones to?
[07:50.720 --> 07:51.720]  Things like that.
[07:51.720 --> 07:54.760]  So I can try and control the chain of command.
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.560]  The question for a lot of these would be, would they be enforceable terms?
[07:58.560 --> 08:02.760]  I feel like we haven't really tested that as much in California yet.
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.760]  This is going to happen though.
[08:03.760 --> 08:07.600]  I think this is an issue that probably there's a lot of agreements being developed around
[08:07.600 --> 08:10.480]  these terms right now.
[08:10.480 --> 08:14.440]  So a lot of restrictions of just, do I have the ability to inspect your site?
[08:14.440 --> 08:21.320]  Do I have, because a lot of these are like getting creative with the amount of control
[08:21.320 --> 08:26.400]  without saying I actually have an ownership interest in your business or, because you're
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.000]  still potentially running the risk of having someone be like, tear up your contract.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.040]  I'm going to go do whatever I want.
[08:32.040 --> 08:37.760]  So I think for someone developing genetics, finding the solid relationship first, where
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.880]  hopefully you're never going to need to enforce the contract is key.
[08:41.880 --> 08:44.800]  Or your inverse of that is I just believe in my genetics.
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.320]  I want them out there.
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.760]  I have my trademark attached to this and they get to use my trademark saying I'm buying
[08:49.760 --> 08:53.720]  clones from nursery X or seed producer X.
[08:53.720 --> 08:55.040]  And I just want everyone to have them.
[08:55.040 --> 08:58.520]  Like if everyone, if all of California was growing my genetics, I would love that because
[08:58.640 --> 09:02.160]  my market penetration is amazing.
[09:02.160 --> 09:08.960]  So yeah, I think trying to control these things where if you find out your employee, so I
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.160]  give you this plan and I find out your employee brought it home and shared it with their friends,
[09:14.160 --> 09:19.960]  trying to have some form of legal recourse and then like enforcing that is really difficult
[09:19.960 --> 09:22.520]  and cost prohibitive for a lot of businesses.
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.280]  So theoretically that could work, but then trying to assess what are the damages, you
[09:28.280 --> 09:34.440]  know, where is the value that was detracted from my part of the contract?
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.480]  That seems kind of onerous and undefined right now.
[09:38.480 --> 09:42.280]  Once again, I mean, it's going to depend contract and relationship by relationship, contract
[09:42.280 --> 09:43.800]  by contract.
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.880]  But I think the enforceability for a lot of these things would be more cost prohibitive.
[09:48.880 --> 09:52.600]  It's a lot easier if it's premised around something like you're infringing on my trademark.
[09:52.600 --> 09:56.040]  You're using my trademark in a way I don't want or in the case of if there was a patent
[09:56.040 --> 09:58.920]  registered in that sense.
[09:58.920 --> 10:00.480]  But just, hey, I wrote a contract with you.
[10:00.480 --> 10:02.760]  I trust you with my genetics.
[10:02.760 --> 10:05.520]  Don't dick me over.
[10:05.520 --> 10:08.560]  That is a harder one to enforce, especially for assessing damages.
[10:08.560 --> 10:13.560]  What are some IP issues you're dealing with in cannabis specifically?
[10:13.560 --> 10:14.960]  I mean, is it just brand?
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.960]  Majority of my practice is in trademarks.
[10:17.960 --> 10:25.080]  And because California just started this opportunity to register trademarks for cannabis goods
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.600]  and services, there's a little bit of a land grab going on right now.
[10:29.600 --> 10:35.920]  And if you register first, trying to invalidate that registration if someone else has a superior
[10:35.920 --> 10:39.520]  right to the trademark is fairly problematic.
[10:39.520 --> 10:40.520]  It's a litigation.
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.060]  There is not a I'm going to call up and complain to the state and invalidate your trademark.
[10:44.160 --> 10:45.660]  That really doesn't happen.
[10:45.660 --> 10:51.540]  So trying to establish what you own right now is huge.
[10:51.540 --> 10:56.900]  Talking about agreements and other issues that are coming up, the due diligence side,
[10:56.900 --> 11:02.060]  the wild claims of who owns what right now are pretty amazing in some cases.
[11:02.060 --> 11:07.340]  And doing the actual due diligence of saying, if I'm going to contract with you, make sure
[11:07.340 --> 11:12.580]  that I see documentation substantiating that you actually own this intellectual property,
[11:12.580 --> 11:19.060]  not a hey, I own this because there has been certain famous strains that have made the
[11:19.060 --> 11:24.740]  news where there was an assertion of I own this because I'm telling everyone I do.
[11:24.740 --> 11:27.360]  That doesn't make it legally binding.
[11:27.360 --> 11:30.060]  And there is some of that going on right now.
[11:30.060 --> 11:36.260]  So I encourage diligence, especially have an understanding of whatever you're trying
[11:36.260 --> 11:40.700]  to license and make sure that you've taken steps to protect it.
[11:40.700 --> 11:46.440]  Or if you're taking your licensing something from someone, make sure it actually has value.
[11:46.440 --> 11:52.060]  There is a very low understanding, I feel like, of different intellectual property issues
[11:52.060 --> 11:54.380]  in the cannabis space right now.
[11:54.380 --> 11:58.540]  And I don't expect everyone to just know these things, you know, but work with someone who
[11:58.540 --> 12:03.260]  does because I've seen.
[12:03.260 --> 12:08.740]  I've seen some agreements that I don't know if they will they would hold up in court.
[12:08.780 --> 12:14.700]  I've seen some requests that I don't think are reasonable.
[12:14.700 --> 12:18.460]  And then from the other side of outside of agreements, I've seen some filings and recordings
[12:18.460 --> 12:23.580]  that have been done that are just completely invalid or should never have been done.
[12:23.580 --> 12:28.820]  And so I think there is an immense amount of value going forward for protecting your
[12:28.820 --> 12:30.500]  intellectual property.
[12:30.500 --> 12:36.180]  But having an understanding what that actually is and if it one, is it protectable to have
[12:36.180 --> 12:37.940]  I taken the steps to protect it?
[12:37.940 --> 12:40.060]  Or three, if I'm engaging someone else, do they own it?
[12:40.060 --> 12:43.500]  Like those are really fundamental questions you need to be asking.
[12:43.500 --> 12:48.500]  So with everything you just said, can we give some concrete examples?
[12:48.500 --> 12:50.300]  Because you said like intellectual property.
[12:50.300 --> 12:55.220]  So like that's like an example that'd be like, I created Peters brand in Colorado and you're
[12:55.220 --> 12:58.420]  going to license Peters brand in California.
[12:58.420 --> 13:04.260]  Is your point that you the California guy should make sure I can show you trademarks?
[13:04.260 --> 13:05.260]  Yes.
[13:05.340 --> 13:08.940]  So in that case, you're probably going to write into part of the licensing agreement
[13:08.940 --> 13:11.580]  when you license into California.
[13:11.580 --> 13:16.540]  I'm not going to seek trademark protection trying to usurp your registration.
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.340]  And after I start using your trademark, you're going to register the registration.
[13:21.340 --> 13:23.180]  There is a lot of room for that to go bad.
[13:23.180 --> 13:28.420]  Also, if you're coming in from out of state, if you the licensee hasn't taken steps to
[13:28.420 --> 13:31.740]  protect if you're just basing this purely off of state, right.
[13:31.980 --> 13:38.860]  There's no federal registrations and that isn't registered to have the license or turn
[13:38.860 --> 13:42.740]  around and then register some of the intellectual property.
[13:42.740 --> 13:46.140]  That's totally a plausible outcome.
[13:46.140 --> 13:49.700]  So taking the steps to say, hey, if we're going to do this, you're going to forego X,
[13:49.700 --> 13:52.380]  Y and Z and allow me to do it.
[13:52.380 --> 13:56.560]  And then we understand that really that's going to be the sub substance of this agreement.
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.820]  But I might not have had the opportunity to even register the trademark yet.
[14:00.820 --> 14:09.660]  So you Colorado Colorado, because most so between federal and state trademark applications
[14:09.660 --> 14:14.060]  at the federal level, you're allowed to do what's called a 1B filing or an intent to
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.060]  use filing.
[14:15.060 --> 14:19.940]  A 1A filing is that I'm actually using the trademark in commerce.
[14:19.940 --> 14:24.300]  And mind you, you can't get a federal trademark on cannabis or cannabis goods and services
[14:24.300 --> 14:28.380]  because it's a violation of the Controlled Substance Act due to the Schedule 1 status.
[14:28.380 --> 14:30.060]  So that's not lawful use in commerce.
[14:30.300 --> 14:33.020]  The best you can do is ancillary goods and services.
[14:33.020 --> 14:37.620]  But at the state level, depending on the state you're in, you can register on goods and services
[14:37.620 --> 14:39.340]  for cannabis.
[14:39.340 --> 14:42.100]  But the requirement there is there is no 1B filing.
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.480]  There's only I'm actually using it.
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.860]  So if you're coming from Colorado licensing the brand into California, you probably haven't
[14:48.860 --> 14:51.060]  used the trademark in commerce yet.
[14:51.060 --> 14:53.940]  And the licensee will be the first one to use it.
[14:53.940 --> 14:58.980]  So if they use it and then registered it right away, you've created a very and you haven't
[14:58.980 --> 15:03.220]  included a term saying you are not going to do the registration.
[15:03.220 --> 15:06.140]  I'm going to do the registration and own it.
[15:06.140 --> 15:10.900]  You're creating a very interesting issue with the contract because who really owns the trademark
[15:10.900 --> 15:12.220]  then?
[15:12.220 --> 15:16.420]  And did that trademark get entered into the agreement or so?
[15:16.420 --> 15:19.260]  Yeah, that there are a lot of problems.
[15:19.260 --> 15:25.700]  There is we can't generally do an A to B solution for cannabis right now.
[15:25.700 --> 15:30.380]  There's usually a few extra steps, and especially at the state level when it's state to state,
[15:30.380 --> 15:34.700]  because your protection doesn't expand past the state that you've registered in.
[15:34.700 --> 15:39.060]  So taking those steps to say, OK, well, if we're going to license into another state,
[15:39.060 --> 15:44.580]  how do we go about protecting ourselves either before the agreement is signed or in conjunction
[15:44.580 --> 15:45.580]  with signing the agreement?
[15:45.580 --> 15:46.580]  So state to state licensing is the thing that popped into my head.
[15:46.580 --> 15:47.580]  But what are some other licensing agreement types that you can do?
[15:47.580 --> 16:02.260]  I mean, you're going to see some internal, maybe even a term of, hey, if you're producing
[16:02.260 --> 16:07.540]  this for me, I'm going to license you my trademark, even if it's just internally in the same state.
[16:07.540 --> 16:10.760]  I don't maybe I'm not going after a manufacturing license.
[16:10.760 --> 16:12.780]  So but I own intellectual property.
[16:12.780 --> 16:17.500]  So I'm going to license you my trademark or my branding and then have you create the products
[16:18.420 --> 16:22.060]  We probably have some sort of free agreement for you to create, do the manufacturing.
[16:22.060 --> 16:27.600]  And then I would maybe collect a royalty royalty payment for the use of the trademark.
[16:27.600 --> 16:28.600]  Maybe with art.
[16:28.600 --> 16:34.340]  So if somebody designs some really cool art for your packaging or your website or something,
[16:34.340 --> 16:37.740]  and they would license you, write a licensing agreement if you have limited access to my
[16:37.740 --> 16:43.860]  art or my artistic works, and then that's hopefully protected by a copyright registration,
[16:43.860 --> 16:47.220]  that that would get bundled into the licensing agreement.
[16:47.940 --> 16:52.100]  For patents, you know, maybe I have a method that I have registered a patent on method
[16:52.100 --> 16:56.140]  of extraction, and I will license you the use of that technique.
[16:56.140 --> 17:00.700]  Or if there's a machine that I don't want to manufacture because it's going to be too
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.540]  expensive, but you have a great manufacturing facility.
[17:03.540 --> 17:08.020]  I'll license you my design that I've registered as a patent.
[17:08.020 --> 17:09.900]  Trade secrets.
[17:09.900 --> 17:16.580]  Maybe I have an edible company that I'm just known for having amazingly good cookies.
[17:16.620 --> 17:21.380]  And my recipe, I've not shared with anyone, and that's my proprietary blend.
[17:21.380 --> 17:25.820]  And I'm going to license you that so long as you don't share the secret with anyone.
[17:25.820 --> 17:27.820]  Your employees generally don't know.
[17:27.820 --> 17:32.460]  There's probably some other restriction in the agreement where that extra little secret,
[17:32.460 --> 17:36.820]  when I put nutmeg in it, like one or two people at your company know that and they do it in
[17:36.820 --> 17:38.980]  the back room.
[17:38.980 --> 17:40.340]  But all those things could be internally.
[17:40.340 --> 17:41.700]  Those don't have to be state to state.
[17:41.700 --> 17:47.100]  You're going to see a lot more dynamic licensing agreements between businesses that don't necessarily
[17:47.100 --> 17:49.460]  do everything.
[17:49.460 --> 17:55.440]  Or somebody's standout and they don't have the ability to maximize on production.
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.640]  So let's license it to someone else and let's collect royalty payments.
[17:59.640 --> 18:03.020]  Just as much also, so state to state.
[18:03.020 --> 18:05.540]  We're going to start seeing international.
[18:05.540 --> 18:07.820]  Definitely branding is moving international.
[18:07.820 --> 18:10.940]  The concept of international cannabis brand is very real.
[18:10.940 --> 18:13.980]  It's not a theoretical like that's going on.
[18:13.980 --> 18:17.240]  And that it gets only more dynamic because then you have two different jurisdictions
[18:17.240 --> 18:20.460]  of law trying to figure out how do you do an enforcement?
[18:20.460 --> 18:21.460]  What's the obligation?
[18:21.460 --> 18:24.900]  What's my ability to police or monitor my contract?
[18:24.900 --> 18:28.780]  What do the international clients want to do in California?
[18:28.780 --> 18:31.620]  Trademarks, especially Canada.
[18:31.620 --> 18:35.140]  And actually I just learned that they're going to have an issue with social media.
[18:36.140 --> 18:43.340]  It sounds like there will be a way to do agreements where trademarks get brought up from California,
[18:43.340 --> 18:44.740]  get used in Canada.
[18:44.740 --> 18:46.620]  Canada has restrictive packaging.
[18:46.620 --> 18:49.020]  So it's a very dumbed down packaging.
[18:49.020 --> 18:53.620]  But if you have a brand that already has a very flourished social media presence.
[18:53.620 --> 18:56.220]  In, for example, California.
[18:56.220 --> 18:57.220]  Exactly.
[18:57.220 --> 19:02.800]  So being imposed to building a grassroots up brand where you have very limited marketing
[19:03.080 --> 19:08.440]  and your packaging is nondescript and you have this much space for a logo.
[19:08.440 --> 19:09.440]  In Canada.
[19:09.440 --> 19:10.440]  There are massive packaging.
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.960]  Just was learning about this massive packaging restrictions.
[19:13.960 --> 19:17.440]  So if you have an American brand or it doesn't have to be American.
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.120]  You have a brand that already has a robust following and brand identity.
[19:22.120 --> 19:25.440]  Putting that on because people, the natural people use their phones.
[19:25.440 --> 19:27.200]  Oh, what is this?
[19:27.240 --> 19:33.000]  And if there's already this developed market, I think for consumers, that's fairly persuasive
[19:33.000 --> 19:40.320]  opposed to what's this other brand that has maybe 3000 social media followers or like,
[19:40.320 --> 19:41.320]  is that any good?
[19:41.320 --> 19:47.640]  Might be good, but it doesn't have as much of a following and a lot of consumption or
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.720]  consumers buy based off of the reviews of other people.
[19:51.720 --> 19:54.120]  Or have I heard of this before?
[19:54.120 --> 19:59.840]  So yeah, bringing California brands that are established up to to Canada.
[19:59.840 --> 20:03.080]  Is in discussions.
[20:03.080 --> 20:06.680]  That is definitely in discussions from a different international.
[20:06.680 --> 20:08.120]  And I have not worked on this.
[20:08.120 --> 20:13.960]  I spoke with an Israeli attorney about it, but trying to do patent licensing issues from
[20:13.960 --> 20:18.880]  Israel to the United States and even doing completion of research and development in
[20:18.880 --> 20:24.100]  Israel for aspects of patents that we couldn't do the research on in the United States without
[20:24.100 --> 20:25.860]  being federally illegal.
[20:25.860 --> 20:30.020]  So just doing research for that amount in a different country and then bringing that
[20:30.020 --> 20:33.980]  part of the patent back or that part of the intellectual property back.
[20:33.980 --> 20:37.860]  And from the international side, my advice would just be hire an international attorney.
[20:37.860 --> 20:42.500]  Like if you for these deals, you should be working with someone domestically who has
[20:42.500 --> 20:46.860]  your own best interests and they should have a counterpart in the other country who also
[20:46.860 --> 20:48.540]  then can say, well, here's the laws.
[20:48.540 --> 20:49.540]  Here's how this is same.
[20:49.540 --> 20:51.900]  Here's this is how this is different.
[20:51.900 --> 20:55.980]  As opposed to just relying on the other side you're licensing to having their representation
[20:55.980 --> 21:00.060]  and telling you, oh, yeah, this is our part of the contract is good.
[21:00.060 --> 21:01.860]  That is not sufficient representation.
[21:01.860 --> 21:04.020]  And so that's why either working.
[21:04.020 --> 21:09.400]  I can see where there's an advantage to maybe working with law firms that have a presence
[21:09.400 --> 21:11.340]  in multiple countries.
[21:11.340 --> 21:13.060]  I don't think that's essential.
[21:13.060 --> 21:16.700]  But I think just finding attorneys in both countries that have a good knowledge base
[21:16.700 --> 21:20.300]  of cannabis and how it relates to intellectual property or intellectual property relates
[21:20.300 --> 21:21.300]  to cannabis.
[21:21.300 --> 21:21.320]  So, yeah.
