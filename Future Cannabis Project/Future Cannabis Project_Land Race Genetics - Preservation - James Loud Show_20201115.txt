[00:01.850 --> 00:09.450]  All right, good morning everyone. It is 11 a.m. on the Pacific Coast of California
[00:09.450 --> 00:17.450]  on Sunday. We are here for the Sunday morning James Loud show with our host
[00:17.450 --> 00:21.450]  Mr. James Loud. And what hat are we wearing today, James?
[00:21.450 --> 00:26.650]  We got the Loud Seeds San Francisco hat. It's the Giants clone. It's grassroots.
[00:26.810 --> 00:34.250]  We got a hemp hat. It's fantastic. I love it. It's the last one I got. We ordered 420 of them
[00:34.250 --> 00:39.130]  and this is the last one. So we're looking at ordering some more in the future. But
[00:39.130 --> 00:42.970]  thanks for tuning in everybody. Today is episode seven of the James Loud show.
[00:43.610 --> 00:50.650]  I've got Aladdin from Khalifa Genetics and Jamal from the Sawdew Seed Collective here.
[00:50.650 --> 00:55.450]  And we're going to talk about strains and genetics today. How are you guys doing?
[00:56.650 --> 01:01.370]  Pretty good. How are you? How are you James? I'm doing excellent, man. So why don't you tell
[01:01.370 --> 01:07.850]  everybody a little bit about yourself, where you're tuning in from? So yeah, I'm in Spain right now.
[01:08.810 --> 01:17.610]  So it's like 8 p.m. Wow. Nice. How's the weather out there? Well, it's pretty warm.
[01:17.610 --> 01:21.930]  It's pretty warm. It's like 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So it's like 20 something Celsius.
[01:22.650 --> 01:28.170]  It's like the weather here is perfect all year round, but it's just super hot in the summer.
[01:28.170 --> 01:34.170]  Apart from that, it's pretty good. Excellent. So as far as you work with Landrace Genetics,
[01:34.170 --> 01:40.330]  I follow your Instagram feed and you get a great feed. And you want to tell us a little bit about
[01:40.330 --> 01:46.010]  your genetic program and what you're doing as far as preserving land races and everything else?
[01:46.650 --> 01:53.130]  All right, sure. So we started breeding and we decided to work with land races
[01:53.770 --> 02:00.330]  and in order to broaden the gene pool. And well, at first we didn't want to
[02:00.330 --> 02:04.730]  like preserve the strains. It takes a lot of time. It's a lot of hard work.
[02:05.290 --> 02:11.690]  And what we wanted to do at first was just use these land races to create some very unique
[02:11.690 --> 02:18.410]  strains with unique flavor profiles and unique effects. But we realized that preservation was
[02:18.410 --> 02:24.090]  great because these strains, unfortunately, these land races are disappearing in a lot of countries.
[02:25.450 --> 02:30.970]  And we thought that we could also preserve the land race varieties that we work with
[02:30.970 --> 02:38.890]  for the breeding programs so we can do both. Excellent. So Jamal, we're from the same area.
[02:39.210 --> 02:42.730]  You're from the Bay Area as well. And you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?
[02:43.690 --> 02:52.890]  Yeah, my name is Jamal. I live in the Bay Area. I'm part of a seed collective.
[02:53.690 --> 03:02.010]  And with our seed collective, we grow heirloom varieties, some that are land race,
[03:02.010 --> 03:08.170]  some that are just rare and not grown that much anymore. Part of my inspiration to start
[03:08.170 --> 03:14.970]  growing land race variety was from the Indian Land Race Exchange. And specifically, I believe
[03:14.970 --> 03:22.330]  his name is iRaising on Instagram. And through learning about him and learning about various
[03:22.330 --> 03:29.450]  varieties from other parts of the world, I started growing them and preserving them,
[03:29.450 --> 03:34.570]  or saving them in seed form, sharing them with other people. How long have you been doing it?
[03:35.450 --> 03:41.290]  This is my third year of, I would say, hardcore preservation.
[03:42.090 --> 03:45.370]  And how many varieties are you doing with the preservation?
[03:47.370 --> 03:53.050]  So we have, we're working on about three right now. With, you know, a lot of,
[03:54.090 --> 04:00.810]  with preservation first comes exploring the strain. After you explore it, you then decide
[04:00.810 --> 04:09.050]  if that's something worth preserving. So there are three that I've been working with, and one of
[04:09.050 --> 04:14.410]  them has really come to the level that I believe is right for me to preserve. And that one is the
[04:14.410 --> 04:22.090]  Wailing Valley from, I believe it's Milana, India. Nice. Well, let's talk a little bit about actually
[04:22.090 --> 04:28.330]  what land race means. Because I feel like there's a big disconnect in the world of cannabis from
[04:28.330 --> 04:33.050]  people that are growing seed packs. They hear the word land race and they automatically think it's
[04:33.050 --> 04:38.570]  like wild cannabis that's cultivated, that we've got seeds from the wild. And, you know, in my
[04:38.570 --> 04:44.650]  opinion, that's not the case. You know, these are land race strains, basically are not necessarily
[04:44.650 --> 04:49.370]  indigenous strains. They're strains that are cultivated in those regions in the inbred lines.
[04:50.570 --> 04:53.130]  What's your take, Aladdin, on the definition of-
[04:54.010 --> 05:01.690]  Right on. I agree with you, man. Because cultivars are not the same as feral varieties. So these
[05:01.690 --> 05:08.250]  land races, they're like strains that have been farmed for a very long time. So they have adapted
[05:08.810 --> 05:14.410]  to a specific environment, but they're not the same as feral varieties. So there's going to be
[05:14.410 --> 05:22.170]  a little less diversity. It's more stable. I wouldn't say as stable as an IBL, but pretty
[05:22.170 --> 05:26.330]  close to it. There's less variation than with feral strains, you know.
[05:28.010 --> 05:34.970]  Yeah. As far as homozygosity, you know, that's what occurs for people that are listening in
[05:34.970 --> 05:40.890]  that aren't familiar with homozygosity or heterozygosity. Something that's homozygous
[05:40.890 --> 05:47.850]  is bred through several generations that basically shows no different phenotype. So like the
[05:48.570 --> 05:57.530]  phenotypical variation is zero in a true inbred line. But the real truth about that is I feel like
[05:57.530 --> 06:01.610]  the only way we can do that is with data-driven breeding. I mean, most of the things that people
[06:01.610 --> 06:10.570]  consider IBLs aren't true 100% IBLs. So these land race varieties, they were cultivated in
[06:10.570 --> 06:14.890]  these different regions around the world and stabilized, and they were selected for different
[06:14.890 --> 06:18.650]  things. If you look in certain places in India, they use them for hash varieties.
[06:20.010 --> 06:26.410]  You know, other places, you know, fiber, things like that. So the big confusion is land race is
[06:26.410 --> 06:30.810]  definitely not feral. And what you guys are working on is you guys are trying to
[06:31.530 --> 06:37.050]  preserve those qualities that you guys find interesting. Correct, Jamal?
[06:38.010 --> 06:48.170]  Yeah, that's exactly correct. You know, some of the traits that I'm searching for,
[06:48.170 --> 06:57.290]  that I'm selecting for are things that are often almost looked down upon in modern cannabis
[06:57.290 --> 07:04.410]  strains. So for example, things that have, you know, a long stretch on them, or like,
[07:04.410 --> 07:11.930]  you know, kind of a thinner bud, maybe somewhat of a different turf profile that's not as necessarily
[07:11.930 --> 07:19.450]  gas fruit, you know, not water fruit. So it's just kind of looking for things that are a little bit
[07:19.450 --> 07:26.250]  slightly different. One of the traits that I really like is that a lot of the, is that some
[07:26.250 --> 07:31.770]  of the strands that I'm working with, you don't need to stake up. So they're a lot more sturdy.
[07:32.410 --> 07:38.250]  And besides not needing to stake up, you also don't need to water them as much. So it takes
[07:38.250 --> 07:42.330]  the amount of labor that the plant needs, it kind of almost like cuts it in half.
[07:43.450 --> 07:50.490]  Nice. So are you doing this with indoor, outdoor, mixed load or combination of all of them?
[07:50.490 --> 07:57.050]  So in general, I'm an outdoor guy. I've grown indoor for almost 20 years, but my heart is
[07:57.050 --> 08:06.170]  really in growing outdoors. In California, we're really blessed to have a lot of warm weather.
[08:06.970 --> 08:10.730]  This year, it's rained a quarter of an inch the whole year.
[08:13.290 --> 08:17.610]  I'd say humidity is almost the bigger factor. But yeah, it's, we're, especially the Bay Area,
[08:17.610 --> 08:22.410]  it's like, we're so blessed with weather. So here, I just cut these down before the show.
[08:24.170 --> 08:28.570]  So here's one of the phenos of the Whaling Valley.
[08:31.690 --> 08:38.890]  And yeah, one of the traits of this one that was just really amazing to me was that
[08:41.290 --> 08:44.170]  you didn't need to stake it and you didn't need to water it that often.
[08:44.810 --> 08:51.130]  And in general, it was probably over fertilized. So it really just takes a small amount of labor to
[08:52.890 --> 08:57.050]  get something nice out of it. And also, what's interesting, I don't know how many of the
[08:57.050 --> 09:02.570]  watchers are from California. We had tons of caterpillars this year. We got decimated by
[09:02.570 --> 09:10.330]  caterpillars. And for some reason, a lot of these older varieties are just not getting hit as hard
[09:10.330 --> 09:17.850]  with the caterpillars. They're not getting hit as hard with the PM. Maybe it's a theory. My theory
[09:17.850 --> 09:26.330]  is that because the buds are a bit looser, the animals, the predators are able to get in there
[09:26.330 --> 09:31.050]  and attack those caterpillars and that they're not able to find like a safe harbor inside of the
[09:31.050 --> 09:39.130]  buds. My other theory is that the dermal layer, like the skin layer of these older land-raised
[09:39.130 --> 09:44.490]  varieties is just thicker. And with that just comes more resistance to pests.
[09:44.490 --> 09:48.650]  Yeah. What do you think terpene profile plays as far as a role?
[09:49.770 --> 09:54.890]  You know, the terpene profiles in these is definitely not as developed, in my opinion.
[09:57.130 --> 10:03.850]  When you smoke, it's almost like a sandalwood. Maybe I get some incense in there. When you
[10:03.850 --> 10:11.930]  smoke them, a lot of people that don't have too much of a discerning palate might just say it
[10:11.930 --> 10:18.410]  tastes like grass. So it's not super strong. But if you mix it with other cannabis, it almost
[10:19.050 --> 10:21.130]  like enhances the other cannabis.
[10:24.170 --> 10:27.290]  Aladdin, what are your thoughts on this?
[10:28.250 --> 10:36.170]  Yeah, I think it really depends on the land-raise you work with. And I agree. Usually it's not
[10:36.730 --> 10:43.770]  very smelly. It's not as pungent as, you know, some like dank modern strains. But as far as
[10:43.770 --> 10:52.010]  the taste, usually it tastes a lot stronger than the smell. So it's probably pretty high in
[10:52.650 --> 10:57.530]  sesquiterpenes. You know, it's pretty low in mono, that's what I'm thinking, and higher in
[10:57.530 --> 11:04.650]  sesquiterpene for the hash cultivars, the hash land-raise, like the ones that come from, well,
[11:04.650 --> 11:12.010]  North India, Afghanistan, Pakistan. You know, these I think was, they were selected for the
[11:12.010 --> 11:18.730]  taste, for the resistance, you know, the heat resistance in that it just like, it doesn't
[11:19.530 --> 11:26.650]  smell very strong when it's growing, when it's fresh. But once it's dry, it will like preserve
[11:26.650 --> 11:33.290]  the terpenes for a long time. Yeah, so some terpenes definitely take away. Yeah, I mean,
[11:33.290 --> 11:40.330]  as far as we're talking about the shelf life, limonene definitely, the higher it is in limonene,
[11:40.330 --> 11:46.250]  the faster the actual plant material deteriorates. And so yeah, some of these terpenes can have
[11:46.250 --> 11:52.490]  negative effects for sure. And then also positive, but I really feel like drug discovery
[11:53.130 --> 11:57.770]  is where we're going to really benefit beyond just the preservation side, but there's
[11:57.770 --> 12:03.210]  a whole world of drug discovery that we're going to get into in the next, you know, five to 10 years,
[12:03.210 --> 12:08.810]  that's going to be seeking out those land-raised varietals and finding unique terpenes, unique
[12:08.810 --> 12:16.890]  cannabinoids in there. So how big of an impact do you guys feel environment and geography makes
[12:16.890 --> 12:25.130]  on the cannabis that you're working as far as expression goes? Aladdin? I think it matters,
[12:25.130 --> 12:31.130]  but it's also the selection of the farmers. So it's a little bit of both. I'm thinking that
[12:31.130 --> 12:36.970]  the plants have been able to adapt to the climate, but the way the farmers grow these plants and
[12:36.970 --> 12:44.170]  select them also has a big impact. For example, in Morocco, well, the land-raised over there,
[12:44.170 --> 12:51.850]  the local land-raised or what's left of it, has been able to adapt to increasingly dry conditions.
[12:51.850 --> 12:59.610]  So in the past, in the reef region of Northern Morocco, it was probably a lot wetter and not as
[12:59.690 --> 13:07.450]  dry as it is today. But because of that, you know, desertification process, the land-raised has been
[13:07.450 --> 13:15.370]  able to adapt and to flower like faster and faster to the point that today it's semi-auto
[13:15.370 --> 13:21.690]  flowering. So the plants will start flowering in June usually and finish in August. So the
[13:21.690 --> 13:28.490]  life cycle doesn't matter anymore. The plants have been able to adapt to these very hot, very dry
[13:28.490 --> 13:35.050]  conditions. And in order for the plants to reproduce and survive, they have to flower earlier
[13:35.050 --> 13:49.200]  before they lack water and die. Excellent. So, Jamal, as far as what's your opinion on expression?
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.920]  I feel like I must come from the other side of it where we'll, you know, we'll source
[13:57.920 --> 14:04.800]  genetics from other places, bring it to California. From my experience, the first year,
[14:04.800 --> 14:13.600]  I'm getting more exotic terpenes than the second year. Definitely this past year, it was super dry.
[14:13.600 --> 14:21.440]  I noticed that with my whaling valley, the buds were pretty thick, were very, very thick for
[14:21.520 --> 14:32.480]  for how sativa they were. You know, I find that a lot of my bud starts tasting very similar because
[14:32.480 --> 14:38.640]  of the environment or because of various gardens that I'm growing in. So I believe that the
[14:38.640 --> 14:45.440]  environment does play a huge role. Yeah, I think phenotype, yeah, as far as phenotypes are concerned,
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.040]  they can be influenced by nutrition and environment. And so depending on what you're
[14:51.040 --> 14:56.160]  feeding the plants, that can bring out specific things, especially growing in soil, using things
[14:56.160 --> 15:04.160]  like guano or, you know, seagull poop or whatever it is, they can have impact. But then, you know,
[15:04.160 --> 15:11.360]  as far as humidity, things like humidity, those kind of environmental variables make huge
[15:11.360 --> 15:18.480]  differences. Just for instance, like OG Kush, you know, if you grow, if it goes in the wrong
[15:18.480 --> 15:25.360]  environment, you can have something that comes out really dry and not greasy. So talk to me a
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.600]  little bit more about preserving land races and what you guys are doing as far as the preservation
[15:31.600 --> 15:37.360]  side. Aladdin, how many cultivars are you working with preserving and, you know, what are your step
[15:37.360 --> 15:46.240]  by step plans? Okay, so the cultivars that we're working with, it's well, what you guys can see on
[15:46.240 --> 15:54.320]  the website. And we're also working on other cultivars like Nigerian cultivar. And well,
[15:54.320 --> 16:02.400]  the major difficulty is to reduce the harm rate, you know, the hermaphroditism to make them more
[16:02.400 --> 16:08.880]  sexually stable. So that takes a while sometimes, because you have to, you know, pollinate the
[16:08.880 --> 16:16.960]  females, but not entirely. So we leave like one bud un-pollinated, so that it's easier to spot
[16:16.960 --> 16:25.520]  the herms. And we do it indoors. So a reproduction run is good to do it indoors, because you will
[16:25.520 --> 16:32.480]  like see the herms a lot more easily. You know, it forces the hermaphrodites to reveal themselves
[16:32.480 --> 16:38.720]  a lot more when it's indoors, because there's more stress, it's not as natural. But because of that,
[16:38.720 --> 16:44.320]  it's easier to stress test the plants. And we only keep the seeds from the females that haven't
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.400]  hermed. And you know, by doing that, well, it's an open pollination. So it takes a lot of like,
[16:50.960 --> 16:57.520]  generations. But after a few generations, you start seeing the harm rate really going down
[16:57.520 --> 17:04.080]  drastically. Excellent. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about that. I really get into it.
[17:04.800 --> 17:11.280]  Because I feel stress testing is such a valuable tool that you can use in lowering intersexual
[17:11.280 --> 17:19.760]  traits. What do you do as far as stress testing your rooms? You lower temperatures, raise humidity,
[17:21.360 --> 17:24.880]  what kind of variables do you adjust for your stress testing?
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.800]  So when you use small containers, it usually forces the plants to show some nanners if they're
[17:32.800 --> 17:39.120]  going to harm. And something else that we do is we like to let the plants go a little longer,
[17:39.120 --> 17:45.280]  you know, at the very end of the life cycle of the plant, it's when you usually see the nanners
[17:45.280 --> 17:50.560]  coming. You know, so what we do is just let the plants go a little longer than what they need.
[17:52.000 --> 17:58.800]  Excellent. So Jamal, let's talk about your preservation steps and what you're doing
[17:58.800 --> 18:04.080]  with land raises. What do you have as far as stuff you'd like to recommend to everybody?
[18:05.200 --> 18:12.160]  Sure. I mean, I would recommend definitely the Wailing Valley is a great
[18:12.800 --> 18:21.920]  land raise strain. Things from Snow High I would recommend are some of the things that I'm diving
[18:21.920 --> 18:30.400]  into this year. Things from Khalifa Genetics, I've definitely had my eye on for years.
[18:31.040 --> 18:38.160]  Sure. How about the steps that you take when you're doing your selections and for stress testing?
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.400]  Oh, yes, yes. Yeah. So for outdoor, our stress testing is a little bit different. I mean,
[18:42.400 --> 18:49.680]  we don't really mess with the lights. Some of the stress testings that we did this year,
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.720]  so just to back up, this year there were huge fires in California.
[18:58.160 --> 19:05.520]  Some of the craziest fires I've ever experienced. And it was super stressful for the whole cannabis
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.800]  community, whether people's properties were burning down or their crops were burning down
[19:10.800 --> 19:15.840]  or the ashes were raining on their crops. So this year, the stress test was really trying to see
[19:15.840 --> 19:23.360]  what genetics could handle having ashes rained on them. There were three days where the sun didn't
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.520]  come out in the middle of the summertime. And so that was three days of zero UV light or very low
[19:29.520 --> 19:35.840]  UV light for our plants. And so for me, the stress test is essentially just observation.
[19:36.400 --> 19:42.640]  So I had a couple of varieties like some lemon tree crosses, I believe some like wedding cake,
[19:43.200 --> 19:48.720]  a whole bunch of like hype stuff that did not do well this year. The terpene profiles didn't
[19:48.720 --> 19:58.880]  come out right. Some of the plants just dried up and died. A lot of my older cultivars did fine.
[19:59.840 --> 20:04.880]  They really were able to kind of winter the storm. Perhaps it was because they flowered
[20:05.520 --> 20:11.680]  a month later on, but some of the things that were still in flower were able to weather that storm.
[20:11.680 --> 20:18.240]  So that was the stress test for this year were the fires, the heat waves and the crazy smoke.
[20:18.800 --> 20:25.120]  And essentially the things that died and were not able to survive, we nixed and didn't breathe
[20:25.120 --> 20:29.760]  with those. And the things that survived, those were the ones that we're moving forward with.
[20:32.000 --> 20:38.400]  Excellent. So Aladdin, so let's say someone buys some seeds from you. How many, and then
[20:38.400 --> 20:45.200]  we want to buy a land race variety. How many seeds do you suggest them purchasing to find a winner?
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.680]  50 seeds, 10 seeds? Well, yeah, it depends on the strain.
[20:53.840 --> 21:00.000]  There are some land races that are a lot more, that are way more stable,
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.720]  both sexually and genetically, and others that will show a lot more variation.
[21:05.520 --> 21:13.280]  So for example, with a strain like the Nigerian, all the plants have a similar terp profile.
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.720]  But with other strains, like the one from Northern India that we have,
[21:19.280 --> 21:27.760]  Rasor, it's a strain from the mountains in the Himalayas. And over there,
[21:28.480 --> 21:34.320]  the amount of diversity is incredible. And it's probably because there's a lot of different farms
[21:35.200 --> 21:44.240]  close by. And there's also a lot of feral varieties growing nearby. So the amount of,
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.840]  like the gene pool is extremely wide, and you can find a lot of different phenotypes.
[21:49.840 --> 21:55.040]  So it really depends. But it's impossible to say if you get a 10 pack, you'll find a keeper for
[21:55.040 --> 22:03.120]  sure. It depends on the strain you work with, and it depends on many things. But what people can do
[22:03.120 --> 22:09.360]  if they don't have, for example, a lot of money and cannot like buy 50 or 100 seeds, they can just
[22:09.360 --> 22:15.440]  buy, you know, like maybe one or two packs, and then do an open pollination. And then they'll find
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.000]  a lot more, you know, expressions in the next generation among the offspring.
[22:22.960 --> 22:27.440]  Great tip. Yeah, that's really good. Jamal, what's your opinion on that?
[22:28.320 --> 22:33.840]  Gosh, yeah, it totally depends on what you're looking for. You know, certain terp profiles
[22:33.840 --> 22:41.600]  are super easy and common to find others, you know, you need to sprout hundreds of seeds to find.
[22:41.600 --> 22:47.120]  So it totally depends on what you're looking for. I would also recommend, you know, if you're
[22:47.120 --> 22:52.880]  purchasing a pack of seeds, always do a seed expansion of it. And you can, you know, do both
[22:52.880 --> 23:01.040]  things at once. So you can pheno hunt through your 10 pack, as well as do your you know, your F2 of
[23:01.040 --> 23:05.600]  your of your packs at the same time. So then you can dig through it in the future. And that's
[23:05.600 --> 23:10.240]  actually kind of one of the really cool things about our collective is that, you know, is that
[23:10.240 --> 23:17.760]  we do things like pop one pack of seeds, and then have multiple people do different projects with
[23:17.760 --> 23:22.560]  that same 10 pack of seeds. And you can see it in, you know, multiple directions where it goes.
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.720]  Excellent. So yeah, it really depends on what you're looking for. Because I mean,
[23:28.720 --> 23:34.160]  technically, if it was a true IBL, each one of the seeds you pop, whether it's male or female,
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.320]  is going to have the same genetics. So you wouldn't need more than a 10 pack. But we're
[23:38.320 --> 23:44.800]  talking about land race, not true IBLs. Yeah, and, you know, which, which I think is more fun
[23:44.800 --> 23:49.680]  and interesting. Anyway, I mean, it's cool, especially you're talking about true IBLs have
[23:49.680 --> 23:54.480]  their benefit, but they also don't have that hybrid vigor that you get from from hybridized
[23:54.480 --> 24:01.680]  seeds. And they're more susceptible, typically. So where do you guys think cannabis originated?
[24:02.640 --> 24:07.120]  You know, if we go all the way back, I think there's a lot of theories on that.
[24:08.960 --> 24:16.640]  Aladdin, what's your opinion? I'm thinking, probably Kazakhstan, China, something like that.
[24:17.600 --> 24:22.640]  Yeah, but it's really hard to tell. It's pretty much well, it's pretty much impossible for now.
[24:22.640 --> 24:26.480]  So that's what that's just a guess. You know, I'm guessing somewhere around there.
[24:28.240 --> 24:33.120]  Jamal, what are your thoughts? Yeah, I would definitely agree somewhere around that region.
[24:35.600 --> 24:42.400]  Gosh, I saw this. I heard this person talk about this really interesting. It's a really interesting
[24:42.400 --> 24:51.440]  podcast regarding it was a horse people from, from like the Mongolian area that used cannabis
[24:51.440 --> 25:01.280]  as the first rope to catch horses. And they also used the they also would do they would also smoke
[25:01.280 --> 25:06.800]  as well. So that would be my guess would be around that area. And it's some sort of people that rode
[25:06.800 --> 25:14.400]  on horses. Yeah, I mean, it could have been Pangea when you know, it's like cannabis, we could have
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.960]  evolved side by side with cannabis for hundreds of thousands of years. I think where there's just
[25:18.960 --> 25:26.720]  not enough science behind it now to know exactly. You know, if we truly have one continent that
[25:26.720 --> 25:35.600]  expanded out, you know, that's that's possible, too. So as far as I got some other interesting
[25:35.600 --> 25:43.120]  questions, what do you guys think the cannabis market will look like in 10 years? Jamal, you
[25:43.120 --> 25:49.840]  want to go first? I'm sorry, can you repeat the question again? So 10 years from now, what do you
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.120]  what do you think the cannabis market now with everything going recreational, medical, especially
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.200]  in the United States, and you know, this is it's going to be all over the world. How do you
[26:00.080 --> 26:06.640]  the cannabis market in 10 years? I mean, I can tell you how I how I hope it will be. Sure.
[26:06.960 --> 26:14.160]  Um, you know, I really hope that there will be a variety of, of different cultivars in the market.
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.760]  I do envision that most of the countries of the world will, will have legal farm cannabis. And
[26:21.760 --> 26:28.080]  with that, you know, there will be a necessity for people right now to preserve the land race
[26:28.080 --> 26:35.360]  varieties. I hope that you know that we live in a world where the majority of cannabis has grown
[26:35.360 --> 26:42.800]  outdoors. And that similar to, you know, a vegetable seed company, that there's the mainstream
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.600]  seed companies, there's the heirloom seed companies, there's the hybrid seed companies,
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.120]  there's the dwarf tree seed companies, that that cannabis will be the same way.
[26:54.640 --> 26:58.000]  That's, that's really what I'd like to see. Aladdin, what are your thoughts?
[26:58.400 --> 27:06.160]  Jamal, I think that the future of cannabis is outdoors. Because it honestly, it makes no sense
[27:06.160 --> 27:13.360]  to grow plants under like 1000s of watts of lamps and using ACs and all that, you know, it's not
[27:13.360 --> 27:20.080]  cost effective. And if it were legal worldwide, we would probably not have all these, you know,
[27:20.080 --> 27:26.560]  indoor labs that we have today. That's what I'm thinking. Like for breeding, it's not legal.
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.000]  For breeding, it's good to do it indoors for stress testing, to make sure that there's no
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.760]  pollen contamination. But yeah, the cannabis market in the future, I think it's going to be
[27:38.400 --> 27:45.440]  outdoor weed mostly. And like Jamal said, there's going to be more and more connoisseurs looking for
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.160]  something unique. So the need for land race preservation is going to be higher and higher,
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.040]  people are going to want to preserve these old cults of art because they're going to want to
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.080]  have access to more diversity. Yeah, I would, I would kind of add,
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.840]  like, for example, apples, you know, you go to the store and you have the regular green apples,
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.920]  red apples, they're all delicious. But I lived in Washington for a while. And Washington has some of
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.360]  the most amazing apples on the planet. And so there's like 20 different apples and you try
[28:19.360 --> 28:24.320]  there's like little one or the one that has a little buff to it or the one that tastes like
[28:24.320 --> 28:28.720]  this or the one that tastes like that. And once you taste those and you're able to appreciate
[28:29.520 --> 28:34.880]  these differences of, you know, cultivars and a lot of these, you know, apples are not as
[28:34.880 --> 28:41.600]  commercially viable, similar to, you know, some of these heirloom and land race strains that,
[28:41.600 --> 28:46.720]  you know, most people may not really get it and get why we're geeking out over these things. But
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.520]  the people who get it really do get it. And when you get a chance to grow these strains and you
[28:51.520 --> 28:57.920]  are able to visually see it and you can see the buds, you really are able to derive a lot of joy
[28:57.920 --> 29:03.280]  out of that. I would say it's kind of similar to people who collect like certain types of flowers
[29:03.280 --> 29:09.360]  that have various variegations, their various flower colors to them. You know, a lot of these
[29:09.360 --> 29:11.120]  varieties are the same way.
[29:11.520 --> 29:18.000]  Yeah. Do you guys see the world as far as more home growers cultivating in their backyards or
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.840]  less cultivating in their backyards, especially like for Spain, for instance? I know in Barcelona
[29:23.840 --> 29:30.800]  you see people growing auto flowers in their windows in the city. And I'm sure there's people,
[29:31.360 --> 29:36.160]  do you guys see that growing or do you see more of the commercial side taking over? I mean,
[29:36.480 --> 29:39.760]  more of the commercial side taking over. I mean, I would obviously, we'd love to see
[29:40.320 --> 29:45.920]  more of the home growers growing, but what do you guys see as far as commercial cannabis taking over?
[29:49.750 --> 29:51.110]  Aladdin, do you want to jump on that one?
[29:52.790 --> 29:59.110]  Okay, sure. Well, that's a good question. There's definitely going to be big corporations,
[29:59.110 --> 30:04.550]  you know, taking over the market, but are they going to take over the whole market or is it just
[30:04.550 --> 30:11.030]  going to be, you know, the mitts, you know, like for like high, you know, high-end bods and
[30:11.030 --> 30:16.950]  connoisseur weed, is it going to be the big, like these big corporations are going to be like
[30:16.950 --> 30:23.030]  selling that or is it going to be like craft, you know, craft growers and craft breeders
[30:23.910 --> 30:30.230]  offering these, you know, special strains and high quality flowers? I think it's possible that
[30:30.230 --> 30:36.310]  we're going to have the same thing as we have today with beer, with, you know, craft beer and
[30:36.310 --> 30:43.830]  commercial beer. Yeah. So I got a question for you about Dynafem. I don't know if you got your,
[30:43.830 --> 30:47.430]  your Jamal, I'm sure Aladdin is probably familiar with Dynafem and what's happened with them in the
[30:47.430 --> 30:54.310]  last month. Them being the biggest, maybe the biggest seed company in the world or seed distributor
[30:54.310 --> 31:01.990]  in the world with several brands under them. And they recently got busted by, you know,
[31:01.990 --> 31:07.750]  the government in Spain and several other entities. How's the temperament around
[31:08.950 --> 31:18.840]  seeds and cannabis in Spain right now? Yeah. So a lot of, you know, a lot of other breeders
[31:18.840 --> 31:27.720]  got scared of it. We don't know exactly why it happened. And I mean, it's, it's very surprising
[31:27.720 --> 31:33.640]  because it's the biggest, one of the biggest, you know, seed companies in Europe and yeah, it's,
[31:33.640 --> 31:39.080]  it's very sad what's going on right now. And, you know, in the United States, you see more and more
[31:39.080 --> 31:44.200]  countries, I mean, states legalizing and in other countries throughout the world, you see more and
[31:44.200 --> 31:50.600]  more countries legalizing as well. And I feel like Europe is way behind probably 10, 12 years
[31:50.600 --> 31:57.400]  behind and I hope it's going to catch up, but I don't know. Yeah. I think there's a lot of laws
[31:57.400 --> 32:01.960]  that have to change for everything to catch up. And I mean, I think it's becoming, obviously it's
[32:01.960 --> 32:06.760]  becoming more accepted if you just look at the last election, how many states actually voted for
[32:06.760 --> 32:12.520]  recreational cannabis. But I mean, it's still a schedule one drug here in the United States, but
[32:12.520 --> 32:18.360]  the seeds obviously have no THC. And so under the, you know, the hemp bill that was passed,
[32:18.360 --> 32:25.480]  anything below 0.3% is considered hemp. So that's, that's our saving grace right now in the United
[32:25.480 --> 32:32.920]  States. Jamal, what's your take? Yeah. You know, like it seems almost like, like kind of a seed
[32:32.920 --> 32:38.360]  renaissance in a way now to where, you know, the new thing is to, you know, to open up a seed
[32:38.360 --> 32:44.760]  company and the prices are becoming low enough that people can just grow weed just for the love
[32:44.760 --> 32:53.960]  of growing weed, which, which I'm very thankful for. I guess living in the bubble of the Bay Area
[32:53.960 --> 32:59.000]  in California, like, you know, everybody grows weed around here. I, you know, I can see people's
[32:59.000 --> 33:07.000]  crops around the corner from my house over their fence. So, you know, growing cannabis isn't really
[33:07.080 --> 33:14.440]  too big of a deal in these areas. I hope that it becomes a thing that's very common and,
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.880]  you know, there's room for everybody. If you want to be, you know, be in a huge garden and,
[33:19.880 --> 33:23.960]  you know, do that thing, go for it. And if you want to grow your own stuff and work with your
[33:23.960 --> 33:29.960]  homies and, you know, crop out in the backyard or in your, your little grow tent or in your garage,
[33:29.960 --> 33:36.680]  I'm all for that as well. Excellent. Yeah. Let's get into some breeding tips that you
[33:36.680 --> 33:42.120]  guys have. I know everybody does. There's so many ways to do it. There's a million different
[33:42.120 --> 33:47.080]  ways to skin a cat and breeding is no exception. You know, I mean, anybody can make seeds.
[33:47.720 --> 33:52.440]  All you need is a male plant or a female plant and reverse it to create pollen and put that on a
[33:52.440 --> 33:59.560]  plant. How do you guys work with actually putting the pollen on? Do you guys intermingle plants?
[33:59.560 --> 34:04.360]  Do you collect pollen and put it on? What are your suggestions for that, Aladdin?
[34:06.760 --> 34:12.120]  Preservation or breeding? Just breeding, like creating new strains or preserving land reces?
[34:12.680 --> 34:17.240]  Either way, as far as if you are breeding or preserving, do you collect pollen and save
[34:17.240 --> 34:23.320]  pollen or that pollen or are you intermingling two plants together and letting that occur naturally?
[34:23.320 --> 34:30.360]  Okay. So, I always collect the pollen. I like to use it fresh because you get the best viability.
[34:31.000 --> 34:37.800]  I always like to collect the pollen, whether it's for preservation or breeding. For preservation,
[34:38.360 --> 34:44.840]  for example, what we like to do is collect the pollen on a big table, pollen from a lot of
[34:44.840 --> 34:54.840]  different males. Then you collect it and then you mix it. By mixing it, it allows the diversity to
[34:54.840 --> 35:02.760]  still exist. You just use that pollen that contains a lot of different genes from a lot
[35:02.760 --> 35:11.880]  of different males and you pollinate females so that you will keep the gene pool alive for most
[35:11.880 --> 35:18.440]  of it. For breeding, it's pretty much the same thing except that we use stable lines. So, we're
[35:18.440 --> 35:24.040]  only going to use one female and one male or one female and one female if it's feminized.
[35:25.800 --> 35:28.520]  You're working with a lot of feminized genetics as well, correct?
[35:29.880 --> 35:37.000]  A little bit. A little bit. We like to do both. But, I mean, fantasies have a bad rep because of
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.080]  the way it used to be done back in the day with hermaphrodites. Old school breeders, some of them
[35:45.080 --> 35:51.320]  would use slightly hermaphroditic plants and they would collect the pollen at the end of the
[35:51.320 --> 35:59.560]  flowering cycle and use that herm pollen to make them seeds. But these seeds used to give you a lot
[35:59.560 --> 36:05.800]  more hermaphrodites. Whereas, if you stress test two different females and you stress test them
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.240]  and you make sure that they're not going to harm and that they're very sexually stable, then if you
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.120]  reverse one of these plants chemically and make feminized seeds, it's not going to be the same
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.640]  thing at all. It's going to be a lot more sexually stable. Yeah, I think there's a lot of confusion
[36:21.640 --> 36:27.160]  on that. That's another thing that people are confused about is the sexual stability. And
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.640]  that's actually they can either be bred in or out of plant. So, if you keep plants together and
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.160]  they both have that trait, you're going to have a progeny, the offspring is going to have
[36:39.160 --> 36:45.800]  those intersexual traits. Now, if you're working with more intersexually stable plants,
[36:46.040 --> 36:51.800]  don't have the hermaphroditic tendencies, and you reverse the sex of one to make seeds and put that
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.160]  pollen on another plant, you're not going to have, I'm a big advocate for feminized seeds. And I was
[36:57.160 --> 37:04.600]  very against it 15 years ago. But as far as an ag solution, it's the only way to go. As far as if
[37:04.600 --> 37:08.920]  you're selling seeds for somebody who's planting an acre. But, you know, these are things that can
[37:08.920 --> 37:14.360]  be bred in or bred out. And it's things like stress testing that are big game changers with
[37:14.360 --> 37:20.040]  making the seeds. Making sure that, you know, as far as that trait is concerned, that it's not
[37:20.040 --> 37:26.680]  expressing or it's expressing minimally and you can breed that out over generations. Jamal, what's
[37:26.680 --> 37:32.440]  your take on feminized seeds? Do you work with feminized seeds? And, you know, I don't really
[37:32.440 --> 37:39.960]  work with them and I seeds currently. I'm first, you know, starting my path breeding with males
[37:39.960 --> 37:45.960]  and females. You know, I definitely am observing that certain varieties, I think the traits I'm
[37:45.960 --> 37:54.200]  looking for would probably be passed on easier with feminized seeds. You know, or with selfing
[37:54.200 --> 38:00.680]  of the plants. But, you know, as of right now, I'm just starting with males and females.
[38:02.520 --> 38:07.800]  I actually have a kind of a cool trick that I'd love to share just regarding breeding and
[38:08.200 --> 38:15.960]  something that we're doing and that I recently discovered, which is what we like to do. So,
[38:16.920 --> 38:20.920]  as a club, we decided, we were trying to figure out what was the difference between
[38:22.520 --> 38:29.800]  us being breeders and us being pollen chuckers. And what I came up with, what we came up with was
[38:30.520 --> 38:36.760]  that you first inevitably would be a chuck, you at first inevitably would be chucking, which is,
[38:36.760 --> 38:41.560]  you know, kind of shooting in the dark. And then as you learn more about the genetics,
[38:41.560 --> 38:50.120]  you then became to breed it more. And so, what we kind of decided was that before we would breed
[38:50.120 --> 38:55.000]  with something, we would first grow it. So, we would know what to expect, what, you know,
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.720]  what the traits were, what the pros and cons were of it. And then we came to the fact of,
[39:01.720 --> 39:12.440]  okay, with your male, how do you grow your male? And I realized that then we would do a spring crop
[39:13.160 --> 39:20.840]  and that's from March to May. And so, what we're doing now is we're doing our spring crop of males.
[39:21.640 --> 39:27.000]  And so, then we're, that's how we're selecting our males is growing throughout their whole season.
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.400]  It's spring. So, they, you know, they flower, they don't flower completely, but it's very close.
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.480]  And we're able to pick the various phenotypes that we want to select for.
[39:38.920 --> 39:42.680]  Some of those plants do end up having hermaphroditic traits or other things that we want
[39:43.640 --> 39:50.920]  to X out of there. So, that's how we're able to, you know, to kind of grow our males and then
[39:50.920 --> 39:58.680]  combine them with our females. Yeah. So, here's another point I want to touch on is phenotype
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.960]  can be expressed differently through sexual maturity. If you take a clone off a plant,
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.080]  you can get a different expression than actually the original seed run. You know,
[40:09.080 --> 40:12.840]  obviously the branching is going to be different. The plants branch more symmetrically.
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.720]  If we're talking about a seed run or something that's been through tissue culture, you get
[40:17.720 --> 40:24.040]  symmetrical branching, but also the phenotype can actually change between the second and third
[40:24.040 --> 40:29.160]  generation attributed to sexual maturity. Aladdin, what's your, what are your thoughts on
[40:29.720 --> 40:37.800]  sexual maturity and selections? Yeah. Yeah. It's totally different when the plant is sexually
[40:37.800 --> 40:42.760]  mature because it's not going to stretch as much in the beginning of the flowering cycle.
[40:43.400 --> 40:49.000]  If the plant is not sexually mature, it will, well, stretch a lot more. It will end up being a lot,
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.280]  a lot taller and it will also take a little bit longer to flower.
[40:56.440 --> 41:02.040]  I found that you get better terpene profiles occasionally from the second or third time. You
[41:02.600 --> 41:07.160]  I keep on going back to Sticky Farms and the Pluto. It took them three or four
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.200]  generations of clones before they actually selected the Pluto that they wanted to keep as
[41:12.200 --> 41:19.800]  the winner. I can't stress it enough, but it takes time. And sometimes the one you think that's the
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.600]  winner in the first round, you grow it again and it's not going to necessarily be your winner.
[41:25.560 --> 41:31.800]  I totally agree with that. And also somebody taught me, are you selecting for a seed or for
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.640]  a clone? And I had never really thought of that. And so kind of now the way that we breed
[41:37.640 --> 41:44.360]  is really more for seed. If it comes out a winner in the seed form, then we're keeping it. But that's
[41:44.360 --> 41:51.240]  kind of what we transitioned to breeding for, or what I transitioned to breed for as an outdoor
[41:52.200 --> 41:56.600]  guy. I would assume most of the indoor people would be in the opposite direction, would really
[41:56.600 --> 42:04.840]  be breeding for indoor or for breeding for clone. As opposed to breeding for progeny within the
[42:04.840 --> 42:16.920]  seeds. Correct. Yeah. Excellent. So we discussed a little bit about pollen. It's the question that
[42:16.920 --> 42:21.320]  everybody asks on every one of these shows about breeders. How do you guys select your males?
[42:24.550 --> 42:32.080]  Aladdin, you want to start with that? Yeah. Can you guys hear me?
[42:34.240 --> 42:40.560]  Little muffled. Yeah. Sorry, my computer. I'm sorry. No, there's a blip.
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.320]  We'll start with Jamal. So how do you select your male? I think a lot of people
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.560]  love the stem rub. I love stem rub, but what's your thoughts?
[42:54.240 --> 43:01.200]  I really like resinous males. I'm kind of in love with flowering them all the way out,
[43:01.200 --> 43:08.400]  March 15th to May 15th, taking clones of them before they flower. And then I can go through
[43:08.400 --> 43:13.360]  all of them, not at the stem rub, not at week four, but at week seven or eight,
[43:13.360 --> 43:20.560]  and really look at how they finish, the spacing in between the nodes. I've been on a kick of
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.840]  wanting spacing in between the nodes because we get a lot of caterpillars where I live. And
[43:26.560 --> 43:33.120]  when the caterpillar comes in, if it's one long bud, the whole bud ends up rotting. But if there's
[43:34.400 --> 43:40.320]  bud with a space of stem in between, maybe one little bud will rot, but it's not going to spread
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.280]  to the whole thing. And usually the caterpillars will end up picking your nicest colas. So your
[43:45.280 --> 43:54.080]  tallest ones, either the whole thing will rot or just a little piece. So it's almost counterintuitively,
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.360]  I'll go for the opposite things for outdoor males. I would go for my indoor male.
[44:00.080 --> 44:07.520]  So of course, frost in the end, some nice color. Sure. Good structure. How about size compared to
[44:07.520 --> 44:13.520]  your females? You pick ones that are slightly taller. I know some people like short squatty
[44:13.520 --> 44:18.640]  males. I guess it's depending on the variety too. But for me personally, when I try to match a male
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.280]  up to a female, if I'm working on inbreeding something, I'm looking for something that's
[44:23.280 --> 44:31.040]  slightly taller, that has a similar stem rub, similar structure, leaves look similar.
[44:32.000 --> 44:39.200]  What are your thoughts on that? It depends on what I'm looking for. Let's say if I'm trying to
[44:40.880 --> 44:46.720]  back cross my lemon tree, I'm going to be looking for a male that looks as similar to the female as
[44:46.720 --> 44:54.160]  possible. Whatever improvements I would seek upon the female, those would be the characteristics I
[44:54.160 --> 45:01.920]  would most likely be looking for in the male. Another issue is just having enough males to pick
[45:01.920 --> 45:08.720]  from. Because often you get kind of stuck with whatever males you have and not whatever males
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.360]  you'd like to pick from. I also like males that have the shoulders. Have you ever seen that? To
[45:13.360 --> 45:19.440]  where it's almost like their arms are out like this and there's like a muscle right here? Like
[45:19.440 --> 45:28.000]  a little knot or something? I really like those guys. Definitely. How many males do you work with?
[45:29.040 --> 45:33.040]  If you're working on a project and you're going to narrow it down to one, do you work with 50 in
[45:33.040 --> 45:41.280]  the beginning and narrow it down? Or do you 25? What's your magic number? It totally depends on
[45:41.280 --> 45:48.000]  the space. I'd say the smallest number is about 20 males is what we'll start with.
[45:49.520 --> 45:57.280]  It totally just depends on the space and the timing. All of this is
[45:57.280 --> 46:02.720]  stuff that I'm learning. A lot of times the males end up going before the females.
[46:03.280 --> 46:10.160]  Of course. So you kind of have to time it properly. With our next project, we're going to be
[46:10.160 --> 46:16.400]  doing about 50 of each variety and then narrowing it down to 20. When I do my F1s, I've been lately
[46:16.400 --> 46:22.560]  trying to do three or four males. So I try to not, for my F1 crosses, I try to use when I'm
[46:22.560 --> 46:29.040]  actually doing the pollination, trying to select more males than less males. I found I really
[46:29.040 --> 46:35.520]  like the results. I know me and you had been talking before about then when you get to your F2,
[46:35.520 --> 46:45.040]  of course, narrowing it down to one. Yeah. I'm big on selecting. I narrow it down from
[46:45.680 --> 46:53.520]  anywhere from 50 to 100 down to three typically that represent different structure, terpenes,
[46:53.520 --> 46:58.640]  different things that I would, desirable traits in males, just because you get three times the
[46:58.640 --> 47:05.120]  amount of genetic diversity. So that's with those F1s. I'm constantly using three different males
[47:05.120 --> 47:12.720]  if I'm making an F1 where I have the opportunity to use several donors, whether it's feminized or
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.720]  regular, just because the amount of genetic diversity. And I feel like people are really
[47:16.720 --> 47:22.800]  looking, if you're buying seeds for those F1s, a lot of people are looking for that diversity.
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.760]  Now, if I'm selling it to, making seeds for a big company, that's going to buy 10 acres worth of
[47:27.760 --> 47:34.000]  seed, I obviously wouldn't want to do that. I want to use one donor, one receiver. So there's hybrid
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.040]  vigor, but less phenotypical variation. Aladdin, have you caught any of that that we've been
[47:39.040 --> 47:51.800]  talking about? Oh, I think he's muted. I think you got to pick an audio source or try talking again.
[47:59.690 --> 48:07.370]  But while he's doing it, yes, there were lots of... Someone asked a while ago, how you guys,
[48:07.690 --> 48:15.450]  like how many rounds, like in terms of breeding out Herme tendencies?
[48:17.770 --> 48:22.650]  I would say that, you know, it's like you can get it within three or four generations,
[48:22.650 --> 48:28.730]  you can really knock it down. If it's something that's minimal, but you can get it within four
[48:28.730 --> 48:35.450]  generations, I've seen it go down to like one in 5,000 within four generations, with it being
[48:35.770 --> 48:43.210]  somewhere around like one in 1,000. And that's just through the selection process. And I mean,
[48:43.210 --> 48:48.170]  those are ideal circumstances when you're breeding. And that's with autoflowers that I've
[48:48.170 --> 48:53.370]  seen that working with my buddy, Nick, it's like the stuff, if you're really selecting for stuff
[48:53.370 --> 48:58.810]  that's stable, Alex already said five generations. And I would agree that four to five generations
[48:59.770 --> 49:06.010]  is ideal. More obviously is better. Aladdin, do we get you back?
[49:11.140 --> 49:15.060]  All right, I'll troubleshoot with him. And you guys keep going.
[49:15.780 --> 49:22.420]  Sure. So we've talked about selecting males. Let's talk about a little bit about the females.
[49:24.020 --> 49:28.180]  What are those? I think there's a handful of traits people look for in every variety. What
[49:28.260 --> 49:35.860]  would those traits be for you, Jamal? I mean, I try to, the number one trait has got to be
[49:35.860 --> 49:44.260]  smokability. Right now I have 20 different varieties in my cupboard, which is the one that
[49:44.260 --> 49:49.540]  I want to choose to smoke? Which is the one that I finished smoking first? Which is the one that
[49:49.540 --> 49:56.580]  all the homies want to smoke? So that's really the best, the most important trait. It's really
[49:56.580 --> 50:03.700]  easy for us to get hypnotized by how the plant looks or how it smells. But for me, I'm really
[50:03.700 --> 50:11.220]  just trying to breed for a terpene profile that people say flips my switch. It gets you high in
[50:11.220 --> 50:17.380]  the way that you want to be. It's your desert island cannabis. If that's the only one that you
[50:17.380 --> 50:23.940]  could have, that's the one. Those are really the traits that I'm looking for. So it may have to do
[50:23.940 --> 50:33.620]  with my particular chemical makeup that goes with cannabis. Besides that, I love fruit flavors. I
[50:33.620 --> 50:42.740]  love lemon. I love cherry. Any fruit flavor is great. Anything that has any kind of unique flavor
[50:42.740 --> 50:50.580]  I really like. I like varieties that do well outdoors. I'm really into varieties that will
[50:51.220 --> 50:54.580]  pass where it's like you can't tell if it's indoor or outdoor.
[50:55.220 --> 51:01.300]  Yeah. What are some of the traits as far as structure, inter-nodal spacing?
[51:01.300 --> 51:06.660]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. The same thing as the males, I'm really into those plants
[51:06.660 --> 51:10.100]  that have spacing in between the nodes. When I was early-
[51:10.100 --> 51:12.180]  I'm more into the narrow leaf varieties.
[51:12.740 --> 51:20.980]  Narrow leaf varieties or even indica drug types that just have a little bit more space,
[51:27.140 --> 51:34.180]  a little thinner bud structure. I find that they just have a lot more pest resistance in the Bay
[51:34.180 --> 51:40.660]  Area. Yeah. If you're only growing a couple of plants, I got a great tip. You can basically make
[51:40.740 --> 51:47.060]  a shade cloth that goes over your plants at night. It'll prevent the actual moths from going in to
[51:47.060 --> 51:53.700]  create those caterpillars. It's relatively inexpensive. You can build a frame for each
[51:53.700 --> 52:01.060]  plant or you can build a frame for your canopy. You put that shade cloth over before it goes dark,
[52:01.060 --> 52:03.940]  and then you're actually going to prevent those caterpillars from coming in.
[52:04.900 --> 52:11.300]  Caterpillars, they're a nightmare. I've actually physically cried from losing 25% of my crop when
[52:11.300 --> 52:17.220]  I had 25 plants in the backyard. My wife and I had to wake up every morning at 6 a.m. trying
[52:17.220 --> 52:21.460]  to pick out the caterpillars, and they just decimated our plants. I had to cut everything
[52:21.460 --> 52:27.300]  early. Ever since then, we've been working on solutions. I feel like covering your plants,
[52:27.940 --> 52:33.460]  they don't affect all plants, but the easiest way, the easiest solution, there's Monterey BT,
[52:33.540 --> 52:38.900]  there's other things, parasitic wasps can be used, but the true solution is actually covering
[52:38.900 --> 52:44.580]  your canopy if you can afford to do it. Interesting. Another thing is there's also a lot of
[52:47.220 --> 52:52.260]  slimes, the marine layer will come in and they'll get bud rot. What I've noticed is that a lot of
[52:52.260 --> 53:00.580]  the indoor type strain varieties, they'll get really big and fluffed out before the frost comes,
[53:01.460 --> 53:07.620]  and so are the trichomes. When the trichomes come, it seems like the trichomes bring a level of
[53:08.420 --> 53:15.860]  pest resistance, mildew resistance to the buds, but when they first puff out, it's mainly just
[53:15.860 --> 53:23.780]  plant material. A lot of those ones are ending up getting bud rot. That's another reason why I've
[53:23.780 --> 53:30.260]  been leaning towards those thinner varieties more in the future. What it comes down to is
[53:30.260 --> 53:36.820]  we buck down all of our plants and we check our different buckets to see how much bud is in each
[53:36.820 --> 53:41.060]  one. A lot of them we end up throwing out damn near half of the container just because it's all
[53:41.060 --> 53:47.060]  rotting. Do we have Aladdin back yet, Peter, or are we still waiting on Aladdin?
[53:50.820 --> 53:58.100]  I've been troubleshooting with him. He probably just restarted his computer again, so carry on.
[53:58.900 --> 54:02.660]  Excellent. What are some traits that you look for, James, in the outdoor plants?
[54:03.780 --> 54:10.100]  Well, indoor-outdoor plants, I'm looking for vigor, structure. Obviously, my first thing is
[54:10.100 --> 54:15.220]  always terpene profile because I feel like other things can be bred in. Terpene profile is the
[54:15.220 --> 54:22.580]  hardest thing to capture. You can have stuff like Tropicana cookies that has terrible structure,
[54:22.580 --> 54:29.860]  but it has amazing flavor and taste. Through breeding, you can improve the other traits
[54:29.860 --> 54:34.980]  while trying to maintain those terpene profiles. They can be very elusive. OG Kush,
[54:36.100 --> 54:39.380]  I go back to OG Kush just because it's a great example of something that
[54:41.220 --> 54:46.740]  you can work with, but they didn't have seeds of it for years. There was OG Kush back in the 90s
[54:46.820 --> 54:54.100]  and the early 2000s. There wasn't OG Kush seeds until 2015 that were any good, maybe 16.
[54:55.700 --> 54:59.780]  There was some gas—the stuff in Europe, they had OG Kush seeds that were terrible.
[55:00.580 --> 55:04.660]  There's a lot of flaws that went through that with the breeding process, but that's why I think
[55:04.660 --> 55:10.820]  terpene is the most important thing to go for. Bag of peel is important, too, the look of it.
[55:11.780 --> 55:19.060]  But terpene profile, vigor, pest resistance, those things are all super important. Nodal
[55:19.060 --> 55:22.740]  spacing is important, but it's really depending on what you're trying to breed. If you're trying
[55:22.740 --> 55:28.660]  to breed something that's more of that narrow leaf variety, then you want something that's
[55:28.660 --> 55:35.300]  going to have more. If you want something tighter, you're going to have to breed for that as well.
[55:35.300 --> 55:39.380]  It's going to have less of a node spacing, but it really depends on geography. Where are you
[55:39.380 --> 55:45.140]  trying to breed—where are you trying to grow the seeds that you're breeding? Geographically,
[55:45.780 --> 55:50.820]  if you're going down to anywhere near the equator, you have to have that open bud structure. I worked
[55:50.820 --> 55:56.500]  down in the Caribbean and it's essential. You can't take a traditional OG Kush plant,
[55:56.500 --> 56:00.500]  you couldn't take a clone down there and expect to be super successful with it because it has
[56:00.500 --> 56:07.300]  such a closed bud structure. The beauty of the open bud structure in the equatorial and tropical
[56:07.300 --> 56:13.460]  varieties is they let moisture in and out. That moisture comes in and then it goes out,
[56:13.460 --> 56:18.900]  and you don't develop powdery mildew, botrytis. Those things, they don't affect plants like that,
[56:18.900 --> 56:24.900]  whereas something like OG Kush, you need a much drier region than you would the other ones.
[56:26.260 --> 56:30.580]  There's so many things like that. My suggestion is if you're going to go to those regions
[56:30.580 --> 56:34.980]  and you want to grow those varieties, whether it is—you can grow any variety anywhere,
[56:34.980 --> 56:40.980]  but it's not necessarily going to be successful. What you have to do is find either land race or
[56:40.980 --> 56:47.540]  stuff that's acclimated in those regions, and you have to basically cross and breed with those
[56:47.540 --> 56:54.260]  varieties and then select first for your terpene profile and then for your structure and vigor
[56:54.260 --> 57:02.260]  and other things. It can be challenging. I think in some regards it's straightforward. You breed
[57:02.260 --> 57:06.980]  for region and terpene profile are those two important things that you need to look out for,
[57:07.540 --> 57:13.620]  and you can be successful anywhere. It just takes time. Someone asked, what strands have open bud
[57:13.620 --> 57:18.580]  structures? If you look at any of the hazes, if you're in the U.S., you probably don't see a lot
[57:18.580 --> 57:25.940]  of open bud structure plants, but you might see some Durban poison. You might see some of the
[57:25.940 --> 57:29.700]  hybrid-leaning sativas, stuff that we would call sativa.
[57:33.220 --> 57:37.380]  Aladdin, how are you doing? Aladdin. How's it going? Can you guys hear me?
[57:38.420 --> 57:42.820]  We can hear you now. Big thumbs up. Perfect. I'm sorry about that. I had a glitch.
[57:43.860 --> 57:51.620]  No problem. We got some good questions for you coming in from the viewers as far as varieties
[57:51.620 --> 57:58.020]  that have open bud structures. I know you work with sativas as well and narrowleaf. First,
[57:58.020 --> 58:04.180]  let's talk about narrowleaf and broadleaf. Indica sativa hybrid is what we all were taught for so
[58:04.180 --> 58:11.300]  many years. I feel like that really doesn't embody what we're talking about now as far as genetics.
[58:11.300 --> 58:16.420]  You can have stuff that has an open bud structure, which would be considered a narrowleaf variety,
[58:16.500 --> 58:22.020]  that has the effects because it's a hybrid, but has the effects of something that they would call
[58:22.020 --> 58:28.500]  indica. We're talking about drugleaf varietals, narrowleaf and wideleaf. What are your thoughts
[58:28.500 --> 58:43.840]  on that, Aladdin? I agree with that. Right on, man. It looks like we got a freezer.
[58:43.840 --> 58:49.280]  We were so close. There's a glitch in the matrix. Everyone who was watching last night, I had
[58:49.600 --> 58:55.920]  double versions of me. All right. When he troubleshoots that, we'll bring him back.
[58:57.280 --> 59:01.760]  Carry on. We're talking about narrowleaf and drugleaf varieties.
[59:03.360 --> 59:05.760]  Narrowleaf and drugleaf varieties. Oh, we got him back.
[59:08.880 --> 59:17.120]  Okay. Like you were saying before, it's a simplification. Even with afghan cultivars,
[59:17.760 --> 59:24.640]  you can notice it. You can see some plants that are supposed to be pure indica having
[59:24.640 --> 59:39.400]  pretty narrow leaves. It's definitely possible. Okay. I'm unmuted. If you look at the term indica,
[59:39.400 --> 59:46.520]  it means from or derived typically from India. India is a huge, huge country. If you're talking
[59:46.520 --> 59:54.920]  about indica being from there, they have that equatorialness, but they have tropical regions
[59:54.920 --> 01:00:00.760]  with plants with open bud structure. Some of this, the nomenclature definitely needs to be
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:07.000]  updated and changed. Robert Connell-Clark talked about narrowleaf and wideleaf varieties. I think
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.520]  in ruderalis and other things, but it's all cannabis el sativa. I think these things are
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.880]  definitely going to change as far as from a scientific perspective as the way we talk about
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:26.600]  this stuff. We got you back, Aladdin. Yes. It's the same for the effects as well. It's possible
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:34.840]  to have a pure NLD, a pure sativa, tropical sativa, that when you smoke it, it does not
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:41.240]  feel like a sativa at all. It can make you want to sleep, for example. Yeah. Well, sour juices.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.800]  Popular variety in the States that I think a lot of people are familiar with. Well, that has a very
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:54.920]  open bud structure. The calyx are very open. The calyx stack. Now it foxtails as it grows typically.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.400]  I mean, even the best growers, the sour diesel will foxtail a little bit. But the thing is,
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:04.920]  is it has the effect of a strong, strong indica. It'll give you couch lock. Even at 14%,
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.440]  it'll give you those effects to where it's very much the opposite of what we would consider sativa.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.520]  So this nomenclature is obviously going to change over the next so many years. I think
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:23.480]  we're starting to get familiar with talking about it as a narrow leaf and broad leaf.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:32.120]  Jamal, you want to touch on any of that? Yeah. I completely agree. Last year, I grew
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.680]  an Afghani variety for the first time. It was considered an Afghan heirloom.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.760]  And the leaves were somewhat thin and it finished in mid to late October.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:52.120]  And it was just a great learning experience because I had assumed from all of the information
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.200]  that I had that it would be like an Afghani number one, that it would be super short.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:04.360]  It would flower faster than anything else. And it really, it wasn't. And that what we consider
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:13.400]  an Afghani or an indica is a worked version of what an Afghani actually is. And then when I
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:20.920]  realized that, I started looking into, I started thinking, okay, our idea of what a sativa is,
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.200]  when you go to a dispensary and you ask for a sativa, they might recommend Blue Dream or
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:33.000]  Sour Diesel, which are all just hybrids. And that really, it's very hard in the United States to
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:40.440]  a pure sativa, perhaps a pure indica, but to actually find a pure sativa is pretty rare.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:47.880]  Yeah. I mean, I could name a couple. I think Red Congolese would be a pure sativa. Durban
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:55.960]  Poison, actually, that's a White Widow times Durban. That definitely is, I would say,
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.360]  super sativa. As far as pure, yeah, I guess you can call that a pure sativa.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.240]  But as far as other sativas, we don't really see a lot of pure sativas. I mean, I would say more so
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:13.240]  with the hazes, you're seeing stuff that's more sativa, definitely, especially over in Spain,
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:20.840]  there's a lot of good selections of sativa and sativa hash available. What are your thoughts?
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.720]  What kind of varieties do you have of sativa that are more on the pure side, Aladdin, over in Spain?
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:31.080]  You're talking about like what people grow here?
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.240]  Or what's available? Yeah. I mean, what you work on as well, what's available in the markets over
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.520]  there that are pure? Yeah. So people love the amnesia. There's a lot of amnesia haze,
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:49.480]  Nicole Haze as well. Very famous. Yeah. Amnesia and Super Lemon, because amnesia is from Soma,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:57.640]  right? So Soma and Arianne are both two of my good friends. But the Super Silver from Greenhouse,
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:03.080]  and then there's Amnesia Haze from Soma originally. We can debate the origins all day,
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:10.200]  but those are like sister plants, very, very similar and super popular that are strong,
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.640]  but they don't have the effect of something like Liberty Haze or Neville's Haze or some of those
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.400]  original things that Neville worked on and some of the other guys back in the day
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:26.520]  that are really... The effects from those sativas, man, it was like heart palpitations.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.440]  Even at lower amounts of THC, they were extremely strong. So we don't get a ton of that in the
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.080]  States. But I mean, all those things are changing. I think Red Seal from San Francisco grows,
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.760]  the Red Congolese, and that has similar effects. I really like it. They just gifted me a bunch of
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:52.120]  it the other day for personal. And I see those things coming back around. I think right now in
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.400]  the United States, I think the big thing with the exotic market is all color. Everyone wants purple
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:03.080]  again. But these things are in trends and we'll go back to some land race and land race products
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:10.280]  when somebody finds some interesting terpene profiles. So... Oh, here, I have a plant.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.240]  Someone asked... Here, while he's looking for that.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:26.200]  Here's a... Here's the Keona cut of the Vietnam Black. And I was honestly hoping that it would
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:33.240]  be a little bit more exotic than this. But... Yeah.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.080]  We'll have to wait to smoke it and see what happens.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.560]  Yeah, that's going to be fun, Shane.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.680]  Yeah, luckily, it's pretty small.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:50.280]  Yeah. So, you know, we're talking about traits to look for. Leaf to bud ratio is another great
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.080]  quality. If you're breeding, you want to look for a good bud to leaf ratio as opposed to a
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:00.920]  leaf to bud ratio that's definitely more full. I mean, from a commercial perspective, especially
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.960]  the less they have to trim it, the less they beat it up, the better quality and the higher THC
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.160]  you'll have on them. But, you know, I love some of those varieties that do have a lot of leaf.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.720]  Aladdin, so over... You know, if we're talking about what are the popular varieties right now
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.280]  that are going across Spain?
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.760]  Oh, I'm not sure. There's a lot of different strains, but people right now in Spain like
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:36.040]  American genetics. You know, it's very trendy here because, well, you know, opposites attract,
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:42.520]  I guess. So people in the United States like a lot of old school strains from the Netherlands.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.880]  They like working with Landry's to create new things. And people here in Europe are like really
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.080]  into the American strains right now from California, mostly.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.440]  Yeah, I think they're producing a lot of American strains right now. It used to be a lot of just
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:03.960]  the Moroccan land race, but, you know, a lot of... They're getting a lot of tangy DNA. You know, I
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:09.000]  know they've been down there quite a bit and other seed varieties. They're starting to test
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.040]  out autoflowers and getting successful with autoflowers. What are your guys' thoughts on
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:20.200]  autoflowers? I obviously love autoflowers. I read autoflower. I, you know, I swear by them as well
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.640]  from a commercial standpoint. Jamal, what do you think about autoflower?
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:30.120]  So this summer was the first time I grew an autoflower. I really enjoyed the growing process.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:40.120]  It flowered, started flowering in June, finished by August, late July. But, you know, the smoke,
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.280]  it just wasn't there. It just wasn't there for me yet.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.880]  I'll have to give you some of my seeds.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.120]  Yeah. You know, I try to not, you know, to jump to conclusions on things and, you know,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:08:01.480]  you got to be open. But, you know, the last one that I grew, I just don't think it was there yet.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.160]  But I do think it would be a great tool for breeding. It's a great tool to learn
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.800]  for people who want to have small plants, people who want to get many crops in.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.520]  You know, I think it's one of many, of many tools.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.040]  Aladdin, what are your thoughts on autoflowers? And I know, obviously, there's a lot of autoflowers
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:24.200]  in Spain. You know, I've worked in Spain. It's very popular here because there's a lot of people
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:31.000]  growing, you know, like their balcony in the middle of the city. And they have like a little
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.080]  bit of space somewhere. And they want to be able to have some very, you know, low plants that will
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.200]  remain very short and that they can like grow several times, you know, have several crops
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:49.640]  in a year. Personally, I love autoflowers. I think it's great for, you know, growers in
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:56.280]  northern climates where it's the weather summer is very short, where there's a lot of rain and
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:02.440]  in the fall season. So it allows them to harvest something in the middle of the summer. So I think
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:09.880]  something in the middle of the summer. So I think that's very, very good. And I also feel like autos
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:17.880]  are getting better and better. I grew the low rider about 12, 13 years ago. And well, it was
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:25.000]  not good. But now like autos are getting way better. And there's a lot of breeders specializing
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:31.720]  in autoflowers. And they've been able to do some great, great things. We're also working on
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:39.400]  an auto cross right now. And it takes a lot of time because, you know, it's harder to stabilize.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:46.680]  And when you out cross an auto with a plant that's, you know, not automatic, that's like a
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:52.280]  pheno, you know, a photo plant crossed with an auto, then it's not going to be auto. So you have
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:58.920]  to keep working the line until you find the autoflowering plants and you know. So I got a
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.640]  little bit about, you know, as far as if we're talking about, we call them semi autos. In fact,
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:09.800]  Oregon CBD has tried to patent the semi autos and we've been making them for years. But semi autos
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.480]  are something very interesting because you don't have the two gene pairs. So when you breed an
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.200]  autoflower with a photo period plant, you get what's called a semi auto. That means it has
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:25.640]  the genes from one of the parents, but not both of them. So it doesn't express as a true autoflower.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:31.880]  Now that has commercial viability because what that does as a semi auto is that reduces the
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.240]  flower time and it also triggers faster. So if you have something that's really dominant,
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.920]  especially when you put it with an autoflower, you can get a seed version of that plant
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.320]  that actually produces faster. But they're also a lot bigger than an autoflower. So they'll go
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:54.600]  longer, but they can produce a sizable amount of flower. And, you know, I feel like there's a huge
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:00.920]  market for those in the future too. It's all about mastering them. You're going to see that coming
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.880]  up in big ag in the next probably year or so people that are doing semi autoflower runs.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:14.280]  I completely agree. I used to live in Washington right as legalization rolled out and, you know,
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.520]  seeing these huge farms in Eastern Washington that would literally freeze over when the buds
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:24.840]  were at week seven, you know, week six or seven, I think states like Washington would crush with
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:32.040]  semi autoflowers. Yeah. Yeah. It's really, you know, there's just so many ways we can go with
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:38.840]  breeding and there's a ton of genetics to work from and there's a ton of unique stuff, you know,
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:45.960]  still available to create and diversity that hasn't been locked up yet. What are your guys'
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:53.640]  thoughts on genomics? Aladdin, you guys have genomics labs out there. I know Dynafem
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.840]  is working with genomics and marker-driven breeding. Are any of the people you work with
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:06.280]  working with genomics and markers? Well, most people test, you know, they test their weed.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:12.520]  They use the labs, you know, like Canna Labs in Valencia, for example. So they get their weeds,
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:20.680]  their weed tested for terpenes, cannabinoids and all that. But genomics, no. Most people just,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.120]  you know, select the plants based on certain traits that they're after, but they do not do it
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.000]  that way. Yeah. I mean, for the individual, it just gets more expensive. I think most individuals
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.320]  are not ready to drop $100,000 into one variety to breed for a few traits. And especially with
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.720]  you know, the way things are, it's like people want the latest and greatest. What's popular one
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:53.000]  day, which I think this is going to stabilize, but what's popular today, three months from now
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.360]  is not what's popular. Six months from now, it sounds like something really old. And, you know,
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  we want the latest and greatest stuff. But I feel like that's going to stabilize. And, you know,
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.800]  working with these, you know, people are going for those different terpene profiles. So even though
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.640]  the exotic market is really gearing towards color, people still want a different flavor. I mean,
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:21.640]  I think they're trying to find that new next exotic. So Dio Farms has, I don't know if you've
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:28.360]  seen it Jamal, but Dio Farms has a RS11. And that's the new hotness in the Bay Area. It's,
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  you know, we've had Pluto runs and I feel like RS11 is the new winner. It's the new hype strain,
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.400]  but it really kind of delivers on that. It's not just another gelato. It has a creaminess to it
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:46.440]  that you don't see. But hopefully, you know, for the three of us, I think it's not going to all be
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.400]  about gelatos and stuff. We need to get those new terpene profiles and whether it's purple or green
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.600]  or it's bud structure, it's about those terpene profiles. I mean, you know, I really think that,
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.200]  you know, there have to be people that can't be afraid to try new things because that's how the
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:08.840]  new exotic comes about. Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, that's part of the reason why it's
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:14.680]  important to keep landrace varieties around is so that you can, you know, make the next whatever,
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:21.240]  next cake strain. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Jay Beasley is working on it right now. I guarantee.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:32.840]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So as far as exotics go, you know, Spain is kind of a year behind us with
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.800]  our exotics. Those varieties do get out there. You guys are still getting exotic varieties and
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:48.040]  seeds from the US and at least those styles grown, you know, to the standards over in Barcelona,
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:53.400]  which I think have, or not in Barcelona, but in Spain in general, you guys have really stepped up
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.400]  the cultivation aspect of it over the last five years. I remember in 2012, I wasn't really
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.200]  impressed with anything on the social scene when I went to Spain. I love Spain. I've been going
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.320]  there for a long time. I had, you know, I had a business established over in Spain, but the
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:16.920]  cultivation side has really improved as far as quality. I think even there wasn't a lot of flower
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.280]  sales back in the day. It was mostly, there were some people buying flower, but most of them were
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.520]  mixing it with tobacco. Now there's a lot of people smoking peer and most of it was hash sales.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:34.360]  So do you attribute that to a lot of Americans coming over or just the mature, the actual market
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:40.600]  maturing over there and the customer base maturing and getting more educated? Well, I think it's
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:47.320]  because of the competition. Mostly, you know, there's, you know, very high level in the United
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.280]  States. People like, you know, a lot of Europeans like what people do in the U.S. and they try to
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:58.360]  learn from them. So they kind of have to up their game, you know, and it's not the only factor.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:04.120]  There's an other reason for that is the fact that here in Spain, it's like the Mecca of, you know,
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:09.800]  cannabis for cannabis breeding in Europe. So there's a lot of people coming from other countries,
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:17.240]  such as the UK, France, Italy, that all go to Spain to be able to grow, you know, high quality
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:24.600]  weed and to start breeding. So because of that, you know, it makes cannabis, you know, the quality
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:33.160]  of the cannabis produced here better. Yeah. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about some more
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.080]  technical stuff. Like you guys, as far as how do you cure your seeds and how do you, how do you
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.360]  harvest? We'll start with harvesting and then go through curing. Aladdin, do you hang your plants
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.920]  upside down, fully let them dry and strip them then? Or do you actually strip them off of the
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.880]  plant wet and dry them separately? Because I personally dry them. I stripped the plants wet
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:59.240]  and put them in a bag. One of my friends showed me this trick a couple of years ago and I've done
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:08.670]  it over the years. What's your process? I'm sorry, I cannot hear you.
[01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:14.110]  Okay. I was asking about your, your harvesting process when you're harvesting your seeds.
[01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:20.270]  Do you actually, do you strip the plants when they're wet? Do you hang them upside down when
[01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:26.670]  they're dry? What are your tips and tricks for people that want to properly harvest?
[01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:34.910]  So it depends on the strain once again, because with, you know, Indica's like for example,
[01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:42.430]  the Afghan's, it's a lot easier because, you know, the, the, the seeds will remain
[01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:49.150]  within the pods. So we can then, you know, harvest the plants, dry them. Well, we don't like hang
[01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:54.670]  them because we don't want the seals to fall off, the seeds fall off as they dry. But yeah,
[01:17:54.670 --> 01:18:01.470]  we dry them and then we pick the seeds once the buds are dry. But with sativas, there's a lot of
[01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:07.470]  these plants with open structure that will have their seeds falling off the pods as soon as
[01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:13.310]  they're ready. So there's like, you're going to be harvesting most of the seeds before you chop
[01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:19.150]  the plants. You know, it's very weird, but you have to, to harvest, shake the branches every
[01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:24.270]  couple of days to collect the seeds from each plant because they fall off the pods.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.700]  Yeah. Jamal, how do you harvest your seeds?
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:36.260]  Yeah, it depends. I mean, if I'm, if I'm doing a common hybrid, all you need to harvest the plants,
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:42.740]  let them get bone dry, put them in a Keef tumbler and tumble them. It breaks down the material. So
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:47.140]  I don't have to break it up by hand and I'm able to capture the Keef. And then I'll put it into
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:54.660]  like a trim bin and usually just sort them by hand. And then, you know, from that point on,
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:01.460]  I try to let them get as cold as possible and go into like a, like a dormancy cold period.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:08.100]  And then I'll, I will try to package them when it's as dry as possible.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:16.580]  Yeah, for me, I, I stripped my, I mean, I used to hang everything until it was dry and I would
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:22.020]  turn the humidity down. I was, you know, de-hues on full, dehydrate everything as much as possible.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:30.500]  So it was crispy, strip it and homogenize the material. Now I feel like for me, it's easier.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:36.980]  I strip it into paper bags or into bins that get turned, but you take that stem out of there and
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:44.420]  it dries much faster. You know, I'm looking for, yeah, I also take my seeds in flower. I'll take
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:51.300]  them an extra 30 to 40 days sometimes till the most of the seeds are mature. But I feel like
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.020]  stripping them and putting them in paper and also turning, turning on your de-hues so you get as dry
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:02.500]  as possible. Then once you do that, I actually take and homogenize the material over trim bins so I
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:08.260]  can save any of the heath. So I roll it, actually roll it with your hands. You're going to roll it
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:12.260]  over that trim bin, roll them back and forth, and then you put them in a seed separator.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:20.020]  It seems it's super efficient. It separates all the chaff. And, you know, you can, you can do a
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:27.940]  million seeds in a day if you're, you're productive. So how about storing seeds, Aladdin?
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:36.100]  How do you store your seeds for long-term? Do you use glass? Do you use plastic? What are your tips and tricks?
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:44.260]  Yeah, I think glass is better because plastic is porous. There's two main factors when you store
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:50.260]  seeds. I think it's good to have a very dry environment. And if the temperature is cool
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:56.900]  and constant, it's also better, you know, because temperature variation will hurt seed viability.
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:03.700]  So in a dedicated fridge, within a glass jar, with silica packs, that's how we store the seeds.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:12.500]  How about you? What, how do you store the seeds, James? Desiccant, glass. I mean, I do use some
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:17.060]  centrifuge tubes for a lot of stuff, especially if I'm trying to organize small amounts of seeds.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:22.420]  But I keep them cold, and I keep them as dry as possible. Desiccant, either beads, the silica beads.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.900]  If it's a small centrifuge, I also do, like, large centrifuge. I'll put the desiccant packs. And then
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:34.980]  if I do mason jars, I'll put mason jars, and I'll use desiccant packs in those multiple to keep them
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:41.540]  as dry as possible. But I definitely leave them in, someone said, bag open, bag every day. Paper,
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.380]  you need to leave it for a minimum of a month in a paper bag open. I have a friend,
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:49.860]  I'm not going to name any names, but one of my friends called me up after he had just harvested
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:54.260]  about a half a million seeds and said, hey, I put them in five gallon buckets in the fridge. That's
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:58.260]  right, correct? And I said, when did you do it? He said, three days ago. I said, get them out of
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:02.100]  there, man. You got to put them in paper and let them dry. Well, what that did is it took his
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:07.780]  germination rate down from 100, you know, 99 to 100%, which is what it should be, down to 50%.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:15.380]  You know, and these are hard lessons that we learn. So it's important to fully dry your seeds,
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.140]  and even using desiccants, that's not going to help it. You really have to fully dry,
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:23.780]  and it's a curing process, just like you would cure your flower. You have to fully dry those
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:31.620]  plants out. So, you know, and then if you want to, if you have to sell your seeds right away
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.500]  after you've harvested them, you know, give them two weeks, a week or whatever, but you can flash
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:42.260]  them in the freezer overnight, and it's a stratification process that actually will benefit
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:48.260]  you, and you'll have a, you'll maintain that germination rate. I've totally noticed that some
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:53.540]  of my seeds, you know, if I like pull them off a plant and try to plant them right away, or try to
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:58.900]  like stick them in water, they don't sprout. You know, they definitely need that, you know,
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:07.460]  a couple weeks to a month to really cure. Yeah. Yeah, you know, and anything, you know, above and
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:11.860]  beyond that, it's like, it's really important to have that cure. Otherwise, your germination rate
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.860]  is just going to go lower and lower. And then if you're talking about, like, I want to be able to
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:21.940]  store my seeds for 10 years or more, you really have to not skip on that step. It's important that
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:27.620]  you do those things correctly. I mean, you spend all this time to create this amazing product,
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:32.260]  hopefully, and then just to mess it up, just like with flour, people mess up flour all the time
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:38.340]  in the curing process. They cure too fast, too quickly. Those are just, it's just as important,
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:42.500]  or more important than growing the flour, growing the, making the seeds, you know,
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.500]  that curing and storage. And it could be the difference of 50% germination.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:56.900]  So, let's see, what else should we talk about, guys? Curing and storing. You guys use a
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:02.580]  seed separators? Or do you guys separate by hand? And how do you separate your seeds from the chaff
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:14.940]  if you're not using a separator? Yeah, I wanted to ask you a question. Sure. I noticed that,
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:21.100]  you know, for some varieties, some strains that come from dry climates, germination rate is very,
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:26.220]  very high from the get. As soon as you pick the seeds, they'll be able to sprout right away.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:32.620]  So that is the case with the Moroccan, the Afghans as well. But for some strains, you know,
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:39.660]  I feel like the germination rate is low, because the seeds in a state of dormancy, you know,
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.780]  and if you crack the seeds, if you crack the seeds, then they'll sprout, almost all of them.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:51.100]  But if you don't, it'll be a very low germ rate. However, after the seeds mature, germination rate
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:56.860]  goes up over time. Have you noticed the same thing? And what do you do to get the seeds out
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:03.420]  of their dormant state? Yeah, I feel like you can actually put the seeds in the refrigerator for a
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:08.780]  month. If those are the kind of issues that you're having, once they're cured out, you can put them,
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:13.900]  once they go in the cold for about a month, then you usually don't have a problem. You know,
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:19.340]  some tips for germinating, you know, obviously, we're talking about cracking, they have little
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:26.860]  seed crackers you can buy, you can crack them physically by hand. But also scarification on
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:33.660]  older seeds works really well. And that process involves like a, if you can still find match boxes,
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:37.420]  and putting sandpaper in the matchbox and shaking the seeds, if you're just doing small amounts.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.660]  Those are good ways to do it. But yeah, some seeds will germinate, you're right, right away,
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:48.380]  and some some take longer. It just depends on the varietal and knowing,
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.940]  knowing what variety you're working with and how to work with it.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:57.740]  And the only way you can do that is testing. So a lot of people will sell their seeds,
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.500]  they'll dry and cure them and try to get them to market right away without running them through
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:07.580]  tests. I assume both you guys test your seed crops before they're sold. Correct?
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.040]  Yes.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.100]  Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:19.180]  Yeah, there's there's a lot of guys, they'll take pictures and use the pictures from the seed run
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:24.860]  of the mother plant as the picture that you see online for their stuff. And you know,
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:29.660]  there's nothing wrong with that, I guess, if you know that it's going to be stable. But I feel like
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.260]  it's almost cheating, because you really should tell your customers and be able to show your
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:37.980]  customers what the finished product is going to look like, what the best of the finished product
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.540]  is going to look like. You know, and also so you know that you don't have hermaphrodites and you
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:48.220]  don't have, you know, low germination rates. There's some companies that broke up because of
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:54.620]  low germ, not even low, but almost zero germination rate. You know, and they were selling $500 packs,
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:59.180]  and they didn't even germinate. And that's because the seeds weren't tested. Testing seeds is just
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:04.300]  so important. I mean, that's, that's a huge step in, you know, that's like the difference between
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.900]  a breeder and a pollen checker. It's the breeders that actually test their stuff.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.500]  There's exceptions. There's exceptions like Ken Arado. I feel like he understands the genetics
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.780]  he's working with, and he's done a good job. But even he tests a lot of his stuff.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.660]  I completely agree. I mean, that's probably one of the things I feel the strongest about.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.020]  You know, if you're not going to take the time to, to test your own stuff, why should you?
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:34.460]  To test your own stuff? Why should people purchase it? And when you when you test different
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:40.780]  varieties, you learn these different intrinsic qualities of them. So for example, somebody
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:48.780]  sprouts a pack of whatever from me. And, you know, I can tell them, you know, look for these phenos,
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:53.420]  not these phenos. Or if you like this, you'll like the one that's really tall. And if you like
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.940]  the fruitier one, you like the one that's really short. Or you know, it needs very low fertilizer,
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.820]  or it needs really high fertilizer, or, you know, it's going to get spider mites no matter what.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:09.580]  All of these things are really price, it's priceless information. And I mean, that kind of
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:15.180]  comes, that's kind of what you're buying, what you should be buying with the pack is the knowledge
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.620]  on how to make it successful.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:23.900]  Agreed. Agreed. It's not Yeah, what's your take, Aladdin?
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:31.180]  Yeah, right on. I mean, it's not just testing to make sure that the germ, the germ rate is good,
[01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:36.140]  that you're not going to have hermaphrodites. It's also testing to be able to provide people
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:42.380]  with information. Because like, if you have, for example, two different IBLs, and you outcross them
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:49.420]  to make an F1, a true F1, then you're going to want to know, like how that, you know, F1 will
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:55.580]  grow. And that way, you'll be able to write a complete description to help people understand,
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:01.500]  you know, how to grow that plant properly. And what's it what's to expect, you know?
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:09.500]  I mean, it's literally like customer support. You know, like just helping your customer become
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.060]  successful, because when they're successful, they're going to come back to you. And
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.220]  And at the end of the day, breeding, anybody can make seeds, anybody can take pollen and put it on
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.580]  a female plant, make seeds, there's 2000 seed companies doing it right now. But the real,
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:30.780]  the real side of the breeding is actually pheno hunting. So the pheno hunting plays that,
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:37.180]  that's that important role that in our obligation as breeders, it's our job to actually take and
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:43.740]  pheno hunt and find those amazing phenotypes to breed with. You know, it's a, it's a funny thing.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.580]  But yeah, I mean, everyone's got a seed company now. And it's like the ones you look at the really
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:52.540]  good seed companies, those guys are good growers, those guys are good pheno hunters. It's not about
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:56.780]  making seeds. I don't know anybody that's just good at making seeds and not good at growing.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:02.380]  Right. Not a single company out there. Those guys, you look at the best, the guys who you
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:06.780]  everybody that's watching that think those guys, they make really high quality genetics,
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:10.940]  every once in a while, something gets lucky. You know, but for the most part, the guys that
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:15.340]  keep on coming out with interesting stuff, and they're doing a good job and staying relevant.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:19.820]  Those guys are good growers. And that's what makes the difference. You got to be able to grow your
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:27.820]  stuff out. I mean, I grew for 18 years before I even would dare to consider even saying the B
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:34.300]  word. Because, you know, there are so many people who just take two things, put them together,
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:40.140]  consider themselves a breeder. You know, and it's true, you have to be able to have mastered the art
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:48.700]  of growing before you can then get to the art of population of the cannabis. Cannabis. Sure.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.380]  11.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:57.740]  To be able to pheno hunt effectively, and then to be able to select a certain,
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:03.020]  you know, pheno that you like, and then fix the traits, it takes a lot of practice,
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:08.460]  and you have to be able to grow perfectly. Because if you don't, you won't be able to,
[01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:14.700]  you know, to do a proper selection, and then to select, you know, the same traits generation
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:19.500]  after generation. Because if the way you grow is not consistent, it won't be possible.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:27.260]  Correct. Yeah, I mean, expression is the key. Express itself. Maximum expression out of that
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:33.100]  plant and you want consistency. You know, I can use J. Beasy is a great example because
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:37.740]  of wedding cake. Now that's something that was released in something I've seen 30 different
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:44.140]  phenotypes of. And there's really only two good two, maybe three that are decent. But any other
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:47.900]  ones are good. Don't get me wrong, they're fine for growing. But as far as what I would breed with,
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.820]  you know, there's only one or two that I would actually consider breeding with. And
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:57.500]  the difference on one of them is the chirping profile and then structure. And they're both
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:02.060]  amazing. But if you don't know how to select from those, you can actually be taking away from the
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.980]  gene pool instead of adding to the gene pool, making word seeds and the person you bought
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:11.900]  seeds from or bought a clone from. And so that's the really, you know, I think is our job as
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:17.500]  stewards of the plant is to take these things and improve upon the gene pool rather than take away
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:22.620]  from it. I feel like you guys are both in that right mindset that it's all about improving and
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:28.300]  preserving what's already there and looking at pragmatically and not taking away from the gene
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:34.780]  pool for the sake of money, especially, you know, you got to be got to be humble and realize that
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:39.420]  most of your stuff isn't going to be a keeper and to be OK with throwing away whole wines.
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:45.900]  What how much so like if you if you pop 100 seeds, what would you consider a keeper? 1 percent,
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:51.580]  2 percent? It would totally depend on what I'm searching for. But, you know, I've definitely
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:59.100]  gone down lines and realized I was going in the wrong place and, you know, had to be OK with.
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:03.580]  All right. A whole season of seeds. You know, maybe I could still grow them, but it's not what
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:09.020]  I'm looking for. And, you know, you have to be honest with yourself and honest with the plant.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:14.780]  Are you improving upon the cannabis genome or are you taking away from it and just,
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:26.500]  you know, trying to make something with the cool name? Yeah. So, Aladdin, you still there? Yes,
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:32.260]  I am. What are your thoughts on the cannabis gene pool and people improving or taking away from it?
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:38.980]  Yeah, I mean, it's like you said before, it's super easy to I mean, it's pretty easy to make
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:46.660]  seeds. But being able to select the right phenos and improve upon it, it's tricky. It's a numbers
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:53.220]  game. And sometimes you're going to grow like 100 plants or even 200 and be like, all right,
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:56.740]  I'm going to have to throw everything away because it's not it's not what I was looking for.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:04.420]  But it also depends on what you want, because if you're like working in IVL in order to then
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:10.100]  out process it and create something new with it, it's not going to be the same as if you're just
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:16.260]  pheno hunting to to get like a beautiful pheno that then you're going to have to stabilize.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:21.380]  You know, there's like, you know, if you like a Landry's, for example, that that Landry's strain
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:27.940]  is fairly stable and you like these traits. Well, then it's going to be easier to, you know,
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:33.540]  to stabilize that because it's pretty consistent. But if you're working with an F2 and looking for
[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:41.450]  an outlier, it's different. Yeah, and there's lots of outliers. You know, it's like that's where
[01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:46.330]  you find the real outliers is in that F2 generation. But to take something that's an F2
[01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:53.610]  and to turn it into a stable line, that's where the real breeding skills come in. Unfortunately,
[01:34:54.650 --> 01:35:02.250]  the market, other than the commercial market for for companies, as far as ag, the regular Joe
[01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:06.650]  who's buying seats, they're not worried about stability. They're worried about that new hot
[01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:14.090]  strain. They want that new gelato cross, you know. But as far as like really, you know, for the people
[01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:19.690]  out there watching breeding, you find a lot of interesting stuff in the F2s. So F1s typically,
[01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:24.570]  and we're working with complex polyhybrids. And what that means is there's several lines,
[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:30.170]  genetic lines in it, and it's not very stable. So there's tons of phenotypical variation.
[01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:37.770]  They call it so as far as heterozygosity, it's extremely heterozygous, which means it's all over
[01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:42.570]  the place as far as stuff. Well, when you take something like that, and you cross it with another
[01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:48.970]  plant that's like that, you get an F1 complex polyhybrid. With that F1 complex polyhybrid,
[01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:52.490]  you're going to get a lot of phenotypical variation. But once you cross that back within
[01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:57.610]  itself to create an F2, that's where you'll find some outliers and recessive traits.
[01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:02.650]  So those recessive traits, that's where you find the magic. That's where you find the stuff that
[01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:06.890]  nobody's seen before. That's where, you know, I think drug discovery and all these other things,
[01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:10.330]  you'll get the plant to express itself in ways that it wouldn't normally express.
[01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:15.930]  So you take those F2s now to reinforce the quality traits. That's the part that could
[01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:20.330]  take years. You know, with genomics, it can go faster. But, you know, once you identify what
[01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:25.450]  you're looking for, whether it's terpene profile structure, any of those things, those need to be
[01:36:25.450 --> 01:36:31.130]  reinforced. And that's a lot of breeders are missing that whole 99% of the breeders aren't
[01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:35.610]  doing anything other than making F1s. You know, and that's kind of why I wanted you guys on the
[01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:41.770]  show today to talk about land race, inbred lines, the importance of actually breeding,
[01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:50.410]  you know, true breeding. And I mean, like, it comes down to being attached to a genetic long
[01:36:50.410 --> 01:36:54.570]  enough to really make that commitment. You know, because you have to love a strain if you're going
[01:36:54.570 --> 01:37:00.810]  to be willing to work with it for a couple years. You know, and so for me, that's really like the
[01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:04.810]  most important part is if you're going to choose to breed with something, you got to choose
[01:37:04.810 --> 01:37:10.250]  something that you're okay with smoking the keepers and the not keepers. And, you know, to
[01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:14.970]  keep moving forward with it and being okay with having that in your bag for a couple years.
[01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:19.450]  And you can smoke the keepers and give the non keepers out to other people. So that's,
[01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:23.450]  you know, you can, but sometimes you can't, you know, because people will look at it and
[01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:28.810]  they don't even want, they don't even want that. So it's like, it almost becomes like your child
[01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:35.450]  that you've gone through years of work with. And you know, that really separates the, you know,
[01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:41.450]  what what is special from what's kind of the fad. Yeah, if you guys are familiar with Simon from
[01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:46.650]  Sirius, I'm sure he has a, you know, he has a good background in plant science. And it took him
[01:37:46.650 --> 01:37:54.250]  five years to create five strains, by five cultivars, you know, Calimys and the AK 47,
[01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:59.370]  being two of the most popular strains that he created, which are, you know, they'll last the
[01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:04.410]  test of time. And those are true, yeah, true breeding. It took him to get to those plants,
[01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:10.250]  and they're super stable, amazing plants. Slowly, but surely, we'll have more of that going on.
[01:38:11.610 --> 01:38:16.410]  From an ag perspective, it's necessary. And we're also getting a lot of guys out of college
[01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:21.210]  that want to breed and they're understanding the basis, not just about F1s, but true breeding.
[01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:27.370]  You know, I'm excited to see what the future holds in some regards, I'm afraid in other regards.
[01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:33.850]  I think we definitely have our challenges in front of us, you know, I wish we could take a step back
[01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:40.330]  40 years. You know, because it's 2020, even more than that, probably 50 to 60 years,
[01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:45.370]  and really hold on to those original things that came out of places like Afghanistan,
[01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:52.890]  Kazakhstan, China, and even South America. And if we had those seeds to work with today,
[01:38:52.890 --> 01:38:57.210]  I mean, India, for example, I mean, there's hundreds of land race varieties
[01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:03.370]  that are regional that people had selected and worked for hundreds of years, you know,
[01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:09.690]  and a lot of those are gone. And what happened was people have brought stuff in. And so they brought
[01:39:09.690 --> 01:39:14.490]  genetics in from all over whether it was from Europe or America. And that changed the gene pool
[01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:22.240]  of so what are your guys's thoughts on that? Yeah.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:29.760]  Um, yeah, well, it's true. You know, there's a lot of land race varieties disappearing throughout
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:36.400]  the world. And it's a shame because the diversity used to be a lot more important than it is today.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.640]  And India, for example, like you said, has a lot of different land races. And, you know, from like
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:47.200]  one village to the next, you know, there's going to be different turf profiles and the plants are
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:52.640]  going to look different. So this is crazy, you know, because these farmers have selected these
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:58.480]  plants for different purposes. They have different tastes, and that created different land races.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:04.400]  So this is part of our this is part of our heritage as humans. And preserving it is very
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.360]  important because most of them are already gone, you know, so I agree with that, you know, and if
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:16.240]  we could have access to all the land races that were still around, you know, 3040 years ago,
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.320]  we'd be able to create even more amazing stuff. So what we have today, well, there's still a few
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:31.580]  land races still around. So we have to preserve what's left, you know? Totally. Jamal? Yeah,
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:38.060]  that's the impetus for our club is to preserve land races and to have things around so that,
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:41.180]  you know, in the future, we can break into them again.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.500]  Yeah, tell us a little bit more about your club. You know, if people are interested in joining your
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.060]  club, or is it something that you only do locally where you can do stuff? Or is it something online?
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:59.660]  How's your membership? And how do you guys work? So initially, okay, so I used to work at Berkeley
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:07.820]  Indoor Garden, which was one of the oldest Berkeley Indoor Garden, it's one of the oldest
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:15.980]  grow stores in the United States. It was opened in 81. And as I started transitioning away from
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:20.300]  Berkeley Indoor Garden, I had all my buddies at the shop that I would see all the time, and I really
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.340]  felt kind of bummed out that I was going to miss these relationships with these other growers.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:30.300]  So I decided to start a seed club. And basically, the club was that we would just meet up and
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:36.700]  sprout seeds and share seeds and talk about it. Then I discovered Indian Land Race Exchange,
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:48.140]  which is a exchange of cannabis seeds from India and in surrounding areas. And that really
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:54.300]  inspired me to start growing and preserving land race varieties. So basically, through them,
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:42:01.500]  I got the itch, started purchasing seeds from around the world, started growing them,
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:05.340]  and then eventually started to breed with them and preserve them.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:16.380]  And then COVID hit. And, you know, all of us growers were even more isolated than before. And,
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:23.580]  you know, we need community. So I decided to move it to on Zoom. And initially, we thought it was,
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:27.980]  you know, kind of took away from what we what we could do. But then I found that it actually
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:32.460]  added to it because everybody can make the meetings. And we could have guest speakers
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:40.220]  from all around the world. So now, we meet twice a month, and, you know, talk about our various
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:47.740]  pheno hunts and selections and flowers. And it's, you know, it's a pretty awesome community. The
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:52.140]  latest thing that we're doing is we just harvest most of the people in our group grow outdoors.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:58.460]  And so we're going to be doing like a big cannabis trade where we all you know,
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:04.300]  throw in a certain amount and swap buds so that we can test all the different phenos that different
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:12.380]  people grew. And then at the end of the year, we do or we have been doing a seed exchange to where
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:18.860]  we then trade seeds that we grew that year. And, you know, if people are interested in being a part,
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:25.980]  they can definitely contact me on on Instagram. And, you know, if I feel like it's the right fit,
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:31.740]  you know, we're definitely, you know, open to other like minded individuals.
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:39.020]  Excellent. So Aladdin, tell us about how we can go about getting your seeds if it's best
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:44.620]  through the website, or what do you recommend? And what do you recommend people order when they
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:51.500]  get your seeds? So yeah, um, you guys can find it on the website, kalifagenetics.com.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:44:01.340]  And we ship to Europe and the UK. But my buddy at ACE, ACE seeds, also ships to Canada, New Zealand.
[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:08.380]  And that's about it. But we're trying to find new people that can sell our seeds and you know,
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:13.500]  make them available to people in the US as well. Hopefully that'll be possible in the near future.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:17.740]  Awesome. So Peter, I'm sure there's
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.580]  and so if anybody has questions for us, send them send them Peter's way right now.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:30.620]  I was just so that website streaming across the bottom, we'll hopefully carry them there as well
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:38.620]  after the show. But let me get to the questions. There were a whole lot and I asked people to start
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:48.770]  repeating them. So one of the Alright, this is one of the on reversing.
[01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:57.410]  When reversing what is the ideal time to start treating autofilm with STS in order to retain
[01:44:57.410 --> 01:45:02.370]  the most amount of form? So that's a great question. For me, I don't use that yes, anymore.
[01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:08.850]  Using a nano silver, which is diluted, my friend, Tim, business partner, Tim,
[01:45:10.050 --> 01:45:14.370]  from Canada, Jen, we have this new company called loud Canada, Jen, which actually the seeds are
[01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:20.530]  available through Peter right now, we have our glue lotto. But what what we do and what I do,
[01:45:20.530 --> 01:45:27.250]  as far as autos is week three of auto I do starters, and then I go into if I'm breeding
[01:45:28.210 --> 01:45:35.330]  indoor, what I do personally is I use bio pots and bio pots are from charcoal. And so I use a
[01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:42.130]  rapid router or a cube to start them in. And that goes in for a week, they germinate and I transplant
[01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:50.290]  into the one liter and the one liters are narrow like this. So I leave that in for two weeks. And
[01:45:50.290 --> 01:45:55.090]  then that actually, right when I transplant that into the next one, people say not to transplant
[01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:59.330]  auto flowers. But I say not to transplant them unless you're familiar with how to do it correctly.
[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:03.970]  So you don't slow the root growth because the second the roots became rootbound, you'll lock
[01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:08.130]  out the plant and it won't grow anymore. But I start springing with silver, it doesn't matter
[01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:12.930]  what type of silver you start springing week three, typically on a 70 day auto flower, but it
[01:46:12.930 --> 01:46:19.810]  really depends on what type of auto flower if it's a 70 day auto flower, a 60 day auto flower,
[01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:25.570]  100 day auto flower, those things are important. But typically, you know, like with feminized,
[01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:30.610]  you start spraying one week before you flip the lights with auto flower, you got to start
[01:46:30.610 --> 01:46:35.010]  spring, you know, week three is what I do. And with the nano silver, it doesn't damage the plant.
[01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:39.810]  So I spray every other day with the nano silver, and the plant stays just as healthy as colloidal
[01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:44.930]  silver. So you know, if you're interested in nano silver, my book is coming out, we have a section
[01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:49.810]  on how to make your own nano silver. We're currently making a shelf stable version.
[01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:54.850]  But the book has a book that's coming out as a refrigerated version of the nano silver,
[01:46:54.850 --> 01:47:02.610]  you can make it with a light spectrum and a small mini fridge. It's a detailed process.
[01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:08.770]  But it's really interesting. Do you guys work with silver? And I'm sure you do,
[01:47:08.770 --> 01:47:12.930]  Aladdin, you work with some form of silver, you guys use STS or colloidal silver?
[01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:19.490]  Yeah, we use both CS colloidal silver and SDS as well. I noticed that you know,
[01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:25.970]  indica's are a lot easier to reverse. It's easier to make them produce male flowers,
[01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:32.130]  but sativas will need to be sprayed a lot more. So we can use CS which is healthier for indica's
[01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:38.610]  for reversing indica's and sativas we use STS because they stretch a whole lot. And then we'll
[01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:42.850]  require more SDS in order to reverse. That's what I noticed. I don't know if you've noticed
[01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:46.450]  the same thing. James. Yeah, I would say
[01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:53.810]  Blue Dream is the perfect example that it's not a true sativa, but it's definitely sativa leaning.
[01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:58.930]  And it was one of the hardest plants I've ever reversed. And my friend effortlessly reversed it
[01:47:58.930 --> 01:48:03.970]  with this nano silver. But yes, it's a team is definitely have, you have to spray them more
[01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:09.170]  often for a longer period of time. Because the transition where they trigger usually takes a lot
[01:48:09.170 --> 01:48:15.330]  longer. There's other things you can do to manipulate. So this is a good tip. And I don't
[01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:20.450]  I've never even shared this, I think, but temperature swing on stuff that's equatorial,
[01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:24.530]  certain varieties, they don't trigger when you want them to trigger, you could go to the lights,
[01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:27.650]  you can bring lights down eight hours, and sometimes they don't trigger. Well,
[01:48:28.610 --> 01:48:31.570]  one tip and one trick you can do is you can spray
[01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:38.610]  PK instead of nitrogen, you just use your blue mix, you can foliar and then also a 20 degree
[01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:43.970]  temperature swing. So if your room is at 80, you got to get it at nighttime below 60. And that will
[01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:50.770]  help induce triggering. So those are little, you know, sativa tricks. So that's, that's one thing
[01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:51.490]  I like to
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.080]  go ahead. I'm sorry. Oh, no, that's it. So Peter, what was your first question?
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.960]  Or just quickly, Aladdin, did you have something to add to that? Yeah, I was gonna say you talked
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:16.960]  about transplanting autos before. And growing it's funny, because growing pure sativas is the exact
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.560]  same thing, but it's the opposite. We leave them within some tiny little solo cups,
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:29.360]  on purpose to make them stall as much as possible, we make them stall, and we flip them to flower
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:37.360]  within these little solo cups. And that way, they're like root bound, they remain a lot smaller.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.440]  And that allows us to like grow a lot more plants in order to have more genetic diversity going
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.080]  because they take up a lot of space. We leave them within these tiny little, you know, solo
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:53.280]  cups, flip them to flower in these pots. And then, you know, we transplant only when they start
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.320]  showing signs of, you know, really like deficiencies and things like that. Then we give
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.240]  them, you know, slightly bigger pots and you know, you can you can keep going that way and you'll end
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.320]  up with very small sativas, like dwarf sativas. So yeah, the exact opposite.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:18.800]  Yeah, you know, I actually, I actually have the do the same thing when I am
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:25.280]  pheno hunting for sativas to where I'll keep them in a pretty small pot or put them outside in like
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:32.480]  September, at like six inches, and they'll still end up finishing at about three and a half, four
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:39.360]  feet. And I'd say that's kind of one of the secrets to being successful with growing sativas.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.800]  And you know, varieties that stretch that are a lot more equatorial is just to really keep them
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:53.120]  on the smaller side so they don't get out of hand. Yeah, it's funny those sativa, a true, you know,
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:59.840]  narrow leaf variety, they can triple size in flower once they start flowering. And I believe
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:03.520]  that's because they go in and out of flower and that's part of the open bud structure as well.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.400]  These plants go in and out of flower throughout their lifetime in the flowering process.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.480]  And that allows for that open bud structure to form the looser node spacing.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:18.320]  But yeah, that sounds good. And Peter, as far as other questions, what do we got?
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.480]  So there are a bunch of questions. But before we get to those, something when you guys were first
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:32.240]  defining land race, I think some people were frustrated with the nomenclature, the semantics,
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:37.280]  and kind of like, does the word heirloom come in anywhere? And would that be a more appropriate
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:44.080]  word for stuff that's been touched by people? Well, so heirloom, heirloom is the typical term
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.840]  if it's been cultivated for more than 50 years. So the term heirloom is something that's older
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:54.160]  than 50 years. Yeah. And there's all these nomenclature things. If you, you gotta look
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.320]  back to agriculture, other crops and how they treat other crops. If it's an heirloom variety,
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.880]  that heirloom seed has been around over 50 years. So that's basically what a heirloom is.
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:09.280]  Now, if we're talking about stuff that's indigenous, it means that it came from that
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:16.880]  region originally. If we're talking about, you know, land race, land race means it's cultivated
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:23.840]  in those areas and selected by the people in that region. And then there's feral cannabis as well.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:28.880]  Feral is the wild stuff. So it's important to understand all those things when we're talking
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.800]  about cannabis and seeds. You know, there's feral ditchweed in Ohio, not even ditchweed,
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:38.800]  but ditch hemp that's growing on the side of the road. You can take that and you can
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:43.040]  possibly find some interesting things in there. But that's feral hemp.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.920]  Got it. Okay. So we have, can you guys see that one?
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:59.700]  A drug cannabis was bred in India before stealth and clones. You want to touch on that, Aladdin?
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:07.380]  I don't understand the question. I'm sorry. So they want to know how cannabis was bred.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:12.740]  I mean, it was taken from, I'm sure it was taken from wild varieties. These feral varieties
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:19.140]  had slowly cultivated over time or needs. I mean, that's like, that's how hemp rope came to be
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:24.420]  about. It was specific varieties that they slowly bred over time. I mean, you can look at other
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:32.740]  crops, cruciferous stuff like broccoli, cabbage, all these things, they stem from wild mustard
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:38.340]  originally, you know, and cannabis is no different in the sense that although it's the same thing,
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:42.740]  but we're talking about several things that are very similar, but these things, you know,
[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:48.020]  wild mustard stemmed into so many different plants. And these things happen naturally,
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:52.420]  you know, it's evolution over time. And I'm sure that's the way it happened with cannabis.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:54:00.180]  Yeah, exactly. I think it's mostly because of mutations, you know, natural mutations that
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:05.220]  happen over time and the selections of all the farmers, all the people that have been growing
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:11.860]  these plants for thousands of years. So they selected these, you know, outliers that the
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.900]  plants that they liked the most, and it created different varieties, different strains. That's
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:19.540]  evolution. Yeah. Epigenetics.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:26.820]  Epigenetics and epigenetics play a huge role in this. These are changes laid on top of the DNA
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:33.460]  that eventually changed the DNA of the plant. I guess that's not the best explanation for
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:39.940]  epigenetics, but epigenetic changes that happen over time and through the selection process
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:46.100]  definitely has played a role in how these things have changed because you can change, you can take
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:51.540]  one plant and grow it in one place and you can take it to a whole nother region that's high up
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.780]  somewhere or lower, and you're going to get a different expression. You could have those plants
[01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:59.860]  together and they won't look like the same plants. You know, that's the interesting thing with
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:05.540]  phenotypical variation, DNA and genotypes are locked in. That doesn't change. But if we're
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:12.900]  talking phenotype or chemotype, those things can change based on environment. If that helps anybody.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:21.980]  So this was from a while ago, but whatever you were saying a while ago, Aladdin Shana agrees.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.860]  Nice. Let's unmute you. But all right, let me find...
[01:55:40.230 --> 01:55:46.470]  This guy wants to get into the club. Well, you got to hit him up at... Let me put up your
[01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:55.270]  Instagram. Whoops, sorry, you're muted. You got to unmute yourself.
[01:55:56.550 --> 01:56:00.230]  Yeah, farmer danger me. Hit me up and we'll talk about it.
[01:56:00.230 --> 01:56:09.480]  All right. Let me... You guys see that one?
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:29.820]  How many atrophistic traits appear in cannabis? I'm not sure. But you know, it's interesting
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:35.980]  talking about traits. We can go into the way the plant expresses. We're finding some really
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:42.620]  weird and interesting things, mutations that people are capturing in clone form.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:49.580]  You guys seen that ugly bastard by any chance? If you've seen it online, it's like
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:54.860]  the craziest looking plant ever. And you know, there's going to be stuff that has mutations like
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:57:00.540]  that for sure. I've grown freak show this year. Are you familiar with that one?
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:03.260]  Freak show? Yeah, I saw it. I've seen it. Never seen it personally.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:11.820]  I grew it this year. I think it could be a really useful tool perhaps even for extraction
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:20.140]  because the buds were super airy. And it looks like a carrot.
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.140]  Looks like a carrot. Yeah.
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:24.460]  Yeah, that's the one.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:27.420]  They're nice.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:31.580]  Are the seeds nice? Are they kind of round and almost light in color?
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.720]  Peter, you're muted.
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:45.160]  Yeah. They actually look like... Yeah, they don't look like normal seeds. Let me... Hold
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:47.400]  on. Let me take a picture and then I'll post it.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:53.160]  So I have a question for you guys. I've noticed that different varieties that the seeds have
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:59.800]  different looks to them. And regardless of what you cross it into, you can almost tell like
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.120]  what seed... Like with the seed, you can tell like what variety it is. Do you know
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:11.640]  what I'm talking about, Aladdin? Hold on. He's muted. Let me... There you go.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.720]  Go for it. Sorry. Can you ask the question again?
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.560]  Yeah. I was saying I've noticed that with different varieties, the seeds tend to look
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:29.640]  completely different. And that you can almost... If you mix them together, you can tell what seeds
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:36.280]  were from each path. You notice that? Yeah, definitely. For example, the size of the
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:43.960]  Laotian colsomar that we've been working on, the seeds are giant. And the Moroccan bildia,
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:51.080]  the Moroccan lindris, the seeds are tiny, teeny tiny. So the shapes can vary, but the size as well,
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:59.080]  the patterns, everything. And people used to say that a good quality seed should have tiger
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:06.920]  stripes and be dark. But that's not really true. It just... It all comes down to the strain.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.640]  So there's the... I don't know if you guys can see that.
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:22.280]  Yeah. Yeah. I tried to do my own freak show seeds and they all came out super light and that
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:29.320]  kind of interesting round color. I was curious if that's... Yeah. Yeah. And indoor versus outdoor
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:35.560]  cultivation as far as producing seeds, you can yield different shapes. Not even different shapes
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:43.960]  as much as different size seeds. I feel like high pressure lights, basically they create bud calyx
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:49.560]  that's so tight that actually you'll get smaller shape, smaller size seeds producing them indoors
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:54.040]  as outdoors. If you typically look at the guys, company like Homegrown Natural Wonders,
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:59.240]  the old TGA stuff, those were monster seeds. It's because they did all their breeding.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:13.600]  You still live, Peter? Yeah. You cut out for a second, James. You froze for a second.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.400]  Okay. So yeah, I was just talking about how the seeds grown outdoors, TGA,
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:24.640]  Sunny Chiba, Homegrown Natural Wonders, those guys that exclusively do outdoor regular breeding,
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:28.720]  their seeds are so much bigger than... And then if you look at my seeds, I have a lot of small
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:34.160]  seeds. Some are tiger stripes, some are not. And it's very, very cultivar specific.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:39.760]  Yeah. And just quickly, the freak show seeds look like cilantro seeds.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:44.800]  So if you know what cilantro seeds look like or just look them up, that's kind of what they look
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:52.240]  like. Do you find any difference in quality of indoor versus outdoor produced seeds?
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.240]  Honestly, I wouldn't say that you're going to get better quality either way.
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.840]  I would say that if you're breeding for indoor... A lot of people say you're breeding for indoor
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:08.800]  growers grow and make the seeds indoors. If you're talking about outdoor, you can make the seeds
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:14.880]  outdoor and acclimate them. Personally, I like the environmental controls you have of indoor,
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.640]  especially for something like autoflock. I prefer making them indoor because you're able to control
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:30.400]  the variables. But it's all opinion. That's my perspective on it. I do like breeding outdoors as
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.200]  well. The thing with breeding outdoors, you can make so many more seeds. If you make big plants,
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:40.400]  you know, my plants indoors have an average of 2000 seeds per plant. If you go take something
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:46.640]  like that outdoor, you can have 8000, 10,000. I've heard of 80,000 seeds on one plant before.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.820]  That was a loud ding. Was that for you?
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.780]  Yeah, that's my timer.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:02.620]  That's the time's up timer. So just quickly, someone asked if there's any love for forbidden
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:03.260]  fruit anymore.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:07.740]  So forbidden fruit is beautiful, man. I just it's, it's not the stronger part,
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:08.940]  but the flavor is great.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.820]  Is that your we need to end timer?
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:16.300]  No, that's people texting me time or they need to stop.
[02:02:18.700 --> 02:02:24.060]  My only beef with forbidden fruit lately is that it feels like the dermal layer is kind of thin on
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:30.460]  the on the plants and that it's always just the first one to get out of mildew. The first one to
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:36.220]  get powder mildew in the garden. So that's that's the reason why it's not on my list anymore.
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.100]  But as far as smoke, I feel like it's an interesting thing. I love the tangy in it.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:45.340]  I feel like it's not as tangy as tangy, which tangy is just kind of played out.
[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:48.460]  Tangy had a smoke. Yeah, smoke for sure.
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:52.940]  And as far as an extra, it's a great extract. Yeah, purple tangy and forbidden fruit,
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:57.340]  which are very, very similar. They're great extract strains. You smoke a live resin pen
[02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:01.100]  of them and they taste fantastic and the effect is good. Yeah, for sure.
[02:03:04.130 --> 02:03:07.170]  What else we got, Peter? Any other interesting questions before we call it?
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:18.240]  Well, let's quickly touch on. Oh, wait. Here's a good one.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.440]  So how many generations would it take to make a full auto flower seed that are mostly going
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:34.280]  to be auto from a photo period cultivar? So basically, for generations, you're going to
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:40.120]  get stuff that mostly expresses auto flower. The fifth, I honestly think as you get closer to six
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.720]  or seven is where you really want to be before you start releasing seeds, although pretty much
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:51.720]  everybody releases them as an F4, F5. You know, it's the further you go away from it, the better
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:57.800]  it is. But by the time you're at F7, everything F6, F5, you're getting full expression.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.880]  If you do the selection correctly, that's another thing. It's like selection with breeding is
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:09.000]  everything, especially with autos. You really, you don't have to, the plants to keep them alive.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.240]  So you're doing your selections from your progeny. So as you're breeding these plants
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:20.120]  and making seeds, part of this, the seed making process is doing your selection for that next
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.760]  round. So if you have a hundred plants, you're going to go around as you're making the seeds
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:29.560]  and you're going to select the ones that you're using for the next generation. And, you know,
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:33.480]  that's the true breeders, the guys that are breeding really good auto flowers. The difference
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:37.160]  with those guys is they're doing that process. They're not just buying some seeds from this guy
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:43.480]  and from this guy and making an F1 hybrid. They're actually going in and selecting their plants
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:47.400]  that they're using for each generation. And it will get better each generation. The guys that
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:54.040]  buy seeds from fast buds, from Mephisto and fast buds to create a new cultivar, those guys haven't
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:57.480]  done any selection. And so their seeds are probably not going to be as good as either one
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:03.160]  of the parents. So that's the real thing is taking and finding your, your keepers and your winners.
[02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:07.480]  You know, it's like you go through and then you pop a hundred seeds that next generation,
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:12.040]  your seeds should be better because you selected either the outliers or those ones that are going
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:17.160]  to be better with structure, terpene profile, all those things. You're doing a selection process.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.840]  You're not a pollen checker anymore. You're doing actual breeding and to make good auto
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:23.400]  flowers, it requires actual breeding. There's no way around it.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:32.880]  So I was told to stop muting the master. So Aladdin, your thoughts.
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.840]  Now, can you guys hear me?
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:39.860]  Yep.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:45.360]  I just had a, I just had a question for James, because I've been following you on Instagram
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.200]  and you've got some beautiful, you know, auto strains, auto pictures. So I was wondering,
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:56.640]  how do you go about stabilizing your, your autos? Cause you can't really keep a male and
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.400]  a female because it's auto. So how can you stabilize the line?
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:06.160]  Well, it's through a selection. You know, there's things like stress testing involved,
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.160]  but it's through a selection process and it takes a long time to create a good auto flower strain.
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:17.760]  It's important to start with good genetics. I feel like Mephisto creates an amazing product. Like
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:22.160]  they're, they're a great starting point for people that want to start breeding autos using
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:27.600]  the Mephisto specifically is kind of where that was my starting point. And now going and taking
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:32.800]  some of the stuff that I've created and trying to stabilize like gelato, for instance, it takes
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:39.040]  several generations, but in each progeny, you have to be very specifically going for those terpene
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:43.840]  profiles so that you don't get stuff that smells like Jack Herrera, you know, those hazes, because
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:49.040]  some of that terpenoline limonene can come in your progeny. And it's, so it's really difficult
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:55.520]  in the sense that all of your progeny doesn't smell the same as far as terpene profile. And
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.480]  there's so much genetic diversity. You have to narrow that through inbreeding through,
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:05.520]  through your IBL that you're trying to create each generation. You're looking specifically first for
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:10.240]  terpene profile. Then within the terpene profile, you're looking for structure because if you go
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:14.640]  just on terpene profile, you're going to get a weak plant. So you have to have that fine balance.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:21.360]  And each time you have an opportunity to improve upon it. And so that's the thing is like having
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:26.000]  a good team, whether it's you or whether it's you and your partners, having people that know what
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.720]  they're looking for, because you're looking for very specific things. I mean, terpene profile,
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.120]  obviously, if you're breeding, let's say you're making a gelato auto, true gelato auto, there's
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:39.840]  other people doing it. I'll have one out next year, that's going to be as close to gelato as I
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:44.720]  think you can get with auto flower. But the process has been challenging because some of the
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:50.000]  stuff I start with gas with my auto flowers. So I really like to have that gas because I feel like
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:55.520]  gas just adds to every strain, especially if you're looking for stuff in the US market in California,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:01.920]  you want your varieties to have gas. And so having that gas as a backbone is a beautiful thing.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:06.240]  But with each generation, you know, you're crossing these things together. So you got gelato.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:09.920]  Now you have to have something with gelato and gas, but it really has to have gelato each
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:14.960]  generation. And it also you know, because you're using all those seeds, then it's just luck of the
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:20.000]  draw within the seeds from that one plant that you're using to breed. So with the F threes,
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:24.640]  the F fours, the F fives, you're looking for that gelato trait first, then you're looking for the
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:30.000]  structure that accommodates that terpene profile. So if that answers your question,
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:38.880]  thank you very much. It sounds like it's a slow process. It takes a lot longer than
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.240]  stabilizing the landrys, you know, because it's already pretty stable. So yeah, an auto is a lot
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.440]  more work. I mean, it takes a lot of time and years, right? Years, it takes years to do it
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:56.320]  correctly. Anyone can make a new auto F1. But the thing is, is like, if you want to make a Skittles,
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.400]  or you want to make a Runtz, or you want to make any of these exotic strains auto,
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.560]  it doesn't happen overnight. This is something that takes, you know, it could take several years,
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.680]  it depends on your timeframe. But if you figure 100 days for every seed run, and you want to go
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:17.840]  to F4, that's a minimum of 400 days minimum of 400 to get to an F4 500 days to go to an F5.
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:23.360]  So and that's, that's if you were just making them back to back, you know what I mean,
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.720]  without breaks. And in you know, some of the stuff we do, we're growing stuff out after that. So it's
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.280]  100 days, plus it's an additional 70 days to see how the plants expressed that we're making seeds
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:39.040]  for before you can even sell the seed, you know, so within those generations, and what I believe
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:44.080]  is doing, you know, you got to use decent sized numbers to you can't just make, you know, make
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:52.000]  seeds from 10 seeds and expect to get good results. So someone wants an auto sourd line. So this has
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.800]  been brought up several times in the last like six to eight months. Auto sourd great, I think
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:05.360]  we got some gas, I'm not specifically working on an auto sourd, although we did some, you know,
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:13.200]  F1, basically semi autos with the sour, I think sour is a tricky plant. Once we capture the
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:17.280]  terpene profile, and there's other people working on some good sourd lines right now, you know,
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.960]  whether it's top dog or karma, they both, you know, I think we had the original sourd that
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:28.720]  was pretty solid back in the day seed form. But it's a real challenging thing. So you know,
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.520]  I'm not specifically working on that I'm more working on the exotic market right now.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:40.640]  So there are tons of questions. I don't know if you guys want to call it or you want to do a
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:46.320]  couple more. How are you guys feeling? One more question. All right. And now and then we'll just
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:52.000]  quickly talk about your, your glulato. So all right, here's the last one.
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:11:02.060]  Do male plants pass the auto flower trace? Yes, male plants and it's a gene that basically it's
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:07.500]  an allele that gets passed on from either parent, you can pass it on from the donor or the receiver.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:11.660]  And you know, we talked about them as donor and receiver because I make feminized seeds. With
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:19.340]  auto flower, I only make feminized seeds. You know, there's, there's good reasons that people
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:24.940]  would want to make regular seeds. But for me, I look at is a commercially viable product. And
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:29.180]  down the line, people are not going to want to buy an auto flower regular seed because if they're
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:34.060]  planting an acre, they're not going to want to separate males, that's just not going to happen.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:39.180]  And so it's, it's they auto flowers reverse fairly easily. But yeah, it passes on the
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:46.380]  allele gets passed on from either donor or receiver. So and then actually just quickly,
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:55.020]  because this has come up, people are definitely looking for that. So THC breeding is the THC.
[02:11:56.060 --> 02:12:02.300]  Right now THC is considered hemp for people that aren't aware. You know, it's not a delta nine THC.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:10.940]  THC V is in its pure form. Now, I think there are companies that are working towards THC V
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:15.340]  seeds, viable seeds that will be available probably next year. I know one of my good
[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:22.780]  friends is working on some THC V stuff. THC V is amazing. A lot of the THC V stuff comes in at like
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:31.100]  a percentage of its THC, delta nine THC comes in with THC A and delta nine plus THC V.
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:37.420]  So those are going to be interesting. Somebody's going to auto flower that for sure. And but the
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:42.220]  thing is, is it's a trendy thing who we don't know the commercial viability of it yet either.
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:46.220]  It could be amazing. It could be something that's really trendy right now that goes away. I mean,
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:51.500]  if you look at the hemp market, man, hemp, hemp just took a dive and a lot of people lost money
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:56.940]  and lost their jobs. And, you know, farmers, farmers lost everything, banking on hemp. And
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:01.980]  then CBG was the new thing. And CBG is not hot like it was anymore either. I mean, CBG seeds
[02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:05.580]  were selling for five dollars a piece at one point, and now you can get them for a dollar.
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:12.780]  CBG is also a precursor, which is it's really interesting as well. So if you have the
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:16.780]  opportunity to grow some CBG, it grows like regular cannabis. The plants look amazing
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:23.260]  and it's considered hemp. So, yeah, so we'll call that for the show today, man,
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:29.980]  I really appreciate you guys being on here. Well, just quickly before we go, tell us a little bit
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:37.900]  about what this is. So that right there is Glulato. So I have a new partnership with my friend Tim
[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:43.340]  from Canna Organics and my friend Andrew from Estera Farms. We're kind of working on some new
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:47.900]  projects, but the Glulato is from a company that we're forming called Loud Cannagenics.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:54.460]  And so we're doing all kinds of R&D on stuff. We got some Gelato 41 crosses coming out.
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:06.300]  Stuff has been thoroughly tested. So this Glulato is a Gorilla Glue number four, the GG4 times the
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:13.900]  Gelato 41. And what you're doing is getting stuff that's similar to both parents. You'll find stuff
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:18.940]  in the progeny when you pop seeds that leans towards the Gorilla Glue, some leans towards
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:24.220]  the Gelato 41. So you're getting some floral stuff with some of that real funky chocolate
[02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:35.260]  notes with gas in it. It's a good yielding strain. And as far as note spacing, it's been
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:41.900]  stress tested environments with PM and I feel like it's fairly PM resistant. So they are available
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.980]  right now. We're doing a free label release even on Peter's site. But you want to get them before
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:54.860]  anybody else. They're available today right now. We're doing 10 packs and soon, I guess every week,
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:58.620]  I've been talking to Peter about this, but every week we'll be releasing something new for you guys.
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:02.140]  So we're going to have some stuff that's affordable and some of the stuff that's the
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:07.260]  new new that's not really attainable anywhere else. So yeah, if you guys have questions about
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:13.900]  some of the new varieties, you can DM me on Instagram or you can email me jamesloudgenetics
[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:21.420]  at gmail.com. But yeah, we're talking about high yield stuff. Just to touch on my breeding for the
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:30.140]  last couple years, I did a pheno hunting project in Arizona with a group out there. And we had
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:35.660]  some of my seeds along with all the other top breeders. And we handpicked all these different
[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:42.620]  breeders seed varieties, and kind of did a pheno hunt with everybody's side by side. And it was it
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:48.060]  was a good humbling experience for me, I kind of learned where my flaws were as far as seed
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:53.420]  production on a level against everybody else's, you know, because I'm one of those guys, if you
[02:15:53.420 --> 02:15:58.700]  talk to me flavor first, I always flavor first. But in the real world, when we're talking about
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:04.220]  commercial companies that sell to dispensaries, where everything's disclosed, we're talking about
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:11.340]  terpene profiles not being as important as THC. And so I was talking with Tim from Canada organics,
[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:15.660]  this is before we kind of were talking about forming the company. And what I really needed
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:21.500]  to do was step my THC game up because I was so worried about terpene profile that I forgot about
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:28.540]  THC because THC is important to me, but it was more of a secondary or third thing behind other
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:36.060]  things. So we've really been working on having stuff that tests 25 to 35% THC that we can test
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:42.860]  that will work on that commercial level for, you know, commercial grows in the rec markets
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:50.460]  all over the United States. So the male there was no male we got a question, glulato. So the
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:57.180]  glulato, the gelato 41 was reversed, and we use the pollen from the gelato 41 and put that on
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:03.180]  on the gorilla glue. So there's actually a whole line of gelato 41 seeds that will be coming out
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:12.930]  coming to market relatively soon. Peter, you're muted.
[02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:21.090]  I've been muting and unmuting everyone else so much. But so yeah, with that,
[02:17:21.090 --> 02:17:25.970]  we can call it a wrap. You can pick up the glulato.
[02:17:26.930 --> 02:17:35.330]  Yeah, Peter, you want to do a giveaway real quick with one pack? We'll give away a 10.
[02:17:36.690 --> 02:17:44.370]  Let's do a giveaway real quick. First person that remembers what seed or what hat I had on
[02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:49.090]  on the last show, we're gonna go ahead and send them out.
[02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:51.170]  First of all, do you remember what hat you were wearing?
[02:17:52.930 --> 02:17:53.410]  Do you remember?
[02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:54.450]  We can look at it.
[02:17:55.090 --> 02:18:00.130]  Okay, well, then we have no idea. Okay, so someone. Good God.
[02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:11.250]  Okay, so what hat was James? So one son said same hat. You could be right.
[02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:13.090]  Could be right.
[02:18:15.570 --> 02:18:20.610]  Oh, yeah, James Butterson got loud. But it was, I think they all say the same thing,
[02:18:20.610 --> 02:18:24.450]  but they're different. Which team? How about that? That's the specificity.
[02:18:24.450 --> 02:18:28.290]  Yeah, let's go even further for that. So what was the other team hat that I wore
[02:18:28.850 --> 02:18:31.810]  before this hat? And that person is going to get a free 10 pack of seeds.
[02:18:33.090 --> 02:18:35.890]  That strong style said no hat. It's a trick question.
[02:18:39.810 --> 02:18:46.610]  That person gets a pack too. So I don't think I wore a hat on the show with energy.
[02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:50.210]  So then the person who answers the right team.
[02:18:52.530 --> 02:18:56.530]  Yeah, we're looking for team colors. It's a big hint.
[02:18:57.970 --> 02:19:00.130]  They're basically only like four teams that can be.
[02:19:01.970 --> 02:19:03.570]  Oh, even better. It's a Bay Area team.
[02:19:08.210 --> 02:19:10.770]  My God, Flora Nugs, I think you're the winner.
[02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:15.330]  Okay, Flora Nugs. Peter will get the information. We'll get seeds sent out to you.
[02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:24.290]  Hit me up, peter at future cannabis project dot o r g. And you will get your free pack of
[02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:33.570]  glulado, which can also be found here. And to our panelists from around the world, starting in Spain.
[02:19:35.090 --> 02:19:36.370]  Thank you guys very much.
[02:19:37.170 --> 02:19:38.850]  Yeah, thank you guys. Really appreciate it.
[02:19:39.410 --> 02:19:40.210]  I'll talk to you guys.
[02:19:40.210 --> 02:19:41.010]  So much, guys.
[02:19:42.130 --> 02:19:43.810]  And thanks for having me.
[02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:45.330]  Thank you.
[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:47.650]  Yeah, we had like 500 people watching.
[02:19:50.130 --> 02:19:50.610]  But, uh,
[02:19:53.570 --> 02:20:00.450]  oh, yeah, so other people are now on the athletics train. But nice win, Flora. We agree. And
[02:20:00.450 --> 02:20:07.330]  hopefully Flora will take some pictures and post them on Instagram. When it flowers.
[02:20:08.770 --> 02:20:09.890]  Yes, guys. Appreciate it.
[02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:17.410]  That's our timer. That was a good, good timer on on cue. All right. I guess James just disappeared.
[02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:24.530]  We could keep going. All right. Well, thanks to the two of you. That was awesome. And I'll check
[02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:31.170]  if you guys want to put stuff up here. Let me know and and but I'll just send me an email.
[02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:36.690]  All right. Thank you guys for having me on. It was a pleasure. Thank you very much.
[02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:38.690]  All right. See you guys.
[02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:46.130]  Yeah. Peter. Thanks a lot. And I will kill the live stream. Thanks, everyone.
[02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:49.730]  Oh, wait. Sorry. So actually, you guys can go. I just have some wrap up stuff.
[02:20:53.580 --> 02:21:00.060]  So just quick, I'm trying to think of Tuesday night, we have a another fundraiser.
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:08.380]  Seattle Chronic, I believe is emceeing that. And then Thursday night, we have
[02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:21.020]  Kaia Paul with a whole solventless crew and we have musical guests. I'm actually blanking on
[02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:27.980]  I'm actually blanking on the musical guest, Nick P. What's my email? It's just Peter at
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:37.900]  future cannabis. Jack, now I got yelled at last night because my two year old, who I thought was
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:46.220]  in bed, walked into the garage at like eight forty while I was ripping tubes out of the bong. But
[02:21:46.700 --> 02:21:54.460]  anyway, so the Lime Arilla, Brandon shipped it out, I believe, Thursday or Friday.
[02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:03.820]  Yeah. So sorry. Thursday night. Let me you know what? Kaia posted what Thursday was. So just let
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:12.700]  me because we have a good musical guest and just give me one second while I go to Instagram.
[02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:28.800]  Go to Instagram. OK. Let's do there we go, Pacific Northwest Roots with musical guest
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:40.960]  Josh Heinrichs. So let me. Hold on a second, Josh Heinrichs, there we go. So check out his
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:47.040]  Instagram and listen to some of his music. He's going to be playing some songs on Thursday night.
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:54.440]  Around that guy.
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:04.440]  Why, buddy? Yeah, they shipped and so, yeah, we've been, as I said in an email to some people who
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:13.640]  ordered early seeds, the logistic shipping and delivery constipation is hopefully so some people
[02:23:13.640 --> 02:23:30.740]  know who Josh is. I was I was actually thinking about that. Nowhere, or at least not right now,
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:39.300]  it's out. And so Aladdin, who's still watching, I think you're still paying. There he is. Let's
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:47.300]  bring you back. All right. People like hearing from you. Thank you. So what do you guys want to
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:54.660]  know? Is this the bonus round now? We can call it a day for now, but but I think if you want to if
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:24:00.500]  you want to come back. So you're you're basically it's one twenty four in the afternoon in L.A.
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:06.500]  So what time is it for you here? It's ten twenty four. And are you a night owl? Like do you stay
[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:11.620]  up late? Yeah, kind of. Not really. Not really. Not. OK. All right. But yeah. So maybe one day.
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:16.180]  I mean, I'll ping you and you can jump on and or if there's something actually if there's anyone
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:22.580]  you'd love to chop it up with. Wow. Anyone you want to talk to and just shoot the shit with,
[02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:27.700]  let me know. And we'll yeah. Breeders in general. James Loud breeders. Yeah.
[02:24:28.260 --> 02:24:35.700]  We'll pick whoever you want and we'll lock in a day. Thank you very much. Yeah. So here we go.
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:48.890]  Thank you. The people have spoken. And then what? Well, that's kind of a hard question for you.
[02:24:48.890 --> 02:24:54.810]  It's like, what's your best cultivar? But what what what are you what do you have the most fun with
[02:24:55.130 --> 02:25:04.650]  growing recently? So growing, I would say the Uzbek. I like the Uzbek because it's semi
[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:10.810]  auto flowering. So a bit like the Moroccan, not for the same reason, but it's kind of tricky to
[02:25:10.810 --> 02:25:15.690]  work with because you can't really keep the plants. It's kind of tricky to keep them in
[02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:21.610]  veg. You know, you have to keep transplanting, you know, all the time. As soon as you see that
[02:25:22.170 --> 02:25:27.850]  the plant is starting to flower, you've cut off the roots, you cut, you trim the root ball and
[02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:32.170]  then you transplant and then you can keep it in veg. But it's kind of funny because, you know,
[02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:37.930]  you can have it flower early outdoors and and turf wise is great as well.
[02:25:39.930 --> 02:25:45.450]  So Farrah Dinkum wanted to know, can polyploid plants be stabilized?
[02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:47.610]  I'm not sure about that.
[02:25:49.450 --> 02:25:55.610]  Got it. OK, well, why don't we we can wrap it. OK, but.
[02:25:57.530 --> 02:26:02.010]  Well, I'd like to thank you, Peter, for having me on. It was great. It was very interesting.
[02:26:02.810 --> 02:26:07.210]  Cool. Thanks for doing it. And I will hopefully talk to you soon.
[02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:11.770]  Hopefully, man. All right. Have a good day. You too.
[02:26:11.850 --> 02:26:21.930]  Take care. Bye. All right. We'll we'll leave on Brad's
[02:26:24.810 --> 02:26:27.370]  comments. But yeah, so as far as I know,
[02:26:29.370 --> 02:26:34.890]  the next technically scheduled thing is Tuesday night's fundraiser.
[02:26:35.850 --> 02:26:47.160]  Yeah, he left, so. But when he comes back, we can talk about other stuff.
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:57.080]  And then Thursday during the day, it's it's Brian and Leighton and I don't know who we've
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:09.480]  locked in for this week. Chad Wick, I agree. Whoops. And yeah, he's in I think he's near
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:19.720]  Valencia, he said. We got some more in addition to Greg, seems like old fashioned coffee pot may
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:27.000]  also be in Hawaii. So interestingly, I was thinking of creating a shared Google calendar
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:31.800]  that I can just post shit as it because it all comes up so last minute and people can just see
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:38.440]  what's what's up. So people think a shared Google account and then I'm like, where can I put it?
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:48.920]  Would be a good idea. So Greg on the polyploid and I, I trust Greg.
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:55.800]  Thank you, boomers, buds. All right, well, I'm going to go hang out with my two year old before
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:01.560]  she goes down for a nap. Oh, yeah. Chad Wick is going to help out on the breeder discord and we
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:12.920]  will post. Let me see if I still have that queued up. No, I don't. Good God. Let me repost. I got
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:21.080]  to go to discord, open it in my browser and Chad Wick knows how to use discord much more than I do.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:26.680]  So. Sorry. Yeah, that's the breeding one.
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:33.320]  So that's the breeding one. And actually, why don't we just run down the line?
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:37.640]  This is the.
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.920]  Soil one, so cultivation for those.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.680]  Who like their roots in soil.
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:51.880]  And then we have.
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:57.000]  For those who are on the hydro tip.
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:28:59.800]  We have the.
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:01.240]  We have the.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:11.370]  Loosely combined cocoa hydro. And for those who are.
[02:29:14.490 --> 02:29:24.570]  Into the solventless game and making hash. We have the solventless discord.
[02:29:25.370 --> 02:29:36.280]  And then if anybody has ideas of other message boards you'd like to see, let me know.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.080]  Thinking of doing a glass one, but.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:43.160]  Anyway, jump on over the discord.
[02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.720]  I'm going to jump upstairs to go hang out.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:51.320]  With my daughter.
[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:52.360]  With my daughter.
[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.040]  Yes, when I can figure that out, actually, why don't I?
[02:29:58.040 --> 02:30:01.320]  All right, while we're all sitting here, you can all watch me try to figure that out.
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:07.080]  Let us see.
[02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:12.200]  On the discord, on the discord.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.720]  Where are you discord?
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:21.400]  Actually, I could probably just do it in the web one.
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:27.640]  All right, breeding genetics, edit channel.
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.760]  Permissions. There we go.
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.120]  Advanced permissions.
[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:45.460]  We'll see how many people stick around with me as I.
[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:51.000]  All right, let's go back to there. He's going to tell me that.
[02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:57.720]  No problem. Thank you, genetic memory.
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:02.280]  And whatever it seems like someone mentioned earlier that you did something.
[02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:08.120]  I can't remember what it was, but if you want to come talk about it, hit me up.
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:08.680]  Let me know.
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:19.400]  All right, I still have not figured out the discord.
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:22.120]  How do you add someone as an admin?
[02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.910]  Yeah, well, all right.
[02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:29.670]  So everybody cheer Greg on.
[02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:34.790]  Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg.
[02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:36.630]  How about Greg and Ben together?
[02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:39.350]  Greg, would you want to interview Ben?
[02:31:44.250 --> 02:31:46.090]  We got DJ short.
[02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:52.490]  Server rules. Thank you, slime bucket.
[02:31:52.490 --> 02:31:52.810]  All right.
[02:31:55.690 --> 02:31:57.610]  Good guy. So it's not in channel.
[02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:01.930]  All right, well, I'm not going to make you all.
[02:32:02.890 --> 02:32:05.610]  Watch me be an idiot on.
[02:32:08.410 --> 02:32:10.890]  Unless you want to, but anyway.
[02:32:14.010 --> 02:32:19.690]  OK, and what Chadwick was talking about in the chat a while ago was we're going to do a.
[02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:28.410]  The thought was an all day Black Friday breeder marathon, but then I.
[02:32:28.970 --> 02:32:34.090]  Figured my wife would rip my head off, so it could be the following Monday,
[02:32:34.090 --> 02:32:36.570]  which would only be Saturday, Sunday, three days later.
[02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:40.970]  OK, Crockett.
[02:32:43.290 --> 02:32:45.370]  Kelly, can I had.
[02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:47.930]  Swerve.
[02:32:50.010 --> 02:32:55.130]  Actually, I speak at an event in Venice before lockdown.
[02:32:55.850 --> 02:32:56.490]  Yeah, we'll get it.
[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:00.360]  We'll figure it out.
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:08.880]  Yes, Greg.
[02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:15.840]  Yeah, there are certain people who who who that's like Steve D'Angelo.
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:21.840]  The joke is he he never met a camera and microphone that he that he didn't love.
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:26.960]  There are certain personality types, it's funny because I never had any expectation
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:34.880]  to be doing these, but it's kind of like that's why I love when James does his show because.
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:39.760]  I don't really have to talk or do anything.
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:46.320]  Yeah, note to self save up for Black Monday sale.
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:47.840]  And yeah, we'll get some.
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:52.560]  I think James is going to make some more hats and I'm going to make some hats.
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:57.040]  Robin David, who are Robin David?
[02:33:58.320 --> 02:33:58.880]  Let's see.
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:20.380]  OK, so anyway, I'm going to master discord.
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:22.480]  And.
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:27.760]  Yeah, and I think, Greg, you wanted a loud hat, right?
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:37.290]  So what I told I'm just overwhelmed with shit right now.
[02:34:37.850 --> 02:34:39.530]  I told him it'd probably be a minute.
[02:34:42.910 --> 02:34:43.710]  Oh, yeah, no.
[02:34:43.710 --> 02:34:46.590]  So so Dave wants to come on.
[02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:51.950]  So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and I'm
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:55.870]  going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
[02:34:56.670 --> 02:35:00.110]  come on and I've been talking to him about coming on.
[02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:04.110]  Yeah, this would be cool.
[02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:07.390]  And I'm actually supposed to.
[02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:10.910]  What's app, Dave?
[02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:16.830]  I can't, I don't really said tomorrow, but anyway.
[02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:25.630]  Yeah, rob Rob's a little more
[02:35:25.630 --> 02:35:32.270]  buttoned up about being spontaneous and just talking shop. Mel, I agree.
[02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:39.870]  He's been actually we again before lockdown, Mel came and spoke at an event.
[02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:48.350]  I did in LA downtown. But yeah, I'd love to. So Greg, would it entice you to
[02:35:49.150 --> 02:35:54.350]  be the one to ask any of these guys questions? Or is there no way I can ever get you to
[02:35:55.710 --> 02:36:08.610]  to jump on with us? Let's see if Greg. I'm trying to gently nudge you.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:20.360]  So I got to check back in with Dan that was supposed to be a weekly show. And then
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:26.440]  I think the fires hit and he was on the East Coast. And
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:36.200]  now does that mean I am here and available to help and jump on or just is that more just a
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:49.550]  state of mind thing? Top floor is asking Elka to join the discord.
[02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:58.250]  I guess I could post that again. No, no.
[02:36:58.890 --> 02:37:15.730]  OK. All right. Well, I'm going to go. And yeah, that is true. Greg is always in the chat. That's
[02:37:15.730 --> 02:37:21.170]  why I love this, Greg. Whenever you say stuff in the chat, I generally just post it up on the screen.
[02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:30.930]  But I think a lot of people what I've said, what I said to like Jordan, who is freak show,
[02:37:31.650 --> 02:37:37.090]  who's the guy behind freak show, he came on and my kind of point to him was,
[02:37:37.810 --> 02:37:43.330]  I know you're not about publicity or you don't care or whatever, but like if you could influence
[02:37:43.330 --> 02:37:49.570]  or inspire one person by just hearing what you have to say to me, that's kind of the important
[02:37:49.730 --> 02:38:00.770]  thing. I think a lot of people would appreciate. So what you your insights and kind of your
[02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:09.570]  what you think about when you think about cannabis. Yeah, so rare dankness.
[02:38:09.890 --> 02:38:16.050]  I Scott was supposed to come on and then there was a medical.
[02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:22.370]  Thankfully, OK, now, but there was a medical issue and we had to postpone it and
[02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:27.570]  haven't rescheduled it, but it's going to be him and Kevin Jodri. So I'll.
[02:38:30.130 --> 02:38:37.170]  Try to reschedule that one. Greg, you want a little Matt riot? Well, that's why someone was
[02:38:37.170 --> 02:38:41.970]  joking him in the sonic and I don't know what the I never know what to believe with like.
[02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:47.970]  I don't know, people are saying Matt Steel stuff and then I don't know quite what the
[02:38:49.090 --> 02:39:03.250]  beefs are, but. Anyway. And I keep hearing the discord dinging in my earphones right now, but
[02:39:03.250 --> 02:39:11.890]  anyway, I'm going to go. We could go back on. Yeah, it was going to be epic.
[02:39:13.490 --> 02:39:18.850]  I was excited for it. So, yeah, I'll see if I can make that happen again.
[02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:34.760]  Yeah, no, that's that's why. Spot check, do you want it? Are these people you want to talk to?
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:42.760]  Because I could definitely use the help of other people who want to run the conversations.
[02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:58.530]  Yes, I agree, Alex. Thank you. All right. I'll I will see you guys maybe sometime soon. And Alex,
[02:39:58.530 --> 02:40:04.210]  you're going to come on and talk old school. Actually, I have someone who used to go to I
[02:40:05.090 --> 02:40:14.210]  don't know if it was Utah State or where, but in the early 90s, he used to smuggle weed in from
[02:40:14.210 --> 02:40:21.970]  Humboldt to sell to basically whatever whichever college you went to, which I thought was a funny
[02:40:21.970 --> 02:40:33.970]  story. All right. So who is he? If on Instagram you just look for Masonic Smoker.
[02:40:37.010 --> 02:40:43.890]  He was on or actually be just on YouTube, go back a couple episodes. He was he was the guest.
[02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:48.290]  Thank you, Tara. Well, I told you before, organize something, just hit me up and say,
[02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:54.690]  I got two people lined up and we can go to 2 p.m. on Tuesday or whatever and we'll do it. So,
[02:40:56.290 --> 02:41:04.050]  yeah, only. So, all right, well, I'm going to go hang out and eat the second half of the
[02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:11.570]  bacon, egg and cheese that was lunch. So see you.
