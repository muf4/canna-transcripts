[00:01.720 --> 00:16.000]  Hello, everyone.
[00:16.000 --> 00:21.360]  Thank you so much for coming to hear our little discussion.
[00:21.360 --> 00:27.520]  And I'll let Dr. Andrea start with telling you a little bit about her story, then we'll
[00:27.520 --> 00:31.840]  kind of hear a little bit about mine, and then you'll be able to notice the difference
[00:31.840 --> 00:36.480]  of where we're coming from, but also talking about one particular topic.
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.480]  So, yeah.
[00:37.480 --> 00:47.390]  So, one of the things that we're talking is that despite the fact that on paper our backgrounds
[00:47.390 --> 00:51.590]  look incredibly different, we agree on a lot of fundamental issues that are germane to
[00:51.590 --> 00:58.230]  the topic today, which is understanding sort of the cannabis strain fingerprint.
[00:58.230 --> 01:03.770]  So even though I sort of am in the more biomedical background, I believe that truly understanding
[01:03.770 --> 01:06.410]  cannabis as medicine starts with the plant.
[01:06.410 --> 01:12.250]  And so in my role at GB Sciences, we have been dedicated to creating standardized raw
[01:12.250 --> 01:15.310]  materials that we provide to customers.
[01:15.310 --> 01:22.210]  We have operations in both Nevada and in Louisiana, where we hold licenses to cultivate, produce
[01:22.210 --> 01:25.690]  oils and make finished products for sale in those markets.
[01:25.690 --> 01:30.610]  And so when I'm talking to you today, I'm wearing two hats.
[01:30.610 --> 01:33.050]  I'm wearing the hat of we're part of the industry.
[01:33.050 --> 01:38.450]  We're part of the supply chain of cannabis materials that go to the patients in medical
[01:38.450 --> 01:42.170]  markets, as well as to the folks in adult use markets like Nevada.
[01:42.170 --> 01:46.690]  But at the same time at GB Sciences, we've also taken the position that it's not enough
[01:46.690 --> 01:53.290]  to just create standardized products, that we also wanted to verify safety and potential
[01:53.290 --> 01:55.370]  effectiveness through research.
[01:55.370 --> 01:59.050]  And so to that end, we have sponsored research with nine different universities where we're
[01:59.050 --> 02:02.570]  trying to get at...
[02:02.570 --> 02:05.730]  The cannabis plant is full of lots of different compounds.
[02:05.730 --> 02:09.930]  And anyone who tells you cannabis is one thing is missing the point.
[02:09.930 --> 02:16.450]  So we're trying to get at this great mystery of how do you align strains with particular
[02:16.450 --> 02:19.890]  diseases or particular symptoms that we need to treat?
[02:19.890 --> 02:25.370]  And the only way to do that is in controlled trials, but those take many formats in different
[02:25.370 --> 02:26.370]  just jurisdictions.
[02:26.370 --> 02:28.130]  So that's kind of a complicated thing.
[02:28.210 --> 02:33.130]  But today what we're here to talk about is strains and the chemical components of strains,
[02:33.130 --> 02:35.570]  which we're calling a fingerprint.
[02:35.570 --> 02:38.090]  But do know that we're coming at this both from a place of...
[02:38.090 --> 02:43.250]  I'm coming at this from both a place of we grow, as well as we do research.
[02:43.250 --> 02:45.250]  So it has a little bit of a different...
[02:45.250 --> 02:49.050]  I have a different perspective on it than Pepper, but I think we agree on a lot of the
[02:49.050 --> 02:50.050]  essential things.
[02:50.050 --> 02:51.050]  So Pepper?
[02:51.050 --> 02:52.050]  Thank you.
[02:52.050 --> 02:53.050]  Very well said.
[02:53.050 --> 02:59.610]  So I'm coming from the angle of I am a naturopathic holistic practitioner in Humboldt County.
[02:59.610 --> 03:05.050]  So most of the patients I have or clients that I have or students that I have in the
[03:05.050 --> 03:10.690]  cannabis program for the Cannabis Holistic Institute are coming in with multiple different
[03:10.690 --> 03:15.690]  disease, disailment, discomfort, and we are trying to put them in the last eight years
[03:15.690 --> 03:20.490]  in combination to a particular strain or cultivar that's going to be helpful for that particular
[03:20.490 --> 03:21.490]  ailment.
[03:21.490 --> 03:24.810]  And I've been lucky enough to be doing that for the last eight years.
[03:24.810 --> 03:29.490]  The thing that kind of guided me in that direction was because I had my own discomfort within
[03:29.490 --> 03:30.490]  my body.
[03:30.490 --> 03:34.490]  And just to name a few in the last seven years that I've been working with physically, just
[03:34.490 --> 03:43.130]  my own personal stories include PTSD, anxiety, cancer, tumor, endometriosis, reproductive
[03:43.130 --> 03:44.130]  issues.
[03:44.130 --> 03:46.370]  I mean, it's a slew of them.
[03:46.370 --> 03:51.530]  God chose the right person because then I was in Humboldt County running around on farms
[03:51.530 --> 03:59.290]  asking for particular strains or cultivars from friends of mine that I knew grew organic.
[03:59.290 --> 04:03.490]  And I mostly focused on doing non-psychoactive CBD.
[04:03.490 --> 04:08.410]  So that's what kind of got me into what I'm doing now and educating people around the
[04:08.410 --> 04:12.050]  world and working with patients and clients and students around the world.
[04:12.050 --> 04:19.090]  So I'm coming from more of Humboldt County organic farmer boutique strains, growing
[04:19.090 --> 04:23.410]  that industry and cannabis culture in that way.
[04:23.410 --> 04:27.730]  Because most of those people I've been working with for so very long and giving them a platform
[04:27.730 --> 04:33.050]  to speak on their particular expertise that may have gotten lost in the shuffle without
[04:33.050 --> 04:38.690]  some kind of program to really have speakers allowed to talk on their, you know, what they're
[04:38.690 --> 04:39.690]  best at.
[04:39.850 --> 04:41.410]  So anyways, that's what we're going to do.
[04:41.410 --> 04:47.370]  And now we're going to talk about what's in a strain, the cannabis fingerprint.
[04:47.370 --> 04:54.050]  In Humboldt County, and I'm sure many of you have understood that it is about, it's not
[04:54.050 --> 04:59.170]  just particularly about the strain or the cultivar, it's about the whole cannabinoid
[04:59.170 --> 05:04.010]  system and which particular ones do what with what particular body systems.
[05:04.010 --> 05:07.810]  So that's kind of how I started working with different cannabinoids.
[05:07.930 --> 05:12.170]  I was working with CBD, THCA, raw form, plant form, so on and so on.
[05:12.170 --> 05:15.930]  And then it's about connecting those two with your body structures.
[05:15.930 --> 05:20.450]  So today we're going to be talking about the cannabis active ingredients.
[05:20.450 --> 05:21.930]  And do you want to take it for a second?
[05:21.930 --> 05:24.170]  Yeah, I do want to add anything that you want.
[05:24.170 --> 05:27.370]  I want to add a little bit to the idea of strains.
[05:27.370 --> 05:33.130]  So I know that strain names are very near and dear to the breeders out there that have
[05:33.130 --> 05:36.530]  worked to perfect their favorite ones and the ones that are the best sellers.
[05:36.570 --> 05:37.570]  This is going to be fun.
[05:37.570 --> 05:44.370]  But one of the things that we're going to advocate for as part of this industry is that
[05:44.370 --> 05:49.610]  strain names, so there's a reliance on strain names from regulators, from our marketing
[05:49.610 --> 05:55.810]  campaigns that I think does patients a disservice because strain names do not always capture
[05:55.810 --> 05:57.810]  the active ingredients that are in the plant.
[05:57.810 --> 05:59.530]  And ultimately it will be the active ingredients.
[05:59.530 --> 06:01.450]  And I don't mean single active ingredients.
[06:01.450 --> 06:07.170]  I mean the whole collection out of the potential 480 active ingredients in a cannabis strain.
[06:07.170 --> 06:08.170]  It's energy.
[06:08.170 --> 06:09.170]  Yeah.
[06:09.170 --> 06:10.170]  Yeah.
[06:10.170 --> 06:11.170]  So we need to keep track of that.
[06:11.170 --> 06:14.770]  And patients, it's hard because humans want things to be simple, right?
[06:14.770 --> 06:17.010]  It's like part of human nature.
[06:17.010 --> 06:22.090]  But cannabis as a plant, part of its power is it isn't simple.
[06:22.090 --> 06:28.690]  So we've got to find a way to communicate the complexity of active ingredients in plant-based
[06:28.730 --> 06:34.130]  products with our consumers, with patients in a way that they can understand.
[06:34.130 --> 06:35.130]  Okay?
[06:35.130 --> 06:38.930]  So, and that is the big divide we've got to get across because right now what they're
[06:38.930 --> 06:42.890]  relying on when they go into a dispensary is a well-meaning bud tender who's going to
[06:42.890 --> 06:47.090]  tell them about Indicauch and Sativa, right?
[06:47.090 --> 06:51.490]  And some other like lore, right?
[06:51.490 --> 06:54.930]  But one of the things that we try to do is we're data driven.
[06:54.930 --> 06:55.930]  I'm a scientist, right?
[06:55.930 --> 06:58.130]  So we did two studies.
[06:58.130 --> 07:03.730]  One of the studies we did in 2014 in California in conjunction with a third party testing
[07:03.730 --> 07:10.410]  lab and what we were asking the question of, we took over 20,000 strain profiles that,
[07:10.410 --> 07:14.890]  you know, the potency analysis of the cannabinoids and terpenes and we put it through a program
[07:14.890 --> 07:19.650]  where you're looking for clusters that will define something called a chemobar or a chemical
[07:19.650 --> 07:20.650]  variation.
[07:20.650 --> 07:21.650]  Okay?
[07:21.650 --> 07:23.450]  So remember, cannabis isn't one thing.
[07:23.450 --> 07:28.850]  There are certain cannabis strains that fall into these different chemical variations.
[07:28.850 --> 07:33.450]  In 2014 in California when we did it, there were 25 chemobars.
[07:33.450 --> 07:39.970]  We did the same thing in Nevada, which is the state that our primary location is in
[07:39.970 --> 07:44.490]  and we tested, we also partnered with a third party independent testing lab there and there
[07:44.490 --> 07:48.890]  we were looking at, I believe, don't quote me on this, something like 40,000, sorry,
[07:49.490 --> 07:51.690]  something like 4,000 strain records.
[07:51.690 --> 07:55.610]  And we published the second study, the one in Nevada, in the journal called Cannabis
[07:55.610 --> 07:57.650]  and Cannabinoid Research back in May.
[07:57.650 --> 08:04.330]  And what it showed was during the medical only period in Nevada, there were 396 different
[08:04.330 --> 08:09.250]  strain names, but when you did the chemical variation analysis, there were three.
[08:09.250 --> 08:13.770]  And 90% of all the samples tested were in a single chemical variation that was high
[08:13.970 --> 08:20.130]  THC and almost, and very little in the way of minor cannabinoids and terpenes.
[08:20.130 --> 08:21.130]  Okay?
[08:21.130 --> 08:24.810]  We did this, we took the same samples, we sent them off to have genetic analysis done
[08:24.810 --> 08:28.370]  because, you know, it's possible that because in Nevada you have to grow in a greenhouse
[08:28.370 --> 08:30.850]  and there's a lot of convergence in how we grow.
[08:30.850 --> 08:34.050]  We were trying to give people the benefit of the doubt that maybe the chemicals were
[08:34.050 --> 08:36.970]  aligned because we were growing under the same conditions.
[08:37.010 --> 08:45.530]  But on the genetic level, there are 396 strain names correlated with 12 genetic variations.
[08:45.530 --> 08:52.930]  And Blue Dream, which is an incredibly popular strain name, was present in all 12 genetics.
[08:52.930 --> 08:59.210]  So I think that if in a system where we rely on strain names to sell things to patients
[08:59.210 --> 09:04.370]  who are looking for the same results, strain names are doing them a disservice because
[09:04.450 --> 09:08.610]  if you're in Nevada during that medical only period and you picked up Blue Dream off the
[09:08.610 --> 09:12.130]  shelf somewhere, you had a 1 in 12 chance that it was the same thing as you got last
[09:12.130 --> 09:13.130]  time you bought it.
[09:13.130 --> 09:14.130]  So, anyway.
[09:14.130 --> 09:17.130]  You tossed it right over to me.
[09:17.130 --> 09:21.010]  Okay, so this is where I'm going to come from.
[09:21.010 --> 09:26.930]  Because where I'm at in Humboldt County, we are, I mean pridefully so, you ask anyone
[09:26.930 --> 09:32.310]  that's growing pot in Humboldt County, we are organic, we're biodynamic, we're focused,
[09:32.310 --> 09:37.310]  we are proud of our strains, we are proud of our cultivars or variety of cannabis.
[09:37.310 --> 09:40.310]  We know what we're doing or they know what they're doing.
[09:40.310 --> 09:44.190]  I don't grow any longer, but they know what they're doing and they've been doing it for
[09:44.190 --> 09:46.230]  generations and generations.
[09:46.230 --> 09:52.230]  Now as a naturopath, when a client comes to me asking for something, I love the idea of
[09:52.230 --> 09:56.630]  saying, okay, you need this, this, this, this, and this fingerprint, this particular cannabinoid
[09:56.630 --> 09:59.470]  system, like combination.
[09:59.470 --> 10:01.350]  But you give that to the average client.
[10:01.390 --> 10:03.790]  You give that to the average person.
[10:03.790 --> 10:05.790]  They're not going to know what to do with that.
[10:05.790 --> 10:10.990]  So to break it down, I get what you're saying and I get where we're going, but for the average
[10:10.990 --> 10:15.710]  person, not even in this room, they don't know what they're doing and they're going
[10:15.710 --> 10:17.710]  to have to find a direction.
[10:17.710 --> 10:19.790]  Strain name is the best thing we can do right now.
[10:19.790 --> 10:24.550]  Now testing those, making sure that those plants are truly that before the dispensary
[10:24.550 --> 10:27.250]  gets that, that's a whole nother topic, right?
[10:27.250 --> 10:28.990]  And that's what we want to happen.
[10:28.990 --> 10:30.870]  But we have to trust our growers.
[10:30.910 --> 10:34.750]  That's another reason why we go organic and we know our farmers that we're getting our
[10:34.750 --> 10:36.070]  cannabis from.
[10:36.070 --> 10:40.910]  And boutique straining is, for me, being from Humboldt County, that's the way we're pushing
[10:40.910 --> 10:41.910]  it.
[10:41.910 --> 10:44.750]  That's what we're seeing and we're seeing it happen all the time and it's phenomenal.
[10:44.750 --> 10:48.910]  And I think that's what really gives this panel, no, the panel of the two of us, sort
[10:48.910 --> 10:52.990]  of a difference in perspective, because I don't think we disagree.
[10:52.990 --> 10:53.990]  Yeah, I'm coming from Humboldt.
[10:53.990 --> 10:55.030]  You're coming from Nevada.
[10:55.030 --> 10:59.310]  In Nevada, you know, it's a commodity, okay?
[10:59.310 --> 11:05.430]  We're fully into adult use and, you know, I can't swear and we grow ourselves and we're
[11:05.430 --> 11:06.870]  really proud of our Jenny Kush.
[11:06.870 --> 11:07.870]  Thank you very much.
[11:07.870 --> 11:08.870]  There's your strain.
[11:08.870 --> 11:11.870]  You know what that strain's good for too, don't you?
[11:11.870 --> 11:12.870]  There you go.
[11:12.870 --> 11:13.870]  There's a point for it.
[11:13.870 --> 11:15.470]  There's a valid reason for it.
[11:15.470 --> 11:19.630]  But that said, I still can imagine, I can imagine something different than what we have
[11:19.630 --> 11:20.630]  right now.
[11:20.630 --> 11:26.270]  I can imagine a way to break down the complexity of the active ingredients into a way that
[11:26.270 --> 11:29.630]  there's a simple pattern recognition that patients can help.
[11:29.630 --> 11:32.750]  Yeah, I definitely agree with you on that for certain.
[11:32.750 --> 11:38.070]  It's going to take a shift for people to recognize we need to talk about the minor cannabinoids
[11:38.070 --> 11:42.750]  and that's what we're starting to really educate, at least in my field, particular clients who
[11:42.750 --> 11:47.230]  are needing things, say, for their nervous system, which of those particular minor cannabinoids
[11:47.230 --> 11:48.590]  work best from that.
[11:48.590 --> 11:52.750]  And then we can refer them off to strain dosage use, whether they're going to be juicing,
[11:52.750 --> 11:56.830]  whether they're going to non-psychoactive tincture, whether they're going to do a concentrate,
[11:56.830 --> 11:57.830]  then we kind of do that.
[11:57.830 --> 12:02.190]  But right now, it's just like piecing that all together, at least from where I'm standing,
[12:02.190 --> 12:04.430]  because I'm doing it as a private practice.
[12:04.430 --> 12:10.990]  Yeah, so to our first point about the cannabis active ingredients, I think right now, because
[12:10.990 --> 12:16.430]  there's been the most research on THC and CBD, that's where people feel the most comfort
[12:16.430 --> 12:20.230]  and where I think people can understand the significance better.
[12:20.230 --> 12:25.470]  So right now, there is a reliance on information about THC and CBD and I think that's appropriate
[12:25.470 --> 12:30.010]  given where we are in our research, but this is where I see the future and the future will
[12:30.010 --> 12:33.270]  include information about minor cannabinoids and terpenes.
[12:33.270 --> 12:36.310]  And I'm going to give you a little, just a little case study of why that's important.
[12:36.310 --> 12:42.950]  Okay, so a study that I was not involved in, but that I heard at CanMed two years ago,
[12:42.950 --> 12:49.070]  there was a trial happening in Israel where they had patients, they were all children
[12:49.150 --> 12:56.150]  who had epilepsy and they were being given whole plant extract from a cannabis strain
[12:56.150 --> 13:00.890]  that naturally had a 20 to 1 CBD to THC ratio.
[13:00.890 --> 13:04.770]  And because they didn't want to be reliant on a single farmer, they gave two farmers
[13:04.770 --> 13:10.990]  the original strain and they told the farmers, we're going to test this and if the THC to
[13:10.990 --> 13:15.950]  CBD ratios aren't the same when you hand over the products, we won't accept it.
[13:15.950 --> 13:17.670]  That will be our quality control step.
[13:17.670 --> 13:19.390]  So everything was going good.
[13:19.390 --> 13:24.930]  The first part of the trial, the children were having fewer episodes.
[13:24.930 --> 13:29.670]  There was no huge behavioral problems or adverse events, but then something happened midway
[13:29.670 --> 13:35.630]  through and there was suddenly a huge amount, like one part of the patients were suddenly
[13:35.630 --> 13:41.570]  having an increased amount of behavioral events, like just really dramatic, like punching people
[13:41.570 --> 13:47.550]  and just really off the rails to the point where they ended up shutting the trial down.
[13:47.630 --> 13:51.790]  And when they did the backwards analysis, they found that all of the samples that were
[13:51.790 --> 13:56.750]  provided to the children had that right ratio of 20 to 1.
[13:56.750 --> 14:01.430]  But when they did a deeper analysis and they looked at the profiles of ingredients beyond
[14:01.430 --> 14:08.830]  THC and CBD in one farmer's crop, it was equal to what was in the original strain.
[14:08.830 --> 14:13.830]  And one, there was completely different profile of minor cannabinoids and terpenes.
[14:13.830 --> 14:16.270]  And so most people would have said, well, why would that matter?
[14:16.590 --> 14:19.830]  And clearly, I don't think this farmer was trying to hurt children, right?
[14:19.830 --> 14:22.990]  But it's much like if you're babysitting for someone's goldfish and they die, you go to
[14:22.990 --> 14:26.830]  the store and you look for the closest match of goldfish that you can find, unless you're
[14:26.830 --> 14:30.030]  a better human being than me and you have children.
[14:30.030 --> 14:35.190]  And they found something that matched, you know, they couldn't tell from looking at the
[14:35.190 --> 14:38.270]  CBD to THC ratio that it was any different.
[14:38.270 --> 14:42.350]  But you better believe when they did the profiles beyond that, they were incredibly different.
[14:42.350 --> 14:47.830]  So what that shows is that while it's important that we're monitoring the THC and CBD, down
[14:47.830 --> 14:52.830]  the road as our understanding becomes more complete, those other compounds are incredibly
[14:52.830 --> 14:54.750]  important in whole plant extracts.
[14:54.750 --> 15:00.470]  And it is my belief, and I think we share this, that whole plant medicine has potentially
[15:00.470 --> 15:03.510]  greater clinical value than these individualized compounds.
[15:03.510 --> 15:04.510]  But we got to be careful.
[15:04.510 --> 15:06.550]  It's a double-edged sword.
[15:06.550 --> 15:11.430]  More molecules can mean potentially better effects or unexpected effects.
[15:12.150 --> 15:13.830]  I think, thank you for all that.
[15:13.830 --> 15:17.870]  I think that cannabis itself, what we need to remember is that it creates homeostasis
[15:17.870 --> 15:23.350]  in the body, which then allows the body's systems to regulate and heal themselves.
[15:23.350 --> 15:28.310]  So whether you're getting it across the board, I don't think it's going to, I mean, it matters,
[15:28.310 --> 15:30.630]  obviously, and to where you're at.
[15:30.630 --> 15:36.350]  But I think that's the most important part is to focus on cannabis as a whole plant and
[15:36.350 --> 15:37.550]  getting it in that direction.
[15:38.150 --> 15:41.710]  And I can go off on tangents about that, but that's not in our topics today.
[15:41.710 --> 15:42.710]  So let's get back on.
[15:42.710 --> 15:47.710]  We're going to talk about terpene and why terpenes are so important and the terpene
[15:47.710 --> 15:55.510]  canopy, which is so very important for patients and clients and all of us to recognize.
[15:55.510 --> 15:57.430]  It's not just about the cannabinoids.
[15:57.430 --> 16:00.750]  It's also about the terpenes that are in that particular plant.
[16:00.750 --> 16:06.670]  So for example, if you have particular terpenes, a particular cannabinoids, those two together
[16:06.790 --> 16:09.790]  will isolate and be best for a particular body system.
[16:09.790 --> 16:12.350]  That's the direction I'm going specifically.
[16:12.350 --> 16:14.030]  And of course, they're going to be good for everything.
[16:14.030 --> 16:17.950]  But if you're really dialing it in, if you're really needling in a haystack like I've been
[16:17.950 --> 16:21.870]  doing for the last eight years, those are the kind of things that I'm looking for in
[16:21.870 --> 16:25.390]  a cannabis strain or variety or cultivar.
[16:25.390 --> 16:30.990]  And so back to what I was talking about before, where we did the data analysis to try to define
[16:31.150 --> 16:33.070]  the chemical variations.
[16:33.070 --> 16:38.990]  For the study that we did in California, those 25 different chemovars that we identified
[16:38.990 --> 16:42.470]  were all distinguished based on a major and a minor terpene.
[16:42.470 --> 16:46.990]  The CBD and THC levels were actually sort of insignificant to the analysis.
[16:46.990 --> 16:52.550]  And that even holds true in the Nevada analysis we did, that the differences that we're going
[16:52.550 --> 16:56.510]  to see in between the different strains are really in the terpenes.
[16:56.510 --> 17:00.350]  And I believe that's also true from a clinical side.
[17:00.350 --> 17:01.830]  And it also is what naturally...
[17:01.830 --> 17:06.510]  So for people who love whole plant in the raw form, those terpenes are also what adds
[17:06.510 --> 17:07.630]  to your enjoyment, right?
[17:07.630 --> 17:13.590]  So I think terpenes are an undervalued resource that we have in cannabis.
[17:13.590 --> 17:16.310]  And it's something that we are also looking at on the research side.
[17:16.310 --> 17:20.670]  So one of the things that was known for a long time is that cannabinoids have interactions
[17:20.670 --> 17:21.670]  in your body with receptors.
[17:21.670 --> 17:25.310]  Well, in our research, we found that it's the same is true for terpenes.
[17:25.310 --> 17:29.230]  We've identified specific terpenes and the specific receptors in our bodies where they're
[17:29.230 --> 17:30.230]  interacting.
[17:31.110 --> 17:37.270]  So they have just as great a potential for being real effective medicines as the other
[17:37.270 --> 17:41.550]  components in the plant that we've been studying more extensively over time.
[17:41.550 --> 17:42.550]  Yeah.
[17:42.550 --> 17:45.910]  And cannabis farmers in Humboldt County and around the world, I'm sure, but we geek out
[17:45.910 --> 17:47.470]  on that stuff up there.
[17:47.470 --> 17:51.910]  We've been doing it for generations and generations of finding this particular plant that has
[17:51.910 --> 17:56.510]  this particular minor cannabinoid with this particular terpene and this works for this.
[17:56.510 --> 17:58.950]  I mean, they are intense up there.
[17:58.990 --> 18:01.230]  It's really great to be a part of that community.
[18:01.230 --> 18:02.830]  Okay, so let's talk.
[18:02.830 --> 18:08.070]  We had this discussion about sativa and indica and how to, you know, currently this has been
[18:08.070 --> 18:11.430]  like the hot button thing for a while now.
[18:11.430 --> 18:14.310]  Most people think either sativa or indica.
[18:14.310 --> 18:20.310]  Now about five years or more, there was so much hybriding happening that it didn't really
[18:20.310 --> 18:22.150]  make that much sense.
[18:22.150 --> 18:27.110]  And so a big, huge, like a huge group of people are staying away from sativa and indica.
[18:27.150 --> 18:31.070]  But those people who are coming, you know, from the very ground up, the consumers that
[18:31.070 --> 18:34.910]  have never used cannabis or have been afraid to use cannabis, this is the terminology.
[18:34.910 --> 18:36.990]  This is the language that they're using.
[18:36.990 --> 18:40.830]  Even though we're trying to stay away from that and explain to them, it is more about
[18:40.830 --> 18:43.870]  the cannabis fingerprint than anything else.
[18:43.870 --> 18:47.790]  The main consumer, this is what they're looking for.
[18:47.790 --> 18:51.950]  They're going into the dispensary and saying, I want something that's indica dominant.
[18:51.950 --> 18:54.390]  Well, where are we going from that?
[18:54.390 --> 18:56.130]  Now that's an issue.
[18:56.130 --> 18:58.890]  So it's more about really educating people.
[18:58.890 --> 18:59.890]  You're shaking your head.
[18:59.890 --> 19:00.890]  What do you got?
[19:00.890 --> 19:08.330]  So, and so, so, so adding to that, so I've had the opportunity to go to these conferences,
[19:08.330 --> 19:13.410]  including one by the International Cannabinoid Research Society, which is the longest running
[19:13.410 --> 19:17.050]  cannabis research, you know, geek fest that you could think of.
[19:17.050 --> 19:21.890]  And, but the cool thing about going is that these are, these, I got to hear botanists
[19:21.890 --> 19:26.290]  who've been studying cannabis for like 45 years, talk about indica and sativa, and they've
[19:26.290 --> 19:28.490]  done a lot of genetic analysis.
[19:28.490 --> 19:32.850]  And so because they're hearing feedback, like, you know, patients get told indica, indi couch
[19:32.850 --> 19:33.850]  and things like that.
[19:33.850 --> 19:35.290]  They know that that's out there.
[19:35.290 --> 19:38.530]  They decided to go ahead and try to address that using science.
[19:38.530 --> 19:44.490]  So I just saw a talk recently where they, they were looking at samples from the United
[19:44.490 --> 19:46.690]  States, Canada and across the world.
[19:46.690 --> 19:51.610]  And they were trying to say, is indica sativa a real phenotype?
[19:51.610 --> 19:55.170]  Can you actually use that as a way to recommend to patients?
[19:55.170 --> 19:59.330]  And unfortunately what they found that from genetic level, most of the things were specifically
[19:59.330 --> 20:01.930]  in the United States are mostly hybrid.
[20:01.930 --> 20:07.690]  So it's really hard to lean on those, those old paradigms about indica and sativa.
[20:07.690 --> 20:11.770]  But I think that there is something that we can take away from the indica sativa myth,
[20:11.770 --> 20:18.050]  which is, I think that indica and sativa are sort of correlating with profiles of terpenes.
[20:18.050 --> 20:22.290]  So I think that if we can certainly just reimagine that there's still some truth to
[20:22.290 --> 20:23.290]  it.
[20:23.290 --> 20:27.290]  It's just that rather than ascribing it to the word sativa or indica, it's really about
[20:27.290 --> 20:28.290]  the profile of terpenes.
[20:28.290 --> 20:30.810]  Cause I think that there's almost a one-to-one correlation there.
[20:30.810 --> 20:32.810]  Yeah, I definitely agree with you on that.
[20:32.810 --> 20:33.810]  Absolutely.
[20:33.810 --> 20:38.690]  Now it's about educating the student, the client, the community that you're in on looking
[20:38.690 --> 20:42.730]  for a particular terpene that works with your body system, right?
[20:42.730 --> 20:45.730]  Linolol being in lavender, which is calming and relaxing.
[20:45.730 --> 20:50.490]  You're going to look for a fruity, purpley, yummy cannabis that you smell that has that
[20:50.490 --> 20:53.450]  same entire terpene profile.
[20:53.450 --> 20:55.530]  It's going to do the same thing for you.
[20:55.530 --> 21:00.690]  So it's about educating people on a much, much deeper level than just like, Hey, let
[21:00.690 --> 21:06.730]  me grab that one jar that says indica, which from what you're saying might not be.
[21:06.730 --> 21:08.890]  So let's move on.
[21:08.890 --> 21:14.250]  There is something that I want to talk with you about, about hemp and cannabis.
[21:14.250 --> 21:16.810]  This is happening a lot in our communities.
[21:16.810 --> 21:21.690]  It's been happening for a very long time with the explosion of CBD that we started to see
[21:21.690 --> 21:23.290]  a few years ago.
[21:23.290 --> 21:27.410]  It's really interesting whenever I talk to patients and I talk to clients and I talk
[21:27.410 --> 21:32.290]  to students, I talk to people around the world on what they believe that is.
[21:32.290 --> 21:38.330]  Can you, from your perspective of being a grower and focusing in that direction in science,
[21:38.330 --> 21:42.650]  more clinical, I want that described very clearly for our audience.
[21:42.650 --> 21:43.650]  Okay.
[21:44.050 --> 21:46.810]  So I'm sure that for a lot of people, what I'm going to say is not new, but we'll just
[21:46.810 --> 21:47.810]  get it out there.
[21:47.810 --> 21:50.770]  So we have a platform, a common sort of place to start talking from.
[21:50.770 --> 21:55.810]  So hemp and cannabis are the same plant scientifically.
[21:55.810 --> 21:59.090]  It was the government who created two buckets for them, right?
[21:59.090 --> 22:06.210]  And it's based on an artificial designation of the level of THC makes one hemp and one
[22:06.210 --> 22:08.130]  cannabis, but they're the same thing.
[22:08.130 --> 22:12.250]  But that said, that doesn't mean there's not phenotypic differences, much like among dogs
[22:12.290 --> 22:16.890]  and varieties of dogs, you have your large dogs, your small dogs, working dogs and lap
[22:16.890 --> 22:19.890]  dogs and you know, all, everything in between.
[22:19.890 --> 22:20.890]  Cannabis is the same.
[22:20.890 --> 22:26.890]  So breeders of industrial hemp have over time moved the properties of industrial hemp so
[22:26.890 --> 22:30.290]  that they have long fibers and so that they are good at what they're supposed to do, which
[22:30.290 --> 22:31.850]  is be building materials and such.
[22:31.850 --> 22:32.850]  Right.
[22:32.850 --> 22:36.690]  But that's where I'm at because the consumers are looking at CBD based products from that
[22:36.690 --> 22:39.090]  type of hemp, industrial hemp.
[22:39.090 --> 22:40.090]  Exactly.
[22:40.090 --> 22:42.410]  Because that makes me mad.
[22:42.410 --> 22:48.650]  In general, cannabis has been used more medically, we'll say, and as a product for consumption.
[22:48.650 --> 22:52.170]  So therefore the properties that the breeders were looking for were different.
[22:52.170 --> 22:55.290]  They were looking for higher production of oil and things that, you know, higher THC
[22:55.290 --> 22:57.330]  levels, let's just be real.
[22:57.330 --> 23:03.290]  And so there's been a drift between what is classically called industrial hemp and classically
[23:03.290 --> 23:07.130]  called cannabis, but they're still the same plant and they will still breed.
[23:07.130 --> 23:08.130]  Right.
[23:08.170 --> 23:10.650]  So that shows you that they're the same.
[23:10.650 --> 23:15.730]  But that said, what we're finding is that in the world there are pockets of germplasm
[23:15.730 --> 23:22.570]  or people who still have in plant repositories, ancient strains of cannabis and that are sort
[23:22.570 --> 23:24.770]  of not as differentiated.
[23:24.770 --> 23:30.570]  And there are people in the world like the Colorado Hemp Project, that people who are
[23:30.570 --> 23:38.170]  trying to really nurture cannabis strains that have THC below that limit that makes
[23:38.170 --> 23:42.810]  them hemp, but that are still good producers of oil.
[23:42.810 --> 23:45.490]  But these are really isolated people in the world.
[23:45.490 --> 23:49.810]  In general, if you're talking about stuff you order off the internet, it could be industrial
[23:49.810 --> 23:52.090]  hemp from China or it could be, you know.
[23:52.090 --> 23:56.330]  And so what I think most of the people who order these products don't understand is that
[23:57.330 --> 24:02.770]  CBD within the industry is more controlled than out there in the marketplace.
[24:02.770 --> 24:03.770]  Absolutely.
[24:03.770 --> 24:10.490]  And I see people come to me all the time with convenience store CBD and it drives me absolutely
[24:10.490 --> 24:13.010]  nuts as I travel around the country.
[24:13.010 --> 24:15.010]  The thing is they're getting the best they can get.
[24:15.010 --> 24:17.730]  And I kind of say, well, it's like a raw food desert.
[24:17.730 --> 24:22.050]  If you're in the middle of the country and all you can have is a salad from fast food
[24:22.050 --> 24:25.090]  restaurant, at least it's a salad.
[24:25.450 --> 24:26.610]  Let me educate you.
[24:26.610 --> 24:29.930]  Let me sit with you for 20 minutes and tell you why that's not the right thing for your
[24:29.930 --> 24:31.290]  body system.
[24:31.290 --> 24:33.610]  And so that's where I get super passionate.
[24:33.610 --> 24:35.210]  That's why I threw it in there real quick.
[24:35.210 --> 24:36.210]  Yeah.
[24:36.210 --> 24:37.210]  Okay.
[24:37.210 --> 24:38.210]  So let's talk about the entourage effect.
[24:38.210 --> 24:42.730]  We had this discussion the other day and we were on this topic for a very long period
[24:42.730 --> 24:43.730]  of time.
[24:43.730 --> 24:44.730]  This is the hot button word.
[24:44.730 --> 24:49.370]  A lot of people as I'm interviewing them or speaking with them, I also do a podcast and
[24:49.370 --> 24:51.370]  so I interview people.
[24:51.370 --> 24:53.570]  This is the word that they're using.
[24:53.570 --> 24:58.330]  And we had this great conversation about, it's not just about THC.
[24:58.330 --> 25:03.650]  It's like the entourage effect makes you think that there's one shiny star and everything
[25:03.650 --> 25:05.370]  else is just surrounding it.
[25:05.370 --> 25:06.370]  Right?
[25:06.370 --> 25:07.370]  Like the HBO show.
[25:07.370 --> 25:08.370]  Yeah.
[25:08.370 --> 25:09.370]  Yeah.
[25:09.370 --> 25:10.370]  Okay.
[25:10.370 --> 25:12.890]  But you had a great story that I'd love for you to share with me again if you'd like.
[25:12.890 --> 25:13.890]  Sure.
[25:13.890 --> 25:14.890]  Yeah.
[25:14.890 --> 25:18.050]  So one of the things that we've done in our basic research is we've been trying to take
[25:18.050 --> 25:22.530]  the complexity of whole plants and then through the use of things that are more common to
[25:22.530 --> 25:26.130]  the pharmaceutical industry, they're called high throughput screening and medical models
[25:26.130 --> 25:28.050]  and animal testing and such like that.
[25:28.050 --> 25:34.450]  We've been trying to determine what assortment of ingredients from a whole plant extract
[25:34.450 --> 25:38.210]  do you absolutely need to be able to have high clinical value.
[25:38.210 --> 25:42.690]  And what we're finding is that single ingredients barely move the needle when it comes to clinical
[25:42.690 --> 25:43.690]  effectiveness.
[25:43.690 --> 25:48.210]  The power of whole plant medicine comes in the combinations of compounds that are in
[25:48.210 --> 25:50.770]  those plants when we start our analysis.
[25:50.810 --> 25:54.650]  And when we start to look at the readouts of if we measure the ingredients separately,
[25:54.650 --> 25:55.890]  most of them don't have any signal at all.
[25:55.890 --> 26:00.610]  So we realized that if we didn't have access to the whole plants, we never would have found
[26:00.610 --> 26:02.370]  the right mixtures.
[26:02.370 --> 26:07.690]  And so, but what we're finding is in most of the pets, so we've also filed patents on
[26:07.690 --> 26:11.850]  these and that we're doing them for specific conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
[26:11.850 --> 26:15.410]  disease, neuropathic pain, cardiovascular diseases.
[26:15.450 --> 26:22.330]  So one of the common themes in our research seems to be that THC isn't always the star.
[26:22.330 --> 26:26.530]  And in fact, in all of those conditions that I just mentioned, THC isn't a part of the
[26:26.530 --> 26:29.530]  formulation that we ended up with when we did a screen.
[26:29.530 --> 26:33.130]  CBD is important in some, but about 25%.
[26:33.130 --> 26:38.490]  So what we're seeing, and this is really early research, is that the next wave of cannabis
[26:38.490 --> 26:42.290]  medicines is really going to leverage minor cannabinoids and terpenes a whole lot more
[26:42.290 --> 26:44.330]  and specifically in mixtures.
[26:44.330 --> 26:48.010]  And there haven't been any big pharma companies that have stepped up and say, you know what,
[26:48.010 --> 26:52.370]  I'm going to go to the FDA with something that has nine ingredients, but we are.
[26:52.370 --> 26:56.010]  We've got a pharmaceutical composition that we're going to try to take to the FDA next
[26:56.010 --> 26:57.010]  year.
[26:57.010 --> 26:59.050]  It's got nine active ingredients.
[26:59.050 --> 27:04.650]  And so, but what we're trying to show is that the power of this kind of medicine is in the
[27:04.650 --> 27:08.370]  combinations and we've done a lot of like the geeky science stuff to show you need all
[27:08.370 --> 27:09.730]  of those ingredients.
[27:09.730 --> 27:11.810]  And that's what you should take away from whole plant medicine.
[27:11.810 --> 27:15.770]  It's not just that it has THC or CBD, it's that it has the whole assortment and that
[27:15.770 --> 27:16.770]  for...
[27:16.770 --> 27:17.770]  Molecular synergy.
[27:17.770 --> 27:18.770]  Molecular synergy.
[27:18.770 --> 27:19.770]  So we've tried to not call it entourage effect.
[27:19.770 --> 27:22.890]  We try to call it molecular synergy.
[27:22.890 --> 27:25.690]  These molecules work better together than they do apart.
[27:25.690 --> 27:27.210]  And that's the power of whole plant medicine.
[27:27.210 --> 27:29.210]  Yeah, it's fair.
[27:29.210 --> 27:30.210]  Yeah.
[27:30.210 --> 27:31.210]  Okay.
[27:31.210 --> 27:34.130]  I think that we are about wrapped up and you had a couple...
[27:34.130 --> 27:35.890]  Okay, well, we can continue to go.
[27:35.890 --> 27:41.690]  If there's any questions that you may have, we'll take a few.
[27:42.570 --> 27:43.570]  Okay.
[27:43.570 --> 27:44.570]  For Q&A.
[27:44.570 --> 27:45.570]  Can we go right into Q&A?
[27:45.570 --> 27:46.570]  Yeah.
[27:46.570 --> 27:47.570]  Yeah.
[27:47.570 --> 27:48.570]  Let's go into Q&A.
[27:48.570 --> 27:49.570]  I want to say one thing about this.
[27:49.570 --> 27:50.570]  So...
[27:50.570 --> 27:51.570]  Oh, yep.
[27:51.570 --> 27:52.570]  Go ahead.
[27:52.570 --> 27:55.890]  Our summary slide is that if we could encourage people to do one thing, is try to find ways
[27:55.890 --> 27:58.530]  to label beyond CBD and THC.
[27:58.530 --> 28:02.170]  I know it's going to be hard, but in different states I've been talking with people who are
[28:02.170 --> 28:06.410]  either using color coding or there's lots of different tricks that we can use to help
[28:06.410 --> 28:10.970]  break down the complexity so that when patients go to a dispensary, they can get the same
[28:10.970 --> 28:12.330]  thing every time, right?
[28:12.330 --> 28:15.970]  That's super important for maintaining their health.
[28:15.970 --> 28:16.970]  And so...
[28:16.970 --> 28:21.130]  But none of this is going to happen without patient education and money has to come from
[28:21.130 --> 28:22.130]  somewhere.
[28:22.130 --> 28:30.090]  So we need to, as an industry, be rolling back into patient education and basic research.
[28:30.090 --> 28:31.090]  Thank you.
[28:31.090 --> 28:32.090]  You're awesome.
[28:32.090 --> 28:33.090]  Thank you.
[28:33.090 --> 28:34.090]  Yeah.
[28:34.090 --> 28:39.110]  Does it affect...
[28:39.110 --> 28:46.110]  So does the delivery method of a terpene...
[28:46.110 --> 28:47.110]  A hundred percent.
[28:47.110 --> 28:48.110]  Okay.
[28:48.110 --> 28:49.110]  So what would you...
[28:49.110 --> 28:50.110]  Talk to me.
[28:50.110 --> 28:51.110]  Tell me.
[28:51.110 --> 28:52.110]  Go first.
[28:52.110 --> 28:53.110]  Well, that was it.
[28:53.110 --> 28:54.110]  Did the terpene...
[28:54.110 --> 28:55.110]  Is the delivery system of cannabis and the terpenes?
[28:55.110 --> 29:02.110]  Does the delivery system affect the effect on the body of the terpene?
[29:02.110 --> 29:03.110]  Absolutely.
[29:03.110 --> 29:09.470]  So what would be, in your opinion, like three of the best delivery methods for terpenes
[29:09.470 --> 29:10.470]  to get to your body system?
[29:10.470 --> 29:11.470]  It would depend on...
[29:11.470 --> 29:12.470]  And make an effect.
[29:12.470 --> 29:13.470]  Okay.
[29:13.470 --> 29:16.150]  It would depend on the particular body system that you were wanting to work with.
[29:16.150 --> 29:19.510]  So let's narrow that down, saying like the nervous system, for example.
[29:19.510 --> 29:25.470]  If you're doing it for the nervous system, the best delivery method would possibly be,
[29:25.470 --> 29:26.470]  depending on the person, the age.
[29:26.470 --> 29:28.070]  I mean, there's a lot of things that go into that.
[29:28.070 --> 29:29.470]  You have to dial it in.
[29:29.470 --> 29:33.110]  But once you do that, then you look at possible tinctures.
[29:33.110 --> 29:37.190]  Tinctures are going to be the easiest way to get that into the body system.
[29:37.190 --> 29:39.990]  The digestive system works completely different, though.
[29:39.990 --> 29:44.510]  If you're doing an edible and it breaks down in your intestines, that's a completely different
[29:44.510 --> 29:45.510]  thing.
[29:45.510 --> 29:46.510]  We've all had that happen.
[29:46.510 --> 29:52.110]  We've had the brownie and then three hours later and then four hours later.
[29:52.110 --> 29:53.110]  Sublingual's great.
[29:53.110 --> 29:54.110]  Sublingual's great.
[29:54.110 --> 29:57.110]  I work mostly with non-psychoactive cannabis.
[29:57.150 --> 30:01.510]  And so getting those particular, the body system or the way that the dosage method that
[30:01.510 --> 30:06.790]  I suggest for most people are sublingual's, tinctures and topicals.
[30:06.790 --> 30:11.070]  But it depends on what particular body system is needing that medicine.
[30:11.070 --> 30:12.070]  Right?
[30:12.070 --> 30:13.070]  Can I add to that?
[30:13.070 --> 30:14.070]  Of course.
[30:14.070 --> 30:16.270]  So from the producer side, there's some challenges with terpenes.
[30:16.270 --> 30:19.910]  Terpenes as chemicals are lighter.
[30:19.910 --> 30:24.950]  And so when you're trying to prepare cannabis-based products, they just naturally go into the
[30:24.950 --> 30:25.950]  air.
[30:25.950 --> 30:26.950]  Right?
[30:26.950 --> 30:33.590]  So there is a real challenge to, so if you have whole plant, if you're talking about
[30:33.590 --> 30:35.590]  flour, then this is less of a problem.
[30:35.590 --> 30:36.590]  Right?
[30:36.590 --> 30:39.870]  What will matter there is how it was cured because you can use a lot of terpenes depending
[30:39.870 --> 30:44.790]  upon how that raw plant material is cured and processed before it gets into the bag
[30:44.790 --> 30:45.790]  or jar.
[30:45.790 --> 30:46.790]  Right?
[30:46.790 --> 30:51.190]  But for terpenes, when it comes to extraction, different extraction methods, usually the
[30:51.190 --> 30:56.910]  terpenes end up in a different fraction or different part of the equation from the cannabinoids.
[30:57.870 --> 30:58.870]  Yeah.
[30:58.870 --> 31:02.310]  So that's where some people are getting creative with the juicing and stuff.
[31:02.310 --> 31:06.630]  So taking a raw plant and juicing probably is going to give you the most natural blend
[31:06.630 --> 31:08.870]  of the terpenes that were in the original plant.
[31:08.870 --> 31:13.270]  However, if you want a more convenience of some of these other methods, what producers
[31:13.270 --> 31:16.470]  have to do is you have to then add them back, usually.
[31:16.470 --> 31:19.830]  Because in an extraction method, usually, like I said, they end up in different places.
[31:19.830 --> 31:22.190]  So in the final product, you have to add them back.
[31:22.190 --> 31:26.270]  And then with respect to their absorption into the body, that's challenging too.
[31:26.350 --> 31:31.750]  Because like I said, mercine, one of the most common terpenes out there, is the smallest
[31:31.750 --> 31:33.510]  and the most likely to end up in the air.
[31:33.510 --> 31:34.510]  Right?
[31:34.510 --> 31:38.070]  So yeah, in some of the trials that we're doing, we're showing that it has, and other
[31:38.070 --> 31:41.430]  people know this too, is that it has a high potential for pain relief.
[31:41.430 --> 31:44.870]  But how do you actually get it into the product that you're trying to take?
[31:44.870 --> 31:48.430]  And how do you not lose the terpenes?
[31:48.430 --> 31:49.430]  Yeah.
[31:49.430 --> 31:50.430]  Yeah.
[31:50.430 --> 31:53.110]  So one of the things that we're doing, but this is still experimental, is we're doing
[31:53.110 --> 31:55.790]  something called creating nanoparticles.
[31:56.310 --> 31:57.310]  Nanoparticles make them heavier.
[31:57.310 --> 31:58.830]  They can have blood.
[31:58.830 --> 32:00.510]  And they increase the bioavailability.
[32:00.510 --> 32:03.070]  But like I said, these are sort of next gen type stuff.
[32:03.070 --> 32:06.830]  But one of the things to be careful of right now with the stuff you're consuming, if you
[32:06.830 --> 32:10.350]  want to make sure there's terpenes in there, is figure out how they processed it.
[32:10.350 --> 32:14.070]  The thing that's closest to fresh and raw is going to be the closest to the real terpene
[32:14.070 --> 32:15.070]  profile.
[32:15.070 --> 32:16.070]  Yeah.
[32:16.070 --> 32:17.070]  And read labels.
[32:17.070 --> 32:18.070]  Yeah.
[32:18.070 --> 32:23.310]  And I think we touched on it a little bit, but I think that we're really pushing getting
[32:23.350 --> 32:24.670]  everything tested.
[32:24.670 --> 32:27.190]  Know what is in your product.
[32:27.190 --> 32:28.190]  Know what's in your product.
[32:28.190 --> 32:32.070]  Because there's so many times I go and I ask someone to go into the dispensary, or I go
[32:32.070 --> 32:37.470]  in myself, and I look at the label and it just says this percentage TSC, this percentage
[32:37.470 --> 32:38.470]  CBD.
[32:38.470 --> 32:40.570]  And I said, what plant did this come from?
[32:40.570 --> 32:41.990]  What is the terpene profile?
[32:41.990 --> 32:43.310]  What's the cannabis fingerprint?
[32:43.310 --> 32:44.670]  It's not on there.
[32:44.670 --> 32:51.190]  So how can this be good for this particular ailment that I'm trying to get down to the...
[32:51.190 --> 32:52.190]  And one of the things that's true.
[32:52.190 --> 32:53.190]  Makes me crazy.
[32:54.070 --> 32:57.350]  We're advocates as producers in producing single strain whole plant extracts, but those
[32:57.350 --> 32:59.350]  are super rare.
[32:59.350 --> 33:05.910]  And so there's got to be also feedback to the people who are creating the products and
[33:05.910 --> 33:06.910]  to...
[33:06.910 --> 33:09.230]  The whole system has to understand that there is a demand for that.
[33:09.230 --> 33:13.150]  Because right now, the kinds of things that people ask for in dispensaries are usually
[33:13.150 --> 33:15.390]  pretty straightforward.
[33:15.390 --> 33:19.230]  But if we're ever going to get beyond where we are today into the next gen of what cannabis
[33:19.230 --> 33:21.990]  medicine can be, it's not just on our side.
[33:21.990 --> 33:25.390]  We can make these products, but if nobody buys them, and if we haven't educated people
[33:25.390 --> 33:28.750]  to understand why they need to buy them, we'll never get out of this phase.
[33:28.750 --> 33:32.830]  To the next phase where cannabis medicines are considered, of course we're using cannabis
[33:32.830 --> 33:33.830]  for this.
[33:33.830 --> 33:34.830]  That's where we need to be.
[33:34.830 --> 33:35.830]  It's coming.
[33:35.830 --> 33:36.830]  We're just educating.
[33:36.830 --> 33:37.830]  We're just in the education.
[33:37.830 --> 33:45.190]  I have a question of alkaline water and cannabis, a combination of how alkaline water can open
[33:45.190 --> 33:48.070]  up and give more oxygen to the plant to consume.
[33:48.190 --> 33:51.990]  I want to know if you guys have any studies or heard anything about that.
[33:51.990 --> 33:54.910]  I'll let you as the grower.
[33:54.910 --> 34:00.470]  I have been approached by a vendor who provides alkaline water, but I have not seen studies
[34:00.470 --> 34:01.910]  that support claims.
[34:01.910 --> 34:03.350]  I'm not trying to diss it.
[34:03.350 --> 34:06.470]  I'm just saying I don't have any evidence to evaluate, or I would tell you.
[34:06.470 --> 34:10.390]  From a logical perspective, I would imagine it would be really healing because it's very
[34:10.390 --> 34:12.830]  healing to the human body.
[34:12.830 --> 34:15.670]  But there is no studies that I know of.
[34:15.670 --> 34:17.670]  Thank you for that question.
[34:17.670 --> 34:23.940]  I've been hearing about flavonoids.
[34:23.940 --> 34:27.540]  Is that a different term?
[34:27.540 --> 34:28.540]  Is that something else?
[34:28.540 --> 34:31.460]  I just read that it's better than aspirin or something.
[34:31.460 --> 34:32.460]  We read that too.
[34:32.460 --> 34:33.460]  It's very exciting.
[34:33.460 --> 34:34.460]  Yeah.
[34:34.460 --> 34:38.900]  We're being advocates of learning all the compounds of the plant that are potentially
[34:38.900 --> 34:39.900]  active.
[34:39.900 --> 34:44.540]  When I quoted this, there's a study that showed that there's over 480 compounds in the cannabis
[34:44.540 --> 34:49.140]  plant that could be potential drugs because they have bioactivity.
[34:49.140 --> 34:52.660]  There's the cannabinoids, there's the terpenes, but there's also the flavonoids.
[34:52.660 --> 34:56.100]  There's other compounds too that are in that.
[34:56.100 --> 34:57.100]  Here's the thing.
[34:57.100 --> 35:00.060]  The studies are so early yet, but I think that's going to be one of the more active
[35:00.060 --> 35:02.260]  areas of research.
[35:02.260 --> 35:06.540]  To that, GB is actually sponsored a trial where we're doing with the University of Athens
[35:06.540 --> 35:11.300]  in Greece, where we're doing something called metabolomic analysis, where we've defined
[35:11.300 --> 35:14.100]  that these plant strains seem to be good at this.
[35:14.100 --> 35:16.740]  We're looking at not just the cannabinoids and terpenes that are in there, but what are
[35:16.740 --> 35:20.620]  the other compounds that we don't normally measure that could potentially have clinical
[35:20.620 --> 35:21.620]  value.
[35:21.620 --> 35:22.620]  I think you're right.
[35:22.620 --> 35:26.820]  That is going to be some brand new drug categories, which will be pretty awesome.
[35:26.820 --> 35:35.420]  Dr. Smallhauer, did you say that mercine as a terpene is good for pain relief?
[35:35.420 --> 35:40.060]  That is what we've ... Our work is still in preclinical, meaning we've done cell-based
[35:40.380 --> 35:42.380]  and we're doing animal trials right now.
[35:42.380 --> 35:46.620]  The other thing that we've found is that we were able to demonstrate that mercine and
[35:46.620 --> 35:51.540]  a couple of the other terpenes binds directly to receptors in the human body that regulate
[35:51.540 --> 35:52.540]  pain.
[35:52.540 --> 35:56.340]  It's not just we put some stuff in there and it seems to work.
[35:56.340 --> 35:58.700]  We're looking at the molecular mechanism.
[35:58.700 --> 36:03.260]  We've also used nanoparticles to help because mercine was so hard to deal with.
[36:03.260 --> 36:07.940]  We put these compounds into nanoparticles so it's easier to orally dose them without
[36:07.940 --> 36:09.540]  them floating into the air.
[36:09.540 --> 36:12.620]  My question was, I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly because it's on the
[36:12.620 --> 36:13.620]  Prop 65 list.
[36:13.620 --> 36:14.620]  I know that.
[36:14.620 --> 36:15.620]  It is.
[36:15.620 --> 36:20.740]  There are two, marijuana smoke and mercine are the two things in cannabis that that's
[36:20.740 --> 36:23.140]  why we have to put the Prop 65 warnings.
[36:23.140 --> 36:25.060]  I was just wondering if you knew why that was the case.
[36:25.060 --> 36:27.940]  I don't, but that's something I want to look into and write a letter.
[36:27.940 --> 36:28.940]  Okay, let's do it.
[36:28.940 --> 36:32.420]  That's so wild because mercine is the most known in cannabis.
[36:32.420 --> 36:34.060]  It's the most abundant, right?
[36:34.060 --> 36:35.060]  That's interesting.
[36:35.060 --> 36:38.460]  We have time for one more question.
[36:38.460 --> 36:40.460]  Yeah, hold on.
[36:40.460 --> 36:47.000]  Hi, great talk.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.400]  Dr. Nathan Schramm here.
[36:50.400 --> 36:51.800]  I'm in the sunscreen business.
[36:51.800 --> 36:55.160]  It's one of my businesses.
[36:55.160 --> 37:01.800]  We make a sunscreen that's mineral based, but nano is a big no-no in sunscreen.
[37:01.800 --> 37:09.480]  The European Union is regulating it heavily because nano passes through cell membranes.
[37:09.480 --> 37:12.960]  We don't know where it ends up even in the environment.
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.680]  Or in terms of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which are in sunscreens, it can deposit into
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.720]  the coral reefs and be damaging.
[37:20.720 --> 37:27.200]  I'm wondering if any of you have concerns about nano and cannabis and terpenes and stuff
[37:27.200 --> 37:28.200]  like that.
[37:28.200 --> 37:29.200]  Sure, sure.
[37:29.200 --> 37:30.200]  Let me address that.
[37:30.200 --> 37:32.880]  Certainly something we've considered because at the end of the day, we want to be helping
[37:32.880 --> 37:34.120]  people, right?
[37:34.120 --> 37:41.760]  But like many fields, nanotechnology covers a huge variety of technology.
[37:41.760 --> 37:47.200]  There's nano in medicine, there's nano in paint, there's nano in building materials.
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.520]  Nano touches a lot of our lives that we don't even know.
[37:51.520 --> 37:56.280]  There are both responsible molecules that you can use in building nano that have already
[37:56.280 --> 37:58.960]  been tested extensively.
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.080]  And then there's ones where they're showing either bioaccumulation or potential toxicity.
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.280]  We are very cognizant of that and we're trying to steer away from things that don't already
[38:07.280 --> 38:10.760]  have a safety profile that's established.
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.840]  But you're right, because people don't understand the whole breadth of the field, it is a hot
[38:15.840 --> 38:16.840]  button.
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.760]  But on the other hand, the thing that made me a believer in nano is that at the University
[38:22.760 --> 38:28.400]  of Sevilla, they published a study where they had taken a derivative of THC called CB13
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.040]  and put it in a time-released nanoparticle.
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.600]  And they orally dosed, with a single oral dose to a rodent in a neuropathic pain model,
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.000]  one dose gave 11 days worth of relief in that mouse model.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  Whereas the same compound without the nano gave eight hours.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.880]  I'm not saying eight hours is horrible, but what if we could extend the therapeutic window
[38:49.880 --> 38:53.040]  of cannabinoids in a way that was controlled?
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.680]  For me, that was the future.
[38:54.680 --> 39:00.600]  But I see every advance also has potential pitfalls, so it's good that people keep on that.
[39:07.520 --> 39:08.520]  No?
[39:08.520 --> 39:09.520]  Thank you guys so much.
[39:09.520 --> 39:12.520]  Have a wonderful time at your event, a great weekend.
