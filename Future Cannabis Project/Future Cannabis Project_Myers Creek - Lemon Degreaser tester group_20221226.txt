[00:02.810 --> 00:12.970]  Let's see, we are live with the Myers Creek Cannabis Seeds Tester Group.
[00:12.970 --> 00:14.450]  Thanks everybody for joining us.
[00:14.450 --> 00:16.890]  This is going to be a fun effort.
[00:16.890 --> 00:22.250]  Myers Creek is a breeder who we have seen on the Doggett.Garden site.
[00:22.250 --> 00:25.210]  We got another tester joining us here, DP.
[00:25.210 --> 00:27.250]  Welcome in, buddy.
[00:27.250 --> 00:32.610]  I just want to, for this initial episode, want to give the floor to Mr. Myers Creek
[00:32.610 --> 00:37.370]  just to kind of tell us what we're going to be testing and if there's anything in particular
[00:37.370 --> 00:38.610]  he's looking at.
[00:38.610 --> 00:43.570]  And then I'll go ahead and introduce the different testers and we can ask a few questions and
[00:43.570 --> 00:44.690]  get the show rolling.
[00:44.690 --> 00:50.250]  So I guess with that, Mr. Myers Creek, thank you for being here.
[00:50.250 --> 00:53.910]  I know you're sick today, so thanks for struggling through, but do you want to tell us a little
[00:53.910 --> 00:58.630]  bit about yourself, your company, and maybe what we're going to be testing this evening?
[00:58.630 --> 01:00.110]  Yeah.
[01:00.110 --> 01:10.230]  So Myers Creek Seeds, I've been in the cannabis community for the last 30 years, since my
[01:10.230 --> 01:11.710]  early 20s, late teens.
[01:11.710 --> 01:17.190]  I've been doing this for, been working in the recreational, the legal realm for the
[01:17.190 --> 01:18.190]  last five years.
[01:18.190 --> 01:22.430]  I mean, obviously I still do my own things on the side.
[01:22.430 --> 01:26.350]  And what we sent out to everyone in this group was the Lemon Degreaser.
[01:26.350 --> 01:32.670]  One of the first strains that kind of got a little bit of popularity that I put out
[01:32.670 --> 01:34.070]  was Motor Grease.
[01:34.070 --> 01:37.170]  Those sold out really quick.
[01:37.170 --> 01:48.590]  Just a really funky cross of Motor Breath 15 was the female and then 88G13 Hash Plant
[01:48.590 --> 01:55.110]  was the male donor there with the pollen.
[01:55.110 --> 01:56.110]  Just super funky.
[01:56.110 --> 02:02.350]  When I first took off doing seeds four or five years ago, it wasn't for, I'm going to
[02:02.350 --> 02:05.630]  do this for public consumption.
[02:05.630 --> 02:08.270]  It was just for myself.
[02:08.270 --> 02:09.590]  And it still is to this day.
[02:09.590 --> 02:12.110]  Like the crosses that I make, I don't make them for anyone.
[02:12.110 --> 02:17.710]  I'm not trying to fit into a mold, catch a wave, catch a trend.
[02:17.830 --> 02:20.070]  Those purples, they come and they go so quick.
[02:20.070 --> 02:24.950]  By the time you get to them and boom, that trend's gone.
[02:24.950 --> 02:29.170]  So I mean, just, I've been exposed to a lot of different strains.
[02:29.170 --> 02:32.630]  So I kind of know what they're going to do.
[02:32.630 --> 02:38.750]  I have a great resource of friends over the years who have an amazing collection, amazing
[02:38.750 --> 02:41.990]  library of plants that I have access to.
[02:42.990 --> 02:52.870]  So we went through the Motor Grease at one of my employers and we found a nice one there,
[02:52.870 --> 02:53.870]  something that I liked.
[02:53.870 --> 02:57.070]  Again, it wasn't like, ooh, the public's going to like this.
[02:57.070 --> 02:59.390]  To me, it was just like, man, this thing is funky.
[02:59.390 --> 03:00.390]  It is nasty.
[03:00.390 --> 03:03.510]  It is G13 leaning.
[03:03.510 --> 03:10.350]  The high was like what I like to call a high school high, almost to the point of paranoia.
[03:10.350 --> 03:14.470]  So to me, it was one of those strains where like, this is an evening strain.
[03:14.470 --> 03:19.550]  This is not a daytime strain.
[03:19.550 --> 03:25.110]  So yeah, I kind of figured, and then I did the Jimmy's Lemons line and I just, there
[03:25.110 --> 03:26.510]  was this amazing male.
[03:26.510 --> 03:31.870]  I had like 20 males to pick from in this group and number 14 was just this beefcake.
[03:31.870 --> 03:33.790]  I mean, it was just, it was so loud.
[03:33.790 --> 03:36.150]  It was so resonance.
[03:36.150 --> 03:38.910]  People were asking me if it was a reversal.
[03:39.830 --> 03:40.830]  It's not a reversal.
[03:40.830 --> 03:42.710]  This is a true stud.
[03:42.710 --> 03:47.470]  And I kept him around for like two years and I hit him to a bunch of different things that,
[03:47.470 --> 03:51.150]  again, that I liked.
[03:51.150 --> 03:54.990]  Tested out about like the first five or six, really liked what I saw.
[03:54.990 --> 03:58.110]  The Cherry Pie Kush came out super amazing.
[03:58.110 --> 04:01.470]  Shout out to Mount Mars Cultivation for doing that test for me.
[04:01.470 --> 04:04.590]  That was great.
[04:04.590 --> 04:10.750]  Then some other places I did, I tested the Santa Cruz Blue Dream to the Jimmy's Lemons,
[04:10.750 --> 04:15.830]  my Orange Valley Cookies to the Jimmy's Lemons.
[04:15.830 --> 04:19.710]  And I really liked what I saw there.
[04:19.710 --> 04:23.750]  It didn't get overwhelmed with lemon and I didn't want to overwhelm it with lemon because
[04:23.750 --> 04:25.990]  it can be very powerful.
[04:25.990 --> 04:30.990]  So all of my selections always leaned away from the lemon.
[04:31.470 --> 04:37.150]  With my Lemon Drop Mash, that leaned towards the Orange Valley OG.
[04:37.150 --> 04:41.870]  I didn't pick, select lemon tree.
[04:41.870 --> 04:42.870]  I didn't want lemon tree.
[04:42.870 --> 04:45.670]  There's plenty of lemon tree in the world.
[04:45.670 --> 04:47.630]  And that's just gone with anything that I've done.
[04:47.630 --> 04:54.910]  I've always kind of selected away from the overwhelming fruity terpiness of it.
[04:54.910 --> 04:56.030]  I just want it to be mild.
[04:56.030 --> 04:58.790]  I want a nice little hint.
[04:58.790 --> 05:01.470]  Some of it was successful.
[05:01.470 --> 05:04.990]  Some of it I might have missed the mark on it.
[05:04.990 --> 05:12.270]  So yeah, I took the number 14, hit it to a really like what I liked, just a nasty motor
[05:12.270 --> 05:13.350]  grease.
[05:13.350 --> 05:17.110]  And so this was when I sent this cross out, this was like something that I was like, yeah,
[05:17.110 --> 05:18.630]  I don't know how this is going to come out.
[05:18.630 --> 05:20.350]  You know, honestly, I'm doing something here.
[05:20.350 --> 05:23.870]  It's like really nice gassy with a little lemon tip to it.
[05:23.870 --> 05:28.270]  And I'm sending it, you know, I'm putting it to this thing that is just funk.
[05:28.270 --> 05:30.750]  So who knows what the hell is going to come out of this one?
[05:30.750 --> 05:31.750]  Right.
[05:31.750 --> 05:34.870]  I kind of knew like with the cherry pie kush, what I was getting, I kind of knew with, you
[05:34.870 --> 05:40.030]  know, the chem D and a few of the other, I got sour kosher in there.
[05:40.030 --> 05:46.630]  Seven oh seven seed banks, pineapple tie, which was just an amazing plant.
[05:46.630 --> 05:49.910]  Any of the work that Shaw does at seven oh seven seed banks.
[05:49.910 --> 05:50.910]  Amazing.
[05:50.910 --> 05:52.550]  Shout out to him, man.
[05:52.550 --> 05:54.470]  He's got great gear.
[05:54.470 --> 05:57.950]  So the pineapple, the pineapple tie, you know, there weren't really too many.
[05:58.630 --> 06:01.510]  Variations in there that was pineapple, no matter how you looked at it.
[06:01.510 --> 06:06.990]  So taken from that group was really easy because it was like, these are all bad ass, you know,
[06:06.990 --> 06:07.990]  super cool.
[06:07.990 --> 06:11.910]  And so I ended up with like over the last two years, like a dozen different crosses.
[06:11.910 --> 06:13.750]  Like I said, four or five of them got tested.
[06:13.750 --> 06:17.870]  And then this was the one group that when, when, when, when Peter and you guys had asked
[06:17.870 --> 06:21.670]  me about this as a, let's put out this crazy thing and let's see what comes of it, you
[06:21.670 --> 06:23.310]  know?
[06:23.310 --> 06:24.310]  And here we are.
[06:24.310 --> 06:27.630]  Oh, that's pretty freaking awesome.
[06:28.310 --> 06:31.190]  I like the, the, the lineage sounds good.
[06:31.190 --> 06:34.070]  Definitely there hits on some things and I like your style too.
[06:34.070 --> 06:38.670]  You know, it's like, kind of go for things that, you know, I'm enjoying myself.
[06:38.670 --> 06:42.870]  You know, hopefully other people are going to enjoy that.
[06:42.870 --> 06:44.710]  And sometimes you mute it.
[06:44.710 --> 06:47.390]  And since I have them here, it's like, I don't even do cookies, bro.
[06:47.390 --> 06:50.590]  I'm a Fig Newton's guy.
[06:50.590 --> 06:51.750]  I go to that level.
[06:51.750 --> 06:52.750]  I go to that level.
[06:52.750 --> 06:59.310]  It's always nice when someone makes something that they like to, and that's the line they
[06:59.310 --> 07:03.110]  go down just because you can tell if someone's just making something because it's popular
[07:03.110 --> 07:04.110]  because it's bullshit.
[07:04.110 --> 07:05.110]  Yeah.
[07:05.110 --> 07:06.110]  Yeah.
[07:06.110 --> 07:07.110]  Yeah.
[07:07.110 --> 07:08.110]  A hundred percent.
[07:08.110 --> 07:09.110]  A hundred percent.
[07:09.110 --> 07:12.510]  I kind of felt that way where I have, you know, I have a few lines in there where I
[07:12.510 --> 07:17.750]  stuck in that gelato 41 and it's one of those strains where it's like, oh yeah, gelato 41,
[07:17.750 --> 07:20.150]  you know, but to me I liked a lot of 41.
[07:21.150 --> 07:22.150]  Yeah.
[07:22.150 --> 07:24.150]  You know, most people have said that it's real nice.
[07:24.150 --> 07:25.150]  Yeah.
[07:25.150 --> 07:29.550]  You know, just as far as far as a terpene flavor goes, like I'm all about taste.
[07:29.550 --> 07:32.350]  You know, I don't, I don't breed for high THC.
[07:32.350 --> 07:34.350]  Of course I want, you know, frostiness.
[07:34.350 --> 07:35.350]  Everyone wants that.
[07:35.350 --> 07:38.510]  You know, everyone's, you know, the bag appeal when you, you know, you open it up.
[07:38.510 --> 07:41.990]  But I mean, literally I want you to open up the bag, even if it's like, okay, it doesn't
[07:41.990 --> 07:42.990]  look great.
[07:42.990 --> 07:48.550]  Open it up and just get an overwhelming, you know, smell and a taste that matches the smell.
[07:48.550 --> 07:52.070]  And sometimes, you know, the taste doesn't, you know, the smell doesn't match the, I'm
[07:52.070 --> 07:55.470]  sorry, the taste doesn't match the smell, you know?
[07:55.470 --> 07:59.390]  And so kind of one of my goals is always like, you know, try to do that.
[07:59.390 --> 08:02.390]  And then some of them, like again, some of them hit, some of them don't.
[08:02.390 --> 08:03.390]  Yep.
[08:03.390 --> 08:07.790]  Well, and you're, you're, you're familiar with your strains and so you're able to work
[08:07.790 --> 08:14.950]  with them and over time, the more that you do it over time, the closer you can get to
[08:14.950 --> 08:15.950]  the mark.
[08:15.950 --> 08:16.950]  Let's see here.
[08:16.950 --> 08:20.430]  I see John trying to join here.
[08:20.430 --> 08:24.150]  You know, and again, I have, you know, just, you know, 30 years of this and just, you know,
[08:24.150 --> 08:29.110]  I keep my, you know, I have a good word, you know, basically.
[08:29.110 --> 08:34.990]  And so I have a great network of friends, you know, who are absolutely, you know, open
[08:34.990 --> 08:36.790]  their libraries up to me.
[08:36.790 --> 08:40.870]  You know, I think if I put it all together, I've probably have access to, you know, 250
[08:40.870 --> 08:42.950]  different strains, you know?
[08:42.950 --> 08:47.830]  I mean, all the old ones, of course, you know, original OG Kush, you know, original, you
[08:47.830 --> 08:52.350]  know, Triangle, SFVOG.
[08:52.350 --> 08:57.190]  And so I'm lucky in that sense that I don't have to keep this big massive library of stuff.
[08:57.190 --> 08:58.190]  Yeah.
[08:58.190 --> 09:02.030]  And then I think that kind of comes with, you know, time too.
[09:02.030 --> 09:05.350]  You've been doing this for 30 years, so you're going to make some good connections.
[09:05.350 --> 09:08.630]  But more importantly, like you said, you know, it's kind of the integrity and the long-term.
[09:08.630 --> 09:11.950]  There's people who have been around for 30 years that couldn't get a cut to save their
[09:11.950 --> 09:12.950]  lives.
[09:12.950 --> 09:15.390]  But, you know, yeah, exactly.
[09:15.390 --> 09:19.790]  You know, and I just every time someone goes, wow, I've never been able and I'm just like,
[09:19.790 --> 09:25.790]  wow, I'm really fortunate, you know, really, really lucky to like know the people I know
[09:25.790 --> 09:28.790]  and have the access to the to the stuff that I have.
[09:28.790 --> 09:32.790]  Because, you know, some of you guys on the East Coast, like you.
[09:32.790 --> 09:35.910]  I mean, you're starting to get them now because a lot of people are in California sending
[09:35.910 --> 09:37.230]  them out to you guys, you know.
[09:37.230 --> 09:38.230]  I'm a long time.
[09:38.230 --> 09:39.230]  I'm up in Canada, bro.
[09:39.230 --> 09:40.230]  I recently just got my secret handshake.
[09:40.230 --> 09:53.230]  You know what we go through, because, you know, I got a pretty awesome group of friends
[09:53.230 --> 09:59.070]  too and everybody here are freaking awesome growers in their own right.
[09:59.070 --> 10:00.910]  And I want to go through and introduce everybody.
[10:00.910 --> 10:06.710]  And I'll start with Mr. Magpie, just because he has shown the most restraint I have ever
[10:06.710 --> 10:08.270]  seen him exhibit in his life.
[10:08.270 --> 10:13.750]  This guy does not believe in keeping seeds dry for more than like two days.
[10:13.750 --> 10:15.510]  He's got a popping problem.
[10:15.510 --> 10:18.510]  And his garden is a little stale.
[10:18.510 --> 10:19.510]  Technically I'm a collector.
[10:19.510 --> 10:22.510]  I collect them, but I collect them to pop.
[10:22.510 --> 10:24.910]  I don't collect them to collect them.
[10:24.910 --> 10:25.910]  Yeah.
[10:25.910 --> 10:26.910]  Yeah.
[10:26.910 --> 10:30.550]  So I don't know, you know, you know, Mr. Magpie, we've been we've talked for a long
[10:30.550 --> 10:31.550]  time.
[10:31.550 --> 10:32.550]  I followed you.
[10:32.550 --> 10:33.550]  I've done your grow.
[10:33.550 --> 10:38.590]  So can you kind of give a little rundown about what you're doing in the garden for Myers
[10:38.590 --> 10:43.990]  Creek, just to kind of explain your style or you in buckets or what you do in there?
[10:43.990 --> 10:49.390]  Basically for like right now, like I'm in the middle of almost a three year hunt, just
[10:49.390 --> 10:52.030]  going through stuff like I got through FCP.
[10:52.030 --> 10:57.270]  I met a few people like Chad, Tony Boneyard and people like that.
[10:57.270 --> 11:02.230]  So I've been able to get access to, you know, tons of seeds to run and just all kinds of
[11:02.230 --> 11:03.550]  cool shit to look at.
[11:03.550 --> 11:08.510]  So then at the same time, I switched from bottles to organic.
[11:08.510 --> 11:12.070]  So like I call it living soil, but I'm not like full living soil yet.
[11:12.070 --> 11:15.030]  Like there's no worms in my pots or anything like that.
[11:15.030 --> 11:16.030]  Got you.
[11:16.030 --> 11:17.030]  What?
[11:17.030 --> 11:23.150]  So like right now I flower in 10 to 15 gallons, depending on like I started in bigger pots,
[11:23.150 --> 11:27.590]  but I found as I got the hang of it more like I could I can smash a pretty big plant in
[11:28.590 --> 11:32.910]  And just lets me look through more, right?
[11:32.910 --> 11:37.310]  Then for just for amendments and stuff, I'm just using like, you know, traditional organic
[11:37.310 --> 11:38.310]  stuff.
[11:38.310 --> 11:48.190]  So, you know, neem cake, karachi cake, barley, alfalfa, kale, soy, just like all the normal
[11:48.190 --> 11:50.470]  stuff you'd need for basically dry amendments.
[11:50.470 --> 11:53.430]  And then I mess with the M1.
[11:53.430 --> 11:56.230]  I'm a foliar spray fanatic.
[11:56.230 --> 11:58.230]  I'm like, well, too crazy.
[11:58.230 --> 12:02.470]  I mean, getting the rooms clean after something, it's worth it.
[12:02.470 --> 12:06.790]  Because like some of the foliar spray is like, I've only been doing it for about a year now.
[12:06.790 --> 12:10.230]  But once you really get to timing right and whatnot, like you spray them and you come
[12:10.230 --> 12:12.790]  back in two hours later, there's a difference.
[12:12.790 --> 12:13.790]  Oh, shit.
[12:13.790 --> 12:14.790]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[12:14.790 --> 12:15.790]  Yeah.
[12:15.790 --> 12:20.350]  So I'm basically still just getting into it myself, but just trying to learn and make
[12:20.350 --> 12:21.350]  them own things.
[12:21.350 --> 12:27.190]  And like I just the last few rounds started doing my own activate my own M1, which is
[12:27.190 --> 12:28.190]  a simple thing.
[12:28.190 --> 12:31.270]  But at first it was it wasn't simple when you think about it.
[12:31.270 --> 12:33.990]  Like, well, what if I fuck this whole thing up?
[12:33.990 --> 12:35.750]  But you know, just one step at a time.
[12:35.750 --> 12:37.750]  So they get in the hang of it.
[12:37.750 --> 12:38.750]  Yeah.
[12:38.750 --> 12:39.750]  Nice.
[12:39.750 --> 12:40.750]  Yeah.
[12:40.750 --> 12:43.750]  And one thing I know that he's going to, you know, lend to the experiment to the testing
[12:43.750 --> 12:46.510]  is, you know, tightness space.
[12:46.510 --> 12:50.910]  How well does it perform when it's, you know, mashed up with some other ones?
[12:50.910 --> 12:55.310]  Because commercially, that's something that, you know, people obviously have my bedroom.
[12:55.310 --> 12:58.310]  Like if you go on my IG, my bedroom gets really ridiculous.
[12:58.310 --> 13:02.310]  I went from being allowed to grow four plants to being allowed to grow like 400.
[13:02.310 --> 13:03.310]  Literally.
[13:03.310 --> 13:06.310]  So literally, make way while the sun is shining.
[13:06.310 --> 13:10.510]  Because the government could say tomorrow, no, we changed our mind.
[13:10.510 --> 13:13.310]  So go, go, go, go, go.
[13:13.310 --> 13:14.310]  Yeah.
[13:15.110 --> 13:17.110]  They open that gate, run through it.
[13:17.110 --> 13:18.110]  That's what I'm saying.
[13:18.110 --> 13:19.110]  Exactly.
[13:19.110 --> 13:20.110]  Run through it.
[13:20.110 --> 13:21.110]  Stop me if you can.
[13:21.110 --> 13:22.110]  And that's what I like.
[13:22.110 --> 13:28.230]  Like, I found ones that I really love and I've kept some cuts over the last few years.
[13:28.230 --> 13:29.230]  Mostly Boneyard work.
[13:29.230 --> 13:35.110]  Like I've run other people's, but just I've ran 80% of that just because when I met him,
[13:35.110 --> 13:39.110]  like, I, you know, I'm getting from this person, I was getting from Dutch Sea Banks and like
[13:39.110 --> 13:41.950]  I had bought a pack or two from him and he's like, bro, here.
[13:41.950 --> 13:44.750]  He sent me a package and he must have sent me like a thousand seats.
[13:44.750 --> 13:48.870]  So like I just started going through them like crazy.
[13:48.870 --> 13:51.790]  So that's how I kind of started meeting everybody just through Chad.
[13:51.790 --> 13:53.070]  I reached out to him at first.
[13:53.070 --> 13:57.270]  Like the first couple of months I met Chad, he would message me back like I was a stranger,
[13:57.270 --> 13:59.670]  but I would message him like four or five fucking times a day.
[13:59.670 --> 14:01.670]  I'm like, hey, this is what I did in the garden today.
[14:01.670 --> 14:02.670]  Hey, check this out.
[14:02.670 --> 14:04.670]  And just, I just go for it, go for it.
[14:04.670 --> 14:07.670]  You're like, you're going to like me whether you like it or not.
[14:07.670 --> 14:08.670]  Yeah.
[14:08.670 --> 14:10.670]  It was like, who's everyone to talk about it with, right?
[14:11.390 --> 14:13.390]  Like the people around me that grow, they don't really give a shit.
[14:13.390 --> 14:17.390]  Like they get clones from me now and they're hype about that because their beats better.
[14:17.390 --> 14:18.390]  But they don't care.
[14:18.390 --> 14:20.390]  They're not going to do their own research.
[14:20.390 --> 14:21.390]  Right?
[14:21.390 --> 14:22.390]  Yeah.
[14:22.390 --> 14:25.390]  So he would, Chad was the first person I met online that I could like talk to shit about.
[14:25.390 --> 14:29.390]  So I, I do, I'd send him like mile long messages.
[14:29.390 --> 14:30.390]  I fucking love that dude.
[14:30.390 --> 14:33.390]  Every time he'd be like, oh, sorry it took me so long to get back to you.
[14:33.390 --> 14:34.390]  I'd be like, dude, I don't even care.
[14:34.390 --> 14:35.390]  I just keep sending.
[14:35.390 --> 14:38.390]  I'm like, I just, you're my sounding board right now.
[14:38.390 --> 14:39.390]  I don't even care, bro.
[14:40.110 --> 14:41.110]  I don't even care if you read them.
[14:41.110 --> 14:44.110]  I'm just, you're my fucking diary.
[14:44.110 --> 14:45.110]  Someone's got to hear this.
[14:46.110 --> 14:48.110]  And that's the same, same way I met Toad.
[14:48.110 --> 14:51.110]  Like I started, me and Toad are close homies now and that's how we met.
[14:51.110 --> 14:56.110]  Like I just started messaging him and then like I started testing his gear and the first,
[14:56.110 --> 14:58.110]  the first test I ever did for anybody was him.
[14:58.110 --> 15:03.110]  And I got, you remember this Chad, and I was mixing indoor and outdoor and I wasn't, you
[15:03.110 --> 15:04.110]  know what I mean?
[15:04.110 --> 15:05.110]  I slacked and I got PM.
[15:05.110 --> 15:06.110]  Learning.
[15:06.110 --> 15:07.110]  Learning.
[15:07.110 --> 15:08.110]  I got PM all over my flower.
[15:08.110 --> 15:09.110]  I'm like, God.
[15:09.830 --> 15:10.830]  So I got really angry.
[15:10.830 --> 15:11.830]  I just cut the whole thing down.
[15:11.830 --> 15:12.830]  And I felt so bad.
[15:12.830 --> 15:15.830]  Like when I messaged him, I'm like, they're fucked up.
[15:15.830 --> 15:16.830]  And he was so cool about it.
[15:16.830 --> 15:17.830]  And he sent me more.
[15:17.830 --> 15:21.830]  So then the first few tests I did for him, bro, I was so nervous about it that I wanted
[15:21.830 --> 15:22.830]  to do a good job.
[15:22.830 --> 15:24.830]  So like I go to send them pictures.
[15:24.830 --> 15:26.830]  It'd be like 200 pictures.
[15:26.830 --> 15:30.830]  He'd be on a live and you'd hear his phone just ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
[15:30.830 --> 15:31.830]  ding.
[15:31.830 --> 15:32.830]  DPs heard it.
[15:32.830 --> 15:40.310]  I just love run through seeds, man.
[15:40.310 --> 15:42.030]  Different jars, different flavors.
[15:42.030 --> 15:48.590]  I found plants that I would keep under my bed and stash forever, but they weren't bad.
[15:48.590 --> 15:52.510]  If you're running something from someone that gives a fuck, there aren't really bad plants.
[15:52.510 --> 15:53.510]  I've seen them.
[15:53.510 --> 15:54.510]  They're just different.
[15:54.510 --> 15:55.510]  Yeah.
[15:55.510 --> 15:56.510]  Yeah.
[15:56.510 --> 15:57.510]  Yeah.
[15:57.510 --> 15:58.910]  And you know, like Myers Creek was hinting at too.
[15:58.910 --> 16:03.710]  It's like pretty much any of the seeds that you get today or any of the cannabis that
[16:03.710 --> 16:06.990]  you pick up, it's going to get you stoned.
[16:06.990 --> 16:07.990]  Like it really should.
[16:07.990 --> 16:08.990]  I haven't come across weed that doesn't get you stoned.
[16:08.990 --> 16:13.990]  Yeah, if you grow it half decent, like most stuff, it's going to do something.
[16:13.990 --> 16:16.430]  Like it's better than nothing.
[16:16.430 --> 16:17.430]  Yeah.
[16:17.430 --> 16:19.630]  So it's all about those like secondary characteristics.
[16:19.630 --> 16:24.350]  You know, the taste, the smell, does it burn good?
[16:24.350 --> 16:26.510]  So those are the, you know, those are the things we're looking for.
[16:26.510 --> 16:29.110]  That's what I was going to ask you too, Jimmy.
[16:29.110 --> 16:31.750]  Do you mess with hash at all?
[16:31.750 --> 16:32.750]  I don't.
[16:32.750 --> 16:33.750]  I don't make hash.
[16:33.750 --> 16:35.630]  No, I have a lot of friends who are hash makers.
[16:35.630 --> 16:36.630]  Yeah.
[16:36.630 --> 16:43.550]  But yeah, no, I don't have the bandwidth to be, you know, to do all that stuff.
[16:43.550 --> 16:47.230]  I mean, when I was younger, I was like.
[16:47.230 --> 16:50.790]  My other deep obsession now is bubble hash ever since I started doing it.
[16:50.790 --> 16:52.030]  Like it's just one of those things.
[16:52.030 --> 16:54.910]  It's like, it's simple, like growing, but you'll never master it.
[16:54.910 --> 16:55.910]  It's just beautiful.
[16:56.310 --> 16:57.310]  Yeah.
[16:57.310 --> 16:58.310]  I've always been a flower guy.
[16:58.310 --> 17:01.390]  You know, I did like a year of dabs.
[17:01.390 --> 17:04.070]  Like it really, it really like ruined flower for me, to be honest.
[17:04.070 --> 17:05.070]  Yeah.
[17:05.070 --> 17:06.070]  That's what I found from dabs too.
[17:06.070 --> 17:09.070]  And then I started doing the bubble hash and like, I just, cause I ended up having so much
[17:09.070 --> 17:12.510]  extra flour from having such a big plant count.
[17:12.510 --> 17:16.830]  So I started washing it all and just putting these huge chunks away and like leave one
[17:16.830 --> 17:18.070]  for like two or three years, bro.
[17:18.070 --> 17:19.070]  And you crack back into it.
[17:19.070 --> 17:20.070]  It's like, holy.
[17:20.070 --> 17:24.750]  I remember the first guy who showed me bubble hash 20 years ago.
[17:24.750 --> 17:25.750]  I thought he was insane.
[17:26.590 --> 17:28.870]  I was like, you're not getting me to soak my weed in water, bro.
[17:28.870 --> 17:29.870]  I'm sorry.
[17:29.870 --> 17:30.870]  You know?
[17:30.870 --> 17:31.870]  Yes.
[17:31.870 --> 17:34.070]  No, we've been so foreign the first time.
[17:34.070 --> 17:35.830]  You know, and then you're moving forward.
[17:35.830 --> 17:38.830]  Here it is, you know, 25 years later.
[17:38.830 --> 17:42.310]  And I got, you know, friends talking about like, oh no, that strain was a ghost wash.
[17:42.310 --> 17:43.430]  That's not even a hash plant.
[17:43.430 --> 17:44.430]  You know, like, see exactly.
[17:44.430 --> 17:48.870]  You put in all this work, you wash it, you just destroyed all that weed and it wasn't
[17:48.870 --> 17:51.030]  even a washer, you know?
[17:51.030 --> 17:52.030]  Yeah.
[17:52.030 --> 17:55.670]  I've been told by somebody half my age that they don't smoke pre-run.
[17:55.670 --> 17:56.670]  I was like, what?
[17:56.670 --> 17:57.670]  Oh, I've never heard that before.
[17:57.670 --> 18:00.150]  I was like, wait a minute.
[18:00.150 --> 18:03.790]  Like I love hash, but like ours is just tremendous.
[18:03.790 --> 18:05.710]  Like you can't get rid of that.
[18:05.710 --> 18:06.910]  No, no.
[18:06.910 --> 18:09.590]  And that's, you know, that is kind of a good little bonus too.
[18:09.590 --> 18:12.150]  Cause I know you'll probably wind up doing some of that at the end.
[18:12.150 --> 18:13.470]  No, I will for sure.
[18:13.470 --> 18:16.630]  I wash like every plant I run, I wash just in case.
[18:16.630 --> 18:18.030]  Cause like it's all just to hunt.
[18:18.030 --> 18:20.030]  I'm just curious, right?
[18:20.030 --> 18:21.030]  Nice.
[18:21.030 --> 18:26.750]  And then kind of, kind of too, you know, on, on a similar tip, you know, Magpie, you mentioned
[18:26.750 --> 18:28.950]  you haven't gone full worms yet.
[18:28.950 --> 18:31.590]  DP, I'm going to put you on blast.
[18:31.590 --> 18:33.990]  You have gone full hippie.
[18:33.990 --> 18:39.630]  Do you maybe want to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about how you're going to
[18:39.630 --> 18:40.630]  be growing these?
[18:40.630 --> 18:41.630]  Yeah.
[18:41.630 --> 18:42.630]  Cheers.
[18:42.630 --> 18:43.630]  DP.
[18:43.630 --> 18:44.630]  So I'm going DP zero.
[18:44.630 --> 18:50.110]  Yeah, I guess since Chad said I went full hippie.
[18:50.190 --> 18:51.830]  I'm going full hippie, I guess.
[18:51.830 --> 18:52.830]  Right.
[18:52.830 --> 18:55.430]  I went full hippie for a while too.
[18:55.430 --> 18:57.430]  Full hippie.
[18:57.430 --> 19:00.510]  I'm enjoying learning how to make my own inputs and stuff like that.
[19:00.510 --> 19:01.510]  Yeah.
[19:01.510 --> 19:02.510]  It's just nice.
[19:02.510 --> 19:03.510]  So yeah, really enjoying that.
[19:03.510 --> 19:04.510]  So I got the worms.
[19:04.510 --> 19:05.510]  I'm going to do a couple of different ones.
[19:05.510 --> 19:10.350]  I'll do a 20 gallon pot and then I want to do a sip pot as well.
[19:10.350 --> 19:11.350]  Next to it.
[19:11.350 --> 19:13.350]  I'll do like a five gallon hippie.
[19:13.350 --> 19:22.830]  And then I'm deciding to do another 20 gallon pot and run those in there.
[19:22.830 --> 19:25.270]  I'll start it off with, I'll just build a soil 3.0.
[19:25.270 --> 19:30.910]  I mix that in with some of the Costa Viana lobster and crab compost.
[19:30.910 --> 19:31.910]  I love that stuff.
[19:31.910 --> 19:32.910]  Yeah, that'll be fire.
[19:32.910 --> 19:33.910]  Yeah, that's good stuff, man.
[19:33.910 --> 19:34.910]  I got my own worm bin.
[19:34.910 --> 19:35.910]  I got my own compost and such.
[19:35.910 --> 19:36.910]  Nice, same here.
[19:36.910 --> 19:43.030]  I kind of cross gear bin towards whatever I'm gearing it towards right now.
[19:43.710 --> 19:46.710]  Yeah, I'm building my first worm bin now.
[19:46.710 --> 19:48.710]  Yeah, man, those things are awesome.
[19:48.710 --> 19:49.710]  I cook too.
[19:49.710 --> 19:50.710]  I cook too.
[19:50.710 --> 19:51.710]  I've been learning.
[19:51.710 --> 19:52.710]  Yeah, it happens.
[19:52.710 --> 19:53.710]  It happens.
[19:53.710 --> 20:01.630]  When I was doing living soil raised beds, I live in the Santa Cruz mountains, so I would
[20:01.630 --> 20:03.990]  actually go out and forage for stuff.
[20:03.990 --> 20:05.150]  I'd pick mushrooms.
[20:05.150 --> 20:06.590]  I'd find Oak leaf mold.
[20:06.590 --> 20:09.910]  I'd find just all the kinds of craziest shit and I would just take it into my room and
[20:09.910 --> 20:12.910]  just throw it everywhere.
[20:13.790 --> 20:14.790]  The craziest shit.
[20:14.790 --> 20:18.990]  It was just so fun because it was so simple and it was just so organic.
[20:18.990 --> 20:21.990]  It was just like a terpene profile that you got out of a mussel.
[20:21.990 --> 20:24.990]  It's almost like the more creative you get with it, the better it gets.
[20:24.990 --> 20:25.990]  Exactly.
[20:25.990 --> 20:27.990]  It's just like, I'm going to do this even weirder fucking thing.
[20:27.990 --> 20:28.990]  Exactly.
[20:28.990 --> 20:29.990]  That's Mr. Magpie right there.
[20:29.990 --> 20:30.990]  Yeah, dude.
[20:30.990 --> 20:31.990]  It's lined up by a holly dog.
[20:31.990 --> 20:32.990]  Yeah, I was doing the same shit, man.
[20:32.990 --> 20:33.990]  It was great.
[20:33.990 --> 20:34.990]  It was a fun time.
[20:34.990 --> 20:35.990]  It's not weird at all.
[20:35.990 --> 20:44.110]  I just want to build that, get that good strong inoculation in there off the back.
[20:44.110 --> 20:47.590]  Get some good beneficial, get some good bumps up in there.
[20:47.590 --> 20:48.590]  Get everything primed and ready.
[20:48.590 --> 20:49.590]  Ready to rock and roll.
[20:49.590 --> 20:53.150]  I want to throw whatever at it that it's going to want.
[20:53.150 --> 20:55.150]  Be able to show me what it can do.
[20:55.150 --> 20:59.910]  I give them kind of some cold temps and a little bit rougher conditions just because
[20:59.910 --> 21:03.350]  I feel like it'll express a little bit better.
[21:03.350 --> 21:04.350]  So yeah, I'm stoked.
[21:04.350 --> 21:05.350]  I'm excited.
[21:05.710 --> 21:06.710]  I'm hearing you describe it.
[21:06.710 --> 21:07.710]  I'm super stoked.
[21:07.710 --> 21:08.710]  So, hell yeah.
[21:08.710 --> 21:09.710]  Nice.
[21:09.710 --> 21:10.710]  Right on.
[21:10.710 --> 21:14.470]  Yeah, I'm really curious to see what type of varieties come out of this group here.
[21:14.470 --> 21:20.310]  I mean, I know there's going to be some that lean one way and some that lean the other.
[21:20.310 --> 21:31.430]  I'm really thinking though that the motor breath side of it, the motor grease side is
[21:31.430 --> 21:34.230]  still going to be a little more dominant than the lemon side.
[21:34.310 --> 21:36.190]  At least that's my prediction.
[21:36.190 --> 21:37.190]  We'll see what happens here.
[21:37.190 --> 21:42.270]  I mean, obviously a bigger field that you go through, you're going to find those one
[21:42.270 --> 21:43.270]  offs.
[21:43.270 --> 21:48.270]  But if you're just doing a pack or two, really, I'm not sure what's going to come out of this
[21:48.270 --> 21:49.270]  group.
[21:49.270 --> 21:52.230]  That's why I was really interested in getting this group out there.
[21:52.230 --> 21:59.230]  Yeah, it won't be till after all this is done, but I'm going to throw the ones I run outside
[21:59.230 --> 22:02.590]  here too for this season because I'm putting a ton of stuff outside.
[22:02.590 --> 22:09.590]  I'm in Southern Ontario, so it takes quite a plant to finish it all the way.
[22:09.590 --> 22:10.590]  I bet.
[22:10.590 --> 22:13.590]  Great growing season, not always the best.
[22:13.590 --> 22:14.590]  Got you.
[22:14.590 --> 22:15.590]  That's good.
[22:15.590 --> 22:18.910]  I mean, that's something that I'm not able to do, was grow outside.
[22:18.910 --> 22:22.390]  So to have people test outside for me this summer, I was like, right, you know, right
[22:22.390 --> 22:23.390]  the F on.
[22:23.390 --> 22:24.390]  Yeah.
[22:24.390 --> 22:25.390]  Nice.
[22:25.390 --> 22:26.390]  Yeah.
[22:26.390 --> 22:31.470]  And so we've got New York John, who hasn't made it in yet.
[22:31.470 --> 22:33.430]  Hopefully he's seen the message.
[22:33.430 --> 22:36.630]  You know, sometimes life happens, but he grows in DWC.
[22:36.630 --> 22:37.630]  Okay.
[22:37.630 --> 22:42.750]  Dude gets explosive growth out of them, out of his plants, does a great job, you know,
[22:42.750 --> 22:45.190]  kind of keeping things topped and looking good in the garden.
[22:45.190 --> 22:48.570]  So hopefully he'll pop in here later.
[22:48.570 --> 22:54.190]  But we do have two other pretty freaking awesome growers with us.
[22:54.190 --> 22:56.550]  I'll get the chef first because he popped in here.
[22:56.630 --> 23:03.470]  So Chef Alex is a grower out on the East Coast and he is kind of as the name applies.
[23:03.470 --> 23:11.230]  He is a fairly good chef and he makes cannabis treats and he's recently taken home, actually
[23:11.230 --> 23:16.150]  not recently, consistently has been taking home awards for his edibles.
[23:16.150 --> 23:20.670]  Back to back to back to back.
[23:20.670 --> 23:21.670]  Yeah.
[23:21.670 --> 23:22.670]  Nice.
[23:22.670 --> 23:23.670]  Congratulations, sir.
[23:23.790 --> 23:29.750]  And do you want to maybe introduce yourself to us, Chef Alex, and kind of let Jimmy know
[23:29.750 --> 23:33.510]  how we're going to be growing the lemon degreaser this round?
[23:33.510 --> 23:35.870]  Yeah, for sure.
[23:35.870 --> 23:43.070]  So I've been growing for about eight years now, half and half, more so organically the
[23:43.070 --> 23:46.310]  last five years.
[23:46.310 --> 23:48.430]  And I'll be growing it on soil.
[23:48.430 --> 23:54.310]  I really liked the intent that you put into your selections as opposed to just slapping
[23:54.310 --> 23:55.310]  it together.
[23:55.310 --> 24:00.110]  And it kind of lines up with what a few of us have been kind of searching through for
[24:00.110 --> 24:01.110]  some seeds.
[24:01.110 --> 24:04.950]  I have some more stuff in my tent going like that right now.
[24:04.950 --> 24:11.150]  So when you started talking about the motor breath with the gas and the lemon and that
[24:11.150 --> 24:15.830]  like funk from the chemgear in there, it's right up my alley.
[24:15.830 --> 24:18.230]  So I'm excited to see what comes out of there.
[24:18.230 --> 24:21.710]  And hopefully it'll be leaning towards that, mom.
[24:21.710 --> 24:26.510]  But you know, obviously a little bit.
[24:26.510 --> 24:28.190]  Cut some of that is really nice, too.
[24:28.190 --> 24:32.750]  So really pumped to see what's going on in there.
[24:32.750 --> 24:38.150]  I've been making more recently these past couple of years, like these other guys, some
[24:38.150 --> 24:39.150]  of my own inputs.
[24:39.150 --> 24:47.430]  I got some labs going right now that I will be using to make some Bokashi that I'm going
[24:47.430 --> 24:50.190]  to be inoculating my soil for this with.
[24:50.190 --> 25:01.190]  So I'll have a custom blend of a few different organic mixes and some disorganics amendments,
[25:01.190 --> 25:09.470]  some beneficial biology like bacillus subtilis, trichoderma.
[25:09.470 --> 25:14.430]  I'll probably put some Bavaria bassiana early on, preventative.
[25:14.430 --> 25:16.710]  Sure, sure.
[25:16.710 --> 25:18.230]  One transplant into...
[25:18.230 --> 25:22.230]  You're going to throw some Stimernina in there, too?
[25:22.230 --> 25:23.230]  Say again?
[25:23.230 --> 25:26.230]  You're going to throw in some Stimernina, Feltya?
[25:26.230 --> 25:29.230]  I think I pronounced that right.
[25:29.230 --> 25:30.230]  No, no.
[25:30.270 --> 25:31.270]  That's the epidermis.
[25:31.270 --> 25:32.270]  Oh, the epidermis.
[25:32.270 --> 25:33.270]  Okay.
[25:33.270 --> 25:34.270]  Yeah.
[25:34.270 --> 25:35.270]  You went full science on me, bro.
[25:35.270 --> 25:36.270]  Yeah, I hit blast this meal.
[25:36.270 --> 25:37.270]  I'm going to get some.
[25:37.270 --> 25:46.270]  I probably will start right off with them, but I will get some and add some in there,
[25:46.270 --> 25:47.270]  too.
[25:47.270 --> 25:48.270]  But thanks for mentioning that.
[25:48.270 --> 25:49.270]  Yeah.
[25:49.270 --> 25:50.270]  It's important.
[25:50.270 --> 26:00.990]  And I'll probably finish it in a seven gallon, I think, of soil that I'm going to top dress
[26:00.990 --> 26:07.430]  prior to flower and then a little bit into flower twice.
[26:07.430 --> 26:16.830]  The SST from fill the soil and then bloom top dress, some more Bokashi and water microbes
[26:16.830 --> 26:20.110]  through the water.
[26:20.110 --> 26:22.510]  Be careful with that SST.
[26:22.510 --> 26:26.270]  I have fried plants with SST.
[26:26.270 --> 26:28.990]  More isn't always better.
[26:28.990 --> 26:35.190]  Less more often or less less often sometimes.
[26:35.190 --> 26:36.830]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:36.830 --> 26:37.990]  You only need a little, man.
[26:37.990 --> 26:39.470]  I was like, no, we're going to go heavy.
[26:39.470 --> 26:43.310]  And I walked back in the room the next morning, I was like, oh, fuck.
[26:43.310 --> 26:48.190]  Organics really teaches you that too much of a good thing is still a bad thing.
[26:48.190 --> 26:49.190]  Exactly.
[26:49.190 --> 26:50.190]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:50.190 --> 26:56.350]  You want to get that is it's it's not cheap, but it's not expensive either is like alfalfa
[26:56.350 --> 27:00.910]  seed for sprouting, too, because I noticed that the SST blends don't have the alfalfa
[27:00.910 --> 27:04.230]  and I really want that tricotin in there.
[27:04.230 --> 27:05.230]  Yeah.
[27:05.230 --> 27:08.150]  I'm messing with that same stuff right now.
[27:08.150 --> 27:11.150]  I just got a bag to do that exact same thing.
[27:11.150 --> 27:12.150]  Yeah.
[27:12.230 --> 27:17.390]  I mean, I guess this SST with just, you know, my beans, you know, I would just sprout a
[27:17.390 --> 27:21.590]  bunch of those is like what's better than to put, you know, cannabis sprout, you know,
[27:21.590 --> 27:22.590]  right back into cannabis.
[27:22.590 --> 27:23.590]  For sure, man.
[27:23.590 --> 27:27.750]  That'd be great to have some hemp seed, cannabis seed right in there, too.
[27:27.750 --> 27:29.150]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[27:29.150 --> 27:30.150]  Yeah.
[27:30.150 --> 27:33.830]  Me and Chad were just talking about that the other day because I did my first little bit
[27:33.830 --> 27:36.110]  of breeding out back this year.
[27:36.110 --> 27:38.870]  And like my plants, like I intended them to be small.
[27:38.870 --> 27:40.590]  They're like 12 feet tall.
[27:40.590 --> 27:47.590]  So like even the few beans I took out of them, like it's a fucking half gallon jar.
[27:47.590 --> 27:48.590]  Make some sprout tea, man.
[27:48.590 --> 27:49.590]  You might as well.
[27:49.590 --> 27:50.590]  That's what I just thought when he said that.
[27:50.590 --> 27:54.470]  I'm like, man, I might have to do that because that just sounds luxurious.
[27:54.470 --> 27:55.470]  You know what I mean?
[27:55.470 --> 27:58.910]  Take a handful of cannabis seeds and just phew.
[27:58.910 --> 28:01.150]  Sprout them and blend them.
[28:01.150 --> 28:02.150]  Cannabis cannibalism.
[28:02.150 --> 28:03.150]  That's the thing.
[28:03.150 --> 28:06.550]  That's the ones you don't have to make selections for, right?
[28:06.550 --> 28:10.990]  You can just throw a handful into an area and then have a ton of seeds just for SST.
[28:10.990 --> 28:14.910]  Dude, and then you can just justify it like a quickening from the Highlander.
[28:14.910 --> 28:18.190]  You're just putting them all into that one batch.
[28:18.190 --> 28:19.190]  Done.
[28:19.190 --> 28:20.190]  Done.
[28:20.190 --> 28:26.750]  I've got a ton of seeds and here's my other not selection.
[28:26.750 --> 28:29.430]  I think the shotgun approach is the best with the SST.
[28:29.430 --> 28:31.630]  That's why I like the Coot mix.
[28:31.630 --> 28:36.530]  He's got the, well, they got rid of the hemp seeds because they were sprouting in people's
[28:36.530 --> 28:37.530]  pots.
[28:37.530 --> 28:43.970]  I think they have flax now, but it's the two row malted barley.
[28:43.970 --> 28:48.170]  Then I believe it's yellow corn, but I really think that there's, I like the blue corn.
[28:48.170 --> 28:50.050]  I've been playing around with the blue corn too.
[28:50.050 --> 28:51.050]  Alex, how are you?
[28:51.050 --> 28:54.050]  I'm a hater of blue corn.
[28:54.050 --> 29:00.090]  Well, shoot, since we had you up there and I know, John, you were the one that came through
[29:00.090 --> 29:02.890]  with the nematodes with the proper name.
[29:02.890 --> 29:05.930]  I just like saying kookamaris because it's like salsa.
[29:06.330 --> 29:07.330]  It's just a fun word to say.
[29:07.330 --> 29:08.330]  So the M-Lisa's kookamaris.
[29:08.330 --> 29:09.330]  Different insect predator.
[29:09.330 --> 29:12.410]  Well, they keep changing the names on us.
[29:12.410 --> 29:14.410]  Before it was like Stradiolelap schimitis.
[29:14.410 --> 29:18.690]  Now it's like Hephaestus miles or they changed the other way around.
[29:18.690 --> 29:21.970]  Yeah, they changed Hippoaspis mealus to something else.
[29:21.970 --> 29:22.970]  And I'm like, no, it's Hippoaspis.
[29:22.970 --> 29:23.970]  Sorry.
[29:23.970 --> 29:24.970]  That's what I stay with.
[29:24.970 --> 29:25.970]  Yeah, I wouldn't even know what he was saying either.
[29:25.970 --> 29:31.370]  Like I have nematodes in my pot and I just would have been like, nope, I don't have them
[29:31.370 --> 29:34.850]  for whatever Jimmy said.
[29:34.850 --> 29:38.530]  I love doing things phonetically too with these words, because most of the times I just
[29:38.530 --> 29:42.610]  read them in a paper and don't actually hear them for a long time until I get to have a
[29:42.610 --> 29:43.890]  conversation with someone.
[29:43.890 --> 29:45.570]  So I make up my own pronunciations.
[29:45.570 --> 29:46.770]  I'm like, absolutely.
[29:46.770 --> 29:47.770]  It's the Hippoaspis.
[29:47.770 --> 29:49.250]  That was my thing.
[29:49.250 --> 29:55.850]  Coming into the regulated market, I've worked with MSOs.
[29:55.850 --> 30:02.850]  I've been to multiple states, writing SOPs and my specialty, my area of specialty is
[30:02.850 --> 30:04.090]  IPM.
[30:04.330 --> 30:10.090]  I was state trained by the California State DPR on the laws and regulations.
[30:10.090 --> 30:15.650]  And with that, it came with an understanding of how everything works, why it works.
[30:15.650 --> 30:21.770]  And so I come into these conversations, completely mispronouncing everything, but speaking absolutely
[30:21.770 --> 30:24.050]  100% confident in what I know.
[30:24.050 --> 30:27.410]  And then they're looking at me like, the hell did he just say?
[30:27.410 --> 30:28.970]  And then they correct me.
[30:28.970 --> 30:30.730]  These are book educated people.
[30:30.730 --> 30:32.770]  I've never been a book educated person.
[30:32.770 --> 30:34.730]  I didn't go to college for this shit.
[30:34.730 --> 30:37.530]  It's just what I love doing.
[30:37.530 --> 30:42.970]  And for a while there, when I started a family, I had to go out and get the family job with
[30:42.970 --> 30:45.090]  the benefits and all that stuff.
[30:45.090 --> 30:50.490]  And that's how I was able to work so close with DPR at the state level.
[30:50.490 --> 30:53.210]  I was a state employee for a while there.
[30:53.210 --> 30:59.090]  And thankfully, I injured myself on the job because all I was doing was dealing with gnarly
[30:59.090 --> 31:00.090]  pesticides.
[31:00.610 --> 31:07.570]  And of course in cannabis, I mean, don't get me wrong, back in the day, I'm guilty, guilty
[31:07.570 --> 31:13.450]  of AVID and Eagle 20, 25 years.
[31:13.450 --> 31:18.410]  And I had no respect or no knowledge of IPM, none of that stuff.
[31:18.410 --> 31:22.170]  And so I was just making these gnarly applications, not knowing what the hell I'm doing.
[31:22.170 --> 31:24.170]  And then now I get all educated and all this stuff.
[31:24.170 --> 31:27.170]  I look back and I go, oh, geez.
[31:27.170 --> 31:28.170]  Wow.
[31:28.170 --> 31:29.170]  Yes.
[31:29.250 --> 31:30.250]  Yeah.
[31:30.250 --> 31:34.090]  I mean, Potent Ponics in chat is making a good point too.
[31:34.090 --> 31:39.330]  And I remember from working commercially myself to apply any of those, to work on the IPM
[31:39.330 --> 31:46.410]  team, you have to take the state pesticide applicators license test, which it's good
[31:46.410 --> 31:47.410]  to know.
[31:47.410 --> 31:48.410]  Good things to have.
[31:48.410 --> 31:49.410]  Yeah.
[31:49.410 --> 31:50.410]  I'm a QAC.
[31:50.410 --> 31:55.850]  I have to do continued education hours every year to keep my license.
[31:55.850 --> 32:00.450]  Every place that I've worked for, I basically do all the recommendations.
[32:00.450 --> 32:03.130]  I work in the Salinas Valley and I've always worked in the Salinas Valley.
[32:03.130 --> 32:04.970]  I know how that valley works.
[32:04.970 --> 32:11.250]  I mean, IPM isn't a copy and paste type of thing.
[32:11.250 --> 32:13.690]  It's different for every situation.
[32:13.690 --> 32:18.650]  You could have one farm in one spot and just half a mile down the road, they've got a different
[32:18.650 --> 32:19.650]  issue.
[32:19.650 --> 32:24.450]  And the pest pressures in the Salinas Valley are no joke.
[32:24.450 --> 32:26.290]  What is it hot and dry there?
[32:26.290 --> 32:29.090]  What's Salinas Valley's temperatures like?
[32:29.090 --> 32:38.210]  Salinas Valley, it's the vegetable bowl, the salad bowl of the United States, basically.
[32:38.210 --> 32:39.890]  It's like right now we're getting cold.
[32:39.890 --> 32:41.890]  It is super cold and dry right now.
[32:41.890 --> 32:47.010]  We're getting down into the low forties, 20% humidity right now.
[32:47.010 --> 32:49.050]  A lot of the fields are resting right now.
[32:49.050 --> 32:56.150]  So I'm not having issues with big pest populations popping up right now.
[32:56.150 --> 32:57.290]  They're just going dormant.
[32:57.290 --> 32:59.490]  They're just waiting to explode on you.
[32:59.490 --> 33:00.490]  Yeah.
[33:00.490 --> 33:01.490]  And they do.
[33:01.490 --> 33:05.690]  We've got these nice, warm cannabis greenhouses that are just, ah, that's the great place
[33:05.690 --> 33:06.810]  to be.
[33:06.810 --> 33:13.850]  So using banker plants and using companion planting and all of that comes into play when
[33:13.850 --> 33:18.650]  you're dealing with cannabis because we're so limited on what we can use, which I'm thankful
[33:18.650 --> 33:19.650]  for.
[33:19.650 --> 33:21.730]  I don't use a lot of heavy oils.
[33:21.730 --> 33:25.850]  I've never agreed with applying oils to plants.
[33:25.850 --> 33:29.150]  However, in the Salinas Valley, it's necessary.
[33:29.150 --> 33:30.330]  You don't have an option.
[33:30.330 --> 33:33.970]  I had friends up in Mendocino and Humboldt County who were like, hey man, find us some
[33:33.970 --> 33:34.970]  greenhouse space.
[33:34.970 --> 33:40.210]  And I'm like, you don't want to be down here, bro.
[33:40.210 --> 33:45.850]  I never saw an aphid on cannabis until I went to the Salinas Valley.
[33:45.850 --> 33:50.350]  Up in Mendocino for the longest time, hemp aphid was just not a thing.
[33:50.350 --> 33:53.970]  You never saw aphids on cannabis, period.
[33:53.970 --> 34:00.210]  And five years ago, we started getting that bang aphid in the Salinas Valley and it just
[34:00.210 --> 34:01.670]  hit a ton of bricks.
[34:01.670 --> 34:05.310]  No one knew how to get a hold of it, get a quick handle on it.
[34:05.310 --> 34:07.090]  We don't have a lot of knockdowns.
[34:07.090 --> 34:12.690]  We just recently, I think, are able to start applying pyganic as our only type of knockdown.
[34:12.690 --> 34:18.330]  Everything else is an IGR.
[34:18.330 --> 34:23.250]  Learning how to use beneficials to combat the aphid problem was probably one of the
[34:23.250 --> 34:33.010]  biggest breakthroughs for me in using aphidius colmani in my nurseries and keeping banker
[34:33.010 --> 34:37.050]  plants that had bird cherry oat aphid on them.
[34:37.050 --> 34:39.030]  They only stayed on that cereal grass.
[34:39.030 --> 34:44.870]  I could have that plant touching cannabis plants on the bench and those aphids would
[34:44.870 --> 34:46.470]  not go to the cannabis plant.
[34:46.470 --> 34:49.670]  They stayed on that cereal grass.
[34:49.670 --> 34:53.890]  Then I would keep sweet alyssum up overhead in the pots.
[34:53.890 --> 34:58.230]  The sweet alyssum feeds the aphidius colmani.
[34:58.230 --> 35:03.350]  The aphidius colmani reproduces on the bird cherry oat aphid when you don't have a hemp
[35:03.350 --> 35:06.910]  aphid population in your nursery.
[35:06.910 --> 35:11.550]  Every bit of knowledge to all the guys out there in commercial farming, when you're dealing
[35:11.550 --> 35:16.910]  with something like that, having that type of system in your nursery is just a damn near
[35:16.910 --> 35:18.470]  a necessity at this point.
[35:18.470 --> 35:19.470]  That's dope.
[35:19.470 --> 35:20.470]  I deal with aphids here.
[35:20.470 --> 35:26.510]  I run a lot of plants inside here and I deal with aphids every year.
[35:26.510 --> 35:31.470]  If you could find a place like Beneficial Insectary or some type of insectary up in
[35:31.470 --> 35:38.670]  your area that has aphidius colmani, really awesome parasitic wasp goes in, injects one
[35:38.670 --> 35:41.430]  egg into the host.
[35:41.430 --> 35:44.750]  That host goes from larva to pupa to full state.
[35:44.750 --> 35:49.230]  You could see when you flip over your leaves and you'll see, wow, those are mummified.
[35:49.230 --> 35:52.870]  They've actually been parasitized to the point where they're frozen.
[35:52.870 --> 36:00.590]  Then eventually that little aphidius colmani cuts a little hole up the ass, flies out and
[36:00.710 --> 36:02.710]  starts the process all over again.
[36:02.710 --> 36:06.710]  That's a fascinating fucking world.
[36:06.710 --> 36:07.710]  That's awesome.
[36:07.710 --> 36:10.710]  I have root houses.
[36:10.710 --> 36:13.710]  They're not super sealed, but they're sealed now.
[36:13.710 --> 36:14.710]  Sure.
[36:14.710 --> 36:15.710]  Yep.
[36:15.710 --> 36:22.710]  Well, real quick too, I want to finish introducing John here real quick.
[36:22.710 --> 36:23.710]  No worries.
[36:23.710 --> 36:24.710]  It's a nice palm.
[36:24.710 --> 36:25.710]  Way to go.
[36:25.710 --> 36:26.710]  Good job.
[36:26.710 --> 36:27.710]  I see you're a single man.
[36:27.710 --> 36:28.710]  All right, John.
[36:28.710 --> 36:29.710]  I kind of stole the stage there for a second.
[36:29.830 --> 36:30.830]  Sorry about that.
[36:30.830 --> 36:33.830]  I hope the stage is here.
[36:33.830 --> 36:34.830]  Yep.
[36:34.830 --> 36:39.830]  John, too, you take a pretty scientific approach.
[36:39.830 --> 36:41.830]  We've talked more than a few times.
[36:41.830 --> 36:43.830]  It's more of a holistic approach.
[36:43.830 --> 36:48.830]  You are going to get a few of these hippy dippy types of things from John.
[36:48.830 --> 36:51.830]  But John is also an award winner.
[36:51.830 --> 36:55.830]  Now, it's mainly the concentrates that you're winning it for, right?
[36:55.830 --> 36:58.830]  Are you growing the flower yourself or are you taking home flower as well?
[36:58.950 --> 37:01.950]  Well, I've won a couple.
[37:01.950 --> 37:02.950]  50-50.
[37:02.950 --> 37:04.950]  Yeah, it's about 50-50 actually.
[37:04.950 --> 37:05.950]  50-50.
[37:05.950 --> 37:06.950]  He's right.
[37:06.950 --> 37:07.950]  He's right.
[37:07.950 --> 37:10.950]  He's right because I had to think about it.
[37:10.950 --> 37:14.950]  I'm a great grower, but everybody can do this.
[37:14.950 --> 37:15.950]  This is the whole thing.
[37:15.950 --> 37:17.950]  I don't want to play.
[37:17.950 --> 37:20.950]  I'm just starting to get confident in my abilities.
[37:20.950 --> 37:27.950]  I've been doing this for a long time, but now I am onto this more sustainable regenerative.
[37:28.070 --> 37:30.070]  I'm not there yet.
[37:30.070 --> 37:32.070]  I have my worm bin over here.
[37:32.070 --> 37:34.070]  I know he was talking about that.
[37:34.070 --> 37:39.070]  I have the circulating worm bin, the hungry bin.
[37:39.070 --> 37:45.070]  I believe a guy from New Zealand invented that out of the old recycle bins.
[37:45.070 --> 37:48.070]  But that way you don't have all these trays because I'm 54.
[37:48.070 --> 37:49.070]  I'm getting older.
[37:49.070 --> 37:52.070]  I don't want to be carrying or moving stuff around.
[37:52.070 --> 37:55.070]  So I haven't incorporated the worms yet.
[37:55.190 --> 37:58.190]  But they are feasting and it's magnificent in there.
[37:58.190 --> 38:02.190]  Even all the mites that are amazing.
[38:02.190 --> 38:06.190]  But it's still kind of outdoors.
[38:06.190 --> 38:09.190]  It's different than bringing it indoors and then it's in the house.
[38:09.190 --> 38:14.190]  And then the way, you know, I don't like it's bad enough with the fungus gnats.
[38:14.190 --> 38:16.190]  So I definitely use the SF.
[38:16.190 --> 38:18.190]  Oh, there we go.
[38:18.190 --> 38:20.190]  That's how I roll.
[38:20.310 --> 38:26.310]  But yeah, so I've been just having some success because I never gave up.
[38:26.310 --> 38:30.310]  I just, I got jaded by a few contests.
[38:30.310 --> 38:34.310]  But then I just kept doing it because I said, you know, if I don't enter, you can't win.
[38:34.310 --> 38:38.310]  And I still believe that I can still grow fire.
[38:38.310 --> 38:44.310]  So it's like, and all of you and all these other people, I'm not a monopoly on that.
[38:44.310 --> 38:47.310]  It's just not a lot of those people are entering too.
[38:47.430 --> 38:54.430]  So that's what, like those, in the beginning, it was more of like, oh, now it's like the door, the floodgates are open.
[38:54.430 --> 38:56.430]  All these wonderful people that I'm meeting.
[38:56.430 --> 38:58.430]  I've kind of put myself out there.
[38:58.430 --> 39:00.430]  This is something I never wanted to talk about.
[39:00.430 --> 39:03.430]  I've been doing this since, you know, the 90s.
[39:03.430 --> 39:07.430]  So it's like in a very small scale, never anything.
[39:07.430 --> 39:09.430]  It was more just my medicine.
[39:09.430 --> 39:12.430]  But now I feel like this is the voice that we need to get out.
[39:12.550 --> 39:16.550]  Not that, you know, we should all grow our own medicine because we know what's in it.
[39:16.550 --> 39:24.550]  But the further we get away from the chemicals and more sustainability and all the things that we know that we could do,
[39:24.550 --> 39:28.550]  but we're just either lazy not to or worried about trying something new.
[39:28.550 --> 39:31.550]  So this evolution's been for me.
[39:31.550 --> 39:33.550]  I started with rock wool.
[39:33.550 --> 39:35.550]  You know what I mean?
[39:35.670 --> 39:44.670]  But for the past couple, you know, and then you start to understand about the whole, you know, food and soil web
[39:44.670 --> 39:51.670]  and how much it really means to our whole, us as, you know, these living beings and what we put in our bodies.
[39:51.670 --> 39:54.670]  We're so concerned about this one plant that we're growing.
[39:54.670 --> 39:56.670]  It enlightens us.
[39:56.670 --> 40:00.670]  It makes us, once we are aware, we have to change a lot of the things we do.
[40:00.790 --> 40:02.790]  And we're not perfect.
[40:02.790 --> 40:06.790]  But now I want to be, practice what I preach.
[40:06.790 --> 40:10.790]  I want to, like, I don't want to, these are all the things that I now know.
[40:10.790 --> 40:14.790]  So I'm, you know, trying to work them in any way that I can.
[40:14.790 --> 40:18.790]  I'm a diabetic, type 1 diabetic, so I take insulin.
[40:18.790 --> 40:22.790]  I understand, you know, how important nutrition is.
[40:22.790 --> 40:24.790]  My mom's a celiac.
[40:24.910 --> 40:31.910]  I see this plant being the teacher for us all to kind of educate us on.
[40:31.910 --> 40:32.910]  I don't know.
[40:32.910 --> 40:34.910]  I'm just kind of going off on a tangent.
[40:34.910 --> 40:41.910]  But I'm really passionate about this plant and what it can teach people, what it has taught me,
[40:41.910 --> 40:45.910]  and what I'm almost surprised I never learned about and what they don't teach us.
[40:45.910 --> 40:50.910]  Almost horrified being 54 and being like, well, how did we have this so backwards?
[40:51.030 --> 40:55.030]  This is like, and then you just see all the powers, all the things where
[40:55.030 --> 41:00.030]  all big businesses and corporations have been behind not succeeding
[41:00.030 --> 41:04.030]  and selling all the chemicals and then selling a bigger problem.
[41:04.030 --> 41:07.030]  You know, you got the problem and now we're going to sell you something for the problem.
[41:07.030 --> 41:10.030]  It's like, and it's just, you know, we didn't,
[41:10.030 --> 41:13.030]  when I first got interviewed by Chad Westward,
[41:13.030 --> 41:16.030]  if we haven't learned from the dust bowl, like, this is,
[41:16.030 --> 41:18.030]  and nobody wanted to listen to Steiner either.
[41:18.150 --> 41:21.150]  And it's just like this plant, I wouldn't know about all these things
[41:21.150 --> 41:22.150]  if it wasn't for this plant.
[41:22.150 --> 41:26.150]  So it's kind of like, and it is my medicine.
[41:26.150 --> 41:27.150]  It's my medicine.
[41:27.150 --> 41:30.150]  I'm like, without it, I'm a nervous wreck.
[41:30.150 --> 41:32.150]  So it makes me happy.
[41:32.150 --> 41:33.150]  It gives me joy.
[41:33.150 --> 41:37.150]  And, you know, and it's been stigmatized so long.
[41:37.150 --> 41:40.150]  Like now I want to be a champion for this plant.
[41:40.150 --> 41:44.150]  And, you know, but I also want to practice what I preach.
[41:44.150 --> 41:46.150]  It's easy to say things.
[41:46.270 --> 41:50.270]  Now I'm trying to put this, take it to heart and put it to practice.
[41:50.270 --> 41:52.270]  But I've teamed up with the chef.
[41:52.270 --> 41:55.270]  I met the chef and we've just been going there
[41:55.270 --> 41:59.270]  because now our mission is to be like, the little guy can do this.
[41:59.270 --> 42:02.270]  Hey, you can grow your best medicine at home.
[42:02.270 --> 42:05.270]  It doesn't take you going to this dispensary.
[42:05.270 --> 42:09.270]  It takes, you know, there's, and a lot of things that we can't explain,
[42:09.270 --> 42:11.270]  the science of the unexplainable.
[42:11.270 --> 42:14.270]  And, you know, what you put in was what you get out.
[42:14.390 --> 42:17.390]  And kind of maybe awaken people to be, you know,
[42:17.390 --> 42:20.390]  this green rush, maybe it'd be a health rush, really.
[42:20.390 --> 42:21.390]  You know?
[42:21.390 --> 42:26.390]  I'd love to see that because it has taught me more about like my gut body.
[42:26.390 --> 42:28.390]  It has taught me to eat healthier.
[42:28.390 --> 42:32.390]  And I am getting more hippie as DP would say to me.
[42:32.390 --> 42:34.390]  I'm getting hippier by the day.
[42:34.390 --> 42:37.390]  But a lot of it does start with good genetics.
[42:37.390 --> 42:40.390]  So here we are.
[42:40.390 --> 42:42.390]  This is the start.
[42:42.510 --> 42:44.510]  This is where we're all going.
[42:44.510 --> 42:47.510]  Our lemon, oh, finally it focuses as soon as I move it.
[42:47.510 --> 42:48.510]  Thanks.
[42:48.510 --> 42:55.510]  But the lemon degreaser, we got our Myers Creek tester seeds here.
[42:55.510 --> 42:56.510]  Nice.
[42:56.510 --> 42:57.510]  So, yeah.
[42:57.510 --> 43:01.510]  I like hearing that motor breath because I've been running this hot rod,
[43:01.510 --> 43:04.510]  which is the motor breath 15 across to the grandpa's breath.
[43:04.510 --> 43:05.510]  From Dungeon?
[43:05.510 --> 43:07.510]  And that's like, that's really, yeah, yeah.
[43:07.510 --> 43:09.510]  Eric from DG.
[43:09.630 --> 43:12.630]  I actually did have that.
[43:12.630 --> 43:17.630]  I didn't win, but I had a beautiful representation of that.
[43:17.630 --> 43:20.630]  And I have actually two pinos of that.
[43:20.630 --> 43:22.630]  But, yeah.
[43:22.630 --> 43:23.630]  So I'm excited.
[43:23.630 --> 43:24.630]  We love the gas.
[43:24.630 --> 43:28.630]  We love, yeah, man, I love.
[43:28.630 --> 43:30.630]  Let me know.
[43:30.630 --> 43:33.630]  To your point about being hippier and all that stuff.
[43:33.630 --> 43:37.630]  When I started growing, I don't even think we had the internet.
[43:37.750 --> 43:38.750]  Right.
[43:38.750 --> 43:40.750]  We're older than Google.
[43:40.750 --> 43:45.750]  You were only as good of a grower as the group of friends that you had.
[43:45.750 --> 43:48.750]  So if you had shitty growers, guess what?
[43:48.750 --> 43:50.750]  You're a shitty grower too.
[43:50.750 --> 43:54.750]  And so then I found a couple of books.
[43:54.750 --> 43:58.750]  We ran through the Jorge's books and Ed's books.
[43:58.750 --> 44:02.750]  And they really were those first little baby steps for me.
[44:02.750 --> 44:06.750]  And the one that opened it up for me, that just, whoa,
[44:06.870 --> 44:12.870]  all the puzzle pieces fell into place was Rodel's organic composting, organic gardening.
[44:12.870 --> 44:13.870]  Wow.
[44:13.870 --> 44:15.870]  And that's a traditional book.
[44:15.870 --> 44:16.870]  Yeah.
[44:16.870 --> 44:17.870]  That's not.
[44:17.870 --> 44:18.870]  Yeah.
[44:18.870 --> 44:21.870]  I mean, it was a book I found in a thrift store or something like that.
[44:21.870 --> 44:26.870]  And it was like, you know, publication was like the early 60s or late 50s.
[44:26.870 --> 44:27.870]  Wow.
[44:27.870 --> 44:35.870]  But everything in it, like, is still 100% relevant as to the food soil web,
[44:35.990 --> 44:36.990]  like John was just talking about.
[44:36.990 --> 44:38.990]  Like it all made sense for me.
[44:38.990 --> 44:39.990]  It was like, okay, cool.
[44:39.990 --> 44:40.990]  Now I've got this in my arsenal.
[44:40.990 --> 44:43.990]  And so now whenever I get new growers coming up,
[44:43.990 --> 44:45.990]  hey, what did you read?
[44:45.990 --> 44:48.990]  And I always tell them, find Rodel Institute.
[44:48.990 --> 44:50.990]  You know, those guys do amazing work.
[44:50.990 --> 44:51.990]  I'm not here plugging them.
[44:51.990 --> 44:54.990]  I'm just saying like, when I found that book,
[44:54.990 --> 44:58.990]  everything that I had read like, whew, made sense.
[44:58.990 --> 45:01.990]  They're an institution.
[45:01.990 --> 45:02.990]  Yeah.
[45:02.990 --> 45:04.990]  They're world renowned.
[45:05.110 --> 45:06.110]  Yeah.
[45:06.110 --> 45:08.110]  And so I took that and I not only applied it to my cannabis,
[45:08.110 --> 45:11.110]  but then like applied it to my own personal vegetable gardening,
[45:11.110 --> 45:14.110]  you know, and it was like you said, you know,
[45:14.110 --> 45:18.110]  the best food and the best weed comes from your backyard.
[45:18.110 --> 45:21.110]  You know, you grow your own food.
[45:21.110 --> 45:23.110]  There's just something about it, man.
[45:23.110 --> 45:27.110]  Like the tomatoes taste better, you know,
[45:27.110 --> 45:28.110]  than what you find at the store.
[45:28.110 --> 45:29.110]  Just everything tastes better.
[45:29.110 --> 45:31.110]  Maybe it's psychosomatic because you did it yourself.
[45:31.110 --> 45:34.110]  But at the same time, it's like, no, it does taste better.
[45:34.230 --> 45:36.230]  You know, so yeah.
[45:36.230 --> 45:37.230]  Shout out to all the home growers.
[45:37.230 --> 45:38.230]  Keep doing your thing.
[45:38.230 --> 45:41.230]  Without sounding too hippie, it is about connecting with the plant.
[45:41.230 --> 45:44.230]  Because once you connect with the plant, the plant, like,
[45:44.230 --> 45:47.230]  I don't know, I've actually taken it to heart now by actually trying
[45:47.230 --> 45:50.230]  to pop seeds on the full moon, which I wanted to ask about that.
[45:50.230 --> 45:54.230]  But also putting it in my mouth and, you know,
[45:54.230 --> 45:58.230]  dealing with, you know, letting it know my own vibrations
[45:58.230 --> 45:59.230]  and my body.
[45:59.230 --> 46:02.230]  And I really think there's something to that.
[46:02.350 --> 46:05.350]  And I know sottos have been doing that for hundreds and hundreds
[46:05.350 --> 46:06.350]  of years.
[46:06.350 --> 46:09.350]  So it can't, you know, it can't hurt.
[46:09.350 --> 46:13.350]  And I really feel that ever since I started doing that,
[46:13.350 --> 46:19.350]  germination, well, germination's always pretty good.
[46:19.350 --> 46:22.350]  But just the plants have been, I'm getting stellar plants.
[46:22.350 --> 46:25.350]  And I don't know if they know what I need.
[46:25.350 --> 46:27.350]  They maybe know what I need now.
[46:27.350 --> 46:30.350]  I think there's, I mean, we connect on the plant in so many ways.
[46:30.470 --> 46:33.470]  Like even centering yourself before you're in the grow room.
[46:33.470 --> 46:36.470]  There's all these little things that I do now because,
[46:36.470 --> 46:39.470]  and I talk to them, I sing to them, I play music for them.
[46:39.470 --> 46:41.470]  I don't know.
[46:41.470 --> 46:42.470]  I went through that phase too.
[46:42.470 --> 46:44.470]  Yeah, I went through that phase too, where there was always music
[46:44.470 --> 46:47.470]  in the room and just nothing but positive.
[46:47.470 --> 46:48.470]  Crystals.
[46:48.470 --> 46:50.470]  I find it's not even necessarily.
[46:50.470 --> 46:52.470]  You know, I haven't done that though.
[46:52.470 --> 46:54.470]  I believe in the crystals.
[46:54.470 --> 46:58.470]  One thing works better than the other, just when you're putting
[46:58.590 --> 47:02.590]  that much care into it, in the garden, you're touching each plant.
[47:02.590 --> 47:03.590]  It's like hand watering.
[47:03.590 --> 47:05.590]  I'll have 200 plants in that room.
[47:05.590 --> 47:08.590]  I pick up every single one every single day.
[47:08.590 --> 47:09.590]  I don't give a shit.
[47:09.590 --> 47:11.590]  What's that old saying?
[47:11.590 --> 47:15.590]  Your plants and your relationship are a direct reflection
[47:15.590 --> 47:17.590]  of the attention you give them.
[47:17.590 --> 47:20.590]  You know, so on that note.
[47:20.590 --> 47:22.590]  Intention, yes.
[47:22.590 --> 47:25.590]  If you put that much attention and love into your plant,
[47:25.590 --> 47:27.590]  put it into your family too.
[47:27.710 --> 47:29.710]  Intention, that it's a medicine that you're making.
[47:29.710 --> 47:31.710]  Not that it's these greenbacks.
[47:31.710 --> 47:36.710]  Not that it's, you know, which is great too, but it can be both.
[47:36.710 --> 47:41.710]  Oh yeah, I mean, I came in with a mom who, I mean, my mom,
[47:41.710 --> 47:42.710]  she's amazing.
[47:42.710 --> 47:47.710]  You know, she believed in the power of this plant and she did not consume it.
[47:47.710 --> 47:49.710]  She did not have anything to do with it.
[47:49.710 --> 47:50.710]  She didn't smoke weed.
[47:50.710 --> 47:52.710]  My dad was the pothead.
[47:52.710 --> 47:54.710]  You know, my mom was just there, you know.
[47:54.830 --> 47:57.830]  And even after my parents had separated, you know,
[47:57.830 --> 48:00.830]  my mom kind of like, no, this hemp thing is something,
[48:00.830 --> 48:01.830]  you know, something to do with it.
[48:01.830 --> 48:04.830]  And when I was younger, you know, my mom with hemp was like,
[48:04.830 --> 48:07.830]  it was almost like, you know, it was almost Tourette's with her.
[48:07.830 --> 48:09.830]  It just was like hemp, hemp, hemp, hemp.
[48:09.830 --> 48:11.830]  All she talked about was hemp, you know, to the point where it was like,
[48:11.830 --> 48:12.830]  it'd be embarrassing.
[48:12.830 --> 48:14.830]  I'd be like, okay, mom, we get it.
[48:14.830 --> 48:15.830]  We get it.
[48:15.830 --> 48:20.830]  You know, and here it is 25 years later and she's still talking about hemp.
[48:20.830 --> 48:22.830]  And now that it's legal, I'm like, well, now what are you going to do?
[48:22.950 --> 48:24.950]  You know, I'm like, you're going to actually relax, you know,
[48:24.950 --> 48:28.950]  because she literally, you know, I didn't graduate college.
[48:28.950 --> 48:30.950]  Shit, I didn't even graduate high school, you know.
[48:30.950 --> 48:34.950]  And she went out there and was like, you know,
[48:34.950 --> 48:36.950]  I'm going to make what you do legal.
[48:36.950 --> 48:38.950]  I'm going to do whatever I can to do it.
[48:38.950 --> 48:42.950]  And she got arrested, you know, at the state capital for this plant.
[48:42.950 --> 48:44.950]  You know, she went out and petitioned for 215.
[48:44.950 --> 48:48.950]  She made this shit happen, you know, and she didn't even like,
[48:48.950 --> 48:50.950]  she didn't even smoke weed, you know.
[48:51.070 --> 48:55.070]  It wasn't until she got rheumatoid arthritis like 15 years ago
[48:55.070 --> 48:59.070]  that she actually started to use it and was able to substitute out
[48:59.070 --> 49:01.070]  some of the pain management, you know,
[49:01.070 --> 49:04.070]  medicine that she was using in place of, you know,
[49:04.070 --> 49:08.070]  consuming, you know, cannabis through ingestion or through smoking.
[49:08.070 --> 49:11.070]  And yeah, mom's is amazing, you know.
[49:11.070 --> 49:13.070]  Love you, ma.
[49:13.070 --> 49:17.070]  That's a powerful thing too, because again,
[49:17.070 --> 49:19.070]  she believed in you.
[49:19.190 --> 49:21.190]  She was okay with the plant, but she believed in you.
[49:21.190 --> 49:26.190]  And then that belief educated her when the time was right
[49:26.190 --> 49:28.190]  to start believing in the plant as well.
[49:28.190 --> 49:30.190]  That's amazing.
[49:30.190 --> 49:32.190]  Yeah, I got a dope ma too.
[49:32.190 --> 49:34.190]  She was always there to help me out.
[49:34.190 --> 49:36.190]  Yeah, nice.
[49:38.190 --> 49:43.190]  We're going to send that link over to Jimmy that John emailed over to you, Chad,
[49:43.190 --> 49:46.190]  from the Harvard Cannabis Center.
[49:46.190 --> 49:48.190]  Yeah, I don't know if you watched that yet.
[49:48.310 --> 49:50.310]  The first video I watched today.
[49:50.310 --> 49:52.310]  So on point.
[49:52.310 --> 49:54.310]  Yes, I want to hit that guy up for an interview.
[49:54.310 --> 49:56.310]  Oh, Dr. Raj.
[49:58.310 --> 50:01.310]  There was a, so I forget the initials of it,
[50:01.310 --> 50:03.310]  but it was a lecture series at Harvard.
[50:03.310 --> 50:05.310]  And John or Chef, you can fill it in here real quick.
[50:05.310 --> 50:08.310]  But John had sent me two of the lectures.
[50:08.310 --> 50:11.310]  The first one I watched basically is like, are you being lied to?
[50:11.310 --> 50:15.310]  Or is cannabis being misrepresented in the system?
[50:15.430 --> 50:17.430]  And of course it is.
[50:17.430 --> 50:19.430]  But this guy is a statistics geek.
[50:19.430 --> 50:21.430]  And he looked at the numbers and he looked at the testing.
[50:21.430 --> 50:24.430]  And he saw what sales numbers.
[50:24.430 --> 50:27.430]  It's pretty much got to have above 20% to sell in a store.
[50:27.430 --> 50:29.430]  And then he looks at all the testing.
[50:29.430 --> 50:34.430]  And statistically, there's little stagger, little stagger.
[50:34.430 --> 50:39.430]  And then you get to that 17 to 20% zone and nothing lands in there.
[50:39.430 --> 50:42.430]  Because every test group knows if you don't give it a 20%,
[50:42.430 --> 50:44.430]  it's not going to sell.
[50:44.550 --> 50:48.550]  He proved with statistics that, yeah, everything's not a board.
[50:48.550 --> 50:50.550]  I'm sorry, long-winded there.
[50:50.550 --> 50:52.550]  But what was the other one?
[50:52.550 --> 50:54.550]  I just want to mention the lecture series.
[50:54.550 --> 50:56.550]  I forgot.
[50:56.550 --> 51:01.550]  He also pointed out that these dispensaries were dropping
[51:01.550 --> 51:05.550]  all of their better cultivars because they weren't hitting that 20% mark
[51:05.550 --> 51:07.550]  because they weren't selling.
[51:07.550 --> 51:09.550]  So it's like, yeah, needed it to market.
[51:09.550 --> 51:12.550]  That's just, that's so unfortunate in the industry right now
[51:12.670 --> 51:16.670]  where we're so focused on THC levels.
[51:16.670 --> 51:20.670]  It's really a downer.
[51:20.670 --> 51:24.670]  And then you got these labs playing with the numbers
[51:24.670 --> 51:26.670]  just to appease the people.
[51:26.670 --> 51:31.670]  And trying to tell people, again, it's not the THC's there, man.
[51:31.670 --> 51:33.670]  It's all about the terpenes.
[51:33.670 --> 51:35.670]  You're looking for 2% to 3% terpenes.
[51:35.670 --> 51:37.670]  You can get those numbers, man.
[51:37.670 --> 51:40.670]  There's a huge differential written in the law up here in Canada.
[51:40.790 --> 51:44.790]  The labs are allowed to be off by some outlandish amount.
[51:44.790 --> 51:46.790]  Like for 8% or 12%.
[51:46.790 --> 51:48.790]  Oh, it's the same here, bro.
[51:48.790 --> 51:51.790]  They're allowed to have like 8% or 12% plus or minus.
[51:51.790 --> 51:53.790]  Yeah, that's exactly what I understood.
[51:53.790 --> 51:56.790]  Somewhere up to like 30% up in Canada.
[51:56.790 --> 51:58.790]  I was listening to something the other day.
[51:58.790 --> 52:00.790]  It's a lot of fluctuation of up to 30%.
[52:00.790 --> 52:03.790]  And it's like at that rate, you're making up your own numbers.
[52:03.790 --> 52:05.790]  Yeah, bro, yeah.
[52:05.790 --> 52:07.790]  That's what I mean.
[52:07.790 --> 52:09.790]  It could be 8%.
[52:09.910 --> 52:11.910]  It could be no one knows.
[52:11.910 --> 52:12.910]  Right.
[52:12.910 --> 52:14.910]  And here's the thing, too.
[52:14.910 --> 52:16.910]  The whole crux of the problem.
[52:16.910 --> 52:19.910]  Even if we were getting those numbers, there is still no standard.
[52:19.910 --> 52:23.910]  When you go to test an element like iron or manganese,
[52:23.910 --> 52:27.910]  there is a standard that gets loaded into every machine that is the exact same.
[52:27.910 --> 52:29.910]  We don't have that for cannabis.
[52:29.910 --> 52:31.910]  Aaron talked about it.
[52:31.910 --> 52:33.910]  It doesn't mean anything.
[52:33.910 --> 52:35.910]  Somebody brought that up as a point, too.
[52:35.910 --> 52:37.910]  As a question in the audience.
[52:38.030 --> 52:45.030]  The state of Massachusetts can't have subdivision of a master lab
[52:45.030 --> 52:48.030]  that all the other labs have to like, you know.
[52:48.030 --> 52:50.030]  Calibrate, basically.
[52:50.030 --> 52:57.030]  In the past, it failed miserably for state to be in charge of those things.
[52:57.030 --> 52:59.030]  States.
[52:59.030 --> 53:04.030]  The really cool thing was he figured out which labs were the offenders
[53:04.030 --> 53:07.030]  because of the comments section in the comments.
[53:07.150 --> 53:10.150]  He was able to jump all the comments.
[53:10.150 --> 53:12.150]  He didn't rat them out.
[53:12.150 --> 53:16.150]  He was able to really know who was the offenders.
[53:16.150 --> 53:20.150]  But he didn't have enough statistical information, as he said,
[53:20.150 --> 53:23.150]  to really blow a whistle on anybody.
[53:23.150 --> 53:25.150]  Give it time.
[53:25.150 --> 53:27.150]  Give it time.
[53:27.150 --> 53:31.150]  He said if the state would release the name of all the labs that were
[53:31.150 --> 53:35.150]  involved, he would be able to figure it out based on the comment section.
[53:35.270 --> 53:38.270]  But the labs' names were anonymous.
[53:38.270 --> 53:40.270]  They were just coded.
[53:40.270 --> 53:43.270]  Is there something going on in your guy's area?
[53:43.270 --> 53:48.270]  Yeah, he's a postdoctoral statistical doctor.
[53:48.270 --> 53:53.270]  He was looking at all the lab statistics that the state offered up to him
[53:53.270 --> 54:03.270]  to pretty much show that there was a certain lab that was being dishonest.
[54:03.390 --> 54:08.390]  The results that they reported in the end,
[54:08.390 --> 54:15.390]  they reported like if they were outside of those parameters
[54:15.390 --> 54:21.390]  for those ideal numbers, there was zero interest.
[54:21.390 --> 54:24.390]  Pretty much the pie charts, they dropped off.
[54:24.390 --> 54:27.390]  I'm explaining it very poorly, unfortunately.
[54:27.390 --> 54:30.390]  Yeah, I can't wait for that whole lab testing.
[54:30.510 --> 54:33.510]  He showed with the numbers that you can't possibly get that number
[54:33.510 --> 54:36.510]  from your initial starting point.
[54:36.510 --> 54:41.510]  I forgot how he explained it, but he was very insightful.
[54:41.510 --> 54:43.510]  He knows.
[54:43.510 --> 54:45.510]  He didn't put it on the producer.
[54:45.510 --> 54:49.510]  It was more or less coercion between labs and retailers.
[54:49.510 --> 54:51.510]  It's not on the farmer.
[54:51.510 --> 54:55.510]  The lab giving back the highest numbers is the lab that's going
[54:55.510 --> 54:58.510]  to get the most clients, right?
[54:58.630 --> 55:01.630]  The other thing that you hadn't had a chance to watch yet
[55:01.630 --> 55:03.630]  was Dr. Google's speech.
[55:03.630 --> 55:05.630]  She's a neuroscientist.
[55:05.630 --> 55:12.630]  She was talking about increased white matter activity in the brain
[55:12.630 --> 55:18.630]  on late-onset users compared to early-onset users and non-users.
[55:18.630 --> 55:24.630]  Then she also runs these clinical trials, I guess,
[55:24.750 --> 55:31.750]  with patients who opt in to use really low-QHD cannabis products
[55:31.750 --> 55:35.750]  like people who haven't used cannabis before
[55:35.750 --> 55:39.750]  or people who use cannabis and add this to their regimen.
[55:39.750 --> 55:43.750]  When you were talking about your mom kind of coming around,
[55:43.750 --> 55:46.750]  I was like, oh, man, he should really watch that
[55:46.750 --> 55:51.750]  because my mom was raised very strict Roman Catholic.
[55:51.870 --> 55:54.870]  She has a brain injury, too.
[55:54.870 --> 55:57.870]  She's always been opposed to cannabis.
[55:57.870 --> 56:02.870]  She's kind of come around and started to accept what I do
[56:02.870 --> 56:07.870]  as medicine, but it's hard for her to use for herself.
[56:07.870 --> 56:11.870]  She's been coming around more and more to using CBD.
[56:11.870 --> 56:15.870]  I had a chance to sit there for an hour and watch Dr. Gruber's talk.
[56:15.870 --> 56:18.870]  It was really helpful for her to kind of...
[56:18.990 --> 56:21.990]  Yeah, please pass that link along.
[56:21.990 --> 56:22.990]  I'd love to check that out.
[56:22.990 --> 56:25.990]  The evidence really shows that the protecting of the brain
[56:25.990 --> 56:29.990]  and even neurogenesis and the stopping of all these plaques
[56:29.990 --> 56:34.990]  and the white matter and that if you're...
[56:34.990 --> 56:37.990]  If not as long as...
[56:37.990 --> 56:42.990]  The young developing brain, it's a whole other story.
[56:42.990 --> 56:45.990]  After you get to adulthood, it's actually the margin
[56:46.110 --> 56:48.110]  and she shows all this.
[56:48.110 --> 56:52.110]  Her studies are really a positive thing for us
[56:52.110 --> 56:54.110]  in this medicine.
[56:54.110 --> 56:57.110]  It really shows all these wonderful...
[56:57.110 --> 57:02.110]  I mean, her studies have proven that after a certain age,
[57:02.110 --> 57:04.110]  it's not necessarily...
[57:04.110 --> 57:05.110]  It's no detriment.
[57:05.110 --> 57:08.110]  It's actually on the contrary.
[57:08.110 --> 57:09.110]  Right.
[57:09.110 --> 57:10.110]  Nice, nice.
[57:10.110 --> 57:11.110]  It's good.
[57:11.110 --> 57:12.110]  Yeah.
[57:12.110 --> 57:13.110]  High THC.
[57:13.110 --> 57:14.110]  That's, yeah, this whole...
[57:14.230 --> 57:17.230]  We actually had one company out here in California
[57:17.230 --> 57:21.230]  post a COA with 42%.
[57:21.230 --> 57:24.230]  Not total, THC.
[57:24.230 --> 57:26.230]  That's dubious.
[57:26.230 --> 57:30.230]  I think the total was like 50 or 52.
[57:30.230 --> 57:31.230]  Oh, man.
[57:31.230 --> 57:34.230]  It was like everyone just kind of laughed at it.
[57:34.230 --> 57:35.230]  I'd love to see that.
[57:35.230 --> 57:36.230]  It was like, yeah, okay.
[57:36.230 --> 57:37.230]  Just...
[57:37.230 --> 57:40.230]  I do graphic design sometimes for people
[57:40.230 --> 57:43.230]  and I'll make labels and I'll ask them for percentages
[57:43.350 --> 57:46.350]  and they'll make them completely up on the spot.
[57:46.350 --> 57:48.350]  You know what I mean?
[57:48.350 --> 57:49.350]  And it's just like...
[57:49.350 --> 57:50.350]  I'm like, are you serious?
[57:50.350 --> 57:52.350]  He's like, oh, well, you take it to the lab.
[57:52.350 --> 57:55.350]  They're going to do the same thing with a lot of this stuff.
[57:55.350 --> 57:58.350]  And so I think the faith in the lab testing
[57:58.350 --> 58:00.350]  is dwindling greatly.
[58:00.350 --> 58:03.350]  And then you have people that just solely rely on it.
[58:03.350 --> 58:04.350]  So there's no type of regulation
[58:04.350 --> 58:07.350]  and you're able to have these fluctuations like that.
[58:07.350 --> 58:08.350]  And then not only that,
[58:08.350 --> 58:09.350]  you have from state to state,
[58:09.350 --> 58:11.350]  pathogen levels are different.
[58:11.350 --> 58:12.350]  You know what I mean?
[58:12.470 --> 58:14.470]  So whatever's susceptible here isn't susceptible there.
[58:14.470 --> 58:15.470]  And then if you want to do a whole article...
[58:15.470 --> 58:16.470]  Well, they don't know what they're looking for.
[58:16.470 --> 58:17.470]  That's the problem.
[58:17.470 --> 58:18.470]  That's part of the problem.
[58:18.470 --> 58:19.470]  You know what I mean?
[58:19.470 --> 58:22.470]  Like a lot of these synthetic companies sometimes...
[58:22.470 --> 58:26.470]  Well, and even then, if you take it out of the laboratory
[58:26.470 --> 58:28.470]  and just some of these write-ups,
[58:28.470 --> 58:31.470]  like on the websites that you see nowadays,
[58:31.470 --> 58:35.470]  I can't even name some of them because I'm spacing right now,
[58:35.470 --> 58:39.470]  but it's a euphoric, soaring high and blah, blah, blah.
[58:39.470 --> 58:41.470]  And it's like, you can't say that.
[58:41.590 --> 58:44.590]  Like everyone's endocannabinoid system is different.
[58:44.590 --> 58:48.590]  You know, what might give you a euphoria
[58:48.590 --> 58:50.590]  might give me full-on anxiety.
[58:51.590 --> 58:53.590]  So those whole descriptive words
[58:53.590 --> 58:55.590]  that lead you in a direction,
[58:55.590 --> 58:57.590]  that needs to stop too as well.
[58:57.590 --> 58:59.590]  It's like, just go out there and experience it.
[58:59.590 --> 59:00.590]  Try something new.
[59:00.590 --> 59:02.590]  Hey, did you like that one?
[59:02.590 --> 59:03.590]  Did that work for your system?
[59:03.590 --> 59:05.590]  Did it give you the desired effect?
[59:05.590 --> 59:07.590]  Okay, well stick with that one.
[59:07.590 --> 59:09.590]  And he talks about the terpenes.
[59:09.590 --> 59:10.590]  Yeah, exactly.
[59:10.710 --> 59:12.710]  It's not even on the tests.
[59:12.710 --> 59:15.710]  They don't want to pay for it to have it on the test.
[59:15.710 --> 59:18.710]  And we know that that's half of the whole synergy
[59:18.710 --> 59:21.710]  with the entourage and whole part of the medicine.
[59:21.710 --> 59:22.710]  Absolutely.
[59:22.710 --> 59:25.710]  And that probably has more to do than the chemo bar itself.
[59:25.710 --> 59:27.710]  The terpenes are going to really tell you,
[59:27.710 --> 59:29.710]  is probably going to be what brings you
[59:29.710 --> 59:30.710]  towards more of your own medicine.
[59:30.710 --> 59:32.710]  Once you figure out what that is.
[59:32.710 --> 59:35.710]  Exactly, because THC without any terpenes,
[59:35.710 --> 59:37.710]  that's a pure anxiety attack.
[59:37.710 --> 59:38.710]  Yes.
[59:38.830 --> 59:40.830]  It's just straight anxiety.
[59:40.830 --> 59:41.830]  At least for me.
[59:41.830 --> 59:42.830]  It's fucking terrible, dude.
[59:42.830 --> 59:43.830]  It's terrible.
[59:43.830 --> 59:46.830]  Yeah, I smoked some THC solventless,
[59:46.830 --> 59:48.830]  not solvent, solvent rocks.
[59:48.830 --> 59:50.830]  With no terpenes.
[59:50.830 --> 59:52.830]  Never do it again.
[59:52.830 --> 59:56.830]  It's like tequila, but it's fucking just straight anxiety.
[59:56.830 --> 59:59.830]  Like your fucking heart just starts racing.
[59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.830]  Yeah, like that's not what I'm looking for
[01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.830]  when I consume cannabis.
[01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:04.830]  You know?
[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.830]  Sometimes I like it, but not...
[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.950]  Maybe like right before you got in a fight
[01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:10.950]  with 12 people or something.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.950]  But other than that, it's not really good for me.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.950]  Not right before I walk into a grocery store.
[01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.950]  Yeah, no.
[01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.950]  No, that's high school high.
[01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.950]  Messaging Chef here in the background.
[01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:26.950]  He's trying to get back in,
[01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:29.950]  but for some reason the device doesn't want to connect for him.
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.950]  So try the reboot.
[01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:34.950]  Try, you know, make sure you're on the right...
[01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.950]  Browser, Google Chrome is kind of what StreamYard likes to use.
[01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:42.950]  If someone didn't have an issue during the show,
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.950]  it would be a sign of bad luck.
[01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.950]  Like I don't think it's ever not happened.
[01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.950]  If it did, that's the bad day.
[01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:50.950]  Right.
[01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:51.950]  See, there we go.
[01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:52.950]  Boo-yah.
[01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.950]  All right.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:54.950]  Back in the house.
[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:56.950]  I'm going to kick your other one from the studio.
[01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:57.950]  So hopefully it doesn't kick you both.
[01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:58.950]  Nope. Okay, good.
[01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:59.950]  Back at it.
[01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:00.950]  Sorry, guys.
[01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:01.950]  I went deep.
[01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.950]  Sorry about that.
[01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:07.070]  I went deep into the interweb space of my emails
[01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.070]  to dig up that link for that talk
[01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.070]  that Dr. Stacey Gruber did at Harvard.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:18.070]  So that's in the chat.
[01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.070]  I don't know if everybody can see that.
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.070]  Oh, cool.
[01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:26.070]  Yeah, and I can email these to you as well, Jimmy.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:30.070]  I'm just going to post this up into the chat
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.070]  for everybody on YouTube chat.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.190]  But yeah, no, those are definitely well worth the watch.
[01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.190]  I watched the first one this afternoon.
[01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:40.190]  Yeah, boy, I could talk with that guy for a while.
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.190]  So hopefully I get ahold of him.
[01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:44.190]  You saw his tie-dye pants, right?
[01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:45.190]  Yes, I did.
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:46.190]  Saw the tie-dye pants.
[01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.190]  And then John's like, no, you're in big trouble.
[01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:50.190]  Yeah.
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.190]  But let's-
[01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.190]  He's your hobby.
[01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.190]  Yep.
[01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.190]  Real quick, why we still have him here?
[01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:58.190]  Because, you know, Jimmy's with us tonight.
[01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.190]  He is sick with the flu.
[01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:03.310]  So I didn't want to keep him more than an hour.
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.310]  We're sitting here on an hour right now.
[01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:07.310]  And I'm still smoking joints.
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.310]  I can't help myself.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.310]  I get around a bunch of potheads.
[01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.310]  I know I shouldn't be smoking right now, but I just can't help myself.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.310]  It'll help, for sure.
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:19.310]  I want to get any questions we have or just like things
[01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.310]  that we're looking for out of the way real quick.
[01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:26.310]  So, you know, if you need to bounce, you can bounce at any point.
[01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.310]  Oh, I'm trying to highlight myself here.
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.430]  So you can bounce at any point.
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:33.430]  One of my questions that I had is, you know,
[01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:38.430]  what kind of flowering time should we kind of expect or prepare for?
[01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:41.430]  Because like a lot of these other guys, I'm going to be top dressing.
[01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:45.430]  So we know top dressing isn't immediately available.
[01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:49.430]  So what kind of flowering time or just window should I look for?
[01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.430]  It's your standard eight to nine weeks.
[01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:52.430]  Perfect.
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:56.430]  This group in particular, I don't know because I haven't ran them.
[01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:00.550]  There are things that I run in the valley,
[01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.550]  in the Salinas Valley that I test in there.
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:06.550]  I swear some of these are done in 54 days.
[01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.550]  Nice.
[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:10.550]  That's a winner in my tent.
[01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.550]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.550]  You know, I enjoy a nine week or two.
[01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:18.550]  You know, anything Chem D, Sour D, that's going to be, you know, 10 weeker.
[01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:21.550]  So I really, again, I do them for me.
[01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:25.550]  So I have a Chem D cross, you know, in this Jimmy's Lemons line that's coming out.
[01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:27.670]  And I know that's going to be a long one.
[01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.670]  I mean, those, you know, the guys who mess with those ones,
[01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:31.670]  that's a labor of love.
[01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:34.670]  All of this is a labor of love.
[01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:37.670]  And, you know, to be honest, I mean, you know,
[01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:38.670]  I got to give it up to you guys.
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:40.670]  You know, I know what it takes, you know, to do this.
[01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.670]  You know, this takes your time.
[01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:42.670]  This takes your resources.
[01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:43.670]  This is not cheap.
[01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.670]  This is not free to do.
[01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:49.670]  So I just want to thank you all for dedicating your time,
[01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:53.670]  your money and your resources into making this happen, man.
[01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:54.670]  Dude, thank you.
[01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.790]  Thank you for making it a possibility for all of us.
[01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:59.790]  And thank you guys, the other guys up here too,
[01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.790]  for, you know, wanting to get involved.
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.790]  They're all, you know, I reached out to people that I respected.
[01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.790]  I've learned something from each and every one of these people on the screen.
[01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:13.790]  So I knew they would be a good group to have because, you know,
[01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:16.790]  multiple minds and again, it's a shared and collective experience.
[01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:17.790]  That's how we learn the most.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:21.790]  Because dude, unless I had a warehouse and I had 20 different rooms,
[01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.790]  I can't do everything I want to at one time.
[01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.910]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:29.910]  You know, again, you know, I'm honored, you know,
[01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:31.910]  that you all are taking the time to do this.
[01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.910]  I really, you know, from the bottom of my heart, I mean that.
[01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:34.910]  Thank you.
[01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:38.910]  Do you guys have any like any specific questions?
[01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:41.910]  I know Magpie is, when can we get them wet?
[01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:42.910]  Tonight, buddy.
[01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:43.910]  Tonight.
[01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:44.910]  We can get them wet tonight.
[01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:45.910]  You see this cop already fucking.
[01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.910]  Exactly.
[01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.030]  I had a question.
[01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:58.030]  Are we going to have a time limit or how long are we going to do like
[01:04:58.030 --> 01:04:59.030]  the badging for?
[01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:01.030]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:04.030]  Are we trying to not keep a certain schedule?
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.030]  No.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.030]  Hey, you know, again, this is your guys' schedule.
[01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:09.030]  You do what's best for you.
[01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.030]  You know, what fits into your schedule.
[01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:12.030]  I don't know.
[01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.030]  You know, I don't know the size, the scale that you have.
[01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:18.030]  I mean, literally sometimes I'll do little lollipops.
[01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:22.150]  You know, just just to see, I mean, straight to 12 and 12, you
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.150]  know, just end up with a little stick like, OK, cool.
[01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:25.150]  Yep.
[01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.150]  That's the terpene profile I was looking for.
[01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:29.150]  Let's take this up a scale now.
[01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:30.150]  Right.
[01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:31.150]  Get your clones.
[01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:32.150]  Yeah.
[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:33.150]  Get your clones.
[01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:35.150]  And let's let's see what this can do with some a few numbers.
[01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:39.150]  So, no, I mean, you guys, it's up to you entirely.
[01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:43.150]  I mean, you know, if you see and I can't predict how many
[01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:49.270]  you're going to see like a two to one stretch, you know, a
[01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:50.270]  little bit.
[01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:54.270]  I'm hoping we're not going to see that in this little group
[01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:55.270]  here.
[01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:59.270]  The you know, the lemon side of it should really drop that
[01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:00.270]  down.
[01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:04.270]  Not that the not that the motor grease was a big, stretchy
[01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:05.270]  plant.
[01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:07.270]  You know, it was still pretty compact.
[01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.270]  But yeah.
[01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:09.270]  OK.
[01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:10.390]  Well, that's good.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:13.390]  And yeah, because I mean, well, you know, we're just kind of
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.390]  doing this initial show.
[01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:17.390]  And, you know, as they say, veg is kind of unsexy.
[01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.390]  So we don't really have to meet for a while.
[01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.390]  Nobody nobody goes on Instagram for veg pic.
[01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:26.390]  Saying, yeah, actually, I do.
[01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.390]  I'm being come on.
[01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.390]  I eat fig newtons because fuck cookies.
[01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:34.390]  So take everything I say with a grain of salt.
[01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.510]  But I'm probably I'm probably going to have one more question.
[01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:40.510]  Are there any like most like I know what I was like.
[01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.510]  You kind of just want general information.
[01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.510]  But are there any particular things that like you are looking
[01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:49.510]  for out of this cross that like, hey, I like I want to kind of
[01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.510]  know a little bit of everything.
[01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:54.510]  But I'd really like to know these points just because I know
[01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.510]  certain people are looking for certain things.
[01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.510]  And I'm not going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, oh,
[01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:03.510]  I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, oh, I'm going
[01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.630]  to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, yeah.
[01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:08.630]  Yeah, like what can we report?
[01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.630]  How can we be a best asset to you?
[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.630]  Wow.
[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.630]  I mean, already just that, you know, you guys have different
[01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.630]  environment.
[01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:20.630]  You know, these you guys are all indoor, correct?
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:21.630]  Yeah.
[01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.630]  Different mediums.
[01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.630]  OK, I'm actually I'm going to be taking cuts and putting one
[01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:26.630]  outside too.
[01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:29.630]  So we're gonna be seeing some in recycled beds and inside.
[01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:32.630]  So my follow up question.
[01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:36.550]  You haven't finished. Sorry, I'll let you finish answering that but um
[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.510]  No outdoor testing
[01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:42.950]  You know, honestly magpie at the end of the day. I just don't want to see something herm
[01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:46.070]  Which I haven't had anything herm
[01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:52.150]  Um, that's just the whole thing. I mean and who knows, you know, like I say, you know, there's a flavor for everyone
[01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:57.110]  You know, you guys might not dig it shit. I might not dig it, you know, or maybe he's like, holy shit
[01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:59.110]  This is something I really enjoy here
[01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.630]  um
[01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:04.390]  You know if that lemon comes through i'm hoping it does a little bit again
[01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.570]  I selected so it wouldn't be so overwhelming
[01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.790]  So I really think the gas is going to kind of double up on this lemon grease
[01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:14.390]  You know, you're still going to get some phenos have a nice lemon tip to it
[01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:19.830]  And then you're going to get some of those gassy phenos that are going to have that chemd, you know funk to it
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:25.670]  uh again, I like the tech, you know, the chemd funk because something about that that terpene profile just
[01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.470]  I enjoy that high
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.630]  Really stuff with stuff with the chems
[01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:36.230]  Yeah, yeah chems have always been my favorite and again because they run for so long
[01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.070]  um
[01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:43.270]  I mean I have the chemd cut i've taken it to full term and it's it's like yeah, this this takes a minute
[01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:48.790]  I love spoken. Um, but yeah, yeah grown. Um's another labor of love
[01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:53.030]  Yeah, but chef you had a question on the outdoor
[01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:57.990]  Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to follow up on magpies because he pretty much touched on mine
[01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:03.430]  But uh, did you have you done any testing with the outdoor on any of this?
[01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:05.590]  uh
[01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:09.510]  Stuff you've been working with at all not on this lemon line. No, not at all
[01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:13.990]  I mean I do small I do small indoor testing on my own
[01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:18.630]  Like I said, there's about four or five in the lemon line that are that have already been tested indoor
[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:20.790]  I want to see what they're going to do in greenhouse
[01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.870]  And then I want to see what they're going to do in outdoor
[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:26.150]  This uh next year's coming up outdoor
[01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:32.630]  I'm, hoping that I can take some of these and put them in and see what they do for outdoor because primarily a lot of
[01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.350]  a lot of what
[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:39.350]  Testing that I have had done is indoor and mixed lighting greenhouse
[01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:46.070]  Okay, so especially those pineapple ties. I know those pineapple ties that got hit with the lemon
[01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:48.950]  Those ones are going to be great outdoors. Do you make your
[01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:53.350]  I'm sorry. Do you make your beans inside or outside inside? Okay
[01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:59.910]  I did a small little run this year of just like four of four. I had sour kosher. I had a
[01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:03.510]  Rabbit hippies kushmints
[01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.910]  This motor grease
[01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:15.110]  This was an outdoor run a short a short late season outdoor run. I took that uh that number 14 jimmy's lemons
[01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:18.250]  Stuck it out there with the sour kosher cut from aaron at dna
[01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:25.270]  And then the the pineapple I did two pineapple ties that I really liked one of them had a
[01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:30.310]  The the the terpene profile was just there was something just a little different
[01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:34.550]  And so I kept you know, I threw those two out there just to see what you know
[01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.790]  Because I wanted to get both I wasn't quite sure
[01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.190]  At the end of it all
[01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:41.670]  The the the pineapple ties were a little bit different
[01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:43.830]  At the end of it all
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:48.550]  The the the pineapple ties that i'm going to release with the that were hit with the jimmy's lemons
[01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:51.030]  Is going to be the most uh
[01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:54.330]  I mean when it's pine and it says it's pineapple. It's pineapple
[01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:57.350]  I'm, really excited to see those ones run outside
[01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:02.950]  So if you guys got any resources of doing outdoor i'd love to send you guys some pineapple tie and see what they do
[01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:05.270]  Hell yeah, bro
[01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:08.070]  I've already got a cup waiting
[01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:12.870]  That's what you'll come to realize about me I have an issue like
[01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:22.390]  Step one is recognition brother step one is recognition. Yeah, it's not a problem. I'm fine. That's okay
[01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:24.150]  That's okay
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:26.870]  This is a support group. It's gonna turn into a support group
[01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:31.350]  That's what I always say and then I end up popping more seats every time
[01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.470]  I sent I sent chat a message the other day
[01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.750]  I got I bought some a christmas present for one of my homies and I didn't even know he was making his own beans
[01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:44.390]  And when he sent me my present back, he sent me a bunch of beans. I'm like you see chat. It's not me
[01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:47.670]  I don't have a problem. Everyone does it to me everyone
[01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:50.950]  Yeah
[01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:54.870]  The universe knows you're supposed to have a man. You're one of the people that's got to happen
[01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:59.030]  That's what I mean. It just happened. So I gotta go with it. You can't just deny that shit
[01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:06.230]  Yeah, I got a full-on mini fridge full of everyone else's seeds and i'm just like why I'm never gonna get to these
[01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.910]  Never but you have them though, but I have them
[01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:16.090]  Situations change situations change
[01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:23.510]  Tomorrow oh you got all the beanstalk your gravy. Yeah
[01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.110]  Gravy
[01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.590]  No, but like when people order beans for me like, you know
[01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:30.550]  I'll just throw in a random pack because it's like, you know
[01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:33.270]  I love all my friends who share their beans with me
[01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:38.790]  But it's like i'm never gonna get to a man and if I can get your beans into someone else's hands that's gonna grow them
[01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:44.470]  Yeah, that's what you're looking for. You know, yeah, it gets to a point where you have to have like a thousand acres
[01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.310]  Yeah
[01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:47.350]  Yeah
[01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:51.670]  But I do like that though get him to get him to grow i've got you know, some friends, um, you know
[01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:56.070]  Shout out kazoo. Kush. He's a dude in michigan. He's not really like selling them on the market
[01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.030]  He's a guy who just kind of gets them out to people because they need them
[01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:02.550]  Uh, so he always sends me a whole bunch of things and i'm like, oh dude
[01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:04.470]  I'd love to get to these right now
[01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:08.550]  But I can't do you mind if I you know, give them out to some other people and he's like, yeah, absolutely
[01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.950]  They were meant to be grown. So yeah. Yeah
[01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.830]  That's the thing
[01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:19.510]  I got beans for spring just a little straw full of seeds from kazoo. He's like, hey, man, just go throw them wherever
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:24.550]  Pretty much there you go on the ground man. I was like, yeah, dude, I got you
