[00:13.240 --> 00:20.160]  Welcome everybody to another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show. I'm Chad Westport
[00:20.160 --> 00:24.760]  and I am joined today by Professor DeBacco. How are you doing today?
[00:24.760 --> 00:26.560]  Doing well. Thanks for having me.
[00:26.560 --> 00:32.240]  Oh, absolutely. My pleasure. You're a person who, you've got a lot of YouTube material
[00:32.240 --> 00:35.800]  up. We'll get to some of that stuff later because I want to show it, make sure everybody
[00:35.800 --> 00:40.600]  knows where it's at. But I've been watching your videos for a while and I've really enjoyed
[00:40.600 --> 00:46.020]  your approach. I enjoy your content and I was stoked to get you here. I didn't know
[00:46.020 --> 00:53.000]  you actually came outside of the channel. That is your channel. So thank you for making
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  the time.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.480]  Thank you Ben for having me. I do it live on the spot too, not just pre-recorded, edited
[00:57.480 --> 01:02.720]  and all set. But yeah, I'm looking forward to the conversation here.
[01:02.720 --> 01:08.440]  Yeah, thank you. And yes, this is absolutely live. Everybody in chat, thank you for being
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.540]  here. We already have got one comment here who wants to know about giant pumpkins. So
[01:13.540 --> 01:18.360]  maybe that's just our segue into what we're going to talk about today. We're going to
[01:18.360 --> 01:24.400]  talk about gardening. We're going to talk about some of the principles behind what we're
[01:24.400 --> 01:30.880]  doing. I always say you got to build a solid foundation. Without a solid foundation, a
[01:30.880 --> 01:37.340]  lot of things just, you don't connect the dots. And a lot of the topics sometimes we
[01:37.340 --> 01:43.780]  talk on this channel, sometimes we skip over that. We're off because we're so enchanted
[01:43.780 --> 01:49.500]  with something, a shiny new something, but we forget the basic principles that make it
[01:49.500 --> 01:54.500]  all work. So we're going to cover some of that stuff today and just kind of circling
[01:54.500 --> 01:59.340]  back to gardening. How long have you been gardening for? Has that been a passion of
[01:59.340 --> 02:00.340]  yours for a while?
[02:00.340 --> 02:05.460]  Yeah, I started way back in high school. If you really look that far and get to the first
[02:05.460 --> 02:10.220]  thing, giant pumpkins is really how I got started way, way back when. Because we can
[02:10.220 --> 02:16.400]  kind of watch something grow or go down to the county fairs, always amazed by the immensity
[02:16.400 --> 02:22.100]  or the size just of pumpkins. And when you're trying to grow something giant, you're really
[02:22.100 --> 02:26.660]  trying to grow, you're trying to maximize the plant efficiency, which is kind of what
[02:26.660 --> 02:31.900]  gardeners just in general are really out to kind of, there's a really end goal is the
[02:31.900 --> 02:36.700]  bigger, better kind of concepts there, or just more, you know, it can get just total
[02:36.700 --> 02:41.340]  yield. So giant pumpkins can push it to the limits there. And sometimes you push a little
[02:41.340 --> 02:47.420]  too far and they will pop, they will explode. So that delicate balance where more isn't
[02:47.420 --> 02:52.900]  always better. It's developing that idea where that balance lies and kind of hitting the
[02:52.900 --> 02:58.300]  peak efficiency, but not really overdoing it because there's negative repercussions
[02:58.300 --> 02:59.580]  on that end as well.
[02:59.820 --> 03:06.860]  Yeah, I've seen researching PGRs, there's famous videos of watermelons exploding over
[03:06.860 --> 03:13.540]  in China fields because too many PGRs. But pumpkins are fascinating because they can
[03:13.540 --> 03:17.660]  put on, I mean, they sometimes put on what, over a pound a day?
[03:18.180 --> 03:23.780]  I modify that and say when a peak season, which is probably in about a couple weeks,
[03:23.820 --> 03:28.180]  you know, we're kind of getting the max amount of heat and day length. Mine will put on around
[03:28.180 --> 03:35.060]  a pound, not a day, a pound an hour on average. 24 plus pounds a day is not unheard of.
[03:35.100 --> 03:39.740]  Sometimes during really peak growth, which is your planted tighter line now, they can
[03:39.780 --> 03:42.780]  almost do two pounds an hour, almost.
[03:43.300 --> 03:44.300]  Holy cow.
[03:44.740 --> 03:48.500]  They drink a lot of water and they just, they get that plant ready. You know, we talk
[03:48.500 --> 03:51.620]  about cannabis in the veg stage, you know, and that's the same thing with pumpkin
[03:51.620 --> 03:55.420]  growing. You want to have a large engine, you want to have a lot of leaves as solar
[03:55.420 --> 03:59.060]  collectors for the energy. You want to have a lot of roots to absorb that water. You want
[03:59.060 --> 04:02.820]  to feed them the nutrients that they need to kind of like make all that work, but not
[04:03.100 --> 04:04.500]  overfeed with one nutrient.
[04:05.020 --> 04:07.020]  Pumpkins need a lot of potassium, for example.
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.620]  That's why they're so healthy to eat as an end crop, you know, your squashes in general.
[04:10.900 --> 04:15.300]  But that potassium, if you override that potassium, you'll start to block your calcium
[04:15.300 --> 04:18.540]  and that will cause all sorts of other issues with if you've grown tomatoes like
[04:18.540 --> 04:20.180]  blossom end rot, something very obvious.
[04:20.540 --> 04:25.460]  But you can get to where there's a thickened kind of or a thickened stem end, but then a
[04:25.460 --> 04:27.700]  thinner blossom end of a pumpkin.
[04:27.700 --> 04:30.020]  And that's typically where they can fail.
[04:30.020 --> 04:34.460]  So it's again, that's hard to get into knowing where that balance lies, not pushing too
[04:34.460 --> 04:37.300]  high of one because that's going to offset something else.
[04:37.580 --> 04:43.420]  Yeah, balance and balance seems important in almost anything we grow and in the soil.
[04:43.740 --> 04:49.180]  And geez, a pound or two an hour is amazing because I'd imagine that really lets you see
[04:49.180 --> 04:52.300]  what's working and what's not almost on an instant time frame.
[04:52.700 --> 04:57.260]  I think go to work, you come back eight, 10 hours later and the pumpkin is noticeably
[04:57.260 --> 05:01.820]  larger. And you as a grower, you know, some things you grow tomatoes and they just they
[05:01.820 --> 05:03.060]  just don't change as quick.
[05:03.060 --> 05:07.460]  So that can be good and that can be also to the negative end of things.
[05:07.460 --> 05:10.860]  But a lot of the same growing practices, believe it or not, for giant pumpkins relate
[05:10.860 --> 05:12.180]  directly to cannabis.
[05:12.300 --> 05:15.780]  I always say cannabis is grown vertically and pumpkins are grown horizontally.
[05:15.780 --> 05:20.740]  And there's a lot of similarities between those crops, a lot of setting up now, of
[05:20.740 --> 05:23.300]  course, indoor versus outdoors, all of their issues there.
[05:23.300 --> 05:26.380]  But definitely a lot of growing a plant.
[05:26.620 --> 05:31.340]  There's a lot of commonalities and of course, some specialties for each crop, whether
[05:31.340 --> 05:36.300]  you're growing chrysanthemums or berry crops or cannabis.
[05:36.300 --> 05:38.060]  There's a lot of slight differences.
[05:38.300 --> 05:42.820]  But then you go through and you really have that true appreciation when you can see and
[05:42.820 --> 05:45.340]  make these links to different consistencies.
[05:45.340 --> 05:46.780]  I'm also an extension agent.
[05:47.380 --> 05:49.380]  So I go around the state and I'm seeing farmers.
[05:49.380 --> 05:51.380]  I call it the plant vet.
[05:51.660 --> 05:53.380]  So I'm the veterinarian for plants.
[05:53.540 --> 05:57.540]  I go out and I'm looking at lettuce problems and then they take another go to another
[05:57.540 --> 06:00.140]  field and they got their squash and then their tomatoes.
[06:00.140 --> 06:03.620]  And then you might have some hemp fields that I go through and inspect as well.
[06:03.620 --> 06:04.780]  And they got these insect issues.
[06:04.780 --> 06:09.940]  So tying all that together and seeing how the weather influences it, plant development
[06:09.940 --> 06:12.460]  influences it and really how it all comes together.
[06:13.420 --> 06:15.300]  That's a very large benefit.
[06:15.300 --> 06:19.700]  Again, the cannabis plant in particular, it's not very fast growing.
[06:19.700 --> 06:23.980]  We only get so many chances per year to learn from it.
[06:24.460 --> 06:30.300]  That pumpkin, you know, again, instant gratification on that end, but also your ability
[06:30.300 --> 06:33.780]  to go out and see multiple fields, talk to multiple farmers.
[06:33.940 --> 06:35.620]  There's a lot of similarities.
[06:35.620 --> 06:38.940]  There's a lot of truths when it comes to gardening.
[06:39.060 --> 06:41.060]  But then there's also a lot of interpretation.
[06:41.060 --> 06:45.700]  So I bet it's been fun to see some of those and maybe play around with them yourself.
[06:46.220 --> 06:49.980]  And as you'll see on the channel, I go through and do and kind of what has been lacking in
[06:49.980 --> 06:52.740]  cannabis right now is really that true scientific research.
[06:52.740 --> 06:56.980]  You know, we can have a lot of theories or ideas and really to have that kind of backed
[06:56.980 --> 06:59.060]  up by some sort of supported science.
[06:59.060 --> 07:04.380]  And luckily now we're getting more and more actual research being published on cannabis
[07:04.380 --> 07:10.900]  specifically. We've had to do a lot of looking at an analog like tomato, for example, for
[07:10.900 --> 07:15.340]  growth habit or chrysanthemums being used quite a lot for lighting.
[07:15.620 --> 07:19.140]  They have a very similar photoreceptors as other cannabis plants.
[07:19.180 --> 07:23.220]  We've done a lot of research on that that relate to cannabis, but now hopefully able to
[07:23.220 --> 07:26.540]  do more research. And I'm seeing more of that being published, which is wonderful,
[07:26.540 --> 07:32.460]  specifically on cannabis, which again, just broadens the horizons in general for plant
[07:32.460 --> 07:34.380]  science. Absolutely.
[07:34.380 --> 07:38.220]  It'll be interesting to see where it diversifies from these plants that we have been, you
[07:38.260 --> 07:42.180]  know, Aerodopsis that we have been comparing it to this entire time.
[07:43.020 --> 07:47.100]  But the chrysanthemums, that's an interesting little bell went off in my head.
[07:47.100 --> 07:48.340]  People take note.
[07:48.780 --> 07:50.300]  Lighting research there, right there.
[07:50.300 --> 07:57.060]  So we were kind of talking pre-show about how I have done some sustainable ag training.
[07:57.060 --> 08:00.980]  And, you know, one of the reasons I said I'm like, because this industry figured it all
[08:00.980 --> 08:02.700]  out a long time ago.
[08:03.100 --> 08:07.540]  So using some of those other plants are beneficial.
[08:07.540 --> 08:12.260]  And actually, one of the questions that we're going to come to today is how to do some
[08:12.260 --> 08:18.260]  proper research. That was something, you know, I specifically had wanted you to maybe
[08:18.620 --> 08:21.980]  share with the viewers. And there's actually quite a few questions that I gave you and
[08:21.980 --> 08:25.060]  you've prepared kind of a nice presentation for us.
[08:25.780 --> 08:31.580]  But the science base, so, you know, I appreciate the science based approach to do kind
[08:31.580 --> 08:34.380]  of cannabis and just gardening in general.
[08:34.740 --> 08:39.900]  Why do you kind of feel that that's has been important or is a good route to to pursue
[08:39.900 --> 08:41.060]  instead of just winging it?
[08:42.300 --> 08:48.140]  The science based approach really is how we're going to general populace, you know, grow
[08:48.140 --> 08:53.660]  the plant in the way that, you know, actually does create benefits and actually will help
[08:53.700 --> 08:57.860]  hopefully reduce the chance for any sort of environmental contamination.
[08:57.860 --> 09:02.260]  You know, and this is one thing that I try to go out with the extension and kind of go
[09:02.260 --> 09:07.940]  out and see farmers growing on relatively large scales, you know, that could be under
[09:07.940 --> 09:11.860]  under glass, under, you know, greenhouse environments that could be outdoors in fields or
[09:12.100 --> 09:15.740]  smaller, you know, grow rooms where they're under artificial lights.
[09:15.980 --> 09:18.060]  But just one example is like phosphorus.
[09:18.580 --> 09:20.900]  Phosphorus is a freshwater contaminant.
[09:20.900 --> 09:25.140]  And we hear a lot of bloom fertilizers and flower fertilizers that are really high with
[09:25.140 --> 09:27.180]  that middle number, really high in phosphorus.
[09:27.540 --> 09:32.180]  And the downfall to that is unlike a nitrogen, if you overfeed with nitrogen, you get really
[09:32.180 --> 09:35.540]  bloated plants and they get brittle and they don't root very well.
[09:35.540 --> 09:38.340]  And they give you visual signs like you messed up, you over added.
[09:39.700 --> 09:41.020]  Phosphorus isn't that case.
[09:41.060 --> 09:45.860]  You can feed the right amount or excessive amounts and really aren't going to see much
[09:45.860 --> 09:47.140]  change in the plant.
[09:47.140 --> 09:52.820]  So I think a lot of growers unintentionally are over adding phosphorus and potentially
[09:52.820 --> 09:54.860]  contaminating local groundwater.
[09:55.180 --> 09:58.420]  And it's something phosphorus is something we're running out of, believe it or not.
[09:58.580 --> 10:00.420]  A lot of it's mined in the United States.
[10:00.420 --> 10:01.540]  A lot of it comes out of Florida.
[10:02.060 --> 10:06.180]  And we're importing a lot more phosphorus because as we're getting deeper into those
[10:06.180 --> 10:09.300]  mines, there's greater amounts of impurities.
[10:09.980 --> 10:14.900]  So that requires more time, more money to refine that, to take out those impurities so
[10:14.900 --> 10:17.700]  they can still have the pure phosphorus to get added fertilizer.
[10:17.700 --> 10:22.820]  So when you're over adding something that is becoming a scarcer and scarcer resource
[10:23.100 --> 10:25.940]  that also when over added can cause environmental issues.
[10:26.340 --> 10:29.540]  That's something that definitely was all directed, of course, by science.
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.500]  And that's just one example of how we really need to approach this.
[10:33.500 --> 10:36.620]  Starting out, this is great to see it continue to grow.
[10:36.820 --> 10:41.060]  But we've got that kind of that reset, that kind of chance to start at the beginning and
[10:41.220 --> 10:46.420]  a really great way to hopefully continue this going forward in a sustainable way so that
[10:46.420 --> 10:52.180]  we can produce a quality plant from the end product, but also during the plant production
[10:52.180 --> 10:56.580]  phase. So we're not doing or kind of righting the wrongs of any potential previous
[10:56.580 --> 10:58.460]  industry from an environmental standpoint.
[10:59.540 --> 11:03.620]  It'll be interesting to see how far we we take that in practice.
[11:03.660 --> 11:07.140]  I know it's a kind of like on the consciousness of a lot of people.
[11:07.140 --> 11:13.380]  I do see a lot of small scale cannabis farms switching to more regenerative practices.
[11:16.100 --> 11:18.980]  But it's not as easy to scale.
[11:19.180 --> 11:21.220]  So, yeah, it's not as easy to scale.
[11:21.220 --> 11:27.300]  It can be done, but I won't go down that road because, you know, organically, if you're
[11:27.300 --> 11:30.380]  organically treating a thousand acres and then you get a bug, what do you do?
[11:30.940 --> 11:33.700]  So, yeah, there's pluses and minuses to everything.
[11:33.700 --> 11:36.500]  And I'm glad we're kind of kind of talk about everything today, too.
[11:36.500 --> 11:40.740]  I know one of the subjects we're going to talk about or I was asking is, you know, maybe
[11:40.740 --> 11:49.380]  some of the misconceptions of organic versus non-organic methods, because, again, the
[11:49.380 --> 11:54.580]  Future Cannabis Project, we have a lot of living soil, organic based, regenerative based
[11:54.580 --> 11:56.500]  gardeners here. Great.
[11:56.500 --> 11:57.860]  I support it. Absolutely.
[11:57.860 --> 12:03.620]  A little hard to pull off my two gallon pot in here, but learning those principles are
[12:03.620 --> 12:06.500]  very good to know because they can be applied elsewhere.
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.860]  I apply them outside myself.
[12:07.860 --> 12:11.380]  But that stream of thought starts somewhere, at least.
[12:11.380 --> 12:11.860]  Right.
[12:12.740 --> 12:17.220]  And that's the key part is just kind of approaching it as that way that is sustainable.
[12:17.220 --> 12:20.900]  Or when new research comes about, something we might not be aware of that we're seeing
[12:20.900 --> 12:24.260]  that we can then apply and then apply it to our own lives.
[12:24.500 --> 12:29.060]  We might not be aware of that we're seeing that we can then apply and really just help
[12:29.060 --> 12:33.540]  overall, you know, the whole plant production end of things, whether you're indoor, outdoor,
[12:33.540 --> 12:36.820]  auto flower, photo grower, it all kind of interrelates.
[12:37.700 --> 12:38.340]  Cool.
[12:38.340 --> 12:44.260]  Well, let me I could go ahead and pop in the slides here that we have if you're ready for
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.860]  that and kind of what we start off with one of the we'll go for one of the the meteor
[12:49.860 --> 12:50.260]  questions.
[12:50.260 --> 12:55.780]  I know we've got some of the the back end stuff, a lot of the foundations that are so
[12:55.780 --> 12:57.780]  important for me to cover.
[12:57.780 --> 13:04.660]  Again, I truly believe in educating to get everybody the knowledge and skill set to get
[13:04.660 --> 13:05.940]  started to grow.
[13:06.820 --> 13:11.860]  I view cannabis as a medicine and I want everybody to have that ability.
[13:11.860 --> 13:14.180]  So that's why I want to cover some of those things.
[13:15.060 --> 13:17.940]  And I appreciate you again making this this presentation.
[13:18.260 --> 13:25.380]  We are going to kind of start, though, with a topic that is talked about because there's
[13:25.380 --> 13:29.780]  a variety of things to say, a variety of answers, variety of more questions.
[13:29.780 --> 13:35.460]  But why don't I just turn it over to you and I'll let you roll through it here for a while.
[13:35.460 --> 13:39.860]  Well, feel free to kind of come through, interrupt or fill in any questions you may have.
[13:39.860 --> 13:40.820]  You might see in chats.
[13:40.820 --> 13:43.460]  I kind of try to look over to keep on tabs on some of them there.
[13:43.780 --> 13:49.700]  But one of the main questions that I get, you know, we'll talk about here looking particularly
[13:49.700 --> 13:52.900]  at, you know, just why do my leaves or stems turn purple?
[13:52.900 --> 13:56.980]  And I know a lot of people will say the yellow colorations and that's a whole other set of
[13:56.980 --> 13:59.940]  deficiencies, which we'll talk about midway through here.
[13:59.940 --> 14:04.180]  But purple, why does this purple coloration have a lot of growers that panic when they
[14:04.180 --> 14:07.300]  see this kind of purple coloration to their plants?
[14:07.300 --> 14:13.460]  Now, purple we're seeing here on the left hand image is kind of that main center point,
[14:13.460 --> 14:17.700]  that growing point is turning purple, where the image kind of on the right has that purple
[14:17.700 --> 14:23.540]  in the center, but also those leaves also kind of exhibiting that fairly advanced purple
[14:23.540 --> 14:24.740]  coloration there.
[14:24.740 --> 14:28.420]  And when we're talking about purple coloration, a lot of times, and this is an outdoor grow,
[14:29.140 --> 14:32.260]  this is a lot of times a stress to the plant.
[14:32.260 --> 14:33.860]  So it could be too hot.
[14:33.860 --> 14:35.380]  It could be too cold.
[14:35.380 --> 14:42.980]  You know, we're really looking at the just a plant response to be able to protect itself.
[14:42.980 --> 14:46.740]  The purple colorations, as someone mentioned in chat, they're anthocyanins.
[14:46.740 --> 14:48.980]  That's basically the pigment that you're seeing.
[14:48.980 --> 14:54.260]  And that anthocyanin is a pigment there to help block the sunlight.
[14:54.260 --> 14:58.500]  It's a plant's way of it can't put up an umbrella, you know, at the beach and kind of shade itself.
[14:58.500 --> 15:01.780]  So it's this is kind of its way of doing that.
[15:01.780 --> 15:05.060]  But then I'll get growers that say, you know what, well, my stems are also turning purple.
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.420]  This is kind of that same grow.
[15:06.420 --> 15:10.180]  And this is kind of very evident here where you see I zoomed in on the left.
[15:10.180 --> 15:13.780]  So you can kind of see a little bit more broad based on the right there.
[15:13.780 --> 15:17.540]  But on the left there, you're seeing those two little cotyledon leaves.
[15:17.540 --> 15:18.900]  Those are your seed leaves.
[15:18.900 --> 15:23.780]  And right above that, the epicotyl and below that we call the hypocotyl from a botanical
[15:24.340 --> 15:25.220]  terminology.
[15:25.220 --> 15:27.460]  But above that, you're looking at the purple coloration.
[15:27.460 --> 15:30.500]  Below that, you're seeing very minimal purple coloration.
[15:30.500 --> 15:35.300]  Well, these when they have seedlings and it's that older tissue, that upper tissue that's
[15:35.300 --> 15:37.380]  kind of able to kind of change there.
[15:37.380 --> 15:40.180]  And you're seeing that distinctive, almost like a line.
[15:40.180 --> 15:42.340]  Someone drew a line right across there.
[15:42.340 --> 15:43.620]  And I don't have any.
[15:43.620 --> 15:46.420]  I should have taken or posted in some later pictures.
[15:46.420 --> 15:49.060]  But this coloration may disappear after a period of time.
[15:49.060 --> 15:52.420]  It may start to lighten up, may start to break up a little bit.
[15:52.420 --> 15:56.660]  So that is a sign that the plant's readjusting to its stressful environment.
[15:56.660 --> 15:59.940]  You could see here this soil, a relatively rocky based.
[16:00.900 --> 16:05.060]  I won't say real clay based, but definitely holds a lot of water.
[16:05.060 --> 16:07.540]  On the water table at this growing site was very high.
[16:08.260 --> 16:11.620]  So these plants were under a stress in that regards.
[16:11.620 --> 16:15.780]  Now, when we're talking about plants, outdoor settings is kind of like that zoomed out kind
[16:15.780 --> 16:16.500]  of image there.
[16:16.500 --> 16:17.540]  So just after they went in.
[16:17.540 --> 16:19.620]  So they are still relatively small.
[16:19.620 --> 16:24.020]  You can see that they were watered at least around them to get them established, which
[16:24.020 --> 16:27.700]  of course is important to get those plants kind of set up.
[16:27.700 --> 16:29.540]  But you can see that there is definitely a stress there.
[16:29.540 --> 16:35.380]  They went from a nice indoor environment where they were getting babied in probably all just
[16:35.380 --> 16:39.140]  the right amount of nutrients and just the right amount of light to here you go outside.
[16:40.500 --> 16:45.620]  So we have to keep that in mind to the transitioning of plants, the making a little bit a step
[16:45.620 --> 16:50.100]  there between where they were being taken care of to ultimate where they're going to
[16:50.100 --> 16:50.260]  go.
[16:50.260 --> 16:54.500]  Now, of course, they did for the most part grew out of this stressful situation, but
[16:54.500 --> 16:58.020]  it did cause a little bit of a delay in their production there.
[16:58.020 --> 17:02.340]  So again, any sort of delay there, you're just hurting yourself in the end.
[17:02.340 --> 17:05.380]  So you want to try to reduce those kind of stresses to the plant.
[17:06.340 --> 17:08.420]  Now, another purple coloration.
[17:08.420 --> 17:09.780]  This is a good purple coloration.
[17:09.780 --> 17:16.100]  So this is evidence of a particular variety or strain, or we can get into that whole debate
[17:16.100 --> 17:20.820]  there or trade name, I think is how they probably should be called, where this is
[17:20.820 --> 17:25.780]  naturally producing a lot of anthocyanins in the actual final butter, the final flower
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.420]  there.
[17:26.420 --> 17:28.900]  This would be something determined to be beneficial.
[17:28.900 --> 17:31.940]  Yes, it is a plant response, as we saw in those previous images.
[17:31.940 --> 17:39.860]  Here, this is a variety that's basically going through and producing that heavy, deep, almost
[17:39.860 --> 17:42.260]  blackish coloration.
[17:42.260 --> 17:45.940]  And this was in a greenhouse setting.
[17:45.940 --> 17:48.660]  So here you're getting a lot of light.
[17:48.660 --> 17:50.020]  We're not talking artificial light.
[17:50.020 --> 17:56.340]  We're talking a natural light shaded, probably only about 6% or 7%, depending what the actual
[17:56.340 --> 18:01.780]  covering was, whether it was a glass or a single or double layer poly covering.
[18:01.780 --> 18:06.180]  But this is really what's causing that deep, deep color to show up.
[18:06.180 --> 18:10.900]  And for breeding purposes, this is very beneficial because that is, as someone had mentioned,
[18:10.900 --> 18:12.820]  this is looking at anthocyanins.
[18:12.820 --> 18:14.340]  And I won't get too much into the science there.
[18:14.340 --> 18:19.140]  I did include a little bit of a link there if anyone wants to type in the full link there.
[18:19.140 --> 18:23.620]  But anthocyanins are basically, think of them as your classification of molecules that turn
[18:23.620 --> 18:29.140]  things that purple, deep reddish, almost pinky coloration.
[18:29.140 --> 18:32.660]  Pretty much what we'll see is that blue to purple coloration when we go through.
[18:33.540 --> 18:38.740]  So with those purples that we're seeing, they're really being expressed to a high degree.
[18:38.740 --> 18:41.460]  This is something that, of course, the plant produces.
[18:41.460 --> 18:45.140]  Plants produce a lot of things that we don't necessarily visually always see.
[18:45.140 --> 18:50.340]  But when we see those really dark colorations, these are produced at a very high level.
[18:50.340 --> 18:52.100]  And what are their main functions in plants?
[18:52.100 --> 18:57.540]  And I just chose a couple key ones here, but really to help attract pollinators, herbivores
[18:57.540 --> 18:58.820]  that disperse seeds.
[18:58.820 --> 19:02.260]  This is just in general, we're talking about anthocyanins, not just cannabis, of course.
[19:02.900 --> 19:06.580]  Protecting against cold stress, or really I say heat stress in general.
[19:06.580 --> 19:11.620]  You have that ice and fire kind of meeting that high temperatures and then cold temperatures.
[19:11.620 --> 19:14.820]  They go from a greenhouse environment where it's warm or they're happy right outside where
[19:14.820 --> 19:15.540]  it gets really cold.
[19:15.540 --> 19:17.540]  That can be another stress response.
[19:17.540 --> 19:21.620]  Deterring herbivores that maybe are attracted to green coloration is a plant's way of trying
[19:21.620 --> 19:22.180]  to hide.
[19:22.740 --> 19:25.380]  And then leopathy as well.
[19:25.380 --> 19:30.260]  We're talking about other plants here, but anthocyanins and maple leaves, the red coloration
[19:30.260 --> 19:35.140]  can actually stunt the growth of nearby saplings in the sense that those plants want one plant
[19:35.140 --> 19:37.140]  to actually grow and establish themselves.
[19:37.940 --> 19:39.140]  Apple trees do the same thing.
[19:39.140 --> 19:42.420]  They have abscisic acid in their seeds, so they delay that.
[19:42.420 --> 19:45.620]  So if you ever were small and took an apple and went to plant it outside and one of the
[19:45.620 --> 19:51.220]  why didn't grow, they naturally have a lot of suppressors in the natural seeds so that
[19:51.220 --> 19:57.780]  they grow when ideally the adult tree is kind of waning in its efficiency and then the small
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.580]  seedlings will grow.
[19:58.580 --> 20:01.540]  The adult plants don't want to complete directly with seedlings.
[20:01.540 --> 20:06.340]  So there's that inherent natural delay that occurs there.
[20:06.340 --> 20:11.220]  So it just kind of gives you a quick overview there of the general of the looking at those
[20:11.220 --> 20:13.940]  purple colorations that you might see in plants.
[20:13.940 --> 20:15.540]  I think that's all I have on that one.
[20:15.540 --> 20:19.060]  So I don't know if there's anyone had any particular questions or chat if you had anything
[20:19.060 --> 20:22.740]  on the anthocyanin purpleness of plants.
[20:22.740 --> 20:28.500]  Well, yeah, you had mentioned sometimes it's a stressor in the soil we were looking at.
[20:28.500 --> 20:30.580]  It retained a lot of water.
[20:30.580 --> 20:35.380]  So would maybe like an anaerobic condition contribute to it?
[20:35.380 --> 20:40.660]  Or would there be maybe like an imbalance of nutrients in that anaerobic environment
[20:40.660 --> 20:42.340]  or maybe all of the above?
[20:43.540 --> 20:49.860]  Depending on how anaerobic or stressful the situation is in the images I showed, it was
[20:49.860 --> 20:55.220]  basically water logging that led to reduction in oxygen availability.
[20:55.780 --> 21:01.780]  If you're getting into an anaerobic situation that will cause a nutrient imbalance, I'll
[21:01.780 --> 21:05.060]  say tune in, stay on here.
[21:05.060 --> 21:11.860]  I'm going to show you some actual cannabis responses to individual nutrient deficiencies
[21:11.860 --> 21:14.580]  that allow you to diagnose that a little bit more specifically.
[21:15.300 --> 21:15.700]  Excellent.
[21:15.700 --> 21:20.820]  And just as you had pointed out a few moments ago, plants can kind of grow out of it or
[21:20.820 --> 21:22.580]  you'll see it progress back to green.
[21:22.660 --> 21:24.420]  And I have definitely seen that myself.
[21:25.540 --> 21:31.460]  Typically when I'm going from like vegetative into the flowering and it's experiencing that
[21:31.460 --> 21:34.900]  stretch, I don't have the rhyme or reason for that.
[21:34.900 --> 21:40.180]  But sometimes when the stems had some purple striping on it, it hit that stretch and they
[21:40.180 --> 21:42.260]  kind of outgrew it and everything was good from there.
[21:42.260 --> 21:46.500]  And for my indoor growers too, if you get a branch coming out or a petiole or a leaf
[21:46.500 --> 21:49.860]  maybe, you sometimes will see the purple coloration on the top.
[21:49.860 --> 21:54.740]  When you flip it over to the underside, it'll remain green indicating that definitely light
[21:54.740 --> 21:58.500]  stress because where the light's becoming the most impact or getting that change and
[21:58.500 --> 22:02.980]  you flip it over and then all of a sudden it's the quote normal or the more green coloration.
[22:02.980 --> 22:05.140]  So at least to weed your plants.
[22:05.140 --> 22:05.460]  Yes.
[22:05.460 --> 22:05.780]  I know.
[22:05.780 --> 22:07.140]  I'm glad you brought that up too.
[22:07.140 --> 22:10.740]  I have definitely seen that where the fingers are overlaying each other.
[22:10.740 --> 22:13.540]  You'll lift this one and you'll have purple, green, purple.
[22:14.500 --> 22:16.020]  I think that's pretty cool.
[22:16.020 --> 22:21.860]  But that is typically a light stress and with the LEDs getting more bang for your dollar
[22:21.860 --> 22:25.940]  these days, fortunately it's easy to almost overpower your room.
[22:25.940 --> 22:27.300]  So yay for us.
[22:27.300 --> 22:29.060]  It's getting smaller and closer to those lights.
[22:29.060 --> 22:31.620]  It's exponential as that power goes up.
[22:32.260 --> 22:32.900]  Yeah.
[22:32.900 --> 22:33.460]  Well, cool.
[22:33.460 --> 22:38.180]  Oh, and then the last one I had just on this one was, you had mentioned again, a stress
[22:38.180 --> 22:40.100]  response to cold or heat.
[22:40.100 --> 22:45.380]  A lot of people in the cannabis world, we sometimes will call it bro science, but there
[22:45.380 --> 22:49.620]  was the ice water bath as you're getting towards the end, you dump on the ice water
[22:49.620 --> 22:50.740]  and you turn it purple.
[22:50.740 --> 22:56.020]  And I'm sure it has to be genetically possible for it to happen.
[22:56.020 --> 22:57.620]  Some will always happen.
[22:58.660 --> 23:04.180]  But yeah, that's kind of like you're saying, it's a stress that can bring out certain expressions,
[23:05.380 --> 23:06.420]  phenotypic traits.
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.780]  So, all right.
[23:10.340 --> 23:12.900]  And then let me, I'll bring this one back up.
[23:12.900 --> 23:19.300]  The next one, again, we had, this was something I was very interested in is just misconceptions
[23:19.300 --> 23:21.860]  of organic growing versus synthetic.
[23:22.980 --> 23:29.620]  Because I think there's a lot of people who just want to maybe ignore the science and
[23:29.620 --> 23:30.820]  fly a flag.
[23:30.820 --> 23:33.380]  So I'm somewhere in the middle.
[23:33.380 --> 23:37.780]  I like it all, but I approached, I appreciate the science approach.
[23:37.780 --> 23:41.140]  And so that's why I wanted to offer this question to you.
[23:41.140 --> 23:42.900]  So I'll let you go ahead and take that away.
[23:42.900 --> 23:43.700]  Thank you.
[23:43.700 --> 23:44.180]  Sure.
[23:44.180 --> 23:48.020]  So really, I mean, the best is really a combination of both systems.
[23:48.020 --> 23:52.100]  We'll talk about systems and I'll talk about why, where each offers its advantages.
[23:52.100 --> 23:58.180]  The big, I guess, separation is true synthetic fertilizers are really directly feeding the
[23:58.180 --> 24:01.540]  plant and kind of we'll say only the plant we're trying to grow.
[24:01.540 --> 24:08.100]  And organic fertilizers can in part directly feed the plant, but are also feeding, contributing
[24:08.100 --> 24:15.460]  to soil nutrients overall, maybe benefiting soil microbes or secondary things that indirectly
[24:15.460 --> 24:16.820]  come in contact with the plant.
[24:16.820 --> 24:19.620]  So that's kind of like your main initial distinction.
[24:19.620 --> 24:24.260]  I'd say the biggest misconception to input in the slides here, but just something that
[24:24.260 --> 24:30.420]  I see a lot of sometimes the organic growers can pollute the environment more than synthetic
[24:30.420 --> 24:33.060]  growers, which I know they don't want to hear and they don't think it's possible.
[24:33.060 --> 24:38.740]  But I think that's part of it where you can overdo things on an organic growing situation
[24:38.740 --> 24:41.060]  and organic can still pollute.
[24:41.620 --> 24:43.060]  Synthetic can also pollute as well.
[24:43.060 --> 24:44.820]  It's synthetic.
[24:44.820 --> 24:49.540]  It's a little easier or the tolerance for error is a little less with synthetics, but
[24:49.540 --> 24:55.540]  organic growing and thinking that it's all good and more is good and little is good is
[24:55.540 --> 24:57.540]  really probably the biggest misconception.
[24:57.540 --> 25:01.380]  It's always difficult when I deal with certain organic farmers and have to let them know
[25:01.940 --> 25:07.460]  that you piled on all this manure and now your phosphorus is 10 times higher than the
[25:07.460 --> 25:12.660]  commercial growers I'm dealing with and you're actually polluting more than a quote commercial
[25:12.660 --> 25:14.100]  or synthetic grower.
[25:14.100 --> 25:16.980]  So that's just kind of something important to keep in mind.
[25:16.980 --> 25:21.380]  And that again, comes back to that same point of the science there of understanding what
[25:21.380 --> 25:25.780]  you're doing and why you're doing it, not just blank, flinkly following like, oh yeah,
[25:25.780 --> 25:27.300]  I can, it's all natural.
[25:27.300 --> 25:30.340]  So I can do no harm in that sense.
[25:31.300 --> 25:36.580]  And that is, sorry to interject here, but that really is the mindset of some people.
[25:36.580 --> 25:38.260]  And I appreciate you putting that way.
[25:38.260 --> 25:44.340]  Cause I was asking myself, I'm like, well, how would the organic version of phosphorus
[25:44.340 --> 25:44.660]  pollute?
[25:44.660 --> 25:46.340]  Cause we were talking about phosphorus earlier.
[25:46.340 --> 25:54.420]  We all are aware of commercial farming and its depletion of oxygen and waterways, the
[25:54.420 --> 25:56.100]  dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
[25:56.900 --> 26:01.700]  So synthetic fertilizers have always been a big, a culprit.
[26:01.700 --> 26:05.700]  I'm not going to say scapegoat because they are responsible, but a culprit for a lot of
[26:05.700 --> 26:06.740]  these things.
[26:06.740 --> 26:11.780]  But it is interesting again to hear the flip side because we hear manure.
[26:11.780 --> 26:12.180]  Okay, great.
[26:12.180 --> 26:12.900]  Let's get manure.
[26:12.900 --> 26:13.620]  Let's pile it on.
[26:13.620 --> 26:16.580]  You can't burn your plants with organics.
[26:18.100 --> 26:21.700]  And then we just pile it on, not thinking three steps forward.
[26:21.700 --> 26:26.260]  So sorry to interject, but I thought that was a very important point to highlight there.
[26:26.260 --> 26:27.700]  No, I welcome it anytime.
[26:27.700 --> 26:28.020]  Yep.
[26:28.740 --> 26:29.460]  Let's see.
[26:30.740 --> 26:34.180]  So some of these I've had here and I did upload, let me just hit the other one.
[26:34.180 --> 26:37.620]  So some of the background image looks like background colorations on the presentation
[26:37.620 --> 26:38.900]  are a little darker, but that's okay.
[26:38.900 --> 26:40.180]  The main content is there.
[26:40.180 --> 26:44.260]  If there's anything I talk about in here and you see that title, that's basically the title
[26:44.260 --> 26:48.340]  I pulled right from my YouTube channel so you can go through and hear it again, so to
[26:48.340 --> 26:48.660]  speak.
[26:49.620 --> 26:54.100]  But chemical fertilizers, we just have to think about synthetics and chemicals and really
[26:54.100 --> 26:57.300]  it comes down to really a manufactured product.
[26:57.300 --> 26:59.060]  So I guess, how do we define organics?
[26:59.060 --> 27:01.140]  How do we define chemical or synthetics?
[27:01.140 --> 27:05.860]  It's basically a fertilizer that's, for lack of a better term, is manmade is really the
[27:05.860 --> 27:10.340]  best way to think about it, where your organics, like your manures, your compost are kind of
[27:10.340 --> 27:14.260]  like created with microbes or take different steps to get to that level.
[27:15.060 --> 27:20.580]  Now your chemical fertilizers, often they're water soluble, which is a great thing because
[27:20.580 --> 27:23.380]  it allows you to apply them many different ways.
[27:23.380 --> 27:28.740]  People might be using hydroponic growing or drip irrigation or using this big water tank
[27:28.740 --> 27:31.140]  and releasing fertilizers that with maybe an overhead.
[27:31.700 --> 27:36.260]  That really is beneficial to chemical-based fertilizers because they dissolve so well
[27:36.260 --> 27:36.740]  in water.
[27:37.300 --> 27:39.060]  They don't clog filters.
[27:39.060 --> 27:40.980]  They're very, it can be pH stabilized.
[27:41.700 --> 27:44.420]  So there's a lot of advantages in that regards.
[27:45.620 --> 27:50.820]  The biggest advantage to chemical fertilizers is that ease of application, a clean operation.
[27:50.820 --> 27:55.860]  So for anyone who's maybe tried organics and had any sort of filters, you probably were
[27:55.860 --> 28:01.300]  very familiar with filter changes or clogged filters or anything to that nature of building
[28:01.300 --> 28:05.060]  up the sludge or the just organic compounds there.
[28:05.700 --> 28:08.820]  Chemical fertilizers, because they're so water soluble, and that's why I have a picture
[28:08.820 --> 28:11.300]  of the small child there, is you can spoon feed them.
[28:11.300 --> 28:16.980]  You can even give them just little small doses, which offers the grower great control.
[28:16.980 --> 28:23.780]  You don't have to pile on one ton of manure to a thousand square feet or to the acre or
[28:23.780 --> 28:24.500]  whatever.
[28:24.500 --> 28:29.060]  You can put in an eighth of a teaspoon, a quarter of a teaspoon.
[28:29.060 --> 28:30.900]  You can do that multiple times.
[28:30.900 --> 28:34.900]  You can really dial it into what the plant needs at the particular time.
[28:34.900 --> 28:39.220]  How often, as I said, caution should be for over application because it's really easy
[28:39.220 --> 28:40.580]  to over add.
[28:40.580 --> 28:45.140]  And as a result, you can burn your plants more so with the synthetic or the chemical
[28:45.140 --> 28:46.340]  based fertilizers.
[28:47.060 --> 28:49.300]  The organic fertilizers are not manufactured.
[28:49.300 --> 28:51.620]  As I said, they're typically found or created by nature.
[28:52.500 --> 28:56.740]  Natural fertilizers, just as some examples that I know a lot of growers utilize are seaweed,
[28:56.740 --> 29:02.500]  kelp, manure, worm castings, bone meal, blood meal, and 8 million other things.
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.820]  Someone's mentioned seabird guano, bat guano.
[29:04.820 --> 29:08.820]  All of those would be under the classification of organic fertilizers.
[29:09.380 --> 29:11.380]  So they're typically slower release.
[29:11.380 --> 29:16.420]  So that means while they can still burn the plants if you over add them, they tend to
[29:16.420 --> 29:17.140]  be slower release.
[29:17.140 --> 29:23.700]  So if you're adding X amount of pounds of fertilizer in a blood meal situation and high
[29:23.700 --> 29:26.900]  nitrogen based, that's going to be like 90, 95% available.
[29:26.900 --> 29:27.940]  That's going to be really quickly available.
[29:27.940 --> 29:31.860]  That's going to be similar to your synthetic fertilizers.
[29:31.860 --> 29:36.820]  But something else like a compost is going to be available over a longer duration of
[29:36.820 --> 29:37.540]  time.
[29:37.540 --> 29:42.180]  I would definitely say bone meal, for example, is typically used a lot of people believe
[29:42.180 --> 29:45.460]  for it, for the, you know, the bloom phase and I want my roots to grow.
[29:45.460 --> 29:49.060]  And, you know, they're growing an auto flower, which may be, you know, it's only 80 days
[29:49.060 --> 29:50.740]  and they're like, all right, it's in the flower now.
[29:50.740 --> 29:52.660]  Now I'm going to add my bone meal.
[29:52.660 --> 29:56.260]  Well, by the time the bone meal breaks down as plant available, you've already harvested
[29:56.260 --> 29:56.820]  your crop.
[29:56.820 --> 29:58.820]  So it's a feel good fertilizer to add.
[29:58.820 --> 29:59.460]  It is organic.
[30:00.020 --> 30:04.420]  But when you look at the science of the actual microbial breakdown, you're really not giving
[30:04.420 --> 30:07.140]  much benefit to your plants there.
[30:07.140 --> 30:11.540]  And as I said here, it is still possible to create toxic conditions in your soil, especially
[30:11.540 --> 30:16.820]  with manures that tend to be over and over applied or applied again and again and again,
[30:16.820 --> 30:18.500]  because it's seen as something natural.
[30:18.500 --> 30:21.860]  That's just one example there of over adding that.
[30:22.580 --> 30:23.140]  Organic.
[30:23.140 --> 30:27.540]  I always love this kind of the scientific definition of what organic actually is means
[30:27.540 --> 30:28.980]  basically contains carbon.
[30:29.780 --> 30:33.940]  The misleading definition is organic farming to some extent because it can be produced
[30:33.940 --> 30:37.460]  without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides or artificial agents.
[30:37.460 --> 30:43.700]  I always remind people this is for apples to tomatoes to anything else in between.
[30:43.700 --> 30:47.940]  If it's organic, it is not the same as no spray.
[30:47.940 --> 30:49.460]  A lot of people think, oh, it's organic.
[30:49.460 --> 30:53.940]  It was just tossed out in the field, allowed to grow a natural life and then just, you
[30:53.940 --> 30:57.620]  know, harvested spray products on organic production.
[30:58.340 --> 31:03.860]  It's a much more limited list and the organic production, again, depending on what state
[31:03.860 --> 31:08.820]  you're in and what your organic regulator, you know, you get on the day, sadly, in some
[31:08.820 --> 31:10.660]  instances, what products might be allowed.
[31:10.660 --> 31:16.580]  But I think for the most part, USDA OMRI certified is kind of probably the generally the larger
[31:16.580 --> 31:17.300]  standard there.
[31:17.860 --> 31:25.140]  What's kind of interesting is in OMRI, the last check, they had 189 results when I searched
[31:25.140 --> 31:27.380]  their full list over 5000 products.
[31:27.380 --> 31:30.500]  That had some sort of copper base to them.
[31:30.500 --> 31:36.820]  It could be and this could be for a disease control as well as, you know, nutrient lines.
[31:36.820 --> 31:41.940]  But really for a disease control, having a heavy copper base, the downfall to your copper
[31:41.940 --> 31:43.700]  sulfates is typically what's utilized.
[31:43.700 --> 31:49.220]  It can accumulate in the environment and it doesn't contain carbon and it can build up
[31:49.220 --> 31:50.180]  in the soil.
[31:50.180 --> 31:56.580]  So here's just one example of an organic product that can be applied to organic, you
[31:56.580 --> 31:59.780]  know, infrastructure, but can still cause environmental problems.
[31:59.780 --> 32:03.940]  Now, of course, if it's applied in the correct manner and the timing is right, the dosage
[32:03.940 --> 32:08.900]  is right, and the amount of applications are kept to a minimum, there's not a guarantee
[32:08.900 --> 32:10.420]  it's going to cause problems.
[32:10.420 --> 32:14.100]  But when you hear something organic and people think, oh, it's organic, I can add as much
[32:14.100 --> 32:14.500]  as I want.
[32:14.500 --> 32:15.860]  It's not going to cause any problems.
[32:16.580 --> 32:21.860]  This is just one example there where this can cause some issues with the environment
[32:21.860 --> 32:24.340]  and still be, quote, OMRI certified.
[32:25.220 --> 32:29.300]  And organics is in general, you know, there's nice pictures of all those organic materials.
[32:29.860 --> 32:34.180]  Really, the goal is really to compost them, whether it's composted manure or composted
[32:34.820 --> 32:35.460]  plant matter.
[32:36.020 --> 32:39.220]  Fresh manures can easily burn the plants, particularly chicken manure.
[32:39.940 --> 32:43.940]  Organic standards often require a set number of days before a manure application to when
[32:43.940 --> 32:45.380]  you harvest the crop.
[32:45.380 --> 32:50.020]  Sometimes it's 180, might depend on the state and regulatory, that's what you have.
[32:50.020 --> 32:53.620]  But you can't just mid-season apply manure and quote, have an organic crop.
[32:53.620 --> 32:56.900]  You can't harvest that until sometimes 180 days out.
[32:56.900 --> 32:59.140]  You also want to know the source of the material.
[32:59.140 --> 33:00.020]  Was it cow manure?
[33:00.020 --> 33:00.740]  Was it llama manure?
[33:00.740 --> 33:01.540]  Was it chicken manure?
[33:01.540 --> 33:02.420]  Was it rabbit manure?
[33:03.060 --> 33:04.740]  How long has it been composted?
[33:04.740 --> 33:05.780]  Has it been composted at all?
[33:05.780 --> 33:07.380]  Was it static pile compost?
[33:07.380 --> 33:10.980]  Kind of here we see on the left, what type of bedding was used?
[33:11.780 --> 33:15.300]  You know, we associate the image on the right probably with the, you know, what we all want,
[33:15.300 --> 33:20.020]  that dark kind of, you know, that nice heat being gone through, being turned over.
[33:20.660 --> 33:25.060]  And visually looking at it, yes, that does look like a great way of producing compost,
[33:25.060 --> 33:26.100]  nice and wind rose.
[33:26.100 --> 33:28.260]  But you need a little bit more information than that.
[33:28.260 --> 33:29.380]  How old is it?
[33:29.380 --> 33:34.580]  You know, and if you have a professional person really specializing in compost, they can produce
[33:34.580 --> 33:37.620]  quality compost in half of a year, about six months.
[33:37.620 --> 33:38.900]  It is possible.
[33:38.900 --> 33:42.420]  But if you're just kind of having the static pile, the grower that kind of turns it every
[33:42.420 --> 33:48.420]  once in a while, it might take as long as three years to get to that same quality end
[33:48.420 --> 33:49.060]  product there.
[33:49.140 --> 33:51.460]  So again, you can't say, oh, it's under a year.
[33:51.460 --> 33:52.100]  It cannot be good.
[33:52.100 --> 33:53.860]  It's got to be at least three years old.
[33:53.860 --> 33:57.700]  It depends on how it's kind of handled is the best way to think about it.
[33:57.700 --> 34:01.220]  And organically grown cannabis, you know, anecdotal reports often say, you know, sweeter
[34:01.220 --> 34:05.700]  tastes, better aromas compared to the chemical or synthetic produced fertilizers.
[34:05.700 --> 34:07.780]  But really this hasn't improved scientifically.
[34:08.340 --> 34:13.140]  And we also have to take into account if someone is growing organically, there could be other
[34:13.140 --> 34:17.060]  practices in play that they may not be associated with more than just the fertilizers that's
[34:17.060 --> 34:21.940]  contributing to that better taste, flavors, aromas or so on and so forth.
[34:21.940 --> 34:26.420]  It may not just be the fact that they used a chemical based fertilizer versus an organic
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.540]  based fertilizer.
[34:27.540 --> 34:30.100]  So take that into consideration as well.
[34:30.660 --> 34:34.820]  A nitrogen is basically going to be taken up as a salt form by the plant, whether it's
[34:34.820 --> 34:37.620]  organically derived or synthetically derived.
[34:37.620 --> 34:37.940]  There.
[34:38.980 --> 34:40.500]  That's awesome.
[34:40.500 --> 34:42.180]  Very, very good points there.
[34:42.420 --> 34:46.580]  You know, the drying and the curing, which we don't have to get into, but drying and
[34:46.580 --> 34:50.340]  the curing can make such a big difference on the final crop.
[34:51.540 --> 34:55.620]  Sometimes when you're going that extra mile to baby the steps, you'd go the extra mile
[34:55.620 --> 34:56.500]  in those stages.
[34:56.500 --> 34:59.540]  And as you said, there could be other contributing factors, too.
[34:59.540 --> 35:02.500]  So it'll be it'll be interesting to see.
[35:02.500 --> 35:07.140]  Again, we at the top of the show, we said cannabis testing is improving and becoming
[35:07.140 --> 35:08.020]  more common.
[35:08.020 --> 35:11.380]  So hopefully some of these things will be sussed out as far as new and old.
[35:12.180 --> 35:17.860]  Maybe terpene levels or I don't necessarily know that cannabinoid levels would be a measure
[35:17.860 --> 35:21.220]  of a sweeter harvest or a better harvest.
[35:21.220 --> 35:28.020]  But I think terpenes flavonoids would certainly be a good data point to kind of track there.
[35:29.220 --> 35:32.900]  And you had also mentioned to, you know, just the organic.
[35:32.900 --> 35:40.020]  I've for when I was going to school for this stuff, the definition of organic has drastically
[35:40.020 --> 35:43.540]  changed as far as the practices that are acceptable.
[35:43.540 --> 35:50.420]  And if you flashed back 10 years to an organic farmer and told him in 10 years X, Y and Z
[35:50.420 --> 35:54.740]  would be considered organic, they'd lose their mind.
[35:56.420 --> 36:00.740]  So that's where that science, you know, so I say sciences, it contains carbon and here's
[36:00.740 --> 36:05.940]  Omri certifying copper based fungicides or fertilizers that have no carbon in it.
[36:05.940 --> 36:12.100]  So it's, you know, organic definitely became a common buzzword and, you know, it was picked
[36:12.100 --> 36:15.220]  up and made to be different definitions.
[36:15.220 --> 36:18.980]  And that's why I try to define it there because it's what definition are you choosing to use
[36:18.980 --> 36:21.140]  or do you understand it to be when someone says that?
[36:22.020 --> 36:22.500]  Exactly.
[36:22.500 --> 36:26.740]  And a lot of these things, you know, probably copper included haven't really been tested
[36:26.740 --> 36:27.780]  for combustion.
[36:28.660 --> 36:34.020]  A lot of these sprays, you know, Omri we see in the grow shop, we see the Omri label.
[36:34.020 --> 36:35.700]  We're like, ah, okay, check mark, good.
[36:36.580 --> 36:38.820]  But we do need to read past the label on that.
[36:40.980 --> 36:46.260]  And then I think one more point too, that you made up, which is really another big difference
[36:46.260 --> 36:51.700]  between the organic and synthetic is just bioavailability of what you're putting in.
[36:51.700 --> 36:55.620]  And I'm glad you mentioned that because again, it sounds like a lot of the organic ingredients,
[36:56.660 --> 37:02.980]  you know, as far as their punch can be just as strong as the synthetics, but it takes
[37:02.980 --> 37:04.740]  longer to get there, right?
[37:06.180 --> 37:10.100]  And it's just that delay that growers have to realize and utilize that that can be to
[37:10.100 --> 37:11.220]  your advantage.
[37:11.220 --> 37:16.740]  The advantage of that organic fertilizer is that it could carry you through the season.
[37:17.620 --> 37:20.660]  Particularly we'll talk about, you know, just compost in an outdoor situation, but that's
[37:20.660 --> 37:23.940]  why I say you might need those synthetics when that soil is really cold, or they're
[37:23.940 --> 37:28.420]  just starting out in the spring or the start of your season, that soil temperature may
[37:28.420 --> 37:30.820]  not be at the peak microbial availability.
[37:30.820 --> 37:35.140]  So using a couple synthetics early on, those will be immediately plant available, that'll
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.100]  get your plants growing.
[37:36.820 --> 37:41.220]  And then as that soil temperature warms up, as those microbes become more active, now
[37:41.220 --> 37:45.620]  your organics, your compost base will start to feed the plant, and you can start to reduce
[37:45.620 --> 37:48.420]  the amount of synthetics or chemical fertilizer utilizing.
[37:48.420 --> 37:53.860]  So just a prime example there of how you can utilize both to your advantage and one isn't
[37:53.860 --> 37:56.020]  completely evil and one's not completely the best.
[37:56.740 --> 38:01.380]  Utilizing an approach and a scientific based approach to utilizing each is really the best
[38:01.380 --> 38:02.020]  way forward.
[38:03.140 --> 38:05.300]  I, you know, I'm glad that you brought that up.
[38:05.300 --> 38:11.540]  I didn't think about microbial activity, temperature of the soil, although I know that over here
[38:11.540 --> 38:14.980]  put into that context, I'm just like, ah, another light bulb moment.
[38:14.980 --> 38:16.980]  So I appreciate that.
[38:16.980 --> 38:20.980]  And yeah, we had some guys, you know, I used to say that I was a synganic, you know, I
[38:20.980 --> 38:24.980]  do a little bit of the synthetic, mainly organic stuff.
[38:24.980 --> 38:28.660]  But again, you know, if I need something fast acting, I'll reach for that.
[38:28.660 --> 38:33.460]  I'm now transitioning away to that, to doing more top amendments.
[38:33.460 --> 38:38.820]  But that is where my experimentation is coming in because you're right, it's not bioavailable
[38:38.820 --> 38:39.300]  right away.
[38:39.300 --> 38:44.260]  I need to basically learn, okay, if I apply it today is three weeks when it's going to
[38:44.260 --> 38:44.740]  kick in.
[38:45.700 --> 38:46.420]  Trial and error.
[38:46.420 --> 38:47.860]  That's the fun of gardening though, right?
[38:47.860 --> 38:52.260]  And being realized when you do need to reduce your synthetics because the organics are taking
[38:52.260 --> 38:55.860]  over because you think I just added one tablespoon per gallon, but now your organics become
[38:55.860 --> 38:56.340]  available.
[38:56.340 --> 39:01.220]  And that's where you get into mainly you'll get those nitrogen toxicity or nitrogen just
[39:01.220 --> 39:01.860]  way get elevated.
[39:01.860 --> 39:03.540]  And you're like, well, I'm adding the same amount.
[39:03.540 --> 39:08.340]  We're not taking consideration what might be happening at the microbial level with that.
[39:08.980 --> 39:09.220]  Yep.
[39:09.220 --> 39:13.620]  And I see a comment in here from Ken, another one of our hosts here on the channel.
[39:13.620 --> 39:15.460]  It's all about the biology.
[39:15.460 --> 39:15.700]  Yes.
[39:16.580 --> 39:18.100]  Biology 710.
[39:18.100 --> 39:18.500]  Yes.
[39:18.500 --> 39:19.780]  All about biology.
[39:19.780 --> 39:22.500]  So soil biology, good thing to have.
[39:22.500 --> 39:23.140]  Let's see here.
[39:23.140 --> 39:24.180]  Oh, wrong comment.
[39:24.180 --> 39:24.580]  I don't know.
[39:25.300 --> 39:26.900]  I'm just hitting all kinds of buttons here.
[39:27.620 --> 39:27.860]  Okay.
[39:27.860 --> 39:28.740]  There we go.
[39:28.740 --> 39:29.620]  I know what I'm saying.
[39:29.620 --> 39:30.180]  On your end.
[39:30.180 --> 39:30.820]  Yeah.
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.460]  Yeah, I know.
[39:31.460 --> 39:32.180]  That was all me.
[39:32.820 --> 39:33.780]  All me on this end.
[39:34.740 --> 39:34.980]  Cool.
[39:34.980 --> 39:38.820]  So let's go into the next topic that we had here.
[39:39.620 --> 39:43.140]  And that is immobile and mobile nutrients.
[39:43.140 --> 39:50.820]  This I wanted to have you elaborate on because this is a really beneficial tool in my eyes for
[39:50.820 --> 39:51.940]  plant diagnosis.
[39:53.700 --> 39:55.780]  So I'll let you kind of roll with that.
[39:55.780 --> 40:01.860]  But that's why for me, for getting this in the ears of growers is very important.
[40:01.860 --> 40:03.860]  So I'll let you take that away again.
[40:04.740 --> 40:10.660]  This is probably my most viewed and kind of talked about content on my channel there,
[40:10.740 --> 40:13.460]  mobile and mobile nutrients and nutrient deficiencies.
[40:13.460 --> 40:17.060]  I do have a whole set on diseases and insects and everything else, but
[40:17.060 --> 40:18.580]  let me, it always goes back to the nutrients.
[40:18.580 --> 40:23.140]  And I'll preface this with that's always the nutrient, but these are great ways to kind of
[40:23.140 --> 40:23.940]  increase the odds.
[40:23.940 --> 40:28.580]  Maybe it's the nutrient issue or kind of determine at least what nutrient might want to go through
[40:28.580 --> 40:30.020]  and kind of utilize.
[40:30.020 --> 40:34.260]  And I wanted to just put in here just primary nutrients, you know, just the main ones,
[40:34.260 --> 40:36.980]  nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are your main three.
[40:36.980 --> 40:38.100]  Nitrogen is the first number.
[40:38.100 --> 40:42.020]  So if you see fertilizer packages, that first number is your nitrogen helps with the rapid
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.220]  growth of leaves.
[40:43.220 --> 40:47.540]  Often comes fertilizer applications can be fixed by the air by legumes.
[40:47.540 --> 40:52.100]  If you're doing a companion planting, some soil bacteria can also go through and do that as
[40:52.100 --> 40:52.820]  well.
[40:52.820 --> 40:57.380]  Over applications though can cause your internodes to stretch brittle, dark leaves, difficult
[40:57.380 --> 40:58.500]  to root if you're cloning.
[40:59.140 --> 41:02.260]  So this one does let you know when you over fertilize.
[41:03.300 --> 41:04.900]  Phosphorus doesn't really do that.
[41:04.900 --> 41:07.220]  It is essential part of the photosynthetic process.
[41:07.220 --> 41:13.060]  It's a critical part of DNA, encourages root growth, encourages blooming, often comes in
[41:13.060 --> 41:13.620]  fertilizers.
[41:13.620 --> 41:16.740]  It's that middle number and also found in manures.
[41:16.740 --> 41:21.140]  You may see some fertilizers, which aren't necessarily a bad thing that have a zero for
[41:21.140 --> 41:22.340]  the middle number.
[41:22.340 --> 41:27.540]  A lot of turf grass industries are going under phosphorus restrictions indicating that this
[41:27.540 --> 41:28.580]  is such a large problem.
[41:28.580 --> 41:34.340]  So just because you have a zero for a middle number, don't take that as a bad thing or a
[41:34.340 --> 41:38.740]  fertilizer you don't want to buy because it might have nitrogen, potassium and some other
[41:38.740 --> 41:39.300]  things.
[41:39.300 --> 41:42.740]  You may not need the fertilizer of this phosphorus.
[41:42.740 --> 41:44.740]  You might be able to supplement that with another fertilizer.
[41:44.740 --> 41:50.180]  And I think that's what's been difficult for some growers to buy a fertilizer that is zero
[41:50.180 --> 41:53.060]  glaring in their face as that middle number there.
[41:53.780 --> 41:55.620]  The last number would be potassium or K.
[41:56.260 --> 41:57.540]  That's NPK.
[41:57.540 --> 42:01.620]  It's absorbed by the plants and larger than most other mineral elements except nitrogen
[42:02.660 --> 42:03.940]  and in some cases calcium.
[42:04.340 --> 42:06.020]  Potassium and calcium kind of compete.
[42:06.020 --> 42:08.660]  So if you over add potassium, you could be blocking your calcium.
[42:08.660 --> 42:13.300]  So important for growers growing maybe in cocoa coir just to keep in mind potassium
[42:13.300 --> 42:17.860]  supplemented by the soil minerals, organic minerals, as well as the fertilizer, carbohydrate
[42:17.860 --> 42:20.020]  metabolism, disease resistance.
[42:20.020 --> 42:24.580]  And it becomes a little bit more important as you get later into the season, kind of
[42:24.580 --> 42:26.020]  mid flower and on.
[42:26.900 --> 42:28.500]  So common campus nutrient deficiencies.
[42:28.500 --> 42:33.620]  This is one that is probably I get asked the most about for sure.
[42:33.860 --> 42:35.620]  I'm sorry, the background's a little dark.
[42:35.620 --> 42:44.500]  I'm not sure if I can go back through and let me just see if I can do a quick re upload
[42:44.500 --> 42:45.460]  maybe, Chad, here.
[42:45.460 --> 42:46.180]  Let me do this.
[42:49.300 --> 42:52.340]  I just pulled my classic talking while the mic's muted.
[42:52.340 --> 42:53.860]  I do that at least once an episode.
[42:55.140 --> 42:59.780]  But yeah, no, go ahead and try readjusting that if you like.
[42:59.780 --> 43:02.020]  Then we'll re upload and continue from there.
[43:03.620 --> 43:06.100]  I'll just say hi to everybody in chat right now.
[43:06.100 --> 43:07.060]  Let's be buds.
[43:07.060 --> 43:07.940]  Here's my hands.
[43:07.940 --> 43:08.900]  How you doing, buddy?
[43:09.780 --> 43:17.940]  Uncut squishy mirror, 710 can of sewer, Dr. Libby alone, Smiley's Garden, weedist, martial
[43:17.940 --> 43:19.060]  artist, Russell.
[43:19.060 --> 43:24.180]  I wonder if this is top chat or live chat over here on our end.
[43:24.180 --> 43:25.860]  It's a little bit different than the YouTube.
[43:25.860 --> 43:31.860]  So if I didn't holler at you guys, I definitely see you and I appreciate you all for being
[43:31.860 --> 43:32.100]  here.
[43:33.060 --> 43:35.460]  This has been great so far.
[43:36.020 --> 43:41.940]  Let's see if I can hop back in here with the slides for you guys.
[43:42.660 --> 43:44.420]  Let's see here if that works.
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.980]  Because I didn't change the name.
[43:46.980 --> 43:51.700]  Let's say, I'll pop that out there again, but that's okay.
[43:52.660 --> 43:53.460]  Let me show you this.
[43:55.540 --> 43:56.740]  Yeah, no worries.
[43:56.740 --> 43:59.620]  And everybody, we definitely will have some times for questions.
[43:59.780 --> 44:05.620]  If you want to get your questions in, as we're going through the presentation here, I'm putting
[44:05.620 --> 44:08.340]  little stars next to them so I can pull them up again.
[44:10.260 --> 44:11.460]  Let's see here.
[44:12.660 --> 44:16.420]  Take, let's see, remove that one.
[44:17.940 --> 44:19.460]  But yeah, go ahead and-
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.100]  Do you see another one there, Chad?
[44:22.100 --> 44:23.620]  Let's see here, I've got-
[44:24.900 --> 44:26.340]  Here we go, try that one.
[44:26.340 --> 44:26.660]  Okay.
[44:26.660 --> 44:27.860]  Turn the screen just to-
[44:28.180 --> 44:30.420]  Yeah, that'll probably work here.
[44:30.420 --> 44:32.980]  Looks like it's removed the color from it.
[44:34.180 --> 44:37.780]  And I think we were on 28, possibly.
[44:37.780 --> 44:38.260]  There we go.
[44:38.260 --> 44:39.220]  All right, let's see.
[44:39.220 --> 44:39.780]  There we go.
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.940]  Which again, this is awesome.
[44:41.940 --> 44:47.620]  And everybody too, in the show notes, there is a link directly to his YouTube page.
[44:47.620 --> 44:51.540]  I'm also going to show that here a little bit later in the episode because I want everybody
[44:51.540 --> 44:52.740]  to check that out.
[44:52.740 --> 44:56.740]  Because this is where a lot of the material we're covering today is coming from.
[44:56.740 --> 45:00.740]  So if you're enjoying it, there's a whole lot more.
[45:00.740 --> 45:05.380]  So, all right, I'll go ahead and let you continue here if you'd like.
[45:05.380 --> 45:06.340]  No problem, no problem.
[45:06.340 --> 45:09.220]  I think we got the color background figured out as you can see a little bit more.
[45:09.220 --> 45:12.740]  There's lots of the comparisons here of the leaves.
[45:12.740 --> 45:16.740]  So when we talk about mobile versus immobile nutrients, mobile is basically something that
[45:16.740 --> 45:18.500]  can move in the plant, as the name implies.
[45:18.500 --> 45:20.580]  And then mobile is fixed in place.
[45:20.580 --> 45:22.820]  So how does that play into the importance here?
[45:22.820 --> 45:28.100]  Well, with mobile nutrients, they tend to be pulled out of the older growth and show
[45:28.100 --> 45:30.660]  up in the newer tissue there.
[45:30.660 --> 45:33.220]  And actually, since I'm sharing my screen, I don't know if I can.
[45:33.220 --> 45:37.060]  Let's see if we can go really high end here.
[45:37.060 --> 45:37.620]  There we go.
[45:37.620 --> 45:41.700]  I'm going to pop a little, I don't know if that shows up or not, my little mouse cursor.
[45:41.700 --> 45:46.580]  But so when we're dealing with those mobile nutrients, because they move to newer tissues,
[45:47.060 --> 45:51.620]  because they move to newer tissues, they're going to show up in those older plant tissues
[45:51.620 --> 45:52.100]  first.
[45:52.100 --> 45:55.940]  And then they're least likely to show up in that newer tissue because the plant can actually
[45:55.940 --> 45:59.380]  physically move them from one area to another.
[45:59.380 --> 46:02.020]  And as I mentioned, those primary nutrients, those are the ones I just covered.
[46:02.020 --> 46:07.220]  The reason why I covered those and focused on those is they are the major nutrients needed
[46:07.220 --> 46:09.700]  in the largest quantities by the plant.
[46:09.700 --> 46:15.780]  So if you don't have enough primary nutrients, really, or if your pH is off, that's before,
[46:15.780 --> 46:16.980]  can forget about the rest.
[46:16.980 --> 46:21.380]  The rest is going to cause issues, but you got to correct those two first.
[46:21.380 --> 46:25.460]  Secondary nutrients, your calcium, your magnesium, your sulfurs, those are needed in smaller
[46:25.460 --> 46:26.340]  quantities.
[46:26.340 --> 46:31.060]  In your micronutrients, which everyone I know loves to pay a lot of attention to, they are
[46:31.060 --> 46:35.540]  required nutrient, but they're needed in very, very small amounts.
[46:35.540 --> 46:40.500]  So keep that in mind that you don't have a need to have them in very large amounts.
[46:40.500 --> 46:41.540]  And they are essential.
[46:41.540 --> 46:42.580]  So you do need boron.
[46:42.580 --> 46:44.020]  You actually need chlorine, believe it or not.
[46:44.020 --> 46:49.220]  As much as people who may water with tap water or town water, city water might want to have
[46:49.220 --> 46:49.780]  no chlorine.
[46:49.780 --> 46:52.100]  There is a small amount that's needed by the plants.
[46:52.740 --> 46:56.660]  Calcium, magnesium, kind of more your mid-level, they are secondary nutrients, particularly
[46:56.660 --> 46:59.700]  for growing in cocoa coir, as I mentioned earlier, calcium for sure is needed.
[47:00.580 --> 47:04.980]  Chelated fertilizers, those are the ones that are more stable and plant-available sources
[47:04.980 --> 47:05.940]  of nutrients.
[47:05.940 --> 47:08.180]  This is improved fertilizer use efficiency.
[47:08.740 --> 47:13.140]  So if you can find a chelated nutrient, it can also typically be foliar applied as well.
[47:13.140 --> 47:16.900]  And it basically just helps that nutrient get taken up by the plant.
[47:16.900 --> 47:22.180]  This is why if you take a calcium supplement, a lot of times it'd be a calcium and magnesium
[47:22.180 --> 47:25.940]  supplement because the magnesium actually helps your body better absorb that.
[47:26.580 --> 47:28.980]  Chelation of fertilizers, kind of the same concept.
[47:30.180 --> 47:34.580]  So nitrogen deficiency, if you will, kind of a great picture here of a nitrogen deficient
[47:34.580 --> 47:35.140]  plant.
[47:35.140 --> 47:36.580]  It's a mobile nutrient.
[47:36.580 --> 47:42.100]  So that means your top growth is still green or I would say the correct coloration of green.
[47:42.100 --> 47:47.300]  And as you work your way down the plant, you notice you go to a limey green to a yellow,
[47:47.300 --> 47:50.100]  ultimately down to kind of a dead or brown leaf.
[47:50.100 --> 47:54.340]  This is the plant taking that nitrogen from the lower leaves, pushing it up to the top
[47:54.340 --> 47:59.220]  portion of the plant there, translocating that, moving that nutrient from the older
[47:59.220 --> 48:03.380]  growth to where that newer growth is, where it's getting the most sun and ideally going
[48:03.380 --> 48:05.380]  to produce the greatest yield.
[48:06.180 --> 48:09.300]  Phosphorus, this is something we talked about being over-applied.
[48:09.300 --> 48:12.180]  A lot of people, when they see this purple coloration to the leaves, immediately go,
[48:12.180 --> 48:13.780]  it's phosphorus deficiency.
[48:13.780 --> 48:18.660]  But I refer you back to our earlier part of our conversation where purple coloration can
[48:18.660 --> 48:22.020]  be also an environmental stress as well.
[48:22.020 --> 48:26.260]  Don't always think just because you see phosphorus or see purple coloration, that's
[48:26.260 --> 48:28.340]  immediately it's a phosphorus deficiency.
[48:28.340 --> 48:33.140]  It can be evidence of phosphorus deficiency, but if you're adding phosphorus really in
[48:33.140 --> 48:38.820]  any quantity in particular, it looks to other environmental factors that might be the root
[48:38.820 --> 48:39.860]  cause of the problem.
[48:40.980 --> 48:44.740]  Potassium deficiency, so again, our N, P, and K, first ones to focus on there.
[48:44.740 --> 48:47.140]  Potassium is evident when you catch it early.
[48:47.140 --> 48:51.780]  The very, it's called the leaf margins, the very edges of the leaf will actually turn
[48:52.420 --> 48:53.300]  yellow.
[48:53.300 --> 48:56.500]  And this is basically going to hurt your sugar production, your overall yield.
[48:57.140 --> 48:59.060]  It's really that margin that's first to show it.
[48:59.060 --> 49:03.300]  And this is also going to show, remember, in those lower leaves and then translocate
[49:03.300 --> 49:04.260]  upper there.
[49:04.260 --> 49:10.020]  Potassium, or I should say sulfate of potassium and potassium chloride are the two most common
[49:10.020 --> 49:10.900]  sources.
[49:10.900 --> 49:15.620]  Potassium chloride is 60, 6-0% potassium.
[49:15.620 --> 49:18.180]  Sulfate potassium is only 50, 5-0%.
[49:18.900 --> 49:21.860]  But potassium chloride does come with a higher salt content.
[49:21.860 --> 49:24.420]  So just take that into consideration as well.
[49:24.420 --> 49:26.420]  That both are pretty potent in potassium.
[49:26.420 --> 49:30.340]  If you're on a large scale outdoor growing, usually potassium chloride is chosen because
[49:30.340 --> 49:32.100]  you need to just apply less product.
[49:32.100 --> 49:37.140]  Potassium sulfate would be the other choice, other option, might be advised by some growers
[49:37.140 --> 49:38.980]  because it is lower in salt content.
[49:40.020 --> 49:42.580]  Now, calcium deficiency is an immobile nutrient.
[49:43.220 --> 49:48.260]  It kind of shows up as this kind of like brown spots or speckling or poorly forming fruit
[49:48.260 --> 49:49.220]  and blossom ends.
[49:50.980 --> 49:54.100]  Everyone's probably familiar with tomatoes where the blossom end starts to rot out.
[49:54.100 --> 49:56.260]  This is kind of what looks like on a cannabis plant.
[49:57.060 --> 50:02.180]  Botanica or CalMag Max or Biomin calcium, you want to add some sort of calcium product.
[50:02.180 --> 50:05.540]  But when you're adding a calcium product, you can't just apply it once and expect it
[50:05.540 --> 50:06.260]  to change.
[50:06.260 --> 50:10.900]  A lot of times in a calcium deficiency, you need repeated applications to kind of saturate
[50:10.900 --> 50:16.500]  the plant so it can uptake that calcium and translocate it through and correct that issue.
[50:16.500 --> 50:18.500]  So calcium is a little slower to fix.
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.100]  So again, just keep that in mind.
[50:20.900 --> 50:25.540]  Magnesium deficiency, really you're looking at it messes with the chlorophyll formation,
[50:25.540 --> 50:27.140]  which makes the leaves green.
[50:27.140 --> 50:31.140]  And when you see a low magnesium, and this is a bean plant, but cannabis exhibits the
[50:31.140 --> 50:36.420]  same kind of concept here, where you're seeing the main veins actually stay dark and green.
[50:36.420 --> 50:41.220]  It's the interveinal areas that will be the first to yellow out.
[50:41.220 --> 50:46.820]  So as a result, when you're seeing that kind of lighting of those leaves getting lighter,
[50:46.820 --> 50:52.020]  those turning yellow, but the veins are staying that dark green, that is an evidence usually
[50:52.020 --> 50:53.460]  of a magnesium deficiency.
[50:53.460 --> 50:54.740]  And that's going to be lower in the plant.
[50:54.740 --> 50:56.020]  You're going to see that first.
[50:56.020 --> 51:00.100]  And literally Epsom salts can be a way to go through and correct that issue.
[51:01.140 --> 51:05.860]  Sulfur deficiency, it was hard for me to get a good picture because it is basically just
[51:05.860 --> 51:08.420]  a yellow overall yellowing of the plant.
[51:09.300 --> 51:15.380]  It's kind of that just whatever correct green your plant should be, it's a couple shades
[51:15.380 --> 51:15.780]  lighter.
[51:16.500 --> 51:21.220]  So again, that dark green coloration might vary between on what plant you're particularly
[51:21.220 --> 51:21.620]  growing.
[51:21.620 --> 51:24.340]  So get to know what you're growing scores first.
[51:24.340 --> 51:28.900]  But when it's not quite the right coloration, it's a little lighter, it's a little yellow,
[51:28.900 --> 51:31.060]  but kind of overall yellow.
[51:31.700 --> 51:34.580]  If it's lower in the plant or up in the plant, that's going to be something else.
[51:34.580 --> 51:36.500]  Just that overall plant is not quite right.
[51:37.220 --> 51:42.740]  Avoid sulfur fertilizers, even though you see here a sulfur deficiency, because you're
[51:42.740 --> 51:47.380]  adding basically an elemental sulfur that's going to really drop your pH.
[51:47.380 --> 51:50.020]  It's a very acidic product.
[51:50.020 --> 51:53.780]  And that's really going to make that pH really low and cause all sorts of other issues.
[51:54.340 --> 51:58.020]  Epsom salts, again, another great product to basically correct this issue.
[51:58.900 --> 52:01.620]  Copper, I will be the first to tell you it's not very common.
[52:01.620 --> 52:04.660]  So don't always think that you see a little leaf curl, immediately it's copper and you
[52:04.660 --> 52:06.180]  got to go fertilize with copper.
[52:06.180 --> 52:09.380]  Sometimes just a leaf curl can be just a watering issue.
[52:10.260 --> 52:11.540]  So keep that in mind.
[52:11.540 --> 52:15.940]  But if it's the leaves right near the bud, that might be a little bit more of an indication
[52:15.940 --> 52:17.380]  it could be a copper deficiency.
[52:18.020 --> 52:23.300]  Copper sulfate, our chelated copper products are also important because copper is another
[52:23.300 --> 52:27.700]  one that's a little bit harder to kind of go through and get into the plant there to
[52:27.700 --> 52:29.540]  correct that deficiency.
[52:29.540 --> 52:33.860]  Growers always freak out about this one because it is kind of so close to the actual bud formation
[52:33.860 --> 52:34.980]  and bud development.
[52:34.980 --> 52:36.740]  So I want to make sure that they're not copper deficient.
[52:36.740 --> 52:40.420]  But I remind you, this is a minor nutrient and micronutrient.
[52:40.420 --> 52:42.580]  So it's needed in very small amounts.
[52:43.700 --> 52:44.900]  Iron deficiency.
[52:44.900 --> 52:48.660]  This is a yellowation of the very top portion of the plant.
[52:48.660 --> 52:51.460]  And this is again, messes up with the chlorophyll production.
[52:51.460 --> 52:53.700]  Those upper leaves really start to turn yellow.
[52:53.700 --> 52:57.300]  Remember, if those lower leaves are turning yellow, that's a nitrogen deficiency.
[52:57.940 --> 53:01.380]  If these upper leaves are turning yellow, it's an iron deficiency.
[53:01.380 --> 53:06.020]  And this is where if you want to monitor your pH, but if you have high phosphorus, this
[53:06.020 --> 53:08.580]  can negatively impact iron's availability.
[53:08.580 --> 53:12.900]  So this is where we talked about one nutrient bumping another nutrient or causing a secondary
[53:12.900 --> 53:13.140]  issue.
[53:13.780 --> 53:14.900]  Prime example.
[53:14.900 --> 53:20.740]  If you do notice an iron deficiency, chelated forms of iron are definitely advised because
[53:20.740 --> 53:23.940]  it is a little difficult to get a plant to pick up iron.
[53:23.940 --> 53:28.100]  You could take iron nails and put iron filings in the soil and really bring up your iron,
[53:28.100 --> 53:29.940]  but that's not plant available.
[53:29.940 --> 53:33.460]  So as a result, you need something that the plant can kind of uptake a little bit more
[53:33.460 --> 53:35.620]  to correct potential issues you're seeing.
[53:36.740 --> 53:41.140]  Now, I mentioned manganese is different than magnesium, and there's a little different
[53:41.940 --> 53:43.140]  on the yellowing here.
[53:43.140 --> 53:44.980]  This will occur kind of lower in the leaves.
[53:46.900 --> 53:49.620]  Deficiency does have some resemblance of an iron deficiency.
[53:50.340 --> 53:54.420]  Intervenal chlorosis of those newer leaves that you're kind of seeing there.
[53:54.420 --> 54:00.340]  So you do have that yellowing of those leaves, but this is not like a sulfur is all over
[54:00.340 --> 54:05.060]  and iron is definitely at the top and iron and nitrogen is definitely at the bottom.
[54:05.060 --> 54:10.260]  This is kind of that you're noticing a couple leaves kind of getting into more of that chlorosis
[54:10.260 --> 54:12.340]  or that yellowing more so.
[54:12.340 --> 54:16.420]  I'm saying this book earlier, more so in those newer upper portion leaves, maybe not the
[54:16.420 --> 54:20.100]  newest growth, but more the top third, you would say of the plant.
[54:20.820 --> 54:23.060]  Manganese sulfate, great way to kind of correct that.
[54:23.060 --> 54:27.620]  If you're using a blended fertilizer, not sponsored by any company, but Age Old Grow,
[54:27.620 --> 54:32.180]  their Grow Blend, despite what their label says, I have tissue tested and confirmed this
[54:32.820 --> 54:36.420]  in plants that they do have elevated manganese levels.
[54:36.420 --> 54:37.700]  So that's just another example.
[54:37.700 --> 54:41.780]  If you're using a blended fertilizer, you might be able to forego some of these potential
[54:41.780 --> 54:45.300]  issues with some of the fertilizers you're choosing to utilize.
[54:46.900 --> 54:49.780]  Before I get to scientific articles, I'll stop there.
[54:49.780 --> 54:50.280]  Awesome.
[54:51.220 --> 54:51.780]  Thank you.
[54:52.340 --> 54:53.220]  Again, wonderful.
[54:53.220 --> 54:58.340]  And you answered a lot of my questions as you went through, which was always fun.
[54:59.700 --> 55:04.980]  You know, we just mentioned we were just covering some of those micronutrients, very small levels.
[55:06.500 --> 55:10.660]  Now, I know it's not an exact science of what's coming out of your tap water.
[55:11.380 --> 55:14.340]  You know, we did mention a little bit of chlorine, but sometimes there's
[55:14.340 --> 55:17.220]  calcium or iron in there.
[55:18.820 --> 55:24.180]  Is tap water sometimes a good supply for these, or are they something that we typically need to
[55:24.740 --> 55:29.860]  at least add a little bit throughout the course of, say, a cannabis cycle?
[55:30.500 --> 55:36.340]  They usually do need to be added because cannabis, like a domino, very high demanding crop.
[55:36.900 --> 55:43.380]  So as a result, because it is such a heavy feeder, we cannot supply just a regular tap
[55:43.380 --> 55:49.460]  water enough to compensate for the plant uptake, I guess is the best way to put it.
[55:50.020 --> 55:53.620]  So while that can be great to know, and it's important to know,
[55:54.660 --> 55:58.420]  because maybe when you are going to add some more, you are going to be adding some,
[55:58.420 --> 56:01.140]  but you want to be adding it in a controlled manner.
[56:01.140 --> 56:02.500]  And maybe you don't have to add it as much.
[56:03.060 --> 56:08.260]  And this is where, you know, it's good to get advice from other people and, you know,
[56:08.260 --> 56:12.580]  have an idea of what they might utilize and what they might use.
[56:12.580 --> 56:18.260]  But at the same time, we've got to be careful because you could have the issue where they may
[56:18.260 --> 56:23.460]  have some higher calcium in their water, you may have less calcium, and that can cause, you know,
[56:23.460 --> 56:25.060]  someone to think that they're lying to you.
[56:25.060 --> 56:27.700]  Like, oh, they said they weren't adding this, and I tried that, and it didn't work for me,
[56:27.700 --> 56:29.220]  and I'm growing the same substrate they did.
[56:30.020 --> 56:34.660]  That's just kind of another example there of dialing in specifically and understanding
[56:34.660 --> 56:35.460]  kind of what you're doing.
[56:36.020 --> 56:36.980]  Yeah, good point.
[56:36.980 --> 56:41.940]  You know, so a lot of times you can contact your, you know, water municipality and get a
[56:42.660 --> 56:45.860]  report on, you know, the PPMs of a lot of these things.
[56:45.860 --> 56:51.700]  Granted, you know, if they change from one well to the other mid-season, it might be off.
[56:51.700 --> 56:54.340]  There will always be a natural fluctuation to that.
[56:54.340 --> 56:59.140]  But yeah, again, I love what you're mentioning because same substrate, different side of the
[56:59.140 --> 57:01.540]  country, one's on well, one's on city water.
[57:02.100 --> 57:03.940]  You're probably going to get different results.
[57:03.940 --> 57:08.660]  And at least speaking locally, I've called up my, you know, water supplier because I am on a
[57:08.660 --> 57:13.940]  municipality, and they, I just happened to catch it on the day, they could tell me what the
[57:13.940 --> 57:20.420]  readings they got at, you know, that morning at the closest hydrant that they have.
[57:20.420 --> 57:23.460]  They do it at least once a week, seven to ten days.
[57:23.460 --> 57:27.300]  And I happened to catch it on the day that they tested that one, and they're always willing to
[57:27.300 --> 57:28.340]  share that information.
[57:28.340 --> 57:30.180]  And I think once a year they have to publish something.
[57:30.180 --> 57:32.100]  I've got the little, you know, card there.
[57:32.660 --> 57:34.820]  It's good to, you know, as close as you can.
[57:34.820 --> 57:39.220]  They have three different ones in the town that I was growing in.
[57:39.220 --> 57:43.140]  And, you know, I could tell them where I was, and they told me what the closest one was,
[57:43.140 --> 57:44.500]  and they gave me that information.
[57:44.500 --> 57:45.460]  So it's just good to know.
[57:45.460 --> 57:47.380]  And just to test your water, just to know what you're dealing with.
[57:47.380 --> 57:51.060]  As you mentioned, the calcium, you know, in the water, you could have hard water, your pH could
[57:51.060 --> 57:53.460]  be really low, your pH could be really high.
[57:53.460 --> 57:55.780]  That's also going to impact things as well.
[57:55.780 --> 57:57.140]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Absolutely.
[57:57.780 --> 57:59.380]  And you mentioned Epsom salt too.
[57:59.940 --> 58:03.220]  Magnesium deficiency is something I dealt with in the past.
[58:04.180 --> 58:09.620]  I did like a little bit of Epsom salt that delivers a good dose of that as well as sulfur
[58:10.740 --> 58:12.420]  and a few other things here.
[58:13.540 --> 58:18.740]  I've heard anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon per gallon.
[58:19.620 --> 58:22.580]  Is that something that is going to be plant-specific?
[58:22.580 --> 58:27.060]  Or did you have a recommendation for maybe cannabis on a dilution ratio?
[58:27.060 --> 58:30.580]  Dr. Aaron Levine So I would say if you're noticing a deficiency,
[58:30.580 --> 58:34.740]  you want to go as high as possible, at least for the first couple of treatments and then
[58:34.740 --> 58:35.620]  cut it back down.
[58:36.420 --> 58:41.700]  I've used as high as two tablespoons per gallon on a drench.
[58:42.340 --> 58:44.340]  And you can do what I would do in that case.
[58:44.340 --> 58:48.420]  If you saw a deficiency, I would add two tablespoons per gallon as a root zone drench.
[58:49.060 --> 58:52.100]  And then one tablespoon per gallon sprayed on the leaves.
[58:52.660 --> 58:56.500]  I'm not a big fan overall of foliar feeding in general.
[58:56.500 --> 59:00.260]  But when you are having a deficiency or an issue, the reason why I would foliar
[59:00.500 --> 59:05.300]  at that point is I want to add material to the plant and to the roots and hope that they're
[59:05.300 --> 59:07.220]  going to meet right in the middle.
[59:08.260 --> 59:12.980]  And then when you see or you don't have the deficiency showing up anymore, I would still
[59:12.980 --> 59:17.220]  add some to my regular fertilizer program, but I wouldn't be drenching at that levels or that
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.460]  or nearly as frequent, shall we say.
[59:19.460 --> 59:24.020]  So keep that in mind as well that when you see the deficiency, that means you are definitely
[59:24.020 --> 59:25.460]  below plant levels.
[59:25.460 --> 59:27.780]  So you want to go through and kind of over add a little bit.
[59:27.780 --> 59:31.220]  And Epsom salt is great because you can over add it without having a lot of other issues
[59:31.220 --> 59:32.660]  or burning issues.
[59:32.660 --> 59:34.340]  It dissolves really well in water.
[59:34.340 --> 59:37.620]  I made some concentrated solutions up for like a fertilizer injector.
[59:37.620 --> 59:41.220]  It's amazing how much that water can hold for it.
[59:41.220 --> 59:44.820]  Of course, your PPMs go skyrocket over.
[59:44.820 --> 59:49.460]  All the readings go way over, but it dissolves really well in water.
[59:49.460 --> 59:52.180]  You can go down to a local store and get it.
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.740]  You don't need a feed supply or a fertilizer store.
[59:55.380 --> 59:57.060]  Just get the ones that aren't scented.
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.340]  I'm going to get the ones that have peppermint scent or anything else because I don't want
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:00.820]  anything else.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.020]  I just want that plain, regular foot bath.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.620]  Epsom salts will work just fine.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:07.860]  Awesome.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.460]  Let's see here.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:14.900]  Oh, and then some of the deficiencies too, same look, different level of the plant.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.940]  That's why mobile versus immobile was so important to know.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.980]  The diagnosing is tough, man.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.660]  I got frustrated answering the question.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.620]  My leaves are yellow.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.580]  I always get that question.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.660]  I just sent them like, I have a video that tells you, are they yellow up here or down
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:28.900]  here?
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.260]  Or is it intervening?
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.460]  I need more than that.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.060]  Yes, absolutely, man.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:37.540]  As a person who's been on many, many forums and helped out there, yeah, there's definitely
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.740]  a checklist we go through when we hear that.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.700]  My leaves are yellow.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.200]  Why?
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.640]  Okay.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.220]  But hey, again, that's why we do these things.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.740]  That's why we're out here to educate.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.540]  It's one of those things.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.020]  I'm sure I ask questions of more experienced growers where they're like, okay.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.260]  It happens.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.380]  We approach it with a grain of salt.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.080]  Okay.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.980]  I'll stop with the bad puns here.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.340]  We'll get back to the stream.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.660]  Again, I appreciate your time.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.820]  I had asked for an hour of time.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.900]  You so graciously volunteered it.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.300]  We're at that hour right now, but we've got one more subject to cover.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.140]  Is that all right if we go ahead?
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.100]  I re-uploaded the...
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.980]  I took the background out, so I re-uploaded that.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.340]  We should be good to go here, but I think this is an important section, so I want to
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.700]  stay on and definitely get to this.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:30.900]  Suggestions for how to research topics for if you're unfamiliar with what resources you
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.380]  may have available to you or just general practices.
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:39.540]  I just toss this in there because I think this is what a lot of growers talk about,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.620]  or I hear people talk about, but they don't make this distinction, the difference between
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.260]  scientifically published research and really anecdotal information.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:54.660]  A true scientific study is really a systematic investigation, interpretation, and evaluation
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.540]  of data.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:02:02.180]  It can be done by one person, but most oftentimes it's done with a small group or a lab, if
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:02.580]  you will.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.300]  And that's relating to the reliability of the applications.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.620]  There's a lot of things that go into it.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:14.340]  It doesn't have to be all done in completely isolated, sterile conditions, but you have
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:14.820]  this...
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.700]  This is what that scientific research really means.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.780]  And again, just because it's done by one person doesn't necessarily mean it's not scientific
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.620]  research, but most of the time you're going to find a small group there.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.260]  Compared to anecdotal information, this is evidence collected in a casual, informal
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.780]  manner, relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.660]  This is someone who's...
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:41.460]  Say they're doing tests or trials, but not really approaching it in a way that is systematic
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.020]  and can be reproduced is the best way to put it.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.620]  So, N, in this case it doesn't mean nitrogen.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:50.660]  This case, N, a population size of one doesn't really support a pattern.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.180]  Someone's like, oh, I added this fertilizer and the plant grew twice as quick as it's
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.740]  ever grown.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.180]  Great.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.300]  That really doesn't tell us anything.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.980]  It might be onto something, so it's not something to say you're completely wrong.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.140]  There's just not enough information there.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.060]  Similar species can be used to draw some conclusions, as we talked about a little bit
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:12.260]  earlier, to potentially see unforeseen interactions and complications, which is why it's
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.060]  important to study the actual species.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.220]  Having said that, that doesn't mean all the chrysanthemum data done on lighting is all
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.140]  garbage and doesn't apply at all.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.900]  Very similar to cannabis plants in that regards, but not exactly the same, but a good way to
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:32.260]  get around some of the legalities and studies in that regards that give us some good basis
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.500]  to go from that then we can then build on.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.820]  So that scientific study usually requires a control, so there's that comparison.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:45.220]  There are very set, stringent parameters that are set in place.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.660]  They're only varying that one variable that they're actually testing.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:53.540]  The procedure is conducted, well-documented, and easily repeatable as well.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.420]  It's not just something that, yeah, it's growing in a four by four tent.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.180]  All right, well, what was the humidity?
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.780]  What was the, where were you growing?
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.660]  We're growing in Colorado.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.340]  We're growing in Florida.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.180]  Very different areas there.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.780]  So you're going to have that sense that's repeatable and well-documented.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.580]  The anecdotal study, only focus on what changes, doesn't really ensure other parameters are kept
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:18.740]  consistent, common performed on small population size, typically hard to recreate test conditions.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.380]  Even growing in an indoor tent, I got control over everything.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.300]  Well, how often are they running their lighting?
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.020]  What type of lighting?
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.380]  How old were the bulbs?
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.380]  Things of that nature.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:33.380]  So it is making that distinction in maybe utilizing anecdotal study or someone that
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.420]  has great success and applying it to scientific research.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.700]  And that's how you go about that.
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.180]  And that's really, how do you search for scientific articles?
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.860]  How do you really, how do you go about that?
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.900]  For the most people, really Google Scholar is user-friendly.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.260]  It's a great search engine.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:50.820]  It's free.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:56.580]  Go to Google and type in Google Scholar and it will bring you to another subset page.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.020]  This is probably the best way.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.380]  I like it because it's user-friendly.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.500]  It's a great way to really be able to search anything.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.340]  And now we're talking, we're not just talking about cannabis.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:05.780]  I'm not just talking about plants.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.620]  I'm talking about really anything, like anything you'd come up with.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:14.340]  You hear a news story about, you know, coffee related to cancer or something.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.940]  You can search that up.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.140]  You can search animals.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.180]  You can search humans.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.620]  You can search cancer research.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:20.580]  You can search plants.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:26.260]  You can search literally anything and approach it from a scientific standpoint.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:31.140]  If you're going to enter universities, I do teach at the University of Connecticut.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.180]  I always try to tell my students, because I don't think they realize it,
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:39.540]  that if you're going to a university, they have access to a lot of these publications
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.420]  that on Google Scholar, you might only get a section of.
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.500]  And I'll talk about the different sections you might have access to.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:49.860]  But if you're part of a university or in a lot of cases, if you're a member of the public
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.700]  and you go to the university library, sometimes you have to go physically on site,
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.020]  which might be a distance travel.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.900]  But if you can request sometimes an article, if you know the exact name that you find
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.620]  through Google Scholar, and they can potentially turn over the full document to you.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.940]  So that's another great resource that a lot of people may have
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.580]  that may not fully understand or realize it.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.380]  What I do want to break through is we do find that scientific article,
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:20.580]  they do have a systematic approach to how they present their article, so to speak.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.020]  And they always start with the title, which is good,
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.660]  because that helps to determine really if it's of interest to you.
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.420]  And I might want to read a little bit beyond just the title,
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.060]  because sometimes the titles get really long or cursory kind of worded.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.540]  But really tries to provide a complete description of the study,
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:37.140]  including the title of the species study, kinds of experiments performed,
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:40.740]  maybe a brief indication of the results, but there can be variabilities in the title.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.740]  Which typically you'll get with any article is the abstract.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.300]  And an abstract is a very succinct summary.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.740]  Purpose, it contains all the statements, the methods, the results,
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.180]  the conclusion of the study, and literally it's one paragraph.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.380]  And they're typically free, even if the article might be published very recently,
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.900]  hasn't come off copyright yet, but you might be able to get access to the abstract.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.900]  Then you might think, well, if it gives me the results, it gives me the conclusions,
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.420]  it kind of tells you what was done, well, what do I need anymore?
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.940]  Why don't I just read a paragraph?
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:15.780]  Because you really want to get into the details of that and the introduction of that,
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.900]  you know, that you won't have access to if it's a recent publication.
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.220]  It really contains the background information.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.580]  It really describes the theoretical background leading up to that study.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.100]  Why were they studying that in the first place?
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.340]  What hypothesis were they trying to test?
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:33.700]  It gives you that general, you know, as the name implies, introduction to that study.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.020]  And then the methods.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.260]  To me, this is a very important section that most people skip right over.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.980]  They read the introduction and they go right to the conclusion.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:46.660]  The methods are extremely important because it tells you how the author
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.660]  or authors perform their experiment.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.980]  If you read the methods and you go, I don't agree with what they did
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.420]  or what they did was flawed or wrong, don't read anymore.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.460]  Because the conclusions they draw from, in your opinion, right or not,
[01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.980]  based on those methods, if you don't agree with the methods,
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.140]  then you automatically don't agree with the conclusions.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.780]  But a lot of growers go right there to the conclusion
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.340]  and say this is what they found and we go right from there.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.260]  Reading those methods are very important.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.660]  They can get cursory, they can get very detailed
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.460]  because they are written for a different audience.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.660]  But if you read to them a couple times, it's going to take a couple readings, that's fine.
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.420]  It really is important.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.940]  Then I go to the results.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:27.140]  Once I check the introduction, I get the methods, then go results.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.620]  That contains the data collected in the experiment.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.820]  Much of the important information included in this section,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.900]  the tables, the graphs are included.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:38.260]  The reader can analyze the raw data, which is why I go to the results first.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.940]  Show me their data.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.700]  Let me see what they generated there.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.820]  And I can go from there to kind of make my own potential conclusions.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:47.540]  It is worthwhile and there's something called the discussion.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.500]  And that's basically the author interpreting the results that they have.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.300]  They describe what the work suggests.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:58.500]  Still a very important section, but keep in mind that the author's opinions can come in this section.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:03.700]  Again, not saying it's a bad thing, but definitely something that I like those results,
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.940]  that true kind of more unbiased approach.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.500]  When I go back to the results, that's a little bit more unbiased.
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.940]  The discussion can be a little bit more biased.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.660]  That's a very bad thing, but can be a little bit more biased there.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.860]  And then the best section, which is the longest section,
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.140]  at the very end, is a literature cited.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.820]  If there's something of interest to you, you can go back and look at their sources.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.100]  And you can go back to the original sources to see when did they get it right?
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.540]  Or am I really interested in those sources as well?
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:35.060]  And then as I say, you go down the rabbit hole and you're researching those sources
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.780]  and then their literature cited and their sources and their sources.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:43.140]  And you end up kind of hopefully learning a great deal about the topic that's of interest to you.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:45.700]  That's my last slide.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.060]  Fascinating.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:52.660]  And that the literature cited, that section is my personal rabbit hole.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:58.260]  That's where all of the facts stated in the paper that you just agreed with
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.660]  or didn't agree with were determined.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.260]  So yeah, that's the true rabbit hole right there.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.900]  You also mentioned being able to go to a university's library, which is great.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.580]  I found that extension office.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:20.580]  Extension offices are a huge resource, particularly for people who are gardening outside.
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:26.100]  Now, keep in mind that these schools and institutions are federally funded.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.420]  They don't want to hear you say the word cannabis.
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.380]  But if you say the word tomato, they're smart enough to know what you're talking about.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.780]  And usually eager to talk as well.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.820]  So yeah, extension offices.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:41.140]  And every state has one.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.660]  It's not all of the schools.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.420]  Every state has a dedicated.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.340]  I'm in Washington.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.620]  It's the WSU.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.340]  They're on the east side of the mountains.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.060]  I'm on the west.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.700]  But I also took courses at their extension office.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.420]  So they're great people.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.020]  Oregon, I believe it's OSU.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:03.300]  They do a lot of research out of the Oregon Agricultural Department that a lot of people
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:03.940]  can catch on.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.460]  And the reason why I kind of love that is it's almost kind of regional.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.700]  It fits to where I am.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:20.180]  Do you have some preferred schools or resource bases for possibly the east coast area?
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:26.340]  I was I'm unfortunate at UConn being very supportive of cannabis in general, which is
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.260]  something that's slowly coming online other places.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:38.020]  So they've been very much in support of kind of the whole education end of things.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.860]  They have some research out.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.780]  They got probably the most famous one.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:49.140]  They believe Jess Lubel is doing or published on feminized seeds and developing things like
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.020]  that, which I also kind of broke down to my channel there.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.660]  I would say as far as for anyone in the country for a good source to kind of look at.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.660]  Cornell has got some they've done some help field days.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.780]  Of course, COVID kind of messed a couple of things up there.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:08.900]  But even in the COVID era, they were able still able to publish some things there that
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.260]  often favor more the outdoor growing situation.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:18.260]  And then I always say, you know, going through and, you know, I try to stay on top of what
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.140]  I can.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.140]  So in Cornell, yes, sorry, Cornell is on New York based Finger Lakes, Great Lakes region.
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:29.860]  Going through and I try to keep tabs on some of the latest or most interesting information.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.500]  So there's my channel as well.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:38.500]  You kind of have the advantage of me going through more recently, taking some of these
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:43.220]  articles that are, you know, 10 pages long and really detailed and kind of giving you
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.740]  the growers.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.420]  What does this mean from a grower standpoint?
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:46.900]  OK, great.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.060]  They did the study of HPS and LED lighting, you know, OK, well, LED lighting is always
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.540]  better, you know, well, what's the difference there?
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.780]  And you can see here that, yep, I've got that potency of cannabis grown LED and HPS
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.260]  lighting.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:04.980]  I break down that article, but I always then link you on this to the original article as
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.300]  well.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:10.260]  So I try to simplify it a little bit more, but I don't want to hide information from
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:14.420]  you, but I don't want to make it an hour long discussion on one topic.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.180]  But right there in the description, as I was pointing out there, that's the link right
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:18.500]  there.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.340]  It's in the slides, it's in the description.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.380]  So you've got access to all of that.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.220]  But if you just kind of want that quick, is this of any interest to me or how does this
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.340]  apply to me as a grower?
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:34.500]  You have that, hopefully that in that case, that six minute and 46 second video to kind
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500]  of break that down right there.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.020]  And as just a little scroll through the channel, you know, see, I try to keep most of my
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.220]  videos, I say most under seven minutes.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.820]  There's going to be a couple of long ones there.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.980]  I took one where I went through a soil lab, you know, for anyone growing anything, you
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:54.500]  know, you send your little soil off in a bag and it comes back with, you know, numbers.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.780]  But where does that soil go?
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:00.660]  I went to a university lab and spent the day there and, you know, saw every single
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.100]  process that that soil has to go through and edited down.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:09.380]  It was, it ended up being a 30 minute video, but it kind of walks you through that process
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:13.860]  that soil goes through that you're able to see and kind of appreciate for one of my results
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.020]  yet.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:18.740]  Well, there's 14 steps and 15 pieces of equipment that are needed to go through to get to those
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.780]  results that look so easily printed out on a form.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.060]  Right.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.420]  Easily, they look at it.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.220]  It looks easy.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.700]  No, not as easy as sometimes.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.500]  And so, yeah, everybody, that was a quick preview of his channel.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.660]  Again, it's the direct link is down in the show notes.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.940]  You could also search YouTube is Debaco University.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.180]  Definitely check it out.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.300]  I know you guys will love it.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:49.220]  I'm kind of a fan of the short format stuff too, because it's you can kind of digest it.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:53.140]  You can think about it, form a question and then watch it again.
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.860]  And you'll probably pick up the answer to your own question.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.540]  There's everything from beginning growers.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.900]  So I don't know if someone's maybe just starting out and like, you know, growing only a couple
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:01.300]  of plants.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.060]  I have that information as well.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:06.420]  But then I also have information for those more advanced growers that want to break down
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.380]  the scientific articles.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.100]  I don't think it's only scientific article based.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.740]  You can start with the real basics.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:16.420]  If you develop that question, as Chad said, as you're thinking about it, type it into
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.260]  the channel, see if there's another video on it.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.580]  I've got forensic science playlist and a biology playlist.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.020]  So just keep that in mind.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:29.460]  But I've got, I want to say 800 ish cannabis related videos or so with a couple more in
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.020]  the works.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.900]  I was at a yesterday, I think I had a farm going out and, you know, and trying to get
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.220]  some more content, trying to get some more information.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.900]  I'm also teaching classes.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.460]  Basically their final exams are coming due.
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.740]  So I'm kind of always bordering that as well.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.460]  But I'm trying to always get some sort of new content out there.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:52.340]  But hopefully there's a lot there for anyone to go through and search and get a really
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:58.020]  good start on improving their grow or hopefully avoiding some potential pitfalls and mistakes.
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.980]  Definitely there definitely is.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:05.380]  And again, it's that solid foundation that all growers should start with.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:11.380]  It's, you know, do yourself a favor, build the solid foundations because you will be
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:17.220]  surprised how and where they apply to complex situations later.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.180]  You have to understand the why behind the how.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.380]  So that's why I kind of went to school.
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.700]  Real quick though, we've got, again, I appreciate your time.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:33.540]  I've just got a couple questions here.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:42.580]  One question, okay, coming from Pyramidion, be sure to ask if there's a minimum amount
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.820]  of soil that's needed to grow in a living soil successfully.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:51.060]  And again, that's subjective because you could be talking about just like a water only
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.300]  or something that you top dress.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.500]  But I've heard people talk about typical sizes or maybe what is too small.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.820]  Do you have any opinions on that one?
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.700]  So when you say living soil, I forget what the quick quote is, but in a tablespoon of
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:10.180]  soil, you know, there's like five miles of mycelium that can be in there.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:15.060]  So as far as growing a plant, you know, when you're trying a living soil, you really want
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:19.620]  to have, you know, those buffer capacities in there, you know, just because you can grow
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:24.340]  a large plant in a four by four rockwool cube, you know, if you really maximize the soil,
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.940]  it's going to be a high stress environment.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:32.500]  I know most growers are favoring that five to seven gallon container for true living
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.220]  soil.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:37.060]  Now that a farm, they're doing some comparisons, they're an outdoor grow.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.340]  So I guess keep that in mind.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:44.740]  And they were showing that a 45 gallon container was growing much better than their 10 gallon
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.620]  containers.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:52.900]  So I think in that living soil container based, you think, oh, wow, 45, that seems quite large.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:58.420]  I think it's actually causing the root zone temperature to be kept cooler than a gallon
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:58.740]  pot.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:01.140]  I don't think it has anything to do with the microbes per se.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:04.580]  I think there's more to do with the environment going on there.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.980]  So you have to take that into consideration.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.660]  That's the substrate, it's the compost, it's the percentage of compost, it's the percentage
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:15.380]  of carbon in there, but also the volume and the temperature they might be exposed to.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:21.140]  Anything above 72 degrees Fahrenheit, you really want to be careful because your microbes
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.140]  kind of peak out around that temperature.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:27.060]  The top growth can handle more than that, of course, but those microbes that soil in
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.820]  a true soil environment, you probably want to run it a little bit cooler than you're
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.020]  thinking for the most part, at least what I find from growers.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:40.180]  And outdoors, something that helps if you're not in the ground, go with white pots instead
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.340]  of black pots, reflect the heat.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.900]  And another one here, and actually this Budden Lather was a guest a couple of weeks ago on
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:57.140]  the show, wonderful soap maker, kind of a full spectrum cannabis and hemp infused soap.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.580]  I have them in my shower right now.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:03.140]  I wish I had them closer on the other side of the house, but he had some soaps that were
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.900]  very purple.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:10.820]  And his question here is the hemp infused soaps turn purple and pink just on the outside.
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.980]  The cannabis I infused was green.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:18.740]  So one, are the anthocyanins always present, even if not visible?
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.380]  And why is it only purple on the outside?
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.060]  So what I would say, I don't know how many of these soaps you may have.
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:30.420]  My guessing, if you took that bar of soap and cut it down the middle, you'd get purple
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:35.780]  all the way throughout because what's probably happening is there is, it's called oxidation.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.180]  It's basically reacting with the oxygen in the environment.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.900]  So your outside will turn purple where you're inside that, not in a bad way, it's anaerobic
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:47.700]  per se, you're not getting the oxygen diffusion and therefore it's not turning purple.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.220]  So if you took that bar of soap where it's all purple on the outside and cut it in half
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:56.260]  and then look at the sides, gave them in time, I bet you they would also turn purple because
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.180]  it's that reaction with the outside oxygen or the outside environment.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.660]  That's probably occurring based on that description.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.300]  That clicks in my head.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.460]  That makes sense.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:08.900]  So thank you for that.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:09.780]  I bet that is.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.100]  And I will go after we're done here.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.540]  I'll go crack one of those open.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:16.900]  We had one more.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:18.740]  Let's see.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:23.140]  And his original question before his phone died there, it was about what did you mean
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.540]  by salt content?
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:32.020]  He's asking what about the salt content in potassium sulfate versus potassium chloride?
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.940]  Why is the chloride more salty?
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.220]  Is it because of a higher effect on the EC?
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:42.020]  So all nutrients are salts is some way to think about it.
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:47.780]  So I don't think it's always just sodium chloride, but because it's a potassium chloride in the
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:52.740]  60% potassium, it's more potent potassium, you're getting more of that chloride.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:59.220]  You're getting about 10% greater salt content with that fertilizer as a carrier compared
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.780]  to the sulfate of potassium.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.780]  Now that's only 50% potassium.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.140]  So when you're talking a small grow, doesn't really make much of a difference.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.900]  Probably go with the sulfate potassium.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.180]  We're talking a large scale grow and I'm talking acres and acres.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.620]  What you've got to buy tons and tons of fertilizer and then go apply them.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:20.420]  They will usually apt for the potassium chloride because they're getting more potassium per
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.940]  pound and their trucks can only hold so much there.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.260]  So when I say that saltier, yes, that's going to impact the ECs.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.740]  That's going to impact the parts per million.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.140]  That's going to impact potentially soil properties if you way over apply, but usually on that
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.820]  size of scale operation, you're not.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:42.020]  But it's important to realize that you have two very potent potassium fertilizers, but
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.220]  very different potential reactions on there.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:49.780]  So if we're talking about the previous comment or two comments ago about that living soil,
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.340]  adding a lot of salts, you might have to do a little bit more flushing with that in a
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:54.840]  container.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.020]  As a side note that they do look very different.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:06.100]  The potassium sulfate of potassium is a tannish brown coloration and potassium chloride is
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.780]  a red color.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.380]  So they make them very distinctive.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:15.620]  If you were ever wondering which one would go with which, you do make it pretty distinctive
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:20.020]  in that sense from a fertilizer standpoint so that you ensure you're applying quote the
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.520]  right one.
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:23.620]  Yeah, that'd be a bad day in the office.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:25.620]  Yeah.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.180]  Yep.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.620]  And I've had to know you go through and you buy it when I buy it by potassium, by the
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.580]  bulk, by the ton.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.780]  And sometimes you get a check to make sure it's the right potassium because they rightfully
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.460]  so they want to sell you more potassium.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:40.180]  Like this is 60%, not 50% potassium.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.140]  But I'm like, no, I want the less salt to me that's of greater importance than the higher
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.580]  percentage of potassium.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.860]  So little things like that.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:49.700]  Cool.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.540]  This has been really fun, Matt.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.180]  I appreciate your time infinitely.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.220]  I would love to, in the future, keep going.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:02.420]  I've got more questions I'd love to cover, but thank you.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.180]  By all means, reach out.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.500]  We can definitely schedule another meeting.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.500]  I can get some feedbacks here.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.860]  It seems like it's been pretty positive.
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.140]  Has been kind of glancing over a little bit in the chat there.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.780]  So if you've got another list of questions, I'm always welcome to come on again.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:19.220]  After scrolling through the page, you want some more details about one of the topics
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.980]  I've discussed or haven't discussed.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:22.260]  By all means, let me know that as well.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.340]  And I'll bring up your YouTube page here one more time for everybody.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:33.620]  And yeah, everybody in chat has been very supportive of this.
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:42.580]  Again, I knew you'd be a wonderful guest because I love your delivery and the information
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.540]  that you offer.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.620]  So it's been recognized and appreciated through chat.
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:51.780]  So everybody, again, I'm just scrolling through his YouTube page.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.660]  You can find the direct link in our show notes.
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:57.780]  Do yourself a favor, have some fun.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.420]  Spend a little bit of time over here.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:01.780]  Learn something.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.580]  Appreciate you.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:06.500]  If you have a question, I try to get back to the questions every so often.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.740]  It can't be immediate response.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.540]  If you have a plant problem, I can't immediately help you out there.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:16.180]  But I do try to go through and respond to the comments as much as I can with everything
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:16.980]  else I've got going on.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:23.060]  But I try to give you something back if you do post a comment in any of the videos that
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:23.700]  I have there.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.140]  Awesome.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.220]  We'll just go out here with a couple words of encouragement.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:29.780]  Thank you.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.140]  Going to watch it again.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.660]  Thank you, Professor DeBacco.
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.700]  Excellent guest.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:34.420]  I love it.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.540]  I'd like to take full credit for the quality of this show.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.260]  Yes.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:38.980]  You got none.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:46.180]  They have this great opportunity to be able to convey and share on a live format some
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:46.900]  of the education.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:52.580]  It's always great to see the appreciation for the wanting to understand and learn about.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.460]  I'm always learning too.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.820]  It's always great to see and get feedback from other people.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.500]  It's always great as well.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:00.020]  Cool.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:00.580]  All right.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:03.460]  Well, with that, I will let you get back to your weekend.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.180]  It's been an hour and a half of good times.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:08.500]  Everybody in chat.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.940]  Thank you for hanging out today.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.180]  Everybody watching on the replay.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.700]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.580]  We will catch you next time.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.780]  Take care, everyone.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:22.420]  See you later.
