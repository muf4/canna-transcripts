It is Wednesday.
Happy Wednesday to you guys.
I got another, in my opinion, a legend.
These individuals are legends within the community.
And I think a lot more of our audience needs to understand that.
All of a sudden, everybody's got their courses and their things and stuff.
But at one point, the community as a whole, as a circle, was educating each other.
Nobody was charging each other outrageous fees.
And there was a lot of success, I felt like, in those early years.
A lot of that comes from Mr. Berger and Tamara.
The brains on these two individuals are through the roof.
And I think a lot of the community knows that.
Before when we were putting up the flyer and everything, when I was reaching out to you
A lot of people were being thankful towards me because they've learned from you guys even
two years ago when we first reached out to you.
You guys have been on the show multiple times.
We try not to do that as best we can.
But then the ones that are repeated on the show, I hope that our audience sees there's
a reason for that.
And you guys are our next level.
You guys are living in, breathing, the kind of stuff that I think a lot of people wish
that they had, the properties and stuff, and the ups and downs of really living that lifestyle.
I'd say, truth be told, sometimes can be a real nightmare behind the scenes.
And you kind of just got to put on a brave face and keep moving forward.
So a lot of this stuff, I think, is going to hit home today for a lot of farmers so
that you guys can see that.
As far as I know, Joey and Tamara, you guys have been doing this as long as I've known
about cannabis.
So we'll get into a lot of questions.
Marco had some stuff that he has to do for his real job, I guess you could say.
So he'll be popping on here momentarily.
And then, of course, shout out to London, teaching us how to kind of take this to the
next level with the intros and outros and teaching me more about what we need to do
for the flyers.
So just appreciate everything that's been happening with the show, man.
It's been taking off.
I feel like we're hitting our stride here.
And I just want to thank you again, London, for taking it to the next level, buddy.
Thank you.
It's always fun.
And I like kind of being the...
I do my own shows, the Dang Cow and Cannabis for Breakfast and help with a few other ones.
So I like being the guy in the background.
But every opportunity I have to jump up with you and such amazing other humus beings like
Joey and Tamara, I got to take the opportunity to do so.
So I mean, you might see me running around in the background.
There's a little baby and we're like in my kitchen.
I would usually be in my farm filming from, but unfortunately, we're packing up to move.
So that's how that goes.
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun.
I've always really enjoyed what you guys do and what you represent and both regeneratively
for Joey and Tamara as well as Brian.
And Marco, who isn't here.
Yeah, he'll be here shortly for everybody I'm sure that's wanting to know.
So the audience is continuing to grow thanks to Peter and the platform, a variety of people
on the show.
The Future Cannabis Project just seems like it's doubled in size since I started and things
are really taking off.
More and more people are watching a variety of shows, which is really what Peter was talking
about.
The end goal being that there's the ESPN of cannabis and then the ESPN2 of cannabis so
that you could pick and choose which shows you wanted to watch.
Since that timeframe, a lot of our audience is now actually starting to put in the work.
And so I wanted to kind of start there with you guys, if we could briefly again, talk
about your background for those that don't know, and then get into the nitty gritty because
to be honest, man, that's what people love picking your brain.
And I think that's why your classes and the things that you guys have been putting on
throughout the years, not just recently.
I've really taken off and a lot of people respect that because it seems like you guys
put in the time and effort that really makes something special for those days, not where
it just feels like this kind of like diploma mill or research mill where you kind of go
in, you go through days and that's not a shot at anybody or anything.
I'm just saying that there's a lot of that stuff out there and it's not necessarily one
person's good or one person's bad.
It's just I don't want to know.
I don't want individuals to spend a lot of money on regurgitated information.
It seems like that that's kind of what happening, what is happening in our community right
now. So I will be the first one to kind of police that or at least try to police that as
best we can. So being authentic, we got two of them here.
Joey and Tamar, will you please kind of introduce yourselves and then we'll get into it.
Yeah, well, thanks for having us, you guys.
Always a pleasure, Brian.
You and Marco are always pushing, pushing the movement forward, putting tons of killer
info out there.
You as well, London.
And of course, we've got to give a big shout out to Peter and Future Cannabis Project.
It's turned into such an incredible wealth of knowledge.
I dig deep into it all constantly and I'm just blown away at the content that's there.
So we're honored to get to contribute little bits here and there when we can.
Yeah.
We've had you guys on several times, you know, sometimes with clothes on, sometimes with
clothes off, you know, we never know kind of where we're going to be with you guys.
So today we're inside.
We got our shirts on.
We want to kind of get into the nitty gritty of farming at a commercial level.
So I was wondering if you guys could kind of I know we've talked about that before, but
briefly kind of state you guys have talked about thinking about, you know, the trees
aspect, like really.
Thinking like chess moves with your property is kind of the way that I remember kind of
summing up last time when we spoke, it seemed like you guys were really always thinking
a couple moves ahead so that if and when things do occur, you're able to move and pivot
and find a way to, you know, find your way out of certain aspects that come with
farm.
Well, I know the last time we were on your show, we were sitting out in the garden and
we had just got our Starlink Internet and it wasn't quite working and we were getting
dropped constantly.
And I'm sure that was a rough show for people to watch.
So we made sure we're in the house.
We're near the Internet.
We're not fucking around today.
Why don't you talk a little bit about this property, this farm, your history a little
bit.
Let's see, this property that we're on right now, I've had a house for about eight
years and of course, had my cannabis gardens on it.
And then after legalization, I had to move the kind of this gardens, which then ended
up, we just kept the garden where it was and ended up making it into a vegetable garden
now that we call the Goddess Garden, which is a my attempt at like our family's
first food forest, which is doing really well.
And we also had a lighted up greenhouse on the property.
We have now recently taken apart the lighted up greenhouse and it's now our event
workshop area, which I really love.
Area where we can all gather and have events.
And let's see.
And then we have the Fay Garden that we're still working on.
And that spot just happened to have a tremendous amount of serpentine and serpentine is a
rock that can kill roots.
It stunts growth and it also depletes the soil of calcium.
So the area I had to move my garden to was just filled with it.
And I found that it was a really good place to have my cannabis garden.
And so from that now, we've now taken out a lot of the serpentine and I've back filled
and made cubicultures.
So as we had to expand the roads for the licensing to, we are able to use those trees and
put into the trenches that we dug down six feet deep.
And we did that so we can remove some of the serpentine, but also the rock that we
had to move the garden to.
And so like a lot of water comes down.
So what that does is as we're building these deep trenches, the water comes down and
then it sinks and then it slows it down and then it sinks in there and we're able to
raise our aquifers.
And so that is another benefit to those gardens.
So yeah, this is the garden.
And I'm going to show you a little bit of the garden.
So this is the garden that we're going to be using.
So yeah, this is kind of what we're in right now.
We're in transition.
We've been in transition with everyone coming out here this last year.
We have Noble and Sierra from Emerald Virginia Farms joining us.
Joey joined us and we're all just working it out.
How do we all fit together where our places are.
And on the farm right now, we have three different gardens.
And we have a lot of cacti because Noble's gotten a lot into cacti farming.
and what we're doing this next year is really working towards our getting our
hemp and our Centropic garden in where that bay is and our animals all of our
animals were killed this last year by a mountain lion that came in and like
literally tore our coop apart and so we're redoing that all and that's the
next couple months that we're gonna be posting about is our bunnies and our
chickens and how do we you know how do we approach these pieces of land a
different piece of land or different project and I know we've talked about
about permaculture before but permaculture is really the foundation
that Tamara and I start with you know permaculture is a design system founded
by a couple Australians Bill Mollison and his student David Holmgren and I was
running around before this show I'm like what are we gonna do I was like so
that's like grabbing piles of books I was like I'll just grab this pile of
books just talk about some of these books but here's the Bill Mollison's
permaculture designers manual this is a big book right here with all this
permaculture in it and permaculture is really a design system a system of
ethics and principles and and so we use these ethics and principles when we
approach any project any piece of land any business any new proposal events
even it just makes life simpler these these principles are based on the on the
on the philosophy that nature knows best and when we mimic those those systems we
can create these really resilient systems that are that are hard to beat
they're as efficient as it comes and so a lot of these principles I know we've
talked about this before but this is what everything comes back to for us
this is where that natural farming falls under this to Dom K&F biodynamics they're
all they're all about these same types of principles things like creating no
waste using our available on-site resources
you know finding slow solutions you know these are these are in the rest of the
world they just call this common sense it's only here that these developed
Western countries that we have this kind of this kind of luxury that we can
create systems that are so wasteful and make no sense in those regards so we
love those permaculture principles I'd encourage anybody that's interested in
farming and getting land learn about permaculture because you know I was
fortunate to discover it in the in the mid 90s and take my first permaculture
design course in 98 and Tamara first studied it when she first came to
California it had a big influence on her and what she looked for when when she
got this property and it'll really open open your eyes and give you some
direction when you're approaching a piece of property or even thinking about
that or it'll help you assimilate a lot more this information so then when yeah
like I said when KNF came into our lives around 2016 and Jadam as well we said oh
this fits all the permaculture principles perfectly it's really all
about closed-loop farming and so to us all these things fit under that same
design system which really like we said it's just common sense this type of
farming this type of design and it makes it easy to go out on a new piece of
property and anyways this big book is the big the Bible you don't need this
we've got there's a skinnier book called introduction to permaculture that is a
really good place to start and I would encourage people to start there
I first got this place it's when you get a property they the best thing you can
do is if you're able to be on it for a full year and watch you know how the
rains come in you know how the weather reacts where your garden would be the
placement the Sun you know just being able to see all your animal trails
there's so much that you cannot see until you actually live in a place and
then you also have you know things that come in like you know the county coming
in and saying oh you can't have your garden here where that I had designed to
flow perfectly and it was running really efficiently on the land but I
can't have that here because there's a runoff Creek but you have to put it
right here and only right here and with those you know circumstances I still had
to take a back you know step back after that first year though okay this is not
working you know when you can go in and go this is what I'm gonna do because
this is my agenda it doesn't really work not always sometimes if you're lucky it
does but if you can plan beforehand and really observe observe the weather
patterns serve your water serve your son the wind patterns all of that it really
makes a huge difference it can save you like thousands and it just creates for a
more harmonious you know environment so look looking back like how would you
protect your your property you know beforehand we had talked about like the
planting plants trees that kind of thing but I mean I'm I'm more of a city
boy from from this aspect I've never come across a mountain lion you know
running around my property so how do you protect your property from that and are
there ways to think things through does fencing even work for something like
that it does and it's it's about positioning and what do you have dogs
like our dogs had passed on this year early on this year and then that's when
the mountain lions came came in because we didn't realize how much especially my
older little dog she kept everything's like at bay you know where all the human
areas are and all the animal areas are she kept everything just out off to the
sidelines but when she was gone they just came on and so what we're redoing
is relooking at it getting it closer into one into what you call your zone
one area that's where your animals are closest to you so you can easily access
them we're also putting them in a place that's right next to the garden so it's
easier to access their poop so it's going to be a nice actually a better a
more efficient place for putting them and it definitely you need to like a
look and observe where you're putting your animals what type of material you
use any kind of like the chicken mesh stuff is crap you go for wire and then
the gopher wire is what the mountain lion actually took out but it had been
you know eight summers you know through eight summers so that's another thing
this next time I'm gonna shade a little bit more so things don't get rusted out
by the Sun and you learn as you go along and farming but with the big animals
having dogs is a really important thing and that's why we have two new puppies
on the farm that are going to protect and then just location and we're looking
at alarms to something that's scare at the end you know the animal that comes
about so are they afraid of you know like in the hood man you hear like three
or four dogs barking you're not going to that house is that kind of that same
theory you have a couple dogs more than one dog barking not too many animals
want to mess with that
easy prey you know way easier than coming up on like they smell us anyways
you know so it's already scary to them to come into like the human area they're
already on alert so if there's some big barky animals then they usually aren't
coming unless they're extremely desperate yeah it's usually only late
summer they're really hungry there's not a lot of food sources around they're
gonna really get desperate they're most you know they're scared of us they're
much more scared of us than we are of them so they only come around there's
not a lot of options left now I had heard that you could also have like a
donkey or two and that they are actually pretty defensive is there any truth or
merit into that donkeys and llamas and alpacas is what and why I took my
permaculture they said to put in with your grazing animals that they do they
help with coyotes just to help with not lines like yeah they're they're
definitely good we unfortunately don't have grazing land over here we're on
mostly just rock and so we've had to build up our land and so for us bunnies
and chickens and ducks like these smaller animals were a lot better than
the grazing ones so I don't really want to put the donkeys out here I tried that
with horses and it was a lot of work to try to maintain them on this kind of
property so that was another one we kind of you learn as you go along I try to
take horses from a very grassy hill property into a rocky wood it was like
oh it's okay because I could create their feed doing a fodder system that
was a lot of work we just decided to get animals that actually work for this
environment and that's kind of where it is it's just like the whole permaculture
it's like you try to find the like half of least resistance and then you start
small and expand and that's one area that I have to work on in permaculture
because I like to start big and so I'm definitely still you know I have to take
it back to this principles a lot and nothing wrong with having big dreams I
definitely have made some mistakes trying to go too fast you trip you fall
over but at least you're running you know I think some people are always
walking in life and that's in my opinion just as bad as like if you never take
any risk you don't die with any scars like wolves you know I might have missed
out on some things as well so I think life is meant to be peaks and valleys
you know that way it stays interesting for you yeah the big thing with animals
I want to hammer home for people that I'm sure we talked about before and what
tomorrow's getting at is get animals that fit your context fit the context of
your land fit the context of this design that we're talking about we talk about
permaculture talk about a design for your property you know pick animals that
you're gonna have a food source for pick animals that can process your waste
streams and turn them into energy like maybe a pig maybe you're creating a lot
of food scraps you know maybe you have a big garden that you eat out of you know
you get a pig you can cycle all that waste through and create meat or create
manure and we're always looking to cycle this energy through as many systems as
possible before it leaves our property same with the chickens the chickens can
eat a lot of those food scraps you know the rabbits and we're trying to stack
functions with every element we place that means every animal is to serve
multiple purposes at least three you know so that pig it's gonna make manure
it's gonna make it's gonna till up new areas for us root around for us it's
gonna dispose of a bunch of our food waste it's gonna make food eventually
for us the chicken is an incredible example of that you know provide so many
things so the rabbits as well the rabbits is a great meat source luckily
our landmate noble has harvested rabbits before because that one's gonna be a
first for me but they produce so much and like there's a continuous supply of
meat with it in that right there can take care of us it can take care of our
animals you do lots of bone broth with it so we're excited for that as a meat
source and like you said we can feed the rabbits from the garden mainly and then
we're looking at have a couple areas that we might be able to throw some
gratings down to help with the grain supplementation they were just trying to
figure out ways you know that if we can't get off this property half of
would maintain everything still and so that's always like kind of like the goal
in mind is how does this place remain self-sufficient or how can it get
self-sufficient and that's like one of the biggest goals and in mind and it's
hard not to get the cute animals I really want those really cute Highland
cows okay yeah if I could for just a moment it first I love this the the
companion with animals and everything is in something that I've always loved and
intrigued I've never had the opportunity to be able to have enough space to be
able to do that luckily I'm changing that soon but I have a couple of things
that I just wanted to ask you and jump it is so the book you specifically spoke
of was that Bill Molison was the okay so I have the short version I can pop in
the chat here but we do say if you have the money to support people that write
in and build out these things please do but if you don't here's a link to the
introduction to permaculture then in the chat there to help you out and get that
going I think that's a super awesome valuable tool that you guys put forward
I always love having you reading and I'm gonna be picking up the big book and my
wife's gonna hate me as I have to carry that through a whole bunch of different
places the other question that I kind of wanted to ask was cake planning planting
with animals like so do you find your your your separate because you mentioned
the holistic ideas that you have your plants into the animals and they kind of
graze around and do whatever they want right they get what they need they feed
when they want to they get whether they get what bits that they have you
separate their feeding methodology like with these rabbits and chickens like are
you separating them out and second of all what are you what's what's your
desire desired tools for like giving them pens creating separate areas are
you growing you know like wicker to create little things like that or there
are there plants that we can plant you know in foresight that are great tools
to create and use with our animal pen or animal keeping well let me tell you
our current animal situation we are down to just pets right now like like Tamara
said we've had a lot she's had a lot of animals here horses and goats we're in
major fire country where she she's had to evacuate almost every year that she's
lived here sometimes multiple times which means evacuating those horses
evacuating those goats you back away to all those chickens and ducks and rats
and so it's a pain in the ass so she got rid of the horses two summers ago we got
rid of the goats this last year now we're down to animals that will fit in a
black and yellow tote that is the new rule if you don't fit in a black and
yellow you can't come on the farm we got to trade some rabbit recipes because
I've got I've got a list of recipes for hair that you will just love so yeah we
are and then like tomorrow said we were down to just chickens and a rooster last
summer and the mountain lion finished them off so we've had an animal this
winter a couple new puppies lots of snuggle time on the couch by the fire
but we're about to go into a new construction of a new animal area and it
kind of it kind of fits our flow like we're talking about permaculture but
it's different than where what your needs were on this property when the
current animals situation was built I mean yeah exactly that was that was
currently built when I had peacocks and so that was the house them originally so
yeah we're just redoing it all and we're rethinking about you know the rabbits
they they need a cooler area so how can we do it you dig down and put a piece of
concrete in there oh how can we do it you know like different ways to make
their environment flow and be easy for them and also we want to have like we
want it to be luxurious for them to have like a really nice life because they're
helping us so much so we're actually still like designing it and me and
kinder are having a lot of fun and nobles helping us along with that and so
we're still in that design phase like we're gonna start I believe at the end
of March with it but we're putting our chickens and our bunnies together and
and then we're also going to be building some chicken tractors to help us in the
Bay Garden along the the main aisles that we have that are still just rock
okay I we put six foot trenches in but in the walkways what we're going to do
is we're going to start building up fertility so one of the main ways we're
gonna do that is put our chicken tractor and our little bunnies out there and
yeah we are gonna plant some stuff beforehand like I've got some seeds
already going out there there's some grasses coming up and one of the things
we had played with before was putting grasses down in our chicken area or
chicken run area that were like rye and buckwheat and peas and just like
different seeds and plants that we knew that the chickens would eat like that
that's good for their nutrition and that's what we plan to do again with
like the bunnies and the chickens is kind of have pretty much their food is a
lot of our cover crops so it's just put throughout all the gardens and so it's
really easy to go and just do some nice chopping and go bring a giant load of
some kind of grasses and peas and legumes and things to the bunnies and
chickens and it's like a daily thing that we do when all that's happening and
the other big part of this design is we're moving this animal area right next
to this new garden this hemp garden that we're putting in so that we can do those
animal tractors and move them easily from the main pen into these tractors
and have everything really close this is also you know on our little walkway
to the gardens will pass by this area every day it's going to that's not going
to happen till April or May but starting on the 20th we're gonna actually going
to start our seeds in this same little coop greenhouse that we're talking about
putting the animal pen in so this is going to be our little nursery for the
next few months the next couple months until we transition over into animal pen
so once again just trying to make use out of multiple uses out of the same
space hey what up Marcos what's good how you doing
Joey wifey how y'all doing today sorry I'm late man busting up in the
conversation I know you talked about some good stuff we don't talk about
well they got a they had their animals killed by a mountain lion so last time
when we were talking more like you know building up your you moving your
chesspieces with trees and agriculture oh my things forward yeah now how do you
protect your animals they're thinking about it you know where the placement of
certain things that things that you can easily jump in and probably talk on
buddy with your piece of land as well well you have me at rabbits you know I
got my bunnies got four of them do y'all know VW ad I think y'all do that
says I says old IG yeah VW and he's a he's a natural farmer guy out here on
the East Coast I got my rabbits from him man and I just got him their meat
rabbits but you know I just saved them from being slaughtered cuz he was you
know it's gonna call them and there's like little fertilizer factories man
so much poop it's kind of ridiculous like so much I had two rabbits for a
little while at one point and before we got the rest and it took care of my
whole greenhouse my whole light depth greenhouse that was 24 by 48 feet and
it's usually going like it I couldn't believe it how many did you have how
many how many rabbits did you have I only had two at that point that supply
that greenhouse and yeah cuz I take it now I get so much especially in the
winter cuz you know you kind of pump up their beds with some straw or some
alfalfa to keep them warm so I get the that mixed with the poop now and I'll
just take that by the whirlbarrow load and just run around my property and just
pitchfork it around the trees and stuff man it's good stuff I mean you're it's
kind of amazing how much poop they made once I realized that like those two
bunnies were completely had me covered on that greenhouse like we're doing like
compost tea extracts for top dressing like it was a little much honestly and
could go into the goddess garden like it is real how much they're easy though
they're easy to take care of too like um I got four and just so for people to
know it for rabbits I get about a 50 pound bag of food every month and a half
for a 40 pound bag every month and a half so that's I mean think about that
cost me about 50 bucks or 40 bucks a month you know kind of feeding them at
the on the high end and I just found out today I've been feeding a little
heavy so it told me my rabbits were too fat so I'm feeding a little heavy but um
so you think about a man for rabbits cost you about 40 bucks a month you
couldn't buy that amount of quality fertilizer for you know for 40 bucks you
know what I mean it's just it just to me it's a no-brainer I love the rabbits
they're easy these ones I got their silver foxes that they can stay outside
in the cold so they don't need a lot of extra care yeah but to me man they're
really cool I'm actually gonna give them a little bit bigger of a pen because
they they kind of confined and I want them to be able to run a little bit more
so I'm gonna do kind of a little run for them I'm gonna try to do it to where I
can plan out a strip of grass and their own little run and then have their
cage kind of there see how it goes you know what I mean maybe they just out you
know they're too hard on the grass and it never really can sustain itself but
I'm gonna try
Brian you said little man passed away huh yeah man my my lion head rabbit
passed away we got him from the pound too so you know he might have he might
have had a rougher upbringing than the regular rabbits but I enjoy keeping just
you know I just had the one rabbit I I choose to get the lion heads because I
find them a little more intelligent I keep obviously keeping it indoors and I
have children and I've never had the the animal bite except one time when it was
scared in a corner when I was trying to pick her up after pick him up after a
fight that he had with a new bunny that I was trying to bring in that was the
only time that you know the bunny ever bit me or anything so I I think they're
a lot smarter than we give them credit for and I think if you're going for the
meats then necessarily you don't miss it doesn't the intelligence of the animal
doesn't necessarily matter especially if you're outdoors but if you're indoors in
my opinion you might want to think about that because I was putting up there that
all you know you can potty train them but I found that not every breed can be
potty trained so you got to really think that through you don't want it to smell
like pee downstairs in the basement.
Yeah valid valid point. Well I want to hear from Joey and Tamara so I'm gonna shut up and just let y'all run it out.
What y'all been up to man I know that y'all had a JADAM class that you are a
class that you're trying to do and it didn't work out what's been going on you
think people aren't really coming out to the events anymore are you seeing
anything or did y'all just have kind of an issue or what? Oh it's kind of hit or miss we
had a real good camp in December and that was a lot of fun camp heal thyself
that was that was a mix of mushroom day and regenerative farming day and a hash
day so that was that was a kind of real fun mix you know Tamara's been working
on her property here for eight years working towards making it a licensed
cannabis farm and and now we're having to shift gears and kind of move away
from that and work more towards making an event space so we really spent most
of the year putting in campsites and putting in parking lots and clearing
trails and like she mentioned emptying out her light-deck greenhouse and the
three big raised beds in it 40 feet long you know six feet wide and took all that
out and now that's our big classroom gathering space so if anyone needs LED
lights DM me. Yeah a bunch of nice LEDs out of that greenhouse so yeah and but
that we just tried to do too much we tried to pack in another event in
January and it was a tough time right before that was the holidays and trying
to get sponsors trying to get to pay for their booths was just impossible so we
had to pull the plug on that but we've been getting some fun stuff in we
did an LA trip where we got to give some talks down there and that was
actually really well received we weren't sure how that would go with the SoCal
crowd talking to people who were hearing about hugel culture for their first time
and hearing about regenerative cannabis for their very first time and you know
it's one of those things that once you learn about it there's no putting the
genie back in the bottle you don't want to ever go back to the dispensary and
and purchase you know chemically grown this mystery weed you just don't and you
want to get to know farmers so that was a lot of fun and really we went down
there not knowing what to expect tomorrow hadn't been down there in a
couple decades I was about the same and no clue yeah it was a really nice
welcoming we're really surprising actually we got down there and we didn't
even know if we were going to do the education part we're like should we do
it are they gonna be into it? Yeah we're all hanging out smoking and kicking it. Then I had a couple people come up and be like when's the talk?
When's the talk? And like asked me a few times I'm like okay let's do this and like we did it and I
had beautiful questions and it was really it was just really well received
and you know though it's just beautiful to see that down and you know even in
the midst of the city you know people are trying their best and wanting to live a
healthy life and wanting to grow good medicine and that was yeah it was
beautiful to just see that and witness it and hopefully we can come down there
and help them with some other grows or you know green up some areas. I like that approach you guys are doing man I think that's I think it's smart I mean you know
obviously you're still gonna grow for yourself and all that but I think you
guys man can touch just so many more people with the events you know what I
mean we like to say you guys are a power couple you know in this in this game
that we're in this natural farm and that's pretty awesome and so yeah man I'm
gonna get to one of your events trust me it just didn't work out man last year
but this year we're gonna do my best try to make it man because I want to meet
you guys in person and just absorb you know feel that energy from y'all you
know in person and I think that's key with the with the events man we're going
to up to the JADAM event in Maryland this Friday and Saturday you know it's
just I'm already kind of feeling that energy you know people been hitting me
up and and pretty excited about it so yeah teach is the key man I think that's
the way to go. Well you guys are all welcome out here for anything we do
absolutely you and Brian and London as well yeah we had the honor of getting
the call a couple weeks ago right we came back from LA to come and fill in at
the JADAM workshop out here for our friend Zelig of Spring Creek he wasn't
gonna be able to make it and we got the call to come in and teach alongside our
friend Preston Smith who was one of the organizers of the event and Preston has
done some teaching at our last couple regen camps that we hosted we got a lot
of love for Preston so we're honored to get to go there and you know young
saying Cho and JADAM has certainly been a big part of our cultivation and a big
part of our teachings we have so much respect for the Cho family and where
it's taken us in our journey and while we don't follow the JADAM system
strictly it's definitely some very important tools in our toolbox big time
on Sunday alongside Preston and it was pretty it was we were really happy happy
it happened because young saying did a great job and his daughter did a great
job translating and they do an awesome slideshow and it's a lot of really you
know they cover the whole system top all five inputs top to bottom and but a lot
of the Q&A there was a hundred people at this class and Sebastian Paul the Q&A a
lot of the questions and answer was being lost in translation a lot of
farmers using their local lingo a lot of people talking hill dialect a lot of
people who low talking in the back row like I was having a hard time hearing
people and so she was having a hard time and understanding some of the questions
and getting him to answer them correctly and and some of the questions were ones
that me and Tamara and Preston felt we knew the answers to so Sunday the third
day was great because Preston did a big talk and then did a demonstration making
the wedding agent and then we got to do some hands-on I got to teach how to make
microbial solution and tomorrow got to show how to make liquid fertilizers and
and then we did a plant walk in the yard this was at the Hessel range which is on
a couple acre property and nothing special there but just some grass in the
yard literally just in the parking lot we took everybody out there everything
you need was right there this little some grasses yeah so that was good every
and then we did big Q&A and just got to wrap up kind of wrap up the week and
talk about how we all use this stuff in our cultivation Preston has grown 10
acres of hemp using this system and he also said the same thing I use 90% of
the system and I use it this way and these are the things I use this is how I
implement it with other inputs like prenatal farming or like biodynamics or
like Google culture which should all those reference at all so yeah you know
our our approach to farming is very holistic we've started calling it
holistic farming as of late because we don't want to follow any one dogma we
need every tool in the toolbox and you know like we take from so many different
sources you know like this is another one I've wrapped and grabbed this guy
is a garden this is an amazing beginning to permaculture book and it's
got plant lists in the back and just amazing information you can tell my book
has been so used it has been wet and it's not so I got coffees because this is the one
that I use but like this is an amazing book guy's garden but we do we take from
every sources that we can like biodynamics to Jadam learning from
dragonfly earth medicine the KNF just organics just living soil I stayed a lot
with Elaine Ingram but yes it's just like learning you know because in each
place that you study from you learn new tools and that's this is about having
these tools in your toolbox for whatever environment you walk into and so that
and it's like in every environment like I've had as a property owner and
different places it's like it's always different it's always gonna be different
there's never one way to do anything and it's just for me I don't feel like any
system ever really just fits one thing I can agree I feel the same damn way
because I like I always well I was saying for a while I was saying all right
I'm like 40% Jadam 40% natural farming and 20% me you know I mean me being the
part that grabs all these different parts and types of systems and uses them
you know I mean it tries them out and sees what works because to me that's how
you develop your own deal you kind of if you don't have certain things and you
really shouldn't that won't end up being part of your you know your your system
like if you have JLS you have access to things like that then now that becomes
part of your system then you grab other bits and pieces of other things you read
and you try them and then before you know it you're like damn I kind of
figured out what I'm doing here this works for me a lot of people get hung up
on that like I feel like they get too like disciplined into that one you know
that one thing you know and like that that's the only thing that works but we
always preach diversity you know with the microbes and with everything else so
why wouldn't it be diversity with education and learning and that kind of
things that's kind of I feel y'all we're on the same page with that man I
think that's very key yeah well let's let's dive a little deeper on that since
we're kind of addressing that subjects a little bit why do you think it's like
all these little camps came up when at first I thought the whole point of
everybody working together was that we were kind of creating diversity through
you know this aspect so please teach the group you know this aspect so you please
the group and now it's I know these aspects I'm the one that created this if
you don't know my background then how can you refute that and then I'm gonna
charge XYZ price point and I don't know if that's because now people just don't
want to farm or I mean you guys have been teaching for the love of that and
that's why Marco and I you know continue to have you on the show because it's
genuine where some people are sudden it seems like they just want you know
education is now the the new you know flip and so we're just gonna travel or
do whatever we're gonna do we're gonna flip these educational packs you know in
a very kind of shady way in my opinion because the knowledge isn't it's not
there's no you know tip of the hat to the person that taught him that or
there's no mention of the OG that kind of gave them experience so that they
could run through that we've mentioned that briefly with a mutual friend of all
of ours Johnny last week you know I think a lot of people in the community
are starting to feel that way it's like hey wait a minute this you know you
can't be doing something for a couple couple years even and then all of a
sudden be saying that you you know you get to teach all these classes I think
that those things are meant for individuals that have been doing it for
a long time that's the point of being a teacher is that you have the experience
to pass it on so that your students become better than the instructor I
thought that was the you know that's always been the goal in Savannah Georgia
when you're kind of like trying to teach everybody how to do a variety of things
let's be honest but it was always that I'm gonna minimize your mistakes make
sure that you don't get caught up don't be a stupid-ass white boy walking around
carrying everything on you and your backpack you idiot you know a lot of
things that obviously makes sense now but when I was a young man I didn't know
that shit I don't have a big brother to teach me that and that's the kind of
stuff that I would love to see as a community is because the community is
like the big brother and we got to be like yo don't pigeonhole yourself on
this one technique there's so many different ways to grow this plant
obviously go down that road but remember that there's other lanes there's other
highways you can get off on on ramps on ramps off you know just kind of moving
back and forth with that with that knowledge and that's the point I guess
so I'm on this mini rant is some people are not doing that some people are
staying on their own lane and telling everybody else that everything that
they're saying is incorrect and that bothers everybody on the show yeah it
bothers me definitely for sure because it's just I feel like there's so many
different way in tools to utilize that there is just no one way and that just
kind of happened the other day I remember hearing someone talk that this
other person didn't know anything and then they admitted not knowing something
that was so basic to me that I literally lost all respect and it was
like oh my goodness you know and it's it's interesting it is for me I know I
feel like I'm not a teacher I just get excited about what we're doing and
learning and I want to share it with people because I found it really works
and I'm excited about it and it helped so much with my growing and with costs
saving so many thousands and you know it's I think in that Joey he's a really
actually better teacher he's even a teacher kind of like it's just ingrained
into him like he can't help but teach and well they say those who can't do
teach you know that ain't true in this case you know I had a couple farms you
know I had I got my first farm in 2001 I was 21 years old and it was it was 35
acres in New Harris and it was run down it had a little cabin on it nobody had
really been living there in years the guy bought it from his name was bear
Gratzel and OG and a legend of some humble you know in the store called the
bootleg anybody in southern home there was he moved there in 1972 he was an
East Coaster and built this little cabin and he was one of the first real growers
in that area he told me he was the first guy in that neighborhood to get to buy a
real a brand new truck with weed money the first guy in a humble to buy a brand
new truck with weed money and he said everyone in the neighborhood hated him
for a whole year until they all had new trucks too so yeah got to build that
property you know it wasn't from the ground up but the grows were there was
just a tiny veggie garden there he'd never grown big big weed there these
were during the guerrilla days he'd grown off his land down in the valley
far away we had to hike to it so this place I the you know fence it put in
beds and it was all really raw and those that permaculture stuff came in really
handy you know I only had so many resources there to work with it was a
very steep piece of property even though it was 35 acres I had less than an acre
of flat land on the whole property everything was very steep anybody's
seen pictures of my old farm from humble seen it's all terraced out tiny
gardens terrace terrace terrace so yeah grew there for a long time had that
place up until 2015 I got busted in 2014 and I had to sell it in 2015 and but
yeah that that's kind of where it all started for me as far as getting my
hands really dirty and really getting in a lot of experience growing cannabis
breeding it starting right around that same time you get heavy into breeding
and some of the strains I still have today or still have some of those early
crosses in it from oh one and oh two so that's been fun to get to you know keep
playing with that you name some of those strains what kind of what you got what
strange you talking about that was a great fruit from it from a neighborhood
called the Hanson Ranch Springs and Mendo and and this Hindu Kush blueberry
that was saga Martha's train that came to our neighborhood and in the late
90s I got it in oh one oh two but my friends for a couple of years so I still
have some of those in a couple of my genetics nice have you thought about
doing like seeds man genetics I mean we have we have genetics available right
now oh I didn't know that see just on a super small scale it's not it's not
hyphy I do have a sticker on the package but that's fine you know it's like
people want to buy hype they want to buy packaging and we are so anti-hype it
like sickens us all this shit's actually here the history or the genetics or the
pedigree or any of that shit sadly they just want to buy the hype so we don't
even play people on our shit they can come get it it's available hey I know
how serious you and my buddy Tim resin ranch shout out to him hey I know he's
so anti-hype I sent him a box of IMO just the box nothing else and he loved
that shit so you know I feel you on that man it's all about you know saving a
little bit trying to eliminate that waste you know I mean yeah you know
you're asking about you know teachers and you know who has the right to teach
and doesn't teach and you know like I mentioned we don't teach stricter doll
and we were going into that your doll workshop and and wondering are we gonna
step on his toes do we need to teach this to strict to the book we have a
little SOP we like to hand out before our class before to make these two
inputs and it's pretty it's pretty to the book but we deviate big times and we
asked Preston and he talked with him about you know talked with young saying
and and he was all good with it and we we taught and taught the way that we
normally do and and he came up to us afterwards he gave us a big thank you
and just thanked us for with his daughter translating thanked us for
teaching to Dom in the US and he seemed to be more than happy with what we were
teaching and we pay big respect not just to him but to to his father Hank
you Cho and to to creators of permaculture to drive by earth medicine
to Vassanova Fukuoka I mean we we shout out all our teachers and honor them all
right now from you saying that as a chill bump moment that is wonderful how
did that feel like you guys freaking making inputs like in his presence you
know just that's probably wild man yeah that was cool that was one of those
moments you're like wow that just happened that was rad I would never seen
that you know years ago as you're learning this and you're reading the
book and yeah it's definitely an honor you know yeah those tools can help
anybody so yeah those guys mean a lot to us
about the same way to have Josh and Kelly at our camp heal thyself this fall
Jack of earth medicine we've been such a big influence in our farming and taking
what we've learned in Jadam and making it even easier and making it even more
effective and efficient and helping us find our own path with these inputs I
like what you just said cuz I was gonna say some find our own path see I thought
that you guys were like you know at one point cuz I didn't know I thought you
were just DM you know look just hardcore that's it you know and I realized they
have Joey's doing Jadam to and you know all kinds of shit so I think what you
said is so key man you got to find your own path you know learn from all these
people and like I'm going there Friday excited man I can't wait to learn can't
wait to listen and I'm glad you guys said that because I was wondering I was
like in my mind I was like man oh you know it doesn't get lost in translation
you know I want because I want to hear his words and hear you know and
understand his words but I can't so I was really hoping that um it wasn't get
lost in translation and that's great that it doesn't and there sounds like
the the daughter you said was a translator does she know her stuff too
so where she's saying it she's not just saying the words she's she works on the
farm with them a lot of the pictures in the slides are of her on the farm the
whole family works on the farm absolutely and she speaks English really
well like I said it was more it was more on our end and you know our buddy Johnny
Gilligan who was on your show last week thank text he was teaching at the New
York class that they just held last week we saw that on the last day he was
teaching how to make the wedding agent we love Johnny Gilligan he's been a big
part of our last couple region camps teaching out here as well um bummed to
lose him out here but stoked that he's on the East Coast yeah we'll take him
yeah I was gonna say he's gonna be pioneering I think a lot of that stuff
in New York when I was in Georgia that's you know you take it to New York
that's how you get paid you go the reason why I get paid is because nobody
really knew how to do anything up there other than flip other people's stuff so
I think he's gonna make a huge impact and I wish him the best of luck I know
that you supposedly you know you if you can survive in New York you can survive
anywhere so I'd imagine Johnny's got the skill set to make that happen for himself
yeah he'll crush it hey Marco you're talking about DEM you know let's talk
about that a little bit you know when we wrap DEM that's the Dragonfly Earth
Medicine pure certification you know Josh and Kelly Dragonfly Earth Medicine
formed this amazing pure certified regenerative certification a bunch of
years back I think we both got certified around 2017 and it doesn't cost anything
to join you cannot buy the certification and it is your your your certification
is done by your community members if you're if you're going to get certified
around here we do the inspections I've certified a lot of the humble humble
medicinal farms because I was right on the right on the line and actually
working in both so it's a certification that recognizes your closed-loop
regenerative practices for your farming for your business it doesn't need to be
cannabis focused Tamara's farm here has been certified since yes since what
2017 and my farm up in Mendocino the Mendo hideout got certified in 2017
Josh Ramun Nieser farms he came out certified me I believe he certified
Tamara as well and it was a great honor because us there's no other
certification out there that has such strict standards especially when it
comes to cannabis and so when I was spent a couple years up at Heartwood
Mountain Sanctuary before moving here a year ago I was running their market
garden their CSA market garden and got that DEM certified as well recognized
for all those closed-loop practices these are things like a lot of the
things that you guys do creating your own microbes saving seeds catching a
storing rainwater yeah I'm on that for sure I was looking into it at one point
and I probably wasn't ready or whatever but didn't really come of anything at
the time but I in my own mind I'm like I'm about being closed-loop regardless
of you know of any programs out there you know my whole focus is like you know
everything right there on my property which is why I got the bunnies which is
why I make my inputs and grow my own you know come free everything to make my own
input so yeah I'm all about that definitely man and I think that's a
great program I've heard a lot of a lot about I've read a lot about it I know
it's not easy to get certified obviously but now that I know I can see I thought
it was anyone you know DEM could kind of get you going I didn't realize it
had to be kind of someone around your farm which that makes sense because they
come out and do the inspection and stuff I'd love to talk to you more about it
Marco because a big part of the DEM certification is you have to be
committed to educating your community and that's a big part of why tomorrow
and I do so much of what we do do so much because we're very committed to
that as we know both you guys are and yeah you know we get to go out to these
farms and it's been incredible and we've got to meet some of our best friends
through going out and doing these inspections people who've had incredible
impacts in our lives and you meet people get to see their farms and they're
teaching us some of these places are just incredible I mean we're this our
farm has a long ways to go we're really in the early stages of our development
we get to visit some properties that are you know second generation deep
sometimes and they're just incredible and people that are really living these
living those standards and living the life you know you don't have to certify
them they'd already been living it you know and it's an honor to get to go to
those you know that's cool I'll tell you what I'm at an early stage too man and
it's kind of like it's like man I don't know you know I don't want anybody to
see it yet you know what I mean because it's such a process you know what I mean
and although you see there's bits and pieces that are slowly building and
growing you know when someone comes out they just see like oh this looks like
it's you know chaos or it doesn't look you know neat and tidy you know and the
thing is man a lot of these things have to grow you know that little see that
little you know tree that's all over there you know that's part of the plan
out here you know what I mean so things take time to grow so that's what I
always try to you know get across but it that's one thing you know I think I'd
like to you know have have more people come out there used to be a garden tour
on my street and my farms on it was for the local street and when I moved in or
when I when I got my property I started doing my garden they the next spring
they stopped by and they say can we tour yours too I'm like sure come on out you
know and I kind of told him my plans and things like that and they don't do it
anymore but I want them to do it so they can come back and see the progress you
know I mean and you know to me that's what it's all about it's about growing
man you know kind of growing that property growing those you know those
systems that you have a place and it's just comes a lifestyle you know more
than anything you know so I'm starting to feel anyway like what my farm is just
becoming a lifestyle like I got cameras certain areas whatever and you know I
see a lot so much wildlife you know it's like I'm bringing that here because
before you know I got this property was just a vacant lot you know what I mean
it's just a patch of land so I feel like what I'm doing is working animals are
kind of you know communicating and letting me know that but it just takes
time to really get that full farm established because even though you try
to be you know 100% you know self-sufficient you know I got to order
fig trees I'm building my fig grove so I had to order those in you know I got to
order certain trees and certain things starting out just to kind of get the
process going man so yeah definitely definitely want to check out the BEM
and get a little bit more to their stuff you can go to stem pure farmers calm and
you can read about all the standards on there and a lot of ideas on different
closed loops and you know they want to see a farm practicing these for at least
a year these seven closed loops for at least a year yeah but yeah we'd love to
have more people join and support it and you know follow those standards good
thing to aspire towards you can't quite attain it just yet what's the thing
what's the plastics I know that they don't like the plastic packaging with
not wish nobody does but are there there are things like that which um they kind
of they you know what tell me about that yeah the biggest point of debate
around it is trying to find alternatives to putting plastic mulch on the ground
or using plastic occultation tarps to to terminate cover crops is mostly the
biggest hang up for a lot of farmers especially market gardeners who like to
use those types of you know run a no-till system with a lot of cover crops
they crimp their cover crops and then they want to tarp them for two three
weeks because that's a real easy fast way to break that stuff down and turn
over a bed with no no weeds no weed seeds in it so trying to find
alternatives to plastic based mulches alternatives to putting plastic on the
ground that seems to be the biggest hurdle that some people find and like I
said that they use on their farm their market garden in Korea they use a
plastic mulch as part of their system so when we when we taught our section of
the class workshop we talked about how we don't do that we chop and drop cover
cover crops or we use different living living mulches or you know we don't mind
our garden is small right now we don't mind doing a little extra work as opposed
to you know find a couple shortcuts and you know to get things to die back
because I've had to do that with cement that's kind of trying to take over and
so cardboard and sheets works great yeah I took a bed sheet and crimped some
cover crops with a two by six board with a string that I just walked down
the bed for them terminated them and then laid out a bed sheet you know I was
up at Hartwood black sheet or white just a white sheet just a just a light yeah
like a folded sheet and I and I thought oh I'm gonna have to keep this really
wet to get it to like break down and I you know I got a little wet and it was
dry in about 15 minutes and I said oh this is bullshit I don't think this is
gonna work at all and I waited about two weeks I went in two to three weeks and
pulled it up and cover crops totally terminated it just shows you don't need
to do much and I literally folded that sheet up and put it in the shed to be
used as a mouse house later on most likely and that's just so easy to lay
down lay some rocks on top and then kind of go back a couple weeks later and it's
you know done mulch that cardboard as well so yeah I love the cardboard good
tip there yeah that's um yeah cardboard's key and you know what man the
plastic I've done it in the past and what it is is when you start out it
looks good and it seems right but man when you try to pull it up it never
comes up it just breaks and tears and leaves pieces behind in the soil just
can never come up and I really yeah I've really gone away from the plastic and
some of the thick weed barrier the woven style I still have those but they even
to come up you know like they'll raise up to the surface even if you keep them
mulch it just seems like the edges that always want to start coming up and then
that phrase and tear so I kind of feel them on the plastic I'm definitely
against it you know like there are some old houses and you know around my farm
and so they tarped up the roofs and now you know temporarily well temporarily
turned into the tarps are just hanging with tatters you know what I mean and so
that shit will blow and it blows over to my property I find pieces of it so
you know just think about that stuff man but even though it seems like plastic
yeah I'll be there forever it really won't what it does is it kind of breaks
down and gets kind of in the way of it you know kind of gets into everything so
yeah I feel them on that I love I'll go cardboard all day what do you think
about like burning I've tried the flaming um what's been what do you think
about that you think it works pretty well on weeds or burning weeds yeah yeah
that's a four-letter word right there yeah you're right my bad I'm talking to
the wrong people but I'll say about doing the little weed flaming they you
know there's little tools you can run to run that flame right through there and
hit those weeds while it just tiny little sprouts I might try that too yeah
we're not really going there yeah grasses any grasses we got we use
because there's hardly any grass out here yeah the land we're on is rugged
it is rocky there it's it was originally a gold mine and a mercury mine it's 120
acres but I mean we've have we find weird stuff on this property all the
time there's a there's an actual mine shaft like a tunnel that goes into the
mountain like 100 yards back with corridors off of it and then a second
level to a second floor they have to climb a rope up and there's more tunnels
it is wild gold country and then like I've only been here a year I'm just
coming up on a year of living here tomorrow but like I found some new stuff
a couple days ago I took the puppy for a hike and went down to this section of
the creek that I've never been and and you know a trail that goes to where our
spring boxes where we capture our rainwater in the winter to fill our
ladders to use in the summertime and I realized that the creek actually splits
off right there and where we've been going to put this spring box is actually
a much smaller Creek and so I start following the big Creek up and there's
waterfalls there's one that looks like a pyramid with two waterfalls coming down
both sides and I get way up there way up the creek and super beautiful just
pristine and there's Douglas fir trees which we don't have on any other part of
the property giant old growth Doug firs and huge Madrones which we don't have
and what's in the middle of this most pristine gorgeous area was a gorilla
grow there's like a gorilla camp it's like you know plastic first thing I saw
was plastic tarps all bunched up bottles in the creek first I found like a
plastic fertilizer bag that was all in the creek and all all faded so I knew
it was somewhat old tomorrow thinks it was only about five six years ago which
is really scary to me that was not that far away from me and my baby at that
time so yeah that was they just went in I remember just having coffee and
watching them with their big helicopters with trash and people hanging on the
ends of it I'm like okay just leave my garden alone and we're good yeah that's
crazy they go in and raid you but they leave all the trash take the trash to
run another helicopter loader that's not most of like the local enforcements like
that's big thing actually in our California that they're doing is um what
is it with the grants no the Rangers yeah there's this marijuana and what do
they call I think that's an enforcement team but their whole main job is like
they had before legalization their main job was to go in and do the cleanups of
these raids and to also find them only on when they're like taking you know
resources away from the local wildlife and they found and like that's the teams
that they started calling in to do that but then when it's just a local
enforcement that comes in and literally just leave all this nasty trash and
poisons behind so we're gonna have to go up there and reclimate the area yeah
there are some good players in law enforcement who are environmentalists
who've gone into law enforcement not because they want to arrest people but
because they actually want to save animals and protect all watersheds and
yeah we've got a friend of the farm who's been a part of this and and when
you talk to him he's a passionate dude he's not you know he's not it doesn't
sound like a cop he really wants to clean up the forest and he's gotten to
see the worst of the worst animals trapped and animals poisoned and
watersheds poisoned and you know both hillsides deforested and you know now
that the markets crashed you're probably not gonna see any of that for a while
It's true, they don't have as many like things going on anymore out in the forest we haven't had any hikers go back in there or seen them on trail cams since legalization
So in a way they kind of got what they wanted in a way they mean in the
In a way, right?
But all that garbage is still out there
And that's the part we don't like man it's like we all love cannabis but I don't love it to the point of I'll take your trash and your
fucked up gorilla grow for the love that I have for nature and animals you know
what I'm saying like I'll put that first like you're gonna be out there dumping
all them chemicals which we're against anyway and then you're gonna gorilla grow
on top of that's crazy now maybe if you were out there natural farming you know
wouldn't be as bad because you're cognizant of the earth and you're
doing things the right way but really that's what brings the attention you
know they say when you know like you have high crime you know murders bring
attention well when you have trash left in the forest and in a way that you
know neighbors see that and residents see that that brings attention that
brings you that negative attention so in a way you being nasty and thinking
you're being a cool gorilla grower you're really shooting yourself in the
foot because now you got yourself hot you know and so that's what that's what
you get. I wanted to know what is the etiquette like if you're walking down a
creek or something like that river whatever and you come upon a gorilla
grow like that and humble like what it you just turn around or what how do you
feel about that situation and how do most other people's feel about that
situation when they're doing it in a very gray market? Well that situation can
be lots of different ways you know there could be dangerous people on your
property or it could just be some young kids but like you know are you on your
property is the big question you know if this is people gorilla growing on your
property that's a no-go I don't I don't care who the fuck they are. I meant like
you're you obviously own like hopefully these people have seen you before maybe
not so you own property you're walking down the river you walk by somebody
else's gorilla type grow is that a no-no or because you live there it's like
alright it's cool. They're not supposed to be here these guys are that we're
literally on land then they know they're in the wrong there's no way that
they're like. That was scary to me I was actually had a nursing baby a single mom
here and like I had my team but I was like thinking back I'm like oh shit like
I'm up here by myself a lot and with my nursing baby and I was just like that's
that was scary and he told me that was that close I knew it was there but I
thought it was way back in the forest I had no idea it was that close and
if I was to come upon it it was on my land if I was to come upon it and I was
on somebody else's land or something else I'd be getting out there if I was
to come upon it on my land I'd be pissed and they'd be getting out there. I was telling you about a buddy of mine in Mendo I did some
consulting on his farm a couple summers back and he has his you know his own
property it's 40 or something 40 acres and he had the neighbors had leased out
their place to a group of guys from another country and they were they had
gone on to his property the neighboring property my buddies a really steep part
that he doesn't even access and had clear had cut some big gashes in the
forest about 30 feet wide and about a hundred fifty feet long and I'm talking
running straight up and down the hill and then built PVC hoops running
straight up and down a hill it was like I'd ever seen there's so much work and
he only realized it because they also tapped into his spring which is how he
discovered it and when he went down there he already knew from the rubblings
in the neighborhood and what everybody's saying these were bad bad dudes and he
couldn't do anything about it and he had a little confrontation with them
and you know tried to stand his ground a little bit but he had to pretty much
stand down and tough situation and they they didn't have a good year or anything
they had no idea what they were doing I saw tiny little holes it was crazy what
they had going on and they were gone by the next year they lost the lease on the
other place he had to wait it out a year but yeah I mean it just it's just
my point being it just it depends so much depends it could just it could be
some really bad gnarly players like that or it could be kids who the minute the
minute you go in there and bang up their camp they're gonna never return you know
what I mean they're gonna run away but yeah disappear out here all the time
still people still get killed over this stuff I'm like who does that in Northern
California just goes walking up some random road off the highway to up this
mountain residents people are
sometimes happens because we're off the highway but we're about a fourth of a
mile up the mountain off the highway I'm not gonna feel I mean I know you feel
violated like if they're on your land because your land is your home I do
weeks I got a lot of creeks out here and then after you're done in the creek
go hiking and that's how we call it like extreme naked hiking out here but it's
dangerous do it a lot and that really I imagine that would be like out there
like and where you guys are you know you're out there there should be no eyes
on you you know what I mean my farms are urban farmer streets you know street so
there will be eyes on but out there where you are that's where you should
feel most safe and that's where if there is a gorilla bro on your shit you gotta
go ahead and take care of that let that be known we're not doing that yeah and
then to cut the man's trees a lot of people don't realize man lumber that's
big money like you could some people just sell 10 acres of lumber pocket a
hundred hundred grand you know when they want to off their land so that's money
like you're talking you know depending on the type of trees you have so man
that's that's pretty suspect right there no there's been a lot of robberies out
here in cannabis lately but it's been licensed operations licensed
manufacturing operations hash operations and licensed distro just distros getting
broken into by big groups multiple vehicles and getting robbed it's
happened a bunch in the last few weeks right around the North Bay in San Rosa
area is that we're like they could get your license number and know where
they're located type shit me or who knows inside jobs I mean you know
everything's pretty obvious around here who knows but yeah that seems to be
who's getting robbed these days there's been a lot of that but you know as far
as like we're robbing farms with the price in the toilet it's not worth
getting shot over what is the price I mean where y'all I mean like is it that
load obviously you guys have gone to teaching personal use growers we grow
our we're allowed six plants each and 100 square feet so we've got five five
people live on our farm here so we grow our personal use amount which is we can
do our little bit of breeding and and all that but tomorrow's putting in a
hemp license this year with a small hemp license from there right grow from there
but yeah on the rec market prices this fall were terrible prices were 250 300
dollars on the rec market wholesale to a farmer so that's brutal even on the
other side it's still really brutal it's only a couple hundred maybe more yeah
I'm hearing recently that prices were coming up on the rec side I have a
brother who has a distro and we do a little show on my Instagram once in a
while called brother Andy's market report and he'll come in and try to put
a cheerful face on but he's just he's pretty realistic with people about
what's going on in California you know he's from Humboldt he's a farmer but he
also has a showroom in LA so he's just realistic with people these are the
numbers you know if you can make them work let's make it work you know so
we'll see there's a there's still a lot of good small farmers in the rec market
they're hanging on by a thread they need people support now more than ever and
yeah so what what is it is it just like if I'm on the East Coast right I'm saying
okay supply and demand there's too much supply I mean like give me I know there's
a lot to do with laws break it down a little bit for me if you don't mind
only 400 something retails in the whole state they they had before legalization
we had this medical market where we had thousands of retailers around the state
yeah we had lots more growers but we had lots of retail and lots of open market
events and delivery services and there's just so little retail shelf space now
and you have distros and big brands literally paying for shelf space that
can afford it the small farmer cannot afford to pay for shelf space so there's
almost there's not even enough shelf space for these guys they didn't make a
place for y'all right is that what I'm hearing?
And then the distributors are really getting in the way too it's just there's a lot of money between that
and then a lot of times farmers aren't able to process their own like cannabis
on their farm like trimming and they're sending it away and getting like just
gouged like $250 a pound for it to trim their wheat they usually just throw
through a trim machine and so it's really sad that what's happening and
then some people this year and last year it was more expensive for them to put
their herb out there than for them just to compost it.
Because it costs more to package it and test it and send it through a distro you still pay taxes on it just to sell it at a loss it doesn't make sense for a small farmer to do that so yeah the whole system got rigged.
Everybody brought the gray market back then is what they did right?
Yeah they shorted up the black market.
Right now they're working hard like people are really pushing towards these you know direct to consumer markets for them like some more cannabis farmers market because you know you need those small farmers need to be able to connect with their people you know like you become a customer or somebody once you connect with someone you hear their story and you just like you make this connection with your herb and your farmers and you're not able to do that and like just
building with all these other brands so being able to connect directly to people
with your medicine is huge and that's like a big push right now out here.
Does that boil down to education where I'm always saying people are okay we got them in the dispensaries they're buying cannabis that's good but we need to educate them more on why this natural techniques of growing are better.
Do y'all think that would help?
Exactly, exactly what we need. We need more education there needs to be like education constantly in the retail shops about that so that is you know that's another thing that we feel inspired to do as well even while we were down in LA we had so many talks about that and curing that's why we're about to do a cured cup in April on April 22nd we are going to host here the cured cup
and it's all about regenerative cannabis grown it has to be grown last season and cured up until April and so that's we're going to teach an education about what that is because people are down there telling us oh we got the fresh stuff we got the freshies and we're like eww who wants that I'm not even smoking.
That was some really educated like eye-opening that we did and we were like wow we had no idea people didn't know about curing there's just some basic things and about how it can actually taste so much better and you know just it's a lot of education.
Yeah helping those connoisseurs develop we don't have connoisseurs yet like we have in wine you know people that are real experts that know the regions and they know the grapes and they know you know we don't have quite that understanding yet.
So the underground market sure does I mean the LA market in the in that South they have the best of the best and that's why I don't understand in the dispensary aspects everybody wears the cookies hoodies and they what is the disconnect because when I was growing up in Georgia the connect it was California it didn't matter the genetics any of that shit if you could in a way prove that it came from California you could prove that it came from California.
You could charge a premium where now it seems like you guys can barely get stuff off and then what's charged as a premium is just kind of like white labeled stuff from what I understand like they just come in if you're a good small-time farm they just kind of like take over your brand slap the cookies on it and now it's a cookies brand and that's another sad thing behind the scenes that I'm learning is the good farms get gobbled up into now this you know hey I spent $500 on a hoodie so that means I'm gonna get $500 off of it.
I really understand cannabis as medicine and it's the exact opposite obviously of all that and I thought that's more of what California started out to be especially where you guys are from Humboldt was kind of like champagne France if you will you know bourbon for you know Kentucky for the the tried and true kind of like sticks out in a way Humboldt cannabis was was something that was you know in high times magazines I remember reading that as a little kid you know that was the Mecca.
Yeah well we take that responsibility seriously as far as people that have been living up here in the Emerald Triangle for a long time growing for a long time in the culture for a long time we want to help educate people as far as how to be better consumers and how to understand good cannabis because to us the reason we hear about indoor and why does it taste like cardboard and why doesn't it you know it look good and it looks pretty on Instagram but why does it never taste good have any actual flavor it's because it's not good.
It's not cured and I'll explain it to you guys like this the you know for for eons up there in the Emerald Triangle for 50 years we grew outdoor and you know for the most part and and the best growers would harvest their plants in October and November and they would put those pounds away they would dry them and they would do their curing process this bar this burping this exchange of air and moisture and it's a real dance.
And it was different for everyone depending on the region of the area that you lived drier where I am in the eastern part of southern Humboldt and Palo Verde wetter and petroleum and honeydew where you needed to know your your conditions and people weren't trying in good conditions that are trying and Costco pop-up carports and lean to sheds and there was a real art form you know.
Addicts and basements and root cellars and their kids bedrooms you know and if you were a good good grower who grew fire fucking weed and you knew how to dry it and cure it you were gonna break those pounds out in April and May and June and July and if they if you did everything right they were gonna be perfect they were gonna be the best of the best that that herb was gonna be at its peak.
And you were gonna be rewarded by getting the highest price because the market had dried up the flood had passed from harvest and if you were really on it you were gonna sell those as fresh depths and get a real big payday.
This was the reward and why a lot of that outdoor was sold as good depths and a lot of depths got their name from killer outdoors.
I'm kind of pulling the curtain back here for you guys but this is what went on for decades.
I hope they're listening.
This was this was the big reward is that you're a fucking killer grower you know how to dry your cure your herb and you're gonna sell it to the out-of-town custies as depths.
You earned it you're the fucking best you're the best in the fucking West and now all that's changed because with the rec market it's we got to rush this herb to fucking market because it's gonna sit at the fucking distro for two to three months anyways.
It's not gonna be the same product it was when you open that jars when it went left the farm it never is.
You've been out here and ever bought a jar of weed in the rec market sadly it's it's many you know it's it's not like it's been cured and well cared for and stored.
It's been in many storage facilities and been removed to be tested and changed hands and anyways to shit show.
But my point being where we want to talk about that art form of curing the herb and so we're gonna have this friendly competition on April 22nd here at our farm.
We're gonna have a sash celebration and we're gonna bring out some of the best best OGs that know how to dry and cure their herb are gonna be competing.
They're all gonna be judging each other as well as a few other special guests.
I talked to my buddy Eric Brandstad like that greenhouse he's gonna be our lead judge.
Eric's been judging the flower category for the Emerald Cup for a lot of years and somebody I trust trust with my lungs and have a lot of respect for.
So yeah and it's really just about education we're gonna have some panels and really talk about this because it's something that isn't talked about.
Because you meet indoor growers who talk about I'm rushing this weed to the market and I got the freshest weed on the market.
I met distros who bragged about it. We got the freshest fucking weed on the market.
The minute it's harvested we don't even let it dry we fucking rush it to the market.
And I'm thinking you're a fucking idiot and you've never smoked good weed in your life.
And a lot of people are never gonna get to smoke good herb because unless you link up with a farmer who's passionate about their craft.
They shouldn't even be releasing their herb to the market until it's really gone through that process.
And for every strain it's different. For every harvest it's gonna be different.
You need to be sampling and smoking throughout the months to figure out when something's at its peak.
And it's often something we're not even impressed with at harvest.
And you're thinking all winter long this isn't even gonna be nothing.
And finally you might smoke it in April or May or June or even July.
And suddenly that smoke just came to life.
And you're having a whole new experience. You're like holy shit I wish I'd kept the clone.
I wish I'd thrown some pollen on that fucking plant.
Often it's a little too late.
But this is where we need to go as consumers, as smokers, as lovers of cannabis.
You need to dive deep into curing that herb.
And I'm not shitting on indoor growers at all. I'm just saying hold on to that herb.
And often it's indoor it's such a small harvest it's gone before you get a chance or it has to sell to pay the bills.
With outdoor growers we had so much herb laying around we really got to you know oh yeah I masterfully cured it till August.
Yeah and then August of the next year as well I still was sitting on it sometimes.
Unfortunately that happened out here a lot.
We got to smoke two and three year old weed.
I might have some five year old weed somewhere in a pickle barrel.
I had a buddy that called that the platinum cure.
He couldn't get rid of it so it's like oh man this shit just keeps getting better and better.
The non consensual cure.
So yeah so Cured Cup we're starting to throw more events just for our Patreon members.
You join our Patreon and more events are free to come to.
We really want to build some community around that.
On the Patreon we're able to kind of like share more too.
You know like we can share more cannabis picks.
We can talk more about what we're doing more openly.
Because even now with my business Heal Thyself Gardens I have to be careful because I have a hemp business.
And they watch my profile and my website periodically to make sure I'm not doing cannabis.
And so there's that you know just things like that.
And on Patreon we're just a little bit more protected.
And yeah we're going to be doing a lot of education.
We're very excited about what's up to come with it.
But we are going to have some really fun events.
There's Flavors of the Farm coming up this month.
And we're not sure about March yet.
We have a couple more things to do on that one.
And then in April we have the 22nd our Cured Cup.
And we're going to have a really great band that night.
The Dusty Green Bones Band.
It's a nice jam band and two good friends of mine are in there.
And we're very excited.
It's going to be a good time.
Is that open to the public or how are y'all doing that?
It is open.
You just have to go join our Patreon for that month.
And then if you don't want to go the next month for the next event
because we're having events and also just education on there continuously.
You can always just you know sign out.
Yeah we're trying to do at least one in-person event every month.
And you just got to RSVP and depending on the capacity however many RSVP first.
So if a person joins your Patreon they get these events included?
Oh yeah.
That's a no brainer right there folks.
Yeah shout out to Patreon man.
It's totally cannabis friendly.
How does it work man?
I can't post a photo of a cannabis plant or a bud on Instagram without it getting removed.
And me getting restricted for a week.
I just got banned for a week from doing lives.
And our lives we can't do more than an hour.
So we're really limited over there.
I've had my account deleted at 35,000 followers before.
And lost seven, eight years of posts.
A lot of good natural farming information that I'll never get back.
So I'm over it.
We're over putting energy into it.
We want to put our energy into Patreon.
We're supportive.
There's no trolls there.
It's like you want to come be a part of this.
Come pick us a few bucks.
And we don't ask for no handouts.
We provide plenty on there.
And we're more than happy to work for it.
We get to have kind of a wild too.
I'm going to be manufacturing up to be ready to do some medicine making.
I'm going to do some basic first aid classes.
And just some basic medicine making.
And then some more advanced on my own website.
But we're going to have all kinds of just different things.
There's so many of us out here on the farm.
And we all have different skills.
With Noble with his cacti.
And what Joey does.
What Kendra does.
Sierra and body movement.
And we all have many things to share.
So we're excited to start packing it.
Yeah, Patreon.
I hear a lot of people going over there.
I know IG, me especially.
I'm off that right now as well, man.
Because for the same reasons you said.
You know what I mean?
If we love cannabis as much as we do.
Why would you even want to be on a platform that doesn't have that same love.
Or hates what you love.
You know what I mean?
So it just doesn't make sense to me.
I may have to try Patreon, man.
Well, I was going to say, man.
Instagram is now allowing big brand cannabis.
To show their ads and stuff.
Really?
Yeah, hell yeah.
So it's a biased cannabis platform for sure.
And again, we've talked about this Joey.
And Tamara several times on this show.
About when you are building up that.
You're putting all that work and time into it.
It is like putting.
You're building your house on someone else's land.
And you don't own the land.
So you might own that house.
But then when they want to come and take the land.
And delete it.
What are you going to do?
And a lot of times, especially in the earlier days.
A lot of us signed up with an email.
That's what happened to me.
I wasn't able to retrieve it.
Because that email wasn't around anymore.
So there's a lot of nuances and stuff.
I think that come with social media.
That it's not worth your time.
I mean, if you put all that time and effort into watching.
Videos and educating yourself.
But just being immersed in social media.
To be honest, a lot of it is drama.
Especially lately.
As kind of always.
You know, you get immersed in that.
An hour or two goes by.
And if you really think about that.
An hour or two that's going by.
If you were immersed in something positive.
You're going to start making those.
I like this one little book I was reading.
Where you just go for 1% every day.
So you just try to improve a little bit every single day.
Then by the end of the year, you're kicking at 365.
I kind of like that little analogy.
I like that because I find success.
If they focused on the education aspects.
It sounds like going to the Patreon.
I don't know enough about technology.
Obviously that's why we got London.
But, you know.
The Patreons and all the things that are allowed.
I hope that more of the community does go that way.
Because Instagram has never provided anything positive.
For the community.
We've never been supported by that.
And now that it seems like they're supporting the big.
Ag type.
Like the cannabis companies and farms.
It's another kind of like kick in the face.
To the small time individual.
And I feel like we all feel that way.
Practically our whole lives.
Even when I was smoking cannabis in high school.
I still felt like a loser and an outcast.
Smoking in the South was kind of.
Why everybody's drunk as shit.
Why do you smoke weed?
You're such a piece of shit.
I like what I like.
You like what you like.
What's the difference?
You used to see it differently.
Yeah.
I want to encourage everybody to seek out their favorite educators.
And find ways to support them.
We see lots of our favorite educators.
Starting learning platforms.
Starting different paid platforms.
Patreon's a great one.
And I want to encourage a lot of our friends.
I was telling just a friend this morning.
Hey dude.
You need to start your Patreon.
Because there are some incredible minds in this industry.
They give it away for free.
We support now more than ever.
And it's a great way to work intimately with these people.
It can actually really improve your grow.
Improve whatever the hell it is you're working on.
A lot of these farmers.
Especially up here in the Emerald Triangle.
And in California.
Cannabis right now are available for hire.
And seek them out.
It's a great way to get that one on one interaction.
With like your people that you know.
Have wanted to talk to for years.
Or you know look up to.
So I love that.
Personally I get to connect with those that I admire.
And you know look up to.
And it's just really.
It's a sweet platform.
I do like that.
And we're also working on being able to do it into our own website.
So then it's like we almost own it a little bit more.
So it's a progression.
Yeah.
I love the Patreon though.
And you know what's interesting about social media.
What you brought up Brian too.
It's like it hypnotizes you.
Like when you're sitting there scrolling.
For like you said two hours.
I've noticed this before.
I'm like going in to look at a message.
And then all of a sudden I'm like.
How long have I been looking at this stuff?
Oh my God what was I doing again?
And it's a hypnotize.
I just went through a hypnosis course.
I'm a quantum healing hypnosis practitioner.
Do a lot of past life regression.
And just work in that realms.
And it is exactly what that is doing.
It's like we're hypnotizing people.
A lot of the times during the day.
Because we're into something.
And everything else just kind of zones away.
When that happens.
When you're not really hearing anything else.
And you're in your zone.
You're hypnotized.
You're in that state.
So when we're watching TV.
When we're doing social media.
And we're in a very highly suggestible state.
Just like in hypnosis.
I can sit and suggest.
There's so many suggestions that can be implanted into us.
When we are in that state.
And we're not really aware.
And get to really pay attention.
And be conscious of what we're putting into our brain waves.
And so.
Conscious of that.
See that's key right there.
Speaking of being conscious.
I don't know if you've watched part of the Grammys or anything.
But there was.
Take it for what it was.
But it was definitely of a satanic type nature.
Right.
And after it was over with.
However you feel about it.
It popped up.
Boom.
Sponsored by Pfizer.
And I was like man.
You start paying attention.
Like wow dude.
Those people are everywhere.
Like it was like two seconds after the whole like performance.
And I get that some people.
It's an artistic expression and all that stuff.
But it seemed pretty.
You know.
If you haven't watched it.
Maybe you should go check it out.
You know kind of thing.
I'm scared.
The music industry is.
Is on a whole other level of that kind of stuff.
When you talked about like hypnotize.
I think that's on a whole nother level is when you can really remember.
I remember being younger and being.
You know I can remember song lyrics.
Almost amazingly sometimes.
Rayman style.
I listen to the song enough.
But I can't somehow recall what was being taught to me in college class.
And I could go there for hours trying to listen to that stuff.
So I think there's something to that to remember as a human being.
Is like man.
What do you feed your mind with?
And I'm guilty of it too.
Listening to sometimes stuff that's.
You know not exactly as positive as it probably should be.
But I still enjoy the old school.
Like the biggie and the Tupac.
And the like really old stuff.
Reminds me of being a kid.
You know.
Totally.
I feel that way too.
I went through this course by Bob Stevens called Mastery Systems.
And it was about you know really paying attention to the voice in your head.
And using your words to be your direct prayer to God.
To the universe.
That every word you speak.
You know this is what you're manifesting.
And so when he was talking about how like music affects our emotions.
And we attract things more with our emotions.
We get more wrapped up into it.
You know we're passionate about it.
And so whatever we're singing about.
And so he would have the song.
I can't get no.
Uh uh uh.
Satisfaction.
I was like oh shit.
You know there's like all these songs that you've been bolting out for years.
And like okay.
So there's like certain ones that now I'm like cancel clear that.
Okay cancel clear.
That's not real.
But then there's others that like I just can't get away from.
Like some good Tupac and Eminem.
You know some things like that.
But um.
Definitely will alter your mood with music.
You know.
Hip hop ain't for all the time.
You know what I mean.
Hip hop is a certain time to listen to it.
And a certain time not to.
Because it can get you hyped up.
Back ribs.
Yeah.
You don't start your day with Lil Boosie.
Yeah Lil Boosie.
Inside joke.
Inside joke.
And so you know we were talking about these are the skill sets that you need.
But and beyond.
And so what I was trying to you know when we were talking about what should we title this kind of thing.
It's more about giving beyond to the to the family.
So you you choose in your life to gain these skill sets.
And then you want to pass them on to your children so that you can create this kind of like.
We use the word legacy I guess it's different on the east on the West Coast.
But you know you're giving something to your family like you're passing on something.
And it's more than just a monetary thing.
You're making it to where it's like hey our family we own this piece of property.
And I've seen that with you know extremely wealthy people to be honest.
It seems like they from day one they have that stuff dialed in.
They're teaching their children whatever industry they're in.
But they're getting their minds dialed in.
And for us as farmers I think this is where we're not only teaching OK maybe you can make an investment.
You can monetize this make make a skill set for yourself.
But you might at this point also be one to be might be one of I was about to say it again might want to learn that skill set so that you can teach others and make medicine and that kind of stuff with food as well as herb.
And as things are starting to progress the egg little scandal and all that kind of stuff it does seem like if you have a little piece of land with an acre or two.
That's kind of like the American dream now is to go back to our roots in a way to go back to when we used to be as self-sufficient as we could in our homestead.
And then we would trade with our neighbors trade with people in town.
And I think even as our global scale it seems like we're going back to that way where nobody wants to be the world's police anymore because it's to the resources are too high.
Speak speaking to too high.
I don't know if you guys.
That was tough for me to say that.
No they.
That's funny man I was just thinking about or saw someone that earlier.
I can't.
When you said it I lost my train of thought but I was with you.
I was with you.
Definitely.
There's a lot of you know the US is always you know the world's police type shit.
And I saw somewhere that nobody even that's what it is.
Nobody wants to win or Olympics.
Like now no country wants to take that burden on because it costs so much.
So now they're talking about doing it like just rotating it or whatever between a few countries that want it.
But you know that's kind of how the world is going man.
It just seems like you know what I mean.
I don't know.
It's people getting lazier or just you know it's almost like nobody wants to do anything anymore.
And here I am.
I'm fucking.
I grind my ass.
I'm like I want to get mine.
You know but I see people younger than me that don't.
You know and I'm like grinding is really a young man's game.
You do that shit when you're 20s 30s you know grind hard work your body.
You know I mean save your back.
I always give people that advice and then you steadily work throughout your life but you don't necessarily see as much to me as much of that grind coming out the gate.
And I don't know what it is.
It has probably a lot to do with everything we said you know what you're saying about the Grammys programming looking at the phone all day.
Some parts of me even like getting off Instagram.
I don't even want people to look at their phone all day looking at my shit or whoever else's.
I want you to maybe use it as a guide and keep on going.
You know what I mean.
Because if you start looking at my stuff I just go in and before you know you're in a rabbit hole you get caught up in their ads.
Another thing that I don't like about IG is when you scroll and now you might see one person that you like or two.
And then here comes an ad of something that's weird or something that you didn't ask for or something that you might have talked about earlier with somebody else in real life.
See now that's when it gets real scary.
So you know a lot of you I'm not saying like y'all like talking down or preaching nothing to nobody but I get it.
So and people that are sitting here I think get it and I think a lot of people listening get it but some people don't necessarily get it.
And you know what goes into your mind whether you're thinking about it or not is going to be you know computing through there.
So you know even if you're mindlessly looking at your phone your brain is very powerful storing a lot of shit.
So to me man get out there get outside.
You know what I mean.
Do something like you know work your body and your mind.
And I don't know why we went there but we did.
What do you think the future of Humboldt is for you know the next generation.
Like if everything's down I would imagine being a cannabis farmer is the guy said removing the veil a little bit.
It's not as cool as everybody used to think it is you know.
And now that there's no money involved only the true purist of someone that loves the plant is going to be wanting to get involved.
Yeah I don't know.
The fantasy is over I think.
But just probably for the better.
I mean with all that money came a lot of a lot of bad stuff was hidden because of it you know.
Because you never call 911.
Lots of bad shit gets swept under the rug.
And it's a tough place to grow up man.
It wasn't easy growing up.
A lot of my friends have all taken their lives and you know I've had really fucked up stuff happen up there.
You grow up fast up in the middle of China like in the 80s and 90s.
There was a lot of drugs.
There was a lot of crime.
And sadly like the drugs and the crime were kind of what's left.
A little hometown of Garberville was like really in bad shape.
A lot of stores just closed up shop.
It's really you know it's really looking like a ghost town.
Everything they predicted is coming to pass.
It's super fucking sad.
So yeah I don't know.
It's different.
It's going to be different moving forward.
It changed so quickly.
A year two years ago the market was still decent and everybody thought things were just going to move along as normal.
And if the price would just go up a little bit in the rec market these farmers could get saved.
There hasn't been any distros to really focus on farmers yet.
A couple of locals get it and they're doing all they can.
But they're in it because they're in it.
They're here.
They're locals or they've got their own farms like my brother had mentioned.
But like there hasn't been anybody that's really gotten it.
This is important to preserve these people and these farms and these strains and this legacy and this history.
It's important to cannabis culture.
And look how much has been done for the regenerative movement period by cannabis community.
Right.
Look how many people know about K&F, Jadong, Hugu culture because of the knowledge that's been pushed around and the research that's been done by cannabis farmers.
It's the gateway.
Definitely the gateway.
Into farming, into natural health, to taking care of yourself.
It is such this beautiful gateway.
I feel like she's going to go under for a little bit.
Right now the corporations are trying to take us out.
These big farmers and the ridiculous, just so many laws, the regulations.
It's just overregulated.
Some of these regulations have got to go.
And there's just too much of it.
They're really trying to kill the small farmers.
And I know for us, I'm not looking at a license anytime soon.
Maybe that's for Laura, my daughter.
Or maybe that's maybe in a few years.
I'm not sure.
But it's sad to think about that.
But right now I'm like, I will never stop growing cannabis.
That's never going to be an option for me.
I can't.
I'm totally in love with the plant.
So I feel like right now she's having us just do other things.
It's like, yeah, it's really interesting right now.
We don't really know what's going to happen.
This is a crazy question.
Do you guys feel like this could be a wave of the big cannabis industry
finally figuring Cali out?
Y'all were first figuring out how to break the small guy down.
And then now they run that on across the country eventually anyway,
behind the legalization that's already going on.
So they give you the legalization and then break you on the financial side
with the shenanigans.
Well, you don't think that's so much of the regulation up to local control
and all these local governments either banned it or just botched it.
None of these guys know what they were doing.
And it's not like there was any good models to look at from around the rest
of the country.
We see Maine looking like they've got the best laws.
Michigan had a great medical law for a long time.
But yeah, they just botched it.
Mendocino has six active state licenses right now.
That's a failure.
That is a massive failure.
For the Mecca of cannabis, six active licenses.
Wow.
And Humboldt and Trinity aren't doing much better.
It's really tragic.
In Mendocino there was a major breakdown and failure happened there.
And that's where I had my license farm for a long time.
It's just super sad to see what's happening.
And farmers are exiting every year.
We're going to see a lot of farmers not plant this year.
I should say something that could really help.
That is like the value added product.
And that's one thing I've been talking to other farms about and just kind
of like advocating as like a product maker.
I know.
And also as a farmer, I know how much me taking this lavender
or even just this cannabis flower and turning it into this product.
And I make like absorbent more, you know, more.
Like it's like there's so much more you can make with a value added
product once you turn it into something like five times the amount you
would have made on that flower.
Yes, you have ingredients and things and you've got to get a recipe down
and you've got to have these certain things.
But a value added product for a small farm could save them.
It could be everything to them.
It could be what they become known for.
And I feel like that is like a really big thing is for, you know,
the small farms to come together, do collaborations.
I know I'm working with a few in my little area.
All of us kind of coming together forming what's called the regenerative
farming guild and just working what we all can together, you know,
in communities. So, yeah.
Yeah. Well, going back to one of those permaculture principles,
diversity, diversity is strength and the diversity in incomes is strength.
We can't have these monocrops.
You can't have that one crop coming off the farm.
And certainly that one type of crop bulk pounds is not where it's at
anymore. So, yeah.
Farmers got to get with that.
And maybe it means, you know, smaller packaging.
Maybe it means making extracts.
Maybe it means making edibles.
Maybe it means making elderberry syrup or drying your fruits.
Yeah. And oil infusion, you know, olive oil infusion.
That's some herbs.
There's just so many different ways you can go based on what you have on
your farm, what your lifestyle is, what your interest is.
And so that's, it's,
I feel like it's a really good tool for small farmers to have.
Well, I'm glad you guys diversified and are going to make it.
That's wonderful. Is this property right here, Joey?
Is this in Humboldt again?
No, we're in Lake County.
We're about three hours south of Humboldt.
We're just east of Mendocino.
Okay.
We're way of southern tip.
We're right where three counties actually meet right here.
Napa, Sonoma and Lake County.
So we're right on the edge of this beautiful wine country.
We drive through Napa and we go to San Francisco.
We're about a half hour from Calisto.
It's beautiful.
We're at the foot hills of Mount St. Helena.
Hot springs, carbon hot springs.
Oh, y'all have hot springs.
That's a nice luxury right there.
Beautiful property.
Very rugged, but it's got a lot of natural beauty, tons of water.
We have a lot of trees and plants here that we use in natural farming.
We've got the bay laurel and the juniper trees.
Angelica.
Both of those we make herbal solution pesticides out of.
What else grows here?
So much.
The Yerba Santa, the Mullen, the Angelica.
There's a few, I'm not sure about their names, but I know that they are
some almost extinct native flowers that my permaculture teacher walked the land.
And because of the serpentine soils and the high mineral content,
of the land and exactly why it's been mined so much is why these really,
some of the rare flowers and some of the species grow here.
Luckily, not in the area where our gardens and the human areas are,
which I found out with environmental scientists and all that.
So thank goodness on that.
But there were some beautiful pieces out here because of the water is why
I bought this land.
And I knew with water, I could farm this land.
You could farm on rock.
You could build soil.
You can do anything if you have water.
And that right there is, it's a huge thing we do have in the winter.
And so what we're able to do is now have three water bladders,
three 50,000 gallon water bladders that fill up during the wintertime
that are filling now.
And they then, as soon as they're filled, we cut that off.
And then we're able to use that throughout the summertime.
We don't have to tap into anything except our well for our personal
and the animals.
So you got these set up then uphill on the hillside,
and then they just fill up and now your water is just gravity fed down, right?
That's wonderful.
We got some pumps and things.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's key, man. You got to have that water.
Water is so key that I built a pond.
You know what I mean?
I just wanted to have that reservoir of water.
I can just go grab water for the plants or grab water for the animals.
That's key, man. Just having that.
And yeah.
That creates life.
Yeah. Just it brings, and that's what you said about, you can,
if you got water, you can grow plants on rock because you can build soil.
That's so true. That makes them, you know,
it's just such a natural thing to think about it that way.
Luckily y'all got that.
So y'all got springs pretty much all around mountain fish springs in there too.
There's about four creeks I think run through the property.
And then where the mine was, the big mine, there was a tap spring.
And so it still runs.
And so in the middle of summer, when the creek is dried up,
that spring still runs.
And last year was the first year it ever dried up.
And like from, I think they probably from them first doing it.
Because when I got this place like eight years ago, yeah.
About eight and a half years ago.
It was, it was just glowing.
That's why I bought, like, I was like, this is it.
Because at the end of July in Lake County, when that creek was dry,
there was a spring that was just gushing water.
And I knew with that, I could do anything.
And just that, because I could pipe that across the land if I needed to.
There was water there.
And so that's one blessing we got is that pipe spring as well.
Now when that spring stopped, so you were like, oh shit, my spring stopped.
Now, how, what happened between it stopping and you find,
and it came back to life and you're like, oh yeah, we're back.
Was there a huge rain event or was it just season over?
Yeah, it was a rain.
The rains came and since the rains came, it, yeah, it's been flowing since.
How nice is that?
That was wild.
And we live behind the creek.
So when it really rains here, we can't get across the creek.
We can't get to town.
We have to make sure we park the Subaru on one side of the creek
and the big truck on the other side of the creek.
It's one of those situations.
Yeah, I had a, there was a little bridge when I first moved on out here,
but during one of the creeks, it took it out of the creek.
During one of the rainfalls, it just took it on down the river.
So it's too, it's, it rains too much for a big culvert then.
You'd have to have like an official bridge to sustain that.
Wow.
Well, you know, when you're staying home, when it rains,
hey, we're in, we're chilling.
Yeah, yeah, so nice.
Moving forward, like, do you think that,
the next generation, I guess, you know, as,
as we're kind of going beyond that, this,
they should focus more on like the soil aspects,
but there's obviously so many branches.
So from all of your experience and knowledge and putting through the
videos and retaining that information,
what arm or tentacle do you think the newer individuals should,
should go after and then branch off into those other topics?
Well, I think we have all done a disservice with these annual crops
and not spending more time planting more perennials and fruit trees
and things that our children will actually get to enjoy.
And maybe even our grandchildren.
And I hope they'll get with it because,
I mean, I think it's a, it's a, it's a,
I hope they'll get with it because we've been hung up on this,
this whole annual thing that takes a lot of inputs is, is a completely,
you know, these monocrop systems are nothing like nature.
You know,
the fun thing we've been learning about the last couple of years has been
centropic agriculture and centropic agroforestry and how to work more of
these perennials and nitrate fixing trees and biomass producing trees and
perennials into our systems.
And in a place like here in Lake County where it's super hot and sunny in the
summer and way hotter than our annuals, our cannabis, our hemp,
our veggies need, it makes sense to plant more,
more shade in our cultivation space anyways.
So we've been loving to learn about this centropic farming, a system out of,
out of,
out of Brazil founded by a man named Ernest Gotch and a really cool system.
Talk about mimicking nature.
This is really the blueprint for making the food forest.
I know we talked about it a little bit last time we were on here,
but we're looking to do a small version of this this year.
We're actually planning to do an educational event.
We'll do some video. We're going to have a little movie showing here,
show some movies,
these little talks and kind of introduce it to folks that don't know much
about it.
And we'll stream that on our Patreon and try to do a little fundraiser to
people to buy a fruit tree or buy a vine or buy a bush and help us build this
little garden together because we're going to integrate this into our hemp
garden, plant these more permanent perennial tree lines.
That'll have many layers of yields that'll yield over time.
They'll have some berry bushes in there that'll be yielding in the first six
months and they'll have fruit trees that'll start yielding in two years and up
the fruit trees will be growing vines,
berries and kiwis and things that'll be producing.
And tomorrow we'll have her commercial herbs in there for her Yieldless
Health Gardens product line.
Which is quite a bit of the product,
like we have the rose hips and you know,
just so many of the different goji berries we're going to be able to utilize
inside this entropic is what we need actually and I use for the product.
So it's really exciting to integrate it all and really,
yeah, really getting pumped for it.
And this is really how nature grows.
This is really what we see in the forest,
the bare field turning to grass and then turning to bushes and then the trees
grow up out of the bushes. It's succession.
It's understanding succession and planning for it.
So yeah,
we're excited for that and excited to learn more about that and to pass that
knowledge down to the next generation because we feel like that's really
getting back to nature.
What we're doing with these annual crops and all these types of farming that
are all these separate inputs.
It's really looking at everything separately when it's,
there really needs to be this holistic animal like we see in the forest.
When we look at the forest,
we see those many layers of plants.
My goal is like when I'm 70,
I don't want to have to work the garden.
I want it to be able to just kind of take care of itself.
There's going to be pruning involved and that's the main input for this,
but it's like, that's it. It just takes care of itself.
It's a fully revitalizing system and it's like what's powerful.
It's like, this is how nature does it, but it's sped up.
It's like you're accelerating that.
I feel like that is what our role as humans is to do as caretakers of this
earth is like wherever we are,
our place should look even better than anywhere else because our job is to
accelerate or to help nature do its thing.
It's like we literally could re-talk,
just help the earth by just creating these.
So much of the rainforest has been taken out.
These are systems that can within years rebuild those forests back up.
So it's a really powerful system to learn. I'm really excited.
The annuals work too much too, don't they? The annuals are more work.
I want those perennials that want to be there and want to kind of come back
every year. It's going to help you save.
That's going to buy yourself a little time right there.
But yeah, it makes a lot of sense, man.
I'm going to look up on that myself and learn more about it.
Thanks for dropping that on us.
Definitely.
How would you, so, go ahead.
I was just going to say London just got back.
So we wanted to do our break real quick.
So for our audience, get your bowls ready.
I've been partaking to be honest a little too much today.
But I'm going to have a nice little dab.
But yeah, join ourselves in this conversation.
And it's kind of unbelievable to peel the curtain back a little bit
and hear from you guys and hear about the ups and downs so that our audience
realizes that there's no real glamour in farming.
Even back then, I mean, there's a lot of violence.
There's a lot of Pepto-Bismol, Modi-Maid-Days, worried with anxiety
and just unbelievable stress, especially with things that fronting,
like verbiage that people don't even probably think about today.
That was all coming out of Humboldt.
And I felt like even on the East Coast, we were trying to learn from you guys
in a way, trying to find out, who's the best farmer up there?
Who's the best, basically, individual being able to get the perpetual harvest going?
Because sometimes, man, we would have a plug that would come East
and then they would send the next batch and it would look like a totally different grower.
And it's like, man, this is exactly, we could get that on the East Coast.
You know, that's not hard to do.
We thought we would have all these better plugs and it was very hard to accomplish, man.
So I appreciate you guys kind of letting us see behind the scenes
and realizing that I would imagine most things, especially back then,
were a little more frightening than the average person would want to deal with.
I want to talk a little bit more about Curin when we get back to you.
Hey, so again, we appreciate you guys.
Marco's over there.
All right.
So, you know, behind the scenes, trying to get everything together.
But yes, let's smoke one.
Let's smoke a group.
Individuals take a quick little stretch break.
Yeah, then we're going to get right back into Curin.
All right.
So, all right, Curin.
So let's say chopping in October, November and Curin until April, you know, May.
What's that?
So what's happening in that process?
Is there, you know, checking in on it, burping it,
keeping a hygrometer in there?
Is it more about knowing it's exactly that right dryness when it goes into my vessel or container?
Break that down a little bit more for people that don't really know.
Well, it's all those things.
And a big part of it, like I said, is really knowing your space that you're working in, you know,
where especially during the drying.
The drying process is so different than your curing process.
And the drying process out here was usually happening during a panic, you know,
and you don't have a space.
Like I said, you're trying to dry in the Costco carport.
You wouldn't believe how much weed was dried in those Costco carports over the years up here.
And I know a lot of farmers are still using them.
It's crazy enough.
But if you get a good, a nice dry fall here, you could pull it off.
You get two weeks of dry weather.
So, yeah, you know, drying is really where most people just take good weed and turn it into bad weed.
And it happened a lot up here because everybody was working on such a large scale.
You know, the big commercial years.
There was a time when I had two farms and growing well over a half ton at a time per fall,
trying to get all that down in October and November with a small crew and minimal amount of dry space.
One of those farms being off grid, which makes things even harder.
Now you're looking at how do you heat without power?
You know, propane heat can be really wet, really moist heat.
Kerosene can be really dry, easy to lose your terpenes.
You know, it's a delicate dance.
So, you know, everybody's dry rooms are different.
My best dry room was my old grow room that I would use in the springtime to veg clones.
And in the fall I would dry my herb in it.
And it was temperature controlled.
It was insulated.
I had insulated floor.
I used this dehumidifier that was also, it was air conditioner, heater, slash dehumidifier, slash ionizer.
And I could just set the temp and the humidity that I would want it.
And it would either heat or cool or remove humidity depending on what my parameters were.
And that was the best.
And that was where certainly my best herb was dried.
You know, handling your herb is going to have such an impact on that.
When was it harvested?
Was it harvested in the rain?
How quickly did you take it from on the plant, out of the field, into that dry room and hang upside down?
Did it get squished during that process?
Did it sit in the tote in the sun?
You know, all these things matter.
We know so much of that now from processing fresh frozen for hash.
You know, we want to get things processed, bucked, big leafed, and into a turkey bag and in the freezer within a half hour.
Hopefully within 24 minutes or less.
And all that stuff makes a difference when we're drying that flower also to preserve those terpenes.
So, all the other tips I'll give you come from my friend Dr. Bob, Dr. Robert Martin, who ran California's largest cannabis testing lab, CW Analytical, for a lot of years.
He used to come up and give talks on proper handling SOPs for your harvest and how to avoid contamination.
And he said where the most contamination happens is between the harvesting in the field and getting the plant in the dry room.
And it's from people, sorry I put my hand right in front of your face just now.
People put their herb in that tote and don't put a lid on it and throw it in the back of their truck and drive down their dusty road to get to their dry room.
And it breaks my heart. I see it every harvest. I see people with a trailer with a tarp on it and just a mountain of weed.
And they're like flexing like yeah, and they're going down the dusty road.
Or they got their pickup truck just pulling, just cola's getting coated in dust.
And that's where most of the contamination that we see that's going to make people fail.
Not only fail their testing, but their weed's going to suck. It's going to be lower grade.
Nobody wants to smoke all that dust and dirt and grime and all that.
So clean that herb up, tote that herb up before you get it to the dry room.
What else? What do you like about drying? You've had some interesting dry spaces.
Yeah, mine on the property right now is from, is quite interesting.
What we call a shop right now. It was my dry room.
And I had the concrete come like put in and that was all nice and fermented.
And I was trying to have a structure built. I was also trying to, I had ordered like part of it to come in and then to be built.
Well, during this time, all this was supposed to happen and my permits for it.
We had massive fires in California. And so I never got any of it done and it's time for drying.
So me and my crew got together and we had to figure out a dry room situation.
So luckily my gardener on the time also happened to be a contractor.
And so he was used to building. So three guys on my team got together.
They built a nice frame. We insulated the frame.
He built the roof from a lot of the wood, the trees that were out here and tarped the entire thing with massive commercial grade tarps.
And that is where the shop is at this moment because of that situation.
Because I could never, I never was able to go back and redo it because pretty soon, you know, a few years after that is when legalization hits.
So that's one of the structures that we now have is due to my drying situation at that time.
But for me, I was always about getting it insulated indoors somewhere because I knew it was so hard to try to keep that moisture level at a certain level.
If you're outside trying to dry carport or greenhouse, which I've tended to do before.
So for me, my big thing was the fans. I had fans positioned on every row and I had the intake and the exhaust.
My words are moving there right now. The intake and exhaust fan in certain places and my dry rooms.
And that just really kept my air circling really well. And I was able to keep my moisture temps, you know, just always had the temperature gaze up so you can see.
And had the de-hues on just in case, you know, if it rained and it's a dance. It was definitely a dance.
And you go in there and squeeze your legs to see how they are. Okay.
Once they are dry, you better get that stuff into your bins because you have the next round that needs to come in.
And if you put that next round in, your other stuff gets rehydrated.
And so it's a dance, you know, it's a lot of work.
And then you're curing because yes, your stuff is dry, but guess what? It's not all the way dry.
So you're burping your bins or whatever you're putting your herb into.
And that is like every couple of days, you kind of process at the beginning.
And yeah, that's what I found the most helpful.
It's just like I needed definitely an insulated place and what it was.
And you can control that moisture level.
One thing is the weather you got to watch for too, right?
My little experience growing outdoor, the harvest time, I always look for the weather.
Like, okay, I got like three, four good days without rain.
Yeah. Here in Northern California, we have two seasons.
We have hot and mud. Yeah.
And October could be either one.
It could be in mid-September, we had 110, 115 degree, you know,
spike in, you know, little run in the heat.
And then October came, we had some crazy rains.
So you just got to really be ready for it.
Watch your trichomes. You know, that's the biggest thing.
It's like even if stuff is like, it's a really nice time to harvest if your plants aren't ready.
Yeah. You know, you got to make that call if you're going to go ahead and pull them or not.
And so that is something.
Is pulling them early, like you just, that scenario you just mentioned, Tamara,
is that where you make that decision?
All right, we got to go fresh frozen now or we got to take it to a different way so we don't lose
because it wouldn't be ideal for flower type thing.
You could. That is a scenario. Yeah, you could do that.
Just diversifying, but not losing on it, getting what you can if you did have an unfortunate situation.
Sometimes I like the longest rains weren't more than like two days.
You know, I'd like to wait it out because sometimes if you do have that rain,
they'll plump up a little bit, especially if it's only that second or third, you know, like that rain.
They'll like plump up and you'll get that extra like, you know, that swell.
And so, you know, if they weren't ready, sometimes they'll be ready right after.
It'd be kind of nice.
Yeah, they can handle a little rain. It's more, are they well staked up?
Are they supported? Like and depending on how you, you know, how did you shape them?
Did you pinch them throughout the year? Can they support themselves?
Some plants really can support themselves, especially smaller ones.
But yeah, as long as your trellis stuff isn't flopping over on each other.
It's when you lose that airflow.
These plants are made to wick that water right off themselves.
Sometimes they just need a little shake.
A little shake.
And, you know, of course, you know, we're growing strains of Tamara's,
the cheese bread for mold resilience on this property.
We're growing strains of mine that I did the same thing up in Humboldt Mendo for years.
So we don't really worry about the rains as much and like in Lakeland as intense as other places either.
So we're kind of fortunate on that.
So yeah, we just, we can usually kind of wait it out.
Yeah, it's usually dry here. Tamara gets dry weather.
She can usually grow these long sativas.
We have plants go deep into November.
This is a dry part of Northern California.
It's almost like highland desert in a lot of ways.
Okay, so that water is even more important, having that water.
Do you guys see like sativa farmers still being able to command a certain price?
I wanted to talk on that real briefly if we could.
Well, on our trip to LA, we had a lot of people talking about how much they love sativa.
That's definitely been a thing right now for a lot of people I've heard is sativa.
I absolutely think it should be charged a lot more because of how much longer the growing season is on them,
especially if they are full term and not just a light death.
You have to know how to work in the rains with them.
This is a little glimmer of hope that these connoisseur markets are starting to come around.
We see interest in haze. Look at all the interest in haze in the last year.
People are finally talking about something other than just skunk, skunk, skunk or something.
There are more interesting things out there, y'all.
And these sativas are one of them.
Yeah, we were at a session in Oakland last summer and talking with a guy.
He's in the rec market, but he goes there to backdoor all his stuff at the local sesh.
And he was saying that sativas were what everybody was asking for.
He was saying Blue Dream was hot.
Talk about a haze.
And he said sativas were selling out.
So that was really cool to hear, interesting to hear.
We love that too because in Lake County, we can grow sativas.
That's one thing that we can do really well down here is grow those long going sativas.
I've had one go until the end of January and I cut it.
But it's like we can have them and they're gone and it doesn't do too bad.
Especially that could be a lane.
Yeah, that could be a lane that the big corporate guys can't fill now.
Right. And we kind of make our own lane now.
Let's go big sativas going real long.
That don't financially work for y'all boys, but it works good for us and the people want it.
I like that.
Have you guys found that it's usually the suits, they look to the CFOs to make those kind of decisions.
So the small time individual kind of what Marco is getting to might have a huge edge there if they just focus on sativas.
Because that CFO is not going to understand why would we take another potential up to a month or more to farm this sativa.
And then cut it out and then cut it down.
The rooms are going to be not broken down correct.
And all the things they talk about in those meetings where you guys and I would say the community as a whole realize that that's kind of again that last little magic that it doesn't seem like that is enough in the marketplace.
That's why everybody's asking for it.
Yeah.
And what I think too is there needs to be education around it as well because sativas look different.
And if you're a connoisseur of the sativa, you know when you see a sativa because that bud structure looks different than an endocarp, fat, heavy skunk, afghan.
And so that is the more education that needs to be around that and to celebrate that the way it looks.
And to let people know that that's when you know what a sativa is.
It's going to be more airy.
That smells amazing too.
What is that strain right there?
That's some haze that golden fig gardens grew at the farm.
And this is a tie, a black tie.
I don't know if you can tell, but this weed is totally black.
So cool.
And that's not even trim.
That's just rough trim.
That's smoker trim.
That's what we do at Dyerhurst.
We call it farm cut.
Farm cut.
We don't trim our weed for each other.
We just kind of like cut it up.
Exactly.
If I gave my dad some, I was like, here you go.
But it wasn't trimmed.
Some people like that in the market.
Like in the underground market, it's a way to show kind of like bubbles in the pottery.
Like this shit was handmade.
Look how close you are to the source.
So yeah, I think the consumer as a whole has a lot to learn about what could potentially be a beneficial thing that's getting knocked off.
They used to call it, no offense.
Did you guys finger bang it or did you just leave it out?
I'm sorry.
That's what everybody fucking say.
We let that go.
Is that too much?
That's funny.
Oh, my goodness.
I knew what you were about to say and I just forgot to.
Oh, gosh.
Yeah, I think it's important for farmers to find their unique thing because the big guys are in this commodity market now.
Their job is to grow as much weed as cheaply as possible and offer it as cheaply as possible.
And you don't want to compete in that at all.
Nobody wants to play in that.
That's a losing battle.
They're losing it on their own with millions and millions of dollars.
So, yeah, seek out that unique thing.
Find something unique.
Pop seeds, pop and seeds.
Find that unique cannabinoid that's not been discovered yet.
And that unique strain, that unique, you know.
Do some hunting.
Can't do it without popping seeds, though.
Like you said, you got to pop them seeds.
So going back just a little bit, I know the good old days are gone.
But when was it good?
Like, when was it rocking?
Like for y'all, was that just very recently?
Like, has this been within a couple of years now, this kind of the way the industry went?
Well, there was a bunch of phases of it.
You know, there was a time before enforcement, you know, enforcement started in 82.
So up in Humboldt Mendo and Trinity, they were growing field, you know, big plants out in fields in their front yard.
This was before the helicopters came.
They had a real time of prosperity from.
But that was also, you know, they mostly had sativas from Mexico and Colombia and Thailand.
They didn't have the indicas yet.
Prices weren't really high.
It was still prices were low.
Prices were, you know, a thousand bucks a pound.
It was hippies getting by and, you know, having a real time prosperity.
82, Ronnie Reagan, Nancy Reagan, just say no.
A lot of federal funding got poured into the campaign against marijuana plant.
We call it CAMP.
That was the year I was born.
My parents had just moved up there the year previously.
And every year growing up, it was helicopters every day, literally hovering over the house, hovering over the whole neighborhood.
You know, we're in this neighborhood of 40 acre parcels.
You know, it's all growers around us.
The whole neighborhood's growers.
And and armed personnel.
I mean, military dudes, machine guns, camo, dudes being dropped from from fucking cables into people's yards.
So when that happened, that was what became the guerrilla days.
That's when you couldn't grow on your land anymore.
Cultivation was a felony.
You would lose your land and go to prison for years.
Mandatory minimums were coming in.
And so that's when the price got really high.
That's when the price started getting up to 4000.
And when I started when I was in the mid 90s, it was 4000 to 5000 dollars a pound for outdoor weed.
Indoor weed was cheaper.
Indoor weed was it was an inferior product and wouldn't go for as much.
Everybody knew that, as we all still do now up in this region.
But yeah, so it was dangerous and and hard to grow because you're growing in the forest, guerrilla style, in the shade, in the trees, because they literally have military helicopters combing the land, blowing open the trees.
And you had to go out in the wintertime and make your trails and hike your soil and your amendments and bury your water lines because you couldn't have trails going to your gardens.
So when I started growing weed, these were my early jobs was hiking water in five gallon jugs into the woods, hiking soil and amendments into the woods, building fences, fencing in areas, pruning for sunlight to get into the canopy.
And and you'd be lucky to pull a quarter pound plant, you know, but like I said, a pound if you if you were if you pulled 10 pounds of weed, which took a fucking effort, you would be buying land that year.
You know what I mean? You'd have enough for a down payment.
That would be a big win if you pulled 10 pounds back then.
So people had little gardens, you had seven plants here, you had five plants over there, you had 10 plants over here, we had plants up in trees, you know.
Man, I was going to let me jump in.
I was going to ask you about that because my mind took me back to a whole High Times article from, I don't know, probably 2000, 2001, maybe I don't know, way back.
And there was these bags that were like camouflaged and a dude had his shit up in trees and I was going to ask you where they doing that.
But then I was like, I don't want to sound stupid.
Yeah, absolutely. That was some of the early grows I was doing because you had you have deer here.
You have to fence everything for the deer and the pigs.
We had really bad wild pigs in that neighborhood.
And so getting your plants up in the trees, man, you didn't have to fence them in.
And you could often get better sun up there.
And you would run drip emitters.
You know, we're on hill. It's everything's on a hill out there.
So it's easy to gravity feed from a tank to your garden and you can run drip emitters, half inch emitter line up a tree and run spaghetti line off of that.
So we'd have tree gardens with everything on drip and then you didn't have to go up there all that often, which was good.
So, yeah, it was hard in those early years.
I got camped when I was 15 in a tree garden like that.
They pushed all my bags out of the tree.
I had four gardens spread out over these 240 acres.
My buddy Pete's property and they found every garden and they would leave you a few plants so that you would stay in the game.
You know, they don't want to wipe you out completely.
And and so, yeah, so that was like 80s going into the 90s and then medical hit in 96.
But it was still a bunch of years before medical became a thing.
Those early years, we had these these 215 doctors who would come up and they would write scripts and they would hang out in the neighborhood and party for a few days.
They were party doctors and they would come up and write notes, 200 bucks.
And you were a medical patient.
And and so then people slowly started growing it more out in their front yard over the next 10, 15 years.
And really around 2010, 2007, eight, nine, 10, it really started blowing up.
People started getting hit to those big grow bags, big 200, 300 gallon smart pots, plastic pots, fabric pots and and pumping it.
And a whole industry sprung up around it.
As you guys know, all the products and the growth store and what we have now, what we're trying to untangle people's minds from now and teach them a simpler way to grow.
But, yeah, certainly around, you know, people talk about the green rush out here.
Certainly around 2010, the green rush was in full swing.
And you had a lot of people moved in that didn't give a shit about this community.
We're just here to make money.
A lot of people, you know, just from everywhere, you know, people from all kinds of, you know, all different countries, but just everywhere.
Everybody was there was a mad, mad money rush and land that people had thought would never be bought up and grown because it was just such shitty land.
People were buying it up and adding super prices and bulldozing the shit out of it.
And it was definitely the landscape change and the neighborhoods change.
And suddenly there was a lot of shootings, a lot of crime.
And, you know, it was a crazy time.
That's wild.
That's wild, man.
Right before they went into legalization in 2017, they estimated that there was something like 20,000 gardens in Humboldt and I think 10 or 15,000 in Mendo.
And I think those numbers, I think it could have been double that, you know, it was a huge community.
And that was just two counties. All of Northern California was like this.
There was a thriving industry here that fed the rest of the world.
And not just the US, but the rest of the world.
So we'll see. It's still happening in small pockets and the good herb is still here.
There's a lot of people still doing it in the triangle.
And they're not going to quit, man.
No matter the penalties or the bullshit.
They're lifers and they've given their life over to this plant as we have.
And we're going to do what we can to keep it going, even on our micro scale.
And certainly the education is how we feel we can do the most impact and shine the light on the people that we love, that we think are doing a good job.
Making sure that their message is getting out there.
We're having a lot more fun doing that these days than talking about our own work.
But showing who's really good out there.
Because we know, and not everybody does, but we are the connoisseurs.
We stand in those circles and smoke the best herb in the world and go to these gatherings.
We know who really deserves the accolades for the way they not only run their farms and the efforts they put in their cannabis, but the efforts they put in their communities.
A lot of these people are incredible community members.
And give a lot back and very rarely talk about or get any recognition for it.
And those are the people who we really want to shine the light on.
And they're the good examples.
And Monkey See, Monkey Do.
And we see a lot of people learning good things from these shows.
And you guys have put out so much good info.
Look at the impact on regenerative farming just from Future Cannabis Projects channel over the last three, four, five years.
Holy shit.
These conversations were not happening.
Nobody knew what KNF was.
This was not a household word.
JADAM.
That there's a JADAM teaching tour happening right now.
People know what it is.
That is awesome.
And yeah, so big up all you guys, all the educators.
And you know, I've said this before, but we think of ourselves more of activists than educators.
We're not the teachers.
Our job is not to master.
Our job is to shed light.
And we work for a higher power.
So we just help get the word out there.
Maybe we're not always experts and know things perfectly.
We're learning.
We're students.
And this land keeps changing.
You know, it was a gold mine at one point, and then it was a commercial cannabis farm.
And now it's a gathering space and an educational space and a learning garden.
Which is still gold.
Yeah, it's still getting gold out there.
And we don't know what it'll be in five years, but we're going to keep changing with it and using everything we've learned to keep on keeping on.
Is this one where you are?
So you guys are locked in.
Roots are down here.
I know at one point you were at the there was that retreat, you know what I mean?
And they went through their own deal.
So now I'm glad to see you guys can go ahead and kind of get those roots down.
I think that'll be important for you to, as you know.
Yeah.
And we can host groups here if anybody wants to do a little event here, a gathering.
We've got beautiful space and campsites for about 80 people.
And we can have a good old time here at a 420 friendly campground.
So I hear the sub.
Sorry, I couldn't click my mute button.
We got a few questions here that we should probably get in.
We got 14 of them.
We try to try to keep it a little little under three hours here.
I hope you see a lot of improvements, Joey.
We care what you think, buddy.
So the first one is from Mr. Chad Westport.
Shout out to him putting out a lot of fantastic content, even as his own channel,
putting out a bunch of new shows and stuff.
So check him out.
He wanted to know some rabbits are better than others for me.
Do they have dual purpose rabbits out there?
Some rabbits.
Yeah, we don't have any rabbits right now.
We're going to be doing our our.
Our hutches in April or May.
I know Tamara was able to get a bunny grant.
She got some bunny money a couple of years ago that paid for some of the bunnies she got.
But there's shelters around here.
We can get rabbits pretty easily.
We can kind of get our pick of the bunnies.
You want to come in and answer some questions?
You would think, though, like, I don't know for sure, because I'm not that deep into it.
But it's either meat or pet.
I mean, if you think about it, like, I guess.
I mean, what else is a rabbit?
I don't know the other purpose, because the number one person purpose I like is that that rear end pellets.
Well, maybe other people know better than us.
But from what I understand, if they're a meat type rabbit, they're not that intelligent.
Oh, yeah.
They're not.
That's true.
Yeah.
So, Brian, to your point, the yeah, the meat rabbits will they will have a lot of meat.
They will, you know, poop in their own bowl, you know, over and over and over.
Two of them will.
They're dumb.
Two of them won't.
I consider them smarter.
You know, whereas your rabbit was smart enough to go to a specific place over and over, which is a higher intelligence, actually.
And I think that's breed specific.
So Lionhead, from my experience, is the smartest breed that I've ever played around with, where more of the meats, the dwarfs and stuff.
They're just those are outdoor.
But remember, you want something.
Yeah.
You want something for outdoor.
There's bread to be outdoors.
That Lionhead.
I don't know what he's.
Yeah, that's it.
That's indoor only.
That's a.
Yeah.
Foo foo bunny, dude.
There you go.
Yeah.
We have to use varieties that are heat resistant.
And we had some here a couple of years ago that died during a heat wave.
And we talked to a bunch of bunny farmers in the area and everybody's everybody locally's bunnies died that day that didn't have the right varieties.
So really building your hutch really good, making sure they've got areas they can get down in the dirt and be really nice and cool and making sure you've got a variety that can handle those extreme temperatures.
If you've got them, whether it's heat or cold or whatever it is, because I was really sad.
It was super fucking sad that happened.
So, yeah, I don't know.
I'm not on the bunny team here at the farm, but I'll do some inquiries.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, nothing's cuter than like a baby bunny.
So, yeah, there's something to that.
Hey, may I ask a question?
Absolutely.
I'm just I'm I'm cooking at the same time.
So.
So pardon me.
Just to give me two seconds.
Here we go.
So you mentioned earlier that you were talking about you your first year of the farm really get on there and observe when you're starting on your first year and starting off your regenerative farming experience is kind of one of those things to to start at that level and really have an observation point and look at your farm.
Now, I'm not I'm moving my farm in a couple of weeks, but I'm not going to be there for a good portion of the year this year.
It's been traditionally agriculturally farmed for a long time.
And I ask this question because I think a few people right now probably have bought a farm, have purchased their first land, perhaps, and they're like maybe not have a house built on it yet, but they're able to start going and hitting it and developing the land a little bit.
So my question for you is like what could if I had one acre of a like traditionally farm flat, you know, traditionally agriculture land that that been run barren for a couple years, what would you get started with?
Would you like throw a huge mix of stuff down and kind of let it come up and die?
And how would you get like that reinvigorated and started in if you know you weren't able to do a lot of these other things like what could you suggest?
Right on.
Well, yeah, you know, even though you can't be out there for a year, there's a lot you can learn.
And hopefully you've got some neighbors there that you can talk to.
Maybe you've got some farmers in the area.
You can learn a lot just by being on the land and kind of observing.
You know, I've been on the land here at Tamarus now for a year.
I'm just coming up on my final just a year.
And like I mentioned, seeing new parts of this land I haven't seen before.
I'm starting to see it in all the seasons.
But I'm also noticing areas that fires happened previously.
And I'm noticing other areas where the animals are coming through because I'm seeing their trails.
I'm seeing their manure.
There's still a lot of observation that you can do just on the existing site.
You know, you know, you say you've got a bare lot, but I know you've got some plants growing there.
You probably don't have bare soil.
Yeah, but it's also like surrounded by traditionally farmed land too.
So it's not like there's any wild around.
So there's some old plum trees in the corner, but there's really not much.
Like it looks like it's been left for a couple years.
So just basic grasses and what's just maybe some clover.
I don't even know. I'll find out in a couple weeks.
Yeah.
Well, it's going to depend on, you know, what are your goals?
You're looking to build a little garden and set up the homestead.
I would look at, you know, what are the free resources in the area that might not be toxic that you could bring in?
Do those neighboring farms have anything good?
Any manures, any excess waste that might not be riddled with pesticide or glyphosate?
Probably.
I mean, yeah, that'll be definitely something that I'll be keeping my eye out for and the farmers that I'll be talking to.
Yeah.
Going back to, you know, gathering our available offsite resources, you know, what is what's available in your community?
Is there sawdust? Is there a mill? Is there a brewery with spent grains?
Is there a chip drop where you can get wood chips?
But also I'm going to keep hammering at home, being mindful of everything we bring on this property.
I'm really mindful of the source, especially things like wood chips, anything that might have pesticides on it.
Manures that might have dewormers in them, you know.
So just, you know, while you're trying to gather up free resources, just being really mindful of that.
And then going in, doing some soil testing, maybe figuring out if you've got some heavy metals there, if it's been a toxic dump site.
You know, I definitely worry about portions of this property being an old gold mine.
We see a lot of trash here and every time it rains, new areas of garbage get unearthed here, little bits of it.
And just trying to get a picture of what's happened there previously.
So you're not just planting a bunch of stuff.
You might need to go into a major cleanup mode before you go into major growing food for your kids mode.
And certainly a lot of the crops during this early phase can do a lot of that remediation.
We like to start getting microbial biology down in the ground.
You know, you can make compost teas, you can bring in good compost, you can start making compost.
If you've got grasses there, I'd start watering them and getting them to grow.
I'd just try to get whatever's growing there already to start growing and maybe start to make compost with what's already there.
It really just depends.
You know, these systems that I talked about previously, these centropic farming systems can all be done from seed.
But it's really planting all your seeds together at once and letting nature kind of sort itself out.
So in a square yard, you might plant a hundred different seeds.
Everything from your veggies and your fruits to your fruit trees and your cover crops.
And then, you know, first thing is going to emerge your cover crop and kind of provide a little protection for everything else to start taking its foothold.
And that succession that we talked about earlier starts taking place.
So it's going to come down to whatever your needs are for that property, you know.
But that's what I'm looking at.
I'm going to design this food forest from day one.
So I'm going to start laying out, you know, where's my exposure to the sun?
Am I in a place in Lake County where I'm trying to limit my exposure to the sun?
I'm going to lay my garden out so that my trees and everything cast as much shadow as possible.
I'm not trying to capture as much sun here as you might think for a hemp farmer or a cannabis farmer.
We get more than enough.
I get 100 degree days some days here.
You know, it's too much.
So laying all that stuff out in relation to the sun, to the wind, to where your fire pressures are.
I know we've talked about some of that on some previous shows.
And yeah, really just laying biology down.
You know, we like to make this Jadon microbial solution that...
...workshop next week.
I know I've talked about it already, but it's a really easy way to...
It's a really easy way to culture some biology using potatoes and salt and a little bit of leaf mold.
A little bit of biology you gather from the forest, nearby forests that are right on your property if you're lucky.
So yeah, those are the things I would do.
Testing of your soils, big ones.
And trying to learn from your neighbors and learn from your existing plants there.
You might have plants that are growing that you think are weeds, but they're really telling you that your soil is deficient in something or it's rich in something.
And I would start using those weeds right away to start making liquid fertilizers.
Because those are the plants that need to be fed back to that soil to get it in balance.
Where it can go to the next stage of succession and get past those little woody weeds and get on to bushes and trees where it wants to go to.
Awesome, thank you so much. That was a beautifully answered question.
Oh yeah, you hit on everything there, bro. Perfect.
Wonderful, build that biology. That's kind of key.
And you know, like Joe, you made me think of something. Building my land, I'm going all year five.
No wasted moves, you know what I mean?
And that observing and getting to know the land, seeing where you travel, seeing where the road ends up being.
All those things matter. So kind of figure that out even before you plant anything.
Because you don't want to really, I know I don't, once I put a tree on my property or perennial or whatever, I want to leave it there.
It's there to stay. That's where its home is.
So it's important to scout out that home and get that determined before you kind of get too ahead of yourself.
I actually thought my road was going to go straight down the middle of my property and that's how it's been going.
But then when I built my pond and I drive, so I drove my driving around my pond and I'm thinking, well, shit, if I ever get old or if an elderly person ever comes to this property, I want them to be able to drive a lap kind of around it.
You know what I mean? And enjoy these things, turn their car off, sit there with their window open, even if it's me, you know, and just enjoy it.
So it changed my road. Now I got my road going around the whole perimeter, leaving that middle open,
because that's where I want to plant my trees and all the fun stuff.
So, you know, shit changes, man. So always to kind of think it out before you really lock in on planting on your land and stuff.
You were talking earlier about the animal corridors on your property, Marco, you know, that you spent time there now and you've seen where the animals walk through, you know, you can see their trails and you can find their manures.
And we have enough wild rabbits here that I could gather up their little droppings.
Like they hang out in our driveway and shit all around the outside of our gardens.
Boom.
And so, you know, identifying those areas, like you said, so you disturb them so that nature can do its natural processes and come through there.
You know, we put a lot of water out around our garden so that the birds will come in, so they'll balance out a lot of our pest pressures.
You know, yeah, just trying to make use of as many of nature's systems as possible.
That's interesting. You mentioned that the game trails, you know, and like you said, yeah.
So what I did was if you picture the back of my property is kind of a row of cherry trees kind of just lying in a line, right?
In front of that is my kind of a food garden area.
And so what I noticed is from the back of my property, the animals just come in and they walk right along that straight line of cherry trees and pass on through.
Deer, well deer will stop and do their thing.
But now when I'm creating my fence, I'm just going to let that game trail remain.
And that fence is just going to go up right next to it tall enough and down in the ground to keep the animals out.
You know, instead of sometimes you don't want to fight nature.
Like if I were to all of a sudden crash that game trail and then now try to wall it off.
Well, it's just like water. Water is not going to hit a wall and stop.
Water is going to go one way or the other, find another way.
And animals and nature can be the same way.
So, you know, it's kind of the mindset I have, you know, when I'm thinking about it.
Yeah, like we got a we got a manure question real quick to answer that for the cranium melts.
The rabbit manure and alpaca manure, I would imagine, is the same with lava.
I'm not 100 percent sure on that, if you know, Joey.
But that's a cold manure, meaning that as soon as it comes out of the animal, you can start using it as a fertilizer right away.
Feeding a worm bin, if you want to kind of just play around with stuff and see for yourself how beneficial manures are.
And if you're brand new to this insect frass, that's the same thing as that's a manure.
Right. Worm castings is a manure.
So there's a lot of fancy words that are used where reality is we're just all using manures because that's where a lot of the secret sauce is for taking cannabis to the next level.
You want to add on anything with what you've been doing, Marco?
Do you dry it out or anything?
No, I don't. It's not necessary to dry it out.
Like when I flip, I just flip the cannabis bed and I took it and combined it with a couple of other things like coral sand and just a few other little amendments.
And I put it on there wet, you know what I mean?
But what I did is I'm giving that a week, about a week before I plant that plant just to be safe.
But you can go right against the plants and be fine with rabbit manure.
I would imagine this is for Joey.
Well, the way we use that bunny manure, the chicken manure, a lot of those manures, but the bunny especially, like you said, being cold, you can use it right away.
We do just the extract.
An extract tea, basically a compost extract tea.
We just put it in a tea bag or a filter bag and massage it into a bucket of water, you know, a five gallon bucket.
Massage it into that water for about 10 minutes.
And then we'll dilute that 10 to one into like a 50 gallon drum and water with that.
But you're getting all that nitrogen, you're getting all that biology that came from the stomach of that bunny rabbit into your soil.
And a really easy way to use that stuff and to get a, make it go a long mile.
You know, you can do a lot with a little bag.
I'm talking a little bag like this, just a couple of pounds of that bunny poop in a five gallon bucket will make a 50 gallon drum of that biology and that nitrogen for us.
So, and that's really diluted.
You could do a more concentrated dose, but we dilute it, spread it around the garden.
That's one of the ways we're adding biology to the garden.
Yeah, the way I do it, just to clarify, the way I do it with the mulch is just for basically my shredders come in there, get up in there and shred it on down.
But I like that mixing, massaging, I get the hands in there.
I like that.
Joey, do you guys incorporate bat houses in your permaculture design?
No, but we have a lot of bats here.
We have a lot of trees.
There's just a lot of bats here naturally, but absolutely, everybody should incorporate bat houses, owl houses.
These are easy tools we can definitely add to our system.
Bats are great.
If you can gather that bat manure, that bat guano, it's an incredibly powerful high nitrogen fertilizer.
And the stuff you buy from the stores is often really harvested in a really unsustainable fashion.
Employees really taking advantage of and the bats are really damaged by how they harvest it.
They harvest during the day.
So, yeah, another one of those inputs that might have a little blood on its hands.
Just another reason we got to be really mindful of where all our inputs come from for growing these plants that we're throwing all these inputs at.
I guess I'll probably throw this over to Marco since you're saying you're not really the bunny guy.
The rabbit urine, when you get them to be potty trained, is fantastic for the worm bin.
But you would almost need one bunny per worm bin.
So if you had like four bunnies and they were all peeing in the same worm bin, that would cause an issue.
So I think for the average person, one bunny is going to be plenty.
And you can feed them to your heart's content and then they will poop.
It's a very easy process to speed up the pooping.
You just feed them a little bit more and they love it.
Life is good on both sides.
Dilute that urine, though.
That urine is really strong.
Definitely dilute that.
And a way to play around with that is if you're brand new to this or newer to this, just get them to be potty trained and allow the worms and the life in the worm bin to break things down.
And then somebody was asking, you can litter box train them?
Yes, but again, the breed matters.
Or from my experience, the breed really matters for indoor.
So you want to think that through.
Everybody's been to a house where like the animals pee.
There's no mistaking it.
And that could potentially happen when you add some of the dumber rabbits.
Anything on that, Marco?
Rabbit pens can stink.
Yeah, it's going to stink if you're not on top of it.
What are your plans for the future on your property?
What do you plan to do?
Yeah, well, lots of events coming up.
We're also making plans for our small personal use garden, which we grow a lot of our food in.
And then this hemp license, which allows up to, I think, a quarter acre.
But we're only going to be doing a very small amount, maybe two thousand square feet of actual hemp this year.
Tamara just needs a little bit for her product line.
But we're going to tie that in with this Centropic planting.
We're hoping to plant one or two of these permanent tree lines in that system.
Yeah, that's kind of the short term goals.
We're going to be starting our seeds for our big full term plants on February 20th.
Keep the new moons right around then.
And yeah, that's kind of the earliest we usually start stuff to grow a big full term plant here in Northern California without having to use any supplemental lighting or anything.
How do you start those seeds growing for the big girls?
Directly in soil.
I'll usually make my own soil blocks out of a variety of materials.
Kind of depends on what we have available.
I made them here last year.
Yeah.
Some earthworm castings.
A little bit of we have these pine trees here that have these big pine cones that fall and the squirrels here.
Eat them right at the base of these trees.
You'll find like these graveyards of these pine cones and all the little leaves off of it.
And it's this IMO graveyard.
You start digging in that and it's all decomposed like years of this decomposed material.
So I use a little bit of that in that in those soil blockers.
Tamara also had like a three, four year old human manure pile.
I use a little bit of that human manure compost in those soil blocks.
So mixed with a little bit of old potting soil.
And so those soil blockers the way to go.
I got to let the dog out really quick.
I'll be right back.
I got a question for London.
Are you available?
Are you cooking?
So, okay.
So in general, what are your plans for the property?
He mentioned that a couple of times.
You got to know that.
So what do you look for?
I like your suggestion was putting a whole bunch of stuff down.
My thought is I'm just going to every couple of weeks just throw a whole bunch of mix.
I want to get like I have an area that I'm going to try and like I want olive tree.
I want blood orange tree there.
So there's some specifics that I want.
I'm debating on whether or not I'm going to try and do that from seed for oranges.
It's a little bit like it will be seven years until I add something.
So I'm debating on popping down a few bedded trees that have been like from a local nursery that are ready to go.
Some olives and some grape is the base and then just kind of see what goes and kind of let things, you know, get natural and go back to figure out what they're doing and where they're at.
It's it's it's my biggest concern is water.
My biggest fear is is lack of water.
We like I'm close enough to miss the pallidy so that I know that there is water.
I don't know how much water if there's water restrictions during certain points of year and how much of that is is effective because, you know, an acre acre lot doesn't take that much.
But at the same time, you know, if it's been very traditionally far, my husband had the ability to like create that humid slayer to lock some of that in.
Right. So I want to make sure to kind of get that layer building as quickly as possible.
And I figure if I still let what live, live and let what die, die and let it feed the soil and kind of let it go natural for a bit, probably piss off my neighbors.
But, you know, I don't care.
The Italy is interesting because it's been so.
Like, it's just been cleared, like the whole thing has been cleared and rebuilt.
Right. So it's it's there's not a lot of naturalness.
There's not a lot of forestry.
You know, like there's there's little brooks, but everything's been farmed at one point or another.
So it's a it's a little bit different than than out here where we have, you know, a lot more like my friend has a farm, Che, you know, unicorn cup and his rosebud farm is is one acre lot is completely surrounded by wilderness.
Like he's on the side of a mountain surrounded by wilderness.
So when it comes to locking in, you know, a lot of these really amazing regenerative practices where we have, you know, IPM that's self-maintaining, you know, like it takes care of itself.
It really does. But if you're in the middle of a farmer's farmed agricultural space where you're surrounded by traditionally farm methodology, you're going to run into a lot different pest pressure, a lot different challenge.
So he says one of the reasons why he picked that spot is because it was so far out there and it was so far away from any other lot that he would be able to seize that opportunity, use the local area and take advantage of of that area.
And so that's what I want to do. But it's it's Italy. So my neighbors are farming traditionally, you know, and that's that's just the fact.
So I got to try and figure out how to work with that a little bit, too.
I like that. Yeah. Got to stick with that native, native action.
Definitely.
Joey, we need you to plug yourself and Tamara, all your Instagrams and your websites and Patreons and all that.
Sure. Well, Tamara had to run and go pick up the kiddo from school. So she's bummed she had to bounce. She might be back here momentarily.
You can find Tamara on Instagram at Heal underscore Thyself Gardens. Heal Thyself Gardens is her herbal brand.
She makes all kinds of incredible tinctures and topicals and smoking blends.
And she's an incredible herbalist, a decade of decade plus of experience.
And she grows everything herself. She grows almost everything herself.
So she's an incredible CBD line, real medicine and works with a lot of patients one on one.
So you can hit her up at Heal Thyself Gardens. She's got a Web site. You can do a lot of shopping on there.
She's got a Shopify. Yes, there's her Instagram at Heal underscore Thyself Gardens.
And you can find her Web site right through there.
We also have a Patreon that we just started that's contributed to her, myself, our landmates, Mettle and Sierra.
I got the chihuahua bark in here now. I have to let her in too.
And if you go to Patreon, it's Patreon slash Thrive Homestead Community.
And we're all contributing to it in our different ways.
And then if you join there, you can come to our events and that's where we post in about it as well as on our Instagram.
My Instagram is the Humboldt local 2.0.
I've got my own Patreon where I do a lot of my own teaching at the Humboldt local on Patreon.
I think those are the main things we want to plug.
Our next event is February 26th. We're having a tasting here at the farm.
With our special guest, original gangster of Stay Fly Farms, one of our favorite breeders and regenerative growers out of Oregon.
He's making his first appearance in California.
Somebody that we have a ton of respect for. We breed with a lot of his genetics.
Tamar and I both do. We've been breeding with a lot of Stay Fly's gear for the last few years.
So we love these guys. We're super excited to have them now.
And do that tasting with us. We're going to be doing some walks around our farm. Some plant walks.
Sierra, our landmate, is a ceramicist.
And she's going to be giving a talk on using clay. The clay that we have here on the land to make ceramics with.
And we're going to be doing some natural building workshops later in the summer.
So we'll be talking about that. How to use that clay to build houses.
And a construction process called cob construction.
A natural building process.
February 26th is the next banger coming up.
March, we're having a little music festival here. End of March called Moondust.
It's going to be a couple days of music that our other landmate, Noble Hayes, is putting on.
And there will be some workshops. But it's more of a music festival with some workshops attached.
And then April 422, we're going to do the Cured Cup.
And that's going to be a sesh, a bunch of vendors, some killer music, and this cannabis competition for cured flower.
We'll find out who's really the master at the craft of growing and curing their flower.
That's going to be pretty exciting.
That's what we got through April.
June, we're hoping to do another two-day regen camp here with some of our friends and really dive into a good little camp out.
These camps, we cover a lot of the inputs that we use in our cultivation.
Pulling from JDOM, pulling from KNF, covering Google culture.
Talking about a lot of things that aren't covered in just one modality.
We talk a lot about permaculture. We really open those workshops talking about permaculture and a lot of these permaculture principles that we talked about today.
And how all these farming modalities fall under that heading for us.
We're really excited for that.
Tomorrow's going to be hosting a medicine camp here in September that's going to be all about medicine making.
Primarily focused on cannabis. Bringing in a bunch of our favorite herbalists for that.
We want to do another hash camp. Hash camp was a total blast. We did that in December.
It was really well received. Tamara taught Temple Balls alongside Kush Kirk.
We had rosin demos and dry sift and full washing demos. It was incredible.
We want to keep building on that and help spread that knowledge.
If you guys have noticed that all the last big hash competitions, it's regenerative farmers that are winning.
It's people practicing natural farming, practicing JDOM and KNF are the ones taking home the trophies.
And that's no mistake and that's no coincidence.
These practices lead to the best resin.
And I think we all need to be talking about that more and acknowledging that more.
I know this group does it. I appreciate all of you.
You know what? People are saying you want to win some of those trophies.
You want to win some of those hash cups.
Let me get a trophy first.
I need my old brand.
We can do some rapid fire questions here and also wrap it up.
I guess this is also thinking on because of all of the chicken eggs recently.
What are your thoughts on raising quail eggs for the meat?
Have you tried it?
Sounds great. I haven't done it.
Our homies, Triple G Genetics, the Golden Turp, they raise quail.
And they're telling us how easy it is recently and how it's awesome.
So we might pursue that.
Definitely a nice small scaled operation for a nice small property.
And something that your kids could probably take care of.
So I like this.
I'm going to start talking about that around here.
Mr. Westport wants to know how long do you think you are?
I'll just read it. To what age do they think they will be able to maintain this lifestyle and property upkeep?
Well, hopefully if we start moving in the direction of these centropic plantings,
these are systems that generate their own fertility.
Or eventually the only maintenance to them is going to be harvesting and pruning and resetting the system.
So, yeah, and the biggest input will be labor.
That hopefully we can provide jobs to other people or other community members.
So we're hoping that that's the direction we're heading.
Where the input is just creating jobs, more than anything.
Yeah, but it's hard right now.
It's not getting any easier.
I can tell you that.
It was a lot easier when there was a lot more money to do all these amazing things.
Now it takes a lot more hard work.
That's why we got to use those JADAM methods so we can afford some equipment as we get older.
No longer spend money on cultivation.
Not like we used to.
We got to get smarter about it.
Any of you guys growing the kookamelons?
Never heard of a kookamelon.
They grow wild here.
So yes, they grow on my fence every spring.
Some people grow them purposefully, but I don't have to.
They just kind of pop up.
People eat them.
Sounds like an easy organic food source.
Yeah, yeah, definitely.
They look like miniature watermelons and they got stripes.
Don't eat them when they turn all the way dark.
If they're black, don't eat them.
This question is for probably Marco and Joey.
Yeah, I don't know about that.
When we do labs, we'll often add it in with our JMS and our JLF at the same time.
Ideally, if you're going to apply before a rain or apply before a watering of water, you want that to go deep into your soil as much as possible.
I don't know.
Do you have an answer for that, Marco?
Yeah, I agree about the same.
Just kind of get it down deep if you do use it or when you do.
But like you, man, I make so many ferments and different vinegars and I'm making all, you know, I've got plenty of LAB.
It's everywhere.
I don't necessarily go out of my way to add it.
Yeah, fences.
Fencing is the only thing that we find to work out here or put your garden up in a tree.
Double fence.
Yeah.
Is that what you're about to say?
Yeah.
We're in fire country.
We have a really thick forest here that hasn't been managed for a long time.
So it's overgrown, massively overgrown.
So we spend a lot of the year thinning out these dead trees and thinning out the forest.
And we're using, we're creating a lot of what we call junk pole.
You know, we take these poles and cut the branches off, cut them to a certain length, and now we can build stuff with them.
One of the things we build is what's called junk pole fence.
And you should Google this on YouTube.
Created by Paul Wheaton up in Montana, a permaculture educator.
And it's a super simple fence that you can build with this junk pole.
Up there, they have all these poles.
They get paid to remove them up there out of the national forest because they're a fire hazard.
They get killed by the pine beetle up there, these pine trees.
Here we have that little bit too, but not as bad.
Nobody's paying us to do it.
We're just doing it for the fire protection.
But once again, we're not going to just burn that wood.
That's a valuable resource.
We're turning this waste stream into a resource by processing it.
So we've been slowly building fences out of that junk pole fence.
It's a little more labor intensive, mostly the cutting of the wood.
But we haven't had to cut anything and haul it too far.
We have so much thinning we have to do right around the immediate homestead, our zone two and three.
Our zone one being right around the house.
Zone two and three being a little farther spread out.
So we're making good use of that.
That's how we're handling our deer protection.
It's just labor intensive.
We're not going to be able to do the big hemp gardens.
We're only doing a small part of the garden this year.
So we're hoping to do some workshops around it because it is fun to do.
I mean, you see these poles literally slide in place without any fastening.
You do minimal screws to hold these things in place.
And then a lot of the poles just slide in there.
And it's kind of a living fence.
It takes a little maintenance.
You got to show a little love here and there and adjust it.
But it's beautiful.
The sections that we have of it are really beautiful.
And yeah, we look forward to teaching some more of that this summer.
Marco, anything you want to add with the deer protection?
Yes.
Start a small garden that you can afford to put a proper fence around instead of trying to be all over your property and deer tearing your ass up.
You know, if you think about it.
Because Joey just said it and I'm doing the same thing.
I've condensed the space that I'm actually going to grow that good food that deer love.
Because fencing is expensive, man.
And I want to do it right.
And I want it to look good, you know, because where I'm at functionality is the main thing.
But yeah, double line and that's the main thing.
And make sure that'll really do it.
Because like this fence will work here.
We don't have pigs.
But where I just moved from at Humboldt, we have these wild pigs.
And they would go right under this fence.
Don't fall.
So making sure you got the right fence for the right predator or the right pest or whatever you're dealing with.
Because a lot of places on the West Coast still have these wild pigs, these feral pigs.
They're gnarly.
You see them on your property out there?
Up in Humboldt, Mendocino, much worse than here.
We don't have them here.
But yeah, up there, they'll do major damage.
Major damage.
So you all got mountain lion where you're at there.
Yeah, mountain lion.
That's sweet.
Man, I bet a few individuals have been fed to the pigs over the years in that area.
I'll bet.
Go through bone like butter.
So London, I see you're wrapping a kilo.
That's good to see live on the air.
Yeah.
Sending it over the pond.
Oh, you're muted, buddy.
But you know, what's really funny is actually in BC, speaking of pig farming, is if you look up one of the greatest, no not greatest, but the most terrible Canadian serial killers of all time was a Picton pig farmer, which was like in our area.
I don't know why I segued there, but there was an opportunity to throw a weird fact out.
Had to take it.
I saw that one.
I didn't know it was up in Canada.
I heard of that.
Always be afraid of a pig farmer.
Stay away.
Stay away from him.
All right.
So, yeah, we wrap this up here.
Joey, appreciate.
And Tamara, if you'd let her know, like, we really appreciate your time.
The community has learned from you for two years from when we first reached out to now.
So I hope that we are continuing to move on beyond that part of the title today so that more individuals see that this is something that is a skill set that you can get good at that eventually pass on to your children and still in them.
Like, where do you get your food?
If you're fortunate enough to have property?
I don't understand why you wouldn't be doing this.
I mean, just even a couple hours a day goes a long way.
You can be outside listening to music.
All the little nuances you do out there your day.
You can find time to get these things done.
And I think as that starts to progress, you'll fall in love like we have where, you know, farming, living life, just enjoying life, doing things for others is kind of where you find your purpose.
And I know that this show and this platform resonates that with the community because nobody has to pay for any of the knowledge from Peter's platform.
And he allows us to have full control over who we want to interview and who we want to talk to.
And every single person on his platform has that ability.
And I, there's not really too many of those opportunities left.
You know, there's usually some kind of like, what is it like?
What's the right word for that?
Censorship.
There's usually some kind of censorship where we can speak freely on whatever we want to talk about.
And we'd love to keep it positive.
And we love that the fact that there's so many individuals that want to come on here that have been doing it for so long that the community looks up to.
Joey and Tamar are a power couple.
That's the best word to use for them.
You know, and I hope that others see that in themselves when they start this journey or if they're in the journey right now.
Again, it's an up and down thing.
There's no like straight rocket to success and farming.
And, you know, in a way, if there is, then you're going to get busted.
Someone's knocking on your door too quick.
You can't grow too quickly in anything.
People take your head off.
So that's why I think, you know, slow and steady is for the cannabis farmer.
And natural farming is a slow and steady drip of information and education.
This is a lifelong kind of thing.
This is a belief system that you're now into on a daily basis so that you can get better weekly and monthly.
And that's the beauty of this that I've seen is that the community has started to grow because of the digital world.
And I always thought that that might not.
It's hard to find benefits sometimes in all of this technology.
But this is definitely a benefit in the fact that now people all over the world are starting to use words like natural farming, like Joey was mentioning.
Who the hell was saying that five, 10 years ago?
Well, definitely 10 years ago.
Even if you're talking like about living soil, you know, Dr. Laningham wasn't talking like that.
So there wasn't people that were kind of focused on the variety of things.
So, again, it was pigeonholed.
And we caution you on that.
Like if your mentor is only talking about themselves, then I don't know if that's going to be or should be the mentor for you.
Because that mentor definitely had people before them.
And if they're not also giving credit to Mother Nature and that kind of stuff, then just be cautious of that.
Spend your money how you want.
But remember that if you're just getting something that's regurgitated, why not just go to the source in the first place?
And the reality is that the source is cheaper.
Like those classes that Master Cho is teaching and the Cho family is teaching is fairly reasonable, in my opinion, for what they're offering.
It is reasonable for what they're offering.
So, yeah, check those things out.
And, you know, Marco, if you want to kind of finish that up.
Yeah, I just will say we'll let Joey get the last word.
But I want to say, man, I love this show.
And thank you for coming on, Joey.
And I learn something every show, man.
A couple of things I'm taking away from this one, many things.
Thank you for the history, the humble history, straight from humble.
I love things that come straight from the source, as we all know.
That's why I collect my own IMO.
But things I'm taking with this one, man, like usually I don't I hadn't really considered pine forest.
Right. But I always see the squirrel posts where they litter down, where they eat all the pine cones and they drop it down, like you said.
So now I'm going to go out and I'm going to look for those places that have been there forever.
Squirrels been up there eating, collecting my IMO from there.
And then one of our guys in the chat, I forget who it was, the bat boxes.
Like I remember, you know, as a kid, my dad put one up.
I told this story before I told him he get a wasp nest before he ever got a bat and he never got a bat.
But I want to build a good bat box that can sustain a bunch of bats and now be able to collect that.
I would go back to back one or if I collected my own.
Anyway, appreciate you, man. Thank you for all you share, brother.
I appreciate you guys. It's always a pleasure to chat with you and and all you guys are doing so much to move, you know, keep it, keep the keep the keep the movement moving, man.
And in a good direction, we need more strong voices for the soil and for the microbes.
And you guys are those voices. So tomorrow.
And I both appreciate all that you guys put in. I know a lot of time and effort goes in to do this weekend week out.
And, yeah, once again, big, big shout out to Peter and Future Cannabis Project as well.
And everybody else that works behind the scenes, because it's a great community.
We appreciate all the support that we get. And we've met just incredible people through this that, you know, give us the inspiration every day to keep doing what we do and having a lot of fun while we do it.
So once again, big ups, all you guys. Appreciate you.
London, you got anything else to say before we head out? All right.
Thank you, guys. See you guys next week. We've got a reptile show this weekend in Loveland.
So for you guys that are really getting into the bioactive, that's the same thing as living soil on this side of the fence.
But, yeah, bioactive is the next level. Understanding what Marco's talking about, what Joey's talking about,
what London now is taking to the next level because he has his own land.
These are movements that you can make for your family.
And I hope that more of you start to see that that's kind of or I hope that that's the end goal in life.
It's like, yes, you want a little bit of money in your pocket, but what are you kind of passing on?
And are you giving something that's not only just a house, but a home?
You know, it's great to have large houses and stuff like that. But I really have felt like those are homes.
It's usually like very showy type stuff where this is, you know, you're building this home. It's a lifestyle.
I know that London is going to be passing on a lot of things, maybe even subconsciously to his children about where their food is coming from.
A slower lifestyle than probably American children are forced into.
So just hats off to you for making that big jump. I know it's like two weeks away, buddy.
So I just wanted to put that last little caveat in there.
Here's all going to be a falling out in three weeks.
Stress for sure. All right. We'll see you guys next week.
Lily, out of there. Dog out. Lily, come here.
You.
