[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  You are first in and the master moderator for making sure everybody gets buttoned up and ready to go while I set up the YouTube site. I appreciate you.
[00:11.000 --> 00:16.000]  Hello everyone, hope you're doing well today. We have an awesome day ahead of us.
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.000]  Hopefully you brought your questions, your notepads, your papers, and you have some challenging ones for us today.
[00:23.000 --> 00:30.000]  We have Dr. Anna and Jason already on stage ready to go. I'm excited, you should be excited.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  Get those questions in there now, no matter how hard. The harder the better.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  Let's fuck these asses up and make it god damn challenging.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  Without any further ado, I'm going to let them roll in and see if we can get some great hard questions for them today.
[01:02.910 --> 01:17.910]  Which I would be excited for.
[01:17.910 --> 01:25.910]  But yes, there we go, we are live. I believe Joanna and Jason, do you want to say hello for me?
[01:26.910 --> 01:32.500]  You caught me mid smoke, but sure.
[01:32.500 --> 01:37.500]  It's a great way to start the evening everybody. Good evening, good evening, good evening.
[01:37.500 --> 01:42.500]  Welcome, welcome, welcome everybody. This is the Future Cannabis Project.
[01:42.500 --> 01:51.500]  We are live and recorded on FCP02, the Future Cannabis Project 02 channel on YouTube.
[01:52.500 --> 01:57.500]  We're here every week on Wednesday nights at 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific.
[01:57.500 --> 02:05.500]  We always bring a panel of folks to try to answer your cannabis questions.
[02:05.500 --> 02:10.500]  We try to get as many different types of questions as possible.
[02:10.500 --> 02:16.500]  Simple questions, beginning grower questions, intermediate, difficult questions.
[02:17.500 --> 02:31.500]  We do have Dr. Anibus with us, so anybody who's really, really into the genetics and where the plant came from and stuff like that would be great if we could get some questions to stump her with.
[02:32.500 --> 02:45.500]  London is our primary master of ceremonies and holding things down on the YouTube side for us, helping produce the show every week along with Peter on the Future Cannabis Project.
[02:48.500 --> 02:52.500]  Well, thank you so much for that awesome introduction and great start.
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.500]  And like I said over on the YouTube side, we are up and rolling everybody.
[02:55.500 --> 03:00.500]  Oh my god, that's like three in a row bot, Russian bots right off the bat.
[03:00.500 --> 03:04.500]  I don't know if they're Russian, but it looks like it with the typing that they're doing.
[03:04.500 --> 03:07.500]  But anyways, regardless, I'm excited for today. It should be great fun.
[03:07.500 --> 03:13.500]  I've got some questions that we got off of Dagadot Academy, which is one place that you can submit them.
[03:13.500 --> 03:19.500]  You can also submit them in comments of this show or actually right now in live chat.
[03:19.500 --> 03:26.500]  If you have anything and you want to make sure your questions get answered, I would definitely ask them sooner than later because then you'll get them first on the list.
[03:26.500 --> 03:29.500]  And we have some challenging ones and interesting ideas.
[03:29.500 --> 03:34.500]  Now, I do have a few others joining us on the panel today that are running a little bit behind.
[03:34.500 --> 03:46.500]  This four o'clock start here at PST is a little bit tough for some of those whole for some of the West Coast industry people, especially when they're starting to look at getting to work here.
[03:46.500 --> 03:52.500]  So we'll see how long they take to get in. But I've been told that they'll be following up shortly.
[03:52.500 --> 03:56.500]  So I'm excited for that one. Speaking of the speak of one of the devils, there's Johnny there.
[03:56.500 --> 04:01.500]  Now, I wanted to just like right off the bat.
[04:01.500 --> 04:10.500]  And there's a great question that that came up and I and I think it's really well directed towards you.
[04:10.500 --> 04:15.500]  And it's specifically about variegation. But I think it's a little bit misinterpreted here.
[04:15.500 --> 04:34.500]  So I thought it'd be really cool to just jump right off the bat and and make you work hard at the start, because often you get to sit and take a back seat here and talk a little bit about mutation and how the whole how all of that works and how they can be either beneficial or negative.
[04:34.500 --> 04:43.500]  And that, you know, some misinterpretations that are happening today can really cause problems when we're looking at plants in general.
[04:43.500 --> 04:48.500]  I think it's interesting that there's a lot of people that throw throw stuff away that I don't think is necessary.
[04:48.500 --> 04:56.500]  So I'm always excited to get in there. So if you have a question and you're in the audience, or if you have a question and you're in chat, go ahead and drop that question now.
[04:56.500 --> 05:09.500]  Pop it into chat. Come on over. The link is in the description. Come on over and ask your question live here, because that's the great part about Future Cannabis Project and the Clubhouse app is you're able to come over and enjoy the conversation as well.
[05:09.500 --> 05:22.500]  So no, no question too big, no question too small. I love it. Challenging at heart. So I'm looking forward to it. So Dr. Anubis, what the fuck's with mutations?
[05:22.500 --> 05:25.500]  That's a very large question.
[05:25.500 --> 05:27.500]  Thanks.
[05:27.500 --> 05:34.500]  Thanks for throwing a really actually a cool question at me from the get go.
[05:34.500 --> 05:43.500]  All right, so something to think about with mutations and something that comes along with the term mutations is that it's a negative thing.
[05:43.500 --> 05:57.500]  Mutations are random. They don't happen. Like, the plant is not reacting to anything. There is no like agenda for a mutation. They just happen. They happen all the time.
[05:58.500 --> 06:15.500]  And they are either deleterious, neutral, or adventitious. If they're, okay, and they happen in, so if you think of a whole organism, they happen in, hold on, let me get up. This is a huge question.
[06:15.500 --> 06:32.500]  If you think of a whole cell that is dividing all the time in a whole organism, there are mutations that happen. If that mutation in a cell in a whole organism is a bad mutation, that cell will be tagged for cell death, which really amounts to nothing.
[06:32.500 --> 06:55.500]  Like, that's fine. That happens all the time. Where mutations really have an effect is when it happens in the germ cells, so the sex cells, so the pollen or the, and the ovum in humans that would be the sperm and the egg.
[06:55.500 --> 07:09.500]  If the mutation happens during meiosis and those mutations are in those germ cells, that's where we really see a really strong effect, whether it be deleterious or adventitious.
[07:09.500 --> 07:33.500]  If it's deleterious, generally the resulting offspring won't make it to be a thing, or it will be a thing, but it will be a really fucked up thing, or it will be a thing that maybe doesn't, when it reaches reproductive age, it can't reproduce because its reproduction has been hindered.
[07:33.500 --> 07:52.500]  So, when we talk about mutations, you really have to think about what kind of mutation are you talking about, because it can happen, like, in your arm. In your arm, for example, there are trillions of cells. There could be a mutation in one of your skin cells. It's not going to amount to anything. It's not really a bad thing.
[07:52.500 --> 08:03.500]  But if it happens in enough cells, or there's one cell that keeps dividing and dividing and dividing with these mutations, you might get a tumor, let's say, and that's not a good thing.
[08:04.500 --> 08:32.500]  So, you kind of have to think about what are we talking about. So, if we're talking about a mutation that arises from the beginning, so the seed has a mutation in it, and then when it grows, like in variegation, like you're talking about, that plant might grow and have weird looking leaves that have sort of a patchy appearance, because some of those cells are not going to be able to reproduce.
[08:33.500 --> 08:49.500]  So, you might have a gene that's turned off, perhaps, that's for pigmentation. And so, some of those cells end up being, well, some of those, that tissue ends up being white, some of it ends up being green, and you get this segregated appearance.
[08:49.500 --> 09:15.500]  There is nothing wrong with that. Those plants generally survive just fine. It depends on how ubiquitous that mutation is. So, you can have a full on mutation where the chlorophyll just doesn't happen, and you would end up with a full albino, a white plant in that case, and that plant's not going to survive, because you have to have chlorophyll in a plant that requires photosynthesis to live.
[09:16.500 --> 09:37.500]  So, sometimes you'll see white little sprouts, very occasionally, and those sprouts won't make it very long. Sometimes you'll see plants with variegated leaves, that patchy appearance where you have white and green. Lots of houseplants are very popular. They've been bred to have that variegation, and there's quite a few tropical plants that have natural variegation.
[09:38.500 --> 10:02.500]  Variegation can be purple and green or white and green. So, those are mutations that show up in different ratios in leaves. That's fine. But a lot of people in the cannabis world think that variegation is caused by a virus every single time.
[10:03.500 --> 10:23.500]  That's not always true. It could be a mutation. It could be a virus. So, if you see variegation, it's important to know a little bit of background about where that plant came from, what's going on. You could do a viroid or a virus test.
[10:24.500 --> 10:33.500]  You could find out that perhaps that lineage has a natural variegation. Chemdog is a really good example of a lineage that has a natural variegation to it.
[10:34.500 --> 10:42.500]  And, you know, so many people don't know the virus. It's not a virus.
[10:43.500 --> 10:56.500]  Cannabis companies that test for things like viruses and viroids don't even offer a TMV test because it's a waste of money, basically.
[10:57.500 --> 11:17.500]  There are very, very few positive tests of TMV in cannabis. It's a very contagious virus that generally affects the sole and ACA family. So, the potato, tomato, nightshade family, which is not particularly closely related to cannabis.
[11:18.500 --> 11:28.500]  If it is a virus, it's more likely to be like a hot plate virus or the cucumber virus. There is now a hemp virus that's going around.
[11:30.500 --> 11:35.500]  TMV, you're talking, yeah, TMV is tobacco mosaic virus, correct?
[11:36.500 --> 11:45.500]  Yes. And then there is now a hemp mosaic virus, which is showing up a lot more often, which is a little bit of a concern.
[11:45.500 --> 11:58.500]  But the general variegation that you see in terms of like what a virus would present as, like look at the rest of the plant.
[11:59.500 --> 12:09.500]  Because those viruses don't usually present with just variegated leaves. They also start growth. The plant's generally unhealthy. There's a lot more to it.
[12:09.500 --> 12:14.500]  So, anyway, I think, London, that's where you're getting at. Like mutations are not always bad.
[12:15.500 --> 12:36.500]  They present in different ways. And depending on whether we're talking about somatic mutation, which is a localized mutation, like, for example, faciation, that weird crested growth thing, not a polyploid, that weird crested growth thing that you might see on mostly the top colloid where you're going to see it.
[12:37.500 --> 12:45.500]  That's a localized mutation that leads to a weird growth pattern. It's not bad. It's not good. It's just there.
[12:49.500 --> 12:54.500]  Yeah, but variegation is not always bad. It's not always a mutation. It's not always a virus.
[12:57.500 --> 12:59.500]  Yeah. All right. I'm done rambling.
[13:00.500 --> 13:14.500]  No, I think that's great because I get people who reach out all the time. It's like just a little bit of a curl to a leaf or it looks a little funky. It's like you better have your parents tested for this virus. I'm like, you know, it's a little bit out of control.
[13:15.500 --> 13:35.500]  I think I heard a stat of something like maybe 5% of plants might be infected with hopslate and virus, a viroid. And there's a lot of attention around some of these things because they catch people's attention, but not necessarily always the case.
[13:36.500 --> 13:54.500]  And I think a lot of people want to jump to it. I've heard similar things where, you know, even if you see the leaves kind of taco a little bit, it's like, oh my God, you're infected. You've got root aphids. There's just all these different things that go around. So I'm glad you brought that up, Dr. Hannibus. That's great to add on.
[13:55.500 --> 14:10.500]  Yeah, a lot of people, Jason, I find they like to try to diagnose problems with one piece of information. And usually that one piece of information is a picture.
[14:11.500 --> 14:33.500]  And, you know, if you talk to somebody who's got experience in diagnosing plant disorder, like nutrient disorders or pathogens or pests, they usually, when someone posts something like that, a picture and they're asking for help, they usually follow up with more questions, not necessarily a diagnosis right away.
[14:34.500 --> 14:56.500]  So I think that, yeah, just trying to judge whether something, you know, like a variegation is the result of a virus or a viroid versus if it's just a mutation. It's, you know, I would just take that with those types of, you know, advice or input from someone else with a grain of salt.
[14:57.500 --> 15:19.500]  Because usually you can't just tell from a picture. I, you know, personally working with a lot of plants that had hoplate and viroid, you know, it would get to a point where I could kind of pick them out in a crowd of, you know, a hundred plants. I'd be able to see out of the hundred plants. There's, you know, a couple in there that I'm like, okay, that really looks to be like infected with hoplate and viroid.
[15:20.500 --> 15:34.500]  But it's not just looking at that one plant in isolation that I would be able to tell that. So I think that, you know, that just, yeah, like I was saying, just take that type of diagnosis from a picture with a grain of salt.
[15:38.700 --> 15:53.700]  I love how deep we went on to that. And Dr. Anubis, I loved how I just threw the question. You went there. Everybody super appreciated it. I actually brought up, I'd like to also welcome Erica to say, Dr. Anubis, did you have a response there before I grab these other questions?
[15:54.700 --> 16:06.700]  Well, something that, so I talked about this, I think a little bit either last week, and I don't know if it was in the Dank Hour. I think Damon and I might've been going back and forth on this.
[16:07.700 --> 16:28.700]  But there was a recent paper that came out in Nature that said that mutations are showing that there is evolutionary bias. And I want to say that I personally disagree with that finding because, as I said, mutations are generally, like, they're one of three things.
[16:28.700 --> 16:44.700]  And then no plant has no control, just like we have no control over mutations. They're either deleterious, neutral, or adventitious. If they're adventitious, they're going to show up more in the population.
[16:45.700 --> 17:00.700]  This is population genetics we're talking about, not just on the individual level. But they will start to show up more in the population because those individuals that have the adventitious mutation are going to have that advantage over the other individuals that don't have that mutation.
[17:01.700 --> 17:20.700]  On the other hand, individuals with the deleterious mutation, such as something that affects their ability to reproduce, or they just look ugly and nobody wants to touch them, or whatever the case may be, those individuals are not going to make it to reproductive age, or they're not going to reproduce.
[17:21.700 --> 17:37.700]  And so that mutation is not going to show up in the population because it's deleterious. It's going to go away. So this paper is saying that there is an evolutionary advantage to mutations because those show up more often. Because, yeah, they have an advantage.
[17:38.700 --> 18:02.700]  So somebody brought this up to me and I just want to reiterate, evolution is a change over time. And if it's a good change, it'll move something forward. If it's a bad change, it'll go away. So as an evolutionary biologist, I just want to reiterate, this is not something with an agenda. It's just how shit works.
[18:03.700 --> 18:13.700]  I love how you tried to be subtle about your swear words there for a moment. But you don't have to be. You're not in the office of the super professional. This is a casual space.
[18:13.700 --> 18:15.700]  I'm a lady, goddammit!
[18:15.700 --> 18:25.700]  You're a fucking lady, goddammit! But I do have another question that's super related to this subject that I think is actually, from your perspective, would be a great point.
[18:26.700 --> 18:39.700]  Maybe it's a little bit of a challenging one too. But question, Local Grower Guy asks, question, do you think with all the breeding that's been happening, we are losing genetics in that process?
[18:39.700 --> 18:49.700]  Thank you, Local Grower Guy, for your question. This is an interesting question. I'm going to let you answer it first, Dr. Anubis, but I'm sure the whole panel will have a little bit of an opinion here.
[18:49.700 --> 18:53.700]  Say it again. Ask it again, sorry.
[18:54.700 --> 19:12.700]  The question was, do you think in bottlenecking that everybody speaks of, I'm over elaborating the words a little bit here to give it some more context. Do you think that with the breeding, we are losing genetics in the process? Through this bottlenecking, through this, that we're losing potential genetics in the process?
[19:13.700 --> 19:41.700]  This is my opinion, and I 100% say no. I actually think with all of the hybridization and specific selection for specific traits that may or may not show up in individuals, and then breeding them for that specific trait and then reselecting them, I actually think we are broadening the traits that we would see if everything was in a natural population.
[19:42.700 --> 20:00.700]  The way that cannabis is wind pollinated, it's everywhere. If it was just left to its own devices and we had nothing to do with it, I feel like we would have just populations of pretty much the same thing, for lack of a better term.
[20:01.700 --> 20:16.700]  The fact that we are picking and choosing and breeding and bringing out traits that wouldn't normally be seen and amplifying them in certain strains, I actually think we're doing the opposite of creating a bottleneck. I think we are diversifying it.
[20:17.700 --> 20:33.700]  It's not only on the high THC recreational medical side, even in the fiber and seed and oil side. We're selecting this plant for all kinds of different things.
[20:34.700 --> 20:48.700]  To me, there is no other single species, maybe dogs and cats, but I think we're actually creating more diversity that wouldn't actually show up in nature, in my humble opinion.
[20:49.700 --> 20:58.700]  There is a follow-up here that was asked. I realize my mic has been open the whole time. Hopefully, there hasn't been any feedback or noise there. My apologies.
[20:58.700 --> 21:09.700]  The real Mokoi asks, is this right in the zone? Could these trends bottleneck our trait selection in the future? Is it possible to bottleneck these things and cause these issues?
[21:10.700 --> 21:21.700]  There's been some breeding out of other things in the past that we've lost. Could these trends bottleneck things, make things harder?
[21:22.700 --> 21:36.700]  I feel like in the past, when everybody... Actually, the US is pretty late to the table as far as prohibition goes. They destroyed all the seeds that were tried to.
[21:37.700 --> 21:55.700]  The resurgence of trying to collect land races and natural diversity and put those into seed banks and maybe breed them into some of the modern plants that we're growing today.
[21:56.700 --> 22:11.700]  I feel like we may have lost some stuff, but I feel like there's a lot of things that we as humans are doing on a larger scale with other species where we're losing a lot more diversity.
[22:12.700 --> 22:23.700]  It's very sad that that went on. There's a lot of global effort to try and make sure that what we have left, we do conserve and preserve.
[22:24.700 --> 22:31.700]  I know that people are worried that we just have the genetics left with what we have now.
[22:32.700 --> 22:39.700]  There are some people that are holding onto seeds that are waiting in the wings to make sure that genetic diversity is preserved.
[22:40.700 --> 22:47.700]  I think we're okay. I do think we're okay. I don't think that we're going to run into a bottleneck.
[22:48.700 --> 23:02.700]  I think as people keep breeding and collecting for traits, yeah, there's a huge amount of different strains and cultivars and whatever you want to call them, blade races, whatever word.
[23:03.700 --> 23:20.700]  I actually think we're doing a great job of taking the diversity that is present in cannabis and spreading it out and not bottlenecking it, but doing the opposite.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.700]  At least that's the way it works in my mind.
[23:24.700 --> 23:27.860]  Awesome.
[23:28.860 --> 23:31.860]  I think that's an awesome angle. Go ahead, London. Sorry.
[23:32.860 --> 23:35.860]  No, no, no. I interrupted you. Go ahead, London.
[23:36.860 --> 23:41.860]  Yeah, yeah. No, I think it's great. Even some of the cannabinoids, right?
[23:42.860 --> 23:49.860]  We're isolating strains that are higher in certain cannabinoids that wouldn't necessarily be coming out naturally.
[23:50.860 --> 24:03.860]  I think another aspect of legalization, or at least opening up the markets more and more, is the possibility of growing larger populations.
[24:04.860 --> 24:17.860]  When you're illegal and when you're trying to limit your exposure, it's going to limit how much canopy, how much space, how many plants you can grow.
[24:18.860 --> 24:22.860]  Everybody knows that 99 plants was the federal number for a long time.
[24:22.860 --> 24:25.860]  If you went over 99 in most states, you'd go federal.
[24:26.860 --> 24:32.860]  There's extra penalties thrown on top after you went over those numbers.
[24:33.860 --> 24:38.860]  I think with legalization, we also have the opportunity to grow much, much larger populations of the plant,
[24:39.860 --> 24:46.860]  send those seeds out to multiple people in different environments, different zones, different places,
[24:47.860 --> 24:54.860]  and seeing how those cultivars perform under those different conditions as well, which you wouldn't get in a natural population.
[24:55.860 --> 24:57.860]  It's just going to be living where it's at.
[24:58.860 --> 25:07.860]  It's going to adapt to that environment as opposed to that cultivar that grew in that one place being grown in a hundred places, a thousand different places.
[25:08.860 --> 25:11.860]  I think in some aspects, I completely agree with you there, Dr. Adams.
[25:12.860 --> 25:15.860]  I wanted to add a comment on this, too.
[25:16.860 --> 25:26.860]  I think part of the fear that's being shown in this question, like, are we going to lose access to some genetics if we continue this breeding,
[25:27.860 --> 25:39.860]  comes from the idea of what's going to happen if we do end up refining our genetics, having true breeding parents, having true breeding cultivars.
[25:40.860 --> 25:54.860]  At that point, if you take those plants to seed, no, you won't see a large diversity in phenotypes or genotypes in the offspring for that generation.
[25:55.860 --> 26:01.860]  But that doesn't mean that we have to obliterate what those parents previously were.
[26:02.860 --> 26:18.860]  So our cultivars that we have now, they're not true breeding, but we can start taking them down the breeding process and refine certain cultivars while still maintaining those wildly genetically diverse parents.
[26:19.860 --> 26:27.860]  Like, we don't have to lose the genetic diversity in the process of refining our genetics.
[26:28.860 --> 26:38.380]  Awesome. Well, that was a really amazing answer there.
[26:39.380 --> 26:40.380]  And we have a lot of things to do.
[26:41.380 --> 26:49.380]  Do we have any responses or further dive deeps into that before I do a quick little reset and get on to our next round of questions?
[26:50.380 --> 26:51.380]  Nobody at all?
[26:52.380 --> 26:53.380]  Nope.
[26:54.380 --> 26:55.380]  Cool. Awesome.
[26:56.380 --> 26:59.380]  So I just want to say thank everybody in the chat because you have been popping up some awesome questions.
[26:59.380 --> 27:00.380]  We're going to step back into that.
[27:01.380 --> 27:03.380]  But if you have any more questions, don't be afraid to pop them in the chat.
[27:04.380 --> 27:13.380]  And guess what? If you're in the audience and you have a question or a follow up or a comment about anything that we're talking about now, anything to do with cannabis, and I mean anything, it can get weird.
[27:14.380 --> 27:15.380]  I'm okay with that.
[27:16.380 --> 27:22.380]  Anything about cannabis, come on up and ask it because we'll dig in and talk about it here as best we can.
[27:23.380 --> 27:24.380]  And if we don't know, we won't.
[27:25.380 --> 27:26.380]  We'll be honest about it.
[27:26.380 --> 27:27.380]  But go ahead and do that.
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.380]  And if you are in the audience, you get priority for asking a question.
[27:30.380 --> 27:31.380]  It's not just the chat that can take over everything here.
[27:32.380 --> 27:33.380]  So don't be afraid to come up and do that.
[27:34.380 --> 27:36.380]  I always love adding a new voice to the stage.
[27:37.380 --> 27:41.380]  So our next question is coming up from Comfortably Numb.
[27:42.380 --> 27:45.380]  You asked a question earlier and we're going to scroll up to you.
[27:46.380 --> 27:49.380]  We have a very busy, busy chat.
[27:50.380 --> 27:52.380]  So give me just a moment while I just find the last question.
[27:53.380 --> 27:59.780]  Just a moment.
[28:00.780 --> 28:18.650]  Damn it, my mic was off and I was speaking.
[28:19.650 --> 28:27.650]  So Comfortably Numb asks, how long do you weave plants into a scrog net after you switch to 12-12?
[28:28.650 --> 28:32.650]  Or how do you know when to stop weaving your plants through a scrog net?
[28:33.650 --> 28:36.650]  I'm wondering, Johnny, you worked maybe a little bit with scrog nets.
[28:37.650 --> 28:39.650]  Do you want to hop in and start this one?
[28:40.650 --> 28:41.650]  Yeah, sure.
[28:42.650 --> 28:45.650]  I'm pretty familiar with scrogging.
[28:46.650 --> 28:48.650]  It's not my preferred route to go.
[28:49.650 --> 28:53.650]  But actually my last round of indoor, I used four plants in my four by eight bed,
[28:54.650 --> 28:56.650]  which is significantly less than I usually do.
[28:57.650 --> 29:03.650]  And when I'm going for that, I don't want the net, the first net to be fully filled out.
[29:04.650 --> 29:10.650]  Because you want to kind of take into consideration that it's going to be doing some extensive growing
[29:11.650 --> 29:12.650]  as it's transitioning.
[29:13.650 --> 29:22.650]  So I kind of am at like the three quarters filled out type of general guideline.
[29:23.650 --> 29:28.650]  I've done it before where I've scrogged and I filled the net out completely, 100%.
[29:29.650 --> 29:32.650]  Everything was, you know, every square was filled.
[29:33.650 --> 29:38.650]  And I had a lot of clearing of branches and leaves in order to get that.
[29:38.650 --> 29:41.650]  And my yields weren't exactly what I would have liked to have been.
[29:42.650 --> 29:48.650]  So I would say, yeah, like the three quarters mark is a good baseline that I like to go for.
[29:49.650 --> 29:56.660]  Awesome.
[29:57.660 --> 29:58.660]  Any other scrogger experience?
[29:59.660 --> 30:03.660]  Because this is like actually, you know, like a sea of green is a very common thing.
[30:04.660 --> 30:09.660]  But scrog is a lot more of a technical kind of prowess and it takes a little bit more.
[30:10.660 --> 30:11.660]  Go ahead, Jason.
[30:11.660 --> 30:18.660]  Yeah, I just wanted to, I think, you know, that first scrog is primarily a suppression tool.
[30:19.660 --> 30:21.660]  It's not necessarily weaving the plant in and out of the scrog net.
[30:22.660 --> 30:28.660]  You're trying to keep the plant below the scrog and continuing to pull it back down and stretch it out.
[30:29.660 --> 30:32.660]  It's really the ideal with that, especially with that first layer of scrog.
[30:33.660 --> 30:38.660]  Second layer of scrog is more for like a support layer and more control,
[30:38.660 --> 30:43.660]  especially, you know, when you're using it on the sides, you're doing it again for suppression purposes
[30:44.660 --> 30:47.660]  to keep the plants in control and out of the aisles and things like that.
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.660]  So it's not so much about weaving it in and out of the net.
[30:51.660 --> 30:54.660]  You want to really try to suppress it to spread the plant out.
[30:55.660 --> 31:02.660]  You're trying to get force lateral growth of the plant at that first scrog layer.
[31:05.660 --> 31:07.660]  I think that's a super important point.
[31:08.660 --> 31:13.660]  When it comes to taking them down, you don't have to destroy your entire net because you've super weaved them through.
[31:14.660 --> 31:17.660]  Things can get really funky if you go in and out, in and out, in and out with those nets I've seen.
[31:18.660 --> 31:19.660]  Things get all twisted and...
[31:21.660 --> 31:22.660]  Go ahead, Johnny.
[31:23.660 --> 31:28.660]  Oh, I was just kind of applauding that statement because that is something that I've had to learn the hard way.
[31:29.660 --> 31:34.660]  And I recommend that nobody has, it follows in my footsteps on this one
[31:34.660 --> 31:38.660]  because those four plants actually just become...
[31:39.660 --> 31:40.660]  I mean, I wasn't doing much weaving.
[31:41.660 --> 31:48.660]  I was just kind of bending down, but it can get really, really, really burdensome harvesting.
[31:49.660 --> 31:53.660]  It took me about two and a half hours to harvest those four plants
[31:54.660 --> 31:58.660]  because I had to do so much unweaving and chopping branches.
[31:59.660 --> 32:02.660]  And for me, that was two hours of hell.
[32:03.660 --> 32:07.660]  And with the amount of plant resin that I had on my arms and sleeves,
[32:08.660 --> 32:14.660]  I was just really not super pleased knowing that that stuff was on me and not on my finished product.
[32:15.660 --> 32:23.660]  So, yeah, definitely take what Jason said and London said into consideration as you're scrogging and as you're weaving.
[32:24.660 --> 32:27.660]  Be mindful that you're going to have to take those plants out of there at some point.
[32:28.660 --> 32:36.660]  I love kind of some of the weirder and wackier methodologies that are out there and scrog is definitely really freaking cool.
[32:37.660 --> 32:43.660]  So if you guys have the opportunity, there's a guy on Instagram called Northern Scrogger.
[32:44.660 --> 32:47.660]  And if you happen to have the opportunity to check this guy out, go ahead and do it
[32:48.660 --> 32:52.660]  because he's famous for doing really long flowering sativas and doing bagels.
[32:53.660 --> 32:54.660]  And they like come out as giant shield.
[32:54.660 --> 32:55.660]  That's quite impressive.
[32:56.660 --> 32:59.660]  He does a really fantastic job of it and is one of the more impressive people.
[33:00.660 --> 33:02.660]  So if you're really interested in that methodology, go check it out.
[33:03.660 --> 33:10.660]  But I'll point out one thing that Johnny mentioned here that I think is also true is this 90 percent of the time,
[33:11.660 --> 33:13.660]  they end up using plastic or nylon.
[33:14.660 --> 33:15.660]  Not super great for the environment.
[33:16.660 --> 33:19.660]  Cutting this stuff up can cause a lot of like little fiber to get in place.
[33:20.660 --> 33:21.660]  This can get mixed in your bud.
[33:21.660 --> 33:25.660]  You also have to manhandle the plant a little bit depending on how you get this ridge out.
[33:26.660 --> 33:28.660]  Depending, now there are methods and other ways to do it.
[33:29.660 --> 33:31.660]  I'm not an expert on it, so I'm not going to say that not to try it out.
[33:32.660 --> 33:36.660]  But I would be cautionary because those were kind of the things that turned me into doing that.
[33:37.660 --> 33:39.660]  It's just like all of a sudden there's this net and it's plastic and it's addition.
[33:40.660 --> 33:45.660]  When I could just pack more plants tighter together and make them just hold each other up was kind of my thought process.
[33:46.660 --> 33:49.660]  But the next question coming up from Eddieman333.
[33:49.660 --> 33:53.660]  And again, if you have questions, go ahead and ask them and I'll get to them as soon as possible.
[33:54.660 --> 33:59.660]  I have been using vinegar to lower pH and recently saw a video saying it reduces microbes.
[34:00.660 --> 34:04.660]  Suggestion was phosphoric acid or muriatic acid.
[34:05.660 --> 34:06.660]  Sorry guys, I am like not great with words.
[34:07.660 --> 34:09.660]  Muriatic acid is caustic.
[34:10.660 --> 34:12.660]  Would it affect the plant or flower?
[34:13.660 --> 34:19.660]  Erica, I don't have an opportunity to speak with you enough, so I'm going to ask you this question.
[34:20.660 --> 34:21.660]  What's your thought?
[34:22.660 --> 34:28.660]  Sure. When it comes to cannabis, typically I'm going to recommend people go with sulfuric acid.
[34:29.660 --> 34:32.660]  Phosphoric acid is a pretty common choice.
[34:33.660 --> 34:41.660]  Muriatic acid is hydrogen chloride.
[34:42.660 --> 34:50.660]  So we don't want to add in any additional chlorine ions that more than we might already have there.
[34:51.660 --> 34:55.660]  Too much is really easy to hit with chlorine ions in your solution.
[34:56.660 --> 35:03.660]  Those guys are going to be used in a lot of sanitizers, things like hypochlorous acid and things like that.
[35:04.660 --> 35:06.660]  Hydrochloric acid, that's what I was trying to think of.
[35:07.660 --> 35:09.660]  Muriatic acid is hydrochloric acid.
[35:10.660 --> 35:13.660]  So typically I'll recommend sulfuric acid.
[35:14.660 --> 35:19.660]  And yeah, when you're working with acids, obviously all of them are caustic.
[35:20.660 --> 35:25.660]  But the poison is really in the dose, as they say.
[35:26.660 --> 35:34.660]  So if you're trying to adjust your pH of your solution, you're shooting for usually something 5.8 to 6.2.
[35:35.660 --> 35:40.660]  You might see people go down to 5.5. You might see people go up to 6.5.
[35:41.660 --> 35:43.660]  It's somewhere in that range.
[35:44.660 --> 35:51.660]  And it's going to be, you're going to require a different amount of acid depending on the nutrients you're using,
[35:52.660 --> 35:56.660]  depending on the media you're using, and depending on your source water.
[35:57.660 --> 36:03.660]  If your source water has a pretty high alkalinity, so like if you've got a lot of minerals already in the water,
[36:04.660 --> 36:06.660]  that tends to eat up a lot of your acid.
[36:07.660 --> 36:08.660]  You're going to need more of it.
[36:08.660 --> 36:15.660]  The way I recommend working with this and figuring out how to add the appropriate amount of acid is,
[36:16.660 --> 36:20.660]  one, hopefully you have some way to test pH.
[36:21.660 --> 36:25.660]  This could be either an electronic pH tester, or it could be those pH test strips.
[36:26.660 --> 36:32.660]  I don't like the pH test strips too much, because you use them once and they're done.
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.660]  So you might end up using a lot of test strips.
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.660]  But they'll work. They'll get you a good estimate.
[36:39.660 --> 36:44.660]  And I would say mix up like a gallon of your water,
[36:45.660 --> 36:50.660]  and just slowly add in some acid of whatever product you end up choosing.
[36:51.660 --> 36:55.660]  And see when you hit the pH target that you're trying to hit.
[36:56.660 --> 37:03.660]  And there you go. You know how much you'll need to treat one gallon of your solution
[37:03.660 --> 37:10.660]  to get to the pH target, and how much acid it's going to take of whichever acid product you've chosen.
[37:11.660 --> 37:16.660]  The reason why I recommend sulfuric is because extra sulfur really doesn't do too much to the plant.
[37:17.660 --> 37:19.660]  It's usually pretty good or neutral.
[37:20.660 --> 37:27.660]  Extra phosphorus, it can be fine, but a lot of fertilizer programs are already pretty heavy on phosphorus.
[37:28.660 --> 37:30.660]  So sometimes you want to avoid adding extra.
[37:30.660 --> 37:35.660]  Nitric acid is another acid that a lot of people will use.
[37:36.660 --> 37:44.660]  Totally fine in terms of fertilizer content, but the thing I don't like about it is nitric acid is a fuming acid.
[37:45.660 --> 37:49.660]  Which means that if it gets a little warm and you've got it stored in a sealed container,
[37:50.660 --> 37:54.660]  you can open up that container and you'll get a face full of nitric acid fumes.
[37:55.660 --> 37:58.660]  So not really the safest product for at-home use.
[37:58.660 --> 38:03.660]  Or even like greenhouse use, I would say stay away from it.
[38:04.660 --> 38:08.660]  But yeah, so those are my thoughts on acid.
[38:09.660 --> 38:14.020]  Thank you.
[38:15.020 --> 38:19.020]  And I'm sorry, I missed the very beginning of the question, but what was the negative problem with using vinegar?
[38:20.020 --> 38:25.020]  They believed it was affecting the biological life in a negative way.
[38:26.020 --> 38:28.020]  I would disagree.
[38:29.020 --> 38:33.020]  I mean, vinegar, especially brown rice vinegar, is a large part of Korean natural farming.
[38:34.020 --> 38:43.020]  We use it actively in liquid IMO, which is basically a brew where we're using vinegar in a 24-hour brew.
[38:44.020 --> 38:48.020]  And we're propagating tons of healthy and helpful biology.
[38:49.020 --> 38:51.020]  So I would highly disagree.
[38:51.020 --> 38:53.020]  I think it just depends on the type of vinegar you're using.
[38:54.020 --> 39:00.020]  Different vinegars have different effects, different amount of pH balancing, and different benefits.
[39:01.020 --> 39:05.020]  If you stick with something like a brown rice vinegar, which is what we try to use in Korean natural farming,
[39:06.020 --> 39:09.020]  you're going to also get the benefits of additional amino acids.
[39:10.020 --> 39:19.020]  And it also helps as a pH stabilizer, not just correcting your pH, but also helping stabilize your pH.
[39:19.020 --> 39:25.020]  So I'm also familiar with phosphoric acid, using phosphoric acid for cleaning,
[39:26.020 --> 39:32.020]  primarily for cleaning jars and implements and tools before making the ferments.
[39:33.020 --> 39:40.020]  It's highly used as well in the food industry as an active cleaner for, you know,
[39:41.020 --> 39:48.020]  trying to kill off the bad biology that can occur in restaurants and places that work with food.
[39:49.020 --> 39:58.020]  Yeah, I think Eric really kind of hit the nail on the head here with the difference between poison and medicine is the dose.
[39:59.020 --> 40:06.020]  So of course, if you're going to be pouring vinegar on your soil, you're going to have biology dying off
[40:07.020 --> 40:13.020]  just the same as if you were to have phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, because vinegar, it's acetic acid.
[40:13.020 --> 40:24.020]  So I don't really, I definitely am, you know, right in line with Jason and saying that vinegar is definitely a safe product.
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.020]  And also, Erica, I have been hearing from a lot of my buddies that I used to work with,
[40:30.020 --> 40:37.020]  that they made the switch from a pH down product that has most of them have phosphoric acid.
[40:37.020 --> 40:41.020]  I'm pretty sure that's the majority of products on the market.
[40:42.020 --> 40:50.020]  But he was saying that my old place of work, they recently made the switch to sulfuric acid for the same reasons that you mentioned.
[40:51.020 --> 40:57.020]  So I think that, you know, the person posing the question using vinegar isn't an issue.
[40:58.020 --> 41:06.020]  But if you are going to seek other options, that the sulfuric acid is where I would make the switch to.
[41:09.630 --> 41:15.630]  Awesome. I think we dove right into that one. And we can put that to rest until another time.
[41:16.630 --> 41:18.630]  Where is it? Oh, go ahead, Erica.
[41:19.630 --> 41:26.630]  Just one final note. If you're an organic focused grower, you may also hear about citric acid to use as a pH adjuster.
[41:27.630 --> 41:31.630]  It works too. It's just, it's not a strong acid. So sometimes it can take a lot.
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.800]  Awesome. I appreciate that. Now, Cy. Oh, go ahead, Anna.
[41:39.800 --> 41:49.800]  I just want to tell a funny story. Acetic acid, I actually was bleaching leaves with glacial acetic acid and nothing with methanol.
[41:50.800 --> 41:53.800]  Totally burned off my fingertips. So I was like, yeah, it's vinegar, it's fine.
[41:54.800 --> 42:01.800]  It's not. It's fine. Acetic acid is really caustic and I didn't have fingerprints for a couple of weeks.
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.800]  Is this how you get away with your murders, Dr. Anubis?
[42:06.800 --> 42:15.800]  You know what? I'm not known for following rules all the time. And when they say wear gloves, like sometimes I don't listen.
[42:16.800 --> 42:19.800]  And sometimes when they say wear like UV protection stuff, like sometimes I don't listen.
[42:20.800 --> 42:30.800]  I always learn my lesson eventually, but it's usually the hard way. But yeah, acetic acid is not. It's, be careful.
[42:31.800 --> 42:39.800]  I love it. It's like hydrogen peroxide has been used to clean cuts by mothers for generations.
[42:40.800 --> 42:47.800]  But if you get the 33% stuff, that stuff will fuck you up, man. Like you don't, you got to be careful. It's the same.
[42:48.800 --> 42:55.800]  I used to use chloroform. So there is a DNA extraction method that I use that uses chloroform.
[42:56.800 --> 43:05.800]  And my mentor would not let me use it unless there was somebody else in the room because he knows I don't fucking follow directions.
[43:06.800 --> 43:14.800]  And I might not turn the hood on and I might get myself. Like chloroform, I'm like, oh chloroform, it's not that bad.
[43:14.800 --> 43:17.800]  No, it is. It is. It is.
[43:18.800 --> 43:20.800]  I would make sure you supervise.
[43:21.800 --> 43:27.800]  So we got, as you say, we got chloroform. We got removal of fingerprints. I'm really starting to get concerned over here.
[43:28.800 --> 43:29.800]  This is going south.
[43:30.800 --> 43:33.800]  If you go to the right school, anybody can be a doctor.
[43:34.800 --> 43:41.800]  Expense fingerprints and put them onto your own hands with chloroform.
[43:42.800 --> 43:47.800]  But anyways, I'm sorry, guys. That was a great segue. I really appreciate that moment there.
[43:48.800 --> 43:53.800]  So CY, who is in the audience, asked a question actually on the Instagram last week.
[43:54.800 --> 43:57.800]  And I didn't get to it, but we are going to get to it today.
[43:58.800 --> 44:06.800]  This is more allocated to smaller scale, but still accurate soil testing.
[44:07.800 --> 44:14.800]  So what are commercial growers testing their soil or leaf tissue for?
[44:15.800 --> 44:16.800]  Is the first part of the question.
[44:17.800 --> 44:23.800]  And why don't we just start with, are commercial growers testing their soil and leaf tissue for?
[44:23.800 --> 44:27.800]  Maybe Erica, do you want to hop in? I love having you on the stage.
[44:28.800 --> 44:31.800]  Thank you. Yeah, I'll just give you a couple of quick things.
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.800]  So soil, I mean, I guess it depends on the type of testing we're doing.
[44:36.800 --> 44:41.800]  So soil, typically we're testing for heavy metals, of course.
[44:42.800 --> 44:45.800]  So cadmium, arsenic, lead, mercury.
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.800]  And then if you're growing in the field as well, they're going to want to test for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels.
[44:51.800 --> 44:54.800]  So you can estimate how much fertilizer you need to apply.
[44:55.800 --> 44:56.800]  That's pretty standard.
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.800]  And then tissue testing, most of the time it's nutrient tissue levels.
[45:03.800 --> 45:12.800]  If you're just doing standard tissue testing, people are looking at things like the same thing that you would see on a fertilizer analysis.
[45:13.800 --> 45:16.800]  Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, etc. Everything.
[45:17.800 --> 45:19.800]  They want to know those levels that are in the tissue.
[45:19.800 --> 45:22.800]  But you can also do pathogen tissue testing.
[45:23.800 --> 45:27.800]  So oftentimes that'll be stuff like virus and viroid presence.
[45:28.800 --> 45:30.800]  And it's a different type of testing.
[45:31.800 --> 45:33.800]  So it depends on the testing protocol that they're doing.
[45:34.800 --> 45:37.800]  But I think those are the big ones that I've come across.
[45:38.800 --> 45:40.800]  You guys might have some other ones.
[45:41.800 --> 45:51.380]  So I think I was just going to say, so some of the additional soil testing that they can be doing,
[45:51.380 --> 45:54.380]  it really depends on how far you're getting.
[45:55.380 --> 46:01.380]  If you're just sending in samples into the lab, if you have folks that are going out into the field as well,
[46:02.380 --> 46:06.380]  there's also additional testing that you may want to do.
[46:07.380 --> 46:11.380]  You may want to be looking for things like glyphosate, depending on what was grown there previously.
[46:12.380 --> 46:16.380]  So you may want to be looking at other types of contaminants that might be in that soil.
[46:16.380 --> 46:24.380]  And then additionally, a lot of times folks are looking at the water, the level of water absorption.
[46:25.380 --> 46:29.380]  So doing like a bucket test, you know, taking a five-gallon bucket of water and dumping it on the ground
[46:30.380 --> 46:32.380]  and seeing how long it takes for that water to go down.
[46:33.380 --> 46:41.380]  Using like a steel pole or a rod to see how soil compaction levels as well.
[46:41.380 --> 46:49.380]  Because you might need to do some additional work to break up the soil in a way to get growing.
[46:50.380 --> 46:55.380]  Because years of mechanical farming or heavy equipment may have compacted that soil
[46:56.380 --> 47:02.380]  so that it won't retain water or biology and does need to be broken up before it can actually be worked.
[47:03.380 --> 47:12.360]  Awesome. And is there, so has anybody, like I haven't done it before,
[47:12.360 --> 47:19.360]  but has anybody done like or can recommend a soil tester for like maybe an at-home level
[47:20.360 --> 47:23.360]  and a commercial level recommendations? Does anybody have?
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.360]  Well, my friend at Buxton Hollow Farms here in Massachusetts,
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.360]  I think he actually does work for people all over New England and can get it tested,
[47:34.360 --> 47:35.360]  but primarily here in Massachusetts.
[47:36.360 --> 47:40.360]  So I would look for usually your organic input providers and things like that.
[47:40.360 --> 47:45.360]  But yeah, definitely Don from Buxton Hollow Farms here in Massachusetts can help you do that.
[47:46.360 --> 47:51.360]  And then if you're really interested in getting into it deep, you can definitely contact,
[47:52.360 --> 47:57.360]  you can go through Dr. Elaine Ingham's Soil Food Web School and become a certified soil tester
[47:58.360 --> 48:03.360]  or at least she can connect you with some certified consultants that can do that work probably in your area.
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.360]  That's a gem. I like that one, Jason.
[48:10.360 --> 48:11.360]  That was a great recommendation.
[48:14.910 --> 48:17.910]  Next question coming from Doug Darden is asking,
[48:18.910 --> 48:24.910]  future Capanobis project, can having too many microbes in a small one gallon container cause pH to rise above seven?
[48:25.910 --> 48:29.910]  I read bacteria secrete stuff that can cause this. Currently seeing this in one plant.
[48:30.910 --> 48:33.910]  Go ahead, Johnny. I think this is a perfect question for you.
[48:34.910 --> 48:38.910]  We were talking about something similar about microbial activity in small containers earlier,
[48:39.910 --> 48:40.910]  but I think this would be a fun one for you to jump into.
[48:41.910 --> 48:45.910]  So did I hear that he says that it will raise pH?
[48:46.910 --> 48:49.910]  Yeah, that his pH is going up.
[48:50.910 --> 48:56.910]  You know, at least with lactic acid bacteria, I think it's the opposite effect.
[48:57.910 --> 49:01.910]  I think it's dependent largely on the microbes in question.
[49:02.910 --> 49:09.910]  Where lactic acid bacteria, they're kind of the lean things to the acidic side,
[49:10.910 --> 49:14.910]  but fungi, I also believe will tend to make things more acidic,
[49:15.910 --> 49:21.910]  where the typical kind of bacteria will tend to raise soil pH.
[49:22.910 --> 49:24.910]  I'm pretty sure that's it.
[49:25.910 --> 49:31.910]  But so it's going to depend on the microbe in question, I believe.
[49:32.910 --> 49:37.420]  I agree.
[49:39.420 --> 49:42.420]  I think you got to ask a little bit more questions.
[49:44.420 --> 49:50.420]  So, you know, we have the acidity up, and then there are other microbes that bring basic elements up, right?
[49:51.420 --> 49:55.420]  So it's really hard to judge with just the amount of information that we have there.
[49:56.420 --> 50:01.420]  But is there a point where microbes will kill themselves through this process?
[50:02.420 --> 50:07.420]  You know, I definitely have heard of large spikes in populations,
[50:08.420 --> 50:12.420]  and then followed by a steep drop-off in that population.
[50:12.420 --> 50:17.420]  Basically, there's a large influx of microbes being inoculated,
[50:18.420 --> 50:22.420]  and there's kind of a rapid nutrient cycling that occurs.
[50:23.420 --> 50:29.420]  And then once kind of the food source runs out, there tends to be like a rapid die-off
[50:30.420 --> 50:34.420]  that's, you know, potentially something that you're looking at.
[50:35.420 --> 50:39.420]  But yeah, as far as, yeah, I mean, I'm certain that over time,
[50:39.420 --> 50:47.420]  there could be a succession of certain microbes kind of dominating a solution or a soil system.
[50:48.420 --> 50:56.420]  I know trichoderma is a really voracious fungus that really kind of bullies its way around with other microbes.
[50:57.420 --> 51:03.420]  I know that lactic acid bacteria is very, kind of will do the same,
[51:04.420 --> 51:08.420]  and they'll kind of outcompete a lot of the other biology that's around.
[51:09.420 --> 51:16.420]  But I do believe that you can have kind of, I mean, you're not going to have a monoculture of an organism,
[51:17.420 --> 51:25.420]  but you can definitely have your, wherever you're looking at, be heavily dominated by particular sets of microbes.
[51:26.420 --> 51:34.420]  I 100% agree. Like, you can think of that situation as, it's like a, it's a closed ecosystem, right?
[51:34.420 --> 51:41.420]  And so you've got your, you know, your dominators, you've got your things that, you know, are kind of foragers, whatever.
[51:42.420 --> 51:48.420]  But you see these things with like cycles with wolves and deer or whatever the case may be.
[51:49.420 --> 51:54.420]  Like, you'll see a spike in the rabbit population, and then the predators will come in.
[51:55.420 --> 51:58.420]  There's an abundance of food. They'll take over and then there's no food.
[51:59.420 --> 52:03.420]  And so then you'll see a drop in the predators because they don't have any food. They ate it all.
[52:04.420 --> 52:13.420]  So there's a natural cycle. And so, you know, like you might see it as, it's like we are in control of that natural balance.
[52:14.420 --> 52:20.420]  If we want it to stay stabilized, otherwise it's going to go through these natural cycles of abundance and then crashes.
[52:21.420 --> 52:29.420]  Because that's kind of the natural way that things go in ecosystems,
[52:29.420 --> 52:35.420]  whether it be a large macro ecosystem or a micro ecosystem.
[52:38.420 --> 52:43.420]  Awesome. I love that point of conjecture. Jason, I got a good one here for you.
[52:44.420 --> 52:46.420]  Did you want to make your statement first?
[52:47.420 --> 52:51.420]  I was just going to add on a one gallon pot is a really small ecosystem.
[52:52.420 --> 53:03.420]  And, you know, when you're trying to do living soil or manage a lot of, you're trying to have good amount of living things going in your pot,
[53:04.420 --> 53:06.420]  the larger the pot, the better your chances are.
[53:07.420 --> 53:15.420]  The, you know, temperatures, moisture levels, all those things are a lot easier to manage when you're in a larger pot.
[53:15.420 --> 53:21.420]  So a one gallon pot is really a small pot to be working with when you're trying to do things in a biological way.
[53:22.420 --> 53:24.420]  So that was all I was going to add on to that. But go ahead.
[53:25.420 --> 53:27.420]  I got a good one. This is good.
[53:28.420 --> 53:34.420]  Your court area. I'm sure Johnny will want to throw in here too, but I think you'll really like this one.
[53:35.420 --> 53:39.420]  I say, damn it. You people, you guys give me such challenging names sometimes.
[53:39.420 --> 53:45.420]  I say Malakot. Greetings. How to deal with KNF techniques in flower time.
[53:46.420 --> 53:50.420]  How to flush if necessary. Thanks for the huge amount of knowledge.
[53:51.420 --> 53:53.420]  Jason, do you have, do you want to start this one?
[53:54.420 --> 54:00.420]  So first off, there really shouldn't be any flushing when it comes to Korean natural farming,
[54:01.420 --> 54:04.420]  because you're in living soil and you can't flush soil.
[54:04.420 --> 54:11.420]  Soil flushing is a concept primarily for non soil growers.
[54:12.420 --> 54:18.420]  And it has to do with flushing additional salts and things out of your mediums.
[54:19.420 --> 54:22.420]  If you're growing in cocoa or rockwool or something along those lines,
[54:23.420 --> 54:27.420]  you might need to clean out that area because it builds up over time.
[54:28.420 --> 54:32.420]  When you're in soil, and especially when you're doing things from a Korean natural farming approach,
[54:32.420 --> 54:39.420]  there is no flushing. You don't need to stop doing what you're doing.
[54:40.420 --> 54:45.420]  What you need to do though, is you need to pay attention to the life cycle,
[54:46.420 --> 54:51.420]  the living cycle of the plant. And so towards the end of your flowering,
[54:52.420 --> 54:55.420]  usually around that six week period, seven week period,
[54:56.420 --> 55:00.420]  that's where you come into your enhanced ripening phase.
[55:00.420 --> 55:07.420]  And that's actually where you switch from using FFJ, I'm sorry, FPJs to FFJ.
[55:08.420 --> 55:15.420]  Fermented fruit juices over fermented plant juices are really only meant for that enhanced ripening phase of flowering.
[55:16.420 --> 55:21.420]  And so that's where you're going to be switch over from your FPJ to your FFJ.
[55:22.420 --> 55:27.420]  In your normal approach, you shouldn't be using FAA any longer because that's a nitrogen
[55:27.420 --> 55:32.420]  and you don't need that in your flowering. You're definitely beyond your WCAP.
[55:33.420 --> 55:36.420]  You don't need your phosphorus. That's more for your transition.
[55:37.420 --> 55:42.420]  But again, you're really just trying to keep running with that FFJ
[55:43.420 --> 55:46.420]  and a good solution for those last couple of weeks and keep feeding the plant.
[55:47.420 --> 55:49.420]  I mean, the plant's going to keep feeding itself off the soil anyway.
[55:50.420 --> 55:52.420]  So that's my input for that.
[55:53.420 --> 55:58.420]  So my guess is that their worry right now is that they've burnt the plant potentially.
[55:59.420 --> 56:01.420]  Is this possible using these items?
[56:02.420 --> 56:04.420]  And that would be my guess why they might, you know, like,
[56:05.420 --> 56:07.420]  hey, I'm going to rinse the medium and kind of start from fresh.
[56:08.420 --> 56:09.420]  But is that like, is that probable?
[56:10.420 --> 56:15.420]  Or they maybe like should look in another direction as a feeding methodology
[56:16.420 --> 56:20.420]  or review kind of the amendments that they're adding in at this point in time?
[56:20.420 --> 56:21.420]  Maybe there's an imbalance there.
[56:22.420 --> 56:26.420]  Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess it really just depends on how close
[56:27.420 --> 56:29.420]  to Korean natural farming they're following at this.
[56:30.420 --> 56:32.420]  If they were following closely to Korean natural farming,
[56:33.420 --> 56:35.420]  they really wouldn't be doing anything that they could burn plants with.
[56:36.420 --> 56:39.420]  That's most likely going to be something that they've added
[56:40.420 --> 56:44.420]  as an additional input or as an additive that they thought might be useful
[56:45.420 --> 56:47.420]  on top of what they were already doing.
[56:50.270 --> 56:51.270]  Awesome. Thank you.
[56:52.270 --> 56:53.270]  Evian, welcome to this stage.
[56:54.270 --> 56:55.270]  Dr. Erica, we appreciate you.
[56:56.270 --> 56:59.270]  You can drop out whenever you can, but we appreciate you stopping by
[57:00.270 --> 57:02.270]  and saying hello today. I know you have to go shortly.
[57:03.270 --> 57:08.270]  But I did want to ask a great question coming in line here for you, Evian.
[57:09.270 --> 57:11.270]  And it was specifically, since you're on stage, I'm going to utilize you.
[57:12.270 --> 57:14.270]  Are you available to chat now? Or did you like hop on early
[57:15.270 --> 57:16.270]  and you're still getting comfortable at home?
[57:17.270 --> 57:18.270]  Because I can give you a little bit longer if you need it.
[57:19.270 --> 57:23.270]  Okay. I am still not home, but yeah, I just had a late production meeting.
[57:24.270 --> 57:26.270]  Sorry. But spring is coming.
[57:27.270 --> 57:29.270]  So I'm here. I can answer questions.
[57:30.270 --> 57:33.270]  Okay. I'm going to give you a couple more minutes to just hop in
[57:34.270 --> 57:36.270]  and you get comfortable. But I'm going to say this first.
[57:37.270 --> 57:40.270]  Anybody that has any more questions, make sure to pop them out here.
[57:41.270 --> 57:43.270]  We are approaching the hour mark. We only run for an hour and a half
[57:44.270 --> 57:47.270]  typically in this room at a hard stop. So get your questions in now.
[57:47.270 --> 57:50.270]  Get them in sooner than later or you won't be able to get them in at all.
[57:51.270 --> 57:54.270]  I'm trying best to track them. But if I missed it, don't be afraid to type it in again
[57:55.270 --> 57:56.270]  so that I catch it and appreciate you guys.
[57:57.270 --> 57:59.270]  Erica, did you want to say something before?
[58:00.270 --> 58:04.270]  Yeah. Just really quick. I am not a doctor.
[58:05.270 --> 58:07.270]  I have a Master's of Science in Horticultural Biology.
[58:08.270 --> 58:13.270]  But I do not want to detract from the real PhD, Dr. Anna.
[58:14.270 --> 58:18.270]  I had a Master's once and I made everybody call me Master Anna.
[58:19.270 --> 58:20.270]  Oh, I shouldn't be doing that.
[58:21.270 --> 58:22.270]  Master Erica.
[58:23.270 --> 58:25.270]  Yes. And honestly, I kind of missed that title.
[58:26.270 --> 58:29.270]  For two whole years, I made everybody call me Master Anna.
[58:30.270 --> 58:34.270]  Well, it's a great idea. And I just wanted to say thank you for having me up on stage.
[58:35.270 --> 58:37.270]  And I gotta go.
[58:40.270 --> 58:42.270]  Bye, Erica.
[58:44.270 --> 58:45.270]  Thank you.
[58:46.270 --> 58:48.270]  It is the Master Erica.
[58:49.270 --> 58:51.270]  So, Dr. Anna, the real McCoy. I missed this and I feel bad.
[58:52.270 --> 58:55.270]  So we're going to jump back to it. And I think it's a great opportunity to chat about it.
[58:56.270 --> 59:01.270]  Because you, I think, have particularly an interesting amount of knowledge, even though for the ear.
[59:02.270 --> 59:03.270]  So we're talking about mutations a little bit earlier.
[59:04.270 --> 59:08.270]  And specifically, the question was, when cutting clones from a mother plant,
[59:09.270 --> 59:11.270]  does this cause mutations?
[59:12.270 --> 59:16.270]  Okay, so here's where it gets interesting.
[59:17.270 --> 59:21.270]  So as I said earlier, and if you weren't at the beginning, you might have missed it.
[59:22.270 --> 59:30.270]  But generally, mutations are ignored or not really impactful.
[59:31.270 --> 59:37.270]  Unless they're in the gonads, unless they're in the germ cells, unless they're in the sperm and egg.
[59:37.270 --> 59:43.270]  That's when they really impact either an individual and or at a population level.
[59:44.270 --> 59:49.270]  If you're cutting clones from a mother, basically, you're getting the exact same genome from the mother.
[59:50.270 --> 59:58.270]  And really, the only mutations that can occur are the ones that you potentially got from the mother.
[59:59.270 --> 01:00:07.270]  And then ones that accumulate or happen after you become your own individual and started growing yourself.
[01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:15.270]  And those are going to be somatic mutations, because there is no germ line that you came from.
[01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:20.270]  So there's none of that going on.
[01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:34.270]  So if there is some kind of mutation, it really is going to be a somatic mutation that's only going to lead to localized effects, if at all.
[01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:42.270]  So if it is some kind of mutation, like fasciation is a really, really good one, because I've been seeing that a lot.
[01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:47.270]  And a lot of cannabis, whether it's from a clone or seed, it doesn't matter.
[01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.270]  And fasciation can be caused by so many different things.
[01:00:51.270 --> 01:01:01.270]  But that's a really good example of a localized mutation that leads to an observable effect.
[01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:10.270]  But generally, if you don't know what fasciation is, it can lead to like a flattened, widened stem, almost looks like celery.
[01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:20.270]  Or it can lead to like a crested flower cola thing.
[01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:24.270]  People often mistake it for a polyploid. It's not a polyploid.
[01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:29.270]  It's just a localized mutation.
[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:36.270]  It's a mutation that leads to a localized, strange growth pattern.
[01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:44.270]  That's a really good example of just a localized mutation.
[01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:50.270]  It's not really, it doesn't affect necessarily the life of the plant.
[01:01:51.270 --> 01:02:02.270]  You're not going to see it necessarily in, if you did breed that plant, the offspring would never necessarily inherit that mutation because it's localized in the somatic.
[01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:11.270]  So that everything but the gonads, everything but the sperm and the egg, it's in the body, which you don't pass on to your offspring.
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.270]  So, God, this is so interesting.
[01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:18.270]  And I have taught a whole genetic course on this.
[01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:24.270]  And it's really hard for me, and I'm a geneticist, to remember these things.
[01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.270]  There's a whole body of cells in an individual.
[01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:37.270]  But it's really the gonads, the sex cells that really create the effects in individuals, but also in populations.
[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:42.270]  And when we talk about mutations that lead to change, we're talking at a population level.
[01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:46.270]  In cannabis, we generally talk about mutations at an individual level.
[01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:53.270]  So there's like this really weird thing that you have to wrap your brain around in mutations in cannabis.
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.270]  And I think I went off on a tangent.
[01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.270]  Did I answer the question?
[01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.270]  I think so.
[01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.270]  I was just enjoying your tangent.
[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:03.270]  As was I.
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:10.270]  It's such a hard, like people, like, sorry, I cut you off.
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:21.270]  No, it's such a, I mean, if you can just, if you just sit down and think about all the cells in your body and where they're located and what they contribute to.
[01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:33.270]  And then the DNA inside those cells, inside the nucleus, when the cells, like, divide and you make a new cell, that's where the mutation is going to happen.
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:41.270]  It's just one of those cells, potentially, that has the mutation that got the wrong information or whatever.
[01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.270]  More than likely, that cell is going to be destroyed because it's wrong, right?
[01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.270]  So it's going to be tagged for destruction.
[01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:57.270]  It's so rare that a mutation makes it through to do anything in any organism.
[01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:00.270]  Most mutations are just neutral.
[01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.270]  It's just a base pair change or whatever.
[01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:06.270]  There's so many mistakes that go on that just really result in nothing.
[01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:16.270]  It's really, mutations are really, when you think about all the things that are in the world that have cell division and the things that actually,
[01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:20.270]  result in change, it's so freaking rare.
[01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:26.270]  So yeah, donors, sit down and think about all that for a hot second.
[01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.270]  Because it blows my mind.
[01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:33.270]  The weirdos, we get the weirdos.
[01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.270]  I always like to say, I love the weirdos, right?
[01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.270]  I love the strange plants.
[01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.270]  It's the fascinating part, right?
[01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:45.270]  I mean, you know, you grow a lot of plants and then you get this plant that's just like, wow, what is this thing doing?
[01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:46.270]  Why does it have six leaves?
[01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:48.270]  Everything has five and seven.
[01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:50.270]  Why does this one have six?
[01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.270]  Why does this have a bud popping up in the middle of the state?
[01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:56.270]  Just all these weird things that come out of these plants.
[01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.270]  Why does this one have a leaf that looks like a lobster claw?
[01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.270]  Just all these weird mutations that come out.
[01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:05.270]  I love them.
[01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:06.270]  That's part of the fun.
[01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:14.270]  Part of exploring all these different genetics and growing these plants and spending time with them directly is finding, experiencing them.
[01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:17.270]  Those really strange things as well.
[01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:19.270]  I really enjoy them.
[01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:21.270]  I got a shout out to the freaks too.
[01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:23.270]  I just want to agree.
[01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:25.270]  I totally agree with you, Jason.
[01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:27.270]  And thank you, Dr. Anna, because it's a great answer.
[01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.270]  And I actually have, I'm driving, but I have something I've thought of you, Dr. Anna.
[01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:37.270]  Because something that's bothered me for like three years in the weird mutation thing where it's like this.
[01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.270]  I have a photo I took earlier today.
[01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:47.270]  It's like this weird spiral leaf thing that happens when plants revege and then it comes out into a singular leaf.
[01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:52.270]  And it has puzzled me for years because it's not like unhealthy plant.
[01:05:53.270 --> 01:06:00.270]  It's just this weird freak thing that happens sometimes in plants that are reveging and only in some plants and not in other ones.
[01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:02.270]  And I don't know.
[01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:04.270]  I'd love to share it when I'm not driving.
[01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:06.270]  Maybe I can PTR.
[01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:09.270]  But the freaks are the most fun part for me too.
[01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.270]  I'm always like, oh, look, it's got a polyploid or it's fasciated or it's weird.
[01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:20.270]  I think my question with the somatic mutations is like how many generations down in cloning?
[01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:23.270]  Like you cut some clones off a plant sometimes.
[01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:29.270]  And that was kind of where that most recent white paper left me thinking like where.
[01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:37.270]  Like I know I've had things for six plus years and then I start to see changes, you know.
[01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:45.270]  So it's like when do you know sometimes you don't see any sort of change in things until it's like way down the line.
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:51.270]  So it's also interesting timeline wise is what makes me think there is a sort of timeline.
[01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:54.270]  OK, so.
[01:06:55.270 --> 01:07:00.270]  Fantastic insight and questions, Abby, and I love it that weird spiral leaf.
[01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:04.270]  I have seen that before and I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.270]  And I feel like that is.
[01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:14.270]  And I don't know for sure, but I feel like that's a hormone thing leading to one edge of the leaf growing faster than the other.
[01:07:15.270 --> 01:07:17.270]  And I don't know why. I don't know why the plant does it have no idea.
[01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:20.270]  I don't think it's an actual like cellular mutation.
[01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:22.270]  I feel like it has to do with hormones.
[01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:25.270]  Anyway, that being said, I literally have no idea.
[01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:27.270]  That's just a feeling that I have.
[01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:29.270]  Number two thing.
[01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:32.270]  OK, so generation.
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:33.270]  All right.
[01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:37.270]  So now here I'm wondering.
[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:39.270]  About whether it's.
[01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:51.270]  OK, so there's a thing called Mueller's ratchet, which would be where the mother or the mother has a mutation is then passed down to the offspring.
[01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:58.270]  And then if you clone that offspring, it then also has a mutation and the mutation just sort of like.
[01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:05.270]  Amplifies in in subsequent clones, but it also could be epigenetic.
[01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:09.270]  So some kind of stress response.
[01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:14.270]  Leads it so it's not an actual like change to the genetic code.
[01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:21.270]  It's something it's a stress response that's passed down to generations and generations and generations.
[01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:23.270]  At least to some sort of.
[01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.270]  Phenotypic change.
[01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:34.270]  So those are two different things that get me get my head all wild and I was the Mueller's ratchet thing.
[01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.270]  I don't.
[01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.270]  Unless you're.
[01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:44.270]  Really accidentally cloning like the same random spot where a mutation.
[01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:46.270]  I don't know.
[01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.270]  I can't get my head around Mueller's ratchet.
[01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:49.270]  Honestly, when it comes to cloning.
[01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:58.270]  But it's something to look into if you figure out the answer, or if you have any insights, anybody in the audience, any and whoever, let me know.
[01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:02.270]  But I, this is where I think comes down to like epigenetic changes.
[01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:05.270]  Leading to phenotypic expression changes.
[01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:12.270]  That is actually really fascinating and something really interesting to ponder because it's like I can actually I said that today.
[01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:16.270]  I'm like, oh, this same line just seems to have this one thing.
[01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:25.270]  And then I was wondering if it is just a, if it's just something generational or if it is just something I've always I want to know more.
[01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:28.270]  I want to look at the point with x ray vision and be like, what is going on inside of you?
[01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:29.270]  And why are you doing that?
[01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:30.270]  Because it's just you.
[01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.270]  You know, why are you being weird?
[01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.270]  And it's a, it's a very interesting thing to ponder.
[01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:38.270]  I think that it's a deeper conversation.
[01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:39.270]  I want to look into.
[01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:46.270]  I did manage to PTR and I'm allegedly driving, but there's the PTR of the little spiral leaf that I was talking about.
[01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:56.830]  In London, I am available if there's that next question.
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.830]  If you want to, because I know we have limited time.
[01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:04.830]  Awesome. Yeah, I was gonna, I was gonna get you.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.830]  I just wanted to make sure that I could get the physical leaf.
[01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:11.830]  I'm having trouble showing that leaf on on the YouTube side, but I'll figure it out.
[01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:12.830]  And we'll get it up there.
[01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:18.830]  But the question was, and this is actually from our DAG Academy and Pinhead has asked.
[01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:23.830]  And this is kind of our, our question submission form.
[01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:30.830]  Anybody can sign in and submit a question and the people of Future Canvas Product will try and go in and answer them as well as I'm on this panel.
[01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:37.830]  So, but Pinhead asks, I've been growing out for some Afghan hash plants from Barney's farm.
[01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:42.830]  And the last plant I flowered has an overwhelming smell of sweet peppermint.
[01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:43.830]  I love that.
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:50.830]  It, it's like straight up candy cane with, with a little death funk in the background.
[01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:51.830]  That sounds awesome too.
[01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.830]  I don't know why, but it does.
[01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:54.830]  I'm in love with it.
[01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:57.830]  I want to pursue the minty turpentine.
[01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:01.830]  I want to pursue the minty terp profile.
[01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:12.830]  Any readers out there or come across some real minty hash strains and if they could recommend where to get those for crossing?
[01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:20.100]  So I'm a huge fan of the mint terpene, which is awesome.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:26.100]  I think the mint terpene is the terpene that it's the mint family, like all the different mint plants.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.100]  And I think it's a really fun.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.100]  I have a couple of my favorite cultivars have mint.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:38.100]  They're more traditionally flower cultivars.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.100]  Not for hash.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:52.100]  I know that we, you know, and just so people know, like a traditional thing that's generally high in osmium, like headband is like an old school thing that has that kind of like minty profile.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.100]  It's usually not like super dominant.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.100]  But yeah, that's a, that's a really good question.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:10.100]  I'm going to have to like think on as far as extraction goes, like, what is something that generally is like more driven because it's not super common.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:17.100]  I will say also, it's not a very, you know, there's certain things, but it's not something widely expressing.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.100]  And it's interesting because it doesn't always carry over.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:30.100]  I'm trying to think we've done a lot of different things with a couple different high osmium cultivars, like lives, resins, and other things along those lines.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.100]  And I just like how it comes through is kind of interesting.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.100]  And the finished product.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:40.100]  So, I don't know, Jason, if you have something I'm going to try to contemplate for just a minute.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.100]  But that's about, that's about all I've got there.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.100]  I'm going to ponder that one a little bit more.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.100]  I need to review the fact that it's called osmium.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.100]  I'm just, did I get that right?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:02.100]  Yes, osmium is the, is the minty, you know, and it's the same if you were growing mint plants, it's the same.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:10.100]  Osmium is in, and the mint family in the plant family is a very, very, very wide family.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.100]  So there's a lot of things in the mint plant family.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:18.100]  And osmium is not in all of them, but it generally is a terpene that is dominant.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:23.100]  It's like that kind of minty peppermint and, you know, peppermint, spearmint, all of that.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:30.100]  Capmint, you know, just across the board, a lot of those plants have high levels of osmium also.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:39.140]  So, does anybody else have a mint recommendation, Jason?
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.140]  Oh, hey there, Dutch.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:45.140]  There we go. There's one of our other, other seekers of the plant.
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.140]  And then Cheddar Bob too. Oh, where'd you go? I saw you.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.140]  But anyways, that was the area.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.140]  Yeah, I'll let Dutch chime in.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:59.140]  I don't personally have any, especially when it comes to a hash making standpoint.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:01.140]  That's definitely not my area.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.140]  Awesome. Well, Dutch, we had a question.
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.140]  I'm going to throw you to the rules right off the bat.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:11.140]  Mint, cannabis strains for breeding.
[01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:19.310]  Been in their hunt. It was an animal, apparently.
[01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:22.310]  And they found something very, very minty.
[01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:27.310]  Do you have a suggestion on where they could look to hunt down this flavor a little bit more
[01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:29.310]  and bring it into this breeding project?
[01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:34.310]  Mint. Wow.
[01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.310]  You know, I found mint in a few things.
[01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:40.310]  It resides within the Cush family, if you will.
[01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:46.310]  I don't know if the Cush family is a thing, but within the OG Cush lines,
[01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:51.310]  I've definitely come across some minty-esque things.
[01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:55.310]  I didn't hear that at the beginning of the question. I just popped on.
[01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:57.310]  I'm just walking out to get a smoke.
[01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:02.310]  I just got here at the Benbow down in Humboldt ready for the conference.
[01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:06.310]  So I just wanted to pop on, say hi to you all.
[01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:12.310]  Awesome. When does it start? Do you have it posted there?
[01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:17.310]  Yeah, it starts Friday, this Friday morning, 9 a.m.
[01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:21.310]  at the Richardson Grove RV Park in Garberville.
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:24.310]  It's happening a little bit early.
[01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:27.310]  We're going to get set up tomorrow and be ready for the weekend.
[01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:32.310]  It's a big, big weekend with a lot of exciting folks coming from all over
[01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:36.310]  to participate and coming from all over to speak.
[01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:38.310]  So I'm excited.
[01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:43.310]  Welcome to Humboldt, Josh. Welcome back, brother.
[01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:46.310]  Thanks, man.
[01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:50.310]  I'm excited to hear the series kicking off again.
[01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:55.310]  So I did post your link for it up there.
[01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:57.310]  So shameless plug.
[01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.310]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:05.310]  Yeah, no, and I always tell people I don't feel bad about being a shameless plug
[01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:10.310]  because it truly is a labor of love and an event for all of us.
[01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:15.310]  So I don't feel like I'm promoting myself in this one.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:20.310]  I feel like I'm promoting an educational experience, and that feels pretty good.
[01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.310]  I was really hoping that you were going to stick with experiment
[01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:26.310]  because that would have got weird.
[01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:32.310]  Right. Well, there's a little bit of experiment where I'm doing the, you know,
[01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:35.310]  so everyone that buys a ticket and comes to any of the conferences
[01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:40.310]  is going has the opportunity to participate in a breeding project.
[01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:43.310]  Everyone will receive a pack of seeds.
[01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:44.310]  Excuse me.
[01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:49.310]  A root beer across ChemDoc special reserve seeds, F2s.
[01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:55.310]  And we're going to create a group breeding project within each region of each conference.
[01:16:55.310 --> 01:17:00.310]  So there's four of them, one in Humboldt, one in Michigan, Maine and Oklahoma.
[01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:05.310]  And we'll hop on social media and record everything on the blockchain.
[01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:07.310]  You know, I'll try to be quick at explaining it,
[01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:11.310]  but it's going to be a cool project that I think is really exciting.
[01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:17.500]  I cut you off, Johnny. Go ahead.
[01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.210]  No biggie, London.
[01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:28.210]  I was just letting everybody in the audience and anybody you might be listening
[01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:34.210]  on YouTube or here that this conference, you know,
[01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:41.210]  even without the seeds that are being handed out, it is well worth the money.
[01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:46.210]  And it's totally like a life changing or can be a life changing event.
[01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:50.210]  And the amount of information that you're going to pick up and the connections that you'll
[01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:53.210]  meet at this thing are well worth the money spent.
[01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:59.210]  So I highly recommend anybody who's on the fence about this, you know,
[01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:05.210]  let me kind of be the thing that sways you to the other side that this event a couple
[01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:09.210]  of years ago when I went really was a life changing event for me.
[01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:14.210]  So I highly recommend anybody and everybody to come.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.380]  Awesome. And we have Daka Christ on deck.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:26.380]  Welcome to the stage. You have a question or a comment for our group of panelists.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.380]  We have about 12 minutes left.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.380]  So looking for it. Hey, Matt, how are you doing? Good to see you too.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.380]  Daka Christ, you're up.
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:37.380]  Yeah, thank you, London.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.380]  Hello, panel of specialists in cannabis culture.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:53.380]  Breeding, stabilization of genetics and wondering why I'm working with some hemp cannabis.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:03.380]  And my favorite girl, her name is Trinity, and she was a seed amongst 10,000.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.380]  And the reason why I selected her was because from birth, instead of having two branches
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.380]  at every section, she had three branches at every section.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.380]  Dr. Anubis, could you speak to why this occurred?
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:26.380]  What is it and how I can stabilize it either through cuttings and or seed collection?
[01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:38.690]  My speaker was off. Hey, sorry.
[01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:43.690]  Can you say that question one more time? I'm so sorry.
[01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:49.690]  I was like gathering my. I was flailing with my microphone.
[01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:51.690]  OK. One more time.
[01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:53.690]  Daka Christ, you want to say anything?
[01:19:56.690 --> 01:20:05.690]  I was referring to the genetic trait of three branches at every intersection instead of two branches at every section.
[01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:08.690]  And is there a way that I can stabilize this genetics?
[01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:10.690]  And what is it called and how?
[01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:18.690]  It is called world. W.H.O.R.L.E.D. phylo taxi.
[01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.690]  It's just an abnormal growth pattern. There's nothing wrong with it.
[01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:28.690]  It's nothing to worry about.
[01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:33.690]  It doesn't affect the plant in any way. It won't affect the yield.
[01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:39.690]  You. Yeah, it's just it's a different growth pattern of the plant.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:50.860]  It's really, really common in not just cannabis.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.860]  It's really, really common in a lot of plants.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:57.860]  It's just a different type of branching pattern that happens to show up.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.860]  Sometimes. Like some people have blue eyes and some people have brown eyes.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.860]  It's nothing, literally nothing.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.860]  Would there be a way to like to breed into this Dutchie?
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.860]  You look like you want to jump in a little bit.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:18.860]  Like, what would you do to to get that started to hold that consistent?
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440]  I don't like why, why?
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.440]  Like, why would you want to?
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:34.440]  Because, first of all, like when the plant when the plant little and it's doing its branching thing and it starts out doing the opposite thing.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.440]  Once it starts getting bigger, it starts doing alternate branching.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.440]  Like it really doesn't matter.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.780]  It's just a thing that some some plants do.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:56.780]  Yeah, but at the same time, you just said blue eyes don't matter.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.780]  And I, for one, have blue eyes and I know they do matter.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:04.780]  Well, I don't. I don't.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.780]  I mean, in the grand scheme of things, is it?
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.780]  Wow. No, I'm not even going to go there.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780]  There is no grand scheme.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:16.780]  Yeah, he's totally pulling the chain.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.780]  OK, I'm just messing around.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:24.780]  I have brown eyes. I mean, they don't matter.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.780]  I never, never talk to a geneticist about the grand scheme.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.780]  A little bit. You know, historically, it's not a anyway.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.780]  Cannabis, Dr. Anubis.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:45.780]  The reasonings behind me wanting to keep this specific trait in line is my company Trinity Cannabis.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:52.780]  Three Sisters Cannabis is named after my three daughters.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.780]  And cannabis is amazing plant.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.780]  The ability for food, shelter and clothing.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.780]  And so it's marketing, Dr. Anubis. It's just marketing.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.780]  And a plant that can have three branches at every stage.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:13.780]  Wood, in theory, if you're only allowed four plants, have 50% more branches.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.780]  We all know if you grow a plant in a 300 liter pot, you can get a big plant.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.780]  It's just it's just a thing.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.780]  And Dutch blue eyes count as much as brown eyes.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:27.780]  But no, because it's not three.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:39.780]  You still only have one like apical node where like apical meristem where your your flowers are going to come from.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:47.780]  Just because you have three leaves branching off from the beginning doesn't mean that that branching pattern is going to continue.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:51.780]  And you're going to actually get three flowering points.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:24:04.780]  So although it's really, really cool, and I do suggest that you get as many as you can for marketing purposes, it's not necessarily going to like increase your your your.
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.780]  But I don't I don't remember what they're called the points where flowers grow.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.780]  You don't get three of those.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.780]  It's still it's just the three.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.780]  You know, it's called world phylotaxies, where the leaves come out.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780]  It's not your flowering sites.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.780]  Right. At least that's what I've seen.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.780]  Otherwise, I'm telling you completely wrong information.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:35.350]  So we there is there is a little comment here in chat.
[01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:41.350]  I think it's interesting to bring up because there's there's often these these random thoughts.
[01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:50.350]  So what polypolytism is is being stated as as an area of mutation here.
[01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:55.350]  Now, my understanding is polypolytism mutation is not as common as people think.
[01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:59.350]  Do you want to do you want to talk about polypolytism mutation a little bit?
[01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:01.350]  Dr. Anubis, before we.
[01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:08.350]  All right. Unless you actually fully like purposefully bred a polypolytism, you're not going to see a polypolytism in cannabis at all.
[01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:20.350]  So the the the instance of like three branches or that cresting pattern in the in the flower that I've talked about, you don't have a polyploid.
[01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:28.350]  You just don't. There's no natural polypolytism in cannabis that has ever happened.
[01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:32.350]  As far as I'm aware of, you have to induce it and it's not easy.
[01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:40.350]  There is a polyploid line that has been released by the Oregon CBD.
[01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.350]  And so they're they're hemp seeds.
[01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:51.350]  They do. They are triploid, so they can't be pollinated by nearby crops from hemp or cannabis plants.
[01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:57.350]  But, you know, you you you're not going to like grow five plants.
[01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:00.350]  One looks weird and that's a polyploid. That doesn't happen.
[01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:04.350]  It does not happen. And I'll fight everybody on this hill.
[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:07.350]  And so how how what is it?
[01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:13.350]  Can you define a little bit more detail what exactly a polyploid is and how it is formed and why it doesn't happen?
[01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:17.350]  All right. So a polyploid, a polyploid.
[01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:28.350]  OK, so we humans and a lot of organisms, most organisms that we're familiar with, including cannabis, are diploids,
[01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.350]  which means we have two copies of each of our chromosomes.
[01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:40.350]  We have 23 sets of chromosomes, so 46 total because we have duplicates of each of those 26 chromosomes.
[01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:43.350]  There are 23 chromosomes. Sorry.
[01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:49.350]  Cannabis has 10 chromosomes, so 20 altogether because it's diploid.
[01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:56.350]  A polyploid is going to have a another whole set of chromosomes.
[01:26:56.350 --> 01:27:00.350]  So like we you would never see a polyploid human.
[01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:07.350]  Nobody's ever going to have like I don't even know what's what's 23 times three.
[01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:11.350]  A lot. You wouldn't have a polyploid human.
[01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:22.350]  And plants have a higher propensity to be able to have a polyploid sort of situation because plants,
[01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:27.350]  they can't get up and run around and adapt as easily as as animals can.
[01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:34.350]  But you're never just going to like you're not going to have like a like a random polyploid that just pops up.
[01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:48.350]  So so for a polyploid cannabis plant to occur, what you would need to happen is you would have to create a whole doubling.
[01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:56.350]  So you'd have to have like four sets and then that would have to mate with a regular and then you know, it's a whole thing.
[01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:02.350]  It is a whole thing. It doesn't just pop up like you're not going to plant a seed and it's going to be a polyploid that doesn't happen.
[01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:09.350]  It has to be part of the crossing of a male and a female that have and it usually happens interspecies.
[01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:14.350]  And as we know, as I hope most people know, cannabis is one species.
[01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:19.350]  And even if you don't think they are, they all have the same number of chromosomes.
[01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:35.350]  There is no chance that the chromosomes are just going to all of a sudden duplicate or it would be really so weird and just not going to happen.
[01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:43.350]  So if you think you have a polyploid, I can 100% guarantee you don't.
[01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:49.350]  You just have a mutation that's showing a strange way of creating a bud.
[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.350]  Yes.
[01:28:52.350 --> 01:29:00.350]  So, yeah, is polyploid and triploid the same thing or is polyploid like could be triploid and greater.
[01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:05.350]  So polyploid means multiple and multiploid.
[01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.350]  So we are diploid meaning two ploid.
[01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.350]  We have two chromosomes. Triploid means three ploid, three chromosomes.
[01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:14.350]  Tetraploid is four ploid, four chromosomes.
[01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:22.350]  Polyploid means multiple, meaning more than, usually refers to more than diploid.
[01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:24.350]  More than diploid.
[01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:28.350]  Right. So a triploid is a polyploid, a tetraploid is a polyploid.
[01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:34.350]  So the strawberries that you buy at the supermarket, for example, are octoploids.
[01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:37.350]  We made them that way because we like big fat strawberries.
[01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:40.350]  I don't know if anyone's ever been on a hike and seen a natural strawberry.
[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:42.350]  They are very small.
[01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:45.350]  I mean, they're delicious, but literally they're like a centimeter.
[01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:47.350]  It's not like you have to eat a lot.
[01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:51.350]  I prefer the octoploid ones that we have at the grocery store.
[01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:59.350]  And they are bigger and they are juicier because in order to fit those eight sets of chromosomes into a cell, you need a lot more space.
[01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:03.350]  So same number of cells, but needs a lot more space.
[01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:05.350]  So they just end up being bigger.
[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:07.350]  We do not have anything like that in cannabis.
[01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:16.350]  And actually the triploid, the triploids that we have, they're not really that much more robust, bigger.
[01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:19.350]  You know, they don't have much more biomass.
[01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:21.350]  They're not impressive.
[01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.350]  The impressive thing is that they can't cross.
[01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:33.350]  Well, those, wasn't the Oregon CBD guy claiming that he was getting basically triple potency, like, you know, 60%?
[01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:34.350]  No, they never claimed that.
[01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:36.350]  No, they never claimed that.
[01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.350]  Okay.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.620]  Guys, I have to run.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.620]  I have a cannabis book club that I have to go to.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:50.620]  But I hope that I answered your questions on the polyploidy.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.620]  Happy to pick it up next week if anybody else wants to fight with me.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:57.620]  Or ask more questions.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.620]  I don't want to fight with you at all.
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.620]  I want to just talk more about growing.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:05.620]  Because I actually grew some of those triploid seedlings this last year.
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:10.620]  And then also have had like just polyploids in the breeding and different things.
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.620]  And just like the subtle differences also.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.620]  And, you know, I definitely saw some subtle variation anomalies in the triploid seeds.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.620]  And just, I was trying to find photos because I did.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.620]  I know I have some like weird stuff of poly, like just weirder polyploid.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.620]  You should text me tomorrow because I have a picture of somebody that made,
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.620]  confirmed, I think it was tetraploid or maybe it was an octoploid?
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:42.620]  Sick, like really, really sick, horrible, poor looking plant.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.620]  Like, not going to work.
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.620]  That's kind of, that's kind of, where like I also haven't seen the proof.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:49.620]  I mean like it's, there's some weird things.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.620]  Like so maybe we should continue the triploid polyploid conversation.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.620]  It would be a great conversation.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.620]  Because I have some stock that's claimed to be that.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:02.620]  And the guy that I'm working with, he's pretty reputable.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.620]  So.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.620]  Well, but also you have to like go back to the breeder to get seeds.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.620]  So it's like one of those things where it's like, you know, we can't like,
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.620]  you can't breed with it.
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.620]  You can take cuts of it and like, we just don't fully, we need more information.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.620]  It's like, we're just really starting to play with this stuff as far as cannabis goes.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.620]  So it's fascinating conversation also.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.620]  Yeah. I'd love to pick this up.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.620]  This is like the stuff I love to hear about.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:30.620]  And you know, because I, you know, mutations and stuff are part of my passion.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620]  So I really try to keep up on that literature.
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.620]  So anything I can bring to the table also is like super, I think,
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.620]  helpful for everybody to know.
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.620]  But also I want to hear what else other people are doing.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.620]  To make one or, you know, whatever the case may be.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:50.620]  So I'd love to pick it up, but I, my friends are going to be mad at me if I don't.
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.620]  Oh, by the way, I found that my...
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.620]  We can hear you in the background, Anna.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.620]  We can hear the conversation.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.620]  I know. I have to go.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.620]  All right. All right. I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, guys. Bye.
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:07.620]  And we do actually get to our about an hour and a half here.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:09.620]  Where'd Matt go? Did he go? Disappeared.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.620]  I guess he didn't have his question for the day.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.620]  We are at the hour and a half mark.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.620]  So we will be finishing up in about an hour and a half.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.620]  Before the day.
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.620]  We appreciate each and every one of you.
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.620]  And I'm looking forward to having this conversation next week.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:33.620]  So that's it. You know, if you're in chat, you know, Latulip Noir, you're there.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.620]  I see you. I see everybody that's interested in this subject.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.620]  Let's bring this up. Let's dig deep.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:40.620]  And let's battle out.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:46.620]  Let's fight and find out what's going on about polypoloid and diploid and everything like that.
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.620]  So just bring your info. Oh, there's Matt.
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:49.620]  You came back. Awesome.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.620]  Did you have something?
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:53.620]  Oh, did you want to say something?
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:55.620]  Did you want a closing statement for the day?
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.620]  You plug the closing statement for the day, brother.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.620]  Oh, you're so sweet. Honestly, I'll quote.
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:02.620]  I have a question, though, for Dutch.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.620]  I, I damn do. But I mean, obviously you get into there.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:11.620]  But I guess there might be more people that want to know, because the way that you worded it, I was curious.
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:17.620]  For the conference, are you doing proof of attendance protocol style?
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.620]  Like non fungible tokens?
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:25.620]  Yes, but on the back end.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:34.620]  So I'm just honestly slow to figuring it out and figuring out how to implement the concept.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:41.620]  And so classic style, you know, jumped in with my mouth before I had it all figured out.
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.620]  And so it's what I want to do.
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.620]  So we're doing the conference now.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.620]  I'm going to ship seeds out in March.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:35:00.620]  And in the interim, I'm hoping to figure it out and be able to mail out, email out to everybody the NFT on the back end.
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:02.620]  Does that make sense?
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.620]  Yeah, no, totally. It makes 100 percent sense.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:13.620]  And I guess anyone that's listening or whatever that's like super kind of interested in this.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:27.620]  I mean, I don't know if I should really, but like, Dutch and I have been kind of him hauling about working with some of these like cryptos to make like a seed to sale.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:37.620]  So if you guys have any new kind of experience, we have one that we have our eyes on that is a really good utility.
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:43.620]  And to create this, we'll take a bunch of different people.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.620]  And I was actually going to message you.
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.620]  There's a dude that's going to be at the conference.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.620]  Let me see if I can find his name real quick.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:56.620]  He's going to speak about genetics in the blockchain.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.620]  I said, well, I am going to shut down this.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:03.620]  I'm going to leave it open for you guys to finish the chat.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:05.620]  I'm just going to shut down the future cannabis.
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:07.620]  No problem. We can continue.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620]  I'm just going to close it out there for the chat.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:43.620]  I'm going to fastball at the conversation when it comes down to getting into polypolitism and mutations and stuff like that.
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.620]  Because there's so much more about this.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:50.620]  And it's such an in-depth topic that it creates a lot of questions out of it.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:54.620]  So I really hope you enjoyed having the conversation with us.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:02.620]  And I do. I make jest and challenges that we, you know, jest and battle it out.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.620]  But the fact is that we need to accumulate our knowledge together.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:12.620]  And that conversations like these can help illuminate and create more learning for them.
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:18.620]  Imagine if you don't read a paper and it's the one that you oversee and it has so much relevance to this situation.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:24.620]  Imagine being given that paper and getting to read it and finding out more information at that point in time.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:30.620]  So we all have the ability to be able to do that, share and create further knowledge as a team and everything like that.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:36.620]  So let's do it together. Come here every week on Wednesday. Dig deep and enjoy the conversation.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:38.620]  Ciao!
