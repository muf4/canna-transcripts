[00:00.960 --> 00:08.960]  And we are live. Good morning everyone. Happy Sunday. James, why don't you take it away?
[00:08.960 --> 00:16.960]  Hey, how's it going? Thank you guys for tuning in. So, our guest Chris from Compound will be joining us next Sunday.
[00:16.960 --> 00:22.960]  He's not feeling well today and we're going to do it from the Node Lab in San Francisco.
[00:22.960 --> 00:31.960]  It's going to be fun. So, sorry about that guys. We should have a good time. If you guys have questions, make sure to send them to me.
[00:31.960 --> 00:38.960]  I think it's going to be great. He gave me some apples and bananas last week when I went to lunch with him.
[00:38.960 --> 00:47.960]  I have to say, this new strain is something super special. We're going to be talking a lot about it.
[00:47.960 --> 00:54.960]  Some of his other collaborations and things that he's doing.
[00:54.960 --> 01:02.960]  The friggin' apples and bananas though. I don't know if you guys have ever tried Y Life, but it reminds me of the Y Life Terps on steroids.
[01:02.960 --> 01:09.960]  It's really the only way I can describe it. It's got a lot of flavor, a lot of terps. The terps are testing in the 6% plus.
[01:10.960 --> 01:18.960]  Since we're not doing a regular show this week, we can do some Q&A. Also, I wanted to give away some stuff.
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.960]  We're going to give away some t-shirts. Someone said that Glue Lottos are doing amazing.
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.960]  We can start off with a pack of Glue Lotto. I guess we'll do some trivia.
[01:32.960 --> 01:42.960]  I guess the first trivia question is going to be, where can you buy Ganja Farmer and Loud Canagenic Seeds?
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.960]  It can be a two-part question.
[01:45.960 --> 02:01.640]  That's such a softball. There we go, Shredder. Oh my god. Before that, we had Judo Low.
[02:02.640 --> 02:12.640]  Judo Low. Oh wow, we got people spelling Dagadop Love wrong. Awesome. You have that recorded, Peter?
[02:12.640 --> 02:21.640]  Hold on one second. Let me make sure the YouTube live chat.
[02:22.640 --> 02:34.640]  Ganja Farmer Seed Company is going to be launching on a new website for seed sales starting the month of April.
[02:34.640 --> 02:41.640]  We're going to be running a whole bunch of specials. The first person that guesses what website that is,
[02:42.640 --> 02:48.640]  is going to get a pack of Jaffata Seeds from Ganja Farmer Seed Company.
[02:48.640 --> 03:00.110]  That's question number two. He's been on my show. He's a good friend.
[03:00.110 --> 03:06.110]  Oh, there we go. I see seeds here now from Philip Carden. Seeds here now.
[03:06.110 --> 03:13.110]  If you guys want to get Ganja Farmer Seeds, we're actually in Skunk Magazine. There's a big article.
[03:13.110 --> 03:20.110]  It's one of the best issues of Skunk Magazine that I've ever read. It's got everybody from Short Brooks to Alex Gray
[03:20.110 --> 03:26.110]  to my buddy Pelly that was on the show. I think that launches April 1st.
[03:26.110 --> 03:31.110]  We are sending our seeds. They're going to be available at Seeds here now as well starting April 1st.
[03:31.110 --> 03:35.110]  I saw James in the chat, so a big shout out to James Bean.
[03:37.640 --> 03:40.640]  Okay, sorry. Who won the second one?
[03:41.640 --> 03:48.640]  We are going to have to go to, scroll back. I see.
[03:48.640 --> 03:58.640]  Philip Carden, I believe, is the winner winner chicken dinner right there. Philip Carden.
[04:02.930 --> 04:06.930]  Then we got some questions from the chat. I guess let's go ahead and get some questions.
[04:06.930 --> 04:14.930]  Advice for a first time seed buyer. Man, I would say do a lot of research. I think that's the biggest thing.
[04:14.930 --> 04:20.930]  If you're a first time seed buyer, there's so many different varieties. Don't go for the best advertising.
[04:20.930 --> 04:27.930]  Really get in deep with the research. There's tons of good seeds available out there.
[04:27.930 --> 04:32.930]  It depends. I think there's two types of people buying seeds.
[04:32.930 --> 04:37.930]  There's people buying seeds as collectors, and there's people buying seeds as growers.
[04:37.930 --> 04:42.930]  As a seed producer, I can totally appreciate both.
[04:42.930 --> 04:49.930]  If you're trying to find seeds that are going to have long-term resale value, that are going to go up in price,
[04:49.930 --> 04:57.930]  and going to be worth something, you want to look at those hot commodities, those varieties from companies.
[04:58.930 --> 05:04.930]  They launch, I guess, specifically companies that sell...
[05:04.930 --> 05:09.930]  If you have a chance to get some of that root beer from Mean Gene, for instance,
[05:09.930 --> 05:13.930]  something like that's going to be worth a lot of money down the road.
[05:13.930 --> 05:17.930]  It's also pretty amazing from what I've seen. I haven't smoked it yet.
[05:17.930 --> 05:24.930]  There's this whole collection model where people are buying seeds to hold onto them and potentially resell them down the road.
[05:25.930 --> 05:30.930]  That's great. If you're looking at buying stuff that's amazing, you want to buy stuff that's been tested.
[05:30.930 --> 05:35.930]  Not all the breeders test. I think there's tons of good breeders.
[05:35.930 --> 05:39.930]  Seed Junkie, Aficionado, just to name a couple.
[05:39.930 --> 05:45.930]  Also, local California guys. You get our stuff, Loud Canagenics, if you're looking for that.
[05:45.930 --> 05:52.930]  It's also, as a seed buyer, if you're going to be growing it, what are you looking for?
[05:53.930 --> 05:56.930]  Are you looking for something that does well outdoor?
[05:56.930 --> 06:03.930]  DNA has some amazing... We were just talking about their... It's a Lemon Cross.
[06:03.930 --> 06:05.930]  What do we got there?
[06:05.930 --> 06:10.930]  Just quickly, this is because Shredder is complaining that he answered first.
[06:11.930 --> 06:15.930]  I see Philip Tierra, Good Morning Brother Chad Westport.
[06:15.930 --> 06:19.930]  Then I see right below that, Judah Lowe, Daga.
[06:20.930 --> 06:24.930]  So Shredder, unless I'm missing something on the YouTube live chat...
[06:25.930 --> 06:29.930]  This is the thing I hate when we try to do fun stuff and people complain.
[06:30.930 --> 06:36.930]  Anyway, that is what I'm looking at. If anybody thinks it played out differently...
[06:39.930 --> 06:43.930]  I was going to say... I don't really feel like having you bring it up with me.
[06:43.930 --> 06:50.930]  Anyway, that's the live chat that I am basing Judah Lowe as the winner of.
[06:51.930 --> 06:53.930]  Anyway, Jams, carry on.
[06:54.930 --> 06:57.930]  I was talking about DNA Golden Lemons.
[06:57.930 --> 07:00.930]  We're going to get Don and Aaron on the show one of these days.
[07:00.930 --> 07:06.930]  As far as if you're looking for a great outdoor variety to grow, I think Golden Lemons is pretty amazing.
[07:06.930 --> 07:10.930]  It stacks up. The turps are ridiculous if you like lemon turps.
[07:11.930 --> 07:17.930]  I would say it's like lemon zest turps. You get these lemon zest and gas. It's really amazing.
[07:19.930 --> 07:24.930]  I think Sasquatch from Aficionado is another... No, it's not Sasquatch.
[07:24.930 --> 07:30.930]  It's a juggernaut from Aficionado if you're looking for some monster plant that produces amazing stuff.
[07:30.930 --> 07:32.930]  If you can still find that.
[07:33.930 --> 07:36.930]  If you're looking for gelatos, everybody's got gelatos.
[07:37.930 --> 07:39.930]  Mike from Xotic, I've seen a lot of his stuff.
[07:39.930 --> 07:45.930]  If you're looking for some really amazing Runtz crosses, Xotic Genetics has them.
[07:45.930 --> 07:53.930]  Modern Pyganics, I believe the late Michael Hinden, he created some interesting Runtz crosses before he passed.
[07:53.930 --> 07:56.930]  They're available through Modern Pyganics.
[07:59.930 --> 08:01.930]  Let's see. What other questions we got, guys?
[08:02.930 --> 08:07.840]  Nine-pound penis envy. That's great.
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.840]  Nine-pound hammer, that's another interesting one.
[08:11.840 --> 08:13.840]  It really depends on what you're going for, man.
[08:13.840 --> 08:16.840]  Xotic Genetics is fire, somebody said. Archive is decent.
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.840]  It's funny. I'm from Portland originally. I was born in Portland.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.840]  A lot of great seed companies. We're hopefully going to do a special.
[08:28.840 --> 08:30.840]  We're going to do a special on Portland and all the breeders.
[08:31.840 --> 08:34.840]  What makes Portland so special and why are these awesome breeders?
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.840]  James Bean, tell us about your chef background.
[08:39.840 --> 08:42.840]  That's a great thing to talk about.
[08:44.840 --> 08:46.840]  On and off, I've been a chef my whole life.
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.840]  Actually, before I was a chef, I was a computer engineer.
[08:50.840 --> 08:52.840]  This was back Y2K era.
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.840]  Then I got laid off from Charles Schwab.
[08:55.840 --> 08:57.840]  Got a substantial amount of money.
[08:58.840 --> 09:01.840]  I was also growing cannabis the whole time.
[09:02.840 --> 09:05.840]  I had a family member who told me I needed a backup plan
[09:06.840 --> 09:08.840]  because what I was doing was totally illegal and made a lot of sense.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.840]  I went to culinary school.
[09:12.840 --> 09:14.840]  My father was friends with a master chef.
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.840]  My mother was a pastry chef growing up.
[09:17.840 --> 09:20.840]  I had a lot of advantages in learning.
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.840]  I worked at Chez Panisse, which is a really good restaurant in Berkeley, California.
[09:26.840 --> 09:27.840]  Worked there for a little bit.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.840]  I worked at golf courses.
[09:31.840 --> 09:32.840]  I was an executive chef.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.840]  I haven't cooked in a while.
[09:35.840 --> 09:36.840]  I've been really focusing on cannabis.
[09:37.840 --> 09:41.840]  It's been almost four years now since I worked in the kitchen.
[09:42.840 --> 09:43.840]  I still love it.
[09:44.840 --> 09:46.840]  I feel like a lot of what you do in a kitchen can translate.
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.840]  Cannabis and chef life and kitchen work.
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.840]  I feel like people that work in a kitchen would do well in a grow and vice versa.
[09:57.840 --> 10:00.840]  It takes a certain type of person to be able to grow plants.
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.840]  Breeding and being a chef adds value to the whole breeding process
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.840]  and to be able to phenohunt, differentiate smells.
[10:11.840 --> 10:13.840]  It's all about developing your palate.
[10:14.840 --> 10:18.840]  How I look at it is with food and everything else,
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.840]  throughout your life we gather these data points.
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.840]  Every time you smell something, you have a new data point.
[10:27.840 --> 10:28.840]  You have something to compare and contrast.
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.840]  The more data points you have, whether it's in the kitchen with cannabis,
[10:34.840 --> 10:38.840]  these are all important data points that make you more educated as far as your palate.
[10:39.840 --> 10:42.840]  What you want to do is you want to smell and you want to taste everything.
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.840]  The wider, the more vast amount of things you can contribute to that palate,
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.840]  you're going to be able to start understanding layers of flavor
[10:54.840 --> 10:56.840]  and how things smell good or taste good together.
[10:57.840 --> 11:00.840]  Whether that's in the kitchen or with your next variety.
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.840]  I worked for Lagunitas Brewery.
[11:06.840 --> 11:09.840]  I was their executive chef for the beer circus.
[11:10.840 --> 11:11.840]  I traveled around the country.
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.840]  It started out as a small thing.
[11:14.840 --> 11:16.840]  I did it for 10 years as a volunteer originally.
[11:17.840 --> 11:20.840]  Once they got acquired by Heineken, I went.
[11:21.840 --> 11:23.840]  We traveled around the United States doing these beer circus events,
[11:24.840 --> 11:31.840]  which was a combination of music, beer, Jim Rose circus fair type events.
[11:32.840 --> 11:33.840]  It was absolutely amazing.
[11:34.840 --> 11:36.840]  If you ever have a chance to go to one of the Lagunitas,
[11:37.840 --> 11:38.840]  Lagunitas is very cannabis friendly.
[11:39.840 --> 11:40.840]  I've been friends with those guys for a really long time.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  They're very pro cannabis.
[11:43.840 --> 11:45.840]  It was really good stuff, man.
[11:46.840 --> 11:49.840]  Where's the damn skunk at?
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.840]  I've seen the seeds for sale, but I have yet to see roadkill skunk.
[11:57.840 --> 11:58.840]  That's a big one, guys.
[11:59.840 --> 12:00.840]  Can't wait.
[12:01.840 --> 12:02.840]  GDP is still alive and well.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.840]  It's an interesting strain.
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.840]  We all love or did love it at one point.
[12:09.840 --> 12:10.840]  I think the turps are great.
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.840]  Apples and bananas has GDP in it.
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.840]  We'll be talking about that hopefully on Sunday.
[12:19.840 --> 12:22.840]  As far as, where were we going with that?
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.840]  GDP.
[12:25.840 --> 12:26.840]  It's still alive and well.
[12:27.840 --> 12:28.840]  It just takes 31 days to veg.
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.840]  I'm not a huge fan of growing anything that takes 31 days to veg.
[12:31.840 --> 12:34.840]  It needs to be crossed into new varieties and grown out.
[12:35.840 --> 12:38.840]  We need to move on and evolve from some of the older strains.
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.840]  Let's see.
[12:40.840 --> 12:41.840]  Matt, where are we?
[12:42.840 --> 12:43.840]  Skunk number one.
[12:44.840 --> 12:45.840]  No roadkill skunk.
[12:46.840 --> 12:47.840]  I have yet to see it.
[12:48.840 --> 12:49.840]  If you've got it, send me a message.
[12:50.840 --> 12:51.840]  Let's smoke.
[12:52.840 --> 12:53.840]  Same thing with cat piss.
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.840]  I'm waiting.
[12:56.840 --> 12:57.840]  I feel like I'm really getting close to getting the cat piss.
[12:58.840 --> 13:01.840]  I've actually got to experience what the SoCal cat piss turps are.
[13:02.840 --> 13:05.840]  As far as the cat piss turps from the Bay Area, I'm still waiting.
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.840]  I've got some seeds from 707.
[13:07.840 --> 13:09.840]  Jaynetix is getting his stuff through Node.
[13:10.840 --> 13:12.840]  We'll probably be talking about that on Sunday a little bit.
[13:13.840 --> 13:15.840]  Those turps I hope are coming back.
[13:16.840 --> 13:18.840]  Roadkill is gone.
[13:19.840 --> 13:23.840]  I saw Blue Vienna was on some roadkill skunk seeds.
[13:24.840 --> 13:25.840]  Maybe people just need to go through more of them.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.840]  It's something that's going to come back, I hope.
[13:29.840 --> 13:32.840]  As of yet, we have no RKS.
[13:33.840 --> 13:38.520]  AgSeeds company skunk number one, week 4.
[13:40.920 --> 13:41.920]  It looks and smells legit.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.920]  Skunk number one is not roadkill skunk, though.
[13:45.920 --> 13:47.920]  Skunk number one is definitely more of a sweeter.
[13:48.920 --> 13:51.920]  I think it's good.
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.920]  I think skunk number one is amazing.
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.920]  In fact, lemon skunk is a skunk number one.
[13:58.920 --> 14:00.920]  Michigan skunk is a skunk number one.
[14:01.920 --> 14:02.920]  It's been bred into a lot of things.
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.920]  There's a lot of different versions of it.
[14:04.920 --> 14:05.920]  It's been bred into a lot of things.
[14:06.920 --> 14:07.920]  There are different phenotypes of that skunk number one.
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.920]  Someone said, I thought Todd McCormick has RKS.
[14:12.920 --> 14:13.920]  If he does, I have yet to see it.
[14:14.920 --> 14:15.920]  I know Todd.
[14:16.920 --> 14:19.920]  As far as the actual true nose-burning roadkill,
[14:20.920 --> 14:24.920]  side-of-the-road-smelling skunk that you'd see at the dead shows back in the day,
[14:25.920 --> 14:26.920]  I haven't seen it.
[14:31.310 --> 14:34.310]  Let's see.
[14:35.310 --> 14:37.310]  Definitely on the sweet side, not the skunk side.
[14:38.310 --> 14:40.310]  Cheese comes from skunk number one.
[14:41.310 --> 14:43.310]  There are so many great varieties that come from that.
[14:44.310 --> 14:47.310]  Skunk number one has been bred into a ton of stuff.
[14:50.310 --> 14:54.310]  Sam the skunk man bred the skunk turps right out, somebody said.
[15:00.050 --> 15:02.050]  CSI Humboldt has some fire, that is for sure.
[15:03.050 --> 15:05.050]  I can totally agree with that.
[15:06.050 --> 15:12.880]  GDP Skittles has skunk number one down.
[15:12.880 --> 15:15.880]  We got big smiles on the cheese, I agree.
[15:18.350 --> 15:20.350]  You guys got any new questions?
[15:21.350 --> 15:23.350]  How about we talk about...
[15:24.350 --> 15:30.050]  No, Peter, you got anything good?
[15:31.050 --> 15:32.050]  You're muted.
[15:33.050 --> 15:35.050]  While we're waiting for a question.
[15:36.050 --> 15:37.050]  Yes.
[15:38.050 --> 15:39.050]  Here we go.
[15:40.050 --> 15:41.050]  Here's a Chad.
[15:42.050 --> 15:43.050]  We got a Chad.
[15:44.050 --> 15:45.050]  Have you ever...
[15:45.050 --> 15:46.050]  Sure.
[15:47.050 --> 15:48.050]  Long 4x4.
[15:49.050 --> 15:52.050]  I started out growing in a closet, it wasn't even a 4x4.
[15:53.050 --> 15:56.050]  It was like a 3x6 maybe or something like that.
[15:57.050 --> 16:02.050]  I was 17 years old living with two friends in a one bedroom apartment
[16:03.050 --> 16:05.050]  in Pleasant Hill, California.
[16:06.050 --> 16:08.050]  We were growing...
[16:09.050 --> 16:11.050]  I guess even before that I was growing smaller.
[16:12.050 --> 16:13.050]  I had one of those...
[16:13.050 --> 16:15.050]  What do they call it with the lights on the side of it?
[16:16.050 --> 16:18.050]  The little boxes, the phototrons.
[16:19.050 --> 16:22.050]  I cut the top off and put a 400 watt light on the top of it.
[16:23.050 --> 16:24.050]  Good times.
[16:25.050 --> 16:27.050]  The closet girl that I had, I decided I was going to go snowboarding
[16:28.050 --> 16:30.050]  and I had my roommate water the plants.
[16:31.050 --> 16:33.050]  I said, make sure you water them a couple of times.
[16:34.050 --> 16:36.050]  They're in smaller pots so they need to be watered regularly.
[16:37.050 --> 16:40.050]  I said, this fish emulsion here, one tablespoon to one gallon.
[16:41.050 --> 16:44.050]  He was a big time stoner, my buddy Randy.
[16:45.050 --> 16:50.050]  He put one gallon of fish emulsion into the plants.
[16:51.050 --> 16:53.050]  I don't even remember what strain it was.
[16:54.050 --> 16:56.050]  It was probably four weeks out from being...
[16:57.050 --> 16:59.050]  Not even four weeks, it was like six weeks out.
[17:00.050 --> 17:02.050]  It was still where the buds were developing but you couldn't get the smell out of it.
[17:03.050 --> 17:05.050]  It ended up being like a salmon smelling bud.
[17:06.050 --> 17:07.050]  This is back...
[17:07.050 --> 17:11.050]  I'm 44 now, so this is almost 30 years ago.
[17:12.050 --> 17:14.050]  Lots of fun.
[17:15.050 --> 17:17.050]  Randy fucked it up, that is for sure.
[17:19.050 --> 17:20.050]  Yeah.
[17:21.050 --> 17:22.050]  I see that question on the screen.
[17:23.050 --> 17:25.050]  I'm doing my first open pollination, just finished week three.
[17:26.050 --> 17:27.050]  Pollen is everywhere.
[17:28.050 --> 17:30.050]  When can I take down the males and let the ladies ride?
[17:31.050 --> 17:32.050]  That's a great question.
[17:33.050 --> 17:35.050]  I actually have some pictures but what you want to do is you want to see...
[17:35.050 --> 17:36.050]  You want to look at the pistils.
[17:37.050 --> 17:42.050]  Once the pistils start to dry up, they turn orange once the pollen is taken.
[17:43.050 --> 17:44.050]  Then you can check the brack.
[17:45.050 --> 17:47.050]  Once the brack, the little teardrop has swollen up.
[17:48.050 --> 17:52.050]  I would say honestly, if you're doing an open pollination like that,
[17:53.050 --> 17:54.050]  give it a couple of weeks.
[17:55.050 --> 17:57.050]  If there's pollen flying everywhere, once you start getting orange pistils,
[17:58.050 --> 18:01.050]  once you see everything's caught, then you can actually pull them out.
[18:02.050 --> 18:04.580]  I have some pictures.
[18:05.580 --> 18:06.580]  I think I'm going to be posting some pictures on my Instagram.
[18:07.580 --> 18:08.580]  Check my Instagram feed.
[18:09.580 --> 18:12.580]  I'll be posting pictures of what it looks like when the pollen takes.
[18:13.580 --> 18:15.580]  When you're doing an open pollination with live plants,
[18:16.580 --> 18:17.580]  it definitely works better.
[18:18.580 --> 18:23.580]  If you're pollinating with a bag like I've described using a compost tea bag
[18:24.580 --> 18:26.580]  or if you're shaking dry plants over your other plants,
[18:27.580 --> 18:30.580]  you may have to do it a couple of times for them to get really good pollen.
[18:30.580 --> 18:34.580]  Do it a couple of times for them to get really good as far as the pollination being super even.
[18:42.600 --> 18:44.600]  Someone said, is this compound genetics on the right?
[18:45.600 --> 18:46.600]  No, that is Peter on the right.
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.600]  We have compound coming next week.
[18:50.600 --> 18:51.600]  I apologize again.
[18:52.600 --> 18:53.600]  Chris will be coming on next week.
[18:54.600 --> 18:55.600]  We're going to do it over at Node hopefully.
[18:56.600 --> 18:57.600]  There's a question on the screen.
[18:58.600 --> 19:03.600]  Can you talk a bit about autos regarding flowering time hours?
[19:04.600 --> 19:05.600]  I would love to.
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.600]  I think the sweet spot is 20 hours of light, 4 hours of darkness.
[19:11.600 --> 19:16.600]  You can do it 18, you can do it 16, you can do it 12, 12, but I think you're going to get indoor.
[19:17.600 --> 19:21.600]  You're going to get by far the best results, auto flowers with 20 and 4.
[19:22.600 --> 19:23.600]  That's my opinion.
[19:24.600 --> 19:26.600]  You might hear different things from different people.
[19:27.600 --> 19:29.600]  Then I read something about a paintbrush.
[19:30.600 --> 19:31.600]  We used to use paintbrushes.
[19:31.600 --> 19:38.600]  I have an airbrush, but I also really like a toothbrush for pollen, believe it or not.
[19:39.600 --> 19:45.600]  How that works is, I wish I had a toothbrush, but we have a thing of pollen right here.
[19:46.600 --> 19:48.600]  We have some desiccant packs to keep it extra dry.
[19:49.600 --> 19:52.600]  What we're going to do is we're going to shake that pollen on the side.
[19:53.600 --> 19:56.600]  We're going to move it back so you have pollen on the wall of this jar.
[19:57.600 --> 20:02.600]  Then with that pollen, you're going to actually take and you're going to go put the toothbrush in there,
[20:03.600 --> 20:04.600]  not directly on the pollen, but on the wall.
[20:05.600 --> 20:06.600]  Then you're just going to lightly brush.
[20:07.600 --> 20:12.600]  You can flick it with your thumb if you want to flick it onto the pistils,
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.600]  or if you just want to lightly brush it if you're going over lots of plants, you can just lightly brush it.
[20:18.600 --> 20:19.600]  Super simple.
[20:20.600 --> 20:21.600]  Also, we got the airbrush sprayer.
[20:22.600 --> 20:25.600]  If you're using a makeup sprayer that's for powder makeup, those work great.
[20:26.600 --> 20:27.600]  Those work really well.
[20:28.600 --> 20:30.600]  When should you defoliate autos and how many times?
[20:31.600 --> 20:33.600]  I am not a big fan of defoliating.
[20:34.600 --> 20:35.600]  If they have enough space, they don't need it.
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.600]  If they're really crowded, you're going to have to pull some of the fan leaves a couple times maybe.
[20:43.600 --> 20:46.600]  Autos, really, you don't need to do much with them.
[20:47.600 --> 20:48.600]  That's one of the beauties of it.
[20:49.600 --> 20:50.600]  Fingerprint brush.
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.600]  Go ahead.
[20:54.600 --> 20:55.600]  Here we go.
[20:56.600 --> 20:57.600]  That was good.
[21:00.600 --> 21:02.600]  I had pollen in my lungs for 10 days.
[21:03.600 --> 21:04.600]  It was terrible, worse than COVID.
[21:05.600 --> 21:06.600]  How do you choose your genetic?
[21:07.600 --> 21:11.600]  This is an interesting thing because we just ran through this in one of the rooms that we hit.
[21:12.600 --> 21:16.600]  Me and one of my buddies, I got bad asthma from it.
[21:17.600 --> 21:18.600]  It's because pollen is so fine.
[21:19.600 --> 21:20.600]  It can go deep in your lungs.
[21:21.600 --> 21:24.600]  I'm slightly allergic to dry plant material.
[21:24.600 --> 21:26.600]  He's not, but the pollen even got him.
[21:27.600 --> 21:29.600]  Then our other buddy didn't infect him at all.
[21:30.600 --> 21:31.600]  Pollen is so fine.
[21:32.600 --> 21:36.600]  I don't think it's necessarily bad, but if you're allergic to it, it can really screw you up.
[21:37.600 --> 21:40.600]  I don't know about worse than COVID, but it's definitely not a good thing.
[21:41.600 --> 21:47.600]  I just coined the term finger painting pollen on because Leo from Aficionado has a tech that works really good.
[21:48.600 --> 21:52.600]  It's similar to what we used to use back in the day in Sonoma with my partner, Luke,
[21:52.600 --> 21:57.600]  where you take the pollen on your fingers and you'd actually touch the plant.
[21:58.600 --> 21:59.600]  It works okay.
[22:00.600 --> 22:03.600]  I feel like the toothbrush is more effective in my opinion.
[22:04.600 --> 22:09.600]  I think maybe you waste less if you're just doing a couple of buds here and there using your fingers and finger painting with the pollen.
[22:10.600 --> 22:11.600]  That's great.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.600]  Some people get bad reactions around pollen.
[22:16.600 --> 22:19.600]  It's just, when are you sending out the lab shirts?
[22:19.600 --> 22:24.600]  I'll be sending them out on Monday and we'll be giving one away in about six minutes.
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.600]  We're going to end it a little early today, guys.
[22:28.600 --> 22:32.600]  Hopefully, you guys will be here next week when we do the interview over at Node.
[22:36.600 --> 22:38.600]  Electric toothbrush works like a B.
[22:39.600 --> 22:48.600]  The electric toothbrush, that works really good on tomatoes because tomatoes have the pollen inside the flowers.
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.600]  Basically, they pollinate in each one.
[22:51.600 --> 22:55.600]  Using that electric toothbrush, you don't even use the actual toothbrush.
[22:56.600 --> 22:58.600]  You just use the electric part of it that vibrates.
[22:59.600 --> 23:00.600]  That shakes the pollen.
[23:01.600 --> 23:10.600]  If you're doing tomatoes and you're not trying to make new varieties, if you're just trying to get them to take so you have fruit, that's a great way to do it.
[23:12.600 --> 23:13.600]  Someone said something about a Q-tip.
[23:14.600 --> 23:15.600]  Q-tips work good.
[23:16.600 --> 23:17.600]  I've seen Q-tips work.
[23:18.600 --> 23:25.600]  The thing is, once it gets sticky when you have a problem, using that little Q-tip to try to pollinate a bunch of plants.
[23:26.600 --> 23:28.600]  If you're just doing one plant, there's a million ways you can do it successfully.
[23:29.600 --> 23:34.600]  If you're trying to pollinate 600 or 1,000 or 2,000 plants, it's a whole different ballgame.
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.600]  Someone says, where's Compound again?
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.600]  Tune in next week. We will have Compound on here.
[23:42.600 --> 23:44.600]  He's not the guy on the left.
[23:45.600 --> 23:46.600]  No, that guy's in a hotel room, actually.
[23:48.600 --> 23:49.600]  The guy on the left.
[24:04.650 --> 24:05.650]  Sorry, James. Just got there.
[24:06.650 --> 24:07.650]  No problem, man. I'm glad you tuned in.
[24:09.650 --> 24:10.650]  Yeah, you missed the giveaway.
[24:11.650 --> 24:12.650]  We were doing some trivia.
[24:20.910 --> 24:22.910]  Let's see. How about some chocolate tie, James?
[24:23.910 --> 24:24.910]  It's funny. Chocolate tie is amazing.
[24:25.910 --> 24:26.910]  Some good chocolatey stuff.
[24:27.910 --> 24:30.910]  I feel like some really potent stuff comes from Thailand.
[24:31.910 --> 24:35.910]  The tie stick, too. My friend came across some tie stick maybe eight years ago.
[24:36.910 --> 24:38.910]  If you scroll down on the Loud Seeds Instagram, you can see the tie stick that we got.
[24:39.910 --> 24:42.910]  Maybe it was longer than that, actually. Probably like 2013.
[24:43.910 --> 24:45.910]  In fact, it's in a safe somewhere.
[24:48.910 --> 24:50.910]  That tie stick is probably in my friend's safe.
[24:51.910 --> 24:54.910]  It's wrapped with red twine.
[24:55.910 --> 24:59.910]  It came in either white or red string wrapped around it.
[25:01.910 --> 25:06.140]  Here's a question about males.
[25:07.140 --> 25:09.140]  Males die off after the job is done.
[25:10.140 --> 25:13.140]  It seems like my male plant dies off so fast after he pops.
[25:14.140 --> 25:17.140]  Yeah, I think it depends on the variety.
[25:18.140 --> 25:20.140]  Some of them just keep on busting more pollen.
[25:20.140 --> 25:27.140]  Other males, just for again, they have one big shot and one big nut and it's done.
[25:28.140 --> 25:30.140]  They drop their load quickly.
[25:31.140 --> 25:33.140]  Yeah, and they drop a ton of pollen.
[25:34.140 --> 25:37.140]  Other ones, they drop. It really depends on the variety.
[25:38.140 --> 25:43.140]  Again, the other thing I was talking about and I've talked about previously is redundancies.
[25:44.140 --> 25:48.140]  If you're making seeds, especially if you're making set feminized seeds, have redundancies.
[25:48.140 --> 25:58.140]  Don't expect that your plants are going to flip, that it's a guaranteed thing because even someone like myself has had problems with it many years into it.
[25:59.140 --> 26:03.140]  Make pollen in advance. Take that pollen and use it as a redundancy.
[26:04.140 --> 26:05.140]  If you don't need it, you don't need it.
[26:06.140 --> 26:07.140]  If you do need it, it's great to have it.
[26:08.140 --> 26:11.140]  It's way better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
[26:12.140 --> 26:17.140]  I think a lot of people, then it's almost a waste if you're growing to try to do some sort of breeding
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.140]  and all these different varieties if you're trying to make seeds.
[26:21.140 --> 26:23.140]  Redundancies are always good.
[26:24.140 --> 26:29.140]  Live plants, dry plants, and pollen are the three ways you can preserve your stuff.
[26:30.140 --> 26:36.140]  Putting those dry plants in a pollen bag, not a pollen bag, but in a bag for using.
[26:37.140 --> 26:45.140]  My buddy Andrew, who we'll get on the show one of these days, he has this tech that's awesome that we were using to do pollination
[26:45.140 --> 26:52.140]  where you use the bags that you do teas that you brew your tea in.
[26:53.140 --> 26:59.140]  You take them, you put them in the tea bag for compost tea, and you actually shake the plants.
[27:00.140 --> 27:03.140]  It works really good. I'm constantly learning stuff from people and my friends.
[27:04.140 --> 27:05.140]  We like to share information.
[27:06.140 --> 27:08.140]  How long do you keep your pollen for?
[27:09.140 --> 27:10.140]  As long as you can.
[27:11.140 --> 27:12.140]  You lose viability.
[27:15.140 --> 27:21.140]  I think every day from the time it's live, you lose a little bit of viability over the period of six months.
[27:22.140 --> 27:23.140]  I've seen stuff work six months.
[27:24.140 --> 27:27.140]  I haven't seen much stuff after that I try to use it as quickly as possible.
[27:28.140 --> 27:31.140]  The fresher it is, the better it is, the better it flies.
[27:32.140 --> 27:37.140]  Also, keeping it super, super dry, keeping it in the freezer is great if you can keep it super dry.
[27:38.140 --> 27:39.140]  It lasts a lot longer that way.
[27:40.140 --> 27:48.140]  If you just have it out, you might get a month, six weeks, two months, just depending on the temperature fluctuations, and as long as it's super dry.
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.920]  Here is on the screen a revegging question for males.
[27:57.920 --> 27:59.920]  I have never revegged males.
[28:00.920 --> 28:03.920]  I like to start revegging. It works pretty well.
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.920]  Interesting.
[28:06.920 --> 28:07.920]  Interesting.
[28:08.920 --> 28:11.920]  Some males auto flower.
[28:12.920 --> 28:17.920]  I've had some male varieties that no matter what you do, you can give them 24 hours of light and they're going to want to flip.
[28:18.920 --> 28:19.920]  They're going to want to bust out pollen.
[28:20.920 --> 28:30.920]  It's great if you have a nursery and you don't have to worry about pollinating other plants, but if you're trying to keep them alive and right next door, it's difficult if you have plants that are in flower.
[28:34.710 --> 28:36.710]  What size micron screen for pollen collection?
[28:37.710 --> 28:45.710]  I would say a 300 micron would be perfect.
[28:46.710 --> 28:52.710]  If you're using bubble bags, you could use the work bag for working it like that.
[28:53.710 --> 28:55.710]  Make sure everything you're doing, you're really dry.
[28:56.710 --> 29:05.710]  I think that's the biggest thing for me that I've noticed is you're working with pollen, you want to make sure your plants are bone dry if you're trying to separate the pollen sacs.
[29:06.710 --> 29:10.710]  Or you can separate them out, completely dry them out, and then grind them up.
[29:11.710 --> 29:12.710]  I've seen people grind them up before.
[29:13.710 --> 29:14.710]  I've done all kinds of different stuff.
[29:15.710 --> 29:16.710]  Experimenting is the best way.
[29:17.710 --> 29:19.710]  Am I working with THCV cultivars?
[29:20.710 --> 29:24.710]  No, I was on that path about two years ago and I've really gone away from that.
[29:25.710 --> 29:30.710]  I think there's other people breeding awesome THCV varieties, CBG.
[29:31.710 --> 29:33.710]  I did some CBG stuff last year.
[29:33.710 --> 29:36.710]  Minor cannabinoid work, I think, is important.
[29:37.710 --> 29:43.710]  I'm really going for novel cannabinoid combinations and terpene profiles.
[29:44.710 --> 29:52.710]  Dry for at least 12 hours, then collect and throw with desiccant.
[29:53.710 --> 29:55.710]  Make sure it's completely dry.
[29:56.710 --> 29:57.710]  I think that's important.
[29:58.710 --> 29:59.710]  Yes, silver sprays.
[30:00.710 --> 30:02.710]  Don't spray your silver in the day if you're using it.
[30:03.710 --> 30:07.710]  Someone says, different with silver sprays, dark cycle as opposed to under lights.
[30:08.710 --> 30:13.710]  I would say that it's important to spray when the lights go dark.
[30:14.710 --> 30:19.710]  Then as far as not only when the lights go dark, you have to remember what kind of lights you're using.
[30:20.710 --> 30:22.710]  If you're under HPS, you're going to get better results than LEDs.
[30:22.710 --> 30:24.710]  For whatever reason, it has to do with the spectrum.
[30:25.710 --> 30:28.710]  For the reversals, super important.
[30:29.710 --> 30:33.710]  LEDs are just becoming popular, so we're just learning this stuff.
[30:37.710 --> 30:39.710]  Someone's ordering glue auto today.
[30:40.710 --> 30:41.710]  High five.
[30:42.710 --> 30:43.710]  That's great.
[30:44.710 --> 30:45.710]  Thank you.
[30:46.710 --> 30:48.710]  Anybody ever had a strain that smells like nail polish?
[30:48.710 --> 30:50.710]  Anybody ever had a strain that smells like nail polish?
[30:51.710 --> 30:52.710]  I strain when it's finishing.
[30:53.710 --> 30:54.710]  It's probably a chemical reaction.
[30:55.710 --> 30:56.710]  It's an interesting one.
[31:03.560 --> 31:07.560]  Have you ever pollinated a female with more than one male?
[31:08.560 --> 31:09.560]  Yes.
[31:10.560 --> 31:11.560]  Mystery machine.
[31:12.560 --> 31:13.560]  I'll tell you what.
[31:14.560 --> 31:15.560]  DNA, it's a funny story.
[31:16.560 --> 31:17.560]  I'll tell you about my experiences with that first.
[31:18.560 --> 31:20.560]  After I tell you about DNA, who's your daddy strain?
[31:20.560 --> 31:23.560]  That was their first strain where they put a whole bunch of males in with females.
[31:24.560 --> 31:29.560]  It was a big party with all these different varieties of pollen.
[31:30.560 --> 31:31.560]  They called it who's your daddy.
[31:32.560 --> 31:34.560]  That made a whole seed company.
[31:35.560 --> 31:38.560]  One of the biggest seed companies now was made off of a strain called who's your daddy.
[31:39.560 --> 31:41.560]  I've pollinated branches.
[31:42.560 --> 31:47.560]  What I really like to do, I did this with a couple people recently, at least in the last year,
[31:47.560 --> 31:52.560]  where I go in with pollen and I'll have several varieties of pollen, little paint brushes,
[31:53.560 --> 31:55.560]  and really small paint brushes.
[31:56.560 --> 32:00.560]  What I do is I'll go in and I'll tag a branch and then I'll go pollinate it with a type of pollen.
[32:01.560 --> 32:03.560]  I'll go tag another branch, pollinate it with a different type of pollen.
[32:04.560 --> 32:05.560]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[32:06.560 --> 32:07.560]  It works really good.
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.560]  We're talking about not for seed production but for phenohunting new varieties.
[32:12.560 --> 32:14.560]  If you're just going to make new varieties, it works great.
[32:14.560 --> 32:17.560]  Mystery machine.
[32:18.560 --> 32:19.560]  Mystery volunteer.
[32:20.560 --> 32:21.560]  I think you guys should grow it out.
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.560]  We've been giving them away as a freebie.
[32:24.560 --> 32:26.560]  Juicy fruit.
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.730]  If you like juicy fruit, there's some juicy fruit in there.
[32:32.730 --> 32:33.730]  Then mystery donor.
[32:34.730 --> 32:37.730]  Who's your mommy?
[32:38.730 --> 32:41.730]  That sounds like a new seed company waiting to happen right there.
[32:42.730 --> 32:43.730]  Do you see that?
[32:43.730 --> 32:49.730]  Does a person have a good chance to find a hell of a keeper with feminized seeds as with regulars?
[32:50.730 --> 32:52.730]  Just a little rundown on feminized lines if you can.
[32:53.730 --> 32:58.730]  Let me tell you the advantages of feminized breeding as opposed to regular breeding.
[32:59.730 --> 33:00.730]  It depends on the breeder.
[33:01.730 --> 33:04.730]  Really good breeders breed really good regular seeds.
[33:05.730 --> 33:09.730]  Amateur breeders breed really good regular seeds.
[33:10.730 --> 33:16.730]  Amateur breeders usually don't have the same success that really good breeders do.
[33:17.730 --> 33:19.730]  You have to understand how your males work.
[33:20.730 --> 33:22.730]  You have to understand the compatibility.
[33:23.730 --> 33:29.730]  Using a male that you know is successful is much different than a crapshoot which a lot of people do with regulars.
[33:30.730 --> 33:38.730]  Using feminized, you can take a variety that you know what it does, reverse it, and then you can breed it.
[33:39.730 --> 33:45.730]  You know as far as terpene profile, structure, all these things, what it's going to do.
[33:46.730 --> 33:53.730]  There's advantages there with feminized breeding where your donor that you're reversing, putting on the receiver, you can see what those things do.
[33:54.730 --> 34:04.730]  Whereas regular breeding, you have to understand by growing it out, by using it on multiple things to really understand what traits it's passing on.
[34:05.730 --> 34:08.730]  I think there's advantages to both.
[34:09.730 --> 34:10.730]  Know your breeder.
[34:11.730 --> 34:12.730]  Who you're buying seeds from.
[34:13.730 --> 34:14.730]  Do they make really good reg seeds?
[34:15.730 --> 34:16.730]  Do they make really good fem seeds?
[34:17.730 --> 34:18.730]  I think fem seeds are great.
[34:19.730 --> 34:20.730]  I think reg seeds are great.
[34:21.730 --> 34:22.730]  It just depends on what you're looking for.
[34:23.730 --> 34:29.730]  If you have intersexual traits like hermaphrodites, they can be passed on from both feminized lines and from regular lines.
[34:30.730 --> 34:33.730]  I think breeding regular is good too.
[34:34.730 --> 34:36.730]  Selling fems is also great.
[34:37.730 --> 34:52.730]  With the hairy pollen produced by colloidal silver, variety from light environment stress.
[34:53.730 --> 34:54.730]  No, I don't think that.
[34:55.730 --> 34:56.730]  It's not going to change the pollen if that's what you're asking.
[34:56.730 --> 35:00.730]  The viability of the pollen or make it hermaphrodite pollen.
[35:01.730 --> 35:03.730]  I think if you're stressing it out.
[35:04.730 --> 35:18.730]  The thing is, with these silvers, what they do is they're blocking ethylene.
[35:19.730 --> 35:24.730]  What you're doing to make reverse a plant is you're basically blocking ethylene.
[35:24.730 --> 35:25.730]  This isn't a stress response.
[35:26.730 --> 35:27.730]  This is blocking ethylene.
[35:28.730 --> 35:30.730]  STS does not stress to reverse.
[35:31.730 --> 35:32.730]  It blocks ethylene.
[35:33.730 --> 35:34.730]  This is correct.
[35:35.730 --> 35:37.730]  STS does damage the plant.
[35:38.730 --> 35:43.730]  Whereas some of these other silvers, I think, do not damage the plant as much.
[35:44.730 --> 35:47.730]  Let's see.
[35:47.730 --> 35:48.730]  Two good questions.
[35:49.730 --> 35:50.730]  No, I have not.
[35:51.730 --> 35:52.730]  Interesting questions, guys.
[35:53.730 --> 35:54.730]  Keep them rolling.
[35:55.730 --> 35:56.730]  What was the question you just read?
[35:57.730 --> 35:58.730]  It wasn't even a question.
[35:59.730 --> 36:01.730]  It was a comment that I thought was a question.
[36:02.730 --> 36:05.730]  I don't usually buy feminized seeds, but I'm going to.
[36:06.730 --> 36:07.730]  Let's see if we can get this one back here.
[36:08.730 --> 36:09.730]  Go ahead and order some glulat and try it.
[36:10.730 --> 36:12.730]  I've had Barneys farm seeds and they were okay.
[36:13.730 --> 36:15.730]  I always feel like my seeds are a little bit too big.
[36:15.730 --> 36:16.730]  I've had Barneys farm seeds and they were okay.
[36:17.730 --> 36:19.730]  I always feel like my reg seeds are stronger rooting and faster.
[36:20.730 --> 36:21.730]  I don't know about that.
[36:22.730 --> 36:26.730]  Try buying autos if you want to see some fast rooting, super strong,
[36:27.730 --> 36:28.730]  frigging vigorous growth.
[36:29.730 --> 36:33.730]  My feminized autos are just crazy.
[36:34.730 --> 36:39.730]  I guess there's some new spray that I've heard about that I haven't tried yet,
[36:40.730 --> 36:42.730]  but I've been reading about it and heard a lot about it.
[36:42.730 --> 36:43.730]  It's like a one and done.
[36:44.730 --> 36:45.730]  You spray the day you flip and that's it.
[36:46.730 --> 36:47.730]  I have yet to try it.
[36:48.730 --> 36:54.730]  Words on genetic chem, it's in node for tissue culture.
[36:55.730 --> 36:56.730]  It'll be out of tissue culture relatively soon.
[36:57.730 --> 36:58.730]  We're going to grow it out.
[36:59.730 --> 37:05.730]  Any word on anti-pollinating to avoid rogue pollen?
[37:06.730 --> 37:09.730]  I haven't had success with it.
[37:09.730 --> 37:10.730]  I haven't really used it as far as nets.
[37:11.730 --> 37:14.730]  Some people use pollen bags to capture the pollen,
[37:15.730 --> 37:18.730]  but as far as to prevent it, I'm not sure.
[37:19.730 --> 37:20.730]  That's not my expertise.
[37:21.730 --> 37:22.730]  Have I ever grown Dr. Grinspoon strain?
[37:23.730 --> 37:26.730]  No, but I did see it in a grow room in the Netherlands one time
[37:27.730 --> 37:29.730]  when I was getting a tour of this room.
[37:30.730 --> 37:31.730]  It was one of those 12-12 rooms.
[37:32.730 --> 37:33.730]  It's always 12-12 and they bring in plants.
[37:34.730 --> 37:36.730]  The plant was stapled to the wall.
[37:37.730 --> 37:39.730]  Dr. Grinspoon, if you don't know a lot about it,
[37:40.730 --> 37:44.730]  I believe it's a 16-20 week of flower.
[37:45.730 --> 37:49.730]  It grows the calyx stack in the really bad node spacing,
[37:50.730 --> 37:52.730]  but it's really, really strong, amazing flower.
[37:53.730 --> 37:59.730]  You get little calyx sacks in the bag, like bracts almost.
[38:00.730 --> 38:01.730]  The plant was stapled to the wall.
[38:02.730 --> 38:04.730]  It was probably an 8-10 foot long plant.
[38:04.730 --> 38:06.730]  It was just stapled to the wall where they had staples.
[38:07.730 --> 38:08.730]  Really interesting.
[38:09.730 --> 38:12.730]  Do I have a favorite breeder?
[38:13.730 --> 38:18.600]  Top three seed companies you like?
[38:19.600 --> 38:20.600]  I like so many different things.
[38:21.600 --> 38:26.600]  I don't even talk about it a lot, but I really like Karma's stuff.
[38:27.600 --> 38:28.600]  I think his work is good.
[38:29.600 --> 38:31.600]  He's really brought the gas into a lot of stuff.
[38:32.600 --> 38:33.600]  He was pushing gas varieties.
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.600]  He was pushing a lot of different things.
[38:35.600 --> 38:36.600]  He was pushing a lot of different stuff.
[38:37.600 --> 38:38.600]  He was pushing gas varieties.
[38:39.600 --> 38:41.600]  He brought gas to Europe in this sense and seed for him.
[38:42.600 --> 38:43.600]  I feel like he did a great thing.
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.600]  Probably Loud Scout, which is ...
[38:46.600 --> 38:47.600]  Yep, someone said probably Loud Scout.
[38:48.600 --> 38:50.600]  That must be related to another question about something.
[38:51.600 --> 38:54.600]  As far as other breeders, man, there's a bunch of good breeders out there.
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.600]  I talk about Swamp Boys, J-Beezy, Aficionado.
[39:02.600 --> 39:03.600]  We've had a ton of different guys on the show.
[39:03.600 --> 39:04.600]  I like a lot of the compound work.
[39:05.600 --> 39:08.600]  I'm a big fan of the apples and bananas guys, which I've been talking about,
[39:09.600 --> 39:10.600]  which we'll talk about next week.
[39:11.600 --> 39:12.600]  It's got some crazy terps on it.
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.600]  Every once in a while, you get that variety that reminds you
[39:19.600 --> 39:21.600]  why you've been doing this for so many years
[39:22.600 --> 39:23.600]  and what you love about cannabis.
[39:24.600 --> 39:25.600]  The apples and bananas really brought that back.
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.600]  For me, the smoke.
[39:29.600 --> 39:30.600]  The smoke is just ...
[39:31.600 --> 39:32.600]  It's got the terps.
[39:33.600 --> 39:34.600]  It's got the terps, and it's got the high too along with it,
[39:35.600 --> 39:38.600]  where you feel like you can just keep smoking it and smoking it and smoking it.
[39:39.600 --> 39:40.600]  It tastes good.
[39:41.600 --> 39:42.600]  It's one of those things you fire the roach up two days later,
[39:43.600 --> 39:44.600]  and it's not even a roach.
[39:45.600 --> 39:48.600]  It's just a small joint about that big with a black tip on the end,
[39:49.600 --> 39:50.600]  and it still tastes good.
[39:51.600 --> 39:54.600]  Yeah, exotic genetics, equilibrium genetics.
[39:55.600 --> 39:57.600]  There's tons of good varieties of stuff out there, guys.
[39:57.600 --> 39:58.600]  Let's see.
[39:59.600 --> 40:00.600]  What about landrace, heirloom genetics?
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.600]  I need recommendations for skunky varieties.
[40:04.600 --> 40:05.600]  Katsu Bubba.
[40:06.600 --> 40:08.600]  People really like the Bubba.
[40:09.600 --> 40:12.600]  I wonder what Loud knows about the potato roots.
[40:13.600 --> 40:14.600]  I think they're from compound.
[40:15.600 --> 40:16.600]  We can ask next week.
[40:17.600 --> 40:18.600]  If you guys have questions,
[40:19.600 --> 40:20.600]  you can either hit me up with the DM on Instagram,
[40:21.600 --> 40:22.600]  or you can send them to my email address,
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.600]  which is jamesloudgenetics.com.
[40:24.600 --> 40:25.600]  Have you had any success cloning autoflowers?
[40:26.600 --> 40:27.600]  No, nobody has had success cloning autoflowers.
[40:28.600 --> 40:29.600]  They do not clone.
[40:30.600 --> 40:32.600]  We've been working on some TC with autoflowers.
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.600]  That's hopefully going to be something that we'll figure out soon.
[40:37.600 --> 40:40.600]  Man, craziest plant mutation I've had.
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.600]  I've had all kinds of weird splits on stuff as far as mutations.
[40:46.600 --> 40:47.600]  Wait, I'm going to go back to the next slide.
[40:48.600 --> 40:49.600]  I'm going to go back to the next slide.
[40:50.600 --> 40:51.600]  I'm going to go back to the next slide.
[40:52.600 --> 40:53.600]  With autos and with breeding autos,
[40:54.600 --> 40:56.600]  you go through these mutations that you've got to cull
[40:57.600 --> 40:58.600]  and you've got to pull out of there.
[40:59.600 --> 41:00.600]  I've seen some really weird stuff.
[41:01.600 --> 41:03.600]  Siamese seeds.
[41:04.600 --> 41:05.600]  If you guys have ever seen Siamese seeds,
[41:06.600 --> 41:07.600]  usually they don't germinate.
[41:08.600 --> 41:11.600]  We had one a long time ago that did,
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.600]  at least one side of it.
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.600]  It's a crazy mutation where the plant only wanted to grow sideways.
[41:18.600 --> 41:20.600]  It would not grow vertical, the plant.
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.600]  We left it to see what it did for a little while.
[41:24.600 --> 41:26.600]  It was a weird growing plant.
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.600]  TC autos seem crazier than cloning them.
[41:31.600 --> 41:33.600]  That's why we got TC guys to do that and work on it.
[41:34.600 --> 41:37.600]  I think with tissue culture and hormones,
[41:38.600 --> 41:41.600]  you can figure out what hormones to use and to preserve it,
[41:42.600 --> 41:45.600]  to slow the growth down, to be able to replicate it.
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.600]  I would say all the big guys that are doing autoflower,
[41:49.600 --> 41:52.600]  it's something that we're all working on.
[41:53.600 --> 41:54.600]  Not just any one of us,
[41:55.600 --> 41:57.600]  but everybody wants to be able to use TC for autoflowers.
[41:58.600 --> 41:59.600]  Once you figure that out,
[42:00.600 --> 42:01.600]  then you can breed stable lines with it.
[42:02.600 --> 42:05.600]  Until then, it's a lot harder to breed stable lines.
[42:06.600 --> 42:07.600]  Someone said-
[42:08.600 --> 42:09.600]  That question.
[42:10.600 --> 42:16.820]  Should I be looking for something to do with that?
[42:16.820 --> 42:17.820]  That's a good question.
[42:18.820 --> 42:21.820]  Should I be looking for some specific traits in a juice box pheno hunt?
[42:22.820 --> 42:23.820]  Yes, you should.
[42:24.820 --> 42:25.820]  You should be looking.
[42:26.820 --> 42:27.820]  I would say turps.
[42:28.820 --> 42:29.820]  I think the structure on all of them is relatively good.
[42:30.820 --> 42:31.820]  All of the varieties we've popped and gone through
[42:32.820 --> 42:33.820]  and the stuff I've seen.
[42:34.820 --> 42:37.820]  If you want some of the stuff that leads towards that real-
[42:38.820 --> 42:40.820]  I like the sweet side of it.
[42:41.820 --> 42:44.820]  The Z-turps, the runcy Z-turps.
[42:45.820 --> 42:46.820]  It's all about-
[42:47.820 --> 42:48.820]  I think with that,
[42:49.820 --> 42:51.820]  at the point where you're looking for the turps as far as the structure,
[42:52.820 --> 42:53.820]  go for the structure you like.
[42:54.820 --> 42:55.820]  If you're looking for the outliers,
[42:56.820 --> 42:58.820]  look for those real strong Z-turps for the Skittles.
[42:59.820 --> 43:01.820]  It's like Skittles and gas.
[43:02.820 --> 43:03.820]  Skittles has a terrible structure.
[43:04.820 --> 43:08.820]  It's nice with some of these varieties like Runts
[43:09.820 --> 43:11.820]  and all these other ones that have those Z-turps in them
[43:12.820 --> 43:13.820]  where they really pop.
[43:14.820 --> 43:15.820]  Nose-burning almost.
[43:16.820 --> 43:18.820]  I want to make Nano Silver.
[43:19.820 --> 43:20.820]  Everybody wants to make Nano Silver.
[43:21.820 --> 43:22.820]  Get that episode out.
[43:23.820 --> 43:24.820]  Email me.
[43:25.820 --> 43:26.820]  You want to make Nano Silver? Email me.
[43:27.820 --> 43:28.820]  I'll ask again.
[43:29.820 --> 43:32.820]  Anybody develop a stable Afghani autoflower available in regular seed?
[43:33.820 --> 43:34.820]  Not that I know of.
[43:35.820 --> 43:40.280]  People say I want a Bubba Kush monocrop.
[43:41.280 --> 43:42.280]  No.
[43:43.280 --> 43:44.280]  No.
[43:44.280 --> 43:45.280]  Z-turp is Skittles.
[43:46.280 --> 43:47.280]  Yes, Z-turps.
[43:48.280 --> 43:49.280]  That's what we call them now.
[43:50.280 --> 43:51.280]  Z-turps is from the Skittles.
[43:52.280 --> 43:53.280]  It's in a lot of stuff.
[43:54.280 --> 43:55.280]  Skittles has a bad structure.
[43:56.280 --> 43:57.280]  It was something that needed work.
[43:58.280 --> 44:01.280]  You have to give it up for the guys that brought Skittles to the market.
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.280]  Shiloh and Brandon crushing it with that one.
[44:06.280 --> 44:12.280]  It's something that has impacted the industry as heavily as Gelato.
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.280]  Maybe it doesn't get as much credit, but it's had the impact of Gelato.
[44:18.280 --> 44:21.280]  I would have never thought Gelato would have the impact that it did when it came out.
[44:22.280 --> 44:24.280]  It changed the color of the weed that we smoke.
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.280]  Literally, now everybody has to have purple for it to be considered exotic.
[44:31.280 --> 44:34.880]  Look up.
[44:35.880 --> 44:36.880]  Turp Hogs.
[44:37.880 --> 44:38.880]  He made Skittle W.
[44:39.880 --> 44:40.880]  I don't know what Skittle W is.
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.880]  Either way, GMO, no thank you.
[44:46.880 --> 44:47.880]  I like GSC.
[44:48.880 --> 44:52.880]  It's funny because we talk about these things and I would have to say that cannabis is so subjective.
[44:53.880 --> 44:56.880]  What I like and what you like may be two different things.
[44:57.880 --> 44:58.880]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[44:59.880 --> 45:00.880]  Food is the same way.
[45:01.880 --> 45:03.880]  Some people only eat pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs.
[45:04.880 --> 45:07.880]  Other people like sushi and amazing different things.
[45:07.880 --> 45:10.880]  There's nothing wrong with any of those things, but it's all personal preference.
[45:11.880 --> 45:12.880]  That's the beauty of it.
[45:13.880 --> 45:21.880]  With cannabis, we have this opportunity to be able to try so many different things that have not only different effects or even no effects,
[45:22.880 --> 45:25.880]  but also these different terpene profiles that are profound in a lot of ways.
[45:26.880 --> 45:28.880]  What's the word on 808 Genetics?
[45:29.880 --> 45:30.880]  Just got some gear from them?
[45:31.880 --> 45:32.880]  Don't know.
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.880]  Purples are far from exotics.
[45:35.880 --> 45:36.880]  Purples are far from exotics.
[45:37.880 --> 45:40.880]  We have some community educating to do.
[45:41.880 --> 45:43.880]  I think that's another opinion.
[45:44.880 --> 45:46.880]  Right now, purples are the exotics.
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.880]  Whether you believe they are the exotics or not, it doesn't matter.
[45:50.880 --> 45:51.880]  It's what the market says.
[45:52.880 --> 45:54.880]  We go back to the what is cannabis worth?
[45:55.880 --> 45:59.880]  It's worth whatever people will pay for it, just like anything else.
[46:00.880 --> 46:02.880]  You can't say that it's not.
[46:02.880 --> 46:04.880]  If somebody was willing to pay for it, it's worth that.
[46:05.880 --> 46:06.880]  Same thing with seeds.
[46:07.880 --> 46:08.880]  If somebody's willing to pay for it, it's worth that.
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.880]  I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but that's what it is.
[46:12.880 --> 46:13.880]  All this stuff is so subjective.
[46:14.880 --> 46:17.880]  Granddaddy Purple is back.
[46:18.880 --> 46:21.880]  I wouldn't say Granddaddy Purple is back, but Purple is definitely back.
[46:22.880 --> 46:24.880]  Purp is straight Zaza.
[46:25.880 --> 46:27.880]  Any blue strains?
[46:27.880 --> 46:30.880]  Blue strains for me, I think there's some.
[46:31.880 --> 46:34.880]  If we're talking about blueberry crosses into strains,
[46:35.880 --> 46:36.880]  I think there's some really good ones.
[46:37.880 --> 46:39.880]  Some of the blue cookies, some of this stuff is really cool.
[46:40.880 --> 46:44.880]  RS11, if you guys have a chance to get that to smoke on,
[46:45.880 --> 46:46.880]  absolutely amazing.
[46:47.880 --> 46:51.880]  Although I heard the drop in the latest job wasn't super amazing,
[46:52.880 --> 46:54.880]  but the previous stuff that I had seen before, absolutely amazing.
[46:54.880 --> 46:55.880]  Cookie strain, hi James.
[46:56.880 --> 46:59.880]  Is it easier to breed recessive traits through FEMs?
[47:00.880 --> 47:03.880]  I wouldn't say that it's easier to breed recessive traits through FEMs,
[47:04.880 --> 47:07.880]  but if you're looking, let's talk about the gas in OG Kush.
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.880]  That OG Kush Terp profile, it was really, I think,
[47:13.880 --> 47:14.880]  getting it in seed form.
[47:15.880 --> 47:17.880]  They had seeds of OG Kush forever in Amsterdam,
[47:18.880 --> 47:20.880]  but they didn't have good OG Kush Terps.
[47:20.880 --> 47:21.880]  They almost bred it out for structure.
[47:22.880 --> 47:24.880]  The thing is, recessive traits are recessive traits.
[47:25.880 --> 47:26.880]  They're hard to find.
[47:27.880 --> 47:30.880]  Getting recessive traits with both the parents and getting them to express
[47:31.880 --> 47:34.880]  is difficult to do, whether you're doing it with regular.
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.880]  I think identifying them is easier with a feminized breeding for sure.
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.880]  I mean, that's just RS11.
[47:44.880 --> 47:45.880]  Is that what he said?
[47:46.880 --> 47:47.880]  Yes.
[47:47.880 --> 47:49.880]  That's Rainbow Sherbert number from DO Farms.
[47:50.880 --> 47:51.880]  Big ups to DO Farms for that.
[47:52.880 --> 47:53.880]  That's a good one.
[47:54.880 --> 47:55.880]  Let's see.
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.170]  Someone says pass on the terpenoline.
[48:02.170 --> 48:03.170]  There's nothing wrong with terpenoline.
[48:04.170 --> 48:11.170]  I feel like terpenoline is just one of the most passed along Terps.
[48:12.170 --> 48:13.170]  If you have it in there or if you,
[48:14.170 --> 48:16.170]  the recombination of genetics is not a problem.
[48:16.170 --> 48:18.170]  Terpenoline, limonene, haze, jack Terp,
[48:19.170 --> 48:21.170]  that you guys are familiar with, is very dominant.
[48:22.170 --> 48:23.170]  It overpowers other stuff.
[48:24.170 --> 48:27.170]  It'll pop up generations later when you're not even expecting it.
[48:28.170 --> 48:29.170]  Candy desserts.
[48:30.170 --> 48:31.170]  Someone just said candy desserts.
[48:32.170 --> 48:35.170]  Candy desserts, it's interesting because I feel like that was where we were at
[48:36.170 --> 48:38.170]  and we are going to move in a different direction.
[48:39.170 --> 48:41.170]  Now, I think it's just going to get more complicated.
[48:42.170 --> 48:43.170]  I think it's going to get more complicated.
[48:43.170 --> 48:44.170]  There's nothing wrong with the candy Terps.
[48:45.170 --> 48:46.170]  Candy Terps are great.
[48:47.170 --> 48:49.170]  This industry doesn't stay in the same place for very long.
[48:50.170 --> 48:51.170]  It's like what's popular today,
[48:52.170 --> 48:54.170]  three months from now is not going to be popular.
[48:55.170 --> 48:56.170]  Not even that it's not going to be popular.
[48:57.170 --> 48:58.170]  It won't be as popular.
[48:59.170 --> 49:00.170]  We'll have something new as the latest and greatest.
[49:01.170 --> 49:05.170]  I still see the purpose is going to be purple.
[49:06.170 --> 49:07.170]  It's going to have a little bit of purple.
[49:08.170 --> 49:09.170]  It's going to be complex.
[49:10.170 --> 49:11.170]  It's going to be a little bit of purple.
[49:11.170 --> 49:12.170]  It's going to be complex.
[49:13.170 --> 49:17.170]  Candied garlic, that's going to be popular for sure.
[49:18.170 --> 49:22.170]  I have some GMO runs right here.
[49:23.170 --> 49:26.170]  This is from somebody else.
[49:27.170 --> 49:28.170]  This is some really good stuff.
[49:29.170 --> 49:30.170]  I got this from a guy in San Diego.
[49:31.170 --> 49:36.170]  It's got some nice GMO underlying Terps,
[49:37.170 --> 49:39.170]  but it's not super strong with that Chem D
[49:39.170 --> 49:40.170]  that I love.
[49:41.170 --> 49:44.170]  It's more mild with the GMO.
[49:45.170 --> 49:49.170]  GMO is Girl Scout Cookies times Chem D.
[49:50.170 --> 49:52.170]  It gets that real funk.
[49:53.170 --> 49:55.170]  This variety right here, this GMO runs,
[49:56.170 --> 49:57.170]  and I'm not sure who bred it,
[49:58.170 --> 50:00.170]  but we have the GMO runs coming out with Loud Canagenics.
[50:01.170 --> 50:03.170]  It's actually GMO Gelato 41.
[50:04.170 --> 50:05.170]  It's called a Fendo.
[50:06.170 --> 50:08.170]  Kyle, it's a good one.
[50:09.170 --> 50:11.170]  Super excited about those Fendos.
[50:12.170 --> 50:15.170]  Flavor speaks louder than looks.
[50:16.170 --> 50:17.170]  Actions speak louder than words.
[50:18.170 --> 50:19.170]  Yeah.
[50:20.170 --> 50:21.170]  This is true.
[50:22.170 --> 50:23.170]  I think there's a lot of talk going on.
[50:24.170 --> 50:25.170]  It's like proof is in the pudding.
[50:26.170 --> 50:27.170]  I tend to say that.
[50:28.170 --> 50:29.170]  I've said it a million times with cat piss.
[50:30.170 --> 50:31.170]  Show me the cat piss.
[50:32.170 --> 50:33.170]  I'm waiting for it.
[50:34.170 --> 50:35.170]  Check out the screen.
[50:36.170 --> 50:38.170]  Okay, dude, that Ganja Farm Raccoon is beasting.
[50:39.170 --> 50:40.170]  Go ahead, Flour.
[50:41.170 --> 50:42.170]  28 days from spout.
[50:43.170 --> 50:44.170]  Day 41 today.
[50:45.170 --> 50:46.170]  Awesome.
[50:47.170 --> 50:48.170]  Can't wait for that.
[50:49.170 --> 50:50.170]  Yeah, so the Fendo,
[50:51.170 --> 50:52.170]  you guys will see a Fendo on April 1st.
[50:53.170 --> 50:54.170]  It's been a little bit of a delay,
[50:55.170 --> 50:56.170]  but a Fendo will be hitting on the end of this month,
[50:57.170 --> 50:58.170]  first part of the next month.
[50:59.170 --> 51:00.170]  Everything is not gas,
[51:01.170 --> 51:03.170]  and I only want purple if it has purple flavor.
[51:04.170 --> 51:06.170]  It's a tough one.
[51:07.170 --> 51:08.170]  It's a tough one.
[51:09.170 --> 51:10.170]  Purple flavor.
[51:11.170 --> 51:12.170]  What is purple flavor?
[51:13.170 --> 51:14.170]  Purple is a color.
[51:15.170 --> 51:16.170]  Lavender is purple flavor.
[51:17.170 --> 51:18.170]  Floral is a purple flavor.
[51:19.170 --> 51:20.170]  I don't know.
[51:21.170 --> 51:22.170]  That's a tough one.
[51:23.170 --> 51:24.170]  Grape.
[51:25.170 --> 51:26.170]  There's all these different things.
[51:27.170 --> 51:28.170]  Describing colors as flavors,
[51:29.170 --> 51:30.170]  I'm not really big into that.
[51:31.170 --> 51:32.170]  I think color is one thing.
[51:33.170 --> 51:34.170]  Flavor is another thing.
[51:35.170 --> 51:36.170]  You want stuff that leans towards those purple flavors?
[51:37.170 --> 51:38.170]  Sure.
[51:39.170 --> 51:40.170]  Taste amazing?
[51:41.170 --> 51:42.170]  I'm not super concerned about the color,
[51:43.170 --> 51:44.170]  personally,
[51:45.170 --> 51:46.170]  but that doesn't mean that the market isn't.
[51:47.170 --> 51:48.170]  The market definitely is.
[51:49.170 --> 51:51.170]  Here is a Light Leak question.
[51:52.170 --> 51:53.170]  My plan?
[51:54.170 --> 51:56.170]  Will the seeds created show intersexual traits
[51:57.170 --> 51:58.170]  if I eliminate the Light Leak?
[51:59.170 --> 52:00.170]  You know,
[52:01.170 --> 52:02.170]  you're going to need to test them
[52:03.170 --> 52:06.170]  because we've had stuff that has been okay
[52:06.170 --> 52:08.170]  that I said was definitely going to harm,
[52:09.170 --> 52:10.170]  that was definitely fucked,
[52:11.170 --> 52:12.170]  and I was all pissed off.
[52:13.170 --> 52:14.170]  Then,
[52:15.170 --> 52:16.170]  even my buddy Midnight Rider
[52:17.170 --> 52:19.170]  had made some of these amazing varieties,
[52:20.170 --> 52:22.170]  and I found out they were from Light Leak.
[52:23.170 --> 52:25.170]  You just really never know.
[52:26.170 --> 52:27.170]  It depends.
[52:28.170 --> 52:29.170]  Everything just needs to be tested.
[52:30.170 --> 52:31.170]  I wouldn't go sell those seeds right away.
[52:32.170 --> 52:33.170]  I would go test them out.
[52:34.170 --> 52:35.170]  I think you should test everything out,
[52:36.170 --> 52:38.170]  but just because the Light Leak created seeds
[52:39.170 --> 52:40.170]  doesn't mean they're bad,
[52:41.170 --> 52:42.170]  but more than likely you have stuff
[52:43.170 --> 52:45.170]  that you're breeding in plants
[52:46.170 --> 52:47.170]  that are susceptible to stress.
[52:48.170 --> 52:49.170]  So breeding that in,
[52:50.170 --> 52:51.170]  I don't think that's necessarily a great thing.
[52:52.170 --> 52:54.170]  So just because the first time you do it,
[52:55.170 --> 52:56.170]  if you're not stressing your plants out,
[52:57.170 --> 52:58.170]  which is another reason you do stress testing
[52:59.170 --> 53:01.170]  to get those intersexual traits to express
[53:02.170 --> 53:03.170]  because in a perfect environment,
[53:04.170 --> 53:05.170]  you might just be fine.
[53:06.170 --> 53:07.170]  But then you go and pop it out
[53:08.170 --> 53:09.170]  and pop some seeds,
[53:10.170 --> 53:11.170]  and then it gets stressed out,
[53:12.170 --> 53:13.170]  and all of a sudden you've got herms,
[53:14.170 --> 53:15.170]  and you've given the seeds out to people.
[53:16.170 --> 53:17.170]  They're all pissed off.
[53:18.170 --> 53:19.170]  That's not a good thing.
[53:20.170 --> 53:21.170]  So stress test your varieties.
[53:22.170 --> 53:23.170]  Purple equals grape berry flavor.
[53:24.170 --> 53:25.170]  It can for sure.
[53:26.170 --> 53:27.170]  Berry, floral,
[53:28.170 --> 53:29.170]  all those things you can think of
[53:30.170 --> 53:31.170]  if we're talking about grape,
[53:32.170 --> 53:33.170]  if we're talking about purple.
[53:34.170 --> 53:35.170]  My big thing is does it taste good?
[53:36.170 --> 53:37.170]  It should taste good.
[53:38.170 --> 53:39.170]  Weed should taste good.
[53:40.170 --> 53:41.170]  That's a dude that was on the show,
[53:42.170 --> 53:43.170]  his seed company.
[53:44.170 --> 53:45.170]  Good stuff.
[53:46.170 --> 53:47.170]  Miles gets it.
[53:48.170 --> 53:49.170]  Weed should taste good.
[53:50.170 --> 53:51.170]  At the end of the day,
[53:52.170 --> 53:53.170]  the color's cool.
[53:54.170 --> 53:55.170]  I think that's great,
[53:56.170 --> 53:57.170]  but it really needs to taste good.
[53:58.170 --> 53:59.170]  I feel like there's an effect
[54:00.170 --> 54:03.080]  that happens along with the taste,
[54:04.080 --> 54:05.080]  and I'm big on that.
[54:06.080 --> 54:07.080]  For me, it's all about that flavor.
[54:08.080 --> 54:09.080]  It's not already.
[54:15.960 --> 54:17.960]  Anthocyanins are flavonoids.
[54:18.960 --> 54:19.960]  Yes.
[54:20.960 --> 54:21.960]  I think that GDP,
[54:22.960 --> 54:23.960]  that GDP lavender floral,
[54:24.960 --> 54:25.960]  I think that's amazing.
[54:26.960 --> 54:27.960]  Do we want to just bottleneck
[54:28.960 --> 54:29.960]  everything into that?
[54:30.960 --> 54:31.960]  No.
[54:32.960 --> 54:33.960]  Variety is the spice of life.
[54:34.960 --> 54:35.960]  The more stuff that we have
[54:36.960 --> 54:37.960]  that's amazing.
[54:38.960 --> 54:39.960]  I have a ton of different stuff
[54:40.960 --> 54:41.960]  that I'm smoking on right now,
[54:41.960 --> 54:42.960]  and I'm smoking on
[54:43.960 --> 54:44.960]  some juice box.
[54:45.960 --> 54:46.960]  This is just amazing.
[54:47.960 --> 54:49.960]  Juice box is
[54:50.960 --> 54:51.960]  over there, and it's floral.
[54:52.960 --> 54:53.960]  We got some cereal milk here.
[54:57.940 --> 54:58.940]  I basically pinch buds
[54:59.940 --> 55:00.940]  out of all my friends' sacks
[55:01.940 --> 55:02.940]  and put them in these bags.
[55:03.940 --> 55:04.940]  I got some haze right here.
[55:05.940 --> 55:06.940]  It's good.
[55:07.940 --> 55:08.940]  It's got that tropanoline limonene.
[55:09.940 --> 55:10.940]  It's great for road trips
[55:11.940 --> 55:12.940]  if you want to stay awake on the road.
[55:13.940 --> 55:14.940]  I've got some buds that are purple
[55:15.940 --> 55:16.940]  on the light-facing side.
[55:17.940 --> 55:18.940]  Let's see if I can go back to that.
[55:19.940 --> 55:20.940]  It's on the screen.
[55:21.940 --> 55:22.940]  Green on the dark side.
[55:23.940 --> 55:24.940]  I've had this.
[55:27.940 --> 55:28.940]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[55:29.940 --> 55:30.940]  That's just an expression
[55:31.940 --> 55:32.940]  of the plant.
[55:33.940 --> 55:34.940]  It could be from cold air
[55:35.940 --> 55:36.940]  getting blown in.
[55:37.940 --> 55:38.940]  Cold temps will affect your colors
[55:39.940 --> 55:40.940]  for sure.
[55:41.940 --> 55:42.940]  You can make your color darker
[55:43.940 --> 55:44.940]  when you're trying to get
[55:45.940 --> 55:46.940]  your GDP extra.
[55:47.940 --> 55:48.940]  We used to put ice on the top
[55:49.940 --> 55:50.940]  of the substrate back in the day
[55:51.940 --> 55:52.940]  when we were finishing to try
[55:53.940 --> 55:54.940]  to get that color.
[55:55.940 --> 55:56.940]  Let's see.
[55:58.940 --> 55:59.940]  It could be a light-spectrum
[56:00.940 --> 56:01.940]  difference.
[56:02.940 --> 56:03.940]  Jagger.
[56:04.940 --> 56:05.940]  I was just in Oregon.
[56:06.940 --> 56:07.940]  Jagger is a super popular strain
[56:08.940 --> 56:09.940]  that nobody in California has ever
[56:10.940 --> 56:11.940]  heard of.
[56:11.940 --> 56:12.940]  Interesting outdoor from Oregon.
[56:14.940 --> 56:15.940]  Sour apple is a good one.
[56:16.940 --> 56:17.940]  Runts muffin.
[56:18.940 --> 56:19.940]  Nope.
[56:20.940 --> 56:21.940]  Good stuff.
[56:22.940 --> 56:25.600]  Let's see.
[56:28.600 --> 56:29.600]  You see that one on the screen?
[56:30.600 --> 56:31.600]  What's the weirdest terp profile
[56:32.600 --> 56:33.600]  anyone has had?
[56:34.600 --> 56:35.600]  Weirdest terp profile?
[56:36.600 --> 56:37.600]  Vomit.
[56:37.600 --> 56:38.600]  I think the vomit is right up there
[56:39.600 --> 56:40.600]  with the weirdest kind of funky.
[56:41.600 --> 56:42.600]  I got some stuff in the Netherlands
[56:43.600 --> 56:44.600]  that's called curry terps.
[56:45.600 --> 56:46.600]  Every once in a while you get
[56:47.600 --> 56:48.600]  kind of, I think curry terps
[56:49.600 --> 56:50.600]  are pretty cool and different
[56:51.600 --> 56:52.600]  and unique.
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.600]  Yeah.
[56:55.600 --> 56:56.600]  I always thought cheese terps
[56:57.600 --> 56:58.600]  were weird.
[56:58.600 --> 56:59.600]  I like cheese.
[57:00.600 --> 57:01.600]  I think it smokes really well.
[57:02.600 --> 57:03.600]  I think it's got a really blue
[57:04.600 --> 57:05.600]  cheese and cheese.
[57:06.600 --> 57:07.600]  Those are interesting.
[57:08.600 --> 57:09.600]  Super skunk that smelled like
[57:10.600 --> 57:11.600]  puke when she thirsty,
[57:11.600 --> 57:12.600]  and a delight when plump.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  Hot dog terps.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Nobody wants hot dog terps
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  in their weed.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  If you do, that's weird.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  Hold the vomit, please.
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  How do I pair red wine with
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.000]  let's see, let's go back to that.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  Red wine with bright flavors.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  Next time
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  Breeder Steve asks
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.000]  what to eat with his reds,
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  I'll give him James Proffitt.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  Nice.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  Red wine with bright flavors.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  I think if you're talking about
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  something as far as we want
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  to pair some red wine,
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  let's go with a pinot noir
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  with some fish, go with more.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  You want something subtle that's
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  not going to be overpowering.
[57:56.000 --> 57:57.000]  I think some people like
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  red wine, some people like white
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  wine. If you're trying to pair,
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  you can look at pinots
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  with fish. If you're going with
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  meat, you're going to want to go
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  something more substantial.
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.000]  White Bordeaux's,
[58:11.000 --> 58:12.000]  cabs, Bordeaux blends.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  We're talking about wines like
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  that. I don't know how we got
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  to talk about wine, but I love
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  wine as well.
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  I don't know if you guys follow
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.000]  my page, but also white Bordeaux's.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.000]  If you're big into fish,
[58:23.000 --> 58:24.000]  my favorite thing to pair
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  with fish is actually a white
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.000]  Bordeaux from the Left Bank.
[58:30.000 --> 58:31.000]  Go for one of those.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  And let's see.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  Here's just a quick
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  jellybeans and TK
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  or feminized photo period.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  That is correct.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  Now, yes, they are.
[58:47.000 --> 58:48.000]  Yes, they are.
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  A pound of Jaeger.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  Where do I take out my
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  business?
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  Bordeaux and cabs.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  You know, I like old vines in
[58:57.000 --> 58:58.000]  too. You know, you can get some
[58:58.000 --> 58:59.000]  old vines in from
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  the eastern part of California
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.000]  that are absolutely jamming and
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.000]  amazing.
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.000]  You know, just as amazing as,
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.000]  you know, some of these
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  freaking Bordeaux's for you.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  I love Bordeaux's.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  I love a certain Napa.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.000]  We just had some Screaming Eagle
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  the other day.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  It was really good.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  You know, I love Reds.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  I love whites.
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.000]  I love sake.
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.000]  I love everything in moderation.
[59:21.000 --> 59:22.000]  I think that's the big thing to
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  remember is like not too much,
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  but, you know, enough to where
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  you enjoy it, but not too much to
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  where it
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  takes over.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  One of my favorite things to do
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.000]  with wine is to have a
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  big beer.
[59:36.000 --> 59:37.000]  I'm trying to figure out where
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.000]  I can find my
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  favorite wine.
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.000]  I'm trying to figure out where
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  can I find your genetics?
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  Daga dot love.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  Seeds here now dot com.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  Follow me on Instagram.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  So, yeah, well, I guess that's
[59:51.000 --> 59:52.000]  the show today, guys, unless you
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  got any really
[59:54.000 --> 59:55.000]  dying questions that you
[59:56.000 --> 59:57.000]  get.
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.000]  Really appreciate you guys for
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  tuning in and keeping up with me.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  Let's do one giveaway for a shirt
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.520]  You come up with the questions for the shirt.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.680]  Make it technically difficult.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.200]  Oh God, my head's mush right now.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.560]  How many children does Peter have or is he about to have?
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.000]  That's a good one.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.240]  We're giving away a shirt for that.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.200]  You gotta really know Peter.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.920]  By the end of the year, it will be how many?
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.520]  Oh, I see James City.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.400]  Looks like the first one,
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.620]  but let me consult the YouTube live chat.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.120]  Yes, I'm on the,
[01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.590]  I believe that was the first one.
[01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:03.630]  And now there are a lot.
[01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.230]  Oh wait, now we had, yes, City.
[01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.750]  Yeah, I'm on the Justin Calvino track,
[01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.150]  if anyone gets that joke.
[01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.030]  The eight kids.
[01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:16.870]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.670]  So yeah, we got-
[01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:21.830]  So that's for the T-shirt, right?
[01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:25.550]  So yeah, shoot me an email with your shirt size
[01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.510]  and we'll get that out.
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:31.470]  But that was impressive for our guest
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:33.790]  not being available today.
[01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.190]  We held it together.
[01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.150]  Yeah, good stuff.
[01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:40.070]  And then we got one last question.
[01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:40.950]  We'll end it on that.
[01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.550]  Sour Diesel or Cat Piss?
[01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:45.350]  And I have to say, I absolutely love both of them.
[01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.750]  Sour Diesel is one of my favorites,
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:50.550]  but Cat Piss has been eluding me for 20 years,
[01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:52.190]  so I really miss Cat Piss.
[01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:56.150]  So yeah, look forward to talking to you guys again soon.
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.490]  Tune in next week.
[01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:59.990]  You know, you guys have a great week
[01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.630]  and I hope you guys stay blessed.
[01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:04.710]  All right, have a good one.
[01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.550]  Bye.
