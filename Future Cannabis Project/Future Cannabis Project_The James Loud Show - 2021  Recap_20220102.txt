[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  anywhere at all or you're just me?
[00:02.800 --> 00:04.320]  Yeah, I'm just hanging out the house
[00:04.760 --> 00:05.760]  hiding from COVID.
[00:09.520 --> 00:10.520]  You're dodging.
[00:10.920 --> 00:12.480]  Yeah, I mean, all my friends have
[00:12.480 --> 00:13.200]  COVID.
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.320]  Yeah, no, everyone.
[00:14.840 --> 00:15.600]  It's crazy.
[00:15.600 --> 00:17.120]  And I'm flying back to L.A.
[00:17.120 --> 00:19.240]  today, which is like the epicenter
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.240]  of West Coast COVID.
[00:20.280 --> 00:21.280]  But anyway, into
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.160]  the airport.
[00:23.360 --> 00:24.280]  Right.
[00:24.280 --> 00:26.320]  So we are live.
[00:27.240 --> 00:28.480]  James, take it away.
[00:28.640 --> 00:30.040]  And just quickly, I'm going to jump
[00:30.040 --> 00:31.800]  off in a minute and I just wanted
[00:31.800 --> 00:33.040]  to say a quick hello to everyone.
[00:33.080 --> 00:33.800]  So go for it.
[00:33.800 --> 00:35.520]  Yeah, man. Thank you for coming on
[00:35.520 --> 00:36.280]  for a hot second.
[00:36.280 --> 00:37.120]  Love your hair.
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.120]  Looks great, Peter.
[00:39.440 --> 00:40.920]  I put much effort into it.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.480]  So, yeah, happy 2022.
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.440]  I just wanted to do a good show
[00:45.440 --> 00:47.440]  to keep the new year off.
[00:47.440 --> 00:48.960]  And Peter is
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.800]  where you at, Peter, in New York?
[00:52.120 --> 00:53.000]  Hawaii.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Hawaii. Oh, you're in Hawaii.
[00:54.280 --> 00:55.280]  Lucky you.
[00:55.680 --> 00:56.800]  Nice. That sounds amazing.
[00:57.760 --> 00:59.080]  Yeah, I'm in California.
[00:59.320 --> 01:00.960]  It's just staying home, hanging out
[01:00.960 --> 01:01.960]  with the family.
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.160]  And I wanted to do a fun little
[01:04.160 --> 01:05.160]  episode and we
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.240]  might even call some people up.
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.920]  But I was going to do the best of
[01:08.920 --> 01:09.760]  2021.
[01:09.760 --> 01:10.760]  And so.
[01:12.120 --> 01:13.120]  You know, there's a lot of great
[01:13.120 --> 01:15.080]  moments. I think it was a tough year
[01:15.080 --> 01:17.320]  for a lot of us.
[01:18.960 --> 01:20.240]  And then it was a great year for
[01:20.240 --> 01:21.440]  other people. I had a great year,
[01:21.440 --> 01:23.400]  personally. I mean, I'm blessed to
[01:23.520 --> 01:24.360]  have done what I've done.
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.200]  I wish I would have done more
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.400]  episodes with Peter.
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.640]  And you guys would.
[01:27.840 --> 01:28.960]  I had a great year. I made a lot of
[01:28.960 --> 01:29.880]  seeds.
[01:29.880 --> 01:31.520]  I made a lot of new friends.
[01:31.520 --> 01:32.920]  I worked all over
[01:33.560 --> 01:35.320]  the world and a lot of stuff
[01:35.320 --> 01:36.080]  in the United States.
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.760]  So, you know, I'm blessed to be
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.760]  where I'm at.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.760]  But let's see,
[01:42.400 --> 01:44.440]  we can go through some
[01:44.440 --> 01:45.440]  of the fun stuff.
[01:45.640 --> 01:47.480]  Marlon Asher and I, who's
[01:47.520 --> 01:48.760]  one of my partners and he's been on
[01:48.760 --> 01:49.760]  the show.
[01:51.240 --> 01:52.600]  He took me to some concerts this
[01:52.600 --> 01:53.920]  year. So the best concert of the
[01:53.920 --> 01:54.920]  year, Cannabis
[01:55.920 --> 01:58.120]  Related, was Slightly Stupid
[01:58.120 --> 01:59.960]  with Charlie Tuna, Don Carlos
[01:59.960 --> 02:01.560]  and Marlon Asher down in San Diego.
[02:02.120 --> 02:03.120]  Unreal.
[02:05.680 --> 02:06.680]  That was just an amazing show.
[02:06.680 --> 02:07.800]  I got to go backstage. If you watch
[02:07.800 --> 02:09.040]  the videos that they filmed from the
[02:09.040 --> 02:10.160]  show, you'll see me sitting next to
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.120]  Kyle's mom or standing next to Kyle's
[02:12.120 --> 02:14.520]  mom and Charlie Tuna backstage.
[02:14.560 --> 02:16.360]  It was a great time.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.480]  And.
[02:19.720 --> 02:21.440]  Yeah, so I went to
[02:21.880 --> 02:23.360]  only a handful of concerts last year.
[02:23.360 --> 02:24.480]  Usually I like to go to a lot of
[02:24.480 --> 02:25.960]  concerts, but I went to Dead & Company.
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.240]  So I did. And that was great.
[02:27.480 --> 02:29.360]  I made peace with
[02:29.360 --> 02:31.240]  my dislike for John
[02:31.240 --> 02:32.240]  Mayer.
[02:32.640 --> 02:34.560]  You know, surprisingly, I
[02:34.560 --> 02:35.640]  think he does a great job.
[02:35.760 --> 02:37.280]  I think he did a great job with
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.120]  everybody in his performance
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.120]  and his involvement
[02:44.320 --> 02:45.840]  with Dead & Company and with Bobby
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.960]  and everything. He does his own
[02:46.960 --> 02:49.000]  thing. He's not Jerry, but truly,
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.000]  truly amazing.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.200]  And let's see.
[02:54.640 --> 02:56.520]  The best live song, though, the
[02:56.520 --> 02:58.360]  best live song of 2021
[02:58.800 --> 03:00.600]  was So Many Roads by
[03:00.600 --> 03:02.000]  Billy and the Kids at Red Rocks.
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.480]  You can you can go on YouTube.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.840]  It's on YouTube recorded.
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.520]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:08.040 --> 03:09.680]  We'll get into some of the other
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.680]  stuff.
[03:11.200 --> 03:12.840]  How about best extract
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.000]  artists? What do you guys think?
[03:14.560 --> 03:15.920]  I know we have how many people are
[03:15.920 --> 03:16.920]  in the chat right now.
[03:18.840 --> 03:19.840]  About one hundred.
[03:20.480 --> 03:21.600]  About one hundred. You guys got
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.080]  opinions on the best extract
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.080]  artist.
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.100]  I'm not seeing anything live.
[03:30.260 --> 03:31.620]  We got no comments.
[03:34.180 --> 03:36.060]  You see you don't see the comments.
[03:36.340 --> 03:37.700]  I do see comments, but I don't see
[03:37.700 --> 03:39.940]  anything going in past 1106.
[03:39.980 --> 03:41.620]  Someone said, well,
[03:41.620 --> 03:42.620]  hello there.
[03:43.620 --> 03:45.580]  Cheddar Bob nominated himself.
[03:46.100 --> 03:47.100]  Cheddar Bob.
[03:47.740 --> 03:49.220]  I'm going to say Nicotine.
[03:50.460 --> 03:52.460]  I saw some really amazing stuff
[03:52.740 --> 03:54.660]  up in Washington from
[03:55.220 --> 03:57.260]  North Pacific Northwest Roots.
[03:57.260 --> 03:58.260]  Their stuff is amazing.
[03:58.260 --> 03:59.860]  But Nicotine always comes through
[03:59.860 --> 04:00.860]  with the heat
[04:01.660 --> 04:02.740]  every time I've seen him
[04:03.500 --> 04:04.740]  and all the stuff.
[04:04.780 --> 04:06.420]  You know, I think Archive
[04:06.420 --> 04:08.460]  also does friggin
[04:08.540 --> 04:09.780]  insane, but they're going to get
[04:09.780 --> 04:11.860]  the best. Rosen was Archive
[04:11.860 --> 04:12.900]  Moonbow. If you guys ever go to
[04:12.900 --> 04:14.820]  Portland, you need to get
[04:14.820 --> 04:16.380]  that friggin Moonbow Rosen.
[04:16.900 --> 04:17.700]  There's nothing like it.
[04:17.700 --> 04:18.740]  I got to try some
[04:19.620 --> 04:21.180]  from Adam and Archive.
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.180]  I met him recently.
[04:22.180 --> 04:24.060]  We met down in Mexico and
[04:24.060 --> 04:25.620]  those dudes got the craziest
[04:25.700 --> 04:26.700]  extract.
[04:26.700 --> 04:27.980]  Moonbow by itself is an amazing
[04:27.980 --> 04:29.180]  strain. I absolutely love it.
[04:29.180 --> 04:30.180]  It's a dosido
[04:32.700 --> 04:35.060]  time Skittles
[04:35.180 --> 04:36.140]  is what Moonbow is.
[04:36.140 --> 04:37.340]  And then you guys heard of Rainbow
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.820]  Belts. That's back to the Skittles
[04:38.820 --> 04:40.060]  again is where they got the Rainbow
[04:40.060 --> 04:41.060]  Belts.
[04:41.180 --> 04:43.220]  But that Moonbow
[04:43.860 --> 04:45.500]  extract, I think it took it took
[04:45.980 --> 04:47.740]  in the Masters of House down in L.A.
[04:47.740 --> 04:48.900]  It took third place.
[04:48.900 --> 04:50.700]  And I would say it is the
[04:50.700 --> 04:52.620]  best extract I've ever smoked
[04:52.620 --> 04:53.860]  in my life.
[04:53.860 --> 04:54.860]  It's
[04:56.340 --> 04:57.340]  it's sweet.
[04:57.340 --> 04:58.340]  It's your highest fuck.
[04:58.660 --> 05:00.460]  It literally checks all the
[05:00.460 --> 05:02.100]  box boxes and then some.
[05:04.460 --> 05:06.660]  So you had some votes for Bird
[05:06.660 --> 05:07.860]  Extracts,
[05:08.500 --> 05:11.260]  Nickitze, Blue River,
[05:11.780 --> 05:13.220]  Icehouse Melts.
[05:15.140 --> 05:16.340]  All these things are great.
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.500]  All of the things are good.
[05:18.500 --> 05:20.380]  Yeah. Puffin Solventless down
[05:20.380 --> 05:21.380]  here in L.A.
[05:21.860 --> 05:22.860]  Puffin Solventless.
[05:22.860 --> 05:24.580]  Yeah. I mean, Bird, I have to say
[05:24.580 --> 05:26.540]  big ups to Bird for his extract.
[05:26.540 --> 05:27.860]  His stuff is fire, too.
[05:28.300 --> 05:29.300]  Like ridiculous.
[05:29.900 --> 05:31.580]  But there's just something special
[05:31.580 --> 05:33.260]  about that friggin Moonbow.
[05:34.660 --> 05:36.060]  So I love that one.
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.460]  And then
[05:38.540 --> 05:40.380]  let's see. Best interview, not
[05:40.380 --> 05:41.700]  just on my show, but best interview
[05:41.700 --> 05:42.900]  on my show. I would say the best
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.620]  interview of the year for me was the
[05:44.620 --> 05:46.500]  Mexican episode where I was in
[05:46.500 --> 05:48.540]  Mexico City two
[05:48.540 --> 05:50.220]  weeks ago. That was just it was a
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.820]  lot of fun. I had an amazing time
[05:51.820 --> 05:53.220]  down there. I was totally blown away
[05:53.220 --> 05:54.220]  by the cannabis.
[05:54.820 --> 05:56.260]  Stuff was freaking amazing.
[05:56.260 --> 05:57.260]  And then overall
[05:58.540 --> 06:00.300]  interviews, I would say I did an
[06:00.300 --> 06:01.660]  interview with Jeremy Plum.
[06:02.180 --> 06:03.860]  Him and I were interviewed
[06:05.820 --> 06:07.740]  earlier in the year, and that was
[06:07.740 --> 06:08.620]  that was the most fun.
[06:08.620 --> 06:09.540]  I feel like there was a lot of
[06:09.540 --> 06:10.540]  information, a lot
[06:11.460 --> 06:12.460]  of good stuff.
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.620]  So what was your guys' favorite
[06:15.620 --> 06:16.620]  interview?
[06:18.700 --> 06:20.780]  Like across the entire network?
[06:20.980 --> 06:21.980]  Yeah.
[06:22.300 --> 06:23.300]  My, my, my, my,
[06:23.820 --> 06:24.820]  my, my, my.
[06:24.860 --> 06:26.340]  I mean, it's a complete blur
[06:26.340 --> 06:27.340]  for me.
[06:28.580 --> 06:29.940]  I got to think about that.
[06:31.460 --> 06:33.260]  I think probably some of the
[06:34.340 --> 06:35.660]  I mean, I like listening to kind of
[06:35.660 --> 06:37.940]  like plant and soil scientist talk.
[06:38.580 --> 06:39.700]  Yeah, I had fun.
[06:39.700 --> 06:40.700]  So I brought
[06:41.700 --> 06:43.100]  this guy who studies
[06:43.580 --> 06:45.060]  poinsettia and
[06:45.500 --> 06:46.900]  photo period plants.
[06:47.940 --> 06:49.300]  That was fun just to listen to him
[06:49.300 --> 06:50.900]  tell the history of like this
[06:51.180 --> 06:52.940]  specific cultivar or the specific
[06:53.260 --> 06:54.660]  plant and the, you know,
[06:55.460 --> 06:56.460]  various
[06:57.740 --> 06:59.580]  cultivar, you know, from from
[07:00.740 --> 07:02.300]  something that looked like I mean,
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.820]  of the cannabis equivalent, something
[07:03.820 --> 07:04.820]  that looked like
[07:06.140 --> 07:08.540]  freak show or ABC
[07:08.860 --> 07:10.220]  in the wild and then turned
[07:10.700 --> 07:11.700]  into like something
[07:12.860 --> 07:14.260]  that looks like what you
[07:14.780 --> 07:17.260]  view as a, you know, typical
[07:17.660 --> 07:19.300]  cannabis plant looking plant all
[07:19.300 --> 07:20.300]  through the years.
[07:20.900 --> 07:22.660]  All through, you know,
[07:22.940 --> 07:24.460]  generations of breeding.
[07:25.900 --> 07:26.660]  Yeah.
[07:26.660 --> 07:28.300]  And all the grafting and stuff.
[07:28.300 --> 07:29.620]  So it's just cool to learn about
[07:29.620 --> 07:31.220]  just like, you know, and then
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.700]  I think in one of the conversations
[07:33.900 --> 07:35.900]  like my brother just bought 30 acres
[07:35.900 --> 07:37.500]  in Connecticut
[07:37.940 --> 07:40.140]  to create an orchard
[07:40.180 --> 07:41.700]  because they have a yogurt company
[07:41.700 --> 07:43.340]  and they want to process all their
[07:43.340 --> 07:45.220]  own seasonal fruits.
[07:45.700 --> 07:47.700]  And so then like talking about
[07:47.900 --> 07:49.220]  learning about like in the
[07:49.740 --> 07:51.900]  peach world, kind of taking
[07:52.380 --> 07:53.740]  root stock from one cultivar
[07:54.700 --> 07:55.700]  that
[07:57.260 --> 07:59.180]  thrive, you know, doesn't have,
[07:59.220 --> 08:01.460]  you know, pest and pathogen issues
[08:01.460 --> 08:02.380]  in the soil.
[08:02.380 --> 08:03.820]  And then, you know, putting a
[08:04.260 --> 08:05.740]  different cultivar that has the
[08:05.740 --> 08:07.300]  better tasting fruit on it.
[08:07.340 --> 08:08.860]  So just stuff like that for me is
[08:08.860 --> 08:10.860]  pretty cool to just listen
[08:10.860 --> 08:11.820]  to people who know what they're
[08:11.820 --> 08:13.620]  talking about, just drop knowledge.
[08:14.340 --> 08:15.860]  So that but that's also some of the
[08:15.860 --> 08:16.820]  most recent stuff.
[08:16.820 --> 08:18.780]  So that's probably why
[08:18.780 --> 08:19.780]  I can remember it.
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.540]  I feel like you get a lot of
[08:21.540 --> 08:22.620]  repetitive stuff.
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.300]  It's like and I get a lot of
[08:24.300 --> 08:25.860]  contradictory information.
[08:26.140 --> 08:27.340]  Oh, my God. A lot of people
[08:27.340 --> 08:28.540]  contradicting each other.
[08:28.540 --> 08:30.060]  And what's cool is actually the
[08:30.060 --> 08:31.380]  whole chat is like, wait,
[08:32.220 --> 08:33.900]  someone last week said the exact
[08:33.900 --> 08:35.660]  opposite. So it's kind of cool that
[08:35.660 --> 08:36.660]  people and
[08:37.780 --> 08:39.460]  my whole philosophy on all this has
[08:39.660 --> 08:40.660]  been like.
[08:41.900 --> 08:43.220]  To let people
[08:44.780 --> 08:47.100]  without sound bites and long form
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.940]  make their points and their cases
[08:48.940 --> 08:50.780]  and hopefully well articulated.
[08:51.060 --> 08:52.860]  And then if someone disagrees
[08:53.300 --> 08:55.220]  to let them also articulate
[08:55.220 --> 08:57.340]  their points and let people kind of
[08:57.820 --> 08:59.820]  infer and draw from it what
[08:59.820 --> 09:00.820]  they want.
[09:03.260 --> 09:05.460]  So it's kind of letting a variety
[09:05.460 --> 09:06.220]  of thoughts.
[09:06.220 --> 09:08.100]  And obviously, we all know,
[09:08.140 --> 09:10.020]  like, not not everybody's 100 percent
[09:10.020 --> 09:11.500]  right on everything they say.
[09:12.060 --> 09:13.060]  And so it's.
[09:13.660 --> 09:15.540]  We saw that with Ed and Selma.
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.340]  That was my favorite interview of
[09:18.340 --> 09:19.220]  the year, by the way.
[09:19.220 --> 09:20.220]  And somebody said it was their
[09:20.220 --> 09:21.060]  favorite.
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.060]  And I was
[09:23.220 --> 09:24.180]  kind of stuck in the middle.
[09:24.180 --> 09:25.620]  And, you know, I had Ed as a
[09:25.620 --> 09:27.020]  surprise guest on Selma's show.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.860]  We're going to get Selma on again by
[09:28.860 --> 09:30.780]  himself because I feel like Ed
[09:30.980 --> 09:32.780]  sabotaged the episode a little bit
[09:32.780 --> 09:33.660]  just by being Ed.
[09:33.660 --> 09:34.660]  And I should have known better.
[09:35.060 --> 09:36.060]  But it was that was
[09:37.060 --> 09:38.060]  a crazy episode.
[09:38.580 --> 09:39.580]  But.
[09:40.300 --> 09:41.140]  Yeah, lots of fun.
[09:41.140 --> 09:42.580]  Yeah, with stuff like that, you
[09:42.580 --> 09:44.340]  never know. Like it could be
[09:44.380 --> 09:46.540]  magic. It could be disaster.
[09:46.540 --> 09:48.340]  It could be something in between.
[09:48.780 --> 09:49.660]  And that's your point.
[09:49.660 --> 09:50.940]  It's like some people were like,
[09:50.940 --> 09:52.300]  that was great. Other people were
[09:52.300 --> 09:53.820]  like, that was a disaster.
[09:54.340 --> 09:56.220]  So, I mean, I lost hair
[09:56.220 --> 09:57.220]  from that episode.
[09:58.300 --> 10:00.340]  So see, even Chad was like Ed
[10:00.340 --> 10:01.940]  versus Selma was the best.
[10:02.540 --> 10:03.540]  That's funny.
[10:04.260 --> 10:05.420]  Yeah. And those guys are so
[10:05.420 --> 10:06.900]  conflicting in their old school
[10:06.900 --> 10:08.740]  OGs. And, you know, I love
[10:08.740 --> 10:09.740]  both those guys.
[10:10.580 --> 10:11.780]  We've been friends for a long time,
[10:11.780 --> 10:13.340]  but together it was like fire and
[10:13.340 --> 10:14.340]  ice.
[10:14.980 --> 10:16.940]  More like oil and water, like
[10:16.940 --> 10:17.940]  hot oil.
[10:20.380 --> 10:22.860]  So, yeah, so best weed photos
[10:23.460 --> 10:25.700]  of 2021 goes to
[10:25.940 --> 10:27.740]  Eric Nugshots at IG.
[10:28.820 --> 10:30.860]  If you guys, it's Eric dot
[10:30.860 --> 10:32.660]  Nugshots and it's spelled with a K
[10:32.660 --> 10:34.700]  E R I K dot Nugshots.
[10:35.340 --> 10:37.140]  And he's like he's
[10:37.300 --> 10:38.620]  he's doing amazing stuff.
[10:38.700 --> 10:40.100]  He's just, you know,
[10:40.860 --> 10:42.100]  it's just ridiculous.
[10:42.900 --> 10:44.540]  The quality work that he's doing.
[10:46.580 --> 10:48.420]  So most entertaining
[10:48.500 --> 10:50.020]  Instagram page of the year,
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.020]  cannabis related, I thought
[10:52.020 --> 10:53.060]  was Shiloh Massive.
[10:53.580 --> 10:55.540]  He's got his
[10:55.740 --> 10:57.700]  daily aphorisms constantly going
[10:57.700 --> 10:58.980]  up there. Yeah, there's Eric
[10:58.980 --> 10:59.980]  Nugshots.
[11:00.740 --> 11:02.780]  And the massive creations,
[11:02.780 --> 11:04.020]  I think it's massive creations
[11:04.020 --> 11:04.780]  underscore one.
[11:04.780 --> 11:05.860]  Yeah. Look at those pictures.
[11:05.860 --> 11:06.980]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[11:07.620 --> 11:09.500]  He he's taken it to
[11:09.500 --> 11:10.500]  the next level.
[11:10.540 --> 11:11.700]  You know, I hope I get to work with
[11:11.700 --> 11:13.340]  him someday with some of my stuff.
[11:14.100 --> 11:15.300]  You know, he's working with the top
[11:15.300 --> 11:17.140]  guys and producing top quality
[11:17.140 --> 11:18.140]  stuff.
[11:18.180 --> 11:19.620]  But yeah, so Shiloh Massive with
[11:19.620 --> 11:20.540]  massive creations.
[11:20.540 --> 11:21.780]  He's got his aphorisms.
[11:21.780 --> 11:23.780]  He's constantly saying funny stuff.
[11:25.900 --> 11:26.900]  Yeah.
[11:28.420 --> 11:30.660]  Best auto flower companies
[11:30.660 --> 11:31.980]  of 2021.
[11:33.100 --> 11:35.180]  We guys think I'm
[11:35.180 --> 11:37.020]  in there's there's there's a few
[11:37.020 --> 11:38.900]  of them, you know, there's a few
[11:38.900 --> 11:39.940]  of them that are doing different
[11:39.940 --> 11:41.780]  stuff. And I take it back to
[11:41.780 --> 11:43.100]  Mephisto every time
[11:43.780 --> 11:45.460]  with auto anything Mephisto
[11:45.460 --> 11:46.580]  genetics. I really like their
[11:46.580 --> 11:48.300]  company, the quality of their
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.260]  genetics.
[11:49.260 --> 11:50.380]  You know, they've kind of pushed the
[11:50.380 --> 11:51.860]  industry like without them, there
[11:51.860 --> 11:53.740]  would be no auto industry, I feel,
[11:54.220 --> 11:55.900]  or it wouldn't be as advanced as it
[11:55.900 --> 11:56.900]  is for sure.
[11:57.740 --> 11:59.020]  Gnome Automatics, which is
[11:59.020 --> 12:01.020]  formerly Mandalorian for that.
[12:01.060 --> 12:02.380]  That's what I was going to say
[12:02.820 --> 12:04.580]  that they've been getting a
[12:04.580 --> 12:05.660]  lot of positive.
[12:07.900 --> 12:09.740]  I think they're doing some really
[12:10.220 --> 12:11.500]  stuff. You know, they're getting
[12:11.500 --> 12:12.500]  purple in their eyes.
[12:12.500 --> 12:13.420]  I'm breeding with some of their
[12:13.420 --> 12:15.220]  stuff. So, you know, to get my
[12:15.220 --> 12:16.980]  gelato purple, I'm actually using
[12:16.980 --> 12:18.580]  their hand bill and black strap and
[12:18.580 --> 12:20.220]  doing some work
[12:20.620 --> 12:22.260]  to try to reinforce some traits
[12:23.020 --> 12:24.980]  and using their work to reinforce
[12:24.980 --> 12:26.260]  some traits, which I think is great.
[12:26.260 --> 12:27.300]  I mean, that's what we should all be
[12:27.300 --> 12:29.020]  doing is, you know, improving
[12:29.020 --> 12:30.260]  genetics. And I feel like there's
[12:30.260 --> 12:31.780]  to use more turps and mine to use
[12:31.780 --> 12:32.940]  more color. And so putting them
[12:32.940 --> 12:33.980]  together, hopefully we get some
[12:33.980 --> 12:34.980]  cool shit.
[12:35.300 --> 12:37.140]  And just quickly with that, I'm
[12:37.140 --> 12:38.900]  going to jump off so I
[12:38.900 --> 12:40.620]  can take one swim with the kids and
[12:40.620 --> 12:41.620]  then pack up.
[12:41.860 --> 12:43.740]  So I will see you all in the
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.580]  new year and I'll probably
[12:45.580 --> 12:46.980]  be in the chat. So see everyone.
[12:48.700 --> 12:49.700]  Fantastic.
[12:51.380 --> 12:52.380]  So London.
[12:52.580 --> 12:53.980]  OK, so we're going to take a quick
[12:53.980 --> 12:55.260]  break from all this stuff and talk
[12:55.260 --> 12:57.380]  about my family's CBD
[12:57.380 --> 12:59.860]  company. It's in Dallas, Texas,

[13:30.740 --> 13:32.540]  10 pack of seeds, not just five.
[13:32.540 --> 13:34.460]  We're going to do 10 packs and

[13:46.060 --> 13:47.220]  coming soon. You could use the
[13:47.580 --> 13:49.220]  sausage one for a cat, I guess.
[13:49.780 --> 13:51.460]  But and some of the new interesting
[13:51.460 --> 13:52.700]  stuff we're working with lidocaine
[13:52.700 --> 13:53.700]  and CBD.
[13:54.220 --> 13:55.220]  My parents.

[13:57.540 --> 13:58.540]  with Sweet Wellness.

[14:13.380 --> 14:15.300]  a screenshot of your receipt.
[14:16.700 --> 14:18.220]  So back to.
[14:20.620 --> 14:22.100]  Shortest flowering strain of the
[14:22.100 --> 14:23.100]  year, I just
[14:24.140 --> 14:26.220]  feel like that's something
[14:26.220 --> 14:27.100]  important.
[14:27.100 --> 14:28.340]  We're talking about traits on this
[14:28.340 --> 14:30.140]  show, breeding traits, things that
[14:30.140 --> 14:31.260]  you can incorporate into your
[14:31.260 --> 14:32.380]  genetics to make them better.
[14:33.260 --> 14:35.060]  Magic Melon from Humboldt Seed
[14:35.060 --> 14:36.060]  Company.
[14:36.540 --> 14:38.540]  That one is definitely a winner.
[14:38.540 --> 14:40.180]  We're talking about 45 day strain
[14:40.580 --> 14:42.300]  and then we got deep end butter for
[14:42.300 --> 14:44.060]  root down genetics, which is
[14:44.220 --> 14:45.300]  clone only in the Bay.
[14:45.780 --> 14:46.820]  You'll see the flower, but that's
[14:46.820 --> 14:48.780]  another forty three to forty
[14:48.780 --> 14:50.820]  five day variety that's like done
[14:50.820 --> 14:51.980]  in forty three days.
[14:52.980 --> 14:54.780]  And that's the profile on that
[14:54.780 --> 14:55.620]  melon.
[14:55.620 --> 14:57.180]  Dude, it's it's pretty
[14:57.700 --> 14:58.700]  ridiculous.
[14:59.260 --> 15:00.940]  It is one of my top upcoming
[15:01.420 --> 15:02.420]  files.
[15:02.540 --> 15:03.540]  Gasping.
[15:05.860 --> 15:07.020]  Is what the magic melon?
[15:07.740 --> 15:08.460]  Yeah. Yeah.
[15:08.460 --> 15:09.340]  I don't know if I'm coming through a
[15:09.340 --> 15:10.380]  little bit fuzzy, but yeah, the
[15:10.380 --> 15:11.380]  magic melon.
[15:11.540 --> 15:13.140]  Well, not magic, but melon
[15:13.300 --> 15:15.020]  terpenes in general is kind of like
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.660]  last year was my prediction for
[15:16.660 --> 15:18.060]  twenty twenty two is the flavors
[15:18.060 --> 15:19.380]  that will start coming popping up
[15:19.380 --> 15:20.620]  and coming forward again.
[15:21.220 --> 15:23.180]  Yeah, I mean, there was like the
[15:23.180 --> 15:24.220]  melonade that has like the
[15:24.220 --> 15:25.620]  cantaloupe. And I like that.
[15:25.660 --> 15:26.580]  I think it's cool.
[15:26.580 --> 15:28.780]  I think it's diverse for
[15:28.780 --> 15:30.420]  you. But that was for me, that was a
[15:30.420 --> 15:31.420]  couple of years ago.
[15:32.300 --> 15:33.980]  I feel like, you know, we're talking
[15:33.980 --> 15:35.420]  about twenty twenty two, what's going
[15:35.420 --> 15:36.180]  to be popular.
[15:36.180 --> 15:37.700]  Sour diesel is going to make a
[15:37.700 --> 15:38.540]  comeback.
[15:38.540 --> 15:39.700]  Everybody's been hyping it.
[15:39.700 --> 15:40.660]  It's going to make a comeback.
[15:40.660 --> 15:41.740]  And it's not just sour diesel, it's
[15:41.740 --> 15:42.740]  gas.
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.020]  I feel like if you have purple gas,
[15:45.020 --> 15:46.060]  it's going to go a lot better.
[15:46.620 --> 15:48.620]  Unfortunately for me, color doesn't
[15:48.620 --> 15:50.660]  really matter, but it
[15:50.660 --> 15:51.940]  matters to me in the sense that it
[15:51.940 --> 15:52.940]  matters to the market.
[15:53.220 --> 15:54.740]  And that's kind of how if you're if
[15:54.740 --> 15:56.180]  you're making seeds to sell,
[15:57.380 --> 15:58.820]  you can either do whatever you're
[15:58.820 --> 16:00.660]  doing and find your own niche or
[16:00.660 --> 16:02.220]  you can jump on the bandwagon
[16:02.860 --> 16:03.860]  or you can do both.
[16:03.980 --> 16:05.180]  And so I feel like
[16:06.020 --> 16:07.380]  one of those important things,
[16:07.900 --> 16:09.140]  someone says skunk is coming back.
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.420]  If we can find the roadkill skunk,
[16:10.420 --> 16:11.580]  it's coming back. But that sweet
[16:11.580 --> 16:13.180]  skunk, unless it's something like
[16:13.180 --> 16:14.900]  shoreline, I'm not you know, I'm not
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.100]  seeing skunk varieties
[16:17.100 --> 16:18.780]  making a huge comeback unless
[16:18.780 --> 16:20.220]  they're super, super loud.
[16:20.220 --> 16:22.140]  I mean, everything that you smoke,
[16:22.140 --> 16:23.620]  you want it to be really bright.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.540]  When people are buying stuff, they
[16:25.540 --> 16:26.540]  want it bright.
[16:26.700 --> 16:28.740]  So purple punch in northern
[16:28.740 --> 16:29.740]  lights.
[16:29.860 --> 16:31.780]  I just purple punch is not
[16:31.780 --> 16:32.900]  one of my favorites, but breeding
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.140]  it, I think it breeds a lot of
[16:34.140 --> 16:35.500]  interesting things for sure.
[16:37.540 --> 16:38.540]  Let's see.
[16:39.380 --> 16:40.300]  What else do you guys think is
[16:40.300 --> 16:41.020]  coming back?
[16:41.020 --> 16:42.100]  Oh, gosh.
[16:43.740 --> 16:44.700]  The OG.
[16:44.700 --> 16:46.580]  Yeah, so top dog looks
[16:46.580 --> 16:47.540]  fire for a sour.
[16:47.540 --> 16:48.540]  Yes, top dog.
[16:49.060 --> 16:50.820]  So top dog and Leo
[16:50.820 --> 16:52.260]  and there's a couple other people,
[16:52.260 --> 16:53.660]  but I think those guys are doing
[16:53.660 --> 16:55.620]  karma as well with their back
[16:55.620 --> 16:57.020]  crosses. I was doing back crosses
[16:57.020 --> 16:58.260]  this hour with my partner.
[16:59.140 --> 17:00.140]  Over 10 years ago.
[17:01.380 --> 17:03.420]  And, you know, that
[17:03.540 --> 17:04.580]  project went away.
[17:04.580 --> 17:06.220]  We're redoing some of the stuff
[17:06.220 --> 17:08.260]  I'm I'm working on some interesting
[17:08.260 --> 17:09.460]  stuff with sour with a couple of
[17:09.460 --> 17:10.460]  people using
[17:11.260 --> 17:12.260]  sequencing.
[17:12.300 --> 17:13.460]  We're going to be sequencing all
[17:13.460 --> 17:14.820]  our stuff to try to really breed a
[17:14.820 --> 17:16.340]  true sour that's an eight weeker.
[17:16.980 --> 17:18.180]  So we'll see how that goes.
[17:18.380 --> 17:19.340]  So it's a white widow.
[17:19.340 --> 17:20.340]  I don't think so.
[17:21.100 --> 17:22.420]  I don't think white widows making a
[17:22.420 --> 17:24.180]  comeback this year, not
[17:24.180 --> 17:25.420]  unless you get some crazy white
[17:25.420 --> 17:27.300]  widow cut. It's like not white
[17:27.340 --> 17:28.340]  widow.
[17:29.020 --> 17:30.740]  But yeah.
[17:32.340 --> 17:35.060]  So let's see.
[17:36.300 --> 17:38.020]  We're going best in a really good
[17:38.020 --> 17:40.540]  that Mexico City best extract,
[17:40.780 --> 17:42.140]  best extract I smoke
[17:42.620 --> 17:44.700]  in the last year was sticky
[17:44.700 --> 17:46.780]  farms, Pluto, BHO
[17:47.260 --> 17:49.620]  as far as solvent.
[17:50.860 --> 17:52.780]  And it came with diamonds with
[17:52.780 --> 17:54.860]  some sauce and that sauce was just
[17:55.180 --> 17:56.180]  mouth coating.
[17:57.740 --> 17:59.460]  I just saw some Pluto nugs last week
[17:59.460 --> 18:00.860]  that were amazing. Pluto is one of my
[18:00.860 --> 18:02.140]  favorite since from sticky farms.
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.100]  It's from Gas House. Actually, Gas
[18:04.100 --> 18:05.780]  House sells it on the retail market.
[18:05.780 --> 18:07.380]  It comes in gas bags with the farm
[18:07.380 --> 18:08.540]  that produces sticky farms.
[18:08.580 --> 18:09.660]  Those guys do amazing work.
[18:10.140 --> 18:12.140]  Big ups to Felix and Mike
[18:12.140 --> 18:13.420]  and everybody over at Gas House.
[18:13.420 --> 18:14.500]  Those guys crush.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.740]  Also, Casey
[18:16.820 --> 18:18.380]  and Pablo from Sticky.
[18:18.820 --> 18:20.300]  Man, those guys make quite a team.
[18:20.940 --> 18:21.780]  You know, they're doing some
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.380]  interesting crosses that I'm going
[18:23.380 --> 18:24.380]  through right now.
[18:24.860 --> 18:25.860]  I got a bag.
[18:26.580 --> 18:27.580]  See this bag of.
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.020]  Crosses.
[18:31.220 --> 18:32.500]  From sticky farms.
[18:33.220 --> 18:35.060]  This one is GMO lava cake
[18:35.060 --> 18:36.060]  times Pluto.
[18:37.180 --> 18:38.340]  Apple fritters.
[18:38.340 --> 18:39.340]  We got
[18:40.380 --> 18:41.620]  amazing ones. Lava dog.
[18:42.060 --> 18:43.020]  The one that I thought was really
[18:43.020 --> 18:45.500]  special was the Z cubed
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.020]  times Pluto.
[18:47.340 --> 18:48.460]  So we'll see how that goes.
[18:48.460 --> 18:49.460]  Those guys.
[18:49.700 --> 18:50.700]  Mind blowing.
[18:50.780 --> 18:51.780]  Super skittly.
[18:52.580 --> 18:54.740]  I think I've got the right sticky
[18:54.740 --> 18:55.780]  farms here.
[18:55.780 --> 18:57.180]  Is this is this right?
[18:57.500 --> 18:58.500]  I'm the right one.
[18:58.700 --> 19:00.700]  I think I think it's sticky farms
[19:00.700 --> 19:01.780]  ink on their Instagram.
[19:02.180 --> 19:03.260]  Sticky farms ink on their
[19:03.260 --> 19:04.260]  Instagram.
[19:06.820 --> 19:08.580]  So Pablo is an old school grower.
[19:08.620 --> 19:09.820]  He's been selling the harbors.
[19:09.860 --> 19:11.860]  He was so the harborside for years
[19:13.020 --> 19:14.100]  before the Pluto.
[19:14.140 --> 19:15.260]  And he's old school.
[19:15.620 --> 19:16.740]  He's kind of under one of those
[19:16.740 --> 19:18.100]  companies. Sticky farms is kind of
[19:18.100 --> 19:19.100]  under the radar.
[19:19.500 --> 19:21.180]  And Casey and Pablo.
[19:22.380 --> 19:24.100]  And Eric and a couple of these other
[19:24.100 --> 19:25.340]  guys, you know, they're under the
[19:25.340 --> 19:26.900]  radar. But these guys crush
[19:27.380 --> 19:28.580]  the quality of their flower.
[19:28.620 --> 19:29.460]  The quality of their depth is
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.380]  amazing.
[19:30.380 --> 19:31.900]  Their indoors next level.
[19:31.900 --> 19:33.140]  I mean, we're talking about big
[19:33.140 --> 19:34.140]  chunky nugs
[19:35.260 --> 19:36.900]  that are just super bright in a bag.
[19:36.940 --> 19:38.660]  I mean, some of the best stuff I've
[19:38.660 --> 19:39.660]  ever smoked.
[19:41.500 --> 19:43.900]  So sticky farms ink on Instagram.
[19:47.300 --> 19:48.300]  Let's see.
[19:49.380 --> 19:51.380]  OG of the Year Award.
[19:51.500 --> 19:52.500]  I got three people for
[19:53.500 --> 19:54.500]  the best OGs of
[19:55.380 --> 19:56.380]  2021.
[19:56.980 --> 19:58.140]  And I want to give a big shout out
[19:58.140 --> 20:00.460]  to my friend Dave Mesford from
[20:00.500 --> 20:01.340]  Seattle.
[20:01.340 --> 20:02.780]  He's actually from a little north of
[20:02.780 --> 20:04.940]  Seattle, but great photographer,
[20:04.940 --> 20:06.060]  a great friend. He took pictures of
[20:06.060 --> 20:07.060]  me in high times.
[20:07.740 --> 20:08.500]  He's an activist.
[20:08.500 --> 20:10.220]  He's you know, he's part of
[20:10.540 --> 20:11.540]  CannaCon.
[20:11.980 --> 20:13.860]  He's part of the Hemp Fest up
[20:13.860 --> 20:14.620]  in Seattle.
[20:14.620 --> 20:16.500]  He's a huge activist
[20:16.500 --> 20:17.580]  and just great person.
[20:18.740 --> 20:19.820]  And I want to give a shout out to
[20:19.820 --> 20:21.540]  some of the women that
[20:21.580 --> 20:22.660]  are married to the men that you
[20:22.660 --> 20:23.740]  guys don't even know about.
[20:23.740 --> 20:24.740]  Jane Rosenthal,
[20:25.540 --> 20:26.540]  Ed's wife.
[20:26.860 --> 20:28.460]  She doesn't get a lot of publicity,
[20:28.460 --> 20:29.780]  but she is
[20:30.700 --> 20:32.500]  somebody who, you know, she
[20:32.500 --> 20:34.300]  holds their brand together in
[20:34.300 --> 20:35.380]  ways that Ed doesn't.
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.820]  Ed is, you know, the public face of
[20:36.820 --> 20:38.100]  it, but she does a lot of the work.
[20:38.420 --> 20:39.900]  So I want to give a big shout out to
[20:39.900 --> 20:41.020]  Jane. She's amazing.
[20:41.860 --> 20:43.980]  And also Kim
[20:43.980 --> 20:45.900]  Cannoli, Kimberly Cannoli,
[20:46.940 --> 20:47.980]  Frenchie's wife.
[20:49.300 --> 20:50.820]  You know, Frenchie passed earlier
[20:50.860 --> 20:52.260]  this year. It's really sad, but
[20:52.260 --> 20:53.780]  she's carrying his legacy on.
[20:54.500 --> 20:56.300]  And, you know, I would love to have
[20:56.300 --> 20:57.820]  her on the show to kind of talk
[20:57.820 --> 20:59.220]  about his legacy and
[20:59.860 --> 21:00.860]  talk about.
[21:02.500 --> 21:04.060]  The Facebook page that she's
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.540]  carried on, I follow their Facebook
[21:05.540 --> 21:06.780]  page pretty religiously, and I
[21:06.780 --> 21:08.300]  think there's a lot of amazing stuff
[21:08.300 --> 21:09.140]  on there.
[21:09.140 --> 21:10.140]  So you guys should
[21:11.020 --> 21:13.060]  be checking it out on Facebook.
[21:15.180 --> 21:16.660]  But yeah, let's see.
[21:18.180 --> 21:19.300]  That's actually a great one.
[21:19.700 --> 21:21.860]  She really took the reins over
[21:21.860 --> 21:23.540]  like the moment that I take over.
[21:23.540 --> 21:25.180]  I'm like pretty I'm in about one
[21:25.180 --> 21:26.620]  hundred and thirty groups and
[21:26.620 --> 21:28.980]  faith and all together in Facebook
[21:28.980 --> 21:30.300]  and Frenchie Cannoli,
[21:31.020 --> 21:32.780]  Frenchie's Cannoli page was like
[21:33.100 --> 21:34.860]  the top one of my top groups go to.
[21:34.860 --> 21:35.940]  They always have such a beautiful
[21:35.940 --> 21:37.220]  thing and they managed to carry it
[21:37.220 --> 21:38.380]  on so smoothly
[21:39.060 --> 21:40.540]  and have everything really nice.
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.420]  So I'm going to pull up that group
[21:42.420 --> 21:43.860]  so that people can see that into the
[21:43.860 --> 21:45.140]  chat and join that one, because I
[21:45.140 --> 21:46.500]  think they're doing a lot of
[21:46.500 --> 21:47.700]  education there and helping out a
[21:47.700 --> 21:48.700]  lot of people.
[21:48.820 --> 21:50.460]  Yeah, there's a lot of education and
[21:51.460 --> 21:52.380]  amazing stuff.
[21:52.380 --> 21:53.860]  And I mean, a lot of it's community
[21:53.860 --> 21:55.340]  and I love that community based.
[21:55.340 --> 21:57.060]  It's not about selling any products.
[21:57.060 --> 21:58.740]  It's about giving good information.
[21:58.740 --> 22:00.620]  And, you know, I think that
[22:00.620 --> 22:02.700]  that's Frenchie's legacy is passing
[22:02.700 --> 22:03.940]  on the information and sharing the
[22:03.940 --> 22:04.940]  information.
[22:05.740 --> 22:06.620]  She does a great job.
[22:06.620 --> 22:08.220]  I see Soul Seeker 311.
[22:08.220 --> 22:09.900]  He says, why does everyone ask James
[22:09.900 --> 22:11.340]  about cat piss? Is he supposed to be
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.340]  the cat piss king?
[22:12.340 --> 22:13.780]  No, I'm the dude in search of the
[22:13.780 --> 22:14.620]  cat piss.
[22:14.620 --> 22:16.140]  And I have yet to find
[22:16.860 --> 22:17.860]  the true cat piss.
[22:18.420 --> 22:19.660]  There's a lot of people claiming,
[22:19.660 --> 22:21.140]  you know, we got SoCal cat piss and
[22:21.140 --> 22:21.980]  NorCal cat piss.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.980]  There's a guy named Tom.
[22:23.340 --> 22:24.900]  He created the SoCal cat piss.
[22:24.900 --> 22:26.180]  I totally believe that.
[22:26.780 --> 22:28.620]  But NorCal, we still,
[22:28.620 --> 22:30.020]  you know, we don't have proof or
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.420]  evidence. I've seen some stuff that's
[22:31.420 --> 22:32.780]  really pissy,
[22:33.420 --> 22:35.340]  but I have yet to see
[22:35.340 --> 22:37.460]  what I would consider is actual
[22:37.460 --> 22:38.260]  cat piss.
[22:38.260 --> 22:39.260]  And it may just be gone.
[22:39.900 --> 22:41.740]  But, you know, I remember cat piss.
[22:41.740 --> 22:42.660]  I have friends.
[22:42.660 --> 22:43.820]  We're going to do another cat piss
[22:43.820 --> 22:44.820]  episode.
[22:45.540 --> 22:46.860]  Old School Chronic got the fire
[22:46.860 --> 22:48.900]  cat piss. I haven't seen his actual
[22:48.900 --> 22:50.060]  piss. I'm going to go down to San
[22:50.060 --> 22:51.420]  Diego, check him out again, because
[22:51.420 --> 22:52.900]  I went by. He had some good fire, for
[22:52.900 --> 22:53.900]  sure.
[22:54.220 --> 22:55.220]  And he also had a
[22:56.140 --> 22:57.820]  super silver cat piss, which,
[22:58.020 --> 22:59.900]  you know, I from my
[22:59.900 --> 23:01.260]  understanding of the cat piss that I
[23:01.260 --> 23:03.500]  remember, it was more of a sativa.
[23:03.860 --> 23:05.940]  Yet 707's got an indica,
[23:05.940 --> 23:08.260]  which he's shared with Archive
[23:08.260 --> 23:09.020]  and other people.
[23:09.020 --> 23:10.100]  And that's pissy as well.
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.580]  But, you know,
[23:12.940 --> 23:14.740]  I just I'd love to see
[23:14.740 --> 23:16.500]  the real cat piss from the 90s and
[23:16.580 --> 23:17.580]  early 2000s.
[23:17.980 --> 23:19.620]  Who's a you know, who knows?
[23:20.220 --> 23:21.620]  There is a cat piss super silver
[23:21.620 --> 23:23.780]  haze, you know, but is that the real
[23:23.780 --> 23:24.860]  cat piss that I remember?
[23:24.860 --> 23:25.860]  I don't know.
[23:26.660 --> 23:27.660]  Carlos Escobar.
[23:28.140 --> 23:30.180]  Carlos Escobar is also the name
[23:30.180 --> 23:31.540]  of a Peruvian
[23:32.340 --> 23:34.420]  judge that I
[23:34.420 --> 23:36.220]  think he's the the minister of
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.420]  Homeland Security or something like
[23:37.420 --> 23:38.860]  that. It's funny that we got someone
[23:38.860 --> 23:40.540]  named Carlos Escobar in the chat.
[23:43.260 --> 23:44.260]  Someone said there.
[23:44.580 --> 23:45.900]  It's funny. My new strain is going to
[23:45.900 --> 23:46.900]  be called Betty White.
[23:46.900 --> 23:47.900]  It's an auto flower.
[23:48.060 --> 23:49.540]  White Widow with super lemon haze.
[23:49.540 --> 23:50.980]  I think everyone's doing a Betty
[23:50.980 --> 23:52.380]  White strain. My partner, Jason, has
[23:52.380 --> 23:53.420]  been working on a Betty White
[23:53.420 --> 23:55.260]  strain for a long time.
[23:55.860 --> 23:58.100]  It's wet Betty times
[23:58.420 --> 23:59.660]  gushers, I believe.
[24:00.580 --> 24:01.580]  Something like that.
[24:02.060 --> 24:03.580]  So he's had that name for a little
[24:03.580 --> 24:05.580]  bit. Now the Betty White past rest
[24:05.580 --> 24:06.580]  in peace, Betty White.
[24:07.780 --> 24:08.780]  Really sad.
[24:10.540 --> 24:11.900]  She almost made it to 100.
[24:11.900 --> 24:12.900]  I mean, actually, it's not sad.
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.900]  It's pretty amazing.
[24:14.100 --> 24:15.780]  Living 200 is pretty special, guys.
[24:16.500 --> 24:17.980]  I think people.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.260]  Really, you know, they're like, oh,
[24:21.260 --> 24:23.180]  she missed it by 17 or 18
[24:23.180 --> 24:24.620]  days, it's pretty amazing living a
[24:24.620 --> 24:25.620]  life like that.
[24:26.060 --> 24:28.420]  You know, being born in the 20s
[24:28.420 --> 24:29.620]  and coming up through everything,
[24:29.620 --> 24:31.380]  you know, you got prohibition from
[24:31.660 --> 24:33.060]  alcohol and from weed.
[24:34.420 --> 24:36.100]  So let's see.
[24:37.140 --> 24:38.700]  I mean, that's one of those weird
[24:38.700 --> 24:40.280]  things, though, like it gets really
[24:40.300 --> 24:42.260]  hard to judge because you're right.
[24:42.260 --> 24:44.180]  Right now there's going to be
[24:44.180 --> 24:45.780]  like five or six Betty Whites at
[24:46.100 --> 24:47.860]  least to hit the mainstream market.
[24:47.860 --> 24:49.220]  And all of them are probably going
[24:49.220 --> 24:50.180]  to have a fairly different
[24:50.180 --> 24:52.260]  interpretation on how it's done
[24:52.540 --> 24:53.940]  and things like catfits, like
[24:53.940 --> 24:56.060]  there's regional interpretations
[24:56.060 --> 24:56.900]  of these products.
[24:56.900 --> 24:58.180]  Sometimes I always find that
[24:58.180 --> 24:59.700]  variability makes things a little
[24:59.700 --> 25:01.500]  bit more challenging at this
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.780]  point in time in the market.
[25:03.220 --> 25:04.980]  When when everybody wants to hop on
[25:04.980 --> 25:06.500]  those name brands, do you think
[25:06.500 --> 25:07.860]  there's like I think there's a
[25:07.860 --> 25:09.140]  distinguisher somebody is going to
[25:09.140 --> 25:10.620]  drop in that this is going to be
[25:10.620 --> 25:12.100]  Betty White or do you think it's
[25:12.100 --> 25:14.140]  going to do that regionality again?
[25:14.540 --> 25:15.860]  I have no idea.
[25:15.860 --> 25:17.420]  And the thing is, is like Betty
[25:17.420 --> 25:19.340]  White is a name, not a description.
[25:19.340 --> 25:20.980]  So it's real easy to have 10
[25:20.980 --> 25:22.580]  different Betty White strains and
[25:22.580 --> 25:23.820]  all be completely different.
[25:26.850 --> 25:28.730]  So, yeah, it's just
[25:29.370 --> 25:30.490]  it's an interesting thing.
[25:30.930 --> 25:32.130]  You know, I want to go back and talk
[25:32.130 --> 25:33.970]  about my interview with Masonic
[25:34.130 --> 25:35.130]  this year.
[25:35.410 --> 25:36.650]  That was a real interesting one,
[25:36.650 --> 25:38.530]  because I honestly didn't
[25:38.530 --> 25:39.530]  know what to think. I did.
[25:39.770 --> 25:41.450]  From what I'd heard, I thought I
[25:41.450 --> 25:42.530]  wasn't going to like the guy.
[25:42.530 --> 25:43.530]  And I ended up
[25:44.490 --> 25:46.090]  talking to him and then I've hung
[25:46.090 --> 25:46.930]  out with him a couple of times
[25:46.930 --> 25:48.930]  since. But he ended up being
[25:48.930 --> 25:50.690]  an honest friggin person.
[25:50.770 --> 25:52.530]  And, you know, we need more
[25:52.530 --> 25:54.050]  honesty. So with the whole capice
[25:54.050 --> 25:54.850]  thing, I think there's a lot of
[25:54.850 --> 25:55.850]  bullshit
[25:57.490 --> 25:59.370]  and people talking
[25:59.890 --> 26:00.850]  as if they know what they're
[26:00.850 --> 26:01.850]  talking about. And
[26:03.090 --> 26:04.010]  it's a description.
[26:04.010 --> 26:05.450]  So it's really difficult because,
[26:06.330 --> 26:08.130]  you know, the NorCal was so
[26:08.130 --> 26:10.010]  pissy and so ammonia like.
[26:10.650 --> 26:12.410]  But with Masonic, going back to
[26:12.410 --> 26:13.410]  Masonic, he
[26:14.450 --> 26:15.770]  you know, he admits to being a
[26:15.770 --> 26:17.290]  pollen chucker. He admits to not
[26:17.290 --> 26:18.210]  testing his stuff out.
[26:18.210 --> 26:19.450]  I thought I was going to call him
[26:19.450 --> 26:20.210]  out.
[26:20.210 --> 26:21.170]  I don't know why I thought that.
[26:21.170 --> 26:23.050]  But on the show, when I interviewed
[26:23.050 --> 26:24.250]  him before I interviewed him, I
[26:24.250 --> 26:25.930]  thought I'm going to call him out
[26:25.930 --> 26:27.290]  on frigging being a frigging
[26:27.290 --> 26:28.130]  pollen chucker.
[26:28.130 --> 26:28.970]  That was one of the things I
[26:28.970 --> 26:29.930]  thought.
[26:29.930 --> 26:31.370]  Then he just, you know, is very
[26:31.370 --> 26:32.130]  honest about it.
[26:32.130 --> 26:33.690]  And I can really appreciate
[26:33.690 --> 26:35.690]  honesty. I think we're
[26:35.690 --> 26:37.410]  in a world where there needs
[26:37.410 --> 26:39.130]  to be more honesty and, you know,
[26:39.130 --> 26:40.410]  people, your work should be your
[26:40.410 --> 26:41.410]  bond.
[26:42.050 --> 26:43.730]  It should absolutely be your bond.
[26:44.850 --> 26:46.010]  And we don't get enough of that.
[26:46.010 --> 26:47.770]  So big shout out to Masonic
[26:47.770 --> 26:48.770]  today.
[26:48.810 --> 26:50.090]  You know, he's loved and hated by
[26:50.090 --> 26:51.090]  many, many people.
[26:51.090 --> 26:52.810]  And but, you know, you get to
[26:52.810 --> 26:54.170]  know the guy and he's he's not a
[26:54.170 --> 26:55.930]  bad guy and he's he's honest.
[26:56.290 --> 26:57.290]  That's huge.
[26:58.130 --> 26:59.850]  So let's go with
[27:05.160 --> 27:05.960]  let's see.
[27:05.960 --> 27:07.640]  Seed Company of the Year.
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.520]  What do you guys think for seed
[27:10.520 --> 27:11.520]  company of the year?
[27:14.590 --> 27:16.030]  I'm going to give it I'm going to
[27:16.030 --> 27:17.310]  give it to Compound Genetics
[27:17.830 --> 27:19.670]  for Seed Company of the Year
[27:19.670 --> 27:20.870]  for what they've done.
[27:22.230 --> 27:24.150]  I think, you know, they really,
[27:24.150 --> 27:26.070]  you know, Chris and the guys
[27:26.390 --> 27:27.630]  over in San Francisco, because
[27:27.630 --> 27:29.150]  compounds now in San Francisco,
[27:29.150 --> 27:30.190]  they've really kind of built their
[27:30.190 --> 27:32.150]  company up. And I saw
[27:32.150 --> 27:33.150]  them and I saw J.B.
[27:33.150 --> 27:34.950]  Easy over at frigging Emerald Cup
[27:34.950 --> 27:36.870]  and they have huge long line, long
[27:36.870 --> 27:37.990]  lines at their booths.
[27:39.070 --> 27:40.070]  So as far as.
[27:40.910 --> 27:42.630]  Compound, not just for the lines
[27:42.630 --> 27:43.670]  and for the height, but I feel
[27:43.670 --> 27:45.430]  like he's put together some
[27:45.430 --> 27:46.430]  really amazing lab
[27:47.270 --> 27:48.270]  genetics.
[27:48.430 --> 27:49.630]  We'll see what happens.
[27:50.150 --> 27:52.110]  We got someone, IRI Genetics.
[27:52.470 --> 27:53.950]  Shout out to IRI.
[27:56.950 --> 27:58.590]  Yeah, Compound is hype.
[27:59.190 --> 28:00.470]  You know what? Compound is hype.
[28:00.470 --> 28:01.510]  One hundred percent Compound is
[28:01.510 --> 28:03.510]  hype. But also they got the if
[28:03.510 --> 28:05.030]  they didn't have good genetics to
[28:05.030 --> 28:06.390]  back it, it wouldn't be hype.
[28:06.790 --> 28:08.190]  So as far as if you're on the
[28:08.190 --> 28:09.950]  exotic tip, you want those exotic
[28:09.950 --> 28:11.590]  genetics, Compound produces exotic
[28:11.590 --> 28:12.790]  genetics. I mean, their seeds,
[28:13.430 --> 28:14.590]  Compound for the price.
[28:14.590 --> 28:15.590]  I don't know.
[28:16.190 --> 28:17.190]  But, you know.
[28:18.270 --> 28:19.270]  What's a seed worth?
[28:19.350 --> 28:21.230]  A seed is worth as much as somebody
[28:21.230 --> 28:22.230]  will pay for it.
[28:22.790 --> 28:24.350]  You know, my quote of the year is a
[28:24.350 --> 28:26.390]  seed's value is in its use
[28:26.390 --> 28:27.710]  and not in its possession.
[28:28.470 --> 28:29.910]  And what that means is.
[28:31.430 --> 28:33.070]  If you don't use the seed, you
[28:33.070 --> 28:34.310]  might as well have a rock in its
[28:34.310 --> 28:35.310]  place.
[28:35.470 --> 28:37.150]  You know, you're going to collect
[28:37.150 --> 28:37.990]  it.
[28:37.990 --> 28:39.550]  You might as well be collecting
[28:39.870 --> 28:41.790]  things that don't get
[28:41.990 --> 28:43.550]  the real value is in that plant
[28:43.550 --> 28:44.550]  when you grow it.
[28:44.590 --> 28:45.830]  So it doesn't matter how many seeds
[28:45.830 --> 28:47.870]  you have in your collection.
[28:48.510 --> 28:49.670]  It's all about what you've
[28:49.670 --> 28:51.110]  germinated and what you've grown
[28:51.110 --> 28:52.110]  out and tested out.
[28:52.230 --> 28:53.310]  I mean, yeah, you can collect a
[28:53.310 --> 28:54.630]  bunch of stuff, but if you don't
[28:54.910 --> 28:55.910]  germinate it, it's not worth
[28:55.910 --> 28:56.910]  anything.
[28:57.350 --> 28:58.550]  And they have a shelf life.
[28:58.630 --> 29:00.390]  These seeds don't last forever and
[29:00.990 --> 29:01.830]  things change.
[29:01.830 --> 29:03.430]  I mean, I'm, you know,
[29:03.630 --> 29:04.990]  infamous for collecting seeds as
[29:04.990 --> 29:06.350]  well. And I know a lot of people
[29:06.350 --> 29:07.670]  that watch the show buy seeds and
[29:07.670 --> 29:08.670]  collect them.
[29:08.670 --> 29:09.750]  But you guys should be popping them
[29:09.750 --> 29:10.550]  more.
[29:10.550 --> 29:12.110]  You should definitely take a
[29:12.590 --> 29:14.390]  good chunk out of your year to
[29:14.390 --> 29:16.070]  do pheno hunting because the
[29:16.070 --> 29:17.150]  people that watch the show that are
[29:17.150 --> 29:18.710]  breeding, the real breeding comes
[29:18.710 --> 29:20.230]  from pheno hunting and selections.
[29:21.310 --> 29:23.230]  So a lot of plants,
[29:23.230 --> 29:24.910]  a lot of work, a lot of time, like
[29:25.190 --> 29:26.990]  this every to all
[29:26.990 --> 29:28.830]  of the breeders out there, yourself,
[29:28.830 --> 29:30.150]  including it's just like
[29:30.790 --> 29:32.270]  it takes a lot of effort and it
[29:32.590 --> 29:34.070]  takes a little bit different of a
[29:34.070 --> 29:35.990]  character and a person to to
[29:35.990 --> 29:38.230]  take on that type of a project.
[29:39.030 --> 29:40.430]  And I think it's like I just
[29:41.030 --> 29:43.030]  started my base journey and
[29:43.030 --> 29:44.710]  I think it's just an awesome,
[29:44.710 --> 29:45.710]  awesome path to go
[29:46.670 --> 29:47.670]  on. So I anybody
[29:48.590 --> 29:49.990]  that's making that effort to
[29:50.310 --> 29:51.830]  to go that distance and also is
[29:51.830 --> 29:53.030]  doing it with a little bit of
[29:53.030 --> 29:54.590]  respect towards the plant and
[29:54.790 --> 29:56.550]  and with some thought behind
[29:56.550 --> 29:57.950]  it. I don't think you should just
[29:57.950 --> 29:58.950]  do whatever the fuck.
[29:59.310 --> 30:00.950]  Well, anybody can just make seeds.
[30:00.950 --> 30:02.670]  I mean, Miss Saari said it best.
[30:03.990 --> 30:05.710]  But no, in all reality,
[30:05.710 --> 30:07.110]  anybody can make seeds.
[30:07.110 --> 30:08.510]  Making seeds isn't the difficult
[30:08.510 --> 30:10.430]  part. Selecting phenos,
[30:10.430 --> 30:12.590]  creating your own donors,
[30:12.630 --> 30:14.670]  whether it's a male or female plant
[30:14.670 --> 30:16.030]  that passes on traits
[30:16.670 --> 30:18.430]  and making good genetics that way.
[30:18.430 --> 30:20.070]  I think that's huge.
[30:22.270 --> 30:23.750]  You know, because anybody can make
[30:23.750 --> 30:25.630]  seeds, but the real magic is
[30:25.630 --> 30:27.310]  in the pheno hunting and in the
[30:27.310 --> 30:28.310]  selection.
[30:28.350 --> 30:30.430]  And you guys, the best
[30:30.430 --> 30:32.190]  cultivators make the best breeders.
[30:32.430 --> 30:34.390]  So if you're not producing
[30:34.390 --> 30:35.590]  the best and you want to go right
[30:35.590 --> 30:36.710]  into breeding, you're wasting your
[30:36.710 --> 30:37.710]  time.
[30:37.950 --> 30:39.350]  In all reality, you might make some
[30:39.350 --> 30:40.910]  money, but if this is just about
[30:40.910 --> 30:42.710]  money, there's other ways to make
[30:42.710 --> 30:44.070]  money. You can make more money doing
[30:44.070 --> 30:45.070]  other things for sure.
[30:47.230 --> 30:48.230]  Yeah, seeds.
[30:48.550 --> 30:49.870]  There's a million seed companies.
[30:49.910 --> 30:50.870]  You want to be the best.
[30:50.870 --> 30:51.990]  You want to make the best genetics,
[30:51.990 --> 30:53.190]  learn how to grow and make the plant
[30:53.190 --> 30:54.190]  express.
[30:54.310 --> 30:55.350]  Because at the end of the day, it's
[30:55.350 --> 30:56.310]  all about expression.
[30:56.310 --> 30:57.830]  So if you can't really make the
[30:57.830 --> 30:59.710]  plant express, you're not going
[30:59.710 --> 31:00.990]  to be able to see those traits that
[31:00.990 --> 31:02.550]  are desirable to select for.
[31:04.510 --> 31:06.230]  So enough on that rant,
[31:06.230 --> 31:07.230]  but best
[31:08.230 --> 31:09.230]  magazine.
[31:09.350 --> 31:10.350]  What do you guys think?
[31:11.950 --> 31:13.710]  I would say the best new
[31:13.710 --> 31:14.710]  magazine.
[31:16.510 --> 31:18.550]  Is going to be Northeast
[31:18.550 --> 31:20.510]  Leaf, Danny Danko, those guys,
[31:20.510 --> 31:21.630]  they're doing some amazing stuff,
[31:21.630 --> 31:23.430]  but my favorite magazine has
[31:23.430 --> 31:24.430]  been around for a long time is
[31:24.430 --> 31:26.070]  still Skunk Magazine.
[31:27.110 --> 31:28.310]  High Times kind of went away.
[31:28.510 --> 31:29.830]  You can't even put them together.
[31:29.830 --> 31:31.110]  Skunk is doing some interesting
[31:31.110 --> 31:32.830]  stuff and we're talking about Green
[31:32.830 --> 31:33.830]  Renaissance.
[31:33.870 --> 31:35.910]  I like their movement
[31:35.910 --> 31:36.910]  and their idea
[31:37.910 --> 31:39.710]  as far as their ideals
[31:40.270 --> 31:41.270]  for what they're doing.
[31:42.350 --> 31:43.470]  And they're good people.
[31:44.030 --> 31:45.030]  Northeast Leaf.
[31:45.550 --> 31:46.230]  Yeah.
[31:46.230 --> 31:47.070]  Twenty twenty two.
[31:47.070 --> 31:48.470]  Northeast Leaf, man, you guys got
[31:48.470 --> 31:49.350]  to check it out. But Skunk
[31:49.350 --> 31:50.350]  Magazine.
[31:51.230 --> 31:52.350]  You know, I've written in Skunk
[31:52.350 --> 31:53.350]  Magazine a bunch.
[31:53.350 --> 31:54.950]  I just I have a lot of respect for
[31:54.950 --> 31:56.950]  what they do and trying to keep
[31:56.950 --> 31:57.950]  it about quality,
[31:59.230 --> 32:00.510]  trying to keep it organic.
[32:00.550 --> 32:01.350]  They do.
[32:01.350 --> 32:02.830]  They've had issues on women in the
[32:02.830 --> 32:04.630]  industry, which I think, man,
[32:04.630 --> 32:06.230]  we could do we could do a lot more.
[32:06.310 --> 32:08.110]  I think there's some great, great
[32:08.110 --> 32:09.430]  women in the industry that have
[32:09.430 --> 32:10.710]  been kind of overlooked a little
[32:10.710 --> 32:12.510]  bit and they deserve their place
[32:12.510 --> 32:13.510]  to.
[32:14.990 --> 32:16.550]  You know, I grew up with a
[32:17.390 --> 32:19.110]  mother who was a you know.
[32:20.470 --> 32:22.350]  She was the first female
[32:22.350 --> 32:23.710]  officer of the Bank of California
[32:23.710 --> 32:24.710]  in 1969, and
[32:25.750 --> 32:27.750]  she was a president of the
[32:27.750 --> 32:28.550]  international.
[32:28.550 --> 32:29.750]  She was also a cheer decorator.
[32:29.750 --> 32:31.070]  She is the FDA
[32:31.950 --> 32:32.950]  president.
[32:33.070 --> 32:35.110]  And so she always had strong
[32:35.110 --> 32:37.110]  roles in the places she worked.
[32:37.870 --> 32:39.390]  And I feel like women have been
[32:39.390 --> 32:40.870]  undervalued. So it's great to have
[32:40.870 --> 32:41.990]  them, especially in an industry
[32:41.990 --> 32:43.150]  that's dominated by men.
[32:43.150 --> 32:45.070]  We we do have women that
[32:45.070 --> 32:45.990]  are doing amazing things.
[32:45.990 --> 32:47.110]  We do have women breeders.
[32:48.350 --> 32:49.750]  You know, I haven't been able to get
[32:50.150 --> 32:51.790]  any of them except for.
[32:53.670 --> 32:54.670]  Who did I get on the show?
[32:54.830 --> 32:55.830]  I know I got somebody.
[32:56.550 --> 32:58.510]  You guys remember that episode TGA.
[32:59.390 --> 33:00.390]  We got Miss Jill.
[33:03.550 --> 33:04.990]  And so she's breeding, but we got
[33:04.990 --> 33:05.990]  other breeders, we have other
[33:05.990 --> 33:07.270]  females, we have other female
[33:07.270 --> 33:08.550]  growers that are doing things,
[33:08.590 --> 33:09.590]  activists.
[33:11.590 --> 33:13.670]  You know, personalities,
[33:13.670 --> 33:14.670]  a lot of good stuff.
[33:16.590 --> 33:17.590]  Let's see.
[33:18.750 --> 33:20.550]  So favorite seed
[33:20.550 --> 33:22.390]  companies, you know, favorite
[33:22.390 --> 33:23.990]  Mexican seed company with Santa Rosa
[33:23.990 --> 33:25.350]  green seeds, I love those guys.
[33:25.350 --> 33:26.670]  They brought me down to Mexico to
[33:26.670 --> 33:28.510]  speak two weeks ago.
[33:28.870 --> 33:30.590]  I got some crazy food poisoning,
[33:31.150 --> 33:32.670]  but I had an amazing time.
[33:33.230 --> 33:34.710]  Like absolutely amazing time in
[33:34.710 --> 33:36.630]  Mexico and Santa Rosa green
[33:36.630 --> 33:37.950]  seeds, those guys are crushing.
[33:41.110 --> 33:42.110]  Let's see.
[33:43.270 --> 33:44.430]  What else we got, guys?
[33:45.510 --> 33:47.430]  Best organic cultivator
[33:47.430 --> 33:49.710]  and grower, just best grower
[33:49.790 --> 33:51.670]  and cultivator, this goes to
[33:51.910 --> 33:53.950]  a guy in Squim, Washington,
[33:54.510 --> 33:56.030]  Kyle Cantley, that works at
[33:56.270 --> 33:57.350]  Canada Organics.
[33:57.990 --> 33:59.750]  I would give him for twenty,
[33:59.750 --> 34:01.150]  twenty one hands down the best we
[34:01.310 --> 34:03.070]  have. Twenty one, twenty one was
[34:03.070 --> 34:04.070]  grown by Kyle.
[34:05.630 --> 34:06.630]  He is.
[34:07.350 --> 34:08.950]  You know, he's he grows in soil,
[34:08.950 --> 34:10.070]  he's a soil grower, but
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.030]  he just he grows
[34:12.790 --> 34:13.790]  better than everybody else.
[34:13.790 --> 34:15.910]  And it's it's his
[34:15.910 --> 34:16.870]  green thumb.
[34:16.870 --> 34:18.830]  It's not any one specific
[34:18.830 --> 34:20.270]  thing that he does. It's everything
[34:20.270 --> 34:21.270]  that he does.
[34:21.710 --> 34:23.350]  Brandon Rust, yet another good guy.
[34:23.350 --> 34:24.510]  I mean, there's there's a lot of
[34:24.510 --> 34:25.350]  good growers out there.
[34:25.350 --> 34:26.830]  Don't get me wrong. There's amazing,
[34:26.830 --> 34:27.910]  amazing cultivators,
[34:29.510 --> 34:30.750]  you know, house of cultivar.
[34:30.750 --> 34:32.710]  Those guys, they get, you know,
[34:32.990 --> 34:34.230]  they get a lot of credit for what
[34:34.230 --> 34:35.670]  they do with salts.
[34:36.830 --> 34:38.590]  Gabriel Farms, too, in Washington,
[34:38.590 --> 34:39.550]  they did pretty good. The house of
[34:39.550 --> 34:41.790]  cultivar as far as like metric
[34:41.790 --> 34:42.910]  and then organic.
[34:44.390 --> 34:45.670]  I spent a lot of time in Washington
[34:45.670 --> 34:46.950]  smoked a lot of their metric stuff,
[34:46.950 --> 34:48.310]  so I was like really impressed with
[34:48.310 --> 34:49.310]  the handful of brands.
[34:50.750 --> 34:52.630]  But let's see.
[34:54.990 --> 34:56.790]  Breeder of the year, what do you
[34:56.790 --> 34:57.990]  guys think for breeder of the year?
[34:57.990 --> 34:58.910]  I mean, I really want to know what
[34:58.910 --> 35:00.710]  other people think. I know what I
[35:00.710 --> 35:01.710]  know.
[35:01.790 --> 35:02.790]  And all the things
[35:03.470 --> 35:04.750]  that I know about based on my
[35:04.750 --> 35:05.990]  experience, that doesn't mean I get
[35:05.990 --> 35:07.150]  to experience everything and get to
[35:07.150 --> 35:08.430]  experience. Maybe I didn't get to
[35:08.430 --> 35:10.310]  experience the best, but this
[35:10.310 --> 35:11.870]  is all from my bubble, what I get to
[35:11.870 --> 35:13.990]  experience and what I get to see.
[35:14.550 --> 35:16.470]  And, you know, there's so many
[35:16.470 --> 35:17.470]  different people out there.
[35:18.790 --> 35:20.750]  Gabriel has that all
[35:20.750 --> 35:22.550]  cedar drying room, Gabriel is good,
[35:22.550 --> 35:23.870]  but overpriced for Rexta.
[35:25.630 --> 35:26.630]  It's funny because.
[35:27.470 --> 35:28.550]  It is really good, though,
[35:29.430 --> 35:30.470]  they're, you know, they grow the
[35:30.470 --> 35:32.110]  exotic genetic stuff, so they had a
[35:33.190 --> 35:35.070]  jigglers and I really, really like
[35:35.070 --> 35:36.150]  their jigglers. I thought it was
[35:36.150 --> 35:37.150]  amazing.
[35:39.070 --> 35:40.710]  From exotic super fire
[35:40.950 --> 35:42.510]  house, the cultivar has a friggin
[35:42.510 --> 35:44.350]  ton of stuff that they do in house,
[35:45.030 --> 35:46.830]  so, you know, and if we talk
[35:46.830 --> 35:48.150]  about California weed, I see
[35:48.150 --> 35:50.390]  collective does amazing flower.
[35:50.390 --> 35:51.390]  Those guys crush.
[35:51.470 --> 35:53.070]  But cannabis brothers,
[35:53.390 --> 35:54.590]  if you guys get into L.A.
[35:54.590 --> 35:55.630]  cannabis brothers, I don't know if
[35:55.630 --> 35:56.550]  you've heard of them or not, but
[35:56.910 --> 35:57.990]  if you're in L.A., you need to find
[35:57.990 --> 36:00.190]  this cannabis brothers cannabis.
[36:01.390 --> 36:02.990]  Yeah. Phil and Paisa.
[36:03.430 --> 36:05.430]  Those guys crush their friends
[36:05.430 --> 36:07.190]  of mine, but also they grow amazing
[36:07.190 --> 36:08.910]  strong, strong, strong weed.
[36:09.270 --> 36:10.270]  All this stuff comes out.
[36:10.950 --> 36:11.950]  You get super lit.
[36:13.590 --> 36:15.510]  So super heavy indica is mostly,
[36:15.510 --> 36:17.190]  but they do a wide variety of stuff.
[36:19.230 --> 36:21.910]  So, yeah, strongest.
[36:21.910 --> 36:22.910]  I think breeder
[36:23.950 --> 36:25.550]  of the year, what do you guys think
[36:25.870 --> 36:26.870]  we got some.
[36:29.470 --> 36:31.470]  I didn't see a lot of things,
[36:31.790 --> 36:33.190]  but I would say Dio
[36:33.950 --> 36:35.190]  Deep East Oakland for
[36:35.910 --> 36:36.910]  their Zope and RS-11
[36:37.830 --> 36:39.030]  from the previous year are
[36:40.030 --> 36:42.190]  hitters. Those two varieties,
[36:43.710 --> 36:45.350]  although they fall into the line
[36:45.590 --> 36:47.150]  of exotics and gelato,
[36:47.710 --> 36:48.710]  they're not the best.
[36:48.950 --> 36:49.950]  They're not the best.
[36:49.990 --> 36:50.990]  They're not the best.
[36:50.990 --> 36:52.990]  But I think the exotics and gelato,
[36:53.030 --> 36:55.110]  they are definitely unique
[36:55.110 --> 36:56.110]  varieties to stand on their own.
[36:57.270 --> 36:59.350]  So I think Dio's doing some amazing
[36:59.350 --> 37:01.150]  stuff down in Oakland crushing.
[37:02.870 --> 37:05.230]  You know, obviously we got JBC
[37:05.230 --> 37:07.030]  junkie and Chris from compound
[37:07.070 --> 37:08.310]  doing some amazing stuff.
[37:08.350 --> 37:09.350]  Those guys are just, you
[37:10.350 --> 37:12.110]  know, as far as popularity, I would
[37:12.110 --> 37:13.270]  say those guys are the two most
[37:13.270 --> 37:14.190]  popular right now.
[37:14.190 --> 37:16.070]  People love both those
[37:16.070 --> 37:17.550]  brands. See junkies doing amazing
[37:17.550 --> 37:19.630]  work. He's got clones, tons of it.
[37:21.990 --> 37:22.990]  Yeah.
[37:25.860 --> 37:27.740]  No Monomax for auto flowers.
[37:27.860 --> 37:28.580]  Keep getting that.
[37:28.580 --> 37:29.580]  Root beer is a hit.
[37:29.620 --> 37:31.140]  Yeah. You know, big ups with the
[37:31.140 --> 37:32.140]  root beer.
[37:32.620 --> 37:34.500]  Me and Gene, me and Gene crushing.
[37:34.500 --> 37:35.540]  He's been crushing forever.
[37:38.820 --> 37:39.940]  What was Emerald?
[37:40.380 --> 37:42.300]  Emerald Mountain Legacy is
[37:42.300 --> 37:43.300]  doing some really good.
[37:43.620 --> 37:44.460]  Like they've got some good
[37:44.460 --> 37:46.300]  heirloom work, but it's hard to say
[37:46.300 --> 37:48.260]  like what's what's going
[37:48.260 --> 37:50.060]  to be the top thing that came out
[37:50.060 --> 37:51.900]  this year when it's still
[37:51.940 --> 37:53.100]  like we're still getting the seeds
[37:53.100 --> 37:54.220]  that were produced this year.
[37:54.220 --> 37:55.580]  It's almost kind of you want to look
[37:55.580 --> 37:56.380]  a couple of years back.
[37:56.380 --> 37:57.420]  It takes a few years for these
[37:57.420 --> 37:58.700]  things to really develop in the
[37:58.700 --> 37:59.100]  market.
[37:59.100 --> 38:00.100]  It totally does.
[38:00.380 --> 38:01.780]  I mean, RS 11 has been out for a
[38:01.780 --> 38:02.780]  couple of years, I believe.
[38:02.860 --> 38:04.660]  And people still
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.100]  don't not everybody knows what it
[38:06.100 --> 38:07.380]  is. But if you're in that
[38:08.140 --> 38:09.940]  in that group of people that only
[38:09.940 --> 38:11.420]  smoke the best of the best of the
[38:11.420 --> 38:12.780]  best shit, there's only a small
[38:12.780 --> 38:13.620]  amount of it anyway.
[38:13.620 --> 38:15.500]  But it's that's that's right
[38:15.500 --> 38:16.500]  up there.
[38:17.260 --> 38:18.260]  Skunk V.A.
[38:18.260 --> 38:19.660]  Skunk V.A. has got some interesting
[38:19.660 --> 38:20.820]  shit for sure.
[38:21.540 --> 38:22.860]  He's got he's going in the
[38:22.860 --> 38:24.540]  direction of, you know,
[38:24.540 --> 38:25.860]  the chems with Lucky Dog.
[38:28.100 --> 38:29.420]  Got to love the chems.
[38:29.500 --> 38:31.140]  And I feel like gas is going
[38:31.140 --> 38:32.500]  to gas will always come back and
[38:32.500 --> 38:34.740]  gas will always be a requirement
[38:34.740 --> 38:35.820]  for cannabis, I think, moving
[38:35.820 --> 38:37.260]  forward. I mean, there's some cool
[38:37.260 --> 38:39.420]  stuff with like sweet turps
[38:39.740 --> 38:41.380]  and there's some land racy, you
[38:41.380 --> 38:43.220]  know, like musky
[38:43.220 --> 38:45.220]  varieties that I think in certain
[38:45.220 --> 38:46.380]  places will go really well.
[38:46.380 --> 38:47.380]  But for the most part.
[38:48.740 --> 38:50.660]  Skittles is not going away anytime
[38:50.740 --> 38:52.140]  soon. Skittles is now like the
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.980]  candy is just a requirement
[38:53.980 --> 38:55.620]  to you want to you want that candy
[38:55.620 --> 38:56.900]  box checked when you're doing your
[38:56.900 --> 38:58.420]  breeding work these days, it seems
[38:58.420 --> 38:59.420]  like
[39:00.580 --> 39:02.500]  gas. Candy gas is what's popular
[39:02.500 --> 39:04.100]  right now. Purple candy gas.
[39:04.980 --> 39:06.020]  Who would have thought because that
[39:06.020 --> 39:07.660]  went away in 2012.
[39:08.780 --> 39:10.700]  The only purple people wanted
[39:10.700 --> 39:12.580]  was cookies because GDP wasn't
[39:12.580 --> 39:13.580]  strong enough.
[39:14.060 --> 39:16.220]  There's like purple cat like GDP,
[39:16.220 --> 39:18.340]  grape, a those all went away
[39:18.340 --> 39:19.620]  for a while until we got back to
[39:19.660 --> 39:20.660]  gelato.
[39:21.580 --> 39:22.780]  You know, and I'm a fan of
[39:22.780 --> 39:24.340]  everything. I'm not a fan of just
[39:24.460 --> 39:25.460]  gelato.
[39:25.500 --> 39:27.340]  I'm a fan of red
[39:27.340 --> 39:28.820]  Congolese. I love land race
[39:28.820 --> 39:29.820]  varieties.
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.700]  I love Acapulco gold.
[39:34.340 --> 39:36.300]  Yeah, someone said Cap was Cap
[39:36.300 --> 39:37.580]  was definitely last year, Cap, as
[39:37.580 --> 39:39.260]  far as popularity, I would say Cap
[39:39.860 --> 39:40.860]  frigging peaked.
[39:42.180 --> 39:44.020]  I got some bode Acapulco gold
[39:44.020 --> 39:45.060]  right here, actually.
[39:45.660 --> 39:47.540]  You probably don't see work, man.
[39:47.540 --> 39:49.460]  I don't know Bode personally, just
[39:49.820 --> 39:50.500]  through friends.
[39:50.500 --> 39:51.500]  But he does.
[39:51.620 --> 39:53.420]  Yeah, he's he's crushing on
[39:53.420 --> 39:54.420]  some old school stuff.
[39:55.060 --> 39:56.740]  Yeah, I got a buddy
[39:56.740 --> 39:58.660]  that got some from him and
[39:58.660 --> 40:00.100]  took care of it. And one of the fans
[40:00.100 --> 40:02.220]  on FPC here and then sent me a bag
[40:02.220 --> 40:04.060]  of bag of that, you know, like
[40:04.100 --> 40:05.340]  proper looking ladder seats.
[40:05.340 --> 40:06.580]  I put it put a bunch down.
[40:06.580 --> 40:08.020]  I actually have an Acapulco gold
[40:08.020 --> 40:09.660]  that's like a really nice producer,
[40:09.820 --> 40:11.140]  but it's like a Barney Farms.
[40:11.860 --> 40:13.500]  So it's like it's a beautiful plan.
[40:13.500 --> 40:15.260]  And it's got it's similar, but not
[40:15.260 --> 40:16.700]  like on super on point.
[40:16.700 --> 40:18.260]  So I want to like put together
[40:18.460 --> 40:19.460]  what happens out of it.
[40:19.940 --> 40:20.940]  Nice.
[40:22.260 --> 40:23.260]  Yeah, it's always fun.
[40:24.100 --> 40:26.060]  And I think, you know, I
[40:26.060 --> 40:27.100]  think taking some of these old
[40:27.100 --> 40:28.340]  varieties and putting them with new
[40:28.340 --> 40:29.820]  varieties is going to be
[40:30.460 --> 40:31.820]  the one of the great things.
[40:32.140 --> 40:32.980]  It's funny because someone said
[40:32.980 --> 40:33.980]  sour diesel is their
[40:35.020 --> 40:36.660]  first love and sour diesel is
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.460]  something I just got back to cut out
[40:38.460 --> 40:40.460]  of tissue culture, big ups to DSG.
[40:42.420 --> 40:43.940]  And I'm going to be doing some cool
[40:43.940 --> 40:45.460]  breeding work with sours.
[40:45.740 --> 40:46.740]  I kind of mentioned a little bit
[40:46.740 --> 40:48.140]  earlier, but yeah, we have a clean
[40:48.140 --> 40:49.820]  tissue culture cut
[40:49.820 --> 40:50.620]  to work with.
[40:50.620 --> 40:52.540]  So I'm excited to
[40:53.460 --> 40:54.820]  cross that with some of the new
[40:54.820 --> 40:56.780]  stuff and some of the old stuff
[40:56.780 --> 40:57.740]  and kind of go in some different
[40:57.740 --> 40:58.740]  directions.
[40:59.780 --> 41:01.580]  I don't know what 89 is, but
[41:01.580 --> 41:02.580]  I bet it's good.
[41:04.100 --> 41:05.100]  Sounds really good.
[41:06.980 --> 41:08.180]  Cheese, people love cheese.
[41:08.980 --> 41:10.260]  I'm on the fence with cheese.
[41:10.260 --> 41:11.580]  I think cheese can be good.
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.740]  I like cheese when I go over to
[41:12.740 --> 41:13.820]  Europe, but I haven't had any
[41:13.820 --> 41:14.980]  amazing cheese over here.
[41:15.580 --> 41:17.060]  So some sour gold would be
[41:17.460 --> 41:18.460]  nice.
[41:18.460 --> 41:19.380]  That might be interesting.
[41:19.380 --> 41:21.060]  I think sour definitely grows well
[41:21.060 --> 41:22.860]  down in those tropical
[41:22.860 --> 41:25.700]  equatorial locations.
[41:27.260 --> 41:29.260]  You have like a best
[41:29.260 --> 41:31.300]  fruit of the year for last year,
[41:31.340 --> 41:32.980]  your best fruity one, maybe your
[41:32.980 --> 41:34.940]  favorite, your best skunky one,
[41:35.380 --> 41:37.100]  your best, you know, gas.
[41:37.140 --> 41:39.140]  So like what was the best
[41:39.140 --> 41:40.980]  of the regions? Because it's like,
[41:40.980 --> 41:42.140]  oh, this is the best weed I had
[41:42.140 --> 41:43.980]  last year. You know, it probably
[41:44.980 --> 41:46.500]  wasn't the best on this realm of
[41:46.500 --> 41:48.540]  flavor. I personally love
[41:48.540 --> 41:50.860]  stuff that has that like umami
[41:50.860 --> 41:52.420]  kind of paint in the back of your
[41:52.420 --> 41:53.980]  throat, like it's that richness in
[41:53.980 --> 41:54.980]  there.
[41:55.500 --> 41:56.900]  It's so hot, but it's like
[41:56.900 --> 41:58.700]  sometimes really hard to get at
[41:58.700 --> 41:59.780]  that flavor profile.
[41:59.780 --> 42:00.660]  And you're not going to get that
[42:00.660 --> 42:01.660]  with a lot of sweet stuff.
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.420]  I couldn't really give you the best
[42:03.420 --> 42:04.100]  strain of the year because it's
[42:04.100 --> 42:05.100]  been out for a couple of years,
[42:05.100 --> 42:06.900]  but it's still I love
[42:06.900 --> 42:08.100]  smoking it because it hits on
[42:08.100 --> 42:09.540]  every it's on every level.
[42:09.580 --> 42:10.540]  So it's got the gas.
[42:10.540 --> 42:12.060]  It's got the floral.
[42:13.060 --> 42:14.860]  It's got it literally checks all
[42:14.860 --> 42:16.780]  the boxes, but you know, I'm
[42:16.780 --> 42:18.620]  sitting here with jars on
[42:18.620 --> 42:19.620]  jars.
[42:20.460 --> 42:21.660]  We're talking about terpene lean
[42:21.660 --> 42:23.700]  limonene. We get this lotto
[42:23.700 --> 42:25.420]  ticket from
[42:26.180 --> 42:27.420]  Loud Canagenics
[42:27.980 --> 42:30.020]  creative grower of the year, Mr.
[42:30.020 --> 42:31.020]  Kyle Cantley.
[42:31.180 --> 42:32.700]  He's the one that made these seeds
[42:32.700 --> 42:33.700]  with our art group
[42:35.260 --> 42:37.300]  of three and
[42:37.300 --> 42:38.900]  dude crushes in this lotto ticket
[42:38.900 --> 42:40.540]  is July 41 times
[42:42.260 --> 42:43.260]  it is.
[42:43.300 --> 42:44.740]  I think it's like it is July 41
[42:44.740 --> 42:45.740]  times something.
[42:46.220 --> 42:47.740]  My brain is going away right now,
[42:47.740 --> 42:48.740]  but
[42:49.420 --> 42:50.820]  they do a rain shadow runs up
[42:50.820 --> 42:51.820]  there, too.
[42:51.860 --> 42:52.860]  So it's candy.
[42:52.860 --> 42:53.980]  I think some of those phenols, a
[42:53.980 --> 42:55.980]  rain shadow and
[42:55.980 --> 42:57.300]  a moonbow, which moonbow is a
[42:57.300 --> 42:58.300]  little older.
[42:59.100 --> 43:00.900]  Too, but it's absolutely like as
[43:00.900 --> 43:02.900]  far as candy, as
[43:02.900 --> 43:03.980]  far as melon.
[43:03.980 --> 43:05.180]  The only thing I saw melon was
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.940]  melanin a couple of years back
[43:06.980 --> 43:08.460]  that I was totally impressed with.
[43:08.460 --> 43:09.700]  I generally is good.
[43:09.740 --> 43:10.860]  It can be a little bit of a
[43:10.860 --> 43:11.860]  jelly is good.
[43:11.900 --> 43:13.020]  It can be grown correctly, but
[43:13.020 --> 43:14.820]  most of the jelly I've seen is
[43:14.820 --> 43:16.180]  either a different cut or it's not
[43:16.180 --> 43:17.180]  grown correctly.
[43:18.860 --> 43:20.180]  Someone said Big Buddha cheese.
[43:20.220 --> 43:21.980]  Yeah. Big ups to Milo from
[43:22.220 --> 43:23.380]  Big Buddha seeds.
[43:23.620 --> 43:25.340]  Big Buddha cheese was some skunk
[43:25.340 --> 43:26.100]  number one.
[43:26.100 --> 43:27.980]  That shit was that
[43:28.020 --> 43:28.780]  it was good.
[43:28.780 --> 43:30.260]  It wasn't skunky. It was cheesy as
[43:30.260 --> 43:31.620]  fuck, though, that really, really
[43:31.620 --> 43:32.620]  cheesy.
[43:35.520 --> 43:36.840]  Someone said quick crossing.
[43:36.840 --> 43:37.840]  Oh, geez.
[43:40.040 --> 43:41.440]  An adulterated OG's
[43:42.080 --> 43:43.440]  OG perfect as it is.
[43:43.600 --> 43:44.600]  I think that OG's
[43:45.520 --> 43:46.560]  should be incorporated in new
[43:46.560 --> 43:47.880]  stuff. Making a new OG.
[43:47.880 --> 43:49.120]  I mean, we already got the perfect
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.120]  OG. So making another gas
[43:51.120 --> 43:53.200]  strain, it's not got anything
[43:53.200 --> 43:53.840]  other than gas.
[43:53.840 --> 43:54.840]  Jerry Bear Otto.
[43:55.360 --> 43:56.360]  Yeah.
[43:56.400 --> 43:57.760]  Big up to Bear Grozet.
[44:00.320 --> 44:01.800]  Yeah, we got the Jerry Bear Otto
[44:01.800 --> 44:03.520]  that I made that we released a
[44:03.680 --> 44:04.960]  released. I don't know how many
[44:04.960 --> 44:06.480]  six thousand seeds, something like
[44:06.480 --> 44:08.480]  that over in New York at his event
[44:09.320 --> 44:10.520]  that we're all to
[44:12.440 --> 44:14.040]  to help out veterans.
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.880]  He had an event raising money for
[44:15.880 --> 44:18.000]  veterans watermelon.
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.360]  There's some watermelon turban
[44:19.360 --> 44:20.280]  chirps. That's for sure.
[44:20.280 --> 44:21.840]  Watermelon Skittles is pretty
[44:21.880 --> 44:23.200]  candy and watermelon.
[44:26.680 --> 44:27.760]  Jet fuel melons.
[44:27.800 --> 44:28.800]  That sounds amazing.
[44:35.320 --> 44:36.480]  This one's pretty amazing.
[44:37.680 --> 44:38.680]  Yeah, but I would do
[44:39.440 --> 44:40.920]  straight smells like Flintstone
[44:40.920 --> 44:41.920]  vitamins.
[44:42.920 --> 44:43.920]  So they
[44:44.320 --> 44:45.640]  there was an article that was
[44:45.640 --> 44:47.000]  recently released where they've
[44:47.080 --> 44:48.080]  they have.
[44:48.240 --> 44:49.520]  I mean, we're talking about under
[44:49.520 --> 44:51.480]  a thousand dollars and you can buy
[44:51.480 --> 44:53.480]  like a taste of bull screen
[44:53.520 --> 44:55.240]  like so you can like it will give
[44:55.240 --> 44:57.040]  you flavors as you're watching
[44:57.040 --> 44:58.520]  something so you can taste what
[44:58.520 --> 44:59.720]  you're what you're watching.
[44:59.720 --> 45:01.080]  It's some product that's coming
[45:01.080 --> 45:01.880]  out. I don't know.
[45:01.880 --> 45:03.360]  Maybe it's bullshit or not, but
[45:03.360 --> 45:04.640]  they need to develop the same
[45:04.640 --> 45:05.920]  thing. But for smelling for
[45:05.920 --> 45:07.800]  cannabis, it'd be like
[45:07.800 --> 45:09.000]  it'd be the greatest thing ever.
[45:09.000 --> 45:09.960]  I mean, it's like a
[45:09.960 --> 45:11.520]  it'd be like it'd be the greatest
[45:11.520 --> 45:12.520]  thing ever.
[45:12.520 --> 45:13.680]  I don't know how you would print
[45:13.680 --> 45:15.480]  that that over, but it
[45:15.480 --> 45:17.120]  makes it so hard not to dislike
[45:17.120 --> 45:18.120]  and be able to enjoy it.
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.560]  Yeah, you know, as far as sweet,
[45:23.560 --> 45:25.360]  I got a some
[45:25.360 --> 45:26.800]  grape high chew grown by can
[45:26.800 --> 45:28.000]  organics up in Washington.
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.320]  The I got it right here in front
[45:30.320 --> 45:32.240]  of me. But this stuff smells
[45:32.240 --> 45:34.160]  like straight does grape high
[45:34.160 --> 45:35.160]  chew candies.
[45:35.160 --> 45:36.920]  I mean, it and it smells just
[45:36.920 --> 45:37.920]  like that.
[45:38.920 --> 45:40.120]  And I believe it's a phenol of the
[45:40.120 --> 45:40.880]  doctor who.
[45:40.880 --> 45:42.120]  So if you're going to doctor who
[45:42.120 --> 45:43.720]  it's got that really
[45:43.720 --> 45:44.800]  amazing like the high with the
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.400]  doctor who is really
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.440]  really amazing in the sense that
[45:50.280 --> 45:51.600]  I feel like it's a really clear
[45:51.600 --> 45:53.280]  eye like it gets you can get
[45:53.280 --> 45:54.360]  super high, but you're super
[45:54.360 --> 45:55.360]  clear. It's not
[45:56.680 --> 45:57.760]  you know, you don't get too tight
[45:57.760 --> 45:58.520]  behind the eyes.
[45:58.520 --> 45:59.960]  It doesn't really set you back.
[45:59.960 --> 46:01.080]  It makes you want to go do stuff.
[46:02.120 --> 46:03.480]  And I like that, too, sometimes.
[46:03.480 --> 46:04.480]  So
[46:05.200 --> 46:07.080]  GMO is evolved into a bunch
[46:07.160 --> 46:08.320]  of shit. I don't know if you guys
[46:08.320 --> 46:10.920]  have seen the GMO, the offendo.
[46:10.960 --> 46:11.960]  There's the offendo
[46:12.960 --> 46:13.960]  GMO.
[46:14.480 --> 46:15.480]  There's all kinds of I'm smelling
[46:15.480 --> 46:16.480]  some right now, actually.
[46:17.320 --> 46:18.080]  It's good stuff.
[46:18.080 --> 46:19.080]  GMOG.
[46:21.080 --> 46:22.000]  Doctor, who was it?
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.840]  Fire doctor who was
[46:23.840 --> 46:25.080]  fire super fire.
[46:27.320 --> 46:29.000]  So, yeah, designer
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.440]  runs from exotic genetics was
[46:30.440 --> 46:31.760]  pretty good. That was the Luxor
[46:31.760 --> 46:33.160]  Rati times runs.
[46:33.160 --> 46:34.720]  You know, I just did a lot of good
[46:34.720 --> 46:36.360]  stuff. Exotic genetics, I keep
[46:36.360 --> 46:37.040]  here.
[46:37.040 --> 46:38.320]  Exotic. All this stuff looks
[46:38.320 --> 46:39.600]  amazing. I think some of it could
[46:39.600 --> 46:40.440]  have more trips in it.
[46:40.440 --> 46:41.840]  But man, his stuff looks fucking
[46:41.840 --> 46:42.840]  ridiculous.
[46:44.720 --> 46:45.760]  You know, there's a bunch of guys
[46:45.760 --> 46:46.960]  doing some amazing work.
[46:48.280 --> 46:49.520]  But yeah, exotic is up there.
[46:49.960 --> 46:51.400]  Compound stuff is terpy,
[46:52.000 --> 46:53.000]  super, super terpy.
[46:53.560 --> 46:54.680]  And I think it looks good.
[46:54.680 --> 46:55.680]  It's crisp.
[46:56.200 --> 46:58.520]  Kind of the stuff that he requires
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.280]  in his lineup. It's all about
[47:00.280 --> 47:01.280]  the terpy.
[47:01.280 --> 47:02.280]  It's all about the terpy.
[47:02.280 --> 47:03.280]  I think it's the stuff that he
[47:03.280 --> 47:04.280]  requires in his lineup.
[47:04.280 --> 47:06.000]  It's all about checking the boxes.
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.360]  You know, I had him on an interview
[47:07.360 --> 47:08.440]  and we talked about checking the
[47:08.440 --> 47:09.440]  boxes.
[47:09.440 --> 47:10.440]  It's definitely
[47:11.640 --> 47:12.760]  one of those things where it's
[47:12.760 --> 47:14.160]  like, OK, with these varieties
[47:14.160 --> 47:15.120]  that they're releasing, they're
[47:15.120 --> 47:16.320]  like, OK, does it have the right
[47:16.320 --> 47:17.560]  color? Does it have the right
[47:17.560 --> 47:18.360]  structure?
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.760]  Does it have the right terpy
[47:19.760 --> 47:21.120]  profile? When you smoke it, does it
[47:21.120 --> 47:22.720]  still taste good?
[47:22.720 --> 47:24.440]  And so they're breeding with stuff
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.320]  that checks the boxes.
[47:26.320 --> 47:27.480]  And then usually their stuff,
[47:27.480 --> 47:29.120]  they're releasing also checks
[47:29.120 --> 47:30.120]  those boxes.
[47:30.280 --> 47:31.880]  Archive, those guys crush.
[47:34.120 --> 47:35.200]  Especially that Moonbow.
[47:35.200 --> 47:36.880]  But I mean, they've done a lot of
[47:36.880 --> 47:37.800]  stuff. They've done a lot of
[47:37.800 --> 47:38.560]  interesting work.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.640]  And I mean, their flower,
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.800]  like I said, I met Adam in Mexico
[47:42.800 --> 47:43.800]  from
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.280]  Archive and he's the head of
[47:46.280 --> 47:47.280]  cultivation over there.
[47:47.280 --> 47:48.840]  And those guys, man, they produce
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.840]  some good flower.
[47:50.200 --> 47:51.320]  So you're in Portland.
[47:51.320 --> 47:52.320]  That's the one.
[47:54.720 --> 47:56.280]  So what does it mean when they talk
[47:56.280 --> 47:58.120]  about Z-Terps on Skittles?
[47:58.440 --> 48:00.080]  So Z-Terps is the description of
[48:00.080 --> 48:00.880]  the candy.
[48:00.880 --> 48:02.520]  Those Skittles Terps, because
[48:02.520 --> 48:04.680]  Skittles got it named to Zittles,
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.320]  but it's still pronounced Skittles.
[48:06.680 --> 48:08.440]  But when people talk about Z-Terps
[48:08.440 --> 48:10.240]  and stuff, like if you got a
[48:10.240 --> 48:12.400]  OZ Kush, it's got Z-Terps
[48:12.400 --> 48:13.960]  in it. Those are the candy Terps.
[48:13.960 --> 48:16.000]  The profile is that
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.680]  skittly candy smell.
[48:18.120 --> 48:19.040]  And it really does smell like
[48:19.040 --> 48:21.000]  Skittles, man. I think big
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.440]  ups to Brandon from Third Gen.
[48:22.440 --> 48:24.400]  I remember in 2014,
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.320]  I smoked some Skittles for the first
[48:27.320 --> 48:29.280]  time and man, it tasted just like
[48:29.280 --> 48:30.120]  Skittles.
[48:30.120 --> 48:31.280]  Absolutely amazing.
[48:32.680 --> 48:33.720]  And it's going to be around
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.080]  forever. I feel like Skittles is
[48:35.080 --> 48:37.080]  definitely one for the for the
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.080]  ages.
[48:39.160 --> 48:40.360]  It's being bred into a lot of
[48:40.360 --> 48:42.240]  stuff and it's
[48:42.240 --> 48:44.120]  good. I mean, the thing is, is like
[48:44.120 --> 48:45.640]  with Skittles, what I can say about
[48:45.640 --> 48:47.240]  Skittles is the average person that
[48:47.240 --> 48:49.200]  doesn't smoke cannabis, if
[48:49.200 --> 48:50.720]  you gave them a joint of Skittles,
[48:50.720 --> 48:52.000]  they'd be like, oh, this is pretty
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  good.
[48:53.040 --> 48:54.600]  You know, I mean, maybe not the
[48:54.600 --> 48:56.240]  connoisseur market always doesn't
[48:56.240 --> 48:58.160]  require it because
[48:58.160 --> 48:59.600]  we have so many other things to pick
[48:59.600 --> 49:01.680]  from. There's so many other colors
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.360]  in the scheme of things that we have
[49:03.360 --> 49:04.280]  all these other things. But the
[49:04.280 --> 49:06.240]  average person that smoked
[49:06.240 --> 49:07.480]  weed for the first time, if they
[49:07.480 --> 49:08.520]  were to smoke some Skittles, they'd
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.240]  be like, oh, we taste good.
[49:11.160 --> 49:13.240]  Because it has a very, you know,
[49:13.240 --> 49:15.400]  approachable terpene
[49:15.400 --> 49:16.400]  profile.
[49:18.360 --> 49:20.000]  Who do you think's hitting that as
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.280]  a breeder most consistently?
[49:22.840 --> 49:24.640]  Oh, Archive with their Rainbow
[49:24.640 --> 49:26.320]  belts and their Moonbow.
[49:26.320 --> 49:28.360]  And, you know, I think
[49:29.080 --> 49:30.600]  two of the groups that I work with,
[49:30.600 --> 49:32.560]  you know, with Tim
[49:32.560 --> 49:34.360]  and Kyle with Loud Canagenics and
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.520]  then also House of Cultivar,
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.080]  they both are breeding towards
[49:38.080 --> 49:40.440]  Skittles that are real skittly
[49:40.440 --> 49:41.600]  with better structure.
[49:42.280 --> 49:43.720]  And, you know, the Archive has
[49:43.720 --> 49:45.000]  definitely put it out there on the
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  market and just,
[49:46.800 --> 49:48.120]  you know, they're doing some really
[49:48.120 --> 49:49.200]  good stuff. But I think a lot of
[49:49.200 --> 49:51.120]  people have done the candy
[49:51.120 --> 49:53.280]  with their stuff. So and maybe,
[49:53.280 --> 49:54.480]  you know, it doesn't even have to be
[49:54.480 --> 49:56.200]  Skittles. I feel like anything
[49:56.200 --> 49:57.640]  from that whole Sherbert,
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.720]  you know, if you Gushers, all those
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.480]  things, there's there's candy in some
[50:02.480 --> 50:03.480]  of those varieties.
[50:06.800 --> 50:08.840]  Love it. I love biscotti, I love
[50:08.840 --> 50:10.440]  and biscotti is just another one that
[50:10.440 --> 50:11.440]  I absolutely love.
[50:11.640 --> 50:12.960]  Grown correctly if you get the right
[50:12.960 --> 50:13.960]  pheno.
[50:14.160 --> 50:15.360]  But that's another thing, you know,
[50:15.360 --> 50:17.280]  you guys, we talk about this all
[50:17.280 --> 50:18.280]  the time.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.840]  Could I find those Z-Terps in the
[50:21.840 --> 50:23.480]  juice box? For sure you can find the
[50:23.480 --> 50:24.480]  juice, yeah.
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.760]  But I'll tell you guys
[50:26.760 --> 50:28.640]  that just because somebody says
[50:29.520 --> 50:31.360]  something is something, you have
[50:31.360 --> 50:32.440]  a Sunset Sherbert.
[50:33.560 --> 50:34.920]  Unless you're verifying it, you
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.600]  don't know 100 percent, but other
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.680]  than you're taking that person's
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.560]  word because there are 10 different
[50:39.560 --> 50:41.000]  cuts of Sunset Sherbert going around.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.360]  Are you getting Sherbinsky's cut of
[50:42.360 --> 50:43.720]  Sunset Sherbert or are you just
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.760]  getting a bag seed or,
[50:45.880 --> 50:47.560]  you know, whatever of Sunset Sherbert
[50:47.560 --> 50:48.760]  or maybe not even Sunset Sherbert,
[50:48.760 --> 50:50.160]  maybe you get cookies and they're
[50:50.160 --> 50:51.360]  calling it Sunset Sherbert because
[50:51.360 --> 50:53.040]  that stuff goes on so much.
[50:55.480 --> 50:57.080]  Yeah, it's pretty funny how stuff
[50:57.080 --> 50:57.760]  gets passed around.
[50:57.760 --> 50:59.680]  And I mean, I think when
[51:01.560 --> 51:03.200]  they were doing sequencing on it
[51:03.240 --> 51:04.240]  and what's
[51:05.200 --> 51:06.680]  the company out of Portland, guys?
[51:06.880 --> 51:08.040]  It was doing sequencing.
[51:08.440 --> 51:10.440]  They got a Rob Clark
[51:10.440 --> 51:11.760]  was on the board of directors with
[51:11.760 --> 51:12.760]  Phylos.
[51:13.400 --> 51:15.080]  So Phylos had basically this
[51:15.080 --> 51:16.760]  galaxy that they were creating, but
[51:16.840 --> 51:18.120]  there was stuff in there that was
[51:18.120 --> 51:19.600]  called something and definitely
[51:19.600 --> 51:21.280]  didn't match what the name was from
[51:21.280 --> 51:22.440]  other people and they were collecting
[51:22.440 --> 51:23.520]  it from everybody. So they were just
[51:24.320 --> 51:25.320]  putting it in there.
[51:25.920 --> 51:26.920]  So Chem 91
[51:27.880 --> 51:29.360]  was all over the place, you know,
[51:29.360 --> 51:30.360]  stuff like that.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.040]  So, yeah.
[51:34.320 --> 51:36.080]  Oh, and big ups to Chad Westport.
[51:36.440 --> 51:37.520]  I have to say, Chad,
[51:38.440 --> 51:39.560]  you've come a long way since you
[51:39.560 --> 51:40.680]  started watching the chat.
[51:40.720 --> 51:42.240]  You're doing your own show.
[51:42.240 --> 51:43.800]  It's, you know, it's amazing.
[51:45.600 --> 51:46.560]  I got to get you on the show one of
[51:46.560 --> 51:47.520]  these days. We've been talking about
[51:47.520 --> 51:48.520]  it forever.
[51:53.650 --> 51:54.730]  Good people for sure.
[51:55.690 --> 51:56.930]  Passion for the sacred plant.
[51:59.490 --> 52:00.770]  Some of you guys get it and some of
[52:00.770 --> 52:02.210]  you guys don't and that's OK.
[52:06.330 --> 52:08.090]  Yeah, as far as other saints.
[52:09.170 --> 52:10.170]  See what else am I looking at?
[52:10.810 --> 52:11.810]  I got all kinds of stuff.
[52:12.210 --> 52:13.050]  You know, I don't know if you guys
[52:13.050 --> 52:14.570]  have seen Medellin from cookies.
[52:15.690 --> 52:17.170]  I got another Medellin to show you
[52:17.170 --> 52:18.170]  guys.
[52:19.810 --> 52:21.530]  I think Grateful Farms maybe
[52:21.610 --> 52:22.610]  at the Mendocino.
[52:23.570 --> 52:24.650]  These guys in their fucking
[52:24.650 --> 52:25.650]  Medellin.
[52:27.410 --> 52:28.410]  This is outdoor.
[52:29.490 --> 52:32.290]  And this is outdoor that absolutely
[52:32.290 --> 52:33.410]  has the most gassy.
[52:33.450 --> 52:34.650]  It's not colorful.
[52:35.170 --> 52:36.970]  It's not it's hype,
[52:37.010 --> 52:38.290]  but it's not hype. It's not hype in
[52:38.290 --> 52:39.290]  the sense that it doesn't have color.
[52:39.890 --> 52:41.130]  But man, it has the chirps.
[52:41.730 --> 52:43.330]  And this stuff is like straight.
[52:45.570 --> 52:47.690]  Straight gas like SFV gas
[52:47.690 --> 52:48.810]  with a similar structure.
[52:50.490 --> 52:52.210]  I hear it's a little bit easier.
[52:52.530 --> 52:53.890]  And I don't know if there's any
[52:53.890 --> 52:55.690]  viability to this, but I've heard
[52:55.690 --> 52:57.490]  that it's that a lot of the really
[52:57.490 --> 52:59.650]  gassy stuff produces
[52:59.650 --> 53:01.490]  that's outdoor to get that gas
[53:01.490 --> 53:02.370]  flavor in it.
[53:02.370 --> 53:03.850]  I don't know if there's any truth
[53:03.850 --> 53:05.330]  to that. Have you heard any?
[53:07.050 --> 53:08.770]  I mean, I mean, outdoor
[53:08.810 --> 53:10.530]  sun grown gas is amazing.
[53:11.090 --> 53:12.570]  But same thing. If you have a good
[53:12.570 --> 53:14.450]  cut of OG, you can
[53:14.450 --> 53:15.850]  grow it. You know, it's like Josh D
[53:15.850 --> 53:17.850]  was growing and it still is
[53:17.850 --> 53:19.090]  growing insurance in a bar in the
[53:19.090 --> 53:20.210]  same place I went to a couple of
[53:20.210 --> 53:22.170]  years ago. And that stuff was
[53:22.850 --> 53:24.410]  epic. But, you know, I used to grow
[53:24.410 --> 53:26.250]  OG indoors, SFV
[53:26.650 --> 53:28.450]  some of the ganja farmer OG.
[53:28.450 --> 53:30.250]  We had some different crosses and
[53:30.250 --> 53:32.130]  those all grow really well indoors
[53:32.130 --> 53:33.130]  to it's like it's
[53:34.010 --> 53:34.890]  apples and oranges.
[53:34.890 --> 53:36.730]  I mean, I love I love outdoor
[53:36.730 --> 53:38.970]  smoke just as much as I love indoor.
[53:40.850 --> 53:42.130]  You know, and I love the high from
[53:42.130 --> 53:43.090]  the outdoor stuff, too.
[53:43.090 --> 53:44.450]  So I feel like the high is almost a
[53:44.450 --> 53:45.250]  little better.
[53:45.250 --> 53:47.010]  You can get some higher chirps, I
[53:47.010 --> 53:47.850]  guess, outdoors.
[53:47.850 --> 53:49.170]  You know, that's on paper.
[53:49.170 --> 53:50.090]  Everything sounds great.
[53:50.090 --> 53:52.090]  Like but in reality, as far
[53:52.090 --> 53:54.130]  as what's better.
[53:55.290 --> 53:56.770]  Indoor still fetches a better price,
[53:56.770 --> 53:58.170]  but, you know, I love smoking out
[53:58.170 --> 53:59.290]  there every year.
[53:59.290 --> 54:01.090]  I go through the outdoor phase for
[54:01.090 --> 54:02.450]  the first couple of months where
[54:02.450 --> 54:03.810]  people have the fire outdoor and
[54:03.810 --> 54:05.530]  then I go back to my indoor.
[54:07.810 --> 54:09.410]  And then this is some it's called.
[54:11.730 --> 54:13.450]  Dog bag, I don't
[54:13.450 --> 54:14.930]  even know what the cross is, but all
[54:14.930 --> 54:16.090]  I know is this bud is.
[54:18.330 --> 54:19.650]  Kemi and Gassie.
[54:19.650 --> 54:20.650]  Yeah, you know,
[54:22.410 --> 54:24.410]  I think it's a cookie strain.
[54:24.410 --> 54:25.490]  Honestly, I think it's one of the
[54:25.490 --> 54:27.290]  new cookies once it's got a little
[54:27.290 --> 54:28.290]  floral character to.
[54:29.810 --> 54:30.810]  So it's floral.
[54:30.850 --> 54:32.570]  I mean, the gas is right up front
[54:32.570 --> 54:33.850]  and then I get the floral on the
[54:33.850 --> 54:35.570]  back end of it and it has that long
[54:35.570 --> 54:37.010]  floral finish, which.
[54:38.490 --> 54:39.930]  Yeah, it's one of those ones you
[54:39.930 --> 54:41.250]  like. I bet the extract is
[54:41.250 --> 54:42.850]  ridiculous. Zeechurch right there.
[54:42.890 --> 54:44.330]  There's some Zeechurch in there for
[54:44.330 --> 54:45.330]  sure.
[54:47.210 --> 54:48.210]  But I don't know.
[54:49.210 --> 54:51.130]  But yeah,
[54:51.850 --> 54:53.490]  and, you know, I sit around smelling
[54:53.490 --> 54:55.530]  weed all day, which is not the worst
[54:55.530 --> 54:56.650]  thing to do with your time off.
[54:57.650 --> 54:58.650]  Or time working.
[55:00.170 --> 55:01.810]  Xerios, I think Xerios is going to be
[55:01.810 --> 55:02.810]  another big one.
[55:03.130 --> 55:04.130]  That's the
[55:05.490 --> 55:07.770]  Zerbert x cereal milk.
[55:09.650 --> 55:10.770]  So you guys will hear more about
[55:10.770 --> 55:11.850]  that one. I'm doing some breeding
[55:11.850 --> 55:12.930]  stuff with it. We're going to do a
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.930]  seed release.
[55:14.850 --> 55:16.970]  Probably by April
[55:17.450 --> 55:18.610]  we'll have the seeds of that.
[55:23.850 --> 55:24.930]  So what else you guys want to talk
[55:24.930 --> 55:25.930]  about today?
[55:26.530 --> 55:28.250]  Being it's the first Sunday of the
[55:28.250 --> 55:29.250]  new year.
[55:31.050 --> 55:32.170]  What are your projections?
[55:32.210 --> 55:33.250]  What do you think is going to happen
[55:33.250 --> 55:34.930]  next year? We've talked about kind of
[55:35.330 --> 55:36.730]  what we've done, what you what your
[55:36.730 --> 55:38.090]  opinions were of last year.
[55:38.130 --> 55:39.210]  You haven't really given much of what
[55:39.210 --> 55:40.770]  you what your foresight is.
[55:40.810 --> 55:42.250]  I'm sure everybody would like to
[55:42.250 --> 55:43.450]  hear a little bit there.
[55:43.890 --> 55:46.370]  I think we're on this trajectory
[55:46.370 --> 55:48.250]  with this gelato stuff, and
[55:48.250 --> 55:49.450]  that's not really going away.
[55:49.490 --> 55:50.970]  But I feel like sour diesel.
[55:51.490 --> 55:53.010]  If somebody comes out with a sour
[55:53.010 --> 55:54.410]  diesel turd profile, that's an
[55:54.410 --> 55:55.370]  eight week variety.
[55:55.370 --> 55:57.210]  You guys, you're going to see
[55:57.210 --> 55:59.010]  a ton of that because people
[55:59.010 --> 55:59.850]  love sour diesel.
[55:59.850 --> 56:00.770]  They love the way it smells.
[56:00.810 --> 56:01.810]  They love the way it tastes.
[56:02.170 --> 56:03.610]  And if you're a real smoker, you
[56:03.610 --> 56:04.850]  love the way it makes you feel
[56:04.850 --> 56:06.330]  because it's usually a couch lock.
[56:07.250 --> 56:08.410]  You know, stuff is strong.
[56:08.450 --> 56:10.730]  And I remember my outdoor sour
[56:10.730 --> 56:12.290]  I think tested at 12 and my indoor
[56:12.290 --> 56:14.330]  tested at 14, 14
[56:14.330 --> 56:16.010]  or 16. And this was like 10 years
[56:16.010 --> 56:18.130]  ago. And that stuff would destroy
[56:18.130 --> 56:19.890]  you. And I think it's way stronger
[56:19.890 --> 56:21.370]  than any of the 30 percent stuff.
[56:21.370 --> 56:22.290]  And that has a lot to do with the
[56:22.290 --> 56:23.370]  terpene profile,
[56:25.250 --> 56:27.210]  the combination of terpenes
[56:28.010 --> 56:30.010]  and, you know,
[56:30.010 --> 56:31.010]  cannabinoids, too.
[56:33.370 --> 56:34.650]  One strain doesn't.
[56:36.570 --> 56:37.570]  Someone needs to mix.
[56:37.690 --> 56:39.490]  Carlos Escobar needs to make several
[56:39.490 --> 56:40.490]  strains to get lit.
[56:41.810 --> 56:42.810]  If you're not. Yeah.
[56:42.810 --> 56:44.090]  You know, it's like there's some
[56:44.090 --> 56:46.090]  strains like Purple Punch
[56:46.130 --> 56:47.850]  by themselves. I'm not a huge Purple
[56:47.850 --> 56:48.850]  Punch fan.
[56:49.250 --> 56:50.810]  I think it breeds well, but I don't
[56:50.810 --> 56:51.890]  like Purple Punch by itself because
[56:51.890 --> 56:52.970]  it doesn't get me high. And same
[56:52.970 --> 56:54.330]  thing with Green Crack.
[56:54.330 --> 56:55.530]  Green Crack gets you high the first
[56:55.530 --> 56:56.530]  couple of times you smoke it.
[56:57.130 --> 56:57.970]  I think that's why they call it
[56:57.970 --> 56:58.970]  crack.
[56:59.650 --> 57:00.970]  Was it got you really high the first
[57:00.970 --> 57:02.370]  couple of times you smoked it?
[57:02.370 --> 57:04.210]  And then after that, your body
[57:04.210 --> 57:05.530]  builds this tolerance to it, to where
[57:05.530 --> 57:06.930]  it doesn't get you high at all.
[57:08.130 --> 57:09.130]  Like even the first thing in the
[57:09.130 --> 57:10.130]  morning, you might feel like you're
[57:10.130 --> 57:11.490]  getting high and then it goes away.
[57:11.490 --> 57:18.110]  Any thoughts on Todd
[57:18.630 --> 57:20.150]  McCormick and Mel Frank releasing
[57:20.150 --> 57:21.550]  all these old seeds for the
[57:21.550 --> 57:23.470]  breeders, for the culture?
[57:23.470 --> 57:24.470]  I think it's great.
[57:24.550 --> 57:25.870]  I don't I don't have a problem with
[57:25.870 --> 57:26.870]  it. I don't.
[57:27.630 --> 57:29.190]  You know, my personal opinion is
[57:29.510 --> 57:30.510]  release the seeds.
[57:30.510 --> 57:31.510]  If you're not going to grow them,
[57:31.750 --> 57:33.390]  sell them, share them, give
[57:33.390 --> 57:34.990]  them away, whatever it takes to get
[57:34.990 --> 57:35.990]  them out there.
[57:37.030 --> 57:38.750]  I think that going back towards
[57:38.750 --> 57:40.670]  land-raised varieties is definitely
[57:40.670 --> 57:41.670]  important.
[57:42.790 --> 57:44.790]  And I think there's a big confusion
[57:44.790 --> 57:45.790]  on what land it may be.
[57:45.790 --> 57:46.790]  Not so much here, but just in
[57:46.790 --> 57:48.190]  general on like what land-raised.
[57:48.190 --> 57:49.550]  I think people think land-raised are
[57:49.550 --> 57:50.550]  feral.
[57:50.630 --> 57:51.630]  That's just not the case.
[57:51.630 --> 57:53.070]  Feral varieties are the ones that
[57:53.070 --> 57:54.070]  grow in in these
[57:55.070 --> 57:56.190]  climates and then they have just
[57:56.190 --> 57:57.670]  grown in and
[57:58.550 --> 57:59.830]  they haven't been guided at all.
[57:59.830 --> 58:01.230]  Whereas land-raised varieties have
[58:01.230 --> 58:03.230]  been got the
[58:03.230 --> 58:05.430]  breeding has been driven by
[58:05.950 --> 58:07.550]  necessity and by
[58:08.670 --> 58:10.070]  use. So depending on what people
[58:10.070 --> 58:11.390]  are doing with it, what they're
[58:11.390 --> 58:12.630]  looking for, the traits people are
[58:12.630 --> 58:14.390]  breeding for, specific traits,
[58:14.750 --> 58:16.030]  and who has the best land-raised
[58:17.190 --> 58:18.190]  from where?
[58:18.190 --> 58:19.710]  The best land-raised from where?
[58:19.710 --> 58:20.710]  I don't know. I think
[58:21.590 --> 58:23.230]  Africa has some amazing land-raised.
[58:23.230 --> 58:25.230]  It's like it's
[58:25.230 --> 58:26.670]  really hard to compare all these
[58:26.670 --> 58:28.150]  different things, like to say that
[58:28.670 --> 58:30.470]  it's all so subjective, like food.
[58:30.470 --> 58:31.470]  Do you like cheeseburgers?
[58:31.470 --> 58:32.470]  Do you like pizza?
[58:33.590 --> 58:34.590]  What's the best land-raised?
[58:35.110 --> 58:36.590]  You know, it's like African land-raised
[58:36.590 --> 58:37.830]  have a specific thing.
[58:37.830 --> 58:39.630]  You talk about like Colombian
[58:39.630 --> 58:40.630]  and Mexican land-raised.
[58:40.670 --> 58:42.110]  They have their own specific
[58:42.110 --> 58:43.110]  traits.
[58:43.110 --> 58:44.110]  You talk about like Colombian and
[58:44.110 --> 58:45.110]  Mexican land-raised.
[58:45.110 --> 58:46.110]  They have their own things that they
[58:46.110 --> 58:47.110]  impart and they're all good.
[58:47.110 --> 58:49.110]  Afghanistan, India, they all
[58:49.110 --> 58:50.110]  have amazing things.
[58:50.430 --> 58:52.310]  So do you like Indian food?
[58:52.310 --> 58:53.590]  Do you like Spanish food?
[58:53.590 --> 58:54.910]  Do you like it's a very,
[58:56.070 --> 58:57.870]  very subjective thing.
[58:58.070 --> 58:59.910]  Some people like pizza at the end
[58:59.910 --> 59:00.910]  of the day.
[59:00.910 --> 59:01.910]  Some people like pineapple
[59:03.070 --> 59:03.830]  on it, too.
[59:03.830 --> 59:05.310]  Yeah. Some people like pineapple and
[59:05.310 --> 59:06.630]  some people think that's disgusting.
[59:07.150 --> 59:08.590]  You know, it's like I found with the
[59:08.590 --> 59:10.670]  Red Congolese, it's an African
[59:10.710 --> 59:11.950]  land-raised variety.
[59:13.430 --> 59:15.510]  That half the people
[59:15.510 --> 59:17.110]  that I smoke it with do not like it
[59:17.110 --> 59:18.110]  at all.
[59:18.430 --> 59:19.990]  And then the other half are like, oh,
[59:19.990 --> 59:21.150]  my God, this is amazing.
[59:21.310 --> 59:22.830]  Marlon and I sit back and we smoke.
[59:22.870 --> 59:24.230]  But it's super, super strong and it's
[59:24.230 --> 59:25.230]  musky.
[59:25.350 --> 59:26.350]  Not everyone likes musk.
[59:26.390 --> 59:27.830]  Not everyone wants to smoke a cat
[59:27.830 --> 59:29.550]  piss variety, you know, but the
[59:29.550 --> 59:30.790]  people that do really love it.
[59:31.670 --> 59:32.710]  Kind of like the Grateful Dead.
[59:34.310 --> 59:35.790]  The people that like the Grateful
[59:35.790 --> 59:37.430]  Dead really like the Grateful Dead
[59:37.910 --> 59:39.070]  and the people that don't.
[59:39.350 --> 59:40.870]  A lot of them just do not like the
[59:40.870 --> 59:41.870]  Grateful Dead. That's OK.
[59:41.990 --> 59:43.630]  We live in an amazing world where all
[59:43.630 --> 59:45.750]  this stuff,
[59:45.790 --> 59:47.470]  this subjective world that we live
[59:47.830 --> 59:49.750]  in is acceptable and OK and amazing.
[59:49.790 --> 59:51.430]  I mean, diversity is so great.
[59:52.510 --> 59:53.510]  You know.
[59:53.990 --> 59:55.670]  Hopefully Afghanistan opens up to a
[59:55.670 --> 59:56.670]  free world.
[59:57.430 --> 59:58.710]  Yeah, hopefully. I agree.
[01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:01.310]  But he kill a lot.
[01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:02.710]  That's my good
[01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:04.550]  buddy.
[01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:05.990]  And he.
[01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.510]  Yeah, we went down to Hollywood Bowl.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.470]  I went to the shows down
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.470]  there.
[01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:13.510]  Interesting times.
[01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.670]  Masonic also.
[01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.470]  I think he went to his first dead
[01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:17.470]  show down there and.
[01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:20.790]  It didn't company was great, man.
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.110]  There was a question earlier that
[01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.150]  we missed that I thought would be
[01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.110]  what do you think the next the
[01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:30.030]  next or the concentrate
[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:30.790]  world?
[01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:31.590]  Do you think it's going to go
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.910]  relative in the same direction for
[01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.710]  flower as it were for concentrates?
[01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:35.750]  Or do you think it'll
[01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:37.950]  flavor profiles and such?
[01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:39.910]  I think diversity is good.
[01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:40.830]  I think they're going to have a lot
[01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:42.550]  like next year looking forward as
[01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.950]  far as like what's going to happen.
[01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.590]  People like, you know, pens are so
[01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:48.470]  big still.
[01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.830]  People want their Rosen cards
[01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.270]  or their whatever cards and they
[01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.870]  want to taste amazing like candy.
[01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:55.550]  But that, you know, right.
[01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.390]  Is this a life?
[01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.310]  So what's popular one day
[01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.070]  isn't going to be popular two months
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:01.070]  later.
[01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.990]  So but the funny thing is, is
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.310]  like it's not really that different
[01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.430]  from the one that was popular
[01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:06.430]  before.
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:10.550]  So, you know, I see all these gelato
[01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.070]  varieties is still being popular
[01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.910]  next year, but I also see some of
[01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.270]  these new interesting things coming
[01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.270]  out in carts.
[01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.510]  You know, obviously candy and
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.550]  berries and strawberry and.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.630]  Pineapple chunk, you're going to get
[01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.630]  stuff like that in extract,
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.190]  but Rosin is still just going to,
[01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.350]  you know, I feel like we've
[01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:30.510]  perfected Rosin now.
[01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.550]  We'll see if there's any new steps
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:33.710]  that people take to
[01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.110]  produce more amazing Rosin, but.
[01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:39.350]  I still like diamonds and sauce.
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.190]  So we went from shatter, caramel,
[01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:44.110]  BHO, then sifted diamonds and sauce,
[01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.830]  flowers, Rosin, people
[01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:46.830]  talk bad about
[01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:49.110]  BHO.
[01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.430]  And, you know, it's not for everybody.
[01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:52.710]  That's fine. But I think it's still a
[01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.710]  quality product.
[01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.630]  If it's done right, for sure,
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.070]  right. But there's actually a show
[01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.070]  going up on the channels
[01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.830]  that fires fire in our
[01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.830]  jail as he's a Canadian
[01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.670]  hashbrook, both not
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:09.350]  Canadian salt extractor.
[01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.310]  In Canada, there's very there's a lot
[01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.630]  of limits. We're just starting to get
[01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:13.630]  into solventless.
[01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:16.430]  And so he produces
[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.310]  some amazing product.
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.150]  And it's all about how it's done
[01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:20.470]  in the time they take and like
[01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.670]  making sure that everything's out of
[01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:22.910]  it, purging it properly.
[01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.750]  And you can get great product or bad
[01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.870]  product, just like you could get
[01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:27.030]  great product or bad product with
[01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.510]  hash. I think it's the same.
[01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:30.430]  Yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:32.150]  And the thing is, is what you lose
[01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:33.990]  with you, you do lose stuff with
[01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.790]  Rosin.
[01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:36.190]  There's water soluble terpenes
[01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:37.310]  because you're doing a water
[01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:38.150]  extraction.
[01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.790]  And those water soluble terpenes
[01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.190]  dissolve in the water and they don't
[01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.030]  come back.
[01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:43.950]  Whereas with BHA, you still get all
[01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:45.430]  those terpenes.
[01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:46.430]  Now,
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.510]  you know, I think a lot of people
[01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.670]  are harvesting terpenes, too.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.430]  That's a new thing that you can use
[01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:53.030]  everywhere. I love terpenes.
[01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:54.270]  You guys all love terpenes.
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.830]  Everybody that likes weed pretty
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:56.830]  much likes terpenes.
[01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.710]  So I think my wife are doing
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.590]  we do well, she just picked up
[01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:04.590]  the thing, but it's
[01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.470]  essential oil extractions and
[01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.910]  stuff like that. So we take so we
[01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.350]  do it. She does a whole bunch of
[01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:11.550]  she's got like the artificial
[01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.110]  terpenes and terpenes and we put
[01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:15.230]  them into creams and sauce
[01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.150]  and stuff that we give away to
[01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.430]  friends and stuff.
[01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:18.430]  It's very interesting.
[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:19.830]  You get it, especially if you get
[01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.630]  some like cannabis terpenes as well
[01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.270]  to throw. And we went to a recent
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.030]  show and got some.
[01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.110]  It was it was nice.
[01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.110]  It was nice little addition to
[01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:28.750]  those little homemade crafts and
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.510]  stuff.
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.470]  Yeah, that's pretty
[01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:32.470]  cool.
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.110]  Yeah, my partner does essential
[01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.790]  extracts. He's got fields of
[01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:38.990]  roses. He produces rose
[01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:40.990]  rose oil, rose extract, all kinds
[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.990]  of cool stuff.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.500]  Yeah, a lot of people hating
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.380]  on BHO, but BHO
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.860]  is not bad personally.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.660]  Every time it's brought up, a
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.420]  lot of people hate on the BHO.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.100]  But again, I can see
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.540]  you've had one or two bad
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:01.660]  experiences with it.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.940]  I could see it turning you off for
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.100]  a long term.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.660]  Yeah, I mean, just.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.020]  BHO crap
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.860]  in the crap, can't believe anything
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.500]  is still pushing that garbage.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.460]  Yeah, we can't all have
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.460]  the best rosin, but I have a
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.900]  little jar right here.
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.020]  That's BHO.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.020]  That's real turpy and soupy.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.900]  I love those turps and I'm not
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.020]  going to hate on them and I'm
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020]  still going to smoke them.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.860]  But, you know, it's we all choose
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.340]  what to put in our lungs or our
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.020]  bodies. And, you know, that's
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.260]  that's the beauty of it.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.860]  Genetics plays a huge role in
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.860]  that.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660]  So.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]  Yeah.
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.150]  You know, but I don't smoke that
[01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.950]  much extract, I smoke more flour
[01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.950]  than anything, I consume
[01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:47.950]  lots of flour.
[01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.230]  I got a bunch of pre-rolls that I'm
[01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:53.830]  been working on for
[01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:54.990]  twenty twenty two.
[01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.550]  You guys will see some cool pre-rolls.
[01:04:57.550 --> 01:04:58.350]  I don't know what we're going to
[01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:58.990]  name them yet.
[01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.870]  I'm working with a couple of
[01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:00.990]  friends.
[01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:03.030]  We got a Duke Diamond,
[01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.510]  some stuff from Duke Diamond.
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.510]  I got the Swazi
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:08.270]  and I got the Skush.
[01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.990]  That's Swazi.
[01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:12.750]  These seeds are going to be on
[01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.390]  seeds here now to help benefit
[01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:15.390]  Duke.
[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.350]  Those are some crosses I made
[01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.190]  maybe two years ago
[01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:22.750]  and Adam Dunn and I are releasing
[01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.750]  him as Sage Against the Machine.
[01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.190]  We already did a release and it
[01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:27.510]  was very successful earlier.
[01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.750]  And so this is just the second
[01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.750]  release of that stuff.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.350]  CRC is ruining VHO's
[01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.030]  name, I absolutely agree with that
[01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:36.030]  one hundred percent.
[01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:37.830]  You don't need to see our see the
[01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:38.670]  good stuff.
[01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.670]  You just don't.
[01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.870]  You don't need color is not as
[01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.550]  people want
[01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.670]  this light color because they want
[01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.310]  it to look like rosin, like the
[01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.390]  really the best rosin.
[01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:49.030]  But you don't color isn't that
[01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:50.910]  important. And bleach and all this
[01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:51.990]  other shit they're doing with the
[01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.110]  CRC, man, it's you know,
[01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:55.110]  I'm not a big fan.
[01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.710]  I want turps and you lose turps
[01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:58.710]  with CRC.
[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.590]  When you start changing things
[01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.990]  for anything other than just
[01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:05.870]  pulling an extract or something
[01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:07.630]  out in my mind, I think you start
[01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.590]  really compromising things.
[01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.310]  Like you start adding color or dyes
[01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.630]  like that. That's kind of what's gone
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:14.110]  wrong in my mind in the food
[01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.390]  industry in a lot of ways.
[01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:17.550]  All of a sudden it's like, hey, I
[01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.390]  got a bottle of this extract that
[01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.190]  tastes like this.
[01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.590]  And now you don't have to use
[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:22.950]  anything that tastes like that in
[01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:24.390]  your food. So now you don't have to
[01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:25.710]  get any of that in your food.
[01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:27.310]  And all that stuff carries all
[01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.470]  these other things and just
[01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:30.390]  rebound in this negative direction
[01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:31.390]  towards us.
[01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:33.230]  You know, I got a good one right
[01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:34.030]  here to show you guys.
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.830]  I don't know how clear it's going
[01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:36.830]  to come out, but.
[01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:39.230]  You see that, but right there, that
[01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.110]  right there is a nug of
[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.350]  red pop from exotic genetics.
[01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:46.390]  Here's another one.
[01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.990]  It is.
[01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:51.350]  Oh, I get closer here
[01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.470]  on backwards, but yeah, really good
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.470]  stuff.
[01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:57.230]  That was their hot Christmas drop
[01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.230]  last year, wasn't it?
[01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.270]  Or was it?
[01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:00.430]  Yeah, it was.
[01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.150]  It's really good.
[01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.190]  Done some interesting work with it,
[01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.110]  I think it imparts some really
[01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:07.790]  good characters and it's freaking
[01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.110]  it's a good it's a winner, but it's
[01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.150]  not as good as exotics.
[01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.390]  The selection that I've seen
[01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.510]  that is not as good as the
[01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:15.790]  jigglers. The jigglers is like
[01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.790]  gassy and
[01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:18.710]  pretty amazing.
[01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.870]  Now, Pluto right here and
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:23.430]  carbon fiber, if you guys know
[01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.830]  carbon fiber, that's some fire,
[01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:26.750]  really good stuff.
[01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.150]  So what else, guys?
[01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:33.910]  What hits stronger than your exotic
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.910]  genes or that?
[01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:36.630]  What hits stronger?
[01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:38.590]  Did you want to go smoke
[01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.110]  some of the red Congolese by gold
[01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:40.990]  seal? You can buy it.
[01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.790]  It's in license.
[01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:43.030]  It's in San Francisco,
[01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:44.390]  all over the place.
[01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:45.830]  Look at gold seal SF.
[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:47.950]  That red Congolese will fuck you
[01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:49.310]  up. It's going to it's a game
[01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.550]  changer. If you want something
[01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:51.990]  that's strong, it's going to you
[01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.830]  know, it's it's the high, but it's
[01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.950]  a sativa that equatorial
[01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:57.910]  type of high that just, you know.
[01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:01.030]  You get paranoia
[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:02.030]  and you get, you know.
[01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:04.030]  Yeah, it's
[01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:05.030]  exactly like that.
[01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.350]  You can get the same effect from
[01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:08.150]  drinking like two pots of coffee
[01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.510]  and smoking a couple
[01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:10.510]  bongers.
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.590]  But yeah, it makes sense, I think
[01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.070]  blending to, you know, people,
[01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.950]  I would love to see some really top
[01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:18.310]  brands start blending their
[01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.830]  varieties in joints.
[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.550]  So where they take like 50,
[01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.110]  50 of this and that and you have
[01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:24.510]  some amazing smoke that you can't
[01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:25.510]  get anywhere else.
[01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:27.350]  You know, talking about, you know,
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:28.390]  the
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.790]  the the the the the the
[01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.190]  the the the the the the the the
[01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:32.190]  talking about same
[01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:34.790]  thing with outdoor terroir.
[01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:35.910]  I think it's something we've talked
[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:37.630]  about. We keep going away from and
[01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.150]  we will be coming back to
[01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:40.830]  because I really
[01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.950]  feel like most people do not
[01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:46.150]  get to appreciate
[01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:47.990]  the best quality outdoor.
[01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.390]  And if they did, they would they
[01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.350]  would want to buy outdoor,
[01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:52.590]  especially because it's cheaper,
[01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:54.590]  although it's not that much cheaper
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:55.590]  for the best shit.
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:57.790]  But, you know, it's like some of the
[01:08:57.790 --> 01:08:58.790]  best outdoor.
[01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.790]  It's just it's mind blowing.
[01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:02.190]  The quality of some of the stuff
[01:09:02.190 --> 01:09:03.510]  that these farms are producing.
[01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.030]  It's just ridiculous for outdoor.
[01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:07.790]  And it's significantly less
[01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:08.790]  than the best indoor house.
[01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.030]  I think that's an interesting point.
[01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:12.710]  And you talked about a bit earlier
[01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:14.030]  about how some strains like they
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.270]  make sure you will. And I've noticed
[01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:16.910]  that, too, that there's been one or
[01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:18.310]  two that I've grown that like on
[01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:19.390]  their own don't taste great.
[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.790]  But you can like they're literally
[01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.230]  like almost like salt.
[01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:23.830]  You can throw them in a bowl and
[01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:25.510]  they take whatever whatever is
[01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:27.110]  already there and just boost it a
[01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:28.110]  little bit more.
[01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:29.630]  I found that interesting.
[01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.430]  Have you seen their experience,
[01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.430]  anything kind of like that?
[01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:35.430]  Yeah, sure.
[01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:39.750]  But yeah.
[01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.110]  So James doesn't like
[01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:44.430]  answering questions about his male
[01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.430]  plants.
[01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:46.830]  What do you want to know about male
[01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:47.830]  plants?
[01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.870]  I don't know. We got this big
[01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.110]  question board, so I might be
[01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:52.150]  missing some questions, but I
[01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:53.350]  think I saw that one earlier.
[01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:55.470]  He was asking how long you keep
[01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.030]  a male plant around.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.950]  Sorry, I didn't bring that one up.
[01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:00.910]  Oh, yeah. No, that's OK.
[01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.030]  Yeah. I mean, I think five years is
[01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:04.150]  the longest I've kept them.
[01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.270]  But some of these guys have kept
[01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.270]  them a lot longer than that.
[01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.910]  You know, they're still sometimes
[01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:12.190]  they will automatically start
[01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:13.190]  going into flower.
[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:15.190]  I mean, you have to take clones
[01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:16.830]  and then, you know, clones and
[01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:18.910]  clone your males.
[01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.590]  I think there's a lot of people that
[01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.270]  keep their their males alive in
[01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.270]  clone form.
[01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.190]  I think there's nothing wrong with
[01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:26.350]  that. But also,
[01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:28.910]  doing your selections and then using
[01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.190]  them and then, you know, I'm working
[01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:31.870]  mostly with feminized stuff now, so
[01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:33.190]  I'm not working with a lot of males
[01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:34.350]  like I used to. I still do.
[01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:35.790]  So I get one project over the
[01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:37.310]  summer. So I selected from,
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:39.430]  you know, 20 different males and
[01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:40.990]  that's it. That's all I did this
[01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:42.950]  year for regular breeding.
[01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:45.230]  So some sage and
[01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.950]  sour male use for the first job.
[01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.910]  OK, so with the sage and sour, this
[01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.430]  is a great one. So this is
[01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:52.790]  something that you guys can if you
[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.230]  guys do regular breeding, this is a
[01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:56.350]  great tip for making F1 varietals.
[01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.470]  If you're doing, you
[01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:00.590]  know, complex polyhybrid
[01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.590]  F1s like most people.
[01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.990]  But if you take two varieties,
[01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.030]  right, and you want the most amount
[01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.070]  of diversity in the seed population,
[01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.630]  you increase the amount of males
[01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:11.630]  that you're using.
[01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:13.990]  You have that female,
[01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:15.950]  you have that the donor, right?
[01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:16.870]  So you put the donor.
[01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.630]  You basically what I did, I select
[01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:20.510]  for three different things with that
[01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:21.510]  sage and sour.
[01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:22.550]  So
[01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:25.590]  that sage and sour was amazing.
[01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:27.350]  So sage and sour is sour diesel
[01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.430]  times sage
[01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.270]  and sage is big sir
[01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:32.470]  holy times OG.
[01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:34.430]  And so there's a lot of diversity in
[01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:35.950]  there already. So what I did is I
[01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:37.870]  selected one for the gassy
[01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:39.590]  kind of OG nose.
[01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.030]  I selected a tall one
[01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:43.590]  that definitely represented the
[01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.350]  haze and the sour.
[01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.070]  And I like the structure on that.
[01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.630]  And then I selected a shorter one.
[01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:51.230]  And the idea was, is with all that
[01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:53.110]  pollen going in the room, you were
[01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:54.190]  going to get the most amount of
[01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:55.230]  diversity with seeds.
[01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.350]  So we had three donors
[01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:59.230]  going into the receiver.
[01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.150]  And, you know, with
[01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:02.950]  all those and then there were
[01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:05.110]  specific receivers for stuff
[01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:06.510]  I like, popular stuff and
[01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.310]  interesting stuff like Duke Diamond
[01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.030]  stuff, this way, this
[01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:11.310]  is the one eight seven.
[01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.910]  We did we call that killing in the
[01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:14.750]  name of we released that with the
[01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:15.990]  sage against the machine released
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.990]  previously.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.140]  Sage is
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580]  BSHW times Afghani
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.580]  not OG.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.460]  The true sage, Big Sur,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.820]  holy times Afghani.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.620]  Now, I'm pretty sure it's times
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.740]  Josh D.O.G.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.060]  I'm not 100 percent right now.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.540]  You say you're saying it's not OG
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.140]  and it's Afghani, but I'm pretty
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.140]  sure.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.140]  Pretty sure, not 100 percent,
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.340]  but Sativa Afghani genetic
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.980]  equilibrium is what it stands for,
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.740]  but I'm pretty sure it's
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.820]  from the Josh D.O.G.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.820]  times the Big Sur holy
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.020]  we can we can verify
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.980]  that right now.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.980]  You guys want me to call somebody?
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.460]  Yes, please.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.460]  Let's see.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.420]  We can call the breeder right now
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.420]  and ask him.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.900]  His name is Mojave Richmond.
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.100]  We'll see if he picks up.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.700]  I said we're going to call people.
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:15.820]  We should just start calling people
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.740]  on my phone and see what we get.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.380]  I love the sound of that.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.420]  That sounds like a good time.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:39.300]  OK, well, Mojave is not picking
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.780]  up. He has kids and so I get it.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.340]  We're going to call Adam Dunn now.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.540]  Let's call Adam.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.980]  Because he.
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.660]  Worked on that with him.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:54.500]  Chad is absolutely loving it.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.580]  Yeah, we're just going to go
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.860]  through people my phone and call and
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.460]  see who picks up, not knowing that
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.460]  they're going to be on the show.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:04.220]  I think Jerry Springer does a segment
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.900]  like that where he calls like, can
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.660]  you call someone famous and like
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.060]  call the most famous person on your
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.060]  phone and see if they pick up?
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.060]  I think it's.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.580]  Yeah, Eric Andre did a whole comedy
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.100]  show around calling people from the
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.420]  audience, calling their mothers.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.660]  I got to hear my phone.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:25.180]  Just leave a message. I'll get back
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180]  to you.
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.580]  The mailbox is full and cannot
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.980]  accept any messages at this time.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.540]  Yeah, that's Adam for you.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.860]  OK, so I'm pretty sure
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.020]  I'm like 90 percent sure it's Josh
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.860]  Deezo G cut that he used for the
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.860]  Sage.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.380]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Josh
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.380]  Deezo G cut.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.900]  He used for the Sage.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.540]  That was a big thing back then.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.540]  So let's see.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.700]  Only downsides, donors don't answer.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:52.820]  They want to hear the message.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:54.900]  Now, they don't ever hear the
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.260]  message. Most of my friends respond
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.260]  to text message only.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.140]  Let's see, who else should we call?
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.380]  We're going through here.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.900]  You can call somebody.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.180]  Let's call somebody I don't know
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180]  really well.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.340]  See if that.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.860]  You know, I bet it'll pick up if we
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:15.860]  go ahead.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.220]  I got so many people on my phone, I
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.700]  think there's five thousand people
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.020]  here, five thousand numbers.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.420]  Oh, you know, breeder, upcoming
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.620]  breeders to look out for.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.420]  I think Jason
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.420]  House of Cultivar.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.660]  He's doing some amazing stuff with
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.660]  him. I think he's a big guy to look
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.140]  out for this next year.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.740]  Brooksy Buds on Instagram.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.020]  Brooksy is doing some breeding
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.060]  and the best growers
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.140]  make the best breeders.
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.740]  A firm believer in that the best
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.220]  breeders make the best growers.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.940]  Brooksy is both.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.340]  I believe his genetics are going to
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.780]  be ridiculous because his female
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.180]  hunting skills are amazing.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.660]  So big shout out to Brooksy.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.980]  He's a good friend we met years ago
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:08.980]  at.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.300]  At the Cup in Denver.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.100]  Hmm.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.100]  Let's see.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.180]  And I got a million people in here.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.380]  Who do you guys want me to call?
[01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:36.890]  Should we call Ed?
[01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.730]  Pistachio asked, what about calling
[01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:44.970]  Soul Rebel Collective?
[01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:46.010]  Call Chad.
[01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.330]  Hi, Huntress.
[01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.130]  Dude, I got lots of chats we could
[01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.130]  call.
[01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.690]  We could call Soma, too.
[01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:57.810]  Let's see if Ed picks up.
[01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:09.510]  Hey, Ed, how you doing?
[01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.630]  I'm doing good, man.
[01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.790]  I got you. You're live on the James
[01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:16.710]  Loud show and these guys
[01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:17.870]  had some questions for you.
[01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:19.790]  OK.
[01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.870]  Awesome.
[01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.870]  What do you guys want to ask Ed?
[01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.750]  Send your questions right now.
[01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:26.590]  Ed, what's your favorite strain?
[01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.990]  It's a proprietary strain, J27.
[01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.990]  J27, proprietary strain.
[01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:39.750]  It was down to one.
[01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.790]  It's an old strain.
[01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:43.430]  It was down to one plant.
[01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.270]  And I'm
[01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:48.230]  working with Humboldt Seed Company
[01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:50.190]  to bring it back.
[01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:51.870]  Bring it back.
[01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:52.430]  Awesome.
[01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.510]  They have it right now.
[01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:56.870]  What is what's the best way to
[01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:57.870]  germinate seeds?
[01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:01.310]  Well, I know that a lot
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:03.190]  of people like to germinate them
[01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:04.910]  in tissue or
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.620]  medium, but I actually like
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.700]  to germinate seed
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.140]  in a
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.700]  sterile medium, such
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.700]  as a planting mix
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940]  or
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.220]  oasis or rockwool
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.340]  or something like that.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.820]  And the reason for that
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820]  is that I find
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.100]  that sometimes in
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.460]  transplanting seeds
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.460]  that have started to
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.020]  germinate, the root tip
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.380]  is injured.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.060]  And by planting it in place,
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.260]  you don't have that injury.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.700]  Nice.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.340]  What's the craziest place you've
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.580]  been to on Earth that grows
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:46.580]  cannabis?
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.520]  Craziest place.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.160]  The craziest place.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.200]  Well.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.640]  Morocco?
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.480]  Well, you know, Morocco isn't
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.120]  crazy. It's very it's
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240]  it's like a stable
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.120]  tribal area.
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.240]  Yeah. In Morocco, Katama.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.560]  But I enjoy.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640]  Well, how about
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.480]  most dangerous?
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.640]  The craziest was Lesotho,
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.600]  which is an
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.280]  independent kingdom inside
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.680]  of South Africa.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.680]  And it was just
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640]  kind of chaotic
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.160]  there in terms of cannabis.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.520]  Nice.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.200]  What's the most embarrassing thing
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.160]  that's happened to you when you
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.160]  were high?
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.200]  Most embarrassing.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.560]  I really can't think of
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.160]  my mind doesn't think like that.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.840]  So what else we got, guys?
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.440]  Someone said Ed Rosen's all super,
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.280]  but I think they like that one.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.320]  Yeah, that is super.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.440]  But it's really an interesting
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440]  plant.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.240]  I gave
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.560]  Neville some seeds
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.040]  of this plant, of these plants
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.040]  that were very,
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.240]  very strong, but did not
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.240]  produce.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.840]  It did not produce type, but
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.400]  they produced very loose
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.160]  buds, especially if
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.040]  they, you know, under the light,
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.480]  especially not when they're not
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480]  grown in equatorial light.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200]  So and
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.480]  so
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.480]  nothing came of them for a long
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.640]  time. And then Sensi,
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.520]  which took over Neville's
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.720]  seed collection, they
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.920]  took those seeds and
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.800]  over a period of years just
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.800]  kept adding
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.240]  and adjusting it
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.240]  and then came out with the super
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.960]  bud. And the thing about the super
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.480]  bud, I mean, it's a very, very
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480]  pleasant type.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.920]  But one of the main
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.880]  advantages of growing it
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  is that it
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.360]  matures early in the season
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.960]  so that
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.400]  in the in the, you
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.440]  know, Northern California, it
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440]  will come in in mid
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.040]  September before
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.640]  the bad weather comes in.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.760]  So you always get a harvest out of
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.320]  it. You don't have to worry about
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.080]  what's going to happen in October.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]  Hey, so.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.160]  So that has a lot of advantages.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.720]  And when you grow it,
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.120]  you know, under,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.440]  nearer to the equator,
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.160]  it will basically
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.480]  flower very, very early,
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.280]  unless you give it, you know,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.280]  additional light so you can really
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.480]  adjust when the harvest comes in.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]  Yeah, totally.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.800]  So we got a question that they've
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800]  been asking about skunk.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.160]  And I feel like you and I have had
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.560]  this conversation quite a bit
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.480]  about the old, you know, like
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]  the roadkill skunk.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.840]  What's your opinion on that?
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.840]  Where is it gone?
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.040]  What's what's the deal?
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.280]  Well, you don't you don't see it
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.840]  around very much anymore.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.600]  And I don't see it at all.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.320]  I have yet to see the real, you know,
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.280]  that stuff, because we've talked
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.560]  about the stuff in the 90s where
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.800]  you'd have a tenth of a gram in your
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800]  whole house.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.880]  And your whole house would smell like
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.520]  it.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.160]  Yeah.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]  That stuff's not here.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400]  It doesn't exist.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.040]  Well, I think it does.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.760]  I mean, I think if we go back to
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.840]  some of those old varieties,
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.040]  that that
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.160]  you'll get that.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.160]  And I,
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.440]  you know, you know,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.760]  there's a company called Landrace
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.840]  Seed Company.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.240]  And the fellow who runs
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.680]  that company, Fritz, was actually
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.600]  at the Emerald Cup
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360]  a few weeks ago.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]  Yeah.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.240]  And I picked up
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.280]  quite a few different varieties
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.280]  from him.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.760]  And then you saw these Indian.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.880]  These were from India.
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.280]  And I think they're the
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.720]  progenitors of the Jamaicans,
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.160]  of the Jamaican varieties.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.560]  I think that
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.560]  if they're not progenitors,
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560]  they're close to the
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.920]  progenitors, because,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  you know,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.480]  when you go down to Jamaica,
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.800]  the terms that are used in Jamaica
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.880]  for cannabis are
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.720]  like, there are terms like
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.080]  ganja and collyweed.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.480]  And Colly is the
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.200]  Indian goddess of death
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200]  and destruction.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.480]  She's depicted wearing a necklace
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.880]  of heads.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.760]  And so that
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.560]  would be the equivalent of
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.560]  killer weed.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.600]  And so you like collyweed,
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.840]  killer weed.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.800]  And the reason, not that the
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.240]  terms sound similar,
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.080]  but colly being, you
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.840]  know, associated with
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.880]  death and destruction.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.480]  So, you know, you hear the
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.520]  term killer weed and there it is.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.040]  And only in India, only
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.840]  using an Indian term.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.160]  So all of a lot of the terms
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.840]  used for killing
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.880]  for traditionally used for
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.200]  cannabis in Jamaica
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.600]  are Indian.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.320]  I think that they, that
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.440]  Jamaican weed came from Indian
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.720]  land races.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.160]  And I think that you might
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.240]  get that that skunk smell
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.240]  from that and also from
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.240]  the Afghanis.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.720]  And I think that they're original
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.560]  Afghanis like Afghani One.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.680]  And I think that
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.920]  I think that those seeds are still
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.520]  when I say they're still
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  available.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.160]  I should say that they still
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.280]  exist and that companies
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.200]  like Fancy and others
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.040]  that have an extensive library
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.520]  probably have them
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  in there.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]  You know.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.640]  I feel like so many people growing
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:14.760]  cannabis, though, you would be
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.960]  seeing more of those.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.080]  There's several things and I think
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.240]  there's a confusion, too, but
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.680]  skunk is not the same thing as
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.080]  gas. They're both phials.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.680]  Same thing with ammonia.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.680]  It's a phial, not a terpene.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]  But I'm not seeing
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.440]  them pop up like they used to.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.120]  You know, these things used to hit.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.880]  And groupy growing
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.000]  methods, it could be sexual
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.240]  maturity of these plants.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.720]  Yeah, an old school chronic has
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.160]  grown some Kentucky skunks and
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.000]  other skunks, but
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.200]  yet to see the real skunk.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.680]  You know, it's like another one of
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.880]  those ones. I'd love to do a show
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.960]  on it once we find it.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480]  But thank you for
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.960]  coming on. I really appreciate it.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.320]  One thing about those skunks
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.520]  that you're talking about, you
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.840]  know, that you're going to find
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.080]  them in old Afghanis.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.680]  Yeah, that's where
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440]  that's probably
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.720]  where most of them will come from.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.320]  And I do.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.600]  I do think those seeds exist
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.440]  in people's libraries.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.560]  The seeds are there, but let's find
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  them.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600]  I'd love to see it.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:26.800]  The two of us.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.640]  Let's do it.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640]  Yeah.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.560]  OK, well, thank you for having me
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560]  on your show.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.200]  Fantastic.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.200]  And I'll talk to you soon.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.680]  Have a great trip down to Mexico.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.920]  You know what? That has been
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920]  canceled.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]  Oh, bummer.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.520]  You know,
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.120]  I think that the whole show is
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.120]  canceled now.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.200]  Well, it is what it is.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560]  Yeah.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.760]  Saves lives.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.760]  Yeah. You know, I agree with that.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.800]  OK, Ed, we'll have a wonderful
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.160]  weekend and maybe I'll see you next
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.160]  week.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.600]  OK, sounds great.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.680]  OK, take care.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.120]  That was Ed, guys, and
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.000]  listen to Ed, you know, he's always
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  got something to say.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.280]  He's always got interesting stuff
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  to say.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.400]  So
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.480]  Quintino
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.200]  Power is at, I'm
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680]  sorry if I'm butchering your name.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.440]  Which email address do we send the
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.160]  receipt for the fire beans?
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:26.960]  Thanks.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.480]  You're going to go to JamesLabGenetics
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  at gmail.com.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.440]  Send your copy.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.630]  I will also put that into the
[01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:41.310]  description after the show.
[01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:42.630]  I can't do it during the show, but
[01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:43.990]  I'll put it in the description after
[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:45.390]  the show as well. So it's there for
[01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:47.190]  everybody to hop onto.
[01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.990]  If you'd like.
[01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.110]  Good stuff, guys.
[01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:54.110]  How about we call Leo from
[01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:55.110]  Aficionado?
[01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:56.630]  Yeah.
[01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:02.190]  He's also one of my old school
[01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:03.190]  breeders of the year.
[01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:04.350]  We'll give him.
[01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:08.270]  Going after some sours.
[01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:10.310]  Wherever you had the phone right now
[01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:11.790]  is perfect for audio.
[01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:12.830]  It's not clicking at all.
[01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:14.230]  What's up, Leo? How you doing?
[01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:17.030]  Oh, man, how you doing?
[01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:18.910]  I got you on the James Loud show.
[01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:21.150]  I'm going to be on the James Loud
[01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:22.190]  show.
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.430]  I figured I'd give you a call, see if
[01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:24.430]  you answered.
[01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:28.070]  He's just like, I'm going to call
[01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:29.070]  this dude, see if he picks up.
[01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:30.190]  Well, thanks for thinking of me,
[01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:30.750]  brother.
[01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:31.750]  Yeah, for sure, man.
[01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:32.910]  You guys know Leo.
[01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:35.150]  So if you got questions for Leo,
[01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:36.950]  I just wanted to thank him for the
[01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:38.350]  seeds, man. He gave me some of his
[01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:39.350]  Legged Sour
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.710]  and the new GTR.
[01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:44.790]  So awesome, dude.
[01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:46.070]  He gave me a whole bunch of seeds in
[01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.070]  there.
[01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:49.710]  Well, I'm popping them next week.
[01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:50.830]  I filled.
[01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:53.310]  OK, awesome.
[01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:55.430]  I need to get some vanilla berry pie
[01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:56.430]  from you, too.
[01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:58.910]  I'm going to dig those up.
[01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:00.870]  Since you since you mentioned it, I
[01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:01.870]  was like, I probably
[01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:04.790]  have like 30 or 40 of those seeds
[01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:06.070]  left. So I was like, all right, we'll
[01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:07.070]  go on.
[01:29:07.630 --> 01:29:08.630]  It's time to go dig in.
[01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:10.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:11.150]  I'm excited.
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.310]  So what is your opinion on the road
[01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:14.790]  kill skunk and where it's gone?
[01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:16.870]  We have a lot of people asking.
[01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:20.990]  You know, that was one of the
[01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:23.790]  things that connected Professor
[01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:25.510]  Q and myself when I first went to
[01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:27.270]  Spain about five, six years ago,
[01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:28.870]  Frenchy on our first trip over
[01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:29.870]  there.
[01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:32.030]  And when Frenchy was doing a class
[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.230]  over there, he kind of put it out
[01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:34.230]  there. He's like, look, you know,
[01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:36.190]  Leo's looking for the skunk.
[01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:37.030]  So if any of you guys have the
[01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:38.910]  skunk, you know, you
[01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:39.950]  definitely want to do a deal.
[01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:42.310]  And then I was at Spanibus
[01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.150]  one day at the booth.
[01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:45.830]  And French gangster dudes come
[01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:47.550]  come up, kind of reaching her
[01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:48.550]  jacket. I'm like, oh, shit, what's
[01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.710]  going on? He pulls an iPad.
[01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.990]  He's like, are you Leo?
[01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:52.670]  Like, we're friends with Quentin.
[01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:53.790]  He has the skunk.
[01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.350]  And he was holding what
[01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:58.510]  ended up being quite as the high
[01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:00.670]  pro skunk. So it was the
[01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:02.510]  kind of skunk that high pro
[01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:04.430]  got from Flying Dutchman.
[01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:06.110]  And then it was what they were
[01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:07.630]  using as far as like
[01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:09.190]  that old roadkill.
[01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:11.070]  And the whole point of that
[01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:13.070]  was, OK, what's the point is when
[01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:14.830]  we grew up the skunk, it was really
[01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:15.830]  different.
[01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:19.470]  The skunk that Quentin had was
[01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:20.990]  I thought it was pretty incredible.
[01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:22.270]  But it didn't give me it.
[01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:23.430]  It didn't. It definitely had a
[01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.190]  unique nose.
[01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:25.310]  Like, it really had this kind of
[01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:26.630]  astrid astringent
[01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:28.470]  kind of presence to it.
[01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:31.110]  Like if it was like to me,
[01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:33.630]  I kind of equate smells
[01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:34.910]  and and the
[01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:37.270]  smells and the taste to kind of like
[01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:38.670]  an EQ on a soundboard.
[01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:40.510]  And I feel like a lot of your sour
[01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:41.270]  is a lot of your gas.
[01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:42.270]  You get a lot of that.
[01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:45.270]  But I feel that with that particular
[01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:46.710]  skunk that Quentin had that came
[01:30:46.710 --> 01:30:48.590]  from high pro, it was all
[01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:49.590]  mids and highs.
[01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.790]  And then the base that was there was
[01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:53.630]  kind of like this lingering stink.
[01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:55.830]  But it wasn't like that fucking
[01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:57.670]  skunk funk like that.
[01:30:57.710 --> 01:30:58.990]  I'm going to puke.
[01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:00.750]  Smells like someone shat in the car.
[01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:02.990]  I haven't I haven't smelled that in
[01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.390]  like over 10 years.
[01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:06.630]  Yeah. So it's been fun for me
[01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:08.870]  since I smelled like real skunky
[01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:10.390]  skunk where it's like it smells like
[01:31:10.670 --> 01:31:12.230]  it smells like an actual skunk, like
[01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:13.870]  a nose burning skunk.
[01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:15.070]  When your dog gets sprayed with the
[01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:16.870]  skunk, there was weed.
[01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:18.230]  It's not exactly like that.
[01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:19.430]  And it was pungent.
[01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:21.110]  And one little tenth of a gram.
[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:23.110]  It's like cat piss to the real
[01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.310]  cat piss from back in the day.
[01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:26.310]  You had a tiny little bit of it and
[01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:27.430]  it would smell your whole house.
[01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:29.150]  You know, I didn't have.
[01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.150]  Oh, yeah, man.
[01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:31.790]  We had eights and eights, which is
[01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.230]  fucking smell everywhere.
[01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:35.910]  And they would reach like
[01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:37.150]  reach.
[01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:38.750]  If you had to like I remember back in
[01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:40.230]  the day, if you had some of that like
[01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:41.790]  really nasty skunk, someone was
[01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:43.710]  talking shit like if your bag was
[01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:45.430]  cracked open in your pocket, someone
[01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:46.430]  was talking shit.
[01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:47.950]  What smells right now?
[01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:49.670]  Because it didn't smell like normal
[01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.750]  weed to people back in.
[01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:52.070]  It was like hell.
[01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:54.910]  You know, I just remember
[01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:56.630]  it being like, remember, like when
[01:31:56.630 --> 01:31:57.510]  it would grow.
[01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:58.870]  I remember the last time I saw it.
[01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:01.190]  This dude, one of the dudes who
[01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:02.470]  used to work with Eddie Lett back in
[01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:03.790]  the day, his name was Alan.
[01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:05.750]  And I think he's the guy.
[01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:07.190]  He's the guy who started Grokashi.
[01:32:07.190 --> 01:32:08.790]  And he was the last dude I ever saw
[01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.870]  that had skunk.
[01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:11.670]  And he had it in this indoor back in
[01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:12.910]  the day. And when it was growing
[01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:14.510]  live on the vine, man, it was like
[01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:16.470]  it almost had a dog shit smell to
[01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:18.190]  it, like almost like that.
[01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:19.990]  I was just one of the it's not I
[01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:21.470]  wasn't like the over-encompassing,
[01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:23.390]  you know, smell that came out to me.
[01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:25.110]  But it was that was the strongest
[01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:26.510]  note that came out. I was like, wow,
[01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:28.230]  that's that's crazy.
[01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:29.990]  And then as it cured, that
[01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:31.190]  definitely, you know, it kind of
[01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:32.390]  morphed and changed a little bit.
[01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:34.070]  But I've never smelled anything like
[01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:35.350]  that since like I think that was
[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.910]  like oh, wait, when I smelled Alan's
[01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:38.910]  room, he had me walk in and he
[01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:41.270]  had the sugary from this dude
[01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:42.950]  from Doug from Booneville that used
[01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:44.430]  to win all the Emerald Cups before
[01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:46.270]  the Emerald before the late guys
[01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.110]  got came online.
[01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:48.670]  So we had the sugary and the stonk
[01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.510]  in the same room and it was just
[01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:52.470]  unreal. So I think
[01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:53.990]  everyone I don't think I don't you
[01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:55.350]  know, I have the same
[01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:57.590]  optimism as far as the skunk.
[01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:58.510]  I don't think it's dead.
[01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:00.590]  I think someone has it somewhere.
[01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.590]  I could exist somewhere.
[01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:05.150]  Someone's going to find it.
[01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:06.470]  Yeah, someone's been doing it.
[01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:07.550]  Just so it's their friends.
[01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:08.510]  They don't want to tell anybody
[01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:09.350]  about it because they don't want
[01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.350]  to get out.
[01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:11.990]  We used to get it from Santa Cruz
[01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.150]  and it would be 60 dollars.
[01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.110]  Nate, we called it the strawberry
[01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:16.230]  because that strawberry size
[01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:17.030]  nuggets in the back.
[01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:18.350]  But it was straight skunk like
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:19.870]  nose burning skunk.
[01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:22.670]  And we could buy
[01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:23.910]  an ounce, but it was 60 dollars
[01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:25.630]  and it's straight up for
[01:33:25.630 --> 01:33:26.510]  80 ounce.
[01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:28.590]  Yeah, but the hunt continues.
[01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:29.390]  The hunt continues.
[01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:30.630]  I mean, we've we've gone through
[01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:32.590]  quite a few different renditions
[01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:34.470]  of skunk. And that's like Clinton's
[01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:35.630]  baby is the skunk.
[01:33:35.630 --> 01:33:37.190]  Professor Q's baby is a skunk.
[01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:39.110]  My baby's the sours and whatnot.
[01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.350]  Like that's what I really identify
[01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:42.790]  with. Me and that plant get along
[01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:44.270]  really well. But Clinton and his
[01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:45.590]  search for the skunks, he loves
[01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:47.390]  skunks. And since working with
[01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:49.310]  that guy, I've got to smell a few
[01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.990]  different varieties.
[01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:51.350]  He's got people all around Europe
[01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:52.350]  like have these skunks.
[01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:54.550]  Try it. But we get a different
[01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:56.510]  profile. It's definitely like more
[01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:57.830]  reminiscent of like the Sweet
[01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:59.270]  Island skunk we do back in the day
[01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:01.110]  or like when Critical Skunk was
[01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:02.390]  like really big, you know, kind of
[01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:04.150]  like a lot of the profiles
[01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:06.110]  that kind of harks back to, you
[01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:07.790]  know, those kind of noses, but not
[01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:09.190]  really like in our searches.
[01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:11.150]  We really haven't seen that
[01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:13.030]  kind of roadkill presence
[01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.910]  in a long time.
[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:15.150]  Like that kind of knows that.
[01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:17.270]  Just fucking, you know, really
[01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:18.590]  throws you off. That's what I love
[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.390]  the most about it.
[01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:20.390]  You know, it's like that.
[01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:22.830]  And but at the same
[01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:24.150]  time, it's like I think the nose is
[01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:25.550]  really novel. But I think compared
[01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:27.230]  to today's standards, like if we
[01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:28.670]  were to find the roadkill, I think
[01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:30.510]  there would be definitely this huge
[01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:32.270]  novel aspect towards that nose.
[01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:34.030]  But I don't know if the structure
[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:35.630]  and kind of the looks of it would
[01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:37.470]  be as competitive
[01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:39.030]  on today's market as it was back in
[01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.870]  the day.
[01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:41.270]  I think a lot of us are just
[01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:43.310]  searching for that sensation
[01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.470]  like for me with Sourz,
[01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:47.630]  you know, Sourz, when you look at
[01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:49.430]  like a gelato or a run,
[01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:51.350]  you know, and with that has like
[01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:53.110]  a heavy base presence to
[01:34:53.110 --> 01:34:54.550]  their, you know, to their to their
[01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:56.470]  profiles and their nose, you know,
[01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:57.550]  and that kind of bag appeal.
[01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:58.990]  You just didn't see that back in the
[01:34:58.990 --> 01:35:00.270]  day, you know. So I think that would
[01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:01.830]  definitely be like if whoever finds
[01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:03.590]  it, I think it would kind of be big,
[01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:05.070]  but it's definitely kind of be one
[01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:06.270]  of the like niche specialty
[01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.870]  offerings because,
[01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:09.190]  you know, I like smoking all the
[01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:10.470]  skunks we've been working on.
[01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:12.190]  I like the Sativa high,
[01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:14.390]  but it's not like
[01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:16.390]  it's not remembered and it doesn't
[01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:18.270]  compare to like a sour high for
[01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:20.190]  me. But as far as the novelty aspect
[01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:21.750]  of it, it's like we all love the
[01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:23.390]  hunt and it's like it's just the
[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:24.790]  hunt itself is worth it.
[01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:28.150]  Hey, I hate to cut you off for a
[01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:29.710]  second. Can you back the phone a
[01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:30.910]  little bit away from the mic?
[01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:32.590]  The cell phone reception is causing
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:34.070]  a clicking in the background.
[01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:35.390]  You actually get pretty good audio
[01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.510]  if you're a little bit further away,
[01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:37.870]  but it's getting it's getting pretty
[01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:38.510]  heavy.
[01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:39.990]  OK, no problem.
[01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:41.310]  That could be me clicking my teeth,
[01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:42.310]  too. I don't know.
[01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:45.150]  But yeah, so sour diesel,
[01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:46.310]  you get the leg is sour.
[01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:47.190]  You want to tell us a little bit
[01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:48.550]  about the GTR and the leg it's
[01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:50.310]  sour. I'm super excited about
[01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:52.310]  anybody breeding sour to try
[01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:53.870]  to get shorter flowering, keeping
[01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:54.870]  that profile.
[01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:58.150]  Yeah, I'm going to be
[01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:00.950]  I've been breeding so
[01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:02.910]  sour is like my it's
[01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:04.830]  been my favorite strain and
[01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:06.590]  it's been the strain I've failed the
[01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:08.510]  most with in breeding the past
[01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:10.030]  like 12 years.
[01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:11.310]  I have a five gallon bucket of
[01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:13.190]  sour crosses that are fucking hot
[01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:14.510]  garbage, bro.
[01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:16.390]  And, you know, I've learned
[01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:18.230]  a lot. I was able to learn kind of
[01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.710]  this pairs really well with sour.
[01:36:19.710 --> 01:36:20.630]  This doesn't.
[01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:21.990]  Eighty percent of the time I was
[01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:23.910]  able to get kind of a structure to
[01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:25.670]  carry over in the resin profile to
[01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:27.390]  carry over, but not really that
[01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:28.390]  nose.
[01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:30.190]  So a lot of where I think I was
[01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:31.630]  able to carry the nose, I think a
[01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:33.230]  lot of hard work needs to be
[01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:35.030]  properly extended to three or
[01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:36.830]  three seeds in that team and those
[01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.310]  guys who really created G6.
[01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:41.110]  And also with the original diesel
[01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:42.750]  VX male that I use, but it was
[01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:44.750]  with that mom
[01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:46.870]  that G6 mom where I was able to get
[01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:48.910]  a lot of my smells of that sour
[01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:50.390]  nose and really carry over.
[01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:52.190]  So because when I first got the G6
[01:36:52.190 --> 01:36:54.110]  jet fuels from my buddy's aided
[01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:55.830]  down at Magnolia Wellness, he's a
[01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:57.230]  buyer down there and he had like
[01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:59.110]  this door that he
[01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:00.270]  was partnered with in the Bay and
[01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:01.310]  they were doing like a hundred
[01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:03.230]  light shifts and he gave me
[01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:05.110]  this G6. I was like, this is the
[01:37:05.110 --> 01:37:05.870]  one.
[01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:07.710]  And I opened the bag and
[01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:09.070]  I closed it. And I was like, this
[01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:11.110]  is the strongest smell I've ever
[01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:12.470]  smelled in my life.
[01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.710]  But one of the complaints
[01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:16.550]  about, you know, G6 jet fuel
[01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:17.990]  was like, you know, that's the same
[01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:19.030]  complaint you have with sour.
[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:20.110]  It was like the photo period was
[01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:21.230]  like super long.
[01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:22.670]  It necessarily didn't have that
[01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.590]  same resin profile
[01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:26.790]  that you had from a classic sour,
[01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:28.750]  but it had like twice the nose, in
[01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:30.350]  my opinion, like the base and the
[01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.350]  mids on it was just it was just
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:33.510]  fucking watering.
[01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:35.230]  And so I had a lot of really good
[01:37:35.230 --> 01:37:36.310]  luck with that.
[01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:38.190]  And then we crossed that same
[01:37:38.190 --> 01:37:40.750]  original diesel VX male into
[01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:42.390]  and to other sours and we were able
[01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:44.030]  to get really good sour, sour
[01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.110]  expression and a really good sour
[01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.950]  nose. But with that GTR,
[01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:49.990]  with the G6, that G6
[01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:51.990]  did what the headband couldn't.
[01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.910]  Remember old headband?
[01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:55.230]  You had sour shaped nubs
[01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:56.910]  and then you'd have the sour kind
[01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:58.430]  of profile. And then after it cured
[01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.030]  for like three or four weeks, then
[01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.230]  you would start to get a little more
[01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:02.870]  of that OG nose that would come out
[01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:03.630]  on the back end.
[01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:04.950]  Yeah, that nose burning gas.
[01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:06.430]  But with the G6,
[01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:09.950]  I love that.
[01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:11.670]  Like to me, that feel like that
[01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.510]  sound or that smell is where a lot
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:14.870]  of the expression comes from.
[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:16.750]  So, you know, with having that
[01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:18.470]  OG in the background that was with
[01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:20.590]  that sour, that was unlike
[01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:22.470]  a headband, but more intense.
[01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:23.870]  That's what I found in the G6.
[01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:25.230]  I was like, fuck it, I can get like.
[01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:29.910]  Uh oh, call failed.
[01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:31.030]  That's what happens when you're deep
[01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.110]  in the cuts in Mendo.
[01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:35.470]  How's the sound now?
[01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:36.630]  Is it better guys?
[01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:38.070]  That was like perfect.
[01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:39.190]  There was no clicking in the
[01:38:39.190 --> 01:38:40.070]  background at all.
[01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:41.070]  It was on point.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.160]  Hey, you've reached the
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.120]  person you know me.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.720]  I live in the mountains in Lumbul,
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.120]  so I'd probably get better cell
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.720]  service on Mars.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.240]  So it may take me a while to get
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240]  back to you.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.560]  Please leave me a text or a voice
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.360]  mail and let's connect soon.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.800]  Hey, what's up, Leo, you're back.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.240]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240]  Sorry.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.280]  Oh, no problem at all, man.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.680]  No problem.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.280]  Yeah, so we're just talking about
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.280]  sour.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.440]  Yeah, about the G6, I was wrapping
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.400]  up about, you know, about the GTR
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.280]  and really the goal was to kind of
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.400]  capture that same essence
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.120]  that you got from the G6 jet fuel,
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.440]  but on more of like a traditional
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.480]  sour frame where you had a little
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.320]  bit more of the lime green
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.040]  and a little bit more of the resin
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.160]  that where you have a lot longer
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.280]  resin stocks where
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.600]  when you trimmed it, you dry it up.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.760]  Like we have to be careful and we're
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.960]  hanging it and you're taking it off
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.280]  the line because the resin will just
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.440]  fall in your eyes.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440]  And that's what I remember about
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.760]  sour. I like so much.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  Yeah.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.160]  You know, it did really well
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.160]  in the bag. So
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.840]  that's that's definitely
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:53.840]  with the GTR.
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.600]  I think it's definitely something
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.520]  you're probably going to keep
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:57.760]  working for the next couple of
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.520]  years.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.680]  We're pretty happy with it.
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:01.720]  And, you know, how it's pairing
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.160]  well with these other sour crosses
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:03.760]  we're doing.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.240]  You're just we're going to see how
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.080]  far and different expressions we
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.840]  can get off of, you know, what
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.520]  people remember and know is sour
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.360]  and kind of see like what can
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.920]  we get like a purple expression with
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.440]  a shorter photo period because a lot
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:16.880]  of a lot of people are buying sours
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.040]  like, hey, beware.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.240]  Everyone right now is used to
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.680]  growing gelatos.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.680]  You want purple.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.600]  Eight to nine weeks.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.720]  You got to have a purple sour.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720]  It's going to be exotic.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.440]  Yeah, that's exactly
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.440]  I mean, three and three came close,
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.000]  you know, like outdoors.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.720]  All my G6s would get, you
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.520]  know, like they would get mostly
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.640]  purple, but not like purple.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.200]  You see in a red, orange, a lot of
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.240]  no with a purple tint.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.680]  Yeah. And purple, purple.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:41.680]  Yeah.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.840]  Yeah, purple leaves, but like
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.600]  semi-green kind of bracts
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.400]  and formation.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.720]  I want to see if we could get like
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.360]  a purple smelling sour.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.640]  And that's like the next goal to
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.120]  see, like, I guess we'll see this
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:55.120]  spring and how a lot of the progeny
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.520]  turn out from what we've been, you
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.040]  know, what we made the year prior,
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.320]  what we made this year, because we
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.760]  just can't pop everything every
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  year that we make.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.840]  We have to go, all right.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.480]  I think we should focus on this.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.600]  Let's see how that expresses, because
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.520]  I think for every 20 to 30
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.200]  strains that we'll test out, we'll
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.800]  be fine. Like maybe five to six
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.120]  winners, five to six strains that
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.200]  were like, hey, let's keep this
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.040]  going.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.280]  This other stuff was put on the
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.560]  back burner. I think it's going to
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  need more work.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  Yeah.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.440]  Awesome.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.120]  Good stuff, man.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.360]  I'm looking forward to sour.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.480]  Yeah. Making a comeback.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.120]  Oh, I'm stoked, man.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.120]  I popped all my old IVL
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.840]  beads, all my old
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.720]  leg crosses from back in the day.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.600]  I got my old legged cut back, got
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.880]  the Spirox sour back.
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.240]  So I'm definitely looking forward
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.280]  to playing with a few of these
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.080]  things and giving some of the homies
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.480]  some of these cuts so I don't lose
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.480]  it again.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:45.440]  Totally.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.800]  Like I lost the legged sour.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.000]  It took like five years to get it
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:48.440]  back.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  Yeah.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:51.160]  Yeah.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.920]  I'm happy. I'm happy we can find
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.160]  these things, but definitely want
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.160]  to be able to give them out to the
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.920]  homies so we could all
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.040]  compare and contrast our results
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.200]  and collectively
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.560]  cool our projects or, you know,
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.320]  sour hybrids and
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.840]  see what the community comes up
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]  with.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.560]  I'm still trying to catch up to
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560]  where 303 was.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.640]  Those wild hybrids.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.200]  I love souring what I do, but, you
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.360]  know, whenever I'm approaching
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.680]  cracking something, I'm trying to
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.440]  get on those guys level or
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.960]  what Carmen did back in the day
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.000]  with that VX2, because when it came
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.560]  out, I saw nothing but really good,
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.920]  you know, really good
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.880]  expressions and samples
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:28.880]  from that work.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.560]  So in my opinion,
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.840]  there's very few people that do
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:32.840]  sours really well.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:34.640]  JJ from talk to
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.440]  JJ's crush.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.720]  Always, always.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.720]  Yeah, he's definitely one of the
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.080]  common denominators for a
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.720]  good sour, you know, like, you know,
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.800]  things synonymous with sour
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  and chem.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120]  Awesome. Yeah.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:54.880]  Well, great talking to you.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.920]  I appreciate it.
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:56.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  Always.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.520]  Oh, cool.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:00.520]  Yeah.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.120]  On the radio.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.600]  I'm happy I was in service for a
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.040]  change.
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:05.360]  I know. Last time you cut out.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.400]  So it was great finishing our
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.400]  conversation this time.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.600]  Yeah, I'm super stoked, man.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.760]  Thank you so much for thinking.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.480]  Awesome. Yeah. We'll get you on the
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480]  show later in the year.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.480]  That'd be great.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.760]  Well, maybe you can come here in the
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.440]  bay. We'll record it down in the
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.440]  bay.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.840]  Easy. That's easy for
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:22.960]  me, but I would be spending more
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960]  time in SoCal.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:25.440]  I'm not going to be spending 100
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  percent of my time up here.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:27.320]  I'm going to spend my time between
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  SoCal and Humboldt.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.440]  So it'll definitely be easier to
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440]  access from now on.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.240]  Yeah.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.120]  Awesome, man. I hope you have a good
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  new year.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.440]  Yeah. Keep in touch.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  I'll talk to you soon, Leo.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.840]  Right on, man. Have a good show,
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.840]  buddy. Cheers.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.680]  So purple,
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:53.800]  I think there's you know, there's
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.320]  there's already some purple sour
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.040]  perps. It's not sour, sour.
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.280]  Yeah. Sour purple, sour crosses.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.480]  There's already some sour seeds.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.240]  Nobody's done it better than the
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.600]  sour, though. I would like to see
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600]  something where I'm like, fuck,
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.600]  this is just as good as sour diesel.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.160]  Sour is an interesting one because
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.960]  it's real greasy and so
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:10.960]  it doesn't wash well.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:13.080]  You got to smoke the the bubble ash
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.440]  right away from it because it's so
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.520]  turpy and those turp turpines
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.840]  are liquid. And so
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:20.680]  sour is not the best for
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.680]  extract necessarily.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.560]  It's not like GMO or GMO just dumps
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.160]  and you know,
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.560]  but that doesn't mean somebody's not
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.160]  going to create some amazing cross.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.640]  SDXBC seeds,
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]  Minnow perps had some.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.120]  Sure, there's a lot of people that
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.360]  have had it, but that doesn't mean
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.880]  they use the real thing or they did
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:37.680]  it right.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.880]  So I'm just in the opinion
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.120]  that it needs to be done right and
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.120]  prove prove it.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280]  Prove your work.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.720]  You know, trust but verify.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.280]  That's something that gets said
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.320]  that I was on a plane the other day
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.160]  and the flight attendant said, trust
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:51.160]  but verify.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.440]  But we should all be trusting
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.280]  but verifying when we see
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.000]  stuff. Chem cookies on sour cookie
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.080]  due to the cookies
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.600]  times sour was the tits.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.400]  That was a good one.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:07.240]  So.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.000]  Anyway, well, who should we call
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  next? You guys want to call Soma?
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.480]  Yeah, I think Cheddar and a few
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.600]  if you seconded Soma
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.040]  there. I think that's the next
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.840]  next go to as for the community.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:23.920]  We'll see if someone picks up.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.960]  He probably.
[01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:52.890]  So is I answering guys.
[01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:54.970]  It's pretty late over there.
[01:45:54.970 --> 01:45:56.130]  I think it's almost 10 o'clock.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]  And it's Sunday.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.240]  Eight, six, seven, five, three or
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.240]  nine, there you go.
[01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:11.930]  Yeah, you know, and it's like for me,
[01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:13.850]  I see some stuff on Instagram that
[01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:16.290]  Bud Rich says, yeah,
[01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:17.450]  they have some sour and it looks
[01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:19.130]  fire. I don't give a fuck what your
[01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:20.570]  sour looks like. It's all about
[01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:21.890]  taste and I was sour.
[01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:24.010]  The sour was not the easiest variety
[01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.010]  to grow. It foxtails regardless of
[01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:27.010]  what you do.
[01:46:27.970 --> 01:46:29.570]  It's an 11 week variety.
[01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:31.010]  So it's a pain in the ass to grow to
[01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.810]  get amazing weed.
[01:46:31.810 --> 01:46:34.210]  But when you do grow it properly,
[01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:36.570]  it comes out spectacular.
[01:46:36.570 --> 01:46:37.850]  And the effect
[01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:40.290]  has a desirable flavor.
[01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:41.890]  It has a desirable effect that I
[01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:43.450]  really love. And you really can't
[01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:44.450]  compare it to anything else.
[01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:47.250]  So.
[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:50.370]  Pepper strains, people love pepper.
[01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.370]  I don't like pepper.
[01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:52.810]  Spice is OK.
[01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:53.850]  Spice is cool.
[01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:57.090]  Pepper.
[01:46:58.450 --> 01:46:59.450]  Yeah.
[01:47:00.130 --> 01:47:01.130]  We're not calling Todd.
[01:47:02.970 --> 01:47:04.450]  Let's see who else you guys want me
[01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:05.450]  to call somebody else.
[01:47:07.130 --> 01:47:08.130]  Hmm.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:15.920]  Should we call Marlon?
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.240]  We can go Marlon. How's that?
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.060]  Who should we prank call?
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.980]  I'll give you guys the number and
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.140]  you guys all call them.
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.660]  I'm kidding.
[01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:39.230]  That would be the most evil thing.
[01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:42.390]  That was the that would be straight
[01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:43.630]  messed up, man, because then they
[01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:45.110]  give out my number to everybody and
[01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:46.830]  it'd be all bad.
[01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:53.490]  You know, you know who we should
[01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:55.530]  call and I bet you he'll absolutely
[01:47:55.530 --> 01:47:57.090]  pick up is my friend Miles.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  From Arizona.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.240]  He has no idea that we're going to
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.280]  be calling him to put him on the
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.280]  show.
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:25.180]  What up, James?
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.300]  Hey, what's up, Miles?
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:28.980]  Happy New Year to you, too.
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:30.620]  You're lucky.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:32.060]  I'm doing great, man. You're live on
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.340]  the James Loudshow right now.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.340]  Am I?
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.460]  Absolutely.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.300]  I figured I'd call and give you a
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:40.220]  New Year's, a warm New Year's
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.860]  welcome and see how you're doing.
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:43.540]  Oh, man.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.300]  That's an honor.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:47.340]  Happy New Year to everybody.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:48.740]  Yeah. So Miles works
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:51.140]  for Earth Healing in Arizona and
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.540]  he's one of the best cultivators I
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:53.540]  know as far as
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:55.620]  he does crop steering.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:57.020]  He's as far as for
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:58.540]  for Rockwell.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:48:59.940]  He is absolutely
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.500]  an amazing grower.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:02.860]  And I think he could probably grow
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:03.740]  good in any medium.
[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:05.620]  But in Arizona, Earth Healing,
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.740]  I feel like they're the number one
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.820]  guys out there.
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.660]  So I wanted to give you a shout out
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:11.220]  on the show and kind of ask what
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.220]  you're up to these days.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:15.180]  Oh, well, I appreciate
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:15.900]  that.
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.700]  There's a lot of people
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.620]  that have been sharing a lot of
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:19.620]  information and
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:22.500]  I'm happy to be a part of
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.460]  that and being able
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.820]  to move everything forward as far
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.020]  as the crop steering goes.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.180]  We've been building some greenhouses,
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:32.220]  some good mixed light greenhouses.
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.620]  We're down here in Tucson.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.700]  So we got plenty of sun.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.820]  So we're trying to take advantage
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:37.580]  of that.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:38.540]  I think that's kind of the way of
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:40.260]  the future is
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.900]  just highly climate controlled
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.020]  greenhouse where we can
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.020]  make use of the best of both
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:46.020]  worlds.
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:49.100]  Nice. So what are the what are the
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.220]  new hot streams right now that
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.540]  you're growing? That's kind of what
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:52.700]  we're we're after here.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.460]  What are the genetics?
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.140]  Well, whatever you're going to send
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:57.860]  me, James.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:00.020]  Totally. I get some new stuff for
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.020]  you. It's really amazing.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.260]  Yeah. So, I mean, right now,
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.780]  basically just working a lot
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.740]  of what everybody's been doing.
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:10.420]  You've got a lot of gelato crosses
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.540]  and some of the stuff that you've
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.540]  been getting,
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.940]  jelly belly crosses and things
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.700]  like that. But right now, I've just
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:17.660]  been focused on getting the
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:18.820]  facility up and running.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:20.580]  Some of our older spots are going
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:21.940]  to turn into just strictly
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.700]  phenol hunting spots to feed
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.820]  the production facility.
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.340]  So we're really excited about that.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.540]  Yeah. You guys popped a bunch of
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.740]  Jungle Boys varieties.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.060]  Have you guys been growing those
[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:31.940]  out, too?
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.420]  I know there was some amazing stuff
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:35.140]  with like the grape Topanga and
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:37.660]  yeah, grape Topanga was really good.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.020]  There was a good Mai Tai.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.260]  Yeah.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:42.060]  Some of the divorce cake crosses
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:43.060]  came out really well.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:44.300]  Good.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.900]  Their second round, there was a good
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:47.020]  punch breath as well.
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.260]  So we popped some of their kind
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.340]  of first releases
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:53.380]  and then we have quite a few
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:55.220]  other packs to pop to
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.500]  kind of keep searching through as
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.100]  well. So we had some winners come
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:58.940]  through.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.780]  Awesome, man.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:00.500]  That's good.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.660]  And then Memberberry, you guys
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:02.660]  crushed it on the Memberberry.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:05.300]  Yeah. Yeah. We're a big fan of a lot
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.500]  of ethos and stuff.
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:09.060]  Memberberry definitely crushed
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.100]  super hard for us.
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.860]  Citrusellic Sunset is another
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:14.340]  one that basically you walk into
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:16.180]  the building and just overwhelms
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:16.860]  everything.
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.420]  Kind of almost makes you want to
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.300]  vomit, but smile at the same
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.300]  time. So
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:23.900]  smiling and vomiting at the same
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.060]  time is always good. That's like a
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:27.340]  yeah, that's old school concert.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.060]  Holy and weed, right?
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.540]  Yeah.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:32.060]  Well, right on, man.
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.220]  I hope you guys have a good New
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:34.460]  Year. Say hi to everybody down
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.020]  there. And yeah, we will talk to
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.020]  you soon.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:37.980]  Yeah. Thanks for the call.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:38.740]  Take care, everybody.
[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:39.740]  Happy New Year.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:40.780]  Stay safe.
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.980]  Cheers.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.260]  Cheers.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.580]  Yeah. So there we go.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.900]  Who else should I call? Someone had
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:49.900]  some good ideas.
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:52.020]  We got lots of people to call.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.220]  We were talking about them and
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:56.860]  Cheddar Bob requested Masonic.
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:57.860]  If you wanted to call Masonic.
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:00.660]  We could totally call Masonic
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.860]  right now.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:03.540]  We should prank Masonic.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.900]  I think I don't have a partner,
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:06.980]  but that would be funny.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.100]  But we got him from a different
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.100]  line.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:11.060]  See.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:16.180]  We got Edgar right here.
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.580]  He's probably watching the show.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.180]  You never know.
[01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:31.390]  Hey, what's up, dude? You're live
[01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:32.390]  on The James Loud Show, bro.
[01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:33.430]  How you doing?
[01:52:33.710 --> 01:52:34.710]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:36.870]  Thanks for calling.
[01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:38.550]  I'm glad you're on as the, you
[01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:40.030]  know, background television on
[01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:42.350]  my Fairfax store right now.
[01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:43.510]  Everybody, I have like a couple
[01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:44.510]  guys in the store.
[01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:46.390]  We're like just chatting, but you
[01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:47.390]  are on in the background.
[01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:48.390]  So you're with us, too, man.
[01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:49.710]  Fantastic.
[01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:50.830]  How are you doing? How's your New
[01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:51.830]  Year's going so far?
[01:52:52.590 --> 01:52:53.590]  Oh, man. Great.
[01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:54.830]  Great. Great. New Year's.
[01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:55.830]  You know,
[01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:58.830]  took it easy with the family and
[01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:59.830]  now I clocked in.
[01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:02.510]  I'm at my store chilling and got
[01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:04.310]  people here, you know,
[01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:05.550]  chit-chatting and woo-shoo-ing.
[01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:08.230]  Nice. Yeah, we got Matt right on
[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:09.030]  the other line calling in.
[01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:10.030]  Hold on.
[01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:11.030]  I'm kidding.
[01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:14.070]  He's actually here right now with
[01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:15.070]  me. We're squashing the beef.
[01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.990]  Nice.
[01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:20.990]  Nice. Sharing some steak
[01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:22.310]  or something.
[01:53:22.630 --> 01:53:23.630]  How was your New Year's?
[01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:24.630]  It was fantastic.
[01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:25.670]  I didn't do anything. I went to
[01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:27.430]  bed like right after midnight and
[01:53:27.670 --> 01:53:28.670]  got some sleep.
[01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.350]  I've been working a lot lately, so
[01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:31.870]  it's nice to get some sleep and
[01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:32.950]  spend some time at home.
[01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:35.150]  And I'm going to be gone
[01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:37.190]  working most of January.
[01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:38.390]  It looks like I'll be all over.
[01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.990]  But yeah.
[01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:42.390]  Yeah. Ever since Christmas Eve,
[01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:44.190]  probably even the day before, I
[01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:46.310]  like kind of just hit the breaks
[01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:47.310]  on everything.
[01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:49.430]  And then I just got too
[01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:50.990]  comfortable and I was at home
[01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:52.710]  New Year's. And I'm like, I'm
[01:53:52.710 --> 01:53:53.670]  going to just go to work.
[01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:54.910]  I'm going to open up the store.
[01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:56.830]  So I came to work and I
[01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:57.950]  got out my motions.
[01:53:58.190 --> 01:53:59.190]  Yeah. Nice.
[01:54:00.630 --> 01:54:02.270]  Yeah. I was actually talking about
[01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:03.270]  you.
[01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:05.350]  One of the best interviews I've
[01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:07.350]  done this year and going
[01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:08.630]  into the show, I had like
[01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:11.030]  low expectations and I was like,
[01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:12.310]  oh, I'm going to call this guy out.
[01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:13.750]  I'm being a pollen chucker and
[01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:15.350]  all this stuff. And then you called
[01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:16.950]  yourself out and it was like, yeah,
[01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:18.830]  you know, your honesty goes
[01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:19.670]  a long ways, man.
[01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:21.550]  So big ups on
[01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:23.750]  2022.
[01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:25.070]  I think it's going to be a good year.
[01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:26.550]  I appreciate you.
[01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:28.350]  Yeah, that happens a little, you
[01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:29.630]  know, and I do get it with
[01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:31.990]  with the you know, you can't really
[01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:33.790]  fully communicate who you are via
[01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:35.430]  Instagram. So it's cool to get a
[01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:37.470]  VIP front row seat and
[01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:39.470]  find out whichever way.
[01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:41.190]  And I appreciate you coming over to
[01:54:41.190 --> 01:54:42.190]  the dark side.
[01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:43.390]  It's fucking dope.
[01:54:44.190 --> 01:54:45.590]  Yeah. I'm getting hated on for being
[01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:46.870]  nice to you. It's pretty funny,
[01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:47.710]  actually.
[01:54:47.710 --> 01:54:48.990]  It's bad. I'm sorry, man.
[01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:50.950]  Those bullets, you know, they come
[01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:51.990]  with territory.
[01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:53.750]  Yeah, it is what it is, man.
[01:54:53.790 --> 01:54:55.790]  I think if people actually
[01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:57.030]  watch the show, they'll see the
[01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:58.390]  genuine side of you, you know,
[01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:00.590]  whatever. It's like you can base
[01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:01.590]  your own opinions.
[01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:02.950]  People want to hate people.
[01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:03.950]  It's so stupid.
[01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:06.190]  I don't hate anybody.
[01:55:06.190 --> 01:55:07.630]  That's too much emotion for me.
[01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:09.150]  Even the people that I dislike.
[01:55:10.590 --> 01:55:11.830]  When it comes down to it, I don't
[01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:12.830]  want to see nobody
[01:55:13.710 --> 01:55:15.110]  do bad or anything like that.
[01:55:15.230 --> 01:55:16.230]  Yeah.
[01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:17.630]  Yeah.
[01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:20.710]  And I think you've grown as
[01:55:20.710 --> 01:55:22.390]  a person over the last couple of
[01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:23.670]  years, too. I think we all have.
[01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:25.230]  Covid's also changed us.
[01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:27.430]  You know, we got
[01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:29.230]  people giving you respect,
[01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:30.630]  definitely in the chat here, too.
[01:55:31.590 --> 01:55:33.390]  I appreciate everybody that is
[01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:35.350]  down and has held me down
[01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:37.070]  from here to there, including you,
[01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:39.510]  James. You know, I appreciate,
[01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:41.110]  you know, the words and the
[01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:42.110]  sentiment and, you
[01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:44.830]  know, coming over to Free Seed Day
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:46.750]  and parlaying with all
[01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:48.590]  the people in the community.
[01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:50.990]  I don't care what anybody says about
[01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:52.710]  you. Free Seed Day is something
[01:55:52.710 --> 01:55:54.430]  that's going to change the industry
[01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:55.950]  for years to come. We're going to
[01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.430]  we're going to celebrate Free Seed
[01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:59.310]  Day every year, just
[01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:00.830]  like you and I have been doing.
[01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:02.190]  The Free Comic Book Day,
[01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:04.790]  you know, being a part of that and
[01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:05.990]  then seeing it go into seeds.
[01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:07.030]  I mean, that's an amazing thing.
[01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:08.710]  And you get credit for that.
[01:56:08.710 --> 01:56:09.990]  So thank you for that.
[01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:12.110]  Yeah. Thank you for
[01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:14.670]  co-signing that for sure.
[01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:16.430]  Yeah. Anything next year.
[01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:18.190]  We're not next year, but this year
[01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:19.390]  we're going to do bigger and better.
[01:56:20.150 --> 01:56:21.430]  Oh, no doubt. It's coming.
[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:23.470]  So everybody listening to this,
[01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:25.110]  you know, if you make seeds and want
[01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:27.310]  people to get down and dirty
[01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:29.190]  on some of your beans and don't
[01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.630]  necessarily want to spend three
[01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:32.950]  dollars on a hundred packages
[01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:35.590]  or more, send them to Mace and
[01:56:35.590 --> 01:56:37.230]  I'll get all the physical people
[01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:39.110]  here all rounded up and we'll do
[01:56:39.110 --> 01:56:40.430]  it all in one shot with
[01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:42.630]  with all credit to you, whoever
[01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:43.910]  you are. And that's just a little,
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:46.630]  you know, heads up for anybody
[01:56:46.630 --> 01:56:48.270]  that's interested. Breeders,
[01:56:48.550 --> 01:56:50.510]  established breeders, pollen
[01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:52.550]  chuckers, seed makers, whatever
[01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:53.550]  you want to call yourself.
[01:56:54.190 --> 01:56:55.070]  Yeah, I'm going to give out a
[01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:56.230]  thousand packs this year.
[01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:57.910]  That's I'm obligating myself to
[01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:59.030]  give out a thousand packs at
[01:56:59.950 --> 01:57:01.550]  Free Seed Day wherever we do it.
[01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:02.550]  Or if we do it in multiple
[01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:03.950]  locations, we can divide them up.
[01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:06.070]  But yeah, I mean, I think Free Seed
[01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:07.070]  Day is a great thing.
[01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:08.630]  So, yeah, guys.
[01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:10.870]  Well, James, man, I'm
[01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:12.430]  actually going to jump on a call
[01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:14.470]  with your favorite magazine,
[01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:15.750]  Skunk. I overheard.
[01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:16.790]  So nice.
[01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:18.510]  Let's see. Let's see how this goes.
[01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:20.510]  Nice. Tell Julie I said hi.
[01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:21.510]  If you're talking to Julie.
[01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:23.070]  I'm talking to somebody.
[01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:24.070]  I'm going to find out right now.
[01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:27.350]  Yeah.
[01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:29.270]  Well, James, happy new year.
[01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:30.310]  Yep. Happy new year.
[01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:31.310]  Everybody watching.
[01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:33.110]  Yep. Have a blessed new year and
[01:57:33.110 --> 01:57:34.110]  we'll talk to you soon.
[01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:35.350]  Thanks.
[01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.350]  So, guys.
[01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:41.670]  Who's next?
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:47.600]  Hmm.
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.200]  You know, let's see if Kyle picks
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.200]  up his phone.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.880]  Kyle, he's the grower of the year.
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:54.720]  We I said he's the best grower
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.040]  of 2021.
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.560]  Let's give him a call and see
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:00.360]  what he thinks.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.560]  Is going to be big next year.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:06.520]  He got his friggin Instagram page
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  hacked.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840]  That's.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.520]  Yeah, it totally sucks.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.280]  Then they posted this guy's like
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:16.760]  a truck guy and they
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:18.920]  posted like a Land Rover.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:19.920]  It's fucking bullshit.
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.400]  Pardon my French.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.760]  Oh, Kyle, be nicer if you picked
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:28.760]  up.
[01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:37.150]  Kyle's got like 17
[01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:39.150]  kids, not really, but he is like
[01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:40.150]  five.
[01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:42.510]  It might as well be 17.
[01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:44.110]  I have two and it might as well be
[01:58:44.110 --> 01:58:45.430]  10 at this point in time.
[01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:51.710]  Yeah, seriously.
[01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:53.350]  Let's see if he calls me back.
[01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:58.300]  Call me back right now.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.930]  On the James Lowe show.
[01:59:06.970 --> 01:59:08.650]  Yeah, Kyle, he's been on the show
[01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:09.650]  before.
[01:59:09.650 --> 01:59:11.050]  You guys probably seen him when I
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:12.690]  was up and I did an interview with
[01:59:12.690 --> 01:59:13.930]  him and Tim from Washington.
[01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.730]  Loud Canagenics is our brand
[01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:17.250]  together. And Kyle is just.
[01:59:18.810 --> 01:59:19.810]  You know, it's like
[01:59:20.610 --> 01:59:22.130]  he's helped with the ganja farmer
[01:59:22.130 --> 01:59:23.210]  stuff. Some of the ganja farmer
[01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:24.730]  stuff is all coming through
[01:59:25.210 --> 01:59:26.410]  the work we've done together.
[01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:27.890]  And Kyle is just an amazing
[01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:28.770]  grower.
[01:59:28.770 --> 01:59:30.930]  He's a seed producer, grower,
[01:59:31.890 --> 01:59:32.890]  crushing it.
[01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:34.210]  The thing is, is pheno hunting,
[01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:35.650]  which I'm going to get him on our
[01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:37.330]  show so we can pick his brain
[01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:38.330]  about pheno hunting.
[01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:39.610]  I have a couple of people I'd like
[01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:41.170]  so we can kind of all discuss the
[01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:43.290]  different pheno hunting principles
[01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:45.130]  that people use, because I know we
[01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:46.650]  have some friends and some
[01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:48.610]  of the stuff we do is up to 22,000
[01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:49.370]  plants. Right.
[01:59:49.370 --> 01:59:50.890]  And then you look at
[01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:53.490]  hunting in 100 plants or less
[01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:55.570]  and then growing out multiple times
[01:59:55.570 --> 01:59:57.130]  and you really kind of
[01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:58.770]  boutique style.
[01:59:59.490 --> 02:00:00.490]  So anyway.
[02:00:02.890 --> 02:00:03.890]  Well.
[02:00:04.930 --> 02:00:05.930]  It's a good question.
[02:00:05.970 --> 02:00:07.370]  I'm not sure I'm going to answer
[02:00:08.130 --> 02:00:09.130]  it's one or three.
[02:00:09.330 --> 02:00:10.290]  So I think we're going to call the
[02:00:10.290 --> 02:00:12.130]  show unless you guys
[02:00:12.130 --> 02:00:14.090]  got anything else you want
[02:00:14.090 --> 02:00:15.090]  to discuss.
[02:00:15.850 --> 02:00:17.370]  But I really appreciate everyone
[02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:18.730]  coming on, man, I hope everyone has
[02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:20.490]  a blessed 2022.
[02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:23.010]  You know, as far as like Sweet
[02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:24.530]  Wellness LLC dot com,
[02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:25.890]  you guys want some free seeds.

[02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:28.250]  show me your receipt.

[02:00:29.970 --> 02:00:30.970]  Gmail.
[02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:33.050]  Simon from Serious Seeds, that's all
[02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:34.850]  I see. And Simon is the
[02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:35.570]  F1 Breeder.
[02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:36.890]  He's the real real deal.
[02:00:38.250 --> 02:00:40.410]  So big up to Simon from Serious
[02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:41.890]  called El Chapo.
[02:00:41.890 --> 02:00:43.490]  He grew more as a kid than most
[02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:44.970]  as as an adult.
[02:00:45.770 --> 02:00:46.770]  El Chapo.
[02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:50.010]  Yeah, love you guys.
[02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:51.410]  Have a good one.
[02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:53.450]  Let's talk food and cannabis
[02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:55.690]  sometime. Cheddar Bob, anytime.
[02:00:56.210 --> 02:00:57.890]  I hope you guys have a great year.
[02:00:57.930 --> 02:00:59.250]  I hope you guys grow lots of weed
[02:00:59.250 --> 02:01:00.530]  and smoke lots of weed and
[02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:03.930]  yeah, and I'll be back next Sunday
[02:01:03.930 --> 02:01:05.250]  with something. We'll do something
[02:01:05.250 --> 02:01:06.610]  every every Sunday for a little
[02:01:06.610 --> 02:01:07.810]  while. We'll see how it goes.
[02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:10.410]  I'll be out of town, but take care.
[02:01:11.490 --> 02:01:13.610]  And London, thank you for
[02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:15.570]  helping with the show today.
[02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:16.610]  Really appreciate it.
[02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:22.270]  You still there?
[02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:25.630]  I pulled I pulled the chat,
[02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:27.750]  I pulled the chat, I didn't turn
[02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:29.670]  my mic on when
[02:01:29.670 --> 02:01:30.710]  I was supposed to.
[02:01:31.110 --> 02:01:32.390]  So my apologies.
[02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:34.110]  But thank you so much for let me
[02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:35.110]  come on and
[02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:37.310]  you know, bug you a little bit.
[02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:39.270]  For sure.
[02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:40.270]  Weird questions here.
[02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:42.710]  I appreciate you.
[02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:44.710]  You want to tell us real quick about
[02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:45.750]  the plants that you got growing
[02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:46.750]  around you?
[02:01:47.110 --> 02:01:48.110]  Sure. Yeah, there's
[02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:50.230]  a variety. I'm right now.
[02:01:50.230 --> 02:01:52.190]  I'm actually a
[02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:53.390]  couple of friends of mine went in on
[02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:54.870]  a pack of in-house genetics.
[02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:56.870]  So I've got some velvet sky in front
[02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:58.870]  of me that I'm hunting
[02:01:58.870 --> 02:02:00.710]  through. These are actually the
[02:02:00.710 --> 02:02:01.910]  mums are over there.
[02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:04.150]  These are this is the hunt that's
[02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:06.350]  going into the tent
[02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:08.070]  right now. I try and put about eight
[02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:10.270]  to ten in every three weeks
[02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:11.630]  and just kind of roll through
[02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.070]  rotation. I got some aqua polka
[02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:14.350]  gold here that I mentioned from
[02:02:14.710 --> 02:02:15.710]  Bodie Seeds
[02:02:16.590 --> 02:02:17.910]  and a little bit of this.
[02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:19.790]  Now I've got kind of one of the
[02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:21.230]  flowers that I have with me right
[02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:22.230]  now. Where'd it go?
[02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:23.230]  There it is.
[02:02:23.230 --> 02:02:24.230]  Try and keep it out of the light.
[02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:26.630]  I've got some Chernobyl
[02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:29.670]  subcooled the dank that
[02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:30.910]  was hunted from a buddy.
[02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:32.390]  And it's like quite special that I'm
[02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:33.910]  smoking. And I actually just did my
[02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:34.910]  first cross.
[02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:36.350]  I don't know if you can see here.
[02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:38.070]  Let me maybe bring up the camera a
[02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:40.270]  little bit. So it's a bit bigger
[02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:41.510]  in my first crot.
[02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:44.190]  So I crossed that with my strawberry
[02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:45.350]  banana that I hunted.
[02:02:46.510 --> 02:02:47.710]  Is that seeded or is that the
[02:02:47.710 --> 02:02:48.710]  phenyl?
[02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:50.510]  That's the that's the hunted.
[02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:51.550]  That's the hunted.
[02:02:51.590 --> 02:02:52.430]  I seeded this one.
[02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:53.830]  This was actually from a buddy.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:56.110]  It's been passed around Washington
[02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:57.470]  and brought up from Washington for
[02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:58.710]  about five years.
[02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:59.830]  Apparently quite a
[02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:02.350]  few friends have been passing it
[02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:04.230]  around. So I was really excited.
[02:03:04.230 --> 02:03:05.550]  What a friend of mine offered me to
[02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:07.230]  play with that. So I brought that in
[02:03:07.230 --> 02:03:08.950]  and I hunted out a strawberry banana
[02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:10.390]  that don't have any with me right now.
[02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:11.790]  The mum's over there
[02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:15.150]  that I brought
[02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:17.310]  and hunted.
[02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:19.350]  So I feminized that one
[02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:21.070]  using colloidal silver
[02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:23.630]  and then brought that in and did my
[02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:25.750]  first feminized cross as
[02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:27.190]  well. So that was that was very fun.
[02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:29.190]  I just did like just the tip of
[02:03:29.190 --> 02:03:31.230]  each branch and actually
[02:03:31.230 --> 02:03:33.190]  have a really like I do a course
[02:03:33.190 --> 02:03:34.590]  too. So I do in like a little
[02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:37.110]  kind of fun promotional seed pack
[02:03:37.110 --> 02:03:38.910]  with where it's actually
[02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:39.790]  a puzzle box.
[02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:41.710]  And I'm I'm engraving the puzzle
[02:03:41.710 --> 02:03:42.790]  box with burn.
[02:03:43.110 --> 02:03:44.270]  And you actually have to get through
[02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.990]  the puzzle box.
[02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.990]  There's a bunch of cool things.
[02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:47.790]  You'll see some photos probably at
[02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:49.710]  some point on the on the network
[02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:50.710]  here.
[02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.870]  But I appreciate it.
[02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:53.710]  And I got to go pull
[02:03:53.710 --> 02:03:55.270]  a loaf right out of the oven,
[02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:56.910]  actually. So I'm going to go.
[02:03:57.070 --> 02:03:58.430]  I just realized I'm cooking bread
[02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:59.430]  right now.
[02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:00.870]  I appreciate it, man.
[02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:02.910]  Happy. Well, actually, the holidays
[02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:04.310]  are over. But yeah, happy new year
[02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:05.390]  and have a good one.
[02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:07.270]  Thank you. Back to back to Monday
[02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:08.990]  tomorrow. It's the ultimate Monday
[02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.910]  tomorrow.
[02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:10.910]  Nice.
[02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:13.030]  Another Monday.
[02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:15.030]  Yeah. Every day is Monday for me.
[02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:16.350]  Every year.
[02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:17.670]  I haven't.
[02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:19.790]  This month is a full
[02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:20.790]  month of Mondays.
[02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:22.470]  So you guys have a good one and
[02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:23.870]  hopefully we'll talk next Sunday.
