Yeah, so this is the camera that faces the desk, which is right there.
Operation Central.
And then, but right now I'm packing lots of seed orders.
So I'm at my pick and pack station.
And so when people give me, you know, send seeds like this, like they're going to get
crushed in the mail.
So I always have to then transfer them to, you know, something that's going to protect
them.
So like, I'm, I'm basically like transferring seeds to the vial.
So that's been my, my morning so far.
Right?
No, it's a, it's all part of the process.
People don't understand how much work actually goes in and to real production, getting seeds
to the people, all the, you know, breeding's one part of it, but it's, it's tedious getting,
you don't have a full commercial seed packer.
It's a lot of work cleaning, just cleaning.
Yeah.
It's a, there's a lot to it for certain.
Once you get a commercial seed packer counter, that's a different story, but that's when
you're getting into corporate level operations.
I'm just going around setting off green greenhouse heaters right now.
Yeah.
Automation is good, but some of that stuff's pricey.
Like those, you know, the seed sorting machines.
I mean, those are, what do you think?
Five, $10,000?
I, when they start, yeah.
And they can go up to considerably more than that.
There's cleaning, sorting, counting, sizing machines.
There's machines that'll vacuum set like 72 pack trays or whatever it is.
Or even, gosh, do I have any to spill?
Yeah.
So people want to, people are asking for a greenhouse tour since you're outside.
For a greenhouse tour?
Yeah.
Do you want to show us around?
Is that it?
I can cut out a greenhouse tour?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sure.
Well, let's see.
So right here is one of my solar panels or my exhaust, one of my exhausts.
This is like a rooftop solar exhaust that gets the bulk of when it gets really hot.
I have multiple layers.
So this literally had ice on it.
It's just starting to melt out.
But this is part of a, gosh, a humidity condensation door.
So I got a half door plastic.
I got a screen.
I got another screen.
So that keeps bugs.
It keeps...
Did I just see, it looked like you passed lemons or something.
Did I just see that right?
Yeah.
So this is a pink variegated lemon that about six weeks ago, the thermostat in here malfunctioned
and we had a 20 degree night and this is right by the door.
So it took it pretty hard, but you can see it's starting to...
Let's see, I'm in reverse here.
It's starting to sprout back a little.
A few leaves survived and I trimmed it back considerably.
I lost...
I had full fruit and tomatoes and everything that night too.
The reality of it, I used to not even have a heater and did it all with like an electric
heater or just water and solar.
I still have, you can see right here, this is...
I would hook up...
If I had a solar, I would have done it that way, but I use a small fish tank pump to run
water through this tube to collect heat and push it back into a 70 gallon trash can and
then distribute that through the night.
So slow solar collector.
You can do those passive, you can do it with a solar unit.
And I used to do them with the 300 gallon boat, a two inch black PVC that ran across
and I had a 50 foot long greenhouse like this and it ran along the floor and it would push
a jet of warm water in the top and suck cold water out the bottom.
I think they call that one a solar siphon.
Right.
And then the next step is going into the ground, which I have never done.
So let's give a quick shot of what Emix is.
And so I've got four inch tech and I've got...
You can see this...
I'm trying to look blind here and I'm holding this like this.
Yep, I see it.
All right.
So this is the hardcore I'm running.
I just wanted to do that germination test.
I decided to find this skunky individual.
So I've got 40 of them here in four inch.
They just are five days into here and I seeded them all out in this tray and these were the
little ones that weren't quite going.
So if we come back a little further, you can see a slightly larger pot.
So just quickly in the tray, it's just one like big area of soil.
It's not a bunch of...
Yeah, I know.
...bunch of boulders, right?
I'll trench it like this and lay seeds in.
If I'm just doing a mass germination, you can do a couple of lines of that and then
separate them out.
And then if you find one you like and you want to pull it out, you just gently get around
the roots and kind of...
You can do that.
But, you know, so let me show you.
I'll just...
This one's a little runty, but...
Boom.
And it's got a beautiful little root wad to it.
And I'll do...
This is one I'll end up potting up later.
This is one that had a great smell to it, but it was runty to start with.
And again, you can just...
So this is fairly inert and I can trim those roots considerably.
And I don't have any way to hold this, right?
So you can flip your camera to do it on...
You're doing the selfie camera right now, right?
Like the inside.
But if you hit settings, I think, and then there should be something where you can scroll
down.
I'm going to see if I can get my screen bigger here.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Oh, that didn't work.
All right.
He'll be back.
Fat fingers.
Anyway, I'm packing up.
Here's one order, which was...
There it is.
So going through the email, I've got a completely different header blocking my top of the screen
here from going through text.
Cam mic.
Okay, wait.
That's camera.
Yep.
And then camera pick...
Actually, someone said I have to clean his garage.
I've been cleaning and we got...
I've been putting shelving to get everything off the floor.
There's more shelving over there.
And then I've been trying to...
There we go.
All right.
So here we go.
I'll use the squeegee to get moisture on the ceiling because it condensates and I'll squeegee
it off pure water into my plants, right?
But it also helps get a little more light in here.
And when it's moist, it helps get the condensation down.
It really can stay really humid in here, especially when it's super cold.
There's a bunch of little hemp seedlings that I just threw in here.
I pulled them out of where I don't want them grown.
But you can see what I got here is soil in these pots.
And when I do them properly, I've got them...
There it is.
I've got lava and grow down down at the bottom.
Not grow down.
I always say that wrong.
Grow down is the rock wool.
This is the clay pellets.
Okay.
So actually, that's it because I've been going down a deep dive of like...
You know, vermiculite, perlite.
What is it?
Leca or what do you call those clay balls?
The expanding clay balls.
I keep saying grow down.
That's the wrong name.
Somebody is going to put it in the chat.
I can't read the chat right now, but it's what we use for hydroponics.
And I have tons of that stuff sitting around.
I use it because that's what I got.
It's porous too.
Here's one.
So it actually has...
Geolite.
Someone said geolite.
That might be one of the names of it.
There's brand names for it.
Hydroton.
Hydroton.
That's the name I've been looking for.
Thank you.
Yep.
So it has four spaces.
It's literally clay that's been heated and expanded.
So it has that CEC capacity, even though it's reduced because it's been cooked.
And it has air and it has spots for your redox.
It can go anaerobic in the zone when it's all wet.
We got a military helicopter coming over, so it might not be fair as well.
That'll be a second.
Yeah.
So yeah, perlite is what I use because it's close to me and the manufacturer of mine.
I got this wonderful living soil.
And what happens is this becomes a nutrient film all through here.
And I turn on the pumps and I can do all sorts of stuff.
You get a little bit of organic matter in there and there's worms living in that.
They're eating, they're pooping, they're feeding.
And ultimately, if I'm doing a long-term setup, I want to top feed.
And it circulates the available nutrients that's in the soil.
I've got, this is a primary tank.
And you can see it's pretty low right now.
I need to top it up, but it's got a siphon in it.
And it goes to the next tank behind it there.
So you can line these up.
And I've chained like six of these tanks together with siphons.
If I want to get out of town.
You can have a plant in here catching.
But when this is flowing, this is just dripping off of here and catches.
And this is all stuff you can pick up at Home Depot to build one of these.
You can use an ebb and flow table.
There's really a whole bunch of really awesome variants to this that I'll be teaching.
So I do multiple cycles through here if we're breeding.
And then this year I didn't have a production cycle for spring.
But here's some Dr. Dream inbred.
Let's see if it'll focus here.
I think if you put your hand kind of behind it.
There you go.
Yep, yep, yep.
This is like number five of my S1 test.
The females.
Some PCK, Pakistani Chitil Kush.
This is a reject.
It's too small.
It smells great.
But it really is another one that just doesn't frost.
There's some diversity.
This is like from the male that I inbred to itself.
And I ended up rejecting all of its self offspring for a higher inbred sexual.
Here's some of that.
The turquoise dragon that I rejected out of the four inches.
It was...
I forced a whole bunch and got three out of like 60 that didn't do any intersecting extreme.
So I went ahead and let these things finish out just because plant lives matter.
Just quickly, when did you start flowering these?
Like right now we're March 30th.
I think it was Super Bowl Sunday.
Okay.
And so does that imply that you had a little supplemental lighting in there and then you
killed the supplemental lighting?
No, they were indoors.
All this stuff I flip it indoors and then move it out.
Here, these guys were...
This is a Hasselblad Miel, the spear of milk and honey.
It was overwintered in here and it took that hard freeze.
It was just starting to come out at like 10 hours out of dormancy into flower.
And that hard freeze hit it and kind of slowed it down.
The turquoise ones, they were indoors flipped and then brought out.
So, sorry.
So you had them under what?
Like LEDs or what kind of light?
It was high pressure sodiums.
Okay.
No, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ceramic metal halide is where they were.
And then how do they generally handle the transition from a total indoor environment
to suddenly the outdoor?
So sometimes it depends on the time of year and how much sunshine and things like that.
It also depends on the genetic that's getting transitioned.
Something like the Malawi gold, you can run it for four months or longer.
You can flip it for a month and a half indoors and move it out almost any time of the year.
It kind of just slows it a little bit.
But some of the other ones, it takes, depending on how far north it comes from, you can have
two weeks back to veg is the fastest.
And so, and again, it depends on how much daylight you got.
We had about 11 hours of daylight when I brought these out.
And so it basically just, it was colder and less light.
And they just slowed down.
And then a couple of weeks later, they started kicking back in to get their flower moving.
And these were, these were going in four inch little pots, just like these things, flowered
out halfway into the flower cycle.
And then I potted them up and give them some more stress to see what the responses were
and called out down to, I've got some pollinated.
This is that.
Go ahead.
I was going to say just quickly, what's your latitude?
I think we're like 35 or 36.
I looked at that recently and it's not something that's ever been stuck in my head.
Here's that.
Well, so my question is, what's the latest you would bring something out to flower before
the days start getting longer and it just gets all fucked up?
Yeah, yeah.
So, and it's, where I'm at, I got mountains on both sides.
And so there's ambient light, not full light.
And those are the kinds of things that you got to take into account of, not just looking
at your lighting schedules.
I'm showing all this terrible stuff that's gone through the window.
I want to show this beautiful purple with the light behind it.
It's hard to really see.
Yeah, there we go.
I saw the purple for a second.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look at that lighting.
This is the inbred, like 10 generations of PCK that I'm calling the Zachistan Kush.
It should be all purple now.
So the latest I tend to go would be about April 16.
I'm starting to notice if something's been out here for a while, it's starting to elongate.
April 20, I really need to have tarps going at my location or the average plant is not
going to be happy and start going to re-veg.
My best light here for pulling tarps though.
But, but, but sorry, would you need the tarps immediately or like a couple of weeks later?
Yeah, yeah.
So if you were, if you were going full 12 and 12s indoors and you brought out mid-April,
you've got about two weeks while it's just going, hey, what's going on?
The days are about 12 and 12 or maybe 13.
They seem to be getting longer.
I need to go back to veg.
So you got about two weeks it takes for that stuff to happen.
And again, depending on how much quote unquote Indica versus Sativa is, I'm just showing
some freshly seeded flower here.
So yeah, if you don't get your, your veggies going yet, here's, here's some Green Dragon.
Little, little cactus zone going.
Yeah, so it, it definitely, those, that's part of what we're talking with Erzaran about
is when you can actually match those latitudes to your lighting and, and pay attention.
You know, like, like I said, the last week, we're not doing springs.
You might want to pay attention to utilizing this energy source, even if it's just for
some hash or something.
But the more you know, here's some, this guy, the top of it froze and killed in that frost
episode.
It's big.
And here's, this is my little heater that I use.
Simple, run gas and you can get these with propane.
And I found, I figured this is going to be the most effective way to end the amount of
hot I was getting.
Something I wanted to do.
Well, actually, so just to finish up that last thought, the latest you would comfortably
bring plants outdoor, I kind of, I'm trying to get the end of the winter, like, timing.
Yeah, yeah.
Without light debt, like without feeling like you need to pull tarps.
No.
What date?
It would, it would have been two weeks ago.
Okay.
So, so mid-March is when you would comfortably pull vegetative indoor plants outside to finish
outdoor and flower.
Yeah.
And then, and then if you get without, without any tarp, you're going to have some slight
elongation of your flower, you know, coming in, right.
And that's where you're like, ah, and so it's, it's, but you're going to go from a full
edge and natural light.
And it's going to slowly progressing back up to about 14 at that point.
Right.
And was the timeframe the same when you were living in SoCal?
Like for when you would comfortably.
It's all totally different.
It's totally different elevation.
Your elevation and your, and your longitude, latitude.
There are going to be massive factors in this.
And that's, that's the stuff that with the Zarian's land race classification system shows
where, how that stuff relates to where you're at.
If we get a trans-mercator map, which is the flat squared out earth, it's distorted.
So you could draw straight lines across geographic zones of the earth.
And then you can match yourself up on latitudes that way.
And then pay attention to your elevations.
Again, there's some other small factors like how close you are to the ocean or large
body of water that will prevent freezing from happening.
There's, there's definitely a couple of different factors there to pay attention to.
Again, like things that have a base of tropical sativa don't tend to revert like the
northern latitude Indica do once you transition them.
So that's, that's a kind of a big equation to play with and learn.
But once you get that dialed into your spot, you can totally have that spring crop
that does you wonders.
Yeah.
So on a tangent, someone asked if you can talk about San Pedro.
Um, growing it or I've cooked it down a few times and I've actually yet to,
I've passed it all on to other medicine people.
I've not actually ever watch umad to be honest.
I've been growing it for about five years now.
This one here is not what umad.
This is a totally different.
This is the only plant that I have in my entire repertoire of hundreds of plants.
It's in completely native soil where, and I put rocks on the top to keep the cat out of it.
But um, this thing weighs, I can't lift it.
It hurts me to move this around.
It is so heavy.
It's not that big of a cactus, but the soil, it literally hurts my, I have to wear gloves
to hold because it's so heavy.
It hurts my fingers.
That's, that's with field soil compared to potting soil.
It is, uh, I mean, I don't want this thing growing fast.
So I put it in heavy, poor soil.
So it's just this specimen.
Um, that's a, one of the Mexican stuff.
And so for, sorry, for all your cacti, you're just using the native soil?
No, no, no.
Or just that one plant?
These guys here are, I just had too many and they overwintered.
I didn't get a chance to process them.
I'm like, you know, I'm just going to plant them back.
So this is a living sand soil that I've got here.
It's all augmented and plants, you know, fixed up for, for growing food or flowers or whatnot.
And then when I pot them into pots, I tend to be using, um, um, like third generation
living soil where I just put it into the pot as well.
And I've, I've actually got quite a few of those, um, indoor.
Let me, I'm gonna see if I can't not shut myself off again.
But, um, wait, I got to scroll down.
There it is.
Camera facing back.
So there we go.
I'm going to get my face back on here.
I'm done.
All right.
There we go.
All right.
So I'm going to actually, was there any other questions about inside here?
I got some more cactus.
I can show you guys how, um.
Ah, well someone, someone asked if you have any Nigerian flowering right now.
No, I do not.
Not since last summer.
Um, yeah.
So let's do that again.
And then someone asked how long the flowering time is on the Breath of Red Dragon.
70, 75, depending on, I'm actually not running it under lights yet.
Um, so I'm getting outdoors.
It's going 70, 75.
Um, I've got that one I had in, I was fondling that one, um, that was flipped on, on Super Bowl Sunday.
And, uh, I'm expecting a little bit longer with that.
So, um, but I put it outside so it changes how long I was, I got flowering.
I got, I got pollen going inside in the indoor chamber right now.
So I wanted to pull that out and not have it.
I've got another.
And for your cacti, is, is the soil, are you making it much more airy?
No, I'm using the exact same spin.
So my living soil, I like when I bought coot soil from Jeremy, I found it to be way too heavy for my liking.
I ran it two cycles just to, you know, to give it a full, and then I fluffed it up to what I prefer.
So these are, what, five gallon container.
Yeah.
And they're all four foot tall or so.
Um, this one here, 18, I think gallons.
And this has been growing since I got this pup from, uh, Peter Parisi, he was living in SoCal.
And I put like 40 or more feet, maybe 50 feet off.
Oh, shucks.
There's four times, here's 20, um, one, here's 20 feet right here.
Um, I've got like 20 cuts off of this thing or more.
So it's put off 100, 150 feet in a couple of years and spent living spoils.
Or I just, I don't really reamend it.
Sometimes that, that one in the big pot gets a little urine.
They really enjoy the greenhouse.
Um, I had them out in a semi-shaded area last year, a beautiful cactus garden in the front yard.
Um, but I've got a whole bunch of, there's a little teeny pup that's taken.
This one here I'm experimenting and he's not taken.
But, uh, there's, here's the orange tree I've had for 20 something years.
And this is the second container it's been in.
And the first one broke.
But, um, same kind of thing.
I'm basically, uh, live in soil for the most part.
And I top it, top it with rocks to keep the cat out, put all the leaves back in.
And then what I need to do with this one is, is, uh, pretty soon here is I'm going to take it outside.
You can see how it's, it's sinking some.
It's, it's used and I want it up about there.
So I'll tilt it on its side and lift this whole thing out and bottom fill and fill around the sides and trim the roots like a bonsai.
Just quickly, is the issue that the cat likes to pee in them if you don't put that stuff in?
Yes. And, and that, um, it's like the trainer did not.
Um, and that's the easiest way.
It's just in the dead of winter, specifically when everything's frozen outside.
And, um, it's kind of hard for her to get out and do her business or whatever is with, uh, but you know, I never put them in this one.
She never scraped in here.
I think I had her trained after these other ones.
It makes a mess too when she's digging in the house.
So, um, yeah.
So, uh, gray sun grown asked how many feet of growth period per year do you get?
You know, in the greenhouse, this guy here, you know, with multiple tops, right.
That makes a huge difference here.
Um, um, each one of those can be giving me a foot, but if we look, we look right here.
Let's see, trying to get this where the lighting is better.
Um, that's a foot, right.
And we're starting to get, this is this year's, this over winter growth.
And this was last year out in our desert semi-shaded zone.
Right.
So kind of the same here.
I'm getting a foot of flame more or less.
Some of these are narrower, but it's kind of the same nine inches finger to fingertip on my hand.
Yeah, they definitely like it better in that greenhouse environment though.
And, um, some of my other art that I like to do, this is from my time in Yellowstone.
Actually, this was after I go up and visit, I got friends up there.
Uh, this is a commission I did that never actually got paid for and I took the wind out of my sails.
But part of how that works is you do multiples, work out kind of like breeding or the way I do it.
Is I test things, see what works and what doesn't before, you know, it came from a photograph.
So, so that you painted, uh, you had a photo that you were referencing.
I made the photograph too, but you know, the same day I took that photograph,
I was standing there where I took the photo from and was painting the scenery as well.
And, um, that's really difficult because with this kind of terrain, the light's constantly changing.
It's, this is one of the most difficult paintings.
Let me see if I can zoom here and you can see there, the kind of detail we're talking about.
There's a hundred thousand driplets of water and there's a rainbow refraction going on in the droplets.
Yeah, and, but yeah, as the light changes and it bounces around through all this zone here.
If you're looking at that every minute, it's a completely different picture.
It's pretty complex.
And so I'm just trying to get color notes when I stand there and look at it.
Photographs, take a thousand photos, go through and find the right one, crop it to the composition.
And this is, um, dynamic symmetry.
So the, the, the sides, the, the dimensions are part of, are based on pie.
And then I lay everything out and I was, guess I was doing this stuff before I knew I was doing it.
But, I don't know, here's, here's a neat one that shows something we're all interested in.
Living soil, which I guess, you know, these things here, they're, they're all chemistry, right?
That's serious chemistry going on there.
It's building that stone.
Um, I think, I think I titled this something like where God makes water to become stone and steam.
Something like that.
But, but here's, this is, um, we call it the devil's castle and it's a sedimentary metamorphic rock.
And right behind me where I'm standing there is a mountain made of granite and two very different materials.
But there's that beautiful black soil that we all want, right?
And this really shows the whole process.
It, it, those steep elevations there, that living soil is, you got, you got tectonic uplifting
and it shoves those mountains up and they get exposed to rain, snow, thaw and whatnot.
And, um, they crumble and break and snow breaks it up and pushes it down.
And eventually it moves down through the streams and, and the trees and the plants do their thing.
There's, there's different symbiotic relationships with all sorts of fungus up there.
The Amanitas grow wild up there.
And after the fall rains, you can go pick them.
But they're one of the main mycorrhizae that are interacting with all the spruce and aspen and whatnot up there.
And then the forbs and grasses in the foreground there, that stuff all has a whole different set of the ectomycorrhizae.
The trees have the endomycorrhizae.
The soil in this, underneath these flowers is just this deep, rich black.
But again, it's derived from primarily that sedimentary metamorphic, right?
Which has already gone through the carbon cycle and laid down as a seabed, compressed, folded.
And it's much more softer rock than the granite behind me.
Um, and has a lot more mineral, mineral richness.
Yeah.
Art and living soil all in one.
Now I was going to say we need a, a painting session with you one day.
Right? Yeah. That's something.
You can channel your inner Bob Ross and make some happy little trees.
When I used to paint in Yellowstone National Park, I would like translate the Spanish to somebody who's speaking.
It was like translating into Japanese.
And, um, the mitochondrial sporiforma is the title of this particular, one of my originals of this idea.
It's hard to catch with the glare.
And, uh, my best selling print.
I need to fix that one up.
But, um, this comes from when I was in Yellowstone though.
And the ground literally rumbles underneath you.
And talking to how there's more space in the soil and whatnot.
And I've got some more of these.
I do like skiing.
I can't actually see.
There we go.
That's my best selling.
That's hardcore right there.
That's my buddy.
Ripping it up.
That was, uh,
That was Dia de los Muertos.
That was the November 1st, 2004.
And we were skiing Stonecrusher.
Here's some more of that mitochondrial sporiform concept.
The intertwinings of what's going on underneath.
And, yeah.
This is all gold leafed.
And, uh,
Oh, cool.
This right here, I have a brand.
That was made by me, for me, by a cowboy metal worker.
And it's my initials at the registered trademark.
I put it on all my woodworking as my maker's mark.
But some of this other stuff.
That's above, so below.
All etched in and, uh,
multiple crafts.
I'm wondering
if some of our local rivers.
Oh, here's some more fun.
This is the day I almost died firefighting in Wenatchee in 94.
Let's see.
My brother just lit that spot fire to test it.
Well, we're to our back and to our left.
And straight ahead, there's massive fire burning.
And we're, we're,
stopping it from burning the section down to our right.
And
this right here.
Was I was checking myself after spending nine minutes after under
basically all of that lit up and turned into this.
I've been firing.
You can see on the right upper third.
There's a man standing there and he's watching for boulders and logs coming down.
Yelling, look out for me.
So just quick.
So just quickly cheddar Bob asked if you've heard of agar art.
Agar art.
Is that a type of a type of art or somebody?
It sounds like like you're making stuff using mushroom agar.
That's what I was thinking.
All right.
Cheddar Bob clarify.
Here's all the elite.
I'm going to be them and I seen for folks here.
This is TV souffle.
It smells like peanut butter.
Here's
here's the red dragon.
That's not already knocked upon earlier.
I don't think he's coming out.
Great pie.
That's delightful.
Flurry cane.
So, so he said it's bacterial art and Petri dishes.
Yeah, no, it sounds awesome.
Which direction like a pigmented bacteria would go or something.
Right now, I think I may have seen something like this.
Just like it's like trying to etch a sketch.
Yeah, I think I've seen something like that.
Just like a here now or a dodo quickie on YouTube or something.
Here's some more emacs.
I can teach a little ecosystem mimicry energy cycling systems.
Again, we got these larger pots.
Certainly grow some some root out.
This one's only have a single rock to stop the soil from coming out.
But this gets alive in here.
Okay, you can see.
Yeah, I use rock to block when the filter.
I'm just top feeding these guys right now.
They're going to get moved out as soon as the pollination is done and buried into 20
to 20 gallon 30 gallon toast.
So this digester here.
I don't change the water in here.
This is digest.
This is like algae and bacterias.
And I do I do amendment.
Sometimes I do add a little feed occasionally.
The supplement, especially with breeding and those little teeny pots.
I got him.
Here's one of the simplest ones you can build for supercharging.
If you want to try the system that I'm talking about, these ecosystem imagery energy cycling systems.
It'll scale up from the smallest this.
And this is a concrete trough.
Right.
And I didn't even buy these.
Somebody dumped a whole bunch of aquaponics system stuff at my house one day.
A realtor sold the guy's property.
And so I used to get really concerned about this being full of algae.
And now it's only if it if it clogs.
But it's simple fish tank pump.
It's a simple fish tank pump.
And it's a really simple pump.
And it's a really simple pump.
And it's a really simple pump.
And it pulses every 15 minutes.
And this is alive in here.
And this is alive in here.
Again, the tank underneath the biodigester.
This has a drop oxygenation system where it just drops right through.
And so, you know, 10, 15 bucks for a tote.
10 bucks for this thing.
10 bucks for your pump and hose.
And then whatever aeration or whatever you're using.
And whatever aeration or medium is used for hydro.
But if you look, you see this?
This isn't just hydro.
This is living medium down here.
This is all alive.
And it's hyper oxygenated.
And sometimes it'll go through that redox.
There's pores in the lava and whatnot.
And yeah, that's the simplest.
The simplest.
I have to use acid here.
I don't use it all the time.
But my pH is like a 9.
Out of the tap.
Not a whole lot down in here.
A lot of plate pebbles need to come out.
But again, I don't swap this out.
I just top it up and occasionally add some nutrients if necessary.
Yeah.
Someone asked a little while ago what size pots you have in there.
Those ones I think are like 12 or 15.
I'm not sure.
This one's a 3.
I know that.
So they're definitely bigger than what I'd call a 5.
But it could be 5 and short.
It might be what's going on with these ones.
Or 7 and short.
They're not super tall.
And I've never gone out and bought pots.
I use what we have what's called bulk clean up here.
People throw stuff out on the curb for recycling and whatnot.
And that's one of the things that I like to do is just go and see what people are throwing out and reuse it.
Recycle, reduce.
As far as cloth pots go.
The only ones I ever use are like your shopping bags.
But UV here is terrible.
They don't work so great.
They're fine if I'm doing production for instance in that Ebb Flow E-Mix system.
But it's so dry here.
I look at like Dragonfly Earth Medicines raised beds in their greenhouses.
And I look at that and I'm like there's no flipping way I can do that here.
Because the way it's...
The wind blows dry here.
It just sucks all the moisture right out of everything.
I'm still here.
Even my composting and worm piles and stuff I have to be due diligent about not letting them over dry in the breeze and such.
I don't know if we had anything else we were going to discuss today.
That was just kind of a general...
In my head I was like we can talk and I can pack up seed orders and multitask.
And I've gotten like one package packed up in the past 40 minutes.
I think that if St. Bernard's Observation Booth would be down to jump on with us.
I may or may not have just sent a link to jump on.
I thought maybe we could bring some people in.
Spot check news.
Cheddar Bob, you want to jump on and say hi?
Magma Seeds, you're in Europe, right?
Cheddar Bob, hold on.
Cheddar Bob.
He's whipping up some chowder.
Boiling some lobster.
Hold on.
Let me...
I might disappear for a second here.
I'm trying to get back to the main screen.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.
Oh, I know what I can do.
There's the main screen again.
All right, hold on Cheddar Bob.
Cheddar, you were busy last night.
You didn't see my compost pile living sand little short, did you?
I did not.
I could walk out there and dig another little hole.
I've got like fully mycelial loaded sand.
I'm sorry, I did.
Let me see if I have...
Yeah, I had some stuff.
After I saw that, I was looking at the bottom of my worm bin,
which is like top floor is the new stuff,
then the next floor down,
then the next floor down,
and the bottom is kind of what I eventually take out
and then put that tray on top.
And the bottom one had tons of...
And I was hoping it was some sort of mycelium
or saprophytic or something.
And not like some sort of mold that I don't want.
People were telling me it looked good.
Because it's not like the...
Almost like the white cotton candy,
like fluffy clouds.
That's not what it was.
Let me see if I actually know what I have.
It's pretty rare to find that nature, honestly.
You need to have the right tools.
I don't know if I have any.
I don't know if I have any.
You need to have the right moisture temperature.
It's a time of year thing.
But when I've seen it in the yard here,
it's something I've been wanting to show people.
And this is a great example.
When I'm walking around, though,
and the ground's moist,
and even when it's dry and I walk barefoot,
it seems to me every time I step,
that fungal mat knows that I'm compressing the soil,
that I'm crushing a stick,
that I'm compressing a leaf.
And making it more available to that decomposition.
And it sends signals out.
This is stuff I've been thinking when I lived in the...
Spent so much time sleeping out in the forest and stuff.
And then when I started seeing it here
in my dead, sand, desert, valley floor,
it was really awesome to see.
I wonder if that directed...
When I first went to put worms in my compost pile,
and I dug it open, it was full of worms.
Did the fungal mat tell them to come here?
I don't know.
But that was a question I have
that I'm never going to be able to answer.
I don't know how I got red wigglers in my compost
in the middle of the desert otherwise.
Right?
Life is amazing.
Oh, wait. Hold on.
I need to...
So I just...
I have a picture of the...
You got the free shot of it?
Something I was realizing...
There's all these...
I'm trying to figure out the holes
and the spaces that are filled with mycelium.
I'm pretty sure after looking at it a couple of times,
that's where earthworms, not red wigglers,
but the earthworms were moving through the sand
and leaving voids.
And then that mycelium came through
and filled up those wormholes
with hypo math.
It's pretty neat.
Okay.
This is going...
Let us call you Worm Bin.
Okay.
And let's upload.
Where are you, Worm Bin?
There we go.
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
Actually, wait.
Let me pull up your...
Is the Instagram working?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, hold on.
Share.
Okay.
Can you see that?
Yeah.
That's the stuff.
We're literally...
Chunks of...
That's inverted from how it was sitting in the ground.
There's a flat surface it's sitting on.
It was basically the original sand surface
of the last time I scraped with the shovel.
And then a bunch of organic matter
was piled on top of that.
I got chickens.
They'll pull my compost bin apart
and I throw it back in there.
Literally three, four inches of humate
had built up over the sand.
And it's a hypo math.
Mycelium is just occupied
the three or four inches beneath that humate layer.
This is a pretty rare site, really,
to have that much.
You can see that little spot in the center there.
That's what I'm talking about
where I think a worm had totally gone through that.
And then the hypha comes through after
and fills it in.
All this bacteria...
If you're starting with a dead compost bin,
you're trying to get this started,
people freak out on it.
One of the things that's missing
is the nitrogen cycle.
And keeping a pea jug
is a great way to get started.
I know people freak out on that.
You don't have to do that.
A bag of manure,
any other compost,
moisture is key.
Enough nitrogen is key.
And that's why people talk about
having the ratios of green to brown.
But there's different ways of attaining that.
My compost stays hot through the winter
as long as it's a large enough mass.
That's something you can use
for eating your greenhouse and stuff.
I used to do those wheat bags and things like that.
Here I'm showing the leguminous tree
right next to the compost pile
and explaining the different trees and plants.
That right there is a gooseberry,
a rhizogin species.
And these are all plants
that interact in the forest more or less.
There's maples back there.
They have symbiotic relationships
with insects and fungi as hosts.
So I'm just conjecturing.
It's like, hey, this is probably
what's going on with this mycelial mat
right underneath here.
I don't show it very well enough.
But there's also right between
the bottom, you've got the mycelium
and the sand.
And then there's this pale humate layer
that's like really well decomposed leaf
from probably two years ago.
And all through that layer
is roots from these trees
coming in and taking what's dropping out.
Because I do turn it occasionally,
it's not much higher than those
lower bottom layers that don't get turned.
But that's what, if I could grow outdoor,
if I could grow right in the ground,
having that compost pile
right there is like perfect.
I zoom back out here in a second
so you can see the full screen.
I'm showing it's so dry here.
Our soil, we have moisture on top
for about four inches in that organic matter
and then four inches of super dry sand.
I pulled out a dead rot and a root
probably from that tree.
But it was conduing water
through that hole.
But yeah, it's so dry in the desert here.
And then there's the organic matter
that's accumulated.
Living soil in situ.
Shut up, Bob.
Dub long pipes.
So just quickly,
since we were on that topic,
this is my,
that's kind of a fuzzy picture,
but that's what's going on
at the bottom layer.
And it's basically,
it's almost like a powder.
Yeah.
So it may well be like
non-continuated,
my feeling,
like a whole bunch of starts or something.
Right.
Looked like that moon
that Riddick was trapped on.
It literally is.
It doesn't stick together.
You can see how it crumbles in my hand.
It kind of is like a powder
once you break it.
It doesn't have a lot of tensile strength
to hold it together.
Yeah.
You as well.
I've been watching you
the last couple of weeks.
I don't.
I did.
I did have some questions for you.
I don't know if you guys want to finish
up the mycelium talk or not,
but I was just filler.
So go ahead.
Yeah.
So Blue and I had been talking
a while ago about
terp influenced beds.
And we had this idea
about like growing
cultivar
and then using as a top
soil like blueberry sod
because we're from the
nation.
And so we have like,
you know,
blueberries up the bunghole.
Right.
So we were we were curious
about how
that network of root systems
and acidic topsoil
and mycelium network and
everything,
if that would possibly
influence the terp profile
of the cultivar as well.
So
we start with the chemistry
of the terpene profile
that makes us say,
hey, that's a blueberry
in the plant.
Right.
Now you look at that chemistry
and you're like,
is this the exact same chemistry
in a blueberry?
It may well not be
right.
Let's start with when we
taste a blueberry and we have
that blueberry flavor,
we smoke it and we have that
sensation.
There's probably aren't the
same chemistry.
They might be right.
You know,
like skunk is
it doesn't last long in a
flower because it's a
phenol,
right, both from the skunk
and in the flower.
That smell is an alcohol.
Right.
And
so in the plant that you have
that terpene profile,
having those that local
material is going to be great
with all your mycelium,
your microbes and all that
stuff.
It's going to do well with
your indigenous microbes
where your terp profile is
going to maximize is when
you have all of
the least limiting factors
eliminated and you have an
optimum system.
OK, and I'm going to give you
a parallel here.
We'll answer your question.
One of my favorite flavor
enhancing systems
that I developed after reading
the label on sweet when they
started putting those liquid
bottle flavor
enhancers out and I started
realizing this is just like
sugars.
And what is actually doing
this?
I started using this,
maybe a tablespoon of molasses
and a couple of cups of
mixed berries from Costco in
a blender.
OK, and putting that top
rest
maybe that much in five
gallons for a thousand watts.
And in the last 10 days,
the finish and it would just
explode the nose
and the flavor on stuff.
Right. And I've had people
who are friends, local friends
who are best buddies.
I've given my exclusive cut to
like, how do you get that
smell like put those berries
on at the end and they just
blows up.
Right.
Is it a certain I mean, is
it a certain type of berries,
you know, like
it's not necessarily the
berries themselves.
It's OK.
The availability of sugars
in those micro
nutrient feeding is
what I've come to determine.
We're not transitioning that
berry flavor into the plant.
Right. Plant thinks of skunks
and lemons.
OK, but
in a limited system
until you've got this
full robust soil in place.
And I was growing in small
pots and feeding
liquid nutrients for
we're considered organic for
the longest time, probably
200 cycles like that before
I really transitioned back
into full soils
and figured that stuff out.
It's having all of that
stuff there.
So if you have a full
rich, robust soil,
it has everything it needs in
it. Adding something to it's
not going to make any
difference.
Now that I have these
larger soil containers with
full organic, full
enhanced all the rock
dust matted in there,
whatever compost and
everything.
My mix of juice,
berry juice doesn't do a
thing.
OK,
another parallel was
like I discussed
the farm in Switzerland
that tried EM1 and
compared it.
And it's like they had the
perfect organic soil for 30
years. Adding the EM1 is not
going to change a thing.
If you add it to a dead soil,
it's gone.
Right.
So it kind of depends on
your starting and where
you're starting from.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Once you get to a certain
point, you can only increase
the quality of things to
your
diminishing returns.
I think they call that
you hit a point of like
I've gotten everything in
here already.
Just I'm
oil painting.
You paint it too long.
You ruin it.
You put one too many brush
strokes on.
You destroy the entire
structure of all your brush
strokes in the color format.
And you're just
and you're ruined it.
Right.
So there's a point you get to
where it's like that's that's
it.
That's all we need to do.
And so I would say, yeah, go
ahead and use those.
They're going to make you have
a wonderful tour that's
you know, your local flavor.
Right.
So so I'll tell you what
got me thinking about this.
It wasn't really blues.
I brought it up to blue, but
so I don't want him to get,
you know, in trouble.
But like in Maine,
when you're growing
outdoors, there's lots
of pine trees.
Right.
And so a lot of the
outdoor flower, at least
that I have smoked,
always has this pine
terpene on it, no matter what,
no matter what
particular cultivar it is.
Yeah.
Carries this like pine
real, real strong
pine terp on it.
I hear I hear some of the folks
in India saying that about some
of the the pine forest grown
Shiraz as well.
And this is one that's like,
is it because of the acidic
soil structure?
Right. Or is it the terroir?
You know, can you.
Yeah. And terroir is like a
natural occurrence.
So is there a way that you can
build terroir in a bed,
you know, indoors?
Oh, over time,
it's a desirable thing.
If that's something you
there's a concept that came out.
I'm not sure if it's Stanford
or Yale, but these guys came up
with something called the food
computer and they were supposed to
put them in production here in Utah.
And I tried to get ahold of never
and never went off the ground.
But they were doing they made a
movie, Cloudy Chance of Meatballs,
right?
I am not sure if that's the same
folks.
No, it's a it's a kid's movie.
Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry.
Like, wait, no, that's not.
OK. So the food computer is
basically they were thinking
in terms of chefs
more more or less.
Right. Growing specialty herbs.
For specialty culinary dishes.
Right. And like, if you don't
have that to war in your herbs.
That dish ain't the same thing.
Like it like basil from Italy is
different from basil in Maine.
Yeah. Yeah.
Even if it's Genovese sweet.
Right. It's not going to be tasting
the same thing.
And so when we
like the land race, if you pull it
out of wherever it originally was,
we move it and we want to grow it in
our closet.
It's not going to be the same on so
many factors of epigenetic response
of temperatures, humidity,
that lighting regime, unless you can
dial it in with your LEDs.
Right. So they were inventing this
concept for
herbs. And it's the same thing I was
thinking parallel about growing
land race.
I would love to have a production
facility like this for growing
land race for the commercial market
so people can experience the
clean tour of
the Nigerian or
one of these Himalayan
grown plants or something from South
America, right. A high elevation
Acapulco gold or
Colombian gold.
Right.
The so you've got all the
soil microbiome, you've got
the soil particle
structure from the parent material
that you want to copy.
All those things
there. They're thinking that out
for growing culinary herbs in
basically in a
fully environmentally
controlled container
shipping container that they dial
in and you said, you know,
you could have a small like a
phototron size or these
larger ones for a restaurant.
So you're saying there might be a chance.
Oh, it's definite.
It's definite. It's a matter of
what's our parameters of
of how much can we invest
in that and get a return for it? Is it a
hobby thing we want to do?
Is it something that we can get
a connoisseur investor who has
millions sitting in a bank
and earning interest who wants to
build something that's going to benefit
everybody? We call this we call
those trust of far ends up here.
Yeah. Yeah.
I used to ski with
a billionaire.
But you paid for your own.
You paid for your own ski past in you.
I paid for my own ski pass. He actually
took a lot of ski bumps in and
you take people heli skiing
for free quite a bit. And he owned a ski resort.
You take people up there and whatnot.
One day I
read The Richest Man in Babylon
and I went to him being the richest
man I knew to ask for advice, which
it says to do in that book.
And I says, Hey, John, you know,
can I ask you some advice? And
he's like, Yeah, sure. Like I
was hoping you could direct me
and teach me a little bit about making money. He says,
Alex, all day, every
day people ask me for money.
Nobody in my entire 50 year life
has ever asked me for advice on how to make
money. Come on over for dinner.
Yeah.
It's weird how those things work out.
Right. Right.
Yeah.
I started a real estate
empire and very soon thereafter my daughter
came and that whole idea changed.
That was the advice I got
from him was real estate's one way to
do it.
Peter, head down, get to work.
When you I'm
just listening. Yeah, this is
a
you guys. What did I see?
A T1000 cross with sky
Jaro F3.
Yes.
Wow.
I have the
I have the Jaro F3
from me and Gene, but I don't have any
that that this is from him.
This is he sent down
a ton of
a ton of seeds that I'm now
packing up.
I hope you have gloves on.
That's
a different doctor's visit.
Oh man, I get harsh
on gloves sometimes. It's like man,
I am not under OSHA or any
medical program.
You'll never see me wearing gloves.
I wash my hands.
I wash my body.
My hands are very
clean right now. If there's anything
living on me, it's
from my compost pile and it's very
healthy. I will feed it to my daughter
directly.
My hands have been like in my worm
bin and my soil
and
and wash.
I will tell you where my hands have been.
But yeah, I was I was just going to press
some flower here.
I don't know if you guys want to keep talking
while I do that or yeah.
Maybe you could paint. You could
press all the packed seed
orders.
I've been working too hard
with the breeding for the last couple of years.
It literally the way I am
operating in the space I have in the
time frames and things like that.
I don't have a whole lot of time for painting.
I'd like to try and whittle that
back in and now
I'm doing more F2s. The cycle is a little
easier than doing a whole bunch of F1s.
I need to get back to painting. I want to start
painting some of the Candace flowers actually
and seeing what kind of results
I can get from that.
Are you an oil painter?
That's my primary that I've
been doing for
maybe 10 years or so now.
It's what people tend to buy.
My truest passion,
the equation I love
is a
loose tonal study with
watercolor and then
coming over that with pastel, traditional
soft pure pigment,
crystalline form.
That's an extremely difficult equation
especially if you're working in
plain air outdoors.
The results are so magical.
The way the light bounces through those
pigments and stuff and
reverberates. Then the difficulty
of trying to take a round
chunk of crystalline pigment and make
a fine little hairline
is a dark and light.
I admire
you guys that have that artistic quality
between music
with Peter and you apparently
with painting. The love for
that.
I don't have an ounce of musical
ability or artistic ability
in my... You're about to
wash some hash and that's an art in all of
itself, buddy. That's
work in progress.
I did not start...
I can't draw a stick figure.
I'm dyslexic. My hand goes backwards.
The fact that I can produce some photorealistic
and hyperrealism paintings
is really bizarre
because you can't read my handwriting.
Right?
Rembrandt
did not produce a masterpiece the first
time he put charcoal to paper either.
There was a late
night discussion.
He was bringing this up. It's breeders.
We all started as pollen chuckers.
You got to figure it out somehow.
What's the difference between
a Rembrandt and a crap
someone took on the sidewalk and threw a frame
on it?
Maybe if it's the first crap
it's just a crap on the sidewalk. After
100 craps that guy's figured out what to eat,
how to hold himself up
when he's letting it loose, how long to hold it in,
how much water to drink beforehand to get it to release
right. He's
produced this work of art at that point
whether you appreciate it or not.
He put a frame on it and
he's figured out the equation.
Same thing
with soils. Same thing with breeding. Same
thing with any of this stuff is solving
the equation for x.
What are your variables? What are the
parameters that are going to limit you from being able
to accomplish your goals?
Mitigate
those parameters
and move from there.
It's
constantly
pushing the potato around
to see where it rolls and
figuring out which works best.
That equation might work really
good. It might work better than the last one you tried
but it might not also be
the ultimate solved equation
to maximize
the x.
Oh, cool.
I need to get me one of these things.
I'm a wholesaler
for them.
I'll get you a discount.
Right on.
The Harvest Right guys,
they manufacture right here in Utah.
Man, the Harvest Right guys are
killing it. Don't they have a corner on the market?
Right, right.
I've actually always had that question
how just one company has
that dryer and
nobody else has one.
Then nobody else
sees what they're doing. I mean, every
hash maker either has
one or wants one.
It's really incredible. There's a couple
companies over in China and Europe
but they just make the
medical, pharmaceutical grade ones
and they're like
$5,000 to $7,000 to $40,000.
The Harvest Right,
I don't know how they got such
a low price point.
Well, it's
a Utah Mormon
thing.
It's owned by Scientologist Mormon
conglomerate?
That's right.
They're in Utah. I forgot about that.
It's right here in Utah. One of the things
Mormons do is they're in the business.
They're doing business with each other and
making things work.
Isn't all religion?
You know, when I think about it, going
back to growing up with all my Catholic
neighbors, there was definitely a business
interaction going on through the church
members.
Interacting at, for instance,
art workshops here and people who have left
the state come back and like, how come your tree service
isn't so successful? I'm like, I'm not
recommended by the ward.
Half of the people in the neighborhood
would never hire me because they only hire
the ward recommended
tree trimmer.
It's a tough
equation when it comes to that kind of thing
but I can pull the
card that my ancestors were Mormon but
they'd want me to show up to church
and it would fall down if I walked through the door
so I'm not going to do that.
Tell us
what you got going on there.
You heating up? You preheating things?
This is just
preheating right now up to 170.
I got some GMO flour
that is
still at 52%
but I'm going to see how it presses out. I don't think I'm going
to get rehydrated much more than that.
I'm really digging this
GMO. It's the Mimico seed
clone from archive.
The Chem Cookies
GMO.
That's why I think something like the cut
I've got, it says GMO
cookies on it and the
flavor that's coming out of it, is it
mature? Is it cures?
Man, this is delightful.
It's like
having some roasted garlic.
Yeah.
It's really, really beautiful.
Mine's got the slightest
of skunky undertone
in it.
Yeah.
When you roast garlic cloves and you have that
nice dark caramelized
skin on it. The caramelized, yeah.
You just eat that and it's like that
perfect sweet
burnt garlic.
I did that last night
I was doing it with, I was roasting
chicken in the oven so it was also
cooking in the chicken fat.
I had the nice
caramel.
I'm well-spotted so my genetics
are absolutely blown away by
garlic.
I just actually, I sold my
Nug Smasher OG
and I picked this up.
This is their XP.
It's a
4x6 inch plates, I think
or 4x7.
So hand pneumatics
and then it's got a tilt to it too?
No.
No tilt.
Yeah.
It does up to an ounce at a time which is
wow.
Look at that high def.
Look at that amazing internet
connection. I love the main
You guys have impressive internet service up
there.
Only here because we're surrounded
by billionaires.
That's what
Blue said.
Otherwise it would be like the other
day with Brian that Super Nintendo
Actually I
still have that graphic, hold on.
There we go.
Our 8-bit broadcast.
I was telling him and
the guy that doesn't talk
Standing coma.
Yeah I was telling them that they
look like the two Contra brothers.
Yeah.
I used to play that.
I think everyone used to play that.
I was like the game.
But yeah we just tear out
I mean this thing presses up to an ounce
I'm just going to do 14 grams.
And I haven't been getting
huge return off this.
I think it's probably better to wash
this and then press.
I was just about to ask.
Do you find that that's not consistent
with through every flower
that changes by strain?
Yeah.
Absolutely. I mean I have this
Royal Chem
that was coming from Greenpoint Seeds.
It was a cross of Purple Punch
and their
Star Dog.
And man that thing was pumping out 33%.
Just on flower rosin.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's a huge return.
There aren't a whole lot of cultivars that pump that out.
How fast do you like
to get your flower into the press
from harvest?
Oh.
I'm not really
a picky type of person.
So this has been out
of harvest probably about
six weeks or so.
I usually press
a few ounces
out of five, seven, ten
days after it's dried.
I've been hearing
some of these kids talking about
they want to have it pressed 12 days
after harvest.
Harvest it right into the freeze dryer
and then throw it into the freeze storage
until they press.
That's how they get in their Super Blondes.
That would be more
for washing though, right?
Not for straight pressed flower.
I think we talked
about this, but this may have been the
other night with Mr. Toad when I was super high.
You have a preference
for pressing flower.
Do you also wash it all?
I currently
have a preference for pressing flower
because I haven't really
gotten down a good procedure for washing
hash yet.
To be honest, I hadn't
had a
young enough product,
meaning
I'd let it
sit out too long so it oxidized.
The hash always comes out
really dark.
Oh my God, look at that.
There's a Mr. Toad.
All right, I got to go.
The honors are mine. Thanks for joining us, Tony.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, brother. How you doing, Cedric?
My man, how you doing there?
Good to see you.
Just moving forward, you know.
I hear you, brother.
I always like watching you press them nugs, man.
That shit comes out nice.
I just heard you guys talking about pressing either.
The nugs are washing.
I prefer washing to pressing.
You get a higher amount of return,
I believe, when you're doing that.
You kind of save on the terpene
because you can press at a lower temperature.
The reason it's so high is when you're pressing on the nugs,
when you're pressing nugs,
you kind of got to release that shit off the plant material.
When you're pressing a bubble hash,
it comes out. You can press at a way lower temperature
so you retain so much more terpene profile
off the plant.
I bought a wine fridge
to try and be
more economic than getting a freeze dryer
because, after all, I'm just doing this for personal use.
So, like, a $4,000
investment on a freeze dryer
for personal use doesn't
really work out.
You got some
additional weed smokers in the neighborhood,
though. Could you have the communal
unit for...
Yes, but
it wouldn't work out.
The co-op.
Yeah, the co-op's never work out.
Someone always
gets burned.
I'm getting a
phone call. It's killing my...
But, you know, this last
run of bubble hash that I did,
drying it in the wine fridge
made a
thousand percent difference.
You know, before I was
drying and curing it,
well, drying it, rather, in a tent.
You know, and I mean, I'm in the basement
with a dryer that doesn't
vent outside.
I got animals. I got kids.
You know, so there's a lot of
contaminants flying around in the air.
But that wine fridge,
nothing. It was beautiful. It stays at
41 degrees and, like, 45%
humidity.
I had a partner that used
to dry in a, like, a chest
freezer. He bought a small chest freezer
and he just built a set of racks inside
so he could pull the racks out and lay in layers
of bubble hash and let
the freezer just pull it all out before they started
using freeze dryers.
You know, whatever you can
to get that moisture out as quick as possible without
imparting some kind of flavor onto
those cannabinoids is the way to go.
We went from drying
with, like, light heat
to using these freeze dryers now
that just make you such a killer product.
You know? It's kind of
the opposite side of going with
live residents. Like when people
are cutting down live plants and trying to press those things,
you get so much moisture out of them.
It imparts a flavor through the chlorophyll
that's still left in the plant. But when you can yank that stuff
out fast through reduced
humidity, you end up with a plant
that tastes so much better.
Oh, yeah. It's crazy.
And just, you know, not that
color is always
a determining factor, but for
bag appeal, it certainly makes
a difference.
All the difference on bag appeal.
Yeah, and man,
the bubble... So this was a mix
of 45,
75, and 90
that I did the other night.
And just the...
Just even the shortness
in time of drying,
reducing the change or the
aging of the trichomes
from drying in the tent.
The oxidation from drying
in the tent. I mean, the product
was so much more
light.
Light-colored, yeah.
Just a beautiful, beautiful light color.
You see that question, can you use any
wine fridge? I mean, you can. You're better
off to use a
climate-controlled one that you can
change the climate on. But most...
You're trying to pull the most drought as fast as possible.
But most wine fridges,
you know, they're made for white wine, so they
keep them at a really cool temperature
anyways, so...
Yeah, but
you know, I did make... I made a
little mistake in buying one that was too
small because I didn't... I
wasn't sure if it was going to work.
But now, knowing that it works and how well it
works, I'm going to go buy a larger one
that I can put like a whole sheet
pan, like a full-size sheet pan in.
Nice.
Good to know. Yeah.
Yeah, I was... A little more economical.
No, that...
Going full bore with the Harvest Rite is
daunting for experimentation
for personal use.
It really is. And then, you know, I've
heard horror stories about like the
electronics going bad and... Right.
You know, the systems and then the customer
service, you know, which I
think customer service can go bad
with any business, you know, like...
Sure.
I've got other friends with other
businesses in the same building there
and that's where the local
seed, like
garden seed company
is at and they also do a lot of farm seed there.
And I've been in there talking with some
of those folks about like, oh man, this stuff
is back to Zurican and back from Colorado
or whatnot.
But over the years, it's Utah.
I got denied my
social security disability because I told
the doctor that I use cannabis instead of opiates.
And so, you know,
there's that whole spectrum of
who you're talking to when you're talking to them about what.
Well, if you want to make a little
trip up to Maine, we can go
protest on the corner of Julia Merck's
road.
She lives...
The Merck family, you know?
Merck Farms, Zutah.
Yeah.
We have...
Gosh, who's
the people?
The
family that makes the opiates.
They got a house here and they see up in Alta.
Yeah.
The Sackler
families are Utah
homeowners.
Kind of...
Yeah.
When you do,
keep spreading the word about how it helps.
You know, I'm a THCAA
guy. I tell everyone
to do it raw and
eat that stuff and make your pain
leave your body.
It takes me from wanting to
kill myself. I'm not suicidal, but
I've done how to stop the pain
and I eat a little capsule of raw cannabis
and 15 minutes later, like,
I'm able to do stuff again.
My body doesn't freeze up.
You know,
we are
90 to 100 years
behind on research.
Yeah.
To put that into perspective, like, the
internet was really a thing
when I was in high school, like, 94.
92, 94.
Just starting.
And look how fast it grew.
In 92, we didn't have
graphics-based internet. We had
text. If I wanted to research
science papers in college,
I had to have library
internet card specific
and it was, like, not even out of our college.
You could see abstracts
and that's about it. And you could order
the documents. But, you know,
now we can, like, ask the phone
a question and have 20,000
scientific documents in our
hand to answer the question.
No one will know the hate we carried for Dewey Desmal.
I had
the last
actual mechanical typewriters.
I had to learn typing on it.
I was doing research
with microfiche and shit back in high school,
man. Fucking passing slides across
fucking for hours and hours.
Swiping left, swiping left, swiping left
and ain't none of them come home with me yet, man.
That's some bullshit.
Fuck, man.
Every single one of us has
all the information available.
Mr. Bone free-floats
when he spouts his knowledge
for us.
It's not knowledge. It's just a collective of
information that I've decided to find
and try to collect into my mind here.
It's what I think everyone would do
on a situation.
You know, any situation you're in,
if you're a comic book collector, if you like
music or say you install
car stereos, most people try to dive
in as far as they can to learn as much about
that subject as they can without just
going stale on one of them.
That's just kind of how I've always done everything.
From anything I wanted to read about,
I just dove in as hard as I could.
If it's something you're not
actually doing, it's just information.
But if it's something you're doing, it becomes knowledge
and eventually it's wisdom because you've applied
it, right? And you know how well
the situation affects each other.
And that's a whole different thing.
It's like,
um,
I don't know.
There's things I
have a whole bunch of information about
but I don't have real knowledge
because I've never used it.
Right? And that's where you become
the veritable font of
useless information at that point,
as my professor used to say,
until you apply it.
But you definitely have wisdom with the plant
and its use, right?
And so it's a whole different
scale of somebody who's
just read these books in the last two years.
They have all this information
but they don't have...
They have no way to use it.
You've been given a line and a hook and a pole
and you don't know how to tie a knot to that sucker
or reel anything in or feel the fish at the end of that line.
You're just stuck with a fucking...
You're just on the fucking edge of the water
waiting and wishing.
Is it a fish or is it a piece of seaweed getting pulled by the tide?
Yep.
That's what comes down to being able to use
the knowledge that you acquire over time.
And when you're able to share
that with someone else and they don't have to go
the same failure route that you did,
that's where information
becomes knowledge. That's the difference
between being able to collect stuff and books
and be able to practice that information
and pass it to someone else so that they don't
have to fail also.
What are you doing? Half-ounce there, Cedric?
Yeah, this is 14 grams of
the GMO.
Right on.
This is a little non-bleached parchment paper.
That GMO's gonna dump for you.
Have you pressed her before yet?
I have, Tony, and you know what?
I actually... It's not
at the best
humidity.
It still presses out well
and the flavor is definitely killer.
But I'm not quite getting
the yield that I know I should
due to
the humidity of the flower.
I hear you.
You can't win every time, right?
We need
to get you that Congo in your hands.
Congo is a greasy girl.
She will spread oil everywhere, man.
She seems to hold the humidity
pretty well.
I would like that Congo, too.
Okay, we'll do it.
Peter, we'll do something.
I got some cuts that'll be coming out here very soon.
If you want one, just... All you gotta do is tell me,
Peter, and I'll get something to you, brother.
Same with Cedric.
Tony, you know
I'll take anything you want to send my way, man.
You know, anything.
That BB3 and that
cherry pie just exploded
in the last two days.
If they've done that,
the roots have started to just set
and they're sending out feeder roots everywhere.
Those things are gonna go ape shit on you.
It's gonna look like Jeremy's
fucking... What has he got there?
The earth boxes.
They're gonna fucking explode on you.
In the next 10 days, there's gonna be a crucial
point where you either flip
or you overgrow your rooms.
Then plants will take off.
Especially that Bruce Banner. That Bruce Banner could fill a hole
4x4 fucking easy.
Easy.
What about the stretch on those?
The Bruce is gonna stretch a little more than that
cherry pie. So the cherry pie is about
a 50% in there.
The Bruce Banner is gonna give you 75%
to 100% depending on light. You've got good light
so it shouldn't stretch too hard.
The Bruce Banner is gonna be closer
to a 50% to 75% stretch on you.
The Bruce is gonna be...
She's gonna look greasier
than that cherry pie does.
The cherry pie is gonna come across with
a more complex terpene profile.
So the high that comes off of that for me
is a more
efficient high for my chemistry
than the Bruce Banner. But everyone
I've passed out Bruce to loves her.
She's a killer man. Good smoke.
Did you see that question?
I did.
So I got it at
170.
And what's the micron size?
We're doing a 90 micron bag.
When you were talking about
bubbles, you said you did the 45,
70, and 90 on there.
Which one do you pull the least amount out of?
The 90, the 70, or the 45?
So I actually
mix those together, Tony.
You don't do them separate and then mix them?
You just do them all at one time?
I didn't have enough
of one single one.
I was just kind of
test running a small batch.
I got to that point too where I was dumping everything
in one bag because I was doing edibles and stuff.
When I separated for smoking,
my favorite bags were the 90
and the 75. That 90 used
to give me such a small return, but it was
the best producer of
cannabinoids for
glaucoma. I used to have this lady
that had one eye and her other eye, she was
100% blind and we used to give that shit
to her. She literally used to tell us
she could fucking see again after smoking that
shit. We were like, damn, man.
We didn't know she had one eye until the last year
she started coming in and she yanked her fucking
eye out on us in the shop and shit.
We were like, holy shit, man.
Why didn't you tell us you had one eye before?
You'd have all this shit for free.
We just thought you were bitching about not being able to see
shit, man. You literally don't got an eye on your head,
lady. Damn.
People will hold shit in for...
People will hold shit in way too long, man.
We would have gave that lady all the free herbs
she wanted if she'd have just told us she had one
fucking eye, man.
It's crazy.
Until we lost
the vendor of some of the other
hash products that we were able not to
produce for her. That's when she came in
and pulled her eye out and was like, I need this shit
for my eye. It was crazy.
But the 90 UNI bag
was always the one that helped her with her glaucoma
and eye pressure the most.
I'm just trying to see if that correlates to any
other people that make Bubble Hash.
If they've seen that same
correlation with any kind of patients
with glaucoma.
That thing's got a pressure dial on it.
No?
I'd say when I had my club
I had 4400 patients, so
I had the ability to find somebody that was
sick with something almost with any
condition. All I had to do was put up
something on the board and someone would
come in and be like, my daughter's got this
or I've been dealing with this for
15 years and then we would start
steering plants and cultivars to that
person if they would want us to.
Most people that are truly sick with something
really bad want the relief
from it like you were talking about. Like THCA
if you can take that pill and the pain goes
away, now you can do something.
You don't have to just sit there stoned to
try to get the relief. If you can efficiently
get rid of it with a plant
that produces the trichomes,
the cannabinoids, the terpene,
or whatever it is you're really getting
that medicinal effect from,
it's always better. So I used to take the plants
and steer whatever I was breeding through
that group of people. So someone with MS
I'd find more people and we'd group them together
and send plants to them that way.
Or if I, like the lady that was blind, I had
a lot of people with bad vision
but like she was the
top of the, she literally had
no eye on one side, she had so
many cataracts in the other one, it looked like
she was looking through parchment paper, man. It was
crazy. But when she smoked the
90U with almost any bubble hash
it always helped her out, man.
And if we'd had what you got going there right now
Cedric, during that time, we could have
been able to produce it on a
more pure level for her.
You know, it would have been so much better.
The more pure that medicine is
with getting rid of all the contamination that could be
in it, which is still in bubble hash, that's why
you know, that's why we filter it out.
We'd be able to just give her
so much better product.
So I did bump
the heat up a little bit
because it wasn't really forcing it out.
So I bumped it up to
185, which
you know, I've had a lot better
luck with pressing between like
185 and
195 for
most cultivars.
But you can see it's starting to bubble out now
here. Yeah, on flower I usually
have to hit like 190 myself.
That's why I go to bubble hash. The bubble hash will
press at a far lower temperature
and you can use a smaller
micron bag if you need to.
It's not going to contaminate as much
but flower is, like,
flower is where it's at. That's where it's all starting.
So if you can get your flower down
pressing your bomb.
If your flower dumps also, you also know
you're going to pull all kinds of bubble hash
off that plant if you do decide to wash it.
Did you use
them on those little mini washing machines
Zone? That's what I use
now because I'm in the wheelchair so I have to
use a small 5 gallon washer but I used to have
a 40 gallon washer that I built
out of a floor standing drill
press. The ones that you could get at
Harbor Freight that have the variable speed
bands inside. So I would
set it to the lowest possible speed as
possible and then I would stick one of
the, right on.
That shit looks nice.
I would take one of the paint mixer
blades and stick the paint mixer
blade in the end of the drill press and
then I had a 45 gallon
water softening barrel so
it was a food grade plastic and
I would use that with a gang valve
on the bottom of the
unit. It's on my YouTube page. I don't know
if Peter can pull it up but it shows me
my system there. I used to be
able to dump
like a 20 gallon tote
in there and do all that at one time.
Just straight up in my thing. Dumping it all
through 5 gallons. I could probably wash a pound
of hash in about 45 minutes.
With the end product being a pound. Not
the flour ahead of time. I'd end up with
a full pound of bubble hash. So I used
to run an edible company called 215
Farms. So I was making
a pound to 3 pounds of hash
a month just for doing edibles.
I mean non-stop.
I always had to have hash here.
Just quickly is it
44 bones?
4-4
big bone 4-4.
Yeah, sorry. Big bone 4-4.
That's it.
There's a picture
of me standing next to a
hash machine. Let me see. I think it says
Hashmaker.
That's the bubble hash.
Right on. Yeah, I love
bubble hash.
I love hash
period, man. I grew up on hash.
Some of the first stuff I ever smoked
was blonde Lebanese hash.
I was smoking that shit since I was probably
9 years old. I'm trying to think
when my mom bought that shit.
It would have been before. It would have been
78 to 81 when we picked that shit up.
Because we moved here in 1981
and we had it
when we lived at the other house.
So that would have been probably 78.
We moved here in 78.
We picked it up off this cat. He was a Harley dude.
He fucking rode for the Hell's Angels
and shit. This dude named Gene Brown.
He fucking died back in 1980.
He got fucking killed in a car
accident. My other mother
used to always talk shit with him.
He'd always talk shit about he could get this
and I could get that. He'd always talk
shit he could get anything. So she's like, bring me some
hash, motherfucker, and just quit talking.
One day he shows up with 5 kilos
of fucking blonde Lebanese hash wrapped in
pink silk with a stamp gold on top.
My mom had to fucking
come up with the cash to pay for it because she
was talking shit and he was talking shit and he showed
and proved so she didn't look like a fool.
She bought that shit. We had
that shit until we ended up getting busted. The cops
ended up taking it. But that blonde Lebanese
hash was about the color of that parchment paper
you're fucking with right there.
Real tan. We used to call it
fucking camel shit or baby poop.
The color of it. It would get you so
fucking high. Burned kind of like
incense. It didn't do a full melt
but it was so
fucking good in the complex high you'd get
it would literally
take the legs from underneath you.
If you smoked too much of that shit you would not
know that you could not walk until you tried to walk.
It's like a dry grainy
teeth.
Shit is good, man.
I get different
trichomes that
never press into oil at all.
It stays grainy just like
that. Even with my high grade.
I do pretty much all dry sift.
Yeah, the afku
that I have is extremely
dry like that. The trichome
feels like sand on that plant.
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty tough, man. It's really hard
to make a tempo ball with it.
You gotta use a heat press of some sort
to get it to stick.
And that's what I mean without
any plant matter. It really
presses down to skinny little
pucks from that big chunk.
Look at that.
What I do with the bubble hash is I take
and I press that like Cedric Choo's
and I set that sucker to 120 or lower
and I take my bubble hash
and I press the bubble hash
just to activate it.
Like the old style where people
cats used to put their hash in their
fucking shoe with saran wrap and walk around
with it for a day or two.
Just to activate it. So I do that with
the press. I'll take the press, I wrap it around
the hash with some parchment paper
and I just very, very lightly
pull the press down on it until it's just
contact and let it stay heated up there for
10 or 15 minutes and then I'll pull the
patty off, refold it a few times,
stick it back in there and heat it
and I'll do that shit and then take those
and put them back in the freezer for storage.
Keep them in jars.
But this way the plant doesn't oxidize
you're activating the oils repeatedly
over and over and you start getting this
it'll change the flavor of your plant.
You get trichomes
or the terpenes start to become
way more complex.
You start pulling these crazy chocolate flavors
out of some of your cultivars
that never had them before just from
the aging of those
and the pressure
that you're adding to the cannabinoids
and the terpenes.
I got some hashes coming on
the 60 years.
Hell yeah.
The oldest I've had was from Mean Gene
and Frenchie. They had some 5 year old
stuff at the cup in 2014
and I picked some of that up from them
and that shit was killer.
I've got a couple of 2 year old
balls that I'm just going to let
The longer they go
the better man. Keep them oxidizing
and they just get better.
I set them out until they get
the good
oxidized
surface and then I'll put them into a cell
thing and suck the air out
and put them in a cold dark storage
spot like wine.
Exactly.
That's a pretty good pull there Sid.
I mean it may not be
the numbers you hit on some of the other ones
but just
the quality of that stuff is going to be so
kill. Yeah when you
have a 33%
return on a flower
everything else is like
aw man.
The return isn't always
what it's about though. Like I said the effect
that comes off that plant. Say you were an MS
patient and the product you were using
you pulled 33%
of it off of there and it doesn't do
anything to help you with your
pain but then you've got another cultivar
that only gives you 10% and it
100% removes all your ailments.
That's where we come down to
breeding efficiently for these cannabinoids and
terpene profiles. You're like the
number one silver lining guy
Tony. Well this is what we're
talking about on the medicinal side of cannabis.
Everybody's looking at this stuff as a way
from the old way like the
hydrocats way that was just trying to push
weight on people. We
know now that the green part of the
plant unless we're selling fiber or fuel
isn't doing shit for someone
that's sick except for the fact
that they can grow it. That's the part that's positive
for someone that's sick. But those
terpenes and cannabinoids and flavonoids
those are what we need to
make our ailments quit
fucking being ailments. So once
we learn which ones work now it's a
it's a fight to find which
cultivars have these percentages
on the numbers that we want so when we grow
them we're not wasting any of our
garden space for anything besides
the medicine we're after.
So when you're growing for your own
medical needs or
somebody who's dying next to you
you don't just grow what's hype you grow
what works for them and it don't matter if that shit's
called fucking fuck Tony
I'll grow it all damn day if it helps the
person next to me dying you know what I mean.
That's just how it is and it doesn't matter
the percentage that I pulled off it if it doesn't
work for the people that I'm trying to help.
There's even
some of the stuff the green and the purple
and the leaf is actually medicine too.
If you do a cold extract
that chlorophyll in
a what I call FICO the raw
extracts. The flavonoids and stuff in there
you know. Yeah both
the actual chlorophyll
is an antioxidant
and a anti-inflammatory
so if you've got that in a raw
form when juicing those things
or the
anthocyanins as well. Those things
when they're raw and haven't been heated and
cooked or whatever are
amazing full body medicines
for sick people when they ingest
it as a food.
There's definitely so much more
that we need to explore as well
these different. Some of what I
hit on about talking about why we want to
explore the land races is they've
got medicines in it. They were
field. We were chasing
THC when the botanist
went and collected plants and certain
growth forms and things like that.
They were bag of peel.
Sometimes it's those runny little non
producers that might have that
profile that specifically
helps a group of
ailments.
It's like
the breeders of the
now day breeders are kind of practicing plant
genocide which has happened
over centuries when a human decides
that that food source or this
plant in that area should be used for something
and then we over farm it or we breed it
to the wrong direction and then we end up with a plant
that's nothing like the original and then
we can never go back to get that original.
When we start looking at those land races
and heirlooms what we're finding in those
are what's made cannabis
so great. It's that whole
complex amount of
cannabinoids. Even if we only find one that has
just CBG in it. We
know CBG is a precursor
to THC and CBD. If we
can put that into our plant now that we have ability
to possibly bring out a hidden
cannabinoid that our plant's
breeding recessively and
possibly bring this out as a
dominant trait now in the plant.
That's how you go from having a high
THC cultivar cross to a CBD
cultivar that now gives you a one to one
that you can blind breed into
a true one to one that will pass that
trait every time which wasn't there.
We start losing it when all we go
for is that THC or if we only want
to have a citrus profile on a plant because
we start finding out that citrus
or the candy. They only carry
certain cannabinoids with them efficiently
along with those terpenes and sometimes
they do not work with another person. A person
that might need something that's carried
along with a mycern instead of a
carfiline. The THC
that's carried with that along
in the process while it's being built
makes that work more efficiently for those
types of people and I found that
through my brother
Cam stepbrother that
has a Dravet syndrome when they started using
specific terpenoids along with the
CBD to start to make those
CBDs work more efficiently for his
seizures and shit. You can
drive those cannabinoids into a person's
system by using a
terpene as the key instead of just the cannabinoid.
A lot of people
don't know that. It can be multiple keys
one turns this thing and
our bodies are very complex.
There's so much going on and
I like
to say with the TCA, you take that
and your body will adjust it to
Delta 9 as it needs it.
It processes it to the next. If you just
take Delta 9, then you only have the Delta 9
and it's oxidized form
after you process it.
What kind of things do you think
we've lost in that
transition of cultivation?
More than you could even imagine brother.
Just more than you could imagine.
Because we didn't know like the
CBD and CBG, the
non-psychoactive cannabinoids.
How hard was it for a
person to equate what that was doing
for them when they were
probably using multiple other plants
to try to also affect that problem
that they had. So when
it didn't have the psychoactive effect on the mind
the person for a while
did not realize. We did the same thing.
How long did it take to find out that CBD
with all of the breeding that
people are doing with cannabis around
the globe right now to decide
that THC really by
itself is an antagonistic
product that's not going to help that
many people unless you carry it
across with something else. That's why
THC in
raw form is not a giant thing in the
cannabis community. They can make it
but nobody's out there buying that shit
because you just turn into a raging asshole
fucking on pure THC with
nothing else.
You know so it took so
long for us to figure that out. You have to
imagine that all we did was kill off
so that's what I said plant genocide
the amount of varietals
that were out there or even chemovars
that had something special that we didn't
recognize because we're too busy breeding for
a color or something
visual or a smell
instead of looking for the whole plant
complex that we want
we want that entourage effect. It comes from
all of it not just some of it.
Well you know Andrew, you look at these
old stories you know if you want
to go like bible stories of
Jesus using the
anointment oil to
you know to cure
blindness and to cure all these ailments
and you know that was what how
many thousands years ago and
now. There's frankincense and myrrh in there too
which are together a couple more very potent
plant medicines.
My brother uses that with his
CBD treatment
for seizures. He uses frankincense.
It helps. It's
so hard to tell people how much
that helped when he switched to using
frankincense oil along with CBD
on how much better the
results he got from not having
seizures it became. It was insane.
Right.
It's very very potent. I make
a can of Boston and I put
a drop of it in the
a cup of orange juice and my entire
body biome just
like goes whoa.
Like I only use it for special
like if I'm sick. It's so potent.
I'll give that to the cancer patients
as part of their treatment or some of the
other folks that I help.
A little bit of cinnamon,
frankincense, myrrh,
very little like a 2%
feco and coconut
and olive oils, but I make mine out
of and this is just
I use a mortar and pestle
to grind it all into super fine and
that's one where I activate it. I eat the
whole thing and simmer it for a couple of days.
But the
biblical story is something like
it's something like
6 pounds of weed to 5 pounds
of olive oil.
But what I'm saying is beyond just the
oil, the cultivars that they
use, do you know like those
aren't even around or anything
similar to that. So imagine
if that's just imagine
okay for say
that that story was true
that there was 6 pounds of
cannabis that you could make
oil out of.
That oil is real.
That oil is real even if you don't go to the
Bible. But I'm talking
about the actual curing
of blindness.
It comes down to the fact
that those things were actually
real things that happened because
we know this plant and
the real secret is they're still
in the cultivars we possess today.
We just don't pop enough seeds to
find that mutation to carry
it on to the next generation because
we're too busy selling people shit named after
desserts that look like
exploded ass fucking trichomes on a page.
We're not breeding and searching
for the medicinal side of the plant.
It's there. We gotta find it.
They're calling their runs to begin with.
They're calling their runs when they're in seedling
stage and those are the ones where those medicines are
going to be found.
We totally like that stuff
not even in our...
People hate on me because I continue to breed with
stuff that got dicks.
I cannot out breed the potencies
and the terpenes.
You get this stuff without
where mine's at after
60 years and three
people breeding this to where it's at.
It kills pain. It kills Tourette's.
It kills all these things. You just gotta
pay attention. It's got a little possibility of
having a bald drop at 14 to
21 days. That don't matter.
That don't matter. That just comes down to being a patient
in your garden. Get rid of it.
Keep on... If it works for the medicine,
I don't care if every flower on there shows
minocious traits and I have a perfect
flower and I've got homorphidites showing everywhere.
I will fucking stay... I'll go in
there every day to yank that shit.
That's what my grape wreck was. After day 56
the tops of every crown of the bud
would start shooting out single stamina
flowers and all you had to do was go in there
and take them out if you were running anything longer than 8
weeks and you didn't have any issues
because you could time the day that
shit happened. But that plant was...
We killed that plant since 1988
when I was... When I just first got into
high school was the first time I ever remember running into
that plant. And the guy that had it
before that, who knows how long he had it.
It was an old train wreck that he had
from fucking who knows how long.
I just know that dude was a whole generation
older than I was that brought it around our group.
And we
all did the same thing. Like if it started
throwing that stamina flower at the end
we all were in that room yanking
that out of there or we learned not
to put nothing else in the room with that that could be
affected by that stamina flower which
solved all the problems. Don't
grow any 12 weekers in the room with this
8 weeker and you wouldn't end up stalling out the
12 weeker because of any pollination issues.
So people when you
run into these things, it's in essence
pretty much every flower
and that's what some people say for using for feminizing
is just let it grow long and eventually
it's going to put one of those little nanos
a single little yellow
pollen. A lot of those don't even produce pollen.
And so you want to be careful
if you go through and poll them though, there might be
you might dislodge it by grabbing it. So you
want to keep a little moisture on hand to
disrupt its structure and keep it
from being solid. But that's
all part of having some of these really good
true medicines that you're not going to get
in the commercial environment
because they're not going to spend that time
and energy. They don't want nothing to do with that
and there's
so much diversity that
we could lose. And my
introductory ramble I
talked about the breeding
issues that
makes me think about these things
when forestry with the Monterey pine
that we all see in the Lord
of the Rings movies with all the
dead pine trees in New Zealand
and that literally they bred
a production pine tree
from a... people
wonder like why do you call wild plants land race?
It's like well the land race of
Monterey pine is the wild trees
that grow in California
and the slightest hand of man
Native Americans burned
and it was a fire evolved tree
but they said let's
breed this into instead of
125 or 200 year rotation
pine tree and
someone bred it into 20 years
they call it R20 and
they planted millions of
these trees in Australia. They bred out completely
all of the disease and bug
resistance. So 7 to 10 years
into the millions of trees being planted
all over New Zealand they all
died. And that's
what if we're not paying attention with our
breeding that's what we can do
on any of these
trades any of these medicinal
practices. If you're
just going to that THP and now we have
a million
tons of plastic netting going into the landfill
every year because we have big flowers and
no stems.
So we look to our land race
for that kind of stuff in my opinion to
strengthen our plants back up and
breed that back in.
100%. Pest resistance
mold resistant because they're
cultivars that are being created
through nature and being steered epigenetically
to the environment there.
If you go to a place that's high
in moisture you're going to end up with a plant
that has traits now that have been
activated by the environment to start to
live in that environment
you can breed that back into the shit. We can
get it back in there. We just have to take
the time to do it. It's going to have to be kind of a group
effort. Like if I find a cultivar
in my garden that really isn't conducted
from my area but it can work
somewhere else that's in a moist
place or somewhere that's extremely arid
the best option would be to try to
get that into the hands of someone that can actually
work that into that line in that area
so now that you can express those traits
from that cultivar specifically
from that exact
same plant now that can be extended
out into line breeding into other lines
to carry those traits in the other plants
that do not carry it.
One of my greatest laments
being that I'm in this little island
of my own little
in the desert here under my rock right
now I'm I've lifted my rock
up and I'm interacting but I still
I don't have people to
hand those cuts to and I literally
chop 50
80 amazing
things that I've sifted
out of a thousand or so
seeds each year. It's like man
I really that's one of the reasons I started sending
out the
board 13 that I'd like to get
people to spread around and see what it can do for folks
The Breath of Red Dragon is out
there now and everyone who's gotten
that I would hope would share it
and keep on sharing it.
I think it's
got potentials to help a lot of people
with PTSD specifically
it's got that wonderful skunk trait to it
it washes some great
hash too
and
people I think are going to make some great
crosses from it too.
That's the first one I put out there.
What's that?
Is that what we got there?
The cherry pie?
Yep, right on. She's growing fast.
Nice.
Yeah, yeah.
Sharing around is definitely a good idea.
I'm bringing them outside right now.
Right on, right on.
Just don't put it in direct full sun
that way the UV light doesn't destroy
that f***ing epidural layer and the wax
is on there.
Yeah, I've been teasing it.
I've been giving it like morning
sun and late afternoon
sun. I mean one time I think
I got a little too much.
And then this is the
Breath of Red Dragon 13.
Right on.
It was pretty scraggly when I sent it.
I'll get you a
Congo too.
I'll get a Congo too.
And what I want to do, I should send you one of my space cheeses.
I've only sent the space cheese
to Michigan. It's only one cut's ever
gotten out.
I want to try to get my original.
No, you don't have the space cheese.
It's a
You got Cherry Pie and Bruce Banner over there.
My space cheese I sent to
it's in Detroit right now.
My tester bunch should be
in Loud Tomatoes.
Right on.
So anyway, I'll be back.
What were those testers you sent me, Tony?
The testers I sent you are a cross
of
Bruce Banner number 3 and
space cheese.
The Bruce Banner number 3 is
the mom, which I sent you a clone of.
And then the space cheese
male, which Peter was showing some
of that stuff yesterday. He'll probably show
some again if we're talking about it here.
Bruce Banner space cheese.
And why I sent you the Bruce Banner along with
the tester seeds is I want to
get the tester's opinion on the
actual mother line that I used
to create that cross.
This is something I wish a lot of people do
when they're doing their testing and not just in their own
garden. If you're going to send out seeds
to people to get pictures for your Instagram
feed, why not send along something
else I can get information to add
to those posts. So when I send you
the Bruce Banner number 3 and you grow her out,
you're going to come back with your own opinions
on it. How the smoke is, how she
grew, the structure of the plant.
Now you grow its progeny
and in the progeny, you're
going to be able to start to recognize some of
the traits that came from that mother
because you actually grew the mother.
So instead of just guessing by descriptions
online of what Bruce Banner
number 3 is, a strawberry diesel plant,
you're going to automatically start
thinking it's going to have specific traits
and structures because of what you've read about diesel
and strawberry plant that
you believe is in there. Instead of me
passing you the mother...
Wisdom.
What you do is you take the mother plant,
you send the mother plant over and now
you find out in your garden, maybe
she doesn't produce any strawberry and she's all
diesel from the inputs that you put in
there, right? Because what's in your garden...
...mine is different from yours and different from his
and different...so it's going to be
different. It's going to be different
because of the enzymatic action
coming from the bacteria and the indigenous
microorganisms in your setup.
This drives the terpene...
you were talking about terpene profiles earlier.
It doesn't matter what inputs you drop
on top. It matters more
of what's being turned into
a nutrient from that
input by what's in the
rhizosphere. So the fungi and
bacteria that are there that are available
and everyone has different ones because of
indigenous microorganisms in the area
because of what Leighton says,
we don't have these micro-grational
drifts of animals anymore so
where you're at does not have microbes where
I'm at. So the way you grow
even if we use the same kelp
and we use the same fucking fish
meal and we use the same bed and same
tent and light, it's still going to come out different
because of two things that
I consider. One is what's in the soil
and the other one is what's in the heart
of the farmer, right? The way
you go into that garden and
input yourself is going to affect
everything that happens.
That also affects what's going on
in that rhizosphere. That rhizosphere now
starts to break down everything that you put in there.
If you don't have a phosphorus
dissolving
bacteria in there, you're not going to get
the same phosphorus levels that my garden's
getting if I have those in my garden, right?
Or say you got a cover crop that
makes a nitrogen fixing bacteria,
I don't add that to my garden.
I start ending up with a nitrogen fucking
slip towards the mid of flower
and I start dumping it on there
because I need nitrogen and now I affect
the plant by increasing the amount
of singular input nitrogen and now
she starts to homorphonate on me.
When I could have just had it in the soil correctly.
What it all comes down to is if I
send you the mom and the progeny,
you're going to be able to recognize
what's happening in the progeny and
the mother line better. You're never going to
be able now to pop 10 seeds and go, I found
a mom in the fucking F1s because
you did not find a copy of the mother
in the F1s, you just found a plant that has
some of the traits from her. Even if I
S1 that fucking mom, you're not going to find
a copy of her because it's an S2.
It's really an F2 when you make an S1.
It's better to teach
someone about plants and growing by
teaching them how to become a farmer
and you do that with cannabis
by me offering you a cut of the
mom along with the tester line
so that you can understand
that maybe the
mother line likes a lot of
magnesium but when I put that on the progeny
it's having fucking issues so maybe
that's coming from the father line
or maybe I
have a phenotype that's expressing
something completely different in a garden
like your gardens there you can put them in multiple
spots and see you can take cuts and find out
the Bruce hates this spot over here
that's extremely dry, right?
It's a way for you to find the information
about a plant that you can only find
that information from either listening to someone who's
done it and being open minded
reading about it on a forum and
trying to decipher the bullshit
or to actually do it
yourself which is the only way I
feel a person mostly
in these days and age of the meme generation
will learn and listen to anyone
is they actually have to experience it
in their hands. They don't want to
listen to anyone else tell them that we did
this for fucking 15 years it's this way
I'm not trying to be the asshole and
give you the information I'm trying to be the dude
that passes the knowledge that we
have collected you're gonna fail
doing that man and I don't want to see you
fail so if I give you that information
you know
then you're gonna be fuck man I did it
I know it and now I can spread it
you'll understand and then your next
grow when someone tries to say something to you you won't
take it as negatively you might
be more open minded with it and it's gonna
make you and your garden better all because I
sent an extra plant with a pack of seeds
instead of just sending seeds to you to say
I need pictures at week five so I can sell
more seeds on the site
because that's what testing is these days people
are just trying to get fancy
pictures so that people will go I want
to buy that pretty ass plant nobody's
asking what did it affect the person with
you know what was going on
not knowing that they're also not
gonna get that exact plant
no every seeds a different phenotype
do you especially like people
think I asked one like sf VOG
and all the seeds are sf VOG
instead of knowing you just made a
feminized f2 so in
f2 you're gonna expressions of everything
that's in that parent line so
you get a male that made that
play you could technically get
something that expresses as
looking like a male it it's gonna
be hard you know it's gonna have
a
yeah
yeah
the male due to
the nutrient levels in the soil
and the temperature in the first two weeks of
termination and yeah
dodging this ethylene and a
black acid levels in that plant so
now it starts to express as either a male or
female even though naturally
it was going to be a female
you fucked up and somehow
changed you sprayed that plant with something
and it had something that replaced the
copper at a crucial time
and now the ethylene cannot be passed to the
system and now she builds up
GA3 and shows as a male and you're
like how did I get a male out of these fem seeds
and it came down to maybe you had
that plant too close to your co2 burner
that's a propane tank and the propane tank
went out and started to off gas too much ethylene
through the unburnt propane
and now a male in the room
switches and looks like a female
and now you think you have a homophodite male
and you know there's different
things that can happen in a garden
back in the day we did not understand
I've definitely gotten males
out of feminized seeds
you can get those 100%
what happened was temperature
and I think phosphate
in the medium is
what affects that
primarily
my first understanding of this comes from a hemp
study in the early 90's
before cannabis was able to be studied
just starting in on genetics and they found
that there was two
types and one would have
a male marker that expresses male
and there was one that did not have male markers
that expressed as male and that's exactly what
the bone just described to us
how the ethylene shuts off
and
I probably have that
I have that study in my files I believe
I know I shared it back in the day
on PFA
but I haven't seen it
in several years
we start looking for stuff
it gets buried in those 26,000 results
on your google
I just found 30 other cool
things I want to read before I, what was I looking
for?
there's a lot of information
I started
dropping every time I find one I'd instantly
share it to my google drive but I forgot
to rename them every time so
there's 40,000
of them that the name of them is
004799473
and I'm like well I gotta
go through and read the whole fucking page again
just to find out what I was after
I finally started realizing
I have to name the file
after the topic that I'm
actually fucking saving it for
so if I'm saving it for feminization
I write feminization with a number after
it so it saves it in that file
because man I lost so much shit that
way I've got so many google drive
options it's crazy trying
to dig through there to find that information
you have to start memorizing the name of the author
and the publication of that paper
the title that's just the only way to do it
it's hard
it's hard but that's
the only way I can learn
when we had the forums and we didn't
have all the like the face groups
were really great for the fact that
people like me and yourself and other guys
in the group they had knowledge that had been
sitting on it for years and weren't able to share it with
anyone and even if it was right or
wrong as soon as someone shared it we
were able to take that and go double check it somewhere
else or to see if it lined up with
our information or with anyone else's information
everyone else would comment on it
and battle it out?
yeah it expanded shit everywhere and like
the dummies started taking us off
for information as us being assholes
and trying to fight with them instead of taking
it as what science is
and then when one guy offers his information
we all absorb it and then we offer our
information and then when we go find out all of our
information was wrong but those
that set of information all sent us in the right
direction right? everyone else got
too busy fighting over shit and that's why a lot of
the groups fell apart and then all
the information got scattered because everybody
was too worried about being the person that shared the
information instead of being
more worried about why we started to find
information in the first place was a thirst for
knowledge about a plant that we all loved
if we would all remember just that part
it gets rid of the feeling
part everyone reads a comment and says it
sounded like you did it I didn't sound
anyway when I typed that man I just typed
it out and it was a response
if people would just
take that in is that that paper right there?
yeah that's silver
this is the one you shared
last night that we didn't get to
so I thought we could be
key take
actually let me make it bigger
we all come to
our point in space from different
perspectives and so
six might appear to be a nine except for
when it was written as a six by the author
that's what it meant to be
right? and so that's
it gets pretty
tough when people can't figure out that
this is a six and not a nine
what we got?
ah yeah so how I can
yeah this is the use
of silver to regulate ethylene's production
in a plant and how it's done that
so when you're using silver to
spray a female and this only
works on the female cannabis plant
silver has the
effect of replacing
copper in the production
of ethylene so when the copper
is replaced with silver
or cobalt what happens
is you have the effect of masculine
because the
ethylene level which is supposedly really
high in a female as opposed to the
jubilic acid when you
spray it with silver jubilic acid
starts to build up in the plant because the
ethylene is not able to be absorbed
in the tissue of the plant because it does not have
that copper element
to bind it to the tissue in the
plant because you've replaced copper with
silver that's why we'll start to spray the plant
prior to going into flower as it
goes into flower and transitions that female
starts to produce more ethylene and more
copper through the system those
two things together help regulate
the female expression
that we see so
we may see it as a male because
we accidentally fucked up and
sprayed it with silver and now
we have suppressed the amount of ethylene in that plant
and now it builds up jubilic
acid ratio higher than the ethylene
ratio and it hits a crucial threshold
which now produces stamina
flowers on that female now
you do the opposite with a male but you have
to spray the male with ethylene
male produces copious amounts of jubilic
acid so to get around that
we tried to change the androgynous
levels of ethylene that that
male produces by actually adding
some to the environment so we
now create a plant that had one
phenotypical expression of being a male
to show another one
of a female by altering
the environment and the
cues that they drive so now that you
add ethylene there are markers
in a plant traits that are
driven through the epigenetics
through the genetics that it holds
that are going to be swayed based
on the actual environment
that happens like instantaneously
so on an annual to be able to spray it
on day 20 and have
it show go from being a male
to a female
this should show everybody out there
that there are certain traits that
a breeder no matter how hard he works on
doing a line he's never going to
be able to stabilize because
these things are driven through epigenetic
cues and markers
that have to do with
photohormones and just the
plant hormones that they produce these are plant
growth regulators people get them
confused with plant growth
retardants which are what everybody
uses to make the plant purple from
synthetic shit those aren't actually
plant growth regulators those are plant growth
retardants they get it backwards
instead of plant growth regulators actually a hormone
produced by the plant we
cannot grow any organic or
synthetic plant without a plant growth regulator
ethylene, abscisic acid
juboic acid
uh, oxins
and ethylene these are the five major
plant growth regulators and if we
sway one
ratio compared to the other we can affect
how that plant branches how it shows its
sexual expression how it roots
we can change its
phenotypal expression almost instantaneously
through enzymes
and hormones this is what people
that we call noobs don't
understand because they haven't grown the plant
long enough and they don't ever talk about this in their
favorite publications because
they don't have anyone in there that's spent too
long in a basement trying to figure this shit out
or somebody that actually went to school
you're hitting into a topic that I
wanted to get into where
um, where I do some pretty extreme
stress testing and I know that gets
talked about in some other channels about
the, some of the
extreme levels
I take stuff to where I have the opportunity
to test plants at down below
20 degrees and see how they respond right
nothing anyone normal would
ever think of doing for on
purpose but there's people whose entire
crops have been saved because I said
hey, don't freak out
you're gonna have this much damage
at that temperature level and
they didn't choke and they saved a hundred
acre hemp farm and
because I've done that kind of stuff I can tell
them but
um, people
I may, and I know some people have been doing
extreme or have been doing stress testing all
along, we may be taking things to such
an extreme to where we're
um, pushing those
regulators like you're
talking about, um,
way beyond what's normal and
sometimes that's good but
we can make any plant do
this and so
sometimes doing
that to observe which ones do that's all you
necessarily need to do and you can back off and
understand that you can still select
one of these ones that freak out in extreme
conditions, it's not gonna freak out like
that under normal conditions
and then you can put that
in your understanding with you
relate to people what it is that you put out
there, the product of a seed and what
you went through to do that selection
but definitely like
one of the ones that really brought me to think of this was
kids ask me about, um,
I was testing with cold water for roots
for people in Alaska get cold water
and uh, and they said
everything freaks out and I lose it and I'm like, man I got cold
water and I started giving that some real
thought and it's like, well, actually
in my E-Mix systems and those nutrient
film tables, I've had
where the film top freezes over
and there's literally ice growing in there
and they're, they never
freak out from that because that's part of their slow
cycle adjustment and they've adapted
to that but if you just shock a warm
room with frozen water, that's
a whole another story and you're going to freak any plant
out. It's going to think it's winter time and we
just had a snow storm and it's time for me
to reproduce or die. And so
it's going to send it into a
it's going to put off a hermaphrodite.
Yes, but you've changed the androgynous
hormone level from that shock. That shock
instantaneously has told that plant, I either
I'm going to have to produce more obsessic acid
which means it's time to die, right?
That's what obsessic acid is. It's
the aging hormone. So the more
that builds up in the plant, the closer
that plant is to the end of its death in
an annual. So that snow
storm or that too much water all of a
sudden caused some issues in the
root exposure
to the rhizosphere and now
you ended up building up too much of a hormone
down there that affected the hormone above
and that plant does that shock you're talking about
so you end up with a hermaphrodite or a plant
that starts to just, it just stops
producing and slowly dies on you
and each cultivar can do that different.
Some of them will produce more purple
and the bud stops growing
but you'll get a lot of purple and a lot of trichome
coverage. That's a reaction to the
stress. Some of those plants
are going to fucking just start straight
up hermaphroditing on you and try to
pollinate whatever the hell's around them
because it needs to live. It's
it has been told by nature
through certain cues that it I
need to live again or I'm
never going to live again and those are the cues
that that's what's driving epigenetics.
Yeah, it
really sunk in working with my turquoise
dragon too. This kind of
I was pushing it to certain
stress levels and then
I had a timer failure that
really pushes beyond and
I did end up getting
stuff that did not react.
So I'm going to continue
to push both those
potatoes and see.
Nice.
Nice geodes.
We get some pretty good geodes out here.
Crystals.
I've never picked up an amethyst.
You gotta stop that man.
You gotta wall that back up.
Every freaking time.
Nice.
You got crystals?
You got crystals for
Chad? Hold on, I got
something for you here.
That's a beautiful amethyst.
Yeah, my
wife is a herbalist
and she has a massive
collection of crystals and she's
quite a talented herbalist.
She's pretty special. She has all sorts of
Oh Jesus.
This is a crystal
from Mount Shasta over here.
The Mount Shasta area where Castle Craig's is.
The guy
that taught me how to clone when I was
eight years old found this and
gave it to my mom.
Mine's bigger than yours, Cheddar Mom.
That's a nice cluster.
We're gonna put this in the soil
and make something special happen.
We don't want Peter Longpipes to pull out
his crystal.
I was living in
Yosemite and I had a partner
at Rock Climb with me and he knew I was into
crystal hunting and he's like, oh man
I know where there's some crystal mines
and let's go sneak down there at night
and grab some.
So I go in there, partner into this mine
and I realized years later this wasn't
a crystal mine. We were poaching it
on someone's gold mine.
He had me along
swearing we were just after crystals
as soon as we got caught.
We were in the
headwall in this muck
zone and literally he's in there
pulling ore out and stuff
in a bag and he's like, okay
grab my ankles and hold on and if I yell
the whole thing collapsed
on him and I'm pulling him out of the muck.
It was
20 years later when I realized
he wasn't collecting
crystals.
We have a lot of watermelon
tourmaline in Maine.
A lot of tourmaline.
That's beautiful stuff.
Yeah, I guess it's fairly
sought after.
It's pretty.
Why not?
Shiny things. We're a bunch of crows.
You know,
people talk about whether
crystals have energy or not or
whatnot. When you understand
the entire topic I'd like
to bring up one day is just discussing crystal
structure of the particles of stone
that we utilize, right?
Clay is a crystal
and it has the power
of our soil. It's got the
CEO's choice, right?
It's got a negative charge
and so there's things going on
there. With a quartz crystal itself,
piezoelectric, you strike
it with a shock and
it puts off an electric charge. That's
how we have those push button
starters for our stoves and our
barbecues, right? There's definitely
energy. Everything is energy. There is no
solid anything, right?
When you align those crystals,
the molecules in that structure
can amplify what that energy
is. Beyond that,
everything
comes from our mind.
Our thoughts create our reality, what we focus
on. We were talking about the
tensions of our garden
when we go into it.
We create our reality with our thoughts
and stuff. If we have a crystal that we focus
on our thoughts and we
have an intention that we are able to
hone in and
dial in and remove the static
because we have that crystal in our
hand, that's a powerful thing.
It's a very powerful
instrument in and of itself even if it has
no external energy
coming out of it. It has the power to
focus your mind into
the direction, whether
it's a healing thing you need to happen or
just a
reminder to stay calm or
grounded or whatnot. I think
once people have a better understanding
of what energy
is and what types of
energy there are between vibration
and frequency and light and all
sorts of... That's one thing
Living Soils brought me around
to is all these different facets
of life
and how deep
that wormhole actually is
and how that can...
That harmonizes with
plants in the same way.
It's deep
and it makes you
appreciate things around you
in a whole other level.
I got
two things. First, Bonewear
out in the sunshine. Is that right? You got that
little box out there catching sun rays?
Yeah, I'm out here with my
raised box garden bed. I just
figured I'd wheel out here while you were talking
and show everyone.
You got a light in there for nighttime?
I just took it out because I'm going into flower
so I'm just about to go and I
just took it out two days ago but I was put...
I had two 12 watt LED strip
lights in here that kept the
light cycle going so I could
use daylight and then I only had
to have that light on a couple hours at night.
This has a front
that comes down and Velcros closed so
I can blacken this thing out.
Perfect. Perfect. That's like
a super simple tar system.
Wow. That's...
Yeah.
Cool. I was
going to ask that question. So basically
you will light dip it, right?
Yeah, this is a micro light
dip. So this is my totally micro
light dip is what I call this thing.
And it's got the totally aerated air
unit inside which I just showed you.
There's a 4 inch pipe that covers the whole
length of the bled that's
got 200 holes drilled in it
so that I can pile drive air with a
4 inch vortex fan through the rhizosphere.
This helps me
dry out and make sure I don't
have any anaerobic areas in here.
Both ways.
Air's blowing out this side
and air's sucked in on this side
over here.
It goes through this 4 inch
vortex. The vortex goes
like I showed you guys here earlier.
There's a hole right there.
That's a hole that
goes the length of the bed. It's got
200 holes drilled in it and that's
going to allow the root system to breathe.
There's no way this is going to go
anaerobic at all.
100%. It's got a pond
liner so that it's 100% waterproof
here because I had to treat this outside
so I don't want my soil
system touching anything that I had to spray
and treat it.
These plants, I'd have to check my
date but I'm thinking they've been in here maybe
2 weeks maximum
from
clone and I put them in here
out of the 9 ounce cups. They were smaller
than the cherry pie I sent you Peter.
This is roughly 14
days and he's using just the sun
and 24 watts of LED
that's on for a couple hours a day.
I got these set to a
waterproof outdoor
connector
I have out here.
This allows me to hook up my fan
or any lights that's going to be going. I'm going to be
putting in a second bed
but this one's built
so that I can actually access this
from my wheelchair and so I can
actually grow some stuff with almost
no cost through electrical
input. The bed's
going to be a living bed so the first
is probably going to be the worst grow
because it doesn't have the microbial
action that I really want going in there
but as I build it up through this grow
and the next ones the bed's going to start to get better
it should produce better
and it's going to just keep on giving me
better results when I'm breeding.
This helps me get all of the
traits that I'm desiring from
these plants turned on
from the spectrum of the sun
and from the environmental cues that's happening
out here. The wind
even the chemicals that are
in the air are going to make this plant
react different than how it's grown
indoor in a tent under a
3500 watt LED
light. I'm getting
UV light here that I just cannot
produce anywhere
inside without having hot spots
and affecting single plants.
I'm getting growth here.
This cultivar
here, this is the space cheese right here.
This is the one that I'm breeding with.
This is space cheese number two
female. Right next
to her in my hand is the Kim D.
I don't know if you guys can pick up on the
variegation that's on her.
She's a
variegated girl. Next to her
we got the Cory Stardog.
Right here is
the space cheese number four phenome.
In the back we've got
triangle cush right here.
SFVOG
Kim 4
and
Roberts Creek Congo back here.
All these are going to be used for breeding.
I'm going to be pollinating with
just a small space cheese
male. When you're doing breeding like this, you don't
need a massive male. This male
could pollinate probably about 50 of these
girls if I wanted.
What I do is I keep this dude in a small half gallon
pot and he
goes in there every night. Once he starts to
pollinate, he'll stay in there for seven days
dropping pollen. Then he's removed from
the garden and they're going to be allowed to
swell up and reproduce.
That's just how I usually do it.
When I'm doing a larger room
I would do the same thing.
I would put a male
for each quadrant. Every four plants
I'd have a male in between them so it looks like
a five on a dice.
Every four plants, no matter what, I had
a male. That way I'm ensuring
that I get thorough pollination in my room.
I don't want to be fighting
trying to get pollen to do its thing
when I'm trying to make seeds. I want to
make seeds.
It's what you're
doing efficiently.
Even if it's being
if you're producing fiber, you don't
want to plant that grows fucking short.
If you want to make trichomes,
you want to have the right cannabinoids.
When you're producing seeds, you want
to do that shit
correctly. This garden
has good inputs of amino acids.
That's something you
have to have in there when you're making seeds.
They're driving the protein synthesis of the plant.
All the cells are being
built off of amino acids.
You also want to keep
high amounts of potassium
and a good nitrogen level also, but
not a strong nitrogen and not a single source
when you're breeding.
Single source nitrogens
are going to off gas
and become too available too quickly
and you could have some
male stamina flower formation in the undergrowth
on the bottom of some of your plants.
Say something like one of the
chems or a GMO would definitely
start to throw off some male
flowers on the bottom, which would affect
your breeding project.
Now you cannot ensure that every
seed in that garden is a cross
that you intended if you get those
male stamina flowers.
I'm definitely looking at it.
I've got to move my big plots around
in my project right now.
I'm just testing on
each one.
I don't usually
do a bulk class like I've got
going right now. I showed earlier.
Something I'd like to point out with what Bones
got set up here in this cool little bed.
He's got that tube
sticking through the middle there. Anyone seen any
of my videos I've been doing in the wild showing
natural soil in
situ? Every time I dig into the ground
there's a gopher hole running through the middle
of everything.
Nature has these holes through
soil. It's not a solid
mass generally.
Even out in the prairies it's constantly
bringing the bottom up and putting it on top
with critters that are large and small.
Like he said, this is
not going to be his best grow
in this because it's his first grow. Anytime you start
a new organic setup it takes a while
to come to life.
Aquaponic systems can take quite
a while for all that to happen.
The key element
is if you're doing a full liquid system
like that, paying attention to your nitrates
and nitrites and how it transitions.
Once it starts to transition
instead of killing your fish
it starts feeding the plants and their system.
Life
takes a second. It doesn't just
spontaneously,
even if you've inoculated it, it takes a while
to move through. It doesn't take a lot to inoculate
that really
fully flourished.
That microbial sand I showed,
that stuff takes years to develop
to really
get going in the earth
and lots of organic matter.
Do you think
I'm in the process
my buddy is
building a
couple SIPs beds for us
and what we're going to do
you're talking about the process
of building, the time that it takes to
evolve your
system you're in.
Do you think
starting a Hugelkultur
style soaking
of stuff would
entice that to
speed along or be
maybe not necessarily skipping
a step but starting at
a little bit
higher level for a
SIPs bed instead of just water
and soil, throwing in that
extra biological
mass?
Something I've been doing is
using pine cones for my
bottom and my
makeshift quick five gallon
SIPs.
I tell you wrong.
That's an excellent
spot that holds life.
You can roll it and compost
before or whatever.
I think most people's experience
if you follow the recipe, if you follow
like Bone's DDA soil
mix and modernize it a little bit
to, you know, we don't use
Bacwano so much anymore, things like that
or any of the really good living
soil recipes that
are designed to use those SIPs and you
follow the recipe. Like Bone was saying
we've been doing, people have been doing this stuff
for a long time. That's not my particular system
so I won't give you a soil
recipe for SIPs but I'll tell you what
if I was doing a 40 light
system I'd be using SIPs.
It's so simple. You set it up
and your first time is going to be better
than all the trials and errors of
trying to grow hydroponic with salts.
You're going to go, wow, this shit works
if I follow the recipe.
Then the next time it's going to get better
and the next time it's going to get better after that.
You're going to be like in seventh round
going, man, does it ever stop getting better?
Because you keep adding more life
and microbial to it. If you
have a hugelkultur outside and you tear it apart
and mix some of that in, you're going to
kick start it. If you throw a log in the bottom
like that,
that's not necessarily going to be
increasing your-
I'm talking about like
finding those logs outside, bringing
them inside and soaking them in a giant
rubbermaid.
Yeah.
In a humic soak.
No, no. Don't do that.
Take it and grind it.
Take a hatchet and chip
it up and make it into
your mulch. Put that as your
top dress on the top layer there.
Use that as a top mulch.
In that microbial community
that is
sapotrophic that's eating lignans
will work its way into the soil.
What I did with my outdoor hugelkultur,
I live right on the
border of a national
park.
You're technically not supposed to take any.
If you were to take something out of
there, it would be trouble.
Parks are a little more stiffer than
a forest. Forest is cool
generally. If you're taking
large quantities, you want to file with the office
as a notice of intent or a letter
of intent. The parks,
we tend to just leave things where
they are in the parks. It's more of a wilderness situation.
You got some good natural stuff
hypothetically.
Right on the border of my
land in the park. It's been
untouched for years.
There's this huge tree
that must have fallen
down about 50 years ago or so.
That stump is just
one of those ones
that you can almost just put your hand into.
It's just soil. You just
pull it out. I made
my whole hugelkultur bed
basically out of that and a little bit of
pro mix and a little
amendment mix from build a soil.
I had the best
outdoor flowers that I've had
in 20 years.
It was
so easy. It's got
a fungal dominance in that. That stuff's all
been broken down. It's
getting close to being available.
You want to keep it in the moisture with a little bit of nitrogen.
It's all...
Wood does not steal nitrogen
from our soil when we put it in.
If you're going for a large
space, you're looking
at a top dressing or using it as a
bulk filler or an aeration.
If that's what you have available and you're debating
the microtease, there's different kinds
of wood. Pine is the same as a hardwood.
There's leguminous
trees that actually will add nitrogen themselves
as a chip and make a hot
compost.
What happens is our microbes
start acting and they
utilize... The available
nitrogen moves right through the soil
with water as soon as it becomes
bioavailable.
If it doesn't become immobilized by a
microbe or taken up by the plant,
it's lost to the system.
It's basically banking
through microbe immobilization
when you...
A lot of this is actually nitrogen coming
from the air and
the microbes are utilizing
not from the soil availability.
Again, if that
available soil isn't immobilized
one way or the other and it's not taken up by the
plant, it's lost.
You don't ever lose or
rob nitrogen from a system
by putting woodchip into it.
It's a longer term
thing. You might not have as much
available if you don't have any
available or much available to start
with, in which case
you're missing nitrogen
and bacteria primarily
because that's where the majority of...
The majority
of... It's not just the peas.
There's other stuff fixing nitrogen out of the air.
That's where it comes from
primarily is 80% of the
air is nitrogen gas.
Woodchips
are awesome.
That's what
the whole bunch of the forest soils
are made of. You go walk around the forest and it's
just like this is amazing.
It's a matter of time and
we only live so long
and trees live
so long and microbes take so long
to do their thing.
Well, I
hate
to
stay here and say I have
to leave, but I have a golf match
I have to get going to.
It's golf season
in Maine.
Well,
my buddy
built an indoor golf room.
We
have been playing all...
We've been playing all winter.
Keep rubbing it in, Cedric.
We're getting
to the point now in Maine where it's about
45 degrees so the golf courses
are starting to do maintenance.
We might be open towards the end of April.
I got to get my...
What?
I really got to start working on my putting and my swim.
Don't freeze on the green
like you're freezing right now, dude.
I'm telling you.
You just froze for a second, man.
You know,
man, I...
Billionaires are fading.
I'm horrible at putting.
I can teach you how to put, dude.
Trust that.
Before you go,
I got one more thought
before we looked at Bones Garden that I had.
We were talking about understanding
life and this is just one of those
deep thoughts for you.
I refer to fire as a living entity.
I can describe that.
It has a birth.
It breathes oxygen.
It feeds
on living
things or things that have been killed.
My license plate ring says
Dragon Slayer because I used
to go kill dragons and it was a
euphemism for the fire itself.
It's a living entity of the fire.
That's my original
viewpoint when the fire comes to the forest
and starts everything over
and regrowth begins
and the ecological
spheres build up.
That's the viewpoint that I understand
nature from.
It's that living entity we call fire.
Just a deep thought about what is life.
Great chatting with you.
Good to meet you today.
Right on, brother.
Thank you. I'll see you again.
Tony, always a pleasure.
Peter Longthice.
Did the t-shirt arrive?
Two t-shirts.
Not yet?
They have not yet.
I'm actually going to run to the mail
now and see if they're there.
Awesome. Nice talking with everyone.
Sorry I can't see Chad
or outside.
Say hi to people.
Take it easy, Cedric. Good seeing you, man.
See you.
That's the boy, Cedric.
Oh, man.
He's always got to talk
about me every time.
We had a glitch
in the Matrix.
He'll be back.
You're still there. I'm still here.
Come on.
He's coming back. I can slowly hear him.
I've been much more productive
with the
seed packing
with more people on.
Right?
I'm currently packing up
some of the bone yard.
There's only 10 of those Scorpius.
That's Bender's bag right there.
The Redwood Kush F3.
Fast Flower.
If you're going to grow them outside,
put them in a 65 gallon.
They should finish
around the mid-September time
with that Bender's bag.
Look for some piney, pushy stuff.
Before you came on, he was asking
about the pine scent flavors in their
local terrarium. That's something I remember
in my youth.
A lot of the stuff coming out of the
Triangle had a really
piney back into
the skunk on it.
Is that something you
are aware of with the soil drone
in your area out in the woods versus
...?
That was big, man. Back in the 80s.
I grew up in Humboldt since
the early 80s.
You can just drive through that area
in certain times in the 80s.
The whole place smelled of what everyone
calls roadkill skunk.
It just was in the air.
Heavy pine on the
backside of that stuff.
Extremely piney on some of those.
My redwood carries
some of that. The redwood F4s and
the El Viejo I have, it has a piney.
It's crazy piney.
It's not like a pine cleaner.
It's more like pine sap.
It's a different kind of that smell on there.
It's like an
ancient pine smell. That's what I call it
instead of an artificial one.
It's like a pine tar sap one.
Yeah, exactly.
It's a crazy
smell. It comes across.
It will pair real well with
lemon or citrus or even
these OGs will come out.
It'll bring the brightness out of some of those
or the lime.
I always thought that about that pine tar.
I was like, man, is this where the
tangy is very similar
to those orange flavors.
Some of that pine tar can be too
much almost.
It stays in your mouth so
strong. It coats it. It's crazy.
Some of them that are so strong.
It's a great novelty but not an all day,
every day for sure.
Some of them are too piney that are like that.
Some of the extremely
lemon lines do that to me.
They're so
intense that it's not enjoyable
on the palate or it comes across so strong.
It's so artificial tasting that
to me it comes across tasting like old
dirty cardboard and shit sometimes.
To a point where it's harsh on the
palate.
It doesn't work.
When I'm looking for
skunk, people ask me all the time about skunk
and it's like I get so much stuff that everyone says
it smells like a skunk.
What I'm looking for is that skunk with the pine backside.
That's the one I
remember from back in the day.
It smelled
like you drove past a dead skunk.
Not necessarily you hit it
but it's a dead one on the side of the road
and then you smoke it and it's got that piney
flavor to it.
On the backside. That would have been some of the stuff that
was coming out of an area that was called
Salmon Creek.
Where I was at. Upriver.
They called this herb Upriver herb.
Where I was at, there
was different tribes. You got the Yurok and the
Kuroks. They call them Upriver
and Downriver. Then you got the
Hoopa down there.
I'm friends with all those people.
I owned a hotel in that area that was over
100 years old. It was the oldest building
in Humboldt, I believe.
When we had it. That thing was like 112
years old back in the 80s. It was
old as hell.
We took that place and we turned it
into
it's better than it had ever been. All the old
timers remembered it. We had people that
this one dude brought his grandson
there and that guy had came
there when he was 8 years old. That's how old this
place was. He comes there when he's
90 to bring his grandson to
the place he came to see when he was
that kid's age. While we were
there, we become so tight with the
people in that area. They start sharing
genetics and shit like that. We start
getting herb from everywhere. We got
shit just like you're describing that.
Super skunky stuff that's got this
heavy
almost a mentholated pine that comes
across and opens up all your sinuses.
It's crazy.
It's nice.
The herb back in the day was killer.
My doctor dream
where I'm starting to work down lines
into, I self did
and I decided that crossing
into it just ain't going to find what I was looking
for out of it.
It's opening up all these menthols
and a couple of generations down
from where it's just like this is a heavy
lemon skunk
but these menthols and pines
are coming back out of it. It's pretty
interesting to follow
I might come resign
that I might never get it back to where
it is in the pet only as a seed
just because it's so poly.
The things that are coming back out
these old schools that are still there
is really enjoyable. That's
one of the ones I'm toking on today
is this really earthy skunky
I had a little
bit out of the house
and kept on just going
whoa. It really
yeah. This is
out of like 16
I said I could six and I'm going to continue
to. Right on.
Awesome.
Yeah. See that's
what did you find in that out of the
F2 generations of those or
farther down even.
I took I finally decided
like since I got into PFA and I started
to be able to access seed again
I started crossing all these land races to it
because there's so much land race in it
and I wanted to see if I could back cross in
the back crossers were doing pretty good.
There's still multiple very varieties
in the back. You got to go a few
guy crosses in and I started realizing
that like there was also different
that I'm going to take some of that hern
seed from back before I ever got any more
seeds in the house. Make sure that's what it
was and
open that up and then took the males
from that and back crossed into her
and because
again I guess I keep getting from
whatever purpose it expresses as a male I
keep calling
and then at
that point it was
male female ratio
and I selected and I've
crossed them but I've got a chocolate
mint. I got a
with some pine
this one here skunk with a little
bit that piney and menthol
and
it in mass the walking
past the group of them it was just straight skunk
you know and that that leads to a
concept that I've been having with
hash and
some of the best that I've had
when I'm doing these breeding runs and I
take all those phenotypes that
I didn't choose for flower
and I run them all to a hash
and that that grouping
of together
is some of what
I look at what they're doing and these guys
you see on Instagram runs of
the fields in Afghanistan and Pakistan
and that's
kind of what they got is a mishmash of
their field land race. Yeah.
There's more there's not just one particular
flower in there that they reproduce
the thousand thousand times
it's there's 100 different flowers
in there and that all comes together it
creates this amazing bouquet that
this regional hash variety
and each of their they
consider each region
has a particular head or
effect right and it might
there might be different farmers in the region that have
different particulars but
that's one
of the things I want to start doing is instead of trying
to inbreed some of these lines
to a specific true breeding
seed is leaving it as a
group of phenotypes
that people can do that kind of an open
hash blend. Yeah open pollinate
those things put as many male and
females from the lines that you're doing
together and open up the genetic
possibility that's in there because
monocropping from
clones gets it
stagnates and it's again goes back to
what I call the genocide of
cannabis when all we want to grow is
one particular cultivar in the garden
and that's it from
a clone so we can produce as much of that
one as possible instead of trying to
produce that whole bouquet
get the entourage effects which is what coming
through like the old style when they used to
collect the hash on their bodies
going through the fields and then
collecting that back in the 60s and
that kind of hash that they were
producing instead of just washing
it through water and removing a lot of the essence
of the plant because that water
is a carrier of a lot of things
that are we're
losing man like a lot of anthocyanins
are water soluble
I made kombucha out of
out of bubble water before
really and I've made
beer and I've never had these things lab
tested but I know they're extremely potent
you can only take a couple of sips of them
it's not the alcohol it's not the THC
it's the combination of all this stuff
you know I come bocha
with bubble water right for the
for the tea and that shit is
just like this crazy freaking
medicine and but again here I am out
in the desert under a rock I don't have a laboratory
to analyze this exactly what
but there's
definitely some that's one of the things instead of
just breeding towards that mono seed that I've always
bred towards I was starting to go man
it just doesn't like do
that project to keep these open pollinated
to and that's something I think I'm going to keep
doing as part of my mode of
operation is having these
open so people
can find what works for them instead of
you know they're then there's different ways
you get true
true parent lines that
are inbred for so long and
breeding those one to one you're going to get a pretty
true breeding F1
that's pretty rare in case they'll get a hold
of two parent lines that are
like so inbred that they're
going to do that
but we're working
towards having lots of those
there's always amazing offshoots
to keep coming
can't kill that off I got a
I got a work
that's the best
that gives more options for people to line
breed that's when you can take 100 seeds
and give 10 to 10 different people and tell them to
come back in a year and they all have
10 different complete different lines
now that all originated from the
original cross that had enough
genetic expressions
to offer that ability instead of a line
that's always producing this one terpene
this one structure this one
size that right there
now if we're looking for special medicine
in that line we may never
find it in a line that's been worked so hard
for a few particular
traits from just back crossing repeatedly
to the same parent over and over
and just bottlenecking what that
one plant offered be it good or bad
when we could have opened up the whole genetic
possibilities of cannabinoids
and terpene profiles that were killing off
because we ourselves don't
like grape or maybe I don't like
something that smells like lavender or I'm
not a lemon guy so I every time I smell
lemon I kill that in my line
when the guy next to me
he's been looking for that for years
right like I could have gave that plant to
someone else and that could have been the whole
basis of someone taking the line
to a whole different direction
that I myself can never get it to
because either that chemical doesn't
work correctly with me or like
I said it comes down to the energy of me
with that plant in the garden
I decide automatically that I don't
want to fuck with that plant because I don't like the smell
of it I'm never going to be able to breed
something special out of that plant because
I'm always seeing the bad in it
instead of seeing what's really there. I got a thing
about internode spacing right
or the way the flower develops
or things like that to me that can be like
yeah I'm not going to put pollen on that
yeah so those are
my hard core is definitely a strain
like that where it's I send it out as
the freebie pack and it's a dedication
to my best friend and it was
open pollinated on the side of a mountain
so it
can go anywhere just about with such a
diverse and someone's going to
find a different thing that's going to work in their
environment and their head
right yeah
what you just said about expanding
this out with the Dr. Dream
All Care my
mentor had 22 land races
over 26 years he bred together
right and then I had my brother's
Hindu Kush original line
HK that I bled that
back into and then it could be
San Fernando Valley original
from I got a cut directly
from one hand to me from the
dispensary back in the day
that's a pretty
diverse package
there to open up and find all these
different things in and trying to bring it back to
that one single line would be stupid
really
yeah
for sure
that
stuff you're talking the space cheese last night
I fell asleep listening to you guys chat
last night is that the one you're
you showed the video of the truck
running over and not
that's my
the one that cars running over is called
it has the same
mail used in it but they have
the one I drive over has got Larry
O.G. in it it's dedicated to my
uncle butch whose name was Larry
so I use the Larry O.G. clone
crossed my angel and I
made what's called aka Lorenzo's
oil because my grandfather
really wanted to name my uncle Lorenzo and not
Larry so I dedicated it
after my uncle he'd lived on the street for 26
years after he came back from Vietnam
he just said fuck it and just went
to the streets but the dude was the
smartest man I ever came across he could
do 10 digit division in his head quicker than you could
type shit into a goddamn calculator he'd give
you the answer he could take a motor
apart and put it back together without
labeling any fucking part of that goddamn
thing he was a helicopter mechanic
in Vietnam when he
comes back he was having seizures his whole life
because he had fell through the roof of a KFC
and injured himself he had traumatic
brain injury from the incident
so I realized through
cannabis once my grandfather died
I started looking at cannabis as
a medicine I start realizing
every time I give him herb he has no
seizures and I bring this up with
the dude and him being the guy
he was he don't give a fuck he don't care if he's having
seizures or not because he
he's over it. Fuck it I'm gonna
drink so I'm like bro I can
give you cannabis you won't have seizures
like let's let's try to fucking stop
this shit quit drinking for a while
we're gonna see if the cannabis works and he
did that with me for a while we found
out 100% that no matter what cannabis
kept my uncle from having seizures
but he couldn't stay off the
the sauce that long so eventually he went
back to the streets and kept drinking until it killed
his ass and once he died
I dedicated that line the one I drove
over to my uncle it's called Bumba
it's that video on YouTube
I take my mom's van and run
over it now
I think you were the one asked how come it didn't stick to the
tire and the answer to that was
oh I know you were but uh
it was like 120
degrees outside dude and the asphalt
was fucking nasty
yeah dude boom
exactly but I just wanted
people to realize exactly how dense
that plant was you could take a haze or something
or say you take
a Dr. Grinspoon which is also a
haze cross something like that and run that shit over
and it's gonna pulverize it to dirt
I mean I could have took cookies and thrown it
on there and probably done the same thing cause I
drove over a few different buds
I think I've handled nuggets
in my life that weren't pressed into a brick
maybe three times
that were like that and I think I've had one strain
that was even close and all the growing
I've done that's pretty rare to get it that
dense without uh doing
something to it that was grown
100% organic soil
here in my garden we have
more clay in this area
than the
every pot natives ever made
stacked up together I'm telling you can't dig
three feet in this shit out here with running into
the reddest clay in the earth
in the world and I think that
part of that clay input
has something to do with the density of that
plant she does grow dense inside also but
when she's grown in a high clay
soil mixture that
plant grows so fucking dense
like you have to literally take
two hands to try to break the stem in half
I call her the Louis Vu slugger
she's fucking gnarly strong
I used her in a back cross
I back cross that bum bud to my angel and I call it
homophobic it also retains
the density in that plant
it's almost too dense
it's good for breeding
and for show like if you just want to grow
for show it's not going to give you the best herb
because that density doesn't allow
light to penetrate into the flower which is
what we need for the trichomes to start to
produce what we need
they develop well in a dense flower
that's one thing like hashmakers don't like
a super dense flower because they don't
develop in that
fine space and they're just
they kind of squish each other and can't swell
and yeah
you don't get the terpene production
you don't get the oil production
but the plant's good to breed it
into like the haze
like I was talking about you take the haze that's so
wide open it's so huge it's hard
to handle indoors you take that and breed it to a plant
that's short dense finishes
fast has the ability to
handle all kinds of
mechanical stress which some plants
cannot like a fire OG
you take a fire OG and that plant has
issues with actually
holding it's own weight up because of
the thinness of the branching and shit
so if you could breed that across to another plant
that has a stronger stem
has more fiber
in it's system now you're going to be able to
take that fire OG and through
time breeding back cross it into itself multiple
times like people would do with
say like an auto flower or
if you're trying to retain a
leaf shape through a mutation when you try to
breed that heterozygous
trait back to a homozygous state
so it's a homozygous recessive
that's showing up in the line that you want
now it just takes breeding
so you take it and cross it to something
different back cross it to itself enough
you retain that plant again
as close as possible
it all breeding takes time
it works out killer
but that's why you go multiple
directions so even if you're going to open pollinate a room
like you say you've been line breeding
to certain traits and you decided that maybe
I should open pollinate so I have
more shit I got more
wrenches to pull out to work on
when you start to only have
one tool in your tool bag eventually
you're going to run into a situation
where you're not going to be able to fix the engine with the t-shirt
and a wrench no more you got rid of the Volkswagen
now you're working on a fucking BMW
you need a different set of tools right
that's where it comes from you take those same plants
and open pollinate a room instead of line
breeding that room this time and now
you may be able to find exactly what you're looking for
in that new progeny instead of
line breeding it through F generations
or back crossing to the repeating
parent only and now you
start to bottleneck
or like I said you're just killing
off the stuff that you might have been looking
for and it might have been in one generation
different Afghan crosses
I've got
the different Afghani regions and
crossing stuff from Afghan to Pakistan
and looking for those real
winners in there where
maybe it was field hash plants
and I'm looking for something that's a little more
that someone's going to desire for a flower
hash plant a smoky
tops and hash the rest of the type of
thing yeah but boy
some of the some of the diversity
of those terpene profiles in those
field hash plants just
phenomenal
you can totally do that you can take
one of those packs and find
yourself a specific trait that you like
and line breed it straight into
reproduce in that particular
or keep them open
and it's your choice
once you get that seed in your hand right
what is your goal and
do something with it and just leave
the world in better state than when you found
it
I had an artist
mentor
who he showed us some of the
stuff that he was doing when he was developing
the style and we were
in the studio and asked to see some of
some of it he's like I threw it all away
and I'm like well
what'd you do that for he's like well you don't really
want that lower quality stuff
out there in the world
right and so
there's the level of
you're learning
yeah I messed up I'm gonna
eat those or I'm gonna feed them to my chickens
but some of that stuff
it's getting cashed away
and maybe my daughter or her friends will
someday open those up or
get in a position where I live in Oklahoma
maybe in the future and I can do a whole
field and check all this stuff in her greenhouse
yep
yep that's what it takes
is the time and space that's what
I benefited from when I worked
at my collective I could take
a group of like 200 growers and be like
here's the project we're gonna run
all this stuff and some of your guys garden
because they all
I had so many patients in there that either
couldn't afford to pay
for the plants because they were
buying their medicine from us or
like they was either by the soil
or and wait to get the plant so what I started
doing was some of them you got free
shit you come in and were willing to give me
the information back from your grow and some
of the product then I would give you
for free and we would come over and consult for
you do everything we need to do to walk you through
the grow to make sure everything you were doing was
going to be correct that way at the end of the season
you could take that product and offered
back to either our club or one of the local
clubs in town and you had a quality
product to do so so and we
also knew because we were a club
we had insight to the other clubs in
town so we knew what clubs
were moving what kind of cultivars so
I we knew that one place was
always pushing a whole bunch of blue
or something right we wouldn't put that in our shop
because we weren't trying to compete
with someone that had an endless supply that we knew
was growing it correctly so we put our
patients into something else that we knew
they'd be able to take to a place
because they weren't having it produced
or we knew at our club that we were going to need like
we had this one called purple nightmare
it was just the perps it was a cultivar
that one of our
patients had decided to call purple nightmare
so that's what we started calling it
and we would put that into different growers
and so no matter what we
had different qualities of that
to put on different shelves in our garden because we
already had a dude that was filling our top shelf
that dude could produce it repeatedly
every time exactly the same
endless amounts that dude
he had underground bunkers that he was
growing in man it was crazy and then
we had cats that were just throwing it in
whatever soil they could find that were growing
the worst quality cannabis you could get
and all they wanted to come in was
to trade it for something or to get more clones
and we were like cool we'll take it we can turn it into
a concentrate we'll do something with it
and you're not out so it was a way
for us to steer the
actually the
the business side of the
collectives instead of just ripping people off
right some places were giving you
any clone that they could put in the place
and telling you it was something else and
at the end of the year you'd come back and try to sell it
and it wasn't the herb you thought it was
so you couldn't even move it right
you come to our club and you'd
get exactly what you were looking for
you'd be put into something that you
was going to be profitable or it was going to be
efficient for your medicinal needs
like why would I
give someone with a child a high THC
plant like an OG when
that person probably needs some form
of CBD for the child
right the kids 12 years old
they're not going to be puffing tough all damn day
so
they weren't you
no that's true
but like most places
only saw cannabis as a way to get high
even in the 215 days there were still
clubs out there that were only pushing
weed to get your mind altered
and not trying to fix
what's wrong with like someone that's got
arthritis that does not want to get high
like I had mechanics that were getting tested
who they could not come in and smoke
cannabis or they'd lose their job
but they could use a topical lotion and it
wasn't going to show up in a piss test right
they just make sure they didn't have none on their hands
that day and then they'd go in
have the piss test for their fucking union
shit or whatever they were doing and they'd
keep the job and be able to work longer
because the shit don't hurt no more right
I wasn't just like here's some cannabis
dude the doctor said you should smoke this
you know this is our
$60 an eighth I'm trying to sell this dude because I know
he's got money so I could push him the most
expensive shit in the club instead I'm like
I got a $10 bottle of lotion brother why don't you
try this shit out it's free you come back
and tell me what works when some
somebody from PFA Todd
Wicks I think I think
it was
I'm so bad with
names one of our friends
who was in Vegas he's back in this now
that
but anyhow he shouted out
send Alex some medicine and I ended up getting
a jar of coconut
oil is maybe 2%
FICO in it and before
I had that like I'd be the storm would come
through here and I'd be laying on the floor and I'd smoke
and I've been smoking forever and I've been getting
other people FICO for their problems
but I'd never
had a fathom of a clue
the potency of a topical
and maybe 2%
and you just a little bit of coconut
oil olive oil beeswax and
a teeny bit of cannabis oil in there
and I rubbed it on my back that
was my lower back at the time
the storms are coming through I'd lay on the floor
and just I wanted to be dead
three days of storm
and blowing and I couldn't get off the floor
from the pain and this was 10 minutes
and I'm up walking around this going that didn't
just fix that there's no fucking
way no wonder it's illegal this shit
works fucking
snake venom
right
anything in the world that somebody has ever
invented that says kills pain somebody
gave to me to try and kill my pain
opiates didn't do it I made my own still
so I can make my own booze
and moonshine right and I would
sip that to relax the muscles a little bit
it would help smoking the chronic
maybe friends with it but I rubbed
that little bit on there and I got up and I got back
to work in my house that day and like that
didn't that that and I tested it the next
time just the smallest freaking
amount and I put it on one side
instead of both to make sure that was really
what happened and it's like yeah one side
like a baby and the other side
like an old man and
that's all it is
teeming with I and I I actually
that was I've made a bunch
since then right but I've
it doesn't take much and once your body
is relaxed and you're not in that hypertension
load anymore you can start building muscle
again and you have this you don't have
to even use it and
that's all it takes for some people
there was a guy around the corner
the lady owns the candy shop and
I never figured out the formula for making hard candy
but he was
they had to drive the out of
state and illegally
bring the stuff hard candies in
and it was a teeny
little amount like 100
milligrams or whatever just a single
that's all his guy needed for
like he would be
a walk around babbling idiot
and he'd pop one of these things in and all of a sudden
he's running the store again right
and it was from a PTSD
episode that his mind was going
from and the
teeniest amount of us people who's
recreated with like what that did I didn't feel
like no you don't need to feel it
it's
um
they work man that hard candies I used to make a ton
of those for Falcon at my club we used to have a
jar right on the front so every time he made a purchase
he could take some hard candies and shit out of there
and it became so
popular I couldn't keep the damn jar
filled man once people realized how
potent that that worked
sublingually through the body
like I keep trying to tell him if you smoke
cannabis realize that
you're blowing out every time you blow out
you've released the medicine that you were trying
to put in like if you can take
that in a form that doesn't come out of your body
it's going to work more efficiently
they wouldn't get there a lot of people
were just smoking weed they just want to smoke
weed I'm going to burn it I need to cough
boom you know it's there
yeah but you when you burn
it it's 80%
but it doesn't
even it's not there and you're just getting
the all you're getting is
less than 20% comes into your system
is pyrolysis gas
right and so vaping you're getting more just
like that it's just straight pyrolysis gas and never
oxidizes but you're also not
quite getting the same they're not the
same I also so
definitely some I
smoking flowers definitely something
for me besides physical medicine
it's a spiritual medicine that I can't
get from the extracts I can't get from
but it's still
part of my my daily
routine and my chemistry
and whatnot spirituality for
sure this right here is nice
you talk pipe stone
yeah
one for like 10 years that
it got swiped this year
I got invited to a house party
eccentric millionaires house and
I took a medicine bundle it
was a bunch of healers and somebody
walked off with my medicine bundle and
took the but I
need to get down to Moab the the mine
and I'm not sure if it's been mined
or not but it's been mined
out and I talked to the owners
they sold all the stock for this
red Utah kale and I
pipe stone to the rock shop
and Moab where I originally
got mine from I'm going to go back down and
purchase a bunch more and start
carving pipes for
folks
yeah
I didn't quite finish it you can
this is going to get reduced
to a car some designs
on and whatnot. It's
a it's a mud stone and
it comes out of the shales where they actually
then we
mine shales here for additives
for
our soils
I'm sorry. And this comes
out of one of those spots
apparently I see this
triola bites in some of it
but
there's all sorts of good stuff here
the
majority of the grow cashew product
is the wheat's grown here
and like azomite comes from here
and
if you buy a bagged humate it
generally is a rock layer
that's been crushed here in Utah
sometimes
right next to the coal mine
it seems that they're finding
when I do run down to Moab
I'm going to try and do some recording
of some of the different layers of the beautiful sandstones
and rare earth
to show all the different
cool
natural mineral deposits
so people
see how it layers over time
and things like that and how we extract it
produce the concentrated
form of
just kind of like a gold sluice nature's been working
this stuff over for
plate tectonics and
seabeds and life happens
and it deposits and it gets
carried over it compresses it
makes stone and then
plate tectonics folds it and squishes
it and makes mountains and it wears
down in the soil again and
full
spectrum around from the beginning
where we started looking at soil
and living systems
and this was a pretty good talk
so far today. Yeah man
for sure
and I'm gonna speak here.
So we could
I don't know if you guys want to call it
I gotta go to the post office
Yeah I know Bill's been talking all night too
and I got work I need to get
bottom up plant myself
Yeah man anytime I'm glad brother
good talking today.
Well I appreciate it and there's some
bone yard and some hearty gear
going out in today's
post office run so
and then a lot of
mean gene and
sun grown mids from
the Christian Carter fundraiser
I'm gonna check in with
with Ashley who's
Christian's lawyer to see how things
are going but they were in court
on Friday morning
Yeah MV they are going
out many
of these are going out in
today's mail as in yesterday's
mail as in tomorrow's mail
It's like Sisyphus pushing a rock
up a hill
Them's the same bags all the mean gene
seeds I got came in
just like those bag you write some on there
that's what I that's the one of the best
recommendations I can tell anybody on
here if you pass seeds and little plastic
baggies use them fucking ones
with the white spot on it don't write
on the bag with a marker it
comes off in about 25 seconds
make sure you get it on there
25 seconds make sure
you write on that white part or slip a piece
of paper inside people I have
so many bags of seeds people have given me
with shit written on the outside but by the time
I left the vent or whatever
I didn't know what the fuck I had
on me anymore because they just wrote it
on the outside of the bag it comes off people
the best
tip I can give you properly
able and
we all have so
many seeds it might be a minute
before we get around to popping those
ones
basically
these got sent
like that and then I got
to basically do that so
they don't get crushed
yeah that's
why I send all mine sent mine come
prepackaged so no one else got to do
that shit dude I put
those like that
and I also didn't use the
straws in mine so you didn't
have to risk anything getting crushed by mail
sorters because those fucking envelope rollers
crush fucking everything
yeah
these things
yep
you pay a dollar to have them hand
processed the other way but even then it can
still get into the
it can get through those rollers
these are six dollars on
Amazon for 200 of them
six bucks
so
I hope you're taking notes
these are
your friend
yes 100% you can
stand on them I made a video standing on
those when I used to have two legs and shit
like there you're not going to get your seeds
crushed passing them in the central tube fuses
those things are there sterile
and they can be sterilized
they're made specifically for being
used in the centrifuge where
everything inside has to be sterile
so that if those things come to you
they should be pretty sterile
unless they've been in some fucked up warehouse
somewhere they're clean
so
I'm trying to remember
some of the stuff that's at
least in the schedule I think
tomorrow we're going to visit Australia with
Lance sometime in the afternoon
I know at one o'clock tomorrow
we have Matt Powers and Chris
Trump
I assume
talking K&F
Chad Westport and his
flowing locks will be Saturday
at 2pm
Pacific
Thursday I think we have
Brian and Leighton
and I don't know who the guest is
this week but
he probably posted it already
we got some clubhouse sessions
we may be back tonight
my friend James
from high school is getting
his guitar set up
so I may bring
him on to
play the slide guitar a little bit
maybe tonight
but anyway thank you everyone
and have a good
whatever time of day it is for you
on Tuesday
I appreciate it
the two of you
and we still got a lot more research
to do
but I'll keep
throwing research papers up
and you guys can riff off it
that will be later
thanks for letting me share some time
with you there Howard
I appreciate you coming on
see you everyone
