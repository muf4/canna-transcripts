[00:02.240 --> 00:07.800]  All right, hello everyone. I think this everything is working properly. I think I
[00:07.800 --> 00:11.440]  figured out how to do a sound check beforehand so I don't really have to
[00:11.440 --> 00:17.400]  ask you guys every show anymore. I don't think so. So we'll see. Welcome everyone.
[00:17.400 --> 00:21.520]  We're here to talk about ugly plants that get you high for hours when you
[00:21.520 --> 00:28.640]  smoke them. That's that's the plan. I've been getting a lot of questions about
[00:28.640 --> 00:32.600]  these types of plants since I put them out there. I put a bunch of them out
[00:32.600 --> 00:38.720]  there. So there's Peter. I got a message from Facebook saying that this
[00:38.720 --> 00:42.440]  thing's probably not going to stream because I was a few minutes late. So if
[00:42.440 --> 00:51.400]  you need to fix that, have at it Bubba. Where was I? Yeah, yeah, ugly plants that
[00:51.400 --> 01:00.270]  get you high for hours. And yeah, so I figured that I would just get on here
[01:00.270 --> 01:05.470]  and talk about what I've seen in these types of plants for years so that you
[01:05.470 --> 01:09.510]  can know what to expect and I don't have to answer a bunch of questions in the
[01:09.510 --> 01:15.150]  in comments and DMs and stuff like that. So it's I figured that this would be an
[01:15.150 --> 01:20.830]  efficient way to take care of it and I'm hoping for a lot of chat participation
[01:20.830 --> 01:28.150]  in this. So let's hope this this goes well. So all good, Peter says. Good. All
[01:28.150 --> 01:33.870]  right. Sorry. Sorry about that. So I'm gonna sit here and take a few puffs and
[01:33.870 --> 01:39.590]  yeah this is this is for the people that have... I've noticed that people have a
[01:39.590 --> 01:47.950]  tendency to really dive in the deep end on things and I noticed that some some
[01:48.030 --> 01:53.590]  people got these these hay seeds that this is one of their, if not their first
[01:53.590 --> 01:58.110]  grow, but one of their first grows. It's like they're you know they're diving in
[01:58.110 --> 02:02.710]  the deep end of the pool and they haven't swum yet. So I figured that
[02:02.710 --> 02:08.990]  it's not impossible. I was like, hey if you want to grow a big long flowering
[02:08.990 --> 02:15.430]  thing your first run, have at it. It's to each their own. But I really I'll get
[02:15.430 --> 02:21.190]  into it. I really think that it's a it's better to... I've got written down here
[02:21.190 --> 02:28.750]  grow something else. Yeah, grow something else. And I don't mean that as they don't
[02:28.750 --> 02:36.190]  don't grow hazes and these long flowering sativas or whatever. I'm trying
[02:36.190 --> 02:41.790]  not gonna try to mind my mouth and not create the argument in the chat over
[02:41.790 --> 02:45.430]  indica and sativa and all of that. So let's just get that out of the way. I
[02:45.430 --> 02:49.150]  really don't give a shit. I grew up calling them sativas so it just slips
[02:49.150 --> 02:53.830]  out of my mouth all the time. So it'll it probably will throughout the show. Don't
[02:53.830 --> 02:59.790]  hold it against me. So yeah these these long flowering plants are a little bit
[02:59.790 --> 03:04.750]  finicky and it's really it's not best for the first-time grower to start off
[03:04.750 --> 03:07.470]  with something that's gonna give them a hell of a lot of problems right off the
[03:07.470 --> 03:12.030]  bat because it's that's discouraging. And that's not the point. You know as
[03:12.030 --> 03:16.350]  gardening should be fun whether you're growing weed or anything else. It should
[03:16.350 --> 03:23.510]  it should be fun. And so yeah so I'm gonna like just give some tips of things
[03:23.510 --> 03:27.070]  that I've learned along the way picking up their experience and then things that
[03:27.070 --> 03:32.590]  I've picked up from other people that I've tried. Yeah on the the difficulty
[03:32.590 --> 03:36.430]  level of plants there really is such a thing. It's like not many breeders have
[03:36.430 --> 03:43.670]  it but some do. And they have like a like a scale on their site of the
[03:43.670 --> 03:48.750]  difficulty of that thing to grow. Mr. Nice is one of them. There's a another
[03:48.750 --> 03:52.630]  there's an American one too. I can't it's slipping my mind right now. But yeah
[03:52.630 --> 03:56.910]  there's a difficulty scale so that people know what kind of endeavor
[03:56.910 --> 04:00.990]  they're getting into. And it's not just because it's long flowering that
[04:00.990 --> 04:06.230]  makes it hard. There's all kinds of like not hard but interesting let's just say
[04:06.270 --> 04:10.910]  it makes it interesting. These are very interesting plants in a lot of ways. So
[04:10.910 --> 04:19.230]  yeah it's so yeah let's get into it. First of all let's not get into it. I'd
[04:19.230 --> 04:24.990]  like to shout out the ladies out there. I'm doing this for a specific reason but
[04:24.990 --> 04:31.350]  the ladies in cannabis like the the wives and the girlfriends and moms and
[04:31.350 --> 04:37.310]  grandmas and sisters and aunts and all you know all the ladies that support us
[04:37.310 --> 04:42.830]  guys doing our thing with this plant. Because it's it's it's a male dominated
[04:42.830 --> 04:50.950]  like we for some reason it's mostly guys that get deep deep deep into this plant.
[04:50.950 --> 04:57.350]  So it's you know and we we all have a supporting cast of ladies out there that
[04:57.350 --> 05:00.830]  are helping us. And it's like that's why I listed all of the different types
[05:00.830 --> 05:04.710]  because it's not always a wife or a girlfriend or mom. It's it's just the
[05:04.710 --> 05:11.710]  ladies. Thank you ladies for being there and like kind of just as a backstop to
[05:11.710 --> 05:17.390]  just let us know that we're not we're not doing the wrong thing you know.
[05:17.390 --> 05:25.870]  So yeah it's just yeah thanks. And my wife in particular she's made a lot of
[05:25.870 --> 05:30.750]  sacrifices and I'm sure a lot of them out there do. And it's like we don't go
[05:30.750 --> 05:37.110]  on vacations. We can't I can't go anywhere. I can't you know. That's the
[05:37.110 --> 05:42.230]  that we've we've tried that a few times and I just don't enjoy myself and neither
[05:42.230 --> 05:46.110]  does she. And it's you know I'm not trying to get all personal here but yeah
[05:46.110 --> 05:50.950]  the the ladies make sacrifices in support of us. They smoke a lot of if
[05:50.950 --> 05:54.830]  you're into making your own seeds and stuff especially with this kind of shit
[05:54.830 --> 05:58.550]  behind me. It's not every plant is a fucking winner. So you're going through
[05:58.550 --> 06:02.230]  and you're testing this stuff and she's she's smoking it with you. You know
[06:02.230 --> 06:06.630]  she smoked a lot of shit weed. Not really shit weed but not you know not the best.
[06:06.630 --> 06:10.630]  Testing males is another thing. That's not always pleasant. Sometimes you can
[06:10.630 --> 06:16.990]  get a headache testing the male. And yeah so yeah this is yeah shout out to the
[06:16.990 --> 06:25.430]  ladies that help us and encourage us and and keep us doing our thing. And yeah
[06:25.430 --> 06:36.910]  so okay thanks. Yeah grow something else first. I really do kind of mean that.
[06:36.910 --> 06:43.110]  It's like you start off with like a plant that's like kind of if you can
[06:43.110 --> 06:46.710]  something known as I prefer going through seeds. But if you want to get a
[06:46.750 --> 06:50.030]  cutting of something to where somebody that's giving it to you can say this is
[06:50.030 --> 06:54.750]  exactly what you can expect at this many days. And like that's handy for the first
[06:54.750 --> 06:58.950]  time grower no doubt about it. So yeah anything to make it easier on yourself
[06:58.950 --> 07:05.070]  when you're first starting out. So but you're not making it easier on yourself
[07:05.070 --> 07:09.830]  if you're starting with the haze or you or if you're even some indica's. I was
[07:09.830 --> 07:16.190]  talking day before yesterday I guess it was with Chris and Cheddar about this guy
[07:16.190 --> 07:25.830]  in LA that picked up the 88 G13 and grew it outside. And like it just that plant
[07:25.830 --> 07:29.270]  was not meant to be it don't grow that shit outside. It's not meant to be grown
[07:29.270 --> 07:34.670]  outside. But other things are they do better outside. So anyway that's that I'm
[07:34.670 --> 07:39.070]  getting off track a little bit here. But it's like this you kind of have to when
[07:39.070 --> 07:43.510]  you're starting out it makes it much easier if you know what the hell you're
[07:43.510 --> 07:48.390]  dealing with. And then you can start exploring and like then then it's time
[07:48.390 --> 07:52.710]  for adventure. It's like your first hike when you go out into the woods you don't
[07:52.710 --> 07:59.390]  like you don't go out there by yourself without like a no no like marked trails
[07:59.390 --> 08:05.150]  or you get what I'm saying. It just it doesn't it's not gonna end up well in
[08:05.150 --> 08:10.910]  most cases. So there we go. All right now on to the tips. I've done rambling on and
[08:10.910 --> 08:17.630]  on. One of the best tips that I learned I picked up on the Mr. Nice website on
[08:17.630 --> 08:22.710]  his forum is to when you're growing these plants that are really long
[08:22.710 --> 08:28.510]  flowering it's best to like if you're growing them inside to flip them like it
[08:28.510 --> 08:33.070]  like the third or fourth node. You could probably I've never done it but you
[08:33.070 --> 08:36.950]  could probably grow them 12-12 from seedling and you'll still get like a
[08:37.070 --> 08:52.200]  couple foot tall plant. So anyway it's Lisa McCarvel no I'm so sorry that's not
[08:52.200 --> 08:59.000]  that's not how I meant it. That's I'm very sorry. That yeah there needs to be
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.600]  more reviews what I'm saying what I was really getting at and I appreciate all
[09:03.600 --> 09:07.440]  of the ones in the past that have like kind of just stayed in the shadows and a
[09:07.440 --> 09:11.600]  lot of them still do. They hang out in the shadows and they just like my my
[09:11.600 --> 09:14.200]  wife's not gonna get on this camera and talk to you about weed. She knows a
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.600]  little bit about weed too. She smokes pretty good stuff. So yeah I'm very sorry
[09:19.600 --> 09:25.320]  Lisa I didn't that's not how I meant it and thank you for yeah thank you for
[09:25.320 --> 09:33.480]  straightening me out there. Need to complete my thoughts. Yes so back on the
[09:33.480 --> 09:37.480]  the long flowering plants that's what we're here for. You're not here to listen
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.160]  me talk about nonsense. So yeah flip flip them early. Like I said I've never
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.800]  started them off at 12-12 but there's people out there that have done that and it's
[09:46.800 --> 09:56.320]  you know it's it's interesting. It's yeah there you can get a very nice size plant
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.440]  inside where it's like gonna be like causing you light issues even if you
[10:01.440 --> 10:06.320]  flip it at like the third or fourth node. So this one behind me I probably I
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.280]  flipped it at like the fifth or the sixth and it's like it's probably about
[10:11.280 --> 10:19.960]  two and a half three feet tall. So it's yeah it's a yeah that's one of the nicer
[10:19.960 --> 10:24.760]  things about these these longer flowering plants is because really you're
[10:24.760 --> 10:30.080]  it's not actually it yes it's longer flowering but you're not it's not taking
[10:30.080 --> 10:38.400]  a lot more time to produce the same amount of product. And that's true. I can
[10:38.400 --> 10:41.840]  honest that I know this from experience. It's that's just how it works because
[10:41.840 --> 10:48.280]  you're saving on a lot of that veg time especially like a really good indica. It
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.880]  seems like the really good indica plants are like some of the slowest vegging
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.000]  things. It's like you know not all of them there's there's good ones that are
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.040]  faster vegging to my the one that I've got back there that I've kept for a
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.960]  while now it's a pretty fast vegging one. But like this those like that I see that
[11:06.960 --> 11:13.160]  as a northern light straight is that that really slow slow vegging short
[11:13.160 --> 11:19.400]  stocky tight as hell rock bud kind of thing you know there was other ones too
[11:19.400 --> 11:27.520]  but that's that's yeah to me that's some NL one shit wonderful shit so yeah but
[11:27.520 --> 11:30.080]  that's not what we're here to talk about we're here to talk about the opposite of
[11:30.080 --> 11:37.920]  that and so another thing that is a very very useful to know with these damn
[11:37.920 --> 11:44.520]  things is feeding them. Don't. Don't until it tells you to. Like I know with people
[11:44.520 --> 11:48.600]  with their living soil they got these rich it's like it's it's kind of you're
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.600]  always feeding I know that but it's kind of a lighter feeding and you guys may be
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.000]  able to get away with that kind of I really don't know what your system is
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.380]  and how much inputs how crazy you've gotten or how crazy you are with dumping
[12:03.380 --> 12:08.200]  KNF on all the time you know or is it I don't know so that that's part of the
[12:08.200 --> 12:11.960]  reason why I'm here talking today is because I've learned in a very short
[12:11.960 --> 12:16.480]  time that you have no idea whose hands these seeds are going into and I found
[12:16.600 --> 12:23.120]  out that there's a lot of new growers that spend a lot of money on seeds yeah
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.280]  it's just like that that's yeah it's kind of smart if you're like it's going
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.440]  in and doing your research there was this guy he developed the same dude in
[12:35.440 --> 12:43.360]  LA he has one of the most beautiful like just an amazing collection I watched him
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.200]  this collection of seeds last year and it was like he had been at this for
[12:48.200 --> 12:53.240]  years he was going he was going for all of the right names like so that that
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.100]  like it not only like he picked up my seeds from the bog auction so that like
[12:59.100 --> 13:04.040]  touched my heart so he had a special place in my my mind anyway and then he
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.120]  was just a cool fucking guy and I was like I tried to help him as much as I
[13:08.120 --> 13:13.080]  could along the way but I I can't finish it for you like he ended up like it this
[13:13.200 --> 13:19.200]  stuff ended up in a hot garage at like 90 degrees for he said just a couple
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.760]  days but that's all it'll take you know it's that that 88 g13 is so subtle that
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.360]  like the what makes it great it'll go away getting hot like that it's gonna
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.800]  poof it out so anyway that's sad but you know what my point is is that you never
[13:34.800 --> 13:40.680]  know whose hands these plants are going into and I really didn't take that into
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.120]  consideration I tried to put out a nice long description with this stuff but I
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.880]  learned that it can never be long enough apparently it'll never be long enough so
[13:51.880 --> 13:58.680]  whatever anyway I was that you know I was just one wanting to get the and also
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.600]  found out that some people that they were just happy to actually get narrow
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.840]  leaf plants like they were actually finally a like they bought a lot of
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.320]  stuff that they were wanted to they wanted to try a narrow leaf plants and
[14:10.440 --> 14:16.000]  they straight up told me this that they don't care if this thing Herms or if it
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.200]  finishes on time or they were just happy that they were able to see a plant with
[14:21.200 --> 14:25.720]  narrow leaves after so many years of buying stuff from people and wanting to
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.440]  just and you know it's you never know what's gonna make a customer happy and
[14:30.440 --> 14:35.960]  that was more than one person saying that so that that was interesting to me
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.000]  is that they were just like that was part of the reason for me putting all of
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.360]  that stuff out there I not only through Peter but I've given a lot of seeds away
[14:44.360 --> 14:50.160]  to just cool people in these chat rooms that I take a shine to I really like so
[14:50.160 --> 14:56.440]  we hook up elsewhere and you know get the thing done so anyway so I've yeah
[14:56.440 --> 15:06.640]  I'm here to yeah kind of the people that haven't that are like that that just
[15:06.640 --> 15:10.280]  want to see your narrow leaf plant I want you to be successful with that so
[15:10.280 --> 15:18.000]  I'm gonna do everything that I can today to help out so yeah flip it early don't
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.120]  feed it unless it tells you to and I guess I should explain that too is that
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.120]  that's why you need to grow other plants first is so that you know that it's
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.560]  telling you that it needs food and what type of food that it needs so that's why
[15:33.560 --> 15:39.280]  I started off with saying is grow something else get get to know cannabis
[15:39.280 --> 15:45.660]  plants and then get into these stranger cannabis plants that you can yeah then
[15:45.660 --> 15:52.220]  you can read them and not overfeed them and burn it or what you can ruin a haze
[15:52.220 --> 15:58.560]  plant in many ways many many ways and one of them is overfeeding it it's just
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.280]  gonna cause you all kinds of problems but hermaphrodites could be one of them
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.120]  is that I'm not going to get into specifics but there's a lot of problems
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.960]  it'll boof it out like you you cannot get trichomes by giving too many giving
[16:12.960 --> 16:20.800]  too much nitrogen to a plant will make a plant not produce trichomes so yeah
[16:20.800 --> 16:26.560]  tropoholic New Zealand I'm not talking about specific strains really I'm
[16:26.680 --> 16:34.760]  talking about the general long flowering like what I'm most familiar with the
[16:34.760 --> 16:41.880]  earth a hazes but I've noticed that that these hazes come from all of these land
[16:41.880 --> 16:46.360]  races that people are playing with now so I figured that it would apply to them
[16:46.360 --> 16:53.840]  too because I've seen all types of forms of these of these long flowering plants
[16:53.840 --> 17:02.560]  so what I mean what use does it to name a strain I'm not like here to talk about
[17:02.560 --> 17:11.720]  a specific strain so it's the anyway yes I'm just talking I'm here to talk about
[17:11.720 --> 17:17.920]  just the generalities on specific haze plants is if at the end of this is you
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.960]  want to talk about the the stuff that I've put out there that I have like it I
[17:23.080 --> 17:27.320]  have even if I've just like given it to you like met up with you in a chat room
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.960]  and like giving you something I've seen a lot of that like I'm not gonna put
[17:31.960 --> 17:35.120]  stuff out there that I haven't seen enough of to where I know what you're
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.840]  getting I want to know what you're looking at so I you know what I mean is
[17:39.840 --> 17:44.120]  that I don't want to I don't want to waste people's time I know that there's
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.360]  especially with shit like this is you're dedicating a lot of time to these longer
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.200]  flowering plants in the selection process not necessarily in the flowering
[17:54.200 --> 17:57.960]  process but the selection process takes a while and that's why the people that
[17:57.960 --> 18:01.960]  sell these longer flowering plants is their seeds are a little bit more
[18:01.960 --> 18:06.080]  expensive as if you notice if you go through the mr. nice lineup his hazes
[18:06.080 --> 18:11.120]  are the most expensive and some of the indica stuff it's great weed but it's
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.400]  cheaper because he doesn't have to go through a bunch of those it's not it's
[18:17.400 --> 18:21.000]  a completely different animal than going through and like really selecting
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.120]  some quality parents out of one of these long flowering plants like this one that
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.800]  I've got behind me it's just that it it's a like a year at the very least
[18:32.800 --> 18:39.200]  that's at the very least it takes a year to select something out and be like okay
[18:39.200 --> 18:45.200]  I like this I like where this is headed and then you you know then you get then
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.600]  you can really get to know it after that so yeah that's it's it's a real
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.480]  process and it takes dedication and stuff like that and these plants so
[18:53.480 --> 18:58.640]  it's not for the person that if you really want to find a good one it's not
[18:58.640 --> 19:03.880]  for the person that's like buying a bunch of packs and just like they pop
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.760]  the pack they just keep the females out of it then they just run it once and
[19:08.760 --> 19:18.820]  like they pick the one that they like the best out of that not that is not
[19:18.820 --> 19:26.980]  that it's lost my train of thought there but essentially it's like just going
[19:26.980 --> 19:31.420]  through and running something once is what I was saying is these plants you
[19:31.420 --> 19:36.060]  need to really like take some time and go through them and like keep something
[19:36.060 --> 19:40.340]  around that you may not think will be the best the first time but then when
[19:40.340 --> 19:44.100]  you get it and you see when when it's done and you smoke it is like okay think
[19:44.100 --> 19:47.020]  that thing didn't look like it had a lot of resin on it but the resin that it's
[19:47.020 --> 19:52.740]  got keeps me high for three or four hours and that's what I want so okay I
[19:52.740 --> 19:58.820]  don't care if it doesn't have a lot of resin on it and you know it's a that
[19:58.820 --> 20:04.700]  yeah some of the the the more resinous plants aren't always the strongest as
[20:04.700 --> 20:15.100]  they have a lot of not much you know so it's better to have a little bit a lot
[20:15.100 --> 20:20.660]  you feel me and that's what and this this is really hard to get used to but
[20:20.660 --> 20:29.660]  stuff like that has a little bit of a lot and that's if you catch my drift so
[20:29.980 --> 20:36.300]  another another problem I guess you could say is with these plants is
[20:36.300 --> 20:43.140]  structural if you notice what I've got back here it's that's that's him that's
[20:43.140 --> 20:46.580]  just the hemp plant behind me you know that's dead you know it might it might be
[20:46.580 --> 20:53.060]  a little hot who knows I don't know it could be hot but yeah that is hemp type
[20:53.060 --> 20:58.900]  of structure and I kind of like that because the other option is this
[20:58.900 --> 21:04.540]  candelabra kind of deal where you got like maybe ten of those things to deal
[21:04.540 --> 21:15.700]  with so it yeah that kind of that that makes a difference to me so it to me it
[21:15.700 --> 21:19.900]  doesn't matter it actually it's kind of a benefit that it's kind of shaped like
[21:19.900 --> 21:27.540]  a like a hemp stalk and it just has that that big one big wiffle ball bat thing
[21:27.540 --> 21:33.900]  at the end when it's done so you know it's it's a to each their own some
[21:33.900 --> 21:37.820]  people want they want to but they want a bunch of it with that candelabra stuff
[21:37.820 --> 21:41.940]  but you still get quite a bit you just grow you know grow them in tight like
[21:41.940 --> 21:50.820]  they you know just like yeah just like hemp because that's what it is right
[21:50.820 --> 21:58.820]  it's a so yeah there's structural things there there's that there's also
[21:58.820 --> 22:07.540]  hormonal insanity there is a lot of hormonal imbalance in in these plants so
[22:07.540 --> 22:15.060]  and you know it can be selected away from it's like when on the scale like I
[22:15.060 --> 22:20.260]  would say that the the stuff that I just take the stuff that I gave to Peter the
[22:20.260 --> 22:23.740]  stuff that I gave the Peter the most stable hormonally wise would have been
[22:23.740 --> 22:29.620]  the dreamtime haze because that was just an open pollination from a dreamtime
[22:29.620 --> 22:37.700]  haze mix pack from Shanti that was all haze so that was yeah that you're gonna
[22:37.700 --> 22:44.540]  have a better chance of finding something that's gonna be not unruly and
[22:44.540 --> 22:50.540]  like big jungle 20-foot jungle weed inside and all of this stuff that it's
[22:50.540 --> 22:55.940]  it's got it's more selected he's done work on that shit so it's a it and
[22:55.940 --> 23:00.740]  there's a reason that they've kept those parents around so damn long so that yes
[23:00.740 --> 23:05.740]  he's by him doing all of that work you you get less Hermes because that just
[23:05.740 --> 23:10.500]  ruins your business in the cannabis seed world and then there's also the the
[23:10.500 --> 23:14.020]  structural issues that I was talking about he's he had to keep all of that
[23:14.020 --> 23:19.220]  into consideration but when you're a guy like like him you got a fucking you
[23:19.220 --> 23:24.780]  know pick you can't pick for yourself you're it's it's a business you're
[23:24.780 --> 23:27.940]  running so you got to be thinking about what people are getting out there not
[23:27.940 --> 23:33.220]  what you're like it like it's not everybody wants the the hemp hempy
[23:33.220 --> 23:38.340]  structure like I've got right there so yeah so you gotta give somebody a little
[23:38.340 --> 23:43.540]  bit of everything so it gets complicated as I can't imagine those people like
[23:43.540 --> 23:47.260]  that out there that have a bunch of different things that they've got to
[23:47.260 --> 23:53.140]  keep fairly consistent and on the market and as props to them man absolutely so
[23:53.140 --> 23:57.220]  yeah it's the that that would have been the most stable is that dreamtime stuff
[23:57.220 --> 24:04.460]  and it's like that that would be a comparable to what you all over there is
[24:04.620 --> 24:13.900]  what you guys over in in Europe and everything as you guys know more about
[24:13.900 --> 24:18.580]  that stuff than what the the Americans out on the west coast and on the east
[24:18.580 --> 24:26.840]  coast those hazes seem to be like a completely different thing from what was
[24:26.840 --> 24:30.900]  selected over in Europe it's like I'm not going to get into the New York and
[24:30.900 --> 24:36.860]  the Florida and the Cali and everybody knows about these different types of
[24:36.860 --> 24:42.260]  sativas and all of that and that's why I'm I'm trying to not get into specifics
[24:42.260 --> 24:50.220]  and there's a reason that I'm staying on that tropa holic so yeah the hormonal
[24:50.220 --> 24:54.420]  insanity is that's something that you you're just going to have to deal with
[24:54.420 --> 24:58.100]  when you're playing with these long flowering things it's just that I think
[24:58.300 --> 25:05.060]  that it's part of the survival mechanism in the tropics and these tropical plants
[25:05.060 --> 25:10.980]  are they just they have that survival net mechanism a little bit closer to the
[25:10.980 --> 25:16.100]  surface than the other so it's like that hormonal imbalances is just something
[25:16.100 --> 25:24.220]  that's there a little bit more than in the broadleaf indica type plants also
[25:24.220 --> 25:30.580]  that hormonal stuff is the reason for my thinking on this the way that it is
[25:30.580 --> 25:37.340]  is because it gets worse when you bring it inside and that even till it tells me
[25:37.340 --> 25:41.340]  even more that these plants want to be in the wild in the environment that
[25:41.340 --> 25:48.300]  they're supposed to be in and they they pitch a bitch if they are not in in the
[25:48.300 --> 25:53.060]  in the type of environment and the right shoes and everything getting the right
[25:53.060 --> 25:58.980]  amount of water that's another thing you can whether it's lowland long
[25:58.980 --> 26:03.500]  flowering or highland long flowering and with these hazes you never know which
[26:03.500 --> 26:09.180]  ones you're going to get is that you know you don't because it's so mixed up
[26:09.180 --> 26:14.460]  you don't know if you're going to get a low lowland expression that can take a
[26:14.460 --> 26:17.980]  lot of water in the roots or if you're going to get a highland expression that
[26:17.980 --> 26:21.460]  doesn't take a lot of water in the roots and that goes back to the very first
[26:21.580 --> 26:25.980]  thing that I said here is that you you need to get to know the plant first you
[26:25.980 --> 26:29.540]  need to get to know other plants first and then you can start playing with
[26:29.540 --> 26:34.340]  these more complicated varieties because these that that's one of the reasons for
[26:34.340 --> 26:38.740]  my general generalization is because there's lowland and then there's
[26:38.740 --> 26:44.940]  highland both indica and sativas and here I go getting please don't start an
[26:44.940 --> 26:48.740]  argument about indica and sativa over there we all know the we all know that
[26:48.860 --> 26:54.260]  stuff so anyway yeah the so it's you you really need to know what it is that
[26:54.260 --> 27:00.860]  you're dealing with and with the with the hazes that I am familiar with you
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.020]  can get either you can get lowland expressions or highland expressions and
[27:05.020 --> 27:08.780]  you just got got to know what you're dealing with there and how to how to
[27:08.780 --> 27:14.060]  treat them and yeah I guess that's all I need to say about that is it gets it
[27:14.060 --> 27:22.740]  gets worse inside all of these problems get worse inside so but growing it
[27:22.740 --> 27:28.180]  inside is the only option for a lot of people and these things doing it's
[27:28.180 --> 27:32.860]  getting it to finish properly outside is a whole other problem there's some that
[27:32.860 --> 27:38.780]  trigger way late I I'm lucky to have something that's acclimated that I can
[27:38.780 --> 27:47.180]  put out there and it triggers really early like late summer like but not well
[27:47.180 --> 27:56.340]  I guess midsummer yeah mid each year is different so I don't like giving exact
[27:56.340 --> 28:01.900]  dates but it's like it's earlier than then an indica does that's for sure for
[28:01.900 --> 28:07.540]  sure and another thing with growing these type plants outside is animals
[28:07.580 --> 28:17.820]  fucking animals the animal they it you know it's like I said it's hemp it's it's
[28:17.820 --> 28:23.340]  a little hempy so they will if you have a short broadleaf and one of these
[28:23.340 --> 28:26.980]  things growing next to each other outside the animal is going to eat this
[28:26.980 --> 28:32.860]  first it's going to eat this first because it's sweeter I guess I've
[28:32.860 --> 28:36.060]  noticed that myself when you chew on different types of cannabis leaves is
[28:36.220 --> 28:40.780]  these narrow leafed plants have a sweeter taste to them than the the
[28:40.780 --> 28:45.140]  indica's do the indica's are like a little little bitter a little more
[28:45.140 --> 28:51.940]  bitter so yeah this is and it's that you know that that's not that's not
[28:51.940 --> 29:00.140]  universal either but for the most case the the deer will eat this before it'll
[29:00.140 --> 29:03.860]  get to the other stuff like that's a they'll they go after what they like
[29:03.900 --> 29:08.380]  first so that's a problem with these things if you're growing it outside too
[29:08.380 --> 29:13.300]  not only finishing it but well finishing it because of the Sun but finishing it
[29:13.300 --> 29:18.980]  because of the deer so yeah that's a that's something that I have down here
[29:18.980 --> 29:24.300]  that I figured I better touch on the animals like like that stuff and it
[29:24.300 --> 29:28.820]  makes sense the animals should like that stuff they they need to be fed more of
[29:28.820 --> 29:33.100]  it as cattle farmers like that when they when they grow this stuff they have to
[29:33.100 --> 29:41.380]  like protect it and whatnot so anyway choosing plants that fit your needs
[29:41.380 --> 29:46.220]  absolutely that's with any anything whether it's vegetables or cannabis this
[29:46.220 --> 29:53.700]  type or any other is that the cannabis that suits your needs and like structural
[29:53.700 --> 29:58.020]  qualifications like what I was talking about your head like of course that's
[29:58.020 --> 30:04.780]  why we're growing this stuff is for for our head so there's always that to
[30:04.780 --> 30:10.860]  consider so when you when you get into
[30:10.860 --> 30:18.980]  like looking for seed of this type of thing when you're you know if you're in
[30:18.980 --> 30:24.180]  the market for if you want to get some some narrow leaf stuff take what the
[30:24.180 --> 30:33.740]  the person's telling you seriously but like it's probably best to not like go
[30:33.740 --> 30:40.980]  in there looking for exactly that and so
[30:41.140 --> 30:49.900]  when you're uh yeah it's it's best to find what you like not what they're
[30:49.900 --> 30:54.300]  saying that they found in there that they liked that's a that's a nice guide
[30:54.300 --> 30:58.820]  but really when you're investing this kind of time and effort into something
[30:58.820 --> 31:05.780]  is do you really care what somebody else wants seriously you know so that's how I
[31:05.780 --> 31:11.540]  look at it is it's nice to use their description as a guide but it's it's
[31:11.540 --> 31:16.620]  best to go in there really searching for something that's gonna suit whatever
[31:16.780 --> 31:23.260]  growing style I keep doing I'm not learning it's something that's going to
[31:23.260 --> 31:31.340]  keep your that's gonna meet your growing style whether inside or out whether the
[31:31.340 --> 31:36.380]  the effects and the flavors are going to be something that you're you're after
[31:36.380 --> 31:42.460]  and you know and hopefully a few of these things that I was talking about
[31:42.580 --> 31:46.460]  today will save you a little bit of headaches along the way because there's
[31:46.460 --> 31:51.100]  there's a lot of headaches to be had when dealing with these types of plants
[31:51.100 --> 31:54.100]  if you're just like going in and expecting and that like it's gonna be
[31:54.100 --> 31:59.980]  like the cutting that you ran for years or something or it's it really is a
[31:59.980 --> 32:04.540]  completely different animal and you know a lot of people going they hear all of
[32:04.540 --> 32:09.900]  this stuff already but they look they don't really take it seriously so I'm
[32:09.900 --> 32:19.420]  like I'm kind of just hoping to like help people out in some form that if
[32:19.420 --> 32:24.300]  they go in and they get there they're getting stuck in the mud they got in a
[32:24.300 --> 32:30.220]  little too deep that maybe that they can kind of find a way towards the light a
[32:30.220 --> 32:38.740]  little bit I don't I'm kind of rambling on here but that anyway it's the with
[32:38.740 --> 32:43.820]  these long flowering plants it takes a lot of dedication Chad said over here
[32:43.820 --> 32:48.580]  that it's a labor of love it absolutely is it's a it's a labor of love and that
[32:48.580 --> 32:54.740]  the a plant that keeps you high for hours it it makes it worth it it really
[32:54.740 --> 33:01.780]  does it makes the that that labor of love even more like intimate there's
[33:01.860 --> 33:12.060]  more love there between the two of you so it's like when you when you when
[33:12.060 --> 33:15.660]  you're getting into these kind of plants and you're dedicating all of that time
[33:15.660 --> 33:20.980]  to it and really getting to know them like I'm talking about it really you
[33:20.980 --> 33:31.510]  really develop a relationship with it and they they reciprocate it in a lot of
[33:31.510 --> 33:36.230]  ways is they start to it's almost like the you know how you get kind of burned
[33:36.230 --> 33:41.750]  out on a lot of types of weed this is kind of the opposite yes I keep fucking
[33:41.750 --> 33:51.110]  doing this stuff is the opposite it it really yeah it kind of you you develop a
[33:51.110 --> 33:57.350]  kind of a symbiotic symbiosis with it if you really find something that jives
[33:57.510 --> 34:07.470]  with you man so there's a reason that I really like this stuff is that it's
[34:07.470 --> 34:14.590]  it's really one of the the the highlights of my life one of the things
[34:14.590 --> 34:20.390]  that I have run across that has given me the most pleasure and in my time on
[34:20.390 --> 34:25.630]  earth and that's why I wanted to spread it around as much as I could is because
[34:25.750 --> 34:31.710]  those seeds were just sitting there getting old and events happen and I know
[34:31.710 --> 34:37.150]  people are shy ste so I thought that it was best just best to flood as much as I
[34:37.150 --> 34:43.590]  could with it and the power and the reach that I have so it's that's that's
[34:43.590 --> 34:51.430]  all I could do being who I am so that's all I was able so yeah it's these plants
[34:51.430 --> 34:57.590]  that I think that they're good for the world all cannabis plants but the these
[34:57.590 --> 35:02.870]  long longer flowering more introspective and keep you high for a long time stuff
[35:02.870 --> 35:10.750]  that I think that it's here to help the human race in more ways than just like
[35:10.750 --> 35:18.470]  checking out like it's it motivates you it makes you creative and you think
[35:18.470 --> 35:22.150]  about things on a completely different level than you would if you hadn't
[35:22.150 --> 35:29.190]  smoked that crazy haze you know so yeah it's it's a wonderful thing they said
[35:29.190 --> 35:33.510]  there's a reason I love it so much so I said I want to I want people to be
[35:33.510 --> 35:40.090]  successful with the shit so yeah grow some hot hemp absolutely good there I go
[35:40.090 --> 35:47.150]  doing again hot hemp grow the hot hemp so yeah what else do I got down here
[35:47.190 --> 35:54.750]  juice plants fit your knees uh yeah males that hold solid and veg this is a
[35:54.750 --> 36:00.990]  you know this is good for all cannabis plants is just general but it the ones
[36:00.990 --> 36:07.350]  that the long flowering if you got a long flowering male and it's like you
[36:07.350 --> 36:13.950]  like rub the stems and stuff it's kind of sticky young and just got a stink to
[36:13.950 --> 36:22.270]  it and that thing you can have it in the in the veg cycle and it never pops
[36:22.270 --> 36:29.670]  out a male flower okay that is a plant to look at that that's something worth
[36:29.670 --> 36:37.030]  like giving a shot because what I've found over time because I've done a lot
[36:37.030 --> 36:42.710]  of these these pollinations with these damn things is that the it does turn out
[36:42.710 --> 36:48.070]  that those ones that are a little easier to keep around with the I haven't
[36:48.070 --> 36:53.890]  found this to be so so much the case with the with indica type plants but the
[36:53.890 --> 36:58.470]  with with the hazes this has been pretty consistent and you know general
[36:58.470 --> 37:02.470]  statements or general fucking statements I understand that that's why that's why
[37:02.470 --> 37:09.550]  that guy from New Zealand don't like me anyway so uh yeah the a male that can
[37:09.550 --> 37:16.270]  hold his nut is valuable and I think the ladies already know this but a male
[37:16.270 --> 37:22.150]  that can hold in veg and doesn't like shoot up shoot its flowers out is worth
[37:22.150 --> 37:27.070]  keeping around especially if he's like sticky and shit like that flower him out
[37:27.070 --> 37:31.910]  see what his flower structure looks like if what's the smell like smoke it see if
[37:31.910 --> 37:36.430]  you get you high and you know pollinate with it see see what the progeny is like
[37:36.430 --> 37:44.430]  but that those seem to be yeah there there's something else and there's also
[37:44.430 --> 37:55.910]  a thing in haze this isn't a male specific thing but the the hazes that
[37:55.910 --> 38:04.190]  bleed the ones that read I've never had a broadleaf plant that I've cut and I've
[38:04.350 --> 38:07.950]  grown a lot of both types and hybrids and all of that stuff it is always
[38:07.950 --> 38:13.910]  narrow leaf haze plants that when you take a cutting of it or you're trimming
[38:13.910 --> 38:20.190]  it or something it shoots red liquid out of it and you know people say it's
[38:20.190 --> 38:23.950]  anthocyanins or whatever but is why is it only these plants that are shooting
[38:23.950 --> 38:29.710]  anthocyanins out through the vascular system and that's that is interesting to
[38:29.710 --> 38:34.470]  me that's the this is something that I've seen for years and years like one
[38:34.470 --> 38:39.230]  of some of the very first haze plants that I grew did this and I got on one of
[38:39.230 --> 38:42.790]  the forums is one of the only times that I actually asked a question on one of
[38:42.790 --> 38:46.990]  those forums back in the day I was usually lurked on IC mag but I did like
[38:46.990 --> 38:52.150]  ask one question once and that was what the hell is up with this bleeding plant
[38:52.150 --> 38:59.010]  and they said it's is it haze and as a yeah it what's what the fuck's up with
[38:59.010 --> 39:05.130]  that and they said it's just haze thing I was like okay I thought that because I
[39:05.130 --> 39:10.050]  was feeding I was doing hydro at the time like I was growing this haze inside
[39:10.050 --> 39:15.130]  hydro and it was I had a jungle on my hand so I was like tripping trimming
[39:15.130 --> 39:18.330]  stuff back and a few of these plants were bleeding red not all of them did
[39:18.330 --> 39:23.210]  but some of they bled red what the hell's going on here so I thought that
[39:23.210 --> 39:26.850]  it was something to do with the chemical nutrients with the hydroponic system and
[39:26.850 --> 39:33.450]  all of that I had them in a big so a big 10 15 gallon tubs I guess and it had
[39:33.450 --> 39:37.650]  a bunch of those little net pots in it with the hydroton on it as it was I said
[39:37.650 --> 39:41.930]  I had a jungle on my hands and it was a yeah I noticed that when I was trimming
[39:41.930 --> 39:45.730]  it and one of the first haze grows that I did and it pops up I've got a male
[39:45.730 --> 39:52.570]  back there that's interesting me that it it bleeds that red red sap too so yeah
[39:52.650 --> 39:58.250]  anyway yeah if anybody knows anything about that shit that's uh maybe I'll go
[39:58.250 --> 40:01.770]  up through these comments see if people are talking about that red sap stuff
[40:01.770 --> 40:07.170]  because it's a common thing as a Bodhi I think released a line a few years back
[40:07.170 --> 40:12.250]  it was something to do with that that that red sap to I don't remember names
[40:12.250 --> 40:17.650]  or anything like that but yeah it's this is this is a thing that happens and I
[40:17.650 --> 40:24.570]  don't know what his genetics were and all of that so so yeah yeah there's the
[40:24.570 --> 40:29.730]  the males and I don't know how I got on the red set thing but yeah there's that
[40:29.730 --> 40:41.570]  too I guess this goes with the the territory on these things is a heat and
[40:41.570 --> 40:46.850]  humidity tolerance and yeah you would expect that from fucking tropical plants
[40:47.010 --> 40:54.730]  but it really it's there is a big difference and it's one of the nicer
[40:54.730 --> 41:06.770]  things about this stuff is is it really it's forgiving in that way I do enjoy
[41:06.770 --> 41:10.130]  that about it it's one of the things that makes it nice outdoor weed is
[41:10.130 --> 41:14.930]  because it you've really got to have it like packed in tight it's like that
[41:14.930 --> 41:22.010]  but it's kind of kind of pushing it you know it's it it's very fluffy but it's
[41:22.010 --> 41:32.650]  all like that string of pearl stuff that I posted on my IG is yeah it it's anyway
[41:32.650 --> 41:37.770]  but what I'm getting at is it doesn't have that really like tight tight
[41:37.770 --> 41:48.650]  structure that a lot of the the broadleaf shorter rock nugg plants you
[41:48.650 --> 41:51.930]  know what the hell I'm talking about I said I'm preaching to the choir here but
[41:51.930 --> 41:56.770]  these these things have a more loose open structure that doesn't hold all of
[41:56.770 --> 42:00.430]  that moisture in there so you don't have a lot of fucking bud rot issues it could
[42:00.430 --> 42:03.370]  still happen that's why I was saying that that this one's kind of pushing it
[42:03.370 --> 42:08.250]  but it's like it looks more dense that it is in this picture behind me because
[42:08.250 --> 42:13.130]  it's just like like I said it's a bunch of that string of pearl shit that I
[42:13.130 --> 42:21.170]  posted and had on here the other day so yeah a lot of airflow and I think that's
[42:21.170 --> 42:28.010]  a lot of the reason why that more spread out like more 90 degree angle branch
[42:28.010 --> 42:32.610]  structure that happens on these plants as opposed to on the Indica's they're
[42:32.610 --> 42:38.230]  more like a 45 degree angle coming off of the main stem is these are more like
[42:38.230 --> 42:41.750]  spread out like like I said a candelabra they're more like coming off
[42:41.750 --> 42:47.190]  of at a 90 degree at the at the main stem and coming out because it needs to
[42:47.190 --> 42:51.990]  support itself it's got that big huge knuckle at the where it meets and
[42:51.990 --> 43:00.990]  everything so what I have found is that it's best for my purposes to pick the
[43:00.990 --> 43:05.350]  ones that I like that have this kind of structure on it you can you can do a
[43:05.350 --> 43:13.830]  little bit yeah you don't have as much to deal with with that because it's a
[43:13.830 --> 43:22.670]  bushy weeds just hard to trim I hate trimming and a candelabra I probably did
[43:22.670 --> 43:29.150]  say candelabra I meant candelabra candle like a menorah that's this what I'm
[43:29.150 --> 43:33.350]  trying to say I will say menorah there you go that's that's what I'm trying to
[43:33.350 --> 43:39.630]  describe here so yeah that's funny I love this girl so yeah as the the heat
[43:39.630 --> 43:46.870]  and humidity tolerant thing is nice and where the heat is it it they it holds on
[43:46.870 --> 43:51.830]  to the good stuff it holds on to the good stuff a lot these these type of
[43:51.830 --> 43:56.350]  plants hold on to the good stuff a lot better than the shorter flowering plants
[43:56.350 --> 44:08.230]  do and I think that it's that that that tropical like nature to it is it had to
[44:08.230 --> 44:14.270]  hold so it had to hold it all in so what it what is common in these plants doesn't
[44:14.270 --> 44:18.870]  like flare off as easily as what's common in the other plants I guess so
[44:18.870 --> 44:24.590]  that that would be my guess that's why I'm having the the flavor focused show
[44:24.590 --> 44:32.270]  thing and the yeah that's this is for those interested in that that flavor
[44:32.270 --> 44:37.470]  show I'll get into that for a minute or two as a that's really coming together
[44:37.470 --> 44:42.230]  we we have several chemists and interested in this and I really want to
[44:42.230 --> 44:52.080]  do it right so I'd like to have the the chemist on there to talk about what's
[44:52.080 --> 44:59.120]  going on what they like chemically wise and then all us potheads can get on
[44:59.120 --> 45:02.280]  there and like talk about our experiences and how we found to be able
[45:02.280 --> 45:08.520]  to hold on to all of this shit and all of that is but I'd like to have have the
[45:08.520 --> 45:15.760]  scientists get on there and talk and do their thing and yeah and hopefully if
[45:15.760 --> 45:18.720]  there's more than one on there they don't get into a damn argument or
[45:18.720 --> 45:25.440]  something but it's already kind of have that not an argument but a useful
[45:25.440 --> 45:31.520]  discussion a useful spirited discussion on looking at this this topic of flavors
[45:31.520 --> 45:38.240]  the the more volatile sense and everything from a like they're they're
[45:38.240 --> 45:42.600]  coming at it from different perspectives and and you know and that's that's good
[45:42.600 --> 45:47.520]  that's why I want to have them all on here in like both the scientific side
[45:47.520 --> 45:54.600]  and the the the heads then we'll get that then we'll get the heads on talking
[45:54.600 --> 45:59.480]  about that stuff so yeah spirited discussions oh yeah okay yeah over here
[45:59.480 --> 46:07.540]  in the chat they're talking about pearls yes yes yes pearling strains exactly
[46:07.540 --> 46:13.540]  that's that's what we have back here as if you look on my Instagram I took some
[46:13.540 --> 46:18.500]  pictures where you can actually see what this man is talking about that's yes
[46:18.500 --> 46:22.340]  that's he knows what's what those pearling strains this looks like other
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.060]  people are yeah
[46:26.540 --> 46:34.460]  hillbilly knows what's up too okay yeah it's hey what's up Buddha boy it is a
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.220]  beautiful plant no doubt about that it's PCK is the prettiest weed I've ever
[46:38.220 --> 46:46.180]  grown and yeah it's pretty pretty terpy too yeah nice stuff all right so yeah
[46:46.180 --> 46:50.980]  that's cool you know y'all getting into the pearls yeah I love those things man
[46:50.980 --> 46:56.420]  there's there's something about it I really think that cannabis is in all
[46:56.420 --> 47:03.820]  plants we are too I consciously try to be energy efficient I think that living
[47:03.820 --> 47:09.820]  things are kind of naturally lazy in a way and that's not necessarily a bad
[47:09.820 --> 47:17.660]  thing we're lazy and is that we we know that our calories and our energy are
[47:17.660 --> 47:26.780]  limited and we use it and spend them wisely as wisely as we can as a lot of
[47:26.780 --> 47:31.420]  people and you know is it and sometimes you just splurge and it's like fuck it
[47:31.420 --> 47:36.860]  I'm not thinking about that today but as really I think that humans and animals
[47:36.860 --> 47:45.100]  have seen it a lot in animals animals are very fucking lazy but you see that
[47:45.100 --> 47:50.260]  in a lot of ways and a lot of different animals and humans were animals so yeah
[47:50.260 --> 47:54.660]  efficient not lazy yeah this you're right is that that's what I'm talking
[47:54.660 --> 47:58.940]  about here is what we're efficient with our energy use and plants are no
[47:58.940 --> 48:05.580]  different and these longer flowering plants seem to be some of the most
[48:05.580 --> 48:11.780]  efficient in their energy use because they're they're spending their time on
[48:11.780 --> 48:21.750]  shit stuff that matters like what I what I try to do I try to be conscious of
[48:21.750 --> 48:28.150]  what I spend my time on is worth my fucking time like me sitting here and
[48:28.150 --> 48:32.950]  talking to you for however long I sit here and talk to you guys is to me worth
[48:33.110 --> 48:37.510]  my time it's like even if it's just like hanging out in the chat room and all
[48:37.510 --> 48:43.590]  that me not doing one of these fucking shows it like my wife really encouraged
[48:43.590 --> 48:47.710]  it once I started doing it because I don't like fucking typing man and if she
[48:47.710 --> 48:52.350]  saw that I was sitting in front of a computer typing with you guys and
[48:52.350 --> 48:56.870]  laughing and having a good time and getting stoned and it's like she I don't
[48:56.870 --> 49:02.790]  I don't do stuff like that very often so she loves me and she encouraged it so
[49:03.350 --> 49:08.830]  so now you have me on here talking to you so if you don't like that blame the
[49:08.830 --> 49:16.110]  old lady not me so and Pete Pete's giving me a platform but uh yeah it's
[49:16.110 --> 49:24.510]  the it's really yes that was some of the best advice that I got growing up man is
[49:24.510 --> 49:29.430]  use your time wisely because somebody said work smart not hard yeah absolutely
[49:29.430 --> 49:34.790]  right is work smart not hard and even that's what these plants do that's what
[49:34.790 --> 49:39.910]  garden plants do it you really notice it when you start looking at nature and how
[49:39.910 --> 49:46.110]  it operates is it like I said calories and whatever that the system that the
[49:46.110 --> 49:55.950]  the living thing is working on is you know is there they're conscious of the
[49:55.950 --> 50:01.230]  limit the limitations of it it's like you think about like the the animals out
[50:01.230 --> 50:07.710]  there that have to hunt all of the time like a meat-eating like just say a feral
[50:07.710 --> 50:15.910]  cat like a feral cat out there surviving is they are always thinking in a like
[50:15.910 --> 50:21.750]  very like analytical way like even in like the path that they're taking to get
[50:21.750 --> 50:27.070]  somewhere because the the least energy that they're taking that they're going
[50:27.070 --> 50:31.830]  to use to get through that area that means that that's less energy that they
[50:31.830 --> 50:37.190]  have to use hunting later on down or no I'm sorry that's energy that they have
[50:37.190 --> 50:43.550]  later on down the line to do the hunting to get more energy so that they can be
[50:43.550 --> 50:49.470]  efficient about walking the straightest path possible yeah I'm getting off into
[50:49.470 --> 50:53.510]  something weird right here but I think you guys know what I'm talking about is
[50:53.510 --> 51:00.150]  that everything on earth is efficient with what it what it spends its energy
[51:00.150 --> 51:04.510]  on and I don't know how many times I can say the same fucking thing I'm sorry
[51:04.510 --> 51:11.870]  smoke some more right stoner so yeah cannabis plants I really think that
[51:11.950 --> 51:24.550]  these ones are the the the more efficient of all of them yeah I'm happy
[51:24.550 --> 51:31.750]  you're here to st. Bernard I'm always happy to see see you pop up my man cool
[51:31.750 --> 51:40.870]  cat is the people in the chat rooms and the on these shows are very well
[51:40.870 --> 51:48.590]  informed people it's and it's nice that they spend their time sharing what they
[51:48.590 --> 51:55.510]  have learned over their time and what they're into and and all of that is it
[51:55.510 --> 52:00.150]  yeah that's that's really what it's all about it's the only way things are gonna
[52:00.150 --> 52:06.230]  move forward I think is if the people are open with their information and you
[52:06.230 --> 52:16.430]  know it's I don't know it's yeah yeah Chad yeah y'all special people y'all
[52:16.430 --> 52:26.830]  very special people the art of me anyway so that's the so I smoke a little bit
[52:26.830 --> 52:31.790]  more and I can talk about these long flowering plants is it do you all have
[52:31.790 --> 52:38.190]  is there any like I'd like to hear some people out here that have experience
[52:38.190 --> 52:44.510]  with these long flowering plants share what you know on here I'll highlight it
[52:44.510 --> 52:49.630]  as you know there's a my limitation is I've only grown these these things in
[52:49.630 --> 52:58.510]  one place here I've only grown these in one place so I'm limited to that as I'd
[52:58.510 --> 53:03.590]  like to know like what what's the certain specific complications that
[53:03.590 --> 53:08.710]  other people have out there that that have experience with these crazy-ass
[53:08.710 --> 53:16.990]  plants man is yeah what kind of what kind of shit do you
[53:17.310 --> 53:26.190]  deal with you know I only have like I said I only have my experience and we're
[53:26.190 --> 53:34.030]  all limited to that so do I know it I do not I've seen a lot of here we I'm
[53:34.030 --> 53:37.630]  sorry I'm so sorry I shouldn't be answering questions that I'm not
[53:37.630 --> 53:45.750]  highlighting let's use some of Peters trick trickery right here so there's
[53:45.750 --> 53:51.150]  that I do not I was trying to remember this name the other day when I was
[53:51.150 --> 53:56.350]  talking about those pearly plants I have a lot of experience with that form
[53:56.350 --> 54:02.230]  that morphology of haze that's what I have experience with that's it's what we
[54:02.230 --> 54:09.030]  have back here that is just a that big Cola is just a bunch of that it's all it
[54:09.030 --> 54:14.830]  is I look on my Instagram and it's that pearly that's it's just a little bitty
[54:14.830 --> 54:19.590]  flower off of that that plant right there I didn't want to waste any of it
[54:19.630 --> 54:25.350]  so anyway and I'm not gonna waste any more of it so that picture is all you're
[54:25.350 --> 54:33.870]  getting so yeah the the dr. green spoon I do not have any experience with that
[54:33.870 --> 54:39.670]  but I do have experience with that type of plant is I call it string of pearls
[54:39.670 --> 54:44.070]  because that's what it was told to me that's what they called it when I first
[54:44.070 --> 54:49.550]  came across as those older fellows as they said yes that's the we call that a
[54:49.550 --> 54:54.590]  string of pearls and if it's not frosty you can't call it string of pearls do
[54:54.590 --> 55:00.870]  you feel me anyway there are some that pop up and they're not as front but they
[55:00.870 --> 55:04.470]  could have it even though they're not as frosty like that they still could have
[55:04.470 --> 55:09.950]  that effect it you know don't don't be fooled but not everything that comes out
[55:09.950 --> 55:15.870]  looks like fucking cookies everybody you know not everything is the more
[55:15.870 --> 55:19.870]  often than not some of the I've found that some of the it's not the best
[55:19.870 --> 55:27.670]  looking stuff even frost wise but it it checks the boxes it tastes good and it
[55:27.670 --> 55:31.190]  gets you high and that's that's why I smoke weed I don't know why the hell you
[55:31.190 --> 55:38.350]  smoke weed but I smoke it for that that purpose so you know and in my situation
[55:38.350 --> 55:47.670]  you don't want to waste your time on bunk you know why why expend capital and
[55:47.670 --> 55:53.190]  risk on bunk that doesn't that don't make sense so I try to steer away from
[55:53.190 --> 55:58.110]  it as much as possible and with hey I did it right that time with stuff like
[55:58.110 --> 56:05.910]  this you are not everything's gonna be great some stuff I was at the beginning
[56:05.910 --> 56:10.350]  of this I shouted out the ladies is that was inspired by my wife is because
[56:10.350 --> 56:16.550]  she has like nursed my ass out on the back porch like bent over like trying to
[56:16.550 --> 56:22.190]  catch my breath from like a panic attack from testing plants like this like I've
[56:22.190 --> 56:29.430]  pissed people off in the past by not giving them seeds because I same with
[56:29.430 --> 56:37.270]  weed like but there's certain people that I will not smoke this stuff with or
[56:37.270 --> 56:44.950]  give this stuff to and I'm not gonna get in this is my personal thing okay and
[56:44.950 --> 56:50.110]  I'm not gonna get into the specifics on that but there is I've pissed people off
[56:50.110 --> 56:55.630]  by me being this way and I to me I have to be this way because of what I just
[56:55.630 --> 57:00.950]  described to you is I don't want to do that to somebody that's not expecting it
[57:00.950 --> 57:10.110]  so yeah my wife is like nursed me out of like weed hell on the back porch yeah is
[57:10.110 --> 57:17.710]  the no doubt is when when I was doing the the old-timer show that's what I
[57:17.710 --> 57:21.910]  meant when I was talking about Russian roulette these plants are like when
[57:21.910 --> 57:25.870]  you're testing plants like this out you it's like playing Russian roulette it
[57:25.870 --> 57:35.350]  really is you don't know what you're getting you really don't so yeah yeah
[57:35.350 --> 57:38.870]  I've pissed some guys some guys off there was somebody up in Massachusetts
[57:38.870 --> 57:42.350]  when at the last trade show that I went to was the Harvest Cup up in
[57:42.350 --> 57:47.070]  Massachusetts and there was this really cool guy there and he was the the only
[57:47.310 --> 57:52.350]  one of the only people that like offered to smoke with me you know we were outside
[57:52.350 --> 58:00.920]  and he like passed me his bowl as like that but he had told me some things
[58:00.920 --> 58:05.880]  about himself like while we were smoking that bowl and everything that like he
[58:05.880 --> 58:11.120]  told me that I couldn't I couldn't give him any of the seeds that I was there to
[58:11.120 --> 58:19.600]  give away yeah so I'm really not I don't want to be too cryptic here so I'm
[58:19.600 --> 58:22.820]  gonna get off of this subject because I'm not gonna tell you all what what my
[58:22.820 --> 58:27.200]  parameters are because everybody everybody makes their own choices I'm
[58:27.200 --> 58:31.160]  not here to tell you what choices to make that's another reason why I wasn't
[58:31.160 --> 58:35.480]  getting into the here I go again this is a why I wasn't getting into the
[58:35.480 --> 58:39.440]  specifics on the strains and everything because to me that really doesn't
[58:39.440 --> 58:45.000]  fucking matter it really doesn't the because once you get into it what the
[58:45.000 --> 58:51.000]  fuck's the name you know that's that's how I look at it the names only matter
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.180]  when you're shopping past that I don't see what and keeping things straight
[58:59.180 --> 59:03.740]  down the line like a name is a name for a reason so don't go fucking changing
[59:03.740 --> 59:08.180]  names that's why I I got myself in trouble for putting out that dream time
[59:08.300 --> 59:15.580]  haze because people took they got the wrong idea and I get it I really I
[59:15.580 --> 59:27.380]  understand and Scott has a very loyal customer base for a fucking reason and I
[59:27.380 --> 59:32.980]  get that and I respect that so when I was confronted with that situation I was
[59:32.980 --> 59:42.140]  yeah yeah I respected those people so yeah as the but don't change names
[59:42.140 --> 59:48.020]  there's a reason why by people neither don't go to it just creates more there's
[59:48.020 --> 59:52.500]  enough confusion in cannabis already without your dumbass coming along and
[59:52.500 --> 59:59.180]  changing the fucking names on stuff and then well it and like if it's just
[59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.220]  yours at home and you want to like give it some fucking crazy ass name that
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:05.260]  that's one thing but if you're like putting it out there don't give it your
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:10.420]  like home crazy name unless you've like made it your own in some way if you've
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:15.540]  like done something like selected and then it's not the original thing anymore
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:19.940]  and then the breeder doesn't want you to use that name you got it there's kind of
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:27.460]  a I don't know I'm not here to I shouldn't be saying any of this stuff
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:38.020]  really because it's not my place to like talk about cannabis ethics and yeah
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:44.660]  man coffee yeah yeah I can't I'm not gonna put that up here but yes
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:54.660]  absolutely thank you yes don't do that don't do that okay yeah I love this
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:01.500]  crowd so yeah I think that that's enough of that rant I'm not I'm in no
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:08.580]  position to be talking about seed ethics and all of that but it as a customer
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.260]  like I think that I do have a place to talk because I've spent a shit ton of
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:18.220]  money on seeds over the years and I've if you notice I only talk about the the
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:24.220]  the people that I've gotten good stuff from I don't give attention to the like
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:31.860]  like what what just happened there I've gotten stuff from seed banks that I yeah
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:38.380]  I've not been happy with but I don't go out there and put them on blast and shit
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:46.500]  that's not that doesn't do anybody any good you know so yeah but I will tell
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.860]  people about the good experience that I've had and the people that are that I
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:57.620]  think are top not top-notch and yeah absolutely I if I've had a good
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:05.180]  experience with someone or if just the right people are into this person and
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:10.380]  there's got enough good feedback from them and they're good enough for me I
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:14.780]  don't I don't need to pop their shit and find out that people that I trust
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:20.660]  have gone through it and they they dig it I imagine I'd dig it too I'd find
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.980]  something that I like in there so there's a there's a lot of guys like
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:29.220]  that and shit Peters picking a lot of them up lately it's it's really cool
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:35.860]  he's he's getting some picking up some goats he's gotten a lot of them lately
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.100]  and he said that he's got some more waiting waiting on deck for y'all so
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:49.500]  yeah man it's a him and JB James being he's got some goats too so yeah it's
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:57.620]  I've been looking around at some of like the other parts of the the cannabis
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.820]  community lately since Peters kind of like kind of pulled me into this a
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.700]  little bit deeper I've been looking around at what's popping up in my little
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.380]  side feed over there other cannabis content and I'm seeing like some of
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.020]  these numbers next to these videos and stuff so I like check them out and see
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:18.940]  what they're talking about and it's it's interesting to say the least it really
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:28.020]  is it's like we I'm very happy where I am I yeah it's it's nice to be on a
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:33.820]  video that might get a few hundred views to a thousand views instead of what
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.900]  what some of these people out there with hundreds of thousands to a million and
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:48.580]  they're like talking about dispensary buds yeah yeah I'm glad I'm glad I'm I'm
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.500]  part of this crowd for sure so anyway I'll get off of that I'm not trying to
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.780]  talk bad about other people is that they they have their own thing and you know
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:02.740]  right now dispensary weed has its purpose not everybody can grow not
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:08.420]  everybody is able to grow like they're there they got landlords that will make
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:20.960]  them homeless if they do if they if they okay I should just stop I shouldn't
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.840]  be I'm here to talk about long flowering sativas not dispensary bud so you're not
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.640]  gonna find a good long flowering sativa in a dispensary I don't imagine so yeah
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.800]  let's just leave that subject alone so I'm gonna sit here and get high and read
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:48.720]  the read the comments and see if anybody yeah I think that the crowd on
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:54.080]  these shows are one of the most important things to these shows so I was
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.440]  really wanting to incorporate this one so I'm really gonna try to shut up as
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:06.160]  much as possible now and like see what you guys are talking about and like it's
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:14.960]  I really want to hear you your guys opinion on these these long flowering
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.640]  plants and what you've run into with them or if you've got questions on on
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:24.760]  these things so I'll try to help if I can you know I've only seen so much I've
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.400]  seen a lot of these I will say that I I've been in love with these plants ever
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:36.960]  since I was a kid so I've and I've been growing a lot since then so I've seen a
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:42.280]  lot of these things so I'm not I'm in no way an authority on the subject but I I
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:47.080]  know a lot about the morphology and all of the the weird little quirks and
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.000]  problems and stuff and that's why I went through this this list and I really hope
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.600]  that it saves somebody some fucking headaches whether they got some of this
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.880]  stuff that I put out here or not and I can talk about some of the stuff that I
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:07.320]  put out there the second run like I usually give very like almost too much
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.520]  of a description like where it's kind of detrimental I've kind of found a Buddha
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:18.660]  boy can attest to this I tried to give the best description possible but on the
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.840]  second run that I gave Peter I was really busy it was the middle of the
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:29.680]  summer he asked me a question and it prompted me to go through my catalog my
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:38.720]  little office Word or Excel spreadsheet thing and go through and look at what I
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:44.680]  have stashed away that I had seen enough of that was like the hazes that I first
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.680]  put out so if you had if you got the second run of the stuff that I put out
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:59.760]  that was it was called bobcat spray and coyote coyote scat and those names like
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.480]  had they yes you can find cat piss and dog shit in those plants that's that's
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.200]  part of the reason why I named them that but also named them that because they're
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:14.240]  kind of wild is you're gonna end up something pretty cool in there like this
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.920]  more often than not because I crossed it with my my male line and he kind of
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.480]  just like hangs out in the back and doesn't really do too much so it's
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.560]  really it's yeah I thought that that would be a nice one and I'd seen enough
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.720]  of those to where I knew what people were gonna be getting out there and I
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.320]  will say that the the bobcat spray may have more of a tendency to harm on you
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.120]  than the inside most most definitely have more of a tendency to harm on you
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:50.160]  than the then the the dog shit cross does is the the dog shit cross was
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.800]  coyote scat and it was a dog shit haze plant that was an L haze and then the
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.600]  the bobcat spray was an original haze skunk one that was a string of pearls
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:08.360]  cat piss like this thing behind me so as what I was selecting for out of those
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360]  seeds on this this little head stash that I got going behind me here is that
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:17.760]  string of pearls structure with cat piss and the the nice long high and the
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.360]  kind of sweet taste and all of that because uh sometimes the cat piss comes
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.320]  through in the taste too I've never like drink cat piss but you know the smell
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.080]  and the taste are sort of the the taste of the weed is like the smell of cat
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.860]  piss you know yeah I don't drink cat piss so I'd anybody please in the
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:44.740]  comments if you have tasted actual cat piss do tell but I'm usually the cat
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:48.580]  pissy plants they smell cat pissy but they're like a wonderful sweet taste
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:54.780]  like a like skunk one sweet it's like it's it's all it's almost amazing and I
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.100]  think that these people that like these these cat piss plants were kept around
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:04.940]  on purpose is uh because they were getting busted for the skunk and nobody
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.260]  wants to come to your trailer and like the middle-of-nowhere Cali if like they
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:15.220]  can smell like cat piss from a hundred feet away they're gonna like stay like
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.540]  way back away from your house and not want to go in and see what's going on in
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:23.060]  there because they think you got a shit ton of cats in there and they're gonna
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.740]  go away smelling like that shit so I really think that there was some clever
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:34.140]  hippies along the way out in Cali that were going for that fucking that cat
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:40.820]  piss kind of kind of stink to you know skunk was getting everybody locked up so
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:46.900]  they had to like go for something else and hell I don't know it's just a theory
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:51.620]  who knows what happened but the cat piss cat piss is very prominent in these
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:57.340]  longer flowering plants so all right now I actually will shut up and start going
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:04.380]  through the comments I did see that Chad said some things so anyway cat lady
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:10.260]  turps yeah man but like I said it's not really they taste sweet for the most
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:19.500]  like some of them do have that kind of ammonia flavor too yeah it's a it's
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:27.860]  amazing it really it's I love that sweet sativa weed is said there's a that
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:33.180]  silly name that I have right here the haze hound I put that on there you know
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:40.260]  I named myself after a dog that's my fake name so and and I like I do like
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:47.580]  have a like I when I smell some haze burning man I gravitate that direction
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:58.020]  I smell that sweetness from from a little while away you know so yeah yeah
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:16.700]  anyway beaver tank turp all right so I'm gonna go up here a little bit and then
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:20.380]  go back down and see what y'all are talking about
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:27.060]  Jay fellow pushes cat piss never heard of Jay fellow I know that that I don't
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:38.340]  think the the cat piss that loud and 707 are into I think that's something that's
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:44.780]  not you know this is an ammonia plant the people that are into that Cali cat
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:49.260]  piss stuff that's not like a haze derivative because the stuff that 707
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:53.860]  has doesn't look like a haze to me it's I've seen a few pictures of people
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:59.220]  growing his his cat piss out and that's a that stuff looks interesting for sure
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.700]  I'd like to try that shit I've never seen one of those tighter indica type
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:08.540]  plants that expresses that that cat pissiness so that's that's really cool
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:13.420]  to me as a 707 seems like he's got that that real deal the guy that done Dunn's
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:20.700]  friend I can never remember his name the the he was part of the cat piss fight
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:26.140]  too but it's it they people love his cat piss too he's got the I think it's
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:31.260]  kosher kitty or something it's yeah that's that these ammonia plants are
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:38.780]  that there's there's a reason this guy is like the people that have seen a lot
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:44.140]  of plants you you go through a lot of seeds and you you see a lot of things
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:51.060]  there's certain stuff that like stands out not only flavor but effect wise and
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:57.460]  they sometimes like the I don't want to be too general here but a lot of times
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.820]  they kind of line up it's like it's consistent it's like you get something
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.900]  pissy a lot of times it's gonna be good and apparently it's whether it's one of
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:12.860]  these hazy pissy ones or one of the something from 707 or loud not well I
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.100]  guess the loud is looking for the cat piss but you know you know what I'm
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:21.100]  saying or the kosher kitty that old dudes got so he grows beautiful plants
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:24.700]  out there no doubt he's out on the islands and he's yeah he's doing his
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:30.140]  thing so anyway I've never smoked any of their their pissy stuff I've got enough
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.420]  of my own pissy stuff that I enjoy so I said it's really cool if I ever you know
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:46.660]  have the opportunity I would like to try that 707 stuff so anyway so let's see
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.660]  here we go now this is what yeah this kind of stuff is what I was talking
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:14:02.140]  about Claude Gosling I don't know about the Sinai or the Ethiopian but what I
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.780]  have found is that it's beneficial especially if you're growing this shit
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:10.620]  outside and most of the places where a lot of us live is you want something
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.860]  that triggers as early as possible it's that that's that's a trait that you're
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:24.500]  looking for when my uncle was acclimatizing that NL NL Hayes he he
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:28.660]  told me he didn't tell me much but what he told me about the boy when I when he
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:36.420]  gave me those seeds what he told me is that he picked the females that triggered
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:44.220]  that flowered the fastest and the males that started flowering the last like
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.620]  anything any male that flowered real early came down like that was his the he
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.060]  tried to stay out of the field obviously you try to stay out of the field as much
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:58.140]  as possible so he said that he made three trips in in a season the first
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:03.740]  trip in was early flowering time of year and that's when he was going around
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:11.300]  and inspecting everything and he got rid of any female that wasn't starting to
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:19.180]  show pistols and any male that was showing balls so he went through and
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:25.060]  called all of that shit that that was not his desires and he just selected for
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:34.020]  that over time so and that's about all you can do I haven't found any better
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:42.220]  technique so yeah so that's what he he said he did and there's a guy on the
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:48.260]  Guerrero grows and he said that he he did something similar but the plants
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:52.260]  kind of did it naturally on their own for him and I imagine they did so from
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:56.940]  my uncle too after a few seasons so anyway he didn't give me a whole lot of
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:16:02.180]  information he was pretty sick at the time and yeah is that I only ended up
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:09.060]  with him because his son like married a Christian lady and like he he his son
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:13.980]  was basically the reason why my uncle had to stop growing pot because he he
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.860]  made shit hot on my uncle basically he
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:26.220]  you can't have a contracting business and not build anything you dig yeah it
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:33.740]  brings down heat so yeah so anyway so I ended up with the High Times collection
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:44.900]  and the the seeds for several reasons but anyway yeah it's a so as that's my
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:49.220]  best answer to that is that that's I don't know anything about those
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:53.300]  specific land races that you're talking about but as far as that subject goes
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.020]  that's the that's the best answer that I could have on that one so let's see what
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:13.340]  else we got here I'm sorry for the the dead air folks
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:34.020]  okay here's a yes they the the tricot tricones a tricone is you know you
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:38.940]  inspect the the tricones the hairs are gonna tell you like if you see on that
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:44.580]  damn it I keep doing it you see on that Instagram pic that I keep referencing is
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:48.340]  that this stuff has still got a lot of white hairs on it but it's got a lot of
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.220]  tricones but those tricones are still very clear right now there's they're not
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:59.140]  even close to done there's I haven't found any cloudy ones yet as there is a
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:03.180]  one part of the plant they got a little close to the light once and those are
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:10.980]  those are gone but anyway yeah it's the you look at the same things that you do
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.820]  on the other ones it's there's no difference there it's still still a
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:17.820]  cannabis plant and it's it tells you when it's done there it's tricones or
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:22.580]  when you like it you know it's like that's a whole other subject to is when
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:26.540]  when to pull it everybody's got their own thing if you if you want it to knock
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:43.130]  you out you pull it red here we have here that's cool I have no idea what
[01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:51.050]  this is but that was awesome and I think I accidentally do that yeah you popped
[01:18:51.050 --> 01:19:02.850]  up a picture of some lady with a beautiful plant all right so yeah I have
[01:19:02.850 --> 01:19:09.540]  no idea what was going on there so
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:23.810]  he's I'm digging I'm digging where you all are thinking with this yes if you if
[01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:32.410]  you can get them to finish in time like I would do that inside like it would be
[01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:36.530]  nice it'd be nice if you could do it outdoors if you have the climate for it
[01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:44.610]  but it's a guarantee your success is I guess what I'm trying to say but the yes
[01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:49.290]  is open pollinate something like this because that's that then you can really
[01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:55.850]  see what's available in that gene pool and what it is in that gene pool that
[01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:59.170]  you like if anything there may not be anything in there that you like and then
[01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:09.270]  you knew that you you know it's a it's it's nice to it's nice to get a broader
[01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:13.790]  a broader look at it and I know that a lot of people that have seed companies
[01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:17.070]  and stuff they don't like a guy like me out here telling people to do this shit
[01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:25.190]  but it's I mean if you're selling regular seeds you know but I think that
[01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:29.430]  this is a this is a method that has worked for me and I recommend it to
[01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:33.190]  other people and you know it may not always work out for you but it's it's
[01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:37.190]  it's been a method that has worked out for me and it seems to have worked out
[01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:42.790]  for other people throughout time too I'm not going to name names but this is what
[01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:47.830]  you what you were saying there is how you preserve things whether it be at
[01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:53.630]  cannabis or vegetables or anything it doesn't this is how preservation happens
[01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:59.950]  so and and the only way that you can do that is open blows to where you're not
[01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:05.950]  bottlenecking and getting rid of things that you're trying to hold on to because
[01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:10.590]  in that 10-pack you might find the winner you know if the breeder is
[01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:15.670]  actually done done their work their their work the what's the if they've
[01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:20.710]  actually earned the hard the hard-earned cash that you're spending on these magic
[01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:29.310]  beans that cost $10 a piece or more in some cases is yeah that's why I said
[01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:33.830]  earlier about the wasting people's time thing it's like you some of the price is
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:38.590]  being charged you it's it you don't want to waste people's money and you don't
[01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:43.310]  want to waste people's time time is more valuable than money to me but still
[01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:48.750]  that you know is that some of these beans are expensive as I mentioned this
[01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:52.270]  earlier too it's like some of these first-time growers out there amassing
[01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:56.990]  like an epic seed collection in their first year and they're like they're
[01:21:56.990 --> 01:22:01.990]  ready to go they they have some of the best stuff on earth and it's like it's
[01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:07.230]  it's really cool that they're able to do that because it took me years to figure
[01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:15.110]  out like who were the quality let's let's be diplomatic here the quality
[01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:21.310]  entities within the cannabis seed game the ones that actually have the the
[01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:28.510]  parents and put out stuff that's not gonna waste your fucking time so yeah I
[01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:35.910]  only talk about the companies that have not wasted my time so and that's yeah
[01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:41.550]  and I've gotten over the years to where I'm pretty picky about popping shit like
[01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:46.470]  this fall I'm planning on popping a bunch of stuff that I've gotten from the
[01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:52.950]  chat people and everything is that I really enjoy the idea of growing some of
[01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:57.550]  these things from other people it's like I've got some peppers from JD hog leg
[01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:04.990]  that I'm really excited about this year too and said yeah it's cool it's this
[01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:09.150]  community it's and I know people get weird it's like whether you should call
[01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:13.710]  it a community or not to me to me it feels like a community at the part of it
[01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:18.070]  that I'm in feels like a community to me so really that's all that matters to me
[01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:28.390]  so yeah you've got some really good stuff popping up here the Druids do rock
[01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:43.220]  Buddha boy yeah they shamrock don't they oh man that's a I don't want to
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.740]  answer that question that's that's not really for me to say when you're
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:52.540]  comfortable when you feel like you can read a plant when you're not gonna fuck
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:59.340]  up when you when you feel confident that you can that's you you you're gonna be
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:04.940]  successful because these things throw a lot of curveballs at you and especially
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:13.300]  if you're feeding it like if you're used to feeding plants it's really hard for
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.780]  you to not do that once you get used to it
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:23.900]  maybe maybe I'm over generalizing here but it seems like a lot of people like
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.260]  it's hard to pull back once you're used to it's like you always want to give it
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.620]  a little something but with these plants it's like you'll cut you do that
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:36.580]  and you'll come back the next like next day not even maybe in a couple hours
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.740]  later and that motherfuckers melted you you just melted something that you've
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:51.220]  been growing for two three months now already so just because you think that
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:56.020]  it's not gonna have enough gas to get to the end just let it eat itself don't
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:03.420]  don't do it don't do it so as far as like how many runs I can't that's not
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:33.120]  for me to say that's for each individual to find out on their own that that kind
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:40.080]  of that kind of makes sense to me I dig that see that's that's what I was asking
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.640]  for is a little little tips like that if you're wanting to tighten it up a little
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.440]  bit if you're concerned about I don't mind that that loose fluffy bud as
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:57.900]  especially outside it's a it's a blessing actually so yeah but I dig that
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:02.660]  this is another good tip sir dirties full of some good tips as he's one of
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.500]  the people on here that is he seems to have a lot of experience in several
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:15.060]  places and he he seems to show share a lot of quality information in these chat
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:19.700]  rooms so it's and it always seems like he's coming from a place of experience
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:26.420]  not hearsay so yeah I appreciate your input dirty your dirty input man is
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:44.990]  dirty defoliation several people talking about defoliation here is Chad talking
[01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:51.390]  about defoliating to I like to let plants defoliate themselves it kind of
[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:56.830]  unless you need to air them out you know it's these things a lot of these things
[01:26:56.830 --> 01:27:07.070]  see if I ha these types of plants they are a lot of them are pretty leafy it's
[01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:13.750]  there's it's the there's some with a little more calyx than leaf like this
[01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:18.010]  one it's gonna end up that way it's gonna have more calyx than leaf but the
[01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:23.030]  leaf is gonna be all mixed in there like it because of the way that these strings
[01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:28.510]  of pearls work and it's just a huge bud of those strings of pearls so it's just
[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:35.150]  like it yeah those leaves are getting all tangled up in the other strings of
[01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:39.070]  pearls so you gotta like separate everything as I've developed I guess I
[01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:44.910]  can talk about this is going through the the plant like this one specifically
[01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:48.990]  behind me and going through and trimming it is the way that I've found best is
[01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:53.790]  because I hate manhandling my weed so I like that's one of the reasons why I
[01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:58.070]  like growing it in this type of structure is because I just I can just
[01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:03.750]  hold that stalk and like get the scissors in behind and like snip off
[01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:09.110]  each little like main stem of that string of pearls but because they're
[01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:12.990]  kind of a little bit more dense down at the bottom and then they like kind of
[01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:18.950]  air out and it's I guess you could call it a foxtail is I mean but it's it's
[01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:22.550]  a string of pearls it's it's different than a foxtail it's a little it's loose
[01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:29.910]  it's a loose foxtail it's like a squirrel tail just being silly but uh
[01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:35.470]  yeah that's my advice on these type of plants is it's not best to like keep it
[01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:41.930]  in that form when you're messing with it it's best to like bust it up into into
[01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:47.950]  smaller pieces and like I said don't manhandle it too much and and maybe
[01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:52.990]  instead of like hang drying it like you normally would it works best with these
[01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:57.430]  to do it like that and then like have it on a screen like up in the air it's like
[01:28:57.430 --> 01:29:02.110]  air moving around it and then into the paper bag and whatever your method is
[01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:04.910]  from there I'm not here to tell you how to cure your weed because I don't live
[01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:14.550]  where you do so yeah back over to the to the chat Chad over here just a spritz I
[01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:20.190]  guess that was a cat piss when I was asking if anybody has drink cat piss
[01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:26.010]  Chad apparently he's had just a spritz he said and and you know he's into the
[01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:38.750]  unicorn p2 so he knows his sources of I guess artisan urine like this some of
[01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:46.390]  the best of the best so yeah it's mink pee and stuff like that yeah Chad's a
[01:29:46.390 --> 01:30:05.700]  Chad's a connoisseur of that area I hear what else we got cat lady turds yeah
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:37.050]  great name cat lady's trailer but see here can of us driver see here's
[01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:43.610]  somebody else they found cat piss and the original AK that's that's fascinating
[01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:49.530]  to me that really is that I find that very interesting that it popped out of
[01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:56.490]  that because of what the parents of a K that's that's interesting but yeah this
[01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:06.650]  is maybe it's a skunk thing my original Hayes skunk one is the where the piss
[01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:12.730]  comes out most often I've found piss in the NL Hayes too but a little it's it's
[01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:23.540]  much more rare than it than it pops out of the original Hayes I got I got some
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:36.060]  private chats over here too okay thank you Peter all right so this is a this is
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.740]  a question from from rad Chad any tips on dealing with the height other than
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:51.540]  flowering early there's there's always just topping it and keep topping it and
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:59.820]  pinching pinching is that's helpful people have a lot of names for this but
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:04.700]  it only goes so far same with topping and topping fucks with your morphology a
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:09.380]  whole lot too it's like some plants they don't they don't give you the primo if
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:17.060]  you top them so I try to stay away from that if you can but just until you get
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:20.540]  to know it once you get to know it and you find out that you can top it and it
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:29.220]  still gives you the goods then rock on but I think that the my best answer for
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:36.820]  that is the pinch and don't pinch too late like you really can't pinch too
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:40.740]  early and you can pinch as much as you like pinch pinch pinch as much as you
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:45.100]  want get it all kinked up and looking like you stepped on it or something but
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:51.100]  that doesn't matter as much as pinching too late because if you pinch too late
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:57.860]  it there's like and what's too late let your plant tell you that because I can't
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.260]  but what happens is I will tell you what happens when you pinch too late is that
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:07.620]  it doesn't strengthen up and create the knuckle that it does if you pinch it
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:12.540]  early if you pinch it early and up to a certain point within flowering and each
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:18.180]  plant is different with this so you got to find out on your own and but point is
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:22.140]  is you can pinch as much as you want to a point and then once it's to that point
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.100]  when you pinch it it won't like strengthen up it actually weakens it and
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.860]  now you've got like this floppy thing that's gonna break off in the wind and
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:35.860]  it's just what I do if I find that out is I just snip that off and I quit
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:41.020]  pinching say okay that you're done I can't do anymore trying to hold you back
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:46.220]  so there that's the that's my best answer for that if other people have
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:50.700]  tips for because that's a very good question because height issues is a
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:56.540]  major thing for a lot of people and as growing this stuff indoors is a headache
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:34:00.820]  enough as it is and any any little things like that that can help you out
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:05.540]  is yeah that's what we're here for today so I don't have to type it a bunch of
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:12.260]  times right so alright so let's go back down through these I'm assuming that's
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.380]  when Peter popped in earlier was to get that question to me because I apparently
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:32.290]  missed that earlier with the chat asking that so pissyweed is common here
[01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:38.010]  wherever high temp garden is and people that are chasing the piss go see high
[01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:56.820]  temp catfish and pineapple Express huh Buddha boys had the AK cat piss too oh
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:02.300]  that's that's cool I love the little like tidbits that I
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:08.700]  learned going that I really enjoy hanging out with you guys it's it's a
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:13.140]  lot of fun getting everybody's perspective from all over the country
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:36.820]  and world it's it's it's it's awesome sorry I'm trying to not miss anything
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:44.740]  that's don't want to ignore people over here I'm thinking it's on my personal
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:49.020]  when I'm look when we're doing these shows I'm not looking at the you it is
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:55.220]  the YouTube chat but it's a reproduction of it so I've noticed that I don't get
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.820]  even if I'm on live chat there's people and things that I don't see being said
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:06.820]  on there so I don't know if that happens on these chats too I doubt it but who
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:11.020]  knows I don't know what's going on there but like I said I'm on live chat and I'm
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.420]  there's people that are being talked to that I don't even see sometimes and then
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.580]  there's like conversations going on and I don't even know what the hell they're
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:27.840]  talking about because I don't see the people so that's interesting yes it goes
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:36.600]  through dirty yeah absolutely man shut these this is like when I first started
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.680]  like interacting in the chats it was in this chat room and on Adam Dunn show as
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.640]  he yeah sir dirties right he was one of the one of the first to really go at
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.120]  this hard and be consistent about it and you could know that on Friday at his
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:59.160]  time 420 ish most of the time it's you're gonna get a show even even back
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.080]  in the old days when the audio quality was bad and everything is still a great
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.220]  show a lot of a lot of information and it's gone through stages through the
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:12.000]  years and a lot of us just stuck around and some have come and gone and come
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  back and yeah it's a those guys need their props they they they're there
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.320]  every Friday for us and I'm appreciative so it's actually I've never
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:33.640]  popped any of his seeds but I have I've spent more on Adam Dunn's on TH seeds
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:38.000]  than any other company that I've bought but I haven't popped any of them I just
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.320]  bought like all of the chocolate chunk regulars that JB had left because I
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:47.800]  didn't think that they were ever coming back and I was right because now it says
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.720]  they're discontinued so anyway but I've yeah I got like $300 worth of Dunn's
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.920]  beans that I don't even know if I ever will pop them because I've already found
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.640]  the indica that I'm I'm into so I don't know if I really need the chocolate
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.960]  chunk now if I do it's probably just gonna be to pop and go through them and
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.560]  see what's what you know as I was gonna use it as like a because it's it's
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.560]  really hard what was so cool about those is it's hard to find pure indica's
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:20.040]  anymore and that's what that is is that people think it's Afghan one Dunn knows
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.600]  what it is but whatever it is the stuff that I had that was chocolate chunk in
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:30.000]  the past was we made fun of it and called it chocolate chalk because it was
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.880]  like chalky Afghan one type of weed and that's why I got a bunch of it because I
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.040]  wanted to go through and like actually like make a see if there was something
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:44.880]  besides chocolate chalk to be found in the chocolate chunk so anyway that's
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.880]  got off on a little tangent there but yeah sir dirty shouting out Adam Dunn
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:55.480]  and Adam Dunn show that's another cool thing about Peter is Peter has never
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:00.400]  said anything to me about like talking about other podcasts or like talking
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:07.380]  about other distributors or any of that is he lets us talk about whatever the
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:12.460]  fuck we want on here and I appreciate it like yesterday if y'all watching the
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:17.460]  Guerrero Gros shows they had like DMT Rick's it shit like not going but they
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:22.100]  were you know showing off like that kind of thing so yeah that was interesting
[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:26.780]  but yeah Peter he lets us talk about whatever the hell we want and that's
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:38.100]  that's awesome oh here we go st. Bernard he getting into the specifics I hear you
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:44.100]  and he's been around I think that he was one of the names that I was reading
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.860]  in the if I'm not mistaken I'm thinking that I was reading st. Bernard in the
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:53.260]  chat before I was in there chatting because I didn't start chatting like
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:58.260]  what got me in there actually like talking about stuff was when riot found
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.420]  out about what Phylos was doing out there that was like that that pissed me
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:06.380]  off that it was the last straw I've been watching all of this stuff going on and
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:10.780]  then I found out about that and it just like it set a fire in me to where I
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:20.620]  wanted to get out there and talk talk a little shit that's yeah anyway so anyway
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:28.180]  thanks thanks Matt everybody's got their own opinions on it on riot too but I you
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:35.980]  know I was a punk rocker back in the day as I kind of get the attitude as I
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:40.460]  feel like I I've never met Matt probably never will but I feel like I
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:45.020]  kind of understand Matt and his guard dog kind of mentality it's kind of why I
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:53.140]  named myself after a guard dog so I get it so as him and Trevor really called
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:41:00.420]  out some some fuckery on all that and good on them for doing it another rant
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:05.860]  as I'm going on and on here I'm gonna probably hop off here soon see what y'all
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:25.100]  talking about and not seeing a lot people are going through pot cast
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:31.420]  history it looks like over here I can't wait to go through back here and in the
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:35.980]  chat and read all that I don't have time to go through that argument right now
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:43.100]  but yeah Chad have a consistent well hey every Friday is what I meant by
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:47.460]  consistent is pretty much every Friday or if they can't do it on Friday like
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:53.700]  once a week and yeah yeah that's that's for for some fucking weed smokers that's
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:58.180]  pretty goddamn good man I respected that about dude grows at first tears like God
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:05.020]  they were on there every day doing their wake and bake show and yeah I was into
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:22.400]  that for a little while so all right yes yes it does and that's thank you for
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.360]  bringing that up because what he's talking about here is don't judge see if
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.720]  it's done by the top of the plant like tops of these flowers especially on one
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.640]  like like that back there is that's not gonna say you really need to look at the
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:43.040]  trichomes like all around and again this is a why I keep going back to why I
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.760]  like this structure instead of that candelabra is because I can yank that I
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.440]  can top that chop the whole top of that thing off at once and then I can let the
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.360]  bottom regrow and I get a little bit more flower down on the bottom too but
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:03.040]  what I like about that one hemp stalk deal is that I don't have to go around
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:08.920]  to all of these different because each of those can't menorah so my country has
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.040]  can say a word that people can understand on those menorah plants
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.520]  you're going around to it's the lights hitting everything differently and
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.000]  different spots and you're it's there's a whole hell of a lot of checking going
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.400]  on when it's time for it to come down so thank you for bringing that up what
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:31.480]  bringing that question up what about Bob is yes judge it don't just look at the
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.400]  top don't just look at the bottom should get a pretty general assessment
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.800]  began especially don't look at the newest flowers that are popping off
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:46.320]  because made a joke in that Instagram post about weed that never finishes and
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.200]  that's kind of what's what's going on here is that the the tops part the top
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.160]  parts of all of those little string of pearls flowers just seems like they just
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:44:00.200]  keep running and running and running and they they never seem like they're going
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.360]  to stop they do eventually if you let them run long enough but a lot of times
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.000]  you're going to get a lot of red trichomes and you're going to get a more
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.040]  stony high that's not going to last quite as long as if you pull it right
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:25.240]  when you when you find that that perfect cloudy to I don't like a lot of red I
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:33.320]  like cloudy with just a few clear because it's gonna continue I don't
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.520]  really know how much of this is actually true because I'm not like scoping it
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:44.920]  once it's drying but my theory with it is is that when I pull it like that it's
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.920]  still maturing because the plant when I chop it the plant doesn't know it's dead
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.120]  so it's like still maturing as it's drying out and everything so it's like
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:57.760]  so it doesn't get so the trichomes don't get too red on me I like it to where
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.560]  there's a lot of cloudy ones look like a few clear so that's that's my preference
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:13.750]  everybody has their own so yeah here's somebody talking about it that's plant
[01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:17.470]  specific is I know what you're talking about there but some are a little more
[01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:20.510]  darker than others before they start turning red and it's like more
[01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:28.550]  translucent is you you see a lot of metallic stuff people talk about people
[01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:32.990]  have found a lot of blueberry plants over time that have that really like
[01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:40.390]  shimmery metallic trichome head and you find a lot of that in this long
[01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:44.310]  flowering stuff too is that shimmery trichome head and you when you think
[01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:49.670]  about it that blueberry started off with two ties and an Afghan so it makes sense
[01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:53.350]  that's popping up in that blueberry even if it is like a shorter structure
[01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:58.630]  purple plant and apparently it's even per it's even purtier when the when it's
[01:45:58.630 --> 01:46:12.900]  a purple plant and it's got that shimmery stuff on it all right oh I guess
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:18.140]  I got to the point where Peter popped in with that picture Elka got hacked
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:34.990]  all right what we got over here huh it's Peter explaining what happened with that
[01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:54.440]  whole thing okay let's let's get past all of that not really seeing yeah okay
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:05.080]  that's a good long flowering I don't know if I would days it gets kind of
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.640]  weird I usually like to talk to these plants in weeks so like long flowering I
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:15.920]  guess for most people I guess that's a individual statement but I like this
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:23.800]  question greens goddess or 420 green goddess I would say 12 weeks and up
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.720]  would that that's what I would call a long flowering plant so that you know 80
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:40.360]  days yeah I don't know it as that gets a little hairy I'm talking about this
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:47.720]  that like the stuff that what we got back here behind me like not I've
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.880]  noticed that a lot of hazes there's a reason that I put this all of that stuff
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.520]  out there that I did is what I was noticing is that people that were
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.920]  growing stuff that they were saying was haze I saw this in Massachusetts too
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.240]  when I was up there is that there was a lot of like plants on display and there
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.760]  was a couple of them that were claiming to be hazes and they didn't smell like
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:14.160]  haze they didn't look like haze that they they had narrow leaves sort of so I
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.360]  guess that makes it a haze I don't know but what I noticed is that there wasn't
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.800]  like a lot of this like real tropical stuff that people were growing out there
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:37.600]  and I just wanted to flood people with it to where it was easily accessible and
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.840]  yeah to where even if you because usually these plants are expensive these
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:48.440]  types of seeds are expensive and people like to rip people off that's what I'm
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:55.440]  getting at here is if there's like a niche like high-end market there's
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:02.400]  always gonna be assholes coming in and wanting to just like make money off of
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:08.080]  the uninformed so I just wanted to like undercut all of that by just like
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.440]  spreading as much of it around as I possibly could well that was within my
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:25.170]  and thank you Peter for helping me with that task as so so that's another reason
[01:49:25.170 --> 01:49:29.970]  why I wasn't getting into specific varieties and and whatnot with this is
[01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:33.890]  because there's a lot of stuff out there that people call haze that I would not
[01:49:33.890 --> 01:49:43.570]  consider a haze plant because to me that's that's Jack or you know to me
[01:49:43.570 --> 01:49:49.610]  Jack is Jack and haze is haze like they're two completely different things
[01:49:49.610 --> 01:49:54.050]  and I'm not a huge fan of the Jack Jack's Jack's cool it's a you know it's
[01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:58.610]  good it's good party weed like that's what's cool about Jack I like when Jack's
[01:49:58.610 --> 01:50:06.850]  at a party Jack's the life of the party so you know it's that's stuff that you
[01:50:06.850 --> 01:50:11.110]  you don't want to bring like the knockout northern lights into a party
[01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:16.250]  every time because you're gonna like you're gonna be the Debbie Downer you
[01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:24.530]  know I don't maybe I shouldn't get it again not here to be judgmental but it
[01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:28.930]  just seems to me that it's nice to bring weed that makes people happy and
[01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:33.450]  talkative instead of something that's gonna make everybody want to go to sleep
[01:50:33.450 --> 01:50:38.930]  and nobody wants to fuck after the party and you know it's like it it's weird
[01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:50.610]  it's that why you want anyway so with the with these with the classifying of
[01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:54.330]  these long flowering plants I'm sorry to get off on all of that but it's that
[01:50:54.330 --> 01:51:00.330]  to me it's stuff that it it's not just because there's a lot of this type of
[01:51:00.330 --> 01:51:08.530]  effect that people have bred and gotten down to a shorter flowering time but I
[01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:14.090]  don't know about those plants like I the closest that I've come to that is that
[01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:21.090]  dreamtime stuff from show shanty says is the the shortest flowering badass sativa
[01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:27.730]  type effects that are long-lasting in a reasonable flower time you go to from my
[01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:32.850]  experience you go to mr. nice for that apparently old-timer has also
[01:51:32.850 --> 01:51:38.810]  accomplished that same feat over there so yeah it's I don't have experience
[01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:43.370]  with those so I'm not gonna sit here and talk about those so there are plants
[01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:48.370]  like what I'm talking about with those type of effects that are shorter
[01:51:48.370 --> 01:51:54.210]  flowering times and by all means go try them out see it yeah see what that's all
[01:51:54.210 --> 01:51:59.850]  about but I know that the that what I have I know what I'm looking for so I
[01:51:59.850 --> 01:52:04.850]  can deal with that like extra flowering time and everything to where I can like
[01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:08.970]  it's not worth it for me to go into somebody else's gene pool when I already
[01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:12.050]  have enough of what I already am familiar with where I can go in there
[01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:15.650]  and find out what because I'm just going in and refinding some stuff that I had
[01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:21.250]  before and I had to get rid of because we live in a ridiculous world you know
[01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:25.610]  it's like I shouldn't have to go back and refine this plant like I had to but
[01:52:25.610 --> 01:52:30.290]  I had to and I've got to go back and reef the refined a bunch of others like
[01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:38.450]  I I'll just come right out I guess it's been about two years ago now is a year
[01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:43.450]  and a half to as I try to forget about it but yeah when all hell was breaking
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:49.450]  loose in the world up in town they were trying to burn down a library and here
[01:52:49.450 --> 01:52:55.490]  in the country I had a helicopter flying over my land scaring the shit out of me
[01:52:55.490 --> 01:53:01.210]  where I was like chopping decades worth of work with tears in my eyes because I
[01:53:01.210 --> 01:53:05.650]  I was scared of going to jail but these people that were up there burning a
[01:53:05.650 --> 01:53:13.290]  library didn't have a fear in their mind at all so yeah set me off that's another
[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:18.490]  reason why I'm here I'm sorry to get a little a little emotional but yeah
[01:53:18.490 --> 01:53:28.930]  decades of work there's some well over a decade of work but like decades of
[01:53:28.930 --> 01:53:35.610]  experience for sure I've been doing this for over 20 years so it's I had some
[01:53:35.610 --> 01:53:40.210]  things around that I've been like desperately holding on to for years and
[01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:46.930]  I just I had to chop it all and restart so yeah and I'm yeah I'm going back and
[01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:52.730]  looking for refinding things so I'm not it's not I'm not going through somebody
[01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:58.410]  else's gene pool looking for haze that I know that I can find in my own seeds so
[01:53:58.410 --> 01:54:02.770]  that's that's the story on that now like after I find my plants and I've still
[01:54:02.770 --> 01:54:06.530]  got to find the peanut butter and jelly time for the wife I've got the male but
[01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:11.810]  I need to find the the female for her and once I find that I'm gonna work that
[01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:17.970]  into something to where she can go back in to that for the rest of her life
[01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:23.210]  after I crack croak out and she can pull if she loses the cutting of peanut
[01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:27.050]  butter and jelly time she can go in and pop seeds or she doesn't even have to
[01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:31.330]  keep a cutting because I'm gonna make something for her to where she can go in
[01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:36.330]  and get her peanut butter and jelly time and yeah and she can she can have that
[01:54:36.370 --> 01:54:42.090]  so that's my next project and then while I'm doing that I'm gonna be like I said
[01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:45.730]  in the fall I'm gonna be popping a bunch of stuff from a lot of you wonderful
[01:54:45.730 --> 01:54:50.250]  people out there in the chat rooms and on IG and in the forums on JB's old
[01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:55.210]  forum that used to be around I spent a lot of time and effort on that thing man
[01:54:55.210 --> 01:55:01.170]  like my wife like transcript a bunch of shit for me like I just like dictated
[01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:05.170]  something or I would like read some shit out of marijuana botany and like to post
[01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:09.810]  stuff up on there I put a lot of effort into into stuff over the years and it
[01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:15.210]  just like goes away so I've kind of that's why I like this idea better I can
[01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:18.650]  just sit here and talk to you guys and I don't have to get my wife involved and
[01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:26.770]  waste her time and yeah so I like this is this works and thanks for hanging out
[01:55:26.770 --> 01:55:34.610]  with me people so we're getting up there in time and finish my bowl it's a keep on
[01:55:34.930 --> 01:55:42.570]  going down through these comments I'm too much light too much nutrients bad
[01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:48.570]  way to go absolutely and yeah it's at any any plant but especially with these
[01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:55.170]  finicky ones they they're gonna they're gonna punish you fucking around you got
[01:55:55.170 --> 01:56:04.400]  to have you got to have everything on point this is all right I'm gonna pop
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:12.300]  this question up here just for just as an example I could nobody can answer
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:22.750]  that question for you dude like that that increasing potency what do you mean
[01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:29.630]  dude your your idea of potency is different than somebody else's idea of
[01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:35.150]  potency and that could be coming from like straight THC and somebody's a
[01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:40.310]  perception or that could be like a bunch of flavors plus the THC or like the
[01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:45.230]  entourage effect of a bunch of different cannabinoids in there it's like there's
[01:56:45.230 --> 01:56:49.030]  some people that want to be blasted out of their minds and like just not think
[01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:54.070]  and be stuck in the couch and then there's I like that at night but then
[01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:58.470]  there's people like me they like to smoke all day and but not smoke all day
[01:56:58.470 --> 01:57:01.510]  like I like to be high all day but I don't like smoking a whole lot so that's
[01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:04.670]  why I like these plants that keep me high for a long time I smoked about a
[01:57:04.670 --> 01:57:09.470]  half a joint as long as I keep it going without it getting clogged up or because
[01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:13.910]  this this shit's sticky it'll clog up a joint but you know you know and it
[01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:20.070]  doesn't go go good in bowls it's this is yeah it's really good weed it's nice and
[01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:25.230]  sticky really sticky and oily really oily is he it's hard to make hash out
[01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:30.790]  of this shit unless you like just rubbing it on your fingers but uh yeah
[01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:36.390]  it's the potency is a different thing to everybody so it's kind of a I learned
[01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:40.110]  that with the descriptions but that that's something that I really shouldn't
[01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:44.710]  have put in into descriptions on these plants because that's that's a very
[01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:50.830]  subjective thing I guess and same with up and down I've noticed that like some
[01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:55.870]  that when I was earlier talking about earlier how my wife was nursing me on
[01:57:55.870 --> 01:58:00.510]  the back porch like having an anxiety attack from like some super uppity weed
[01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:06.350]  that same we were smoking that same shit and it made her tired like she didn't
[01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:13.590]  like it it was like it wasn't a good tired and there's like there's different
[01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:16.950]  levels of like the couch lock kind of thing with weed I think a lot of this
[01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:20.950]  audience knows about that but there's like there's tired and then there's like
[01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:24.830]  you feel like that there's just like weights on all your muscles and you
[01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:29.430]  can't fuck it's like you've been you've ate butter or something and it's not fun
[01:58:29.590 --> 01:58:33.750]  so and that's what she was describing it was like she wasn't tired she was
[01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:37.670]  mentally alert but her body was like just felt like it had weights on it so
[01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:42.470]  it's like that yeah that plant was cold because it made both of us feel horrible
[01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:47.630]  DJ short said that he had something called angry weed like he posted I don't
[01:58:47.630 --> 01:58:51.070]  remember where I read this but it was DJ short that he I think it could have been
[01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:56.710]  in his book anyway but I did read somewhere from DJ that he had this stuff
[01:58:56.830 --> 01:59:00.190]  that he would just like take out there to see if it would like have the
[01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:04.150]  consistent effect like you take it to the bar and it would start fights and
[01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:08.550]  you just sit back you let the weed get out there and you know and you just sit
[01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:13.310]  back and watch and observe kind of the the breeders testing techniques in a way
[01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:19.630]  but yeah there's angry weed is it make people like unhappy and want to fight and
[01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:24.950]  all of that so yeah there's a lot of strange effects from some of these these
[01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:32.830]  crazier types of plants is a very interesting road to start walking down
[01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:50.310]  for sure there's another interesting thing as
[01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:55.790]  people talking about lighting and stuff a lot over here is light leaks people
[01:59:55.790 --> 02:00:01.230]  know about the light leaks cannabis growers and everything that's a that's a
[02:00:01.230 --> 02:00:07.830]  fascinating topic to me the light leaks because these plants they came from
[02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:15.070]  nature and there's such a thing called the moon you know and I've looked into a
[02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:19.230]  little bit of what the hell's the difference between like why moonlight
[02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:28.110]  triggers Hermes a lot less in these these types of plants other than like
[02:00:28.110 --> 02:00:35.630]  inside having a likely light leak if you outside the moon doesn't create like a
[02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:42.230]  light leak reaction as if you had it inside and you blasted it you open the
[02:00:42.230 --> 02:00:48.790]  door and you shouldn't have or whatever people with tents or yeah anybody
[02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:55.230]  growing one of these hazes in a tent I think that's why Chad was asking that
[02:00:55.230 --> 02:01:05.220]  pinching question earlier is that the yeah yeah here's somebody that was
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:12.420]  agree I didn't I just got down to this message right here somebody agreeing
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:16.620]  with me is that yeah they pretty much defoliate themselves except for like
[02:01:16.620 --> 02:01:23.340]  what what I was talking about with like the the the sugar leaf around the string
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:28.180]  of pearls is how it like kind of intertwines and gets kind of a little
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:34.700]  bit of a mess to deal with and that's why I like busting it up into pieces
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:51.500]  yeah here's somebody else concurring yeah yeah yeah twist and snap
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:59.700]  AK piss is charming have another piss connoisseur as is it is it six-star
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:04.660]  piss everybody that AK piss is that that's the that's the six-star it's up
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:25.690]  there with the 707 trellis it yeah that's a that's helpful I heard mentioned
[02:02:25.690 --> 02:02:30.490]  loud mentioned sorry for leaving a word out there but loud mentioned on his show
[02:02:30.490 --> 02:02:34.810]  when he was talking about the quays and the dr. Grinspoon he said that when he
[02:02:34.810 --> 02:02:39.650]  saw it they had the fucking thing stapled to a wall it was like it was so
[02:02:39.650 --> 02:02:45.370]  pearled out that they just like they had it pulled the staple gun out to control
[02:02:45.370 --> 02:02:53.210]  it there's an idea I guess I don't know might have airflow issues but you know
[02:02:53.210 --> 02:03:11.030]  it's pretty airy so rudic up then flip I mentioned that at the beginning I I
[02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:16.070]  don't know you it you're probably going to still get a pretty nice size plant
[02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:21.230]  off of one of these types of plants if you do that it I don't know I don't have
[02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:25.710]  experience with that but I've never started one from seeded from 1212 or
[02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:33.230]  like from a cutting at 1212 and speaking of that this is completely off-topic but
[02:03:33.670 --> 02:03:42.030]  rooting cuts at anything other than 18 and 6 there's a awesome I'm one of these
[02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:46.390]  days I'm gonna do a mentioned earlier that I have an awesome old high times
[02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:51.230]  collection that I inherited and I'm gonna go through those one day and
[02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:55.070]  there's an awesome article on one of these shows I'm gonna go through those
[02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:58.870]  and I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures and go through a slideshow and everything
[02:03:58.870 --> 02:04:04.030]  and it's I've got something really cool plan for that so be patient and I'm
[02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:07.230]  gonna do that because I got a lot of really cool old high times and in one of
[02:04:07.230 --> 02:04:11.110]  those really old high times there's an interview with the super sativa seed
[02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:16.230]  club and in that interview they're talking about their plantlet method
[02:04:16.230 --> 02:04:21.990]  which was their like perpetual growing method using cuttings and all of that
[02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:26.470]  it's a very interesting old article and a lot of the information stands up in it
[02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:34.950]  today and that's what I'm about to talk about is they say in there to keep your
[02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:42.390]  cuttings at 18 and 6 don't don't put them on 24 hours don't put them on 1212
[02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:50.070]  keep them at 18 and 6 where you're taking or I guess the more accurate
[02:04:50.230 --> 02:04:57.830]  would be is to keep okay I'll just leave it at that as yeah let's not get too
[02:04:57.830 --> 02:05:02.430]  complicated here keep them at 18 six is most likely you're taking the cuttings
[02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:09.830]  off of plants that are on an 18 and 6 cycle and your root those cuttings under
[02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:15.230]  18 and 6 don't switch them to 24 hours and they give a reasoning for this and I
[02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:19.750]  checked on this and they were right they didn't like offer any scientific
[02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:26.990]  backing for it but they were correct and the re I looked it up and what they they
[02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:33.630]  said that it'll revert it'll revert back to thinking it's a new plant it's not
[02:05:33.630 --> 02:05:40.390]  gonna think it's an old plant and like take off growing like like you want it
[02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:43.910]  to like when you take these cuttings you want them to root and then you want them
[02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:48.270]  to start shooting as soon as possible like once they start root because there
[02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:52.110]  seems to be a correlation between the root and the shoot when they start
[02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:58.310]  taking off so and what they were saying is is that when you like take a cutting
[02:05:58.310 --> 02:06:04.190]  off of a plant that's at 18 and 6 and then switch it to 24 hours light that it
[02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:09.550]  reverts back to where like it thinks that it's a seedling again it goes back
[02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:14.470]  to a seedling concoction of hormones and this has been studied in all types
[02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:19.150]  of plants and this is probably something that they picked up from the the ag
[02:06:19.150 --> 02:06:24.790]  industry over there in Holland it's because they they do a lot of plants in
[02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:29.790]  Holland they always have so it's a yeah there's probably something that they
[02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:33.870]  picked up from the agricultural community over there in Holland it's
[02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:38.870]  like when you're taking these cuttings don't baby fire them which means like to
[02:06:39.230 --> 02:06:44.870]  it once you because that it's scientifically shown that when you give
[02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:51.870]  when you put a plant a cutting like that under 24 hours of light it it reverts
[02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:56.750]  back to young hormones because of the lack of the root cyst there's a lot of
[02:06:56.750 --> 02:07:00.710]  reasons but you can just think about it like a seedling coming out it has a
[02:07:00.710 --> 02:07:04.510]  certain concoction of hormones in it that's meant to do very specific things
[02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:13.630]  when you knock a plant out of its light cycle like that super sativa seed club
[02:07:13.630 --> 02:07:18.190]  knew back in the mid 80s that that was gonna fuck you up in the long run and
[02:07:18.190 --> 02:07:23.950]  it's it's shown out in scientific literature and I have had problems in
[02:07:23.950 --> 02:07:28.670]  the past before I like came across this article I had the magazine around but I
[02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:35.230]  didn't read that article until and then once I had I was like that's okay and
[02:07:35.230 --> 02:07:40.310]  then my rooting success went up after that as my plants were a lot better I
[02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:45.550]  had better yields also it this shit affects your yield it's like because
[02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:49.990]  anyway yeah it makes the difference is how you start the plants off if you're
[02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:54.070]  starting a cutting off and it thinks that it's a seedling it's confused for
[02:07:54.070 --> 02:07:59.550]  the rest of its life there's the that's the fucking point that's what they found
[02:07:59.550 --> 02:08:04.630]  at the super sativa seed club a long time ago and that's if you look it up in
[02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:16.270]  botany research that's what they found too so there's that any going through
[02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:19.150]  these comments more
[02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:27.390]  them y'all explained is femme what what is the femme I hear this term a lot
[02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:31.510]  being thrown around and I'm not quite sure what they're talking about with the
[02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:37.310]  femme is it like because when the reason why this isn't this is an older term is
[02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:41.310]  around on the forums too but the plants never looked the same like I couldn't
[02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:44.430]  get like what everybody seemed to be doing something different and all
[02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:48.910]  calling it femme so I'm kind of curious what what you all are talking about
[02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:53.350]  with the when let's get a consensus on what femme means over here in the chat
[02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:58.350]  room if we can yeah the consensus in the chat room that's it yeah that's a dream
[02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:06.160]  isn't it anyway all right see what else y'all got
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:13.160]  that's a cool question hey sound which seed company has the goods when it comes
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.400]  the haze like the old pirate sweat you're gonna find that pirate sweat in
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:24.840]  Shanti go to Shanti for the pirate sweat that's absolutely that's where I
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.640]  found it there's a there's some of it in that original haze skunk one that I've
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:34.440]  got but it's more of a sweeter like that pirate sweat stuff that's the reason I
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:38.920]  gave it that it's it's got a heart it's hard to describe it really is it's like
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:48.080]  it's a spicy kind of sour deal and yeah it's I bet I imagine there's some fruit
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.000]  out there that's like this that I've never experienced in my lifetime so
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  that's a that's a nice throwback right there cool
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:09.930]  Jason s I dig that yeah that's probably good advice man but I'm giving that this
[02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:16.330]  is I'm trying to do do my thing see how it works out and hopefully like it it
[02:10:16.330 --> 02:10:22.450]  doesn't devolve we'll see you know if I get a lot of negative comments about it
[02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:26.650]  over time then I'll probably just quit it because I can see how it can bother
[02:10:26.650 --> 02:10:30.570]  some people like especially the people that are just listening if I don't like
[02:10:30.570 --> 02:10:37.970]  read the read the question so yeah it's it I I really appreciate your your input
[02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:52.320]  Chad you're you're awesome you host a very like what was the word the wife
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:57.960]  used when she was watching you very smooth show like you're you're you're
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:01.800]  good with all of this computer a lot better than I am with I'm really clunky
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.880]  with the controls and you got a nice voice and you're smooth with the
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:11.480]  controls and you let the debt the guests talk that's a that's another thing she
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.960]  said is you let the guests talk that's that's the sign of a good interviewer
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:25.470]  all right I'm done talking to Chad no I quit swinging off a sad but Chad's balls
[02:11:25.470 --> 02:11:40.470]  over here that's a what else we got sounds I'm really happy to see that this
[02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:48.950]  has been a positive chat room over here that's that's very nice Joe why sweet
[02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:56.150]  nice to see you man good CEO Joe he's one of those old-school I first saw him
[02:11:56.150 --> 02:12:03.230]  on Adam Dunn show chat room long before I started participating he's when it
[02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:08.750]  when you over time there's just like sir there's no offense to everybody else
[02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:13.430]  it's like there's just certain names that pop up over time that you resonate
[02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:16.350]  with and I think that everybody understands this everybody resonates
[02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:20.910]  with different types of folks and I remember when I first started chatting
[02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:27.470]  in the 80s chat room they I wasn't very well received at first a lot of these
[02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:34.070]  guys they're considered like imaginary friends now but they Tony baloney didn't
[02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:38.150]  like me I could tell Tony he had he had a wrench back then too I'm surprised he
[02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:42.910]  didn't kick my ass out but he was he was cool is that he is cool
[02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:48.030]  Tony baloney's he's yeah he's one of those old-school cats he's he's awesome
[02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:53.590]  and he he was very skeptical of me along with some other people that I'm not
[02:12:53.590 --> 02:12:57.270]  gonna name a bunch of names but since Tony was a moderator back then he didn't
[02:12:57.270 --> 02:13:02.350]  kick me kick me out I thought I'd show him a little love cuz and like he told
[02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:05.950]  me later on that he just thought I was some punk kid and no I was just in there
[02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:12.110]  trolling but no I just like I like to fuck around I get in there is it I like
[02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:16.790]  to have fun as you know I like having fun with you guys so I try not to take
[02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:20.670]  shit too serious ooh Hawken yeah I have some
[02:13:20.670 --> 02:13:26.830]  wahaken from from a K from a K bean brains I have his his wahaken thing and
[02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:35.630]  I yeah that will definitely be grown I don't know when it's not gonna be part
[02:13:35.630 --> 02:13:42.390]  of the the chat because he's not a chat room guy but yeah he I may actually like
[02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:46.070]  use if I go through that wahaken I'm thinking that I'm gonna find something
[02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:49.950]  that I'm gonna want to use in there so I need to be very strategic about when I
[02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:53.950]  go into those but I asked him for a description and he he was awesome he
[02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:59.990]  gave me a very nice description that told me what I needed to know so yeah
[02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:05.990]  cool guy I said a case yeah he's he's one of the gems in this industry for
[02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:12.310]  sure he's he's done a lot of work that was a cool interview back and talking to
[02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:16.750]  chat again there's a cool interview you did with him man is that you get you get
[02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:29.000]  some good guests all right there you go see that's that's what I'm talking about
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.360]  everybody's got their own and it's gonna be different time frames yours may never
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.280]  fucking finish I've found that too I've had your your favorite strain some
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.560]  people out there their favorite strain may never finish it's just it's just
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:46.040]  gonna keep flowering and flowering flowering you know find a way to make it
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:15:05.280]  work for you here's a here's a nice little comment yeah yeah that's I that's
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:12.120]  the reason why I don't want to really grow pure hazes I don't feel like I need
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:17.320]  to I think that I've gotten enough expression of the the pure haze in what
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:26.120]  I have to not really I don't let other people get those like he's only made so
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:32.000]  much of those and I don't I don't need to I don't need a 50 pack of that other
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.920]  people do there's people out there that don't have those types of plants and
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:42.760]  that's what he made those for as he had the same yeah I got the feeling from him
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:50.080]  when we talked a while back about this these types of plants that he when he
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.720]  was doing that haze for days project that it was the same motivation that I
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:16:01.120]  had when I started giving stuff away at trade shows and talking to Peter and
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:05.760]  just talking to you guys over here and get it get anybody that I sent stuff to
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:13.800]  got some form of haze some people have like they got more than others some
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.720]  people just got a little pack of dream time with a bunch of other stuff I kind
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:21.800]  of tried to get a feel for what people were into again not wasting people's
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:26.080]  time or giving them things that they they didn't really care about but also
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  like giving people enough to share with their friends and stuff is that that was
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:37.120]  that's the whole point is if I get the reason I give somebody a 50 pack of
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:43.480]  seeds is because that I don't expect you to grow off 50 you can it have added do
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:48.320]  do whatever you want with them but as I give away a bunch of seeds because that
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:53.080]  I want you to give away seeds it's like hey I got plenty of these here you try
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.000]  some to is maybe you'll have better luck with them than I can who know I
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.360]  don't know what's gonna happen with these seeds but I just wanted them out
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:04.960]  there and I'm glad they're out there and I'm really happy to see the people are
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:07.720]  growing the damn things and they're enjoying them it's like even the people
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.160]  that are happy to just see a narrow leaf plant for once it's like they've spent
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:15.280]  hundreds of dollars on stuff that they just wanted to grow something lanky with
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:20.040]  narrow leaves and they finally got it and that that makes me feel like a
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:24.120]  success if that's that's all they wanted hey that's easier on me because
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:26.600]  they're not gonna worried about if it fucking harmed on them or anything
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:30.880]  because they I don't know how you're growing or what you're doing to these
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:42.680]  things so and I did anyway I'm not I'm not gonna get into that I don't have
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:48.720]  anything interesting to say about SF SFG at all I don't know anything about SFG
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:18:04.240]  and my IG is Elka Schoenmachers just like Neville's last name and yeah and
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:09.720]  IG made me use that I've always tried to like keep the Elka kind of like
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:17.960]  ambiguous did it on Shanti's forum and JB's forum but IG would not let me like
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:25.360]  anything that I put after the Elka they they rejected until I did that and it
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.680]  fucking took it of course and I was fed up by then I don't have much patience
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:37.520]  for these apps I don't like discord I've learned that I just absolutely hate
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:43.040]  discord they it bothers the hell out of me it's confusing they make it a bitch
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:49.680]  for me to get on every time it's not a fucking it yeah and some of you cool
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:53.720]  younger folks like that's the only thing that you all want to talk on is fucking
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:19:00.040]  discord so I keep it for that but I rarely check it and I can't even like
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:04.360]  get it for some reason I can't even like interact with Peters thing anymore I
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:08.000]  don't know what happened with that I know that I was on there for a while I
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.920]  made a few posts on there some of my old high times I think one of those is on
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:20.540]  there volcanic weed I think anyway yeah it's I don't like interfacing with
[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:27.740]  discord the the dagger thing I need to I do need to get on Peters dagger thing
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:33.100]  and like get involved on that because that's I told him I would for one thing
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:39.180]  and I haven't really it he never told me if he set me up an area on there to
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:42.420]  where I would be able to feel the questions but apparently there's people
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:46.780]  that have been trying to contact me on there and I I have trouble interfacing
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:53.380]  with that also so really what works best for me is IG at the moment and I
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:59.620]  check the I'm this weekend I will be checking my DMS for anybody that's
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:03.660]  messaged me I will be doing that this weekend but I'd like I've got to sit
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:07.060]  down in front of a computer like I am now and like do a bunch of typing and it
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:11.540]  takes me a while and so I got to dedicate time to it and I will be
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:16.660]  dedicating time to that and popping seeds this weekend so I'll get back to
[02:20:16.660 --> 02:20:31.860]  y'all so I think that I've gone off the rails here and yeah I said I guess I
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:41.280]  could sit here and like just finish smoking the bowl I'm gonna go that's a
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:48.320]  Buddha boy feel and I wonder what that that means uncomfortable on discord it
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.280]  doesn't make me uncomfortable it just pisses me off I guess that's
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:21:04.360]  uncomfortable in a way but anyway anyway as a cool that's gonna have me thinking
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:16.850]  sup smiley get a life yeah no shit yeah I do need to get a life I need to get a
[02:21:16.850 --> 02:21:24.290]  job is good there's some some really good jobs that I'm sleeping on right now
[02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:29.370]  yeah so I'm just gonna get high now I think I'm done talking about this plant
[02:21:29.370 --> 02:21:40.010]  back here is it she's a beaut okay somebody correct me if I'm wrong on
[02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:48.810]  this but I'm pretty sure that ak-47 is skunk number one in Afghan if I'm I'm
[02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:56.770]  pretty sure I could be wrong about that but I don't know it's it's been a while
[02:21:56.770 --> 02:22:04.250]  like I have a lot of respect for Simon I will say that is Simon I my mentors
[02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:12.210]  went through a bubblegum hunt when I was in my 20s late 20s and what was cool
[02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:16.530]  about that is that they knew their shit and they were going around to like they
[02:22:16.530 --> 02:22:23.370]  got Dunn's they got Boggs they got Simon's they got the the white label
[02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:28.890]  from Cincy so they they knew their shit and they went after like the real deal
[02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:37.250]  stuff and they what they found the pink bazooka Joe and was in bog stuff so
[02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:43.490]  that's how ball got kind of a reputation his reputation started around these
[02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:49.010]  parts is because that he won the bubblegum hunt so and the bubblegum
[02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:52.930]  that was one of the things that got me in trouble with when I first started
[02:22:52.930 --> 02:22:59.010]  talking on Dunn's chat is because most of the bubblegum that we went through on
[02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:03.570]  that bubblegum hunt wasn't very good it was it was goofy we didn't it wasn't
[02:23:03.570 --> 02:23:10.330]  bubblegum and it was like not great Afghans so and you know it's it was just
[02:23:10.330 --> 02:23:16.570]  one pack of each so don't don't think I'm on here hating but yeah there's the
[02:23:16.570 --> 02:23:24.010]  there's the bubblegum hunt and bog one that and but Simon's like the Simon's
[02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:30.610]  was more interesting of the the rest of them so they those guys kind of they
[02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:36.010]  they got more stuff from serious after that and the AK was one of those so
[02:23:36.010 --> 02:23:41.810]  that's their selection of AK is my experience with ak-47 and like I said
[02:23:41.810 --> 02:24:02.750]  the parents on that I don't know maybe somebody okay here's somebody that
[02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:08.070]  sounds like what they call skunk number one to me so if they say it was all in
[02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:15.710]  all in this who you know who knows it's a shouldn't have even attempted what's
[02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:24.450]  what's going on there but that's that that's the most likely fucking thing
[02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:31.130]  really you know it's because just because of what I don't you know there's
[02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:36.690]  not a lot of information on Simon out there and good for him but what you do
[02:24:36.690 --> 02:24:42.570]  get gather from him and from interviews he's done a few interviews and yeah he's
[02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:48.070]  a no-nonsense guy and I believe that I believe that that he would have something
[02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:52.090]  like that he probably wouldn't have told people what it was he had his parents
[02:24:52.090 --> 02:25:00.570]  and none yeah you know none your business is what it is right yeah that's
[02:25:00.570 --> 02:25:06.250]  there's there's a lot of there's there's a lot of good really like stand-up
[02:25:06.250 --> 02:25:13.010]  awesome people in the cannabis seed game and he he would be considered one of
[02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:20.370]  them and then there's the then there's the not the not so revered types out
[02:25:20.370 --> 02:25:31.650]  there and we'll just leave that alone so you know you I'll tell you the the
[02:25:31.650 --> 02:25:37.250]  cannabis seed game tells you a lot about human character when you start learning
[02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:41.210]  about the history and and all of that stuff is yeah you learn a lot about
[02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:46.370]  human behavior and character and like what people's priorities are and like
[02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:52.250]  how much empathy they have you think about one pot grower snitching on
[02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:59.930]  another pot grower knowing that they they would be experienced thing the same
[02:25:59.930 --> 02:26:05.170]  thing in jail that this other person is experiencing in jail over a fucking
[02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:11.850]  flower so that has never made any sense to me at all it's like it doesn't matter
[02:26:11.850 --> 02:26:18.010]  how much fucking time you're getting faced with I just I think that I would
[02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:24.090]  hope that my empathy would overtake my desire to get out of the cage a little
[02:26:24.090 --> 02:26:30.130]  bit sooner because none of us are really going in there for like hopefully none
[02:26:30.130 --> 02:26:35.850]  of us in this audience are doing anything so egregious to where we're
[02:26:35.850 --> 02:26:41.650]  going away for a long long long time these days you know like back in the day
[02:26:41.650 --> 02:26:45.330]  yeah they were hard handed down some harsh shit on people just to make an
[02:26:45.330 --> 02:26:49.410]  example out of them but now we're living in a different time now and shit's still
[02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:55.210]  harsh and it all depends on where you are but basically my point is is that
[02:26:55.210 --> 02:27:00.890]  it's we're living in a different world now and I'm happy to be in it and the
[02:27:00.890 --> 02:27:04.890]  reason that we're living in a different world now is why I feel comfortable
[02:27:05.250 --> 02:27:11.810]  putting my face on this fucking camera and talking to you people you dig a few
[02:27:11.810 --> 02:27:16.330]  years ago I wouldn't it does like before the farm bill that's one one thing
[02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:19.690]  there's that there's plenty there's a lot of reasons but that that's one of
[02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:27.130]  them anyway it's yeah know your risks in life know what kind of risks you're
[02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:32.530]  taking and and check with the people that care about you around you and like
[02:27:32.530 --> 02:27:36.530]  make sure that they're willing to take the same risks that you are that's just
[02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:43.610]  common courtesy I shouldn't be giving moral lessons here that's but you know
[02:27:44.130 --> 02:27:49.050]  yeah it depends on how shit your local laws are it's true and like what your
[02:27:49.050 --> 02:27:56.130]  like local sheriff and everything it's yeah it's everything is locale
[02:27:56.170 --> 02:28:04.890]  dependent to bring it back to these plants you know is that they yeah man
[02:28:04.890 --> 02:28:20.310]  get on all that stuff laws and shit like that know your risk sad to hear Jeff man
[02:28:20.310 --> 02:28:27.430]  I'm sad to hear you were one of the victims it's I just don't get it it's
[02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:34.190]  like this especially with this plant because of empathy you know this plant
[02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:39.430]  is it one thing that's known about cannabis is that it creates empathy
[02:28:39.430 --> 02:28:47.750]  within its users some of us are very emotional people we're like I shouldn't
[02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:52.630]  be talking for everybody I'll shut up on that but it as it seems like a safe
[02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:58.590]  general rule that pot smokers are a little bit more thoughtful and caring
[02:28:58.590 --> 02:29:05.790]  than your average fucking tweaker you did I said oh no that really shouldn't
[02:29:05.790 --> 02:29:14.630]  have to be stated so yeah yeah and empathy can be yeah absolutely yeah get
[02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:23.510]  you in trouble you care about the yeah you got to be careful damn right gotta
[02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:39.900]  be careful I'll use one of my mother-in-law's phrases here let people
[02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:46.660]  know how you want to be treated you know that's that's something really cool that
[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:53.940]  I heard her say to her grandkids a lot I like I like that she's she's cool lady
[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:58.340]  she she gave birth to a really cool lady so it's not surprising she came from a
[02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:05.460]  really cool lady yes yeah anybody that heard me talking about my grandma-in-law
[02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:18.580]  that has seen the the elves yeah that's yeah 2d she's what I kind of let's talk
[02:30:18.580 --> 02:30:23.180]  about the elves for a second for a hop off here with the elves what seems to be
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:27.180]  going on with the elves from what she's describing because she's going into it
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:32.020]  completely fucking sober like she goes into that realm and she's seeing exactly
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:41.980]  what Terrence McKenna was talking about but she's going into it not discombobulated
[02:30:41.980 --> 02:30:46.780]  like she's completely so she may sometimes maybe she's had some wine or
[02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:53.860]  maybe a bourbon or two but you know like she's not fucked up fucked up that she's
[02:30:53.860 --> 02:30:59.060]  going in there and she don't like them for one and they're because they're too
[02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:04.460]  personal they get they get too close and that they they seem to be distracting
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:10.420]  her from what's behind them and that's what she after talking to her that's
[02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:14.980]  what I've gathered is what she's what she's experiencing in here it would be
[02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:22.260]  awesome if I could fucking just go in there sober and do it myself or but I've
[02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:27.580]  never like taken enough mushrooms to see elves I've seen like I never see
[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:31.780]  anything really weird at all like you the mushrooms talk to you and stuff like
[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:42.340]  that but yeah no entities or elves or and it's I see a lot of shapes and like
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:47.980]  geometric like grids and stuff like that and that's what she described that the
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:53.260]  elves are distracting her from is that's what's behind them if you can like stop
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:57.900]  focusing on this amazing shit that they keep bouncing in front of you and
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:06.580]  bouncing of themselves and whatever but she she's seeing it because of macular
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:19.420]  degeneration and basically sensory deprivation essentially and yeah it they
[02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:27.260]  appear to be distracting humans from whatever is behind them and who knows I
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:33.740]  don't know she sure as hell doesn't know she she doesn't like talking to me about
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:38.340]  it and I've quit I'm not gonna ask her any more questions because I know what
[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:42.060]  it's like not to want to relive things like I've been some through some pretty
[02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:46.980]  shitty shit in my life just like everybody else and I don't like reliving
[02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:55.100]  it you know it's it's kind of not it's not polite to ask somebody about their
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:33:00.820]  prison experience unless they're talking about it you know or any negative
[02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:06.740]  experience in their life or somebody that's been molested before it's like so
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:13.020]  what was that like you know that's not you don't anyway all right I'm nice and
[02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:18.780]  high and just fucking rambling on about nonsense now so yeah Tootie hangs out
[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:30.060]  with the elves and hates it and yeah feel bad for so the weirdest thing that
[02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:36.460]  I ever saw was an invisible plane and I was able to explain that shit so I don't
[02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:46.140]  know I'm not big into the the aliens or any of that like weird like I try to
[02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:55.220]  keep things on on like a on a basic level you know is if I was to see
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.900]  something like that flying around in the sky I wouldn't go straight alien I would
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:06.100]  go military you know that just makes more sense to me than aliens coming here
[02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:09.940]  and fucking with us there is that strange thing about how all of this
[02:34:09.940 --> 02:34:14.140]  shit started showing up after we started setting off nukes there is that little
[02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:18.500]  tidbit that that always sticks in the back of my mind is how these things
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:23.380]  started fucking popping in when we started fucking blowing trying to blow
[02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:33.140]  ourselves up so there's that so I do try to remain open-minded like for instance
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:37.980]  on something cannabis related cheddar was using this fucking brush the other
[02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:42.540]  day like knocking fan leaves off of his bud and it looked like he was just like
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:46.660]  scraping the goddamn trichomes off the thing so I was kind of giving him hell
[02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:50.980]  for it but I did look into it and these things are apparently a really nice
[02:34:50.980 --> 02:34:59.540]  method for getting those those were low frosty sugar leaves off of in off of the
[02:34:59.540 --> 02:35:04.900]  your your your tighter nooks without getting scissors in there and remove so
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:09.140]  he made a good point of why that the scissors are more of a trichome removal
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:19.740]  tool than the little silicone barbecue basting brush was so I yeah hey I come
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:25.900]  across something new I'll look into it I'm not you know I just never seen it
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:35.060]  before and it looked like he was ruining his fucking bud so yeah yeah
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:38.860]  keep an open mind but don't let your brain fall out that's the old saying
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:45.980]  right yeah that's pretty good one oh yeah Husky's heard about the can of
[02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:53.780]  brush and it Peterson oh cool cool yeah good to hear good to hear it's uh that's
[02:35:53.780 --> 02:36:00.020]  what this plant behind me it's a out of those same seeds I went into that
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:04.700]  because I wanted I wanted mama back I wanted that mama back again and this was
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:10.420]  my fastest route back to that mama so yeah I didn't have to go through a bunch
[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:14.820]  of like original hay skunk number one seeds again to find mama because I
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:22.180]  crossed mama into to my to my mail so yeah that that made it glad I glad I did
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:30.460]  that it's making things a lot faster for me this time around yeah I said if
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:33.580]  you weren't here earlier I can I can give you a little bit of what what to
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:37.020]  expect with that you're gonna either you're gonna get something that looks
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:43.100]  like this it's like a hempy like one stalk with like a big big wiffle ball
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:46.700]  bat kind of thing on the on the top of it or you're gonna get something that's
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:56.780]  like looking like a menorah that's got a bunch of those on it so yeah it's I
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:37:02.900]  liked it that's why it was the haze that I dove back into and another thing that
[02:37:02.900 --> 02:37:06.700]  I said earlier if you weren't here is that I put those out there because I
[02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:12.580]  released the original haze times skunk one open pollinations out there and then
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:18.260]  asked me if I had any more of those and I did but I went through and like found
[02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:24.820]  what I had in my collection that I had made that I'd seen enough of to where I
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:29.740]  knew that people out there were gonna be able to like I would know what I have a
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:34.540]  general idea of what you all got we're gonna see so anything that I've put out
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:40.620]  there I've seen enough of them to where I I can I got a pretty good idea of what
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:45.860]  you guys are gonna be seeing too so with this stuff you're gonna as far as
[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:50.740]  flavors go you're gonna get anything from like really sweet skunk one fruity
[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:59.340]  niceness you'll get some little spicy it's I guess that it's about 30 30 30 of
[02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:08.620]  either pissy pissy sweet or mostly sweet or something that's a little bit on the
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:13.820]  spicier end of haze because haze has this like certain unique kind of kind of
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:17.940]  spice to it and sometimes it's got that sourness to it that I was talking about
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:23.100]  with the pirate sweat description thing is when it's got that sourness to that
[02:38:23.100 --> 02:38:28.540]  spicy haze that's what I would describe this pirate sweat and then there's the
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:34.140]  the just regular like spicy it's got a nice like kind of incense II kind of
[02:38:34.140 --> 02:38:44.460]  vibe to it so yeah the pretty good stuff and the the bobcat spray I don't
[02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:49.340]  know that's one of the I usually give a really detailed description with all of
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:55.660]  these things but with that bobcat spray and with the the coyote scat I I didn't
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:00.460]  I was rushed and I just found what Peter was asking me for something similar and
[02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:05.420]  I just packed it up and got it to him I knew that it was good good stuff and I
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:10.700]  had a shit ton of stuff going on last summer dog dying on me and shit and well
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:21.110]  he didn't die it threatened threatened to so anyway yeah that's uh yeah oh
[02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:26.390]  there's there's a lot of getting into the effects I mentioned this earlier
[02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:30.190]  with another question is I'm I'm not really going to get into the effects so
[02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:36.230]  much on these plants because they they affect everybody different ways like I
[02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:42.510]  told a story earlier about me being having a panic attack like speed it up
[02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:49.910]  beyond belief and my wife was felt like she had weights on her on her muscles so
[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:54.430]  it's completely different to each individual so I'm not gonna get so much
[02:39:54.430 --> 02:40:01.070]  into effects but the smells and flavors are pretty consistent and the yeah as
[02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:06.790]  the the bobcat spray is probably the reason that I popped that instead of
[02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:14.910]  something out of the the the dog shit cross the coyote scat is because I
[02:40:14.910 --> 02:40:20.270]  prefer the the stuff out of the original Hayes more than the NL Hayes the the
[02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:24.190]  original Hayes skunk one I'm sorry I prefer plants out of out of that more
[02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:30.630]  often than I do the NL Hayes that I have that stuff is really good for me to
[02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:35.350]  grow outside and get a nice little Hayes crop out as that that is for a specific
[02:40:35.350 --> 02:40:40.230]  purpose for me and it is good smoke but I I was running this inside to test it
[02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:43.950]  out and everything and it's like the stuff that I like so yeah original Hayes
[02:40:43.950 --> 02:40:49.110]  skunk one cross is and that's that's all I was going for is that original Hayes
[02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:53.110]  skunk one I wasn't looking for my I didn't breed that line so that I would
[02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:56.390]  go in there and looking for that stuff when I would cross it into things that's
[02:40:56.390 --> 02:41:00.670]  not that wasn't the purpose of it it was to just kind of hang out in the back and
[02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:07.070]  be a backboard for me to cross something a plant that I find that I like into and
[02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:12.950]  be able to go find it again later on and that has served me very well so far so
[02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:18.390]  yeah there's a little tip for if you want to want to do that it's a it's
[02:41:18.390 --> 02:41:31.900]  worked for me might work for you so I think I should wrap it up it's a I've
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:38.580]  been going on for way longer than I expected to so yeah the short
[02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:45.420]  conversation turned into a long ramble and thanks for hanging out the the 96
[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:54.060]  that are that are still here so yeah I will say a few things since the people
[02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.980]  are gonna watch this later on there nobody asked me about the bobcat spray
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:01.420]  but with it with that stuff it I will say that it's a it's a little bit more
[02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:06.300]  sex stable than the original Hayes skunk one is inside I've had less problems
[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:11.860]  with it like flipping sexes on me inside it but it's an it's actually an outdoor
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:16.580]  plant it performs much better outside where I am than it does inside but it
[02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:21.580]  it is more stable inside than a lot of these other things Shanti's hazes are
[02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:26.420]  very stable inside from my my experience
[02:42:26.740 --> 02:42:32.780]  yeah that's a and the with the with the dog shit it's not the Pacific Northwest
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:38.540]  dog shit I don't know what that stuff is but this plant like smelled like somebody
[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:44.740]  like stepped in and like spread around for a while dog shit when you chop this
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:52.580]  plant I mean just like and it tasted it like almost had I don't want to say no
[02:42:52.580 --> 02:43:00.980]  flavor but almost no flavor it had a flavor it just tasted like weed it
[02:43:00.980 --> 02:43:04.500]  didn't taste bad it didn't taste real good it didn't really taste like
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:09.460]  anything but it tastes is like herbal I guess you'd call it it's fucking herbal
[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:16.340]  so yeah but it was like that plants from that stuff that no Hayes that was the
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:20.660]  stuff that had me on the back porch and my wife nursing me it was actually one
[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:28.500]  of those it sent me into like a my chest had so much pressure on it and my heart
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:32.580]  was beating so fast and I couldn't breathe I really thought that I was
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:38.500]  about to die out there and she's like calm me down that the that that in El
[02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:45.340]  Hayes is it can be very powerful so it's not is it ain't bad there's a reason I
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:49.780]  put those two things out there that's why I'm ending on this is Peter asked me
[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:55.060]  for for more of that other stuff and I didn't have it but I did have this so
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:58.740]  yeah I put that shit out there so because I knew what you all were gonna
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:04.260]  be seeing in it and yeah hopefully I didn't give anybody panic attacks but
[02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:10.180]  like I like I said earlier I don't directly like hand people stuff like
[02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:16.820]  that that I can like that I can get a feel for you know what I mean because I
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:22.180]  don't want to I don't want to hurt someone so yeah and hey Hayes can hurt
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:28.100]  you I know that's controversial to say but it's true as I think any plan I've
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:31.980]  seen people freak out on Indicus too it's just it's about tolerance more than
[02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:38.620]  anything but there's something it's like next-level paranoia and like anxiety and
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:48.060]  like hypertension which is like not good so yeah hypertension Hayes peace
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:50.540]  everybody
