Yeah, why don't you meet your thing real quickly.
Yeah.
You take that one, I'll take this one.
Thank you, buddy.
Yeah.
All right, so we are live.
Hey.
And Chad, you were just talking about.
He's getting ambushed there.
Yeah, we were talking, well, the question was
if I smoked a bunch of super silver haze
while I was in Amsterdam recently
and that answer was an emphatic yes.
A lot of hazes.
I love the haze over there.
For some reason, and my wife, the same here,
whenever she smokes like the hazes
that we'll get at the store, just I don't grow them myself,
they always kind of give her a little bit
of like anxiety or paranoia.
And I'm almost wondering if that's just
because people here pull them too early?
Yeah, that could happen too.
Certain ones, man, they give you the fear
and other ones, not so much.
More energizing and brain stimulating
and other stuff would just have you peeking out the windows
in a legal state, like it's weird.
And we liked them, but the ones in Amsterdam,
they're all, we don't get any of that,
but we do get like super high, like the racy high,
like psychedelic high, but also the,
I almost say like high school high where you're dumb.
You realize how dumb you just got
after you smoked that bowl, but you smile anyways.
That's right, that's right, man.
Just stupefied, just like you gave us some butt at the moment.
Yeah, so we enjoyed that and then lots of hash too.
Oh, beans.
But yeah, thanks for asking, that was a fun trip, man.
Oh, I bet, man, I bet.
They really got haze right over there, that's for sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we stuck to, all kinds.
No, Chad, you asked me to send
the Venmo and Cash App information.
Where do you guys want me to send this to?
You see the private chat and then private chat?
Should be over to the right of the screen of the four of us.
So on the stream yard, it's over to the right.
I'm seeing.
Private chat, so you see, okay.
Yep, I see it.
Okay, you can do that too.
And then I'll be back in a couple minutes.
Okay.
I got a four year old who's gonna unwillingly go to bed.
Good luck, may the force be with you.
Down for bath time and a sassy seven year old
who does not need to go to bed.
Okay, I'll be back.
All right, bud.
Awesome, so I guess we're just kind of gonna
get things kicked off here.
Just to let everybody know, everybody in chat,
thank you for joining.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you for the support.
This is definitely for the love of community
and community member, Nick Rysden.
And I wanna say Rysden, not Rizden, Rysden.
But that's what we're here for tonight.
And I don't know, Duke, do you maybe wanna say,
kind of a couple of words about what we're here for
or what we're doing?
Yeah, for sure, man.
Nick's just, he's always been such a solid ass dude.
And for all the solid ass people out there,
like you know, that's in short supply nowadays.
Like it really, really is.
He's just such a good dude and he'll help anybody.
Anybody can, whether it's just talking to somebody
who's in a situation where they're not sure
if they're just talking to somebody
who's feeling down and out,
or if they're going through something themselves.
I know he's done a lot of charity work for others as well.
And like he even did something for me, man.
I was like, I just got out the pen,
I'm sitting in the halfway house.
And I'm back home and I'm not trying to ask anybody for shit.
Just looking to get back working and everything.
And just hits me up out of left field.
Just like, hey bro, I know how it is.
Been locked up before, I know how it is.
Right when you come home,
just thought I would just throw something together for you
and apply.
Does this whole thing and is just like,
yeah, I hear you're good.
I'm just like, you're just, man.
You're just such a good dude, man.
And yeah, he's just been having to fight with the,
you know, it's not just Lyme disease either.
A lot of people are like, oh yeah, Lyme disease is,
it's a real motherfucker.
And it is, but he's got parasites that resulted from that.
Stuff that happened to him in the hospital.
Like he even had like a form of,
I think it was form of mad cow.
He still does.
Yeah, fighting his whole body.
And you know, all that going on.
And then, you know, he's having a seizure
and wakes up to, you know, cops fucking with him and shit.
They end up whipping on him and stuff.
You know, it's just, you know, the same, man.
When it rains, it pours, you know.
And it really poured on him.
So, you know, we're coming through to help him out, man.
Cause you know, legal bills and hospital bills
is the two biggest bills there are, you know.
So yeah.
But yeah, I can't say enough good about the guy, you know.
Whole cornbread mafia and everything else.
And you know, it's just as solid as it come.
Well, you know, thank you for being here too.
And that is one of those incredible things
when people just reach out, not because they had to,
not because they felt like they should,
but because they wanted to.
And that's one of those situations where it's just,
yeah, out of left field, man.
That shows character.
So those things are cool.
Cool to hear.
Yeah, man.
All right.
Yeah, like I said, just a good, good, good solid guy.
And you know, I'm like really,
just honored to be able to call him a friend, you know.
Like I said, world's in short supply of Knicks, you know.
So yeah.
Cool.
So we're here, yep, we're here today to help him out.
And what do you got there?
Oh, I just pulled out a bunch of stuff that got sent in.
It's hard.
Yeah, no worries.
Take the time there.
But yeah, I didn't know if you wanted to say
anything as well before we get started here.
I'm sure we'll cover the rules
and how things will go down tonight,
but I appreciate your time because I know I've seen you
on here for hours doing the exact same thing
to help people out.
So we'll start off with a thank you as well.
Well, I just like Tommy was saying,
Knicks is a standup guy, you know.
And there's few and far between of those
in the community at this point, you know.
And you gotta really, Knicks old school like me, you know.
There's too many people out there
that just don't follow the code that we grew up with.
You know, like you, it didn't grow weed before it was legal,
you know, or did grow weed before it was legal.
But I will say I was always there to help my friends,
you know, and I consider Knicks one of my good friends.
And I do wanna thank everybody
for the outpouring of donations.
Without you guys, we couldn't do this
because it takes an army to fight a battle.
And with all you guys, you guys are the army.
Whether you sent something in,
whether you're in here supporting
or whether you're bidding on stuff and purchasing stuff,
thank you to everybody in attendance.
So, but I don't know how you guys want me to start this.
I have so much different stuff here.
Right, well, maybe, do you wanna give people
maybe a kind of a quick preview
of some of the lots we might see this evening
without, you know, getting detail heavy,
but an idea of what we may see coming up tonight?
Absolutely.
And in the meantime, I will let everybody know too,
I've got the Venmo, we're doing Venmo and Cash App.
Those are the easiest ways,
at Nick dash Rysden, spell it out right there.
Anytime if you guys wanna see this again,
just ask me in chat, I will put them up.
And then the Cash App, again,
don't forget that dollar sign in front.
And the numbers, these are where
we're gonna be sending money.
And just based off of the previous ones,
the sooner, the better, the faster, the quicker,
the more we appreciate it.
And these go directly to Nick.
Straight to the source,
the point of what we're trying to do tonight.
And also, if you guys do not have Venmo and Cash App,
there is a Zelle, we're not gonna broadcast that,
we'll ask for you to reach out.
Let me, I need to set up an email
specifically for all payment proof
and so on and so payment proof.
Do you understand what I'm saying right now?
Like, because I'm not sure how the direct messenger
works here on YouTube compared to like Instagram
is how I would always take care of it before.
I wanna be able to see proof of payment via email,
I guess would probably be the easiest way.
So let's do this.
And for proof of payment, so people will,
you know, will win the auction,
we'll let everybody know clearly who the winner was,
what the winning bid was,
and then we'll put up those two accounts.
They should pay immediately and then take a screenshot
to confirm payment sent to us.
And then we know you're not trolling us,
because again, if you're gonna bid multiple times
and you still haven't paid for the first one,
let us know or, you know, make the payment.
We're not gonna let things get racked up here.
But yeah, is that the best way?
Is there anything they should put in the notes
or special instructions?
Um, you know, I'd say no notes on payments
because that gets things flagged a lot of the times on those
or just put donation, that's not a bad thing.
So if they ever do look up the fact
that he's getting influx of money,
that it's all a donation, you know, so.
Perfect.
Let's see, I'm gonna create a proton mail right now.
What's an easy, I'd say,
email address.
Okay, let's see, people are asking PayPal
and direct e-transfer.
Those are things that we don't have, I believe.
PayPal's a stickler.
Yes, we do.
Yes, PayPal, we do.
I have PayPal and I will make sure all payments
get to Nick and Shannon.
But if you are going to use PayPal,
it must be friends and family, zero notes.
PayPal is like you said, a stickler.
If you do not make sure
that if you have any mention of cannabis
and any payment or note on PayPal,
they will shut your account down and seize your assets.
I've heard it happen to multiple people.
And it's not just cannabis, CBD as well, so.
Okay, so we'll get the email set up.
So if you do have any side questions like that,
you can get them directly to this dedicated email.
We'll get those answered as quickly as possible.
Our secretaries are standing by.
No.
Sorry, guys.
Yeah, no worries.
Get you guys set up.
Seeing a bunch of the familiar faces rolling through,
that's awesome.
Okay, so email is nickrisdenauction at Proton.me.
If you wanna-
Let's see, I'm putting that in the private chat.
Just make sure if you could for me,
that's spelling correct.
And then I'll put that up for everybody on the screen.
Yes.
Nickrisdenauction at Proton.me.
Okay, cool.
I will put this up on the screen for everybody.
And again, this is the direct email for auction tonight.
And if you have questions for those other payment methods,
that's where they go.
But primarily Venmo and Cash App.
Cash App.
Yeah, the only reason we say that, guys,
is because we want the money going directly to them.
I don't mind collecting it for them,
but I'd rather them just get it in their account right now,
and then it's not all back and forth
and figuring that out.
Yeah, and there's, you know, I do.
Yeah, there's fees along the way.
So yeah, going direct is always best.
Nobody likes a middleman.
Yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
So what was the best thing you had
when you were over there, man?
Best thing I had, it was the hash,
but there was one strain.
It was called super amazing.
And it actually was really super amazing.
It was proper buds.
Nice and fluffy, you know, nice consistency to it.
It wasn't, you know, Amsterdam is almost
kind of like a rec store.
I'm sure they have it, but you know,
it's not necessarily the fire.
There was a city up North called Den Helder.
It's actually, it's where they have their Naval base,
which we accidentally walked onto.
And we're told that we weren't even allowed
to be in the parking lot.
But yeah, this place called Den Helder,
there's a Topps coffee shop and they had the best buds.
And we did get a super silver haze there.
It was one of the few places we found the cheese.
But weed, I would have been happy to say I grew myself.
And that's always, you know,
when you can go somewhere else
and you're actually like buying at a store
and you'd be like, I'd be happy to have grown this.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah, they got some love, some real love put into it.
You know, that's always a good thing.
Yeah.
And it's kind of crazy there too.
Cause it's not necessarily legal
until it enters the door of the cafe.
So you still kind of have to be secretive with your growing,
even though there is like a four plant, you know,
citizen kind of tolerance,
but you're not supplying a coffee shop with four plants.
So.
Yeah, no doubt.
Yeah, maybe four and a half.
Yeah, you know, the auto, four and an auto.
No.
I can't figure out how to flip this camera, Chad.
If there, on the icon bar, you'll see settings.
It looks like a sprocket tool.
If you click that,
then you will be able to see where to switch.
Boom, front to rear right there.
And then I'll blow this screen up here
so everybody can see.
And then if you could go sideways too,
that'll make it bigger,
but this is still good if it's awkward holding that tablet.
Boom.
No, there we go.
I'll do it this way.
Yeah.
So.
Nice.
So to start off a whole lemon hoco,
there's like eight packs and there will be two bundles.
One comes with a sweatshirt.
One comes with a hat.
Another bundle is a 808 Terpscription box donated in.
There's actually two of these boxes
and I'm gonna use the one as a template for the second one.
The other one should be here on Monday.
So both of them donated from people that won them
in a raffle through Began's Beans.
Won them, send them right back.
We got a Nerds Genetics.
Let's just do it this way.
Nerds Genetics bundle.
We've got, this is a Fresh Coast bundle
and a couple of Fug Pug Pets.
We'll probably break that into two.
That was donated by Began's Beans.
We got a couple of Dogfather Seed Company packs
donated by the Dogfather.
We got some, what is that?
Strawberry Banana Milkshake.
And the name is inside here.
We'll get to that when we do.
We have a leftover from last auction.
Tom Hills Hayes F3 Cricuts and Cicada.
We have a three pack from Adam Dunn,
the Sage Mastiff Selects.
We didn't get two last time.
This is a pretty awesome pack
and very surprised somebody sent this one.
CSI Skittles as well.
That's a huge pack, y'all.
Then we got, this is gonna go into the scoops.
These are stacks of scoops over here.
I got three different things we're gonna do a scoop for.
We already talked about the Lemon Ho-Co.
Let's see, this was all,
I'm probably gonna break this into two bundles.
This was all sent in by one person.
Thank you very much.
I don't know who it was.
Oh, I do, but I don't wanna show.
Geiger.
Thank you, Geiger.
This, another bundle.
And look at this.
We got an original Dying Breed Lemon Versace pack.
We got some cult classics.
We got a bunch of stuff in here.
And then another bundle of Tiki,
Exotic, Swamp Boys, Turf Wizard, Raw.
Then what's this one right here?
Cascadian Dreams F1.
Nice.
All right.
And then we got, this was donated by Dave's Not Here.
We got Summer's End.
Nice.
This is a pack that you can no longer get.
Girl Scout Cookie by Coca-Cola Root Beer,
handwritten by Shannon.
I know that handwriting anywhere.
A couple other packs in here.
So yeah, guys, you tell me where you guys want me to start
and we'll go from there.
That's great.
Chat, we're looking at you.
So give us, toss out a couple of things
and we'll roll with that.
And that's awesome too.
Dave's Not Here, the ultimate seed collector
is making sure that they get out as well too.
So I think that's kind of cool.
He literally bought all of those in past auctions.
I was there emceeing that with somebody,
with Landrace and Dave bought most of those packs
in the auctions.
Yes.
That's why me and him do the seed collector show.
We got Dave.
Well, cool.
Yeah, let's get started.
We're gonna save that Skittles for a little bit
down the road, everybody.
I see a couple of people shouting out DDA,
Mr. Toad, the Boneyards.
What do you say, maybe we get started with that.
And how are we doing it?
What are the rules?
Let's go over this real quick before we get started.
What are the rules of engagement that you'd like to see here?
I'm gonna put a timer on it and keep it moving guys.
I'm not looking to maximize right now.
I want people to get deals too at the same time
because everybody's here trying to support.
And I'm also trying, like I said,
trying to keep this moving.
I'm gonna put a two minute timer on everything.
And then I will write closed.
My YouTube screen name is gonna be 810 Offsuit.
When you see 810 Offsuit, write closed on YouTube.
Whatever bid above that will be the winning bid
if that works for you guys.
Yep.
And just to reiterate to everybody watching on YouTube,
there is probably about a 15 second lag.
So when we get down to about 15 seconds here,
or when you're hearing that,
it's pretty much about to be closed.
So sniping is encouraged,
but don't wait to the last second
because you might be sad there is a delay.
Absolutely.
So what were you saying they wanted to start with here?
Let's see here.
It looks like we had DDA, the Boneyard Seed.
So it would look like this.
It was in the pack.
It looked like from Dave.
Looked like the pack Dave sent.
And this is, yeah,
this is one Mr. Toad sent me the other day.
I'm gonna dive into.
All right.
So let us see what's in this one.
We're gonna do packs,
like lots of at least three or more packs guys.
And that's like how we gotta do this.
Wow.
There is so much fire here from Dave's not here.
Yeah.
Oh my gosh.
That guy wipes his butt with fire.
I mean, come on.
Look at all of this.
Here we go.
Okay, there we go.
Let me blow this up for everybody watching.
I smell a key Dutch blend.
Kind of like, wow.
All right.
So.
He just won that in the auction we had last week.
And then what about this one?
Love that guy.
Gelato Cherry Limeade.
He speaks pretty highly about that Gelato Cherry Limeade,
the effect that it has on the progeny.
I know he's got a few of those
and he spoke pretty highly of that one.
So it's cool, but not surprising to see that in there.
Okay.
So let's do this three pack to start right here.
This mean, or should we break some of these
like this mean gene packs pretty rare, isn't it?
Well, that's a, that's part of the bonus.
I guess.
Absolutely.
I need to get a timer going here.
And we do because there are,
because people are so generous
and we do have a lot of things to get through.
That might be a good way to kind of let everybody
maybe get a little bit of deals.
But also we, the more that we're to get through tonight,
the more we can raise for Nick.
And that's really why we're here.
So I am not opposed to packaging things together.
All right.
Give me one second.
Yep. No worries.
We'll take this off there.
And again, after.
Three minute timer.
Three minutes is a little bit better
because you said there was that 15 second delay.
So, all right guys.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to set this up
like this and start the timer so you guys can see it.
And it shows all three packs.
Just get myself set up and running.
Yep. Okay.
You get going there.
And just so everybody knows, I've had two bids at a hundred
but we'll just highlight that one
because it's going to go higher.
So yeah, the Mean Gene, Mr. Toad
and the Cherry Limeade or Lime Pop.
Cherry Lime Pop.
It was an F2 of Mean Genes gear
made by Spring Oak Farm, Illinois.
And last auction, we did scoops of that pack
and Dave bought it and sends it right back
to have it auctioned off.
I love that guy.
Let's see here.
Dave is actually saying that that Black Dog PC
is from Bio Vortex hit with the G33 Cherry Limeade stud
which yeah, he says is just the stud of studs.
It looks like right now I see the Grow Life
with 250 as the top bid at the moment.
Oh, going in Seaside Collections is like,
I'm going after that one.
155 left on the time, but we're off to a pretty good start.
And these are going to be,
I'm curious when people are going to pop these,
if they're going to go straight into the soil,
if they're going into the vault for a little while.
That'll be a fun way to know.
All right.
All right guys, 275 we're at right now.
This pack alone right here is probably a $300 to $400 pack.
And then 280, let's keep it going guys.
This is for a great cause.
Yeah, we'll keep it going.
And if we can, we'll try to keep it to at least $10
in between bids.
But since we're getting that now,
we'll throw it up for Chris Jennings at 280.
Again, we got about a minute five left
and there is the lag.
So yeah, don't sleep too hard on this one.
See everybody coming in here.
Seaside Selections is back in the game there.
That's a dangerous tag right now.
Smiley, what you doing?
No, just joking.
Yeah.
Tagging people.
300, can we hear a 310 y'all?
Get some work from Mean Gene, get some Mr. Toad.
And the third one, was that a Mean Gene as well
or Brandon Rust?
I'm trying to...
It was a Mean Gene pack that it was F2'd from,
hunted and made by Spring Oak Farm.
Awesome.
Yeah, it's my buddy Dan.
All right, well, looks like we are getting off
to a good start here.
Jose is saying no lag.
It's coming down to the wire and...
And I'm gonna go three, two, one, close.
Just to make sure.
Okay, so let me do this for one second.
We had, leave that tag on the top
so I can write that down if you don't mind, Chad.
Yeah, got it.
I need to grab a box of sandwich bags
cause we're breaking these down into smaller bundles.
And that way I can just put the whole bundle into a bag.
That's using your head, man.
That's using your head.
No going back and watching the show
and trying to figure it out.
Which has been done many times.
So we got seaside selections.
Yep.
Fucking score, man.
Great way.
Yeah.
Way to start the night.
And guys, PayPal.
I'll send the PayPal in the private chat.
That's my PayPal.
So I can give you the address on it.
But guys, we prefer Cash App and Venmo
to tell you the honest to God truth.
Yeah.
And again, I'll put that up
and don't forget to handle your business
and then send an email just for confirmation.
Again, a screen grab will work.
No notes is necessary.
And let me put up the Cash App there.
Right.
Okay.
All right.
That's it.
Let's see what.
Okay.
Let me send the PayPal right now.
Give me one second.
Cool. Yeah.
No worries.
So Chad.
Yes.
Is that a They Live fucking hat?
It's inspired by They Live.
Yes.
That's awesome, dude.
I love that you know that too.
Yeah.
Oh, hell yeah, dude.
I love that movie.
It delivers one of the best line in cinema history.
I came here to chew gum and kick ass.
And I'm all out of gum.
I just sent that to you there, Chad.
Yep.
And next one we're gonna do guys,
we're gonna do Dutch Blooms,
Colgany, Congolese Root Beer.
Wow.
I chopped that up pretty bad.
And we're gonna do also Lime Rising Farms.
We're gonna do Summer's End.
And we're gonna do Girl Scout Cookie Coca-Cola Root Beer.
And then we're gonna do the LL Seed Company,
which is Skunk Mug, Mean Mug F2 by Roadkill Skunk.
10 piece rags.
So let's start this one off at at least 200 bucks, guys.
Yep.
And I'll be coming to your house
right after you get everything trimmed.
Not any sooner.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah, we do it like that.
Yeah, you gotta work smarter, not harder, man.
Yeah.
See this gray hair?
Yeah.
Yeah, dude, wisdom, bro, wisdom.
You want some Gandalf shit?
You heard me.
All right, Phyllis Mumford at 300.
There we go, guys.
I mean, this is easy 500 retail right here, guys.
So you guys are definitely getting a deal on this stuff.
So.
Four packs of some really, everything's fire.
That's kind of one of the crazy things about tonight.
There's not really anything that's like, yeah, that's cool.
Everything's pretty fricking, a lot of heat.
All right, so let's see.
Gary W., Phyllis, he's not playing that.
It's coming back right away.
Says 350.
That's your pay.
The Root Summers End Pack right there.
I sold out of that on the website
and I get an email a week asking if I'm restocking it
because of the pictures that are coming out now
a year later from, and that's how it always goes.
You wait it drop and then it's like,
Phyllis at 400.
All right, guys, here we go.
Yeah, Phyllis at 400.
And is there anything that you can actually tell us
about that one in particular
or some of the pictures that you're seeing?
Because you're right, it is kind of,
it takes a while before the pictures come out,
but once they do, then everybody's like,
I wish I picked that up.
Yep.
Extremely, extremely frosty, very floral smoke.
And it's got some crazy colors.
It's not as colorful as his work, Pheno,
but I mean, it is Candied Lemons by that Pam.
Anything that that Pam hit was insane.
Like it really came out good.
But I mean, don't sleep on this pack down here, guys.
This is one that sold out incredibly fast.
Like on Dutchess site,
sold out five minutes or something like that.
What a number, 420.
When Cap, he just put up a picture of the Summers Inn,
I guess he did.
Yeah, actually, good call, Tommy.
Somebody, yeah, Cap did put a picture,
LA Made did, and then Cap shared it, which is Cap.
I mean, it's just his shop in LA.
So.
Damn, that's-
All right, guys, we're getting close here.
Yep, getting down to the wire.
Gary W at 430.
Gary W, 430.
I'm all holding my breath.
Going once, going twice.
Sold.
So close.
Congratulations, Gary.
Thank you for helping out.
And like I said, I'll be there when you're done trimming.
Hell yeah, we'll be there, Gary.
We'll be there.
I'll bring the papers.
And not a day earlier.
Got lost, got lost.
Right.
Let's see, let me go up here.
We set 430 on this one?
Yep, Gary, 430.
And let me put up the cash app in Venmo once again.
And then you can put up that PayPal
because Seaside Selections, he's from Canada
and he needs that.
So let me put this out there.
International shipping, for the most part,
we will cover unless it gets ridiculous.
Going to Australia sometimes costs $60
for a little package,
depending on what part of the bush you're in.
So just keep that in mind.
We're doing a charity auction here, guys.
Like shipping comes out of the bottom line.
So we're going to ask for international.
As long as it's $20 or less, we'll cover it.
Anything over that, we ask you guys to cover.
And that's cool.
Reasonable, very reasonable.
And I tried sending something to Canada the other day
and it was just a little bit thicker than a typical letter.
And all of a sudden it went to like $24.
I said, hey, really?
Come on now.
They're just right over there.
I can see them.
I'm going to take Dutch.
We're going to do a little something
for the people here right now.
We're going to do a scoop that is called grape fundip
by Oams Law Oams Seeds.
How you're going to have to do this one though, guys,
is you're going to have to go on the site.
I'm going to add it on the site right now.
And every dollar that goes through with these
goes straight to Nick.
It's just, I believe there's almost 20 packs of this.
And to go back and forth with addresses and all that on,
I think I'm going to do these for $50 scoop guys
is what I'm going to do.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
And let me tell you the lineage on this grape fundip too.
And I'm going to just put it as scoop one on the site.
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10 grape fundip.
So there's 20 packs, which is black light fantasy.
The genetic lineage on that is Mendel perks
by purple unicorn F3 crossed into Cushman's.
So I'm going to add, give me,
I'm going to put it under lime rising farms
and the tabs as to a physical scoop one.
So it's just like a temporary thing here guys, scoop one.
And then the description is grape fundip.
$50 on the site.
On these, you guys are going to have to cover shipping
because it is such a deal on the pack.
So we're going to do $50.
And for any of you guys that don't know
the website is vegansbeans.com.
I just feel like this will be a lot easier.
Dutch gave me this heads up
than trying to chase 20 addresses for a $50 pack.
And guys, they're up.
It's scoop one, 50 bucks,
grape fundip black light fantasy by Cushman's.
So.
Is that on the Daga website?
No, but vegansbeans.com, www.vegansbeans.com.
Okay.
That way, and guys make,
you will get payment emails.
Don't just start sending $50 to Nick, please.
Not on this one.
Please do not.
The scoops I'll deal with as a whole.
Once all 20 are sold, Nick will get the thousand dollars.
It's a lot easier to do that than track the 50s.
This way tracking, it'll all be tracked through the website.
Very easy to keep track of the inventory,
so on and so forth.
Okay, great.
Fundip black light fantasy.
And again, oh, I got one more thing.
I got to put it in the Lime Rising Farms things.
So, cause they won't be able to find it otherwise.
It is under the Lime Rising Farms tab.
Sorry about that, guys.
It works out better like this though,
cause with the lag and everything too,
you get a whole lot of people trying to get it
and everything and it makes it for a big, big mess
to try to figure out everything afterwards.
Gives us a second to move on to the next thing too.
Kind of set up what we're going to be doing the next one.
And I like too that it gives people
who want to do something kind of an opportunity.
If you don't have, like me, man,
I can't be bidding on some of the upper stuff
as much as I'd like to, help a brother out.
50 bucks, man, I could swing that easily.
So, it's great to have options like that
and in quantity too.
It's 57 with shipping, but you'll get some slaps.
I'll tell you what, I'll throw a house freebie
in with all those too.
So, that covers your little $7 shipping.
You're getting a house four piece freebie or something.
All right, but that is going on right now guys,
the whole time of the live.
I'll check the number in a little bit.
If there is still a few packs left,
we'll talk about it again.
So, let's keep this moving.
I mean, that's the only way I'm going to be able
to get through all these packs.
We're going to save the Lemon Versace for a little bit.
That's kind of a bigger package there.
Okay, I think Ian, he was in here
and this is going to be 6.8.
It's okay, let's lay this stuff out.
Figure out, no problem.
So, we're going to break this down into two.
Okay.
Flora Nugs, yeah, there is a little bit of a static sound.
Might just be the Bluetooth headset,
but we're trying to work through it.
But thank you for mentioning that
because we do try to make people
turn their phone sideways here.
So, we go for the quality.
Static sound, all right.
So, this is going to be a five piece bundle.
This is donated from Geiger out of North Carolina.
Thank you, Geiger.
And here we go.
I'm going to, I got it right by the timer.
So, all we have to do, I'm getting used to this platform.
So, thank you for being patient with me.
Thank you, perfect.
So, this is going to be a bunch of 6.8.9
is the gear I'm thinking
if that's why this is written on every pack.
So, it looks like there's 12 seeds in each,
10 to 12 seeds in each.
And we got some Pine Sol OG by Glasswork OG,
Ghost OG by Glasswork OG,
Rainbow Flame 10 by Glasswork OG,
Ghost OG Lime Pop 5 by Glasswork OG.
Now, we're going to sneak this other pack in here.
Dog Leg Kush, San Fernando Valley by Sour Sis.
And this is from Green Rebel Farms.
So, let's start this one off at 100 bucks
for these five packs, which it should go for a lot more.
Steve K starting it off at 200.
Thank you, Steve.
There we go.
Five packs over 10 beans in each.
Yeah, doing, I didn't do that great in math,
but come on now.
It equals the bargain.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
And the timer starts now.
And a little bonus there.
We get Steve K, he gets the headstart.
He's out the gate with 200 for starting it off.
So, it's a good way to beat it.
I will ship to UK, guys.
I will ship to UK.
That's cool.
Now, the 689, is that company or?
I believe that's him.
He worked this gear, the guy that donated
the Dying Breed pack and a couple other packs.
And, oh, we got Family Farms in here, right on.
That's where we go, Che.
Yep, awesome.
Thank you.
That's pretty freaking awesome pedigree there.
And it looks like we still, Steve K.
At 200 bucks.
Steve K, yeah.
Guys, don't make me scroll all the way back up
and find that.
Let's get another bid.
Oh, man.
Let's see, anyone post that PayPal?
Eddie, don't wanna pants out tonight
without closing my tab.
Gary, you're a good man.
Let me put that up for you here real quick.
But we do, just FYI, Tattoo Trav 225 right now
is the current bid.
So, let me throw this back up for you here.
That PayPal again, rbchen420hotmail.com.
Again, absolutely no notes there.
Send it as a friend or family member
so there's no fees taken out.
That way the maximum amount will get to Nick.
So, thank you for that.
Let me go back to the comments and see.
We're still 225, okay.
And our buddy, 530, saying that, yeah,
the old Green Rebel was Motor Rebel's last company.
If you're not familiar with Motor Rebel,
been doing this thing forever.
Does really, really good stuff.
So, yeah, thanks for your comments.
Less than a minute, guys.
Somebody bid 250, let's go.
Yep, for five packs.
This is a steal at the moment.
And you know, that's great.
And yep, Collective Mary Jane, thank you.
Go ahead, get that scoop number one.
That's available at the bchen.com website.
And that's something that everybody could get in on.
But we've got just a couple more seconds left on this one.
20 second countdown, y'all.
And if you do want in on the scoop,
I would suggest you guys move fast
because they are, every time you hear that cha-ching,
that means somebody ordered one.
So, we got 10 seconds, y'all.
Yep, and thank you everybody for that order there.
Again, going to support a good dude.
Yep.
All right.
All right.
Going once, going twice, and sold.
There we go.
Nice.
So, that is a steal right there.
That is a steal.
And Duke told me I'm not allowed to bid on stuff.
Otherwise, I'd probably buy half of this stuff, guys.
Yeah.
Yep.
So, I'm going to write the tap to trade off,
and then I'll give them how many packs
of the other one are left,
and give them a second to go over there to,
that was 225, right?
Yeah, 225.
There we go.
I'll put it back.
He even knows what a good deal he got there.
And again, thanks for the support.
And I'm stoked that you got some goods too, man.
That's cool.
Win-win.
And that's just, that's just a good deal.
I'm not going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
I'm going to go over there.
You got some goods too, man.
That's cool.
Win-win.
And that's just, that's just it guys.
We want you guys to get some good deals too.
I'm not sitting here going,
oh, anybody wants,
once the timer's up, three seconds,
get used to it.
Unless two people are going head to head
on a super rare pack,
that's where I will make an exception.
But I'm going to try to keep this moving.
Cause at this rate,
we're going to be here for another few hours
with how many bundles I got.
So.
That's the thing.
No shortage, no shortage of beans from us.
If we could get through them all,
then that's the best thing we could possibly ask for.
So yeah, we'll keep them moving.
And actually, awesome BJen.
Oh, whoops.
I always, where's my bong?
Okay, I will put that back up.
But no, the comment I was going for was
a 689 Family Farms.
BJen, if you want any of those for me,
I got you brother.
So again, reaching out.
Thanks for being here.
Thanks for donating.
Thanks for helping.
Let's see what you just did.
Let's give you guys a number on that other pack.
And then we're going to jump right back in.
We got a three piece 689 Family Farms
with a Cult Classic pack as well.
These ones are going to be Black Lime Reserve,
Bro Cut by Glasswork OG,
Flaming Cherries number nine by Glasswork OG,
Dirty Swamp Gas by Glasswork OG.
I almost said Swamp Ass, but I did anyway.
Hey man, half the country's in a heat wave anyways.
It's entirely appropriate.
And then Clifton Aid, which is Lemon G by Tony Clifton.
So those are going to be the four piece
after I check the inventory.
The other ones here, let's see where.
Okay, and then after this, Bo Wallace just hit me up.
We got some donations from him
that I'm just going to verbalize.
I don't have the physical packs in front of me.
And he did some Black Lime Reserve F2s from Jackson's Gear,
as well as he has a couple packs
of the original packs and nine pound hammer.
So we're going to do the nine pound hammer,
the two packs and nine pound hammer and a single.
So there's 10 packs left guys.
Half of them have sold in eight minutes.
So thank you very much for the support on the $50 scoops.
So, all right, let's do this next.
Let's flip the camera.
Okay, are we doing that?
The six, eight, nine pack with, okay, yep.
Yep, the six, eight, nine pack.
And, dirty swamp gas.
You got, let me start it.
The timer has started y'all.
Okay, so I saw, let's see, where did you go?
Steve K is at the 175 on this pack here.
We're discussing a couple ones there,
but you've been here all night hanging out with us.
So yeah, just go ahead and toss that back in chat.
That is the one you're talking about.
Black lime reserve F2.
Yes, probably gonna be pretty cool.
I don't know, Duke, you could probably speak to this,
but F2s, you tend to maybe see a little bit more variety
in that.
Yeah, you really do when you S1 something or F2 something,
you really start to open up the full spectrum
or what you got in there.
And since like, when you're not dealing
with like two true breeding varieties,
and we're actually dealing with polyhybrids and everything,
you can really find some really amazing stuff
through F2 generations.
It's where really a lot of the really awesome finds
come from, at least from my own work.
When I go into an F2 generation
and start just kind of digging around,
I normally find some pretty wild stuff.
Nice.
Did anybody bid on this one yet?
Sorry to interrupt Chad and Tommy.
Not at all.
No?
I was asking just for clarification, Steve K,
you had originally thrown up 175,
but I don't wanna put that up there
just cause we were talking about a few at the moment.
So if you're still with us, I hope you would,
especially if you were bidding on it,
just let us know again in chat
that 175 is where you'd like to start this.
Otherwise we're gonna come in and gosh, that's...
We're gonna move to the next one
and bring it back up later is what we're gonna do.
Yep.
Like if I don't get a bid in 10 seconds, y'all,
I'm closing this one off
and we're gonna just start it up in a little bit.
Everybody bids right here, Captain.
There you go.
125.
Yeah, 125.
That's gonna be a steal.
Hell yeah, and not much time left.
So, oh, can't tempt the Dave.
Oh, Dave, yeah, I was gonna say, Dave won't let that go.
I mean, this pack alone should be going for 150, y'all.
And you get it.
Called classic pack along with it too, like, yeah.
Yep, okay, we got 160 there.
160 and just a couple seconds left.
Yeah.
We haven't had any snipers yet this evening.
Nope, we haven't.
Everybody's kind of in chill.
Yep.
All right, 160 going once,
160 going twice,
160, so that's wow, 85.
Okay, leave that up there so I can.
Yep.
And I will ask you,
somebody has to put the site back up
and I don't wanna just tell them
cause they'll probably spell it wrong.
Yep, let me, I'll get the site back up for you.
It's gonna cover this,
but don't worry, I can come back to this.
Go ahead, go ahead.
I got it.
So this is for the scoop packs, everybody.
Scoop number one was the $50 pack.
Description is up on the website.
It's under the tab for Nick.
So we've got that there.
Again, the preferred payment methods this evening.
We've got the Venmo.
And we've also got the Cash App.
And we do have PayPal, ask if you need that,
but those are the two preferred ones.
And again, just basically make the payment
as soon as you can.
Send an email to us at the ProtonMail right here
just with the screenshot.
And then we know that, yep, you're able to follow through.
Screenshot and shipping address.
Let's make it all in one.
So if you did the payment,
send the screenshot of the payment,
name, full name and shipping address,
especially for international.
You can't just put, John,
the package is gonna get flagged.
It's not that you can't,
but you're trying to put seeds through customs,
which a lot of countries don't think too highly of.
Although they're legal hemp seeds,
certain countries just don't think too highly of that, guys.
So just keep that in mind.
I live in a small town and the post office
won't let you send something without like a full name
or your return address on it.
So that's interesting.
But yeah.
Spud Shady, the grape fund dip was made by Ohms Law,
Ohms C.
Yep, and I've seen Ohms Law in here in chat as well.
They're participating tonight.
So that's cool.
There we go, Ohms Law right there.
Oh, that looks like the mind blown.
He must've just watched that pack go.
Oh, everybody did.
They're like, I can't believe I just let that go past me
for nothing, for $160 for four packs of seeds.
Buy a cult classic and get three packs free.
Yeah, and you guys too, there's, you know,
it's rad to see the support.
We got a lot of people watching.
Please reach out on, you know, Instagram, Facebook,
social media, email, send a smoke signal.
People know what we're doing.
And honestly, the kind of deals that are up,
you saw how many seeds we have
and we wanna get rid of them all.
And we don't wanna be here all night, so.
No, that's why we're moving them fast, y'all.
But the auctions too, it's not, you know,
you don't always see the one pack go for $2 billion.
You also, you see a lot of good things come out.
That's the cool thing about auctions.
People get some excellent deals
and then sometimes you see guys
get ready to shank each other up
over getting in on that one pack.
So they're always pretty cool.
But just remember, for a good cause,
it's not for like, you know,
I just sell them the stuff to just make some money and shit
and go, you know, go party it up, you know.
Hookers and blow!
No.
This is going to-
All right, I gotta go, guys.
Yeah.
Packs are sold out, no.
Absolutely not.
And again, that's why we like the Venmo and the Cash App
because it goes directly to Nick,
which is why we're doing it.
So, real quick, Flora, I can see your comments today.
Sometimes small town, sometimes...
I lived on Capitol Hill in the 2000s, man.
That was fun.
That was Seattle.
In the WTO, I ate the tear gas.
That was interesting.
That was fun, man.
Let me medicate real quick, guys,
and then keep it moving.
I'll do a quick dab so I'm not popping on a joint.
And I did realize,
I realized then that they do have two kinds of tear gas.
One that's just going to burn your eyes
and the other that's going to make you puke.
Yeah, yeah.
You got CS is the one, you know?
And yeah, that's what they gas you out
on the prison rides with,
have you puking and dying, you know?
Hell no.
Yeah, I had a small taste of that
and I was like, fuck, no thanks.
I even had a gas mask too.
I tossed that in my backpack and went up.
So, I'm living on Capitol Hill.
It's a small area.
Everybody probably remembers it more recently
from the recent protests
and the autonomous zone or whatever that was up there.
But I'm watching the 11 o'clock news,
hearing everything outside the apartment.
They start closing in on the police station
and I'm like, I got to see this.
Yeah, yeah, you got to.
I got to see this, man.
Toss a gas mask.
That is like, you know,
so like when they fit test you for those,
if you have a beard like we do,
they do not work very good.
It's just going to come seeping in
and it makes it worse even.
The best thing you can do, man,
always bring like an extra t-shirt
or something you can wet down real good
and tie it over your face, you know?
And that'll help you out a lot.
And just breathe shallow, you know?
There was definitely an experienced person there
because I didn't get the mask on quick enough
and they obviously saw me
and that's exactly what they did.
They were just like, oh boy, okay,
this is what you need to do.
I'm like, thank you.
Thanks.
It was good.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, it really gets you, man.
And once you got a good one full out shirt,
it's basically game over after that.
Yeah.
All right, guys.
Good times.
I think what we're going to do next,
because I just got reminded by Lefty Farms in here,
he wanted to donate,
and this is not something I have physical,
so I just wrote it down on a sticky note.
What he is donating now is a original Virginia Beach cut.
Afghani.
Yes.
Afghani cut.
Okay, so we've got to start this one off at at least 300.
Last one we sold, sold for I believe six or 700 last auction.
So this auction right here,
so it'd be three minutes,
is going to be a cut of the Virginia Beach Afghani
from Lefty's Farm, and it will get shipped out.
So this is the current auction, guys.
Yeah, and this is something I can actually speak on.
Big, hefty yielding plant.
Very, very, very extremely piney.
Buried underneath all the pine,
you get this weird type of,
that Jack Durbin sandalwood type smell underneath that pine.
Super, super sticky bud.
It's that very greasy resin
that's reminiscent of pine tar.
The effect on it, it's very overwhelming.
Heavy paranoid at first.
Back in the day, we used to have people white out
on the shit all the time.
After that overwhelming fucking just wave of it,
it just turns you into jello.
You're stuck.
Very, very extremely narcotic.
Like I said, it yields very well.
The one thing about it is it doesn't like
the super, super intense light.
So whoever wins, you wanna keep the lights
tuned down a little bit.
It typically was liking it around 700 U mole,
which is definitely up there where you want it.
But some people that were trying to crank it up past that
for some of that real high intensity stuff,
it doesn't really dig that so much.
Yeah, it's a great one.
Used it for breeding.
Used it for a lot of smoking
and a lot of cash cropping back in the early 2000s.
Just fantastic stuff.
Get into it now.
I'll say this, Bulldog Ken,
if that's the same bulldog that's always in the auctions
on Instagram, you guys,
you're not gonna win it from Bulldog Ken
and I challenge you to have that auction battle.
All right?
If he wants this cut, you're not gonna get it.
Okay, and it looks like he wants it
from the comments I'm watching down here.
Bulldog's got a tight grip on things.
Oh, absolutely.
And he has been a supporter since auction number one,
helped with Canada Research auction
when he lost his significant other, Gloria,
the mother of his three children.
He was one of the main supporters over there as well.
So gratitude 750, LOL.
Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm like hesitant to put that up there
but the LOL guys, gratitude, please confirm that bid
or tell us we're silly, please.
I think it's legit.
Cause he did, there's Bulldog Ken at 900.
So like he'll just up your 150 and say, okay,
you wanna play?
Like, this is how I remember.
So.
Do you hear that sound?
That's it hitting the table guys.
Oh yeah.
So, yeah.
It just got laid on the table.
And I don't mean to call you out like that Bulldog
but if you're the same Bulldog, Bulldog, IKR on ID
I'll follow him, great people.
But we're on the wind down.
We got going once, going twice, sold the Bulldog Ken
for 900 and you guys do see the 810 offsuit closed, correct?
Yep.
And don't worry a Bulldog, like it might be 900 right now
but on your first grow, grandma will pay you back and some.
That's love how it all works, works in the end, man.
Big picture.
Oh yeah.
You know what, Bulldog?
You're a good dude.
He's gonna round it up to a thousand.
All right.
That's what I'm saying, dude.
Hey Bulldog, don't go nowhere too far.
I know you love your cuts.
And if I think I'm gonna talk Tommy
and since we're on the cut thing right now
let's talk Tommy into doing a screaming eagle cut.
We got 272, not right now?
Okay.
No, right now.
Cause like I'm budging up a big ass mom of it.
I wanna have it like rooted and ready to go.
There's also a spot that's not too far from me.
I wanna, cause like I see like people bringing up
and like rightly so, like it's a weird world out there.
There's a spot up the street that a test stuff
for a hoplite and for 20 bucks, you know
that way I can have it tested for that
and all this other stuff and have a piece of paperwork
that'll go right there, right there with it.
You know what I mean?
So when I do that and I'll probably also
cause there's gonna be a lot of people wanting them.
I'm probably gonna do more than one as well.
So we'll get back to it.
We'll get back to it for sure.
All right.
Well then we'll just move right into the next auction
cause that's what we're gonna do to keep this moving.
This is, this was sent in by Adam Dunn
but there was a big bag with like 30 packs in here.
So I just grabbed a few packs out of that.
So this is gonna be another four piece bundle.
The Adam Dunn pack alone, Sage master select.
It's got three packs in it.
It's got 93 master Kush by Sage,
T Sage by Sage BX, which is Tim A pack two
and pack three is Zetage, which is Zeta by Sage.
If I am butchering these guys,
it's cause I haven't read every screen
and I don't know them all.
Adam likes making names.
Yeah.
Adam's creative with his names too.
So you never know.
I love the packaging though.
Absolutely.
The next one we got, this is from Grateful Grower,
Tag Along, Scout's Honor by Skittles BX.
We got Hazy Bulldog Farms, clean green certified.
And this is gonna be Cherry Chem, Indica dominant seeds.
That's all, Cherry Pie by Chemdog is the lineage on it.
And then looks like a freebie pack from Turpey Seeds,
which is Sin City Seeds, Dosey Mints.
You know what, since it's like that,
let's grab another freebie pack and round this up.
Here we go.
We got Mint Chocolate Chip BX, Freebie Love by Honest Herbal.
So this will be for all five packs.
And we'll get it going here.
The timer is going y'all.
You saw what it was and I'll just flip it in a second.
Okay, trying to load up some pictures on my end here.
Oh, there we go.
Okay, all those packs.
Let me load up one more picture here
and I'll flip over to the comments and see what we've got.
Looks like we've got Collective Mary Jane,
getting it rolling at $300.
Thank you for the bid there.
Yep, great bid.
This is like a, this right here,
I mean, these are all the freebies that come with it,
I feel like, because this is the rare gem right here, guys.
And shout out to little Adam Dunn, man.
Like he came through, like that comes like,
that's not like, that's straight from Dunn himself, man.
So really cool of him.
And also a trivia question.
Does anybody know what SAGE stands for?
Oh, I've heard it, but-
I do, I do, I remember.
That's see, that's the names.
Well, we'll, if, yeah.
It's SAGE.
It is Sativa Afghani Genetic Equilibrium.
Wow, that's a good mouthful there.
Yeah.
You got so much information.
Only about certain things.
Yeah, rotten skateboards, yep.
Yeah, see that dude, there was,
yeah, there was a crowd out there.
They're all coming through the chat now.
Nice, yep.
Yep, yep, good stuff, y'all, good stuff.
Okay.
And we still got, let's see,
we go back to Mary Jane,
Collective Mary Jane, still at 300.
We're gonna go steel on this.
So when, shit, that tape pack alone, man, I love that.
That's, that's-
And it comes with some slaps too.
It's got the slaps too, so SAGE Master Selects.
Yeah, man, he's a cool, he's a cool dude.
Especially like you were talking about Amsterdam
and everything, I always think about him,
like he's moving from Ohio over there
and then just getting it done for all them years.
It's pretty cool.
Yeah, and then, you know,
it's like I listened to his show for a long time,
back to the, you know, the Mitch Sanassa days,
but he'd always talk about Amsterdam
and he'd always say, you know, don't go to Katsu.
They hate tourists at Katsu.
If you're American, don't ever go to Katsu.
That's the best fucking place to go.
I'm sorry, man, he was trying to,
he's selling wolf tickets on that one.
I was seriously afraid to like go in there,
but it was classic, so I had to.
Let me get, I'm sorry, to the bids.
Going once.
Nice, here we go.
This is gonna be the steal of the night, yo.
Yep.
Going once.
Going twice.
Close.
Whoa, Rick.
Whoa, Rick.
Oh, real Rick?
Who is Rick?
Do we know if Rick is a troll or not?
Rick. Rick, that is a legit bid.
Because we would appreciate that.
We'll assume Collective Mary Jane.
I'm thinking Rick, I think it's my buddy Rico,
AKA Jody, but yeah, let me know.
Let me know, man.
You know my digits.
He texts me like last time.
He came through on the last one.
He was in before the close,
so if you're really serious about it,
send that text, I guess.
Because, dude, we'd love it.
While we're waiting for that, I'll leave this up.
But speaking of Amsterdam, my travels, and TH Seeds,
I found this 2004 TH Seeds poster
hanging up in one of the head shops.
It's got the girls and the buds.
And then these seeds, man.
Like, oh, I wish you could read them right now.
But these seriously are probably like 14-year-old seed packs
in there in the store.
I was like, holy shit.
And I was always looking for the Puna Butter from him.
It wasn't there.
If it was there, I would have bought it
and tried it anyways, though.
All right, I think we're gonna go ahead
and give this to Collective Mary Jane,
because Rick hasn't said nothing.
If it is Rico, Rico can come in on a different auction.
There's plenty of other stuff here for him.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't think it might.
It might not be him.
I don't think it is, honestly.
I think we're gonna go with Collective Mary Jane.
What a steal.
Good job.
Thank you again for the support.
And that was 300.
Yep.
Let me write that down.
Yep, do that.
And you know, again, everybody, thanks for hanging out.
Let your friends know that we're all hanging out
and we're all trying to do a good thing
for a community member and get out some fire genetics
that aren't available anymore,
some that are really hard to get.
And yeah, some things that people have started
their own companies from.
Yeah, true that, true that, man.
Hey, did you like Cali Mist back in the day?
Smoked some of it.
I've never grown it.
It was good.
Yeah.
Fucking gritty up some F3s of it.
I'm gonna probably get into it here soon.
Nice.
Sage and Sour was one that I did get from him
that I liked and that I worked with.
And you know, I have my own offspring of that here
that's, you know, it's just for me,
but yeah, that Sage and Sour, man, I dug that one.
We're gonna move right into this bundle right here.
Okay.
Two packs of 20-20 Mendocino.
Boom.
I'm just looking at the comments.
Is there any way to remove the trolls, that Rick guy?
Let me ask that so he doesn't try to do that stuff again.
Don't move him because he never responded to anything.
So that's gotta lead me to believe that he's a troll.
And I don't want a troll to come in here
and just start bidding people off
to tell you the honest to God truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, that's fucking, come on,
especially with what we're trying to do.
So yeah, none of that.
It's a charity auction.
Come on, guys.
If you're really determined,
that determines to spend that money, Rick.
You just got blocked, make a new account,
and we'll feel better.
Yep.
All right, so.
And again, that's, yeah.
We're gonna have two packs of 20-20 Mendocino,
genetic, 20-20 genetics, Mendo cookies, glue snipper.
And these are full packs, 12 regular seeds in each.
I got you, Bo.
We'll do that after this one right here.
Cause I said that 13, or the 12 pound hammer.
You know what?
I'm gonna just do a nice bundle right here.
Hey, can y'all put up Gary W.
Was wondering how to pay.
Said shoot me an email, and I'll gladly take care of my tab.
Okay, Gary, let's get you hooked up.
Thank you very much for asking.
This is the dedicated auction email for the evening.
So you can send anything direct.
We're gonna get that instantly over on that end.
We'll be able to respond to you there.
And then just to recap for everybody,
and thanks for seeing that in there, Duke.
I did not catch that.
Yeah, just to recap here, Venmo is right there.
And Cash App are the preferred methods.
We do also have a PayPal.
If you need that, let us know.
And then the ScootPaks too.
There might only be a couple left at this point
of the Scoop number one,
but those are over on the vegansbeans.com.
Vegansbeans.com.
Vegans beans, sorry.
No, it's all good.
So I'm just breaking this into a couple different
packages here.
I'm gonna break this into two packages.
First one's gonna be the 2020 Mendocino.
Looks like I got Warped Genetics,
Banana Pudding Tang by Goji OG, 12 regular seeds.
Warped Genetics, Bebop, Space Monkey by Goji OG,
Bread by 42, Mac F2,
Johnny Appleseeds Mac F3.
And this looks like Baller Billy Seeds,
Coffee Star 12 pack, Coffee Cookies by Starbit.
So this is gonna be a decent little bundle here, guys.
We got one, two, three,
which actually I need to open that
because that shows both packs.
Lay it down.
And just to kind of assume too,
I know you called out that there's the 12 pack in there.
Unless you say something different,
or is it safe to assume all of these are 10 packs?
No, because they're from so many different people.
Okay, everybody does something different.
Exactly, like this Bread by 42,
I'm pretty sure this is a freebie pack.
I'm gonna open it right on the live,
and there might only be three seeds in this right here.
So, yeah, exactly.
It was a freebie pack,
and there was three seeds inside of it.
But most of the other ones are full packs.
So when I see it's like a tester or a freebie,
I try to announce that.
And just know guys, when seed banks are giving away freebies,
it's anywhere from two to four seeds typically.
So if they're saying a freebie, it's a two to four piece.
And that's why I kind of put the Mac F3
right with this one right here.
So you had both Mac packs right here.
All right, let's do this.
Then we got the next bundle is some Miss Jill Genetics
and KDS seeds and a Greenline pack.
So let's start this one up.
Rotten Skateboards already did it, 200.
All right, Rotten.
And they're right here.
The names are on the top of these.
So, Mendo Cookies.
That's an attractive looking pack there.
I like that.
It really is.
And then it's got the front see-through,
kind of like to see the quality of the seeds
at the same time.
I like it and I don't,
because you have to make sure
that doesn't get exposed to light for too long.
I mean, you don't wanna just sit and know.
But it is nice to know the quality of seeds you're getting.
I'm just picturing all the dispensary weeds
sitting under those neon lights in the hot display case.
Oh, cooking.
Yeah, just getting sun bleached.
Let's see, we're trying to go up by $10 increments, Steve.
Can you throw 210 at us?
Yeah, throw another Lincoln log on there, man.
210, 210, Ty Guy Grills.
Hi, gotcha.
Seven packs, y'all, for $210.
That's $30 a pack.
Holy shit.
$30 a pack, guys.
That's a lot of weight.
Yeah, some what you're getting.
Yeah, this is the gift that keeps on giving.
That's one thing I love about seeds.
Regardless of what you pay for them,
if you like them and you keep growing them,
they pay for themselves.
They really do, man.
And they're a good gift too,
because if you got a crew of dudes
that you hang out with around the way, man.
Yeah, I mean, even if they're not local
and you got your internet friends,
man, everybody can hunt something out,
find the bangers, swap out the clones,
and you can really get some cool shit going that way.
Yes, Jay, I'll address that after this one.
We'll go through it.
I'll have them put the three different payment options up
and then the email for payments as well.
Just make sure, you guys.
Yep, get that up here.
We've got a minute left on this one.
I'll let that expire here.
I don't wanna miss any bids at the last minute.
Adrian Hotree, $250 right now, is the leading bid.
So seven packs, $250, little over $30 per pack.
And yeah, there's only so many chances in a year.
So it is great when you have some buddies
that you can get these out to.
And then everybody comes back
and you all save each other about four or five years
by all just growing it out together.
Oh yeah, I'll let y'all know.
My boy hit me up, that Rick, that was him.
He was trying to bid on the VBF GANY,
but he was just so lagged out.
So the bid was for the GANY claimed like minutes before.
Well, okay, I'm good.
Sorry to block you, Rick.
Maybe Peter-
Going once, going twice, gone.
Wow.
Damn, Adrian Hotree.
I think that might've been another steal of the night there.
Oh, camera's blocked right there.
Let's grab a bag and put these all in the bag
and leave that up for me for a second.
Yep, there we go, we've got that.
And then after he's writing this down, Jay,
I will definitely post the payment information
after every auction and run through the process
for the email.
Yeah, easy enough, I could do that.
Okay, see Peter to the rescue.
Rick, I think you're unblocked at this moment.
That is why he is the Lord and Savior, Mr. Long Pipes.
Can I ask, is Lefty still in here?
Lefty, would you be willing to allow Rico
to get in on a cut for $1,000?
Would you be willing to donate too?
Got that, so Lefty, that question's up to you.
Jay, let's get to this here.
Again, the two preferred ones, Venmo is what we're starting.
Cash App is the other preferred payment method.
Again, guys, you don't need to leave any notes in here.
If you have a question, direct email
for this particular auction.
You can hit it up, nickerizedinauctionatproton.me.
And the PayPal, should that be what you need, is this.
But again, absolutely no notes on that one.
And do make sure to send it as friends and family
so there is no fees taken out of the payments.
And again, international, we are welcome to do Canada, UK.
But if the shipping gets wild, something over 20 bucks,
we'll ask that maybe you help contribute
a little bit towards that.
But as far as everybody domestically,
thank you and we got you.
Let me ask this.
Rick, you want another one?
Because Lefty said he just sent you one last auction,
is what I'm reading in the comments here.
It's probably getting lonely.
It's probably getting lonely, you need to.
Let's look at the inventory of that last scoop
and then we're gonna do Bo Wallace.
We're gonna do two nine pound hammer packs.
Let's write it down.
Appreciate you Rico.
You know what, we'll get you straight.
We'll get you straight regardless, bud.
And these are the original,
these are some of the original packs
of the nine pound hammer.
Jinx proof.
Oh yeah, it's good shit right there.
Big Blazer 80, what's left to go up?
Holy cow, we got a whole bunch left.
We got some Lemon Hoko, some 808 Genetics.
We've got a bunch of grab bag stuff
and we're trying to rapid fire through them.
So again, everybody sit tight, hang on and pay attention.
We're gonna do this one.
Two packs of nine pound hammer started off at a hundred bucks.
Let's go guys.
I don't have the packs physically.
So I'm just gonna have to write this down.
And then next up after that
is a pack of Black Lime Reserve F2 created by Bo Wallace.
So.
Nice.
Good to see you, Mr. Chris Guerrero.
Thanks for hopping in here tonight, buddy.
I'm glad you recovered
from your edible experience yesterday.
We're all rooting for you.
Okay, Rick has been unbanned and he's getting in on this.
He's starting it off at 500.
Two packs, nine pound hammer, Jinx Proof Genetics.
This is, I wanna call it a classic.
Classic is all subjective
because it depends on how old you are.
But this is a solid staple in many people's,
I'm an old DJ and this would be one
that didn't leave my record box.
So yeah.
Solid shit here.
And let's see here.
Rick's at 500, guys.
Yep.
Rick's starting it big.
We did get some other bids.
We got some normal, good starting bids,
but we jumped the shark.
Hell yeah.
So I'm just gonna,
so I'm just gonna call this at 500.
I don't think anybody's gonna mess with,
we're gonna keep this moving.
Rico, 500.
And that's just, I think,
what we're gonna have to do on some of these here.
Just if it gets like that,
I know nobody else is coming close.
And if they are, 500, what a joke.
Rob, I'm sorry you feel that way,
but this is a charity auction and Rico's legit.
Because Rico donated $4,000 last auction.
So I mean, the joke is that you're unaccepting
of somebody supporting somebody in need.
So take your negativity somewhere else, please,
and thank you.
The final price does not always reflect the merchandise.
The greater cause going on here.
Yeah, I used to drive $100 tips for Denny's,
Denny's waitresses in the middle of the night
when I'd be on road trips.
Nice.
And doing things and shit.
Yeah, it's like, it is.
You know?
All right, next bundle.
Go ahead, I'm sorry.
No, go ahead, please, go ahead.
I'm just gonna keep it moving.
I got three packs of Miss Jill,
including one pack of Jilly Bean.
I got Green Line Pine Nut.
I got straight A, Mike over at Straight A Genetics.
Dosey Chunk, which is Dosey Dose by Blue Chunk.
And three packs of KDS Seeds,
Pink Scream, K-Dog, and Super Silver Grape.
Hold up.
This will keep you busy for an entire season.
Yup, this is gonna be a three, four, five, six, seven,
eight piece bundle.
Call up KFC, we're stealing their gig.
The fuck?
Eight piece bundle, guys.
125, Steve K.
Starting it up.
We'll do the Black Lime Reserve F2 next.
My apologies, guys.
I already started this one,
so I'm gonna write out BLR, and here we go.
We're just gonna start it.
And I'm gonna write that note on a sticky note.
Because when I don't have them physically
in front of me, guys, it's hard.
All right, getting some traction on this one.
Looks like a couple people are in it.
In it to win it here.
So that's nice to see.
250, Dave's not here.
He knows, so let me come in on these.
Brian Berry Lemon Lime, Grape Lime Ricky by Brian Berry.
Jilly Bean, Open Pollination.
Purple Afghani by Space Queen Tester.
Wow.
Green Lime Pine Nut.
This is the straight A Dosey Chunk.
And then this KDS, is that what that is?
Is that KDS?
I think that is, or EDS?
That's not an E.
I think that's a K.
Ken Dog Seeds, is that it?
My old English is not good anymore.
No, it's very hard to determine certain letters.
Looks like a KDS.
Yeah, I can speak on the Jilly Bean.
Like, we grew those out right when they first came out
way, way back when.
Friend of mine found the candy shop, you know.
That F2 would be a good-ass place to be looking in
and to find in that.
And that was some of the best fucking shit, man.
Orange Velvet by Space Queen.
It was really good, super frosty stuff.
And like, it was literally like walking into a candy shop.
Like, every candy on earth, like,
represented into this one funk.
And it had the taste.
All of these are regs, guys.
All of these are regs, I believe.
Sorry, Tommy, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm trying.
Oh, no, no, no, you're cool, man, you're cool.
I was just reminiscing about growing Jilly Bean,
2004, whenever it was.
Now, was that one of the first ones
that you kind of had or tasted with that profile?
Because that's pretty early
for something with that profile.
Yeah, it was pretty mind-blowing,
especially back then.
The friend that popped it,
I got to see like some pictures of it.
It was like blowing away just by how it looked.
And then we all met up at Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee,
and she had some pounds of it with her.
And I was like, holy shit.
And gave me a clone and everything.
And then I started growing it
and grew it all the way until I got locked up.
Wow, it's a keeper, man.
That's nice.
Very much so, yeah.
Steel of the century right here, guys.
Going once, going twice.
Wasn't this like a eight-pack?
Sold, eight-pack for $300.
Bam, James, do you come to a gratitude?
I hope you're saying, I'm going to Disneyland.
Go play the lotto.
I'm going to Disneyland.
Remember that old song?
I forgot who did it.
It wasn't refreshments, it was shit.
Was it like Lottie or something like that?
I'm going to Disneyland song.
Oh, shoot, I don't even know.
I'm just picturing all the people winning the Super Bowl
or you just won the World Series
and the guy runs up to you with the microphone.
What are you gonna do next?
I'm going to Disneyland.
Where's my check?
Yeah, man.
I wish I could remember.
Yeah, it was an old 90s song.
He talking about sticking up a bank and stuff
and going to Disneyland.
Shit.
You know, somewhere, somehow,
there probably is a person who has done that.
They stop at 7-Eleven, they go to Disneyland, man.
I just want to thank you guys.
We've worked through some stuff still,
but we still got a lot more to go.
And now we're gonna go with, before I forget again,
and this is why I had a Post-it note right in front of me,
we're gonna go up one pack of Black Lime Reserve F2
hunted by Bo Wallace.
I don't know if you guys knew this, know about Bo Wallace,
but Bo Wallace is an OG.
He used to do a lot of work with Sub Cool.
He's definitely been working these Black Lime Reserve F2s
for about three years now, growing them in his own garden.
Very stable.
Last time we sold these packs,
they went for six, 700 a pack, I want to say, on Instagram.
He let go of two of them.
Think he said he'd let go two more tonight,
but we got to space them out.
We'll do one now, some more bundles,
and then come back to it.
So I see Big Blazer is going at 200,
and he knows what's up.
That's the way to start it.
So we're gonna start it up.
Black Lime Reserve F2 at Bo Wallace.
Any questions at all, reach out.
Why is this not starting?
There we go.
Yes, oh noes.
Love that one.
So woke, let's try to go.
We're trying to go $10 increments if we can,
but Seaside Selections already beat you to the punch there.
250 from Seaside Selections is what I'm seeing right now.
And again, we were talking earlier, F2 generation.
If you think the Black Lime Reserve is a winner,
take a peek into its history with that F2 generation.
Big Blazer coming back.
He's yeah, he recognizes something that he wants there.
And again, we do do the shipping.
And thank you, Woke News came in with $10 higher.
So 285 to Woke News at the moment.
It's good stuff.
And that song was written by Dada.
I think it was D-A-D-A.
Yeah.
Yeah, dude.
Some of those like wormholes on YouTube I'll get into
as far as yesterday, it was a smooth
and hard 90s hip hop East Coast mix.
And I forgot how many jams there were, man.
I was like, oh, oh, yeah.
Whole mix.
I think after this, what do you guys wanna put up?
You guys wanna put up a pack of the dying breed pack?
Go ahead.
Yeah, well, I got, so I got my buddy just hit me up
and he's like, hey man, I wanna put something in
to shake it up, man.
It's a bundle.
He got Skunk91 F2s from Bodie, a pack of my Dominion G,
which was the capital G Dominion Skunk.
Chem 101 from Crickets and Cicada Seeds,
Dirty Taxi from Top Dog Seeds
and Sour Diesel BX4 by Top Dog Seeds.
Yeah, I'll write them all down.
I know you're busy.
Oh, all right, cool.
Yeah, you can do it.
Yeah.
That's fine.
I have the post-its right here, so it just works like this.
So if I don't have the packs.
There you go.
I know what it is.
Big Blazer's about to steal this, y'all.
13 regs, if this was on IG,
cause we know what it is, this would be going for five.
Dude, it started off at 500, I think, last time.
Yeah, and then I see people-
310 Woke News.
Tommy, go 320.
320 is the next up bid.
Woke News at 310.
350, Tommy Tricombe's coming in hot.
350.
350 in a freestyle.
350 in a freestyle.
He knows what I'm talking about.
Tommy's awesome.
Yes, he is.
I've worked out on the farm,
Nick's farm with him a few times, met him out there.
All right, guys, going once.
Going twice.
So.
Boom, there we go.
Yes, and then a shout out to Tommy Tricombe's too.
That man has sent me free beans,
which I really freaking loved as well.
So he's hooking it up all over the place, left and right.
So good on you, Tommy.
Let me put up the payments for you.
Again, the two preferred, we got Venmo there.
And Tommy, I'm sure you can just physically
get those from Bo.
And this is what kind of guy Tommy is.
He came in here, he could have probably reached out to Bo
and told Bo, hey, I want to grow these.
Bo would have given him a breeder pack of the shit, okay?
Cause they know each other.
And then Tommy was in here last week
and put a six, seven pack bundle together
for the auction as well.
So before we do this huge bundle,
let me write down what it is again.
Tommy, the one that your buddy just reached out.
We'll start with pack number one.
Let's see here.
I see Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.
I'm getting corrected here.
Bernie Hurtwick came in at the last moment.
Is it above the closed or below?
It's one above.
On my end it shows below.
Okay, yeah, see that's the crazy thing
about when we do it live.
Sometimes it comes below, sometimes it comes before.
It depends on whose screen you're looking at.
Can we maybe add 45 seconds to the clock?
On the timer, so like 345?
Or no, just 45 seconds left because it's,
we called it for Tommy, but it looks like it came in.
Dude, I wanted to bid on this bundle.
Shit, now I don't know what to do.
Tom, Tommy says let him have it.
Okay, so it's for a good cause.
Now let's ask.
Do you still, but I wanna know that,
Bernie, are you legit?
Bernie Hurtwick, are you legit?
Because I haven't seen you bid at all tonight.
And oh, I got a perfect.
I'm glad you have me have this thing sideways
because it needs to get on the charger immediately.
It just gave me a 5% warning.
But Bernie, you're just jumping in the room.
You're not familiar.
I wanna know you're legit.
And guys, one other thing too.
I'm not gonna get to these emails till tomorrow evening.
Okay, after 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
I'm not gonna be able to go and respond to anybody
until then.
I work a day job that I work in like seven hours,
or I have to be up in seven hours.
And I'll be here for another two at least.
So please be patient with me in responding to everybody.
I will ask that right now.
And that the email that Chad just put up
is where all screenshots of payments go,
as well as name and shipping address
that we are getting these to.
So Dave, he legit.
If he says to verify with Dave, I believe him.
So why don't we put his name up there
and I'll write that down real quick.
Okay, yeah, he says, hey Dave, tell him.
Yeah, let me go.
So it was a 420 bid.
That was a classic bid right there.
Nope, no problem Bernie.
420.
We've been trolled with these, which is unbelievable.
So we wanna make sure, you know, I mean,
I'd rather ask twice than chase money down for a week
to not to get ghosted, you know.
I'd rather take the extra minute right now.
Beautiful, I got Bernie at 420 on the first pack
of Black Lime Reserve from Bo.
Now, Duke, Tommy, tell me what these five packs are.
We'll go from there.
All right, you got Top Dog Seeds, Dirty Taxi.
That is GMO by the Kim D I-95.
That's 12 seeds.
Then you got-
What else are we?
Top Dog Sour.
Sour Diesel, Bat Cross number four.
That's 12 seeds as well.
They're both regulars.
And you said a few other packs there too.
Oh yeah, yeah.
You got Crickets and Cicadas from Bob and Hannah.
Kim 101.
That's Kim 91 by the M10.
Give me one second.
Oh, you're good, you're good.
Crickets and Cicada.
And what's the name of the pack?
Kim 101.
That's Kim 91 by the M10.
That is a Danny, if I'm not mistaken,
from the whole catalog.
Then you got Skunk 91, which is a-
Is that Crickets and Cicada?
No, sir, that is a F2 from some of Bodie Scott.
And, and, but wait, there's more.
You got a pack of Dominion Seed Company, Dominion G.
That was my Cap G by Dominion Skunk.
And last but not least,
you got Stray Fox Circle of Blessings, Black Afghan.
Now I will say this as well,
in that Skunk 91 F2,
there's well over 75 seeds in that pack.
So you are getting what we used to call a baller pack,
friends and family plan, whatever you want to call it,
plenty enough to go around and share to your nearest.
I mean, these guys all know what it is.
So I'm going to put down Duke's Bundle.
Yeah, Duke's Bundle right now is already 560
to Justin R.
Got some serious bidders in here.
Seaside Selections is not playing that $10 per game.
He's going straight to 600.
Round numbers.
I started to write it all down, but I couldn't catch up.
Dominion G, they all wanted a bid,
so we're going to keep it moving.
Top Dog, Dirty Taxi, Sour Diesel, Crickets and Cicada,
Chem 101, Skunk 91 F2 by Bodie,
Dominion G by Duke Diamond.
I didn't get the last one.
I was Circle of Blessings, Black Afghan.
Okay, there it is.
You know, someone grabbed this.
Yeah, that's a whole hell of a lot of seeds.
So make sure you get after that.
You only got like, what, two minutes?
So instead of doing the old asking for extra time,
get it in while you have the time allotted.
And then next, you know, I've heard everybody asking
about the Lemon Hoko box.
Dave, is Dave still in here?
Dave's not here.
Yeah, Dave's still in here,
and they were, the Lemon Hoko stuff,
we had a couple of people asking for that next,
so maybe we can move that one towards the top of the list.
I know we had some cool package deals
with the Lemon Hoko stuff.
Yes, sir.
And you know what?
We're moving through this stuff pretty quick, guys.
I'm gonna say we're probably halfway through the donations
that I wanted to get through.
Awesome.
You know, and that's pretty amazing.
So thank you guys again.
Justin R, 720.
Come on, who's gonna slap it on the table and say 1,000?
Come on, because this is worth 1,000, y'all.
Yes.
Just on those buddy F2s,
you got like 75 beans or more in that.
Damn.
The Stunk 91?
Bro.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's quite a bit, and the Dirty Taxi
and the Sour Diesel back cross four from Top Dog,
that's pretty gnarly.
I'm pretty sure those Sours are sold out everywhere.
Chem 101, that was old school.
Cricket, cicada deal, real bad ass stuff.
So yeah.
You got some-
750 for Dave's not here.
I see, sorry.
Yeah.
All right, guys, get ready,
because I'm doing the going once, going twice.
760, Woke News.
1,000, give it to Tommy.
There he goes.
Going once, going twice, sold.
Rico, 1,000.
Rico, is that a legit bid?
1,000.
Give me a thumbs up.
I know it is, but I'm pretty sure you're bidding
to give it to Tommy for $1,000, which is just incredible.
What's Tommy?
Yeah, Tommy Tricro.
Did you guys know that I just changed my name?
I am formerly known as Chad Westport,
it is now Tommy Westport.
So putting it out there.
Yeah.
Oh, Lord.
We did get an offer for a kidney in there,
but that's hard to convert to kidney.
All right, what's your blood type?
I might have a buyer.
You a smoker?
You drink much?
Like sugar?
Yeah, exactly.
All right, and I'll just toss these up here again.
Rick, you know how the program goes.
Again, appreciate the continued support.
And again, all of this is going to Nick Risen, everybody.
So appreciate this greatly.
Email directly with this auction is right there.
So type it in chat if you need these again.
But we'll keep the show rolling.
Tommy Westport, exactly.
Tommy Westport right here.
All right, let's see.
Actually, before I do this,
let's see what the scoop number one is
and see if it's time to put up scoop number two.
But then we're moving to a lemon hoko bundle
with a hat and four packs, guys.
And these are over right there.
There's eight scoops left.
So let's talk about that one again, guys.
Just eight scoops over at vegansbeans.com.
It is great fun dip.
Black White Fantasy by Cushman's.
10 feminized seeds.
They're 10 fems, y'all, for $50.
So you got Mendo Perp by Purple Unicorn F3
crossed into Cushman's $50 packs.
And you know what?
If they don't go at the auction, they'll stay on the site.
Okay, so I'll leave them until they sell out.
So for those of you that are watching this after the fact,
check and see if there's still an inventory.
All right.
And these are all under the Nick fundraiser tab, right?
They're gonna be under Lime Rising Farms Breeder tab.
It was just easiest,
instead of making a whole fundraiser tab,
that would have taken me more time.
Cool.
So this one's gonna be for the lemon hoko hat.
And we're gonna do four packs.
And I'm not gonna pick.
I'm just gonna look at you guys
and start pulling them backwards.
And that's what they're gonna end up.
I know there's eight packs here.
So there's four and four.
Oh, hold on.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
There were 10, so five and five.
The deal gets sweeter.
All right, five and five.
He does such good work, man.
Yeah, he's from Washington.
So I got a root for him.
And actually hearing some of his stories,
I wonder if back in the day,
I was buying some of his stuff secondhand.
Like I really, after hearing some of the stories,
I'm like, wait a minute.
Interesting.
Interesting world.
Yeah, he's such a cool guy.
Like a very interesting guy too, man.
I really liked him a lot.
Really do.
I'm not gonna put this on my fat head.
And one thing that he shares in common with Nick
is dog breeding.
That's been a big part of Nick's life
and also a big part of Lemon Hoko's life as well,
which is pretty cool.
Yeah, man.
He's really into it too.
Yeah, it's interesting how some of these things
translate into other areas in life.
Dog breeding is common amongst breeders.
And I'm also starting to find growing peppers
is kind of the new alternative plant to grow for everybody.
People are getting into their peppers.
Mushrooms.
Mushrooms.
That's so exciting.
All right, here we go.
Here we go.
All right, we're starting it out 150 right now.
Woke News, we get this highlighted.
Boom.
God, that looks sexy right there.
Don't it?
Before I even start the packs,
or before I even start the timer,
I wanna go through the packs.
Barry White 9, Black Sir F1,
Glue Double D,
Dolly Patron F1,
Frog Fart DD.
So, and this will be five packs with a hat and go.
Boom.
200 bucks, Rotten Skateboards.
That's where we're sitting right now.
Oh yeah.
There's a lot of people in here
have tried some of the Lemon Hoko stuff.
Yeah, definitely fire.
I gotta get a hat too.
Like, I really need a hat.
He's got a pretty good Discord going.
Have you ever checked that out?
I'm over there at least every other day.
There you go.
I'm out and talking to them.
Yeah, the Northwest 47 group.
They're great people.
I imagine, hopefully he's got some of this stuff up there.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Like, you can go into his Discord
and look at everything that you're looking at right there.
A lot of other people's experiences and grows of it.
A lot of cool pictures.
Yeah, it's just a cool spot to hang out.
Really laid back, cool people.
And it's always a good time over there, always.
All right, guys.
Somebody is gonna get a steal of the night
at 200 bucks for five packs and a hat.
Y'all are asking about this all night
and it's sitting at $200 with a minute and a half left.
Talk with your fingers guys, and it includes numbers.
Everybody's getting their sniper game on right now.
And then they're gonna wait for last second
and somebody is gonna shoot a 45
when they're shooting a 38, all right?
That's what's gonna happen.
Don't wait till last second, y'all.
Rotten skateboards one up themselves.
That's a winning spirit right there.
225.
225, Dave's coming in, coming in hot.
Minute left, y'all.
Minute, minute left.
He's got some super awesome blueberry work to it.
Here you guys go.
Here you guys go.
When the minute starts is when they start shooting.
Yeah.
Do you think we should maybe go to two minutes
in the future?
No.
No?
You know what?
I think so.
I'm gonna go to two from three just to move it along
to try to not through the rest of this stuff
because I still have a couple other scoops
I need to load up on the...
I should have loaded one of them up
while Tommy did his bundle.
Doing what I can.
Rotten skateboards at 260.
Who wants to go 270?
We're gonna...
We got 12 seconds left, y'all, on my end.
Yeah.
Rotten skateboards has been coming in,
Falcon coming in hot, man.
He's getting a lot of cool stuff tonight.
Going once, going twice, sold.
Rotten skateboards, 260.
Somebody else bid 260, but...
You gotta come in better.
Yeah, you can't...
This isn't matching.
This is a one-time package, you know?
We don't have two of these packs
to give out at the same price.
It's what an auction is, guys.
So we're just trying to keep it moving along, everybody.
All right, let's see.
This is gonna be Lemon Hoko Hat Bundle.
And that was...
Let's see, let me take this off.
That was rotten skateboards at 260.
Let me bring that back up for you here.
Yep, rotten skateboards, 260.
Big ups to you, sir.
Congratulations.
I know you're gonna enjoy the multiple packs,
and hopefully we'll see you donning the hat
on one of the podcasts here with Chris, hopefully.
So we've got that there.
Let me know if you need any Venmo on the way.
Perfect, right on.
Appreciate that.
And one more time, that Venmo, at Nick-Rysden.
All right, all right.
Let's see, let's see.
So what do y'all think?
Do you guys wanna do the Crickets and Cicada single pack,
a Tom Hills Hayes F3?
Yeah, I think it's time for that, man, for sure.
Okay.
Should I...
I have some other stuff here I could throw in with it,
or should I just do that one?
Just do that one by itself, man.
Okay.
Let's do that, and let's do a quick lightning round
on that one, two minutes.
Two minutes.
Get the bids going, guys.
We're going.
Two minutes has started.
Tom Hills Hayes F3.
We got captive 420 in here right now.
Getting us started at 100.
Michigan, for the win, comes out with 150.
Oh, but I passed Liam 180 for Tom Hills Hayes F3.
Man, who can appreciate that good Hayes.
We've got four that just came in at 200.
The first one on my screen out of that group,
but that was short-lived
because Baxter McGillicuddy comes back in.
We've got three people who all said 250.
Locked and loaded is the first on my screen.
Woke News coming back at 280.
And if you guys keep this up,
I really will start to get an auctioneer's voice.
I'm already feeling it going fast.
All right, 350, lock and loaded.
Do I hear a 300?
Do I hear a 360?
We got beans.
I don't know how they do that shit.
Lock and loaded, 350, guys.
Miss Hayes is a monster pack.
And shout out Baxter.
He's one of the two guys that donated a 808 box set back
that won it in an auction.
So thank you, Bax.
I appreciate you, brother.
Yeah, big ups to that.
Those are pretty special packs too.
A box, man.
I mean, you can't even call that a pack.
That's the box set.
Yeah, you got the entire Beatles collection, man.
All right, we're at 350, you guys, 30 seconds.
Because we're like, like we said,
we've got enough to continue to go through.
So.
350, you guys got plenty of time.
It's amazing how long 20 seconds can last
when you're really, when you're locked and loaded.
These last 20 seconds are gonna feel like two minutes.
Cause he really wants these.
I'm like multitasking with four devices and four hands.
Going once, going twice.
So, so 350.
And that was locked and loaded, 350.
That's a steal right there.
That really is.
Yeah.
Yeah, but he's all legit.
So that last, yeah, that last bundle that we did
with the top dog and all that stuff,
that was donated by him.
Oh, wow.
Oh shit, then he deserves that steal.
Let's be real.
Because he just put a huge bundle out there
that was worth like two grand that went for a grand.
Yeah, he's a really, really good guy.
Really is, man.
That's awesome that we, oh, go ahead.
I like the organization I'm doing this time
compared to the last.
I'm just writing who won it, the price right on here
and doing a quick note here.
Cause then I'm gonna take care of all
of the shipping information through emails
or I don't have to write it right here.
All right, go ahead now, Chad.
Cause I want to set up scoop number two.
So why don't you guys talk for one second
and then we'll go from there.
Yeah, I was just gonna say, you know, it's cool too.
It's a testament to the people that are doing this
but also the person who we're here doing this for
that not only are people donating big packs
and things like that, that they could have sold
and bought a little car with
but they're putting it up for here.
And they're also in here buying packs as well.
So that's, you know, hats off guys.
That's pretty freaking cool, man.
Yeah, you can see my buddy Northland Sauce
up in here fucking dead.
But he's still doing awake, man.
So I think this next one, I thought it was all the same
but it's all different packs here.
And I almost want to put it as a scoop random.
We're gonna do another $50 scoop
and you get a random pack from Beyond Hype Seed Company.
There is about 10 different variety
or there's some different varieties of things here.
And I think if I do that, there's 14 packs.
I'll do them at a $40 scoop.
Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, $50 scoop,
14 packs at $700 to go to Nick's Cause.
So it's gonna be a random Beyond Hype Seed Company,
$50 scoop and that's what's gonna happen.
You guys go ahead and talk for one more second
while I set this up.
All right, I'm just trying to get this typed into here.
Oh, no more than 50 characters per.
All right, I will defeat your,
oh no, still 50 characters, wow.
Scoop number two, 50 bucks.
Wait a minute, each, oh, I'm only allowed to have 50 ban
and that's cause nobody deletes shit from these things.
I gotta delete stuff
so I can actually put up what we're listing.
Oh, shit, Peter heard that.
No, this is a backend house cleaning type thing.
I'm under.
You're under you.
I know, I know.
Yeah, I am under me,
but I have all the tickers from other things,
which is fine, I'll delete them.
They know how to make them again.
Oh, there's a banner limit, I didn't know that.
Yeah, you wanna get 50.
It's when you change your name to Tommy
and that doesn't recognize you.
Hey man, anything for the seeds.
So these are gonna be $50 scoops.
I'm gonna, it's up on the site right now
and it's beyond Hype Seed Company.
The names of the strains, Whorehouse Blues,
Barbello by BMT, Gelato 41 by BMT, Glitter Litter,
Omaha Blues, Motor City Blues, Oscar Diggs,
Blue Lamoon, Sunset Sherbert by BMT, Top of the Muffin,
Sunset Sherbert by BMT, Sunset Sherbert by BMT.
If you order more than one,
I will make sure you get different packs.
You will not, because there are a couple doubles in here.
So we're gonna do those as a $50 scoop
and those are up on the site as well, y'all.
So let's just move down this list.
And you know what, since Baxter was in here,
bidding on things, we're gonna move over
to this first box set and do that now.
It's a good time.
And the third and final scoop of the evening, guys,
will be some stuff, Coma from PCS donated.
It is Appletini, which is Apple Fritter by, hold on.
I don't wanna misquote it.
I asked them what it was.
PCS1, I believe, Appletini by PCS1.
And I got, yep, Apple Fritter by PCS1.
And I got six 12-packs.
We're gonna do scoops on those for 60 bucks.
But first and foremost, we're gonna do this Sugar Tits.
Gift box from 808 Genetics.
And I did break the seal last live to show the content.
So I'm gonna go ahead and open it.
And we're gonna do two of these.
The first one's the Sugar Tits box set.
The second one is gonna be the Peanut Butter
and Jelly Breath box set, both donated back.
I don't have the Peanut Butter and Jelly Breath one
until Monday or it'll be here tomorrow or Monday, two days.
I really like this box.
It comes with three T-shirts.
And the size of the shirts here are extra larges.
And it comes with 12 packs of seeds inside, y'all.
So gasoline candy, Cherry Gasoline by Candy Machine.
And the Sugar Tits is a Runtz Bat Cross created by 808.
Star Candy, Star Girl by Candy Machine.
Kawaii Candy, Kawaii Electric by Runtz BX.
Garlic Brittle, GMO by Candy Machine.
Octane, Crippy by Candy Machine.
Sugar Tits, Runtz by Candy Machine.
Then Gasoline Machine, Cherry Gasoline by Candy Machine.
Animal Cookie, or Animal Machine,
Animal Cookies by Candy Machine.
Punk Machine, GMO Papaya by Candy Machine.
And three more, Rainbow Ropes, Cherry Pie by Candy Machine.
Sherbin Runtz, Sunset Sherbert by Runtz BX.
Cake and Runtz, Wedding Cake by Candy Machine.
So guys, I gotta start the bidding on this guy
at 500 bucks, cause I know what the value is of this.
That's half, that's less than half
of the retail value on this.
Comes with three t-shirts, 12 packs.
Who's gonna start me off at 500?
Easily understood.
And two questions quickly as we're doing this.
A little e-boy says, if I buy more than one scoop,
do I save on shipping?
Is the website set up for that?
Or is that not how it's set up?
We'll talk in the DM when we talk about payment,
cause you can't pay through the site,
so I'm gonna have to reach out to them for payment.
And if you make multiple scoops, yes.
I'll combine it all together.
If you spend 200 bucks on scoops, I'll cover shipping.
That's how the site works.
You spend 200 bucks on the site, free shipping.
So. Awesome.
Awesome, good deal there.
And then one other question too, Rotten Skateboards.
This was about the Venmo.
Hello.
Is he wearing sunglasses on his head
in the Venmo profile pic?
We just wanna make sure, again, just check the spelling
and everything matches that is accurate here.
Because again, some people are shitheads
and like to make things look similar.
So you do need to check these little details
and thanks for asking that.
We'll possibly get an answer here.
I'll tell you in one second.
I'm looking it up right now for you, Chad.
Okay, thank you.
No, he doesn't.
Let me see.
Yes, he has sunglasses on his head sitting next to his pig
with his arm on the pig.
That's a great picture.
Okay, good deal, thank you.
Piggy Smalls.
Oh shit.
Atoid Genetics is out of Hawaii.
They're on Kauai.
And they've been running a lot of older genetics.
And I'll tell you what.
They breed some fire out there.
I've ran a couple of their packs
and they are definitely fire.
Krippi, I mean, there's an argument
because the Krippi comes from Florida.
Atoid said his father had it in Hawaii back in the day.
So, you know, I'm not gonna go there, you know?
But I will say this.
12 packs, three t-shirts starting at 500 bucks.
Oh, and I gotta start the timer.
Yep, Tommy Tricomes back at it again.
He is coming in.
He's ready to start it off.
He's like, let's get this ball rolling.
500 bucks to Tommy Tricomes.
Clock is running.
Yep, clock's running, everybody.
And Tommy's like, well, Rico just bought me all these packs.
I gotta buy something.
You know what?
He hit me up.
He was like, yeah, I'm lagging out hard
because it's like I didn't have my wifi on.
He was betting on something else like both times,
but he's like, I'm good to go either way.
I was like, dude, you pretty much scored
on that last lag bet, man.
But you really, really, really did good.
It's accidentally a score in there.
That's good.
That's meant to be.
Yeah.
Krippie is actually a strain, guys,
not just slang term for those.
It has been around in Florida for the longest time.
And I believe it's a true OG derivative.
Like I believe it's a really strong OG is how everybody.
All right, Tommy's gonna steal this at 500 bucks.
And I'm just gonna laugh
because he's gonna grow this stuff out next year.
And he's gonna be, you guys are gonna wonder
where you can get these packs and they're gone.
Yep.
That's the thing, man.
Don't sleep on them until the pictures come out, guys.
Can't tell you how many times we've all kicked ourselves
for doing the same thing.
Rainbow belts.
First one.
There you go.
Now they have done so many projects
and they re-released that F, was it F2 or an F3
that archive re-released to that rainbow belts.
The most recent drop that just out of control.
Oh yeah.
Yep.
Coming down to the very end, guys.
Making this easy for Tommy.
Going once, going twice, sold.
He said he was gonna get some good.
All right.
Tommy.
I knew I would name that once.
Yeah, it's very appealing, you know.
We're probably not too far off the truth here.
I love it.
I love it.
Thank you, Tommy.
So Tommy wins the 808 box.
Thank you, Tommy.
Oh yeah.
Let's see, I got the fire rainbow belts 3.0 male
I'm about to breed with the Grow Life.
So it sounds like maybe it was the F3.
Yeah, the 3.0.
They didn't say F3.
They said rainbow belts 2.0, rainbow belts 3.0.
So yes, you're absolutely right.
Thank you for that info, man.
It's hard to keep up on everything
with all the different projects everybody has gone on.
And day by day, there's that many more breeders
that are doing other projects
or new breeders coming into the game as well.
You know, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing
because the more things are worked properly,
the better the gear will end up eventually, you know?
And let's see.
What do we wanna do?
I got,
one, two, three, four, five, six.
I got about six or seven bundles left.
So you guys wanna do the single pack of dying breed
or the single pack of the Skittles S1?
I'll tell you this right now,
the person that donated this,
this is someone told me it has to start for $500
or he doesn't wanna donate it for the cost
because he'll sell it for more and resell it.
So if somebody wants to start Skittles S1 at 500,
we can run it.
Other than that,
mystery grabs, Chad, will you put the site up
on the screen for them?
You guys can pick up the mystery
under Lime Rising Farms tab.
There should be scoop one, scoop two.
There's no pictures.
I'm just kinda throwing it up.
Woke News 500 started us off.
I'm resetting the timer and starting it, y'all.
The Skittles S1.
Let it run.
You already got a guy going.
Baxter at 510.
Baxter's the one that just,
one of those 808 boxes.
The one we'll do in a little bit.
And we still have another pack of Black Lime Reserve F2
we can do.
So.
Yeah, Smiley, I had one that was sugar britches.
It was a coin that I was growing.
Never made it in seeds, but it was a sugar britches.
Not sugar tits or sweet tits, whatever it was.
This is seven feminized seeds.
Seven feminized seeds by CSI.
I don't think I could say sugar britches
without cracking a smile.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
That'll start a fight.
No doubt, no doubt.
Every time.
Every time.
That's hilarious.
The Black Lime F2 is by Bo Wallace.
Used to be a ghost breeder for Subcool
and work with Subcool.
He's from Michigan, an old school guy.
Jackson supported it.
He came in the live on Instagram last time
and said, I support these.
Cause he knows he's worked on for three years
before he's released any of them.
Back to this though, 550, Steve K.
Y'all are sleeping on this one.
30 seconds left.
Woke News, Tommy said they are legit, correct?
Woke News or Chad, do you guys know them?
I don't, and I'm reading the comments in chat right now.
Captain Crunk coming in with a snipe,
600 bucks with just a couple seconds left.
We'll let this one end
and then I'll address that real quick.
Okay, going once, going twice, sold to Captain Crunk.
And I'm doing the going once, going twice, sold
to try to eat up a little bit of the lag y'all.
I'm trying to do what I can to make it as fair as possible.
Yep, and to Woke News, we appreciate the bids.
I hope you're legit.
If you're a troll, that's just pretty rude.
But that's not saying that you are.
So if you do win something, what we would like to see
is we would like to see that screenshot ASAP
just to confirm that you're coming through.
And hey, once you come through, you come through again.
So that will be the deal if you happen to win.
Sorry, just a lot of chatter in chat.
So we'll roll with that for now.
But on this one, yeah, we had Captain Crunk coming through.
Excellent snipe.
I think that was kind of one
of the first two snipes of the night.
600 bucks, man.
Thanks for the support there.
Absolutely, thank you, Captain Crunk.
So we're gonna put the...
And thank you, Michigan Dink Selections.
That's the person who donated this.
Thank you, Michigan underscore Dink Selections.
If you all wanna follow him on IG, big ups.
All right, next we're gonna do this two pack
of the Dogfather donated by the Dogfather himself.
And these are gonna be Project Pat 2.0,
Seed Junkie Puss Kush by Head Ringer,
Swamp Boys Hells Bells by Duke's Gone Bands.
So that's one of the two packs.
The second pack is gonna be Darren's Left.
And that's Darren McCarty is what the screen-
Yes.
That reference says.
Four time NHL Red Wings winner.
Sorry guys, hockey fan.
He was an enforcer too.
I like that guy.
Darren has sat in my living room here.
He lives local.
What?
Seth.
That's very fucking cool, man.
Shout out to the chronic connoisseur
on making that happen.
I met Darren when I worked at the day job years ago.
And then he was good friends with my father.
So he reconnected us about a year and a half ago.
So that was pretty awesome.
The Dogfather Seed Company Darren's Left,
which is Darren's Right by Head Ringer.
That same Swamp Boys Hells Bells by Duke's Gone Band.
So we'll start this two piece off at 200 bucks guys,
which is a steal on these packs right here.
Yeah.
Two piece.
Okay guys, almost everything here, let me explain to you.
Almost everything here has been donated by the community,
not by the breeders that we're doing tonight.
Like almost every single pack other than the Lemon Hoko
that was donated by Lemon Hoko.
I think everything else was donated by the community.
Does that sound about right?
Adam Dunn.
He's sending his, Robbie from Nerds sending his,
Lemon Hoko sending his.
And yeah, I think that's accurate.
But yeah, a lot of people just sending in good stuff.
There it is, Ingus, no I donated it,
Michigan underscore Dank Selections.
Adam Dunn, you're right, Adam Dunn, Lemon Hoko.
My apologies, but in my defense,
those were the leftovers from last time.
All the new donations were sent in by the community.
So there was three things left,
or four things left from last time.
And nobody wants to throw 200 at this.
I think my chat is working guys.
Let me know, I don't.
I see their chat, but nothing about bidding.
Well.
Angela Simpson, I'm trying to,
don't let your skittles S1, Chris Guerrero.
Guerrero comes back, Angela got jokes.
All right, all right.
So you know what, we're just gonna, nobody's bidding.
We're just gonna switch it up and go to a different setup.
These will get saved and put into a bundle with more stuff
and maybe they'll get jumped on them.
That's how we'll do that.
Good call, good call.
Now we're gonna do, should we do the nerds package?
Yeah, let's do Robbie's, let's do Robbie's stuff, man.
All of it in one or break it into two?
That is up to you, man.
And yeah, he was on the show here,
what, like two days ago, right, Chad?
Yep, yep, he was on here, the Nerds Genetics tester group.
Yep.
Got some guys running his gear, giving it a test.
Steve K coming in.
We're still deciding whether it's one or two, Steve.
I'm gonna do it all in one.
All in one, okay.
And it's eight packs, y'all, eight packs.
I'm gonna show the packs before I start the timer,
just so it gives a little bit more.
There you go.
So we got Chasing Balloons, is that what that says?
Yep, looks like it.
Zero Cool, and these are Femmes, six Femmes per pack.
Those two work.
Now we go to Regs, Hype Train, 12 Regs.
Supreme, 12 Regs.
Mystery Machine, six Femmes.
Oh, those are upside down.
Blue Dream by Nevels Hayes, that's the one I want.
Wow.
That's, yeah.
12 Regs.
Hunt that one.
1337 OG, six Femmes.
And GMO by Hype Train, six Femmes.
So timer starts now.
Okay, and it looked like Steve was coming in
with 500 to get it started.
That's still a great deal for that.
And I'm curious if anybody can tell me
there was a movie in the 90s with Angelina Jolie.
It might've been her first movie,
but there was a character.
Yep, it was named Zero Cool.
Does anybody know what movie that was?
It was awesome.
Zero Cool was one of the main characters, though.
Sabah Rose, shout out to Sabah Rose,
because that Sugar Tits box set was donated by Sabah Rose.
That's in the chat right now.
Nice, holler, where are you, Sabah?
Throw your name up here.
Hackers, yep.
Everybody was-
Hackers, yep, hackers, way to go, people.
You're making me not feel so old right now.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Robbie, man, a nerd.
He's been doing his thing for a hot minute.
Really good at what he does.
And me and him was neighbors.
I had this real hot shop, man, warehouse,
and I ended up getting the one next door to it
to get some work done.
And then he was looking for a spot
and ended up hooking him up with it.
So me and Robbie was neighbors
in this sketchy fucking warehouse.
And I'm fucking, it was great, man.
It was good fucking times, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Keeps you on your toes.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, man, for sure.
He built that place up so fucking nice, dude.
It was really great.
Steve K at 500, 20 seconds, sorry, Tommy,
not trying to interrupt you.
Just letting you know, 20 seconds left.
Yeah.
Steve K starting off 500.
It's gonna end at 500.
I mean, going once, going twice, sold 500 to Steve K.
Wow, Steve.
That's a good fucking deal right there, man.
Good bidding, dude.
You've been in here all night, I think from the start.
Let's see, can you confirm,
just to make sure you're not an auction or two behind,
this was Steve for the-
Eight Nodes.
Nerds, we just had up there.
Just confirm that one for us, if you could, please,
in the chat.
I got a question for everybody out there listening.
What are, y'all know about Sharon White Widow?
Y'all into Sharon White Widow stuff?
Because if you are, I might have something
pretty cool here to put out there.
Yeah, it's like if there's interest,
because sometimes people are like,
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
But got something on the rare side,
something that I made too.
So it was a Sharon White Widow with my nice select cut
of C99 from back in the day.
Reverse ND over to the Sharon White Widow.
You get these really gnarly purple phenos in there too.
Not the calyx, by the way, but the leaves,
they almost get a black look, super frosty.
And you get these weird green ecto cooler.
Y'all remember that?
Yeah, the high C ecto coolers, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And you get some of that stuff going on in there as well,
like fruity.
And yeah, they're right, man.
Like growing Sharon is, Sharon's a picky,
picky bitch, really is.
But luckily this hybrid is not,
is very easy going, feminized,
and seven seeds in the pack.
So if y'all can give some thumbs up or something,
like y'all are interested, you're about that life,
let me know and we'll do that real quick.
We got three or four people in chat.
All right, all right, all right, let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's go.
I never saw Steve K right back.
Yeah.
So what's this gonna be, Duke's seven piece package?
Just put it there.
It's a seven pack, they're fins.
Said made by myself.
Really, really good shit.
I got some as well that like I was keeping them
just to grow it for myself.
Just to revisit that one.
But I do have a few.
So like I said, I can come off with some of those for Nick.
And I know people kept asking like when I was gonna
put some of my own up.
So that seems like a pretty good one.
Seems like there's some interested people.
Yeah, do it, do it up, do it up.
Cool.
Yeah, it was originally his lone star,
Texas resin company.
He's the guy who popped the widow seeds, found the Sharon.
Old saying was the buddy smoked the weed
and so strong and everything,
slap him on the ass and call him Sharon.
Let's hold on for a second real quick, Steve K.
We just wanna make sure that that bid
was on the right auction.
I know you've been hanging out here all night.
If you can just real quick type into chat that yes,
that 500 bid was for the nerds eight pack.
We just wanna make sure.
Otherwise I have a second place bid
that would move into first ahead of you.
So we just wanna make sure you're bidding
on the right auction.
Everybody, that might be a good time.
Everybody go to the top of your page, hit refresh,
make sure you are absolutely up to the second with us.
So you're not bidding on past auctions.
You don't miss the last 20 seconds
and also make sure you pop into live chat as well.
So you don't miss a bid in top chat.
So yeah, Steve K, please hit us real quickly with that.
Otherwise I do have a tie high gross at 210.
So Ty, remember that, that we got you there.
Steve K, if you can.
I think so.
I think so.
If that's the case, we might have to run that one back
because 500 was such an early bid
that it might've prevented people from-
Because he put the 210 way after the 500.
So it's one of those that nobody else knew to bid.
And honestly guys, if people don't pay,
we're gonna have to set up another auction on IG
or back here because we've got about six more things
and we're gonna call it a night here
because it is 1230 here.
I'm trying to hope to be done shortly after one.
In the meantime though, while Duke does his thing,
I just loaded up the third and final scoop on the website,
which is gonna be PCS from Coma, Appletini,
apple fritter by PCS1, 12 regular seeds,
60 bucks a pack and go.
Cool, so scoop number three on the website
that you see right there.
60 bucks everybody.
You got scooped one.
And they're not in PCS packs.
These are, he sent me a breeder pack.
I put them in tubes.
I will put them in one of these things
with the description on it all said and done.
So kind of like the black lime ones I did last time
are the cherry lime pops.
I have one pack left for Bo Wallace right here.
So I can show you kind of what it'll look like
you'll just get a generic pack like this
from PCS, 12 regular seeds
with the genetic lineage, the Appletini.
So those are up on the site as well.
Sorry, go ahead, Duke.
I was just saying to Chad, Captain Crunk,
he was wondering if he could flash the email up again
for him so he can do his confirmations.
And thanks again, Captain Crunk.
For doing that.
Nick really appreciates it.
And I've gotten six emails to the thing.
I see it lit up.
I will try to get some of those,
the bigger ones handled tonight.
All the scoops guys, don't expect the,
you might get a payment email.
Please be prompt on that.
That again is not going to get paid through Nick.
You're paying through that through the site.
So we're trying to just get big chunks
to go to Nick's account, not $55 charges.
And that's 50, $50 charges between all the scoops.
So it's just a lot easier.
I take care of all that.
And then I give Nick a nice chunk of cash
next time I see it.
So he doesn't have to worry about all that.
And it's better.
I mean, sometimes it's nice to have some cash put aside.
So then you got me wanting to hit something.
And I was stupid and did not roll a joint
because I was just trying to get everything done
together before this.
All right.
So before we move on to that one,
I'm just going to say, Steve K,
we're going to swipe that bid out of it.
We'll have to do that nerd pack again at some point.
Cause yeah, you haven't responded
and you've been here all night.
That's fine.
No worries if it was a past auction,
we've all been behind before.
So that's why I encourage everybody hit refresh,
make sure you're up to date and yeah, let's keep rolling.
Let me ask this.
Let me ask the chat.
Yeah. Okay.
And let me ask this one thing while I set this up for Duke,
how sad of an individual do you have to be
to sit in somebody's charity auction, troll for hours?
You don't, I mean, go watch a movie, like do something.
Don't bother us.
Cause we're not doing nothing bad.
You're jack off at kiddie porn, motherfucker.
I was told not to go the fuck off out here.
So I'm a, that's why I've been real quiet, man.
I'm trying to, and you can tell by,
you can tell by profession keeps me very calm
and trying to handle things in the most.
I don't want to, I want to cuss you out,
but I can't type manner.
So you want me to put three minutes up
or two minutes up, Tommy?
They look like they know what they want, man.
So let's just go two minutes and give them a one, two,
three go on the ice widow.
There's your freestyle.
One, two, three.
So this is the white widow time, Cindy 99.
Yes, sir.
Sharon white widow.
Sharon white widow.
Dave's got 200 on that Sharon white widow time, Cindy 99.
Nice, fruity, very overwhelming,
very overwhelming high on it.
Make you feel real, really weird.
Very, very weird.
So flower time, you're going to be pushing around
like that 65 day mark, give or take.
Yields on it.
By my standards, I'd call it on the medium high side.
Stacks up nice colors.
Like I said, it's a really, it's really carefree plant.
Only thing I will recommend, definitely,
definitely supplement that calcium
first four weeks of flower.
It'll help keep up with it.
Cause it'll burn through that calcium
and that nitrogen during the stretch.
But if you do that, you will be rewarded
at a stack up really nice for you, put on the way.
All right, we got 260 woke news.
Hey, remember woke news.
We're going to need immediate payment on this one
if you are the winner.
So make sure we got, otherwise it's Dave at two.
Well, cause you at 250, cause you at 250.
So woke news, we'll want you again, immediate payment.
Otherwise we will go with kazoo
unless somebody else is coming out, coming out in bidding.
But again, woke news, man.
Yeah, Corey, you're right.
Cindy chomps at it and so does that Sharon.
Like they, you know, it definitely needs.
Dave's not here at 275.
Yeah, it is well, well worth it.
That's for sure.
And like going once, going twice.
A lot of films, but that one was a great one.
Well done, Dave.
All right.
What's going on woke news?
Obviously not, I kind of missed.
Dave's not here at 275.
Yeah, Dave's not here at 275, we got it.
And this is another one of those things like,
oh, go ahead, dude.
Oh no, no, I was just telling Dave,
he's over on the discord and everything.
So just shoot me, shoot me your info there.
Save me a little bit of work
and I'll get them out in the mail first thing Monday.
You know, man, quicker than shit.
Fucker be in the box before you even realize it.
That's a good quality, man.
Hey, can you guys entertain for like two minutes?
I gotta take the dog outside.
She's, I'll show you all.
Yeah, absolutely.
But she's sitting right here like,
the sick one, he's over there.
He heard me say go outside.
He's got a tumor in his mouth, we're battling right now.
That's where I am.
Good luck.
So I will be back, I'm gonna take these guys out.
Give me a two minute intermission guys.
Cool, yep, you got it.
And you know, two woke news, just kind of to add to that.
Dave's not here is a name that we see in all the auctions.
So as you know, we see you, the more often we see you,
the more often we get bids,
the more often we know you're not trolls.
So just rolling with that.
We got Peter vision though.
We do, we do.
We got Peter vision going.
Gemma's staying up late watching this.
Oh boy, Gemma.
Are you still gonna wake up early on time tomorrow
and get all your work done?
Yeah.
Our first day is the farmer's market tomorrow.
Farmer's market, it's a great place.
Heck yeah.
3.30, your baby sister is showing up.
They're not in my mouth.
Coming in, coming in good and clear.
So tell us what is the best new movie ever?
Is it still frozen or what is better than frozen?
Is there anything better than frozen?
What movie did you see last week at the movies?
Minions.
Yeah, Minions 3, it wasn't very good.
Oh, that's close.
It was not very good.
Not great.
What's your favorite movie?
Let's see.
Out of all of them, maybe.
What's your favorite cartoon that you make me
let you watch all the time?
One, two, three, go.
No.
Yeah.
With me?
Oh, Loud House.
No.
What?
Bob's.
Bob's Burgers.
I know that one.
And South Park.
And are these age appropriate?
No.
No.
And sometimes do I regret letting you watch them?
Yeah.
Quite often.
The themes are sometimes very adult oriented themes.
I just watched the Streaming Wars movie
that they put out last night.
Yeah.
And it worked great for me.
I'm like, I need to turn off my brain
and just enjoy life for about two hours.
Bink.
It worked.
Fortune favors the brave, man.
Yeah.
Man, did you get that T-shirt?
Are you in?
Are you in?
Yes.
Well, I did have some work tonight.
Thank you.
I was like hurting.
Three.
All three girls were in the bathtub together.
Oh, geez.
Three in the bathtub and one towel.
And they all want to get out at the same time, right?
But I got a, nice.
I got a joke for them.
Y'all girls know how to.
Yeah.
Is this age appropriate?
You know how to.
Of course it is.
Of course it is.
Here we go, Gemma.
Here's a joke just for you.
I'm a horrible person,
but I'm good with the kids and the animals, you know?
But all right.
How do you make a tissue dance?
I don't know.
You put a little boogie in it.
What did your sister bring me after I put her to sleep?
A boogie.
Yeah, she walked down the hallway
with a boogie on her finger.
What did she want you to do with this?
To dispose of it.
Hey, do you know where the chimpanzees go to get drunk?
No.
To the monkey bars.
Shit.
What?
That's funny.
I love dad jokes, dude.
I got so many.
I got so many.
Oh man.
All right, we're gonna burn through these last
five or six things, guys, on this one.
For the things that don't pay.
And listen, I have had some people hit the DM
while we've been live.
We're gonna end up having another auction
with the leftover stuff,
but I might just run it as posts on IG
and run them for 24 hours.
Like create a little thing and go that direction.
Just because it takes a lot of everybody's time
to get all of our schedules on the same page
to be able to host something like this for four hours.
You know, we're all very busy people.
So I think the next one, if people wanna donate stuff,
I will create kind of like one of those auction
Instagram specifics for this.
And anybody that wants to donate things can send them in
and I will auction them off.
But this next one is gonna be for the other five
Lemon Hoko packs with a Lemon Hoko sweatshirt.
So this will be, I'll read the crosses off
as I'm setting them up.
Doggone, Holy Berry, Q Cosmos, Triple D's Black Sir
and Q Blue.
Let's look at the sweatshirt.
I'll show you the packs and then we'll start the timer.
And I gotta ask for at least a two or $300 starting bid
on this bundle.
Guys, it comes with a really nice black
Lemon Hoko sweatshirt, real soft material.
It is a two XL hoodie, perfect.
Cause hoodies shrink.
Dude, you're killing me, bro.
Killing me in chat.
I'm watching it too.
All right, so let's do this five pack bundle y'all.
Yeah, man.
Big Blazer starts us off at 200.
All right, so why do they put fences around cemeteries?
Why?
Cause people are dying to get in there.
Yes.
Woke News 220, Michigan FTW 250.
Keep it up guys.
And honestly, we got one, two, three, four, five,
probably about six more and we're done for the night.
We're gonna call it a night after these six.
And you know, we do have another 808 box,
but I might save that for the Instagram
because it seems like it's a little bit more traction
over there.
Tommy got a steal on that box.
Good guy to get a steal, but yeah,
definitely hold that out for Instagram.
And before we go, make sure that you give me that Instagram
and I'll put it up so people know where they can find it
and get involved.
I will create one in the next 24 hours specifically.
Okay, sounds good.
Maybe 48 hours,
cause I have a lot of messages to deal with tomorrow night.
Fair, fair enough.
Just let us know and we'll get the word out when it's ready.
No, no big hurry here.
This is something that we're gonna be, you know,
the, this fundraising isn't gonna be,
or I wish Nick could get better overnight,
but it's not gonna happen.
So we're gonna keep working and supporting
what he's going through.
He's a trooper with all the traveling, all the procedures,
all the just unimaginable shit.
Well, right now he's going through home health care
where they're literally putting so many IV antibiotics.
He has a PICC line through his bicep,
a port or a PICC line, it's not a PICC line,
it's a port through his bicep.
And he's got so many medicines.
It's insane what they have him on right now.
So going once, 275, going twice, 275, sold.
And the third scoop should be live.
Okay, who won?
Leave this up for a second.
Okay, yep, let me go.
I'll go back to, whoops, wrong comment.
I'm gonna write this down
and then I will go check that third scoop.
My apologies if I didn't click the finish button.
So Lemon Hoko Bundle with a sweatshirt
went for 275, the Big Blazer.
Nice.
Hell yeah, Big Blazer.
That's a score right there.
Oh yeah.
I always love the merchandise too.
I know I've been bugging, I've been bugging.
Duke, when are we gonna get some t-shirts, bro?
Dude, real quick.
So my body, I showed a few people
like what he's got drawn up.
It's gonna be real cool.
We're gonna have the old classic one.
You have the Stunk Dude one,
have the Dad's Dealey one,
and then there's gonna be this new one.
So you're gonna have a full wardrobe coming out.
Nice, nice.
And also, do you know what the difference
between a porcupine and a cop car is?
No.
Porcupine's got its pricks on the outside.
Ha ha.
Boom.
No, the third scoop is up.
Third scoop is up.
It's a $60 scoop.
And there was only six of them.
Two of them have already sold.
There was only six of the first scoop left.
In the rando scoop that was a $50 scoop,
there's 11 of those left.
I think this next one I'm gonna do a bundle.
And then we're keeping it moving, yo.
That's all I'm gonna say right now.
So we're gonna put the dog fodder stuff back up.
We're gonna throw two packs of Thug Pug,
Kosher Kush Breath, and Stinky Poon Tang.
And then Cascadian Dreams F1.
Should I do that individually, Duke?
Or should I mix that into this bundle?
I don't know.
Like, it depends.
Like, if you really love these people,
you do the bundles because they are,
man, they're stealing.
They're getting stealed.
They are getting, yeah, they're getting right.
The thing is, is we don't have time
to go pack by pack right now.
We really don't.
I mean, we go pack by pack or go into the morning.
Yeah, yeah, I know it.
Don't I know it.
So that's up to you, man.
I'm just here for dad jokes and flush up jokes
and, you know, moral support
and not to test the trolls as my patient's
little deal here, so.
Eight out of 10 is not bad.
Yeah, I'm gonna do this enough, man.
I'm gonna do this.
We got a Dave.
He says, if you bundle it, I'm in at 300 to start.
There you go.
Oh, you know that Kosher Kush Breath pack alone
is worth like $400, but I'll take it
because you're such a supporter, Dave.
Let's do it.
Give me one second though,
because I think what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna have a fourth scoop
and I wanna talk to y'all about that.
Cause what I didn't realize is these three
are the same thing.
There's only three of them.
And each pack has 15 femme hybrids,
five strawberry banana milkshake,
five Tropicana straw Nana
and five caramel tsunami by S-Bog.
So I think we might,
and this is do three scoops at a hundred bucks.
You know what?
We'll do three scoops at 75
cause there's three femmes in there.
I think that's the easier way to do that,
but that'll be after this one guys.
Then after that, we got this bag
and some fresh coast gear donated
from Beacon's Beans and we are through it.
So let's do this one.
We're gonna start this off.
If you don't see the third scoop,
refresh your browser.
If everybody's telling me it's there
and it's showing it up, yeah.
It's sold.
There is, oh, did I not put it on Lime Rising Farms?
Yeah, somebody had just mentioned that it's under shop.
It's under shop.
Okay, now the third one is live.
I'm sorry y'all.
Sound effects, add sound effects to the list.
I'm trying to multitask a little bit.
I got jokes, man.
I got sound bites from right out the mouth.
What you want?
What you need?
Yeah, what do you want from me?
I got it.
I got it.
Okay.
Oh man.
This has been a fun one.
Oh yeah.
This bundle is a good bundle.
It's got both those packs of Dogfather,
two packs of Thug Pug and Cascadian Dreams F1.
That, gosh, I wish I could remember which one that is.
I know he was working with Blue Dreams.
I think the Santa Cruz Blue Dream or Cut.
And I forget what he was crossing that to there,
the Cascadian Grown.
But it piqued my interest when he was talking about it.
So I've been following some of his Grow reports.
So that's something that he's been growing out
as well recently.
Let's see here.
Cory Boyd coming in at 325.
We're gonna start it.
Man.
Dave said earlier, don't let him own it.
Can I bet on this one?
Even though I donated two packs of this bundle.
This is like a three-way donation.
I donated, Dogfather donated,
and the Cascadian Dreams were donated by a third party.
Who donated this, Tommy, do you know?
I'm sorry, I was typing a joke.
What did you say, Beth?
Who donated the Cascadian Dreams F1?
Oh, man.
That is tough.
Shit.
I wanna say Dan did.
Cascadian Dreams.
It was made by Cascadian Grown.
Yep.
There we go, Dave.
He's another Washington dude.
Another Washington dude.
That might've come with Hoco, man.
Cause he's part of the Northwest 47.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that was at Bob Hope.
And all them, when they would do those fundraisers
and stuff, they'd always be like telling jokes and shit.
So I got this has to be done.
So why do seagulls fly over the sea?
Because if they flew over the bay, they'd be a bagel.
Duh.
Nice.
Nice.
375, Dave's not here.
Nope, sorry, I'm slacking here, enjoying myself.
You're good, you're good.
I just wanna announce it cause there's 10 seconds left.
390, Justin R coming in.
Last few seconds.
Do we get anything?
Going once, going twice.
Oh, I know, Dave's not here.
So, 400, Dave.
Justin R, 410.
400, Dave.
Above the close.
Yeah, above the close and Dave's above the close, guys.
I mean, that's how I've been doing it all night long.
I gotta be prepared.
Yep, and I do see Randy H, he threw in 400 as well.
But on my screen, Dave is above your 400.
Okay.
Good, good, good sniping, guys.
That was some serious last second shit right there.
And that was 400 for Dave?
Yep.
Dave, let me put up again, everybody,
for the auction winners.
Two preferred payments.
We got Venmo right here.
We've also got Cash App.
And these two, again, are great
because it goes directly to them.
It's instantaneous.
That's gonna be the most immediate help for them
and for the bills they need to take care of.
If you do have any questions, again,
in specific to this auction, here is the email.
This is the same email we want everybody
to send your proof of payment, your screenshots.
Also, be sure to include your name and full address.
You know, please bear with us too, as far as timing goes.
Maybe 24, 48 hours before we're able
to get to all of the emails.
But we do appreciate you guys jumping on that
as soon as possible, because as soon as,
the sooner we get it, the sooner we could get everything out
and organized, and it helps when everybody's
on the same page instead of chasing stragglers.
So we do appreciate that.
Yes.
Justin, we're just gonna, how we've been doing it all night
is whoever's above ours, just to make it fair
and to keep this moving.
You know, it's a charity auction
that we're just trying to raise some funds
and we're not trying to upset anybody.
We're just trying to keep this moving.
That's it.
Okay, to scoop number four, I'm gonna load on the site.
So I'm just gonna put in the description,
three, five piece thumbs.
That's crazy, I'm scrolling.
I don't even see that 410 anywhere.
It was on mine as well.
410 right above the old closed.
Wow, okay.
I didn't even get that shit.
Internets, sorry, but.
Yeah, we're doing our best too, guys.
Please understand that.
Yeah, sorry, we're doing our best.
And yeah, people are supporting it in chat.
So I don't know.
If I was a baller man, I would like just fucking have
like a real big thing and like where they have rodeos.
I'd hire the micro machine guy to be the guy.
Billy Mays passed away.
Okay, let's see here.
Justin R, Dave is a great guy.
He's making this possible for you here.
He says, if you can pay right now
and send over that screenshot,
if you can do that here within the next five, 10 minutes,
because we're probably gonna be wrapping in about 15.
Like he says, he's all for it.
Let me know when you're doing, I'll verify.
Yep, I'm all for Nick getting more money.
So let us know, please, if you want that.
Again, Dave, thank you for kind of stepping aside
if you want, give him the opportunity.
If not, we know where to find you, Dave.
Scoop4 Live.
Scoop4 Live.
Okay, and Scoop4 is live over on the website,
vegansbeans.com.
So Scoop4.
Justin's-
There's only three of those at 75 bucks.
Payment option again, Justin R,
and thank you for the quick response in the chat too.
Number one, we have Venmo, preferred option.
Second choice, still a preferred option, Cash App.
Got that right there.
Again, make sure you get the dollar sign in front.
And if you needed PayPal, this is the PayPal,
but again, it's not the preferred method
and do not put any notes if you use this
and do send it as friends and family.
That way there's no charges taken out of the transaction.
So I appreciate that.
And yeah, if you could get that in here
in the next couple of minutes,
that's all you, buddy, you scored.
Good job.
Yeah, bro, you scored if you get that for four.
Dave, you're the man if you let that go,
because you just, yeah, man, you guys are awesome.
That's all I'm gonna say.
Run to your Faceoff Swamp Boys, what?
Screenshot to the email address.
Email right here.
There, right there.
That way.
That way.
Fucking cornbread man.
GMO pie, GMO by Georgia Pie, Raw Genetics.
Yeah, I like that.
Death to the lime, or death by lime.
Ooh, it's pouring outside here.
Tiki Madman, ice cream cake by Gelato41bx.
Tiki Madman, jealousy by Island Fritter.
Kim Burley, exotic genetics,
GMO by Strawberries and Cream.
Amarano Cherry, cherry ice by Burnt Toast.
Gorilla Glue 4, RBX by Lime1bx.
And two packs of toast by the one,
two packs of Terp Wizard.
We're gonna break this into two bundles,
and then one Fresh Coast bundle to end it off.
And we still have this Lemon Versace from Dying Breed.
So this bundle's gonna be the two Terp Wizards,
the two other packs, I'm not sure the breeder,
because it doesn't say anywhere.
Is this Brandon Russ stuff?
I think the, no, okay, I'm sorry.
I thought I recognized the graphic.
Okay.
Everybody looks together.
Anybody in the chat know who the breeder is?
We're gonna do those two.
We're gonna do the Kim Burley.
And we'll do the Amaro.
No, we're gonna do this a little different.
We're gonna kind of split them up.
We're gonna do one of each with each.
Okay, and it looks like a couple people are saying,
yeah, from Brandon Russ in there.
Brandon Russ, B-Death, Dave, no.
B-Death by Limes, Brandon Russ, awesome.
Okay, maybe I did recognize it.
Well, then I'm gonna do it that way.
There we go.
This is gonna be for six, five packs, five packs here.
This is gonna be the GMO pie.
The GMO pie, Georgia pie by GMO Raw Genetics.
Tiki Madman, Ice Cream Cake BX by Gelato 41 BX.
Both Brandon Russ packs.
And one Terp Wizard pack, Grappana,
which is Grape Cream Cake F2 by Banana OG,
or Banana OG by Grape Cream Cake F2.
So here we go, guys.
Start it off for me, 200 to start.
Thank you, Jason.
Spud Shady at 200 to start.
Spud Shady already getting some action here.
Tie Guy Grows High coming in at 210 at the moment.
This has got a little variety back here, y'all.
Two Brandon Russ packs, Raw Genetics, Tiki,
and some Terp Wizard.
300 to bells.
Guys went up quickly.
They know what they're getting here.
And you know what, guys?
There's only three after this.
So if you wanted to get something in this auction,
you got four more shots.
Don't shoot blinks.
I need to reload my bowl.
I've been hearing a lot of good things about the Lime stuff
that some people have been working,
but Brandon Russ has been doing a few crosses
with that one that I haven't run it myself,
but people have been getting good reports off that one.
That's an interesting Terp.
Yeah, it really is, man.
Yeah.
One minute left, y'all.
It's at 300 bucks.
I did this thing back in the day.
It was a Jack the Ripper to a Sour D,
and we got some really weird limes out of that stuff too.
And, oh man, it just tastes so good.
Yeah.
It's interesting that the flavors that we are getting now,
that there's a lot more people running a lot larger numbers
and just the diversity that's been there this entire time,
but we've never really discovered it.
It's kind of a fun concept to me.
It is, because you got so many different people
with so many different,
just like their own signatures on stuff,
like what they really like and what they really dig
and what they actually have at their fingertips.
And it's really interesting to see what all-
Going once.
Really comes out. Sorry, Tommy.
Now you're going twice.
And we're selling $300 to Bells.
Man, that was a-
Sells Bells.
Wow.
Well, yeah, sells Bells.
Good shit right there, man.
You are scored.
Let me put up the payment options for you.
But yeah, like you were saying though,
people do kind of get their signature.
It's like, you're known for like,
well, this is kind of, this is my specialty.
Or at least you hope.
It's great when people really do dive down onto strains
and learn how to grow that very well.
Because when you do that versus growing
a whole bunch of strains, which I grow a whole bunch,
it's, you know, feeding schedules, lighting, wind,
all of that shit can bring out different expressions.
So when there's a person that's like dedicated themself
to a particular terpene or lime,
I love that because that shit shines every time.
Hell yeah, man.
Gene gave me some lime-type blood
at a Emerald Cup one time.
And man, I love that shit.
It's so good.
The ear bud was about to die,
so that's why I only use one at a time.
So, okay.
Now, really quickly, who was the other person
that was gonna do 410 on the bundle if Dave gave it up?
Justin R.
Thank you, thank you, yep.
Don't worry, guys, I'm still all sober and shit.
All the dad jokes, sober.
I even got a button-up fucking shirt on right now.
Dude, as long as your shorts cover your knees, we're cool.
Oh yeah, yeah, they're down mid-calf, man.
Fucking, yeah.
They're prison shorts too, so I don't feel as like,
you know, lame-ish.
I'm pretty lame, dude.
I'm old and lame.
But the dad jokes are on point, man.
Oh, dude, on point like hard nipples, bruh.
Too much.
All right, we're gonna do the swamp boys pack here.
Swamp boys pack.
All right, and yeah, Justin R.
Hey, cut it out.
Again, let us know, Justin R, if you need any of the info,
where to send the proof of payment, email,
and hell, why don't I just put that up right now
for everybody who has been awesome
and is making a donation tonight and helping Nick out.
Thank you.
Any questions, proof of payments?
Don't forget your full name and address
when you send the email,
and that will get these out to you quicker.
So thank you for that.
Right on, man, right on.
I was gonna say if the Charles were still up in here,
they could auction off some stinky used prison underwear
and stuff like that.
They'd probably be into that.
Dude.
Guerrilla militia is the 310 for this one
because this is the next one.
You were late on the last one, I'm sorry.
No, we see the 310, but the last one was closed, sir.
When you see closed by 810 off suit,
that's when the auction closes.
I'm using a different forum to close it
because I do have a lag over there as well.
So I'm trying to be as fair as possible.
This one, we're gonna start off.
I see 200 to start by Corey Boyd.
310, you want to bid on this one?
This is gonna be the Swamp Boys Runts Your Face Off.
Raw Amarano Cherry.
Truffle Tempura, which is GMO by Great Cream Cake,
Turf Wizard.
The Kimberley Exotic Genetics, GMO Strawberries and Cream,
and the Tiki Madman Jealousy by Island Thritter.
I'm gonna throw this back real quick to Corey at 200.
Guerrilla, I wanna just make sure
that you were meeting this auction
because I think you meant to do that on the last auction,
but you're in here.
If you want 310 on this auction, type it again.
I see your post, more than happy to highlight that.
Right now, Corey, though, we got 200 to start
and a minute 43 left.
I threw up 310 right after the 200 bid.
Okay, cool, so then that is for this auction.
Cool, thank you.
Just wanted to make sure, man.
I don't wanna spend your money for you.
That is a great selection.
I kinda tried to do this.
So these last two would be a little bit of everything
from five different breeders.
My boy, Cream and Cornbread, they, man,
they just never, they never fail with the names, man.
Cornbread is the wordsmith.
I'm fucking out.
325.
325, Corey.
12 regular seeds, 12 regular, 12 regular.
These are regular 10 in Kimberley.
These are gonna be regs,
and it looks like there is 10 as well.
So yes, all regs.
So we got 20, 44, plus 12, 56 regs right here
by five different cultivars with 30 seconds left, y'all.
I speak Dave.
Yep, I speak Dave.
Dave has 350.
350.
And you better not send us doll hairs.
Yeah, or Loch Ness monsters.
That means 350.
350 is a steal on this bundle too.
Well played, Dave.
But we got 10 seconds left, y'all.
Sniper's ready, locked and loaded.
Hey, old Loch Ness monster.
Man, y'all keep getting these bids like this.
Going once, going twice.
So.
Still see 350.
Still see 350, that's the top.
That's what I see.
I'm gonna keep saying that until I see the end.
Closed, I see the closed, and then I see a bid,
but that's after the closed.
364, sorry, Cory.
Yep.
It came in way after, brother.
Let's see where we're at right here.
I had Dave's not here at 350.
Yep.
Oh yeah.
All right, let's do the Fresh Coast bundle.
It's a bunch from Began's Beans.
Nice.
I'm gonna have a bag to put these five in
if it's right here.
Yep, perfect.
Put up again, website, begansbeans.com.
This is where you guys can grab the scoops.
We've got just a few left of each of these.
The scoop number one, scoop number two,
scoop three, and there is a scoop four
that is up and live right now.
Thanks, everybody who headed over there to pick up a pack.
This is all gonna get to Nick as well,
so much appreciated there.
And this was 350.
And Dave, I'll let you know.
I'll check with the Justin R in the emails,
and if he does not square up on that one,
I'll just get you a total for everything
because I know that's what you want
so before you start sending it over.
We know your money's good, sir.
Thank you for the continued support
throughout all of these auctions.
I mean, how many people are left?
There's still 189 in here.
We could do, I forgot,
there is one more pack of Black Lime Reserve F2.
I think we're gonna save that for the gram
with the other idea.
What I physically have is what we're gonna do.
And, Paul, if you're in here.
Go ahead.
No, no, no, I was just gonna say for the support,
I was gonna teach everybody how to type out a wiener text.
Just, you know.
I'll take that knowledge.
Tool in, extra tool in the toolbox,
you know what I mean?
Hey, anything to get me to quit typing boobless.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there it is, man.
And, you know, like you can have extra fun
with emojis on the other side of it, too.
Ah, it's pretty, you know, pretty futuristic, I know.
I see it in chat now and I see the remixes.
Dog Days, his is bigger.
Yeah, you know.
It is the biggest one out there.
Yeah, you know, it's gonna be,
it's like a fishing story, you know what I mean?
Exaggerated.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you know, enjoy, enjoy that.
Share it with your friends.
All right, guys, here we go.
I'm gonna show you these packs.
It's a nine-piece Fresh Coast bundle.
And then the last one after that
is a Lemon Versace Dying Brief.
This is nine packs of Fresh Coast gear.
Donated by Vegans Beans.
We got Platinum Icing,
which is Platinum Kush Breath Remix by Garlic Icing.
Mitten Mouth, Loud Mouth by Meat Breath.
Loud Mouth is Gorilla Butter
by Electric Peanut Butter Cookie.
We got Mo Meat V2, Meat Breath, Bat Cross.
We got Swagoo, Gorilla Nut by Meat Breath.
We got Easy E, which is Gorilla Nut by Garlic Icing.
And we got, oh, there's a glare,
White Truffle Cheese by Garlic Icing, Truffle Shuffle.
Come on, focus.
Garlic Grove, GMO by Garlic Icing.
Truffle Icing, Gorilla Butter F2 White Truffle Cut
by Garlic Icing.
Captain Icing, Crunch Berries by Garlic Icing.
So, somebody start me off,
Kazoo at 200 started it off.
And this is an easy $500 bundle right here.
More than that, what am I talking about?
One, two, three, four, five, that's 300.
That's like a seven or $800 bundle on the site right there.
Boom, yep, got Kazoo and Dave in here already.
Anybody still awake and still with us?
Who's sitting at the table still?
Oh, Cory Boyd got to go a little bit higher,
10 bucks, 260 is what we're looking for.
Dave already typed, oh, 274, there he comes back.
I can appreciate the non-round numbers.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
And now it's higher, Randy, 274.
Got to go up to 284 or 285.
You can go to 287 if you want.
Yeah, or 300 would be even better.
Even better, see that's a round number.
That's something we could all get behind.
How about 420, ain't got around with 420.
No.
This is a hell of a package deal, y'all.
And somebody is going to get to steal
the nine packs, Fresh Coast gear,
guaranteed to find multiple keepers.
Like if you popped all nine of these packs,
I guarantee you'd find seven to eight
keeper phenos between all of them.
And that's a solid garden for anybody.
Get that many keepers in there,
and you got playing with fire.
So I'm going to put that away.
I'm going to go back and bring up the top bid
that I had, 274 at the moment.
Let me go back, Randy H got 300.
Cory Boyd, 325.
Perfect.
Cory, there you go.
Who's got that 350, Dave?
Come on, 350.
335, Dave is inching it up.
Going twice, and we're so,
335 right before the close.
Hell of a score, Dave.
I don't know if you have any Fresh Coast gear.
I don't remember you winning them in the last auctions,
but I know you're a collector, so you probably do.
Yeah, yeah.
Wow, nice, nice.
Slim Doggy, he knows it.
What a deal, indeed.
And that was 335.
335, yep, 335.
Well, I'm glad this is going to help, Dave,
for our next seed collectors episode.
And we've got some fresh material to talk about.
This is a win-win.
Oh, yeah.
All right, so we have-
Okay, last pack of the night, y'all.
Last pack of the night.
Last pack, and in case you didn't see it, Justin R.,
I know you just asked again what was the email
to send the name, address, proof of payment screenshot,
and any questions you have.
There we go.
Let me check that right now and see if he did.
Yep.
And that is dedicated specifically to tonight.
So-
Yep, I made it right at the beginning of the thing,
so there's no trash mail.
Every email should be a legit answer to this.
And I got 10 emails right now.
Looks like seven of them have attachments.
Nice.
So remember, guys, if I don't answer them tonight,
please bear with me.
Let me spend some time with my dogs and get some sleep
before I start going through all this tomorrow evening
after I do my day job.
Yep.
Last pack of the evening, Lemon Versace.
And if this, Tommy, I don't care what you say.
This is the last one of the evening,
and if nobody's bidding right on this,
I'm bidding on it, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'll bid it.
Under 810 off suit, I'll bid it.
It's not Beegan's Beans.
I'm letting all y'all know,
if you don't act right on this dying breed pack,
I will be bidding on it.
All right.
So-
I mean, that's the thing.
All my money goes to Nick, man, so, you know.
And that's the whole thing, too.
Y'all have been getting crazy deals for the night.
So if I wanna bid on something
to make sure the value is there,
because this is not a pack
you can just find anywhere either, I believe.
I believe this one's sold out.
Let me do a quick Google search on that
since it's the last thing of the night, you know?
Yep, I'm just a poor cracker with no cheddar on me, man.
Fucking, I'd do some bidding, too,
but one day, one day.
One day.
Fortunately, you got this hookup
with some dude named Duke Diamond, though.
I heard he's got some pretty good shit.
I don't know.
He's got some shit on the way, man.
He's been hard at work.
Nice.
Yeah, he's a hardworking dude.
Good, good.
I'll be looking forward to that.
And looking forward to the merch.
Boom.
Yeah, that's gonna be cool, man.
I have to shoot you the rough sketch on IG or something.
Man, you'll really dig it.
Nice.
It's old Ed Roth style shit.
Okay, that was the like 70s guy from San Francisco?
Is that who I'm thinking of?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, some cool shit.
One of those things, you recognize it when you see it.
Oh, yeah.
I can't find it.
If somebody else can, they can let me know,
but I'm just gonna do it
because you know what?
We've been doing this all night.
The Lemon Versace, last one of the night.
Lion Breed Seed Company.
Looks like a 12 reds.
I'm not gonna pop this,
but I'm pretty sure that 10 to 12 regular seeds.
And thank you again to everybody that donated,
everybody that's been hanging out,
everybody that has shown support through this.
And trolls get a life, all right?
True, true words, man.
True words.
Pick up watching porn, do something with yourself.
Well, he said exercise.
Yeah, man.
Anybody wanna, hey, and if I don't see action on it,
you know what?
I might just call it
and it'll be another part of the Instagram.
Yeah, all right.
We've got Randy H with 300 to start it off.
So that's where we're at.
I think that's fair.
Dave at 350.
Here we go. Dave 350.
We still got 187 people watching.
This is the last one of the night.
Huge asshole coming in at,
oh, wait, 200 is less than 350.
What am I fucking doing?
And he retracted it because he realized.
Tricked out seeds, 400.
400, okay.
You are correct.
Vegan does need a slurper, Dave.
That's 100%.
I have not done one since last night
because I didn't have time to do one before this live
between the garden and the dogs.
Dedication right there.
Oh, don't worry.
I'll do three or four.
I'll go live on IG and do three or four after this.
After I take the dogs out.
We got less than a minute, y'all.
It is at 400.
Final pack of the evening.
Thank you everybody for hanging out.
Thank you everybody for the support.
Thank you guys for listening to my annoying ass
and my scrambled brain.
But it's what happens
when you got a million things going on.
Yeah.
30 seconds.
Hey, listen, at least y'all don't have to pick up the phone
like Duke Diamond does and listen to me ramble
for like an hour before the auction.
Say, ah, da, da, da, da, da.
It's when you make all the plans
and then they go out the window
the second the camera turns on.
You just, ah, ah, ah, ah.
We got 400 going once.
400 going twice.
400 sold two trike out seeds.
Closed.
Y'all are fucking awesome.
That's all I'm gonna say.
Let me write this one down and we're calling it a night.
I got the bag for it right here.
All right, and I'll just flash everything one more time
for everybody out there.
The Venmo again, the two preferred payment options.
Venmo being one of them.
The other being Cash App.
And again, don't forget the dollar sign
and the numbers there.
If you do need PayPal, we've got it right here.
Again, no notes.
Send it as friends and family.
That way there's no charges taken out.
We'd greatly appreciate that.
If you have any questions
or you need to send your proof of payment confirmation
with your full name and address,
that's the email right there.
And again, guys, please bear with us.
24, 48 hours we will be getting to these as we get through.
Who am I kidding?
It sounds like I'm doing shit here.
No, this is all B-Jen.
So B-Jen, he's gotta take some time for his own life here
and take care of the puppy.
So please, everybody be patient,
but the quicker you pay us,
the quicker you send that information,
the faster Nick gets assistance.
And also too, I'm gonna get screenshots
from Shannon and Nick of their payment sources.
So I can cross-reference and make sure
that nobody's trying to pull over a fast one.
And that's usually what happens.
When you do the $50 scoops and they're sending $50,
like I've seen the same person
or people try to use the same screenshot,
which is kind of crazy to me
and really shady for a $50 thing.
So that eliminates all of this
by running those little small ones through the site.
And again, with those guys,
there are still, there's four scoops on the site,
should all be under Lime Rising Farms.
Let me double check and make sure it is.
Did number three get moved?
Number three did get moved.
There's three of number three left,
two of number four left,
five of number one left,
and number two, there's 11 of.
So we might have to do something with that number two
because most people didn't like my random pick pack.
So I just tried to make it work guys.
And we did do a great job and thank you again.
Chad, thank you for hosting.
Tommy, thank you for co-emceeing with us here
and telling us the funny dad jokes.
Those are always awesome.
And how to do text Venus,
like those are all priceless things.
Life skills, life skills.
But you set the bar high.
We expect more dad jokes now next time.
Have to brush up.
Cool, well with that, you guys, everybody,
thank you so much for your time.
B. Jen, Duke, you guys are awesome, man.
You're here, you're sweating,
you're putting in the hours too.
So thank you, appreciate that.
Thank you, Chad.
Thank you guys.
And number, last but not least,
thank you to everybody that came in.
That's the number one thank you.
Whether you were here hanging out, supporting,
trying to control the trolls, bidding, donating,
thank you to everybody that's supporting Nick
and all of us trying to help him through this journey.
So y'all have a wonderful blessed night.
Cool, and with that, we'll end the show, everybody.
