[00:11.450 --> 00:15.570]  Hey I'm Stephen Reisner with Potent Ponics and I do a lot of work with
[00:15.570 --> 00:20.130]  aquaponic cannabis production and we're here with Chris Trump to talk about how
[00:20.130 --> 00:24.930]  you can utilize Korean natural farming and lactobacillus ferments to improve
[00:24.930 --> 00:30.450]  aquaponic both fish production and plant production via cannabis or vegetables. So
[00:30.450 --> 00:33.530]  why don't you tell everybody a little bit about what lactobacillus ferment is
[00:33.530 --> 00:40.650]  before we get into how it helps aquaponics. So yeah lactobacillus is this
[00:40.650 --> 00:45.850]  family of microbes that really does all kinds of things in nature. You're
[00:45.850 --> 00:51.010]  outnumbered in your body ten or a thousand to one and 70% of the microbes
[00:51.010 --> 00:56.130]  in your body that you rely on for nutrients in your gut is lactic
[00:56.130 --> 01:03.390]  acid bacteria and so it's reasonable and understandable that the digestive system
[01:03.390 --> 01:08.090]  of a plant is similar as we find all these interconnectivity in nature. So
[01:08.750 --> 01:15.910]  it's the cultivation of it to have a high density serum of lactic acid
[01:15.910 --> 01:24.110]  bacteria is what we're using in farms. Why don't you tell everybody why it is that you're an expert on Korean natural farming. You're pretty much the
[01:24.110 --> 01:29.590]  biggest expert that speaks English as far as I'm concerned. Yeah it's by
[01:29.590 --> 01:36.990]  necessity we farm 700 acres of macadamia nuts in Hawaii and there was
[01:37.490 --> 01:44.970]  nobody holding my hand through it so it was a lot of learning through trial and
[01:44.970 --> 01:52.170]  error and it's been a blast. So we now farm exclusively with natural farming on
[01:52.170 --> 01:57.570]  700 acres of macadamia nuts organically certified and this is organically
[01:57.570 --> 02:02.070]  certifiable. Quick plug to if you're doing natural farming and want to mess
[02:02.070 --> 02:06.330]  with certification don't try and teach your certifier what natural farming is.
[02:06.670 --> 02:13.310]  Don't try and go to USDA and define terms and create a new system. You're
[02:13.310 --> 02:19.710]  making plant-based compost or actively aerated compost tea. There's
[02:19.710 --> 02:25.470]  all kinds of regulations in place. It's solid, it's simple, it's a few simple
[02:25.470 --> 02:33.250]  steps. Just a little protection for us if you start making up terms you might run
[02:33.250 --> 02:39.010]  into problems. Absolutely so I've been after meeting Chris and hearing about
[02:39.010 --> 02:43.630]  all the awesome stuff he does I started using different aquaponic components or
[02:43.630 --> 02:46.910]  I'm sorry different Korean natural farming components in aquaponics and
[02:46.910 --> 02:50.710]  what that allowed us to do with specifically with lactobacillus allows
[02:50.710 --> 02:55.270]  us to eliminate the fish waste and parts of the system where it gets past the
[02:55.270 --> 03:00.070]  filter. It also helps eliminate pathogens in the system by eliminating them by
[03:00.090 --> 03:04.630]  consuming them. It also helps mineralize the fish waste a lot faster and also
[03:04.630 --> 03:08.830]  increases fish growth. So overall there's a study that's going to be coming
[03:08.830 --> 03:11.530]  out later this year through the University of Kentucky State. There's a
[03:11.530 --> 03:13.990]  really awesome guy over there named Joe Pate that helped put a lot of that
[03:13.990 --> 03:17.630]  research together and they're gonna it's gonna talk about how it increases fish
[03:17.630 --> 03:22.270]  growth rate by 15% and plant growth rate on average by 18% and it's gonna be
[03:22.270 --> 03:26.790]  really really awesome. So you can take things like lactobacillus or even WCA to
[03:26.790 --> 03:31.510]  provide bioavailable calcium or all different types of things everything but
[03:31.510 --> 03:39.070]  basically FFA so you don't intimidate the fish too much or FAA I'm sorry.
[03:39.070 --> 03:43.630]  Just to make sure that you don't use the fish stuff but everything else from
[03:43.630 --> 03:47.790]  Korean natural farming can be used in aquaponics and greatly benefit the
[03:47.790 --> 03:52.510]  aquatic food web as well as the soil food web and really help people on both
[03:52.510 --> 04:01.190]  ends. I would mention I would probably avoid liquid IMO or IMO in aquaponics. I
[04:01.190 --> 04:06.750]  think that the soil microbes as if you're really trying to induce
[04:06.750 --> 04:12.390]  introduce a lot of them can mess with your your balance and actually I think
[04:12.390 --> 04:16.470]  I've told you this before I had a commercial aquaponics system we raised
[04:16.470 --> 04:23.630]  baby romaine for chef Sincona in Hawaii and the one I ran into some wonkiness
[04:23.630 --> 04:29.710]  when adding IMO I was playing with all of it. LAB FPGA all these things were
[04:29.710 --> 04:36.870]  just awesome but IMO caused some just just strange things so I think like you
[04:36.870 --> 04:41.750]  said and you've talked a lot about the aquatic food web being pretty uniquely
[04:41.870 --> 04:46.550]  different from the soil food web and I just I think respecting that
[04:46.550 --> 04:51.190]  understanding that nature has those lines here's where water is your soil is
[04:51.190 --> 04:55.150]  and there's a little bit of crossover but there is a pretty big difference
[04:55.150 --> 04:58.910]  what what kind of things are different what have you experienced? So I found that
[04:58.910 --> 05:02.430]  certain minerals will oxidize a little faster and maybe need to be
[05:02.430 --> 05:05.750]  supplemented a little more often things like iron would be the biggest example
[05:05.750 --> 05:10.990]  but aside from that just with aquaponics we can run much lower nutrient levels to
[05:10.990 --> 05:14.830]  have lower bioavailability nutrients because we have a wider biodiversity so
[05:14.830 --> 05:18.830]  we have different multiple different microbial chains that are making things
[05:18.830 --> 05:22.150]  bioavailable and when you combine that with something called a dual root
[05:22.150 --> 05:25.310]  zone which is a method that I talk about regularly where we have this
[05:25.310 --> 05:29.230]  terrestrial soil layer and living soil and all the wonderful things that all of
[05:29.230 --> 05:32.350]  a lot of the other speakers here at the regenerative conference are speaking on
[05:32.350 --> 05:36.190]  can survive and thrive and benefit the plant and the upper half of the root
[05:36.190 --> 05:39.070]  zone then we have a layer of burlap just to keep that soil from getting down
[05:39.070 --> 05:42.630]  below and then below that we have a layer of hydrogen at flood and drains
[05:42.630 --> 05:46.390]  and allows us to have all the aquatic microbes and the fish waste and all of
[05:46.390 --> 05:49.990]  those microorganisms that are aquatically based and allowing them to
[05:49.990 --> 05:52.630]  break down nutrients in a whole different way along with the fish waste
[05:52.630 --> 05:57.190]  so it really and usually the fish waste is their main mineral source so this
[05:57.190 --> 06:00.670]  allows us to get 70 to 90 percent depending on strain of the nutrient base
[06:00.670 --> 06:03.950]  and having very little supplementation that we only need to provide with the
[06:03.950 --> 06:08.070]  soil zone which if you're doing living soil requires next to no supplements so
[06:08.070 --> 06:11.910]  as long as we have an iron rich soil zone or or other things we can use all
[06:11.910 --> 06:17.190]  the Korean natural farming methods in the soil zone even FFA or FAA or I'm
[06:17.190 --> 06:23.110]  sorry whichever one it is I've had one too many joints today I'll admit it but
[06:23.110 --> 06:28.550]  as long as you you can use all those in the soil layer and it really can make a
[06:28.550 --> 06:31.110]  difference and you can use all the practices if you're a soil grower and
[06:31.110 --> 06:34.590]  hybridize that and really increase production especially for veg or clone
[06:34.630 --> 06:38.590]  production and even get enhanced or different terpene profiles as well if
[06:38.590 --> 06:41.750]  you're trying to really change up the terpene profiles for your resin
[06:41.750 --> 06:49.750]  production in your own hash making. Have you ever messed with red soil? So I did
[06:49.750 --> 06:53.110]  some red soil work in Jamaica but nothing here in the States I did a lot
[06:53.110 --> 06:57.270]  of work with green sand which is high in iron and silica just because iron and
[06:57.270 --> 07:00.550]  silica are two things are often lacking in the water part of an aquaponics
[07:00.550 --> 07:03.870]  system because it oxidizes or in silica's case isn't super highly
[07:03.870 --> 07:09.510]  available to begin with so. That might be an interesting study I wonder if you
[07:09.510 --> 07:15.710]  mined a bunch of red soil and used it as that that soil layer I wonder how that
[07:15.710 --> 07:21.270]  might offset some of that increased oxidization and in IMO 4 one of the
[07:21.270 --> 07:27.070]  things that I didn't teach in my videos but is a component is you can bring in
[07:27.070 --> 07:32.950]  red soils like a 25% when you make IMO 4 and it's so that you have that
[07:33.030 --> 07:37.630]  increased mineral content as you apply it for plants but I wonder if you made
[07:37.630 --> 07:42.590]  like that whole layer red soil that'd be fun. That's cool what you're doing with
[07:42.590 --> 07:46.350]  the with the soil layer not anything I ever messed with I did the floating
[07:46.350 --> 07:54.750]  floating rafts and but I loved we had lava rock in our in our worm bed you
[07:54.750 --> 08:01.430]  know biofilter and lava rock broke down so fast in the aquaponics system it just
[08:01.430 --> 08:05.590]  became this powder it was it was incredible nothing you you would get on
[08:05.590 --> 08:10.190]  a on the soil grow. Yeah the microbes will just plow right through it in an
[08:10.190 --> 08:14.710]  aquaponics system and really unlock and make those minerals bioavailable we
[08:14.710 --> 08:19.110]  found I've done a bunch of side-by-sides and with DWC or the floating rafts we
[08:19.110 --> 08:22.310]  found that you don't really get the proper bud formation that's why you
[08:22.310 --> 08:25.790]  don't really see if you look at all the commercial aquaponics producers that are
[08:25.790 --> 08:29.910]  that are growing THC cannabis in particular all of them have a soil layer
[08:29.910 --> 08:32.150]  in the upper half of the root zone and that provides us a space for
[08:32.150 --> 08:35.550]  mycorrhizal fungi all the terrestrial microbes that really help with
[08:35.550 --> 08:39.590]  phosphorus potassium and other micronutrients bioavailability and give
[08:39.590 --> 08:42.710]  it a time release area so the plant can adjust it you know it's going to have
[08:42.710 --> 08:46.190]  the bulk of its nutrients built from the fish but has the option of choosing
[08:46.190 --> 08:49.990]  nutrients from that soil zone as well and the plant knows better than any of
[08:49.990 --> 08:53.910]  us ever will with any supplementation it can pick and choose whichever group
[08:53.910 --> 08:57.910]  whichever store it chooses to shop at it can pick and choose to get its nutrients
[08:57.910 --> 09:02.070]  from so that allows us to maximize the bioavailability and there was a study
[09:02.070 --> 09:07.190]  done by NASA when they did a bunch of bioavailability research with aquaponic
[09:07.190 --> 09:11.830]  farms where they tried to see okay which micro microbes are responsible for the
[09:11.830 --> 09:15.110]  the micronutrient processing and nutrient cycling of different nutrients
[09:15.110 --> 09:19.190]  nitrogen phosphorus potassium blah blah blah blah and what they found across all
[09:19.190 --> 09:22.430]  those different farms over 50 different farms is none of them were identical all
[09:22.430 --> 09:25.870]  of them were completely different and when they tested a group of soil to try
[09:25.870 --> 09:28.550]  and figure out the same type of microbes in soil and they compared the
[09:28.550 --> 09:32.950]  two data sheets the aquaponic system was even the worst aquaponic system
[09:32.950 --> 09:36.430]  compared to the best soil system was a hundred and sixty seven percent more
[09:36.430 --> 09:40.310]  biodiverse in terms of number of different species when they did genetic
[09:40.310 --> 09:45.230]  testing to see just biodiversity you know broad biodiversity so your aquatic
[09:45.230 --> 09:50.030]  biome is how it has more players in its nutrient cycle than even the soil web
[09:50.030 --> 09:53.470]  does now I'm not I'm sure if you go up maybe up to the Redwoods and you find
[09:53.470 --> 09:57.030]  something it's 10,000 year old old growth that might be different but we're
[09:57.030 --> 10:00.750]  talking a normal average garden in someone's home or in a normal average
[10:00.750 --> 10:07.710]  commercial system the the idea of diversity is really the key and in in
[10:07.710 --> 10:12.390]  natural farming that's that's what we're focusing on taking all these collections
[10:12.390 --> 10:16.190]  from different times of the year or different places around your area the
[10:16.190 --> 10:23.310]  idea is that nature is so capable of finding a balance if they have diversity
[10:23.310 --> 10:30.310]  but it's it's like who who wants to you know be in a town with no doctor you
[10:30.310 --> 10:36.590]  know like you need the parts of a community to work in community and we
[10:36.590 --> 10:42.310]  don't even I was talking with some friends we have no idea how microbes
[10:42.430 --> 10:47.870]  work in community we barely even have the tools to look in the window and we
[10:47.870 --> 10:53.830]  haven't yet and so what we do know is that nature can balance itself so if
[10:53.830 --> 11:00.910]  those indigenous microbes or the microbes that belong in that place are
[11:00.910 --> 11:04.750]  introduced they're gonna find balance and they're gonna work together and all
[11:04.750 --> 11:08.470]  you're gonna get is benefit in production and disease resistance and
[11:08.470 --> 11:14.190]  it's it's a lot of fun and and so yeah maybe we'll have a biodiversity
[11:14.190 --> 11:18.510]  competition between the aquatic food web and I guess your study already did that
[11:18.510 --> 11:20.790]  though
[11:20.790 --> 11:39.190]  I like this we'll play with this cool yeah yeah it's good so the University of
[11:39.190 --> 11:42.870]  Hawaii actually did over seven years of testing in aquaponic systems sometimes
[11:42.870 --> 11:46.750]  intentionally introducing pathogens some you know and then other doing all
[11:46.750 --> 11:49.230]  different kinds of experiments with pathogens and they found things like
[11:49.270 --> 11:52.790]  pythium and other pathogens in a healthy aquaponic system are simply out
[11:52.790 --> 11:57.150]  competed by other microbes either consumed or there's not enough
[11:57.150 --> 12:00.710]  metabolite that they need to feed on to colonize to the point where they start
[12:00.710 --> 12:04.710]  to threaten other you know other microbes in the system so if you have a
[12:04.710 --> 12:08.790]  really biodiverse soil or really biodiverse aquaponic system whichever
[12:08.790 --> 12:12.750]  one it is be the the soil food web or the aquatic food web it's going to
[12:12.750 --> 12:16.750]  eliminate most of your pathogen issues not all but a vast majority of them will
[12:16.750 --> 12:20.350]  be eliminated automatically and that's and that's where you know the the
[12:20.350 --> 12:24.390]  organic hydro guys and aquaponic guys and the soil guys really need you know
[12:24.390 --> 12:27.790]  can focus on banding together and we're not that different we're both against
[12:27.790 --> 12:31.030]  chemical cannabis we're both against pollution pot you know we can work
[12:31.030 --> 12:34.950]  together and really push you know organic as a whole be it you know any
[12:34.950 --> 12:38.510]  the soil food web or the aquatic food web and it's something that's you know
[12:38.510 --> 12:41.990]  great to see everyone kind of getting together where a lot of people saw each
[12:41.990 --> 12:45.390]  other maybe didn't get along quite so well and when everyone thought hey well
[12:45.390 --> 12:49.350]  that's not organic because it's not soil well it's just using a different
[12:49.350 --> 12:57.310]  food web that's all yeah yeah and yeah there's so for me I feel for the farmers
[12:57.310 --> 13:02.990]  that are using chemical fertilizers that there's many that would like another way
[13:02.990 --> 13:06.990]  but it's scary there's there it's there's some risk involved in making a
[13:06.990 --> 13:14.710]  shift and so I just I think that if if it's kind of not like hey bad on you but
[13:14.710 --> 13:19.590]  kind of an invitation like hey check this out so I like that we're for
[13:19.590 --> 13:26.430]  something you know for learning to farm another way that's both profitable and
[13:26.430 --> 13:33.950]  productive you know and probiotic yeah my goal in like soil farming the soil is
[13:33.950 --> 13:39.070]  hopefully to like sequester carbon and create enhance you know the environment
[13:39.070 --> 13:44.870]  maybe remediate problems that's something that you do with aquaponics
[13:44.870 --> 13:50.390]  while using for many products absolutely so and for aquaponics systems right now
[13:50.390 --> 13:55.350]  on average for both lettuce and cannabis for every 10,000 square feet of canopy
[13:55.350 --> 14:00.070]  we average around to one ton or 2,000 pounds of soil production that we get
[14:00.070 --> 14:03.790]  composted through the vermicompost of the fish waste and by the plant material
[14:03.790 --> 14:07.630]  so we're actually generating nutrients rich soil that we can either use for our
[14:07.630 --> 14:10.830]  own projects for other parts of the farm if we're doing a fully sustainable
[14:10.830 --> 14:14.590]  farm or even providing it for our our neighbors that are doing regenerative
[14:14.590 --> 14:18.070]  no-till soil or other things like that that's extremely rich and it gives them
[14:18.070 --> 14:20.990]  something that you know they can come and buy from your farm and it's a value
[14:20.990 --> 14:24.430]  added for you on your cannabis grow or use it on your own use it for your top
[14:24.430 --> 14:27.910]  half of your door your dual root zone pots and you know you utilize that for
[14:27.910 --> 14:32.950]  your own for your own systems incredible incredible biomass I developed a whole
[14:33.190 --> 14:38.350]  system because I had to have somewhere to put all these root balls and you know
[14:38.350 --> 14:43.470]  as I cut my lettuce it's it's amazing how much biomass you can make in roots
[14:43.470 --> 14:48.790]  and and how good that is for making soil like it's like the best high quality
[14:48.790 --> 14:54.150]  compost and you bring worms to bear on that and it's a lot of fun you can also
[14:54.150 --> 14:57.950]  use those same cuttings to feed I'm a big fan of Dubia and hissing cockroaches
[14:57.950 --> 15:01.950]  they provide a much more nutrient balanced waste than even worms do I know
[15:01.950 --> 15:05.150]  a lot of people don't like creepy crawlies but a two-inch band of Vaseline
[15:05.150 --> 15:09.830]  and on the top of any plastic container will contain them I throw a heat pad in
[15:09.830 --> 15:13.430]  there like a seed heat pad and they will breed like crazy they are super easy to
[15:13.430 --> 15:18.230]  raise will consume anything and a great for feeding chickens or fish or anything
[15:18.230 --> 15:25.270]  else on the yeah good in milkshakes but uh you know they're looking at things
[15:25.270 --> 15:28.550]  and trying to close your loops you know even with with your new nutrient supply
[15:28.550 --> 15:31.390]  with the fish and the fish food can be a great way even if you're doing
[15:31.470 --> 15:35.670]  sustainable you can just raise a bunch of fish as aquaculture mineralize the
[15:35.670 --> 15:38.510]  fish waste and use it for your soil you don't even have to have it be an
[15:38.510 --> 15:41.830]  aquaponic system and still get benefits of that you can also take that same fish
[15:41.830 --> 15:47.670]  waste and ferment it with lactobacillus or in an FF PJ and and allow those same
[15:47.670 --> 15:54.830]  microbes to get even more mineralization in an entirely different way for for
[15:54.830 --> 16:03.310]  this where did where was the like ding moment of soil and water so the ding
[16:03.310 --> 16:07.070]  moment was so we were trying to figure out how to grow cannabis and aquaponics
[16:07.070 --> 16:12.670]  and we tried straight media beds we tied DWC and it wasn't working and I was
[16:12.670 --> 16:15.950]  trying to figure out how can I get like a mineral retention layer on the top
[16:15.950 --> 16:19.510]  part of the pot or somewhere in the root zone so I could have some kind of
[16:19.510 --> 16:24.110]  supplements we first we tried a bunch of sea sponges in the top part almost like
[16:24.110 --> 16:28.590]  a more organic rock wool and put the plant in there and that kind of worked
[16:28.590 --> 16:33.630]  and then I met a gentleman from Serbia and he had an idea of doing the soil on
[16:33.630 --> 16:37.670]  top he did it with cucumbers so I did that and tried that with the cannabis
[16:37.670 --> 16:41.470]  and it worked really well and he was doing just maybe like a 15% soil layer
[16:41.470 --> 16:45.870]  on the top and that didn't seem to be quite some enough so I split it down to
[16:45.870 --> 16:50.070]  50% and that seemed to work really well and then by setting the flood and drain
[16:50.070 --> 16:53.830]  timers a little more often so you get the diaphragm action and how would I do
[16:53.830 --> 16:57.390]  a root zone is is it's a pot and the top half again is soil separated by a
[16:57.390 --> 17:00.830]  layer of burlap and halfway down and the hydrogen in the bottom with a bunch of
[17:00.830 --> 17:03.950]  holes or a basket bottom pot so it allows the water to flow in and out and
[17:03.950 --> 17:07.510]  when the water goes up it flushes the air up through the soil and when it goes
[17:07.510 --> 17:10.790]  down it pulls fresh air back down through the soil and into that root zone
[17:10.790 --> 17:16.030]  so gives you a rapid gas exchange and rapid microbial growth and allows you to
[17:16.030 --> 17:20.110]  supplement the soil zone separately from the water zone and get a lot of control
[17:20.110 --> 17:26.030]  in a very organic way. That's rad, what cool technology and what else can we
[17:26.030 --> 17:32.150]  come up with in the next 10 years if we stop focusing on Frankenstein you know
[17:32.150 --> 17:39.150]  chemistry and and start start looking at how to use just physics and nature to
[17:39.150 --> 17:45.910]  to benefit farmers to reduce labor and and I mean they're they're making cool
[17:45.910 --> 17:49.790]  robots and whatnot but as we understand the interconnectivity of
[17:49.790 --> 17:55.190]  microbial life and make use of it I think I think the sky's the limit.
[17:55.190 --> 17:58.390]  I think a lot of it comes back to the work that you're doing and and I think
[17:58.390 --> 18:02.870]  taking and isolating different groups of microbes from KNF or taking groups of
[18:02.870 --> 18:06.230]  microbes from different parts of the world that have worked similar to KNF
[18:06.230 --> 18:09.590]  and figuring out how they make certain things bioavailable and then I think
[18:09.590 --> 18:13.270]  that's the future of products for the soil industry and everything else both
[18:13.270 --> 18:18.110]  both you know for bottled and and just methodology because it allows people to
[18:18.110 --> 18:21.670]  take a field they've been fertilizing for the last 80 years and unlock all
[18:21.670 --> 18:24.990]  that there's a ton of there's more nutrients they need for the next 500
[18:24.990 --> 18:28.390]  years sitting in that field but if they have the right microbes it unlocks it
[18:28.390 --> 18:31.270]  especially with all the work that you do and all the wonderful microbes you teach
[18:31.270 --> 18:34.710]  everyone how to do it teaches everyone how to unlock the potential of that
[18:34.710 --> 18:38.190]  field that's already sitting there it just isn't in a bioavailable form.
[18:38.190 --> 18:44.550]  Yeah you take I mean we actually just did this so we we farm seven hundred
[18:44.550 --> 18:47.950]  acres of macadamia nuts we had a neighbor who had just kind of I guess
[18:47.950 --> 18:53.630]  it's a hobby farm he's well off and lost money on it for years but he just would
[18:53.630 --> 18:58.670]  dump endless amounts of chemical fertilizer on there and finally he you
[18:58.670 --> 19:01.190]  know knocked on the door and said hey I don't want to farm this anymore will you
[19:01.190 --> 19:05.750]  guys lease it from me and and run the farm and so we went in and the first
[19:05.750 --> 19:11.790]  year applying microbes everything just yellowed you know it was just and and I
[19:11.790 --> 19:15.270]  told my family to expect that I was actually not directly involved in
[19:15.270 --> 19:20.310]  beginning that my team who's running our natural farming now began that project
[19:20.310 --> 19:25.390]  and I said you're gonna have a drawback in the first year just as the trees have
[19:25.390 --> 19:31.030]  to learn a new way to eat their roots all have to change and so the trees in
[19:31.030 --> 19:38.110]  that first year of introducing microbes had to literally shift their their their
[19:38.230 --> 19:44.670]  root zone and but now this we're in year two of that and the trees are beautiful
[19:44.670 --> 19:47.990]  my I was asking my brother I was like hey take me soil samples from this place
[19:47.990 --> 19:51.270]  I want to see what's changed and he's like no I don't think we need to bother
[19:51.270 --> 19:58.750]  this place is so pretty and productive and so it's it's been really cool to to
[19:58.750 --> 20:06.110]  watch those changes but we literally have a mine of mineral there and salts
[20:06.270 --> 20:11.150]  that these microbes are all just gonna be pulling on making available and kind
[20:11.150 --> 20:15.870]  of redeeming the the ground for for I don't know how many years we're gonna
[20:15.870 --> 20:19.390]  benefit from that so yeah you're right it's I mean it's really what we'll deal
[20:19.390 --> 20:24.070]  with a hard pan you know it's it's the microbes that mine the salts in the
[20:24.070 --> 20:29.230]  first place it's really awesome it's wonderful all the awesome work and all
[20:29.230 --> 20:32.950]  the great videos you have on your YouTube channel and all the classes and
[20:32.950 --> 20:36.310]  stuff that you put out it's really really great
