All right, we're live. Go for it, Trevor or Tony.
Well, how y'all doing tonight? Tonight we're putting a little show together so
that we can help everybody with a little bit of the dark side of cannabis and
that's the the onslaught of fakes and knockoffs from around the world that
seem to pop up every time a brand new state becomes legal. All the new growers
in that area that really haven't spent that much time researching the plant end
up being took by these giant corporations that are putting money into
marketing and selling you every conceivable cross that's ever been out
there and from just a memory that most folks have and are looking for they
start purchasing these things and the next thing you know you've been took
because your plants just aren't growing the way you remember and or you're you
take it as what it is said and you start passing it around and the next
thing you know you've tainted the pool where a plant that has provenance now is
going up against something that's being passed around that has absolutely no
and one of the first things I recommend is to look and see if the place you're
sourcing mentions the breeder of the line or has any form of searchable
history beyond the fact that they offer that point to you.
Who this is a really interesting topic I'm really glad that you guys thought
about putting this out being in Oklahoma. This really hits the nail on the head.
You know I have seen so many knockoffs of so many different cultivars that you
know it's almost very disappointing to see stuff because you look at it and
then you go to stick your nose in there expecting a certain terpene profile and
you get something completely different. You know I know that metric isn't
perfect. Most seed to sale tracking systems aren't perfect but at the same
time there definitely needs to be a lot more integrity within the way that some
of these operations operate because I literally see situations all the time
where people aren't able to sell something because it has a name that's
kind of flooding the market so they'll literally come up with the flavor of the
week or whatever is hot to be able to throw on to it to be able to sell it.
We were interviewing a grower for a location and he was trying to brag about
the new barracks and then I asked him you know what stock was and then he told
me that it was nothing more than Bruce Banner renamed which also was a deal
breaker right off the bat because if you don't have the integrity to give the
person that bred the line or to put the work into it because I think everyone
here who in the audience knows that no breeding a plant isn't just about
throwing pollen from one plant to a next. It's all about actually working
knowing the lines putting in the work and you know sometimes that doesn't have
a success sometimes you have absolutely the biggest failure with it even though
you have a good pedigree that you're messing with so I always tell people
it's good if you can to try to develop a relationship with whatever breeder that
you are interested in and not just follow the hype of what's you know the
coolest thing on on Instagram or what everybody is is liking and stuff that
nature because just because something looks good on Instagram you know we
don't know if it's Photoshop really nice camera you know I kind of giggle
because you know the pictures that I put up on Instagram you know for me aren't
even really Instagram worthy because you know I'm not using anything but my
cell phone to take pictures with but at the same time I keep it real but yeah
this is a great topic and I'm glad to be here happy holidays to everybody that
everyone is here and glad to see everybody maybe maybe start with just
kind of I feel like a setting of the table would be kind of like the history
of just general white labeling um I mean I don't know necessarily if I could give
the history of white labeling as a practice in cannabis but um I do think
that there's just to kind of like set the table a little bit with regard to
cannabis and cannabis genetics there's always been and perhaps you're using
white labeling to refer to knockoffs but basically ever since the very first
successful commercial cannabis seeds started being sold from like day one
knockoffs immediately started emerging and that's something that has kind of
been it's just inherent to the seed trade honestly but it's something that's
been particularly bad in cannabis and there have been a number of different
ways in which this has proliferated there's been the form of somebody taking
the exact same seed stock that anybody else can buy commercially for instance a
northern lights or a skunk one or a haze or what-have-you back in the 80s and
just taking those making an f2 reproduction and then selling those f2
reproductions as you know the strain that they had just purchased this was
very common lots and lots of like lower level mid-level seed companies throughout
Amsterdam the UK and Canada that was pretty much all they did for a long time
then there's also just full-on fraud deception fakes where people pass off
something that is not or anything like or related to whatever they've named it
and are simply just you know grabbing onto the sort of the name of a
particular variety that was very very common and prevalent in the California
medical scene in the clone only scene also trading on forums there was a lot
of cuts that once something developed a name there was a commercial value there
and you could cash in simply on the name and if you attach that to something even
if it was a scam and you ruined your credibility a lot of people would take
that risk sell cuts that were mislabeled or falsely attributed and that's
something that's also really helped and I think that like the fact that we've
all kind of had either informal naming conventions and record-keeping standards
along with just outright scams and hustles and mistakes and misremembering
things all of that's contributed to quite the clusterfuck when it comes to
provenance and cannabis varieties these days yeah and I agree with all of that
plus I'd like to add that it kind of goes back to the original beginning of
the cannabis scene here in the early 60s where cats were coming back from war and
they had smoked herb from an area that they were in and stationed and to them
anything they smoked had to be from that spot right through communication errors
and translation errors that you get guys believing that anything they were
smoking had to be from that area then they come back here and either have a
small amount of seeds or start to begin to chase something that's been smuggled
to the area and then they'll get the line and it starts getting passed off
with another name that's easier to pass it off this happened I know earliest in
the 70s happening when they were selling brickweed were under different names
from Mexico or Colombia or they'll tell you it's a haze at that time they're
trying to sell it to you if they knew you were someone that knew about cannabis
but hadn't grown a bit because there's just different stages of where you come
in you come in want weed you come in starting to steer your own palate
towards different types of cannabis and then it starts to narrow down once you
get in there and you you know this one particular type of weed that's only
around you and you've never really accessed the rest of the stuff until
something new pops up and someone tells you it's that but you don't have a
history with it so it starts getting passed off as that also so it comes down
to knowing people that have been around the scene a lot that's where these kind
of things that we're doing here is helping out you can talk to more than
one person that was around at a specific time period that actually either has
documentation of the plants seed stock that can be passed and verified by
growing side by side with other people but it all started back then when people
were passing something that they weren't sure what it was because someone gave it
to them as that and they they really never had any experience with that plant
that's where it comes into everybody as they enter the scene of cannabis but now
we got this commercialization where something becomes hot in one market and
instantly like overnight there's gonna be seeds you could watch the Dark Horse
episode where they did this on the Bruce Banner and he went over probably about
25 different seed banks that were selling an s1 version of a Bruce Banner
which isn't even the genetic that made it wasn't the actual cutting it's just
seed stock that they're passing off with people and the same company owns
multiple different websites with different names and they're buying it
from white label production of seed which is basically what happened with um
I hate saying seed companies names but that's what happened with Humboldt seed
organization in Spain they got busted for basically reproducing seed stock
with the locals in that area by stealing electricity and they're reproducing seed
and selling that to other seed banks that now are selling it to you under any
name that they want to label that as and they'd never tell you that it came from
this shady operation they just tell you it's this genetic line and because
you're looking for it you purchase it under the guise that it is what it is
because they have to be legit they've got marketing everywhere there's it says
they've got cups it's right there on the page if you go on the high times half
the shit they were selling shows that all the shit has a cup because the
knockoff is trying to sell you what the original actually did so when you get
these lines from the early 80s and 90s that won cups and now they're showing up
from companies in Spain pretending to be the exact same thing it's impossible for
that to happen if they basically don't give you that history and the history
does not come with how they produce that seed stock they're just selling you a
story that's this is a giant thing that happens repeatedly over and over and
over in our community because folks don't know where to look folks are never
giving that information and we're all just trying to chase the story that we
found when we was high as shit. I also I just wanted to notice other people have
come into the room welcome Russell Dutch Evian London Lucas everyone glad to see
you're in here Raymond. I'm driving home so I probably won't be talking a whole
lot but I'm definitely listening. And Raymond you had a question or comment?
Oh I was just gonna chime in on you know you asked the macro kind of question
about white labeling in the industry I think Trevor hit on probably the most
core underlying reason for these you know misuse of nomenclatures is just
lack of documentation right because we all we all recognize that for a long
time maintaining documentation of activities was technically more of a
crime or could be construed as more of a crime than the actual possession of the
plant matter right so if you're looking at it from us if you're looking at a
firm a physician of what white labeling means in industry at large I think that
the missing component to Trevor's analysis there is that because there was
a lack of documentation and because the sale of cannabis to traditional market
distributors was so heavily contingent on their ability to turn around and sell
it to the end user that you had a situation where people were fairly
lackadaisical about enforcing you know you could tell a buyer that this box was
XYZ and that buyer goes man that grower doesn't know what he's talking about I
know what my customers want and so I'm gonna take the phenotypic you know
expression of the plant like maybe this particular you know it smells a little
more musky a little more lime lime and you know limey more citrusy and they
would take those you know easily identifiable from from a consumer
perspective right like what is the plant smell like what is the bud structure
look like and they'd model it off of things that they knew the consumer was
familiar with in an effort to incentivize sales so like buyers would
buy a box of something and the grower would tell them to the best of their
knowledge what it was based upon the information they received from the seed
bank obviously lack of documentation there as well but then what we have to
realize is that the double blind system meant that that buyer took that box and
gave it to a consumer and told them something completely fucking asinine and
that consumer has this mental imagery of what a Hindu Kush looks like or what you
know whatever the strain is it doesn't matter this is replicable a million
times but you see where I'm going with this so there was like two major points
of disconnect growers were getting genetics with poor histrionics and
subsequently that message was deteriorated even more profoundly
because once the buyer took it and dealt with the consumers the grower had no
influence on what that messaging was and I think that that's very important to
recognize and it's something that we're gonna have to change in the industry and
it's already changing that's why we're all here right so anyway thanks for
thanks for coming like that talk it's great to see everybody and I hope
everyone had a very happy healthy holiday season that's a very good point
right thank you I appreciate you for connecting that point because that's you
know I oftentimes leave out the end-user interface because you know not
really not something I focus on but that is that's the end-user stuff that's what
ends up in the zeitgeist right that's what ends up in they tell their friends
you know I try this shit next time you hear about this particular strain do
yourself a favor and buy it because it's awesome but they're describing something
that's not what they think it is and so it kind of like it's like a
self-replicating sort of issue totally and I like anybody who's interacted with
a middle person or a buyer has had that experience of them blatantly to your
face renaming whatever your shit is and for that exact reason oh I can pass this
off as XY or Z right and get five bucks more unit for it or whatever and that
that actual misinterpretation by that end-user is what it makes making a
knockoff extremely easy also right if you've got a baseline of genetics to
breed with and you're trying to hustle people and they're looking for lemon and
you know you have a cross that produces lemon you can put that in a seed form
and put anything on a pack now and sell them to thousands and thousands of
people with a website this is where it comes back to the education that these
what we're doing right now is helping folks out instead of hunting those
terpene profiles hunt the reality of where that plant came from hunt the
genetics that produced them if you're looking for a medicinal effect you can
get that from different plants through different lines like if you're looking
for CBD it's not one plant you know it's actual chemical we're after if you're
doing the same with THC and all that stuff but when you're when you start
with cannabis from an end-user and then work your way into growing because
that's what happens as they go legal people want to grow their own herb as
they have to pay hundreds and hundreds of fucking dollars an ounce for taxes
and all this other bullshit they start stacking on to what people want to do
freely in their homes because when they vote for it they're under the impression
they're going to be able to use cannabis any way they want freely right and then
it turns out that I got to go down to this place and get fingerprinted and get
a card and then I got to go down and pay this dude money for some shit in a box
that I can't even look at anymore and people get angry with that system and
start to want to grow their own herb and now they're going off of what was sold
to them in a box that they couldn't even look at to start with they couldn't
touch it they couldn't smell it they just had some at a party one night it
goes back to the all the old stories you were just high and you're remembering
something that was explained to you that more than likely is fucking full of
shit so people have to start to educate theirself once they want to get into
that stage once you become serious enough to want to be the person that
produces your own single source medicine or recreational herb or your own
form of freedom you should take it a little more serious than trying to get
the seed stock at the cheapest price you can find it or at the closest place
that's doing it or just because it's your friend who says he has it right do
a little bit of research on that so that you will actually get what you're
after and protect your own self the first time than having to go five or six
different places to try to find the same thing you're after and keep getting
ripped off by a very easy thing for these folks to do hey I just wanted to
say what's up guys my signals poor right now it sounds like you guys sound like
Wally half the time so I don't know if you can even hear me very clearly but
I'm just mobbing around I'm actually going out making some seed deliveries as
we speak but yeah just a great conversation I'll try to chime in if I
can thanks you actually sound totally clear oh that's great new that's great
news yeah you guys sound like Wally half the time it's like digital we're in a
bit of a shitstorm out here we're on day nine no power it's a clusterfuck of
magnificent proportion so I'm just trying to keep my head above water at
this point
I think
yeah yes yes just on the way home in the snowy slushy from my little vacation
vibe so so nice to hear you guys this is such an important conversation I just
want to say that I pretty much feel like I've spent the past two years of my
life really devoted to this topic I feel like that's part of why initial
founding of like why we founded the ethical data Alliance one of those
reasons was specifically like Providence was such a huge issue in the industry
even phone cuts everything I mean this is such a major issue and when you see
that like I liked what you said Anthony about the showing poor connection up
you guys can still hear me but just that I was gonna say the same kind of
similar thing to Anthony is when you start to see people renaming things and
then you actually look at the terpene profile of what they're renaming is very
very it's like gets super outlandish like people are trying to you know you
know even label things is like oh this is like a certain type of push and it
clearly has a completely different terpene profile and so unfortunately I
think that really the only solution to this issue is technology and my biggest
concern is that you know it's like technology requires resources and that
you don't want to you know we've already seen what it does to the legacy growers
but I do think that technology is the answer and making it accessible as a
solution to this issue across the industry is going to be what the future
holds for us because there's really no answer and there's a lot of different
things that have been coming out in the past few years that are actually helping
us to identify you know if something is what it actually says it is and then I
think it's also really important to remember the data that even if like if I
grow something and Trevor grows something and Anthony we all grew I
think the grow off is a great example of this because it shows the data of like
this is the exact same breeders cut of a certain thing grown in all of these
different situations it's still going to provide very very different medicine or
you know you're gonna have a completely different chemical position maybe not
completely different but fairly different so
interesting technology could be more user-friendly but I think that you know
I think I like to be solution oriented so that I think that you know there's
people who are all working on a solution to this and I think that we could make
it accessible to breeders and growers across the board that maybe will
actually start to like have the thing that is the thing you know and they can
prove the authenticity of what it is yeah it's a deep conversation I feel
never complete on this topic I'll just say
well until we have a federal picture available I think that it is going to be
a lot of anecdotal conversations because you know I feel like that the genetics
game is kind of like a big game of telephone where you know you might start
off saying one thing and by the time it gets all the way back around you know
the story has changed and I feel that this is very much you know the case but
at the same time you know that even with companies like you know Rolex there's
knockoffs for that you know there's knockoffs for Gucci bags so I mean you
know until we actually have robust technology so I completely agree with
you but unfortunately until we have something that will do what Philos kind
of what it was meaning to do but you know obviously went the wrong direction
with that you know we're kind of stuck in this position where you know you have
to know the breeder directly or that breeder has to say hey you know I only
will recommend this outlet this outlet or this outlet to be able to source gear
from and anything besides that is potential hearsay and I think that it's
something that applies in small circles as large circles as well
there are a couple companies that it's like I don't really want to name names
yet until I feel fully like I can trust people but I've had some very interesting
meetings lately on the kind of genomic front and there I think there are people
that we can trust I know for sure but I do feel like you know it's like a supply
chain traceability issue even when it comes to the finished flower like we
were talking about it's you know on the breeders side it's all sides of what
we're doing we need more supply chain transparency and I think that there are
ways even without you know because the whole conversation around IP and
trademarks and all of the other things about provenance and you know just what's
open source is like once you release seeds into the general public also
that's a whole other equation that we're kind of dealing with that you know then
you know there are really very very limited even if you have really solid
contracts you know there's very limited you have very limited rights you know I
can have non-propagation agreements if you sell seeds to people which a lot of
the time that's what people are doing at this point just to kind of say like you
can grow my seeds but you can't take cuts and save things from those so it
gets to be this is a very very complicated topic but I think that we're
on the way to getting some solutions I think that like I said though biggest
concern I don't think we need federal legalization but my biggest concern is
that we were gonna lose that you know we might the smaller growers and the legacy
growers legacy breeders might be the people that don't have so we need to
make it accessible I guess whatever technology we do come up with needs to
be accessible and I think that the blockchain honestly is my personal
preference for what is going to help with this because I think it can be made
very affordable and simple for people to to kind of verify things within that
and like stamp them on the blockchain well you're going to potentially turn
everyone back into Willy Wonka and everybody trying to hold their genetics
in real tightly because you can make whatever contract in the world and a
business can have one with ever greater that there is but it only takes that one
employee that's just like you know what this owner isn't paying me on payday at
the time that I'm supposed to get paid or I don't feel that I have enough hours
they take a cut you know I I'm dealing with a couple commercial operators right
now they're having to deal with theft of their genetics outside and knock off no
in particular here in Oklahoma and it's frustrating but I don't know if there is
a solution for that without you know literally making sure that you are
regulating every single person that walks by that particular plant and that's
not really realistic you know so I hear what you're saying and I have you know
from like the really good IP lawyers that are out there it's like that's what
they say is the best best remedy for this is like hold your hold your
genetics really tight and really close to you if you really care about
something and you want that but then there are also like there's licensing
agreements and other things if you're talking about like within the regulated
market and you do want to share there is a lot of potential to work together I
think it's like a collaborative thing and I think that you know if you have
something I know that we've had things that are particularly precious to us
over the years and you know it's like trying to have employees that you really
trust are the ones that are dealing and handling and having limited access areas
also so I mean it just depends you know whether you're a small time breeder or
you're like a big you know big and dealing with licensing and I think
long-term storage and all of these things are also like we're still working
on solutions to some pretty major issues within the industry but I think that
you know if you look at other seeds I forget the name maybe somebody else
remembers there's like as far as hemp genetics is a great training wheels for
us because you can see kind of what we're able to do with hemp genetics and
how like the UPA rules and the other things basically are once you release
things into the public it's not the correct terminology but like the public
domain basically people there's rules already for other things so once we get
to that place where we're talking about like how these seeds it's an
agricultural thing and once those seeds are released then people can kind of do
what they want with them and I think that maybe in the future I see people
breeding more with triploids or something so that you know it's like I
mean dare I say it it's kind of like Monsanto esque because the breed
something that can't be you know it literally can't be replicated it can't
be seeded you can't you can't breed with it again so then the people have to go
back to the original breeder with triploids so that is also another thing
that could also potentially I see happening in the future here I love that
it's the future forward thinking part that's why I like the future cannabis
project also because it's like what's the what is what's gonna happen here you
know we're really interesting the next couple years is gonna be real
interesting to see
and yeah that it's odd to me to see how many people in cannabis are trying to go
to that position of IP triploids trying to make the plant not available to
anybody in the breeding form but only in a sellable form when we all say we come
into this because it either saved our life or it made our life better and we
just keep trying to steer it in this direction and that plant was never
intended to be naturally that's the craziest thing that I keep seeing in our
community and it keeps getting more and more as we approach the rescheduling of
cannabis across the globe once it becomes a commodity here we're just
gonna see this IP thing happen over and over and over again to where the people
are just gonna be fighting in court over things they've been fighting in forums
for so many years it's crazy no that's very true and I love how you ended that
you know what we used to fight over and have and will continue to fight over in
forums and different online platforms is going to shift to courts because that's
inevitably where these types of once these decisions are operating in the
regulated cannabis market and we're talking about very very large financial
stakes at play yeah that's that's all going to be decided in courts and but I
also what you've mentioned Evian is very on point when I was posting my like
intro to the episode on Instagram I went through and all of the information that
I posted primarily comes from Ryan honestly in our discussions but he's
pointed out to me that a lot of the academic research that was undertaken
during the really the heyday of the prohibition era from 1970 up into the
present really has been focused either through early development of gas
chromography and mass spectrometry and different lab analyses to identify
chemical fingerprints and origins for different varieties of cannabis as a
forensic law enforcement tool or genetic fingerprinting techniques and so a lot
of the history of and a lot of the focus of cannabis research over the last 50
years has been really focused on this question of provenance and identifying
and tracing origins of cannabis through chemical analysis or genetic analysis so
all of the like the base ideas are there and the research has been done and it's
honestly one of the reasons why Steep Hill and Phylos immediately sought to
like the three early commercializations of like lab services outside of just
like providing the testing analysis were the strain fingerprint that Steep Hill
came up with where they said that they could do chemical analysis of your
cannabis sample and identify you know through this chemical signature the
different varieties this never really took off and I don't think they were
actually that successful in discerning the identity of varieties and then
Phylos had the Phylos certification program with their with their gene kits
which was supposedly going to establish the fingerprint of different varieties
through their genetic sequence and so the initial commercialization efforts
have not necessarily succeeded but I absolutely think that that's where we're
heading and where we will see in the future very robust analytical methods
for determining provenance I think that one of the things that we can start to
do as a community is do a much better job of sharing and collecting this
information and putting it into a database so that for instance if we have
all of the CAOs for all of the different events and competitions that happen and
they get put into a master document or spreadsheet that's shared online then
we're able to say okay all of the entries at the this cup that cup
whatever cup for this year tested for these amounts and then we can
particularly for the grow off which you pointed out is a unique sort of
competition in terms of having one genotype grown out in multiple different
environments so that we can see the range of phenotypic variation within
that particular cultivar that gives us a lot of robust data and we can really
determine the range of terpene or can a cannabinoid variance just based on the
different grows obviously that's not like a full encompassing data set to
show the absolute like ranges but it gives us a decent sample size to be able
to pin you know actually say this is the upper threshold and this is a lower
threshold on the different chemicals or you know terps or cannabinoids in these
different varieties and I think that's something that we can do now we can
collectively start like licensed operators can start doing a much better
job of systematically publishing their COAs and competitions can produce this
information and we can develop a sort of like database that helps us compile this
info.
Hey guys it's great to hear everybody's voices.
Peter Dutch, Raymond, Evian, Patrice, hey how's it going?
If I could jump in and just jump in with something I think you guys are on like
the right the exact right direction on on rectifying it but I think even in
these situations you're gonna run into people like these large brands like like
crop king seed that are just going to whether you do that or not just gonna
pop a seed out that they're just gonna pull out from somewhere and and put a
label on it and then sell it to a huge amount of people they already have these
like large followings of people that that either enjoy their products and
stuff like that and it creates an even further challenge you know we're talking
about the end-user getting a product that isn't what it's supposed to be it
wasn't the strain at what it was well sometimes in a lot of these especially
newer and emerging markets these you know new growers might even be buying
seeds off of these you know large and I'll call it out you know like crop king
seed I think there's a larger subsidiary of Sonoma seeds or something like that
some sort of larger brand and it's all white labeled crap and they're just
giving it whatever hot name it is or hype name it is that week and putting it
out there and a lot of these people are going to that product to start their
first row or start their setup or maybe they've been growing for a while but
they just keep using these products because that's all they've ever known
and then they're putting out these things that aren't what they are and
they're creating these regional issues where we have no understanding of what
products are and what is actually coming out of the market it really creates a
bigger state of confusion and I think like it stems deeply into this seed
market that with these you know large brands that are just pumping out you
know crap and not putting out proper stuff and I think it's it's it's a
bigger challenge in that way and how can we how can we get to there to stop
that because that's like step one because if you're if you're even if
you're if you're a super passionate grower and you're digging into it or
even if you're newer what's the first thing that you're gonna search you're
gonna search buying seeds and what's the first three things that usually come up
is crop king seeds or one of the subsidiaries depending on where you're
located in the world these people have search engine optimization that has
enabled them to be one of some of the first people found on the market
finding amazing brands like what amazing brands and breeders like are on this
table that you can find it dagga dot garden go check it out little plug there
have local brewers that are producing the products and doing this from scratch
you know they're not just slapping stuff on there and it's an education point
that I think is very challenging and also a little bit of a sore spot because
we don't want to piss anybody off and you know what I'm just fucking tired of
it to be frank I think there's so many people that put so many hours and so
much time and effort into it and for someone to just slap a sticker on some
fucking pack and take someone's hard work and call it their own without doing
it is such an insult to a the community is one who's worked so hard to create a
plant that I mean in Canada it's legal now to work this hard to produce this
and then yeah it's just a frustration and London it's great to see you guys I
appreciate you allowing me the space to share with you all I was just gonna
bring up the you know other scenario in which extremely large company pop some
seeds find something really cool they name it they brand it and then a small
time grower gets it but doesn't have the license or contract to use it or breed
it and so in order to avoid you know getting chased after this big company
maybe they rename it you know kind of hoping hoping that uh that that sort of
issue will sunset after a while and I'm gonna say in this because I've I've had
to do this I don't know had is the right word but I have done this where I've got
and I'm not gonna say what it is because you guys this community is small and you
guys would be able to figure out but I got a line that I was not allowed I was
not allowed to legally have and I wanted to breed with it and I didn't
want that the way I got it would have been very obvious how I got it and got
some people in trouble so I renamed the thing and bread with it and then put out
those breeding projects I told people what the lineage was but I didn't tell
them the exact name for instance you know so it's kind of hairy and kind of
shady straight up but like it was I don't know it was it's just an
interesting situation I just wanted to throw that out there and kind of out
myself well that kind of what Trevor was talking about from what Ryan had brought
up earlier and one of the shows with once it becomes public domain you don't
own the rights to someone breeding it now it becomes something that the person
that you allowed by it can do what they want with it unless you have signed a
contract with them and just the act of selling it to somebody doesn't make it
illegal right I mean doesn't make that a contract that says they can't breed with
it and say you that say I bought the seeds or somehow I was given access to
it and I was under the contract that said I can't do anything with it and for
some reason you ended up with that cut maybe I didn't give it to you maybe you
got into my garden maybe one of my workers passed it to you but somehow you
have it you never signed the contract with the person that offered that
genetic so it becomes this crazy cat-and-mouse game of legalities of who
gets to have what that's why they have to have an IP on it they have to not
release it it cannot become public domain if you don't want it to be in the
public so when you have an access and getting it for however way you got it
unless you actually went in and stole it I don't see how they could stop you
from breeding with it you didn't sign the contract no maybe not stop totally
but in this scenario they could have figured it out and come after the
person that gave it to me you know what it would have been obvious and so as a
friend that was wanting to protect that person and figured I just kind of like
let it ride for a little while and then one day out myself you know well going
back to what London was saying in regards to companies like crop King that
you know it's going to take you know an entity that doesn't have the ability to
be incentivized by the cannabis industry because who's to say that you don't get
a startup it gets heavily funded that beat that's able to control you know
what kind of information gets inputted into the storage or databases to be able
to control this information because I know that we can all talk about you know
wanting to do this as a community but we also know we're able to do that as a
community that people will exploit those if they can figure out a way to do that
so you know I think the the larger picture for me is it's like you know how
do you do that without having a governing body or a police or someone
that we you know elect into that position to be able to say hey I'm going
to be able to oversee that there's going to be integrity through all of these
processes and that it's not going to be you know criminalized at any aspect
because then it just looks like you know anything else to me where you have
lobbyists and you have people that are buying direction of the way that this
goes yeah I think that's kind of inevitable I mean you know the the
discussion around lobbyists it always kind of I don't know I've been going
back and forth with some people who are lobbyists recently and it's like
corporations and lobbyists they'll always pursue their self-interest that's what
it's why those entities exist and crop kings and those types like they're
always going to exist as well you know the history of cannabis breeding is is
just full of these sort of like knockoff be rate or even far worse seed companies
and I think the real way that we address these issues is through creating
reliable information sources there's you know the strain guide that bodily
air produced back in the day was a very comprehensive and for its time massive
document that really helped to establish where we were as like as of 1997 to
about 2000 while it was like really being developed and so while that was a
community effort sort of approach to addressing the same set of issues I feel
like we can continue that and that one of the main problems when I go on the
internet and look at sort of the cannabis media space so to speak is a
dearth of good sort of clearing houses of information there's you know
obviously this has to do with search engine optimization in the way that
information is presented but you know if you know you know is kind of how things
operate right now and that's a problem because people shouldn't have to be in
the know to get this information
as we become more legal there's going to be something set up here like they do
in other countries like in the UK there's the cannabis trades association
that works with stakeholders and companies to assure that what each line
says it is is what it is like an over there they're working with documented
lines that you can buy the seed stock straight from the from the source right
and that's what we need to start trying to set up with what we have here it
comes through with documentation of the plant and education of the consumer it's
going to be hard for us to educate all the consumers into what's actually out
there unless there's something that can prove that documentation besides a
shiny picture on Instagram over there they're using actual documentation of a
line up to the hemp line supposed to produce one percent or less it does that
and the seed stocks guaranteed to do that it can tell you when to put the
seed in the ground when to pollinate the plant if it's your harvesting for seed
when to pull the seeds out when they're going to be done all this stuff is
documented because it's they've done a large-scale grow off like we were
talking about earlier here where you find out what the phenotypic expressions
of the genotypes are that are coming from the lines right what we have today
we have a mix mash of bullshit if you went and test it you're gonna have
hundreds and hundreds of bullshit grown by so many people because nothing's
actually been worked into two breeding lines you get the true breeding lines
you can start to breed for dihybrids and trihybrids and tetrahybrids which
are passing one two three four or five traits as they do breed and those can be
now guaranteed to give the genotypes that are possible because there's only a
specific amount of them and the phenotypical expressions from those
lines that we've read and without educating the breeder on how to do that
and then how to teach the consumer on what that they should actually be
looking for and then to actually document what's being done until we get
that serious we're just stuck again fighting in court over what we've fought
over in in the forums and it becomes almost comical at a point to where are
we going to become serious with what we're doing about something that is used
by so many people on this planet for a positive effect we're not looking at
it in the correct way sometimes so I was just gonna say that I really I
really think those are such important points because you know it just goes to
you Anthony you're reminding me that you know it's like this it's also like the
hype machine is broken we're in this thing where prohibition has really
caused all these major issues within what we do and I just want to point out
also that there is so I think that people need take more time to actually
also like along with Providence it's like taking the time to make sure that
these are stable lines I've been mentoring somebody recently and trying
to explain they were like why is this happening you know like why are my
plants doing this or you know we have all this issues with the hermaphrodites
and you know they're being told by other sources that that's just the way it is
and I'm like well unfortunately that is the way it is because people aren't
taking the time to really make sure what they have is exactly you know it's gonna
prove it's gonna it's the word I'm looking for you know it's the kind of
like that proof is in the pudding I just think that it's the stabilization of the
genetics I really wish that more people especially some of the bigger people and
a lot of this exotic hype stuff that just kind of drives the market trends is
so you breathe on it wrong and it you know just freaks out and I don't think
that should be the normal I really think that we need to spend more time and that
the true breeders that are really taking time and care in what they're doing it
needs to come through more I think that really kind of all ties back together so
I just wanted to throw that I agree the 100% I had one word of caution to
Anthony's comments you know in terms of trade organizations being a centralized
data aggregator that has not worked well in other agricultural industries and I
think some of the stability that you're referencing in available hemp varietals
specifically in Europe that actually comes not through private trade
organizations but that comes through a government program that was put in place
through the UN Food and Agricultural Organization for stability of hemp
crops through academia and through you know university programs and I see
Connor down in the audience love to hear your thoughts on this
Nick Jocelyn likewise if we as an industry and as a you know whatever
movement acquiesce the private control of seed stock to academic organizations
which are beholden to government agencies for their funding we put
ourselves in a position that's gonna stifle breeding programs and the
development of genetic diversity long term and so I understand that we're
looking for a solution what I would caution is that the in this particular
case I do not believe that the end justifies the means I do not believe
that the development of more rigid standardization through the AOSCA the
Association of Certification Agency model that has that has worked in Europe
for industrial hemp but I do want to make that clear it seems to have worked
but the mono cropping and the scale of those cultivations necessitated that
sort of standardization where for what we're talking about in terms of
development of flavor profiles and medicinal profiles there's significantly
more variables in terms of phenotypic expression than just herd versus bass
content for industrial hemp fiber and so that's that that standardization that
came out of the AOSCA and the UN and the EU seed certification agency
programs throughout the mid to late 90s particularly in the Ukraine and northern
Italy really it's just not going to work for what we're talking about there's
just too many variables there's too many players and quite frankly if we were to
pursue that model forget private trade agencies then we're all beholden to
government funded university programs and so I think that I would just give a
note of caution on that as someone who's delved very deeply into seed
certification stability protocols and there's definitely some people in the
audience you know way more about this than me and I'd love to hear their
thoughts I want to add really quickly to just really quick that AOSCA I totally
agree and I just want to say that I think that we really need to be used
caution because that is the model that's going to be used for type 1 and type 2
cannabis because that is what has been in place like with type 3 plants that is
what's happened we're using those models on a global scale and so right now it is
the USDA and AOSCA and the UPOP and all of those things in the seed certification
program through G-HIC is like what is happening that's what's happening and
that is what's going to happen to the rest of our plants if things keep moving
forward the way they are so I think that Raymond that's like a really good
word of caution but it's like we are the ones that need to bond together and
have a voice of how we want this to go down because otherwise there is no other
model so if that my I agree I think that that model the same I've like worked
with the groups here with the seed certification board in Oregon and it's a
whole thing but currently that is the model that is going to happen for
traditional cannabis so I think that we really need to get like super clear and
have a united voice of how we can come together and affect change in that way
because otherwise we're gonna be stuck with that system that was exactly my
point that I was trying to bring up not that I'm for the system they're using
but that's the system that's coming and since cannabis is going to be a worldwide
commodity a small cannabis community in the United States trying to fight
against the worldwide beast of a machine that's using a system that like
you said works for them there but has not worked for us here they don't care
if it works for us here if it works for China and it works for Canada and it
works for the UK and they can pass it off in Australia we have cornered
ourself into the corner so hard fighting over the terpene profiles of skunk and
shit that we're doing lately instead of educating each other on what's actually
coming with the cannabis plant that we're going to miss out and have to
follow rules and regulations that none of us ever wished upon our enemy and
that's what's coming with legal cannabis because we're spending too much time on
the wrong stuff the people that actually can steer this in directions the people
that have clout in the industry people that have enough money to push these
things if we don't start steering this beside somewhere towards a brand and a
place to buy the seeds we're going to be stuck with the system they bring to
us and that's just what the reality of this is the cannabis is not going to go
back to how we wanted it in the forum days and the it's just not it's going to
industrialize there are other models right and I think your comments are well
heard like this is the prevailing model but that doesn't mean it's the only
model and we still have the ability if we if we execute we still have the
ability to at least create a hybrid model that provides much more
protections for small farmers I think a lot of some folks in this room you know
who know what I'm about you know there are protections in place for regionally
appropriate varietals under appellations programs and under geographic indicator
programs which quite frankly work in tandem with seed certification agencies
but the varietals that are grown in wine producing regions in France those are
not certified seed technically they are certified under a different modality of
review that is still a partnership with academia but is done far more directly
between the farmers and the trade organizations and those academic
institutions with more reduced government oversight as far as intentions
behind seed certification agency programs and again I want to make it
really clear that when you think about what AOSCA is done specifically with
hemp you're talking about they're really only looking at two variables they're
looking at vast and heard content they're not looking at flower production
with one or two notable exceptions in Ukraine they've done some CBG studies
obviously but for the vast majority of that program throughout the 90s and 2000s
it was about two things it was about bass content and heard content so outer
fiber and inner color inner fiber content so we're dealing with in
recreational cannabis and medicinal cannabis exponentially more variables
than they deal with in industrial hemp specifically there are some changes that
were being made with I just want to throw out like beyond what I asked us
done like in Oregon the seed certification board here has I work
very very closely like one of my actual partners has been on that board for the
past couple years and there's a lot of a lot of conversation because like I've
said this a thousand times hemp is training wheels for all like all
cannabis like we're learning how we do these things through hemp and we've
already lost some like majorly huge battles with the you know just the whole
0.3 total THC is just such utter bullshit and if you look at who was
lobbying against that it that is not the scientific classification of hemp
they're using like outdated science from the 60s to classify a plant that is
completely not based in science and we lost that battle and if you look who was
lobbying against it it was like large pharmaceutical companies and quite a few
other people that some people that you would be surprised by that are pushing
that and so I think that we're we're gonna come up against those same issues
with traditional cannabis and I think the type 1 type 2 it's all it's all
coming and I think that we really really need to work together but there are
they are looking at other things besides that now right I think it's like it's
gonna it's changing and so there are groups like the nonprofit work we've
been doing I've been hoping that part of the work through the ethical data
alliance and Ed Rosenthal gave us his nonprofit so we can do some of this work
and it's basically up to us I've been working for two years on this project
because I really believe in the vision but it's like you can only work so much
like towards a charity thing because you believe in it and I think that
that's where like getting some of these university platforms on the same side as
us is probably gonna be in our benefit because I know that there is also a lot
of there's a lot of controversy within some of these institutions and what
they're pushing for is maybe not the type of technology that we would be so I
don't know how to say politely but like it's just it's a little concerning it's
like it's big AG and it's concerning so there's that um I'd like to reset the
room and welcome Matthew Caleb Nick and Connor up I noticed Raymond mentioned
both Connor and Nick by name and Matthew you had your hand up so and also Caleb
welcome but Matthew I wasn't sorry I've never spoken on Clubhouse before so hi
I'm Matt I've worked in cannabis nursery genetics for several years now in
California including with a couple of researchers that are Trevor's friends
with from back in the day and a lot of my experience on the commercialization
side of things and I raised my hand a couple minutes ago there's a couple of
points somebody mentioned you know taking like a the see they didn't
necessarily have legal breeding rights to and renaming it and you know using
that sort of thing I think you know I can I can kind of provide the perspective
from kind of a more commercial sort of business side of things that's actually
a scenario that you know some of the some of the groups I've worked with we've
talked about you know what you know there's a lot of things on the on that
side of things where there's everybody sort of it we all understand that you
know you put a genetic out there you know to you know for sale that it's
gonna get out somewhere you know nobody's under the impression it's gonna
stay you know cloistered forever you know while also you know getting out to
kind of kind of commercializable scales of sale you know at some point somebody
better do something with it but you know one of the one of the interesting points
of there is you know I think a lot of the groups that are doing things like
setting up licenses or setting up licensing agreements for genetics if you
change the name of it you know the conversations we had were basically
like well then you kind of lose all the marketing clout and all the brand
recognition that might have come with having that name you know that strange
name come along with what you're doing with it so just wanted to present that
as a kind of an interesting sort of flip side to that that scenario there
well Matt welcome welcome to clubhouse and and finest with a pH so you're good
in my book yeah thanks man right on I just started to find a month ago so nice
congratulations and then another question I had here you know I I'm just
listening generally you know and and you know there's a lot of conversations
about you know what is what is the legacy grower you know who has a genetic
let's let's use that example there has a genetic that has a high value to them I
mean like what you know what is the scenario that we're trying to sort of
you know discuss here is one where that that grower wants to be able to maintain
the rights to spread that genetic far and wide as a woman that grows wants to
maintain sort of a protection of that genetic for their own cultivation
purposes for their own use and I think you know kind of for me at least
establishing that context around a lot of these conversations helps to kind of
help me wrap my head around you know sort of what the what the aims are here
if I may be so bold mr. Nick lemon remedy there has lived what you are
describing and Nick without putting you on the spot if you want to chime in on
what your narrative in this particular arena has been like I feel like it could
be impactful I did I just I just put Nick on the spot and if he doesn't
respond I'm gonna text him I'm trying to unmute Nick because I muted Nick just
because this car was on when I brought him up or the road noise but no I don't
see it hey I think I just found it like the previous person who spoke I hadn't
actually talked on clubhouse yet either and Ray just kind of texted me that you
guys are having to talk hey Trevor good to hear you again I I tried to get into
licensing genetics I had in Oregon and had decent luck getting a farm to sign
a contract but that took about a year and made no money and still had sort of
a liability of losing your genetics really and I think I came in when you
guys were talking about security cams and how much someone actually watches
over in operation even if you trust one person they might not even know their
whole crew that well and it just became more headache than it was worth really
actually was costing me money because I of course wanted to brand stuff which
they didn't want to pay for and even though Oregon was easy to work getting
genetics into metric some of the things I think people view as obstacles really
Oregon farms had figured out you know breeding techniques getting metric open
and it just it was just more trouble than it was worth and I sort of stepped
back from the industry kind of as a whole hoping that some of the things you
all talk about which I would describe as like the industry maturing would happen
and it's happening so slowly that it's still basically dominated by loophole
chasers and that's you know from every market that's legal hemp or type one
it's just basically exploiting loopholes and feels like what hemp demonstrates
like Evian is saying sort of the training wheels of large-scale THC
breeding it is just full of like some of the worst in the weed world that I've
ever met like of an organ at least and now it's become full-scale illegal
cartel stuff and so while I do think hemp is definitely going to help
breeding move forward man the industry is still just I mean talking to you all
is great but you're like the 1% of people who would have integrity about
your process and products and that's sort of lacking and sort of still
waiting for the industry maturity to catch up and then see people be not
afraid to sign a big legal contract and
for the sake of context Nick if you don't mind why don't you give people a little
context on your your academic and professional background and kind of what
we're really talking about here with what you what you've developed if you
don't mind I mean I have a geology degree I didn't get into weed because I
thought I'd get into weed but my first wife had cancer someone gave me the
insight that weed might help her led me to starting to grow and just trying to
apply sort of scientific methodology even if it was just observational and
note-taking to kind of just production to see if I could grow more with less
and I don't know what else are you thinking?
Very specifically you know your unicorn. Nick's got an amazing unicorn.
Okay so then yeah so I ended up with this three to one high CBD high limonene
genetic that is clone only and basically did really well in the medical
world but in when it went legal because of where we are I was more or less boxed
back into kind of the black market which ultimately does not favor CBD anything
unless it's just hemp which they'll spray with distillate and so now even
still having chased a license for several years that's when I met Ray at
Cydia Weed in meetings. Now hemp is almost occupied this place where I had
found decent luck in the medical cannabis industry and you know that's
what I was licensing up in Oregon. Oregon at the time this is pre-hemp. They did
have people looking for like higher medicinal sort of ratios and ultimately
led me to meet people like Trevor, Breeders Best which I don't know if
there's other groups out there that are just trying to do the same thing but
following kind of like what Ray was talking the academic model of licensing
which is where Dale Breeders Best kind of comes out of anything else Ray? I can't
think I'm shoveling snow so. I can tell I can tell I think we can all tell you're
shoveling snow. Thank you Nick. I really appreciate it. Nick is a dear friend and this lemon remedy that you see in his
PTR there it is a very very special thing that that he found you know in the
course of his life and it's been an interesting case study to be
tangentially associated with and you know I count Nick among my dear friends
and he's a great great guy so I want to thank you Nick for giving your anecdote
there. I feel like it's a singular sort of example of kind of what we've been
talking about this evening. I agree I just want to say that I've thought of
you Nick. I met you actually a couple years ago. I actually remember standing
with you and Trevor at CanMed like two years ago and chatting and I am a big
fan of like type 2 plants mixed ratio cultivars and I did feel like the lemon
remedy really is the unicorn and it's unique and special because of the
limonene dominance and it's really it's really amazing medicine also so I still
feel like there is a place for those things. Oregon is just like when you
were talking about your experience of trying to license into Oregon into this
market it's like what we we have and have won multiple awards with is like a
type 2 genetic here and honestly I feel like we've just grown less and less and
less of it over the past few years because the market is just not mature
enough but the unfortunate thing is is it's just such powerful medicine for
people so I really my hope is that the overall industry as legalization keeps
coming more is that we get to a place where type twos can be appreciated and
I've joked recently I'm like sometimes like we just need you know something like
big rapper or burner or somebody to just say like hey yeah type twos you know get
that because it's what you would introduce your grandma to if you were
going to introduce somebody to cannabis you're not going to introduce them to
like some you know 28% high THC type one I think that people get scared off
sometimes especially like new users and I think something like lemon remedy or
you know there's multiple other type twos out there that are just really
powerful so I've thought of you and I will say that the rules have changed in
Oregon also we had a legislative change that is going to allow us to bring in
and actually order seeds from different seed banks and and this is a huge huge
piece but it's something that producers in Oregon within the adult use market
had to petition for because you know it's like very clear that the only way
because you're gonna fall behind in the market especially in like you know
California is always like I joke like a year behind California and as far as
like the genetics that are popular and other things but everybody knows it's
all like loopholes is how you know how how do we think that every new legal
state that comes online suddenly magically has all of like the brand-new
hype cuts in their regulated market it's like it just the horror I want to do a
whiteboard of just how allegedly broke or all the regulations and how our
system has been operating because people are people are still doing all of these
things without the licensing without the other piece and I think that our
regulations are just really forced a lot of weird behavior that is not you know
a it's not compliant but also it's it's just very interesting to observe just
how exactly things are happening so I hope that we get to a place where we can
you know have a more streamlined system where you know somebody can grow
something like a magical you know I can grow something that Anthony bred and
that is you know allowed within the system and and then I just want to say
too is there is a new technology and I'm still very hesitant to name this company
because I just have had a few meetings with them but there is a new company
that's saying that you're very ethical that you're gonna get to be able to
control your data basically but that they will do like say you have a breeder
and that breeder has the original cut and you can basically fingerprint that
and then I can fingerprint what I have and then we have a third-party
authentic authentication that it is indeed what it says it is and it
requires us kind of I think teaming together is what I realized because I
was asking like they're like oh we can authenticate what you have and I'm like
well you can't actually authenticate what I have unless I get you know I
would need to send samples from the breeder and from our genetic library as
well so I think that we are heading in good direction but I hope that people I
don't know we've got miles to go still I guess.
Welcome Caleb. I yeah it would be a good time for you to introduce yourself and
also to discuss some of the ideas that you've been working on around copy left
and IP protection that are some alternatives and just real quick want to
say Nick Lemon Remedy it was great meeting both you Evian and everyone we
met up with down at the medicinal genomics conference and the lemon remedy
is great medicine I'm not a big fan of mixed chemotypes to be perfectly honest
I like I grew and bred with them just to keep CBD genetics around for years but
um never really smoked them myself but we did smoke all of the lemon remedy and
I smoked it with Birch Raymond knows my buddy Birch and he too like me is more
of a type 1 cannabis smoker but he he was quite fond of the lemon turps that
you get in that in the lemon remedy it's a accurate characterization and
name you know it's always disappointing when a cannabis variety is called or
named after something and the particularly fruit flavor of some sort
and it doesn't actually match but the lemon remedy definitely matches so good
good cannabis there and without further ado Caleb sorry love to hear about your
work man I was gonna jump in actually and just continuing the conversation and
I'd love to touch on what we're doing with the copulist cultivars nonprofit
and the copulist cannabis project but just I wanted to also touch on and you
know many of you here I know a lot of you I don't know as well but from all
camps I'm hearing the common word or sentiment of change and this is a
sentiment I hear a lot in our community and coming in an emerging market that's
had so many layers and the game board is continually you know shifting on us the
rules and regulations are changing I come from a medical growing background
and so you know it's a very different world and I think each of us have where
we started in this journey and the change that has happened but as some of
you know I also worked in the green energy world in technology with
extremely high value intellectual property and was involved in some
extremely high value intellectual property of litigation and the change
that is coming as an emerging industry as cannabis is an asset as the names of
cannabis and brands are assetized and the infrastructure of the legal system
starts to apply and be usable and open up we're gonna start to see this change
happen a lot faster and yes so I commend the sentiment of coming together that I
am also hearing I'm hearing a lot of references to community a lot of
references to building these systems and this is something that I've been saying
for a long time in the community is like we need to come together it's the old
analogy of the bundle of twigs right if each twig can go and do its own thing
but then come together in times of stress they can't be broken as much as
each individual twig can be so creating systems that allow us to flexibly do
that and protect maybe each other as well as our own knowing that like we
gained a lot of these strains a lot of these cultivars in the flow from people
that couldn't assert rights right and so they had no other choice but to have it
go into the commons or have it be lost either at the end of their life or at an
unfortunate circumstance many of us have experienced that and now we have these
benefits but we also have the benefits from their work carrying that forward
and I think that that really catalyzes this community so with copula of
cultivars we're just trying to create a part of that some resources and create
community commons that unites readers and cultivators and researchers and then
creates this community that allows protections to be put in place that
protects the commons that's the system of copy left I've given some
presentations on that in the past and I don't want to drive the conversation
necessarily into the legal nuance but there's various protections we can give
various certifications and I think working with other systems some of the
other people up here are working on some really great systems that I think making
these cross compatible making this cross compatible with research databases and
you know the sort of work that medicinal genomics has been doing as well that's
another huge change coming in right as much as the change from huge fund
players and you know pharma giants and these these huge corporate breeding
players coming in is going to change things the genomics is also going to
change things and soon it's going to be affordable enough for us on the ground
individually to also do genomics and start to do this sort of certification
and verification in a grassroots style and I think that's really empowering it
so yeah using the time that we have the tools the collaboration with each other
this is a really powerful empowering time and these are the conversations
that are really important so yeah thank you all for being a part of this and
like let's keep building this so it's so nice to actually hear you Caleb because
I think Trevor mentioned your project and I know that I mentioned it to my
fellow colleagues and board members with the ethical data alliance and you know I
think that we have a lot of allegiance we both have nonprofits that have
basically been working on this very similar vision and trying to utilize
technology and it's it's kind of like a gift back to the community and I see
that within your work and I was really excited to see that you know you seem
like kind of maybe started what you were doing around when we started what we
were doing after the whole phylo state thing we saw a need for the community to
to have and it basically goes back to Providence this is you know I think the
gift back is how do we make it easy for people to prove you know that you have
what you have and that you know somebody's growing what they have and it
comes back to and I think the genomic piece is really fantastic especially
having solid genomic companies that we actually can trust it's like a huge
piece and we're getting that now so I would love if you know and I just want
to say to our nonprofit is totally open in the work that we're doing and we just
got a grant recently from Filecoin to help build more of the technology because
they believed in our vision so that we can actually showcase this from the
breeder with the genomics to the producers all the way through the supply
chain so it's open to anybody these are fully transparent projects because we
saw what went wrong when things weren't transparent with other nonprofits like
the OCP specifically so I really just want to encourage collaboration and
Caleb I would love to speak with you more I'm not sure if you talked to
Mitchell or Christian on my team but I think that there's a lot of I think we're
stronger together and I really appreciate that you have a similar vision within
this and I think that I hope people see that it is like it's a gift back to the
community and that's maybe how we how we can stand a chance I get again some of
these larger corporations or the the laws and the different regulations that
just are so whack honestly that we like we need each other so I'm happy that
you're here. Yeah thank you so much and yeah you're guys this project is
definitely one of the ones I was referring to as one of the other
projects I think is leading the way on this I'm really interested in I've been
looking into the stuff you guys are doing with Filecoin and the possible
implementations of that sort of technology are have a lot of power in
the realms of provenance and preservation you know it's like the
multiple sides of preservation is the physical but there's also the data and
the freedom and the community preservation so yeah I'm absolutely
about connecting and I'd love to continue building that bridge I'd love
to also open that door to anyone who's listening and other people here on the
panel as well to continue to build this bridge and continue to build a coalition
here because you know really it may seem like we're in competition on this level
but we share so much and we our success is so interknit and the players that are
coming you know we really we have so much more in common I think in working
together than we have in fighting each other especially when players like that
are on their way so I would even open the door to you know some of people that
are doing patent work and other even more privatized work I know it may seem
like a cognitive and protected open commons approach is in some way
adversarial but it's absolutely not that we can all work together in a defensive
coalition I've heard Dale Hunt talk about this in the past and you know
building a coalition defensively of interconnecting these different
protection systems and that is absolutely something that our community I think should be exploring
I think that there are some amazing IP plant patent lawyers that their whole goal is to help
us with the provenance piece and that we have the ability so Dale and there's a handful of other
lawyers that I highly respect and I used to be highly opposed to patenting plants but then I
started to you know come around to realizing that it and especially like on a national or
international level and like what's coming in the future that some of those tools might actually
be very very useful for especially for small breeders especially actually is where I see that
it can have a lot of impact so I appreciate you saying that because I think there are you know
that's the conversation right it's provenance and how do we establish that and I think sometimes
we need to remember that there are tools people have been doing this for a very long time in other
agricultural industries you know so you look at blueberries or you look at any of these other
things it's like there are there are models in place that could actually work and I think I
still appreciate what Raymond was saying earlier too that there are also models that maybe don't
work and we don't want our Anthony's you know that kind of conversation so I think it's really
up to us and I think that leveraging technology and IP protections is where we're going to stand
a chance with provenance and I think that it is the best way for the little guy to protect
themselves against bigger things and it doesn't have to be incredibly expensive I think it just
needs to be clever so I really like that conversation. Yeah and bouncing it back to you know
what Anthony and Raymond and others were saying if we don't define this ecosystem if we don't
create this new idea ecosystem which is really just a protected and and kind of mesh work grassroots
interconnected protected system community wide ecosystem it'll be defined for us you know the
way that things run and there's a way that things run in most businesses and I've experienced that
in the green energy technology world and it was not pleasant it's not the world I want to
live in in the cannabis world and I think that's part of what motivates me here to do this work
I think that we really do have the time right now that we won't always have and the power that we
have right now especially with all of the great breeders again a lot of the people on this panel
I'm sure a lot of people listening having just fantastic genetics and fantastic strains and
you know even fantastic brands that have been developed and so yeah the power and the timing
is in our hands. Hey I have a question for Caleb I'm okay it's been cutting in and out but
so I didn't hear everything he said so I apologize if he already repeated this but
as far as copy left goes you know I kind of caught on to this there's a have you ever heard
of Strainly? Strainly is that website that you know allows breeders to sell seeds on and
they've had some information on the open source seed initiative I'm wondering if you guys know
about that or can speak to that? Yeah I can speak to that a little bit so Strainly in my opinion
has been a great ally in this work and I've been conversing with them I think that their
like license that they produced is a good framework and we're integrating elements from that
into ours as well so I think that there's a lot that we can learn from groups like that also the
Aussie or the open source seed initiative they I'm in communication with them they are generally
supportive of what we're doing they have decided to stay out of the cannabis field specifically
and so they ideologically support projects like us and we've gotten some great insight from them
as well and definitely I want to support anybody who is breeding vegetables or food crops do take
a look at Aussie the open source seed initiative they're doing some great work it's not
genetically backed and it doesn't have all of like the deep interconnected features of a like
a breeding management software or anything like that but they do have like some of these legal
protections that we're talking about so I think it's a great first step for the food world. Cool
thanks Caleb I appreciate it. Yeah absolutely and thanks for asking and you know not to
divert the conversation into my specific non-profit you know I think that we
there's going to be a lot of different approaches right and we need to start getting clever about
these things you know we need to start leveraging the power that we have but you know thinking that
we're going to take it on individually especially taking on the huge changes and the huge forces
that are are shifting and coming into the industry just by ourselves is you know I think
foolhardy so really the only way is to bond together in these networked ways. Yeah for sure
you should you should contact me after maybe afterwards you know I run I'm not sure if you're
familiar with the Cannabis Horticultural Association but I've been building this for
the last five years it's like an online database for plant science and do a little bit of advocacy
so you know I could probably help you know get to promote that message so maybe give me
get a hold of me after this. Yeah absolutely will do. I just want to say congratulations to Connor.
Connor you graduated you did it right like you're done so it seems like hugely exciting
I think Connor you're such an asset to our community and I'd be curious like how what you
the work that you've done and you know I know that your thesis or whatever is it just all kind
of ties together because I think that that's one of the things we really need is like we need long
term preservation we need tissue culture we need your we need your your light so it's super stoked
that you're going to be coming back to West Coast. Oh Evian you're so sweet I actually I completely
forgot I was up here but yeah I'm super stoked to announce that after a while I finally graduated
from Cornell University with my master's on doing hemp micropropagation and we'll be moving to Santa
Barbara in just a few days to start with a very respected tissue culture company and I look forward
to sharing that with all of you very soon. But yeah I think tissue culture is great for genetic
preservation for multiplication for breeding purposes a lot of different things so I look
forward to being back on the West Coast and working with all of you much love.
Hey congratulations
You guys are the best I love the community.
Yeah I can't wait to see what you do Connor so stoked to have you stoked to get you back on the
West Coast and out of out of Cornell I know that's been like a real journey for you too so
excited to see what you do.
Plain accomplishment brother congratulations man. Yeah I'm sorry I'm so checked out right now I
literally had my defense just a few hours ago and I haven't slept in a couple days so it's probably
way lower. Like you had your defense earlier today? Yeah yeah yeah dude. Bravo dude. Dude I'm so happy
I'm glowing right now but I feel like a zombie but anyways I'm gonna shut up but much love guys.
Thank you so much that's that's really just great great feels super excited.
So yeah we'll uh reset the room um we have a great panel here with us um
um yeah I'm sorry I've got kids yelling um
I will if uh Tony you want to help reset the topic and get us focused on on the topic that you help
suggest? Yeah no problem um today we're talking about basically the uh labeling knocking off of
and the uh basically hustling of the cannabis community through the easily uh
accessible worldwide web is really what's happening and then
everything that comes from that actual deed happening. So today uh we've we've been going
over quite a bit of different stuff from uh the actual sourcing of the seeds to um what happens
once you're the breeder of the seed and how you keep that from getting out but it seems like we're
getting to a point where it's almost impossible with the way cannabis is headed um even if we do
lock in a system there's still the end user that isn't educated in the first place that's searching
something out that somebody's gonna try to take advantage of them. Yeah but somebody said it
earlier man there's counterfeits in every industry the most mature of industries right I mean like
yeah you're always going to have people trying to fucking scam and make a buck but
at the end of the day the integrity of the knowledge base is a broader topic. Provenance
the interesting word right provenance means a lot of things um it applies to sourcing methodologies
it applies to the aesthetic and experiential composition of the end product I mean it's just
runs the gamut right it's really it's a great topic um thanks for having me up here this has
been a lot of fun I mean I'm down to keep chatting but on that point though Ray because you're
somebody who can kind of speak um I mean I can to a lesser extent but um you're very qualified in
talking about another set of IP protections those being Appalachias and geo indicators and the way
that communities come together to protect cultivars or varieties in their specific localities and how
we can kind of develop this as another sort of method for establishing provenance because
as you just pointed out the Appalachian system is much more um specific to that whole range
of provenance both the yeah not just the basic marker set right exactly yeah
but um yeah man you know I'm I'm gonna keep it very uh topical because I don't my my
I'll keep I'm gonna keep it dry I guess for lack of a better term it's governed by a set of UN
trade treaties that cover the types of metrics that go into
validation of what are called geographic indicators in their broadest sense and those
geographic indicators can be applied to the sourcing methodology and also at the other
end of the spectrum to as I said the aesthetic or experiential components of the end product
they prescribe a series of analysis metrics to indicate what is termed a causal link between
link between product and place and that's kind of the money shot um how
cannabis fits into that modality which and there's some parallels to that modality with the
AOSCA the CEED certification sort of how they think about the analysis of those metrics um
although more in like a marker sense and less than uh you know
the je ne sais quoi wherever that grape is grown um
anyway all that to say um provenance can certainly be established through a variety of means
and the AOC uh which is one of the primary European models uh and the AVA which is the
uh and the AVA which is the primary American model and the hybrid models that govern
viticulture in places like South Australia and South Africa and South America and the
Mediterranean of course um can be looked at uh there's some parallels to be had with
uh beer production there's some parallels definite serious parallels with um high-end
liquor production um in terms of like agave real scotch from different places you know um
port wine right that's the geographic indicator like port from Portugal so anyway I'm kind of
rambling if anyone has any specific questions I am here thanks thanks for the thanks for the uh
preface there Tripp. I have a question um I would be curious uh Ray or and pretty much
everybody I mean on the panel and Trevor, Anthony, everybody is um you know like what sorts of
solutions or technologies do you all see is the you know because obviously like this is an issue
so I see a lot in the industry that we have a ton of issues um and it's like how do we create
solutions and I know kind of where where I've been focused my energies and I've actually
I'm curious because I see the um I see genomics and I see molecular breeding and I wish Ryan was
here because I'd be so curious his perspectives on this as well but um I guess basically um you
know what are some of the solutions to some of these issues that we see across the board because
um how do we leverage technology I was recently um you know inquiring with somebody who owns a
genomics company like how do you feel that you know these genomic markers or fingerprinting or
x y and z can actually help with the issue of provenance for um these different issues and
they basically said they didn't think that genomics was the solution and that was really
a curious um from somebody that is a plant geneticist I was very very curious to hear that
they didn't actually think that was a solution and I've heard other things from other people
within the genomic space so I would just be curious um you know what thoughts are there or
yeah if anybody has opinions on like how do we create a solution to this uh this prominence issue
I'm really going for the jugular there I like it
well I think we need to define some level of scope on that right because um like what are we
uh trying to trace it kind of reminds me of like with 23andMe and as you dig into the genomics of
it it's like very vague in terms of uh the archaeogeology or um the genetic archaeology and
these other elements and so um we define like oh there's a certain time period in the past where
then um say my ancestors were Irish and these other ancestors were were part of this tribe we
now call Cherokee and right um etc etc and then we maybe assemble self-reporting and trace it back
so are we kind of defining it based off of of where it's been bred for are we defining it
more based off of you know um where it has coupled best with wine there's an interesting history of
like these Benedictine monks who just obsessed about tasting dirt in their monasteries and
went around France and tasted the dirt and paired it with the wine varietals to get them to
to grow properly you know this kind of mythical French story of uh provenance and Appalachian
origins and uh you know with cannabis it's so rapidly changing um are we going to tie this
definition back to you know land races and then there's the debates about what is a land race how
do we define land race right this gets uh you know a little bit difficult to define so I think we can
only really answer that question on any given scope you know yeah I can I I could refine the
scope down a little bit too of the question so it's like just going back to basics so you know
and and obviously this is I'm not asking this in like the legal IP terms which is different when
I'm asking like IP where like how do we do this you know because there's so many different models
of how you can protect your work essentially but I'm just curious or like for example somebody
here on stage has bred something whether it was bred from um you know land race genetics or
different things within their their library um and then they they have seeds and they want to create
some sort of protection or they've um you know let's see let me how do I bring it down even more
so you breed something you have a cut of something and then you know you want to do some sort of
uh the ability to prove that provenance it's like how what are the tools that we could use to
showcase like this is um you know this is something that you have this is something that you want to
market and protect or that you've bred and you don't want it to be white labeled by other people
like is there a potential way to release seeds or cuts of different genetics or different cultivar
um what are the solutions to how you can release something in a safe uh in a safe way and then also
the supply chain traceability issue with either selling seeds or with flower those are kind of I
guess it's a big topic I guess maybe I can't refine it I don't know I mean it's kind of like all of
those things and how how do we do that you know how do we utilize the tools that we do have to um
uh to help move this like create a solution to that establishing provenance question
um there's a lot of different ways and I think we've touched on some of them um like as
commercial genetic sequencing has um in terms of the phylos model created a lot of trust issues
um there's and really like I've been one of the obviously I was a loud person I wasn't the only
there was a lot of people out there talking about phylos many before me um but the for me the issue
isn't really genetic sequencing or like there's not all that much that can be done with it it was
more phylos specific way that they did what they did and the way that they were deceitful um that
created the ethics issue I don't feel as if you know there's all that much to fear from
doing genetic sequencing particularly of genetics that are already out in common circulation um
you're not putting something into the public domain if they're the things are already out there
um it would be nice to see the price point for sequencing come down to a point where it's
practical to do whole genome sequencing for entire varieties or excuse me cultivars and
you know have those on the blockchain have those up on the uh I can't uh the NICB um
I probably just butchered the acronym but the uh national database where all genomic sequences are
held up on the internet upload them onto there have them on the blockchain have the price point
come down to a point where it's reasonable to do whole genome sequencing of like a unicorn like
Nick's lemon remedy and make that more generally available and accessible is one solution we're not
there yet but from what I'm hearing uh COVID's having quite an impact on sequencing cost across
the board and so sequencing cost are coming down significantly and as people talk about like
there's the exponential rate of computation or whatever um there's similar rates of expansion
in sequencing powers that are going on right now in genomics so that's something that can really
revolutionize things once we get down to the point where we can actually get beyond just doing
you know a screen for a couple thousand SNPs and can start doing complete genome sequencing
of our samples when we find something unique. So if I if I may
what you've posited and what what what Connor spoke to and it's part of the equation is like
the objective like the you know slightly more scientific sort of analysis of provenance but
you know I think I think it was Caleb talking about the historical value of provenance where
they were tasting dirt right like they're not tasting dirt that's like a primitive chemical
analysis and so if you look at it on that sort of historical like anthropological timeline
provenance has a objective maturation that we are able to discern but it also has like a subjective
historical component and cultural component so like provenance is more than just like is this plant
you know genomically different than this plant it's about if you take the same
same exact grapes right like Trevor heard me tell this analogy where we met at the
California Department of Food and Agriculture's Cannabis Appalachians Committee and you know
Appalachians were pissing matches between farmers you grow the exact same plant one guy has slightly
different water and one guy is slightly different sun and at the end of the year the product
experiential component for the consumer like I brought up earlier is completely different even
though it's the exact same plant right so there's a subjective component and there's an objective
component I think in answer to uh Evie's question there you know how do we fix this uh we craft that
narrative to where provenance and cannabis is much more akin to the AOC model where it has to do
not only with the underlying stability of the genetics and where that breeding came from but
it also has to do with the subjective components in terms of standards of practice soil composition
watering methodology topography declination of sun etc so you know I think we know we have
to do we just have to craft that narrative and make sure that it is an integral component in the
conversations at a policy level that are really going to dictate this shit for the next 25 to
30 to 50 fucking years thanks for coming on my TED talk and what you mentioned there with the
pissing match you're talking about with everybody because of the sun and the soil input that all
comes down to lack of education on the grower they don't even realize that a plant has multiple
expressions based on the environment they hear words but they never experience I meant that in
like jest I meant I meant it in like hey listen we grow the same but it's actually what's happening
right that's exactly what's happening everyone's having a pissing match over shit that's already
related to each other and trying to be the first one in there that the system comes down that no
one's educated enough to even understand provenance in the correct terms of the way we're going to use
it policy regulators to understand what yeah the people that are going to be regulating us haven't
even been around the plant that we want them to help us regulate right some have but they understand
the macro concepts that govern provenance on a broader scale than just cannabis and so just
how do we teach that to the consumer though it's sort of the same information delivered slightly
differently but just to be very clear in terms of the pissing matching allergy I meant that very
much in jest like okay we got microclimates up here I grew for 10 plus years 2015 we got
microclimates up here we would have the same exact nursery stock and you know have different
products at the end of the year even though the nursery stock was literally the same clone batch
so there's a subjective land-based standards of practice based you know sort of expression
differential from genomically identical material genetically identical material right I mean
that happens because most of the material that's being passed these days is a complete mess of
polyhybrids that are going to have right 27 different phenotypical expressions and the
the grower doesn't understand that and the the consumer doesn't understand that and definitely
these seed banks that are selling knockoffs don't care about it that's there's the whole problem
that we're facing we're all looking at it as a definitive thing and it's not because of the way
we've been going about breeding and offering cannabis to each other since the late 70s well
as soon as people started to hybridize it's certainly not unilaterally appropriate in the
conversation of provenance it's where we do the provenance so in this just like the 50s and 60s
we start getting these land-based lines that people start to work but nobody passes the
information because it was against the law to write this stuff down to have a book of information
to pass it you're going to go to jail when you get busted for more time for having that information so
we started off on the wrong foot because no one started it by writing it down and then when we
did start to write it down it came from the memories from the past from all of history
i know but we we want it regulated people are like in the chat everyone's arguing over it's not
stabilized it's not this it's not that and it's not going to be because of what you're purchasing
if you're going to purchase polyhybrid pot of whatever that's what you're going to get if you
were looking for a package of charlie kush then you have to have the education to know where to go
to look for that which breeders are offering this to what end well that's that's the provenance if
you don't look for what you're after correctly instead of trying to find what you're after
you're going to always end up with the incorrect product at the end if people there's people out
here that know this and we're all some of the old guys are starting to die off and we're losing them
and people are still fighting over the information that those guys pass because they don't want to
believe it because they're they believe the history and a pack that they were passed five
years ago and the five years ago is completely bullshit compared to the provenance of a plant
that other people know has been here for half a century when you can bring that information up and
bring it people have to stop arguing over what they heard in 2008 and 2016 and dive into the
information and take the people that gave it to you out because that's where the cannabis community
gets this all messed up they don't like the person that offered the information so therefore
it has to be wrong instead of trying to verify whether or not it was right or wrong to start with
that's why you get five companies selling green crack and none of them are the plant that made the
lion famous or that's why you get skunk one that became famous in the 80s and then started getting
replicated through the 90s and the 2000s and now we're 50 years since that plant was first produced
and everyone thinks they know what the original was because nobody passed the actual information
with it because in the original times you couldn't and then when you were able to it was wrong and
now it's profit time and whatever we can sell and hype the most is what sells and it all comes down
to mis-education of the consumer that ends up becoming the breeder who now joins a system that's
regulated by people that also had no clue or care for what came before what's right here right now
all right people believe that a plant tastes like the name some everyone's growing cookies and says
it tastes like dough it doesn't taste like dough people grow plant that says lemon and three
quarters of the progeny don't have lemon profiles because all the breeder did was mix two names from
two packs and the plants that he used were heterozygous for the traits he was after or he was
trying to make a mono hybrid or a dihybrid and he wasn't able to do this through breeding because
didn't put any work in all he did was put one plant in with a female and offer those seeds
and this is where you have to find out how the person that you're purchasing your stock from does
his work and everyone's getting more quiet about it as we become more legal because of the price
of cannabis and what someone's going to profit off of my work and there keeps getting worse and worse
if we don't join together and offer the provenance of what's really came to us right or wrong if we
don't know the information of a plant from 50 years ago that's what should be passed with that plant
until today they do this with other plants you don't rename a plant because you popped a seed in
in Kentucky right doing that is illegal once a plant has been registered in the system
we as a cannabis community are the most childish set of people with the plant and the way we go
about wanting it passed to us we demand this truthfulness we demand integrity and then we
accept nothing but bullshit from a system because none of us will agree on a specific system like
I'm willing to agree to anybody else's system it doesn't have to be mine but if we don't put one
together we're going to lose out in the long run because we were having this piss and match over
which was the right way like what's the provenance of stuff we're fighting over stuff we shouldn't be
on this state committee with Trevor and I because we did we did we tried anyway oh I don't doubt you
did there's people out there they're doing I've done this I know a lot of people that have
but the community in whole the consumer completely hasn't done any of this and they don't care about
it that's the whole point I know that's our job too that's our job too man well that's what we're
doing here that's what we're doing on shows like this we offer that information so that the people
know that there is false out there and that there is real and they can make the decision because we
can't force anyone to pick someone that we know is correct and that has the provenance we can only
give the information and hope that information allows the consumer to pick that source instead
of trying to be the brightest and loudest we should be the most mentioned maturation of industry
in all industries I mean tea coffee beer wine booze consumers are increasingly educated and
there's always a connoisseur class of consumers and that knowledge base trickles down and there's
lots of ways to sort of massage that but the end of the day provenance as as I said I think one of
the important things to remember is that provenance is both objective in terms of genomic clarity
and lineage but also subjective in terms of the fact that a particular product can be grown
in a place in a way that produces
a quantifiable unique product so how do we fix this like how do we establish provenance in a
broadly accepted way is by adopting parts of models that are used in other industries to
establish provenance and draft a modality that is accurate and reflective of the work that's
gone into the development of those standards so you know there's a lot of ways to skin the cat but
it's got to be done yes I think that's really valid and if we copy uh those systems we're going
to get the same results as them and I would question if we want to get the same results as
with uh for example standard agriculture where a lot of small farmers have been gobbled up and a
lot of breeders have lost access to their own work you know simply because of the disparities of a
system that that wasn't set up in a clever or or just or or intentionally ethical way but more you
know bought and sold and you know I mean we see this playing out also right now with psychedelic
legalization and psilocybin mushrooms and not to divert into that but I think there's also an issue
you know with um now there's been the Oakland psilocybin cup which starts to bring information
together and starts to give labeling but um this is you know not exclusively a problem to cannabis
you're totally right and it's going to have to be kind of done differently for these emerging
markets coming out of the black market we have just so much what's going to be considered assets
uh appearing out of nowhere like has been mentioned several times in this discussion
and uh you know that along with a number of other factors is really going to complicate things
and then yeah ask ourselves do we want the uh same results as we've seen or or do we want to
maybe play with a little different I think open software uh open source protected software is a
really good model but still you know we need to customize it like you were saying and you know
work uh together with other models and but uh at least in that model we've seen the large
corporations like Google uh for example or Apple even now like defending uh the community freedom
and uh you know going to court to assure that these licenses and these community rules are
protected and respected um which is you know maybe not perfect but is a step in the right direction
yeah and I uh just kind of dovetailing with um Anthony's and Raymond's discussion like there's
there's cannabis history and the cannabis history is connected to the provenance of a lot of different
cultivars and varieties that are still in circulation today and I think it's kind of
our responsibility as people who care about that history to you know maintain it and to
curate it and you do a great job Anthony on your page you've posted a lot of the different
reputable for like so much of what we've produced is either a it's not really an oral tradition but
it's like a forum a written tradition on online forums and other sort of you know there's seed
bank catalogs there's a number of different old magazines or books that document some of this
history and if you go through the forums and you spend a lot of time on it you'll see the same
things recurrently popping up the same posts the same discussions that are being recycled over and
over again because they're valuable information and they've made their way onto almost every forum
out there a lot of old timers like old timers bonsai mother technique Mr. Soul and Vic High's
discussion about breeding countryman's post about STS lots of different posts are out there that
have just kind of like been recycled and like reposted and gone viral before that was necessarily
a word and we can you know you do a good job of that Anthony I try to do a good job of that you
know a lot of other people are out there trying to curate this history and it's important that we do
so and also get in touch with and talk to a lot of the older heads while I was writing the old
timer piece a couple months back he suffered a stroke while I was writing it and it made it much
more difficult to obviously to communicate with him and you know I had the the pleasure of being
on with Coot the other day like there's a lot of different members in the community and a lot of
the tradition and history that's been you know the provenance that can be maintained somewhat
through the subjective tradition of a culture and a community passing down information and
we all have a responsibility of maintaining that and it also creates an alternative record to
the objective sort of you know genomics data like a lot of people were able to poke a lot of holes
in phylos's galaxy just because they had a lot of access to information and knew a lot of the
relationships and the genetics and so or even if it wasn't like a conclusive like they poked a
hole they were at least able to have a substantive debate with phylos representatives on the
accuracy and veracity of the galaxy and so we need to maintain that history and that sort of like
tradition and you know we're never going to like we're never going to get rid of bad actors we're
never going to get rid of deceitful people but we can point people in the direction of those who
help to try and curate information and do so by producing their source material and trying to be
as rigorous as possible in their their curation of history as it is and you know I think also
as Raymond's pointed out like
there is a
there's a mechanism in place that through appellations where while these systems aren't
necessarily like a regulated agricultural system in California is like even more fuckered off than
than regular like the right to farm in California gives farmers who farm traditional agricultural
crops all sorts of carte blanche to do whatever the fuck they want were regulated under prop 64
prop 64 is a fucking clusterfuck but one of the few things that is nice in it or potentially
could have been a good framework for empowering farmers to create a very specific product and
experience for end-use consumers was the appellation program and you know if everything
weren't such a clusterfuck in California that program would be one of the things that
you know once future legalization happens and exports happen would differentiate California
from a lot of other places because we do have long-term legacy producers who have been growing
in areas that are particularly well suited to cannabis cultivation but the regulate regulatory
situation here has been yeah not great. That's an understatement.
I can't imagine all of the history that's been lost to bad regulative regimes
over all of cannabis history right I just always dream of there being some reserve of cannabis
history from you know like what we call the development of land races in some trove in
the desert or something you know that it would be a lot like finding you know like a hidden page
off of one of these old breeders books that they had tried to bury somewhere you know
that sort of discovery but this is you know we really are just increasingly becoming more certain
about these details of the plant and able to document it and kind of coming out of
of this extremely age-long dark age with this plant. Hey y'all I just wanted to say thanks
I'm gonna step away for the night. Thank you for coming on Nick it was really good to reconnect.
For sure I'm glad you're doing well.
Take care everyone. Trev keeps threatening to come up and visit Nick so hopefully he does that.
Come visit anytime bring your snowboard.
Nice thanks for the invite man I definitely will make it up there someday soon.
Thanks Nick.
One love I see you've come into the room welcome always good to see you man.
And you gotta unmute yourself the YouTube chat is doing bong rips with the dead air moments so
they're appreciating this time right now. Bong rips?
You know I'm glad I'm not the only one.
How about we had another topic as well which is a look forward to 2022.
I've got some breeding projects going right now that'll be popping up in 2022.
I'm working on my mud bone project and I'm also working on some reversals with some clone only
stuff. I've got the Bubba Kush and my mud bone in the tent right now and I've been pulling pollen
off of those. They should be getting plants in about four weeks. I've been posting some of those
on my Instagram and my live feeds on YouTube. So folks if you guys want to tune in and watch any
of that happen with reversals if anyone has questions while I'm doing that you guys are
glad to tune in for that kind of stuff and hit me up anytime. Man I'm gonna do that because I've
been stuck in paperwork world for about three years. I haven't actually fucking
other than my personal like grown for three fucking years after 10 plus of growing every day
and uh let me tell you from the other side of the table this paperwork world sucks.
I feel you man.
Times are changing.
Times are changing. I'm also trying to put that mud bone into a regular form and F2s
so that they will be S1s and F2s of it available which is something else that um I've been showing
it's something I like to show. A lot of people ask about breeders uh doing work right and I'm one of
the cats that is out there trying to do that and I wish more people would do the same. Do a live
video. Show yourself doing what you're doing. Show people how you clone plants. Show how you make
your recipe for your STS. Prove to the people out here that you're actually doing it. The provenance
we ask for is easily put out there these days with uh all these video apparatuses that we're using.
I've been putting up public breeding projects since 2011 and since cannabis went legal in 96
there's just been far too many people not doing that. Like the more we put ourselves out there
and show that we're doing that work the less we have to spend time proving it through arguments
and stuff like that. So this is something I wish a lot more of the breeders that are in our community
do. There's tons of us out here. A lot of cats like Trees was on here earlier. Family Trees,
Dutch Booms. A lot of cats are out there showing you exactly what's happening. Kevin Jodery doing
that with his skunk work. You can actually see the breeders doing the work on the plants that
you guys are out there looking for as consumers. Don't just settle for uh we'll use cookies because
it's out there but it's been out there for over a decade right. It's starting to become something
that is just basic smoke. There's so much more stuff out there for you to get your hands on.
Don't just look at the menu board at your local collective if that's your only access.
You know that there's a worldwide web out there that you can go find some information out and
find out that you can get the cannabis lines that can help your sick and dying mother or your
grandmother that has cancer. You don't have to give her high THC right or your grandfather that's
suffering from PTSD. That dude doesn't need to get hit in the head with some uh hardcore OG's right.
He's an old cat. Real basic. Type 2. Yeah that's where the education forum comes in because people
that first come into it just think of it as cannabis. I worked in a club and when cannabis
went legal doctors started telling the patients like I can't tell you to use cannabis but I've
heard things about cannabis is how it started and people would come into our clubs. Seniors I'm
talking cats that were in World War II. People in their 70s and 80s. This was back in around 2008
and they're coming into cannabis and never had used it other than to be told it was evil. It was
going to turn you into something bad right and they would come in my club and be afraid to even
ask questions about it. So if you're not open enough with your information and how you do things
it's actually detrimental to some of the patients that are actually coming into our system. This is
why I'm always hard on people about quit hiding and show what you're doing. We're in a legal system
you guys are using old world reasonings for not showing what you're doing. If you're really a
breeder you should not be afraid to show people those if you're going to sell them the seeds.
Right if you're giving them away that's one thing. What you're describing in a much broader sense is
information dissemination and you're talking about spreading knowledge and that is one of the most
fundamental duties we have as humans to educate our fellow man and woman.
And like particularly on the consumer end it's hard because teaching people is hard.
Right like education is a very difficult
concept. I mean how do you reach people? So those of us that are
involved in this conversation how do we take what we glean as what ought to be disseminated
and do so. So there's two parts of that process right we have to like
conceptualize and sort of crystallize a message and then choose a dissemination methodology.
So there's two parts two components to that conversation of course.
The codification of the knowledge base seems the easier of the two given that as we described
earlier some of it is objective genomically and some of it is subjective. So we have to
understand what's objective and what's not. So we have to understand what's subjective
in terms of cultivation methodologies but there are metrics in place to you know
whatever can yeah it escapes me but you see where I'm going with this right.
Yeah I understand what you're saying it's hard it's going to be something
the people that were interested in cannabis that came to me for information because they felt like
I was a source of knowledge for some reason. Once they wanted to be serious about it I had to take
the role of a teacher right which is to say that yeah well not for some reason because you fucking
know. Well I know but I'm just saying that it comes down to the only way someone can learn is
they actually have to want to right and you can look at our chat right now there's a lot of people
that don't want to learn they're just too. Wait there's a chat? Yeah on YouTube there's a chat going
right now live with our show it's there all the time so you can read what's happening right. So
that's like some of the stuff I bring up is tied to what some of the people are asking in chat but
when you get people that are constantly just not being serious about a plant that is being used so
seriously that's where the problem with the education comes. They don't want to learn about it
they don't turn off the jokes they don't turn off the bullshit and they don't turn off what they
think they believe when they show up to learn something right. It's not like we went to their
house to learn they showed up at our house and now they want to piss in our pool party
and that's what's happening in the cannabis community. They get high and then nobody wants
to pay attention but they're always saying they're trying to learn and shit and when we try to give
them information they end up fighting over whether or not we told them it was an indica or sativa
we tried to explain to them the words and how other cultures and other plant categories don't
use those words to describe a medicinal effect of a plant. So they just won't take it serious when
it comes to the time to be serious. We could be funny all the time but when we want to learn about
something and track it and make sure we remember it that's the time to settle down and relax and
figure out whether or not we're really interested in this shit or not. If not we tune out and leave
and if we are we sit down and learn and too much of that doesn't happen in our community because
to ask someone to be serious about cannabis is to be a pariah. They tell you you're they start
trolling your ass they don't want nothing to do with you. Really? Exactly that's what happens is
if you read it happens way too often there's just far too many people. Do you don't need that kind
of bullshitting in your life? Well nobody does none of us do and as as cannabis consumers. Hey dude ain't nobody
coming to me with that bullshit. Right and as cannabis consumers. I'm sorry we don't know each other I apologize.
We all say that we don't even want to act that way right weed's supposed to make us calmer it's
supposed to make us happier it's supposed to make life more peaceful and then we spend our days
sitting there arguing with the next man over some bullshit story we heard from the last bullshitter
and I'm always on people about that because I came to cannabis because my grandfather died from
cancer so I started breeding for medicinal effect the plant had to do what it had to do or that
plant had to go right and that's why I fuck with cannabis. I also get high on the side but that's
not why I breed right I smoke weed to get high I breed to make medicine and if other people say
that's what they're doing then I expect that out of that person and we get so many people right now
in our community saying that's what they're doing and that's not what they're doing they're just
fucking around taking advantage of sick dying people because there's always going to be sick
dying people we make more people every day we're not going away we're the product we're the consumer
we're everything in this thing that's what makes cannabis different nobody's using corn to stay
alive nobody's using tobacco to stay alive right the cannabis is used for the chemical makeup of
the plant so when I talk about phenotype that's what's changing the chemical makeup of the plant
so you could take my cutting and grow it at your house it grows different than my house
it's different plant so that where the medicine is available from the person that can grow it the way
you need it so that's where you got to tie into the grower and the education of understanding that
person just like people do with wine just like people do with coffee with cannabis we don't do
that with cannabis it's more about shining and looking like we know it and giving that to everybody
and our community won't ever they don't seem to want to change this has been happening repeatedly
since the computer came out you can go read the old forums and see how many people are fighting
over the shape of a plant and what to call it because the leaf looks like this or you must be
full of shit because I smell this terpene in that plant and that's where the education comes from
nobody seems to understand that this plant is the plant of a hundred and a million molecules
my plant can smell just like your plant if I grow it in the right condition right my genetics might
be able to produce yours if I know what I'm doing nobody wants to take the time to do that or learn
it or share it on a on a scope that will be productive for the next generation or for the
next sick person because I'm a crippled ass motherfucker right I got half a body being cut up
I'm gonna die real soon I'm gonna be gone before most people that I know but I'm trying to leave
something here so the next dude that's like me that was like my grandfather that was like my
grandmother these people all died from cancers from sicknesses being handicapped they didn't
die because of a wreck they didn't die from uh falling out of a tree this shit hit them the
whole life they were uh hurt they had to suffer and at that time there wasn't cannabis there wasn't
anybody trying to breed the Lebanese or the tie together to try to get a brand new terpene
profile that's going to help your friend that's got leukemia or who has MS right it was just cats
getting high and then as we keep going no one's getting serious we're just not serious about the
plant that could save so many lives we're just too worried about branding uh high test numbers
uh it produced it was a six percent like all that shit don't matter when it's being used as a
medicine when your grandmother needs to isolate that comes from a plant she doesn't give a damn
where it was grown as long as at the end product can relieve her of her cancer of her leukemia
of the side effects of the cancer that's what's coming and we're not being serious about getting
that and that's the problem with what's happening right now we're going to lose the ability to go
that direction when we have to follow the direction that's coming we have to get serious
today we should have done it yesterday if we really want to have the future of the tomorrow
we dream of we look at this every day as every state goes legal and then they lose their ability
to grow cannabis in their own house because now it's regulated and they don't think you know how
to grow the weed correctly right it's happened ever since 1996 in this state in California
and every state after does the same thing and nobody will pay attention to it they just keep
repeating it they're going to do that until it becomes federally legal because of the 1961 treaty
being ratified once they change the scheduling of cannabis on that the rest of the world has
already decided that they're using this as a commodity while we're trying to use this as a
way to shine on Instagram that's the majority of what's happening in our community not everybody
but that's what's going to drive it if we don't try to steer it in a different direction
and we guys like us that are up here all of us the ladies we're the ones that can help steer that by
holding the people that come to us for the questions and the answers to a little higher
standard than they came to us with right if you leave acting the same fool why do I want to help
you when you come back the next time is there's something more important here than just making a
joke and that just just keep constantly what's keep happening we all every time we have a show
it ends up breaking down sooner or later how the chat just is the craziest Jerry Springer looking
shit ever and that's the immaturity of of cannabis from people that are 50 and 40 and 30 years old
right the world's rough but sometimes you got to be serious about shit and cannabis is one of those
times when you're breeding it when you're trying to prove that it is what it is that's the time to
be serious Anthony I think you bring up a pretty good point of not following intent hello everybody
I've been listening tonight's chat's been awesome there's been so much especially about the subtypes
like brought up and such that I think is a good look conversation but uh on the current look topic
I mean you couldn't be speaking even more relevant to the times this morning Juana you know like
announced uh that they're um you know like releasing the first it's a crazy kit too because
I was just talking to someone this last weekend about cannaceuticals um they're releasing their
first essentially uh if you will pharmaceutical style um uh you know product and it's a fit
or it's called fit and it's an edible that is um that is uh THCv
um based because there is research um showing that you know THCv helps curb the appetite
um suppress and or uh they are the appetite um uh or that it is an appetite it's an apologize
sorry I'm totally I've been listening this whole thing I'm out of it but yeah long story short um
you know they're they are the first now to kind of claim a full use and you know the sad reality is
there has been so many cultivars in the last I'd say 25 years alone that have that have died
because of you know nobody um spreading the proper you know like intention like granddaddy purple is
a prime example I've sat in so many dispensaries and heard somebody say oh I need something for
sleep and then somebody's oh I have this granddaddy purple why because it's purple
if you actually knew what you know it can like bread it for was not for sleep whatsoever and
sure as shit it's died out why no why because people aren't going to sleep off granddaddy purple
like and now you don't really see it anywhere because it's not being used for you know back
issues ghost pains and uh he had a bunch of like stomach issues too um and I'm sure that there was
like you know some other things that I you know that I don't even know because I don't even know
the full like story of it all and it blows my mind that you know here was this medical patient that
bred a cultivar and and one thing that like I like always like to highlight is is you know the
the the draconian days that were kind of like crawling out of um were produced some of the most
medicinal most medicinal cultivars because people couldn't keep shit because it was hype
they could you know you kept things because it had a purpose or there was a really good reason
because of space you know you didn't want to go to jail for having too many plants all these other
things so what was kept was really really legit and they all had a lot of like really good use
cases but over time like it's been brought up now you have all these cookie strains right how many
cookie like cultivars do we have and how many of them can you actually say like this one is good
for this not many like I get the whole idea of like cookie cultivars I mean if you look at the
terpene profiles they make complete sense for like western culture you know like you break them down
you know the beta-lacarofylene lime you know like limonene and you know like you can go into like
the terpene science I won't like sit here and ramble but like yeah they make sense but you know
there's a ton of that there's a ton of it and now really nobody knows why they're using it because
nobody had any intent but now here's this random company and people are going to start you know
complaining as these large companies come around and they start backing up you know their you know
their products by minor research like Juana's about to do and they're making the first one
they're going to make a shit ton of money off this because you know how many people now are
going to go oh shit I want to lose weight I'm going to go buy me some Juana edibles
they're going to go buy like there's a whole hip diet you know everybody knows how much in you know
like the whole diet and so I guess my whole point is like I totally see what you know like
Anthony's like saying is like we've lost so much and now there's going to be people that are going
to pick that up because nobody's paying attention to really the original intent of whatever you know
the original you know intent of what everybody was doing if you are a breeder that's where
you know I agree with Anthony you should be saying everything like hey I use this because
of this reason because you might actually have some unique chemical profile that you want to
start documenting a use case for in the beginning so you might be able to go back and be like hey
like I I said this back then this is mine you know that you know this is what I'm using it for
because we don't know I mean personally just opinion I think that's kind of how it's going
to be I mean we all say it's a pharmacy and a seed millions of different tools you want to make
sure that your tool is documented so you can you know use that I guess and nobody jacks it from you
and there's been a lot of that or just the fact that tools have been thrown aside now
because you know they weren't used in the right sense people were trying to use a screwdriver to
pound in a nail it didn't really work but anyway so I'll get off my love the whole chat tonight
yeah what's up everybody one love here a great chat tonight the importance of provenance really
makes me think back to when I really kind of started geeking out on breeding back in Hawaii
and the people I've encountered over there you know like just hitchhiking on the road and running
into some super old cat and you know pulling out a joint and splitting my wig back with some
tropical and I'm like man what's that I mean he's like oh it's some cone of gold and I'm like oh
what cone of gold like you know I'm a stoner nerd I've never tried it before at that time and I was
like oh wow what's like so like what is cone of gold you know and he goes this is some old cat
he's just like you know well back in the early 90s I got some Colombian gold packs and there
were some seeds in it and I've just been open pollinating it every year since then and this
is what I got and I call it I've been calling it cone of gold for the past 10 years and that's that
gentleman's experience with that variety and what he called it because he lived in South Kona
now is that really where Kona gold comes from I don't know but that was the story that I was told
from this gentleman's experience and so it goes it makes me trip on provenance and like how many
you know growers and just people who are growing and not like breeding to breed to release seeds
but like truly growing and making seeds every year so they don't have to rely on external
sources you know these people are from Hawaii I got so blown away with the knowledge and skills
and passion with the people in Hawaii doing their thing you know at the time I was there
excuse me there was more there was more cannabis cultivators per capita on the Hawaiian islands
than any other medical state and just to just going back to provenance is like you know it's
the story and I think the story is important and a lot of people get hung up on like the reality or
like oh that's not how it is because it may the story may be different for somebody else just my
two cents something that I was thinking about provenance is definitely important respect everybody
you guys I really love the discussion this has been an awesome conversation
thanks to everybody here thanks to these cannabis project and Peter and thanks Trevor for
inviting me up and everybody else on the panel all the viewers I'm going to jump off
hope you all have a
hope you all have a
I think it all the also goes back to you know Anthony what he constantly says is educating
the consumer you know however you can through your own experience through their own experience
and that's kind of where I'm stuck on is how to educate the consumers and I feel like we're all
just kind of echo chambers here talking to like-minded or semi-like-minded individuals
about things that we're very passionate about you know but when I go talk to you know somebody who
just likes to smoke cannabis and they really don't care what it's called you know they're just
shoulder shrug they're just all I hear is the shit at the dispensary isn't like what I can grow at
home or what my buddies can grow at home is like so why you know why would I waste the money there
and you know going back to the education of the consumers I don't think they care what it's called
I think they more care about the effect and you know as we as consumers breeders
voices you know in an echo chamber or not like what how are ways that we can educate consumers
to care you know I mean I feel like I care about what I put in my body but I still see the effects
but I still see lines out the door at fast food joints so you know it's like I think that's where
we're coming to as people who are passionate about cannabis it's like those who care will
educate themselves enough to know and those who don't are just looking for something with effect
um I think that brings up a good kind of or kind of crystallized a distinction in my own mind
that I've kind of been meandering around all night there's the commercial market and yes we need to
or not we people who are operating in the commercial market licensees absolutely need to
tell their story tell their narrative and inform consumers and conform them inform them in ways
that you know expand the range of options beyond you know the cookies model the cookies model has
become dominant in California and it's also you know proliferating throughout legal regulated
states across the country as everybody claims and you know there's a lot of people who are
in the country as everybody clamors to kind of replicate whatever's hype here um that model is
you know like people can play in that model and can operate within that model and others have
you know there's connected alien labs but it's a relatively constrained you know market space
and the people that are operating there are highly highly capitalized and so small farmers
in particular need to differentiate themselves and create alternatives and beyond that
I think we need to be focusing on developing community like
maintaining and preserving the culture outside of the
uh market space and the regulated commercial market because it's
far more outside of like when people aren't forced to make their decisions based on the market but
can grow cannabis that they like they can grow a far broader range of types of cannabis and have
far less constraints with what they do and we need to create the tools to facilitate that and
to get cultivars that are already out in the public domain that are sort of legacy cultivars
into the hands of home growers so that home growers can have the experience of growing
with these elite clone only varieties and so that more people have the opportunity not only just to
grow and experience the flower but we distribute these more broadly I know that there's been a
history of hoarding or sort of gatekeeping access to clones and I think that that's something that
we as a community need to get over and we need to get things out into people's hands and distribute
them as widely as possible so that one they're not lost you know obviously backup and tissue
culture is the ideal method for backing things up to the extent that we have them still but
distributing them within your network if you don't have tissue culture is the best alternative
method for keeping things around and I think we need to encourage that we need to encourage people
to cultivate their own you know in California it's six plants unless you have a medical
recommendation from a doctor that allows you to cultivate more than six plants um but people should
exert those rights and try and defend them wherever possible and really develop a home growing
community as an alternative to the commercial market because I feel like the home grow community
has a much better chance of sustaining and maintaining sort of the cultural dynamics and
unique germ plasm that may not ever get an opportunity within the commercial market.
I love that I came back right in there that was great uh sorry I had a work call come in that's
awesome Trevor I don't want to say to people that are opposed to home grow you know it's like that
then he says you know like watch out for people they're opposed to um home grow or states and
as they're not people online well there are actually people um there are people no no no I
mean like yeah yeah they're corporations but I I just want to say on that note I just wanted to
say because I meant to say it earlier in the conversation is the hop slate and thyroid piece
and like making sure that people are keeping the um you know keeping the cultivars and the genetics
clean within the communities and you know just when we're passing around cuts and other things
I think it is an it is an issue that can throughout the industry um create a lot of
problems and there's some really uh affordable easy testing solutions to make sure that you're
you know that your cuts and your genetics are clean when you are sharing them amongst that but
yeah I think that I love that home grow is um like states that don't allow that or you know
really sad to me so I love that concept if anything it helped stabilize Oregon's market as the prices
you know started to climb after like 2017 everyone was trying to get to Portland I tell a story
and like literally grams of like flour were like hitting like 20 dollars in Portland I thought like
24 at one point it was ridiculous and all the locals were like yeah why are we buying from
this market when like our you know we all grow way better weed for way cheaper and you know the
market regulated because everybody stopped buying from the dispensaries except for the tourists
um and you know there's other reasons too you know like a big flood but you know like at that
same time what it was like literally like you watched across the river Jay Inslee they were
having the same issue their market you know was tanking because people started going back to the
legacy market and Jay closed down home grow and it blew my mind that nobody like lost their shit
about it and still to this day the fact that nobody pushes it like I mean I think that most people
don't care they still grow but like still it it kind of blew my mind but yeah it definitely
stabilizes the markets because if it gets out of hand you know people aren't forced to go there
which is fantastic. I'll also say that I think there is nothing more powerful than and liberating
like being able to grow your own medicine as like a former herbalist and just with plant medicine
I know that for myself when I personally have cultivated various types of medicines that I feel
like there's something where it's just something so empowering about it and I feel like I feel the
same way about food to be honest and I feel like it's hard for me to believe that there are people
out there that have never actually like picked an apple themselves or grown their own food or seen
what you know and I know that a lot of inner city schools and you know previously I taught gardening
to children because I really believe that you know it's a viable career path. Agriculture is a
viable career path for people on all different fronts and it's such an important empowering
thing with like food security but also I believe that like medicine security you know it's like
having medicine accessible for yourself and then also being able to and I think that I believe it
was Anthony earlier you were you know pointing to just you know I like how you you continually
point back to the importance of people having access to like the medicine or you know there's
a consistency in the medicine and that's one of the biggest issues I see with this the provenance
piece too is that you know it's like if people are looking for consistent reliable medicine
that is something that needs to be available for people across all different fronts and
sometimes learning to cultivate it yourself is great but I know that that's something that I
personally have strived for and part of why you know keeping the same genetics over and over again
and having you know a long-term consistent library where you're offering the same things to people
is that you have consistent medicine for the community for the people that are going to
purchase from you if you're you know a large-scale producer because it's like it's not just about
this isn't just about getting people high this is about providing quality consistent medicine for
people and that's hard to do in cannabis cultivation when you look at historical data you look at the
same cultivar across like six years especially with like outdoor greenhouse light deprivation
it's very hard to actually create consistent results and so many different things can
can play into how your genetics come across you know so I just I really think there's a
important part of the conversation is consistent medicine and that's actually one place where I do
feel like indoor sometimes stands out it's because you can replicate the same environment over and
over again and I mean obviously I'm preferential to outdoor but and greenhouse is my absolute
favorite but I do feel like there I used to be opposed to indoor until I realized that it was
such a great way for people to get consistent stable medicine and yeah I really I love to teach
people how to grow at home and I really want to see more and more people have the ability to do
that so it's a great thank you Trevor for pointing to that. Man, you brought up a lot of good points.
I would outdoor and indoor I'd even and I know this isn't the conversation but I would even argue
you know they are two different styles of cannabis medicine like you have a you know
disability outdoors of like this wild west kind of fight you know the plants kind of getting a rush
roulette of of you know like environmental you know you like stressors that bring out can bring
out a broad spectrum of like terpenes and you know the cannabinoids flavonoids and
and there is a use for that you know like you know I've seen people you know in the market that
do look for that you know they look for the most broad spectrum that they could find maybe not so
much targeted but you know I have had customers that come in to the store that I was in and you
know they would be like you know looking at everything because we had the the the like
terpene like profiles on the front of all the jars and they would specifically be looking and
asking for all the broad spectrum you know profiles and then when you go indoor like you're saying you
can really really you know target and repeat things and that's where I think you can have
more like controlled direct medicine like if if like you really know like where to put that tool
you know like instead of just kind of like I don't know what metaphor I'm going for here but
yeah you know they're both useful in cannabis medicine I guess in like two different ways
from my point of view so like I think there's plenty for both but the interesting part is like
they're both respectable very much so I think yes both have their place but the scale that
cannabis is going to come to we're going to have to have outdoor but that outdoor will be mostly
used I believe the best way for turning into isolates that can be used to put into
other products that indoor can be used for taking those specific genotypes we find and dialing in
those phenotypical expressions that will give us those chemo bar statuses that we're after
by using a repeatable soil system a repeatable watering system a repeatable light system this
can be dialed in in many different locations to be used to dial in the connoisseur quality of those
herbs and to make sure that in the flower form that we can get a very close to a repeatable
process every time those numbers won't be identical but they're going to be really close
but at the key move our status once put out into a natural environment pests can change the terpene
profile of that plant or the soil it's like the sun that Raymond had brought up earlier so many
different variables outside that can change the chemo bar status of a plant since it's just a
phenotypical expression so that's where we have to learn about the breeding part and then the actual
farming of that plant where it becomes the corn right and we're using it to sell it to people
as a specific varietal not just a genetic baseline that's where the breeders need to be educated and
what they're using where it came from what was sourced and then the consumer can educate
themselves much easier on which way a plant can be used to steer for the
fine tune and makes it the system a little bit easier. Totally and and and I mean I don't want
to get down to too deep of a rabbit hole like separately I guess but I hypothesized that we
might even get to a point where where when we're cultivating indoors we're going to start seeing
repeatable profiles that have synergistic meaning and I don't like in in you know there's a term
like growing an organ called you know canna-ceuticals essentially you know a pharmaceutical
made from a cannabis but uh because some of these chemical profiles are are kind of mind-blowing
in their in their natural like creation like all throughout you know like everybody you know like a
bone not to go like too deep but like mimosa you know is a unique cultivar itself the profile
like as I keep like studying it and a couple other people valencing really good for
for skin like cancer or in the cancer in general or and it's mainly and this is like research to
back up what I'm saying it's research from from the rhizomes of a specific plant that they study
this from but and then limonene helps kind of like get things through the skin like barrier
really well and sabonine which is really common in mimosa as well kind of comes from like cilantro
and like parsley and stuff like that carrots really good for like opening up the pores
so like if you were trying to use it as like a topical it's like all the main like terpenes
almost like are amazing for like a topical and I and and so like there's this like growing like
belief that like you know some of these profiles might be like marketable in themselves like hey
I'm gonna grow this to grow a topical or I'm gonna grow this to do this which is why you know I kind
of mentioned earlier like if you have a use case for what you're doing or like for what you're
growing but definitely talk about it now and start testing these things because it might come
to a point where like you know this set of alignment of you know like of you know the chemical
you know constituents like Anthony you know I guess saying we'll create you know like a you know
like a chemo var that might be really unique to the grand scheme of things and you don't want to
lose that or lose you know all that work that you did because it might be just something as like
simple as like it helps somebody with their like arthritis really well and uh you know better than
everyone else yeah cannabis science is incredible I guess my whole point is if you're using this as
a medical use really talk about it like really really especially right now because Juana today
really blew my mind I really didn't think somebody was going to come out that fast in 2022
and uh like be like here we're creating something other than just you know to get recreationally
um high off of or you know broad spectrum medical like they're actually you know putting a dietary
means to it which is I think a pretty big deal I believe they were just also bought out by a
larger company just wanted to throw that out there I'm not 100 certain but I know that they've expanded
greatly but I'm fairly certain my memory serves uh if my memory serves correctly that they were
just bought out by a large company that um yeah interesting to see the direction um I love the
idea of the you know like the medical piece and I really also um will just keep thinking about
Trevor what you were saying when I came back into the room about um
just the how it kind of like a way to keep that genetic population um and the cultivars
circulating in a different avenue because I I mean I know I've felt that a lot for a long time
that if you have um something that you really care about you can't be the only one especially
just with the hot slate and fire rate and the other things it's like that there you know like
there are things you gotta have people you trust that are also holding your stuff because things
go wrong I mean stuff happens knock on wood um not very often but um I do feel like it's just
so incredibly important and I would love to see um more ability for um home growers to just have
like really stable solid things and I really see also that that is a potential um I love the I
believe it was Jeff Lowenfelds wrote that book in the past few years that you know about like
autoflowers and just how I kind of do see that in the future potentially that you know that's
going to be a really easy accessible way for um just novice home growers to you know have access
and obviously that's a different thing it's not saving genetics but it is you know within the
feed domain it's a really cool way for people to to get to get to play with some of the incredible
genetics and all of the progress that's happened over the past few years so I would love to see
that I actually am feeling like it's inspirational um especially because I've been uh teaching with
Oaksterdam and it's really fun at first I was feeling like oh my god we don't need more do we
really need more cannabis growers and then I was feeling like well yeah actually because people
you never know what sort of innovations or different things that just um like the the novice
or home grower um the just the questions and the perception especially around the genetics or
what people are seeking out is really um it's so cool it's just such a cool thing and I hadn't
really thought about it as far as genetic preservation also but I'm now seeing the
importance of like you know this people this medicine belongs to the people and um I think
at the end of the day uh that's why we're all here having a conversation around provenance right
so I like that conceptual I'm going to contemplate that
and I'm complete. Thanks Evian yeah I agree I think that that the work that Oaksterdam's doing
and has done over the years educating people and giving people the tools to go out and grow
has been incredibly helpful the forums obviously taught a lot of people um that's something that
it's really like markets have certain like there's a reason all of this shit is happening
you know like this uh Ryan's been on on different uh episodes and been like well yeah because like
corporate interests and corporate models have certain methods and there's a decision making
calculus that every commercial operator has to go through and it's one that doesn't necessarily
prioritize or support biodiversity or provenance or maintaining genetics and that's something that
people that either are very very committed to it or figure out some way of wetting their
business model to reproducing these sorts of broader sort of social goods because they're not
it's not a corporate you know bottom line sort of motivation that drives this sort of
endeavor and so that's why I think it's so important that we need to in whatever capacity
like it really sucks that there are commercial cannabis operators who you know came from
legacy operations who have opposed home grow operations in different states I know it was
controversial in New York I know there's efforts afoot in Michigan to restrict caregivers
rights and you know it's being led by different or the lobbying group that is doing it
has connections to a number of different cannabis companies that are sort of legacy producers and
that sucks and they should not do that but it's one of those things where regardless overgrow the
system has kind of been the the rallying cry for the better part of the last two decades and it's
worked and people need to keep on doing it I think now yeah we need to autos whatever whatever way
autos, fems, however we can get people to lower the sort of like barriers to entry I think is good
and really encourage the distribution of seeds and cultivars throughout like two novice growers
and like yeah they may reduce the overall like they may not grow it ideally but getting them
I know that even though a novice grower may not produce genetics to the highest level you're going
to help them out immensely by giving them that foot up and giving them the opportunity to really
see what exquisite cannabis is like even if they don't produce it at the highest level
they'll have some inkling of why certain genetics are seen as elite and more desirable than others
and yeah so I encourage people to spread the love that way. I love that concept I also really I
really really love the idea of I know there's a few different nurseries especially on the west
coast that it's like providing genetics you know also within the you know within the clone cuts or
TC or both you know kind of reality that people can experience that way also getting to like you
know the whole taste the rainbow and there is just something so special about you know
when you think about that a lot of people have never actually I mean I think we take it for
granted especially like I know for me over the past six years working within the regulated market
I know I remember you know when I was so coming from like the 215 days in California and just this
piece of coming to you know thinking like you know 99 plants was a lot we thought that for a long
time and then we were like oh 2,000 plants was a lot and then it just like hemp has really given us
the ability to have scale so I'm seeing even within myself listening to you talk like that I
take it for granted that a lot of people haven't actually gotten to see you know you know live
cannabis plants in the ground legal you know regulated or even in your garden and just how
magnificent and majestic and how you know I really truly believe there are very I don't I honestly
don't know especially because I'm just such a plant person I love plants in general but that
if there is any other plant that holds so much incredible diversity and it kind of goes back
to the provenance piece also because it's like this plant really is like sheer magic when you
think about how many chemical you know different all the differentiation what do they call it like
relative chemo diversity existing within one plant is just it is surely mind-boggling honestly that
you can get so many different flavor profiles and mixes of all of these different things and
I'm always looking for other plants and I'm like does any other plant actually have like
this crazy amounts of terpenes that we have within one plant but then in all these different mixtures
and formulations it's just it's it really is something to behold so I think that when people
start to understand that and and from a breeder perspective too it's like I don't know it's
little exciting times to live in but also it's just like I think it's easy to forget just how
magnificent and amazing this plant is and how unique how unique what we're working with is and
so for home growers or novice growers to like really get to experience that on a personal level
is I don't know it's just like there's to me there's nothing more magic and I'm still I'm
still fascinated like Willy Wonka kind of vibe from earlier like we were talking about but
it's like I it still never ceases to amaze me and especially when I'm like now I'm looking
for flavor flavors and terpene profiles that are more freakish and unusual you know I'm like I
don't want what is trendy or hypey right now I'm like I want the thing that actually appeals to me
personally for medicine so it's kind of a fun fun concept for even breeders I would be curious like
you know it'd be fun to have one of these breeder conversations around like what are some of the
aims or goals for some of the breeders on the panel and like what are people looking for
because I know for me I'm looking for some some rare things that are I actually love flowers that
smell like flowers and that's not very popular but that you know you can breed something that
actually smells like jasmine is is pretty incredible to me so yeah I love this it's
a it's like kid in the candy store vibes I guess for us I think there are some people who could
answer that intent question right now you know like what I'm breeding for at the moment I'm
breeding for medicinal effect with the plant that I've had that I created in 2008 my mud bone was
the first time I created that that plant I ran through a ton of people that had MS or similar
neurological diseases when I ran a club so my project that I'm doing now is to try to get as
much of that medicinal property back in the plant so what I need to make that's why I'm making s1s
and f2s so that I can send those out to a group of people that have these same diseases I had
or either using the plant for their self specifically or offering it to other patients
what I want to do is make a large enough stock that I can pass those out for free I want I don't
want to profit off people that are dying and using a plant specifically for the purpose that I may
I've had so many people hit me up since I brought that up that for me that's that's kind of my goal
my goal is to bring back that power and that's why I have to find multiple versions through the
s1s and the f2s and if I have to go farther I'm also doing back crosses to both parents that made
the mud bone I have the line not the parent though on the male side because I lost that male
but I do still have the the parental line that it came from so I'm going to try to dive into
those to find out if I can find that same work popping back up and the seed line I'll send it
out to patients to test and if it works out the way I hope and I'll be able to pass those out to
people. Chase or Trevor? I'm sorry did you ask me a question I was watering plants wasn't paying
attention. Well just the general question was kind of like in your breeding what's your intent
like what what are you focused on personally and what directions you breed in is it
medicinal is it something else?
Currently I'm breeding for plants with high terpene percentages and also wash well
I'm trying to go with a another business model that is going to focus on just cultivation and
mechanical separation only just because Oklahoma has gotten to the point I know that me and Tony
talked about this the other day that you're able to find hydrocarbon CRC ran material in the state
for 22 grams out the door for a hundred dollars which you know for me I can't even begin to
fathom the level of quality of product that's going into inputs like that so for me it's
tremendously scary but I also think as a commercial operator that it's imperative
the quality medicine be offered to the true patients because that's the one thing that I
do kind of have with the Oklahoma market is that it feels very much like a wreck state
and there's not a lot of credit in my mind really given to the people that really made all this
possible which is the patients and I don't know if that's me being advocate first and a steward of
the plant second but at the same time I do know that this is the cannabis community and that we
do have to you know recognize that you know the the good and the bad attributes that we have to
deal with and I think that you know no matter what we're never going to be in a perfect scenario but
as long as we continue to do the things that we know that it's right and we continue to band
together and communicate you know that's just going to speak just you know a night and day
difference between what we could potentially have in the future versus what we could have had
if you know some of these states like California were never approved for the medical use of cannabis
to begin with. My main intention, hey Emil just a second, I'm downstairs with the kids,
my main goal and intention is just to work large populations and the different
different older varieties that I have access to. I prefer things that are
typically of the like 90s era and I associate that with the wide leaf sort of indica varieties
much more potent and sort of like couch lock. I like the gas, I like the chem, so OG's, chems,
those sorts of things are what I like to work with and yeah I just whenever I can I grow a large
population of whatever variety I'm going to use or select my males from and try and hit everything I
can both within the population and whatever else I have available at the time just so
kind of like what Ryan said in the past when the pollen's flying you should just get as much as
you can in there and you know I personally like the we as a community through selecting different
clone only's and trading them with each other have done a lot of the sorting and organizing
and that is very helpful so getting access to a lot of different cuts and hitting those with
your males whenever you're making hybrids or crosses is something I encourage people to do
just so that you can stockpile and bank as much as you can. So this is one love I'm going to be doing
some seed hunting from some things that I made last year but mostly I just like to make seeds
for my friends and family who really don't have the money to throw down on seeds or even are
weary about the gamble of popping seeds I'm happy to help them out when needed you know it's a
nice day and age we live in where I'm able to do that without you know the worries of the
forefathers before me and so I just like to pay it forward I've been gifted many beautiful things
from many wonderful people and I just like to pay it forward so I encourage everybody to do the same
with intention blessings. Yo shout out fam coming in loud and clear from Aotearoa New Zealand great
topic of conversation today I'd just like to say it's 4 20 p.m here in Aotearoa New Zealand
so if anybody's got one pre-rolled or got a pack of bowl I'm like lighting up my type 2 hemp
cannabis high in beta-caryophyllene because I've got a little bit of a backache and whatnot so it
helps me with my pain relief. I'm working on a hemp farm in New Zealand and not currently allowed
to have consumable smokable hemp products but that's what I'm currently working on some type 2s
with some flavors we have one line of compote hemp genetics and the phenotypes there's over a hundred
or so different characteristics that I'm looking at finger banging the plants and trying to get
those aromas and terpenes so yeah shout out from New Zealand I don't know if you guys know how hard
it is to get genetics in New Zealand up to Aotearoa but it's a little bit harder than going down to
California or anywhere else that's got a worldwide access. In the 90s I did have the luxurious to
taste the juicy fruit strain, the blueberry strain, the bubblegum strain, the diesel more recently the
choccolope, some strawberry cough any of the names do sit well with the flavors knowing that those
have definitely come through the correct pathways of seed markets illegally through our customs
but yeah we definitely get something that would be called bubblegum and then obviously not taste
like bubblegum and like you were indicating before with the skunk one strains we had the skunk earlier
on which was just any form of cannabis that had high trichomes on it and would make the
bag that you sold or purchased your cannabis in the trichomes would stick the flowers to the bag
and then that would be the called the skunks so yeah just a testament to how hard it is and to
keep those genetics alive and the trustworthiness of your friends and making sure that you do have
access to the strains that you want and keep them alive around in the close knit circles and yeah
thank you very much for your lovely breeder's round table thanks Peter thanks family thanks
everybody on the team future cannabis project down here in Aotearoa New Zealand whoop whoop 423
blaze it up that was our New Zealand correspondent checking in correct did you say that uh the
bubblegum that you got there did not taste like bubblegum or that it actually did because here
when we get it the bubblegum actually tastes like bubblegum it tastes like a pink powdery
bubblegum it's sweet it comes through when you smoke it it's on the scent it even will carry over
in the fresh hashish until it starts to become worked and activated then it'll start to become
more complex and change those profiles out the first strain of bubblegum i had tasted like
hubba bubba bubblegum and it definitely the aromas and the smoke in your mouth you were mind
mind-mended to think that you were literally chewing a piece of chewing gum and the smoke
had the definite flavors of a a hubba bubba bubblegum i don't know if you have this in America
but that was the flavor of bubblegum we had yeah that's the exact stuff we had over here i just
wanted to make sure i wasn't sure if i had heard you at my i was getting bad reception
all good anthony thank you for your wit
hey connor can you are you allowed to tell us where you're gonna work uh when you come west
i would like to but um you'll find out in a couple weeks very excited well we'll have to hang out
because i'm down in LA that's not very far away oh i'd love that yeah i mean i grew up in thousand
tokes and uh in Ventura county so i'm excited to be in Santa Barbara and and got a lot of family
and friends not too far from LA so yeah i would love that and uh Trevor, Tony, Chase we have any
any last topics you guys want to cover i think we kind of went over quite a bit of stuff today um
if any one of the other guys have anything that you want to pop up
and actually Evian and i i can i always feel bad because i'm like is it's not Evian is it Evian
but can you talk about uh a plant you enjoy growing uh for whatever reason that's not cannabis
if i could get my phone to unmute i can um uh yeah oh geez that's a that's a tough one um
geez another plant i enjoy growing well right now i'm really big on um i really am enjoying
growing hawks because i feel like i've been learning a lot about uh i don't know i'm just
a big fan of perennials and um what you can do with those i'm also a huge fan of growing grapes
as well but you know i love growing everything i've grown so many different things
i also really enjoy um greenhouse cultivation of cucumbers and tomatoes is really just super fun
and um i don't know i mean i i just love plants so i love growing so many different things that's
a really hard one for me to narrow it down to something else i enjoy growing because i like
growing food we grow a lot of food actually at the farm we devote a quarter of an acre
to food production and right now there's a bunch of winter vegetables um one of my teammates
actually we've grown a lot of garlic over the years and that's another thing that we just really
enjoy growing but having food for the staff and to give back uh i think we grew like 150 pounds
of tomatoes one of the past couple years so you know permaculture it's like i'm a big fan of
grow all the things you know it's like uh with polyculture as you can go is is pretty much um
pretty much the jam you know all the textures really are um or where it's at i really encourage
other cannabis farmers and i actually ask that question a lot to other um cannabis cultivators
is like have you grown something else besides cannabis and i would really surprise me the
amount of times i've heard people say no and i really encourage people to grow other things
because i believe that um you learn to be a better cannabis cultivator when you grow and
understand other things um more in depth and i really encourage people to um to do that not just
because of you know i'm not really a big fan of monocropping but just because it puts you in touch
with the natural cycles of life like nothing else does and i think that's why i started gardening
and farming originally was so uh it's like that endless cycle of life you know and i think that's
why i really have so much like i love the breeding and i love the seeds is because it's just another
component of um the cycle you know it's like this you know we're all gonna die at some point and
then senescence and the whole thing so um annual crops are really a great representation of the
cycle of life it's an awesome question thank you well so sticking with hops are there any varietals
that are kind of new on your radar that you find interesting for like i feel like a lot of beers
are coming out with just super interesting kind of flavor profiles that didn't exist five ten years
ago the heirloom variety so we have like right now i have like five different things growing
and my brain isn't totally there what i have but we were uh i was trying to work on some older like
learning about different heirloom i think i've grown maybe 15 or 20 different varieties of hops
at this point and you know nothing has really stood out to me i have a couple friends that make
beer and i was just trying to get more curious um i've used my hops actually to make tincture for
sleep so i'm not really big in alcohol right now but although i do love beer i'm not drinking it
but uh yeah i don't have anything specifically on my radar i'm gonna try to remember what the name
of one of the cultivars they have that is like an older variety that's supposed to have a more
unique flavor but um when you're making tincture you're not really i'm not really i'm not growing
them specifically for uh for brewing so for me it's more just about like the sleepy time medicine
um works really well for me so yeah that's awesome thank you for asking such cool questions
all right anyone with some last comments or thoughts or topics
luell cinder
peter i'd just like to speak of the terpenes and hops i used to work in the growing brew shop
and sometimes we would have smokers the growers come in and ask why our shop would smell of the
sticky icky icky and we would have to lead them over to the refrigerator where would we we would
have some freshly pressed hops open up the bag of hops for them which was high in humulin
and the smokers would be buzzing out on the likeness and the aromatics coming from our bag
of hops and how it would smell like a fresh bag of sticky icky icky testament to the hops and
cousin cannabis plants i mean i'm looking at one uh which is rojaca which is from new zealand and
has flavors of kumquat and grapefruit yes the hops market is somewhat tied up there is some form of
an in-house networking i mean if you've got a cutting of a hops plant that you can obviously
share with your friends but to try to get i think you just said chinook was it um i think the brewers
and nelson have those vines pretty tied up and legalities not so friendly and sharing with their
clones and cuttings well so that's actually i mean that parallels the conversation we just had
which is you know exactly it seems like that you know they're breeding in different directions and
when they find something novel and unique they're gonna you know patent the shit out of it right and
guard it and license it and all that well some of it too is like direct control like you can buy
hops from crager's nursery in michigan they have some of the greatest selection
and almost anyone can buy them unless you live in washington idaho or oregon same thing with like
citruses like you know with like florida you can't and they claim it's pest which a lot of it is pest
but a lot of it is also greed the same thing that happens in washington central washington you know
moxie is one of the largest hop producers in the world if you've had beer in the last like you know
10 30 years you've had it from central washington even a lot of europe now buys their hops from
central washington so they've like controlled it to a point where if you live in a certain state
you can't even get it shipped in just because they don't want you to start producing that within
their area because the areas are so fertile and so amazing for it they don't want the competition
or they just yeah it's like this weird greed factor to it or the diseases or pests you know
they don't want you know of course like but like that's for example and that might be the thing in
central washington too is like they don't want people to grow hops and get diseases and and like
pass them on but you know i would still argue that i mean given proper practices that really
wouldn't happen so it is still kind of like greed based yeah i just actually tried to go in the
backyard and look and see because the home is actually where i'm growing hops right now and
it was like trying to look and see what the varieties were that um that we have growing
right now and it's like covered in snow so i'm like i'm trying to remember i'm like what are the
names of what we're doing but i want something i've actually been fascinated and tried and failed
and i'm really been looking for somebody that is uh i've only ever seen it in photography is that
what you're grafting um cannabis to uh the hops root stock so that's been part of my little like
pet project of look to a company called cali seeds they've been showing that on instagram
they've been doing that for quite a while okay yeah there's a few i've seen photos of it and
i've seen other people do it and i've done grafting with fruit trees and i've done just
like tons of i mean i'm like i feel like propagation is just like i don't know it's
kind of an obsession at this point um especially at scale but i feel like that's some that's to me
that's kind of one of those things is like there's certain things like re-vegging that i feel like is
you know it's a challenge so um i would love to actually do more experimentation and see if we
get that to work i did a bunch of propagation with the hops last year and just gave them out
to people and um haven't actually done any of that but if anybody has experience with actual
grafting of those two things it would be fun to like i know i learned grafting from fruit trees
from like an old school uh biodynamic farmer who was my neighbor and he taught me a ton about like
grafting so i've tried applying some of those things and haven't really been successful
so i would be curious i don't know like i don't it's not the type of thing i have been able to
discover on google of like how exactly certain things you just can't find look at how it seeds
they've been offering uh that kind of stuff for a while he's been showing the crosses are the
graphs that he's doing with multiple different uh hops crosses to different cannabis lines
him and high grade movements that's the guy that's uh responsible for um freak show they both
have been showing some paperwork that shows uh some of the enzymes actually passing from the hops
and the cannabis um from the grafted scion sections they both have been posting some
paperwork on that um you can find them on instagram both of them i follow the mutant
people but what's that can you spell the other guy k-a-l-y cali seeds um he's famous for a line
that they released of hops that's called uh picasso it's a variegated hops line but he's
been using that and a few other of the lines to graft with cannabis and they're doing some work on
trying to see the interaction that happens between the two species since they're not going to breed
um but they can be grafted together you can 100 graft those two together for sure that's been done
multiple multiple times and has been documented there's peer-reviewed papers on that but the new
stuff that they're that i seen him posting just about a month and a half ago had to do specifically
with some of the uh chemical transferring of uh what's happening between the two species at the
scion section that's super cool yeah i mean cool yeah i'm just i'm just saying actually is altering
some of the uh i believe it's altering the dna or the rna that's happening between them
um on the way it's expressed not that it's transferring like uh the genetics from the
cannabis to the hops but the hops being grafted to the cannabis now starts to experience different
um stressors that are affecting how the genetic codes act express i love the idea of the
perennialization also i'm kind of fascinated by that so i'd be curious and i know we had a
conversation i i believe that the the guys were when we had that whole conversation and a few
like maybe a month or so ago about the um uh different genetic mutations and variegation
being one of those things which i've decided maybe is one of my favorite words also i just
i love variegated plants in general and i know that in different breeding projects
you know like different mutations and uh variegation is super cool so i'm gonna i'm
definitely gonna check that out and trying to find them right now because uh variegated hops uh
sounds like a really beautiful thing to grow also so i'm gonna check it out he has a few different
cultivars that show that variegated uh expression from the hops from i believe it's one of the
ancestors and mutations that i believe he found in the stuff that he was growing for a long time
on this site they sold it as being a actual cross of cannabis and hops and then that that was removed
from the site and now they show that they're doing the work with actually grafting the plants
together to get different expressions from the cultivars and then breeding with them in the
the actual grafted state not in their native state so if you can get the uh the dna uh the genetics
to express differently from the grafted scion then now you can breed with that to get a different
expression from the seed line than if you would have just bred with that plant when it was not
grafted and wasn't giving you that new expression so i believe that's kind of the work that he's
working on now to see what happens to the seed stock of both uh plants both species when you
actually go to breed with them in that uh that graphic state anytime grafted comes up i just like
to give like a towel out to i can't remember it's like professor sam van aiken it's a guy that did
the tree of 40 fruits if you guys haven't seen that it's incredible the dude has taken he's now
created i think like 16 of them and they're all over the country um but uh they're stone fruit
um like trees that he's like grafted and they all pollinate in um succession and like clockwise so
there's like a map and like you like can stand at it and like depending at the like time of year
a section of it is flowering and fruiting and the next is you know like about to go and it's
kind of like an art you know project but it's like 40 fruits and there's like 16 or maybe like
26 i know there's a six in there it's at least it's you know over 10 um that he's put like all
over the country and if you really want to see what like grafting looks like um and you haven't
i guess to the audience like that's a really good kind of example and it's really incredible
um of what can happen i believe his name is sam van aiken it says here on his uh there's a website
that shows the tree right here oh shit all right yeah like if there's a map or not like it's just
incredible it shows really i mean it blows my mind like you guys are kind of talking about this like
the abilities with grafting that maybe we um or just as like cultivators or farmers or whatever
haven't even tapped into yet it's a it's a crazy science and like just
you know kind of listening to what you guys are saying i haven't even heard anything about like
re-vegging so i'd like instantly want to start you know asking a bunch of questions but we're
getting late so i'm like trying to tone myself down but grafting is like super incredible and
i think like a whole nother show yeah i've grafted cannabis uh back in around 2000 of about six
i started uh experimenting with my uh my space kush line to try to oh i started off trying to
graft all of the phenotypes to the male and then because i kept the male and veg mostly all the
time and then i tried to experiment with grafting the vigorous females on my line together to try to
offer mother stock to people through my club that would be able to basically pick whatever they
wanted for their garden at that time you could put six or so plants on there they were allowed
to have six different lines i figured if i could do six plants with six on each one i could give a
person the option of 36 different cultivars nobody wanted to pay for them though they'd be they just
wanted to pay five dollars for a clone that took me like four to five months to try to produce it
to be able to get those to bring them in and then nobody wanted it but that's a pretty cool idea
though like i've i've like thought about this like if if you were limited on space maybe not
vertically but like you were limited on space um and you have like a big enough mom um like pot
and maybe like a 25 or bigger like you could really create like you're kind of saying anthony
like this like little library plant where maybe you know maybe for like a homegrower it's kind
of perfect because you're not going to be like completely wiping down you know each cultivar you
know you keep a couple and then like top it and like train it or whatever i guess there'd be have
to be some sort of like process to it but like the idea of it's actually pretty cool and i've
i pondered it but never like put it you know into play so it's awesome that like you have
like i mean does you think is it manageable i guess is my whole thing you can do it but it
takes a massive amount of work to be able to do that along with everything else i was doing
to do one plant by itself very easy to graft to it especially when you take related cultivars
like i said i used three different sister phenos to graft to one male uh pheno so that now this
plant had uh four different plants on it but it was the expression from the male root stock which
now like i learned later can have the effect of altering the genetic expression of the plant so
the plant i originally have once i clone it to this plant begins to express differently so for
a breeder it doesn't work well but for a homegrower that's under a number count right so you can only
have six plants and you don't have space to keep a mom so now you're supposed to constantly buy
seeds or buy clones which in the long run costs people money and it could be completely fake or
it could be something different each time to make it repeatable you give them one plant as a mother
that you teach them how to keep as a mother so you can leave this that section of plant that has
um is the base stock and then show them where to continue to leave the new part of the plant so
that when they take clones there's always that section left to re-veg so you can take a new
cutting whenever you do need it you have to do a lot of pruning but um if you're willing to take
the time to make sure you don't mislabel the parts of the plant that are different it's very manageable
it just comes down to whether or not the gardener wants to put that time into doing that but you
then you always have an option to grow a garden of six different kinds or one of one full kind
while the plant's still growing and you only have to give up one spot for veg while you have a spot
for five different females because there's so many people that are so scared that they're going to
lose their possessions because they put one too many plants into their garden so this was a way
for me to try to mitigate that from happening but when I said I had to charge people in the city
because I work at a club the club's not mine so the owner he's not giving up his shelf space
and he's not gonna let me sell a clone there because it's mine and without him profiting so
in the long run there's a price for that plant so if people just didn't want to pay it when they
could buy a regular clone for ten dollars they would rather just keep buying a clone or buying
a clone because they always thought the clone was going to be there and then eventually they shut
down all the clubs in our town and you didn't have access to clones no more and if you did not
keep anything from what you got before they shut everyone down you were stuck trying to buy shit
from some dude that now is charging you a shitload or you don't even know if it's real anymore because
it's just some random dude people started popping up and craigslist and all this shit pushing clones
so I was trying to think ahead of the system by offering something to people that I knew
eventually they're going to end up wanting you're going to want to have access to multiple lines
without taking up space and since then I've had tons of people asking me about it how to do it
is it possible and I tell them I did it and I've seen other people do it it's it's just you got to
be able to think ahead of the system and not just what's happening right now because so many people
are just worried about finishing that grow right now when they're growing cannabis they never look
at it like any other hobby there's never another end point besides that 30 day period right down at
the end of the you know it's going to finish I need to but I'm out I need some lean that's what
just kept coming so I tried to teach my patients this process like we take this clone you have this
access now you always have the plants I passed it to a few elderly people but again they just thought
of it as a call and they come back and buy another one I'm like I can't tell you another one it took
me four months to produce that one so I can't just keep bringing you a hundred of those in
I could bring you a hundred blue dream I can't bring you a hundred grafted mother plants
yeah ladies and gentlemen thank you guys so much for the conversation I'm gonna hop out here and
eat some dinner you're out of bed wonderful seeing everyone look forward to the next time
agreed thanks enjoyed the conversation everyone I got it about too it was fantastic
well at three hours and 45 minutes into the conversation should we call it
sounds good to be all right Trevor or Tony do you guys want to wrap it and kill the room
yeah totally thank you everyone for coming on it's been another great breeders roundtable
thank you everyone and yeah way to start off the year so look forward to doing this every week
4 p.m pacific standard time 7 p.m eastern standard time and we simulcast as some of our participants
found out tonight on youtube where there is a live chat go over there check it out future cannabis
future cannabis project oh two and yeah thanks any last words anyone
yeah thank you to our sponsor today crop kings
well played that was good man only available at uh dog a garden is that correct peter
yeah no that that I will not take any credit for them
yeah I appreciate everybody coming on and giving us information I love learning so much respect
to everybody congrats love being part of the future thanks Anthony for forward thinking
the genetics of mother plants of multi-strains I also too much like Matt have thought about
space saving and handing off four strains on one plant to the peeps and yeah it is a
a time of a value effort and people don't understand the time it takes to do seed grafts
but yeah great work Anthony great work Peter thank you everybody Trev chase Raymond Evian
Connor Matt everybody else in the downloads following love you love you all thanks heaps
New Zealand cool yeah thank you and uh with that I will uh I'll kill the room if I can
boom all right now that I have your undivided attention uh so one of the things I'm super
excited for is to finally have the um cornbread mafia conversation so Mr. Chad Westport is that
happening Friday night in the chat and then uh we're gonna have I possibly next week um
fungal consciousness
which should be a fun conversation yes Friday night and uh yeah by the way I'm uh
uh the only thing I've eaten today is my trader joe's ravioli
two-thirds of a bottle of wine and uh this is some free thinkers uh
this is actually so hemp does not really get me high at all but uh it's almost racy
like it makes your it's like it's like cocaine but uh
the back is uh I'm sure everybody has had like slipped discs pinched nerves
so in my back experience through my lifetime this was the
I felt like someone stuck a knife through my lower uh spine like literally I couldn't move I
it didn't hurt if I was um yeah no Nick is coming whoop sorry that's the wrong one Nick and uh
Chad what's his name the two name the two why am I blanking uh but yes Nick is coming on
and uh yeah Bickett uh but what's his his two-part first name but anyway with the back uh
it was yeah I've never experienced like it was I couldn't stand up so um but anyway
I can look it up actually no I can look it up right now what am I talking about
where are you recent email uh Chad you sent something
earlier today
yes there it is
uh Joe Keith Joe Keith Bickett
it's not Keith Joe it's Joe Keith and you may be no I'm uh
so what the chiropractor told me was it was um an inflammation of the joint
but uh yeah it was like 24 hours of not being able to move and then uh
now I can obviously move but um so that's I'm excited for that on Friday night I'm sure we have
lots of stuff in between today Monday and Friday and then also the my so sorry the mycelium um
this is what uh
I'm struggling right now the um
the father of modern
fungal everything
the older dude I did not blend up some fresh leaf uh Paul Stamets uh was talking about um
um
God my email inbox all right let me find that one
Nick Money so Nicholas Money from Miami of Ohio uh who's a mycologist who's done research on oh
wait we still got Chad's comment up my God that is a useful tool uh so anyway he's gonna talk uh
do basically do fungal networks have consciousness and uh I'm kind of psyched for that so anyway
with that everyone have a good
yeah spatial recognition by mycelium so like do they sense things and then I guess uh
uh what is consciousness right so yeah I think Nick's doing okay right now Brian is also doing
okay um and I didn't actually Alex I defer to you Common Vetch or uh Harry Vetch which one would you
I have nasturtium I have uh Austrian peas
but in the Vetch family would you do Common or Harry
and I think uh Strong Style voted for Harry but then said do both but I don't want them to
uh cross pollinate because I want to grow them out for seed
uh anyone
bit what all right so to grow out for seed and then just to give away to people so what
would other people appreciate most Common or Harry
okay we will go with the Harry
like me the Italian Vetch
the Italian Vetch
that is that is uh my kind of Vetch the Harry chested Vetch as my three daughters like to point
out so anyway with that uh and Alex yes set the 70s Bush the 70s Bush Vetch
um today is Monday so Wednesday morning we have Deep Thoughts by Alex Hardy and I like the new
uh graphic it looks like a like a uh stamp which is kind of cool of a of a a giggly man
a giggly man
so if anyone hasn't seen that check out Alex's Instagram
but I like the graphic that's all I gotta say and then uh
I see t-shirt I don't know what that means oh yeah yeah yeah put it on a t-shirt yes
yes that would be a good idea so anyway I'm gonna so I have the things that uh
so interestingly Alex you mentioned barley so I have barley growing outside for the life of me
I cannot get um or no rye uh I can't get
basically like the barley the uh
uh
grains are tough to sprout I'm like struggling like the barley was okay but then the um
no sorry the rye was okay but the uh the barley and I'm totally blanking on the other one
okay so if I'm planting it now the rye now
it's actually not gonna seed till June
which is fine like at least I have it going but the uh yeah no I pre-soaked and then it all like
it either gets mushy or uh it definitely starts to smell foul fast um
that's the um the barley and god oh the farro farro farro and barley yeah the farro and barley
like forever I keep trying like I have uh like Sonora white wheat I grew last year which is
just this stuff okay so it's gonna seed basically in like the early summer
um yeah I mean Southern California is very
it's confusing because things grow everything grows year around um
um so I'm kind of at a loss like I'm always like all right can I plant this now and get it to seed
or is it gonna like my carrots uh have been growing forever and they haven't started to uh
to go to seed um and then I kind of want to plant like I want to try to squeeze in a
tobacco run right now and I'm hoping that it would go to seed um
but yeah I'd be psyched if we all had a uh another just plant and vegetable conversation
I could ask all my questions I have my uh luobo
uh radish and my watermelon radish both starting to seed the um rat tail radish has already
seeded yeah so my carrots I'm just like I mean they're just growing but they're huge
uh so but yeah I'm uh my lettuce I have two different types of lettuce outside
yes yes yes yes that uh we gotta get that going um yeah I have two different lettuce going
going uh I planted sorghum which I didn't realize uh ah okay then that makes sense yeah so Peter
is uh at home with no wife no kids and he's not complaining about that
so interesting so my uh my asparagus like it grew and then it died and I thought I did
something wrong and then I realized that it's like what in year three that it finally
uh yeah I got the sweatpants are on the sweatpants the salmon sweatpants and the Myers Creek
sweatshirt
that's my night but uh
so that's for the asparagus as uh my daughters and I like to say yeah so I didn't know I mean
it's fine so that's what I think is cool I mean obviously some people like Alex know all this
know all this stuff but like for me I was like oh my god what did I do to my asparagus
um the the what the what's emerald cup famous
some peanut butter Peter brother Peter brother Peter butter breath um yeah no so it's interesting
to see that like certain crops uh because even um uh shard should take a while but like in LA
to seed but in LA I feel like
be like if I lived in New England still the shard would be like season two before it uh
starts to seed but because I live in LA now like it was within a year that I got seeds
um yeah no I agree I mean this is that that's the stuff that I like um
so Alex if there are any vegetable topics you'd like to cover or if Elka is still uh
he's probably sound asleep but uh
yeah no the the whole like I I and I I have no idea about other people's experiences like if
other people who previously like I got we had a garden growing up and uh but like I lived in New
York uh like college New York and then uh LA and like apartments and stuff and so it's only
recently that I've started kind of gardening again and it's just fun to just see like my
big thing now is just like plant something and just see what it does so uh yeah no it's fun it's uh
like one of the things right now I'm watching is I have uh from Tyler family tree uh some doggone or
uh what is it like cat beat hold on dog gone plant
yeah the scary sorry scaredy cat plant doggone like it's uh it's flowers or first of all it's
it's flowers or first of all it smells amazing it's it's like having weed in your yard and uh
it's I had pictures of its flowers but they're beautiful
can't be gone plant let me just see since I have everyone's undivided attention
or actually hold on let me see if on this phone I have some pictures
you can all bear with me
library I may have deleted them but it's a cool looking plant
okay I got a lot of pictures of my kids
yeah and I may have
I could show you all pictures of my kids but now I so I took them uh
no yeah no I don't have uh you know here we go cool perfect all right so check out
all right so check out
like that's a
that's a badass looking flower
yeah that that was I was trying to troubleshoot uh
the browning and the yellowing yeah there we go but that's cool
I mean it's beautiful so what I'm waiting for now is like for the seeds to finish off
um sorry I'm uh reading comments yeah I nut trees would be cool
yeah AJ that's what kind of sucks it so the YouTube chat I feel like YouTube could do
much but like I don't know why people can't like friend each other on YouTube and do like the I
mean like the basics of Facebook social media uh that was uh
it's doggone scaredy cat plant it's
it's
plectranthus caninus but I don't know if that's the actual name but uh it's
if anybody knows what plant family that's in um so anyway with that I'm gonna
uh eat some more pasta
smoke some more
free thinkers drink some more wine
and probably pass out so everyone have a good night and uh what's today Monday give me a second
Monday Tuesday we got London and the Dank Hour tomorrow afternoon and then
Wednesday morning hearty time Alex what's the show what do you what's it called
and I think we need a a toad and cheddar show like uh Statler and Waldorf
I'm waiting for Alex to
paradigm shift right yes there we go all right I was right yeah my my mind's on like diesel
engine speed right now yes Chase I have not forgotten about you oh so so uh the um
Nicholas P Money episode is kind of hopefully the lead-in to psychedelics conversations
but uh yes Chase I I that email is still in my inbox to uh start getting those going
so and we got the west coast we got the the biggie Tupac east coast west coast
toad cheddar from the mean streets of Bar Harbor Island to Northern California
and uh yeah I I agree
and I think if I remember we have
no all right now I still have it
that's that's my that's my uh mental visualization
so yeah coast to coast
but then you guys got to pick a time a time that works for both of you because I know
I don't know who's like the early riser
night owl I think you're more the night owl right
so actually that would work now I'm trying to think of but anyway you guys can figure that out
but uh with that I'm gonna go back in the house see everyone
