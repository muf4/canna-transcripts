[00:00.700 --> 00:08.700]  All right, good morning. Welcome to the East Bay Sea Collective show.
[00:08.700 --> 00:21.700]  Um, it's a, ah, I think this might be my guest. Hello. Hey, how's it going?
[00:21.700 --> 00:28.360]  Um, so did you get the link that I sent you?
[00:28.360 --> 00:35.160]  Um, I thought I had emailed it to you.
[00:35.160 --> 00:47.710]  Um, it was the Pride of Lions at Gmail.
[00:47.710 --> 01:06.160]  In, yeah, in Chrome over Safari.
[01:06.160 --> 01:16.020]  I'm in a, in like Richmond area so like the area.
[01:16.020 --> 01:25.050]  Nice.
[01:25.050 --> 01:51.520]  I'm also on live right now if I'm talking as well. We have our guest he's he's setting up so we should be, we should be getting set up shortly everybody.
[01:51.520 --> 01:59.520]  So yes, everybody today we have a pride of lions seeds coming on to talk with us about all the flowers.
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.520]  He's just getting his, his connection set up.
[02:05.520 --> 02:14.520]  But yeah, I think it's going to be a really killer show. I understand everybody's just kind of waking up and getting settled.
[02:14.520 --> 02:19.520]  Yeah, I think this will be a really interesting conversation.
[02:19.520 --> 02:32.520]  All the people that were on was that two weeks ago with our conversation with Jeremy from Davis farms, I thought that was a extremely interesting conversation I'd really like to get him to come back on again.
[02:32.520 --> 02:44.520]  But to keep talking hemp I think it's a really interesting topic and also a really good way for us to learn how to breed, you know, many different ways.
[02:44.520 --> 03:01.520]  And so like hands with reading many different ways. We have Daniel from Pride of Lions coming on today to talk auto flowers. And, yeah, there is some myths that I'd like to have busted today.
[03:01.520 --> 03:17.880]  I've definitely been a auto flower skeptic. And, you know, it's time to, to kind of move past that and have some outdoor green weed to smoke in the summertime.
[03:18.880 --> 03:40.880]  So yeah, that's I mean, really, that's my, that's my big impetus for today's show is, you know, there are a lot of people on here who are outdoor people like myself. And for me the biggest issue with outdoor grower. Ah, all right.
[03:40.880 --> 03:42.880]  You got me.
[03:42.880 --> 03:44.880]  I do. Hello, Daniel. How's it going?
[03:44.880 --> 03:46.880]  Hey, Jamal. Nice to meet you.
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.880]  I sincerely appreciate it.
[03:49.880 --> 04:01.880]  Yeah, it was like 10 months old was up late teething last night. It was a little bit of a rough night, but I'm here.
[04:01.880 --> 04:09.880]  Thank you for coming on. I have a two year old, so I can definitely empathize with you.
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.880]  I guess just out of the, you know, quick question, how is the weather treating you up on the hill?
[04:17.880 --> 04:33.880]  Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's been sunny for a couple days now. It looks like there's going to be sunshine for 10 days, you know, even with all the rain we've been getting in California, you know, it could be sunny for the rest of winter and, you know, we might still be in reservoirs would be full, but we'd still be in the drought.
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.880]  For sure. For sure. But you guys don't have any like land, like landslides or anything like any issues like that?
[04:42.880 --> 05:06.880]  Oh, there was a, yeah, there was a couple minor little landslides, but our biggest issue was, you know, clogged culverts and trees coming down because we've had a lot of dead doug fir and pine trees from the drought and the pine beetle so they just been coming down like I think in three weeks I cut 25 trees off the road.
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.880]  Jeez. And where are you located?
[05:10.880 --> 05:14.880]  I'm in the eastern mountains of Mendocino County and Potter Valley.
[05:15.880 --> 05:17.880]  Nice. That's an excellent area.
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.880]  Yeah.
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.880]  That's epic. That's super epic.
[05:51.880 --> 05:59.880]  So, okay, so I want to, you know, the reason I had you on is one of my friends gifted me some pride of lion seeds.
[06:00.880 --> 06:10.880]  And honestly, being selfish, I was like, I want to grow these and I might as well try to interview this breeder. It would be a great way to learn about these genetics.
[06:11.880 --> 06:24.880]  I'm an outdoor guy and I love to go to music festivals, but probably as you know, by that time in the summer your weed, it's not that good. It's all brown and whatnot.
[06:25.880 --> 06:31.880]  And so obviously time to grow some auto flower so I can have some fresh stuff to smoke in the summertime.
[06:33.880 --> 06:45.880]  You know, probably the later part of the summer. So that's really the impetus of this show is to help people learn how to grow autos in the summer so they can have something awesome to smoke.
[06:46.880 --> 06:52.880]  I also was really inspired that I saw that you're growing a lot outdoors.
[06:53.880 --> 06:54.880]  Yeah.
[06:54.880 --> 06:59.880]  Come on in, honey. What's going on? You can come in.
[07:00.880 --> 07:03.880]  I'm sorry. My daughter likes to come say hello on every show.
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.880]  That'll probably happen to me too.
[07:09.880 --> 07:10.880]  Come in, honey.
[07:11.880 --> 07:12.880]  Say hello.
[07:13.880 --> 07:14.880]  Hi.
[07:19.050 --> 07:20.050]  This is Aili.
[07:21.050 --> 07:22.050]  Hi, Aili.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.050]  Yeah, this is Daniel.
[07:24.050 --> 07:25.050]  Okay.
[07:25.050 --> 07:28.050]  I've got two girls too. And one boy. I have three kids.
[07:29.050 --> 07:30.050]  Oh, geez.
[07:31.050 --> 07:32.050]  Yeah, for sure.
[07:34.050 --> 07:37.050]  So, okay. So my question. Okay, so.
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.050]  Yeah, outdoors.
[07:39.050 --> 07:44.050]  Autoflowers outside. What got you into growing autoflowers?
[07:45.050 --> 08:01.050]  You know, a friend of mine who was staying on the farm with me built a handmade gym bag for this guy on the coast here in Minnesota County.
[08:02.050 --> 08:05.050]  And the guy gave him like three packs of seeds.
[08:06.050 --> 08:11.050]  And, you know, one of them was labeled, you know, early.
[08:12.050 --> 08:28.390]  And, you know, before I realized it, I'm like a Mexican early girl and bred it into an OG and just kept selecting for the earliest finishing.
[08:29.390 --> 08:33.390]  So I think it had a recessive ruderalis in it.
[08:34.390 --> 08:37.390]  And I don't even, you know, I've definitely tracked down some more information.
[08:37.390 --> 08:40.390]  The guy doesn't grow anymore, but he was like a little hobby breeder.
[08:40.390 --> 08:42.390]  And I think he accidentally made an autoflower.
[08:43.390 --> 08:44.390]  So then I started with that one.
[08:45.390 --> 08:53.390]  And that's a Lionsgate OG with Mexican early girl, which had the Siberian ruderalis in it.
[08:54.390 --> 08:59.390]  And I was interested in autoflowers before that, just because we're, you know, outdoor growers.
[09:00.390 --> 09:03.390]  So then, you know, I got some more autos and seed trades.
[09:04.390 --> 09:10.390]  And, you know, I've never been into doing light depth or indoor.
[09:11.390 --> 09:13.390]  I like the outdoor. Do a season and you're done.
[09:14.390 --> 09:25.390]  I don't like all the, you know, a lot of plastic with the light depths and the green, you know, it's, and I don't think it's like, you know, a hillside full of autos or, you know, backyard with a couple of them.
[09:26.390 --> 09:27.390]  It's fun.
[09:27.390 --> 09:34.390]  And, you know, we got lucky because the auto that we started with is fantastic.
[09:35.390 --> 09:41.390]  I mean, I've, you know, kind of stabilized that autoflower that I was given.
[09:42.390 --> 09:50.390]  And, you know, people hit mid 20s THC, sometimes upper 20s, you know, we hit like 3% terpenes on it.
[09:51.390 --> 09:53.390]  It's an incredible autoflower.
[09:53.390 --> 09:59.390]  And we use that to cross into other full-term genetics.
[10:00.390 --> 10:04.390]  And I bred those early and then cross them with some ones I got in seed trades.
[10:05.390 --> 10:17.390]  And, you know, now we have, I mean, I have just under 300 autoflowering seed lots and another 300 partial autoflowering seed lots.
[10:18.390 --> 10:30.390]  And it's also nice too, because people who can't grow a big full-term plant or they're older, they just need a smaller plant, they want an easier, quicker way to get their medicine or their smoke.
[10:31.390 --> 10:34.390]  I really love autoflowers. They're really fun. They're really unique.
[10:35.390 --> 10:41.390]  And, you know, unless you're trying to do commercial depths, you can find a way to, you know, fit them into your garden.
[10:42.390 --> 10:45.390]  Now, how would you recommend people fit them into their garden?
[10:46.390 --> 10:49.390]  Well, you know, I recommend all the time.
[10:50.390 --> 10:56.390]  I mean, even if you've got a little veggie garden in your backyard and you're afraid to grow cannabis, you know, put an autoflower back in there, you know.
[10:57.390 --> 11:08.390]  Or, you know, or if you've got your medical card or your rec card, wherever, if you're in a state where you can legally grow, they usually don't count your plant count.
[11:08.390 --> 11:11.390]  They usually don't count your plant count until they're flowering.
[11:12.390 --> 11:15.390]  So if you've got your big plants, you can grow an autoflower.
[11:16.390 --> 11:21.390]  It's already harvested before your big plants start flowering, and you can get that in with your plant count.
[11:22.390 --> 11:27.390]  Or, you know, if you're, let's say you're a commercial farmer and you're just doing outdoor, same thing.
[11:28.390 --> 11:31.390]  They don't, the metrics don't count your canopy until it's flowering.
[11:32.390 --> 11:35.390]  And flowering is like, I think it's like maybe a dime-sized bud on it.
[11:35.390 --> 11:46.390]  So you can get an autoflower harvest in before, or if you're new to growing, or if you have a balcony, you know, you can put an autoflower in a five-gallon pot in your balcony.
[11:47.390 --> 11:52.390]  You know, you could take them inside and outside if you were concerned about it.
[11:53.390 --> 11:56.390]  So they're really, yeah, what is it, the root world, they're really hardy.
[11:57.390 --> 12:01.390]  They can really grow anywhere under any low light conditions, shady conditions.
[12:02.390 --> 12:11.390]  You know, if you don't have a lot of sun in your backyard, or if you're in, you know, an area in the world where you've got that shorter season that ends, you know, in September.
[12:12.390 --> 12:18.390]  Or, and you can, you time that autoflower to finish in your best month, and you're going to get some quality herb.
[12:19.390 --> 12:20.390]  For sure.
[12:21.390 --> 12:29.390]  When, I mean, it sounds like the recommendation is just to kind of stagger and have them planted all the time.
[12:30.390 --> 12:37.390]  Is there like a specific, are there like certain times you really recommend like putting them in the ground, like those sorts of things for outdoor?
[12:38.390 --> 12:43.390]  Yeah, I mean, it really depends on where you are.
[12:43.390 --> 12:52.390]  I mean, I like to, for me too, it's, you know, there's also, I try to get like one good run of autos in so I don't start them too early.
[12:53.390 --> 12:54.390]  Okay.
[12:54.390 --> 12:57.390]  You know, so I kind of wait until it gets a little warmer in spring to start my seeds.
[12:58.390 --> 13:01.390]  Because then you're going to get that best, you know, 70 to 100 days out of it.
[13:02.390 --> 13:07.390]  But if you're, you know, some people that are trying, oh, I'm trying to replant with clones in July.
[13:08.390 --> 13:11.390]  Well, then you might want to start yours a little earlier if you're using the same space.
[13:12.390 --> 13:15.390]  I like to have my auto flowers on the farm have their own space.
[13:16.390 --> 13:24.390]  It's just, there's no, so I can just let them do their thing, not have to have that anxiety or worry, oh, I need to get these out of here so I can get the next thing into it.
[13:25.390 --> 13:30.390]  But if you do, you know, you just, if you have that sort of a setup, you want to start them earlier.
[13:31.390 --> 13:37.390]  I also like to start up sometimes late.
[13:38.390 --> 13:41.390]  Like I'll start them in August to finish in November.
[13:42.390 --> 13:51.390]  Because I can, you know, I can, and I usually do that in a greenhouse up here just, and I usually, you know, for research, but I try to, the fall, the late runs can do really, really pretty.
[13:52.390 --> 13:57.390]  If you have the weather or a greenhouse for it, like you can get more of the colors.
[13:58.390 --> 14:02.390]  Because the summer run, you don't really get that nice fade in the auto flower.
[14:03.390 --> 14:12.390]  I mean, I've even done winter runs in greenhouses, and I've done them for breeding, and I've had clones and autos together in there, and you can really tell which ones are the clones.
[14:13.390 --> 14:15.390]  Because they're the ones that aren't really forming nice buds.
[14:15.390 --> 14:24.390]  But the autos, even in winter with no supplemental lighting, with a little supplemental heating on the hard freeze nights, like the autos form buds.
[14:25.390 --> 14:26.390]  Interesting.
[14:27.390 --> 14:32.390]  Yeah, like people in LA, Southern California, you know, can grow autos year round in greenhouses.
[14:33.390 --> 14:46.390]  And so like when, let's say, to have some herb for August and September, what would you say the best time to start your autos would be?
[14:47.390 --> 14:51.390]  You know, probably for the 100 days, you know, April.
[14:52.390 --> 14:56.390]  And I focus a lot on 100-day autos.
[14:57.390 --> 15:00.390]  You know, because you get more yield from them.
[15:02.390 --> 15:04.390]  They transplant better.
[15:05.390 --> 15:09.390]  But we are breeding some, you know, 60- and 70-day autos as well.
[15:10.390 --> 15:14.390]  I mean, the 100-day, I'm 6'4", I've had autos as big as me in 90 days.
[15:15.390 --> 15:24.390]  Wow. Now, are those ones probably planted, like, the best part of the season, or can you get something like that and have it planted earlier in the year?
[15:25.390 --> 15:27.390]  That's usually the best part of the season, yeah.
[15:27.390 --> 15:34.390]  So, and it's also, autoflowers are not, you know, dependent on the photo period, but they are influenced by the photo period.
[15:35.390 --> 15:40.390]  So your, you know, your earlier runs might add a few days outdoors to their cycle.
[15:41.390 --> 15:46.390]  So, you know, in the summer ones, the ones that like finish in like the middle of summer where that light will be a little shorter.
[15:47.390 --> 15:49.390]  So that was a big part of the season.
[15:49.390 --> 15:56.390]  So, you know, in the summer ones, the ones that like finish in like the middle of summer where that light will be a little shorter.
[15:57.390 --> 16:05.390]  So that was that auto flower that was as tall as me, which was a lion claw, is normally 100 days, but it finished in 90 in the summer.
[16:06.390 --> 16:08.390]  I think I harvested that in August.
[16:09.390 --> 16:11.390]  So, July, June.
[16:12.390 --> 16:18.390]  Yeah, so I started that in May when it was like nice weather.
[16:19.390 --> 16:20.390]  Yeah, look at that.
[16:21.390 --> 16:26.390]  But you can, I mean, I've started them early. I've had these had snow on them and, you know, they're hardy.
[16:27.390 --> 16:33.390]  And it's, I mean, it sounds like one of the most, the cruxes of this, of autoflowers is the root zone.
[16:34.390 --> 16:40.390]  And getting this root zone as big as possible before the plant goes into flower, is that correct?
[16:41.390 --> 16:47.390]  Because I know like, you know, the root zone does not, you know, it has a certain amount of time that it's growing before it starts going into flower.
[16:48.390 --> 16:50.390]  And then that root zone is not going to be growing as vigorous.
[16:51.390 --> 17:02.390]  Is that a correct assumption as far as like getting these to be as big as possible, as quickly as possible, and possibly like vegging them inside for a certain amount of time and then transplanting it outside?
[17:03.390 --> 17:16.130]  Well, I mean, it's really, I just said, you know, it definitely, the root zone definitely affects the size of the plant, you know.
[17:17.130 --> 17:27.130]  So if you're growing in containers versus the ground, you know, and I wouldn't grow an auto in less than a five-gallon pot.
[17:28.130 --> 17:33.130]  Or in a hundred day, you know, you're better off in the 10-gallon pot.
[17:34.130 --> 17:39.130]  But we grow straight in the ground, except for certain breeding projects.
[17:40.130 --> 17:44.130]  And autos are transplant sensitive.
[17:45.130 --> 17:46.130]  They can be transplanted.
[17:47.130 --> 17:49.130]  You just can't miss the window on it.
[17:49.130 --> 18:04.130]  I've had the same results with direct sow in transtarting them in a four-inch pot, transplanting them into a one-gallon pot, and then one gallon into the ground.
[18:05.130 --> 18:08.130]  So that's another myth about autos, that they can't be transplanted.
[18:09.130 --> 18:11.130]  Well, they can, they're just transplant sensitive.
[18:12.130 --> 18:20.130]  And you have, you know, if you let them get root bound and they start flowering, well, yeah, you know, you gotta not let them get, which is tough to do.
[18:21.130 --> 18:22.130]  You gotta be on it.
[18:24.130 --> 18:25.130]  Interesting.
[18:26.130 --> 18:28.130]  So would you almost recommend direct sowing then?
[18:29.130 --> 18:34.130]  No, I mean, especially with a hundred, you know, that's why I also like the hundred day autos.
[18:35.130 --> 18:36.130]  They are more forgiving.
[18:37.130 --> 18:38.130]  You have a little bit more time on that.
[18:38.130 --> 18:51.130]  So, I mean, you know, if you wanted to get a really nice harvest with a hundred day auto, and your climate was, you know, colder, you could start them in a greenhouse or indoors.
[18:52.130 --> 18:56.130]  You know, we started ours in, I started them in a greenhouse.
[18:58.130 --> 18:59.130]  At least on that early run.
[19:04.720 --> 19:05.720]  Gosh.
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.720]  Here's a question.
[19:07.720 --> 19:16.720]  I feel like there is a, there is this common misconception that autos are not a good smoke.
[19:17.720 --> 19:18.720]  Yeah.
[19:18.720 --> 19:19.720]  Yeah.
[19:22.720 --> 19:23.720]  How is the smoke of autos?
[19:24.720 --> 19:27.720]  I mean, you can't tell the difference anymore.
[19:30.720 --> 19:31.720]  Yeah.
[19:32.720 --> 19:33.720]  Yeah.
[19:34.720 --> 19:44.720]  I remember when I was at a party in Covilo, and I had a fresh jar of the Lime Braw auto flower, and that was the first time I met Frenchie Canoli.
[19:45.720 --> 19:52.720]  And people were talking about autos, and I busted out the jar, and he took it from me, and he smelled it, and he rolled it up right then.
[19:53.720 --> 19:55.720]  And, you know, he was always advocating for my auto flowers.
[19:56.720 --> 20:04.720]  You know, if you took some of these newer autos, and you gave somebody a jar, no one would tell the difference.
[20:06.720 --> 20:07.720]  Interesting.
[20:07.720 --> 20:08.720]  That's awesome to hear.
[20:09.720 --> 20:18.720]  Now, if you, the one area where you were told that if you took all these auto flowers and you put them into pounds, you would tell the difference because of the variation in the seeds.
[20:18.720 --> 20:24.720]  But if you took like one auto flower, put it in a jar, you know, you're going to have a hard time telling the difference.
[20:25.720 --> 20:31.720]  Now, I know that like different plant morphologies lean themselves to different turf profiles.
[20:31.720 --> 20:37.720]  So I'm kind of curious if autos lean themselves to certain turf profiles, certain flavors, certain effects.
[20:41.720 --> 20:42.720]  No.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.720]  No?
[20:44.720 --> 20:49.720]  Not after like, you know, the breeding goes into it.
[20:49.720 --> 21:01.720]  So, you know, like with our 300 partial auto hybrids that we took, and we selected, and we took the blueberry, you select the terpens you want, you breed for it, you get them.
[21:02.720 --> 21:17.720]  It's, you know, it's, there's, I find more of the underlying terpene from the terroir of the native soil where we are growing in all of our ganja versus this specific plant.
[21:17.720 --> 21:30.720]  You know, you can, that's one of the beautiful things about cannabis is that it's evolved to grow on every planet, or every, not every planet, I mean, every corner of this planet from, you know, Thailand to Siberia.
[21:30.720 --> 21:36.720]  Where we get the autos from and the creativeness, the ingenuity, you can take that anywhere you want.
[21:36.720 --> 21:43.720]  You can breed any flavor, any high, any effect of that into any, you know, version of cannabis.
[21:44.720 --> 21:48.720]  So, you know, we're seeing these new auto flower breeders doing that, myself included.
[21:51.720 --> 21:52.720]  That's super encouraging.
[21:54.720 --> 21:56.720]  That is really, really encouraging.
[21:57.720 --> 22:02.720]  Are there any other, like, myths of autos that you would like to address?
[22:05.720 --> 22:06.720]  Or that you hear?
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.720]  Yeah, I think it's hard because it's like social media, right?
[22:11.720 --> 22:13.720]  People just, there's trolls, you know?
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.720]  You know, people, no matter what, people are going to talk some sort of shirt about it, you know?
[22:18.720 --> 22:29.020]  Okay, so here's a question Peter asked, is to talk about breeding autos, like specific photo period, plant smells, tastes.
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.020]  Yeah, okay.
[22:32.020 --> 22:34.020]  Best practices for breeding autos?
[22:35.020 --> 22:36.020]  Yeah, let me grab some water.
[22:37.020 --> 22:38.020]  Sure.
[22:39.020 --> 22:43.960]  Yeah, Peter, my brain, thank you for the question.
[22:43.960 --> 22:48.960]  My brain is, is, it's still waking up.
[22:48.960 --> 23:04.960]  Yeah, so let's say you have auto flowers, but you don't like, and you're a breeder, a hobby breeder, and, you know, and you don't, you wanted to get a specific, you know, flavor or chirping profile.
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.960]  Let's just say you wanted to do like a, you wanted to make an auto blue ring.
[23:09.960 --> 23:15.960]  So, now, I guess it's harder if, you know, you can't find regular auto flowers, which we only breed.
[23:15.960 --> 23:20.960]  But, you know, it's easier if you can get a regular auto flower, it's not impossible if you can't.
[23:20.960 --> 23:22.960]  Because you could do it the other way around.
[23:22.960 --> 23:29.960]  You could take a male from a full term line, or photo period line, and cross it into an auto flower.
[23:30.960 --> 23:38.960]  So that, then F1 cross of the auto flower blue dream, because the auto flower trait is recessive, that F1 is going to be photo period.
[23:38.960 --> 23:46.960]  Now, some of them will be about a month earlier in the harvest, but they will start flowering in the autumn.
[23:47.960 --> 23:54.960]  You know, 99% of them, at least, will start flowering when the light changes, you know, at the end of the season.
[23:54.960 --> 24:01.960]  So, then you take any male and you put it on the best female that you like with that F1.
[24:01.960 --> 24:11.960]  You know, really, if you can get a female that's a little bit older, you know, and you can get a female that's a little bit younger, you know, and you can get a female that's a little bit older, you can get a female that's a little bit younger.
[24:11.960 --> 24:19.960]  You know, really, if you can, you know, if you start enough seeds, you'll find one that you're looking for.
[24:19.960 --> 24:25.960]  Like, oh, this looks just like the mother. This looks just like that blue dream I want to stabilize, or whatever other trait you want to stabilize.
[24:25.960 --> 24:35.960]  And if you're lucky enough, you find that. But if you don't find that, don't worry about it, because the F2 generation, you're going to see a lot more diversity come up in it, and you might find it in there.
[24:36.960 --> 24:55.960]  And you can keep, you keep going, even if you didn't quite find it, you can still keep going on the line to stabilize it, because there's other, because then when you get down to your F2 generation now, that autoflower trait is coming up 25% or less.
[24:55.960 --> 25:09.960]  So now you want to select a male and a female from that 25% or less population, you make that cross, then your F3 fully autoflower. But it's not, let's say it's not exactly what you're looking for.
[25:09.960 --> 25:19.960]  You like something better in that F1, or you're like, I want to go all the way back to that blue dream clone or whatever it was that cut that I had, I'm gonna go all the way back to that one.
[25:19.960 --> 25:31.960]  Now, if you go back to your F1 population, because you like something better in there, and you start some more seeds there, you do your back cross, and this is what you should use a back cross for when breeding cannabis is to stabilize traits.
[25:31.960 --> 25:49.960]  You're not going to stabilize the line by continuously back crossing it, but you can stabilize traits. So you go back to that F1, and now that back cross will have a population of autoflowering traits in it, I think it's 50% or less.
[25:49.960 --> 26:12.960]  But if you're like, you know what, I really want to go back to my clone or that cut of that, you go back to that and it will be a recessive trait again, and you'll have to start the whole process over again. And I've done that, I'm doing that as well. I've gone back to the F1 and back to the original cut, because sometimes you're looking for something a little more specific and it's easier to do that.
[26:13.960 --> 26:28.960]  And then you just go back down generations again, and three generations down from that, it's fully auto again, and it's going to resemble more of what you're looking for, for terpenes, highs, look, etc, etc, etc.
[26:28.960 --> 26:45.960]  Interesting. So I've always kind of been curious about combining an auto with a long flowering sativa, with the idea to get that long flowering sativa to trigger sooner and finish throughout the year.
[26:45.960 --> 26:46.960]  You can come in, Premma.
[26:49.960 --> 26:51.960]  Is that something that you've ever, that you've done before?
[26:52.960 --> 27:04.960]  So I, yeah, not with a long flowering sativa, but so in that second generation where you have that population of 25% or less auto flowering, you have that population of 75% photo period.
[27:05.960 --> 27:15.960]  So you would then select in that generation, something that would resemble a long flowering sativa and structure and high, but it's a month earlier. Yeah, you could easily do that.
[27:16.960 --> 27:17.960]  Interesting.
[27:18.960 --> 27:35.960]  And I am working, that is what, like if I really like one of these auto photo hybrids, I will go back to that second generation and breed for, I usually breed for early photo because it's nice to, you know, to stagger the harvest.
[27:36.960 --> 27:48.960]  Where I'm at, where my harvest is going in November. So my autos are in June, July, maybe August, into August are those early photo periods, then September, October, November.
[27:49.960 --> 27:55.960]  Yeah, I mean, that makes perfect sense. I mean, a lot of people, including myself, don't even have the space to dry all of their cannabis at once.
[27:56.960 --> 27:57.960]  Yeah, neither do I.
[27:59.960 --> 28:03.960]  So like, let's, so semi autos, or you're calling them early?
[28:03.960 --> 28:15.960]  I call them early photos because you're selecting the photo period traits in them. Some people call them semi autos or super autos, but they're, you know, they're photo period.
[28:16.960 --> 28:30.960]  Because you're just, you're selecting their breeding for that. And I've noticed with, you know, really heavy indica varieties, if you start, there's a good rule of thumb for outdoor growing.
[28:30.960 --> 28:46.960]  If you're starting with, you know, your natural lights, if it's harvested after October, you can start them earlier, like February, March. If it's started, if it's harvested before October, you know, start them April.
[28:47.960 --> 28:48.960]  Right.
[28:49.960 --> 29:08.960]  Because if you get a cloudy spring, mines will flower early. And yeah, heavy indicas are more susceptible to that, or the semi, you know, the super, the semi autos, you know, I call the early photos that you've read from them, those are susceptible to that too.
[29:09.960 --> 29:25.960]  And sure, you, I've seen it in lots of lines. Yeah, you are more likely to get an early throwback like, you know, our early sphinx, which is a lion claw Tahoe Kim that we bred to be both auto and early photo.
[29:30.190 --> 29:32.190]  Yeah, this is my little girl.
[29:34.190 --> 29:35.190]  Hey Prima, Prima!
[29:38.190 --> 29:39.190]  Dad's on the show.
[29:42.190 --> 29:43.190]  Go tell mom.
[29:45.190 --> 29:47.190]  Say hi. Hello.
[29:50.190 --> 29:51.190]  She have a little doll in her hand.
[29:52.190 --> 29:53.190]  Three of them, it looks like.
[29:57.190 --> 29:58.190]  That's awesome.
[29:59.190 --> 30:23.190]  So yeah, the early sphinx, um, you know, it's actually a Swami select group this last year and they really liked it and it kind of made a good hash for them. So, um, but yeah, you'll get most of them, they start coming in like in the August to mid September on the early female. And then you'll get like a couple in July.
[30:24.190 --> 30:28.190]  And those, and what time would you plant those?
[30:29.190 --> 30:30.190]  I'd start those in April.
[30:31.190 --> 30:32.190]  Okay.
[30:32.190 --> 30:46.190]  Yeah, just because, you know, with things in starting earlier with some varieties, you're going to get like more hermaphrodites by starting them too early. Like, you know, you'll get more problems, you know.
[30:47.190 --> 30:51.190]  But like the longer season stuff, like after October, yeah, you can, you can start those in October.
[30:52.190 --> 30:59.190]  Or you can start those in February. You know, I wouldn't really, outdoors in a greenhouse, I wouldn't start things any earlier than that.
[31:00.190 --> 31:20.190]  Being an outdoor farmer with more stuff than I could ever get done on the land and the farm, like I've never really been into starting so early. But when I got into like large nursery populations, it's nice to get around through. So, I don't know, the past couple of years I've done this February start, I'm not sure if I'm going to this year.
[31:21.190 --> 31:39.190]  No, I mean, I totally concur. Like the longer that I've grown, the later I like to start things. I feel like when things are started super early, I feel like the plants, veg makes them a little vulnerable.
[31:40.190 --> 32:06.190]  Like, you know, when you start them extra early, they become even more vulnerable to pests. And, you know, it's just even longer for them to be around. And often when you, when you plant, you know, when you have a plant that's not too big, and you plant it right at the right time, it stretches just fine and ends up, you know, being the right size as opposed to like when they're big, put out too high.
[32:07.190 --> 32:30.190]  I mean, I think this is also like, I would assume not really pertinent to you, but like to a lot of people, they don't have full sun gardens. You don't have full sun, vegging your plant, you know, starting a plant in February and putting it outside in May or June, often you get a lot of the stem action, you know what I mean? Where it's like the plant's tall, but a big percentage of it is just like stem.
[32:31.190 --> 32:40.190]  Yeah, on the ones we started earlier, you know, they're in five gallon pots by the time they go into the ground, then just to prevent that, you know.
[32:40.190 --> 32:43.190]  And you probably get full sun, I would assume. So they really get a chance to...
[32:43.190 --> 32:46.190]  No, we're, we're Northwest slope.
[32:46.190 --> 32:47.190]  Oh.
[32:47.190 --> 32:51.190]  Our farms, but we have like, you know, some sunnier areas, but yeah.
[32:52.190 --> 32:55.190]  Oh, so, so you're also making hash autos.
[32:55.190 --> 32:57.190]  Yes. Yeah.
[32:57.190 --> 32:59.190]  Let's, let's hear about that.
[32:59.190 --> 33:10.190]  Well, you know, the Lion Claw that we started with actually just, it washes in itself, you know, average yields does make good quality rosin as well.
[33:11.190 --> 33:16.190]  But, you know, average yield for an auto is, that's across the board. So, you know, some autos don't even wash.
[33:16.190 --> 33:19.190]  So again, just kind of luck of the draw that we started with.
[33:20.190 --> 33:28.190]  And stuff like that. And, you know, it's, it's definitely a breeding trend. I think maybe it's like the first one I've ever really gotten behind.
[33:28.190 --> 33:30.190]  It's like, oh, breeding for washing.
[33:31.190 --> 33:36.190]  That's a fun one to get behind and, you know, just, you know, feeling the, the texture of the resin glands on the plant.
[33:36.190 --> 33:39.190]  You're like, oh, this ones gonna, this one's gonna be good.
[33:39.190 --> 33:45.190]  It's a fun one to get behind and, you know, just, you know, feeling the, the texture of the resin glands on the plant.
[33:45.190 --> 33:48.190]  And, you know, it's, it's, it's definitely a breeding trend.
[33:48.190 --> 33:52.190]  I think maybe it's like the first one I've ever really gotten behind.
[33:52.190 --> 33:54.190]  And it's like, oh, breeding for washing.
[33:54.190 --> 33:57.830]  feeling the texture of the resin glands on the plant.
[33:57.830 --> 34:01.070]  You're like, oh, this one's gonna hash.
[34:02.030 --> 34:06.350]  And then getting the low down on the little jar test
[34:06.350 --> 34:08.110]  to get the cold water with the ice.
[34:09.910 --> 34:13.030]  And I think on the commercial aspect of things,
[34:13.030 --> 34:16.110]  as I do work with two licensed nurseries,
[34:16.110 --> 34:19.030]  I think breeding for high quality hash out
[34:19.030 --> 34:21.150]  has a good commercial viability.
[34:21.350 --> 34:22.630]  You know?
[34:22.630 --> 34:23.470]  For sure.
[34:25.190 --> 34:26.870]  Gosh, my brain, come on brain.
[34:28.150 --> 34:31.030]  So you do 100 day autos.
[34:33.790 --> 34:36.070]  Is that pretty much as long as it goes?
[34:36.070 --> 34:37.830]  And at that point after 100,
[34:37.830 --> 34:41.670]  it's considered like a semi or like a super auto
[34:41.670 --> 34:42.510]  at that point?
[34:42.510 --> 34:43.350]  So is that like as long?
[34:43.350 --> 34:44.990]  Well, yeah, I guess there's a super auto,
[34:44.990 --> 34:45.830]  which can go on,
[34:45.830 --> 34:50.830]  because there's like the Red Cross hemp one we got.
[34:51.270 --> 34:52.390]  It's more like a super auto,
[34:52.390 --> 34:54.350]  because that goes 125 days.
[34:55.190 --> 34:58.110]  But like I said, sometimes with the 100 day autos,
[34:58.110 --> 35:03.110]  if you're starting in like late winter or late fall,
[35:04.150 --> 35:05.070]  like especially, I've seen,
[35:05.070 --> 35:10.070]  the longest I've seen autos go is in my late runs.
[35:11.310 --> 35:12.910]  But I'm usually doing them for seeds.
[35:12.910 --> 35:14.870]  I'm waiting for the seeds to mature.
[35:14.870 --> 35:19.590]  But I've had autos go 125 days in the later,
[35:19.590 --> 35:21.750]  in winter, I'm harvesting in January.
[35:21.750 --> 35:24.110]  You know, started in the fall.
[35:24.110 --> 35:26.670]  But yeah, I've actually not,
[35:26.670 --> 35:28.430]  I guess I need to do some research on the,
[35:28.430 --> 35:32.030]  you know, is the super auto and then the semi auto.
[35:32.030 --> 35:32.870]  So yeah.
[35:33.990 --> 35:34.830]  For sure.
[35:35.950 --> 35:38.390]  No, I mean, it's, like I said earlier,
[35:38.390 --> 35:42.910]  autos are not dependent on the photo period,
[35:42.910 --> 35:44.990]  but they are influenced on the photo period.
[35:44.990 --> 35:47.870]  And autos will do some weird shirt.
[35:48.710 --> 35:53.710]  Like a couple summers ago, my early run,
[35:55.270 --> 35:56.110]  it was like that.
[35:56.110 --> 35:58.870]  It was so, it was not last year,
[35:58.870 --> 36:00.630]  because last year was a really nice summer.
[36:00.630 --> 36:02.230]  But the summer before was so brutal.
[36:02.230 --> 36:04.830]  We started with like triple digit heat waves in May.
[36:04.830 --> 36:06.670]  And it was like, we were on the ropes.
[36:06.670 --> 36:08.670]  It was just one after the other.
[36:08.670 --> 36:11.030]  Like as soon as one was over, you looked in the forecast,
[36:11.030 --> 36:13.790]  there was another one coming, you know.
[36:13.790 --> 36:18.670]  And I had some autos that were deep in the flower,
[36:18.670 --> 36:21.390]  and that heat wave hit,
[36:21.390 --> 36:24.910]  and I don't know, a percentage of them re-vetched.
[36:24.910 --> 36:27.750]  They're like, oh, it's, the weather's good.
[36:27.750 --> 36:30.910]  We're gonna re-vetch.
[36:30.910 --> 36:33.190]  And then they finished, you know.
[36:33.190 --> 36:36.230]  So there's just some weird stuff in the genetics of auto.
[36:36.230 --> 36:40.230]  Or some people will, if it's too cold,
[36:40.230 --> 36:41.790]  and the light's not good enough,
[36:41.790 --> 36:43.390]  I've seen, you know, they'll,
[36:43.390 --> 36:47.070]  regardless of what you do, autos will, you know,
[36:47.070 --> 36:49.310]  and maybe it's something to do with the roots, actually,
[36:49.310 --> 36:52.070]  now that I think of it, in those kind of conditions.
[36:52.070 --> 36:53.510]  Because I haven't experienced,
[36:53.510 --> 36:54.590]  but I've seen people do it,
[36:54.590 --> 36:58.430]  where it's a six inch auto fire plant when it's done.
[36:58.430 --> 37:00.710]  But it's probably because of the roots didn't get,
[37:00.710 --> 37:02.950]  got damage on it more.
[37:02.950 --> 37:03.910]  Because I've had, like I said,
[37:03.910 --> 37:05.350]  I've had autos go into January.
[37:05.350 --> 37:06.830]  So it's not necessarily,
[37:08.110 --> 37:10.750]  you see there's other factors involved,
[37:10.750 --> 37:13.110]  other than the photo period in the auto.
[37:14.190 --> 37:18.230]  And another good thing too is don't overfeed your autos.
[37:18.230 --> 37:19.070]  Don't.
[37:19.070 --> 37:20.310]  Like we grow ours in clay.
[37:20.310 --> 37:21.830]  Like I said, the ones that have been installed,
[37:21.830 --> 37:23.150]  I mean, they've been growing in clay
[37:23.150 --> 37:24.270]  with a little bit of compost.
[37:24.270 --> 37:26.390]  Like hardly anything.
[37:26.390 --> 37:27.230]  No feeding.
[37:28.470 --> 37:31.510]  So it sounds like they could be a good candidate
[37:31.510 --> 37:35.270]  for some sort of like dry farming techniques.
[37:35.270 --> 37:37.750]  Oh, I would love to see some autos grown
[37:37.750 --> 37:39.790]  on some of these dry farms.
[37:39.790 --> 37:41.510]  Yeah, they do that.
[37:41.510 --> 37:43.270]  Because also with, you've got,
[37:43.270 --> 37:44.710]  that's another way you can,
[37:45.710 --> 37:47.630]  you really don't want to give them too much nitrogen
[37:47.630 --> 37:49.830]  or you will get a higher herm rate.
[37:49.830 --> 37:52.230]  And there is a herm rate in all cannabis seeds.
[37:52.230 --> 37:54.670]  Like all lines will do it.
[37:54.670 --> 37:57.190]  Give them the right conditions or stress or factors.
[37:57.190 --> 37:58.790]  Like any plant will hermaphrodite.
[37:58.790 --> 38:02.830]  And autos are, because of how they grow and survive,
[38:02.830 --> 38:05.190]  they're definitely more susceptible to it.
[38:05.190 --> 38:08.470]  But not, you know, I look back at my career,
[38:08.470 --> 38:09.710]  you know, 20 years of growing,
[38:09.710 --> 38:12.270]  I've seen a handful of hermaphrodites in full terms.
[38:12.270 --> 38:13.750]  But in just a couple of seasons,
[38:13.750 --> 38:16.430]  I've grown more autoflowers than I ever have
[38:16.430 --> 38:18.630]  with the numbers behind the full term.
[38:18.630 --> 38:21.070]  Similar rates, but you know,
[38:21.070 --> 38:24.350]  but they're definitely more susceptible to too much nitrogen.
[38:24.350 --> 38:27.510]  And a good rule of thumb is a third of what you would get
[38:27.510 --> 38:28.550]  if you're gonna feed,
[38:28.550 --> 38:33.270]  a third of what you would give a full term plant.
[38:33.270 --> 38:36.350]  But then it also depends on the autos.
[38:36.390 --> 38:40.750]  Like, you know, if you're breeding your autoflower lines
[38:40.750 --> 38:43.590]  into cush lines and making them autoflowers again,
[38:43.590 --> 38:46.270]  you can, with these new modern autos,
[38:46.270 --> 38:48.630]  breed something that can take in more nutrients,
[38:48.630 --> 38:50.430]  but you know, just ask your breeder.
[38:51.870 --> 38:54.070]  Interesting, interesting.
[38:54.070 --> 38:59.070]  So as far as like, you're a regular auto breeder,
[38:59.550 --> 39:01.270]  not a feminized auto breeder.
[39:01.270 --> 39:02.750]  Yeah.
[39:02.790 --> 39:07.150]  How do you select males in auto breeding?
[39:07.150 --> 39:08.470]  Yeah, how do you select males in auto breeding?
[39:08.470 --> 39:11.150]  Cause I mean, you can't take clones of these plants.
[39:11.150 --> 39:13.030]  You know, it's like a moving target.
[39:13.030 --> 39:15.270]  That to me is really, really interesting
[39:15.270 --> 39:17.150]  to hear auto breeders on the topic.
[39:21.870 --> 39:24.270]  And there is, you know,
[39:24.270 --> 39:27.830]  there is at least in that first generation population,
[39:27.830 --> 39:30.670]  it, you know, I would almost,
[39:30.670 --> 39:33.750]  yeah, I would definitely recommend taking a male,
[39:34.390 --> 39:35.510]  especially if you're trying to create
[39:35.510 --> 39:37.030]  a specific flavor that you want,
[39:37.030 --> 39:39.230]  and you want to get away from that, you know,
[39:39.230 --> 39:43.030]  autoflower flavor that might be in some of these autos,
[39:43.030 --> 39:44.950]  and you're trying to get something, you know, better,
[39:44.950 --> 39:46.710]  you would want to take a male autoflower
[39:46.710 --> 39:47.950]  and cross it into the full term.
[39:47.950 --> 39:51.510]  Cause at least in that first generation population,
[39:51.510 --> 39:54.790]  you'll see more plants that resemble the mother,
[39:54.790 --> 39:58.550]  but you will see some from the, you know,
[39:58.550 --> 39:59.910]  the father's line as well.
[39:59.910 --> 40:03.310]  It's just in that first generation, it's less,
[40:03.870 --> 40:05.390]  but you know, like if you start enough seeds,
[40:05.390 --> 40:07.390]  it doesn't really matter, male to female,
[40:07.390 --> 40:11.670]  female to male, what you're going to end up with.
[40:11.670 --> 40:15.510]  Just like I said, keep going back cross if necessary.
[40:16.350 --> 40:18.470]  Oh yeah, someone just popped some lion claw.
[40:18.470 --> 40:19.310]  Nice. Yeah.
[40:19.310 --> 40:20.830]  You will not be disappointed.
[40:23.190 --> 40:24.990]  It really is like, you know,
[40:24.990 --> 40:27.830]  one of the best autos in the game as far as,
[40:28.750 --> 40:32.590]  you know, flavor, terpenes, THC, yield.
[40:34.150 --> 40:39.150]  But yeah, actually someone who has grown large populations
[40:42.310 --> 40:47.310]  of males, I find more hermaphrodites in males than females.
[40:47.750 --> 40:49.150]  And I don't know if it's something that,
[40:49.150 --> 40:52.670]  and you really got to look your male over
[40:52.670 --> 40:56.070]  because sometimes you'll find just one female hair
[40:56.070 --> 40:58.830]  on a lower branch of an autoflower.
[40:58.830 --> 41:00.510]  And you want to make sure that you're not breeding,
[41:00.550 --> 41:03.990]  you really got to give the autos a good look over
[41:03.990 --> 41:04.950]  and make sure you're not finding
[41:04.950 --> 41:08.310]  just one sneaky little female flower or hair even.
[41:08.310 --> 41:09.990]  Just, you know, yeah.
[41:12.030 --> 41:15.270]  And then, and then like, you know, males flower too.
[41:15.270 --> 41:18.190]  So you're looking at the structure and, you know,
[41:18.190 --> 41:20.790]  you're looking for the aroma as well.
[41:24.440 --> 41:25.280]  For sure.
[41:25.280 --> 41:28.880]  I mean, I'm assuming when you look through, you know,
[41:28.880 --> 41:31.440]  a population of male autos,
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.480]  it'll be like looking through a population
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.440]  of regular males where you'll have some that flower sooner,
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.160]  some that flower later, some that are stretchier,
[41:40.160 --> 41:43.240]  just that it's a bit quicker is my assumption
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.960]  that they would just, it would just be sooner,
[41:45.960 --> 41:47.520]  all those different things.
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.480]  And if you're keeping the male to put on your full terms,
[41:51.480 --> 41:54.600]  you also want to consider that either the timing of that
[41:54.600 --> 41:56.760]  or the storage of your pollen.
[41:56.760 --> 41:58.880]  And if you're going to keep pollen for months
[41:58.880 --> 42:01.440]  before you're going to use it, I would recommend the fridge.
[42:01.440 --> 42:04.080]  If you, you know, if you're going to keep it for a month
[42:04.080 --> 42:05.680]  or weeks before you're going to use it,
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.880]  just like the pantry, just stable, cool temperature, not.
[42:09.880 --> 42:13.600]  Cause, and actually I was on the Shingo Lose
[42:13.600 --> 42:15.240]  Shaping Fire podcast.
[42:15.240 --> 42:19.120]  And I know there's a whole hour of pollen talk.
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.200]  So if you're interested in more pollen talk,
[42:21.200 --> 42:23.280]  go dive into that one.
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.160]  For sure.
[42:25.160 --> 42:28.720]  So like, let's say you're doing a breeding project.
[42:29.560 --> 42:30.640]  You're looking for a male.
[42:30.640 --> 42:34.240]  You have, I would assume you're females in a separate area.
[42:34.240 --> 42:37.640]  If you chose like, let's say a single male
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.200]  or would you be choosing like a group of males
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.360]  to then hit to those females?
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.560]  It depends on what you're trying to do
[42:48.560 --> 42:51.040]  and where you're at in your breeding program.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  I know usually, so if you want more diversity,
[42:59.400 --> 43:01.000]  you use more males.
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  If you want less, and there's times in breeding programs
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.480]  where you're going to want more or less diversity.
[43:06.480 --> 43:09.320]  And I know some breeders will like, when they're doing,
[43:09.320 --> 43:12.200]  when they're making that F2,
[43:12.200 --> 43:14.320]  they'll use up to 10 males just to get,
[43:14.320 --> 43:16.520]  cause the F2 you're already going to see more diversity
[43:16.520 --> 43:17.440]  within that gene pool.
[43:17.440 --> 43:19.680]  So if you really want to see some more,
[43:20.800 --> 43:25.400]  you bring more out and then,
[43:25.400 --> 43:27.880]  you know, you've heard the term like bottlenecking, right?
[43:27.920 --> 43:28.760]  Yeah.
[43:28.760 --> 43:31.080]  So bottlenecking is not, that's just, you know,
[43:31.080 --> 43:34.640]  so, you know, when you're then stabilizing your lines,
[43:34.640 --> 43:36.720]  your traits, and you want to get that more homogenous
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.600]  look to it, you would select one male.
[43:40.600 --> 43:43.360]  But then if you wanted to get,
[43:43.360 --> 43:45.160]  and then once you've got something that was stable,
[43:45.160 --> 43:48.400]  homogenous, and that might take you six to 10 generations.
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.840]  If you wanted to keep breeding that line,
[43:52.280 --> 43:54.600]  then you would open up the population
[43:54.600 --> 43:58.920]  almost to what I like to call selected open pollination,
[43:58.920 --> 44:03.640]  where you would have a population of females and males,
[44:03.640 --> 44:07.240]  and you would maybe, you know, a hundred females, 15 males,
[44:07.240 --> 44:08.800]  and just let them open pollination.
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.360]  Cause then you're going to open back up that diversity
[44:12.360 --> 44:14.120]  within a very bottleneck line,
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.880]  but it's still there because it's cannabis.
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.720]  So then you can keep breeding that line,
[44:21.720 --> 44:23.360]  you know, 10, 20, who knows?
[44:23.360 --> 44:28.000]  We don't need, you know, but, and that's another
[44:31.520 --> 44:33.960]  just positive aspect about regular breeding.
[44:33.960 --> 44:36.280]  So feminized seed breeders,
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.960]  they usually don't go past S3, self three, right?
[44:40.960 --> 44:43.800]  And regular line breeding, you can go, you know,
[44:44.680 --> 44:47.160]  F8, F10, and then, like I said,
[44:47.160 --> 44:49.680]  we're using these techniques where you then open back up
[44:49.680 --> 44:54.680]  the population, you can go 15, 20, 30, 40 generations.
[44:54.960 --> 44:57.720]  So, but there are, you know,
[44:57.720 --> 45:00.720]  there's aspects of, you know, feminized breeding,
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.720]  and, you know, it's a tool, but, you know,
[45:02.720 --> 45:05.400]  for if you want to keep a line going, you know,
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.480]  for a long time with the seed,
[45:07.480 --> 45:08.640]  which is what you want to grow,
[45:08.640 --> 45:10.080]  which is what the earth wants you to grow,
[45:10.080 --> 45:11.040]  is from the seed.
[45:12.520 --> 45:15.480]  You got, you know, get into the regulars.
[45:15.480 --> 45:19.480]  And I appreciate that you are growing auto regulars.
[45:20.280 --> 45:22.440]  I have grown feminized, made feminized seeds,
[45:22.440 --> 45:24.400]  but the one thing that I don't like about it
[45:24.400 --> 45:26.920]  is that you have to work with chemicals that are not safe.
[45:26.920 --> 45:28.880]  And I just like-
[45:28.880 --> 45:31.880]  Yeah, if you want that 99% rate, you know,
[45:31.880 --> 45:34.760]  you can work with colloidal silver and get like an 80% rate
[45:34.760 --> 45:38.040]  or, you know, I know it's a lower successful rate,
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.280]  but, you know, colloidal silver is not a harmful chemical.
[45:40.280 --> 45:42.440]  And then there are other ways you can,
[45:43.400 --> 45:45.520]  you can stress them out.
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.280]  But like I said, you, it's, I mean, like the,
[45:50.080 --> 45:51.200]  I think it's in the cannabis readers Bible.
[45:51.200 --> 45:52.480]  It says like feminized seeds
[45:52.480 --> 45:55.320]  will make them weak like kittens, you know?
[45:55.320 --> 46:00.320]  So it's not a good way to keep genetics going.
[46:01.960 --> 46:04.360]  Yeah, yeah, no, for sure.
[46:04.360 --> 46:06.360]  It's not a good way for the diversity of the gen,
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.560]  the strength of the line of, you know, it's,
[46:10.800 --> 46:12.680]  I don't know, it's a big debate.
[46:12.680 --> 46:15.440]  And, you know, I like to see both sides of it, you know,
[46:15.720 --> 46:18.360]  and, you know, I think we have to, you know,
[46:18.360 --> 46:20.440]  respect all ways in which this plant
[46:20.440 --> 46:22.240]  wants to present itself to us.
[46:22.240 --> 46:25.000]  And, but I think the proof
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.080]  is kind of in the pudding on that one.
[46:27.080 --> 46:32.080]  And I, yeah, I mean, there, yeah,
[46:33.160 --> 46:36.400]  there is like the, and I've seen,
[46:38.080 --> 46:39.480]  yeah, you lose some vigor,
[46:39.480 --> 46:44.160]  but then you gain a lot of ease with, you know,
[46:44.160 --> 46:46.480]  so there's pros and cons.
[46:46.480 --> 46:50.800]  For sure, so like back to breeding and using your male,
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.840]  is that like a limiting factor?
[46:56.840 --> 47:00.000]  Because if you have like, let's say like a selected male,
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  that selected male is going in the flower.
[47:03.000 --> 47:04.840]  I mean, you're kind of limited in like
[47:04.840 --> 47:07.360]  the amount of pollen that it's producing.
[47:07.360 --> 47:09.880]  You can't keep that specimen.
[47:09.880 --> 47:14.200]  Like it seems like that can kind of be like an issue
[47:14.200 --> 47:16.880]  with breeding and autoflowers in general,
[47:16.880 --> 47:19.960]  because there's no moving of these plants.
[47:19.960 --> 47:23.520]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, we do,
[47:24.560 --> 47:26.440]  our farm is kind of unique,
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.440]  Heart Rock Mountain Farm here,
[47:27.440 --> 47:30.480]  this is the family farm, you know, where I grew up.
[47:30.480 --> 47:31.680]  So our farm is kind of unique.
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.360]  We're kind of like the end of the road, you know,
[47:35.360 --> 47:37.280]  where they got that Northwest slope,
[47:37.320 --> 47:39.640]  and then we're in the forest behind us,
[47:39.640 --> 47:42.520]  it's like a huge cattle ranch and then the national forest.
[47:42.520 --> 47:44.760]  So we can get away with more like, you know,
[47:45.880 --> 47:47.640]  open pollination practices,
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.640]  but I do use the frost protection fabric,
[47:53.360 --> 47:57.480]  the remake and the thicker micron on that.
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.000]  And so we will do our little plots,
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.960]  put T-posts around them, remake it off.
[48:04.960 --> 48:06.760]  So, you know, there'll be, you know,
[48:06.760 --> 48:08.680]  40 autos in the plot like that,
[48:08.680 --> 48:11.080]  and I'll keep maybe a couple males
[48:11.080 --> 48:14.000]  if I'm doing, you know, initial crossing,
[48:14.000 --> 48:14.840]  but then, you know,
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.960]  once I start getting to the F3 generations,
[48:16.960 --> 48:19.320]  I'll just keep single male.
[48:19.320 --> 48:21.200]  And then that one little single male
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.360]  will do its whole thing in that little plot.
[48:26.360 --> 48:31.360]  And then, or I've even done some without curtains
[48:31.480 --> 48:33.440]  and I just go there out there every day,
[48:33.440 --> 48:34.280]  look at the males,
[48:34.280 --> 48:36.880]  pick off the flowers that are about to open
[48:36.880 --> 48:39.600]  and give them a little twist and then drop,
[48:39.600 --> 48:41.800]  put the pollen right where I want it to go.
[48:43.520 --> 48:45.960]  And that's another thing, like, I'm, you know,
[48:45.960 --> 48:47.880]  I'm a regenerative craft farmer.
[48:47.880 --> 48:50.320]  So yeah, you're gonna get some cross pollination
[48:50.320 --> 48:51.160]  in this technique,
[48:51.160 --> 48:52.440]  but you're gonna get a lot of good seeds.
[48:52.440 --> 48:53.560]  You're gonna, you know,
[48:53.560 --> 48:55.520]  if for me, it's easy to tell, like,
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.560]  I grow out like large populations of,
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.800]  and I go, oh, there's a purple plant
[48:59.800 --> 49:01.000]  where it's not supposed to be that,
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.880]  that's from a different pollen.
[49:04.400 --> 49:07.640]  Just one pollen that ended up on the hair,
[49:07.640 --> 49:09.220]  which will happen.
[49:09.220 --> 49:11.080]  But, you know, for the most part,
[49:11.080 --> 49:13.480]  you're getting like a homogenous, you know,
[49:13.480 --> 49:15.280]  looking line, but you get some anomalies
[49:15.280 --> 49:16.440]  every once in a while.
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.360]  But also if you're gonna collect the pollen,
[49:21.360 --> 49:23.400]  one auto flower male,
[49:23.400 --> 49:25.560]  and I, if you, you know,
[49:26.440 --> 49:27.920]  you would grow it in, you know,
[49:27.920 --> 49:30.560]  if you're doing your breeding outdoors,
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.480]  or, you know, you could eat, you know,
[49:32.480 --> 49:35.760]  like you, so my idea with the behind the curtains
[49:35.760 --> 49:37.880]  was to make like a little, you know,
[49:37.880 --> 49:39.840]  little tent, because it's wind pollination.
[49:39.840 --> 49:41.480]  So if you have a six foot screen
[49:41.480 --> 49:43.520]  around your little section of your garden,
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.000]  where you're gonna make your seeds outdoors
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.720]  in your backyard, that wind's not gonna hit it.
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.840]  It's not gonna take that pollen out.
[49:49.840 --> 49:52.400]  And then let it get seeded,
[49:52.400 --> 49:54.960]  mist the male down from the outside
[49:54.960 --> 49:57.000]  when you're ready to cut it out,
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.240]  go in and then cut it out.
[49:58.240 --> 50:00.280]  And then you didn't, I guarantee you,
[50:00.280 --> 50:02.160]  you're not gonna have more than one or two seeds
[50:02.840 --> 50:05.160]  in your females that are growing right next to it,
[50:05.160 --> 50:06.720]  you know?
[50:06.720 --> 50:10.760]  So you have to be careful when you're working with pollen,
[50:10.760 --> 50:12.200]  but you can work with pollen, but you know,
[50:12.200 --> 50:14.400]  it's definitely something that you have to
[50:15.960 --> 50:18.120]  really focus on and really be on it.
[50:18.960 --> 50:21.640]  If you don't wanna see yourself and your neighbors,
[50:21.640 --> 50:23.560]  and you definitely don't wanna see your neighbors.
[50:23.560 --> 50:25.720]  Seeing yourself is not the biggest problem.
[50:30.170 --> 50:31.210]  But you're on mute.
[50:31.490 --> 50:34.490]  So you pollinated some plants and they're, you know,
[50:34.490 --> 50:38.290]  they're seeded up and the seeds are ripening.
[50:38.290 --> 50:41.650]  And you see that some of these plants
[50:41.650 --> 50:43.210]  are different than others.
[50:43.210 --> 50:45.730]  Do you keep all of those plants?
[50:45.730 --> 50:46.730]  Cause it's like, you know,
[50:46.730 --> 50:49.410]  they're all plants that you've never tried before.
[50:49.410 --> 50:52.450]  Like do all of those go to seeds for sale?
[50:52.450 --> 50:56.250]  Or is there some selecting in that process?
[50:56.290 --> 50:58.490]  In that process, you know, I definitely,
[50:59.810 --> 51:03.490]  you know, I had a couple of guys help on the farm
[51:03.490 --> 51:06.290]  this summer and we went through, we took notes,
[51:06.290 --> 51:07.850]  we, you know, we labeled some things,
[51:07.850 --> 51:09.850]  we found our favorites.
[51:09.850 --> 51:14.850]  And, you know, I usually keep my favorite for breeding,
[51:15.250 --> 51:16.770]  the vine on further.
[51:16.770 --> 51:21.330]  And then, you know, if there's some really nice phenos,
[51:21.330 --> 51:22.170]  I do those.
[51:22.170 --> 51:23.490]  And then I'll just keep them.
[51:23.690 --> 51:25.690]  And then if there's some really nice phenos,
[51:25.690 --> 51:27.810]  I do those in the special editions.
[51:27.810 --> 51:29.970]  And then, you know, for some of the other ones,
[51:29.970 --> 51:34.610]  it's just, it's in your more bulk auto pricing, you know.
[51:35.850 --> 51:40.850]  But, and it's, yeah, but you definitely,
[51:41.170 --> 51:43.610]  and then sometimes you find what you're looking for,
[51:43.610 --> 51:44.530]  which is great.
[51:44.530 --> 51:47.010]  And sometimes you find what you're not looking for
[51:47.010 --> 51:47.970]  and it's fantastic.
[51:49.170 --> 51:53.370]  You know, and that's another beautiful thing
[51:54.250 --> 51:57.530]  about the diversity in cannabis is, you know,
[51:57.530 --> 51:59.330]  we get to take it a direction where we wanna go,
[51:59.330 --> 52:02.290]  but we can also follow her in another direction too.
[52:02.290 --> 52:04.850]  It's just, you know, it's, you know,
[52:04.850 --> 52:07.170]  everything's like this creative consciousness
[52:07.170 --> 52:09.010]  that we're working with.
[52:09.010 --> 52:11.850]  And it's really fun to play with the cannabis plant
[52:11.850 --> 52:15.690]  in that realm of that creativity.
[52:15.690 --> 52:19.210]  And it sounds like, I mean, what I'm gathering is like,
[52:19.210 --> 52:21.850]  even though you don't have as much control as you would
[52:21.850 --> 52:23.330]  with the clone where you can be like,
[52:23.330 --> 52:26.010]  I want this plant with this plant.
[52:27.730 --> 52:32.090]  It's a lot more fluid, but it seems like in the fluidity,
[52:32.090 --> 52:35.170]  you're still, the samples that are coming up
[52:35.170 --> 52:39.250]  in the population are still things that people are desirable
[52:39.250 --> 52:41.290]  and that, you know, that people wanna smoke.
[52:41.290 --> 52:43.570]  It's not like a lot of things that come up,
[52:43.570 --> 52:45.850]  people are like, oh, that's the dud.
[52:45.850 --> 52:48.930]  Not like, it seems like most of them are pretty good.
[52:48.970 --> 52:51.010]  Well, you know, like I said,
[52:51.010 --> 52:52.890]  there's two sides of the coin, right?
[52:52.890 --> 52:54.690]  And having the clone is great
[52:54.690 --> 52:58.450]  because you're gonna get exactly what you want.
[52:58.450 --> 53:01.090]  And in growing large populations of seeds,
[53:01.090 --> 53:02.810]  especially if we're breeding, you know,
[53:02.810 --> 53:04.210]  I'll find one that's like,
[53:04.210 --> 53:06.290]  oh, you look just like your mother.
[53:06.290 --> 53:08.010]  You're the one I wanna make the seeds on, right?
[53:08.010 --> 53:10.850]  But then I go, oh, you look better than your mother.
[53:10.850 --> 53:12.250]  You're the one I wanna make seeds on.
[53:12.250 --> 53:16.130]  So with clones, you're removing that part of it
[53:16.130 --> 53:18.010]  from your experience.
[53:18.050 --> 53:20.530]  And with seeds, you're really not
[53:20.530 --> 53:22.090]  if you have that large population.
[53:22.090 --> 53:24.370]  But also if it's, you know,
[53:24.370 --> 53:26.090]  if you have a space to keep clones
[53:26.090 --> 53:27.850]  and you wanna keep your, you know,
[53:27.850 --> 53:29.850]  something really special you found,
[53:32.050 --> 53:33.950]  you know, that's a good thing too, so.
[53:35.090 --> 53:37.130]  For sure, I mean, I guess it's like,
[53:37.130 --> 53:40.210]  it's a completely, it's a different concept of breeding.
[53:40.210 --> 53:42.090]  Cause you know, like when I breed things,
[53:42.090 --> 53:43.770]  I look for a specific clone, right?
[53:43.770 --> 53:45.490]  You know, search for a clone, take the clone,
[53:45.490 --> 53:49.170]  keep the clone, find a male, take a clone, keep the clone,
[53:49.170 --> 53:51.930]  and then start, you know, mixing things together
[53:51.930 --> 53:52.890]  and seeing what I get.
[53:52.890 --> 53:55.370]  But this is, you know, a different concept
[53:55.370 --> 53:56.890]  that you're kind of moving forward
[53:56.890 --> 54:00.630]  with these continuous generations a lot faster.
[54:02.250 --> 54:06.090]  And we're trying like to create, you know,
[54:06.090 --> 54:07.410]  IVLs and bread lines.
[54:07.410 --> 54:10.010]  We're trying to breed like good breeding stuff,
[54:10.010 --> 54:12.890]  which, you know, a lot of your clones
[54:12.890 --> 54:16.210]  aren't good breeding stock.
[54:16.210 --> 54:18.530]  It's like something from a pheno hunt.
[54:18.530 --> 54:21.290]  It's not, it might not even be stable genetics.
[54:21.290 --> 54:22.890]  So then you're taking them,
[54:22.890 --> 54:25.290]  you're making seeds on something that looks good,
[54:25.290 --> 54:30.290]  smokes good, but is it good breeding stock is the question.
[54:30.290 --> 54:31.130]  Right.
[54:32.210 --> 54:33.050]  That's a great point.
[54:33.050 --> 54:35.570]  And I guess with autos, you know off the bat,
[54:35.570 --> 54:37.930]  if it's good breeding stock or not.
[54:37.930 --> 54:41.310]  And if it's not, you just move on with something else.
[54:43.810 --> 54:44.650]  Yeah.
[54:44.650 --> 54:46.570]  And the fun thing with autos is you can see
[54:46.570 --> 54:50.010]  a couple of generations in a year outdoors,
[54:50.010 --> 54:53.170]  which is fun to like take seeds that you made
[54:53.170 --> 54:56.170]  in the spring, grow them out, harvest them in the fall.
[54:56.170 --> 54:58.850]  And, you know, just,
[54:58.850 --> 55:01.470]  I don't think they're ever gonna go away.
[55:01.470 --> 55:06.370]  I think they're a very useful part of this, you know,
[55:06.370 --> 55:07.270]  sacred plant.
[55:07.270 --> 55:10.010]  And it's so amazing that, you know,
[55:10.010 --> 55:11.410]  that they'll do that.
[55:11.410 --> 55:16.410]  That, you know, that is, that they've evolved to grow
[55:17.050 --> 55:22.050]  in every ecosystem on this planet that sustains life.
[55:22.250 --> 55:23.210]  Cannabis will grow.
[55:25.090 --> 55:26.930]  Yeah. I mean, I never thought of it that way,
[55:26.930 --> 55:29.290]  but I guess you can grow them in the garden.
[55:33.710 --> 55:36.430]  Yeah. That's where it originally come from is,
[55:36.430 --> 55:39.870]  you know, the hemp that went wild in Siberia.
[55:40.830 --> 55:43.270]  Hemp that went wild in Siberia is where we get
[55:43.270 --> 55:44.870]  that auto flower trait from.
[55:46.950 --> 55:51.110]  But they really do have a place in, you know,
[55:51.110 --> 55:52.550]  in the backyard garden.
[55:52.550 --> 55:54.050]  And, you know, it can,
[55:55.510 --> 55:57.590]  it can find a place in the commercial farm.
[55:57.590 --> 55:59.430]  I know the commercial industry is like, you know,
[55:59.430 --> 56:01.430]  definitely turned on its head these past couple of years
[56:01.430 --> 56:04.390]  with the corporate takeover of yet another industry,
[56:04.390 --> 56:06.110]  maybe the last industry, you know,
[56:06.110 --> 56:09.190]  and it's unfortunate, you know,
[56:09.190 --> 56:14.190]  to see, you know, the Walmart or Weed, you know,
[56:14.790 --> 56:17.590]  put out another line of small businesses,
[56:17.590 --> 56:19.670]  just like the real Walmart did, you know.
[56:21.110 --> 56:22.990]  Yeah. But I think some of these new autos,
[56:22.990 --> 56:24.950]  especially, you know, and if you're doing like, you know,
[56:24.950 --> 56:28.950]  terpene extraction or cannabinoid extraction or hash,
[56:28.950 --> 56:31.470]  I think these new autos are going to have a place again
[56:31.470 --> 56:33.110]  on the commercial farm, you know.
[56:34.110 --> 56:36.710]  They kind of dissipated the past couple of years
[56:36.710 --> 56:38.230]  with the market collapse.
[56:41.040 --> 56:42.400]  Right. Right.
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.200]  What, do you also breed photos?
[56:49.200 --> 56:50.040]  I would assume you do.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.200]  Yeah. Yeah.
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.400]  Yeah. I breed photos.
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.840]  I've been, you know,
[56:55.840 --> 56:58.360]  I think this is, this will be my 20th season
[56:58.360 --> 56:59.400]  growing cannabis.
[56:59.400 --> 57:02.800]  My dad started in 76 and yeah,
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.800]  I said, we've always made seeds and, you know,
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.240]  it's one of my favorite parts about, you know, farming
[57:10.920 --> 57:12.200]  is saving seeds.
[57:12.200 --> 57:14.520]  And for me, you know, cannabis was my gateway plant.
[57:14.520 --> 57:16.520]  It was like the first thing I ever grew.
[57:17.640 --> 57:19.640]  But now I'm obsessed, you know,
[57:19.640 --> 57:21.800]  like I just started a bunch of peach trees from seed
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.680]  and, you know, I've got, I'm always, you know,
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.000]  people send me, you know, flower seeds or whatever from,
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.040]  you know, I've just seen trades with people, you know,
[57:32.040 --> 57:34.960]  it's like they got, yeah, it's great.
[57:35.600 --> 57:36.440]  Great.
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.240]  I'll be running about 10 autos outdoor early this year.
[57:43.240 --> 57:48.240]  See if I can, early enough to beat the later pest pressures.
[57:50.320 --> 57:51.160]  Yeah. Do you want to,
[57:51.160 --> 57:53.600]  you want to talk on pest pressures and autos at all?
[57:57.610 --> 58:00.690]  An issue in the autos we've grown with pests
[58:02.050 --> 58:03.570]  and we've never sprayed them with anything,
[58:03.570 --> 58:05.690]  but maybe that is because, you know,
[58:05.690 --> 58:08.170]  it's like we harvest them before the, you know,
[58:08.170 --> 58:10.810]  before a lot of the mites bloom and stuff.
[58:10.810 --> 58:13.810]  So I've never thought about that angle of the autos,
[58:13.810 --> 58:15.530]  but yeah, that makes sense.
[58:15.530 --> 58:17.330]  And I mean, I would be curious if,
[58:17.330 --> 58:19.490]  how's the powder mildew pressure?
[58:19.490 --> 58:22.370]  It seems like it's non-existent then too,
[58:23.410 --> 58:25.970]  because you know, you don't get powder mildew
[58:25.970 --> 58:29.610]  where we're at in July and August, you know?
[58:30.210 --> 58:31.050]  And.
[58:33.370 --> 58:34.850]  And then this person asked,
[58:36.170 --> 58:37.010]  what is their question?
[58:37.010 --> 58:40.290]  And do you feed autos the same or less than photos?
[58:40.290 --> 58:41.770]  I know you already answered that, but.
[58:41.770 --> 58:43.090]  Yeah, yeah. Way, way less.
[58:43.090 --> 58:46.210]  You want to feed autos a third
[58:46.210 --> 58:48.610]  of what you're going to feed a photo, you know?
[58:48.610 --> 58:51.930]  And we grow a lot of ours just in, you know,
[58:51.930 --> 58:54.850]  amended clay soil, like just compost.
[58:54.850 --> 58:58.410]  We do that no-till, you know, light top dressing,
[58:58.410 --> 59:02.250]  if anything, and, you know,
[59:02.250 --> 59:07.250]  these autos that we grow and breed,
[59:08.170 --> 59:10.530]  you know, this is more with the autos,
[59:10.530 --> 59:12.930]  because you don't want, the concern is if you overfeed them,
[59:12.930 --> 59:14.610]  you're going to get more hermaphrodites,
[59:14.610 --> 59:16.050]  especially with the nitrogen.
[59:18.650 --> 59:20.930]  And then if you are going to like feed them,
[59:20.930 --> 59:22.610]  like dry, I recommend, you know,
[59:22.610 --> 59:25.210]  whatever you're going to like put in the soil or the pot,
[59:25.210 --> 59:27.850]  you kind of just put it in at the beginning,
[59:28.250 --> 59:30.610]  especially with the dry amendments that break down.
[59:30.610 --> 59:33.570]  You know, bottlenose is not really my area of expertise,
[59:33.570 --> 59:37.170]  but a third of what you would feed a photo.
[59:40.970 --> 59:44.330]  And I also like to add that feeding is also based
[59:44.330 --> 59:45.610]  on the size of the plant
[59:45.610 --> 59:47.850]  and essentially the size of the root zone.
[59:47.850 --> 59:51.050]  So if a plant is tiny, you don't want to feed it a lot.
[59:51.050 --> 59:53.370]  And as the plant starts to get bigger and bigger,
[59:53.370 --> 59:55.130]  that's when you would feed it more.
[59:55.130 --> 59:57.730]  That's why usually a very large outbird plant,
[59:57.730 --> 59:58.730]  you can feed a lot.
[59:58.770 --> 01:00:02.130]  And in general, if a plant is smaller,
[01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.210]  if it has less plant material, you would feed it less.
[01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.970]  And that's for me, just a good rule of thumb
[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.570]  for how much I feed plants is based on the amount
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:15.850]  of root zone and plant material.
[01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.610]  Yeah, I think on my Instagram,
[01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:24.970]  either on the Heart Rock page or the,
[01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.450]  that there's definitely me holding an auto flower
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.650]  that's the size of me that we didn't feed at all.
[01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:31.650]  We just planted in the ground
[01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:36.490]  and it's about six feet tall, just water only.
[01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:40.010]  I mean, that's where like that no-till living soil.
[01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.090]  So it's like, you know, when you switch
[01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.290]  from feeding the plants to building the soil,
[01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:46.650]  it's a different ball game.
[01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.210]  And it's also the ball game you want to get into
[01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.610]  if you've got a piece of land or a backyard
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:52.850]  that you're cultivating,
[01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.530]  because you're going to get more terpenes.
[01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.210]  You're going to, in more terpenes,
[01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:59.330]  you're going to get a longer shelf life on the cannabis
[01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.290]  with the, and you can get a better flavor,
[01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:04.830]  better high with the no-till living soil.
[01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.410]  A hundred percent.
[01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.210]  And I mean, the plants are really getting
[01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.770]  exactly what they need in that way.
[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:16.490]  Anyway, yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.890]  That's actually exactly what I plan on doing this summer.
[01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:25.570]  Here's a, I think I have Hawaiian claws as well.
[01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:30.010]  Put them in the backyard, you know,
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:34.710]  in some native soil and see what happens.
[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:39.410]  Oh yeah, we have another kid on, hello.
[01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.450]  This is my three-year-old, my middle child.
[01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.490]  Hello.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.400]  Yeah, I sent you my seed catalog.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.200]  I saw all the flavors there.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.520]  I did, I mean, there's a lot, you have a lot of work.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.520]  I was really impressed.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.020]  There's a lot of work in there.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.480]  Yeah, and that's just what we're like,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.520]  have gotten cleaned up to release.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.640]  You know, I still have more cedar flower,
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.400]  more varieties in there.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.800]  So I mean, is breeding of auto flowers,
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.480]  it sounds like you make quite a bit of seeds.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.320]  Like you do it very, very often.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.680]  Oh yeah, I have some lion claw seeds
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.400]  that are gonna be like, you know,
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.600]  I'm gonna maybe make into some meditation cushions
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.160]  because we did an open pollination run a few years ago
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.520]  and I made over a million seeds
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.680]  and I was actually fortunate enough to run it
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.880]  through this hemp seed thresher that my friend
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.080]  had brought up from Southern California to Ukiah
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.880]  and someone was gonna come down from Oregon.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.560]  So I got a run, you know, it took me a couple hours
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.720]  to clean up those seeds.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.640]  I probably never would have got cleaned up if I didn't.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.320]  But I have, yeah, they're gonna be bean bags
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.840]  because I made so many of them.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.360]  That's crazy.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.400]  And then I guess the next question is,
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.560]  you must need seed sorting equipment
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.360]  to process that many seeds.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]  Yes and no.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.280]  You know, like with one auto flower,
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.640]  it's not that hard just to winnow it
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.240]  with like your own breath and some trays and stuff.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.120]  It's like the larger, you know,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.320]  amounts of seed that you might,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.360]  you know, we have the zigzag seed separator.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.760]  We have also like, I love the mean gene technique,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.720]  which is the, he uses a shop vac in a trash can
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.400]  and then a hairdryer in a bucket.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.480]  So you're winnowing, you're just, you know,
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.600]  so yeah, it's, but it is labor intensive
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.720]  because you have to manually crush up the flower.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.360]  I mean, I have, there is some equipment.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.600]  There's like a, the one that the Kincade hemp thresher
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.200]  that I ran was like huge, outdoor gas engine.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.640]  Things cost like 45 grand brand new.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.880]  They do make smaller electric threshers,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.960]  but there's still like 20 grand that you can run indoor
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.680]  and you just put buck flower into.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.880]  So, you know, but for now it's, you know,
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.680]  it's just winnowing either by hand or, you know,
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.080]  these various air cleaners, but it's still labor intensive.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.520]  And you know, for me, I have a lot of allergies
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.560]  and it then becomes a cumulative
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.000]  because then like, you know, crushing up the flowers,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.840]  you get that allergy and then the pollen allergy
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.480]  starts coming on for me.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.800]  Do you get any of those allergies?
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.040]  Yeah, I'm lucky that I don't,
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.480]  like the only allergies I get from cannabis
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.960]  is sometimes when harvest begins,
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.600]  I get like a resin rash or just like the first exposure.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.560]  But I don't know, I don't,
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.240]  I'm not really affected by like the poison oak,
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.040]  either in the area or some of the other allergens.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.120]  So, you know, we'll see as that happens, as I get older,
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.840]  you know, cause I know allergies can affect you more
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.000]  as you get older.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.880]  Is there any particular strains
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.840]  that give you the resin rash worse than others?
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.920]  Cause for me, it was the same diesel that just illed,
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.280]  that gave me a crazy rash.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.960]  Yeah, I'll pay attention to that.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.600]  You know, but it's usually whatever, you know,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.720]  actually I don't think I got it this year at all,
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.800]  but it, you know, and it's usually a light,
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.640]  like I know some people that like when they were trimmed,
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.240]  their nose would just water, you know, they just can't,
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.720]  it would just, and they would get really bad rashes.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.440]  And I know some people who couldn't,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.560]  can't be in the room when stuff's being trimmed.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.400]  So it's, yeah.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.840]  You know, I think for me, it might've been this past year
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.120]  was a lot moister perhaps.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.600]  So like it wasn't as much like dust in the environment,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.480]  but for sure I'd get all of those, the runny nose,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.480]  sneezing, pollen, allergies.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.000]  That's what those masks are good for, right?
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.960]  No, it's probably like wearing a mask in my house
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.800]  and people are-
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.840]  Yeah, and I would probably recommend, you know,
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.040]  like, especially with like some of the,
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.280]  if you're running some of the, you know,
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.800]  the air cleaners to wear a mask.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.760]  I think, didn't someone just die in some like feral
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.160]  company and like on the East Coast,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.240]  Massachusetts or Maine this year?
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.480]  I heard someone-
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.280]  From inhaling the dust particles,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.080]  I believe someone did die this year.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.880]  Jeez.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.720]  They died from dust though, not cannabis, you know,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.880]  wasn't THC, it wasn't any of the-
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.000]  Right, it was just the dust.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.600]  I mean, I worked at a facility in, that was in Seattle,
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.320]  and there was a guy with a full on gas mask on
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.760]  when he was trimming.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760]  I mean, this was, must've been like five years ago
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.280]  and I kind of, you know, looked at him like, you know,
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.960]  like that's kind of strange.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.440]  Maybe this isn't the right job for you,
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.560]  but I mean, I guess it's a thing.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.080]  Yeah, I mean, I guess, I don't know if OSHA's requiring
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.280]  trimmers to wear it yet, but you know, they might be.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.240]  Someday.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.160]  You know, I would say like the increasing the humidity
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.240]  in the environment would be my take
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.880]  on the best way to keep it.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.440]  Yeah, or like, you know, during the smoke seasons and stuff,
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.600]  we have like, you know, the air quality,
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.080]  the filters and cleaners like this and stuff,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.800]  you know, and my wife's asthmatic and stuff.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.800]  So sometimes, yeah, during, so it's definitely,
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.920]  you can run air cleaners, filters in your trim rooms too
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.720]  and stuff, so yeah, you can definitely,
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.560]  if you are a sensitive person, you know,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.360]  you'll know then make those changes.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.760]  Yeah, no, it's definitely an issue.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.440]  And I mean, it was even kind of funny was like,
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.760]  I would do some pollinations and then try to like go out
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.320]  for my day and my nose would be running
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.080]  and my eyes would be bloodshot.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.920]  You know, people would just kind of be looking at me
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.560]  and just, wow, right?
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.320]  Come here, come here.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.160]  But yeah.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.200]  But yeah, the cleaning up the seats is definitely an issue
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.200]  for me, especially because of the just huge volume
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.880]  of crosses that I make, which is,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.920]  I think, borderline insanity.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.280]  Yeah.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.640]  So I just thought I would.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.160]  Yeah, because I think I make way too many.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.320]  But then again, like collecting the pollens,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.360]  like the hard part.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.400]  So me then making, you know, like this,
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:09.760]  let's look at like this last year where I, you know,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.120]  I considered it to be like a smaller year
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.720]  in my breeding program.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  I still made over 70 photo period hybrids and crosses.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.960]  And I made something like 111 combinations
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.240]  of autoflower genetics in what I consider
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.440]  to be a small year.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.320]  But I, you know, it's, yeah, that's why it's a little,
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.880]  I'm a little bit of a mad scientist
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.320]  in the breeding program.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.680]  Yeah, I mean, that's a lot.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.760]  How do you test all of those?
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.040]  Well, like I said, some of those
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.240]  might never even get cracked, but we made, we made,
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.400]  you know, and then.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.160]  Like I said, collecting and preserving the pollen
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.040]  is the hard part.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.480]  And after that's done, you might as well
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.120]  just go a little bit nuts and have some fun.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.120]  Because then you're not limiting yourself
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.800]  to the specific cross you wanted to make.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.160]  Maybe you're finding something in the unintentional
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.200]  or like something you hadn't thought of
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.640]  before your program.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.960]  Right, and like when you have like a killer male,
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.320]  basically you just kind of just let it
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.640]  just keep on going, essentially.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.960]  Like it just keeps, just kind of kill it.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.800]  And you know, how we do our, you know,
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.840]  testing and research on this too,
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.080]  it's we have two licensed nurseries here
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.400]  and I work with two licensed nurseries.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.960]  So we get a flower out 5,000 square foot
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.360]  for seed production.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.760]  And that can be in research.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.440]  That's great.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.560]  This person is talking about hemp seeds
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.720]  and if you have any feminized or autoflower.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.640]  We have two hemp lines, you know,
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.800]  that are like 40 to one.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.200]  We have Red Cross, which we've grown before.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.760]  And we have Blue Nami.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.600]  And they're like kind of on the suit.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.440]  Super autos, like 125 days, they're not feminized.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.360]  We don't do any feminized seeds.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.920]  But the silly thing is, is like we have our,
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.120]  you know, we have some high CBD strains
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.480]  that are 0.8% THC.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.240]  You know, I think anything less than 1%
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.520]  should really be hemp.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.600]  And I'm excited, we did breed some of our high CBD strains
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.560]  into autoflowers.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.840]  We now have the Laughing Lion Sioux autoflower available.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.400]  So if you're looking for like,
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.120]  for your medicine, you're looking for like
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.600]  a really good flavorful CBD in an autoflower.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.520]  But if you're looking for,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.800]  if you're in a state where you need to grow the hemp,
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.480]  then yeah, you know, Red Cross is, you know,
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.720]  it's just not, it's hemp.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.480]  You know, it's very hempy.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.080]  Because hemp has a, also,
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.800]  when you mentioned that autoflowers have a specific flavor,
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.520]  it made me think of the specific flavor
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.160]  that you get with hemp.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.600]  And then, and because of that, you do find that
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.440]  in at least the first CBDs that came out.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.600]  But like, then, like we were breeding some of these CBDs
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.120]  that have incredible flavor.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.480]  Like I love Laugher, which is a photo period,
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.240]  so it's got such a nice flavor to it.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.720]  And it has a really nice head change that comes along with it.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.360]  It's actually one of our, you know,
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.080]  one of our best sellers on the rec market
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.360]  here in California.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.000]  You know, like Soulful carries it,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.800]  a couple other shops didn't carry it.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.640]  It's a really nice CBD that's got less than 1% THC in it.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.240]  And it gives you a really nice head change that, you know,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.240]  one of the differences I see is it's just the,
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.440]  yes, and because it's not psychoactive,
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.680]  it doesn't mean that you're not gonna get
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.760]  like a nice head change to it.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:55.880]  And a nice size.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.320]  And I mean, it's something you can make,
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.440]  I mean, I would like to make edibles
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.360]  and topicals and those things.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.600]  And I mean, the Laughing Lion or Love Laughter.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.480]  Love Laughter.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.840]  How big are you able to get those plants?
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.760]  Oh, the Full Term or the Auto-Spray?
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.160]  Either, I didn't know that you had them in both.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.800]  Well, yeah, I have the Laughing Lion too.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.840]  Which does have some of the Love Laughter in it.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.240]  Yeah, I mean, those are, you know,
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.280]  same, it's like 100 day auto,
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.200]  they'll get three feet to six feet tall
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.400]  depending on conditions.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.680]  And then the Full Terms, you know,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.280]  they get pretty big conditions when you've had them.
[01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.990]  So those ones like Full Term?
[01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.830]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.070]  Five and split plus plants?
[01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:58.670]  Yeah, depending on where you're growing them,
[01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.310]  you know, or when you start them.
[01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.590]  Okay.
[01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:06.590]  So I guess another assumption that I always had
[01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:11.310]  was that CBD dominant plants were in general smaller.
[01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.430]  Is that incorrect?
[01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:24.290]  I think that is incorrect from my experience,
[01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:28.290]  but you know, yeah, like some of the shortest plants
[01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:30.890]  on the farm are the coffee genetics, you know.
[01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:35.130]  But yeah, I don't know though,
[01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:40.130]  because I've never really grown CBD clones
[01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:41.890]  or anything like that.
[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.890]  I've just grown CBD seeds.
[01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:49.210]  But yeah, I mean, they're at least, you know,
[01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.810]  medium to large plants.
[01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:52.650]  Okay.
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.490]  Yeah.
[01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:55.770]  Okay.
[01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:57.930]  Excellent, excellent.
[01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:03.170]  So I guess my last kind of,
[01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.170]  like kind of train of thought of where I was going is,
[01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:12.410]  I would like to grow out some autos.
[01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:15.850]  I have some of yours, there's males in there.
[01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.890]  I would like to, you know, continue that line
[01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:21.930]  until I have something to smoke for myself in the future.
[01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.650]  Are there any directions that you recommend me going in,
[01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:26.850]  not going in?
[01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:31.970]  Well, yeah, in growing the regular, you know,
[01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:35.970]  hundred day autos too, it's good to,
[01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:42.570]  you know, I recommend either starting in a one gallon pot
[01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.770]  or transplanting and you can start however you want
[01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:47.690]  to start them really, whether that's trays
[01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:49.770]  or four inch pots or, you know,
[01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.770]  and then get them into a one gallon
[01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:53.650]  and they'll show sex in a one gallon
[01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.970]  before they need to get transplanted into their final home.
[01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.650]  And yeah, like when selecting those males,
[01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:01.770]  like I said, with the autos,
[01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.530]  you really got to give them that good look over
[01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:04.690]  to make sure that you're not getting
[01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:07.250]  that sneaky little female hair.
[01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:12.250]  And yeah, I mean, the line claw is pretty stable in itself.
[01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:15.610]  So, you know, and it's a stud too.
[01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:20.610]  It really does breed very well into photos or other autos.
[01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:26.210]  It's definitely a fantastic auto to play around with.
[01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.090]  For sure.
[01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:32.530]  Do you have an issue with those female parts coming out late
[01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:34.890]  or do they usually come out pretty early?
[01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.690]  They come out, yeah.
[01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:40.450]  They'll come out before the male parts even open.
[01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:43.450]  You'll have like a cluster like this
[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:47.010]  with one female hair coming out of the ponds
[01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:48.770]  that just sometimes just like that,
[01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:52.290]  or you'll see like a full on herm.
[01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:53.850]  But, you know, like I said,
[01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:57.690]  it's kind of normal herm rates for autos, plants in general.
[01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:01.810]  But like I said, they're influenced by other conditions.
[01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:05.050]  Well, essentially, I mean, you just treat them the same way
[01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:06.450]  as you would treat your female ones.
[01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:10.530]  You know, plant them, try not to stunt them,
[01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:12.930]  get them to their regular, to their spots.
[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:14.250]  And then.
[01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:17.170]  Yeah, and then, yeah, if you're,
[01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.610]  the nice thing about autos is you can grow them in a pot.
[01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:21.770]  So, you know, you might want to transplant your male
[01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:24.490]  off to a, you know, a five gallon pot
[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.770]  if you wanted to collect your pollen indoors.
[01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:30.810]  Or like I said, if you wanted to get some
[01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:32.290]  of that frost protection fabric
[01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.890]  and make yourself a little breeding hoop
[01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:40.170]  where you're not gonna mess up the other population,
[01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:44.410]  that's, you know, that's another good route to go.
[01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:48.090]  But, you know, you can collect enough pollen
[01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.490]  off of one little auto flower plant to definitely,
[01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:53.890]  you know, either, I like to paint it on,
[01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:58.250]  but you can also, you know, get those little pollen bags
[01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.090]  and put it in there and put it over a branch,
[01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:01.530]  you know, one branch.
[01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:04.890]  It's gonna get you enough seeds to grow for a long time.
[01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:05.730]  For sure.
[01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.970]  Where can people buy your autos?
[01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.890]  You can email me at produtelineseeds at Gmail
[01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:20.290]  and ask for my catalog.
[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:22.850]  I know you can get them on the Daga Love website.
[01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:25.810]  You can get them on the Planters of the Trees websites.
[01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:29.570]  We're gonna have a website coming soon too,
[01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:34.570]  but, and you can hit me up on social media
[01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:37.490]  if you want to chat, produtelineseeds.
[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:41.770]  And we have a pretty nice email catalog you can get.
[01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:44.250]  That's awesome.
[01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.810]  So, Planters of the Seeds,
[01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:48.250]  so you're, are you homies with Mendo Dope?
[01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:52.650]  Can you please tell us more?
[01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:53.490]  Sure.
[01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:59.170]  Yeah, I, and those guys knew my older brother,
[01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:01.010]  who's, you know, he's no longer with us,
[01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:04.890]  but they knew him like right out of high school for them.
[01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:07.610]  Yes, and then we reconnected when, you know,
[01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.370]  we went legal because we got on Instagram.
[01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.050]  I'm like, oh my gosh, like I know those guys.
[01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:11.890]  So yeah, it was really fun.
[01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:14.450]  They came out and was it like two summers?
[01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:15.650]  Maybe it was before the pandemic
[01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.410]  and they shot like a music video on the farm
[01:19:17.410 --> 01:19:18.250]  when they were doing a little tour.
[01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.170]  They're really cool guys.
[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:26.050]  And I know, yeah, Brandon Knight who runs that website,
[01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:30.690]  he did some work with Mendocino Generations.
[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.890]  He did this branding workshop we went to.
[01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:34.850]  Yeah, cool dude, good people.
[01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:38.570]  That's awesome, yeah, yeah, definitely good people.
[01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:44.370]  Yeah, and you know, I've smoked some of Mendo Dope's beer.
[01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:46.570]  I mean, geez, this must have been years ago,
[01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:49.210]  but I was, I mean, I don't know why I was surprised,
[01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:50.490]  but it was really good.
[01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:54.770]  I mean, huge outdoor plants and it was like fire,
[01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:57.170]  great taste, crazy effect, sorry.
[01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:02.090]  Oh, and their new music is really good.
[01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.250]  Some of their new stuff I really like.
[01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:06.890]  I mean, yeah, they're good musicians and writers too.
[01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.130]  It's fun.
[01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.170]  And their local, you know, Mendocino County guys,
[01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:12.770]  doing good.
[01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:13.610]  No, for sure.
[01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:15.930]  And I think they just got on their first,
[01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.010]  you know, they partnered up with another friend
[01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:20.650]  from Ukiah and I think they had like a license
[01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:21.730]  to grow this year too.
[01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:24.410]  Heck yeah, yeah, no.
[01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.090]  I think the people are gonna be able to get
[01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:29.810]  Mendo Dope flower in the shop, so.
[01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:32.890]  That's awesome, yeah.
[01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:35.170]  I totally agree.
[01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:39.010]  I've been a fan of their music for a long time.
[01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.890]  And you know, if you're in the scene, you know,
[01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:44.490]  it holds a special place in your heart,
[01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.730]  and I think it's just the people that, you know,
[01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:50.730]  rap about being in it in a really interesting way.
[01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:52.530]  I would definitely check out the song,
[01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:54.370]  One Plant, One Season.
[01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:55.330]  I love that one.
[01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.450]  There's one, The Phenohunter is super interesting.
[01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:03.130]  I mean, they got a lot of really good songs.
[01:21:03.130 --> 01:21:04.850]  They got a lot of good stuff, yeah.
[01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.170]  And they just keep releasing more and more and more.
[01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:13.210]  No, for sure.
[01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:14.090]  They do.
[01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:16.850]  They are, and I mean, it's like,
[01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:23.730]  I'm not from the Northern California hills,
[01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:25.890]  but I have a lot of homies that are from there.
[01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:28.890]  I worked this summer in Branscombe.
[01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:30.210]  Okay, yeah.
[01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:32.130]  So, you know, like I've been there,
[01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.010]  you know, I used to go to Reggae on the River
[01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:35.730]  for like almost 10 years.
[01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:38.770]  So like that, you know, like that place
[01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.410]  really holds a special place in my heart.
[01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:44.530]  And, you know, the people from that area,
[01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:47.410]  including, you know, yourself and your family
[01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:50.450]  are people that really like develop this culture
[01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:51.730]  in this community.
[01:21:51.730 --> 01:21:56.730]  And it's like a lot of people in this industry who built,
[01:21:57.570 --> 01:21:59.530]  I mean, the people who built this
[01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:02.490]  are literally getting pushed aside,
[01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:05.450]  but not only did they build this industry,
[01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:08.770]  but there's also a lot of culture behind it that,
[01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:12.570]  how do I say this?
[01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:15.290]  I mean, it's who a lot of people are,
[01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:16.130]  you know what I mean?
[01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:20.170]  And it's just a really rich culture,
[01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:21.810]  this, you know, counter culture,
[01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:26.370]  this, it's just such an interesting part of this country
[01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.850]  and part of the world.
[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:32.090]  And to me, it was, you know, like,
[01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:34.770]  I remember the first year I went to Reggae on the River,
[01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.290]  saw all these people who like lived in the hills
[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.490]  and grew weed for a living and, you know,
[01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.530]  live these different lifestyles
[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:46.770]  and had different ways of thinking about things.
[01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:50.290]  And it was such an eye-opening experience for me
[01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:53.250]  to connect with, you know,
[01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:55.250]  things that could be done in a different way.
[01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:59.090]  And, you know, the people who I work for there,
[01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:02.090]  they lived in, or they live in Southern Humboldt.
[01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:06.050]  And like, we went to their house and, you know,
[01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:09.570]  rode around on four-wheel drive vehicles up in the hills.
[01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:12.370]  And I mean, for somebody who's never seen any of that,
[01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.290]  like it was literally, it was mind-blowing
[01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:18.770]  to see, you know, these other things
[01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:22.930]  and just to participate in these alternate communities,
[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:23.970]  alternate communities,
[01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:29.970]  really shaped who I am as a person.
[01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:32.610]  And, you know, I, you know,
[01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:36.450]  part of my show is just to kind of remind people
[01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:40.130]  and to go back into these, I mean, into these, you know,
[01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:44.650]  into counterculture, into these people who,
[01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.610]  people who grow weed up in the hills, you know,
[01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:49.330]  whether it's in California or in other countries.
[01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:53.690]  Yeah, I mean, I just find that, like,
[01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:57.330]  that's just, you know, that's really what this is about.
[01:23:57.330 --> 01:23:59.250]  Yeah, you know, and like, you know,
[01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:02.090]  my father who settled here in the seventies,
[01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:03.770]  the back to the land movement, right?
[01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:05.890]  And out of the back to the land movement,
[01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:09.330]  like kind of evolved that counterculture to grow cannabis.
[01:24:09.330 --> 01:24:11.850]  But let's look at the foundation of it,
[01:24:11.850 --> 01:24:13.490]  which was back to the land, you know,
[01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:15.290]  like the sixties happened, right?
[01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:18.210]  And there was this, you know, counterculture revolution
[01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:19.650]  that was gonna change the world, right?
[01:24:19.650 --> 01:24:21.610]  But it didn't, but it did.
[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:25.130]  Then people left the city, they went to Homestead.
[01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:28.210]  And I'm hoping, you know,
[01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:31.930]  that although we are losing our cannabis culture,
[01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:34.010]  maybe we can get back to our roots
[01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:35.850]  and get back to the land.
[01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:37.890]  And, you know, and there's probably gonna be
[01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:41.130]  some cheap properties in Northern California for sale
[01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:43.210]  because people can't grow cannabis on them anymore,
[01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:44.210]  but their homestead.
[01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:51.050]  And maybe we can see a revival of that back to the land
[01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:54.010]  and that connection to that, which we need, you know,
[01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:56.330]  to nature, to the earth, to the land
[01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:58.650]  that we're supposed to be stewarding.
[01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:01.250]  And, you know, like, I think that cannabis
[01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:04.770]  is a huge gateway into nature, into gardening,
[01:25:04.770 --> 01:25:06.330]  into, you know what I mean?
[01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:11.130]  People, like, you know, like for me, it's like,
[01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:12.610]  is cannabis medicine?
[01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:13.450]  Yes.
[01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:16.090]  But is this podcast medicine?
[01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:16.930]  Yes.
[01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:17.770]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:17.770 --> 01:25:20.730]  It's like, it's not just the consumption of the cannabis,
[01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:23.770]  that's the medicine, but it's like a way of life
[01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.210]  that it kind of encourages you
[01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:28.050]  to develop these certain kinds of connections.
[01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:30.930]  And for me, I mean, that's realistically
[01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:36.770]  more of the medicine than the physically ingesting of THC,
[01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:38.730]  you know, of these cannabinoids,
[01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:41.130]  is making these experiences.
[01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:44.010]  And I mean, that is kind of going back to the land,
[01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:46.490]  connecting yourself with plants,
[01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:50.250]  with these other entities that are not,
[01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:54.610]  you know, that's not what we stereotypically consider
[01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:56.570]  of value in our culture.
[01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.730]  You know, it's like, could I buy weed
[01:25:58.730 --> 01:25:59.730]  and it would be easier?
[01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:00.570]  Yes.
[01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:04.130]  But, you know, do I choose to breed and grow
[01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.370]  and geek out about it
[01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:07.970]  and have these connections with these plants?
[01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.650]  Which to me, those connections are like
[01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:13.850]  what we're searching for and what, like what we're missing.
[01:26:15.490 --> 01:26:18.650]  Well, yeah, and you know, cannabis,
[01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:21.890]  along with other plant medicines,
[01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.890]  they are accelerants in your consciousness.
[01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:28.490]  You know, they take, and same with meditation, you know,
[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:31.090]  I've been meditating for like 15 years.
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:35.050]  And for me, my natural altered state of consciousness,
[01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:37.050]  I prefer, but when I do consume cannabis
[01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:40.490]  or mushrooms or cactus or, you know,
[01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:44.050]  any other psychoactive compounds, it's an accelerant.
[01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:49.050]  It takes me beyond my normal state of consciousness
[01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:52.330]  into an accelerated state of consciousness,
[01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:55.570]  whereas like alcohol and opiates are depressants.
[01:26:55.570 --> 01:26:57.530]  They're gonna take you back
[01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.610]  into a not expanded state of consciousness.
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:03.370]  So I, you know, when I do use medicines,
[01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:06.530]  I prefer accelerants like new cannabis, mushrooms,
[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:09.290]  or, you know, various other psychoactive chemicals.
[01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:12.090]  But then I like to just sit with myself
[01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:13.570]  in my normal state of consciousness,
[01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:15.250]  which is an altered state of consciousness
[01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:17.970]  due to the fact that I've been meditating for so long.
[01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:21.410]  And, you know, I got the pleasure
[01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:23.370]  of seeing Dr. Emoto speak.
[01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:26.530]  You know, the water scientist,
[01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:29.290]  I saw him speak at this festival in Ashland.
[01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:32.450]  And he said that cannabis has a higher,
[01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:34.610]  highest concentration in plants.
[01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:36.490]  You think, you know, cannabis is a plant,
[01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:39.210]  you know, peyote is a cactus, ayahuasca is a vine,
[01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:41.330]  you know, mushrooms are fungi.
[01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:43.370]  So like you said earlier,
[01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:46.610]  it is when you're working with the cannabis plant
[01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.930]  in your garden, it is a gateway to consciousness,
[01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.930]  just growing this plant, just being around this plant,
[01:27:51.930 --> 01:27:56.130]  you're being around this being that's interacted
[01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:59.650]  with human consciousness for thousands of years.
[01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:03.010]  You know, and it is a pathway
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:04.890]  and a gateway to consciousness,
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:07.330]  which, and it's really fun to be around.
[01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:11.730]  Yeah, yeah, and I mean, it's,
[01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:16.090]  like for me, it's kind of like the deeper
[01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:18.450]  the relationship gets,
[01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:20.290]  the kind of the more complex it gets.
[01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:23.090]  And I feel like, you know, people are like,
[01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:26.050]  the plant talks to me, the plant tells me different things.
[01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:27.410]  It seems like the ultimate thing
[01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:30.450]  that the plant tells you to do is to procreate it.
[01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:34.850]  So like people who are readers of cannabis in my, you know,
[01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.210]  I'd like to think that, you know,
[01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:40.370]  we're doing the ultimate bidding of the plant
[01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:42.810]  by procreating it and spreading it.
[01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:45.250]  Because it seems like, I mean, ultimately,
[01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:49.010]  that's what it wants to do is to live on through the seed.
[01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.050]  Yeah, I love that.
[01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:56.050]  Yeah, yeah, very interesting.
[01:28:56.050 --> 01:28:57.690]  Is there anything else that you wanna,
[01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:01.610]  that you would like to, yeah,
[01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:04.250]  is there anything else you would like to touch on?
[01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:06.850]  I think we're kind of around the end,
[01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:08.370]  but you know, we still have-
[01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:12.850]  Yeah, I feel like that covered a huge,
[01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:14.290]  huge chunk of material.
[01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:16.170]  Awesome.
[01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:21.250]  Yeah, I really appreciate you coming on the show.
[01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:26.050]  I appreciate you educating me and your audience
[01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:28.690]  on auto flowers because I'm ignorant to them.
[01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:31.610]  I would like to, or I will be growing
[01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:32.730]  some of your autos this year.
[01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:36.690]  I'll definitely be, you know, bugging you with, you know.
[01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:38.690]  Yeah, I'll, when we get off here,
[01:29:38.690 --> 01:29:42.850]  I'll send you a nice article on breeding auto flowers
[01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:45.370]  and stuff that I found to be really helpful.
[01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:47.210]  Heck yeah.
[01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:50.410]  Yeah, I would just say like to our audience,
[01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:52.370]  I would, oh, did you guys answer the questions
[01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:55.650]  about using autos to create faster flowering photo periods
[01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:57.210]  rather than autos?
[01:29:57.210 --> 01:29:58.050]  Yeah, we did.
[01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:00.570]  Yeah, and I'll just recap on that really quickly.
[01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:04.930]  So in the, because the auto flower is recessive,
[01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.650]  the F1 is all photo period,
[01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:11.770]  and in the F2, the auto flower trait shows up 25% or less,
[01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:14.130]  but the photo period shows up 75%.
[01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:18.530]  So you would select from that population in the F2,
[01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:21.450]  and you could, you know, shave two weeks to a month
[01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:24.570]  off flowering time of your genetics.
[01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:31.530]  And also, yeah, selecting from that, in that F2 generation.
[01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.570]  Awesome.
[01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:37.830]  That was cool, okay.
[01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:41.330]  Yeah, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:46.410]  I appreciate you being flexible, you know, and being able to
[01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:48.130]  Yeah, and the weather's clear,
[01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:50.330]  so I don't think we could have done this in the storm,
[01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:53.330]  you know, because we don't have internet yet.
[01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:58.330]  But we have, you know, I think we eventually will probably,
[01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.930]  just where we're at, we'll eventually get Starlink,
[01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:03.250]  you know, and
[01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:06.970]  I mean, we had a few glitches, but we're pretty clear.
[01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:11.170]  I would encourage people to purchase auto flowers,
[01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:13.450]  whether it's from Pride of Lion or anywhere else,
[01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:17.690]  because when they're purchased, people make more of them,
[01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:19.690]  and we can improve upon the gene pool
[01:31:19.690 --> 01:31:24.230]  and have more genes out there for people to grow.
[01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:28.170]  Yeah, and if you're looking for a stud, you know,
[01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:30.410]  the lion claws a stud to breed with,
[01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:32.330]  so I definitely, you know.
[01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:34.250]  Yeah, most people.
[01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:37.410]  Go ahead.
[01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.890]  I was gonna say most people breed autos feminized,
[01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:42.570]  and so, you know, the,
[01:31:42.570 --> 01:31:43.530]  Yes.
[01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:47.090]  Being able to get an auto in a regular line
[01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:51.010]  is a huge tool for people to be able to make their own seeds
[01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:54.210]  and, you know, to not have to use, you know,
[01:31:54.210 --> 01:31:55.770]  any kind of reverse.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:31:59.880]  Yeah.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.240]  And I think we have,
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.480]  for the,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.200]  we have over 50 varieties of auto flowers
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.640]  in our seed catalog,
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.480]  and some of these,
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.320]  I'm really excited for some of these new,
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.840]  you know, we have about six hash,
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.960]  head, body autos.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  Like, oh, one of my favorites really goes,
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.160]  you know, with that sweet in the middle,
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.320]  and that, yeah, it's really nice.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320]  Which one was that?
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.120]  The sour banana sherbet auto flower?
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.760]  Oh, yeah, I've grown,
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.200]  I've smoked sour banana sherbet.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.040]  That's a good one.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.000]  So, yeah, as an auto, that sounds great.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:47.520]  Awesome.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.480]  Right on, Jamal.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.520]  Yeah, I appreciate you coming on, Daniel,
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.080]  and yeah, I appreciate everybody on the show
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.520]  for checking it out.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.600]  We may have missed some questions,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.440]  but you can feel free to, you know,
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:04.240]  hit me up on Instagram,
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.360]  or I'm assuming also, you know,
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:08.120]  Pride of Lions, Daniel on Instagram.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:10.840]  And-
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.720]  Oh, yeah, you can definitely message me,
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.360]  and I'll get back to you.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.880]  Oh, and Peter says that we're out of stock in that.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.840]  So, I guess, yeah,
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.040]  you might wanna hit him up for some more of those autos.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.720]  Yeah, I need to get some new labels, too.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.640]  I need to get some print and stuff, but yeah.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.200]  Excellent.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.040]  Yeah, Peter.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.160]  Okay, sounds good.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.280]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.120]  Have a good day.
