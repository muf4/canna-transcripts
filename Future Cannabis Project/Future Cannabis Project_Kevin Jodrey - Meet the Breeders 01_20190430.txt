[00:01.850 --> 00:10.050]  These people that I respect prior to the change in regulation and my whole desire
[00:10.050 --> 00:15.250]  for that interview series was to propel people forward so that they could
[00:15.250 --> 00:21.530]  survive and it's really nice to interview the same people again that are
[00:21.530 --> 00:27.290]  still alive and so they're different directions, different skill sets,
[00:27.290 --> 00:31.690]  different desires but all of them you know to me premium breeders people that
[00:31.690 --> 00:36.410]  I've used to steer people into success with their material and people that
[00:36.410 --> 00:41.610]  I've used to steer my own self into success and so we're gonna let them
[00:41.610 --> 00:44.890]  basically just chop up a little bit. I think we only got one mic.
[00:44.890 --> 00:49.250]  What we'll do is we'll just let them introduce each one by one what
[00:49.250 --> 00:52.930]  they're doing and then we'll start getting into some what are you doing
[00:52.930 --> 00:58.890]  right now because all you involved in interesting stuff and it's an
[00:58.890 --> 01:03.770]  excellent story to listen to because these people are just the same as you
[01:03.770 --> 01:07.850]  where they're individuals that are fighting their way through the system
[01:07.850 --> 01:12.090]  and the only way that it's gonna really work is if you're using the material
[01:12.090 --> 01:16.330]  putting it into play and then they're able to then keep creating stuff that
[01:16.330 --> 01:20.210]  you can put into play so we really have a you know true symbiotic relationship
[01:20.210 --> 01:25.250]  as cultivator breeder so with that.
[01:25.250 --> 01:29.370]  All right thanks Kevin everybody.
[01:32.960 --> 01:44.720]  So Kevin here has been a troubadour of our culture and the region and has
[01:44.720 --> 01:50.800]  probably had just about as far of a reach as anybody in sort of like you
[01:50.800 --> 01:58.920]  know singing the you know really just like telling the story the way it needs
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.680]  to get told especially with you know sun-grown cannabis and organic
[02:04.680 --> 02:11.280]  regenerative cannabis so thank you Kevin so much and my name is Nat Pennington.
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.400]  I founded Humboldt Seed Company in early 2000s and I started breeding cannabis in
[02:17.400 --> 02:24.240]  Humboldt County in 1999 when my daughter was born who's here with me and I'm just
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.680]  incredibly honored to be up here with the illustrious Freeborn Selections and
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.840]  Mean Gene and of course Jason from EQ Genetics. Thank you.
[02:37.840 --> 02:39.840]  All right.
[02:39.840 --> 02:46.490]  Applause
[02:46.490 --> 02:52.490]  All right so the the the vague introduction here.
[02:52.490 --> 03:01.610]  My name is Jackson I go by Mean Gene Freeborn Selections and I've been
[03:01.610 --> 03:05.370]  breeding stuff since the 90s keeping stuff since the mid 90s since I was
[03:05.370 --> 03:12.290]  pretty much a kid and just looking through things and trying to make better
[03:12.290 --> 03:17.250]  plants for you know originally just me and my buddy so we could have something
[03:17.250 --> 03:23.290]  a little better and trying to improve and keep stuff around and not not lose
[03:23.290 --> 03:30.690]  the stuff that's cool that we want to be able to have and that's about it and you
[03:30.690 --> 03:35.970]  know thanks to Kevin these guys for doing this kind of shining a light on
[03:35.970 --> 03:42.090]  you know the positive aspect of what can be done and not just dumping a bunch of
[03:42.090 --> 03:48.090]  garbage into the earth to try to make money and yeah thanks everybody for
[03:48.090 --> 03:50.370]  coming out.
[03:50.370 --> 03:55.120]  Applause
[03:55.120 --> 04:03.400]  So my name is Jason Mathis and I started Equilibrium Genetics and I want to thank
[04:03.400 --> 04:10.080]  want to thank Kev and you know Mean Gene and Matt you know for coming out here
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.040]  and being on the panel with me and so everybody hear me in the back? All right
[04:16.040 --> 04:22.960]  good. It's really great to have opportunities like this to bring the
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.600]  community together. What's going on right now in California is breaking my
[04:26.600 --> 04:32.800]  heart. It's been a long road for me coming from the East Coast. I'm
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.360]  originally from Northern Virginia and I've been really involved in drug
[04:36.360 --> 04:46.160]  policy activism and I worked a really long time for a number of organizations
[04:46.160 --> 04:55.160]  to help pass laws across the country and when I finally get to legalization
[04:55.160 --> 05:01.800]  in California and now I see what a monster it is and it's just
[05:01.800 --> 05:06.920]  breaking my heart seeing what's happening to our community so I just
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.880]  want to stress that everybody just stay vigilant. You know it's not over and
[05:11.880 --> 05:35.030]  we're going to improve these laws. We've seen a lot happen in the past year and I didn't know if anybody was going to show up today and just to see this many faces in the room who are still doing this it's just really good. Thank you.
[05:35.030 --> 05:45.750]  You know when we have the first
[05:45.750 --> 05:52.590]  Regen event in Vancouver it blew my mind at who was there because I realized
[05:52.590 --> 05:57.230]  that this had grown in this organic way of people who wanted to actually
[05:57.230 --> 06:05.550]  continue cannabis culture and agricultural integrity and when I saw
[06:05.550 --> 06:10.350]  the people that were at the event and I knew the speakers were all solid
[06:10.350 --> 06:13.270]  because I looked through them and I've met a bunch of them but I met the people
[06:13.270 --> 06:18.510]  in the room and I couldn't believe the level of commitment and I said whoa
[06:18.510 --> 06:22.870]  we're definitely gonna be alright we're gonna have to fight but there is a lot
[06:22.870 --> 06:27.790]  of people that are about it and then we have this one here and like I said this
[06:27.790 --> 06:30.510]  isn't my event I'm just a speaker I'm just putting on some of this
[06:30.510 --> 06:34.950]  presentation today but I didn't organize this event I didn't create the idea I'm
[06:34.950 --> 06:39.510]  a helper so I'm just grateful to be part of it but it blew my mind when we had to
[06:39.510 --> 06:45.990]  go find another venue because it was too big and and that's not bad and so
[06:45.990 --> 06:49.150]  from Jason's point of view someone who came from the south where you were
[06:49.150 --> 06:54.710]  extremely regulated and he and he comes out to California and gets involved in
[06:54.710 --> 06:58.870]  the industry and then sees the changes and for him to say whoa I didn't expect
[06:58.870 --> 07:03.830]  to see anybody and lo and behold you know you see a building it's huge so
[07:03.830 --> 07:07.830]  there's we're gonna jump around folks we have some time you know and I want to
[07:07.830 --> 07:13.470]  get into some information about you know what do you use the base material
[07:13.470 --> 07:16.550]  you do what are you doing but the first thing I wanted hit Nat because I haven't
[07:16.550 --> 07:19.390]  had a chance to chat with him is Nat did something interesting where he did a
[07:19.390 --> 07:24.590]  giant mega pheno hunt and he he tied a bunch of people into it so that he could
[07:24.590 --> 07:28.070]  actually get the number of participants required to look at material in all
[07:28.070 --> 07:31.270]  these different circumstances and situation and he's used that orange
[07:31.270 --> 07:36.070]  phytonics box so that he'd be able to do a lot of the metrics himself and we
[07:36.070 --> 07:38.550]  never got a chance to chat about it and I just think it was awesome and I don't
[07:38.550 --> 07:41.230]  know if it got covered enough really because I don't know if anybody hunted a
[07:41.230 --> 07:46.870]  population that big here so I mean you might you know that's you look up I come
[07:46.870 --> 07:50.430]  from a family of whalers historic whalers and so there's always a joke
[07:50.430 --> 07:58.790]  that we're out whaling that's whaling yeah looking for that white whale and I
[07:58.790 --> 08:06.550]  definitely went crazy so maybe I should name his train Moby Dick or something
[08:06.550 --> 08:17.830]  anyways um thanks Kev so I guess sort of the impetus for that was just this is
[08:17.830 --> 08:23.870]  practice of phenotype hunting and it's something that I know you know all of us
[08:23.870 --> 08:27.910]  have really probably done in our lives whether it was like in an organized and
[08:28.510 --> 08:35.030]  intentional way or whether we you know bred our own seeds and I mean how many
[08:35.030 --> 08:39.430]  people in here are our breeders like have how many people have either even
[08:39.430 --> 08:51.950]  accidentally you know like right so you know I mean it's it's something that
[08:51.950 --> 09:02.710]  that I think can can be done collaboratively and can sort of feed
[09:02.710 --> 09:10.870]  back into what we kind of need in in our community where you know we don't have
[09:10.870 --> 09:19.430]  access to quite as ample flat ag land and maybe we don't you know maybe our
[09:19.430 --> 09:24.630]  county makes it harder than it really needs to be to have permits and get
[09:24.630 --> 09:31.750]  licenses and so I think one of the strategies can just be to to use our
[09:31.750 --> 09:40.310]  innovation and so doing that in a collaborative way with a bunch of people
[09:40.310 --> 09:48.430]  seemed like it might be you know a good idea and so we started that last or 2017
[09:48.430 --> 09:54.070]  in the fall we kind of came up with the idea and ended up I think around like
[09:54.070 --> 10:02.990]  15 different farms or groups tied into it and went around had a few big events
[10:02.990 --> 10:10.270]  and that the process involved taking a lot of cuttings before flower and
[10:10.270 --> 10:16.950]  keeping them alive and of course a lot of labeling from the field to the to the
[10:16.950 --> 10:24.510]  clone room making sure that that didn't get messed up and so that was quite an
[10:24.510 --> 10:32.750]  effort and definitely some of the folks in this room were were on that team and
[10:32.750 --> 10:39.150]  they know how hard it was like I think Daniel took three or four hundred of
[10:39.150 --> 10:46.350]  them himself right so anyways just kind of coming together like that in a group
[10:46.390 --> 10:54.670]  effort and trying to really improve genetic lines I mean I have a group of
[10:54.670 --> 11:02.070]  friends at Davis that I ended up getting close with doing like salmon genomics
[11:02.070 --> 11:13.030]  research and you know they're really very brilliant geneticists and kind of a
[11:13.070 --> 11:17.190]  question that I had said was like well what are we gonna do you can go out and
[11:17.190 --> 11:23.270]  and find markers and do all this fancy marker assisted breeding and all the
[11:23.270 --> 11:29.830]  stuff like that and they kind of said you know what you guys kind of already
[11:29.830 --> 11:34.590]  are doing what you really should be doing which is just like hunting through
[11:34.590 --> 11:41.790]  populations I mean cannabis is like this exciting really brand new thing and so
[11:41.790 --> 11:49.870]  even though we're all facing down the barrel of corporate America coming with
[11:49.870 --> 11:57.390]  its free markets and commodity pricing I think you know there is still a lot of
[11:57.390 --> 12:03.870]  exciting things to do and they said the no matter what the Syngent is in the
[12:03.870 --> 12:11.270]  Monsanto's no matter how heavy they come in with biotech and and the capabilities
[12:11.270 --> 12:17.790]  of you know mass sequencing and all that stuff it really takes a human who
[12:17.790 --> 12:25.390]  knows the plant really well to be able to even you know inform any of that
[12:25.390 --> 12:30.510]  stuff so they're still years away and they still have to learn about this
[12:30.510 --> 12:38.430]  plant that we all know so well because we've worked with it for years so you
[12:38.470 --> 12:41.910]  know when all hope is lost I think sometimes it's you can just remember
[12:41.910 --> 12:51.430]  that like we're a powerful you know we're powerful contingent if we're a
[12:51.430 --> 13:07.310]  collaborative contingent and and you know they can't I want what he's on but
[13:07.310 --> 13:13.270]  anyway I don't know so phenotype hunting I mean I think you know Jean you want to
[13:13.270 --> 13:18.110]  talk about phenotype hunting well I was gonna ask you we can go into the piece
[13:18.110 --> 13:20.750]  but I there was some stuff that all three you're doing that are interesting
[13:20.750 --> 13:24.590]  right and so I wanted to give a chance for you to talk about the megafina hunt
[13:24.590 --> 13:29.870]  and the fact that I don't think anybody really understood the scope of what you
[13:29.870 --> 13:33.910]  did it was a big hunt I'm somebody who likes to hunt populations and I'm like
[13:33.910 --> 13:38.510]  ooh you a hunt in a big population and you had a lot of people helping you had
[13:38.510 --> 13:43.950]  a lot of people involved that's a logistical nightmare you got to use some
[13:43.950 --> 13:47.470]  modern equipment that was portable to allow you to be able to afford to do it
[13:47.470 --> 13:50.630]  because holy Christ having a lab test that much stuff would have bankrupted
[13:50.630 --> 13:54.910]  you and then so then all of a sudden you become a competent field lab operator
[13:54.910 --> 13:58.150]  because you're having to make sure that the tests are actually standardized so
[13:58.150 --> 14:01.470]  they make sense and I think that that was just something I thought was awesome
[14:01.470 --> 14:06.270]  and and I just didn't see enough coverage of it well Jean and for the
[14:06.270 --> 14:09.590]  sake of transparency to I do business with all these guys meaning that my
[14:09.590 --> 14:13.390]  store carries their products right so this isn't a sales pitch for him but
[14:13.390 --> 14:18.870]  you got to say that otherwise everybody's trying to push something
[14:18.870 --> 14:22.750]  and in this case I'm just trying to push what they do but the point is that Jean
[14:22.750 --> 14:29.070]  release his own line of pre-rolls and that's the first time I see me Jean come
[14:29.070 --> 14:33.630]  out as a pre-roll and it was always typically all in genetics and the
[14:33.630 --> 14:38.710]  question was you know are you having to change your lines to work with your your
[14:38.710 --> 14:42.550]  new direction in flower are you able to use the existing tools what are you
[14:42.550 --> 14:47.110]  noticing from a breeders point of view and I and I know that all of you were
[14:47.110 --> 14:50.990]  excellent cultivators to just smoked all year so you know what are you having to
[14:50.990 --> 14:58.510]  do to shift into that new realm of product diversity that you're doing well
[14:58.510 --> 15:05.430]  the the the trip about that was basically that like I myself like I roll
[15:05.430 --> 15:08.870]  a joint in my hand I hold the weed I break it in my hand I roll it up and I
[15:08.870 --> 15:12.950]  smoke it right away like I'm never I don't like to roll my joints and then
[15:12.950 --> 15:18.350]  smoke them later so like myself I'm like not a pre-roll guy but the weird thing
[15:18.350 --> 15:23.830]  is that at dispensaries people either want to buy a little bud or they want to
[15:23.830 --> 15:30.190]  buy a joint like that's mostly what it is so basically my buddy was just like
[15:30.190 --> 15:35.510]  hey you know we got your flavors we want to we want to put them out and you know
[15:35.510 --> 15:39.350]  he's like can we stick your name on it and say oh this is your this is this is
[15:39.350 --> 15:43.270]  these flavors so that there's you know basic brand recognition because it's so
[15:43.270 --> 15:47.670]  important right now for people to be able to look at something and go okay
[15:47.670 --> 15:50.750]  I've heard of that I'm gonna try it people want things on their shelves that
[15:50.750 --> 15:55.750]  have some recognition to them you know and it's like the stuff that we all
[15:55.750 --> 16:01.590]  regard as being like hype like it's like okay there's there's different forms of
[16:01.590 --> 16:05.710]  it and and a big a big part of it is really just brand recognition and anytime
[16:05.710 --> 16:09.870]  you're selling something you want people to be able to look and go okay I would
[16:09.870 --> 16:15.630]  buy that so I don't know the pre-roll thing is funny to me because I was like
[16:15.630 --> 16:18.150]  yeah you can put it on there don't don't call them pre-rolls though you got to
[16:18.150 --> 16:22.510]  call them joints the whole pre-roll thing is funny I've had I've made jokes
[16:22.510 --> 16:25.830]  about that for years like oh you can make it you know how to make a pre-roll
[16:25.830 --> 16:31.790]  you know you know how to roll a joint you know but um but the trip about it is
[16:31.790 --> 16:34.950]  is that with the whole thing it's like okay now you got the weed now it's got
[16:34.950 --> 16:39.390]  to get tested now they want you to test the pre-roll so it has to be rolled up
[16:39.390 --> 16:43.630]  before the testing takes you forever to get the testing back and everything and
[16:43.630 --> 16:49.230]  it's so it's like in general for me I'm like okay well there you're already
[16:49.230 --> 16:53.710]  looking at it being to me it's degraded but because people are gonna be buying
[16:53.830 --> 16:56.990]  pre-rolls I'm like well the pre-rolls a pre-roll if the weed was good that went
[16:56.990 --> 17:01.350]  into it it's gonna be one of one of the better pre-rolls you know but um but
[17:01.350 --> 17:05.350]  it's just a trip because of the whole the way the market is because I would
[17:05.350 --> 17:12.870]  like to be able to say okay here this is weed in a jar on the stick hardly trimmed
[17:12.870 --> 17:17.110]  you can really look at it you can see where those outer leaves super healthy
[17:17.110 --> 17:21.870]  was it you know how the weed like I like to look at it like that people always
[17:21.870 --> 17:25.110]  look at my weed I carry in there like you didn't trim it I'm like you yeah I
[17:25.110 --> 17:27.750]  didn't trim it but look at it you know you can see what it is you can see the
[17:27.750 --> 17:31.710]  features you can see how far the resin grows out on the leaves like if someone
[17:31.710 --> 17:35.710]  gives me weed and it's and it's the big leaves removed then I'm happy with that
[17:35.710 --> 17:40.030]  when I pull off those leaves I'm seeing it completely untouched but that's not
[17:40.030 --> 17:43.710]  gonna work on the on the on the market unfortunately because people look at
[17:43.710 --> 17:48.270]  stuff in a jar they want to just like what people call poodle cut they want it
[17:48.270 --> 17:52.070]  cut down it's like oh half the hairs are cut off yeah but it's it's all bud
[17:52.070 --> 17:56.590]  you know it's like well that's cool but it's just weird because with the new
[17:56.590 --> 18:01.510]  thing everything has to be changed and to touch back on what he was talking
[18:01.510 --> 18:06.950]  about with the value of people who are real weed people in the new paradigm of
[18:06.950 --> 18:11.750]  how everything is like I just I came to the realization talking to a buddy of
[18:11.750 --> 18:18.350]  mine you know if you really know something and you really have experience
[18:18.350 --> 18:22.590]  and you've really done stuff you have an advantage over these people who just
[18:22.590 --> 18:34.710]  have really deep pockets so I'm really disappointed I understand I understand
[18:34.710 --> 18:39.830]  like the reality that people see okay here's this opportunity so I'm gonna
[18:39.990 --> 18:44.790]  bring this to the table and basically they have deep pockets and I have this
[18:44.790 --> 18:49.150]  knowledge but what people are gonna start to understand and I mean like all
[18:49.150 --> 18:54.430]  just tell all you right now so you can maybe hear it before you have to learn
[18:54.430 --> 19:00.550]  for yourself those people basically you're disposable so information only
[19:00.550 --> 19:04.550]  goes as far as information goes and as soon as they have your information or
[19:04.550 --> 19:09.350]  they have your whatever they're getting from you they're gonna throw you away so
[19:09.950 --> 19:13.430]  it doesn't matter what kind of contract you have or any of that if these people
[19:13.430 --> 19:16.790]  have that deep of pockets they're there they're eventually they're gonna shit on
[19:16.790 --> 19:24.350]  you you know so that's just a point that I wanted to bring up that if you have
[19:24.350 --> 19:29.030]  something and there's the you got these big investors or whoever they are these
[19:29.030 --> 19:33.190]  big corporate dudes and they're like we we gotta have this and they want it oh
[19:33.190 --> 19:36.790]  we're gonna give you all this money and do all this shit like don't give it to
[19:36.790 --> 19:42.230]  them watch them fail and then help people who you know are actually trying
[19:42.230 --> 19:47.190]  to make it and then you'll have this huge advantage but the problem is that
[19:47.190 --> 19:51.790]  we're all down a little bit right now everything's messed up so when you see
[19:51.790 --> 19:55.390]  an opportunity you go well I better not everything's going to shit so I better
[19:55.390 --> 19:59.830]  jump on the opportunities but it's almost like like an analogy would be
[19:59.830 --> 20:06.630]  like all right well we've almost fished out all the salmon so I should just go
[20:06.630 --> 20:10.390]  fish a shitload before they're gone or we've almost cut down all the old growth
[20:10.390 --> 20:14.150]  redwood so I better cut down my old growth redwood before it's gone but
[20:14.150 --> 20:17.630]  people are taking this really priceless valuable stuff and they're giving it to
[20:17.630 --> 20:22.510]  the man basically and then they're just getting fucked and then these dudes are
[20:22.510 --> 20:28.430]  coming up with these with this killer you know these killer ways of operating
[20:28.430 --> 20:31.730]  and in a lot of cases they can't really understand it anyway they still need the
[20:31.730 --> 20:35.230]  people but I've just been seeing with a lot of people they're like oh yeah well
[20:35.230 --> 20:38.230]  we you know we need you for this we need you for that people get these jobs
[20:38.230 --> 20:43.830]  they do it it gets a little bit further in and they go ah you know it's like the
[20:43.830 --> 20:49.510]  old the old Eddie Murphy you know hey what do you say we kick what do you say
[20:49.510 --> 20:53.230]  we kick Clarence out of the band and steal all his good ideas with the with
[20:53.230 --> 20:56.950]  the Beatles you know the fifth Beatle is like okay cool we'll just kick you out
[20:56.950 --> 21:00.510]  and take all your shit you know and that's kind of what's happening with
[21:00.510 --> 21:04.590]  with everything and that's what he was talking about with like okay you have
[21:04.590 --> 21:08.350]  these things of value so if you have something of value and people are
[21:08.350 --> 21:11.590]  basically trying to take it from you it's like it's just it's a bummer
[21:11.590 --> 21:17.070]  because a lot of people have really helped the assholes to get further and
[21:17.070 --> 21:22.950]  then it's not they're not really gonna wind up getting anything and so if if
[21:22.950 --> 21:27.550]  they need to take I mean everybody here who's been doing stuff for a long time
[21:27.550 --> 21:31.190]  remembers when you first tried to grow really good weed and you first tried to
[21:31.190 --> 21:34.430]  dry it right and you first tried to have everything come out and you saw
[21:34.430 --> 21:38.190]  your buddy's weed and you went man his his weeds always better than mine and
[21:38.190 --> 21:41.670]  that's how these guys would have to deal for a long time but then they're getting
[21:41.670 --> 21:46.950]  people basically like us to come in and tell them how to do everything right and
[21:46.950 --> 21:49.950]  they're they're basically gonna they're gonna get your ideas and they're gonna
[21:49.950 --> 21:54.190]  throw you away so as much as you can it's like you want to these things are
[21:54.190 --> 21:59.070]  so cool because right now I know anybody who wants to come to something like this
[21:59.070 --> 22:04.110]  isn't a bunch of assholes essentially like all you guys are looking at a
[22:04.110 --> 22:09.630]  different aspect of it and like to me that's that's where it should be going
[22:09.630 --> 22:13.830]  and that should almost be that should almost be locked off from the from
[22:13.830 --> 22:17.750]  everything else it's like you want everyone to get the information but at
[22:17.750 --> 22:21.790]  the same time it's like you gotta you gotta keep it out of the wrong hands a
[22:21.790 --> 22:24.950]  little bit too because it's getting it's getting watered down and you see it fast
[22:24.950 --> 22:28.670]  and I've just been hearing so many horror stories from buddies who are like yeah
[22:28.670 --> 22:31.990]  they put me on they're gonna do this they're gonna use my genetics they're
[22:31.990 --> 22:35.230]  gonna do all this and then pretty soon they're like damn and then I showed up
[22:35.230 --> 22:39.950]  at the meeting and they said like I'm out but they got all my ideas I did the
[22:39.950 --> 22:42.950]  whole thing but they're the ones with the deep pockets and I don't you don't
[22:42.950 --> 22:46.110]  have lawyers that can battle their lawyer so now what am I gonna do you
[22:46.110 --> 22:50.590]  know but anyway I was something that he said and that was you know it's just the
[22:50.590 --> 22:55.590]  new the new thing is crazy so try to you know what brought that to mind was
[22:55.590 --> 23:00.350]  talking about like you know being able to market being able to leverage things
[23:00.350 --> 23:05.030]  trying to basically find the people to help out who you know are like-minded
[23:05.030 --> 23:10.350]  and don't just look for the the golden goose and try to jump on it keep you can
[23:10.350 --> 23:14.390]  keep your things small you can do something you can still just grow some
[23:14.390 --> 23:18.950]  weed you can still just sell a little and not chase after this idea it's like
[23:18.950 --> 23:21.910]  it's got to be two worlds because there's the one world that's going on
[23:21.910 --> 23:24.870]  that everybody's overly ambitious going for that and then there's the world that
[23:24.870 --> 23:30.870]  basically all you guys are in and it just like really don't even get caught
[23:30.870 --> 23:35.510]  up thinking that any of that is has any value really for any of us you know but
[23:35.510 --> 23:40.590]  no no it's it's real you you have to believe that you the problem is if
[23:40.590 --> 23:45.750]  people think that if you don't get it solved right now you're not gonna solve
[23:45.750 --> 23:52.590]  it and you didn't get here in a year took your whole life to get here yeah so
[23:52.590 --> 23:56.950]  so you might as well just keep marching forward and be intelligent and for me
[23:56.950 --> 24:00.470]  people try to access stuff for me but it's I'm good at picking up sneaky shit
[24:00.470 --> 24:06.110]  and so I like to play with you but new people are coming to pick it up and they
[24:06.110 --> 24:10.750]  send people to talk to you but the thing is they have a very directed questioning
[24:10.750 --> 24:16.230]  it's and you can pick it up because it's it's not organically derived it's
[24:16.230 --> 24:21.950]  scripted and then once you get that now you can trounce those guys too and be
[24:21.950 --> 24:26.270]  careful with who you endorse if you have a good reputation for what you do
[24:26.270 --> 24:30.750]  be careful because they can take it from you and then it's no longer yours and
[24:30.750 --> 24:34.470]  that's what you've worked for this whole time really is a level of integrity and
[24:34.470 --> 24:38.510]  trust to where nobody's perfect but for the most part you're pretty reliable
[24:38.510 --> 24:43.590]  that's something that is is called goodwill in business and goodwill is
[24:43.590 --> 24:48.830]  very very valuable and the people that are coming in need the goodwill so they
[24:48.870 --> 24:54.350]  can then make their marketing occur and get trust and buy-in and what you get
[24:54.350 --> 24:58.150]  left is is basically nothing and it doesn't mean you can't work with
[24:58.150 --> 25:02.990]  individuals but like in my case if I do anything contractual I have my own
[25:02.990 --> 25:07.710]  lawyers write the contracts and I pay for that so I have my own lawyers come
[25:07.710 --> 25:10.150]  with me even though people go no no we don't need a lawyer I said yeah I always
[25:10.150 --> 25:13.550]  need a lawyer when I go to court I bring an attorney because I know they're gonna
[25:13.550 --> 25:17.470]  talk a language that I really don't understand and I was equated to bring in
[25:17.470 --> 25:21.350]  Mike Tyson to a bar fight that if you had to get into a bar fight and you went
[25:21.350 --> 25:25.550]  with Mike Tyson he would say I got this I'm really good at this let me handle
[25:25.550 --> 25:31.950]  this part of it and you now just keep an eye on my back and that's kind of how I
[25:31.950 --> 25:36.310]  see the stuff that we're working with but man you know every time you have to
[25:36.310 --> 25:39.470]  put the money out to cover the attorney to do the deal it's your money and
[25:39.470 --> 25:42.910]  they're they're cash driving us and that's really why we don't we always
[25:42.910 --> 25:46.390]  bring back to that common that the people around you are the ones that you
[25:46.390 --> 25:49.790]  got here with and they're the ones that you're gonna have to team up with and
[25:49.790 --> 25:55.030]  share resources with and in some cases it's not a bad thing to put the farm
[25:55.030 --> 26:00.390]  down for a season and not farm it if you can't afford to make that product sell
[26:00.390 --> 26:04.310]  it'd be better to let it sit for a season and go get a job working with
[26:04.310 --> 26:08.270]  your other friends on their farm and then pick up the operation again because
[26:08.270 --> 26:12.510]  I let my own farm sit last year the way that way it worked with permitting was
[26:12.510 --> 26:16.670]  they wanted to put me off until August on a plant and I said no why would I
[26:16.670 --> 26:22.070]  want to plant in August so I said it's better that I don't and I won't pay the
[26:22.070 --> 26:25.870]  excise I won't have to pay the taxes and I'll just have to make sure I work
[26:25.870 --> 26:29.590]  harder on my other stuff because I'm not gonna get there the income that I had
[26:29.590 --> 26:33.310]  hoped to get from the farm but I also realized that there was no guarantee on
[26:33.310 --> 26:39.330]  the income either and so if you start playing this game of desperation you put
[26:39.330 --> 26:42.650]  yourself in a situation you can't get out of and if you take a look at your
[26:42.650 --> 26:46.530]  whole life every major screw-up you made you made out of desperation because it
[26:46.530 --> 26:50.490]  took away good judgment and so this is some important stuff to really understand
[26:50.490 --> 26:56.050]  Jason Jason's been a busy boy man you're somebody that like I follow the drops
[26:56.050 --> 27:00.690]  and I mean I don't know if anybody drives more than him like literally when
[27:00.690 --> 27:04.290]  I met him at his his car looked like he had put it together with duct tape and
[27:04.930 --> 27:09.890]  he's like bro I'm doing a lot of driving and then I see him in a new car and he's
[27:09.890 --> 27:15.330]  like bro I'm doing a lot of driving and but he's getting his product out into
[27:15.330 --> 27:22.770]  the market in a really good way and it's interesting product and so you know what
[27:22.770 --> 27:26.730]  do you been doing thank you thank you Kev yeah I've been I've been busy that's
[27:26.730 --> 27:34.770]  for sure and still investor free still broke still just in the struggle like
[27:34.770 --> 27:44.530]  all you it was really good listening to you guys talk because the the sharks are
[27:44.530 --> 27:48.610]  out there and it was everything you guys were saying is everything that I've been
[27:48.610 --> 27:52.490]  going through for the past couple years and just feeling desperate feeling like
[27:52.490 --> 27:56.490]  you want to go talk to these people that say that they got solutions for you and
[27:56.490 --> 28:00.650]  they really don't at the end they just want to hear you talk they just want to
[28:00.650 --> 28:05.050]  you know put the tape on record and let you just go and so okay so we captured
[28:05.050 --> 28:08.730]  that all right now let's go tempt the next guy and try to get what he's got
[28:08.730 --> 28:13.330]  and none of those none of those things ever amounted to anything other than me
[28:13.330 --> 28:20.090]  spinning my wheels in front of a bunch of people and would have been better off
[28:20.090 --> 28:23.250]  just going and getting a job working for somebody else if that was what I was
[28:23.250 --> 28:28.210]  gonna keep doing it it's exactly what you said you you maybe you get a
[28:28.210 --> 28:33.970]  contract even that's solid as can be and they can still switch things up a month
[28:33.970 --> 28:37.650]  or two down the road they've got your cuts they've got your seeds or whatever
[28:37.650 --> 28:41.690]  they've got all your plan how you do it and then now they got some other dude
[28:41.690 --> 28:45.530]  they hired for $12 an hour to go and do everything that you were doing and
[28:45.530 --> 28:50.730]  that's not gonna happen if you're self-employed doing it for you with your
[28:50.730 --> 29:03.940]  friends with people that you have real relationships with and so yeah and so
[29:03.940 --> 29:08.860]  I'm still I'm still struggling I'm still at this I'm still driving miles and you
[29:08.860 --> 29:14.780]  know and hopefully for many more years I came here you know to California almost
[29:14.780 --> 29:19.180]  you know penniless the few hundred bucks in my pocket lived in a bathroom for
[29:19.180 --> 29:26.380]  seven months in East Oakland and you know I still go back to there sometimes
[29:26.380 --> 29:31.500]  where it's like I'm doing all right I was all right then and I'm all right now
[29:31.500 --> 29:37.740]  you know so it's all about feeling inside you and getting desperate is like
[29:37.740 --> 29:43.060]  it's kind of like you have this vision of like oh I could be with this big
[29:43.060 --> 29:49.860]  group doing all these fancy things but like you there's you're not gonna do
[29:49.860 --> 29:55.500]  that or it's very unlikely and then you then you try to see what kind of
[29:55.500 --> 30:01.740]  compromises you can make to achieve that and I feel like a lot of that is just
[30:01.740 --> 30:06.100]  it's smoke and mirrors like the folks that are out there doing this you can
[30:06.100 --> 30:11.780]  can probably they're gonna make it really tough in the next few years I
[30:11.780 --> 30:16.740]  hear people talking about that they're gonna be selling below cost in the
[30:16.740 --> 30:19.580]  future there's gonna be big groups you guys already know all their names
[30:19.580 --> 30:25.380]  they're out there and they're they're out there to crush and we're gonna have
[30:25.380 --> 30:31.140]  to have something unique and special and highlight the people aspect of this more
[30:31.140 --> 30:37.540]  than anything and the the the community is why I'm part of this that's why I
[30:37.540 --> 30:42.860]  wanted to make seeds because I want to make the seeds for future generations
[30:42.860 --> 30:46.380]  for for other people past when I'm dead and gone are gonna be going and growing
[30:46.380 --> 30:50.740]  these strains you know I don't feel like if I've released a seed and you guys see
[30:50.740 --> 30:53.300]  on the shelf you can do whatever you want with it you can breed with it you
[30:53.300 --> 30:56.220]  could share it with your friends I'm not gonna take any offense to anybody
[30:56.220 --> 30:59.140]  working with my work because that's what I'm doing with other people's work I
[30:59.140 --> 31:02.380]  didn't invent cannabis I didn't create any of this stuff I'm just making my own
[31:02.500 --> 31:14.300]  crosses trying to provide to the other people in the world and so you know so I
[31:14.300 --> 31:20.740]  just try to try to stay humble and you know keep keep doing the work that makes
[31:20.740 --> 31:24.020]  me feel good and it's serving the community and being a part of the
[31:24.020 --> 31:27.860]  community and feeling like I'm part of a family that that makes me want to get up
[31:27.860 --> 31:33.940]  in the morning go do things so so you know that's that's that's why you know
[31:33.940 --> 31:40.620]  that's why I came all the way out here to see all you guys and back to what I
[31:40.620 --> 31:46.820]  was saying before about what's going on with the cannabis laws where nobody that
[31:46.820 --> 31:51.340]  I knew in the game two years ago was even allowed to participate anymore like
[31:51.340 --> 31:57.060]  so I don't know the answer to that but I know that that's not what I was working
[31:57.220 --> 32:01.900]  for when I was working for you know the the students for sensible drug policy
[32:01.900 --> 32:05.380]  and drug policy alliance and and these other big groups that that I've
[32:05.380 --> 32:11.100]  definitely you know put in a lot of volunteer hours for and I feel like
[32:11.100 --> 32:16.060]  there's there's still a lot to be desired in in California cannabis you
[32:16.060 --> 32:20.900]  know we're supposed to be ground zero for for the best cannabis in the world
[32:20.900 --> 32:25.540]  and I see the community that carried the water for so many years through the
[32:25.540 --> 32:29.380]  scary times being shut out of this thing where you know other folks are
[32:29.380 --> 32:32.300]  jumping in that that didn't have anything they've never they've never had
[32:32.300 --> 32:38.820]  dirt under their fingernails and like I said I don't know the answer but but
[32:38.820 --> 32:42.940]  something tells me it comes through community and us getting together and
[32:42.940 --> 32:47.300]  and strengthen numbers and making sure that we get active at the local level
[32:47.300 --> 33:02.430]  and at the state level it's gonna be hard to follow you what I was curious
[33:02.430 --> 33:07.190]  is uh you're all working on interesting stuff and I know some of the work you're
[33:07.190 --> 33:11.630]  doing all three you but you're always constantly refining and switching
[33:11.630 --> 33:15.230]  process what's something you excited about this year you know whether it
[33:15.230 --> 33:18.070]  whether it's for the market or not but like what's something you're into
[33:18.070 --> 33:23.310]  yourself that you're working with you'd like to see people access in any form
[33:23.910 --> 33:30.710]  gosh so many things but I want to say on what Jason had brought up and what
[33:30.710 --> 33:38.750]  mean gene brought up Beth did did you speak this weekend Beth Schechter hi okay
[33:38.750 --> 33:46.630]  so the open cannabis project looks to protect the cultivars the strains that
[33:46.630 --> 33:52.550]  we're all you know we've known and loved for a long time and and hopefully
[33:52.550 --> 33:57.190]  combinations of all of them so that we can all keep doing the work that we've
[33:57.190 --> 34:02.710]  been doing breeding and cultivating and it's a nonprofit organization and
[34:02.710 --> 34:11.350]  there's definitely gonna be some big bad wolves come in to get genetics and it's
[34:11.350 --> 34:15.830]  really hard that what do you do you hide them away like don't give them away you
[34:15.830 --> 34:21.070]  know don't come to an event like this and and say here have a few of this and
[34:21.070 --> 34:24.230]  a few of that because you know maybe there's somebody in the room or
[34:24.230 --> 34:32.590]  something you it's almost impossible and so we just got a kind of support an
[34:32.590 --> 34:40.010]  organization like that is really the best way that we can keep cannabis open
[34:40.010 --> 34:47.970]  source and keep like the genetics of cannabis accessible to everybody because
[34:47.970 --> 34:54.850]  the Syngentas and the Monsantos would like to you know just tie up all of
[34:54.850 --> 34:59.610]  these strains and of course there's this phenomena that's unusual where something
[34:59.610 --> 35:07.250]  has been in under prohibition for you know since in all of modern times it has
[35:07.250 --> 35:14.090]  been basically illegal so you know any innovation that has happened has not
[35:14.090 --> 35:20.530]  been documented because you know just like at Humboldt seed company we keep
[35:20.530 --> 35:25.050]  frickin notes during the breeding season and then burn them in the fall because
[35:25.050 --> 35:29.570]  it was like you know I'm not trying to keep notes around about you know how
[35:29.570 --> 35:35.650]  many goddamn plants I had and you know so a charge enhancement back in the day
[35:35.650 --> 35:39.770]  what's that charge enhancement you know if you were in the game I caught an
[35:39.770 --> 35:43.410]  extra couple years on a case I had to fight because I had spreadsheets
[35:43.410 --> 35:47.610]  comparing operations and it gave me a criminal mastermind charge and we all
[35:47.610 --> 35:51.610]  laughed and I said if I was so smart I wouldn't get fucking caught but
[35:51.610 --> 35:56.490]  nonetheless the enhancement was really punishing because I was using tools to
[35:56.490 --> 36:00.370]  document work it was impossible to keep this much data when you're running
[36:00.370 --> 36:04.210]  this many operations and I had my hand in a lot of cookie jars way back in the
[36:04.210 --> 36:10.530]  day yeah you know and so you know those those folks that look to capitalize so
[36:10.530 --> 36:17.050]  much could easily come in and and try to you know to say that they've created
[36:17.050 --> 36:23.330]  something that's new when really mean genes been breeding it for 20 goddamn
[36:23.330 --> 36:28.650]  years and you know so on and so forth so that's a good organization to support I
[36:28.650 --> 36:36.730]  really appreciate what Beth's done and you know as far as some exciting stuff
[36:36.730 --> 36:42.050]  that we're doing I think you know really that big phenotype hunt effort was
[36:42.050 --> 36:50.210]  exciting for me and what else is you gonna are you gonna release the product
[36:50.210 --> 36:57.890]  this year so we'll be dropping the sort of selected cuts like Daniel's
[36:57.890 --> 37:04.370]  farm we picked one that we're calling magic melon and that one just really
[37:04.370 --> 37:13.530]  smells like melons and it's kind of gassy fuel finish but yeah I don't know
[37:13.530 --> 37:23.050]  I just I feel really just happy to be able to work on in cannabis and share
[37:23.170 --> 37:31.870]  share the the genetics and and definitely like what I got an email the
[37:31.870 --> 37:37.490]  other day and I looked at the email and I thought it was kind of weird it it
[37:37.490 --> 37:44.370]  said burpee in the email and so I replied to the email and did some
[37:44.370 --> 37:49.850]  fishing and sure enough it was burpee and I don't really I don't know like are
[37:49.850 --> 37:53.810]  they big bad wolf or not I mean I don't I didn't follow the corporate ladder all
[37:53.810 --> 38:01.250]  the way up but that's the kind of stuff that's happening so definitely be
[38:01.250 --> 38:09.090]  careful but you just gotta we got to keep charging forward and so exciting
[38:09.090 --> 38:17.690]  things just breeding more and more all the time and and we're doing some
[38:17.730 --> 38:24.170]  genotyping and putting it in the public space so that's a way that you can once
[38:24.170 --> 38:33.490]  you do that if you don't patent it in a year then it becomes public public
[38:33.490 --> 38:43.050]  domain and so that's what I would call defensive IP versus offensive IP which
[38:43.050 --> 38:50.010]  is getting a patent and you know sending out cease and desist letters to
[38:50.010 --> 38:55.730]  everybody in the room who doesn't pay you a fee for for growing it or whatever
[38:55.730 --> 39:00.610]  and I think that there's you know I'm not saying I'm completely opposed to
[39:00.610 --> 39:11.730]  patents but I think definitely that it's it's a slippery slope and so you know
[39:11.810 --> 39:17.690]  there's a lot of things out there that just are that should just be public
[39:17.690 --> 39:23.090]  domain I mean if I could just take a snapshot of the whole cannabis space
[39:23.090 --> 39:27.930]  right now and make sure that that could continue to be the way it is and people
[39:27.930 --> 39:33.810]  could continue to grow the plant I think that would be a good thing to do but it
[39:33.810 --> 39:40.490]  costs costs a lot of money to genotype so you know that and that's not the only
[39:40.570 --> 39:47.690]  solution to there's other ways to go about it but yeah so that's that's
[39:47.690 --> 39:50.250]  exciting
[39:52.810 --> 39:56.770]  I don't mean to doom and gloom you know no but what the thing is though it's
[39:56.770 --> 40:01.410]  hard we're all in the real everyone in the room is in the real yeah and and a
[40:01.410 --> 40:04.890]  lot of it is the struggle because that's so much the reality of what you're
[40:04.890 --> 40:08.930]  having to deal with and when what I want it what I want to make sure though is
[40:08.930 --> 40:14.930]  that the things that you see and that interest you because you guys are you're
[40:14.930 --> 40:20.570]  the painters that create the ink that we use to do our work and so you know you
[40:20.570 --> 40:23.290]  see you broke out the melon and so the thing was you say hey no what we found
[40:23.290 --> 40:26.530]  was something that was unbelievably Melanie with the beautiful fuel back and
[40:26.530 --> 40:30.410]  we think it'll be attractive and it'll be valuable for the market and and that
[40:30.410 --> 40:35.050]  that's that's what I'm seeking from it and and the part about us all struggling
[40:35.050 --> 40:38.570]  is is as real as it can be and and I try to make light of it because otherwise
[40:38.570 --> 40:44.610]  you call him a cry and you know and tissue paper is expensive so what about
[40:44.610 --> 40:48.970]  you big gene what you what you messing around with what directions you go with
[40:48.970 --> 40:52.170]  your lines because you you work some some lines that you've had for a long
[40:52.170 --> 40:55.770]  time but you switch the direction on them and it's kind of neat because it
[40:55.770 --> 41:01.210]  lets you swing a picture yeah I mean what I'd really like to do is do I'll do
[41:01.210 --> 41:09.850]  the I'll do those fresh hybrids and then try to go through and seed a lot of
[41:09.850 --> 41:13.850]  plants every time I do anything so then I think you can go in all these
[41:13.850 --> 41:19.210]  different directions so when you make that that fresh hybrid you get you know
[41:19.210 --> 41:24.690]  if stuff is if stuff is fairly consistent you start with then you get a
[41:24.690 --> 41:29.490]  pretty you get a pretty it's pretty predictable to know what you're gonna
[41:29.490 --> 41:32.730]  get but then when you make that f2 you get all the weirdness and then when you
[41:32.730 --> 41:36.010]  go when you get all the weirdness then that's where you can really you can make
[41:36.010 --> 41:42.810]  one thing into a million things you know so with with some of them I've tried to
[41:42.810 --> 41:46.370]  take them different directions and then some of them is just a real clear
[41:46.370 --> 41:51.570]  direction but like um this year I'm really trying to work on like the root
[41:51.570 --> 41:58.410]  beer stuff that's really cool because it's it's a trip like with doing seeds
[41:58.410 --> 42:01.890]  there's a whole lot of seeds that are really interesting and they're and
[42:01.890 --> 42:07.130]  they're awesome and like they all are you know really valid in the space as
[42:07.130 --> 42:10.570]  far as going okay we need to have all these things but it's really a trip
[42:10.570 --> 42:14.610]  because when you go to actually sell a lot of weed it kind of has to look a
[42:14.610 --> 42:19.970]  certain way it has to have you know there has to be something about it where
[42:19.970 --> 42:24.610]  it's like okay that's shiny that has people really like a little color to it
[42:24.610 --> 42:29.650]  it has to at least have a silver look if not dark or purple or blue or red or
[42:29.650 --> 42:34.010]  whatever you know regular green bud better be really tasty and really stinky
[42:34.010 --> 42:38.330]  to be able to compete you know so like the root beer is a cool one because of
[42:38.330 --> 42:42.570]  the the way it smokes the way it grows all that stuff so this year I'm trying
[42:42.570 --> 42:48.290]  to do like I back cross to that clone twice and the original mail I started
[42:48.290 --> 42:54.770]  with was almost the same thing so it was already pretty consistent right away
[42:54.770 --> 42:59.970]  and then going back to it a couple times made it made it really nice and then
[42:59.970 --> 43:05.170]  what I'm gonna try to do with that is I'll probably go back one more time to
[43:05.170 --> 43:09.210]  the root beer clone to make it so that this like really root beer seed because
[43:09.210 --> 43:12.210]  it has got more and more frequent when you back cross not everything does that
[43:12.210 --> 43:16.410]  if it's too inconsistent it throws too much weird stuff you know but it comes
[43:16.530 --> 43:20.850]  through so it dominates in the crosses and and then but I think what I'm gonna
[43:20.850 --> 43:24.410]  do while it's still just a little more open at the at the at the two back
[43:24.410 --> 43:29.570]  crosses I'm probably gonna do a bunch of out crosses of it this year and then do
[43:29.570 --> 43:35.730]  the same thing with the cherry limeade and the reason being that when you get
[43:35.730 --> 43:38.570]  like if you go to get clones from somebody you know how it is it's like
[43:38.570 --> 43:43.050]  you have to everything's cool to have some like okay I'm gonna have some of
[43:43.770 --> 43:48.370]  that but when people like want units and weight of something you have to be able
[43:48.370 --> 43:51.370]  to have something that people look at and even if they don't know the name
[43:51.370 --> 43:56.810]  it's recognizably what they is in their paradigm of what's the dank some of the
[43:56.810 --> 44:00.570]  best weed might look like shoelaces and be all messed up and look like dr.
[44:00.570 --> 44:05.050]  Greenspoon or something you know but when you when you really want something
[44:05.050 --> 44:10.330]  that you can have in your bag to people go okay you just want that instant yep
[44:10.330 --> 44:15.450]  there it is and so those are things that do that you open the bag I want
[44:15.450 --> 44:23.370]  that so like I'm trying to do that because when you you know you want to
[44:23.370 --> 44:26.690]  have plants that grow well for you as a farmer and then you need a product
[44:26.690 --> 44:30.330]  that's really gonna be that thing and that's the whole thing I was talking
[44:30.330 --> 44:33.610]  about with like with brand recognitions like people go oh it's hype it's hype
[44:33.610 --> 44:39.250]  it's hype it's like well hype hype doesn't last so like I remember when
[44:39.250 --> 44:42.730]  cookies came out it was like that's hype it's not good it's like well maybe
[44:42.730 --> 44:48.730]  it's not as good as it's not as strong as headband or cam or whatever is your
[44:48.730 --> 44:55.090]  thing but you're you know it's like if it was just hype it wouldn't be here ten
[44:55.090 --> 44:59.710]  years after I got it it's still here and all the crosses are still that and when
[44:59.710 --> 45:04.610]  you really get into it you go okay this is cool stuff and but the reason why
[45:04.610 --> 45:08.050]  it's valuable to grow it is because you know when you finish it you can sell it
[45:08.050 --> 45:12.570]  like if you're a tomato farmer you know most people are gonna wind up like okay
[45:12.570 --> 45:16.770]  this one has shelf life it's good boom we're gonna grow these Romas we want to
[45:16.770 --> 45:20.650]  grow these really cool heirloom rainbow tomatoes but when you go in the store
[45:20.650 --> 45:25.290]  there's only a little bit of those the over here you got this whole tier of
[45:25.290 --> 45:28.410]  these Romas over here what our beefsteaks or whatever so we're gonna
[45:28.410 --> 45:33.370]  grow those so you need things to fit in people's paradigm so I'm trying to put
[45:33.370 --> 45:37.490]  out some stuff that's really like people go oh it's the hype stuff oh it's just
[45:37.490 --> 45:41.610]  it's another gelato cross it's this or it's that but it's a trip because if you
[45:41.610 --> 45:45.170]  don't have something that people on a knee-jerk reaction will look at and go
[45:45.170 --> 45:49.130]  that's the stuff that's what everybody wants then are you do you really want to
[45:49.130 --> 45:53.130]  have 350 pounds of it and you you want to you want to have a quarter pound for
[45:53.130 --> 45:56.810]  your head or whatever to share and you know maybe you got somebody who wants
[45:56.810 --> 46:00.730]  this or that but you know I'm just trying to really make sure that like the
[46:00.730 --> 46:05.210]  stuff that I'm putting out is stuff that when you're done with it it's what
[46:05.210 --> 46:08.730]  people come back that's like this last stuff I released was like I had that
[46:08.730 --> 46:14.130]  pina the pina a lot of times a CBD plant but it's super hardy it structures great
[46:14.130 --> 46:19.130]  it does will not get p.m. it's like so easy in such a great you know you could
[46:19.130 --> 46:22.930]  probably dry farm and I haven't tried but I have seen my buddy leave the pina
[46:22.930 --> 46:28.290]  cross cherries that I made in some three gallon pots basically in a in a desert
[46:28.290 --> 46:33.250]  in a in a greenhouse that wasn't being grown in so it was like a hundred and
[46:33.250 --> 46:37.290]  thirty degree desert in there every day and the plants he watered them when they
[46:37.290 --> 46:40.930]  were starts they never grew but then they budded and they finished and there
[46:40.930 --> 46:45.170]  was this killer weed in there that we basically found going to his house and
[46:45.170 --> 46:49.930]  I was like well that's got value too you know but it but it's weed that when
[46:49.930 --> 46:54.490]  people you know it originally I was like it's CBD people only want kush I'd have
[46:54.490 --> 46:57.570]  a little bit of it people would show up and they'd be like no we want more of
[46:57.570 --> 47:01.890]  those we want that one so that's you know something trying trying to put
[47:02.050 --> 47:06.730]  stuff out that's actually like can really be practical for people that are
[47:06.730 --> 47:10.250]  farming it's like the sky color kush like that's Nikonas favorite weed you
[47:10.250 --> 47:13.930]  know it's like got the knee-jerk okay this is cool I understand it it smells
[47:13.930 --> 47:19.810]  gassy it's but as a grower too it's really performing you know so that's
[47:19.810 --> 47:26.010]  just the focus of like the stuff that I'm working on in general is to be like
[47:26.010 --> 47:30.410]  that like I love the lime and the lime is great but the lime is a little bit
[47:30.410 --> 47:34.930]  more it's a little more leafy when you grow it it's so I'm trying to work it
[47:34.930 --> 47:38.250]  into a little bit more different stuff so it's like cross it back with the OG
[47:38.250 --> 47:42.250]  keeps the nose gets a little meat on the bones that's what the lime pop kush is
[47:42.250 --> 47:45.530]  you get the huge plants if you're growing big plants so I've been working
[47:45.530 --> 47:50.770]  on that but then I made like I took like the cherry limeade f5 and I put it on
[47:50.770 --> 47:55.890]  gelato sherb you know things that you're like oh that's a stupid but it's like
[47:55.890 --> 48:00.330]  yeah but that's what people want in their bag to buy so you you got to have
[48:00.330 --> 48:03.690]  that you know what I mean so that's kind of the stuff I've been I've been trying
[48:03.690 --> 48:08.610]  to work on more stuff that's like that and then at the same time I'm always
[48:08.610 --> 48:14.530]  doing my regular stuff that's for me that I you know that I that I vibe with
[48:14.530 --> 48:19.010]  even more but I you know you can't help but but also vibe with something that
[48:19.010 --> 48:24.370]  you look at and you go whoa well that's incredible I mean I went to the ego
[48:24.370 --> 48:28.370]  clash in Hopland down there and I saw all the stuff and everybody go I walked
[48:28.370 --> 48:33.090]  up and they go which one which one you know would you say would be good out of
[48:33.090 --> 48:37.610]  there and I missed the part where you smoke and all that and I just looked in
[48:37.610 --> 48:42.570]  the case and I was all that number 14 that looks like that's that's fire right
[48:42.570 --> 48:45.570]  there I don't know what it is but it looks good it's got that good old-school
[48:45.570 --> 48:49.570]  Gany frosted up look and then they announced the winner and they're like
[48:49.570 --> 48:55.010]  oh the number 14 gelato 41 or something you know and I was like oh all right
[48:55.010 --> 49:00.050]  well I mean you can't really argue with you can't just I just hype cookie
[49:00.050 --> 49:04.170]  strain whatever it's like you can't you can't argue you know yeah I learned that
[49:04.170 --> 49:08.410]  from a guy that was in fashion and and I've I've not historically been known as
[49:08.410 --> 49:12.250]  someone who's been fashionable so I asked people who are fashionable about
[49:12.250 --> 49:17.210]  you know fashion yeah and they said you can't argue with trends that people do
[49:17.210 --> 49:19.530]  because what you're saying is that you're not intelligent enough to
[49:19.530 --> 49:23.410]  recognize that they made the choice to do it and so what happens is you cut
[49:23.410 --> 49:26.490]  yourself right out of the trend and I think that's the same with what you're
[49:26.490 --> 49:30.710]  talking about the plants at the bottom line is if if 41 cut wasn't hot then why
[49:30.710 --> 49:35.090]  is it moving at a rate that's supernatural and it doesn't mean you
[49:35.090 --> 49:39.610]  need to jump on it but you need to understand why the why what I learned
[49:39.610 --> 49:42.450]  from someone is tooth there's two things in life those that know how and those
[49:42.450 --> 49:47.050]  that know why and those that know how work for those that know why and for us
[49:47.050 --> 49:50.410]  it's the why it's what's important for us otherwise we end up just being how
[49:50.410 --> 49:54.530]  how do we make it and we under want to understand why are we making it and what
[49:54.530 --> 49:58.850]  is that direction and and I agree man I see all these modern cultivars that are
[49:58.850 --> 50:04.010]  red hot and I go I got you some of them aren't my personal preference but I
[50:04.010 --> 50:08.610]  don't deny the fact that it moves at an unbelievable velocity and when you do
[50:08.610 --> 50:14.250]  objective testing where I take I take things that I think are hot and I give
[50:14.250 --> 50:18.410]  them to people who are in markets that are unbelievably picky and they have
[50:18.410 --> 50:24.890]  money which means they have access and I let them run them to find out compared
[50:24.890 --> 50:29.970]  to each other which one has the velocity and then it lets me really understand of
[50:29.970 --> 50:35.130]  these elites which one really is the attraction and why and it also lost it
[50:35.130 --> 50:39.630]  lets me understand which ones didn't I think had the attraction I go whoa the
[50:39.630 --> 50:44.350]  market still likes that but so much of it is that that that visual appearance
[50:44.350 --> 50:49.470]  and you've been trained to choose those things because that's what we've got the
[50:49.470 --> 50:53.670]  last 30 years in cannabis and I always tell people some of the strongest part
[50:53.670 --> 50:57.790]  I ever smoked it looked like it was a piece of cabbage run over by a tractor
[50:57.790 --> 51:02.030]  and it got me so high that I had to drive around the island three times
[51:02.030 --> 51:05.550]  because I couldn't figure out how to get off the highway on the on-ramp and I was
[51:05.550 --> 51:09.310]  I was on Hawaii and I got so lit that I couldn't really get off the freeway and
[51:09.310 --> 51:12.910]  I laughed and I just said screw it I'll just drive it out and at some point I'll
[51:12.910 --> 51:18.070]  come down and I'll be able to figure out how do you get off the freeway you know
[51:18.070 --> 51:24.630]  and I wasn't laughing at the moment I was like whoa I am scorched but if I
[51:24.630 --> 51:27.350]  could get my hands on that again I'd love it but the thing was you know I
[51:27.350 --> 51:32.190]  challenge you to sell it because it looked like it was some cabbage run over
[51:32.190 --> 51:36.590]  by a tractor yeah yeah yeah so that's what that's what it's like you know like
[51:36.590 --> 51:40.950]  oh yeah gelato just gelato cross you know what I mean like I yeah I made a
[51:40.950 --> 51:44.830]  gelato cross I made a sherb cross like the mail I started with though is a f5
[51:44.830 --> 51:49.790]  and those generations to get to add to get to f3 took a while out of the twos
[51:49.790 --> 51:54.310]  to get to the four took a while out of the threes it's not like I just went one
[51:54.310 --> 51:59.430]  two three four five boom man gelato and and even that is a lot of work but you
[51:59.430 --> 52:03.470]  know going along the way to go okay cool we got rid of this we got rid of that I
[52:03.750 --> 52:06.950]  mean I think you probably grew some of the early cherry generations that I had
[52:06.950 --> 52:11.350]  that have all the weird urkel recessives in it that pop out with I still have
[52:11.350 --> 52:15.750]  little duck foot and they're tiny and they won't grow and the weed is amazing
[52:15.750 --> 52:20.110]  incredible anything so you got to get both and then so now like I have cherry
[52:20.110 --> 52:25.250]  lime f6 is and if you grow those they're all big fast vegging plants they all
[52:25.250 --> 52:30.990]  have the same bud structure they all have the super high 5% terpenes at SC
[52:30.990 --> 52:38.470]  18 22% THC real consistent all the same doesn't mold doesn't break doesn't care
[52:38.470 --> 52:43.430]  if it's windy you know and then take that like what I used to make that and
[52:43.430 --> 52:50.270]  then that was outcrossed to these you know height whatever and so then you
[52:50.270 --> 52:54.910]  know with that then you at least know you got some predictability there and at
[52:54.910 --> 52:58.990]  the same time you have marketability so that you you're bringing because you got
[52:58.990 --> 53:04.110]  a there's only so many enthusiasts and all of us enthusiasts can go ahead and
[53:04.110 --> 53:09.150]  go okay cool yeah this is this really rare weed thing you know like this is
[53:09.150 --> 53:14.350]  this trippy like it's it's out there like um like Caleb right now is working
[53:14.350 --> 53:19.350]  with that Australian bastard cannabis and people are like why would you want
[53:19.350 --> 53:22.750]  this and I'm like if you really like plants you want that because it's not
[53:22.750 --> 53:27.150]  the other one you have but you're not gonna go okay I'm gonna switch over my
[53:27.270 --> 53:31.190]  to this people are gonna go once it's trimmed in the bag it probably isn't
[53:31.190 --> 53:33.910]  even different because the leaves are cut off and the leaves are what's cool
[53:33.910 --> 53:37.390]  and it has valuable things and you want to have it in your arsenal I looked
[53:37.390 --> 53:42.230]  right at it and went if I can get a plant that's like a bomb-ass Afghani to
[53:42.230 --> 53:46.670]  grow with this size leaves you're gonna have yields that are gonna crush
[53:46.670 --> 53:51.070]  everything because if you can get a fat bud on something that veg is faster than
[53:51.070 --> 53:55.510]  that with a tiny little leaf it's just gonna get Sun right to the bud the whole
[53:55.590 --> 53:59.510]  way so you're gonna have these huge buds like this but instead of being on the
[53:59.510 --> 54:02.990]  end with these big fat leaves that block everything out you're gonna have them
[54:02.990 --> 54:08.050]  six feet long so that's where you get like the cool stuff and those things are
[54:08.050 --> 54:11.310]  valuable for breeder but you buy a pack of seeds you're like dude I want to grow
[54:11.310 --> 54:15.430]  this and maybe I want to find a clone or I just want to grow these and just have
[54:15.430 --> 54:19.530]  good bud like I try to make sure that my seed you plan a row of it I have to be
[54:19.530 --> 54:23.710]  able to plan a row of it and have 10 or 20 of them in hundreds or three
[54:23.750 --> 54:28.830]  hundreds or whatever and look at him and go okay cool I'm glad I grew that in my
[54:28.830 --> 54:31.950]  garden so that's what I tried to do that's what I try to put out you know
[54:31.950 --> 54:36.670]  but with the new the new stuff too is it's I'm trying to like make sure it's
[54:36.670 --> 54:41.750]  you know always kind of a cutting-edge turps and something that that fits into
[54:41.750 --> 54:46.790]  the picture pre-marketed yeah just to make a smart business yeah and that's
[54:46.790 --> 54:50.150]  what that's what I was saying about but to loop back that's what was cool about
[54:50.230 --> 54:54.030]  the root beer is it almost looks like a cookies or it looks like it's something
[54:54.030 --> 54:57.430]  like that but it's because it has black affe in it way back in it in Hindu and
[54:57.430 --> 55:02.310]  then it has the headband the LA Kush like Mandel had back in the day and so
[55:02.310 --> 55:06.310]  those it makes it like this ultra potent thing like if you're used to smoking
[55:06.310 --> 55:11.110]  cookies and you smoke this you're like whoo okay this is super satisfying smoke
[55:11.110 --> 55:15.110]  you know it breaks up a little better and it's got you know just really killer
[55:15.270 --> 55:20.790]  so those are those are ones that are that are going and that's the that's the
[55:20.790 --> 55:25.230]  thing maintaining those cool that cool all that neat stuff and then being able
[55:25.230 --> 55:29.270]  to go okay here's what we need to be competitive because we do have to be
[55:29.270 --> 55:35.550]  super competitive and all you really need is a plant that is that special and
[55:35.550 --> 55:40.070]  people will go oh okay I got it like it's good it's great for everyone to
[55:40.070 --> 55:44.030]  share everything it's great for everyone to share especially these bulk these
[55:44.750 --> 55:49.390]  bulk gene pools you know what I mean but like if you have your own clone and
[55:49.390 --> 55:52.150]  everyone's like oh you can't get like maybe you don't want to give that clone
[55:52.150 --> 55:54.950]  away because maybe you want to have something that you're like no I know how
[55:54.950 --> 55:58.590]  to do this you might talk to someone's grandma she's like sorry you can't have
[55:58.590 --> 56:04.030]  my cookie recipe no because it's my want to have this I want to win the I want to
[56:04.030 --> 56:07.910]  win the contest at the whatever you know what I mean or whatever it's for like
[56:07.910 --> 56:11.510]  there's a there's a there's something to that you know so like definitely
[56:11.510 --> 56:15.870]  everyone's got to share but it there's a there's a huge edge to being able to
[56:15.870 --> 56:20.950]  go okay I have this thing and I'm the only one with it and it's something for
[56:20.950 --> 56:25.750]  everyone to think about that find that plant where you know you you're you
[56:25.750 --> 56:31.790]  might not be able to sell SFV you're like I I was getting you know three
[56:31.790 --> 56:36.790]  grand for this SFV now people want to give me 600 everything's crashed but
[56:36.790 --> 56:40.870]  then you go to talk to somebody in there like dude I have this one and no matter
[56:40.990 --> 56:46.750]  what everybody my buddies got this Vermont diesel it's like pre sour diesel
[56:46.750 --> 56:50.510]  diesel you know like I don't know if it really is but that's how it is it's like
[56:50.510 --> 56:54.990]  just straight like super skunk it smells like skunk and then underneath it's just
[56:54.990 --> 57:01.550]  like clove and it's super super bomb and he just calls it diesel and anybody who
[57:01.550 --> 57:06.470]  looks at that and they tell you oh sorry this is good indoor but I'm only gonna
[57:06.470 --> 57:10.750]  give you a thousand for it you're like cool where's the next guy because one
[57:10.750 --> 57:15.310]  out of three people who smell this shit are gonna say dude what do you want like
[57:15.310 --> 57:19.950]  if I have that I can sell that to people for whatever I want to ask for it and
[57:19.950 --> 57:23.750]  it's just because people don't all have it if everyone has it people see a bad
[57:23.750 --> 57:29.430]  version of it now all of a sudden it's whatever it is it's cool it's cush but
[57:29.430 --> 57:33.470]  there's definitely like a value in that of looking for your own thing having it
[57:33.470 --> 57:39.470]  and you know being able to being able to run with something that's you know
[57:39.470 --> 57:43.550]  got a little edge on it but so that that's what I'm always doing trying to
[57:43.550 --> 57:54.070]  make stuff like that I took I gee that's absolutely right and you know like when
[57:54.070 --> 58:00.710]  I look around this room I think what the reality is is that so many of us like if
[58:00.710 --> 58:06.150]  you think of it's a race or whatever a racetrack so many of us are actually
[58:06.150 --> 58:12.630]  like lapping the whole industry that it's easy to look like you're behind but
[58:12.630 --> 58:17.110]  we're really all just like so far ahead and so like what gene was saying it's
[58:17.110 --> 58:21.830]  like sometimes you gotta you know give them what they want and so you know you
[58:21.830 --> 58:26.790]  do a few gelato crosses or make sure everything is you know a certain THC
[58:26.830 --> 58:32.390]  level for for the year but never ever give up on those cultivars that like
[58:32.390 --> 58:39.030]  that mean everything to you I mean I can't like back got eight nine years ago
[58:39.030 --> 58:43.590]  people would give me such a hard time to be like why do you have seeds that make
[58:43.590 --> 58:48.510]  purple cannabis like everybody hates purple they were like oh it's it's
[58:48.510 --> 58:53.350]  because it's deficient your your weeds purple because it's deficient in
[58:53.510 --> 58:59.110]  whatever something they tell me and I'd be like no it's it's not and this is
[58:59.110 --> 59:04.350]  like so the trends and I guess the whole lapping thing like we're always like a
[59:04.350 --> 59:09.110]  one lap ahead and sometimes it can look like we're kind of behind the pack but
[59:09.110 --> 59:14.190]  really we're just like ahead of it and nobody knows it yet so I think just for
[59:14.190 --> 59:26.180]  genes you know same thing you got you got a lot of killer stuff you you you
[59:26.180 --> 59:30.500]  work some interesting directions since I've met you and I like that you know
[59:30.500 --> 59:33.540]  you've been you've been really putting together some interesting combinations
[59:33.540 --> 59:38.900]  and the number of people that bring me material that you've done is I got some
[59:38.900 --> 59:41.820]  in my jaw right now someone said man I got some killer equilibrium working I
[59:41.940 --> 59:46.620]  said oh nice what is it and I laugh because each one of those samples was
[59:46.620 --> 59:50.940]  radically different than the other because the lines were different and I
[59:50.940 --> 59:55.460]  I like that when I see people have separation and what they're doing and
[59:55.460 --> 59:59.260]  and your desires to go these different trends and so you've been you've been
[59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.060]  put with some cool stuff what we've been what are you doing what are you going on
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.620]  I'm I think this year I'm gonna try to dig deeper into I've got so many seeds
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:11.100]  and so many things I've collected over the years and I kind of want to I like
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.220]  that branching out in a whole new direction just like kind of out
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.500]  sideways somewhere where maybe it's something that's been sitting on the
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.220]  shelf that I've been meaning to get to forever and I haven't decided anything
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:25.060]  I'm gonna work with yet this year but there's there's a few contenders the
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:29.300]  Malawi lines did really well you know over the years there's been a lot of
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.740]  people coming back seeing the African orange was something that was really
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.620]  mold resistant for them and I've seen some of the flowers and somebody you
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.180]  know brought me some of the flowers today from Humboldt that was that was
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.500]  just probably one of the most citrusy versions of African orange I've ever
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:49.820]  seen and that's certainly a direction I want to go in is things that do well on
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.260]  the coast because I've been in you know I was in Santa Cruz for so many years
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.500]  and it's it's hard to grow almost anything in a lot of the areas around
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:03.820]  that County that's actually where I first saw some mean genes work as I had
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:08.260]  a friend out there that we kind of shared a little patch one year and I
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.300]  guess I guess he he had gotten some seeds from you and he grew the the root
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.780]  beer and we grew the the PK and it was some of your cherry limes and it was
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:23.180]  like Urkel lime I forget some other and they were just beautiful just the Urkel
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.580]  lime was insane especially in light of what you're talking about with the bag
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:32.020]  appeal just like there were just these bulbous buds that just just looked
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.580]  amazing and probably probably the cherry lime out of everything was was the
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.020]  favorite at the end of the year just just getting to smoke it and you know
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.900]  the the root beers were a little later but they just when they when they filled
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:52.300]  in they were like just so turpy and enjoyable and and last year your Humboldt
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.700]  dream was my buddy's biggest plants in the garden last year he's got a picture
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.580]  of him just in the Anderson Valley with this plant that's just like gigantic you
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.340]  know so he's like oh I'm doing this one every year now so you guys kudos to you
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.380]  guys for you know putting out the quality work and I think yeah this year
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.780]  I'm gonna I'm gonna probably pull out some of the other Malawi hybrids maybe
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:20.180]  I've seen a lot a lot of buzz around the chocolate Malawi which is one that that
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.700]  I haven't been working with as much in the past and so maybe pull that one out
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.900]  I think that's probably one at the top of the list it's the chocolate hashberry
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:34.620]  to the heirloom Malawi and you know the the the glue line is when I've been
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:41.100]  working for a little while is trying to find a reliable glue back cross and find
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.380]  a male out of that that I can hit two things and get that you know chocolatey
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:54.900]  gassy aroma and taste out of the hybrids that come through and you know maybe
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.540]  we're gonna pull out some some crazy land races and try work with some you
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:03.220]  know some wild some wild stuff and you know try to try to see what you know
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:09.540]  what else we could put out there that that is gonna be unique it's all about
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:13.620]  setting yourself apart in this industry and yeah like you're saying maybe you
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.220]  find a cut that you don't want to share with people and I would love to hear
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.540]  that somebody found something out of my work that that really worked well for
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:26.580]  them and they wanted to keep around for years and years and and maybe it helped
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:32.980]  keep them afloat in in tough times and so so certainly we're gonna keep working
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:39.540]  for mold resistance which is you know even more of an issue nowadays with you
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:47.860]  know the testing requirements and you know some of the other projects you know
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:54.100]  might might include you know maybe maybe some of the other Malawi's or you know
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:59.900]  I've kind of got a rough sketch but but we haven't we haven't nailed anything
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.340]  down yet you know I think get back with the team and see what everybody else
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:10.900]  wants to do too and you know maybe go back and look at because I try to try to
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.740]  catalog everything all the all the seeds you know everybody that gave me seeds
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:19.900]  today we traded I'm gonna go and try to catalog and keep keep a list of
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:26.060]  everything and you know you do that long enough and you're gonna have a nice nice
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:31.780]  collection you know I hope I hope everybody starts getting into more of
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:38.140]  their own like pheno hunts and and finding things that do well in your
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:42.580]  local situation which you know whatever property that you might have might be
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.100]  even totally different from your neighbors parcel because they're on the
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.860]  other side of the ridge you know or or maybe maybe the people down the road or
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.700]  you know a little closer to a valley and they get more wind or you know so so
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:04.740]  it's a it's great to be here and see you know all the different success stories
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.380]  from different strains because that definitely has a big effect on my
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:12.780]  personal you know decisions of what I'm gonna go and breed with is when I go and
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:16.620]  talk to the community or I go to you know the Emerald Cup or you know you
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.260]  know see somebody out you know you know in town or something and they've been so
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:26.020]  oh well you know you're you're you know sour orange or you know your granddaddy
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:30.260]  orange or you know maybe one of these you know dream queen glue or this or
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.020]  that like did really well for me and that's I love I love hearing everybody's
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.660]  stories of what they've done with my genetics and what they really liked just
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:45.500]  like you know I've got folks that rave about these two guys genetics that that
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:53.340]  tried in previous years so you know just yeah keep the stories coming so awesome
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:06:01.220]  and you know what I like is that it's rare that most most people in nowadays
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.580]  what I learned the internet is where you talk shit so you can get recognition
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.860]  because otherwise you don't exist and unless you're flapping your mouth
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:13.260]  throwing rocks at someone else you're not even real person and we're sitting
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.340]  there hanging out and you're talking about your experiences with jeans work
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:21.380]  back in the day and and that's work with your boys stuff and you know it's just
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:33.010]  it's just cool appreciate it thank you all right I know you guys got questions
[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:36.610]  and so we got some basic info that I wanted to talk about out if they want to
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:41.170]  cover some stuff themselves if they have something they want to throw they
[01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:44.490]  welcome but otherwise man let's let's get the audience to ask some questions
[01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:47.290]  because it's rare it's rare you get these guys on a table at the same time
[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:51.290]  so boom
[01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:58.650]  did you hear him well he said he said what traits do you look for specifically
[01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:06.850]  in male plants if you're seeking a good breeder well I'm a big fan of the the
[01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:16.450]  stem rub and I really love turpins and the all the different possibilities that
[01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:26.610]  there are in the cannabis species so that's something that has done me serve
[01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:35.930]  me well for ever and I'll probably never put down that tool you know no matter
[01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:44.290]  what and then you know we did some some testing of males this year that's kind
[01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:51.330]  of a cool trick but yeah and then I you know certainly structure and if you're
[01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:56.090]  trying to breed for homozygosity or uniformity then you want to look for one
[01:07:56.090 --> 01:08:01.450]  that has a similar structure to you know if you're trying to make an inbred line
[01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:07.850]  for example or something like that so Jean you want to do some of that yeah
[01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:14.090]  that's actually just touching the plant and and and seeing really what the
[01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:22.250]  smells you get from the stem different ones are different so like OG and
[01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.970]  everybody's nose works different but like me I can pick an OG male hella easy
[01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:30.170]  because it smells like dill pickles to me and if it smells like dill pickles
[01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:35.290]  that one has it and it doesn't mean that it'll necessarily carry it depending
[01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:40.330]  on what you're pulling it from so if you already have seeds where you know that
[01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:45.890]  all the females do smell like OG and then you get a male out of there that
[01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:51.050]  you know like if I was gonna be breeding something with OG for example I'd be
[01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:55.050]  like okay what does it need improvement on so you want a little bit of an
[01:08:55.050 --> 01:09:00.090]  improved structure so it's a little more sturdy you want improved resistance to
[01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:05.130]  powdery mildew so if I was breeding OGs I'd probably want to like stick them in
[01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:08.970]  a room and get them really humid for a little while maybe let them droop a
[01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.490]  couple times before they're really flowering heavy so that I can kind of
[01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:17.490]  trigger their stress response so that they'll get attacked on purpose so you
[01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:21.610]  can kind of go okay there's the one that that's resistant because otherwise if
[01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:26.570]  you treat treat them you know if they have perfect conditions and you're
[01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:31.450]  breeding for something that's triggered by bad conditions you're not gonna see
[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:36.610]  it so it doesn't you there's no way to select for that so you have to kind of
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:40.610]  put pressures on things to see different things like if you want to know if a
[01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:43.690]  brand if the branches are strong you're gonna have to snap them you have to be
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:49.010]  like all right weak weak branches you break some you know and then like some
[01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:54.330]  some plants grow with like actually almost sometimes it'll almost look like
[01:09:54.330 --> 01:10:01.490]  a bubble at the at the junction of the branch in the main stock so it'll
[01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:06.010]  actually be like there's these ones where they'll never break right at the
[01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:11.130]  junction they'll actually bend and kind of break over right up from it a little
[01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:16.130]  bit and those ones tend to be a lot more sturdy and they I found those in in most
[01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:20.410]  stuff so it's like you know little things like that are cool to look for
[01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:29.250]  but you know yeah the stem rub is basically if you I really like to if I
[01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:33.490]  can grow something if I have enough seeds if I don't have enough I'll grow
[01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:36.810]  them and I'll just use all the males and all the females and do an open
[01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:40.090]  pollination so I know I have a bunch more and then out of my favorite females
[01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:44.330]  then I'll try some of those and when I do the for when I grow them out the
[01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:49.170]  first time I'll try to figure out which plants you have to observe a lot so you
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:55.810]  look okay these plants I can notice these things about them and then when
[01:10:55.810 --> 01:11:03.530]  they finish as female plants then you kind of see trends so you go okay well
[01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:09.570]  the every female that looked like this or that had the stem rub they wound up
[01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:14.450]  being like this and then you can get a correlation there and then you know okay
[01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:18.730]  so like if you're if you're looking for a good OG male and you go this one
[01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:23.530]  smells like OG it's like it turns out no the really good OG clones to me that
[01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:27.410]  I have they smell like pickles so I want the male that smells like pickles if it
[01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:30.810]  smells like OG when it's done it might not smell like OG so it already smells
[01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:35.730]  like OG on the stem so it's it's kind of like learning the plants and I so I like
[01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:40.050]  to learn them before I try to really do any selective breeding and that makes it
[01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.410]  easier and that's the thing about looking for male traits is there's
[01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:47.850]  overall ones you don't want one that's a pest magnet you don't want one that's a
[01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:53.530]  fungus magnet you don't want one that has really weak snappy structure or you
[01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:57.210]  know if maybe if they're super hard to clone or they have really weak roots
[01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.490]  there's some basic things that you can look for just overall and go it's not
[01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:07.050]  the best plant for these reasons but a lot of times with selecting males you
[01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:10.210]  actually want to find the one that carries what you like about the females
[01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:16.490]  so that takes observation and figuring out where it is and different different
[01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:23.290]  genes basically travel in groups in breeding to where you might try to get
[01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:26.970]  rid of something and discover that every time you get rid of that you get rid of
[01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:31.850]  the other thing you wanted so maybe you go oh I always want maybe somebody's
[01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:36.810]  already made already bred something that you're starting with where you go mmm
[01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:41.730]  the one that I like to smoke I can grow as many as I want and the ones I really
[01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:45.650]  like they always have kind of flimsy branches so you might be stuck with that
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:50.770]  unless you want to make a new hybrid and then incorporate strength and in
[01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:55.610]  your new hybrid you can get new stuff happening you know but it's really for
[01:12:55.610 --> 01:13:00.770]  for male selecting to me is really looking at finding which male is the one
[01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:05.770]  that really does what I want in that type and then using those kind of males
[01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:13.490]  so it really takes like studying the way that is and then you can pick them and
[01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.770]  then of course use your you know use your general things where you go okay
[01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:21.330]  anything crappy we don't want to use that but of the ones that we like you
[01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.890]  know you then you want to figure out what's like the actual it's almost like
[01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:28.890]  seeing a face and recognizing a face or recognizing a voice you're like there's
[01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:32.410]  that plant I know that plant it always does this so you want to find those
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:37.130]  correlations and those groups of traits that all travel together like I someone
[01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:41.250]  was asking me about the pina's that I sold this year they're purple stem and
[01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:46.410]  they're all purple stem and they all have the same smell and the trip was
[01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:52.250]  that the purple stem travels with this particular group of terpenes so that
[01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:56.090]  it's really easy to breed it to have the smell if you just look for the ones with
[01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:59.690]  the purple stems and then you smell the stock there might be a couple of them
[01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:03.910]  that are a little off you go no but this one has the most of that smell and it's
[01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:08.810]  purple stem you put them together and really fast I was able to go okay this
[01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:14.770]  is that so if that wasn't that that those that male might have been the
[01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:18.370]  sturdiest and the stinkiest and the fastest growing but if you hate that
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:22.330]  smell don't pick the purple stem one you got to get a different one so you got to
[01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:28.890]  learn the plants and then when you select your males then you can you can
[01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:34.410]  have you know success a lot easier you can also just go I really like this
[01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:40.730]  plant and use that male because you're likely to get plants that look like it
[01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:43.690]  and that might have been what you like you're like wow this thing has a luster
[01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:47.930]  and a vigor to it and it's like well you're at least gonna get that and then
[01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:51.530]  you can find out later if you get those other traits that are important to you
[01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:55.290]  too you can always try it you know I throw it and see if it sticks but you
[01:14:55.290 --> 01:15:00.810]  want to you want to ideally learn what you're working with first and then like
[01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:05.850]  I was talking about the the weird the weirdos in the cherry limeade like if
[01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:09.730]  you didn't mind having really little weird plants you might be able to make
[01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:13.370]  really cool stuff with that because the weeds always killer the plants not that
[01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:17.490]  good though so what I did is I looked and looked till I got males that had the
[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:22.770]  same smell and the same resinous leaves and everything and then I went okay so
[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:28.210]  this is like that it's more rare in this form but this has the traits I like in
[01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:32.290]  that but this thing grows and it doesn't have weird a weird look to it
[01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:36.570]  that freaks people out so then you know that you wind up going with that but
[01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:40.170]  that's how I select males personally is by learning what it is like you're like
[01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:44.490]  okay what if you were breeding dogs you know you'd be like okay you're not gonna
[01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:48.450]  breed Rottweilers and go I liked this one it didn't have Rottweiler markings
[01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:51.690]  but it's a good Rottweiler and then after a while people be like this ain't
[01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:55.450]  a Rottweiler dude you didn't pick the right one that was a sport it was
[01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:59.290]  different and it wasn't the right thing to use so you want to learn you want to
[01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:02.650]  know what a Rottweiler looks like you want to know how tall is the shoulder
[01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:07.810]  how tall is the hips what's the sway in the back how long is the tail on a puppy
[01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:12.690]  how do the ears lay what are their where do their teeth sit Howard what what are
[01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.650]  the what's the line in the front all that stuff to learn to go okay now I'm
[01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:20.270]  breeding dogs so if you really want to breed stuff you really have to know the
[01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:24.530]  description of what you're shooting for and that's how you pick the males but
[01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:28.770]  that's not to say you might you might have had a killer dog that was like a
[01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:33.890]  Rottweiler that was all black or all tan and you're like I like that one nothing
[01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.490]  wrong with that you're just gonna be going a new place and you have to have
[01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:41.030]  focus for doing that so you can just randomly select a male because you like
[01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:46.930]  it but it's gonna be more difficult to lock down the exact things you want so
[01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:52.250]  you want to learn your genetics to pick them you know
[01:16:54.530 --> 01:17:16.530]  what can we as the community do on a political level to protect the people
[01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:22.810]  who do the breeding you know when Beth was up yesterday it was one of the
[01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:26.610]  better presentations I've seen in a minute because it gave you a protection
[01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:34.370]  toolbox and I think that and I know Jerry Whiting and Jerry's a savvy smart
[01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:38.810]  guy from the tech era and I think he has the like the largest collection of
[01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:43.530]  Black Panther memorabilia because that's what his family was so he has this he
[01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:47.410]  has this concepts of protecting things and preserving culture in a different
[01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:51.610]  way than most people do and because he was successful in tech it also gave him
[01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:56.050]  a different view of how these things operate and I think that the stuff that
[01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:00.210]  we took a look at yesterday was the abilities to be able to get yourself
[01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:04.030]  contractual protection and I think with community protection and support is
[01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:08.070]  really just try not to screw each other you know fundamentally man choose not to
[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:12.990]  burn the guy you're doing business with and that seemed to work for a long time
[01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:17.790]  it's I mean to me it's pretty simple and I think that that you know in my
[01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:22.950]  perspective from someone who traffics genetics what I want to be able to see
[01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:26.590]  is and what I've always done is I've always given credit to the people whose
[01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:33.310]  cultivars I use or material I use or information I use because what happens
[01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:37.750]  then is you promote just like Jason was promoting Nat and Gene saying hey man I
[01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:42.110]  ran your stuff it was killing my friends run your stuff that's a courtesy he
[01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:45.430]  didn't have to say it but he wanted to say hey you know you guys are some are
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:49.670]  some guys that I respect and I appreciate and what it does it adds a
[01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:52.990]  level of legitimacy that you can't add yourself I had this discussion with
[01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:56.870]  someone today about the internet saying the internet guys tell you this is how
[01:18:56.870 --> 01:19:01.910]  you promote yourself and I'm like nobody really gives a shit about them it's it's
[01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:05.790]  just banter it's crap coming out their mouth perpetually and you just turn it
[01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:10.030]  off what you want is you want other people to validate what you're doing in
[01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:13.270]  an honest way because that resonates in a way that you know is true because
[01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:17.390]  they're not getting paid for it they're not a shill and I think that that's part
[01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.710]  of it is that you know you recognize other people's farms and you commend the
[01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:24.350]  product when it's legitimate and if you don't have an ability to move your
[01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:27.470]  product but you know someone who could move product you push that product and
[01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:31.590]  you make sure that person gets credit and with the breeders you know don't
[01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:35.790]  pirate their work you know what what you had a funny one because jeans a meme
[01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:39.830]  King but he was talking about how they would rename in these varietals so they
[01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:42.310]  could just get rid of the breeder and there was this whole meme about how the
[01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:45.630]  breeder was diminished minimized and wiped out so that we can name anything
[01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:50.750]  we wanted but it's it's such a true statement because you're so you're so
[01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:55.030]  desirous of your own success that you forgot how you got there and I think
[01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:59.990]  when it comes to what the breeders that if you can keep them alive in the
[01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:04.790]  conversation all the time in a courteous sense where this is the
[01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:09.110]  material I got from Jason this is what I used if you want to buy more you can go
[01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:12.590]  to him if you got questions you can go to him you become in this incredible
[01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:16.630]  referral network and I think that the thing that protects you from shit in
[01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:22.270]  life most is money your own money makes you pretty safe because you can afford
[01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:26.750]  infrastructure tools connections and that's really what we've been deprived
[01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:31.350]  of right now is liquidity and so we have to kind of pull up our skills until
[01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:35.790]  we can rebuild our liquidity but hopefully this bout of poverty teaches
[01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:39.670]  us how to behave a little more intelligently in a communal form so that
[01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:44.470]  when we do re-rise up again as a craft culture you're able to actually take the
[01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.470]  education that we just got about how you better stick together you're gonna die
[01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:51.830]  and then use it to create the models of protection so that you end up having
[01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:56.190]  individuals that can do the work so that all you have to do is do your work and a
[01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:59.670]  lot of people would rather just grow and farm than have to spend all their
[01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:04.830]  free time breeding too so I mean that's my opinion on it is it's you you you
[01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:09.470]  gotta you got to be honest with whose work you're pirating and make sure you
[01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:18.870]  kick back credit yeah I'd agree with with that Kevin I'm sure you guys have
[01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:23.190]  had it happen I've had it happen where groups get ahold of your work and they
[01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:29.430]  rename it as their own and they don't give credit and I feel like the the
[01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:34.670]  history in the story is a big part of why things are appealing and so I always
[01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:41.510]  try to be as forthcoming and factual with with all the information that that
[01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:48.110]  we put out there about what we're working with and you know there's there's
[01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:50.470]  companies out there that are just getting rid of the names all together
[01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:57.870]  where it's it's it's the all the all the history of you know hundreds of years
[01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.270]  of people carrying this plants just wiped away and now it's this new just a
[01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:07.030]  whole new way of categorizing things and you know I don't know really how I feel
[01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:12.950]  about that I like people being inventive and being unique but I'm also you know
[01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:19.670]  very connected to the history and you know there's something that that might
[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:24.630]  not sit so well about about just totally renaming people's stuff you know
[01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:30.350]  maybe maybe if you come up with the name for a specific pheno like that that
[01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:35.990]  could be okay but but still it's the the whatever pheno of this strain from this
[01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:39.150]  person and still be honest about where it came from you can still name your
[01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:45.630]  phenos and as far as protecting your genetics I think the open cannabis
[01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:52.190]  project or you know somehow doc documenting the genes as open source
[01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:56.470]  that's the only really other alternative to trying to patent your stuff and keep
[01:22:56.470 --> 01:23:00.030]  other people from having it I want other people to grow it but I don't want
[01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:03.830]  people to grow it and then take it from me and say I can't grow it that's crazy
[01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:07.150]  and that's literally something that could be going on right now we've got
[01:23:07.150 --> 01:23:12.190]  you know a number of cannabis patents that have already been issued that are
[01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:16.670]  gonna be problematic in the future I'm sure there's gonna be challenges to them
[01:23:16.670 --> 01:23:21.630]  but I think one of them is any one-to-one that doesn't have mercine in
[01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:25.350]  it is technically under patent right now is that correct there's there's there's
[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:29.190]  some very broad cannabis patents out there right now and I'm sure there's
[01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:33.510]  going to be more down the road and you know documenting your genetics through
[01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:39.710]  through groups like the open cannabis project or are you know a way to to
[01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:43.670]  combat that you know
[01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:52.290]  against the broad-spectrum utility patents the genetic data is totally
[01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:56.550]  important for a lot of reasons but it's harder to translate that information to
[01:23:56.550 --> 01:24:00.830]  the patent office so more chemotype data and getting donations for that will be
[01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:07.330]  really useful to have prior argument for any overly reaching path so anybody that
[01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:16.550]  didn't hear that he was saying chemotype data is as or possibly more important than the,
[01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:24.390]  you know, the genetic testing. So yeah, and that can be hopefully a discussion all unto
[01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:28.890]  its own. I would love to delve deeper into that and how we can protect the community's
[01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:34.390]  work as a whole. One thing I wanted to touch on is, you know, yeah, when you talk about,
[01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:38.490]  you know, you're saying you're going to go try and sell your product. People assume self
[01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:43.810]  interest and so they always take whatever you say with a grain of salt. But if they
[01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:48.970]  overhear it from their friend that says, no, no, his stuff's dope. I like that or I like
[01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:56.450]  this type and you're going to take that, you're going to take that in maybe a little more
[01:24:56.450 --> 01:25:05.730]  deeper or what I'm trying to say is support your community and the other people. If you
[01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:12.490]  see something that you like, you know, let people know and hopefully others are going
[01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:18.250]  to return the favor to you. And that's, I feel, how we build the community together
[01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:28.610]  and help each other survive. So, you know, definitely I think people take it into account
[01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:32.850]  a little more when they hear it, you know, around, you know, through somebody else or
[01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:37.850]  through the grapevine or I heard that this, that's how hype builds is, you know, people
[01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:43.290]  overhear from somewhere else that, oh, that's the one. And yeah, there is something that's,
[01:25:43.290 --> 01:25:50.050]  you know, genuine to that is there's reasons behind why those things got built up. It can't
[01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:56.450]  all just be pure advertising or, you know, there's got to be some, you know, human element
[01:25:56.450 --> 01:26:04.970]  to why something, you know, become successful. And so, yeah, just support your neighbor,
[01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:07.610]  support when they're doing good, let people know it, you know.
[01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:13.770]  And I think that from all of us that came from the era where you didn't rat on people,
[01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:20.330]  which seems to be a foreign thought nowadays, ratting out on people, screwing people over
[01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:24.890]  isn't ratting. And so when he's saying, you know, make sure you support, make sure you
[01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:29.770]  also call out things that you see are wrong because if they're screwing him, they're going
[01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:33.330]  to screw you. And by the time they get to you, there might not be anybody to protect
[01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:37.730]  you. And so a lot of it is if you're seeing unscrupulous stuff, you don't have to get
[01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:41.490]  out and broadcast it on the general world, but you can tell your friends, man, I get
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:48.610]  to ask all the time about, would you do business with this person? And I try not to screw anybody
[01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:53.090]  in a way that would cause problems. But ultimately, if I know that you have a history of piking
[01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:58.930]  people, I always just say the same thing. I would be cautious. And what that means is
[01:26:58.930 --> 01:27:02.490]  that I can't give you a recommendation and that you should do your homework. So I don't
[01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:05.850]  have to go too deep into it, but it just says that I can't vouch for you, but I'm not
[01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:11.770]  going to throw a rock at you. That's throwing a rock at you. And that's important because
[01:27:11.770 --> 01:27:16.530]  someone said, would you work with that distributor? I'd say I would be cautious. And then they
[01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:23.370]  realize that there's some reason because I'm not in a business against them. So therefore,
[01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:28.410]  why am I having trepidation? And it's because I saw something or heard something and I'm
[01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:32.690]  just like, look, you don't need to get screwed either. So you don't have to go and shish
[01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:37.930]  kabob them, but if people are doing good work, make sure you let people know. And if people
[01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:44.370]  are doing stuff that are unethical in a way that's going to really cause problems, they're
[01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:47.810]  not going to hold back against you either. Most people hold back because they're afraid
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:52.410]  of ramification. Back in the day, it was they're afraid they're going to lose all their teeth.
[01:27:52.410 --> 01:27:55.910]  Well now that that's not one of the tools, and I don't really think it should be a tool,
[01:27:55.910 --> 01:28:03.630]  but it was a very effective one. You have to be able to use financial and financial
[01:28:03.630 --> 01:28:07.350]  is to protect each other and make sure that the people that are doing this work aren't
[01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:13.870]  getting beat to death and that they're still around for you to utilize as a resource. And
[01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:18.110]  you have to preserve as many of these resources as possible because without it, you end up
[01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:24.830]  having a shrunken population of partners to do stuff in the future. And for me, like what
[01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:28.910]  I've done my whole career, I've needed the people around me because I only can do so
[01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:33.710]  much myself. And my success was really built off of all these relationships I made with
[01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:40.710]  other people. And over the course of time, we did better than we did worse. So don't
[01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.710]  anybody screw you.
[01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:52.710]  Yes, yes, I believe so. That what you could do is if you did a licensing agreement with
[01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:57.390]  a breeder, you could also bring material that you have and do collaborative projects.
[01:28:57.390 --> 01:29:02.510]  That material would then be able to be jointly promoted. You'd be able to have stock that
[01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:06.430]  was unique to you because all the material from the cross would be held. The two of you
[01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:11.350]  could figure out what was the cultivar you wanted to release into the public as production
[01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:16.190]  material, not as a cultivar unless you're building a nursery. If you're building a nursery,
[01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:19.630]  then you say, hey, Nat, I want to work with you on a project. I would love to take some
[01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:22.910]  of the stuff you're doing, put it with something I'm doing. Let's find a cut. Let's put it
[01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:28.110]  into the market. Let's both be honest. Did the shit work? Yeah, this is a good one. And
[01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:32.150]  then now both of you can do combined breeding and you can do licensing that allows you to
[01:29:32.150 --> 01:29:37.270]  be able to use your respective IP. And then you can then find individuals that you can
[01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:41.750]  license the clone to because one of the problems is overproduction of varietals. And so you
[01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:47.070]  end up out competing the success because you got too much of the same material. And you
[01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.670]  know that I think that's crucial. But I think a lot of us just need more legal help with
[01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:55.110]  that where we need to have more people like Beth come in and attorneys that were like
[01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:58.830]  present was great to have an attorney present yesterday because he could kind of say, listen,
[01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:03.310]  this is how we see this happen. And then you're able to get a better idea because I don't
[01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:07.390]  think any of us or at least 95 percent of us have been involved in patent protection
[01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:12.030]  of genomic material. You know, I mean, I'm someone who mess around with it all the time,
[01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:15.230]  but that's not what I do. I still have lawyers that I work with because I don't have time
[01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:19.550]  to go to law school and I don't want to. It's not my thing, but I need them.
[01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:27.670]  Yeah, I think licensing is cool because really a license is just a contract between you and
[01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:35.710]  your associate and you know, it certainly it's not, you know, as binding as something
[01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:42.950]  like a patent. It's but it it's more voluntary. And I really I do encourage folks to do that
[01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:49.190]  kind of thing. I mean, look at, you know, Gene's pre-roll line. Like, you know, that's
[01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:56.190]  in a way like that's good for everybody because, you know, that pre-roll person might not have
[01:30:57.310 --> 01:31:04.310]  had quite such a namesake or following. And so, you know, it's good for their pre-rolls
[01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:11.310]  and and it's cool for Gene because he gets credit, all that stuff. And just one more
[01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:18.310]  thing. Like I, I keep hearing, you know, everybody, we're all a little scared and
[01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:25.710]  we all like know that these big powers that have deep, deep pockets are coming. And, you
[01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:33.270]  know, you might sort of react to it and do something that you might not otherwise do.
[01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:41.270]  You know, get rid of all your your purple strains or something done like that. But just
[01:31:41.710 --> 01:31:48.710]  remember that like when booze became legal, there wasn't like a Jim Beam or there wasn't
[01:31:54.350 --> 01:32:01.350]  Budweiser or Coors. Those kind of evolved out of, you know, their being a legal entity
[01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:10.270]  or being quick and successes. But then, you know, in the mid 90s, all of a sudden there
[01:32:12.710 --> 01:32:18.470]  was this thing that came out. It was like micro beer. And I never thought in a million
[01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:25.470]  years that there'd still be breweries opening in Humboldt County that are thriving. And
[01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:33.470]  just the same with wine. But it takes a while for that to kind of mature. Like you don't
[01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:41.590]  go into the gas station down over at Piercy or whatever and stick your nose up at the
[01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:49.870]  new micro brews. But you do at the, you know, maybe you do or maybe you don't. But at the
[01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:56.110]  Coors, I like PBR. I don't know. But that stuff hasn't had a chance to really like,
[01:32:56.110 --> 01:33:02.310]  you know, like the PBRs and the Coors and the Budweisers of cannabis. No one knows that
[01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:07.750]  that's who they are yet. And so it's going to take at least probably like another year,
[01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:14.750]  maybe two before that really develops. And then what I'm really confident about is that
[01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:22.750]  the, you know, the regenerative and the small and the real craft actually then starts to
[01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:31.110]  have its, you know, days in the sun, pun intended. And, you know, and I think that's the same
[01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:40.550]  with strains too. I mean, God, remember how freaking long it was just impossible to, you
[01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:45.270]  know, like you just had to grow OG and then you grew a bunch of this really cool, awesome
[01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:52.270]  stuff for your head. And, but you just always, you know, kind of had to grow OG. And I think
[01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:59.590]  that that's going to change too. So, you know, let's just remember that we are pioneers.
[01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:07.230]  And like, I think, you know, what me and Gene said about like, well, I'm not ignoring the
[01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:13.710]  fact that the market's saying one thing, but I'm also not giving up on where my freaking
[01:34:13.710 --> 01:34:17.710]  roots are and where my convictions lie and stuff like that.
[01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:31.230]  All right. We got out. Let's, we're going to wrap this up because we got a little thing
[01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:36.510]  going on and we're burning through some time. So I just want to say thank you so much for
[01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:40.230]  taking the time to ask good questions. And I want to thank you guys for taking the time
[01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:43.270]  out of your lives to show up and answer the questions. And like I said, man, it's been
[01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:47.470]  a pleasure to work with you for as long as I've known all three of you. And my goal is
[01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:51.430]  to all of you get gray like me and we still in the same business.
