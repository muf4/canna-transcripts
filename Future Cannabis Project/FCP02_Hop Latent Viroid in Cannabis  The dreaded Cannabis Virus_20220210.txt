In three two one now you are live now. There you go
We got some they got the they got to hear my three two one live at the same time
Fantastic
Fantastic. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome to hoot to herbs grow and tell our
weekly cannabis cultivation club we are here every
Thursday night at 9 p.m. Eastern 6 p.m. Pacific
I see
London you also you have the older version of it posted the hops with an s when
Johnny did correct me it is hop
Latent the thyroid without a similar. Yeah. Yeah, just just so we can be correct
We don't you know, we're all about the science here. I may not be able to pronounce stuff correctly, but we try to at least
Get the spellings, correct
That's fine. Oh
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. So again, welcome. Welcome. Welcome
Everybody this is hooters grow and tell our weekly cultivation club. We are here third every Thursday night at 6 p.m
Pacific 9 p.m
Eastern Time we are recorded and simulcast on the future cannabis
Project
FCPO2 on YouTube so the future cannabis project channel has two channels actually the main channel and then the
FCPO2 channel so you can find
Not only this room live, but all the other rooms we've done as well as a whole bunch of other
Library of materials sitting out there at this point. So really really fantastic
I see people piling in on the YouTube feed here tonight
We've got a great great show
And hopefully some special guests joining us. So I'm looking forward to that as well. Of course, we do have an
Incredible special guest with us tonight
Evian ETA is joining us tonight
She's come into the grow and tells few times before but Evian has been on
plant guided path for over 18 years as a farmer and
An educator she loves to share wisdom of our plant allies
She has extensive experience in the regulated cannabis industry as an assistant director of the award-winning
Eb and flow farm and
Cascade hemp collective genetic nursery and she works as a consultant
I don't know where she finds the time applying regenerative concepts to scaled cultivation
She's a cannabis advocate and board member of the ethical data Alliance on the oaks to Tam
and on the
Oaks to Dam horticulture
Faculty welcome. Welcome. Welcome Evian not to mention the hours and hours of information and content that you supply
Almost daily here on clubhouse as well. So welcome to the grow Intel
Thanks, Jason nice to be here with you guys enjoy chatting with you so
Yeah, yeah excited to get into this topic tonight
we also as always have our good friend Nick from the rooted leaf and
London who is helping hold it down
Keeping the broadcast and production stuff in line as well as helping field those experiences
Going on on the YouTube feed in the chat
For those that are not aware there have not been here before
The grow Intel is a club that I started in Worcester, Massachusetts
About four years ago now and it was a monthly cultivation club where we would get together every month
Smokey truth and
Club where we would get together every month
smoke each other's cannabis sniff each other's jars and talk about what we were growing and how we grew it and
Really built a fantastic community
primarily based out of the summit lounge in Worcester, Massachusetts
It was great getting all of the local growers together so that we could just share and talk
you know, and of course a
Different viroid not the one we're going to be talking about tonight kind of killed everything
so we shut down and we stopped doing the grow and tells for a while, but
We are back and we've been this is now episode
21
So we've been back for several months now Nick has been helping me keep the content
Deep deep deep in the scientific realm. And so I appreciate that
It's good to see all of our friends on here
dr. Christ from
Our future man from New Zealand. We've got drew and Adele and up late cheddar Bob Chris Casey Johnny gravy
Good to see you gravy Johnny. Are you coming up?
Let's get Johnny up here Johnny is also supposed to be joining us this evening
So hopefully he'll be free to join us. There. He is. How you doing tonight Johnny?
Doing really good. It was
Phenomenally nice the last few days like 70 degrees in Eureka, California
So I've been going out exploring some nature stuff just enjoying the sunshine
And enjoying the unseasonably nice and warm sunny weather
Yeah, absolutely. In fact, we it was like 50 degrees here in Cape Cod, Massachusetts today
So I hear you unseasonably warm
Unseasonably warm for the middle of February in
Massachusetts here as well
so welcome fish and Lamar and Dave and Robin and Tyson and Abe and Tyler and big and Marcus and of course
We've got Peter Civelli. Ah
So very we got I get that Ellen there all the time
I don't know why Peter and and and someday I'll get it correct
But we've got March and Hugh and and penny pebbler Rippler's
That's a fun one to say Gibby grow and Lewis marshmallow Laura
Smiley gardens with us all the time cheddar. Bob is doubling up tonight. He's in both. He's
overly chatty
We'll probably try to get him up here with some questions as well before we end things tonight
but I did want to
Get into the content and you know when we were originally talking about this topic
it was in a
different clubhouse room and and
one of the things that's you know, we talked about to really get into this tonight is that
hop latent viroid is a
problem
but
Every time you see a strange leaf curl, it's not hop latent viroid. I
Can't tell you how many messages I have gotten
From pictures of my plant there might be a little bit of a curl to the leaf or us a funky spot
Or something going on and I get the DMS
It's like oh you need to go get checked for hop latent viroid. You need to get checked for this
Oh, you have russet mites
Lots of people love to diagnose
This as well as many other diseases
Just by looking at a picture with it
They don't have a lot of information and I know in most cases people are trying to be helpful
But I think it's really really important that we kind of separate
Some of the fact from the fiction so Evian where would you like to begin the conversation tonight? Oh
That's it's a fun conversation
I did invite a few people that are doing some current research and I'm really hoping that they can come over
They said they might be a little bit late. I
Just maybe I'll start by saying like I'm not a scientist. I'll just put it out there
the reason I've been kind of fascinated with hop latent by right over the past couple years is because I work in
nursery operations and I started to see
Issues within this space and I and I just want to add that
recently
What kind of sparked the conversation?
It's an ongoing conversation obviously
And I think the reason that I care is because I actually care about the larger cannabis community
You know teaching at Oak Stradam and teaching horticulture is we get a lot of questions
Like Jason was saying and I think that it's important to also say recently. I had some
Experts that I won't name names on say that the people that are making a really big deal out of this
thyroid is
People that are trying to sell you something there people trying who are trying to sell you testing
There are people who are trying to sell you, you know, high quality tissue culture clone
plantlets and and also, you know, just I
Don't necessarily buy that and I was very surprised to learn that some larger facilities are just kind of letting it run rampant
and
To me it was kind of like an interesting gateway into the conversation of well
Okay
I really would and I actually asked those people specifically if they would come and speak publicly and they said that they would catch
too much
bad press for bringing it up and I just I'm just curious about some of the back and
Conversations that have been happening around this and I personally don't believe that I have seen issues firsthand
So I am NOT in that team, but I definitely will say there's some conversations out there saying maybe it doesn't really matter
We're making too big of a deal people are trying to sell you stuff
So I think that's part of where we get back to myth-busting and I don't know
I know Nick also has you know, just more of the scientific knowledge
so maybe if Nick feels open to just maybe more discussing and
you know, maybe we could have a little discussion around what the difference is between the byroids and you know other plant viruses and
You know kind of how we got here maybe the historical history. I know a little bit about the history
So I thought that would be a fun place to start kind of the history how we got here. Yeah
Yeah, I would love next perceptions and your perceptions to Jason just on how we got where we're at
Yes
Yeah, absolutely. So let me just give a little bit of a definition of it because I don't think it's been well-defined either
I think a lot of people just talk about it, but they don't necessarily know what it is, right?
So and I'm reading from the medicinal genomics page
Okay, so hoplate and viroid is a single stranded
circular infectious RNA that is completely dependent on its host plants metabolism for
replication as
the name suggests
HLVD occurs worldwide in hops, but it can also affect hops relative cannabis
HLVD won't kill the plant or even cause obvious symptoms of infection ie
curling or yellowing leaves
However plants will show sub subtle symptoms that are often referred to as dudding
during the vegetative stage
HLVD infected plants grow shorter with smaller leaves and tighter node spacing
flowering plants infected with HLVD have smaller looser buds with much fewer trichomes
one client estimated that cannabis plants infected with
HLVD had half the cannabinoid content of healthy plants and the overall yield was reduced by 30%
HLVD is most commonly spread via infected tools and equipment
Which is why cultivators should always sterilize their equipment before starting work on a new plant
HLVD can spread through cloning when cuttings are taken from an infected mother and
Because the symptoms of HLVD are not always obvious in the vegetative stage
It can be hard to identify
Infected mother plants. This is especially true when the infection occurs later in the plants development since stunted growth will not be
And although HLVD can be eliminated from a cannabis or hemp plant via tissue culture
Medicinal genomics it is long and laborious process
It should only be reserved for cultivars that are critical to your business as with most plant pathogens
Prevention is key good sanitation practices will go a long way in preventing the spread of HLVD and all other plant
Pathogens use fresh gloves each time you handle a new plant and sterilize tools often visitors and staff
whole us and staff whole also use foot baths before entering the growing area where
Hairnets beard nets which Nick and I both need
gloves and coveralls
cultivators should also screen mother plants with
QPCR assays to ensure that they are virus free before taking any cuttings cultivators should also screen
Any incoming clones with QPCR?
Assays to make sure they do not introduce infected plants to the growing area. I think in general that's a good practice, right?
Nothing that was mentioned
In this basic introduction are things that you know, regardless of the virus we should we should be doing these things anyway, right?
most of the time when we
Do something infect ourselves bring pests or pathogens. It's because we brought in a clone that we didn't
quarantine
Regardless of how well we knew somebody or how clean that clone looked when we bought it
The reality is you're not going to see a lot of the stuff that might be on it and because this is a latent
Viroid as the article mentioned it delays
Its presentation and sometimes may not show up till later. So Nick, why don't you go ahead and jump on in here?
All right. Well, you know, I'm not an expert in the field necessarily
But what I'll say is that it's a hot topic right now
And it seems like a lot of people are dumping a lot of energy and resources
Into either generating a hype around a perceived problem or maybe on the flip side
You know preventing a problem from becoming bigger than it already is slash potentially can become and I've seen you know
Two plants side by side. It's the same genetics one came from
You know a garden that it ended up, you know catching this
HLV from and as I looked at them flowering side by side and to me it was astonishing how big the difference was
I mean when you mentioned half of the cannabinoids, I was thinking like, you know a third or a quarter
I mean these plants it look put it this way
It looks like you took a whole plant and it was just covered in trichomes
Let's say it was like really nice marvelous purple plant and then for whatever reason you just threw it in a washing machine
And you washed all the trichomes out and then you just put that plant up right again
Like the look that you would get from that plant is exactly what the HLV plants looked like, you know, there was
quite a remarkable difference overall, but
Only at the tail end of the flowering process
so it's kind of you know unfortunate that a farmer might actually get several weeks in the flowering before they kind of
Start to think something's wrong and then two weeks later
You know, they have maybe three weeks to four weeks left and they're kind of like, oh, this isn't good right here
And so it's like at that point. It's a little bit too late to catch it
And so I see why there's like this effort built around trying to get people to be very proactive and preventative about a problem like this
I
also think that maybe
In a larger context. This is maybe a reminder that we kind of need to look more closely at some of these natural relationships
In the soils particularly in this case, you know with certain species of bacteria
Because bacteria do a great job of producing
enzymes that kind of
You know for lack of a better phrase they're like nuclear warfare against viruses
And I think the best example that I can kind of come up with that's relevant right now is that there was a class of compounds
isolated from a soil bacteria that was
Detected in a single soil sample in Japan and to this date. I think it has not been discovered
Anywhere else in the world and this soil microbe is called streptomyces
Avir mctilis and it produces a family of compounds called
avir mectins that were modified to
Eventually become a drug called ivermectin and ivermectin is a remarkably potent antiviral substance that has anti
You know parasitic properties as well. So the kind of backstory to the development of
ivermectin and the realization that soil microorganisms could play a role in disease prevention
Globally speaking was remarkable but on the flip side too. There's a good example, I think with penicillin, which is that
you know if I'm not mistaken the species of penicillin that's
currently used to
Produce penicillin at scale was actually randomly discovered
Growing on a cantaloupe. I think it was like in a grocery store in Chicago or somewhere like that
Some scientist was just kind of walking through the fruit section or something like that
My memory is a little foggy on it
but it was just one of those things where it was like accidentally stumbled across and this kind of like gold fungus that
was growing on the cantaloupe ended up being this species of
penicillin
producing microbe this penicillin species that
That produced it at such a high rate that actually be commercialized
So, you know for me, this is kind of one of those things where it's like, okay, we have the knowledge
that some of these soil microorganisms and fungal
Microorganisms might also be able to help play a role in either the prevention or just you know
The eradication of this virus altogether. So yeah
You want to jump into the fray yeah, I think it's important to differentiate
You know between virus and viroid
I'm not a hundred percent clear on the distinction
But I know the two even though they sound very similar and they do have similarities. They're also very very different and
I
think it's important to distinguish because I'm I'm
I'm pretty sure that viroids are
notoriously more difficult to get rid of as far as just
Using microbials to do it and another thing it too is you know
I I definitely believe that we have some of the tools that can start but seeing this isn't a soil borne
Pathogen and it's mainly spread through a trans
Mechanical transmission
That you know, we definitely have a long way to go even with some of these things to be able to kind of
combat it
You know and as Abby was saying that the nursery is a lot of them just kind of let it run wild
It's very very difficult to see this as it's going on unless you're working with you know, if you have one plant
It's really hard to tell if you have hop late and viroid if you have a thousand and you see five or six
Sitting in a crowd. It's a lot easier to to kind of tell the difference, but it's you know, as it's a latent viroid
It can really you know be tricky with even testing
You know, I've seen plants that were tested and they tested clean from one branch
But the thing is on another branch it can have hop late and viroid
Well one will be clean and test clean and the other one will be dirty and test it. So it's really really tricky
to try to kind of pin down where this is and it's it's you know a kind of a nightmare in a
Commercial setting when you have you're doing tests on thousands of plants and then you have to take into account
that those aren't automatically clean just because they got a negative test and you can have a
Positive test a month down the road even if it's still in quarantine, so yeah, I just figured I'd add that and Nick
I don't know if anybody is familiar with the distinction between virus and viroid, but I'm definitely interested for sure
Yeah, it looks like we had
Hawaiian sustainable
chiming in with an infectious agent of plants similar to a virus but
Consisting of only a short single strand of RNA without the protein coat
And I believe it has something to do with stability to survive on its own without direct transmission
Yeah, and so, you know the host cell basically has to replicate the material
And so if you have cells in the plant that aren't infected there is the possibility
I don't know exactly how this would happen. It certainly does more theater with theoretical right now than is practical
But you know just as one example, there's like bacillus
Species that'll produce an enzyme called
Ribonuclease and that functions, you know to basically regulate RNA and I think they actually can in some cases these ribonuclease
Enzymes tear apart either viruses and I don't know more specifically if that's been determined for viroids or not. So
Yeah, it'd be really interesting to see if there might be some way to
Kind of screen, you know
some metabolically active substances that have been identified for either antiviral properties or something, you know related to that and see if
there might be some kind of
Mechanism that you know can be determined there some kind of molecular mechanism and then deliver to the plant subsequently
So if it's not going to come from sanitation at least then, you know, it's got to be sort of delivered to the plant somehow
so
Well, I will just say too I think that
Matthew Gates who was one of the people I was trying to get
I'm sure you guys are familiar with a sink angel or is that than all and he did just recently a really cool presentation
There's a couple months ago on
On hoplatin thyroid, but also on like the history of
Viroids and viruses and it's pretty nerdy. So I will say if you guys want to check it out
I think it's on YouTube. It's up still and it's he can really go into like incredible detail on the differences and then how they
affect the plant and
It's definitely deep dive
So if you see somebody really if you want to know the history
I don't personally find it
I find it useful as applied to you know horticulture and floriculture and just all the traditional agriculture
markets because we've we can see
Issues that things like viroids or viruses or
You know any pathogen really is gonna come through and I've definitely worked on
larger
consulting jobs in places where things just were very strange, you know, we're having to deal with the
with the local ag groups to try and figure out what exactly is happening and I
do find that's the biggest issue and why this is so important because
Cannabis is becoming, you know, it's the fifth most valuable
Agricultural crop in America right now, which is a little bit, you know, it's crazy to think that it's not even federally legal
But we're mono cropping something that we don't fully understand and I think that the plague of bad
mother rooms and just
you know, I don't want to say bad practices because I know for a long time we really thought we were doing our very best but
Realizing, you know where we're heading with this and how imperative it is that we you know
just stay on top of it understand what we're dealing with is and I think open source of best practices is
Probably the best tactic like sharing information as we're doing
And then also kind of dispelling myths because I know that over the past couple years. There's been a ton of
weird things people are saying
Oh, you could just dip the plants in bleach or you could dip them in xeritol
but that's not actually going to be effective for what you're trying to do and I think that
screening and testing so we can see because there are
issues and I think that
You know, I'm pretty sure I don't remember maybe we could look it up, but I'm pretty sure that
Hoplite and byrode was only discovered in like the 70s in general even in hops
so
You know, it's not that wasn't that long ago in the scheme of things and when you see other issues with other plants like tobacco
I don't know if any of you have ever seen
You know, I've I've grown tomatoes in the past as well
you know large-scale in greenhouses and
That you when you start to see a pathogen come through it can really cause incredible amounts of cross crop loss and damage
And that's what I Mike I
Care from that angle that if we don't kind of steer things toward best practices
That we could end up in a really bad position and I think that for a long time we were trying so hard
I know that for years I have thought we were doing a really particularly good job using alcohol
But it just dries out the byrode. I believe if I remember correctly
Actually kill it and I remember I worked with a different horticulture
group that you know, they run like four million square feet of glass house and they were
very very adamant that when you're doing any sort of propagation at scale that you actually need to be using some sort of
antiviral in addition to
Alcohol and that was the first time I really it really kind of hit home was like, oh, we're actually
Spreading this pathogen and that it's it is human spread and I think that's a big issue because I think that it was
Obviously they discovered that it was in cannabis
I believe if correct me if I'm wrong
But I believe it was 2019 was when it kind of became more public that people had been researching it for a couple years
beforehand to kind of figure out what was going wrong because people were having
super dramatic crop losses even as early as like
2014 I
Remember that there was just there were issues and people were seeing these weird issues in grows
And then I believe like Nick and Johnny both pointed to
It's very very hard to see and vegetative growth
You wouldn't unless you knew what you're looking for
you're not gonna even really know there's a problem and I think Johnny you pointed to also that
It can be a major issue
with
With
The I think it's like the structure
Different things can happen, but you can start to have these
You know just massive crop losses and different pieces
Where you're not really you don't even know you don't know it could be something else. It could be environmental
But until you know what you're looking for and people are screening
Now it's becoming much more commonplace and easy to do that Jason did you want to chime in I can keep talking forever pretty much
Actually, I
Know I had the mic on and I turned it off because I wanted to clear my throat
And I put it back on and no no worries. No worries
I definitely don't want to interrupt you at all in any way, but I you know to add I think you know
My suspicion is it's been around longer than we think it's been around and you know, we've talked about I know there's been a long
discussion in the industry for many years
About dudding right and and again, this is something that presents as dudding
But we've talked about dudding for many many years
No
You can only keep a mother around for this long
Or you can only keep a plant around for this long and if you if you take this many generations off this plant
It's it's no longer gonna be any good anymore. And and I really wonder
How much of that is actually due to this virus being around?
And our industry longer than we suspected it was especially because it's something that we just weren't you know
Really looking for it. And so we'd be like, oh well
Maybe I just kept that mother around too long and I need to go ahead and kick out a fresh crop because this one
I've just had it too long and it's time for a fresh one. And that's why this group of plants isn't doing quite as well
Right, so I I find that really really interesting
that and and I gotta believe that that may be part of the culprit because I
Don't know. I mean, there's something about that
Inconsistency and there's really no
Protect, you know projected, you know age on how long you can keep a mother how many cycles you can go through
Refreshing it before it starts to you know, dud out and
So yeah, that's that's what I see when we're talking about this as you know, when you were mentioning it
Is is just that I really believe this has been around much longer than people believe it has. I
Yes, I that was kind of my feel that's been my feeling because I think we've seen it and I think kind of also what
You're referring to and I do want to point out that you know, there's been this
As far as like myth-busting also, there's like that, you know, I think it's
incorrectly been called in the cannabis space the
genetic drift
But what they've come I believe there was a white paper that came out in just the past few months referring to
the
genetic mosaicism in cannabis and when you do that they have
The white paper basically pointed to the fact that it is accurate we are seeing changes because anecdotally we've seen for a long time
When you keep mothers for a really long time and that there do start to be these subtle
Changes and that the actual term I believe is genetic mosaicism. Maybe Nick
Could and it's like somatic mutations and that's what's happening over time and why you can't necessarily keep mothers
So I think for sure it's somatic mutations
And I'll see if I could pull up the white paper because it's odd
That's also an incredibly interesting conversation and I think part of the issue, but I know that I
Think that where I hear people saying that it's not a big deal
Is it very interesting to me with the hot pop environment not being a big concern?
When I hear people saying that I just really wonder if they've actually seen it themselves
Because I'm I'm hearing Johnny say, you know, I'm I am known I've seen it personally
I've been called to facilities that are having major issues. I have photos where it's
unmistakable and so now when I'm looking at plants that are having issues, I'm
Definitely looking to try and see if there's something more and that there do need
I think that screening really is the best solution and we're really blessed at our facility that we have managed to
keep it out of our facility and I know a few other people that have managed to
Keep it out. And I think a big part of that is we can maybe discuss at the end like best practices
But I think that there is this kind of we have a joke. It's kind of a running joke with a few friends of mine
It's like the my buddy joke. We're just like oh, there's I have a friend my friends place. They literally have a
Section that's like those are the my buddy genetics and they stay over there and I think that's how
To have like with the with the you know, whatever cut is popular that week and
Everybody wants it, you know, so I think we're all guilty of it
But the testing is so frequent and so easy right now
I think that screening your population and finding a good lab to work with and the options for screening and I know what I was
Gonna say before that I think is so important for people to understand is that in traditional agriculture?
Like if you're trying to certify a variety or a cultivar and actually have it
You know be something that you're able to put into production and share with other people in the nursery space. It's like multiple
Tests a year to make sure that that crop is
Or that you know variety or cultivar is actually available
And clean to be shared with other people. So it's not the type of thing like oh you test it once and it's all good
and I think a key reason why
this specific issue with the viroid has spread is because
People will test a plant and like Johnny was pointing to they'll test a
Branch or something and it will come back negative and then later on you test that same thing and it shows up positive
And it does the testing methodology is really important
but also
That it can change over time because it's latent in the plant and I think that that is that something that tested
Negative can test again positive shortly there later
And it can fluctuate and I believe that I'm not sure and maybe Nick knows but I know that there's a
Variety there's I think at least three possibly four different types of testing that you can do for
for
Hoplite and thyroid and PCR being kind of like the most widely available
and then the lamp testing and then the
RPA is another one and I think that there's like a handheld device
I know that some I mean, it's expensive probably like 10 or 15 grand
But if you are doing so much testing in a larger facility, I think it's important to know that you can
You know, you can you can do your own testing if you have a big enough population and it is worth it for you
And then there's another test to Nick
I'm spacing on the other name
Maybe somebody else remembers that the fourth type of testing and it might still be in development as well
Anybody else remember? I don't I don't recall. I wish I was a little bit more familiar with this my focus
I tend to get to you know high on the carbon carbon compounds that the plants produce but
You know, I know people are using qPCR machines
for stuff like this, it's just like a
Quicker more portable handheld version and they can take a you know, a number of different samples and then like you said
If they have the opportunity to do this stuff in-house they can set up
protocols and basically limit the transmission of this because it's a little bit different than getting like an aphid infestation or something like that or
spider mites for instance or fungal
Diseases, you know, it's a mechanical transmission
it sort of is such a smaller microscopic on a microscopic level that it can be very difficult to trace back to
How it even got there in the first place, but again with the right
You know protocols being in place. You can mitigate a lot of these otherwise external stressors. I think part of
There's there's kind of a need in the industry to
Grow as a result of this
I think the fact that it's such a big and widespread widespread problem is kind of a reflection that
The there's room in the industry for a problem to even exist. So yeah
All
Right. I just want to go ahead and take a moment to
Relight the room we are past the half-hour mark and I'd like to try to get a little plug in there every 30 minutes
Or so, but this is hoat to herbs grow and tell this is episode 21
We are here this week talking about the hop latent thyroid
We have guests Evian and Johnny with us and possibly some other folks might be joining us later as the conversation moves on
We are here as we are every Thursday night at 9 p.m
Eastern Time 6 p.m. Pacific
recorded and simulcast on
YouTube on the future cannabis project FC p o2 channel make sure you click on the little green house
here on clubhouse and join the club and follow all the speakers and hit the bell so that you get
Told every you know, you get a little notification every time a rooms kicking up with one of us and if you're on YouTube
Make sure you subscribe and hit the like, you know pump those like buttons. We got 76 people in the room
Tonight just move your finger over to the little bit to the left and hit that like button
if you're in the chat having a good time, make sure you hit that like button that helps us out and
definitely head over to the
www.dagger
Academy for a chance to win some free seeds. I think the folks here on
Clubhouse don't necessarily get to see all the things that are popping up on the screen in YouTube
So just to fill you in, you know, we do have that dagger Academy
going community going on on the web and you can jump in there and join and you know
Win a chance get a chance to win some free seeds who doesn't love free seeds. I know I love free seeds
so let's
Let's get back in
Let's get back into the discussion Johnny. Where were you gonna take the conversation, sir?
So I just wanted to kind of just make comment of you know
Abby and saying that there is some people who just kind of say that you know
It's not a big deal and maybe a few years ago when profit margins were ridiculous and people could you know?
Afford to lose 30% of their crop. It might not seem like a big deal. But you know nowadays
It's like 30% that's pretty much your profits or more. So at this point in time
I don't think anybody is like oh I can I can just afford to lose 30% of my entire crop and then
you know just you know people who
Just to put it in perspective I
would much rather have
every sort of pest that there is known to infect cannabis or to
Go and feed on cannabis as opposed to hoplite viroids
You know as far as I'm concerned
My biggest concern as far as it getting into my space a facility that I'm working in because once it's there
It is so hard to get rid of it and then if you're selling clones
You're risking other people's livelihoods as well as your own your reputation in the industry
And yeah, it's just it's it's a big deal
So yeah, it's surprising me and like Abby and you were saying I don't understand
Maybe these people just haven't really seen what it can do
Which seems like the the most logical thing because if they they did I don't think they would be saying the same thing
I was so surprised because these the level of
you know a the size of facilities that these people are involved with and then be the
You know just their background of you know, knowing about horticulture knowing about other crops knowing about hops knowing, you know
To me it's like when the Department of Agriculture
in states
Puts out bulletin warnings about something you damn well should take it seriously and
I have I think worked in enough different
spaces to see that
You know and been in it just in general. I love plants
It's not just and I've seen you know, I've seen issues with tobacco mosaic virus and I've seen other plant pathogens that
Are way more serious and when they get in your soil
It's you can't run those same crops for three years afterwards
So I think that we need to take plant pathogens
I mean I take pests very seriously too and I a hundred percent agree with you Johnny that for me I feel
Super confident even though there's some things that are like I feel like my nemesis with the pests
I feel confident in my IPM strategies, but I feel like not in addition to IPM strategies
I think that especially and this is also for the homegrower because that's where like the my buddy cuts become like the worst-case scenario
absolutely, I
Think that we have to start taking these things seriously because you know
There's other things in cannabis and we're gonna see more things come down the line because it's like we were talking about earlier
If you're not looking you're not gonna find it. So I I know that I've seen
Phytoplasma
Which is spread by pests in outdoor production in Nevada
Just wreak complete havoc complete crop loss not even like a little bit of crop loss not like oh
They lost a portion of their crop like it completely wiped out. Yeah the whole entire operation
There's there's parts of the yeah
There's parts of the country where you can't grow certain crops because of all of the pests that have happened in the past
Where they had complete collapse
It's a hundred maybe even like another places together
There's like there are so many things on that level
Especially with the past that you see and I think that I think that where the cannabis community maybe needs to be even more cautious
Because right now humans are the vector for hop latent the byroid
We are a hundred percent the ones that are spreading this we are a hundred percent the ones that have spread it when you cut
I forget who and I might not cite the research perfectly
But there's a few different groups and I know that you know, there's there's multiple that have been working on these different things
but
when you take cuts
From one plants if you use the same shears and don't clean them and you just kept working your way
down the row
They found that it would spread between
12 and 30 plants down the row from the first infected plant in a population
All the way through so just to give an idea of how quickly
Something that spreads like that and I know for myself for years because I've done like large-scale
Propagation projects that I've always been very, you know strict about cleanliness and
For a long time I thought was we're doing a great job with alcohol and maybe it does help to reduce the transmission
But I think it definitely doesn't stop it and I will say that there are some best practices and maybe we want to
Circle back to best practices, but I think that it's important for people to understand that it's not just
It's not just like lower tricone production or a little bit of crop loss
the you know, it reduces vigor in the plants and if you see a like a vegetative plant it can also
Change the structure it can create abnormal branching
implants and you see that and it's hard on on here because you can't really show photographs on here, but
Definitely there if you see them next to each other and then also I've seen some strange things in plants
Where in the vegetative cycle where it's just like a weird
I don't know if Johnny or anybody else has seen this but it it's a certain look and I have a couple photos actually
It's just this certain weird
It's not like you were saying Jason. Everybody's freaking out with the curling. It's not quite that it's just the plants
Just don't look quite right. I guess there's more of a thing
But also it's if you if you could see the terpenes
Or see the actual trichomes. I'm sorry when you see the trichomes
That have been infected like you were saying Nick that it looks like they've been through a washing machine
And that's pretty much it is like the plant like the resin glands don't quite form properly on the plants that are
Doing that and and I think over time
You know, I I think the margins are so tight right now
This is something that we should very much take seriously and you know, there are solutions
Think also is a big thing to talk about
So I'm just curious if other people have seen, you know firsthand when you you know
When you put two flowers next to each other what they look like it's very specific
Yeah, you know I haven't personally had the problem that I know of or that I'm aware of so I can't say that I've seen
In comparison and you know, we did you know back to your point?
It's you know IPM and as we were talking about it was we did
Episode 13 we talked about cleaning and we talked all about different types of cleaning and cleaning and things to clean and all that stuff
cleaning practices and etc
it's really really important to have IP EM which is
integrated pest and environment management and
You know coming from the food business myself. I know a lot about
Sterilization and the need to clean and to avoid cross-contamination
Even the way that you store things in a walk-in cooler are supposed to be done appropriately to help prevent
cross-contamination of cooked foods and raw foods and fresh vegetables and meats and things like that
and and so I
completely agree with
Nick's point is that it you know, it highlights that there was a space
in our practices that we need to adjust and
I'm completely with you that I'm concerned
Especially as we continue to grow the amount of propagation. I mean
Oklahoma has like three times the amount of canopy space as California or something like that
and a tenth of the population
We're growing this stuff all over the place. We're bringing in
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who have
Absolutely, no experience with the plant
Growing any plants let alone experience with the cannabis plant
which introduces a whole series of
Potential problems and issues
You know
You only have to look at
The lettuce industry to see what could come out of a really bad
Viroid outbreak with romaine lettuce killing people and being pulled from shelves
Can you imagine what that would do to the cannabis industry right now?
You know, the last thing we need is is somebody actually having an example of cannabis killing somebody
So so we really really need to get our
Practices in order we need to have
Standards that can be followed and we definitely need to
provide solutions that help with
prevention
above and beyond just telling people to
Put on a separate set of gloves every plant and dip their tools in alcohol. I
Thought we were doing so good for so long with our clean practice
I think that also it's like I think basil is another good example Jason because you know
Pulsarium has been such an issue for so long and I think we all know that
experience where you go buy a basil plant at
You know Trader Joe's or the grocery stores and thinking you bring it home and it looks all perfect and gorgeous
And and then within moments, you know
pretty much you like set it on your counter and it starts to brown up the whole entire middle and
you know that was an issue that really played the
Basil industry for a very very long time and you know, it's why they created
You know
Pulsarium resistant varieties and I know I've planted tons of basil in production in previous, you know green
Operations and it's it's a really and it's also a lot of the times propagated
Yeah, it's another one of those things that can be spread in that way. How do we build you on mint?
He totally there's so many examples. And so that's why yeah to me
I'm still scratching my head over and I wish
There's a few people that I really was hoping would join us tonight and nobody that's speaking kind of against it is
Or saying it's too big of a deal
you know, I like Nick you were saying it's like the
This kind of there is this kind of other backlash and it's almost like this
Conspiracy theory energy within the cannabis space, which I've seen take hold multiple times where people are saying
You know, oh the people are just trying to sell you something there's like they're making hype about how bad of an issue it is
because they want to sell you something and
I'm fine with somebody wanting to sell me something that's gonna help keep your with with the margins being so tight
And I know who you know
There are people I very much trust in this space that are trying to really doing work to do more research to make sure
that we're actually
You know, we do have best practices and I really want to commend some of the people out there that are doing
Research to try and figure it out and they're dealing with the viroid in
In spaces in there not in their population per se, but they have it isolated and are working
To you know understand it better understand how it spreads throughout the plants
And and how it spreads so quickly through the population and I know that when I found out
It was something that can just you know be transmitted on
Gloves or that the humans were the vector
That became you know much more serious in my mind that alcohol is not
The thing and I'm you know, kind of one of those people who like I really love the neurotic
No, I love that you added the environment into ICM Jason. I think it's really important
Well, that's that comes from Drew Greco that comes from Drew Greco. I don't want to take credit for that
That was definitely drew who's who who was who was?
Promoting that IP EM as a strategy and I completely agree and have adopted it. But yes. No, I completely agree
It's it's absolutely important and you know, I did want to mention and and you know, mr. Greenfingers is correct
You know, we don't want to scare people for no reason
But we do want to make people aware
That this is a potential problem and that they need to
be
careful
With their practices and as always you should be careful with
Where you get clones and cutting is from
Yes
Sorry Jason
No, go ahead Nick
I'm just gonna say that you know experiences like this across the entire industry kind of shape
Understandings for best practices or even cultivation practices at large
I mean I've seen and heard a lot of people that are
Starting breeding programs now partially because it makes sense from the perspective of a business owner
If you you know breed your own genetics that you don't release outward and then on the flip side you have a predictable
Supply of plants that you can you know more or less guarantee are gonna be clean
There's been breeders that have been around for a very very long time. They've been doing stuff like this
And it's been working pretty well. And then more recently I think
You know some of these
You know as more and more people are dealing with this problem
They're realizing controlling your own supply of genetics is probably the way to go in the future
and I think just to kind of create a little bit of contrast between
Cannabis as an industry and maybe something you'd find in like tomatoes or basil or something like that is you don't have and correct me
If I'm wrong, but you don't necessarily have this the same type of practice going on, you know, you have like
You know breeding programs are typically
You know just a lot more
Controlled I guess I don't know
I'm not very familiar with conventional ag and but the thing that you said about basil when we kind of think about
You know that that type of stuff in particular. So yeah, correct me if I'm wrong
Yeah, that's really those are really good interesting points to you know, I feel like
Yeah, I don't like scaring people I hate the fear tactic and I also want to say that you know when dark heart
Came out initially. I believe it was back in 2019 and spoke out about it. It's like they they took a chance
To say like hey, we're one of the biggest
Cannabis nurseries and we've discovered this thing in our population, you know
and I think that that's like putting putting put themselves out there in a position of
You know just a little bit risky to say hey we discovered this thing in the population
What does that look like?
you know for the community and I and I know that they have continued to do research and there are other groups that have
continued to do research and
there is a and I know that you know, like Segra last year, I believe Mojave Richardson and a few other people and
I'm trying to remember the other doctors name who I know works with Segra and a couple other groups
I'm sure it'll come to me in a second. But
They've been sharing open source mitigation
Practices and they're not just trying to sell you stuff. They're trying to say hey, you know
Yes, they a lot of these groups can sell you something that's gonna help to keep your population clean
because
But they're not always I think that there is like a general like hey, we're all in this together
I know that there has been some back channel nursery conversations among you know
What people might think we're very heavy competitors, but the reality is
That we really are all in this together
And I think of course we all know that tissue culture can be a way to
You know clean things the the jury is still actually out and I have asked multiple experts and I'm pretty much
This is my you know, my one of my main
questions about the viroid is how
Is it actually
moving through
You know how it moves through germplasm if it's moving through the seed population because when you're working with breeding
You know that has been a big question, but nobody has been able to prove yes or no solidly
If it is actually possible to have it
You know come through seed. So I'm you know, I imagine that if you you know
Something from a mother that had a high viral load that it could come through
But I think the jury is still out there
and I also really think that you know, I have my own questions about Nick you saying that like that, you
know, I think a lot of people especially in large-scale production seem to think
It's easy to do things in how like just add another thing to what we do in-house like yeah, we'll breed in-house
And I know that you know, that's
Not necessarily we've you know
We have a very large have had a very large genetic library with up to 120 different cultivars
And it's not cheap to put things in there
There really aren't very many good long-term storage solutions besides
TC and and it's in-house you can make it much more affordable
but
But to have somebody else do it for you, you know if you have a
Cultivar that you really really care about and you want to save
it's gonna cost you about $15,000 generally between 10 and 15 thousand to outsource that and
There is no, you know at this point. Nobody's fully nailed cryo preservation either
There's definitely some cool research that's being done and people putting papers out around that
And my prayer is that we can have long-term storage easy and accessible for breeding programs
but I do think that there are other things to consider there's a lot to consider with
With outsourcing and a lot of the time I think I you know, it's like you don't want to just save something
that is
You know if it's not so if it's something that's not so special or unique to you
Then I don't think it's really necessary to put things into TC somebody else probably already has it and you can probably get it from
Somebody that's already cleaned it up and it takes about a year also if you had something and also
Yeah, there's other people. I would really love to have join the conversation. I keep thinking of
People but there's the other
reality that is very important to remember is that
It is not a perfect science and I have heard mixed things and I'm still I'm not sure
The jury is still also out on
even if TC can a hundred percent clean things and this would be a great question for
For Connor at some point, but you know, if you if you have a plant that has a heavy viral load, you know
How long exactly is it going to take to clean that up?
Is it a hundred percent possible because I know that people have also tried and failed
and it's still some sort of
Level of the viroid is still showing up in the plant even after they have tried to clean it up
So I think starting with clean stock is
Probably, you know the best solution there and I'm very curious to see where it goes because I know I have things that I would
Love I personally don't love doing everything in-house
We've tried to do everything and I think that it's just gotten us into
It's just it spreads too thin, you know, and the margins are so tight. Yeah
I'm not a processor. I we have you know commercial kitchens that are you know in our network and we have things in the network
But then there are certain things. It's like when I needed hops
Hop late and by road testing locally
I asked my very very dear close friend if they could connect with medicinal genomics and just bring in the equipment so
That we could start utilizing the lab
so we have a local resource and we're not having to send things out and they did it because
They're awesome. And and and I don't I don't
Anything like I don't want to deal with it. I know what it takes to have a lab tech and it sucks
Maybe not for just if you're trying to do everything
It's great for somebody that wants to do the lab thing, but I don't I don't want to do that
We've tried and it's a real pain when you're having to run like GC machine like just running all that stuff and having somebody
It's a whole situation
Yeah, we'll say and yeah handheld if there are easier devices
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know even then I think about the same thing with breeding
I'm like sure you're gonna do everything
You know just make sure you have the labor and the ability to actually pull it off and that you're not spreading yourself
Too thin I think that's pretty common in general
many
Many folks who start their own businesses and are independent
people they feel they need to control every aspect and
Over time you learn that you're probably best focusing on what you do best and
Allowing others to help you do the things that they do best
you know
Not to get too far off track, but a lot of folks want to know how to get into the cannabis industry
How can I get in the cannabis industry? How can I get in the cannabis industry?
Just keep doing what you're doing and offer your services to a cannabis business
right
The cannabis businesses need everything under the Sun whether it's barbers or
People who do stone or
Lawyers or tax attorneys or you know, you name it. They need them to printers marketing everything
And so it's important if we want to build a community and we want to normalize the plant
We need to be part of the normal community and and you know
Support the local businesses that you know as well and and hopefully they'll support us, too
so
Yeah, let's
Just since I went off track
I'm gonna go ahead and take the opportunity to relight the room because we are at the hour mark. It's been an hour
We've been in here. We've been an awesome conversation so far. I also wanted to thank
James Chrysler and Hawaii sustainable for dropping the fantastic knowledge on the YouTube feed as well
helping
helping the conversation along
in
Similar conversations and threads to some of the things we've been saying as well. So appreciate
Appreciate the support and appreciate you having us with us with you. Yeah having you with us tonight
Wow
So welcome welcome welcome again to ho terms grow and tell this is episode 21
We are recorded in simulcast on
YouTube fcp o2 channel the future cannabis project every Thursday night at 9 p.m
Eastern and 6 p.m. Pacific
As I mentioned earlier
We have Evian and Johnny joining us this week for the conversation
And as always Nick is with us at London helping keep the show production going
As well as flashing some new pictures and comments on the screen as we go
so
You know, we've talked a bit about
What the
What what we know right because again, it's it's a lot of evolving science
and a lot of work is being put into
You know this
problem we know that it is not a
tremendous catastrophic problem yet
And in general we've talked about a couple of the
things that people should look out for as far as you know loss of growth or loss of
yields or loss of trichome
We've talked a little bit about morphology
I know, you know, it was mentioned on the thread earlier and I think you were mentioning this early, you know as well you get
gets strange growth so instead of the
Stems going up they go out or the side branching instead of going up
They just go straight out or even down in some cases
There's some almost like pointing
The tips almost get like somebody was sanding them down
What are some of the other?
Morphological signs that that you've experienced or aware of that we could look at because you know
To be honest when you google this stuff and look at the images, they're all over the place
Think that for me Jason or anybody here because I feel like yeah, it's like you really got to know what you're looking for
You walked into a space and you didn't know like oh, you know, I'm even looking especially in vegetative
I feel like if you don't really know that you there's a problem
That's why I mean, I don't know. I think at the end of the day like screening, you know
If you care about your population, it's really not that complicated to just to just screen and and there you can make it as affordable
I mean, it's just it's there's no really no excuse at this point
It's like if you if you care about your thing, just just get some simple testing find a lab
You can outsource you can it's so easy
I feel like the the plants that I was thinking it's just like honestly
It's I don't even want to call it
like the
Invegetative I've seen like this weird thing where the leaves are just like a word I'm looking for on it. It just looks
Wrong it just looks bad. It's like a
It's like distorted. It's a distorted. It's not curled. It's not anything
It's just like this smaller distorted kind of brittle rubbery
stem snapping situation
It just looks a little bit bad. And I think that really
And in flower and I now I feel like also I look especially when I go to other facilities
I will admit and I'm curious if Johnny has the same experience or anybody else
because when I go and I look if I see anything weird with a flower in my mind and
I and I know that I've talked to quite a few other
You know just growers or people who are you know, definite plant touching people that it's like every time
There's an issue now there is this like jump to oh my god, is that you know?
What's happening? Because if the bud isn't formed perfectly and there is that kind of dudding look
Definitely, I mean I've seen some canopies that look really
Jacked when you walk in there and you're like what on earth happened in here
I'm gonna see if I could actually pull up a PTR image of
Something that looks very specific
From the facility and I would love to talk about best practices. I'm personally and like you said earlier Jason
I am a huge fan of coming up with solutions
And I really want to honor everybody who's been sharing knowledge
openly about best clean room practices
Because I think that in traditional agriculture
It's a huge thing, you know
like
safety like but like
Footbaths are a thing in large-scale greenhouses either go to college or you go somewhere and in the cannabis space. It's so rare
When people are really doing awesome clean room practices like mats into rooms and just in general
I think because we're not just trying to mitigate the viroid
We're trying to mitigate the spread of pests and other things as well. So I really just want to encourage people
It's like it's not that
Difficult I think it's actually just just you just have to do the thing, you know, and there's a lot of open-source SOPs
I mean, I know that when I've made
certain SOPs
That I've shared them open-source because I want it to become the standard for people and I think
Absolutely, that should be our mentality if you care about the community other people
I mean and there's also people in this space that you know, that's not it's like everybody's competition, but I think
Collaboration is way more fun personally. So I would love I have a whole list of things that I know I've done and other people recommend
For hoplite and byrode, but I would be curious if other people have seen or Johnny if you've seen
You know the structure wise what people are looking for and also in the YouTube chat. It would be
curious if what people's perceptions of
you know
The physical the morphology that you people are seeing because it really it presents differently as my experience in different situations
Yeah, certainly I think that the the presentation it's gonna vary a lot depending on the growth stage that you're in
And in veg, it's so tricky because
You know, there's a few different things that can look really similar
You know plants that have few cerium they kind of have like a stunted small growth with small leaves and and
tight inter nodal spacing and
Just the branching is all like it's hard to describe but it's just
And it's like I said earlier
It's way easier when you have a population that has you know
A bunch of healthy plants that you can clearly see are doing fine
And then you could kind of draw comparison to you know, some odd anomalies
In the crowd that have this kind of yeah, they're they're duds, you know
They look just like they're they're not healthy. They're not vigorous
But that being said it's you know, it's not always a sure thing that they're gonna be showing any symptoms
in flower
You know if it's same deal if you're growing a few plants of the same cultivar and one of your plants is hop blatant
You're gonna really be seeing that by the time the buds start to actually like swell and put on some some mass
That they're just not they don't really ever do it. They don't really ever
Get that and same with a trichome production. They just
They just really it reminds me kind of of how
Cannabis looked like a finished product of hop late and by road reminds me of like weed in like the 90s
Like it's like just lackluster and like I for instance I have this
these these mimosa plants and I think I ran 32 of them in my my personal row and
Most of them were fine, but three or four of them
Yeah, I'm 99% sure at hop late and by road just the weight was, you know
30% is like a generous amount. I would say they probably weighed about half as much as their
their kind of companions their sisters and just the
Terpene profile. Oh
Man, I can't even tell you it was
Mimosas kind of got this nice orangey a little bit of a funk like a sweaty orange or something
Yeah, no, that kind of sourish tinge to the mimosa like champagne II
flavor
Yeah, it's so so this these plants that have hop late and by road
The terpene profile the only thing I can liken it to is like old Chinese food
It was just so gross and like I'd smell it and I'm like, oh and I literally went through all the
Trimming and I like could pick out and it was just like literally just up
appalling like I was like disgusted by it how how it smelled and
I have friends who you know, they had plants that were hop late and they positive and they tried they're like, okay
Well, this looks horrible. It doesn't smell good
I'm gonna try to wash it and make hash with it and they said the hash was absolutely awful
Concentrated the bad and made it
Yeah, they said that they would never do that again and they highly recommended, you know not to do that so
We got some we got some good feedback
Online as well. So I think this might you know include and I love I love Gorski's definition, but I'm gonna start with chronic wonders
Small leaves weird old growth on stems and branches. They breaks and snap easy as you were saying Evian
It's not incredibly hard to notice once you recognize it once it presents itself
I also saw on here
Tricones don't actually start presenting until like week six
And then Gorski's which I loved which was you have a room full of 300 plants and
280 of them looked like they went out the night before and they had fun at the football game and 20 of them were
40 years old that weight that drank way too much
You can't quite tell you're like what exactly is your problem
Most of them look like they got they they partied but there's a bunch of them that look like they're about 40 years old
That we're drinking
And that's really funny. I was trying to find my photo of pretty much just that actually like
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be able to find it
That's really funny
I was trying to find my photo of pretty much just that actually was because it was a friend's facility and I went and checked
It out and I swear my phone sometimes I'm like I got to figure out a way to organize plant pictures
Wade through plant pictures for Dave
Yeah, I think that if anybody also
Jason I don't know if anybody in our audience has had experience
But maybe we want to ask if anybody has and wants to share because I think that's part of it's the data
You and I I think Jason have had this conversation before is you know, I'm a board member of the ethical data alliance
It's part of why I care also. I mean obviously like keep putting work into a nonprofit you care but um, I
Care about the industry as a whole and I feel like I've wanted for a while to kind of compile
all of the data and obviously it's hard to it's hard to do and
There are people, you know doing more research right now
So it's you know, there's still information coming in about this because it's a relatively new situation
Even if it had been in the population
It's you know
The you know, I don't know who knows maybe maybe 2014 maybe earlier like you said Jason maybe the dudding
You know, we've seen issues for a while
And I think that I really I want to commend people to who have kept it out of the population because I know that you
know, I was so suspect on things that had had like maybe a few cultivars that had reduced terpene production and
You know when you are able to screen and see that it's not in your population
It's a huge relief and then you want to keep it that way
So that's where we could maybe also and I'd love to circle back to some solution oriented
If anybody else we have people in the audience, it'll be fun to see what other people say about it
Yep, and and and just to add on to that James on the YouTube feed is you know
I personally tested plants that presented symptoms but came up negative. Not everything is hop latent
I would also mentioned just just to add to the fun
James also mentioned earlier. I wonder if the hop
Stunted virus has jumped over to cannabis yet
If so might explain some of the discrepancies then again, who knows what's jumping over with cannabis now being a commodity crop?
Which is also what you know every on you mentioned it being, you know, the fifth most
You know valuable crop but as we continue to expand canopy
Continue to grow
Continue to get cuts from my buddy
You're gonna see this spreading more and more along
Yeah, and I think those tight margins I think on the production level I think that
you know
we just need to I
Don't know. I mean, I don't know everybody else
But I definitely feel like things are changing and they're changing very quickly in the cannabis space
And I think that it's wise that you know
You know, I've always been a big fan of whatever is that the razor edge, you know
What's the bleeding edge kind of science like what's happening?
With this and and I think my biggest concern is I think that what Nick was kind of pointing out earlier people
people who breathe or people like I don't ever want there to be a moment in time where we're talking about like the
the true original cuts of
You know, I know I have my own personal favorites that are you know
just tried and true and incredible things that I don't ever want there to be a
Moment where the last one standing has an issue, you know
And I think that I have definitely consulted for people in the space that have literally said to my face
It doesn't matter clean practices don't matter. You could literally use rusty shears. This is a quote mind you
you can literally use rusty shears and hit it with a hammer and the plants still gonna root and I'm like
Yeah, don't think that is actually
Like I think that's what we're dealing with. Also. There's some people see me cloning. That's it. Yeah
Somebody took pictures of me cloning again, that's what happens
You could literally like, you know, it could just keep going but I think also the times are changing and I do also want to say that I think that
I this is another kind of jury's still out and back again to what Nick was pointing out with people wanting to do their own
breeding in-house
the pollen actually as a potential for the pollen to be
You know for the virus to be carried in the pollen like we don't fully know what's going on as far as the spread and if
You're breeding and what that looks like. So I
Don't know. I think maybe
Jason if you have some other things, but then I'd love to just kind of carry back to the best practices
No, I think you know overall
It's a lot of the time. I think it's a lot of the time
That
We've been discussing all along is that the industry itself needs to evolve into a true industry and
And this will you know, obviously segue very nicely into the best practices conversation, but
You know and I've said this before you know in as many of my interviews
I've said this before and I've said this before and I've said this before and I've said this before and I've said this before and
And I've said this before you know and is many times where I feel
uncomfortable
with calling certain things medical grade
when
They're not following medical practice, you know clean
practices and
I completely
understand
People wanting to help others and give medicine and help their neighbors and grow for people and all that
but if you're going to be a
Medicinal
cannabis provider
You're gonna call yourself a caregiver
Then you need to ensure that the products you're providing are
safe and
That they're properly tested and that you're using good clean
practices to grow them
Store them package them and all of that contamination can happen anywhere and
when you're dealing with people, especially if they have if they're immune compromised or have sensitivities to molds and
Pathogens. Well, you know, we need to be careful. And so I
Very much believer of us
Formalizing a lot of these practices especially in the cases where people are claiming to be medicinal
So do you want to jump into some of those?
Yeah, I feel like
I
Feel like
Yeah, that's pretty much the story of my life, but that's another that's another story
So
I will say
You know just on
Just first off. Okay
You know, I thought I was doing a really good job and I want to just give
Colin
Palmer some credit who is one of the people that I wanted to have come over and join us tonight because he's been doing some
really cool research and working with medicinal genomics on
You know just because we're still learning obviously so nobody's really got this figured out and I have a couple things also
There's some stuff coming up that I want to make sure to point people out who want to learn more and go deeper
But I will say just as far as like in-house propagation and some just best practices that I know
Really make a big difference just in general. So and this goes across the board also beyond just the viroid
I will say that some of these things also apply to pests and I think that's another
I just want to point out that another issue that can come down
We're lucky that this viroid is not spread
through
Through pests as a vector because when you know a I don't know with those for those of you that aren't on the West Coast
The aphid issue on the West Coast has become pretty dramatic and aphids can spread other things
they could be a vector and
You know what? Like I said before when you know the Department of Agriculture and States starts issuing warnings
You know, it's something to take very seriously
So I think you know some of these things could also be best practices just in general to make sure that you're not spreading
other problems
and
You know, I think we need to take it seriously because we're monocropping
Something at this point as much as I love polyculture and regenerative agriculture
I just think that we need to also get real about the fact that even if you're Shaunti
best organic regenerative practices
You're still monocropping if you're doing something for production at the end of the day. So
Yeah, you know you can sugarcoat it all you want, but that's not the case
Sugarcoat it all you want, but that's the that's the truth
So, you know, I think that it's like that
Some people don't like this. Also some people really don't like sterility
And I think that it's kind of getting becoming cool with sterility and I think that Colin
Pointed it out. We had thought previously for years that alcohol was good enough. It's not
Bleach and Virkon S are both things that you can use to clean your shears
and
What was originally recommended and I believe this was like in the past couple years. There was a recommendation that
You have maybe three sets of shears per plant or per you know per employee
Who's doing propagation and that you rotate them through while you're doing your cloning and that you know
Those things are corrosive both work on us and bleach are highly corrosive and you don't necessarily
Have to keep them in there for that long
It doesn't have to be sitting there while you rotate through but making sure that you're changing and using
a different set of
shears like
Shears like onto the next plant where that they're sterilized in between and there's other
Sterilization equipment also and this is something that I don't really see
You know there if you have a big enough operation and you actually want to buy
equipment to sterilize
um
you know
all your operational tools
I see this
Truck driving with this gigantic autoclave on the back of the unit
Yeah, I know I mean shared
Shared resources I think because I also have a big you know, I love like agriculture and i'm always I think co-op stuff is great
But what colin pointed out was that one of the things being recommended now is if you have a certain amount of other plants
That you just assign a pair of shears doesn't mean you don't have to sterilize them obviously because we pointed out earlier that
The byrode can be in one part of the plant and not another so it's just best to just keep your
um, keep your scissors and shears
clean
Regularly, um, and and so also not not everything out there that's being recommended has fully been tested
To make sure that it's having the results that you need
um
I'm trying to remember the other products. Um, because i'm not nobody's 100 sure with sanitate
i'm, not 100 sure with sanitate five or
I believe byzan and there's a couple other
Things but I know for me that
I know that burkon s has worked and I also know that bleach has worked. So those are the things that I feel
Confident with at this point and I would be curious at this point
Maybe we could stop and if anybody else has specific products that have actually worked for them
um, I know that like think byzan takes longer and that doesn't really appeal to me, but um
I would just be curious. I think assigning shears is a great tactic. Um,
Personally from this point on I love that especially I mean if you got mother plants, I mean, what's a what's a pair of shears?
That's cheap
Yeah, it's a good insurance policy, um as far as products go, um,
We used to use this product called burkon
um burkon is i'm pretty sure used in
Uh medical settings is a anti-viral
agent
um it
I think it has been shown for for its efficacy against kind of stopping hoplate and viroid, but it's still like a
I think like 15 to 20 minutes is the recommended time to really be efficient. So you're really like
You know, that's a pretty
significant, um time to kind of just sit in that that solution
um
So that's something to be mindful
It's not just this quick one dip and you're done and all i'm sure some of the the viral
Viral load might be taken off but for it to really be 100 effective they recommend like a 15 to 20 minute soak
Um, so yeah, just be mindful even if you're trying to be careful
um, you could still inadvertently kind of spread this around and
I recently came across the post somewhere
That was saying 10 bleach
Is effective
however, it's not um
There's something else there's something else not ag approved is really the thing is like if you really get down to it
even though people still I know a lot of universities still use bleach for cleaning and
in the greenhouse space, so
It's not ag approved. I think is the issue with bleach and it's nasty. Also. I'm not a fan
But a vircon s is if people are looking we know for sure is is a thing that works
Yeah, have you uh, but you know vircon's nasty too
It's totally corrosive it will corrode your stuff the the fives and takes longer and I think that that is
You know, I think the issue is sometimes you know, any of this stuff is gross corrosive
And so I think that it's like really timing correctly
And I think that with bleach they do say it's like, you know between 30 seconds to two minutes
But the longer that you can take things out and set them down also if it's too long between
Cuttings on a plant if you don't want to assign shears
Sorry, johnny, I didn't mean to cut you off
No, that is fine. And I just for everybody who's you know going to be handling these types of product
um
Vircon s is super nasty. I just remember opening up the containers with it
And i'd be wearing them, you know, it's during covid i'm wearing a n95
And I could still smell this stuff. It's kind of got like an orange odor
And you know, it's nasty and not wearing a mask
You know, it's you totally inhaling that stuff as it's just such a fine powder that kind of tends to go everywhere
So just be mindful, um and take care of yourself, you know wear gloves
um
Wear a mask when you're handling this stuff
You don't want to be breathing that stuff in people
And it's easy to do and just be like, oh whatever and just be in a hurry, but it's not worth
Saving that, you know, five ten seconds isn't worth your your health
Um by any means so yeah, just please everybody be mindful that you're touching chemicals that you shouldn't be
Touching with your bare skin and you shouldn't definitely be breathing this stuff in and tasting it when you're when you're going to kind of
mix a
solution up
Nick you had uh some recommendation
Yeah, yeah, you know, I think more and more people have started to turn to uv lights, you know uva and uvb
um
You know that that seems to uh denature
when you break down the
Pretty quickly and so these viruses and viroids don't really stand a chance more or less and so people are getting smart about creating cabinets that
You know, they have these magnetic drippers so that when you close the cabin or you close the door all the way
they'll let uv light turns on and it just
You know sterilizes everything that's in there. Um, the other thing too is a liquid
chlorine dioxide type of product the very electronegative type of product it's like
um, I don't know what the
I figured off the time I had it's something like two and a half times more electronegative than
ozone and so it does a really good job of
Uh denaturing these compounds on contact. So from my understanding it can kill
viruses and viroids on contact however liquid chlorine dioxide is also
Kind of one of these substances that when you open it up, it starts to like fog and off gas right away
And if you catch whiff
Uh, it's pretty strong stuff
So you have to be careful definitely like johnny was saying when you're handling these substances keep in mind that
You're trying to clean your garden of things that are very hard to clean
You know, they're very small. They're very microscopic. And so the compounds that you're introducing into your lungs
Are also very small they're microscopic and and so that mechanism of action you want to be very careful of make sure you don't
A little bit can cause a very large amount of damage and it may take five to ten years to fully manifest
So definitely take this stuff seriously because it's not like this acute, you know toxicity
You're not just gonna get a headache and then it's gonna go away. It's like stuff that takes years to
Potentially manifest and express itself
So yeah cleanliness take very seriously, but then also your own safety and your own health take seriously
uv lights definitely look at and then also
Chlorine dioxide is something that I don't know if either one of you
Um johnny or evian have experience with that, but it'd be great to hear your feedback on either one of those two
I'm a huge fan of the like you had mentioned ozonation. So I think in between um rounds, I think that
That has really worked incredible and it's kind of what I was meaning if people want to like
Put money towards there's lots of other things that you can do. So I think the uv is great
I think that's a great solution and I think also it's important to remember that we're talking about
Tools right now not the actual plant because there were some very weird recommendations going around
And nobody is saying to um
You know that actually like dipping your plant is going to um
Do anything for you?
Um, I also want to say because I think nick and johnny pointed this out
I think that any time that you're using any products like this
Really looking at the sds sheets and like your safety data sheets
You need to you know and a if you're in a facility
You need to also have those things printed out and at your facility
So just making sure that you know, that's a part of the best practices when you're using these things
And I think also it's very important to remember that
You know cleaning the surfaces and areas just in general should be part of your best practices
And there's a ton of incredible products for doing that
Um, i'm a big
I'm a big fan of biosafe systems personally. I I feel like they just have a really awesome. Um
Product selection not everything works for um hplvd
But like I will say that they have some really
great products and um, it's definitely
Become a natural part of just cleaning your facility and clean room practices
So I would encourage people to you know, kind of look look beyond
Look beyond the norm, but I think that from now on I I personally will be
More in line with either assigning or
storing things correctly and
The other thing on the safety dot I didn't want to forget to say is
Um when you're disposing of these things make sure that you're doing proper disposal
of any of these
The liquids or anything along those lines proper proper
Proper ppe when you're using any of these products is super important. But also
Disposal can be incredibly important and I think it's oftentimes overlooked in the cannabis industry. Um,
And I will say from there. Maybe um, there's other things that you can do because also it's not just when you're
taking um
Cuttings or doing propagation it is when you are um
When you're pruning your plants also and that gloves are uh,
Transmission point. Um, so or as are your bare hands
So if you're not, um, I personally prefer people to touch plants with gloves at this point
Especially because I don't know where people what people do with their hands
but like, you know just using gloves changing your gloves frequently and then cleaning your gloves with um,
With one of those products also or just changing your gloves frequently
There are also glove recycling
Programs for people that are environmentally
Conscious, but I think that's a just a good
One of the things to put on your best practices list and making sure that people are properly washing their hands
and then
moving from there into
The frequent screening I think is a really important part of the conversation. So
um
You know if you have your
Your mother's stock
And that you really care. I think that screening is the next step and earlier we outlined
Some of the different options. I believe that qpcr is really, you know, the most prevalent
of the testing and that
There are a couple other things. I forget the person who came up with the lamp testing
They forgot the person who came up with the lamp testing
And then there's also the handheld device. Maybe I should try and look up the device or if anybody else knows there is
um, I believe it's like a rpa technology, which i'm not even really sure what that stands for
I can I can try to look it up, but I know that those are things
Very accessible very affordable and a lot of people were complaining that the testing is too pricey
And there's techniques you should talk to your lab because sometimes if you have a really large population
You can kind of break it out. And at first you could potentially screen
Um, you know, if you have multiple mothers of a single cultivar you could screen
All of them at once if you're trying to if it really is such so much that you're concerned about cost
You can screen larger blocks and then break it down from there
But you have to make sure you're doing the proper testing methodology, so
If johnny nick or jason have anything to chime in there
That would be a good part. I'm going to try to look up this other device because i'm forgetting what it's called
Yeah, I did want to just mention you've got to be careful with uvb
uh uva
mostly uvb specifically
Uh, that stuff can uh, definitely kill you. Yeah, you should be careful with it. You don't want to be
Looking at it or checking it out or running it over your own skin
uh, it is
Some bad stuff. I think it can even really almost screw with your dna
To a point, uh when you when you use it for long periods of time, so you want to be careful
uh with uvb
Um, or any of these other things as I mentioned, but you know cleaning practices are important
You know something that i've i've pondered and i've still yet to hear really any evidence one way or the other
It's some kind of like high heat autoclave
um, I know most scissors
And in tools using cannabis they have plastic on them and they wouldn't make good candidates for this but
Perhaps you know some kind of all metal
shears or scissors and some really high heat is a way to
Really high heat is a way to uh to combat and fight
Hoplite and viroid and i'm just wondering if if any of you in this room or anybody in the audience has heard of any
Kind of studies or tests being done using autoclaves. Um
For a way to combat hplvd
I will just say that I know that people who are working with autoclaves to also sterilize. Um
Certain types of uh propagation mediums
So I know that that's definitely been a conversation
And looked into for that and that people work because there was other issues
you know in the nursery space you come across all sorts of weird issues and so
You know, there's a lot of other things that can cause problems. So I just won't I won't go down the rabbit hole, but
I think that it's a great
Personally I think it's a great tactic. Um, I think that especially if it's a non-corrosive because
You know, we obviously don't want to be wasteful and if there's a way that we can sterilize things
That would be really helpful. So I am curious as far as tools go
That's kind of where I was thinking things like that could be super useful
Especially if it's something that you're regularly having to clean and a lot of people and I know that for myself, too
um
You know, I think that scalpels have started to play
I like
uh in propagation
Scalpels, um as well. So I will just say that some things are like all metal and easier to sanitize
That's very true using the blade is better than using scissors because you get the pinch
uh, which you're trying to avoid when taking those clones, so
Absolutely, the scalpel would be a better solution although definitely very sharp so you have to be careful
Again, you got to wear protective gear
All right, so, uh, it is uh almost
Uh 11 p.m here on the west coast on the east coast. It's a quarter of at this point
Uh, we blew past the normal, uh checkpoint
uh, but I did want to uh, open up the floor
and allow people, you know, anybody who wants to come up and ask any questions or has a comment or
Anybody else on the youtube feed has anything else that they'd like to?
You know add to the conversation tonight there's a lot of conversations going on around ozone
uh as well
but um, yeah, no, it's been a fantastic conversation tonight. This is
Go to herbs grow and tell we are here every thursday night at our weekly cannabis cultivation club
We are recorded in simulcast on youtube
fcp02 channel future cannabis project and
Yeah, I know it's been an awesome conversation tonight. I really appreciate you joining us. Have you um, uh was there?
Uh while we wait and see if there's any additional questions. Did you uh have a chance to find that thing you were looking for?
Yeah, I did and it's a cool technology
I don't really understand and I don't know if nick would understand better than I do but it looks like it's um
What is this? Uh, let me just see here. It's by idea and they're expensive
I mean that I know because I I mean there are certain things I will say earlier
I said you don't want to do everything in a house, but sometimes it really does make a difference to buy
Your own equipment I know for breeding it's wonderful to have
Some stuff in-house that it just makes a huge difference
So this machine is by idea and it's a rapid isothermal
molecular assay for detection and it's a handheld device
super cool
And I think that sometimes when things cost 10 or 15 grand when you're doing things at a certain scale
It really just makes sense. So, um
You know, obviously not for the home grower, but for certain
For certain for large populations and if it's just something that needs to be a frequent screening is something you care about
Then you know that is not that huge of an investment at some point
Yeah, and it quickly pays for itself too. You know, you think about the cost of individual tests at labs versus the cost of buying whatever testing
Um, you know inputs you we need
Um the sunk cost of the actual equipment may be expensive up front but you're paying like
You know one to two dollars maybe three dollars per analysis by the time you buy the machine and start running it
So it does quickly pay for itself
I'm a big fan of certain things in-house testing
And and just you know that there's a business
You want to start small invest 15 grand in one of those machines and start go testing go test people
Go help people test at their facilities. They don't want to go ahead and invest the machine. You can be the test guy
Uh, go grab one of those handheld puppies and go drive around to the facilities
And go testing it's totally I wanted to say too. I didn't get a chance to look back at the youtube thread
But I just I have become
over the past few years because you know
I do find I think clean room practices are so important that ozonation has actually become
Something for me that I feel like makes an incredible difference
um
in all sorts of different spaces with agriculture and I really like it and um,
you know, I
won't go too deep down the rabbit hole, but I will say that I think it makes a difference and
I want to encourage people to just look for you know
Look for what works with best practices and then I also just want to make sure that as far as solutions go
I do think that starting with uh
A clean
Clean mother stock is is half of the battle. So if you have healthy clean moms
and you're able to keep that and there is a lot of different great options and I think that
TC is an incredible solution
and um
just in general for
You know if you really care about your genetics and you want to work with a partner
That finding a partner that does TC or even if you do want to figure out how to do it on your own
I don't think it's rocket science
um
but
You know, we're getting to that point, especially for larger scale production
that finding a good partner, um
With TC is a is a great way to kind of ensure that you you know, you need moms you're going to order what you need
um
From your TC partner and it's not
so there are certain areas where it's harder to do california has great options canada has great options, but
You know people are spreading out the reach and it's coming more frequent and more accessible
but I will say that I think that
ultimately best practices
That is definitely something that needs to be looked at as well. Um is
you know
keeping
keeping your um
Keeping your genetics safe, uh and making sure that you have them accessible in a clean form
So we do have a question from the youtube feed
Justin asked does anyone know if there is a cheaper on-site test kit for hemp latent hop latent violent
Viroid, I know there are others available for other viruses
You know the kind where you smash the leaf in a bag with a chemical and let it sit
And then it shows a color of positive or negative
I think I mean, I think he's referring i'm not sure i'm trying to like read that also
But I think he's referring to like the qpcr. I mean there are definitely I think you can partner
Like I know that medicinal genomics does um, you know
It'll send you what you need to do in-house testing and um, they really offer some cool
cool stuff that's pretty much the only I know that there's somebody else and
I i'm I don't want to misspeak but there is another testing thing that I think kind of just newish
um, I don't know if it's going to be much more affordable, but
I don't fully know that much about it. And I couldn't read it's not even a researchable thing because it's not on there
Currently, but there is also a cool. Um, jason. I would just want to say that um
I don't know if I sent it to you
but I think the
segra last year did a really cool, um
Mojave richardson and segra did something and then I believe it's sometime in the next couple weeks
Uh, they're gonna do they have a panel of doctors
and they're gonna be speaking about um, hop
latent thyroid and
Hopefully they'll have some new research or something. I'm not sure if they're speaking about best practices
or or what but they're gonna have a very um,
A big brain panel having a discussion
Always love listening to the big the big brain panels
Um, and usually i'm listening to them. I am not on them. All right, so, uh, yeah. No, that's great
Hopefully that answered your question
um
And uh, justin and i'm sure there'll be more soon. Um, and
Uh hillbilly herbs cracking me up with the sham wow stuff, uh, does anybody remember the sham wow?
um
But wait, there's more
uh, yeah, no, I love uh, the the uh
It was a a strange offshoot of a conversation around shampoo, so
We're not going to get too far into that
Uh, but I do really really appreciate uh you joining us tonight, uh, both evian and johnny. Uh,
Johnny did you have any uh additional words that you wanted to wrap up with?
Oh
Yeah, I mean, I think I pretty much
Said what I felt like I wanted to let the people know just to be mindful take it serious
um, you know as I said as a cultivator in a large scale and a small scale, there's nothing that I
Would want any less in my garden, um, I would take russet mites broad mites root aphids anything, um
over
over having a hoplite and viroid get into my facility into my genetics as someone who has
um some cultivars that I really, you know want to keep around for a long time the thought of bringing in another plant and they
Inadvertently infecting them with hoplite and viroid sometimes keeps me up at night
um
You know spend the extra money on some extra pairs of scissors for for new, uh, you know your buddy's plants or whatever
um and and kind of you know, be mindful, you know be mindful and and
and just be be aware and just be observant of your plants and
And you know if you notice like hey
I even if you don't get a confirmed test like oh this plant did not perform well
It seems like something was off it might be a good idea just to treat it like that plant was infected
Make sure that you have some kind of you know, some kind of way to to sterilize your your equipment. It's super important
Um, it's serious nowadays
I don't know who has um the ability to to kind of just let go of that 30% margin of yield
You know who with prices being what they are
Um across the whole country, you know, that's that's make or break and I don't want to see people
Uh succumbing to to you know failure in the industry because of something like this. So just be mindful
um, be careful when you're touching these these
Chemicals to clean sanitize your material and dealing with uvb and uva lights just be mindful
You know that this stuff is nasty and it can have some long-term and short-term health effects that you do not want to have
Um, so yeah, and thank you everybody. I really appreciate um being up here and really had a great conversation with all of you
Nick sir anything to wrap up with tonight
Yeah, you know for me it's like these are signs of growing pains basically in an industry that's maturing at large so as
We try to figure out what's going on and how to take care of these things
I think it does come down to just best practices until we can fully wrap our minds around this. Um, you know
Honey was saying cleanliness is very very important. I'm glad evian brought it up that aphids
and other
Insects have not really been shown to transmit it at least from my understanding quite yet. So
Uh, this is a very serious problem that I think if we collectively
As cultivators start to take it
Very very seriously, you know, we're the ones that are transmitting it and so if we're very conscious we're aware
You know, we do a good job of keeping things clean
I think it's going to be possible for us to basically like functionally
Eradicate it. It's never going to go away entirely, but we can sure make it
difficult next time possible
On every single step where it can possibly transmit itself
And first the first step is to just become aware of where those individual steps are
And then from there start to form plans
Uh and tell other people about it, you know form
Uh sops and share them with you know friends if it works for you
And you think you can help them out too
I mean
This is the type of stuff that we kind of have to come together collectively as an industry to help
Solve and overcome and kind of get to the next next challenge so to speak. So yeah
Awesome any additional thoughts or sop
Recommendations evian before we wrap this up
Oh, I just wanted to say I I really think that um, you know
I echo all those things that these guys said that it is it's the growing pains of scaling an industry and that
Something I don't think we've brought up is that um
You know, it has been found already like almost worldwide like in any all these different cannabis
Uh
Countries cultivating cannabis. It's it's found all over at this point
So it's not just like an isolated issue and i'm definitely gonna dive more into the conversations with people that are saying
it's not a big deal and to not be concerned because
I just don't I really need to understand that mentality and also I really want to acknowledge that
there's a ton of amazing scientists and researchers and
You know the fact that dark heart did do you know that I really appreciate um, dr. Jeremy warren
listened to him speak on the topic and
He had some really insightful things to say
But something I think maybe I didn't emphasize enough
is that
You know a lot of nurseries and people who offer genetics are not using maristem
tc
You know to make sure that it's coming from clean plant stock
and
A lot of people aren't even screening their populations and they're sharing those plants and a lot of the time people aren't even asking
and so I really want to encourage people to
Before you just take that because the hype cut thing that we're all kind of subject to
This changing flavor of the week or what's trending or what's hot?
It's going to change again next week
honestly, and the market is so fickle and I just want to encourage people to
pause
There's not a rush
Because you can something else is coming. There's so much and like nick said earlier everybody's a breeder now all of a sudden
and
You know, the next thing is coming
And it's okay to ask it should be a question
Have you had that third party certified and that's another thing about the in-house testing machine is it's not going to give you a third party
certification
So a third party certification
And I really want to also commend there's a few nurseries that do this. You can like scan the qr code
You can look at the thing you can see the test. It's clean, you know
So just just don't bother right because if you bring it into your thing and you forget to use good practices
Or your employee doesn't clean their shares and they spread it throughout your population
It you know if it because margins are so tight it could really impact. Um
You know, they could have it could have you could have loss from it
So I would just say for now until we fully understand it use caution and um, and ask the questions
That's it and I really appreciate you jason and and nick and london
Thank you so much for semicasting and and johnny always a pleasure and thanks to everybody over on
Fcp on youtube appreciate the intelligent conversation you guys
Thank you so much for being here I really appreciate you joining us
Uh, it was awesome conversation having you both here
And yeah, no, there's amazing research being done. There's definitely people working on this problem
um
But it's you know again we need to be uh,
And and uh, I I saw I saw it fly through here again james with the with the wise words, right?
Be vigilant not hysteric
right
um, we should be
just
developing
Best practices we should be careful about
What we do we should be thoughtful
In how we do it
These are all
The ways to be successful in whatever you're doing regardless of whether you're growing plants
or whatever your field of expertise may be
So I want to thank everybody for joining us. I really appreciate all those in the room with us tonight who hung on
uh the whole time especially
uh, some of the folks who've been doubling up, uh hanging out in both, uh on the youtube feed and in the

Uh on the clubhouse feed so thank you so much all for joining. We will be back next week
Uh, and next week we're talking
Spectrum
We're going to talk about lights. I've got my friends from science led joining us and we're going to talk about spectrum tuning
And how you can use how you can change your spectrum?
Uh to adjust your grow and use it for crop steering and some of the cool things they're doing with you know
All blue light for the last two weeks of flower as opposed to just red light
Which so many of us are used to doing and some of the great stuff and research that's going on both in science led
and in different areas
around different types of spectrums for growing plants not just in cannabis space, but I saw
A great article the other day as well. So they'll be joining us next week really super excited to talk about lights
and spectrum
And changing spectrums and different types of spectrums for grow versus flower
And all the awesome stuff and information that they have
So that's next week and then the following week. We're going to have
another breeder spotlight and
Nick and my good friend jinx proof is going to join us. So jinx proof is going to be here
um
