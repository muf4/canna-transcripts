[00:01.790 --> 00:10.390]  Good morning, everyone. The sounds of nature you're hearing are coming from the insects
[00:10.390 --> 00:20.230]  in southern Oregon. Today, we all crouch down with these two gentlemen right here, who are
[00:20.230 --> 00:26.030]  coming in live from Oregon. And Brian, take it away.
[00:26.030 --> 00:30.590]  Good morning, Living Soil Nerds. It's another exciting show. We just got back from CannaCon
[00:30.590 --> 00:35.190]  in 2021 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. So I encourage you guys, if you haven't checked that out.
[00:35.190 --> 00:39.030]  Again, our goal is to go out there and try to interview the best and brightest. Again,
[00:39.030 --> 00:43.070]  that's why we have our guests today, Alex and Philip on the show. One of the reasons
[00:43.070 --> 00:47.590]  I wanted to bring, especially Alex on the show is I've admired Alex's work for a really
[00:47.590 --> 00:52.230]  long time now. Alex and I have worked together on a few other projects. I've definitely had
[00:52.230 --> 00:56.070]  him as one of our keynote speakers at our live events when we used to do that kind of
[00:56.070 --> 01:01.950]  thing before COVID. And I just feel like the world needs to learn more about his work.
[01:01.950 --> 01:06.630]  And then the fact that he's working with Philip and Philip sees him as his right-hand man
[01:06.630 --> 01:11.150]  makes a lot of sense to everybody here in Denver, Colorado. Shout out to Alex. Again,
[01:11.150 --> 01:15.790]  I can't say enough about the guy. His wife even made me my first mala, which I am happily
[01:15.790 --> 01:19.990]  wearing today. I was extremely nervous when I first started doing this stuff. When I first
[01:19.990 --> 01:23.750]  started teaching classes, I would literally shake before I went on stage and that kind
[01:23.750 --> 01:28.270]  of thing. And for whatever reason, since Alex's wife gave me this mala, I've been wearing
[01:28.270 --> 01:32.670]  them pretty much ever since. My life has changed dramatically. And again, I just want to give
[01:32.670 --> 01:37.710]  a shout out to Alex because not only am I excited to learn more from you guys today,
[01:37.710 --> 01:42.630]  but I really appreciate you on the back end, man. You've really kind of always been the
[01:42.630 --> 01:46.030]  solid dude that a lot of people appreciate. And we're just excited to learn more from
[01:46.030 --> 01:47.030]  you today.
[01:47.030 --> 01:50.990]  Thank you, Brian. Thank you. I appreciate those words.
[01:50.990 --> 01:54.510]  So for you guys that don't know, let's kind of talk more about what you guys are doing
[01:54.510 --> 02:00.070]  at Lower Left Organics, what your goals are. And then my goal when I talk to you guys before
[02:00.070 --> 02:03.750]  the show, we want to see a garden tour, baby. We want to see what's going on.
[02:03.750 --> 02:06.830]  Let's do it. Let's do it. You take a walk right now?
[02:06.830 --> 02:08.030]  We're going to start with the ventilation.
[02:08.030 --> 02:09.030]  What's that?
[02:09.030 --> 02:10.030]  Right behind you.
[02:10.030 --> 02:11.030]  What's that?
[02:11.030 --> 02:12.030]  Behind you. I'm joking.
[02:12.030 --> 02:13.030]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13.030 --> 02:19.030]  I see the stuff right behind you. Yeah, let's do it.
[02:19.070 --> 02:26.070]  All right. Well, this is our BFD. We got, pulls the air out of the greenhouse.
[02:26.070 --> 02:28.070]  Go ahead, you can let me know.
[02:28.070 --> 02:34.030]  Yeah. So this is how we exchange all the air in here. We got three of these going. They're
[02:34.030 --> 02:38.630]  hooked up to Vosterman fans on the back. And this is how we get our air exchange right
[02:38.630 --> 02:46.150]  here. We got the light trap so we can run our light depth year round. And yeah, this
[02:46.150 --> 02:51.710]  kind of pulls the hot air in, air, hotter out, excuse me, and pull some nice wet moisture
[02:51.710 --> 02:56.670]  from our wet wall and keeps the plants cool, keeps our humidity up and keeps everything
[02:56.670 --> 02:57.670]  happy in here.
[02:57.670 --> 03:09.000]  Sorry, guys. I don't know if you guys are having, I'm having some lag trying to hear
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.280]  you. I didn't know if that was on my side or.
[03:11.280 --> 03:16.960]  I can, I can, you guys, yeah, you guys, you sound great. Do you want to flip the camera
[03:16.960 --> 03:17.960]  and.
[03:17.960 --> 03:18.960]  Yeah, let's do that.
[03:18.960 --> 03:24.160]  No, not that way. Keep it the other way.
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.760]  No, no, no, no, no. He knows, he knows. He is a, there we go. Boom.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.760]  Nice.
[03:29.760 --> 03:35.960]  There we go. All right. So yeah, that's a little easier. Can you hear us now?
[03:35.960 --> 03:36.960]  Yep.
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.760]  Okay. So yeah, this gets our air exchange going, pulls our wet, cool air from our backside
[03:41.760 --> 03:46.040]  of the house all the way through here and keeps the ladies nice and happy when we get
[03:46.040 --> 03:53.390]  this hot Southern Oregon weather out here in summer.
[03:53.390 --> 03:54.630]  That's beautiful work guys.
[03:54.630 --> 03:56.310]  Appreciate it, man.
[03:56.310 --> 04:01.390]  Yeah. I love the depth rig. That's bad-ass, man. You just push it and it will roll out.
[04:01.390 --> 04:08.100]  Yeah, it allows me and Alex to hold it down, just us two.
[04:08.100 --> 04:11.460]  Now what do you guys, let's kind of go into depth more about what you guys are building
[04:11.460 --> 04:15.300]  here. So, you know, not only are you building up your soil systems, but you know, you're
[04:15.300 --> 04:19.740]  putting them in raised beds. For a lot of the newer farmers, this is still kind of like
[04:19.740 --> 04:25.380]  foreign to them. Is there a way that you guys can kind of go down and show more into
[04:25.380 --> 04:29.660]  that soil system and kind of show what's going on and how things become alive and thriving?
[04:29.660 --> 04:34.740]  Yeah, definitely. So our biggest thing is we're trying to keep this soil mimicking nature
[04:34.740 --> 04:40.140]  the best way that we can. So we keep our cover crop growing in here that helps keep our soil
[04:40.140 --> 04:46.300]  nice and stimulated. We shoot in for the fungal activity, the bacterial, all that kind of
[04:46.300 --> 04:55.060]  stuff. We try to keep our, keep the worms going on in here. We get the roly-polies going
[04:55.060 --> 05:00.020]  on in here. We get a little bit of life going on at all times. Kind of keeps our defense
[05:00.020 --> 05:06.340]  system going in our soil. And it also helps to cycle our nutrients in here, keep the plants
[05:06.340 --> 05:12.200]  nice and happy and healthy so we can get that, the exudates flowing and let the plants kind
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.160]  of pick and choose what they want to eat versus us kind of telling them what we think
[05:17.160 --> 05:23.040]  they want to eat, essentially. And just trying to keep everything as close to nature as possible
[05:23.040 --> 05:29.080]  and without reusing or without throwing the soil out after every cycle and just keep reusing
[05:29.080 --> 05:36.120]  everything we can. Just building humus and building homeostasis in here, essentially.
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.160]  So for a lot of those out there, there are critics of this style. I was talking to more
[05:41.160 --> 05:46.320]  of them actually at CannaCon. What happens for you guys if things really turn heavy with
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.760]  the worm castings? Have you personally ever experienced that?
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.880]  We haven't had that issue this far. We add a good amount of aeration and stuff back into
[05:54.880 --> 05:59.440]  our soil every time we replant. So this is the...
[05:59.440 --> 06:02.120]  What are you using for aeration?
[06:02.120 --> 06:08.480]  So we use pumice in our soil mix from our, when we up-pot in here. So we've got a good
[06:08.480 --> 06:12.840]  amount of that. That kind of keeps everything nice and aerated from what we've seen. We
[06:12.840 --> 06:19.080]  haven't had any issues thus far. And we're five cycles in and haven't noticed any issues
[06:19.080 --> 06:21.540]  on our end.
[06:21.540 --> 06:24.240]  Is that irrigation, little sprinklers?
[06:24.240 --> 06:29.960]  Yeah. So we got our micro sprinklers in here and that just helps us kind of keep everything
[06:29.960 --> 06:36.080]  right in the zone that we want. We use the Pulse moisture meter from Blue Lab and it
[06:36.080 --> 06:41.560]  kind of gives us insight into what's going on at the bottom of these beds. Because we
[06:41.560 --> 06:46.160]  can only guess so much about 18 inches down, what's really going on in there.
[06:46.160 --> 06:50.280]  Nice. And so that's a fabric pot with a liner in it?
[06:50.280 --> 06:55.440]  Yeah. So we got the liners from them. This helps keep everything nice and consistent,
[06:55.440 --> 07:00.440]  keeps the dry down pretty consistent. And doesn't, I've heard in the past people that
[07:00.440 --> 07:03.640]  didn't have them, they were having their soil kind of pulled away from the sides and this
[07:03.640 --> 07:09.860]  helps keep that moisture nice and consistent all the way through the bed.
[07:09.860 --> 07:13.340]  Nice. Well done, my guys. Well done.
[07:13.340 --> 07:15.780]  Appreciate it.
[07:15.780 --> 07:20.540]  Can you guys just quickly talk about what you're running right now and kind of when
[07:20.540 --> 07:26.340]  it all went in Ray's beds, how close to finishing you are?
[07:26.340 --> 07:28.340]  As far as like cycle time or?
[07:28.340 --> 07:33.100]  Yeah. Like you're about to finish up your light and then you're going to go in full
[07:33.100 --> 07:41.460]  term. Correct? Correct. What's running right now? About the light depth cycle, it's almost
[07:41.460 --> 07:42.460]  done.
[07:42.460 --> 07:49.060]  Gotcha. So we shoot for, we got lights in here. So we try to pull our depths four times
[07:49.060 --> 07:54.420]  a year and then we do one full term outside. We put in a bunch of hugel beds out there.
[07:54.420 --> 07:58.580]  So we added four this last year and we'll be getting our full terms in the ground by
[07:58.580 --> 08:02.660]  like next week after this heat wave kind of subsides and we get a little bit of irrigation
[08:02.660 --> 08:09.940]  fixed out there. But this is going to be coming down in about 30 to 40 days in here
[08:09.940 --> 08:15.580]  and then we'll replant within a couple of days and be off and running to veg in here.
[08:15.580 --> 08:17.540]  You leave the root balls in place?
[08:17.540 --> 08:18.540]  Yes, sir.
[08:18.540 --> 08:19.540]  Nice. Nice.
[08:19.540 --> 08:23.060]  Yeah. We just kind of let every, we try to disturb the soil as little as possible and
[08:23.060 --> 08:26.980]  let everything kind of just go back to the soil and feed it.
[08:26.980 --> 08:29.380]  You guys play with microscopes?
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.380]  Yes, sir.
[08:30.380 --> 08:35.500]  Yeah. Mainly for pest management. I'm not well versed in looking at teas or anything
[08:35.500 --> 08:39.660]  like that myself. It's something that Alex and I have talked about dabbling on in the
[08:39.660 --> 08:43.420]  near future so we can be just that much more aware of what we're putting back into the
[08:43.420 --> 08:44.420]  soil.
[08:44.420 --> 08:47.820]  Yeah. Anytime you guys want to hit me up, I'll run you through how to use it and how
[08:47.820 --> 08:48.820]  to identify.
[08:48.820 --> 08:52.540]  That'd be great. Yeah. That'd be something. Yeah. Something that would definitely help
[08:52.540 --> 08:57.780]  us kind of make sure we're brewing up the right life in there. That'd be super helpful.
[08:57.940 --> 09:02.900]  Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely, man. Least I can do for you. It only take about an hour, maybe
[09:02.900 --> 09:03.900]  over the weekend.
[09:03.900 --> 09:10.780]  Yeah. Yeah. But to be honest, we've kind of been going rogue with our teas and we haven't
[09:10.780 --> 09:18.740]  really noticed any issues. So we use, kind of use a little, a few of different methodologies
[09:18.740 --> 09:28.780]  from, you know, Langningham. We use methodologies from JDAM and KNF. So we are kind of using
[09:28.780 --> 09:34.300]  a little bit of everything, but really we bubble our teas and we've been sending ferments
[09:34.300 --> 09:41.580]  and haven't really noticed issues concerning microbes because everything seems to balance
[09:41.580 --> 09:48.140]  out in the soil. So we've been blessed that way, I suppose.
[09:48.140 --> 09:53.340]  Well, we run our teas. They're more of like a supplement. We never really fully drench
[09:53.340 --> 09:58.620]  our soil. So that way we feel like we don't give it the opportunity to get those anaerobes
[09:58.620 --> 10:02.060]  in there and kind of start doing their thing. We just do it as like a supplement for the
[10:02.060 --> 10:07.180]  top soil. And then we just run our regular water to keep that saturation up.
[10:07.180 --> 10:10.460]  So do you run your teas through the irrigation or you hand water them?
[10:10.460 --> 10:15.140]  We hand water them. So we've got a barley tea going down today. This will be water.
[10:15.140 --> 10:20.500]  We bubble these for about three hours. So we're going to run this today as we're transitioning
[10:20.500 --> 10:25.980]  later into flower to start bringing the phosphatase, bringing the enzymes into the soil and kind
[10:25.980 --> 10:33.300]  of push into, excuse me, to help with bud onset, boost terpenes and resin and everything.
[10:33.300 --> 10:35.220]  Yep. Nice. Well done.
[10:35.220 --> 10:36.220]  Yes, sir.
[10:36.220 --> 10:37.220]  Beautiful.
[10:37.220 --> 10:44.140]  So I don't remember you mentioned earlier about cultivars you're running now?
[10:44.140 --> 10:46.860]  Oh yeah. So this one here.
[10:46.860 --> 10:51.780]  And can you kind of talk about like how each one grew and?
[10:51.780 --> 10:59.380]  Yeah, definitely. So this year, this is a Motor Breath 15. We're running a good amount
[10:59.380 --> 11:06.180]  of this. This strain seems to be a little stretchy. It grows really well. Nice full
[11:06.180 --> 11:14.980]  plants. The smell is insane. Super gassy, like motor oil, almost really sticky resin,
[11:14.980 --> 11:23.060]  powerful, relaxing smoke to it. We're running this here is called Power Purps and this is
[11:23.060 --> 11:29.220]  Las Vegas Purple to Blue Power. This is a shorter finishing phenol that we found between
[11:29.220 --> 11:33.820]  like 50 and 55 days, depending on the time of the year. And this thing stretches like
[11:33.820 --> 11:38.300]  crazy and just puts out insane amounts of laterals that can almost keep up with the
[11:38.300 --> 11:43.140]  tops. So this thing's definitely something that we're going to be keeping around for
[11:43.140 --> 11:48.820]  a while. And then this one here, we're kind of testing to see what it's going to do in
[11:48.820 --> 11:56.300]  a production stage is called Sherb Town. And this is from my buddy, Marthie. It's a Sunset
[11:56.300 --> 12:03.700]  Sherbert to SFV, OG and Headbanger. And this one stretches real well as well. This smells
[12:03.780 --> 12:12.780]  super complex and yeah, nice heavy smoke to that too. Just puts out big calyxes, really,
[12:12.780 --> 12:20.420]  really minimal leaf material, super easy to trim. And then we've got this Gelato 45 to
[12:20.420 --> 12:28.900]  Sunday Driver, which is from Canerado actually. And this strain is super, super fast finishing.
[12:28.900 --> 12:35.300]  This one finishes in about 47 to 50 days and that one smells almost like cereal milk
[12:35.300 --> 12:40.380]  with that Sunday Driver nose on it. That one says a little more squat, so we're able to
[12:40.380 --> 12:45.220]  stuff these a little more to kind of fill the canopy out. And right now we're kind of
[12:45.220 --> 12:49.180]  playing with numbers wise to get our production up. So some of this stuff will be sticking
[12:49.180 --> 12:55.260]  12 plants per bed, some stuff nine and just kind of trying to maximize every square inch
[12:55.260 --> 13:08.240]  we've got in here. And then we're also running the 09 Animal Cookies. And that one actually
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.820]  ended up vegging pretty quick for us, which we were a little surprised about for it being
[13:12.820 --> 13:18.420]  a cookies plant, but it's doing real well. That's running towards the back of the house
[13:18.420 --> 13:24.380]  here. We've got some, you know, pollinators we keep in here and try to keep the beneficials
[13:24.380 --> 13:29.460]  around so as we get later in the flower, we can pull away from spraying anything and
[13:29.460 --> 13:35.380]  kind of work with who you guys actually interviewed. We work with Mariah actually on our IPM. So
[13:35.380 --> 13:39.140]  when we run into issues or we got something, we got questions on, she's been super, super
[13:39.140 --> 13:45.220]  helpful in identifying pests and issues and helping us kind of remedy situations without
[13:45.220 --> 13:48.420]  having to spray anything too crazy.
[13:48.420 --> 13:54.340]  Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that guys. My something was wrong. It was
[13:55.300 --> 13:59.300]  just straight up into my ear. Mariah doesn't get enough credit. That's why we had her on
[13:59.300 --> 14:04.060]  the show. She is brilliant. The best part about her is she just tells you the answer.
[14:04.060 --> 14:09.780]  There's no fluff. Exactly. Yeah. Just give me the answers. You're the smart one. You
[14:09.780 --> 14:13.540]  know, break it down for us. Here's my problem. I need your help. And she's always been there
[14:13.540 --> 14:18.300]  for us. She always gets back to us, gets everything done real fast. And yeah, same thing. Can't
[14:18.300 --> 14:22.300]  say enough good things about her and the help that she's provided us as well.
[14:22.300 --> 14:26.300]  Was she the one that suggested putting those flowers in the mix for you?
[14:26.300 --> 14:31.620]  We actually were doing that kind of from jump. It's something that we kind of learned philosophy
[14:31.620 --> 14:37.940]  wise when we first started really doing this to try to just keep the beneficials around
[14:37.940 --> 14:44.380]  and kind of stay away from spraying. So we figured what way can we best mimic nature
[14:44.380 --> 14:51.340]  and kind of bring the outside inside without letting things kind of overtake too much.
[14:51.380 --> 14:55.540]  It's always an issue when you have a controlled environment is letting it get out of control.
[14:55.540 --> 15:00.620]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, we've got farms all around us, too. So we've got a bunch of cannabis
[15:00.620 --> 15:06.300]  farms out here, a bunch of hemp farms. So our IPM kind of changes with the seasons.
[15:06.300 --> 15:11.020]  And it's something that we're kind of continuously developing and always playing with, always
[15:11.020 --> 15:17.340]  open to new ideas. And yeah, just kind of continually changing our games, trying to
[15:17.340 --> 15:20.700]  see what works best when and what doesn't and just kind of rolling with the punches.
[15:20.700 --> 15:27.500]  So are you guys have a biosecurity plan so that you don't bring shit from outside inside?
[15:27.500 --> 15:34.180]  We have an on-site nursery. So our plan is to basically just keep everything clean from
[15:34.180 --> 15:41.020]  jump and we microscope everything. And then we just kind of stay on a strict IPM regimen where
[15:41.260 --> 15:47.100]  we're running something almost every day of the week. And that seems to be for us the
[15:47.100 --> 15:52.420]  best way we've found to kind of keep things thriving. And then as our soils matured, we've
[15:52.420 --> 15:59.420]  noticed drastic reduction in pest pressure and just health has increased tenfold, like
[15:59.740 --> 16:06.740]  cycle to cycle at this point. And yeah, it's kind of something that we're still in not
[16:07.740 --> 16:12.260]  total developmental stages, but we're kind of dialing that in more as we go through.
[16:12.260 --> 16:16.700]  Well, I hope the audience is listening to that because it's true. And the more I say
[16:16.700 --> 16:23.700]  it, I just wish people more people would listen how the soil health is critical to plant health.
[16:23.900 --> 16:28.740]  It is. With something that we've noticed, the more mature it gets, the happier and healthier
[16:28.740 --> 16:34.060]  the plants are and the less likely the bugs are to kind of come after them.
[16:34.100 --> 16:38.300]  Now, when Mariah mentioned, you know, using some beneficials and that kind of thing, what
[16:38.300 --> 16:41.900]  are the ones that you guys I know every environment is different, but for your environment, what
[16:41.900 --> 16:46.740]  seems to be the real ROI, the beneficials that are getting it done where you don't necessarily
[16:46.740 --> 16:49.780]  have to continue to buy them heavy?
[16:49.780 --> 16:54.940]  So our thing was, I'm sure you guys have heard, but rested mites are fairly prominent in Southern
[16:54.940 --> 17:00.740]  Oregon as well as cannabis aphid. Those are kind of all over the place, kind of year round,
[17:00.740 --> 17:04.820]  given the amount of farms that are out here and the stuff going on. So what we've been
[17:04.820 --> 17:10.100]  implementing is like the aphidius colmani, those kind of parasitized the cannabis aphid.
[17:10.100 --> 17:15.700]  That's been a huge one in keeping our numbers down. We also use californicus to go for the
[17:15.700 --> 17:22.700]  rest of it as well as andersoni for spider mites. We use some, I can't think of the word
[17:23.020 --> 17:28.540]  right now. Oh, aureus, I think it's aureus insidious that go after thrips. So those guys
[17:28.540 --> 17:33.140]  will chase down the thrips for us. If we can get high enough humidity, we'll run the
[17:33.140 --> 17:36.940]  swarski, but as we get into later flower, they don't really like that lower humidity.
[17:36.940 --> 17:43.940]  So we can't run them. That's usually like more of a veg or early flower beneficial.
[17:44.220 --> 17:49.060]  And then we're huge fans of lacewings. So we'll throw out cards as well as their larvae
[17:49.060 --> 17:53.540]  and that helps us as like a general predator. So those will kind of go after anything.
[17:53.540 --> 17:57.740]  And I want to tell the newer farmers what he just mentioned there, Phillip, about the
[17:57.780 --> 18:01.580]  swarski. A lot of us didn't know that. So we were spending a lot of money even late
[18:01.580 --> 18:05.980]  in flower, just kind of spinning our wheels. So that was a gold nugget there for you guys.
[18:05.980 --> 18:10.660]  Yeah, dude, we learned that the hard way too. When we first started running with beneficials,
[18:10.660 --> 18:16.260]  that was all you got. Here, run swarski, run swarski, run swarski. And then I actually
[18:16.260 --> 18:20.180]  learned, I think it was from Mariah that she was like, well, what's your humidity and your
[18:20.180 --> 18:24.220]  temperature? And I was like, I've never had someone asked me that. And she's like, yeah,
[18:24.220 --> 18:28.300]  you're buying things that are either dying or they're just leaving and they're not doing
[18:28.300 --> 18:33.780]  shit. So that's why Mariah is a G. Yeah, exactly. Because some of those other companies would
[18:33.780 --> 18:37.060]  have you just keep buying. I think you might need more. Exactly. You're just not doing
[18:37.060 --> 18:41.860]  it right. I'm like, you sure about that? So yeah, she's definitely someone that's upped
[18:41.860 --> 18:46.340]  our game tremendously. And she's able to like, if we send her pictures of bugs that we don't
[18:46.340 --> 18:50.740]  know what it is, she's able to get back to me within like usually half a day and be like,
[18:50.740 --> 18:57.060]  it's this, it's good, it's not good. Do this, do that. And yeah, she's been a huge help to
[18:57.060 --> 19:02.580]  keeping our, our crops clean. Now, when I was offline there, I don't know if I heard,
[19:02.580 --> 19:06.940]  have you guys talked about the genetics that you're running through the farm? Yes, we can
[19:06.940 --> 19:11.140]  run through that again, if you'd like real quick. Oh, no, that's all right. I don't want to just
[19:11.140 --> 19:15.700]  with the, you know, is there something that really stands out that maybe the community hasn't heard
[19:15.700 --> 19:19.380]  that you guys are like, wow, you know, Southern Oregon's rocking XYZ cultivar.
[19:20.980 --> 19:25.460]  We do a lot of phenol hunting out here. So most of the stuff that we have on site,
[19:25.460 --> 19:30.500]  like we found ourselves, that's kind of one of the things that we enjoy the most about growing
[19:30.500 --> 19:36.340]  this plant is running through seeds and just kind of finding those diamonds, you know, things that
[19:36.340 --> 19:42.580]  stand out that no one else has got in there and they're stable and trying to keep us separate
[19:42.580 --> 19:46.740]  from what everyone else is running and not staying dependent on other people's nurseries.
[19:46.740 --> 19:52.980]  And it could bring in a lot of issues. Yeah. I mean, that's one of the biggest issues when
[19:52.980 --> 19:56.500]  we were first doing that is, you know, you don't have those solid genetics. So then you're supposed
[19:56.500 --> 20:01.300]  to link up with, you know, the homie. Unfortunately though, sometimes the homie didn't even know that
[20:01.300 --> 20:05.620]  the genetics were wrong. Yeah. We've had that a couple of times. We've been gifted
[20:05.620 --> 20:09.300]  russet mites, root aphids. I love that word gifted. Yeah.
[20:10.260 --> 20:15.140]  It keeps on giving man. But yeah, it definitely has happened to us too. So we,
[20:15.140 --> 20:19.860]  we know how that feels and it's not fun and nobody wants to be the guy pointing the finger. So at the
[20:19.860 --> 20:23.780]  end of the day, we're like, well, let's just eliminate that possibility. And now if something
[20:23.780 --> 20:29.300]  gets through, it's our ass. We can't blame anyone else. So it's helping to keep our game a little
[20:29.300 --> 20:33.860]  tighter. And then it allows us to have, like I said, genetics and stuff, I guess, cuts. You could
[20:33.860 --> 20:38.180]  say that other people aren't, aren't really working with and it's been, been good to us so
[20:38.180 --> 20:45.300]  far. We've got this silk cut is probably like one of my favorite things we're working with. Here's a
[20:46.260 --> 20:49.940]  aphidius right there. I don't know if you can see that if it's focusing for you or not.
[20:52.500 --> 20:55.700]  Yeah. We just love kind of seeing them around, you know, if we don't have pests,
[20:55.700 --> 21:00.820]  they kind of feed on that nectar and that pollen from, from our, our beneficial.
[21:00.820 --> 21:04.660]  Your banker plants. There you go. Thank you. I couldn't think of the word. So we try to keep
[21:04.660 --> 21:11.300]  something flowering for them at all times if possible. And so far we're able to kind of keep
[21:11.300 --> 21:17.780]  things in balance. And the real beauty of this is it's a two man team running all this. Yep. Alex
[21:17.780 --> 21:22.100]  and myself, that's it. And that's what I want a lot of the viewers to learn is like, you know,
[21:22.100 --> 21:26.500]  at the commercial level five years ago or something, this was laughed at when we were talking
[21:26.500 --> 21:32.020]  about this. Exactly. Yeah. We're bringing, we're trying to push the envelope here. And I mean,
[21:32.660 --> 21:38.100]  I've never seen terpene expression and resin expression like we've had from the style of,
[21:38.100 --> 21:44.740]  of how we grow. I mean, and not to say that cause it's our weed, but I mean, it's, I feel it's
[21:44.740 --> 21:52.340]  unmatched and we also have alpaca. So we're able to implement like their manure into our teas,
[21:52.340 --> 21:58.260]  which is like literally black gold. Yeah. That is the secret sauce. It is. It's boosted
[21:58.260 --> 22:04.020]  everything tremendously up to our compost game. I mean, we can use their, their manure straight out.
[22:06.420 --> 22:10.740]  Now I know Alex raises rabbits as well. So for like the small time farmer,
[22:12.980 --> 22:16.260]  you want to use the lion head rabbits and that kind of thing. But the,
[22:16.260 --> 22:19.940]  when you're on the larger commercial facility, alpacas is where it's at.
[22:19.940 --> 22:22.260]  Yeah. You gotta go bigger. If you're going to go bigger.
[22:26.740 --> 22:29.780]  What's the square footage in the greenhouse?
[22:30.980 --> 22:34.500]  It's a 4,800 square feet. So it's a one 32 by 35.
[22:36.020 --> 22:37.700]  And who's the manufacturer?
[22:38.820 --> 22:42.980]  This is from DeClo, I think it's called out of, not how you say they're out of Canada.
[22:44.980 --> 22:48.580]  It seems like a lot of the big industrial type stuff,
[22:48.580 --> 22:50.660]  that's where everybody's getting their stuff is Canada.
[22:51.220 --> 22:54.580]  Yeah. Cause they've been in the game for a long time before it switched to cannabis. So
[22:55.700 --> 22:56.980]  yeah, this house is solid.
[22:59.620 --> 23:01.380]  Yeah. You can run it year round, which is great.
[23:02.020 --> 23:05.300]  Yeah, exactly. And that was the one thing that we wanted to do. We wanted to be able to,
[23:05.300 --> 23:11.300]  to keep these temps up, keep humidity down through winter so we can keep doing our thing year round.
[23:11.300 --> 23:16.420]  A lot of times we do a bigger part of our phenol hunting through winter too. And where we find,
[23:16.660 --> 23:20.500]  if something's excelling with a small amount of light, we've only got 48 lights in here.
[23:20.500 --> 23:25.060]  So if something's banging in winter, pretty sure it's going to show up for us when we got full,
[23:25.060 --> 23:30.340]  full sun going on in here. So it helps us to make choices when, when things don't have optimal,
[23:30.340 --> 23:32.820]  optimal lighting and conditioning, I guess you could say.
[23:34.020 --> 23:37.860]  And the real beauty as you're scanning is I don't really see any deficiencies. And again,
[23:37.860 --> 23:40.340]  this is, it's a two man team here, everyone.
[23:41.540 --> 23:42.740]  That's the plan.
[23:42.740 --> 23:47.060]  That's right. I mean, a lot of people will not do this. I've asked them if we could have a garden
[23:47.060 --> 23:50.260]  tour, you know, and a lot of people don't even want to come on the show because there's little
[23:50.260 --> 23:55.300]  pockets and issues and that kind of stuff with, which is understandable, but that's why I really
[23:55.300 --> 23:59.300]  admire the work that you guys are doing is, you know, two guys in here, rocking it out,
[23:59.300 --> 24:03.380]  putting in the work, obviously. And then the plants show that when you have praying leaves
[24:03.380 --> 24:07.620]  at the large scale that you guys do right now, that's impressive.
[24:08.500 --> 24:13.940]  Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people have mentioned to me like, Oh, you can't go big with soil and
[24:13.940 --> 24:19.540]  reusing it especially. And, and you're just going to run into too many issues and
[24:21.300 --> 24:30.180]  issues. It's certainly a balancing act, but I think once it's achieved, there's sort of this
[24:30.180 --> 24:37.060]  momentum that keeps giving back. And once, you know, once you dial it in, it's, it's really hard
[24:37.060 --> 24:44.100]  not to, to, it's really hard to mess it up, but it's it's something that you got to go through.
[24:44.100 --> 24:50.260]  It's a rabbit hole for sure. Yeah. But once you get it rolling, look how easy it is.
[24:50.260 --> 24:56.500]  You know, yeah, it supports itself. We're only stewarding the microbes and the soil. The rest is,
[24:57.380 --> 25:02.740]  is really up to nature. And I just wish these more people would listen to this and get this,
[25:02.740 --> 25:07.460]  you know, the qualities through the roof, you know, it's easier to do. You're not fighting
[25:07.460 --> 25:13.140]  nature, working with it. But, you know, that's the reason why we have this show is to get,
[25:13.140 --> 25:18.340]  you know, more people to understand that this is the answer to so many of their problems.
[25:18.340 --> 25:24.180]  And it's great to have guys like you showcasing how fucking easy it is once you get it established.
[25:25.060 --> 25:27.460]  Oh, we've been through the ringer getting to this point for sure.
[25:28.260 --> 25:28.740]  Of course.
[25:28.740 --> 25:36.020]  Just the beauty of it. Like we can't, we can't have, you're growing hydro in a sterile environment
[25:36.020 --> 25:41.380]  or we're growing in a full blown living system in here. And for us, it's like, I mean, we both got
[25:41.380 --> 25:44.980]  kids. We want to leave something better for our children. We want to show our kids like this stuff
[25:44.980 --> 25:49.940]  is obtainable with what the earth's got to give and try to give back and heal the land in the
[25:49.940 --> 25:53.220]  process. I mean, we're able to grow this. We've got a river that's a hundred feet from here,
[25:53.220 --> 25:57.780]  so we can't be pouring any nasty shit into that river, polluting everything that's around us. And
[25:58.420 --> 26:00.420]  yeah, we're trying to build everything up, not bring it down.
[26:01.540 --> 26:07.220]  I wish more people would listen to those words, my friend, because, you know, a lot of people
[26:07.220 --> 26:13.140]  just don't give a shit and it sucks. It's true. Yeah. Hey, yeah. There's only so much more time
[26:13.140 --> 26:16.980]  we can not give a shit before we'll be just shitting on ourselves.
[26:18.660 --> 26:22.900]  Well, and again, I appreciate you guys showing the farm because I feel like for a lot of us,
[26:23.140 --> 26:26.580]  we're trying to explain this. Everyone's like, okay, well, give me an example. Show me a farm
[26:26.580 --> 26:31.860]  that's doing this. And then we would say Steve Cantwell in Las Vegas. And they're right. But
[26:31.860 --> 26:37.220]  but this for a few, as I understand for a few years now, and you're showing what it takes. I mean,
[26:37.220 --> 26:42.820]  we're not all PhDs here, but we're understanding how to manage these systems. And that's the real
[26:42.820 --> 26:47.780]  beauty of it is we don't have to, you know, we'd all love to have our knowledge at that level,
[26:47.780 --> 26:51.700]  but especially with a family and stuff like that, it might not be attainable. So we need to have
[26:51.700 --> 26:56.100]  successful flips, we need to undersoil. And one of the easiest ways to do that is just to trust
[26:56.100 --> 27:02.100]  the process, believe in Mother Nature. And yes, there's going to be some issues, some some ways,
[27:02.100 --> 27:06.260]  when you're getting to this level. But then once you are at this level, I mean, look at look at
[27:06.260 --> 27:12.100]  that back row there. I mean, those are all praying leaves, no deficiencies with a two man crew.
[27:12.100 --> 27:17.380]  You know, when we do consulting work, there's sometimes 10 12 people in these little kind of
[27:17.380 --> 27:20.980]  rooms where they're walking around. So labor costs has got to be through the roof for some
[27:20.980 --> 27:25.860]  of these brands. Yeah, and biosecurity is a shit show, because, you know, you put more bodies in
[27:25.860 --> 27:32.020]  there coming from more different places, more potential for outbreaks. So, you know, keeping
[27:32.020 --> 27:39.860]  it to a two man team clean, lean machine. That's the plan. I mean, too many chefs in the kitchen,
[27:39.860 --> 27:45.620]  and you're gonna have some shit. We keep it real, real small, real tight knit. And I mean,
[27:45.620 --> 27:50.180]  it's a lot of damn work for the two of us. But the passion is something that can't be bought,
[27:50.180 --> 27:54.420]  if that makes sense. And you can have as many people in a spot that don't give a shit as you
[27:54.420 --> 28:00.660]  want, but it's gonna show in the end product at the end of the day. So how many hours a day you
[28:00.660 --> 28:10.020]  guys figure you put into this now at this level? Um, I mean, I live on site. So I'm here, like
[28:10.100 --> 28:16.820]  night and day, pretty much throughout the day. Alex, anywhere from 40 plus, depending on what
[28:16.820 --> 28:22.420]  we have going on a week. And, you know, he's got no problem sticking around late showing up early
[28:22.420 --> 28:28.340]  working weekends. Like, it's really like a rare thing to find someone that gives a shit the same
[28:28.340 --> 28:35.300]  way that you do. And like, give the blood, sweat and tears day in and day out. So I mean, the hours
[28:36.100 --> 28:38.900]  I don't know, we don't really look at it that way. Yeah, we just,
[28:40.740 --> 28:44.900]  well, it's like a shit that we got to keep going. Keep the boat afloat.
[28:48.020 --> 28:51.060]  I mean, we enjoy it. There's not much we'd rather do.
[28:52.180 --> 28:57.140]  Right. It's the old saying, if you're, if you're enjoying what you do, it ain't work.
[28:57.140 --> 29:02.180]  So you don't really know. Exactly. And don't get me wrong. I mean, we got our problems. You know,
[29:02.180 --> 29:07.460]  this plan's alive. Sometimes it's going to tell us like we're fucking up and we get that, but we do
[29:07.460 --> 29:12.180]  our best to kind of like Alex was saying, steer the ship in the right direction and kind of roll
[29:12.180 --> 29:17.300]  with the punches. And thankfully we've got, you know, a number of people that are able to kind of
[29:17.300 --> 29:22.900]  have our backs from Mariah helping with IPM. We've got some friends out here that give us knowledge
[29:22.900 --> 29:27.860]  when it comes to, you know, teas, compost, et cetera. And like, we're thankful to have been
[29:27.860 --> 29:32.100]  able to learn from all the people that have given us knowledge and, you know, we've applied,
[29:32.100 --> 29:37.060]  you know, thing after thing. And we're just kind of getting to the point of seeing what works here
[29:37.060 --> 29:41.620]  and what doesn't. We've got our own little microclimate out here. So what works for someone
[29:41.620 --> 29:45.300]  two miles down the road, isn't necessarily going to turn out that way out here for us. So
[29:46.100 --> 29:52.580]  we're kind of tailoring it to our spot. Just quickly catch up on some of the quick questions.
[29:53.540 --> 29:57.940]  What's your space base in those beds between the plants?
[29:59.220 --> 30:03.140]  So a couple of them, we were kind of playing with that this round as we start to scale up to bigger
[30:03.140 --> 30:11.860]  production. Some of them were at nine plants per bed. Some of them we threw 12, some of them six,
[30:11.860 --> 30:17.860]  and some four. And then we did everything from straight plugging clones in to four inch to one
[30:17.860 --> 30:22.820]  gallon to see what would be the most efficient with planting time, vegging time before coming
[30:22.820 --> 30:28.340]  in here, space and all that stuff. So we're kind of finding that the sweet spot's going to be nine
[30:28.340 --> 30:33.540]  plants per bed and these beds are four by four. And then some of the plants that don't stretch
[30:33.540 --> 30:39.860]  as much and are a little smaller, we're going to be stuffing 12 in there. And where are you doing
[30:39.860 --> 30:45.220]  your pheno hunting? In the greenhouse itself? Yeah. And then we do some in the full term as well.
[30:45.300 --> 30:51.380]  So we popped a bunch of seed that we run a bunch of seed outside. And then this last round through
[30:51.380 --> 30:56.820]  winter, we ran a bed and a half of these were straight from seed and we selected a handful and
[30:56.820 --> 31:06.340]  kind of continued with that. So you grew them out and then threw them back into veg? We take clones
[31:06.340 --> 31:14.100]  right before we flip. So we have everything. We have reveged some shit that we, yeah, we weren't
[31:14.100 --> 31:19.940]  super stoked on and then it finished out insane. And we were able to like literally dig the root
[31:19.940 --> 31:26.420]  ball up out of the bed and stick it under a light for 18 hours and anywhere from a month to two,
[31:26.420 --> 31:33.460]  it starts shooting that new veg growth again and able to save them. Sweet. There's a good
[31:33.460 --> 31:38.260]  little trick for you. Yeah. I mean, it usually works. Sometimes it doesn't. And we're kicking
[31:38.260 --> 31:42.500]  ourselves in the ass for the couple we've lost, but it's been pretty consistent for us.
[31:44.980 --> 31:48.820]  And then we talked bio security. Here's a security question.
[31:52.450 --> 31:58.450]  So do you have cameras or dogs or? Oh, security. Oh, security. Yeah. We got cameras, guns, and dogs.
[31:59.730 --> 32:05.570]  Guns, lawyers, and money, right? Yeah. Yeah. Lawyers, guns, and money. Yeah. So I mean,
[32:05.570 --> 32:10.290]  we're state regulated, so we have to have cameras everywhere. We've also got an alarm system on
[32:10.290 --> 32:16.370]  every door, every entry and exit point. We've got gates obviously coming into the farm. And then
[32:16.370 --> 32:19.570]  we just picked up an Anatolian Shepherd and I've got two Pit Bull mixes.
[32:21.730 --> 32:26.210]  I feel like the dogs are the biggest deterrent for most people. That's a fact. They're loud
[32:26.210 --> 32:30.130]  and they let us know. So especially if you got a pit running around, everybody kind of second
[32:30.210 --> 32:36.930]  guesses it. Exactly. And then the Anatolian Shepherd is going to be like 160 pound Shepherd.
[32:38.130 --> 32:45.250]  There are some people too. So you guys do all the trimming too, or do you get some help when it's
[32:45.250 --> 32:49.330]  time for harvesting? No, we don't. Yeah. We don't trim. We don't have time for that. So we do have
[32:49.330 --> 32:55.410]  hands that help us out with planting and trimming, but full-time it's just Alex and myself. So as of
[32:55.410 --> 32:59.650]  right now, we've got two full-time trimmers that kind of also double as hands for us, which is
[32:59.650 --> 33:04.370]  super helpful. And then when we need to push a bulk of weight out, we usually bring on some
[33:04.370 --> 33:11.490]  people here and there. And what's your market? What was that? What's your market? Are you all
[33:11.490 --> 33:17.970]  over Oregon? We're really picky with who we work with. So we want people that kind of share the
[33:17.970 --> 33:22.530]  same value that we do. And we want people that kind of take care of the product. We don't want
[33:22.530 --> 33:26.130]  our stuff sitting on a shelf because it's not going to move. And then three months down the
[33:26.130 --> 33:29.810]  line, someone picks it up and it turns to dust and they associate that with our work.
[33:30.690 --> 33:36.610]  So we try to work with people that are able to move amounts of high quality products.
[33:36.610 --> 33:41.490]  And yeah, we're real picky. You want to give a shout out to some of those
[33:42.370 --> 33:48.370]  shops that share your values? Yeah. You got Forward Cannabis in Grants Pass.
[33:49.170 --> 33:55.490]  We've got Farm to Table in Medford. TJ's up in Portland.
[33:57.170 --> 33:59.970]  We're looking at working with Treasure Valley out in Ontario.
[34:06.070 --> 34:11.670]  Oh, there's a, I think it's High Cannabis up in Astoria. They're good people up there.
[34:11.990 --> 34:18.070]  Um, that's kind of it. Yeah. For now, at least.
[34:19.110 --> 34:24.470]  And what kind of price trends you've seen you're predicting for the rest of the year?
[34:24.470 --> 34:28.870]  Like our bulk, is bulk price going up? Is it going down?
[34:29.910 --> 34:36.230]  Our bulk staying pretty steady. We're able to market most of our stuff is indoor. So it helps
[34:36.230 --> 34:41.510]  us kind of stay relevant year round. And we've got a bunch of strains that a lot of people don't have.
[34:42.390 --> 34:46.710]  It seems to be sought after kind of continuously. The outdoors is what usually takes a hit,
[34:47.990 --> 34:50.790]  price point wise throughout the year, because there's so much of it in Oregon.
[34:51.350 --> 34:56.310]  But as far as the greenhouse, our stuff's basically sold before it's even harvested.
[34:57.510 --> 34:57.990]  Well done.
[35:00.310 --> 35:04.950]  I feel like we used to talk about that, Alex, especially when a certain brand came out,
[35:04.950 --> 35:10.070]  and they would talk about 3 Light. And then it would be, we would be like, well, if we don't
[35:10.070 --> 35:14.950]  achieve that, but people are willing to prepay you for two and a half, where is the value there?
[35:14.950 --> 35:19.910]  If you have to not have to go out and chase customers and that kind of thing. And especially
[35:19.910 --> 35:23.430]  at the commercial level, if you have people that are ready to buy it as soon as it's ready,
[35:24.550 --> 35:28.390]  that is again, next level. I mean, you have a brand as well.
[35:28.390 --> 35:33.510]  Oh yeah. Yeah. We have the brand of logistical connection is really key or has been key
[35:34.070 --> 35:40.790]  for keeping our flow going and staying on the next cycle without having to play catch up. So
[35:41.910 --> 35:47.830]  we're really thankful for the people that we've created connections with that love our product
[35:47.830 --> 35:53.910]  and love coming back. Now, Phillip, I've always equated to the team as being like,
[35:55.190 --> 36:00.310]  for lack of a better understanding, football terms, right? And so when we're talking about
[36:00.310 --> 36:03.990]  building up our team, we really need a quarterback. And it seems like you were
[36:03.990 --> 36:07.830]  able to pick up a quarterback, in my opinion, here in Denver that a lot of us
[36:08.710 --> 36:12.550]  knew would get picked up somewhere. We just knew he had the talent and obviously you guys
[36:13.350 --> 36:16.630]  are now working together. So I was wondering if you could kind of go in how you guys found each
[36:16.630 --> 36:21.510]  other, because back in the day, Alex was just a breath of fresh air talking about,
[36:22.470 --> 36:27.190]  these are certain ways that we can continue to grow. He attended a class that I had,
[36:27.190 --> 36:32.710]  and then I felt like we just continued to shoot the shit back and forth. So how are you guys able
[36:32.710 --> 36:37.830]  to link up? And then again, I would love to know more about how you guys are able to keep just
[36:37.830 --> 36:42.870]  basically a two man team operating. Cause I would love to give more insight for the viewers on that,
[36:42.870 --> 36:46.870]  because yes, we can grow great cannabis, but again, it comes down to the labor and those
[36:46.870 --> 36:53.670]  kinds of costs as well. And I think a lot of farmers forget that. That's a fact. Well,
[36:53.670 --> 36:58.870]  originally, so I started this on my own and I was building out a hugel bed outside.
[36:59.430 --> 37:05.350]  This is not this last year, but the year before. And I was working with someone who was kind of
[37:05.350 --> 37:11.110]  giving me a shit ton of knowledge and helping me kind of get everything established inside and
[37:11.110 --> 37:18.310]  outside. And Alex reached out to me and was like, Hey, I love what you're doing essentially, for lack
[37:18.310 --> 37:25.670]  of better words. Are you hiring? And it was insane because at the time I had literally just
[37:25.670 --> 37:30.470]  talked to my wife, I think the week prior. And I was like, how the fuck am I going to scale up when
[37:30.470 --> 37:34.870]  I can't find anyone to work out here? I work all day. I don't have time to be running around looking
[37:34.870 --> 37:43.030]  for people and interviewing people. And he actually was following one of the people that I was working
[37:43.030 --> 37:47.830]  with at the time. And the dude was like, yeah, if he reached out to you, I would give him a shot.
[37:47.910 --> 37:54.790]  And so we went and shot the shit for like two hours, I think it was at a coffee shop. And I knew
[37:54.790 --> 37:59.110]  it was a fit. I mean, you can tell usually within the first 10 seconds if someone's going to work
[37:59.110 --> 38:03.670]  or not. And when it's two hours later and we're still bullshitting, I felt like that's a pretty
[38:03.670 --> 38:10.310]  strong sign that I shouldn't let this one go, if that makes sense. And I mean, we just we have very
[38:10.310 --> 38:18.150]  similar thought processes. We both want very similar outcomes. He's not afraid to work. He's
[38:18.150 --> 38:25.990]  in here basically massaging bags of alpaca shit with me without like at a moment's notice, like,
[38:25.990 --> 38:31.750]  hey, we got to move this around. Let's do it. And he's like, yeah, shoulder deep. We're picking up
[38:31.750 --> 38:37.270]  shit, moving shit. That's a rare thing. A lot of people would get grossed out. They wouldn't want
[38:37.270 --> 38:42.790]  to do it. They have their things they do and don't want to do. And he's not afraid to get his
[38:42.790 --> 38:48.230]  hands dirty with me. And that's huge. I mean, being that it's a place where it's just him and myself,
[38:48.230 --> 38:53.510]  like I need someone that's ideally interchangeable with me if I have shit that I have to do or
[38:53.510 --> 38:58.390]  things come up. And he's been that 100% of the time. So it's like in reference to a football
[38:58.390 --> 39:03.190]  team, we're like a fucking two man football team, if that's a possibility. But we're kind of
[39:03.190 --> 39:07.030]  interchangeable with all positions at all times. You're ready to go.
[39:08.630 --> 39:13.590]  Well, and that's, you know, a lot of people, especially the owner operators, they don't
[39:13.590 --> 39:18.710]  really understand that you really need to allow someone a year or two. That's why we use the
[39:18.710 --> 39:24.390]  football analogy. It takes a while for somebody to really show their skill set. And unfortunately,
[39:24.390 --> 39:28.790]  we see a lot of times when people only have three months, six months, even a year, I don't feel like
[39:28.790 --> 39:34.310]  is long enough for people to really show their skill sets. So when you were able to give Alex a
[39:34.310 --> 39:38.710]  chance, that's why I reached out so that we could have you guys on the show is because I want more
[39:38.710 --> 39:44.790]  and more people to sit here today watching us. Maybe they're thinking about farming. I know Alex
[39:44.790 --> 39:50.550]  and myself, we were shooting the shit, you know, however long ago that was buddy about this kind
[39:50.550 --> 39:55.910]  of stuff. And now he here he is making, you know, made a career for himself. And that's really what
[39:55.910 --> 40:01.110]  this show is about is I want to educate. We want to educate and go out of our way so that more and
[40:01.110 --> 40:06.630]  more quote unquote Alex's, if you will, can get picked up by the owner operators, maybe that
[40:06.630 --> 40:11.510]  they're not seen or, you know, luckily for Instagram and stuff. And then of course, Alex's
[40:11.510 --> 40:15.270]  go getter, you know, he's the one that was calling you up for a job. So again, for the viewers,
[40:15.270 --> 40:19.990]  you got to go out in there and get it as well. So continue to educate yourself. But as more and
[40:19.990 --> 40:24.710]  more people start to understand these philosophies and techniques, there's going to be more opportunity
[40:24.710 --> 40:28.550]  for you guys to have a career, find a job that could potentially turn into a career.
[40:29.190 --> 40:34.470]  Right, right. And I just want to add in that, that, you know, for those that are listening that
[40:34.470 --> 40:42.790]  may not have a background in in horticulture or have any idea where to begin. You know, I start I
[40:42.790 --> 40:47.670]  was I had a background in culinary. I was like a nutritionist and I was like, man, like, I don't
[40:47.670 --> 40:53.750]  know shit about growing a plant. Like, where do I start? And I started volunteering at at the
[40:53.750 --> 41:02.390]  Growhaus in Denver, a non-for-profit organization that grew that grows vegetables in hydroponic and
[41:02.390 --> 41:06.950]  deep water culture systems. But we'll take volunteers if you just want to help out. And
[41:06.950 --> 41:12.310]  there's so much room to learn. So, you know, you got it. You got to find the right places.
[41:12.310 --> 41:18.870]  But I think there's opportunity everywhere. And, you know, you just got to be passionate and driven.
[41:18.870 --> 41:25.350]  I moved out here. I moved up from Florida to move to Colorado. So, you know, finally moved
[41:25.350 --> 41:32.310]  out here to Oregon. So I really fucking really fucking pushed myself to make this dream happen.
[41:32.310 --> 41:38.150]  And it did. So I'm super stoked and I'm stoked for anyone who takes it on and is willing to
[41:38.950 --> 41:42.790]  to put in the work because it's worth it. If you really want to do it, it's worth it. You know,
[41:42.790 --> 41:47.350]  you got to love what you do. Look at that smile on his face, boy. I'm telling you, man.
[41:47.910 --> 41:53.270]  That's it all. This is kind of like the I told you so moment, I hope, for a lot of these viewers
[41:53.270 --> 41:58.230]  have been rocking with us for a long time. You know, we started this October 1st. Right. And
[41:58.230 --> 42:05.590]  there's people there that are making a. We love your passion, buddy, you've always been like that.
[42:05.590 --> 42:09.990]  And again, I hope other people are seeing this and really it's resonating with them. It's like
[42:09.990 --> 42:14.550]  you can do this. You can go out there, find somebody that will give you an opportunity and
[42:14.550 --> 42:20.550]  then show your skill set as long as you continue to work hard. I remember even when you kind of
[42:20.550 --> 42:25.110]  gave your first talk, Alex, you were nervous as hell, too, you know, but if you're you got to
[42:25.110 --> 42:29.110]  kind of jump into that deep and continue to educate. And as long as you are educating,
[42:29.110 --> 42:34.390]  then you start to educate others. I feel like that's where we're learning a lot just from the
[42:34.390 --> 42:38.390]  questions and stuff that have come up week by week. And then thankfully, Leighton can answer
[42:38.550 --> 42:40.070]  I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
[42:42.070 --> 42:43.030]  Takes a village, man.
[42:45.110 --> 42:50.470]  Just quickly, I know my audio is glitchy, but can we see the alpaca? Are they close by?
[42:51.190 --> 42:53.030]  Hell yeah. Yeah, let's take a walk.
[42:53.990 --> 42:56.390]  Do the outside tour. We can see the pups and everything.
[42:57.190 --> 43:00.470]  They I don't know where they're at, but let's take a yeah, let's take a walk.
[43:03.190 --> 43:07.990]  And we appreciate you guys showing your grow from A to Z. You know, a lot of people don't do that.
[43:07.990 --> 43:11.030]  I mean, we're trying to be transparent. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say we don't have
[43:11.030 --> 43:14.950]  our shit. I mean, we're dealing with a plant at the end of the day. We're farming. I mean,
[43:14.950 --> 43:19.350]  there's going to be problems. There's a big ego involved. Can you show those air intakes or.
[43:22.070 --> 43:27.270]  So there are 54 inch Fosterman fans and we got three of them. So this allows us to turn our
[43:27.270 --> 43:33.030]  air over in this house. I think it's twice a minute. Nice. And then we've also got a ridge
[43:33.030 --> 43:37.350]  vent for when it's not too hot to let a little bit of hot air if we don't want these bastards
[43:37.350 --> 43:44.470]  running. Now, what are you doing about pollen in the air? I mean, well, thankfully, like it hasn't
[43:44.470 --> 43:49.910]  been a huge problem for us at this point. I mean, obviously the outdoor gets some shit here and
[43:49.910 --> 43:55.270]  there, but we may find a seed here and there, but we haven't had problems with having fully
[43:55.270 --> 44:00.150]  seeded crops at all. Thankfully, we have farms on both sides of it. Yeah. Thankfully, like the wind
[44:00.230 --> 44:07.750]  kind of blows away from the greenhouse and then I'm not totally sure if it's true or not, but I'm
[44:07.750 --> 44:12.390]  thinking that light trap may help trap a lot of shit on the back end and the our wet wall and
[44:12.390 --> 44:17.030]  everything just kind of gets caught up in there. I'm hoping and hopefully it stays that way. And
[44:17.030 --> 44:22.870]  I don't eat my words, but no, you want the wet wall. Yeah. So and then we got a bunch of
[44:22.870 --> 44:29.990]  polyculture going on out here. So, yeah, we'll be planting here in about a week. All this stuff just
[44:29.990 --> 44:35.590]  made it through the heat wave. So everything is nice and acclimated. And then we had this property
[44:35.590 --> 44:41.430]  when I picked it up was run by people who ran a bunch of cattle out here. So this this soil is
[44:41.430 --> 44:49.670]  super, super full of nutrition, but it is clay. So we planted a shit ton of daikon radish to kind of
[44:50.470 --> 44:57.910]  bio till and break up that soil for us. And everything's kind of year two is just thriving.
[44:57.910 --> 45:01.990]  I mean, the health this year on everything versus last year is a night and day difference.
[45:02.870 --> 45:10.070]  And then we've got, yeah, these Hugo culture beds. We've got literally like tons and tons of
[45:10.070 --> 45:15.270]  wood buried in these rows right here, all from a local company that was going to take it to the
[45:15.270 --> 45:19.670]  dump. They just came and dropped it off here. So we're able to dig it all in and now we're sinking
[45:19.670 --> 45:26.390]  a shit ton of carbon back into the earth right here and just kind of pushing forward. And we're
[45:26.390 --> 45:32.630]  going to be doing the same irrigation set up out here that we've got in the greenhouse. We found
[45:32.630 --> 45:39.830]  just personally that we're not huge fans of drip systems. And yeah, we keep the micro sprinklers
[45:39.830 --> 45:44.950]  out here and keep everything nice and nice and consistently wet. No dry spots, no dry patches.
[45:46.070 --> 45:49.590]  Can you kind of go deeper into why you don't like the drip systems? Because I've heard several
[45:49.590 --> 45:55.110]  people say that. Yeah, it's we just noticed, like, especially when we're trying to to continually
[45:55.110 --> 46:01.510]  create humus and keep that optimal moisture level around the whole. Yeah, we want the whole bed to
[46:01.510 --> 46:06.310]  be wet. We're not just trying to wet the root ball because if this, you know, if our roots hit dry
[46:06.310 --> 46:11.270]  spots in the soil, that that roots dying back and then that part of that plant, maybe, you know,
[46:11.270 --> 46:15.430]  once it's later in flower and it's not producing those new roots anymore, we may run into some
[46:15.430 --> 46:22.310]  fucking problems late in flower. And then also it just helps to kind of create that the microbiology
[46:22.310 --> 46:27.270]  all the way through the entire bed consistently. And we noticed, like, by running drip, we'd have
[46:27.270 --> 46:32.790]  dry spots, we'd have extremely saturated spots. And there's just too many inconsistencies that
[46:32.790 --> 46:38.950]  we couldn't really manage ourselves. So now we're running sprinklers and they just they soak
[46:38.950 --> 46:43.590]  everything and they keep everything nice and consistently watered. And then we're also doing
[46:43.590 --> 46:51.430]  the same teas out here that we do in our greenhouse. So everything that happens inside happens outside
[46:51.430 --> 46:56.870]  and vice versa. It's all inclusive, essentially. So you run in those sprinklers during the day or
[46:56.870 --> 47:04.310]  just at night? Or? We do them. So we'll do them at night and in the morning and like early afternoon.
[47:04.310 --> 47:08.710]  It's just too damn hot out here to be wasting water in the middle of the day, especially with
[47:08.710 --> 47:13.750]  the drought we have going on. But fortunately for us, like this whole farm is run off of a spring
[47:13.830 --> 47:20.710]  pond that comes from way off in the mountains out there, somewhere in that area. So we're
[47:20.710 --> 47:26.310]  kind of blessed with that. Kinda? Kinda. Just a hair. Just a hair.
[47:27.910 --> 47:31.670]  Phillip, you have a gorgeous piece of property, man. I mean, that's the real dream too,
[47:31.670 --> 47:35.990]  is not only to be farming, but to be farming on land that you, you know, that's yours.
[47:35.990 --> 47:39.670]  Yeah, it's no punishment to have to be on that property 24-7.
[47:40.630 --> 47:45.110]  That's a fact. Unless it's 115, then it's a little, but we'll take it. We'll take it.
[47:45.830 --> 47:47.830]  Just take your shirt off like Layton. No problem.
[47:47.830 --> 47:53.030]  Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. We get straight brown in summer out here. So.
[47:55.510 --> 47:56.950]  Where's those alpacas at?
[47:56.950 --> 47:58.230]  Are you going to be growing?
[47:58.230 --> 48:02.950]  Right now. They're up in this pasture up here. So we've got a couple of different paddocks that
[48:02.950 --> 48:07.110]  we kind of move them around to keep them getting some fresh food. And then we're going to be
[48:07.110 --> 48:13.030]  getting cows here in a couple of weeks to help with our pasture management and help everything
[48:13.030 --> 48:22.390]  kind of just continue to bring life back into our soil and everything. So the alpaca are somewhere
[48:22.390 --> 48:26.230]  up here. Oh, they're in the shade. Yeah.
[48:29.260 --> 48:32.060]  So are you growing veggies and stuff too, or just cannabis?
[48:32.380 --> 48:33.500]  So that's actually.
[48:35.500 --> 48:38.860]  Zucchini out a little early and we kind of cooked the shit out of them.
[48:39.980 --> 48:45.100]  That was our mistake to learn. However, some of them are coming back beautifully.
[48:45.980 --> 48:49.180]  And then we're going to be throwing some more food and just kind of
[48:49.180 --> 48:53.980]  trying to do a little bit of everything. Not sure if you can quite see them. They're a little ways out
[48:55.420 --> 48:59.180]  back there. They're chilling in the shade right now.
[49:00.060 --> 49:05.420]  This is a question for Phillip and Alex. I had always heard that these guys are,
[49:05.420 --> 49:10.300]  alpacas are more like dogs when you have like a kind of like a herd of them, if you will.
[49:10.300 --> 49:11.260]  Yeah, they kind of get that package.
[49:11.260 --> 49:13.260]  They all have unique personalities.
[49:13.260 --> 49:13.740]  Yeah.
[49:13.740 --> 49:19.660]  And they're extremely loyal to you. Like they don't spit in your face like llamas. I mean,
[49:19.660 --> 49:22.780]  I know it's still kind of like a llama, but is all that true?
[49:22.780 --> 49:26.780]  Yeah, yeah. My kids can straight like pet them, feed them. They'll eat right out of your hand.
[49:27.180 --> 49:30.060]  I mean, you show them love, they're going to show you love back. They're not super angry
[49:30.060 --> 49:34.940]  animals by any means. And yeah, they're like little friends, essentially.
[49:36.380 --> 49:39.660]  They all, like you said, have their own personality. You know, some of them are a
[49:39.660 --> 49:42.460]  little more skittish. Some of them are a little more alpha and dominant.
[49:43.260 --> 49:46.860]  And yeah, they're interesting characters to say the least.
[49:46.860 --> 49:50.780]  And then they're clean animals. They will all kind of poop in the same area.
[49:50.780 --> 49:55.180]  Exactly. So they have their little communal poop spot. So it makes it easier for them to
[49:55.260 --> 49:59.260]  poop in the same area. So they have their communal poop spot. So it makes it easy for
[49:59.260 --> 50:04.140]  us to pick it up and not have to go searching for shit everywhere. It's ideal for us.
[50:05.020 --> 50:06.540]  Now what do you do with them in the winter?
[50:07.340 --> 50:07.980]  What's that?
[50:07.980 --> 50:10.140]  What do you do with them in the winter? You have a barn?
[50:10.940 --> 50:13.580]  Yeah. So I have, they got their little house right there.
[50:13.580 --> 50:14.300]  Oh, nice.
[50:14.300 --> 50:17.900]  There. If you can see that. Yeah. So we built that for them. Actually,
[50:17.900 --> 50:22.780]  Alex helped me build that with my father-in-law and my brother-in-law. So we knocked that out.
[50:23.420 --> 50:26.460]  And get some shelter when it's raining or snowing.
[50:28.620 --> 50:30.620]  But they're pretty much outdoors year round.
[50:31.660 --> 50:32.380]  Yeah, they chill.
[50:33.420 --> 50:33.820]  Nice.
[50:33.820 --> 50:38.140]  They're used to the extreme weather. So we'll get them sheared here real soon. And
[50:38.140 --> 50:41.660]  we spray them down with hoses throughout summer when it's real hot. They like baths.
[50:43.580 --> 50:48.540]  And for you guys that don't know, alpaca hair is wonderful.
[50:48.540 --> 50:52.140]  I mean, it's like, yeah, the softest thing you could ever feel.
[50:52.780 --> 50:57.900]  It really is. There's my daughter. So that's one of the reasons why we wanted to do it out here.
[50:57.900 --> 50:59.100]  I want to give them a better life.
[50:59.660 --> 51:00.380]  Oh, man.
[51:00.380 --> 51:01.340]  Right on, man.
[51:01.340 --> 51:02.140]  Yeah.
[51:02.140 --> 51:06.540]  And you guys got the playbook. I've been saying for years that I would love to have a piece of
[51:06.540 --> 51:10.460]  property with alpacas and some lion head rabbits running around.
[51:12.140 --> 51:17.260]  Yeah, we're slowly developing out here. I mean, it's been a huge, huge transformation. This was
[51:17.260 --> 51:22.380]  just a big piece of grass when I moved out here three years ago, four years ago. And then in the
[51:22.380 --> 51:27.260]  short amount of time Alex has been out here with me, it's transformed tremendously. I mean, this
[51:27.260 --> 51:31.580]  place, yeah, it's a night and day difference from what it was when I was here on my own. The amount
[51:31.580 --> 51:35.260]  of shit you can do when you have someone, even just one other person that's passionate about
[51:35.260 --> 51:39.580]  everything, like you can transform some shit in a very small matter of time.
[51:42.860 --> 51:46.380]  Because I know a lot of farms out there wanting to switch to this. They just,
[51:46.380 --> 51:50.460]  they need more visuals. And this is the kind of stuff that we hope that we can continue to
[51:50.460 --> 51:58.220]  give the community. It's the visuals. That's what we're shooting for too. I mean, we want to be
[51:58.220 --> 52:02.540]  totally transparent. I mean, this isn't something you're just going to walk into overnight and be
[52:02.540 --> 52:06.300]  just feeding, or not feeding, just giving water to everything and just expecting it all to thrive.
[52:06.300 --> 52:13.900]  I mean, we work hard. We've done everything from like IPM to pulling fucking sweet potatoes
[52:13.900 --> 52:19.980]  covered in roly polies out of our dirt because we had too fucking many, to literally like digging
[52:20.060 --> 52:27.580]  holes, to dropping straw, top, like we do everything. And it's, yeah, rain, shine, snow, it doesn't matter.
[52:27.580 --> 52:32.380]  Like if it's got to get done, like you just got to make it happen. And I feel like that's the
[52:32.380 --> 52:35.980]  biggest thing is like you got to have people that aren't scared to work, essentially.
[52:36.860 --> 52:44.380]  Catching a stride, really pushing for the stride because, you know, nature does its own thing.
[52:44.380 --> 52:48.780]  We're just kind of stewarding it. So we don't tell it what to do. It just does what it wants to do
[52:48.780 --> 52:52.140]  as long as it has the right pieces in place, it'll thrive.
[52:53.420 --> 52:54.620]  Yes, sir. Well said.
[52:57.660 --> 53:00.540]  Alex, when are we going to get you doing more education again?
[53:00.540 --> 53:04.140]  Phillip, going to let you maybe travel every now and then to some of these expos?
[53:04.140 --> 53:05.900]  Because I'd love to find out.
[53:05.900 --> 53:06.780]  Take him. Take him.
[53:06.780 --> 53:07.340]  Yeah, man.
[53:10.700 --> 53:11.500]  I don't want to leave.
[53:13.660 --> 53:17.740]  Just a weekend. I really, you know, this is the kind of stuff that we want to get out there. I
[53:17.740 --> 53:23.740]  mean, here's two people managing all this. And it's gorgeous. I mean, what? Why wouldn't you
[53:23.740 --> 53:24.860]  want to promote that kind of thing?
[53:26.140 --> 53:32.220]  Yeah, you know, that's what I love about Instagram. And that's how I met Phillip,
[53:32.220 --> 53:36.300]  too, is through Instagram. So it's that's kind of a platform we're trying to reach
[53:36.300 --> 53:41.900]  or show people what we're doing and how possible it is. Because whether you're growing in a tent
[53:41.900 --> 53:48.220]  in your house or you have some an acre of land or you can make it happen. And, you know,
[53:48.220 --> 53:52.300]  even if you don't have alpacas, you know, get yourself some rabbits and start feeding
[53:52.300 --> 53:55.820]  your rabbits. You'll notice how fast you're going to accumulate that carbon and nitrogen
[53:55.820 --> 54:00.220]  ratio from, you know, with the poop and the hay. And all of a sudden now you have mulch
[54:00.220 --> 54:05.420]  and then you're going to have soil. So it's it really just you get start somewhere and
[54:06.700 --> 54:09.340]  you'll reap the benefits. You'll reap what you sow.
[54:10.220 --> 54:14.700]  Let's go a little deeper into the rabbits. I think everybody on the show knows that I'm a
[54:14.700 --> 54:18.620]  huge proponent of lionhead rabbits. I think they're gorgeous. You know, you can train them
[54:18.620 --> 54:23.980]  like a dog as well. I noticed you have, you know, Alex, you're raising rabbits as well. I don't
[54:23.980 --> 54:28.220]  think they're lionhead rabbits. So I was hoping that you could kind of go into your rabbits and
[54:28.220 --> 54:30.300]  what they're offering and why you chose that breed.
[54:31.100 --> 54:41.180]  Yeah, I got a rabbit from a buddy who showed me what he was doing. And then I went on Craigslist
[54:41.180 --> 54:46.620]  and I found some, I found a family selling some lionhead rabbits. And really what I wanted was
[54:46.620 --> 54:54.540]  the lionhead genetics with the fur, the lionhead fur. I wanted that in my breeding project. And
[54:55.180 --> 55:00.780]  I, the thing that the problem with lionhead is that it's not really a problem, but they're sort
[55:00.780 --> 55:06.380]  of like a boutique rabbit and they don't really produce a lot of meat. And that's why I raised
[55:06.380 --> 55:17.020]  my rabbits is for me and food security. So I, I chose to kind of veer off of the, the,
[55:17.980 --> 55:27.260]  the lionhead platforming and start incorporating, you know, California rabbits, California chinchilla
[55:27.820 --> 55:36.380]  and what is it? Giant Flemish or yeah, giant Fleming or Flemish rabbits. And that's,
[55:36.380 --> 55:42.780]  those really are like larger rabbit and I'm breeding for meat. So I really started raising
[55:42.860 --> 55:45.900]  them. I got, you know, found them on Craigslist. So it's really not hard to,
[55:47.020 --> 55:51.740]  hard to find. You just got to really look and, and especially in rural areas like this,
[55:51.740 --> 55:56.860]  there's a lot of people doing this kind of stuff. So it wasn't hard. And then you really don't need
[55:56.860 --> 56:04.220]  a large space. You just kind of, I got a deep mulch system in my, in my pen and I, I just kind
[56:04.220 --> 56:11.500]  of change it out. Every, it gets a little too poopy. I either put some more mulch on it or I,
[56:12.460 --> 56:17.820]  yeah, just keep, just keep it going. Don't, don't let it go. Get stagnant. That's kind of it.
[56:21.960 --> 56:27.160]  Well, we might've lost him there. So again, like, yeah, there he is.
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.320]  Zach, there he is. So I had a question for you. Yeah. We're kind of, yeah,
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.520]  I think he's trying to make his way back a little bit. That's it.
[56:43.800 --> 56:49.480]  That's the only issue with the garden. I was going to ask him, had he thought about trying
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.560]  some of that natural farming bedding techniques? So you add an IMO in there
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.480]  to get the organisms to break down the bedding even faster. And of course you end up with
[56:59.480 --> 57:06.520]  inoculant, not just a manure. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. The more IMO you can get in there, the better.
[57:07.240 --> 57:16.040]  I, I try and make it simple and just, you know, I just work with the IMOs that are there in the,
[57:16.040 --> 57:21.480]  in the hay and in the poop. And I feed some local forage to the rabbits,
[57:22.360 --> 57:28.040]  grass feed. I do some you know, some tree leaves that are good, that are okay for rabbits to eat.
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.120]  Kind of have to keep an eye out for what you're feeding. There's some things that
[57:32.120 --> 57:38.760]  rabbits that are not good for rabbits that could actually kill them. And so I look out for that.
[57:40.040 --> 57:46.600]  Labs is a great one. Lactic acid bacteria serum, spray that in the bedding to kind of keep
[57:46.600 --> 57:55.160]  E. coli down and, and just keep a fresh smell. So that, that one's a good one. Otherwise I,
[57:55.160 --> 57:59.560]  that's, that's pretty much it. I don't do too much, but that, that, those are definitely the
[57:59.560 --> 58:08.120]  ones that I, that I, I do is the lactic acid bacteria serum and I keep changing out the mulch.
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.640]  So keeps the cycle going. Yeah. That's awesome. I love the fact that you bring in some natural
[58:13.640 --> 58:20.760]  leaf litter and natural plants to supplement the food. Yeah. Deep litter system. I got like maybe
[58:20.760 --> 58:28.440]  half a foot of, of litter in my, but I just keep, you know, keeping it dry. Rabbits love
[58:28.440 --> 58:35.080]  a dry area to kind of hang out and you know, got to have some, got to keep them happy. Yeah.
[58:35.960 --> 58:40.680]  And they're social creatures too. So I like, I just have one bunny, but obviously I have two
[58:40.680 --> 58:44.600]  little boys that play with them all day long. So if you don't have that, then you should have two
[58:44.600 --> 58:53.400]  bunnies. Absolutely. One bunny is a sad world. Yeah. You see two, we got two here.
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.640]  Just love all those fucking smiles, guys. You're doing a great job, man. Just
[59:02.920 --> 59:07.960]  so good to have, you know, people with, with the ability to prove what we talk about,
[59:07.960 --> 59:10.920]  Brian and I talk about for what a year now? No, not quite a year.
[59:11.880 --> 59:18.360]  No, but we're, I think we're like seven, eight months in. So again, we are doing this the right
[59:18.360 --> 59:22.680]  way. And I feel like the audience is appreciating it and we're just trying to continue to give you
[59:22.680 --> 59:29.400]  guys other thought processes as well. Of course, Leighton and I believe in the way that basically
[59:29.400 --> 59:32.760]  these guys are farming, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we can't learn from
[59:32.760 --> 59:36.840]  other farmers. And I wanted to make sure that people understood that as well. Cause some of
[59:36.840 --> 59:40.680]  the guys were giving me slack about some of the stuff that we talked about at Canicon.
[59:40.680 --> 59:46.280]  But again, that's not our show guys. We're just interviewing farmers at that thing. But here,
[59:46.280 --> 59:50.840]  I feel like this is our bread and butter. This is something that is near and dear to our heart.
[59:50.840 --> 59:56.520]  And the passion is always there with a living soil, natural farmer, whatever you want to call
[59:56.520 --> 01:00:01.480]  it, biodynamic farmers. It just seems like that passion is there that isn't there. It doesn't
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.360]  really resonate with some of the other farmers that cultivate cannabis in a variety of different
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:11.240]  methods. And I feel like you can see that on their faces today, just how happy Phillip and
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:17.480]  Alex are to be able to do this and especially to do it just them. The smaller the circle,
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.840]  I feel like the easier it's going to be. And then you guys get to reap the rewards because you are
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:27.000]  putting in the work. Exactly. I mean, we're both family people. We're trying to keep it as close
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.280]  in as possible. I mean, anyone that's out here essentially is ideally extended family to us.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.960]  We put too much time, too much passion, too much love into what we do to just have people come out
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.520]  here and half-ass and not give a shit about what they're doing and kind of like fuck with our flow.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.200]  And I mean, like you said, we're just happy to be doing what we're doing and doing it together.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.400]  It's a dream team right here, the A-Team. Yeah, the A-plus team there.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.240]  You picked up a Hall of Famer over there throwing a little touchdowns.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:04.920]  Now, we all have our mentors. We all kind of heard the, I feel like kind of the main ones. I was
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.760]  wondering if Phillip, since I'm learning more about you today, sir, if you could talk about
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:13.480]  some of the mentors that maybe aren't as mainstream, some of the education that you've gotten.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.560]  Because as far as I understand, both you boys are self-taught.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.040]  Yeah, I mean, I actually, so I just read in the beginning, like I read everything I could. I
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.360]  studied everything I could. It was something I like, once I started really growing cannabis,
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.040]  like it became something that was super interesting to me. I love the whole dynamic of like
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.960]  plants choosing what they want and basically like allowing the plants to be a plant essentially,
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.000]  and not kind of telling the plant what you think it wants and getting that ultimate
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.680]  genetic expression out of it. And I hooked up with this guy, doesn't really want his name dropped,
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.760]  but his name used to be Kush Syndicate on Instagram, but he's not on social media anymore.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.880]  Him and this other dude named Jason, and they've taught me
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.600]  insane amounts of knowledge. I mean, the things that they dropped in my head, and Alex was actually
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:19.640]  here towards the end of me working with them. It helped our game insanely. Everything from
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:26.360]  the inputs, the amounts, the IPM, like the teas, the recipes, like how to fight anything from
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:32.680]  root aphids to russets. We learned so much shit for them and I'll forever be grateful for them,
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.840]  you know, kind of showing up in my life. And yeah, they taught me damn near everything I know on like
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.800]  a practicality basis. I mean, I had a lot of theories and stuff, but I'd only implemented so
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.920]  much. And they kind of were able to reiterate, yeah, like you guys are on the right path, you're
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.640]  doing the right thing. It's going to take some time for shit to develop, but you know, kind of
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.200]  like hold fast and don't let this shit deter you, because you're going to get hit. Mother nature is
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.920]  not forgiving, that's for damn sure. And if you fuck up, she's going to let you know real fast.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.040]  And it's not always easy to correct that. Sometimes it takes a little while, but I mean,
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.960]  luckily I found someone that's willing to stick it out with me, regardless of what the problem
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:17.800]  seems to be. And thus far, we've been able to kind of, you know, figure it out step by step and day
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.960]  by day. Just take it one step at a time. And even with Alex, I mean, you know, we bounce all types
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:30.360]  of ideas off each other, all types of hypothesis, theories, etc. Because we take, I guess you could
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.160]  say we take a little bit from everyone's philosophies and kind of put our perspective on
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.920]  it. And you know, sometimes we'll both be like, you sound fucking crazy. Or like, you know what, let's
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.840]  do it and see what happens. And sometimes it's like, damn, that was fucking great, we're not
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:50.520]  going to stop. And other times it kicks us right in the ass. And that's kind of like, also what we
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.440]  love about this game is like, they're never a stale moment, never a dull moment. Whether it's outside
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.520]  in here, like it doesn't matter. We've always got something to learn. Forever be students.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.760]  And I would imagine at this level, you know, you'd mentioned that you're water only at this point?
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.840]  No, no. I don't know if we'll ever get to that point, honestly. I like teas myself. I know Alex
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:21.160]  likes teas too. I don't know. I mean, I've heard, I don't know, myself, and not to like knock anyone
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.560]  that does that, I haven't seen myself something grown with just water that couldn't have probably
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:33.240]  been pushed a little further given teas or amendments or ferments. But that's just my
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:39.000]  thought. I don't know everything, that's my opinion. And I like, because we do more than just try to
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.240]  feed the plant. And by us giving that compost and that biology and those ferments to the plants and
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:51.880]  to the soil, like it just, we've seen it develop a thousandfold in just a year's time. I mean, we
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:57.720]  are re-amend as well, so our soil has always got food in it. We kind of are, I guess you could say,
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:05.000]  we water every day, but we only do teas twice a week. So we aren't heavily feeding them teas or
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.720]  anything. And like I said, they're supplemental. We don't drench our beds.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.560]  Are these teas your recipes or? I got them from the Kush Syndicate.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.960]  All right. And he kind of like the little playbook of like, here, I'm going to open this world to you
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.440]  and kind of do what you will with it. And we've also found, you know, we played with some stuff
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:30.520]  on our own too. Yeah, ferments for sure. I mean, we do straight anaerobic ferments from everything
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:35.400]  that's on site. We're blessed with a shit ton of horsetail out here that grows right by the river.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.760]  So we got a ferment that we run through veg and for the mothers and everything with foliar. That's,
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:45.800]  you know, shit ton of silica. And then we ferment cannabis stalks and leaves,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:51.320]  old root balls if they get pulled out. And then I've got an orchard on site that we kind of do
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:56.760]  for the sugar so we can get away from that sugar aspect of farming and supplement that with our
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:03.320]  fermented fruit sugars and run that as like a feed if we want to run a little bit longer tea.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:09.080]  Because we don't really run like lengthy times on our teas. We kind of do more of like a,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.760]  yeah, like 18 hours max with alpaca poop. And they're more of a, what's the word?
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.000]  I can't think of the word. You're making fertilizers is what you're doing.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  Yeah. And like extracts, I guess, instead of like full on teas. Because like I said,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.480]  we don't have much microscope knowledge. And the last thing I want to do is brew some shit and
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.880]  cause some havoc in here. So we play on the side of caution with the shorter times and it's,
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.520]  so far it's worked for us. Clearly it's working.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:46.040]  Yeah. So do you bubble after you ferment? We do. So it's an anaerobic ferment. So our theory on it
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.960]  is that we bring back the aerobic properties by mixing it with the poop or compost and run it for
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:58.200]  that anywhere from usually like 10 to 18 hour period. And sometimes the ferment can be a little
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.160]  powerful because it's been sitting for well over a year now. So we've kind of gotten to the point
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.600]  of just sticking to foliar feeding with it. So you're cutting it with water and then just
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.840]  applying it on the plants themselves. Yeah. We dilute it like a thousand times.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.760]  And then it's power. And then veg. Yeah.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:20.760]  Yeah. That was a nugget there, audience. Yeah. It's super powerful. And the longer it ferments,
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.440]  the more powerful it'll be. So for us, less is always more, especially when you're adding
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.520]  shit to soil. It's easier to put more in, but once it's in, good luck. You got to wait that out.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.240]  Yeah. That is powerful advice right there, my friend. Less is more.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.200]  We learn that the hard way.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.440]  Nothing but lessons. Yeah. Nothing but lessons, man.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.640]  That's right. Constant.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:54.960]  Alex, as you continue to progress, have there been some other mentors or books or websites
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.680]  or something that you could give our audience, man? Because I know you were
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.120]  always big on sharing information. Yeah, man. Yeah. A guy that really
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:10.080]  inspired me out here when I first arrived, super cool guy. Honestly, if I can just picture
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:19.440]  Southern Oregon in one individual, it would be the Organarchist on Instagram. And man,
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.080]  he's shown me nothing but love, showed Dana and I nothing but love. When we drove out here,
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:29.920]  we didn't have a place to stay. And the first night we arrived, he let us stay and camp out
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.720]  in his yard and hooked up some heat. He's really a great guy, man. And he taught me a lot about the
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.520]  rabbits. You could check his page out. He really does a lot at his spot. So for the home grower
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.080]  that has got a couple of plants or got an indoor grow and really wants to hone in on the living
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:59.040]  soil and permaculture aspects of it, definitely check him out. That's at Organarchist. He's on
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:04.400]  my page. So he runs blooddiamondseeds.com. Peter threw it up there for you.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.480]  Yeah, check him out, man. Really cool guy. If you're ever in the area, he'd probably even hang
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:21.280]  out with you. So definitely him. And you, buddy, you definitely opened the door for me in a time
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:29.200]  where I felt like a lot of the industry was kind of lagging on this and actually shooting it down
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.040]  on the living soil aspect of growing cannabis and food or whatever, but really cannabis. And
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:43.280]  in the city, the systems that they got going on, they don't really work with it. So a lot of drain
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.520]  the waste. And you opened the door for me mentally. I was like, this is going to happen. This is going
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.160]  to happen. This is going to happen. And I know people are going to catch on. So thank you, man.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:02.320]  Thank you, Brian. And I appreciate you building up the community and helping us all learn. I think
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.960]  that's what we need to do is learn together. We were definitely laughed at when we were first
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.480]  trying to put this together. Yeah. Especially when you talk about reusing your soil. People
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.160]  just thought that's going to run out of gas. You're going to have pH issues, blah, blah, blah,
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:22.720]  blah, blah. Man, we don't pH. Right. I'll just say it again. We don't pH.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:33.040]  Yeah. People are like, oh, you're just like soil nerds and you just really care about soil,
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.840]  not growing fire cannabis and fire flower. And it's like, man, go down that rabbit hole and
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.800]  you'll have the best flower you've ever had. I'll tell you that much. Well, I mean, that's where
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.080]  we're making it really. That's the foundation right there. Yeah. Yeah. And we're trusting the
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.280]  process. Again, that's the biggest issue, especially including myself. When I was coming
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.640]  off of aeroponics way back in the day, I was still flowering out little plants because I was growing
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.360]  in the tent and it was just really hard because you were still used to that kind of income coming
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.080]  in. So to be able to jump full into this, I mean, you guys obviously, Phillip, you've built this from
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.840]  the ground up kind of thing. And here we are again, being able to show the world there's more
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.200]  and more of these farms popping up around the country. And I would imagine around the world.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:32.000]  Yeah. Quality is, is unsurpassed, I believe. So I think anyone that's thinking about it
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.920]  and really wants to take it on, you know, do it if you really want to do it,
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.560]  because it's going to take you for a ride, but it's worth it.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.920]  And this usually took, I mean, especially when we were talking, Alex, I mean, this took years for
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.840]  us to kind of understand the process. And now the beauty of technology, maybe in a silver lining with
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.200]  being shut down is there's a lot more digital media going on right now. There's a lot more
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.320]  people, intelligent people willing to share their secrets, including you guys today. And that's why
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.360]  I feel like this is going to change things as more and more people are on YouTube and that kind of
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:11.040]  thing, sharing what they're doing, showing in real time, their farm. Because a lot of us that started
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.040]  out farming this way or wanted to farm this way, we were trying to learn all this from forums. So
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.760]  we were looking at like maybe a photo or two. And again, sometimes it would take a couple of days
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.520]  to get answers back. You guys are seeing this in real time and I can't emphasize enough of
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.200]  the difference that's going to be for you guys that are newer to this. You're going to, you're
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.000]  going to accelerate through the roof and we're going to have a bunch of Alex's here in a year or
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.680]  two running around, just growing fantastic cannabis, you know, finding their own Phillip and
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.880]  and just creating more opportunities for the living soil community as a whole.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.200]  Yeah. Well said, man.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.640]  And it's beautiful.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.080]  That's the plan. If you want to help people, it's doable.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:50.960]  Yeah.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.000]  You don't need a whole crew of people to get shit done.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.680]  No. And it's beautiful that you guys can come on and show these other guys, the audience,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.480]  that this is achievable, you know?
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.400]  Yeah. And we're transparent. So, you know, if you guys got any questions and you want to reach out
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.360]  and send us a DM, you know, you got, you got your troubleshooting something where this is,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.320]  you know, we live for this. So, you know, reach out. We're, we'll be open to replying and,
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:25.120]  and, and helping you out because it's important, man. Community, this community is, it's everything.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.440]  It's a lot. It takes a village.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:27.840]  It does.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.000]  It can be overwhelming in the beginning stages too. And if you don't have someone that can help
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.280]  you, like, to rock your world real fast, or someone that can even give you a little bit of
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.480]  insight, give you some pep talk, anything, you know, we're here for everyone. And,
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.200]  yeah, the community is what drew us to all this, you know, like there's not very many,
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.760]  many, we feel like communities that, that bond and share knowledge, secrets, you know,
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.360]  fuck ups, mistakes, the way that people that grow in this fashion do. I mean, there's no ego here,
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:02.960]  you know, we'll, we're all inclusive. Like we fucking, we've been through the ringer to get
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.400]  to this point. And we feel like in the beginning, it'd be nice to have people tell us the same
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.000]  shit and not everyone has that. So, I mean, if people got questions like Alex said, or whatever,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.760]  feel free to, to reach out, you know, we may take a little bit getting back to you, but
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.320]  we'll do our best to kind of share and help guide, do, you know, whatever we can to do our part.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.040]  There it is. There it is. And we both had a little Canadian in us. Let's go.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:46.880]  Love it. So, let me ask you this. How long did it take you from the day you walked onto that
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.320]  property to get it, get that greenhouse up and running and your first run?
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.600]  Well, it was my fault. I picked the wrong fucking builder. I'll tell you that from the
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:08.080]  church. Oh shit. That's the only problem with the live garden tours is they're usually out in
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:15.600]  the sticks. Right. Does my audio still suck or? You're fine now. Oh, we're okay. All right. So,
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:20.720]  I've isolated. Oh my God. The beard, the beard's back. Let's go. All right. The wrong button.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.840]  Sorry. Yeah. So, get back to that. I picked the wrong fucking builder essentially. And that was
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.920]  my lesson to learn. There weren't a lot of people building these in Southern Oregon. We didn't have
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.720]  a huge, you know, a huge selection of people. And the people sold me essentially. And it took
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.160]  fucking 18 months for them to put this house up, which is insane. Thankfully, the OLCC took about
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.360]  the same time to get licensed. So, it kind of all worked out. So, it was roughly a year and a half,
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:52.720]  two year process. And then that first round, I only ran two of these beds just to kind of see
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.240]  what I was dealing with on my own. And after that, I was like, fuck, I'm all in. I need another
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.760]  guy out here though because I'll fucking die trying to do it alone. And luckily, like I found someone
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:09.200]  that's not scared of fucking anything. You know what I mean? And here we are. Fuck, I mean, I guess
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.920]  I've been out here four years. He's been here just over a year. And this is, I mean, night and day
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.560]  transformation from the day he stepped out here. Yeah, you guys are killing it for sure.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.360]  Big time.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.360]  Well, that's what happens when you get a first round pick, man, and it comes through.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.000]  The whole organization changes.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.400]  Fucking Jordan right here, dude. Fucking Jordan. There it is. Bobby Boucher right here.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.720]  Yeah, we just have fun. I mean, that's the biggest thing is like, we're growing fucking
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.440]  weed. I'm not trying to have this be some weird controlling tension, like shitty mood. Like,
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.760]  this isn't, I dealt with enough of that shit in my life. And I want this to be nothing but good
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.000]  vibes and good times and happy people, happy plants. You know, these plants are energetic.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.640]  And that's, they can tell when you walk in the room, if you're bringing some shit with you. And
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.280]  we try to just liven everything up everywhere we're at and just bring good vibes. You know
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.520]  what I mean? There's enough shit in the world. We're not trying to continue to cultivate that.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.120]  Layton and I have spoken on that on several shows. And I feel like a lot of people are like,
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.920]  yeah, yeah, whatever. And you might not see it in a tent grow or maybe a smaller basement grow.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:25.680]  But if there is friction, if there is a major issues with your team, you are going to notice
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.760]  that on the commercial level for sure. I mean, if it is the energy. Yeah. That real anger,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.520]  if everybody's walking around and, you know, kudos to the farms that don't have that. Because
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.120]  you can walk into some people's farms like yours. There'd be a lot more people there,
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.440]  but it'd still be happy. There's praying leaves like, wow. All right. From the top down,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.760]  the guys are managing this in the proper manner because the plant is saying so.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.640]  A lot of the times when we come in for consulting, the plants are down. They look sad. And I feel
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.960]  like sometimes it's hard to say, well, it seems like your team hates each other.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.240]  So how do we improve that? No one wants to be that guy, but it's like.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:07.840]  Well, it starts at the top, man. You know, it starts at the top. And so if you are the owner
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.000]  and you're not putting qualified people in play, putting them in over their head,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.200]  they're going to start making mistakes. Everybody's going to start finger pointing
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:24.320]  that turns into a shit show. So, you know. Yeah. And that's the big thing is we're accountable as
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.520]  fuck. You know what I mean? You're pointing the finger at someone. You got a shit ton of them
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.720]  looking back at you. You got to reevaluate your mindset. And like, you know, everyone's capable
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.720]  of fucking up just as everyone's capable of making shit right. So at the end of the day,
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.720]  it's like when one of us fuck something up or does something wrong or we see a problem,
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.720]  like we just jump on that shit together. We put our heads together and it's like.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.640]  We talk it out. Yeah. Talk it out. You know, I say it all the time, but sometimes I feel like I
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:56.800]  spend way more time with Phil than I do with my own wife. It's so true. What's going on here?
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.200]  So, yeah, we talk it out and we work it out. And yeah, sometimes it's not pretty, but
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.440]  it's important to let each other know, let your team know what's going on and then get through it
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.200]  because then it ends up on the plant. You know, we don't figure our things out. We end up sharing
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.360]  it with the plant and we start acting towards the plant and letting it out on the plant. And
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.720]  then at the end, the plant's not happy and then we're not happy. So. And then life sucks ass. You
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.280]  go home and your wife's pissed off because you're pissed. And yeah, it just it revolves, revolves.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.680]  Yeah, we don't have time for that shit. Communication is key. It's not always easy,
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.720]  but it's number one, especially when you're working with other people.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.880]  Have you guys started playing metaphysical music for him yet?
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:48.400]  We play it for ourselves, but mainly. Yeah. We're thinking about it. We talk about all the time. We
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.840]  need to put a big ass speakers and bump some Andre Bocelli and shit in here. You know what I mean?
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:58.560]  Put some classical shit on in here. Yeah. The music's in the life. You know, there's grasshoppers
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:05.600]  and, you know, bugs. And, you know, there's plenty of music in here. You don't need to make noise
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:12.800]  pollution. Now, I really enjoy the birds chirping, the grasshoppers and the crickets and the whole
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.400]  thing of it. Yeah, same here. And like most, you know, we've had people come in here and they're
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.200]  like, oh, you got crickets. You need to get the fuck out of here. They're going to fuck your
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.960]  plants up. And this is and that. There's no damage. I mean, we keep, you know, not to say shit can't
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.600]  get out of balance, but like that's also a part of why we run our cover crops and we have those
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.240]  banker plants. You know, when our cannabis has got that strong health, like they don't want to eat
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.320]  that shit. They'll go for the weak fucking clover, the, you know, the oregano shit like that. And
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.200]  it also tells us early on, like, hey, you got something starting to creep up, like you better
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:53.600]  fix it. So it's, you know, everything in here plays multiple roles and it's everything, you know,
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.280]  kind of tells you something in its own little way. And that's part of what we love about growing
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.720]  this way is we've got a lot of people on our team besides just the living us too. You know what I
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:08.960]  mean? The plants let us know real quick what's going on. Yeah. No, as well. And everything.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.960]  Kudos to you guys for, for allowing that and not being the, the people that freak out when they
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:20.080]  see a bug. It's just, everything's an indicator. Everything's a sign. So yeah, now you're aware
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.920]  that bug is there. Keep an eye out. And if they, you start to see a whole bunch of them, then you
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.800]  got an issue to deal with. But exactly. And that's where we're fortunate enough to have people like
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.360]  Mariah, let me bug her about, Hey, like we found russet mites. What the fuck do I do? You know,
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:38.240]  we're later in flower and I'm not trying to spray shit in here. So she'll break it down for everything
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:44.960]  from plant count to humidity, to heat, night temps, day temps, like, you know, canopies touching,
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.640]  is it not everything? And like, I feel like it's so important to like, reach out and have people
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.640]  that aren't going to bullshit you. Like you were saying earlier, sell you some shit because, Oh,
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.880]  this eats this bug. But like, that doesn't always work that, you know, like environments key.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.000]  And like anyone who hasn't talked to her, like if you need help on IPM, like I suggest you
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.160]  reach out to her today because she's changed our game tenfold. And like, yeah, not just her,
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:15.120]  but everyone in general that that has helped us along the way. I mean, like you said, it takes,
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.280]  it takes a small village to get this shit done. And like, if you got a big ego, you know, you
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.840]  know it all this plan is going to crush your fucking ego. Oh, there's a greenhouse, the ego
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:31.680]  crusher real fast, real fast. Hey, this Kaiser. So say a individual that taught you guys all this
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.400]  stuff. Would he ever want to come on the show if we were able to blur his face or something like
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  that with you guys? I think he'd be doing it. He'd probably wear a mask or some shit, but I think
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:47.520]  he'd be down. Yeah. Cap it up, man. Yeah. He's a good dude. He's super, super knowledgeable. Like
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.560]  one of the nicest people I've met. And like, he loves this plant more than like almost anyone.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.920]  I think I've ever met. And you've been cultivating for a long time and he puts out some insane. So
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:06.240]  I'm sure. Now, you know what? I just saw something in the chat about the cost of setting
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:12.640]  up live in soil. And I just want to make people aware that setting up living soils is actually
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:21.120]  cheaper if you go about it the right way. I set up, I scaled up a 8,000 footer in Colorado for
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:28.480]  like a 10 or less than that of the price of the soil that he was going to buy. It's not hard to
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.440]  do that. It really isn't. You just got to use some intelligence and get outside of the cannabis
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:41.280]  market. Go to landscape companies, go to horticultural places, ag supply. And then these
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.240]  prices are a 10th of what you would pay if you went to, you know, cannabis related.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.560]  Oh, well, if someone asks you if you grow weed or what industry you're in,
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.160]  you shouldn't work with them. I'll be the first to tell you that we've had people.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:58.960]  Fucking double prices. You're telling me you walk in with that beard and you tell somebody that you
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.920]  don't grow cannabis and they look at you with a straight face.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.120]  Oh, true. Well, Southern Oregon is a common shit. So I just tell them I live out in the sticks,
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.720]  especially with COVID. I'm like, I can't go to the barber now. So it's all good now.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.960]  That beard is a commitment. That's as long as growing plants.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.840]  You're right. You're right. But that's why we do it over the phone. They can't see my face.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.880]  Or email. No, what you guys are saying makes total sense. I mean, I feel like a lot of people
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.680]  are kind of foolish with telling, you know, their true intentions with people that have no,
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:39.520]  should be no reason why they need to know that kind of stuff. And I saw that with even the
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.920]  inspectors and that kind of stuff. When I was doing some stuff in Oklahoma, they would come in,
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:49.120]  they're like, oh, this is a cannabis establishment. And then you saw him like run back to his car and
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:54.960]  call someone. To this day, I don't really know if like, as soon as you say that it's like a red
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.640]  flag to certain industries. They're like, hey, we need to double the price here.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.480]  Oh yeah. Start checking everything. And like, it's insane. People gather everything they can.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.920]  People that grow cannabis are like the next millionaire walking down the street,
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:14.320]  just throwing money at them. It's insane. Well, I see all your Gucci stuff on today
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.960]  and it kind of throws us off here. Right?
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.640]  Yeah, get some mud on those t-shirts boys.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.400]  Just quickly, I want to catch up on some of the questions.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.920]  Let me make this bigger. Give me one second. There we go.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:43.540]  Yeah. We get it through our plastic. We run six mil too, and we run double layer,
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:49.700]  but it is diffused. We haven't had any issues on where we're at. Our PAR is on point all day.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.260]  We checked that with the PAR meter yesterday actually, and full sun, we're right there.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:59.940]  We run HBS too. And yeah, we don't have any UV, nothing special in here.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:07.060]  And then can you talk about your trim technique?
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:11.380]  Don't touch the fucking plant for a month after you harvest it. Don't touch it.
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.340]  Hang it up, let it dry for a month here, whatever you want to call it, then trim.
[01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.980]  Don't ever trim it wet. Never, never, never.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.580]  As close to 50-50 as you can.
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.300]  60-60.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:21.940]  60-60.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.900]  Yes. But yeah, always, always dry. You're going to have hay real fast.
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.380]  Chlorophyll smelling plants. And I've been there. Don't do it.
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:37.380]  We don't turn. We do static composting. So we just pile it up, mulch it and water it.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:40.420]  Can you walk us over to the compost pile?
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:42.740]  Is it close?
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:48.420]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was one of our big things was like, how are we going to do this?
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:57.780]  And then based off of reading from Fukuoka, Cho, all them talking about, oh, you can't compost
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:03.060]  because you have to turn it. Then we just started seeing people doing it with, we throw lab curds
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:08.340]  that help speed up the breakdown cycle. We keep just keeping mulch is going to take a little while,
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:14.180]  but pull from the bottom. Don't pull this up off the top. And over time turns to straight humus.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:20.820]  Yeah. I've been static composting forever too. I think it's by far the best way to do it.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.580]  It is. I mean, my back can't handle that. So,
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:28.660]  and I'm not trying to buy a tractor just to turn compost all day. That's.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:32.900]  Yeah. And don't, don't be afraid to make a partially composted tea.
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:37.140]  You know, there's tons of leaf mold in there. It doesn't have to be humus.
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.060]  Exactly.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.540]  Well, you're it's, if it's low temp, it's going to have a ton of biology in it too.
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:54.740]  Exactly. So we throw everything from, Oh, sorry about that. Alpaca manure to cannabis leaf to
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:04.420]  flour to old stocks, a little bit of everything going on in here. Sorry. Let me pull back some
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:10.580]  for you guys. Cause I got a ton of mulch going on in here. And then we just deep mulch. I mean,
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:17.140]  it's hot, hot, hot out here. And and we also throw a bunch of wood in here. So
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:21.700]  let me get this opened up so you guys can see real quick.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.340]  You ever thought of cover cropping it?
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:32.500]  We do. So we got, I mean, you can see the roly polies are working insane, insane. We get wood
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:38.100]  mixed in. And then over time, you know, as you get to that bottom, you know, you got humus all
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.900]  in the bottom, we got leaf mold, we've got all stages. So when it comes to that tea, you know,
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:50.260]  we're all about diversity out here and the more diverse we can get, you know, the better for us.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.220]  You know, this was all plant material a couple months ago.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:00.580]  I love, I love the way you're saying diversity, diversity, man.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:09.060]  That's why they don't have deficiencies, deficiencies, deficiencies, right?
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.700]  Right. Sorry, I didn't mean to over talk. I think there's a lag there.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:21.060]  It's true. I mean, and that's the thing too, when we amend, we don't run one single amendment. Like
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:27.220]  we use a bunch of different shit and it kind of gives us a basis for everything. I mean,
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.620]  we put a probably too much basalt to be honest with you when we first started this mix.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:36.820]  But as it's starting to become available and break down, like we have no mineral deficiencies,
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.380]  everything's there and the plants are happy from day one.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.980]  I know a lot of people do the cliche, you know, Hey, I'm living the dream and all that. But you
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:56.100]  two boys are living the dream, my friend. The fact that you only got to really rely on each
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.460]  other to make sure it gets done and then maybe crack the whip every now and then with the trim
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:05.780]  crew. You guys are, you know, again, it's really where a lot of us aspire to be, you know, is to
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:10.820]  be able to have a little piece of land, in my opinion, have alpacas running all over that.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:15.860]  And then continue to improve that land so that you can pass it on to your children and hopefully
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:21.540]  their children and get back to what was real wealth. When America was first founded, it was
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:27.220]  the farmers and the ranchers that were really creating economic growth.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:28.580]  Exactly.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.540]  Oh, Tyler, that's the dude that sold me these beds.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:36.500]  That's a good dude.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.180]  So let me flip this around for you.
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:46.660]  No, that was wise words, Brian. I mean, it used to be the farmers were the ones with the wealth
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:53.300]  until the farm supply companies came in and Monsanto came in and started screwing them up bad.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:31:00.260]  Exactly. I mean, we see it all day out here. You know, we see dust clouds, all the neighbors
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:07.140]  tilling and shit. And like, it's insane. I mean, the heat from, you know, all this exposed concrete
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:11.380]  essentially is like, it's the climate change is insane. I mean.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:17.300]  You guys understand it. It bare soil heats the fuck up. So if you don't have something there
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:22.420]  to protect it like mulch or hay or chips or a plant.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.460]  Right.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:27.940]  It's fucking cooking and that now you're looking for thermal up currents.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:31.940]  Yeah. And plastic doesn't do the same job.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:35.380]  Yeah. Or do not sink in any carbon. No roots are gone.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.500]  No roots are gone.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:42.500]  Exactly. That's why we buried as much wood as possible outside. And it also kind of offsets
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:48.420]  all the electricity we're burning in here. So it makes me feel a little bit better about having a
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.460]  spaceship as well as something that's regenerating out there.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:58.020]  Yeah. And unfortunately you need a spaceship where you are. Otherwise you're going for one
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:31:58.340]  runner.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.620]  Exactly. And it's hot as fuck. And there's years we get freezes. Two years ago, it froze in the
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:07.700]  middle of September. You're harvesting shit in the middle of September out here, unless you want
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:08.740]  to mature flower.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:15.140]  So yeah, we wouldn't have even the food production we have today without greenhouses. So it's not a
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:18.820]  terrible idea. It helps us. It helps us live.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:25.700]  Tremendously. Yeah. That's what we're shooting for. We're just trying to replicate nature.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:32.020]  I mean, now Tyler had told me that or mentioned on Instagram that these are some of the older
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:37.060]  beds that he has sold. So you guys have consistently had these for the four years?
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:40.820]  Yeah. Non-stop. No soils come out. We just keep adding to it.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:46.420]  So shout out to Tyler and his company because I feel like a lot of the industry really rocks with
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.540]  him and his crew.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:50.980]  Yeah. They're solid ass people. Tyler's a super good dude. He was able to help me out with all
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.540]  this and everything and get this shit done pretty quick for me. They're super good people over
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:55.700]  there.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.020]  Look at that. Four years and you guys are just-
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:03.380]  All right. Tyler, are you satisfied with the money shot?
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.380]  The gratuitous money shot of the grassroots raised beds.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:17.220]  Yeah. Super glad we went with them. It was like a toss up between doing this and wood.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:21.140]  I couldn't be happier with the way that these are turning out, honestly.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.860]  Yeah. They look like they're taking a beating in this bubble.
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.940]  Oh yeah. Had no issues thus far.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:33.180]  So what are you guys-
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.220]  More cowbell.
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.940]  When you guys are moving forward, what are your goals now? Are you going to continue to expand?
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:45.260]  Are you guys going to really just focus on pheno hunting? What are your goals? You're basically a
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.780]  two-man team. I feel like there's going to be a lot of questions for you when we get into the Q&A
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:53.340]  of just management and that kind of stuff. Because again, that's what people really want. They want
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.260]  to be able to manage a farm, especially at the level that you have, one or two, maybe three
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.060]  people. That's the goal.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:07.980]  Yeah. I know it's something we talk about, honestly, I want to say daily, if not weekly,
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:15.180]  at least. I would love for us to have more greenhouses for Alex to be able to run his own
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:20.700]  crew and shit, me to have a crew out here. But it's also, we talk about we don't want to stray
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:26.140]  away from the two-man crew. This was the foundation right here. We're both happy as fuck, but obviously
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:32.460]  expansion is inevitable. I feel like he feels like we want the most we can get for both of
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.220]  our families. We want to give our children and our wives everything that they want.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:44.620]  And people, the opportunity to be a part of this and to really see it to fruition and know that it's
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:50.940]  possible on a large scale in production. That's definitely something that we're looking out for,
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:57.180]  is people of like minds. I think it's important that you team up with people of a similar mindset
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:02.140]  that you can grow together with the same vision. It's really important because when it comes down
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:07.660]  to it, it takes a lot of work and you gotta do everything and everyone's gotta do everything.
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:12.700]  It's not this guy does this and that guy does that. We're all interchangeable. We're all
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:19.980]  cross-utilized and that's the way this ship keeps afloat. And in expansion, that's what we're looking
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:26.540]  for, is people that are gonna enjoy doing this, that are gonna come into work stoked to do this
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:32.940]  kind of work and really grow a great product. And then do you mind explaining, Philip, what
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:40.620]  Lower Left Organics is and why you named your company that? So I'm from the West Coast myself,
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:45.900]  like born and raised. I wanted something to tie into that essentially. And there's too much
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:50.140]  left coast, West Coast shit. So I wanted something that was just a little different, something that
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:55.740]  like would stick, you know what I mean? Something someone wouldn't forget, if that makes sense.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:36:00.300]  So Lower being we're in Southern Oregon, so we're in the lower part of the state and we're on the
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:05.260]  left coast. So it just kind of all went together and we're all about organics, kind of a played
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:10.140]  out word at this point, but we're all about organic, you know, clean process, you know,
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.980]  no salts, no synthetics, no bullshit, you know, trying to get as close as we can to as much closed
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:21.420]  loop shit as we can out here. Everything from food to animals, you know, we're looking to
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:27.260]  incorporate animals for beef, chickens for meat, ducks, everything. We're trying to do it all. You
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:33.980]  know, we're trying to live that children's nursery book in real life, including cannabis, but yeah.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:35.980]  Right on, man.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.700]  Trying to do it all.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.220]  This is definitely, I feel like a lot, especially the newer farmers are going to see this and
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:47.340]  strive to become this because back in the day, again, we would just see a little bit of photos,
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:51.180]  but you guys have been gracious enough to show us, you know, your entire farm A to Z. And
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.860]  we really appreciate that.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.860]  We're stoked to be able to do it. You know, I mean, it's something when he first hired on that
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:00.300]  we talked about wanting to do, we wanted to share our vision and what we do with the people
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:06.700]  and show people like it can work on a slim, you know, a slim crew. If you guys have the
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:12.300]  passion and everything, like you can get it done and not just get it done, but like,
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.660]  yeah, like we feel like, you know, the, the, the quality is unrivaled.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:21.820]  You get to that point. Yeah. It's going to take some time to get there. It's going to take some,
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:26.620]  some stumbling and shit along the way, but I mean, nothing worth having is going to be just
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:27.820]  a walk in the park, you know,
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:29.740]  You got to work to get it.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:35.180]  The fact. And then when it does happen at all, like you said earlier, you know, it's just,
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:40.220]  it's a perpetual wheel. It sustains itself. We just got to put the pieces in play and make sure
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:45.740]  we do our part. But you're not fighting it. And that's the beauty of it. And look what you did
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:50.380]  in four years, man. That's pretty fucking impressive, dude. And honestly, like this,
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:56.620]  this what's going on right now has only been in the last year and a half. That first two years
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:02.060]  was build out and, you know, licensing and county and the state and all that fun shit.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:06.220]  We have only been really playing and having fun for like two years now.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:09.260]  So I can only imagine where we're going. We're not fucking stopping.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:17.020]  Well, we're good. We're definitely going to come back and visit you boys next year.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:22.460]  We'll be here. That's for damn sure. I'd love to have you guys out. If you're ever in Oregon,
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.940]  you swing by for sure. Hey, next time I blast up, I'll definitely swing in and catch up with you
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.460]  boys. Yeah. That'd be cool. Love to do it. Yeah. Be cool.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:38.060]  Nice. So what what is next for you guys after this run?
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.100]  Cows. Fucking cows.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.580]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:53.180]  We're gonna start grazing cat cattle in high density. You know, we don't only have so much
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:39:00.700]  acreage. So we really need to utilize our pasture in a way that can keep it turning over and keep
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:07.100]  producing grass. So we're going to go down that rabbit hole, feeding the livestock in a way that
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:11.980]  will rehabilitate and keep the grass growing instead of just letting the cows out and
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:16.300]  destroying the pasture. You're going to basically like crowd grazing.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:24.380]  That's the plan. Yeah. Yeah. And then feed first our family. And if that progresses, feed the
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:31.260]  Yeah. Yeah. I love you know, I was driving out to work and there's got to be like three families
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:35.820]  that are along the way out of their house just have food stands. You know, they have the food
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:41.420]  there. You got lettuce and eggs and you just show up and it's an honor system. But, you know,
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:49.420]  it's definitely it makes me makes me believe that we can actually build a community that's
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:56.860]  dependent on each other and not on a system that's failing. So I think that it's important that we
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.220]  support that. And, you know, you see someone selling eggs out of their house, you know,
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:06.940]  stop by and drop a few dollars. And usually it's pretty cheap. So you get at the store if you get
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:13.740]  quality eggs. And I challenge everybody that's kind of never bought fresh eggs like that before
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:19.580]  go buy the cheap eggs at Walmart and then go buy the the farmer's market eggs, crack them open and
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:26.060]  look at the yoke. Just go straight to the farmer's market. I mean, if you're a visual person that
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.780]  will you'll spend the extra four bucks or whatever it is. It's true. It's true. The
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:37.180]  quality is unrivaled. Like you can't you can't match stuff that's done with with love, you know,
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.660]  whether it's food, weed, like anything and done with passion done the right way.
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:48.460]  So do you guys want to get into the Q&A? Because I feel like that's going to be the
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:53.980]  fun part. You know, picking your brain, basically. Let's go.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:59.100]  Let's give it a minute, though, because I just
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:05.900]  How many cows you're going to get? And are you buying them? Are you having someone drop them
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:13.740]  off and using them instead? So my neighbor up the way they run Dexter cattle, which is like a small,
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:19.740]  smaller cattle cow, sorry. And they're more beneficial to run on like smaller amounts of
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:24.540]  acreage, which we're kind of dealing with right now. So we're going to get, I think, four and
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.620]  three of them, I believe, are pregnant. So they should be calving sometime in the end of the
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:34.940]  end of the year. And then we just keep breeding and kind of see where it takes us. So those are
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:40.460]  going to be your cows? Yeah, yeah. So we're going to purchase them from them. So are they meat cows
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:46.860]  or milk cows? So meat, essentially. And then you can also get milk from if you want to go that
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:52.700]  route there. I think they said second to Jersey cows in milk production. So they're definitely
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:58.940]  definitely doable. So they're yeah, they get all in one. That's fantastic. Exactly. Keeps my kids
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:04.540]  busy too. Teaches them how to work when they're young. So yes, many benefits, many benefits,
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:09.820]  many benefits. With the right funding, would you guys ever put some bison on that ranch?
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:16.540]  I love bison. I love bison. Yeah, there's a bison ranch out here. They put out amazing meat. So
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:22.780]  I feel like, you know, the sky's the limit, even past, you know, we're just now getting,
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:29.420]  dipping our toes in everything, getting started. Like nothing's, nothing's a no,
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:33.500]  you know what I mean? I can only imagine what that would look like if you have alpacas running
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:39.500]  around and you had bison. Unbelievable. So I don't know if this is a question, but I'll turn it,
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:46.140]  I'll put a question mark on the end of it. Are you doing any soil and sap testing or analysis?
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:53.500]  We don't. Initially I tested my soil when I first started doing this and then
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:01.980]  we just haven't done it since. I mean, we apply little bits of dried amendments consistently
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:07.740]  and haven't seen anything get out of whack. We don't do sap testing. It's something we kind of
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:15.180]  talk about and may do in the future, but as of right now, not much.
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:22.380]  You know, I push testing on people because I think it's really important when you're starting out or
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:28.460]  you don't have, let's say, the years of experience around the plant, because it will give you, it'll
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:33.020]  give you some direction. Like if your chemistry is imbalanced, then you know it's your biology
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:37.260]  or your genetics. If your biology is imbalanced, but you don't know what your chemistry is
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:42.620]  and the plant's having problems, now you kind of go, oh, okay, so it's the chemistry. But
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:48.060]  the guesswork that's required when your plant's not doing well is always helpful. So I still am a
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:52.780]  big proponent of, you know, especially in the beginning, test your soil, find out what you got,
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:58.460]  and then now you know you at least have a baseline or you've amended it to the correct
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:04.060]  proportions. And then you can start focusing on your biology and of course your genetics
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:08.860]  are just as important as well. But one thing I would say is, you know,
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:16.220]  once you get it rolling like you do, you don't really need to test anymore.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:21.100]  The plants are telling you what they need. And from my understanding of your practices,
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.900]  you're doing all the diverse things that you possibly can to keep everything in play, which
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:31.820]  is the way you should be doing it. So kudos. Kudos to you guys for the level you've gotten to.
[01:44:34.110 --> 01:44:41.070]  I mean, we definitely like, we're not ones to like shy away from the testing and say that it's
[01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:45.470]  not necessary. I totally agree with you in the sense of, you know, being able to tell what the
[01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:51.870]  plant's uptaking and all that. But like you kind of said, I mean, the plants kind of tell us the
[01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:58.110]  same thing. I tested my soil, like I said, when we first started, but it was a mix that I had made
[01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:04.430]  myself. So we kind of knew what was in it from jump. I had a little bit of a native in it,
[01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:08.670]  so we tested the native to see what it was bringing to the table. And then, yeah, we've
[01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:15.070]  just kind of continued working it and we haven't had anything pop up since. No wood in here, but
[01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:20.430]  I'm going to knock on wood after saying that so I don't eat my words. But yeah, I mean,
[01:45:21.230 --> 01:45:23.390]  we feel confident moving forward, I guess I should say.
[01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:27.950]  Yeah. Well, look, obviously, you know what the fuck you're doing and you got the
[01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:32.590]  experience of the plant. So just keep fucking doing it, man. Just keep fucking doing it.
[01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:37.310]  Successful flips. That's what was really, you know, you're improving week by week,
[01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:42.270]  month by month, and then year by year. Yeah, fuck yeah, dude. That's the plan. I mean,
[01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:50.350]  every cycle has increased tenfold. And like yield wise, like we're pushing more and more
[01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:55.710]  plant production. We've been doing basically a lot of hunting and genetic selection. Haven't
[01:45:55.710 --> 01:46:00.510]  been too much on focus solely on production. This is going to be one of our first more
[01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:05.310]  of production runs now that we're narrowing down our strains. But our last cycle, which was through
[01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:10.990]  winter with supplemental lighting. And like I said, we ran almost two beds of just straight up
[01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:17.150]  seed and we ran into fucking russet mites. We pulled around 100, just over 100 pounds.
[01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:23.870]  So as we move into production, we'll be seeing, I can imagine, a lot, a lot more.
[01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:28.910]  That was at six plants per bed. And you kind of just answered this question.
[01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:38.350]  We're looking to. That's the plan. We, you know, I love seeds. Alex loves seeds. I know you guys.
[01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:42.430]  We've been kind of bugging each other now that we're kind of getting a good selection.
[01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:48.190]  And I'd love to make in-house shit. I mean, we love, we love finding exotic shit out here.
[01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:52.350]  We like finding the different flavors, the different smells, the stuff that excels in
[01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:57.470]  our area specifically. Do you mind shouting out some of the breeders that you feel like
[01:46:58.430 --> 01:47:02.670]  at the commercial setting that you don't mind doing that? Because I feel like a lot of the
[01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:09.790]  newer farmers, they get scammed so easily. Yeah. So we work with. Canerado's got some solid shit
[01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:14.750]  Canerado's got some solid shit that we're working with. We're working with some stuff from Sin City.
[01:47:15.630 --> 01:47:24.590]  We're working with stuff from Organarchist, his boy. We're working with this truck stop.
[01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:29.950]  It's going to be some crazy shit coming out of that. My buddy Marley is actually just kind of
[01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:37.630]  starting to do a little bit of stuff here and there. He's his Instagram's a.y.special.
[01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:44.670]  He's going to be looking at kind of doing his thing. Boston Root Seed Company. We've got one
[01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:50.430]  of his chemistries that we found. He's doing some good shit. It's your banger crosses are crazy.
[01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:57.950]  Who else are we working with? Skunk House.
[01:47:57.950 --> 01:48:02.910]  Oh, Skunk House. Yeah, we got some some shit from Skunk House. Their shit's always on point.
[01:48:03.630 --> 01:48:11.470]  Who else? That's kind of it for now. We work with a lot of like local people, too.
[01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:16.910]  We got friends that give us beans and stuff. We're working with some Chemdelechem F3
[01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:21.070]  actually that came out of Colorado. I don't know exactly who bred it. It's an F3.
[01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:25.390]  But we're going to be possibly looking at keeping the mail from that and just doing
[01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:29.070]  some in-house shit. We're not trying to become some huge seed company or anything. We just
[01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:30.190]  want to make our own flavors.
[01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:36.910]  You guys got to get some runs then, man.
[01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:45.870]  Shout out to Michael Hinton and Brianna Hinton.
[01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:51.630]  Oh, runs, runs. Are you talking about runs or run tea plants?
[01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:53.790]  He's talking about runs from.
[01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:55.070]  Yeah, modern epigenetics.
[01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:03.070]  She's doing another project right now. I think she's going to have it ready
[01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:05.870]  in some time this fall. Maybe get something for a winter run.
[01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:08.190]  She's doing some really nice work.
[01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:15.630]  I was thinking about run tea plants. Sometimes you find them in seeds. It's just not the chosen ones.
[01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:17.150]  No, exactly.
[01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:24.030]  Not for the market, but for yourselves. What do you guys like smoking?
[01:49:26.110 --> 01:49:31.470]  We got some unnamed shit. We call them by their numbers. We got the number nine,
[01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:40.510]  the number 14, the number 17, the eight. Nilla Wafer actually that was from Colorado.
[01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:41.950]  That's my favorite right now.
[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:43.070]  Wedding Cake to Great.
[01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:44.430]  Sunday Driver.
[01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:45.470]  Sunday Driver. That's right.
[01:49:46.190 --> 01:49:52.750]  Wedding Cake to Sunday Driver. So frosty. It's just grease. You break up the flour and it melts
[01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:55.790]  on your fingers. It's like GMO. It's crazy.
[01:49:55.790 --> 01:50:01.870]  And the chemistry from Boston smokes real well. The flavor's insane. The smell's insane. It's
[01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:02.430]  super loud.
[01:50:02.430 --> 01:50:03.310]  That's our motor breath.
[01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:05.150]  Yeah, motor breath to Headbanger.
[01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:10.990]  And the silk, straight like cereal milk.
[01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:12.990]  Yeah, some good shit.
[01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:14.990]  Yeah.
[01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:20.430]  The question marks, they're like a seeded run from a buddy.
[01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:21.950]  Yeah, some bag seeded.
[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:22.510]  Some bag seeded.
[01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:26.510]  We're finding some crazy shit my buddy Marley gave to us to run last winter. And we found
[01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:30.990]  about seven or eight possible keepers we're going to be running back through. And they're
[01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:34.030]  going to be some good shit coming out of those for sure.
[01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:38.910]  Now, are you guys strictly selling your flour or are you having it made into
[01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:40.270]  other products?
[01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:49.870]  Well, we worked with some people with hash. We're not big fans of BHO solely based on
[01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:56.190]  like butane, pentane, et cetera. We like the way that we cultivate to be expressed into
[01:50:56.190 --> 01:51:03.870]  hash. We work with a couple of people out here. My mind just went blank.
[01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:05.310]  So was they doing wash?
[01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:06.030]  What's that?
[01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:07.310]  They do wash, ice water?
[01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.870]  Yeah.
[01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:13.870]  Yeah. Yeah. So we do it. We froze, we freeze the plant here and then we got it out to two
[01:51:13.870 --> 01:51:15.150]  people that make hash out here.
[01:51:15.150 --> 01:51:15.630]  Yeah.
[01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:20.830]  You want to shout those guys out so that you can continue to get your work out there?
[01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:24.990]  Yeah. There's the dude, Boze Knows Knows, BNK Solvenless.
[01:51:24.990 --> 01:51:26.990]  Great name by the way.
[01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:35.230]  Yeah. And then the other dude is, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:36.270]  know.
[01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:42.350]  Yeah. Happy Hippie. They do like that old school hash shit. So they've been doing some
[01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:44.910]  of that shit with our stuff. And then-
[01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:49.070]  When you say old school, are you saying like Frenchie cannoli kind of stuff?
[01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:50.030]  Yeah. That type of shit.
[01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:51.230]  Temple ball?
[01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:52.110]  Yeah.
[01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:52.670]  Yeah.
[01:51:52.670 --> 01:51:52.990]  Yeah.
[01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.790]  Yeah.
[01:51:53.790 --> 01:52:00.830]  So many different styles. It's pretty cool. But we really like the ice water hash method
[01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:08.830]  and rosin's cool. And it's just so it's such an art. I wish we had more time to do
[01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:14.510]  that ourselves, but we don't. We're really taken up with nurturing the plant.
[01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:21.710]  Yeah. From now on, like our flowers sold. So, I mean, it's gone. Prices are looking
[01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:27.150]  good. So, I mean, we're moving flower from now on, at least unless something pops up,
[01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:32.910]  we're not totally closed minded, but we're able to move some packs out here.
[01:52:33.710 --> 01:52:37.950]  There were even some people last week that were trying to tell me that Oregon market is this and
[01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:43.710]  that. And I feel like it may be that way unless you're cultivating cannabis that people want.
[01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:48.110]  It can get ugly, dude. I mean, I know a lot of people sit on a lot of weight.
[01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:54.190]  A lot of people are shitty people and there's bad relationships with people. People burn bridges and
[01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:58.350]  we're not ones to do that. I mean, it's not a big state. You know, word travels fast out here
[01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:07.390]  and quality speaks volumes. I mean, I feel any market quality is going to move. And if you take
[01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:13.230]  care of what you do, take pride in what you do and you're pushing out quality, quality flower
[01:53:13.230 --> 01:53:17.230]  or extracts, whatever it may be like it's moving. It's moving.
[01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:18.430]  It's moving.
[01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:25.950]  Yeah. I mean, quality. I mean, even when things happen with the economy and stuff like that,
[01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:29.230]  there's still Mercedes Benz being purchased and stuff. I think people still,
[01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:34.830]  if they have the money, they're still going to enjoy it. Well said, man.
[01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:35.630]  Right?
[01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:40.270]  Yeah. My mom used to have a thing on the wall when I was growing up and said, life's too short for
[01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:44.750]  cheap wine. And I feel like I need to put that, except obviously with cannabis on there. Cause
[01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:49.630]  that's definitely my life. Life is too short to sit there and try to smoke the stuff that we used
[01:53:49.630 --> 01:53:57.150]  to search through in Georgia with which seeds and stems and press bricks basically.
[01:53:57.150 --> 01:54:01.230]  Right? Nah, we don't have to go through that. It'll do type shit anymore.
[01:54:02.190 --> 01:54:06.110]  I feel like we're old timers when we talk like that. You guys don't even know what it was like.
[01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:11.470]  We had to call 12 people sometimes to try to get just brick weight.
[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:13.070]  Now you know what I feel like, dude.
[01:54:15.710 --> 01:54:19.630]  Okay. So someone in the chat wanted to know where to get that run stream. It's
[01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:27.150]  modern epigenetics on Instagram or on, and you guys, I have got the scoot. I got to get back
[01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:32.350]  to that job. So unfortunately I got to bail on you, but it was much love and respect. The work
[01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:38.430]  you're doing is fantastic. You know, really appreciate it. And again, we'll have you back
[01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:41.470]  next year, same bad time and see what you got doing. All right.
[01:54:42.270 --> 01:54:46.670]  On to bigger and better, man. Appreciate your time and hope you enjoy the rest of your week here.
[01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:50.190]  All right. Thank you guys. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Brian. I'll catch up with you guys later.
[01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:53.710]  Peace out. Later, man.
[01:54:53.710 --> 01:54:58.750]  Later. And just quickly, there's the modern epigenetics.
[01:54:59.470 --> 01:55:03.630]  I'll get that apple drip. Yeah, that sold out immediately.
[01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:10.350]  Did it? Yeah. I mean, there's certain genetics that just, and breeders that I feel like,
[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:13.630]  I just want the community to start to grow more of their genetics.
[01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:20.190]  Took me four years. Patience. But yeah, I agree with you. Like genetics are everything to us.
[01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:24.350]  And like, we love searching through genetics, like finding, it sucks when you run through,
[01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:28.430]  you know, hundreds of seas and you don't find shit, but it's all part of the game.
[01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:34.670]  Yeah. And just a correction in the chat. Yeah, you are right, Ricky, Bobby, they did not breed
[01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:40.270]  runts, nor do they claim that they bred runts in any way, shape or form. That was just a
[01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:50.330]  misstatement by Leighton. I think, yeah, I think we talked about that. So if we misspoke on that,
[01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:56.650]  then that's, we apologize. So many genetics out there, it's hard to keep track of who's
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:56:03.690]  actually doing what or force collabs, as I heard it was called. That part's kind of funny to me.
[01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:09.050]  Yeah, people are moving and shaking. The force collab, Peter. Right.
[01:56:14.890 --> 01:56:20.890]  Yeah. Any other questions from the chat? And while we're waiting, we got Chad Westport,
[01:56:20.890 --> 01:56:28.010]  today's Thursday. On Saturday at two, we got James Loud, Sunday at 11.
[01:56:28.730 --> 01:56:31.850]  That's all in the Pacific time zone.
[01:56:36.330 --> 01:56:39.610]  People are talking about apple. I like the apple.
[01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:47.290]  Doc Ray sent me a bunch of stuff that has apple in it, and it's delicious.
[01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:52.810]  Do you guys like smoking hash? Are you more flour? I'm a flour person myself.
[01:56:53.930 --> 01:57:01.450]  We got the hash. I do. Yeah. Okay. And what flavors do you like in your hash?
[01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:08.890]  The crazier it can get, the better it is. I mean, I love, you know, I love, I love tasting
[01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:15.130]  that, you know, definitely has got to have a gas background. And then if it can venture off into,
[01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:21.530]  venture off into, you know, floral, creamy, candy notes with the gas and the musk,
[01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:28.570]  got to have musk and, you know, the raunchier, the better. So it's like, you know, for artists,
[01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:35.370]  I think it's really cool when I see a product that includes all of those terpene profiles and
[01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:40.330]  flavors. And I know that ice water hash has the potential to capture all of that.
[01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:47.050]  So I'm definitely, you know, I'd love to do, I'd love to do that. I'd love to try that and make
[01:57:47.050 --> 01:57:54.410]  that because my background is in culinary. So yeah, taste is everything, right? Facts.
[01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:59.690]  Weed that tastes like shit's not worth growing. Do you see this one? Have you, have you noticed
[01:57:59.690 --> 01:58:07.210]  any dudding or plants that are kind of struggling? We've got, I don't like, I mean, we had struggling,
[01:58:07.210 --> 01:58:14.010]  but it was from Russet mites. We restart our mothers in the sun that regenerates the fuck out
[01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:19.290]  of the plant we feel. And then we also grow with the sun in the greenhouse. So our cuts are vibrant
[01:58:19.290 --> 01:58:23.450]  and live as fuck. We haven't run into it yet and I'm crossing my fingers and hoping we don't.
[01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:29.370]  But I just have a feeling that keeping your soil with the proper moisture levels and
[01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:37.050]  light activity, just keep everything in balance all the time will prevent things like that from
[01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:43.290]  getting crossed over into the plant. Because the stronger the plant, the less potential it has for
[01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:52.490]  being infected. Strategies for breaking up soil, compacted soil. Do you see that one right there?
[01:58:52.490 --> 01:59:02.890]  So besides the daikon. So mulch, mulch, mulch and teas get life in that soil and try to keep it
[01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:10.970]  live as long as possible. Compost, you know, that organic matter is critical. Manure, like manure is
[01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:18.490]  fucking life. And I mean, we broke up a bunch of it by doing hugels. So, you know, we literally dug
[01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:25.290]  it up and flipped it and that broke it up a little bit. That initial breakup and then just don't let
[01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:30.650]  it harden back up ideally and don't let it turn back into that concrete. And then just keeping it
[01:59:30.650 --> 01:59:38.970]  alive and mulched is critical. Are you guys adding rove beetles and that kind of stuff? Are you
[01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:43.690]  are you doing nematodes in the soil system? I feel like the nematodes are in the compost.
[01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:48.730]  Rove beetles are like, they're kind of always around. They're always in the manure. They come
[01:59:48.730 --> 01:59:54.250]  through our teas. Yeah, we do. We like sunflowers on the back end of the beds, which we're looking
[01:59:54.250 --> 02:00:01.130]  to do this year, too. They bring a lot of beneficial insects, too. And the taproot's insane. So it mines
[02:00:01.130 --> 02:00:07.530]  the soil for a shit ton of nutrients. But we use rove beetles. Yeah, they're critical in
[02:00:07.530 --> 02:00:12.730]  keeping the pests and everything in the soil. Keeping a cover crop and then chopping and dropping
[02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:18.410]  as it grows. And it's just constantly, you know, the roots are constantly keeping the
[02:00:18.570 --> 02:00:25.930]  soil aerated and broken up and alive. So, yeah, cover crop, all sorts of grass, flower, you know,
[02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:31.210]  whatever you can get your hands on. Diversity. Diversity. You got shallow roots, deep roots,
[02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:40.490]  fat roots, skinny roots. You need it all. Everything has a purpose. Exactly.
[02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:44.410]  Guillermo is coming late to the conversation, but...
[02:00:44.490 --> 02:00:51.210]  Everything. Oh, yeah. Yeah, everything's on site. Oh, yeah. We can show you the some of the
[02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:57.130]  anaerobic shit we got going on right now, actually. So we make our own compost. We make our own
[02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:04.250]  ferments. We do top dress. So that's the one thing that I guess you could say. We use neem,
[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:15.610]  tarranja, crabmeal, oyster, gypsum, basalt and kelp. It's like our go-to. And then as we go into
[02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:21.930]  transition, fish, bone meal and grass. And other than that, it's all teas and teas and ferments,
[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:31.380]  essentially. And then Tyler, who also came evidently late to the conversation, in those
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:38.500]  amazing grassroot fabric pot raised beds, your irrigation, you basically have the lines with the
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:43.940]  emitters, right? Yeah. And then we got let me show you real quick. We also do.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:49.380]  So this is another one of those barley teas. We'll be running six,
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:54.340]  seven hundred and fifty gallons of this today. I guess we aerate that for about three hours.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:59.460]  I'll show you here. We just grind it up in a blender, get a nice
[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:07.300]  mixture of powders and little chunks, throw it in there, aerate it, mix it up by hand.
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:13.060]  And then we run emitters right here, Tyler. And we got two of those per bed.
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:17.460]  So we got one line there and then we got the other line here.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:21.620]  And then this is our fruit ferment that we got going right here.
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:34.820]  In the rain barrels. Yeah. So this has been sitting here now. Yeah. A bunch of plums,
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:39.540]  bunch of plums, plums, apples, pears,
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:46.580]  horsetail and spent ganja flower. That's about it for that one.
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:53.540]  And that's what we use to feed our teas and flour to feed the microbes or sugar. Yeah. Sugar source
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:03:02.340]  versus using molasses or anything is to kind of feed everything. And then this is our tea that
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:11.140]  we earn our tea, our ferment that we run through and for the mothers. So we got all kinds of color
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:19.940]  going on in here, all kinds of stages. And we dilute this heavy, heavy, heavy because this
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:25.860]  shit's powerful. Yeah. That K&F solutions apps, a lifesaver that'll let you know dilution rates
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:30.580]  based on how many gallons you're running. K&F solutions. I've never heard of that.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:37.940]  Yeah. It's a dude, Drake, Drake from Hawaii. What's the dude's name? K&F Hawaii or something.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:42.260]  Yeah. Isn't it? Yeah. I don't think he's on Instagram anymore though.
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:48.820]  Ah, there you go. So yeah, there's an app that he, he put out and it's like two, three bucks or some
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:54.020]  shit. And it just basically gives you everything you need. You just put in what we use. Well,
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:04:02.260]  we interchange this with an FPJ, but yeah. So we use ferments in veg, we do two to three.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.580]  Just quickly, what, what are your dilution ratios and how often?
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:11.620]  One to 1000. So it's one to 1000. So it's about four milliliters per gallon.
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:18.100]  And then we do it two to three times a week in veg. And then we'll do it in a transition until
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:23.060]  bud sets with the flower, with the fruit one. And then that's kind of it right there.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.120]  Easy enough for two men to run the entire operation.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.360]  That was a brilliant. We wanted to keep it simple.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:43.560]  And then do you, do you see the green mulch or wood chips? Both separate, why?
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:52.680]  So we use wood chips in here in winter and got an insane influx of roly-polies. So took all the
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:05:00.520]  wood chips out. We have them outside lining all of our walkways and anywhere that there was dirt.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:07.960]  And then that helps kind of stimulate that fungal network outside for us,
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.800]  helps suppress some weeds and some grasses from growing too crazy.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:18.520]  We do lots of green mulch. We chop and drop. Learning that, that carbon to nitrogen,
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:27.880]  carbon to nitrogen ratio is pretty important. So yeah, you need that glue. Exactly.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:33.320]  So we do a little bit of everything outside. We love wood because there's predators for roly-polies.
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.240]  Inside, I'm kind of over pulling them out by hand. And once we pulled the wood chips out and kind of
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:45.880]  got back to balancing that soil, we, yeah, it hasn't been as much of an issue for us anymore.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:57.460]  Can you make Chad Westport's dreams come true? Yeah. Is he in Oregon? He is further north.
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:02.580]  That's a dope logo, Chad. Yeah, Chad is. Appreciate that though. Thank you.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:08.730]  Yeah. And then here's a point you guys can talk on.
[02:06:10.090 --> 02:06:14.570]  Yeah. That was in response to someone asking what you need to do with the poop.
[02:06:14.890 --> 02:06:19.770]  Yeah. So that was our biggest benefit in wanting the alpaca specifically. I know Alex has his
[02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:24.650]  reasonings for the rabbits, but we don't have to wait to compost it. We can literally catch
[02:06:24.650 --> 02:06:29.610]  the poop right out there, backside for lack of a better term, and put it straight into water.
[02:06:29.610 --> 02:06:33.210]  And you, or you can top dress it immediately. It's cold. It's not hot. It won't burn your plants.
[02:06:34.570 --> 02:06:40.810]  And yeah, it's very low NPK ratio. So it's not super, super heavy on the nutrients,
[02:06:41.770 --> 02:06:46.890]  but it's full of life and bacteria. And if you do have the rabbits, you can still use the rabbits
[02:06:46.890 --> 02:06:51.370]  cold, you know, it's a cold manure. So you can, and especially when it's been sitting with some,
[02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:55.290]  some, even if it's sitting with your mulch and inter, you know, intermixed,
[02:06:55.290 --> 02:07:00.970]  you can still put that in the teabag and bubble it for 18 hours. And you're, you're, you're good.
[02:07:03.210 --> 02:07:06.730]  Cold manures, especially if you're a newer farmer, those are the ones you want to mess
[02:07:06.730 --> 02:07:10.170]  around with. Chicken manures and all that kind of stuff. I don't know if you're new to it,
[02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:14.810]  I would just get you a little rabbit. Yeah. Let it sit. If you're going to use it,
[02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:19.850]  spray labs on it, mix lab curds in there, and that'll help speed up the breakdown process too.
[02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:26.250]  Chad just wants to let you guys know that he's willing to come down. Let's go.
[02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:31.610]  We're friendly people down here, even though we live in the middle of nowhere.
[02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:41.890]  Now we appreciate that a lot, man. Thank you. Those girls are happy. Definitely.
[02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:46.850]  Soon as the sun gets past that damn tree right there, they'll be straight up in the air.
[02:07:48.850 --> 02:07:53.010]  But yeah, we're stoked. They're stoked. Everything's going well.
[02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:58.770]  I wish more owner operators would be able to see this.
[02:07:59.650 --> 02:08:03.010]  Appreciate that, man. I felt like that was a necessity in wanting to do this.
[02:08:03.650 --> 02:08:08.850]  Plus I love it just as much as the next guy does. So it only made sense.
[02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:19.970]  Chad's Oregon road trip is starting to come together here. There it is. Other people,
[02:08:20.770 --> 02:08:26.130]  inviting them over. Connecting everybody. That's what we love about this plant too,
[02:08:26.130 --> 02:08:32.370]  is all walks of life come together from this. You've got people from everywhere in the world,
[02:08:32.370 --> 02:08:35.250]  all types of different backgrounds, and this plant unifies them
[02:08:36.050 --> 02:08:37.810]  a way that I haven't seen anything else do.
[02:08:38.290 --> 02:08:44.170]  Proud of you, Alex. Kill it, buddy.
[02:08:44.170 --> 02:08:50.410]  Thanks, Brian. This is... Yeah, it's passion, it's drive, but if you got it,
[02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:54.490]  you can handle it. Just grab the deer by the horns.
[02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:03.930]  People in the chat are going deep on different types of poop. So deer poop, is that...
[02:09:04.890 --> 02:09:05.450]  It's cold.
[02:09:05.450 --> 02:09:09.850]  Yeah, I was going to say it's probably not that hot. Goose would be a good idea.
[02:09:10.730 --> 02:09:13.370]  Goose would be hot, right? Any sort of bird?
[02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:18.090]  A lot of like pellets. I think that's a pretty safe bet that it's cool. I think it's when it's
[02:09:18.090 --> 02:09:24.570]  splatty or like pie-ish, if that makes sense. You want to let that sit. When they're the little
[02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:27.050]  pebbles, little pellets, they're usually pretty good to go.
[02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:32.890]  Bison is a cold manure as well, but pretty hard for you to have a bison.
[02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:35.930]  Right? Just in your backyard.
[02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:41.450]  Yeah. But cold manure is where it's at. If you're a newer farmer, you're making tees,
[02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:45.050]  you want to play around with this. You see, obviously, where it can take you.
[02:09:45.610 --> 02:09:46.970]  Play around with the cold manures.
[02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:53.290]  That's where it's at. Especially when you're cultivating like in this style.
[02:09:53.930 --> 02:09:59.530]  Like you're missing the boat if you don't have manure somewhere in your setup, which I learned
[02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:00.410]  that as well.
[02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:05.370]  And if you love vermicomposting, alpaca manure, they love to eat that.
[02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:08.010]  They go insane for it. Yeah. Insane.
[02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:09.930]  We'll open up pockets.
[02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:10.650]  Same with the rabbit.
[02:10:11.290 --> 02:10:14.970]  Oh yeah. We open up pockets to make tees and they're just loaded with worms.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.620]  Beautiful work.
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.420]  Appreciate it, man. It's a lot of fun out here. I can't lie.
[02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:41.740]  Like Leighton said, man, it'd be cool to see you guys next year and see what a farm can really do
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:45.740]  after another full year with you and Alex at the helm.
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:48.620]  Dude, we're super, super stoked for the future too.
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:53.500]  And I feel like we're kind of, like you were saying, getting our stride going this year.
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:57.260]  And we're looking forward to pushing shit to new heights in all aspects.
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:03.180]  Got some glide in your stride.
[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:05.980]  That's right. That's right.
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:09.580]  Now, do you trim up the skirts or anything?
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:11.820]  Yeah. So we keep everything.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.000]  Yeah.
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:17.500]  Right on. Yeah.
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:23.180]  And then today, day 21, we're going to start doing that defoliation for the day 21.
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:25.580]  Get all those suckers up out of there.
[02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:29.740]  One of the potatoes that we were using for the pulley took off.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:31.420]  Yeah. We've got a rogue sweet potato in here.
[02:11:32.860 --> 02:11:36.460]  A little bit of etch, some grass, some dichondra.
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.380]  A little bit of everything.
[02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:46.460]  My potato keeps boxing other stuff out. I always have to cut it back.
[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:48.460]  That's what we're worried about. I've never grown a potato.
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.740]  So we're going to find out here soon.
[02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:55.820]  This is excellent, man. When people ask me, I'll be able to say
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:59.820]  someone besides Steensland and Steve Cantwell.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:03.820]  What about Phillip and Alex out in Southern Oregon?
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:05.180]  Damn, dude. I appreciate that a lot.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:08.940]  Yeah, man. You guys are building up that forest on the floor.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:13.260]  That's what we're shooting for.
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:17.340]  That's what we were both kind of taught by the people that kind of influenced both of us,
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:20.380]  I feel like. You can run into issues, don't get me wrong.
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:26.460]  The forest can be a fucked up place, but it can also be a place of bliss and health
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:28.780]  if you can maneuver the waters.
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.700]  Wow, that's quite a statement there.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:35.740]  Yeah, right on.
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:39.500]  Damn, dude. I appreciate that a lot, dude. Thank you.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:42.140]  Or I shouldn't say dude. I'm not sure if you're a man or woman.
[02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:43.420]  Thank you. I should say.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:44.300]  He is a man.
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:46.780]  Handshake. Don't touch. No machine. No machines.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.220]  Everything's taken care of by hand.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:55.180]  We start in veg. So we start shaping plants early.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:57.740]  This round, we played around with a little more topping.
[02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:01.500]  And we're just shooting for more tops, more tops, more tops.
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:05.820]  And yeah, we start cleaning up from veg, shaping plants early
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:10.060]  because we found, which still happens, they can get out of hand very quickly.
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:11.020]  Yes.
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:11.820]  Did you see that one?
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.100]  Yes. Not too much.
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:13.580]  Or up mostly.
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:17.420]  Yeah. So we mulch a little bit, not too much.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.260]  And then a lot of it goes back into the compost outside.
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:28.070]  So yeah, you'll see. I mean, with the influx that we had of roly polies,
[02:13:28.070 --> 02:13:30.870]  like they were breaking stuff down at an insane pace.
[02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:34.310]  So we've been chopping and dropping a little more here and there.
[02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:37.990]  But yeah, we just want to keep them off the plant.
[02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:41.030]  So we want to keep them happy and they keep us happy.
[02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:44.790]  And then I know you guys answered this before,
[02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:47.510]  but we've gotten the same question a couple of times.
[02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:49.910]  Yeah. So we're playing around with spacing right now.
[02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:54.550]  I'd stay independent from what we're dealing with anywhere from six to nine to 12.
[02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:55.990]  And we're in a four by four bed.
[02:13:56.550 --> 02:14:01.510]  So anywhere from every square foot to every
[02:14:04.150 --> 02:14:06.710]  one foot spacing to one and a half foot, I should say.
[02:14:06.710 --> 02:14:07.210]  Sorry.
[02:14:08.170 --> 02:14:11.050]  Can you go down to the roots and just show us kind of the...
[02:14:11.690 --> 02:14:12.190]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:17.210]  So this would be...
[02:14:17.210 --> 02:14:23.610]  And you had stocks kind of about ready to just go back into the soil there.
[02:14:23.610 --> 02:14:24.410]  That's from last.
[02:14:25.530 --> 02:14:27.210]  So that'll get fed back.
[02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:29.290]  And then this is a six space right here.
[02:14:32.170 --> 02:14:35.370]  So this plant specifically pushes out insane laterals.
[02:14:35.370 --> 02:14:37.610]  So we're probably going to push this to around nine.
[02:14:37.610 --> 02:14:40.410]  Twelve would be a little too packed, I would think.
[02:14:41.210 --> 02:14:45.690]  And then you see what else we've got here.
[02:14:45.690 --> 02:14:49.450]  Twelve just seems hard to manage with the vigorous plants.
[02:14:49.450 --> 02:14:50.250]  It can be.
[02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:51.690]  Where nine seems to be...
[02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:54.170]  If that's what people are asking, what's the sweet spot?
[02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:56.170]  I would say nine if you're a beginner.
[02:14:56.170 --> 02:14:59.290]  Yeah. Like twelve is a lot of damn work.
[02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:01.610]  I mean, we prune insanely.
[02:15:02.170 --> 02:15:03.370]  This would be close.
[02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:05.930]  I think this one is...
[02:15:07.290 --> 02:15:09.050]  Here's seven or eight.
[02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:10.730]  Eight on this one.
[02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:15.050]  So yeah, we could definitely stick one in the center there.
[02:15:15.050 --> 02:15:18.010]  But this plant doesn't put out much lateral growth.
[02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:20.810]  So this is when we're going to look at stuffing a little more
[02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:22.650]  to really throw this canopy out next round.
[02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:25.850]  And it's just something that like genetics, you got to learn
[02:15:26.490 --> 02:15:29.210]  as you run through your strains, you know how some react.
[02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:32.490]  Like this plant specifically puts out mass lateral branching.
[02:15:32.490 --> 02:15:34.810]  So it's easy to work the sides and the lowers up.
[02:15:35.370 --> 02:15:39.210]  Where some of this other stuff wants to stay that stick dead center.
[02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:45.200]  So yeah, we've dealt with PM for sure.
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:47.680]  We've had de-hues dying here in late flower.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:50.480]  We've had fucked up hygrometers.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:52.880]  We've dealt with it all.
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:56.080]  Everything.
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:15:56.960]  And it happens.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:58.400]  I mean, it's a living plant.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:15:59.360]  We've got wet wall.
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:00.960]  There's mass amounts of moisture.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.440]  Airflow is critical.
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:08.800]  Having multiple humidistats so you know if and where you have your micro climates are at.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:12.160]  Because we've had spots that were 20% higher than what we were measuring.
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:19.280]  You just got to stay on top of your, on top of your, mainly shooting for BPD, chasing BPD.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.480]  It's not always 100% achievable for us in here.
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:25.040]  But it's something that you can kind of get as a baseline.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:29.520]  And watching those swings at night, making sure everything stays
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.920]  not too, too cold, not too, too hot.
[02:16:41.710 --> 02:16:44.590]  I'm glad people can see this on the commercial level.
[02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:48.190]  Because like I said, man, when we were talking about this five years ago,
[02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:51.790]  this seemed like a pipe dream for 99% of the people that we were talking to.
[02:16:54.350 --> 02:16:56.270]  Dude, yeah, Antoine, you're fucking crazy.
[02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:57.550]  What the fuck are you doing?
[02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:58.670]  Where's your pH meter?
[02:16:58.670 --> 02:16:59.950]  I was losing hope too.
[02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:03.710]  There was some places, you know, prior to working with Phillip, I worked at Other Grows.
[02:17:03.710 --> 02:17:07.630]  And they were trying and, you know, we weren't succeeding.
[02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:10.830]  But, you know, it just takes dialing in.
[02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:14.750]  It takes going through the ringer and figure out why.
[02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:20.910]  And not just guessing, but really getting down to it and running it again.
[02:17:20.910 --> 02:17:26.030]  And whether, you know, looking out for the same problems or, you know, a new problem arises.
[02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:31.070]  And, you know, taking that challenge on can get you to stability, can get you to that
[02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:33.390]  homeostasis that you're looking for in this kind of system.
[02:17:34.430 --> 02:17:38.030]  And you boys are clearly putting in the work because the plants would not look like this
[02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:39.470]  without putting in the work.
[02:17:39.470 --> 02:17:43.390]  I mean, it's really hard to achieve praying leaves.
[02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:46.910]  That was one of the main things when we would first talk to the students is like, this is
[02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:47.390]  your goal.
[02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:53.070]  And that was just like, you know, trying to teach them one 20-gallon fabric pot.
[02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:59.950]  To be able to achieve this on the commercial level is awe-inspiring, especially for a lot
[02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:01.150]  of those that are newer to this.
[02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:05.870]  So I know we're just sitting here watching your plants, but this is something that I
[02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:10.990]  feel like, you know, challenge of yours at home, spot a deficiency.
[02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:13.550]  You know, this is something that these boys are managing as well.
[02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:16.110]  They're not really sitting here being farmer anymore.
[02:18:16.110 --> 02:18:19.950]  They're more like being coach or mentor, just making sure that the system is running.
[02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:24.910]  And once that system is running, then Alex and Phillip can concentrate on pheno hunting
[02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:30.990]  or improving veg growth or just improving the overall canopy, that kind of stuff.
[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:34.910]  You have a lot more time to focus on other more important things.
[02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:36.830]  I agree 100%.
[02:18:37.390 --> 02:18:40.670]  And you'll see, I mean, you know, we'll find predators.
[02:18:40.670 --> 02:18:45.230]  I don't know if this will focus enough for you, but the Oreos we were talking about earlier.
[02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:50.510]  Back it up a tiny bit, just back the camera up to like two or three feet away.
[02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:51.630]  Okay.
[02:18:52.350 --> 02:18:52.590]  Yeah.
[02:18:52.590 --> 02:18:53.710]  And then tap on.
[02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:54.430]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.470]  That's good.
[02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:58.430]  Look at that frozen shot.
[02:18:58.430 --> 02:18:59.310]  You see that there?
[02:19:00.750 --> 02:19:00.990]  Yeah.
[02:19:01.950 --> 02:19:04.350]  So those are critical in fighting thrips.
[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:09.070]  Thrips are obviously something that we deal with out here, especially we had this heat wave.
[02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:12.750]  So we had some shit pop in here and it's nice to see, you know, by what we're doing,
[02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:15.470]  it's bringing predators in as well as the other shit.
[02:19:15.470 --> 02:19:18.350]  So our name of the game is not to kill everything.
[02:19:18.350 --> 02:19:22.990]  It's to kind of keep that everything under that economic threshold and have that balance.
[02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:25.870]  But we haven't, one thing we haven't seen is a mite.
[02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:28.190]  We're happy about that.
[02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.750]  Fuck yeah.
[02:19:30.990 --> 02:19:32.990]  We're open to everything in here.
[02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:37.790]  So it just shows that you get enough of the good guys, you won't have to deal with the bad guys.
[02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:42.350]  I want some of the happy giggly weed that Philip's smoking today.
[02:19:44.110 --> 02:19:45.870]  I actually don't smoke at all during the day.
[02:19:47.310 --> 02:19:47.950]  At all.
[02:19:47.950 --> 02:19:48.350]  All right.
[02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:49.390]  What was that, Alex?
[02:19:49.390 --> 02:19:53.310]  Who is the shorn one?
[02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:54.910]  Yes, you.
[02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:55.550]  That's me.
[02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:56.030]  Yes.
[02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.270]  Yeah.
[02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:59.390]  No, it's just, you know, all the drugs are in us anyway.
[02:20:00.110 --> 02:20:03.150]  You tap in and you can unlock it.
[02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:05.390]  Fuck yeah.
[02:20:06.510 --> 02:20:08.030]  Unlock that happiness.
[02:20:11.390 --> 02:20:13.070]  Do you say green goddess shout out to her?
[02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:15.390]  She's asking what you top dress with.
[02:20:15.390 --> 02:20:15.950]  Oh yeah.
[02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:20.990]  So in veg pre-planting, so our soil conditioner, we run a soil conditioning tea,
[02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.950]  which is neem and kelp.
[02:20:21.950 --> 02:20:27.390]  We'll bubble that for 24 hours and that'll kill off any pests that might be lingering around
[02:20:27.390 --> 02:20:31.790]  in the pest or in the pest, sorry, in the soil, trying to establish itself prior to planting.
[02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:33.710]  And it'll also boost bacteria.
[02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:35.470]  We'll run that through veg as well.
[02:20:35.470 --> 02:20:37.310]  That helps with uptake of nutrients.
[02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:39.470]  And like I said, keeping that soil nice and clean.
[02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:48.750]  Then we'll top dress neem meal, caranja, oyster, gypsum, crab, kelp.
[02:20:49.470 --> 02:20:50.830]  And we threw in basalt.
[02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:53.310]  But basalt lasts years and years.
[02:20:53.310 --> 02:20:55.950]  So yeah, no more.
[02:20:55.950 --> 02:20:56.990]  We got enough in here.
[02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:59.310]  And then more than enough.
[02:20:59.310 --> 02:21:04.350]  And then at transition, we throw down like anywhere from the end of week one to the end
[02:21:04.350 --> 02:21:08.350]  of week two, we'll throw down fishbone meal and insect grass.
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.080]  And you leave the root balls, right?
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:20.640]  We do.
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:24.400]  And then eventually they get to the point where you touch and it just falls over.
[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:26.720]  And the roly polies and worms kind of have at it.
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:27.680]  It turns into humus.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:34.680]  Do you see that one?
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:41.990]  Phillip, can you see that question?
[02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:43.370]  Oh, yeah.
[02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:46.550]  Can you elaborate a little bit more on that question specifically?
[02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:47.990]  I'm not quite sure what he's asking.
[02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:52.710]  Yeah, City, elaborate on the question.
[02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:56.710]  Someone else said you got the VPD dialed in.
[02:21:56.710 --> 02:22:01.190]  Do you guys like look at VPD charts and stuff like that or not really?
[02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.910]  As a reference.
[02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:05.750]  We're starting to do it more as a reference as we push further into like really honing
[02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:07.350]  in and dialing in the greenhouse.
[02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:12.150]  Obviously, like most people have found running that higher humidity pushes the plants that
[02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:13.670]  much better.
[02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:18.470]  I mean, it eliminates a lot of the stressors people are just like dealing with on a constant
[02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:22.710]  basis, especially when we're in like Southern Oregon, super hot, super dry in summer.
[02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:26.310]  So this greenhouse can get down into like the teens in humidity.
[02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:29.270]  So we look at it every so often.
[02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:31.830]  It's like a reference point for us to kind of chase after.
[02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:35.190]  And then, yeah, something that we can look at.
[02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:39.270]  And then, yeah, something that we try to shoot for, especially in the night times when
[02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:42.150]  night gets cool, humidity spikes like crazy.
[02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:44.710]  So we try to keep that variance to a minimal.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.480]  Do you see clarified?
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:59.000]  What microbes are you trying to introduce to the system?
[02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:02.360]  You know, we stick with the diversity.
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:07.960]  I don't think we haven't really gone into the specific microbes, but lactic acid bacteria
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:19.240]  is one that we use in our teas, not every tea, but in flour to keep, you know, and then
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.520]  to keep everything breaking down.
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:26.600]  So microbe, we don't use any actually like anything that's introduced into our soil is
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:29.640]  done through the compost manure in the furnace.
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:33.480]  We don't we don't use any like pre-bottled, pre-powdered stuff like that.
[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:34.360]  Native microbes.
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:38.520]  Yeah, because essentially like our take on it is like, yeah, you can introduce that.
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:42.680]  But what's native is going to always overtake that in time and you're going to have to reapply
[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:43.160]  it.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:47.400]  So we just inoculate it with what we have on site essentially.
[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:48.520]  And that's worked for us.
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.000]  We've run HBS in here.
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.400]  So we got phantoms and 1000 watt DEs.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:08.320]  Very interested in looking at running LED in here, though, and see what it can do.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:16.690]  So we've edged for everything in here, some clone we've edged for about.
[02:24:18.930 --> 02:24:19.570]  Five weeks total.
[02:24:19.570 --> 02:24:21.010]  Yeah, six weeks total.
[02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:23.250]  And we're on day 21 today.
[02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:23.810]  So.
[02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:27.410]  So the clones went in here on what date?
[02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:30.930]  Oh, man.
[02:24:30.930 --> 02:24:32.370]  And today is June 3rd.
[02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:35.490]  I mean, we've edged in here for three weeks.
[02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:39.410]  So yeah, five weeks ago, six weeks ago.
[02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.930]  Six weeks ago.
[02:24:40.930 --> 02:24:42.210]  Yeah, six weeks ago they came in here.
[02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:45.570]  Then we've edged for three weeks and we're pushing.
[02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:46.690]  Yesterday was the end of week three.
[02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:54.890]  And you guys are growing for pennies on the dollar compared to a lot of these other guys,
[02:24:54.890 --> 02:24:58.250]  like you had mentioned, you using your own compost.
[02:24:58.970 --> 02:25:00.810]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:01.690 --> 02:25:04.650]  What's what's the temperature swings?
[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:09.210]  A question like 10 to 15 degrees, depending like yesterday we had or the past couple of
[02:25:09.210 --> 02:25:10.170]  days we had heat waves.
[02:25:10.170 --> 02:25:16.890]  So it I think it was like between day and night, it was like 13 or 14 degrees.
[02:25:17.770 --> 02:25:21.690]  We run that wet wall and that helps us keep the temps nice and cool.
[02:25:23.930 --> 02:25:25.130]  And then how about in the winter?
[02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:26.170]  What are you doing to heat?
[02:25:27.050 --> 02:25:29.130]  I got we got two heaters up there.
[02:25:29.130 --> 02:25:31.450]  So two big ass heaters up top, propane.
[02:25:32.090 --> 02:25:36.090]  And yeah, those keep us easily in the 70s all winter.
[02:25:36.570 --> 02:25:40.090]  I mean, it could be 16 outside and we're Miami in here.
[02:25:43.050 --> 02:25:44.490]  I know Alex likes that.
[02:25:44.490 --> 02:25:45.290]  That's what I was saying.
[02:25:45.290 --> 02:25:46.170]  That's why I said that.
[02:25:46.170 --> 02:25:46.650]  Exactly.
[02:25:49.130 --> 02:25:52.170]  You keep the grinning temperature optimal.
[02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:56.090]  That's the plan to maximize the grin even in the winter.
[02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:58.490]  Got to keep everyone happy, including the people, right?
[02:25:59.610 --> 02:26:01.050]  I'm not trying to cook our brain.
[02:26:01.050 --> 02:26:03.290]  No, no.
[02:26:03.850 --> 02:26:04.350]  No.
[02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:06.810]  Look at that.
[02:26:06.810 --> 02:26:09.370]  You got a bunch of pretty girls in Miami and they're all happy.
[02:26:09.370 --> 02:26:09.930]  Imagine that.
[02:26:09.930 --> 02:26:12.090]  We're at the beach.
[02:26:22.570 --> 02:26:25.930]  We all would love a place like that, especially on the outside of the greenhouse.
[02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:26.970]  What those boys are doing.
[02:26:27.690 --> 02:26:28.330]  That's the goal.
[02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:29.850]  Appreciate it.
[02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:34.570]  Yeah, we're definitely going to venture more into animals and food now that
[02:26:34.570 --> 02:26:40.250]  this is getting to that more sustained, self-sustained greenhouse, I should say.
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:56.080]  If it were nighttime right now, my crickets in my garage would would sync up with your crickets.
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:58.160]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:26:58.640]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.640]  It gets loud out here at night.
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:02.960]  You get a green light in here.
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:03.920]  They'd harmonize.
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:05.140]  Yeah.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:06.360]  It's loud.
[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:08.020]  I was curious.
[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:10.100]  You mentioned that people are like, oh, you have crickets.
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:11.220]  What are you going to do about that?
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:13.540]  I've never heard crickets causing a problem.
[02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:14.040]  Can they?
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:16.980]  I've heard they can eat leaves and stuff.
[02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:22.500]  I've never dealt with it myself, but it may be from like, I don't want to say, maybe like a
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:24.580]  fear-based thought.
[02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:27.220]  Maybe they haven't seen it themselves.
[02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:27.780]  Maybe they have.
[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:28.500]  I don't know.
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:30.020]  I've heard they can chew on plant material.
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:31.060]  I've never had it happen.
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:32.900]  So yeah.
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:34.340]  Because a lot of people are in the.
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:36.260]  I've heard they don't do that either.
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:37.860]  Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
[02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:41.460]  I feel like a lot of people say that too, but again, it has to be in check and in moderation.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:46.260]  I mean, anything that gets crazy out of control would devastate pretty much anything that
[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:47.700]  consumes organic matter.
[02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:49.060]  Exactly.
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:54.420]  And so that's why we just try to keep everything fed, whether it's greens, browns, top dressing,
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:57.060]  try to have a constant food source for everything.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.180]  Greens turn to brown.
[02:27:58.900 --> 02:28:04.820]  Where chopping and dropping has helped a lot with keeping the soil fed and all the microbes
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:08.900]  in there busy without having to go to the plant for sustenance.
[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:10.740]  Exactly.
[02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:20.190]  Man, I bet a lot of people that farm are kind of jealous right now.
[02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:24.990]  Look, man, we're just growing cilantro.
[02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.870]  I mean, look over here.
[02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:27.870]  This vegetable.
[02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:29.790]  This is a flowered azalea.
[02:28:30.750 --> 02:28:31.390]  Just greens.
[02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:33.310]  All we're doing is that.
[02:28:36.430 --> 02:28:37.310]  This is our best one.
[02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:39.150]  It's gone solid.
[02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:41.390]  Ferments.
[02:28:41.390 --> 02:28:47.150]  Well, we have found that with the way that we top dress, the ferments can kind of push
[02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:48.830]  the plants a little too far.
[02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:51.390]  And so we backed off watering them in.
[02:28:51.950 --> 02:28:59.070]  We will feed through foliar with the veg and the fruit all day.
[02:28:59.070 --> 02:29:01.230]  Damn, we're going to get shit done if we stay in here all day.
[02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:04.030]  Well, you can just put the camera.
[02:29:05.710 --> 02:29:11.150]  You can balance it on a book or something and just leave it going, plugged into the wall.
[02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:12.430]  Exactly.
[02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:20.030]  Yeah, so we don't really feed much ferment besides foliar, at least through soil.
[02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:22.510]  We found that it's just it's too much.
[02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:25.870]  We had some tip burning the last time we ran it.
[02:29:26.430 --> 02:29:29.230]  Some plants will show that while others can handle it.
[02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:31.710]  So just keep an eye out for that.
[02:29:31.710 --> 02:29:32.910]  So you don't go too far.
[02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:36.350]  You know, got to be take it with a grain of salt.
[02:29:36.350 --> 02:29:38.990]  But it's worth it because it's pennies on the dollar.
[02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.710]  Like you said, Brian.
[02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:43.630]  That's the goal, baby.
[02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:46.350]  Whether we're a small time farmer or a big time farmer.
[02:29:46.350 --> 02:29:47.710]  You guys growing tomatoes.
[02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:52.190]  My wife actually picks them up this year.
[02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:53.790]  I am not.
[02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:54.990]  I would ask her.
[02:29:54.990 --> 02:29:58.030]  I think I want to say honestly, I don't know off the top of my head.
[02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.910]  My wife's trying to.
[02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:04.510]  We're trying to kind of dial that into outdoors with the food.
[02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:08.110]  You know, we got to do row covers because the plants get burned.
[02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:09.790]  The sun's brutal.
[02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:16.670]  Yeah, we're trying to implement a small veggie patch up there by that fence line this year.
[02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:20.750]  And we got peppers and yeah, got some spinach.
[02:30:21.710 --> 02:30:23.790]  And then we'll get the animals out here.
[02:30:24.990 --> 02:30:27.790]  So probably the most important question of the day.
[02:30:28.350 --> 02:30:33.470]  Cheddar Bob, who's currently tooth challenged and probably in the dentist chair right now,
[02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:37.310]  wants to know what kind of toothpaste keep those whites so pearly.
[02:30:40.270 --> 02:30:46.510]  And is he known for his exceptional dental genetics?
[02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.830]  Yes.
[02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:53.470]  Do the ladies want to crossbreed with him to pass on those?
[02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:56.830]  Those genetics.
[02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:59.390]  And I've already crossed the genetics and we're sticking to that one.
[02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:04.830]  Shout out to your wonderful family, man.
[02:31:04.830 --> 02:31:07.150]  I know you just had a baby as well.
[02:31:07.150 --> 02:31:08.030]  So cool.
[02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:09.790]  Cool being a father, man.
[02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:10.510]  It is.
[02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:11.070]  We joke.
[02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:12.030]  We call ourselves.
[02:31:12.030 --> 02:31:12.990]  We're not just farmers.
[02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:14.030]  We're dad farmers.
[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:15.070]  That's right.
[02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.710]  That's right.
[02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:21.470]  My toothpaste, which I care about toothpaste.
[02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:24.430]  And I doctor Harry's.
[02:31:24.430 --> 02:31:30.510]  It's like a clay based toothpaste and it comes in a little jar, a little glass jar.
[02:31:31.230 --> 02:31:34.270]  And it's just got like a bunch of cool stuff in there.
[02:31:34.270 --> 02:31:37.710]  Spearmint and essential oil and it's clay based.
[02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:39.790]  So it foams up and everything.
[02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:42.350]  I found it at the health store.
[02:31:42.350 --> 02:31:44.430]  And ever since then, I've been ordering it online.
[02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:46.990]  But yeah, I like it a lot.
[02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:48.430]  It works.
[02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.790]  I'm not.
[02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:53.550]  Is this it?
[02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:55.950]  There it is right here.
[02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:56.430]  That's it.
[02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:58.510]  There it is.
[02:31:58.510 --> 02:31:59.870]  You're not just a client.
[02:32:00.430 --> 02:32:00.750]  I'm not.
[02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.990]  He's a Custy.
[02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.870]  I'm a Custy.
[02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:07.150]  I'm a Custy and a farmer.
[02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:11.470]  I love next time when someone asks.
[02:32:11.470 --> 02:32:16.190]  Shatterbob's mind is blown and he is on Amazon right now.
[02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:21.310]  That's what I was trying to say is that I feel like people are going to be like asking you
[02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:23.390]  that you'd be like, I know a guy, Uncle Harry.
[02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:26.270]  There's going to be like a run on this too.
[02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:28.350]  The brand's not going to know what the fuck's going on.
[02:32:28.350 --> 02:32:29.630]  They're like, oh, what the hell?
[02:32:33.870 --> 02:32:35.310]  They're like, who is this Alex guy?
[02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:37.870]  We need a lifetime supply.
[02:32:37.870 --> 02:32:38.510]  Let's go.
[02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:40.030]  We just got you sponsorship, bud.
[02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:50.790]  But Alex, beware.
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:54.470]  I'm man, you know, reach out and oh, what's that?
[02:32:57.830 --> 02:33:03.270]  That's funny because my wife tells me she's like, are you estrogenic right now after I smoke?
[02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:09.990]  So I limit my smoking now.
[02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:14.790]  We'll look into the science on that.
[02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:22.950]  Well, why don't we call it on that?
[02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:28.310]  Because I got to get to the post office so people don't get angry at how long their seed
[02:33:28.310 --> 02:33:29.110]  packs are taken.
[02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.790]  That works.
[02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:35.350]  We appreciate you guys showing it off A to Z, man.
[02:33:35.350 --> 02:33:37.750]  That's just top class, man.
[02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:38.790]  When you guys do that.
[02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:39.510]  Appreciate it, man.
[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:40.310]  It was a pleasure.
[02:33:40.310 --> 02:33:41.110]  We've had a lot of fun.
[02:33:44.470 --> 02:33:47.030]  And you guys kept the tooting to a minimum.
[02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:50.390]  Oh, yes.
[02:33:51.590 --> 02:34:04.530]  Is that a pump and I do that is gold.
[02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:04.690]  Right.
[02:34:04.690 --> 02:34:06.050]  The red lion.
[02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:06.850]  That's gold.
[02:34:06.850 --> 02:34:08.610]  That's the third member of the team right there.
[02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:12.290]  What do you call it?
[02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:13.330]  The red lion.
[02:34:13.330 --> 02:34:14.610]  It's the red lion.
[02:34:18.210 --> 02:34:18.450]  Right.
[02:34:18.450 --> 02:34:19.570]  I'm not a sponsor.
[02:34:22.370 --> 02:34:25.170]  But yeah, that's the third member of the team.
[02:34:25.170 --> 02:34:26.210]  That's the teammate.
[02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:27.010]  The T sender.
[02:34:27.090 --> 02:34:27.810]  T sender.
[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:29.810]  Appreciate it.
[02:34:29.810 --> 02:34:30.130]  Thank you.
[02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:31.730]  Appreciate all you guys.
[02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:34.450]  Yeah, everyone's nice today.
[02:34:34.450 --> 02:34:36.770]  Usually they lighten you up, man.
[02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:37.090]  Really?
[02:34:37.090 --> 02:34:37.570]  Talk the shit.
[02:34:38.130 --> 02:34:39.730]  Oh, there's Marty right there.
[02:34:39.730 --> 02:34:40.290]  That's my guy.
[02:34:41.490 --> 02:34:43.650]  He's also from Florida, coincidentally.
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.120]  Sorry, I'm just looking.
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:51.400]  I'm reading the chat.
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:53.160]  But all right.
[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:56.840]  Well, we're two hours and 35 minutes in.
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:34:58.280]  We'll call it.
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.200]  And we'll end with some.
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:08.000]  I like the chat that all the comments were nice and warm and friendly.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.200]  We didn't have to give anyone.
[02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:13.680]  We didn't have to give out any Snickers bars today.
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.560]  Does that does that beard get dunked in any of the in any of the rain barrels ever?
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:25.520]  Everything.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:26.400]  Everything.
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:30.480]  Dude, it's got I'm sure it's got quite the amount of alpaca shit in there.
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.000]  Ferment barley.
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:34.480]  A little bit of everything, man.
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:36.400]  This thing takes as much work as the garden does.
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:37.120]  I'll tell you that much.
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:39.600]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.040]  Otherwise, my wife's on my ass.
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:42.160]  So yeah.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:43.600]  Yeah.
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:46.000]  All right.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.200]  Number one, I'll tell you that, though.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:49.120]  Allo.
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:49.620]  Allo.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:55.200]  Plants and it is it is a living soil
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:55.920]  and living beard.
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:35:58.480]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:00.720]  I'm sure there's all kinds of shit hiding in there at any point.
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.600]  Are you guys like monkeys that like pick the ticks and other stuff out of each other's?
[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.800]  We're not that close.
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:13.440]  You guys sit in a circle with the family.
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:16.800]  All right, man, you go home.
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:22.240]  All right.
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:23.840]  Well, thank you, everyone.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:35.440]  So if Chad's still on here, Chad Saturday at 2 p.m. Pacific time, James is Sunday at 11 a.m.
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:41.600]  Brian, I like I like the background.
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:42.720]  I'm digging the background.
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:44.320]  Appreciate it.
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:44.820]  Yeah.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:46.160]  Yeah.
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:50.080]  Before we started, he had what is it a green screen or a blue screen?
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:51.520]  Blue screen.
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:53.520]  And you were wearing a blue shirt.
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:54.800]  I believe.
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:55.280]  Yes.
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:55.760]  And it looks.
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.560]  Yeah, that was trippy.
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:36:58.880]  I liked it.
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:05.360]  But anyway, he swapped out a shirt that's not the same color as the green screen or the blue screen.
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:10.960]  People are still talking about the beard.
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:15.040]  I don't know if you guys have been reading the comments, but.
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:16.800]  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:18.160]  We're trying to get away from root rise.
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:20.100]  For sure.
[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:20.680]  Yeah.
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.300]  Oh, that's genius.
[02:37:24.420 --> 02:37:25.060]  All right.
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:26.420]  Well, thank you, everyone.
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:34.740]  Have a good rest of your Thursday or beginning of your Friday if you're just waking up in Australia
[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:38.980]  and smoking on that ABC with your first cup of coffee.
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:40.260]  Oh, there you go.
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:41.060]  Appreciate everyone.
[02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:42.580]  Thank you, Brian.
[02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:43.540]  Absolutely.
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:47.300]  I'm glad to promote you guys today because I feel like this is going to go a long way
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:52.820]  and just having the community believe that they themselves can achieve this because,
[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:55.860]  Alex, you know, we all kind of all started in that same room, bro.
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:59.780]  And there's a lot of people that are starting to make a name for themselves in the industry.
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:01.780]  And I'm glad you're one of them, buddy.
[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:02.340]  Thanks, man.
[02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:02.840]  I appreciate you.
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:03.940]  Yeah.
[02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:10.500]  And if a bunch of strange men start showing up at your farm, that's just Chad and the Motley
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:12.420]  crew that he picked up along the way.
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:13.140]  Oh, shit.
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:15.460]  That's not unheard of in Southern Oregon.
[02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:16.500]  So I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:20.580]  And Chad now knows what HMU means.
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:20.820]  So.
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:22.100]  Oh, there you go.
[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:22.820]  Hit me up.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:24.020]  Hit me up.
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:24.660]  That's right.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:25.960]  Fuck yeah.
[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:27.080]  Cheddar Bob.
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:29.380]  Thank you, Cheddar Bob.
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:32.660]  Don Irie.
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:39.300]  Don Irie's actually so Don's seeds are up on the website right now and people have been
[02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:40.020]  picking them up.
[02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:43.540]  And then I got to do some data entry with the.
[02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:45.780]  That's the.
[02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:48.180]  You guys can see.
[02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:50.820]  Can you recognize that?
[02:38:51.700 --> 02:38:52.980]  Seattle product.
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:53.620]  Yeah.
[02:38:53.620 --> 02:38:54.120]  Yeah.
[02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:59.140]  Today is a day of of data entry.
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:03.460]  Anyway, thank you, everyone.
[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:04.020]  Appreciate it.
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:04.520]  You guys.
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:09.220]  You guys do, man.
