[00:00.000 --> 00:01.340]  I did, I did.
[00:01.340 --> 00:02.400]  Hey, Peter.
[00:02.400 --> 00:04.400]  Yes, well, Leighton, we are now live.
[00:04.400 --> 00:08.160]  So do you want to say it live, whatever you're about to say?
[00:08.160 --> 00:09.280]  Yeah, I might as well.
[00:09.280 --> 00:14.440]  I just wanted to promote the vccompost.com, my compost
[00:14.440 --> 00:16.640]  hub, in California.
[00:16.640 --> 00:17.440]  Send a sample.
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.520]  I texted you a little picture, Peter,
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.440]  that I'd love you to put up at some point.
[00:21.440 --> 00:22.360]  I'll throw it up.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.440]  So I just wanted to quickly, this was funny.
[00:24.440 --> 00:26.840]  Gemma wrote, I'm upstairs.
[00:26.840 --> 00:28.000]  See you soon.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.600]  In my room, Gemma Hart, are you still packing up your seeds?
[00:33.600 --> 00:37.360]  Yes, no, I get to, it's a yes or no answer question.
[00:37.360 --> 00:39.320]  So anyway, that's.
[00:39.320 --> 00:44.480]  But you guys were just flexing your concentrate.
[00:44.480 --> 00:46.800]  So why don't we go around the horn.
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.200]  Let's start with TerpFountainGenetics.
[00:49.200 --> 00:52.720]  What are you dabbing on this morning?
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.400]  Well, this morning, I got some pie gas and full melt.
[00:57.400 --> 01:00.760]  I've been smoking on that a little bit, a little 90 micron.
[01:00.760 --> 01:06.160]  And then got my piegasm number three.
[01:06.160 --> 01:07.880]  Very nice.
[01:07.880 --> 01:10.720]  Kind of like a pop tart, kind of a red pop tart kind of terp
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.920]  to it.
[01:11.920 --> 01:15.240]  Real kind of pastry like, I would say.
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.200]  But not to be outdone, or wait, is there more?
[01:19.200 --> 01:19.800]  Oh, of course.
[01:19.800 --> 01:20.600]  There's a few more.
[01:20.600 --> 01:21.920]  OK, keep going, keep going.
[01:21.920 --> 01:25.880]  And by the way, is that a bra hanging in the background?
[01:25.880 --> 01:26.600]  Oh, it might be.
[01:26.600 --> 01:27.720]  I better fucking move that.
[01:27.720 --> 01:30.280]  I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:30.280 --> 01:31.960]  I love it.
[01:31.960 --> 01:33.080]  A little swoop.
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.800]  I shouldn't have said anything.
[01:40.440 --> 01:43.520]  So not to be outdone.
[01:43.520 --> 01:45.080]  Oh, that's looking good.
[01:45.080 --> 01:47.320]  Show off his breakfast cereal.
[01:47.320 --> 01:52.040]  That's the Sunday cereal, Viola.
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.800]  Nice.
[01:53.800 --> 01:54.300]  Yep.
[01:57.880 --> 01:59.320]  What are you smoking on, Peter?
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.520]  Layton?
[02:01.520 --> 02:03.680]  Right now, absolutely nothing.
[02:03.680 --> 02:06.840]  I got my handy little grinder here
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.360]  with some nice organic regen bud that I'll be diving
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.880]  into a little later today.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.280]  I've been smoking for the past day or so
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.480]  on the mother's milk, which is soul spirit, which
[02:21.480 --> 02:26.240]  is placed in the Emerald Cup.
[02:26.240 --> 02:29.280]  One of the, I don't know, their categories are very,
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.760]  it's like third party sun grown.
[02:34.760 --> 02:37.520]  And I don't really know what the third party is in reference to,
[02:37.520 --> 02:40.680]  but anyway.
[02:40.680 --> 02:42.240]  Probably third party certified.
[02:42.240 --> 02:44.040]  A lot of those guys like to do that,
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.920]  where someone else is saying how great it is.
[02:47.640 --> 02:50.560]  Speaking of great things, let's kind of get back more.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.920]  The flow of the show, I feel like.
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.440]  Let's talk about great hair, because I
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.600]  feel like there's some great hair on the show today.
[02:55.600 --> 02:56.100]  Yeah.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.480]  So what up, Andrew?
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.080]  We're excited to have you on the show.
[03:02.080 --> 03:04.440]  Each and every Thursday, guys, we're
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.280]  going out of our way to bring you, the Living Soil nerds,
[03:07.280 --> 03:10.240]  the Living Soil community, the best and brightest.
[03:10.240 --> 03:13.880]  And Daguerre and myself, a few years ago, we put on a party,
[03:13.880 --> 03:15.400]  and we reached out to a lot of people
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.680]  that we were really enjoying to highlight.
[03:18.680 --> 03:20.360]  And Andrew is one of them.
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.840]  And that's because he's talented.
[03:22.840 --> 03:25.400]  He's one of the, I hope you take this with love, buddy,
[03:25.400 --> 03:27.600]  you're one of the young bucks out there that's really
[03:27.600 --> 03:29.120]  starting to make a name for himself.
[03:29.120 --> 03:33.160]  And a lot of us want to continue to help
[03:33.160 --> 03:36.120]  you put your name out there, because you do the work.
[03:36.120 --> 03:38.760]  We know that, I've seen your hands before
[03:38.760 --> 03:39.720]  and that kind of stuff.
[03:39.720 --> 03:41.240]  I know that you're actually washing it.
[03:41.240 --> 03:43.080]  It's not like you've got a team over there,
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.440]  and then you're just washing it.
[03:44.440 --> 03:46.760]  You've got a team over there, and then you're pretending
[03:46.760 --> 03:49.480]  like you're actually the one doing the work.
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.320]  So I wanted for today, for a lot of our audience,
[03:52.320 --> 03:54.120]  I know, as far as I understand, buddy,
[03:54.120 --> 03:56.080]  you've never shown your face before.
[03:56.080 --> 03:57.680]  So this is another one of those times
[03:57.680 --> 04:00.600]  where we're able to reach out to the community,
[04:00.600 --> 04:03.560]  and the community can kind of accept you fully now
[04:03.560 --> 04:06.960]  to see who's really behind the bright mind of Turk Fountain
[04:06.960 --> 04:08.000]  Genetics.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.040]  Shout out to Rocky as well.
[04:10.040 --> 04:13.600]  You're doing a collab drop with him, I believe, in July.
[04:13.640 --> 04:16.160]  So we kind of wanted to start there and talk about some
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.800]  of the stuff that you're putting out,
[04:17.800 --> 04:20.120]  because we do have a lot of background with you, buddy.
[04:20.120 --> 04:21.920]  But we'd really love to learn more
[04:21.920 --> 04:24.160]  about what you've been working on behind the scenes,
[04:24.160 --> 04:26.280]  it seems like, for the last two years.
[04:26.280 --> 04:27.840]  Absolutely.
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.840]  So basically, I've been just focusing
[04:29.840 --> 04:31.640]  on the flavors I love.
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.800]  I've always been a fruit lover, a sour lover, and an OG lover.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.320]  So I've really just been pinning down those turps
[04:39.320 --> 04:43.960]  and trying to focus on things that are stable and ice water
[04:43.960 --> 04:46.680]  forward and really stand out in their terpenes.
[04:46.680 --> 04:52.160]  I'm not trying to play the cookies and wedding cake card.
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.440]  I mean, those are great washers and great genetics.
[04:54.440 --> 04:55.760]  There's nothing wrong with them.
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.600]  But I'm just trying to kind of blaze a new trail terpene-wise
[04:59.600 --> 05:02.680]  and try to bring something new to the table that
[05:02.680 --> 05:06.120]  will add something special to people's menus in ice water
[05:06.120 --> 05:08.480]  hash.
[05:08.520 --> 05:11.720]  Yeah, so we got Peter showing basically
[05:11.720 --> 05:13.280]  your brand new Instagram, man.
[05:13.280 --> 05:15.200]  I know you've had it up there for a little bit.
[05:15.200 --> 05:18.640]  But these are obviously what the community is after.
[05:18.640 --> 05:20.880]  And so obviously, Leighton and I,
[05:20.880 --> 05:23.960]  we are going to have a conversation with you today
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.360]  where we'd love to learn more and kind of pick your brain
[05:26.360 --> 05:28.880]  and have those gold nugget moments,
[05:28.880 --> 05:31.560]  because we really do feel like you have something special,
[05:31.560 --> 05:34.160]  man, and we want to share that with the community today.
[05:34.160 --> 05:35.240]  I appreciate that.
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.400]  And yeah, I mean, I definitely got some nuggets for you guys.
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.400]  And I can talk about some things
[05:41.400 --> 05:44.480]  that I've learned along the way and some of my experiences.
[05:44.480 --> 05:46.720]  And hopefully, I have something that
[05:46.720 --> 05:49.280]  can benefit some of you guys.
[05:49.280 --> 05:51.760]  We got a mystery guest calling in a little bit later.
[05:51.760 --> 05:55.040]  So stay tuned for that as well.
[05:55.040 --> 05:56.120]  Very nice.
[05:56.120 --> 06:01.000]  So firstly, I mean, I want to talk about what
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.040]  my first line is.
[06:02.040 --> 06:04.360]  So basically, this piegasm that I've been showing off,
[06:04.360 --> 06:06.280]  it's kind of been my pride and joy.
[06:06.280 --> 06:11.600]  And so I popped about 50 seeds of it.
[06:11.600 --> 06:14.720]  I'm trying to figure out when that was.
[06:14.720 --> 06:17.800]  Maybe like eight months ago, 10 months ago.
[06:17.800 --> 06:20.400]  And I separated out the males and females.
[06:20.400 --> 06:22.000]  I had all my females in one room,
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.800]  put all the males in the other, and flowered all the males,
[06:25.800 --> 06:30.600]  flowered all the females, really figured out what was doing what,
[06:30.600 --> 06:32.960]  how everything looks.
[06:32.960 --> 06:35.800]  And from there, I picked out my male selection.
[06:35.800 --> 06:38.880]  And put it through stress testing.
[06:38.880 --> 06:42.440]  And shucked pollen off it and saved it.
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.200]  And then really just put it through hell
[06:44.200 --> 06:48.400]  and beat it up and underwatered it.
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.200]  Let it over-veg the pot, seeing if I
[06:51.200 --> 06:54.960]  could get it to throw out some pistols, so to speak,
[06:54.960 --> 06:57.360]  or any kind of irregularities.
[06:57.360 --> 07:00.000]  And it passed the test.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.720]  The terpenes were exceptional on it.
[07:01.720 --> 07:05.440]  It had great resin on it.
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.200]  That washable resin that has a good pliability
[07:08.200 --> 07:10.160]  between the fingers when you're squeezing it.
[07:10.160 --> 07:14.080]  You can really grab down on resin on washable plants,
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.240]  male and female alike.
[07:15.240 --> 07:19.280]  And you'll see strings between it,
[07:19.280 --> 07:22.400]  or you'll feel a little bit of sandy granularness.
[07:22.400 --> 07:25.160]  But there's going to be a tackiness to the resin
[07:25.160 --> 07:27.240]  in these washing plants.
[07:27.240 --> 07:30.000]  Whereas in some of the non-washing plants,
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.960]  you're going to have, when you pinch the resin,
[07:31.960 --> 07:34.880]  it's kind of just, you're going to feel it instantly collapse.
[07:34.880 --> 07:36.720]  And there's going to be a greasiness to it.
[07:36.720 --> 07:39.320]  And there's good plants like that.
[07:39.320 --> 07:41.240]  And some of those plants that you'll feel them,
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.960]  and they're going to be like, oh, man, this is greasy.
[07:42.960 --> 07:45.440]  I don't know if I'm really going to be able to wash this.
[07:45.440 --> 07:47.840]  You end up washing it, and it doesn't do too bad.
[07:47.840 --> 07:49.800]  But like, and the turps are special.
[07:49.800 --> 07:52.400]  So there's something to be said about those plants, too.
[07:52.400 --> 07:56.880]  But generally, I'm looking for those granular resin heads
[07:56.880 --> 08:01.920]  that have that texture to them and that pliability,
[08:01.920 --> 08:05.520]  so to speak, so that they can make it through the process
[08:05.520 --> 08:07.680]  of ice water, so to speak.
[08:09.840 --> 08:11.600]  And how long have you been, you know,
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.920]  I know you've been washing for a long time.
[08:13.920 --> 08:17.040]  So how long have you really been focused on,
[08:17.040 --> 08:18.720]  you know, moving towards breeding?
[08:19.880 --> 08:22.280]  So I started, I decided to really like,
[08:22.280 --> 08:26.000]  start my breeding path, like, pretty much two years ago.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.640]  Like, I wanted to start making things
[08:27.640 --> 08:31.400]  that were more unique to me, like, more for that reason,
[08:31.400 --> 08:33.560]  and not necessarily to like, you know,
[08:33.560 --> 08:35.480]  have other people get the flavors or whatever.
[08:35.480 --> 08:38.360]  But my attitude over the last couple of years
[08:38.360 --> 08:40.240]  has kind of changed to where like, you know,
[08:40.240 --> 08:41.920]  I'm really excited about these things,
[08:41.920 --> 08:44.280]  and I want other people to be able to experience them, too.
[08:44.280 --> 08:46.720]  So, you know, it kind of turned from something
[08:46.720 --> 08:50.320]  to where I was, you know, trying to build myself up and,
[08:50.320 --> 08:51.920]  you know, with something unique.
[08:51.920 --> 08:53.440]  And then it turned into, you know,
[08:53.440 --> 08:55.720]  I really enjoy like, you know, putting other people on
[08:55.720 --> 08:58.840]  and seeing other people be able to enjoy it, too.
[08:58.840 --> 09:02.720]  You saw that question about the Piegasm lineage.
[09:02.720 --> 09:05.200]  Yeah, so the lineage of the Piegasm,
[09:05.200 --> 09:09.080]  it's a Great Pie BXF2 from Canerado.
[09:09.080 --> 09:10.800]  And I picked that plant out
[09:10.800 --> 09:12.960]  because I'm a big fan of the Great Pie.
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.960]  But the numbers on the Great Pie are more like,
[09:18.200 --> 09:20.880]  they're more like a four to 5% plant.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.320]  And the Great Pie BXF2,
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.960]  I was getting a little over 6% on it,
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.640]  and it had like more of that fruit forward,
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.200]  like berry forward and less so like gassy
[09:35.200 --> 09:36.440]  and less so of like that,
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.720]  like kind of like Tootsie Roll kind of a terp
[09:39.720 --> 09:41.400]  that you can get with some of the Great Pies.
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.360]  And it was just like straight berry, you know,
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.000]  straight pastry, a little bit of cheese on the back.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.400]  And I took that and I got this other,
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.400]  so I went out to Ego Clash and I actually ended up getting
[09:53.400 --> 09:55.960]  a pack of the Gack Melon early,
[09:55.960 --> 09:57.560]  like a year early from everybody else,
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.280]  from Brandon from Dying Breed Seeds.
[10:00.280 --> 10:03.920]  And I popped that pack and I wasn't necessarily
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.040]  like planning to select a male from it,
[10:07.040 --> 10:09.120]  but I found this male that was just nutty
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.520]  and like the terps coming off of it were just insane.
[10:12.520 --> 10:14.780]  And so I decided to shuck it.
[10:14.780 --> 10:16.220]  I hit it to my favorite plant,
[10:16.220 --> 10:18.600]  which was the Great Pie BXF2.
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.160]  And what it made was just like an even hotter berry,
[10:22.160 --> 10:23.880]  like more sharpened fruit,
[10:24.760 --> 10:27.040]  little bit less so pastry once I crossed
[10:27.040 --> 10:28.240]  the Gack Melon into it,
[10:28.240 --> 10:30.920]  but it's just a really a hot berry,
[10:30.920 --> 10:33.240]  like just berry focused strain.
[10:33.240 --> 10:35.200]  And it's almost un-weed like,
[10:35.200 --> 10:37.920]  I've had like some of my relatives and stuff,
[10:37.920 --> 10:39.120]  like smell a jar of it.
[10:39.120 --> 10:41.480]  And they're like, that doesn't smell like weed.
[10:41.480 --> 10:42.860]  And like, they don't smoke or anything.
[10:42.860 --> 10:45.440]  So it's, you know, that always like is a big compliment
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.600]  to me when I can have somebody that doesn't smoke weed,
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.080]  like recognize the terps in something
[10:50.080 --> 10:51.320]  that I'm like working on.
[10:51.320 --> 10:54.320]  That's always like, it's always like, hell yeah, I made it.
[10:56.400 --> 10:59.000]  Since a lot of the viewers are gonna be introduced
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.200]  to you today, Andrew,
[11:00.200 --> 11:02.400]  I also wanted to kind of go into your background
[11:02.400 --> 11:05.280]  because, you know, the reason why I reached out to you
[11:05.280 --> 11:06.720]  to have you on the show is because
[11:06.720 --> 11:08.900]  you're a full circle farmer.
[11:08.900 --> 11:11.720]  You also believe in living soil systems
[11:11.720 --> 11:14.240]  and understanding natural farming concepts.
[11:14.240 --> 11:17.600]  You and I were even at Chris Trump's seminar
[11:17.600 --> 11:18.760]  like two years ago.
[11:18.760 --> 11:21.680]  So you are also putting in the work to understand
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.000]  not only what it's taking to create a fantastic product,
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.160]  having that canvas,
[11:26.160 --> 11:28.280]  but then you're taking it to the next level, obviously,
[11:28.280 --> 11:31.240]  with understanding what genetics are going to make you
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.080]  really stand out.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.760]  And I feel like you have an eye for that.
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.920]  So could we kind of talk more about your background,
[11:36.920 --> 11:41.520]  your belief systems and how you cultivate cannabis
[11:41.520 --> 11:44.200]  so that the viewers can kind of get a better idea?
[11:44.200 --> 11:45.840]  So I think it's like when you're somebody
[11:45.840 --> 11:48.320]  that's like more focused on like the resin
[11:48.880 --> 11:52.040]  and less so focused on the flower,
[11:52.040 --> 11:54.180]  I mean, it opens up a whole new angle
[11:54.180 --> 11:56.760]  of like a closed loop farming, so to speak,
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.600]  because you can literally recycle almost everything
[11:59.600 --> 12:02.320]  back into the soil and, you know, including the nugs,
[12:02.320 --> 12:05.640]  including the branches and the stems and the leaves
[12:05.640 --> 12:07.760]  and even the hash water, you know?
[12:07.760 --> 12:11.040]  So it's like, you can really start to close in the loop
[12:11.040 --> 12:13.440]  where you're not pulling as much from the system
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.160]  because you're pulling off the resin and the turps.
[12:16.160 --> 12:18.840]  And that's pretty much like the extent of it.
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.920]  And you're putting a lot of the biomass
[12:20.920 --> 12:22.880]  back into the ground, so to speak,
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.400]  so that the, you know, the microbial and soil food web
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.820]  can work it down into something
[12:27.820 --> 12:29.000]  that the plant can use again.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.160]  So you're recycling basically your original state nutrients.
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.760]  And, you know, with that, you're gonna have to like,
[12:36.800 --> 12:38.760]  that stuff takes time to activate and stuff.
[12:38.760 --> 12:40.720]  So when you're getting started on a system like that,
[12:40.720 --> 12:42.840]  you're still gonna need to do like, you know,
[12:42.840 --> 12:45.000]  some micronized minerals or ferments
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.920]  or whatever approach you're taking.
[12:48.040 --> 12:50.560]  Because it does take a little bit of time
[12:50.560 --> 12:51.920]  to work down the materials,
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.880]  like when you're making a closed loop sort of system.
[12:55.880 --> 12:57.480]  So, I mean, I definitely recommend that.
[12:57.480 --> 12:59.480]  It's not a complete solution.
[12:59.480 --> 13:02.640]  You're gonna have to, you know, work with your biology
[13:02.640 --> 13:04.200]  and, you know, do things like that.
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.560]  But it is, I think it's an upper hand
[13:06.560 --> 13:08.240]  because a lot of people don't have the ability
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.040]  to put their nugs back in the soil.
[13:10.040 --> 13:11.120]  That's so badass.
[13:11.120 --> 13:13.160]  Feeding plants, plants, I love it.
[13:13.160 --> 13:14.000]  Yep.
[13:14.000 --> 13:14.840]  And maybe a trick too,
[13:14.840 --> 13:16.400]  is to add some worms in the beginning
[13:16.400 --> 13:19.520]  to really get them to munch up that green matter.
[13:19.520 --> 13:20.360]  Or that-
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.200]  Oh, absolutely.
[13:21.200 --> 13:22.520]  Worms, you know, springtails, you know,
[13:22.520 --> 13:24.200]  and the more life you got, the better.
[13:24.200 --> 13:26.840]  But I mean, even just like having good,
[13:27.920 --> 13:30.760]  just fungal and bacterial action going on
[13:30.760 --> 13:33.120]  breaks that stuff down, you know, relatively quickly.
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.200]  And I think a key part to that too is, you know,
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.160]  making sure when you're adding, you know, fresh compost
[13:39.160 --> 13:40.240]  and other things like that,
[13:40.240 --> 13:42.320]  that you're gonna top it off with a little bit of soil.
[13:42.360 --> 13:45.000]  Because if you leave it on the top, you know,
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.160]  you're gonna end up with like that,
[13:46.160 --> 13:48.000]  kind of like that pile of crunchy leaves
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.880]  that you see a lot of people getting,
[13:49.880 --> 13:52.720]  that's not really doing much and it's not breaking down.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.400]  And, you know, by that note too, I mean,
[13:55.400 --> 13:57.040]  I think it's smart to, you know,
[13:57.040 --> 13:59.000]  leave a few extra inches in your pots
[13:59.000 --> 13:59.840]  when you're filling them.
[13:59.840 --> 14:00.880]  Because you're gonna wanna have
[14:00.880 --> 14:03.440]  some of that layering action going on.
[14:03.440 --> 14:05.080]  Yeah, that's a really good suggestion.
[14:05.080 --> 14:06.760]  Cover it up so they don't dry out
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.960]  and they actually get the nutrients
[14:08.960 --> 14:11.400]  instead of letting them evaporate or dissipate.
[14:11.400 --> 14:14.560]  Yeah, that's a great suggestion.
[14:14.560 --> 14:16.480]  So what would you say you're like, you know,
[14:16.480 --> 14:18.640]  if you had your 60 second elevator pitch,
[14:18.640 --> 14:20.440]  like what all is going through your mind
[14:20.440 --> 14:23.120]  when you're starting to build your soil systems?
[14:24.080 --> 14:25.680]  When I'm building my soil systems,
[14:25.680 --> 14:28.960]  I'm just focused on like sustainability
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.080]  and I'm focused on what's gonna make
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.880]  the plants taste the best, you know?
[14:33.880 --> 14:34.880]  That's my focus.
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.520]  And, you know, sometimes I kind of have the approach
[14:38.520 --> 14:39.680]  where like less is more.
[14:39.720 --> 14:41.640]  Like I'd rather pull a plant
[14:41.640 --> 14:42.880]  that's like a little bit hungry
[14:42.880 --> 14:45.560]  than like a plant that's like, I don't know,
[14:45.560 --> 14:47.120]  super like flush at the end
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.920]  when you're going to harvest it, you know?
[14:48.920 --> 14:50.320]  And like just really green still.
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.120]  Like I like to see a little bit of the fade on there.
[14:53.120 --> 14:55.160]  And I like to see, you know,
[14:55.160 --> 14:56.920]  plants like using up some of the nutrients,
[14:56.920 --> 14:59.320]  but I don't like to see to where like, you know,
[14:59.320 --> 15:01.120]  it's like starting to get like those like brown
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.240]  shriveled leaves and stuff.
[15:02.240 --> 15:04.760]  I think there's a fine line, you know,
[15:04.760 --> 15:06.720]  when you're finishing plants like that.
[15:07.920 --> 15:09.160]  You know, I'd love to talk a little bit
[15:09.640 --> 15:10.920]  about the stresses that you're putting them under.
[15:10.920 --> 15:12.920]  Are you doing like nitrogen stresses,
[15:12.920 --> 15:15.480]  over-watering, dry down?
[15:15.480 --> 15:18.600]  I think that's really a key thing to this.
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.040]  So one of the stresses that like, you know,
[15:21.040 --> 15:24.600]  I like to put my plants under is like under-watering.
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.200]  And I also like to, you know, let light leaks go through.
[15:27.200 --> 15:29.520]  And I like the rooms to get a little too hot, you know,
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.680]  when I'm stress testing, you know,
[15:32.680 --> 15:34.240]  just common stuff for the most part.
[15:34.240 --> 15:36.560]  I'm not going like too crazy and doing, you know,
[15:36.560 --> 15:39.120]  shit that like nobody's doing to their plants,
[15:40.080 --> 15:41.440]  but like, I understand that, you know,
[15:41.440 --> 15:43.480]  some people's rooms are, you know, running hotter,
[15:43.480 --> 15:46.200]  like, you know, towards, you know, the high eighties.
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.760]  And I understand that, you know,
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.120]  some people are going to have light leak
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.440]  and stuff like that, you know?
[15:50.440 --> 15:53.400]  So I, you know, let my plants experience those things.
[15:53.400 --> 15:55.760]  And if they, if they harm,
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.560]  then they're out of the selection.
[15:58.760 --> 16:00.600]  Or if they throw female, you know,
[16:00.600 --> 16:02.320]  self-pounding female flowers,
[16:02.320 --> 16:03.520]  then they're out of the selection.
[16:03.520 --> 16:05.680]  It's just, I mean, that's how it has to be.
[16:06.680 --> 16:10.000]  You know, I feel like Leighton and I have asked this question
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.920]  to a lot of the breeders that come on the show,
[16:11.920 --> 16:13.440]  like in your opinion,
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.680]  how big of a pheno hunt do you really need
[16:15.680 --> 16:17.040]  to be running through that stuff?
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.960]  Is that at 10, you know, we've had some people say 10,
[16:20.960 --> 16:22.280]  we've seen obviously a hundred,
[16:22.280 --> 16:24.660]  thousands if you're in a commercial setting,
[16:24.660 --> 16:27.600]  what would be your ideal pheno hunt?
[16:27.600 --> 16:29.600]  My ideal pheno hunt, like I said,
[16:29.600 --> 16:33.240]  is probably like a hundred to 50 plants is ideal.
[16:33.240 --> 16:34.640]  You know, I don't, you know,
[16:34.640 --> 16:36.720]  run that many numbers all the time because, you know,
[16:36.720 --> 16:39.120]  for legal reasons and, you know,
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.400]  but I, you know, I do try to run as many as I can
[16:41.400 --> 16:43.620]  when possible and that's key.
[16:43.620 --> 16:46.160]  But that being said, you know,
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.560]  you can still find some crazy ass winners
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.480]  in just like a 12 pack, you know?
[16:50.480 --> 16:52.680]  Like you can find amazing strains
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.120]  that are even better than, you know,
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.160]  whatever cut they're selling, you know, of that, the cut,
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.440]  you know, a lot of times the cut is just, you know,
[16:59.440 --> 17:01.880]  the second or third best or whatever, you know,
[17:01.880 --> 17:04.720]  a lot of times people keep their best and, you know,
[17:04.720 --> 17:07.160]  the cut that floats around is not the best one.
[17:07.160 --> 17:09.960]  So just popping a 12 pack of seeds
[17:09.960 --> 17:11.960]  allows you to have a cut, you know,
[17:11.960 --> 17:14.040]  that's even better than the cut, you know,
[17:14.040 --> 17:15.460]  in my perspective.
[17:16.520 --> 17:17.720]  So I've got a question for you.
[17:17.720 --> 17:19.120]  When you, when you make your seeds,
[17:19.120 --> 17:22.240]  are you going to feminize them or do you leave them natural?
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.320]  So far I've been running, you know, regular seeds.
[17:25.320 --> 17:28.400]  I've had a little bit of interest in, you know,
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.840]  running some feminized seeds, just, you know,
[17:32.680 --> 17:35.280]  for certain flavors to get certain flavor profiles
[17:35.280 --> 17:38.240]  that I don't have males of or can't get males of.
[17:38.240 --> 17:40.320]  But other than that, like, I don't know,
[17:40.320 --> 17:42.720]  feminized seeds, like there's good feminized seeds,
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.360]  but they just don't interest me as much.
[17:44.360 --> 17:46.960]  Like, I don't know, just not quite my thing.
[17:48.160 --> 17:49.320]  You're a true breeder.
[17:50.360 --> 17:51.400]  I don't know about that.
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.520]  I'm just, I'm a true plant lover.
[17:53.520 --> 17:54.920]  That's what I'd call myself, you know,
[17:54.920 --> 17:58.120]  and I'm a turf seeker and, you know,
[17:58.120 --> 17:59.120]  I just love the plants.
[17:59.120 --> 18:02.080]  I don't know, like, it's just, it's a simple love.
[18:03.680 --> 18:04.960]  Well, you know, it's the nice thing
[18:04.960 --> 18:07.920]  about having just regular seeds is you can play with them.
[18:07.920 --> 18:10.200]  You know, a lot of people don't want to waste the space
[18:10.200 --> 18:12.440]  and I totally get that and they want the feminized
[18:12.440 --> 18:14.080]  so that they're just getting females,
[18:14.080 --> 18:16.120]  but you know, sometimes it's fun to play
[18:16.120 --> 18:17.120]  with the males a little bit.
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.200]  So, kudos to you brother, kudos to you.
[18:21.120 --> 18:22.480]  Yeah, I feel like it really teaches you
[18:22.480 --> 18:24.840]  when you start to actually just have males in the garden.
[18:24.840 --> 18:26.260]  It just, there's just something else.
[18:26.260 --> 18:29.000]  I feel like the other females kind of perk up in a way.
[18:29.840 --> 18:32.080]  It's just a whole new growing experience,
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.880]  I feel like when you first really start
[18:33.880 --> 18:35.240]  to mess around with that.
[18:35.240 --> 18:36.080]  Yeah.
[18:36.080 --> 18:39.080]  There's some truth to that, you know, for sure.
[18:39.080 --> 18:42.400]  You know, a lot of these guys leave those males in there
[18:42.400 --> 18:44.720]  for as long as they possibly can.
[18:44.720 --> 18:48.500]  I got a grower back East that's doing hemp
[18:48.500 --> 18:50.500]  and he says his females are psyched
[18:50.500 --> 18:53.520]  when there's a couple of males in the pot or in the field
[18:53.520 --> 18:55.540]  and then they just have to get to them
[18:55.540 --> 18:58.980]  just before the females start to push or flip
[18:59.820 --> 19:01.580]  but he says that there is a big difference to it.
[19:01.580 --> 19:03.940]  So yeah, that was a good one, Brian.
[19:05.580 --> 19:06.420]  Right on.
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.380]  So how, are you more of like a metaphysical type
[19:11.380 --> 19:12.460]  individual, Andrew?
[19:12.460 --> 19:15.620]  Are you putting crystals in when you're sprouting your beans
[19:15.620 --> 19:20.620]  or are you more focused on tried and true, I guess,
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.860]  you know, you're self-taught as well.
[19:22.860 --> 19:24.940]  So I feel like, you know, just what you've seen
[19:24.940 --> 19:26.900]  with your own experience kind of thing.
[19:27.860 --> 19:31.380]  I mean, I haven't gotten like too into like popping seeds
[19:31.380 --> 19:34.620]  on the moon cycle and like doing things like that.
[19:34.620 --> 19:36.380]  I mean, I think there is something to it
[19:36.380 --> 19:39.540]  but it's not like an area that I've like explored a lot,
[19:39.540 --> 19:43.660]  you know, and I don't know, there's just a lot of like,
[19:43.660 --> 19:46.500]  I think there's a lot of deeper just realms to the earth
[19:46.500 --> 19:47.700]  that we don't understand.
[19:47.700 --> 19:50.420]  And, you know, like I said, like metaphysical powers
[19:50.420 --> 19:53.380]  and, you know, the symbiotic relationship when, you know
[19:53.380 --> 19:55.500]  like you're saying like a female can sense a male
[19:55.500 --> 19:58.100]  being around or I don't know, there's just things
[19:58.100 --> 19:59.180]  that we don't understand.
[19:59.180 --> 20:01.780]  And, you know, I've always felt open to those things,
[20:01.780 --> 20:04.660]  you know, but yeah.
[20:06.100 --> 20:08.460]  So your main focus then is on the soil nutrition
[20:08.460 --> 20:11.780]  and biological diversity for the most part.
[20:11.780 --> 20:14.260]  For the most part, yeah, absolutely.
[20:14.260 --> 20:16.100]  Are you doing IMOs?
[20:16.100 --> 20:18.780]  I do, I do IMO two mostly.
[20:18.780 --> 20:21.140]  I don't do a lot of the IMO three
[20:21.140 --> 20:24.460]  where I'm like mixing it outside just because like,
[20:24.460 --> 20:26.380]  I don't know, like I have a lot of stuff going on
[20:26.380 --> 20:27.540]  and it's hard to like get out there
[20:27.540 --> 20:31.060]  and turn the pile by hand like all the time
[20:31.060 --> 20:32.420]  when it needs to be turned.
[20:32.420 --> 20:33.660]  Are you doing scale?
[20:33.660 --> 20:36.340]  I mean, how big is your growth now?
[20:36.340 --> 20:38.660]  Well, right now I'm just operating as a caregiver.
[20:38.660 --> 20:43.660]  So I have 72 plants and I have to stay strictly within that.
[20:43.980 --> 20:48.980]  But soon I am moving on to like an opportunity
[20:49.820 --> 20:51.660]  to where I will be able to have like some more plants
[20:51.660 --> 20:52.500]  and stuff.
[20:52.500 --> 20:54.740]  I'll be able to work my genetics a little harder
[20:54.740 --> 20:59.300]  and do some larger hunts and it's gonna be a good thing.
[20:59.300 --> 21:01.380]  Nice, so when you use your IMO two,
[21:01.380 --> 21:02.380]  what are you doing with it?
[21:02.380 --> 21:05.340]  Are you making it, liquefying it or?
[21:05.340 --> 21:09.820]  I'm generally doing like the liquid IMO,
[21:09.820 --> 21:14.820]  like, you know, the limo like that Chris Trump promotes.
[21:15.140 --> 21:16.660]  It's his recipe.
[21:16.660 --> 21:17.500]  Okay.
[21:18.780 --> 21:20.540]  It's got like some humic acid in it
[21:20.540 --> 21:25.540]  and it's got FPGA and it's got a little bit of OHN.
[21:26.540 --> 21:30.260]  So you're taking it right from two and liquefying it.
[21:30.260 --> 21:31.100]  So you're not growing it.
[21:31.100 --> 21:32.540]  Yeah, I just brew it straight up.
[21:32.540 --> 21:34.540]  I just take the rice and I usually brew it.
[21:34.540 --> 21:38.180]  Like I brew like a concentrate in a five gallon bucket.
[21:38.180 --> 21:41.460]  And then I like introduce that to my like hole
[21:41.460 --> 21:45.460]  of watering pot basically, like my big reservoir.
[21:45.460 --> 21:47.300]  And then that goes out to the plants.
[21:47.300 --> 21:52.300]  And I do that probably at least like every cycle,
[21:52.420 --> 21:53.260]  like at the beginning.
[21:53.260 --> 21:55.580]  And sometimes I do it going into flower again,
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.820]  like depending on like what the plants are looking like.
[21:57.820 --> 21:59.860]  Sometimes they need that little extra boost
[21:59.860 --> 22:04.860]  of biological activity to really get that nutrient breakdown
[22:04.940 --> 22:08.300]  and help with the transition into flower.
[22:11.730 --> 22:14.250]  I got an off topic question real quick.
[22:14.250 --> 22:16.650]  I saw a glimpse of your shirt and I wanted to know,
[22:16.650 --> 22:19.330]  is that MJ shirt, Brothers Grow Too?
[22:19.330 --> 22:21.130]  No, this is Dr. Steve's shirt.
[22:21.130 --> 22:23.770]  Oh, right on.
[22:23.770 --> 22:24.970]  I was hoping it was the Afro.
[22:24.970 --> 22:26.210]  I didn't know if you had that same shirt.
[22:26.210 --> 22:28.610]  I think three of us had that shirt from that one day.
[22:28.610 --> 22:31.250]  So I was hoping that was it.
[22:31.250 --> 22:33.250]  Yeah, he's a cool dude though.
[22:33.250 --> 22:34.850]  He's always been friendly to me and stuff.
[22:34.850 --> 22:37.690]  I did not get to grab one of his shirts though,
[22:37.690 --> 22:38.570]  unfortunately.
[22:40.890 --> 22:44.050]  So, you know, let's kind of get more into
[22:44.050 --> 22:46.250]  what it's going to take to, you know,
[22:46.850 --> 22:50.050]  like when you were saying you start to see certain genetics
[22:50.050 --> 22:51.910]  that are keepers and those aren't.
[22:51.910 --> 22:53.130]  I know that a lot of the viewers,
[22:53.130 --> 22:56.610]  they really want to pick your brain on what catches your eye
[22:56.610 --> 22:57.850]  when you're walking through the garden,
[22:57.850 --> 22:59.610]  when you're seeing certain plants perk up,
[22:59.610 --> 23:03.250]  is there leaf structure, stem,
[23:03.250 --> 23:04.650]  the width of a stem or something?
[23:04.650 --> 23:06.610]  Is there just certain things that stick out to you
[23:06.610 --> 23:08.730]  that are tried and true every time
[23:08.730 --> 23:10.890]  you walk into your garden?
[23:10.890 --> 23:11.730]  Well, I think, you know,
[23:11.730 --> 23:13.710]  the first thing I look at is the structure.
[23:13.710 --> 23:14.790]  And then, you know, after that,
[23:14.790 --> 23:17.390]  I'm automatically going to the turps, you know,
[23:17.390 --> 23:21.150]  and like I rub the stems and stuff a little bit,
[23:21.150 --> 23:22.190]  but I mean, you know,
[23:22.190 --> 23:24.470]  stem turps are good for breeding stem turps.
[23:24.470 --> 23:26.510]  You know, you gotta put the resin going
[23:26.510 --> 23:29.030]  to really see what the turps are gonna be like
[23:29.030 --> 23:31.270]  and, you know, experience those.
[23:31.270 --> 23:33.870]  So, I mean, that's the, to me, like I said,
[23:33.870 --> 23:35.470]  so the structure, that's the first thing
[23:35.470 --> 23:36.710]  that's gonna catch my eye.
[23:36.710 --> 23:38.030]  You know, how's the nodes facing?
[23:38.030 --> 23:39.790]  How are the nugs filling in?
[23:39.790 --> 23:41.090]  And then after that, it's gonna be,
[23:41.090 --> 23:42.190]  what are the turps like?
[23:42.190 --> 23:45.470]  You know, that's my first like question basically
[23:45.470 --> 23:47.390]  is it's always about the turps
[23:47.390 --> 23:51.310]  and it's gotta pass the turps test.
[23:51.310 --> 23:55.030]  Otherwise it's just, I mean, it's nothing at that point.
[23:55.030 --> 23:56.350]  You know, I'd rather grow something
[23:56.350 --> 23:58.750]  that's like a little bit smaller
[23:58.750 --> 24:02.630]  and like maybe not like a super like crazy plant,
[24:02.630 --> 24:03.650]  like structure wise.
[24:03.650 --> 24:05.030]  But I mean, if it's got turps
[24:05.030 --> 24:06.990]  that you're not finding anywhere else,
[24:06.990 --> 24:08.230]  like there's something to that.
[24:08.230 --> 24:10.590]  And I'm, you know, that's something that I'll seek out
[24:10.590 --> 24:12.430]  and I'll try to improve the structure on
[24:12.430 --> 24:15.470]  and, you know, maybe maintain that terpene profile
[24:15.470 --> 24:18.070]  and then, you know, make something with that.
[24:19.670 --> 24:21.550]  And it seems like you really have that dialed in
[24:21.550 --> 24:24.030]  because your stuff always just is memorable.
[24:24.030 --> 24:25.710]  You know, there's a lot of people that just,
[24:25.710 --> 24:27.870]  hey man, that guy over there in the corner,
[24:27.870 --> 24:29.390]  that was kind of how you were described,
[24:29.390 --> 24:31.110]  at least to me during that night.
[24:31.110 --> 24:32.910]  That guy over there has got the fire.
[24:32.910 --> 24:34.110]  I'm like, yeah, great, man.
[24:34.110 --> 24:36.550]  He's, you know, it was just great to see
[24:36.550 --> 24:38.790]  that so many people were enjoying it.
[24:38.790 --> 24:39.950]  Especially at that time, man,
[24:40.310 --> 24:41.510]  I don't know if even here in Denver,
[24:41.510 --> 24:44.350]  everybody who had access or had even seen
[24:44.350 --> 24:48.430]  that amount of quality in one big jar before.
[24:49.450 --> 24:52.470]  I think that, I mean, like for me,
[24:52.470 --> 24:55.430]  Colorado is like kind of like what sets the stage
[24:55.430 --> 24:57.590]  for solventless hash, at least for my scene.
[24:57.590 --> 25:01.010]  Like when I got out there, like I first got out in Colorado,
[25:01.010 --> 25:02.950]  like I think it was like 2015.
[25:02.950 --> 25:06.470]  And I mean, hash was like, I don't know,
[25:06.470 --> 25:07.910]  it was in its younger stages still.
[25:07.910 --> 25:09.030]  Like people were, you know,
[25:09.030 --> 25:10.670]  it was hard to find good full melts
[25:10.670 --> 25:12.630]  and it was hard to even find good rosin.
[25:12.630 --> 25:16.310]  A lot of it was like flower rosin or I don't know,
[25:16.310 --> 25:17.630]  there's just a lot of stuff going on.
[25:17.630 --> 25:19.210]  There was like a few good companies,
[25:19.210 --> 25:22.470]  like they would do some rec drops and stuff.
[25:22.470 --> 25:25.150]  Like I remember going to that, like standing Akimbo place
[25:25.150 --> 25:25.990]  and like, you know,
[25:25.990 --> 25:28.990]  trying to get like the craft rosin drops and stuff,
[25:28.990 --> 25:30.610]  like at that time.
[25:30.610 --> 25:32.670]  And like, that was good stuff for that time.
[25:32.670 --> 25:36.710]  And I think that there's a lot of like pioneering,
[25:36.710 --> 25:39.390]  you know, hash people in Colorado, you know,
[25:39.390 --> 25:40.630]  and they were at that time.
[25:40.630 --> 25:43.050]  And I think it's only increased since then.
[25:43.050 --> 25:46.270]  I think the hash movement has significantly grown
[25:46.270 --> 25:47.830]  and I think it will continue to grow
[25:47.830 --> 25:50.750]  because it's really for all smokers.
[25:50.750 --> 25:52.990]  I mean, even if you prefer flower,
[25:52.990 --> 25:55.410]  there's a special experience that can be brought to you
[25:55.410 --> 25:56.430]  through the hash, you know,
[25:56.430 --> 26:00.190]  it really allows you to have the live plant experience.
[26:03.040 --> 26:03.880]  Oh.
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.660]  Uh oh, what happened?
[26:06.680 --> 26:07.520]  What's that?
[26:07.520 --> 26:08.760]  It disappeared.
[26:08.760 --> 26:10.760]  Somebody clicked the wrong button or something.
[26:10.760 --> 26:14.260]  So while that was going on, I was queuing up.
[26:16.120 --> 26:17.560]  Give me one second.
[26:18.800 --> 26:21.000]  All right, I'm dropping it again, you guys.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.920]  Anybody out there who's in California,
[26:23.920 --> 26:28.520]  go to vccompost.com and send us a sample.
[26:28.520 --> 26:30.800]  All right, we're really going for this.
[26:30.800 --> 26:32.160]  I'm gonna get the, you know,
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.060]  make a splash for our first one.
[26:36.240 --> 26:38.000]  Give me one second.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.600]  And funny, you brought up that t-shirt, Brian.
[26:40.600 --> 26:43.360]  Pauline recently bought me a t-shirt that said,
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.440]  the world is made up of, what was it, honey?
[26:47.800 --> 26:51.380]  Protons, electrons, neutrons, and morons.
[26:51.380 --> 26:54.320]  Talking about morons all the time.
[26:54.320 --> 26:55.160]  There he is, he's back.
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.040]  I'm disconnected, I'm sorry.
[26:57.040 --> 26:57.880]  I'm back.
[26:57.880 --> 26:58.720]  All right, cool.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.560]  Keep going.
[26:59.560 --> 27:00.380]  No worries, brother.
[27:01.220 --> 27:02.060]  Cool.
[27:05.840 --> 27:08.360]  Any questions or like, I don't know.
[27:08.360 --> 27:09.480]  We were on the Terps.
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.840]  Yeah, you were on a roll, man.
[27:12.840 --> 27:14.920]  We want you to embrace the awkward silence.
[27:14.920 --> 27:17.520]  We're all just gonna be quiet until you start talking.
[27:17.520 --> 27:21.360]  No, Andrew, seriously, go back on that roll
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.080]  about the Terps and bringing the flower out as a hash
[27:26.080 --> 27:28.200]  so that you do get that fresh flower.
[27:28.920 --> 27:29.760]  So.
[27:29.760 --> 27:31.640]  So basically, what I was saying is,
[27:31.640 --> 27:33.840]  so like, you know, even like the flower smokers
[27:33.840 --> 27:35.720]  and the traditionalists, like, you know,
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.640]  you like flower and flower is great.
[27:37.640 --> 27:39.200]  And there's always those different Terps
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.840]  you can taste in flower to where you're like,
[27:41.840 --> 27:43.840]  you know, this is a strain I like more than this one.
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.560]  But I'd say that live rosin and live hash
[27:47.560 --> 27:49.360]  takes that up to a whole nother level.
[27:49.360 --> 27:52.800]  And it's just, I'd say it's almost an exact
[27:52.800 --> 27:56.640]  like terpene replica of what you're seeing on the plant.
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.520]  Like when you're finishing flower
[27:58.520 --> 28:00.360]  and you're just capturing that essence
[28:00.360 --> 28:02.960]  and putting it in a jar that, you know,
[28:02.960 --> 28:05.360]  will keep that essence fresh for, you know,
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.560]  a really long time, you know,
[28:06.560 --> 28:08.520]  depending how you store it and whatnot.
[28:11.620 --> 28:12.820]  So you pretty much,
[28:14.060 --> 28:16.460]  you pretty much grow everything to wash them.
[28:16.460 --> 28:18.460]  Is that a good assumption?
[28:18.460 --> 28:20.740]  I do pull stuff for flower, you know,
[28:20.740 --> 28:21.940]  and I do pull a little bit of flower
[28:21.940 --> 28:23.060]  and that's like kind of something
[28:23.060 --> 28:24.700]  that I've been increasing on a little bit.
[28:24.700 --> 28:28.020]  But yeah, my background, I've always washed everything.
[28:28.540 --> 28:29.460]  Everything's always hit the freezer.
[28:29.460 --> 28:30.980]  Everything's always gone into the water.
[28:30.980 --> 28:34.580]  There was never like, this is for hash, you know,
[28:34.580 --> 28:35.860]  it's always all been for hash
[28:35.860 --> 28:39.020]  and maybe a couple of branches are for flower.
[28:39.020 --> 28:41.780]  You know, you started talking about grit.
[28:41.780 --> 28:43.700]  So can we go into that a little bit?
[28:43.700 --> 28:45.740]  Because, you know, that's something
[28:45.740 --> 28:48.100]  that's always fascinated me is that the trichomes
[28:48.100 --> 28:49.820]  are that strong that they can, you know,
[28:49.820 --> 28:52.720]  stay intact while you're rubbing them in your finger.
[28:53.740 --> 28:56.180]  Yeah, and that's one thing I do look at.
[28:56.180 --> 28:58.940]  And like a lot of times, like the best producing plants,
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.900]  like that sandiness is a great thing, like I said.
[29:01.900 --> 29:03.780]  But a lot of times, like the plants that will have
[29:03.780 --> 29:08.100]  even like higher returns from that hash into rosin
[29:08.100 --> 29:10.860]  are gonna be ones that like, where they're just fat heads,
[29:10.860 --> 29:12.500]  but they have like a stronger membrane
[29:12.500 --> 29:15.020]  where you're getting some of that tackiness.
[29:15.020 --> 29:17.500]  And you can kind of like squeeze the resin
[29:17.500 --> 29:18.780]  and lift your fingers apart.
[29:18.780 --> 29:22.020]  And you'll see like little strings coming off of the nub,
[29:22.020 --> 29:23.860]  like between your fingers.
[29:23.860 --> 29:28.580]  And like that to me has always been a really good sign
[29:28.580 --> 29:31.540]  for like hashability.
[29:34.100 --> 29:36.740]  So it's really like the spiderwebs
[29:36.740 --> 29:38.300]  that you're chasing after.
[29:39.140 --> 29:40.500]  In a way, I mean, yeah.
[29:40.500 --> 29:43.860]  But what was I gonna say?
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.700]  Fuck.
[29:47.100 --> 29:49.820]  You've been dabbing for the show, Andrew.
[29:49.820 --> 29:50.740]  A little bit, dude.
[29:50.740 --> 29:53.340]  You know how it goes.
[29:53.340 --> 29:54.420]  Yeah, for sure, bud.
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.260]  Yeah, always fresh frozen.
[29:57.260 --> 29:58.460]  That's key.
[29:58.460 --> 30:01.700]  Like there's nothing wrong with doing cured nub
[30:01.700 --> 30:03.540]  and I've done it for trim and stuff.
[30:03.540 --> 30:08.540]  But as far as profitability and representation of the plant,
[30:10.740 --> 30:12.820]  you're gonna see the best in fresh frozen.
[30:14.740 --> 30:15.900]  You wanna kind of explain that?
[30:15.900 --> 30:20.540]  I feel like a lot of people are pretty much confused
[30:20.540 --> 30:22.140]  when they start to get into things
[30:22.220 --> 30:24.660]  like why certain things cost so much.
[30:24.660 --> 30:26.020]  Do you wanna kind of break that down
[30:26.020 --> 30:28.940]  into what really goes into producing,
[30:28.940 --> 30:30.740]  if you'd love to show your jar again,
[30:30.740 --> 30:32.940]  what it really takes to produce something like that?
[30:32.940 --> 30:34.900]  Because I don't feel like all the viewers might know,
[30:34.900 --> 30:36.020]  especially when you're just,
[30:36.020 --> 30:38.260]  you're putting out 4%, 6%.
[30:38.260 --> 30:40.500]  They might not necessarily know exactly
[30:40.500 --> 30:42.780]  what you're talking about there, Andrew.
[30:42.780 --> 30:45.980]  Well, what I'm talking about when I'm talking like,
[30:45.980 --> 30:48.180]  percentages and whatnot is I'm talking
[30:49.180 --> 30:51.460]  about the weight of the hash that's yield
[30:52.540 --> 30:56.860]  divided by the weight of the wet material that was input.
[30:56.860 --> 30:59.780]  And that's where you get your yield, so to speak.
[30:59.780 --> 31:03.500]  And like something that would like,
[31:03.500 --> 31:05.940]  so basically when you're using fresh frozen,
[31:05.940 --> 31:10.220]  like there's, they say that there's like a four times
[31:11.620 --> 31:15.540]  shrinkage or expansion, you know, going from wet to dry.
[31:16.380 --> 31:19.660]  I don't know because I've never really like played with that
[31:19.660 --> 31:21.260]  so that's just what they say.
[31:21.260 --> 31:24.740]  And so basically, you know, supposedly like
[31:24.740 --> 31:28.860]  if you had something that's doing like 8%,
[31:28.860 --> 31:30.900]  you know, it would be like, you know,
[31:30.900 --> 31:32.780]  three to four times that.
[31:32.780 --> 31:35.820]  And if you were to cure it out and then run it.
[31:37.300 --> 31:39.660]  So essentially if you're getting a 5% yield,
[31:39.660 --> 31:44.060]  that's like getting like a 20% yield on cured nug.
[31:45.740 --> 31:48.060]  And let's go more into like the amount of work
[31:48.060 --> 31:50.780]  that it takes to even be able to get those yields.
[31:50.780 --> 31:53.820]  I mean, you have to have a quality canvas to start with.
[31:53.820 --> 31:56.580]  So what does it really take to get to that point?
[31:56.580 --> 31:57.860]  Because I feel like some people,
[31:57.860 --> 32:00.060]  especially when they fly into,
[32:00.060 --> 32:01.740]  I guess I just know about Denver,
[32:03.180 --> 32:05.860]  they're kind of sticker shocked sometimes,
[32:05.860 --> 32:07.820]  unless they're coming more from like the bigger cities
[32:07.820 --> 32:08.900]  on what that costs.
[32:08.900 --> 32:11.820]  So I'd love to hear from the, you know,
[32:11.820 --> 32:14.740]  the man himself of what kind of work really goes in
[32:14.780 --> 32:16.340]  to create something like that.
[32:17.260 --> 32:20.020]  Well, it's a lot of work and I'd say like
[32:20.020 --> 32:21.140]  more than it is work.
[32:21.140 --> 32:23.300]  I mean, there's a lot of striking out involved
[32:23.300 --> 32:24.700]  in like finding good winners.
[32:24.700 --> 32:27.580]  Like, I don't know, you're gonna make mistakes learning
[32:27.580 --> 32:29.580]  and it's gonna cost you material
[32:29.580 --> 32:33.340]  and it's gonna cost to find winners essentially.
[32:33.340 --> 32:34.700]  Because sometimes you will strike out
[32:34.700 --> 32:36.860]  and you'll find stuff that hits the bags
[32:36.860 --> 32:39.180]  and you know, you're hardly getting anything off of there.
[32:39.180 --> 32:41.500]  And it's really sad and it's really upsetting
[32:41.500 --> 32:44.260]  and it's gonna happen to everybody.
[32:44.780 --> 32:46.300]  But the more like you get to read the resin
[32:46.300 --> 32:48.060]  while it's still alive on the plant,
[32:48.060 --> 32:50.980]  the more you can avoid scenarios like that.
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.780]  So how much like time and effort, I mean,
[32:55.780 --> 33:00.260]  to wash all this stuff, this is taking you hours, correct?
[33:00.260 --> 33:02.060]  Yeah, I mean, the growing is,
[33:02.060 --> 33:03.060]  I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you,
[33:03.060 --> 33:04.460]  the growing is the hardest part
[33:04.460 --> 33:06.580]  and getting the conditions dialed down.
[33:06.580 --> 33:10.900]  Like being a hash maker is all about keeping things clean
[33:10.900 --> 33:15.220]  and taking the, you know, the grower's product,
[33:15.220 --> 33:17.300]  what they give you and really just sharpening it
[33:17.300 --> 33:20.060]  and demonstrating their quality, you know?
[33:20.060 --> 33:21.700]  So, I mean, a great hash maker
[33:21.700 --> 33:23.620]  is just gonna be a great cleaner
[33:23.620 --> 33:26.380]  and just able to, you know, transfer
[33:26.380 --> 33:28.540]  and able to keep it clean and to begin with,
[33:28.540 --> 33:31.820]  like, and just bring it through the process in one piece
[33:31.820 --> 33:33.060]  without degrading quality
[33:33.060 --> 33:35.860]  and getting them the max back from their work.
[33:35.860 --> 33:39.460]  And I mean, really like 99% of the work
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.580]  is done in the garden.
[33:41.260 --> 33:42.380]  Like, you know, the color of the hash,
[33:42.380 --> 33:43.780]  that's like a garden thing.
[33:44.860 --> 33:46.700]  The meltability, that's a garden thing.
[33:46.700 --> 33:48.560]  The turps, that's a garden thing.
[33:49.940 --> 33:52.220]  And it also comes down to the grower to,
[33:52.220 --> 33:56.340]  you know, prep that stuff nicely.
[33:56.340 --> 33:59.820]  I mean, that's where like 90% of the quality is lost,
[33:59.820 --> 34:01.100]  like in these commercial settings
[34:01.100 --> 34:02.960]  when they chop those plants down, you know?
[34:02.960 --> 34:05.140]  They're pretty much dragging them through the dirt
[34:05.140 --> 34:06.420]  in some of these scenarios
[34:06.420 --> 34:08.540]  and then they're sliding them across trimming tables
[34:08.540 --> 34:12.060]  and, you know, doing all kinds of stuff that breaks resin
[34:12.060 --> 34:14.660]  and ultimately decreases what's gonna end up in the bags
[34:14.660 --> 34:15.700]  in one piece.
[34:18.080 --> 34:19.400]  Yeah, at the commercial level,
[34:19.400 --> 34:21.100]  it's definitely not about turpines.
[34:21.100 --> 34:23.460]  I mean, they let plants hit the floor
[34:23.460 --> 34:25.460]  and they pick them up the next day kind of thing.
[34:25.460 --> 34:29.620]  So, you know, our discussion today is really more for,
[34:29.620 --> 34:31.860]  you know, I feel like the smaller farmer,
[34:31.860 --> 34:35.300]  the tent grower that's wanting to kind of learn
[34:35.300 --> 34:38.340]  from you in a way and learn from everybody else on the show
[34:39.100 --> 34:42.380]  is how do I, you know, get the canvas that I really need,
[34:42.380 --> 34:45.180]  which you just basically said was about 90% of,
[34:45.180 --> 34:48.980]  you know, your success is understanding how the plant grows
[34:48.980 --> 34:51.580]  and then taking it to the next level by washing it
[34:51.580 --> 34:53.740]  and understanding the genetics that wash
[34:53.740 --> 34:55.280]  where you're gonna get the yields
[34:55.280 --> 34:57.060]  that are going to be able to be fruitful
[34:57.060 --> 35:00.420]  so you can continue down that process.
[35:00.420 --> 35:01.800]  And I feel like for a lot of people,
[35:01.800 --> 35:03.140]  when they start to wash,
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.660]  that's one of the biggest hiccups that they have
[35:05.700 --> 35:09.940]  is they have a few times where it's not successful
[35:09.940 --> 35:11.580]  and then they're like, ah, fuck this.
[35:11.580 --> 35:13.700]  So I feel like it is a lot of tried and true
[35:13.700 --> 35:16.660]  and almost artwork, if you will,
[35:16.660 --> 35:20.560]  for you guys that are really got it dialed in like that.
[35:20.560 --> 35:22.140]  Yeah, I mean, like I said,
[35:22.140 --> 35:23.860]  like the work is done in selection
[35:23.860 --> 35:25.940]  and it's done in the grow room, you know,
[35:25.940 --> 35:28.540]  and everything else is just maintaining that product
[35:28.540 --> 35:30.020]  and keeping it clean.
[35:30.020 --> 35:33.420]  And yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.
[35:33.660 --> 35:35.740]  I mean, washing is pretty easy.
[35:35.740 --> 35:37.300]  You know, you gotta keep everything cold
[35:37.300 --> 35:40.080]  and that's pretty much it, cold and clean.
[35:41.740 --> 35:45.800]  You washing in garbage cans or you do smaller?
[35:47.300 --> 35:48.660]  You know, so it depends what I'm doing.
[35:48.660 --> 35:50.940]  Like I'll use, like I'll bring out like the bubble magics
[35:50.940 --> 35:53.640]  for like single pheno testers and stuff.
[35:53.640 --> 35:55.460]  Like I'll just run, like all this stuff,
[35:55.460 --> 35:58.220]  like these were more like single plant runners.
[35:58.220 --> 36:00.820]  So, I mean, I just did these in like a bubble magic.
[36:01.660 --> 36:03.820]  So, that's pretty much it.
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.780]  That's really why I want, I mean,
[36:06.780 --> 36:08.740]  I want a lot of people to see that, you know,
[36:08.740 --> 36:11.700]  when you take the time to get the knowledge like you have,
[36:11.700 --> 36:13.260]  you can do this yourself.
[36:13.260 --> 36:15.860]  I mean, this is your next level, my friend.
[36:15.860 --> 36:19.380]  So, this is where I feel like as everyone gets older
[36:19.380 --> 36:20.900]  and it passes on to the newer,
[36:20.900 --> 36:24.620]  we wanna continue to spread that information.
[36:24.620 --> 36:26.560]  And I know that, you know,
[36:26.560 --> 36:28.820]  we had a mutual class with Chris Trump.
[36:28.820 --> 36:31.220]  Are there some other mentors that you feel like
[36:32.260 --> 36:33.820]  the viewers should start to learn up on
[36:33.820 --> 36:35.460]  that might not necessarily be known
[36:35.460 --> 36:38.060]  that you feel like has really stood out for you?
[36:38.060 --> 36:39.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:40.180 --> 36:43.020]  I think someone that's been really just like influential
[36:43.020 --> 36:45.540]  on my journey and, you know,
[36:45.540 --> 36:47.260]  probably one of the first people to really get me
[36:47.260 --> 36:49.120]  into like Korean natural farming
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.400]  and like implementing some of those things
[36:51.400 --> 36:53.460]  is a guy called Macho Melts.
[36:53.460 --> 36:55.060]  He's from Michigan.
[36:55.060 --> 36:57.860]  And he was like the first person
[36:57.860 --> 36:59.980]  to send me the Cho PDF.
[36:59.980 --> 37:03.100]  And like, you know, we were talking hash in those times
[37:03.100 --> 37:04.740]  and he was like, you know, check this out.
[37:04.740 --> 37:07.380]  You know, you can elevate your hash
[37:07.380 --> 37:09.100]  by growing more naturally.
[37:09.100 --> 37:12.420]  And, you know, he was right.
[37:12.420 --> 37:14.260]  I mean, that's been my life since then.
[37:14.260 --> 37:16.600]  I've been, you know, trying to become more natural
[37:16.600 --> 37:17.900]  and more sustainable.
[37:17.900 --> 37:20.620]  And that's led me to have better quality overall
[37:20.620 --> 37:21.900]  and also less overhead.
[37:21.900 --> 37:22.980]  I mean, you can get to a point
[37:22.980 --> 37:25.380]  to where you're just paying for your electricity pretty much.
[37:25.420 --> 37:27.580]  And, you know, some of the grow equipment.
[37:28.980 --> 37:30.300]  Yeah, and that's really, you know,
[37:30.300 --> 37:33.400]  the end goal I feel like for anybody that gets into it
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.220]  is we wanna get to the point where we're using water
[37:36.220 --> 37:38.860]  because we've built a living and thriving community.
[37:38.860 --> 37:40.980]  We might need a few amendments every now and then,
[37:40.980 --> 37:42.620]  but for the most part,
[37:42.620 --> 37:45.900]  it really can replicate nature on a microcosm scale.
[37:45.900 --> 37:47.420]  And you're able to produce the quality
[37:47.420 --> 37:48.860]  like you just showed in your jar.
[37:48.860 --> 37:51.600]  If you take the time yourself to educate
[37:52.040 --> 37:55.400]  and continue to focus on that canvas
[37:55.400 --> 37:57.040]  so that you can learn to wash.
[37:57.040 --> 38:00.760]  And then of course, wow, your friends with the baller jars
[38:00.760 --> 38:02.520]  is what they call them here in Denver.
[38:02.520 --> 38:04.040]  Is that still out there in Michigan, man?
[38:04.040 --> 38:05.220]  Is that that name?
[38:05.220 --> 38:06.520]  You got the baller jar?
[38:06.520 --> 38:09.120]  See the difference between like people out here,
[38:09.120 --> 38:10.640]  like they were like baller jars,
[38:10.640 --> 38:11.880]  like when I first got out here
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.920]  and they were talking about like eighths or quarters.
[38:13.920 --> 38:15.680]  And I, you know, like, I don't know,
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.840]  in Denver a baller jar was an ounce.
[38:17.840 --> 38:18.680]  Like I don't know.
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.440]  I saw those dudes back in the day, man.
[38:23.440 --> 38:24.760]  They'd be passing that stuff out.
[38:24.760 --> 38:26.720]  Like it was crazy.
[38:27.920 --> 38:31.200]  It was really fun to, I really missed that to be honest.
[38:31.200 --> 38:33.520]  I almost felt like I was reminiscing there for a minute,
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.280]  but just hanging out with everybody where we didn't have-
[38:37.280 --> 38:40.600]  Like the mid 2000, like tens in like the Denver area
[38:40.600 --> 38:43.320]  were a really special time in canvas and in hash.
[38:43.320 --> 38:45.880]  Like a lot of people came up in that time
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.000]  and like a lot of great companies like came to fruition.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.920]  And I think like hash just like took one big step
[38:52.920 --> 38:54.880]  in like in that decade.
[38:54.880 --> 38:56.440]  Like there was people doing it before,
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.480]  like going into 2010, you know,
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.760]  like Matt Rise and like Nickity and, you know,
[39:01.760 --> 39:03.560]  some of the really famous guys that, you know,
[39:03.560 --> 39:05.060]  have been doing it for a while.
[39:06.060 --> 39:07.400]  You know, they were doing some stuff,
[39:07.400 --> 39:09.200]  but it really didn't pick up, you know,
[39:09.200 --> 39:13.160]  on mainstream till, you know, later in the decade.
[39:13.160 --> 39:15.120]  And, you know, now, I mean, it's still,
[39:15.120 --> 39:16.920]  I feel it's still like a young thing.
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.120]  And, you know, I think the consumer base
[39:21.120 --> 39:23.800]  is just ever growing, you know, for those products.
[39:23.800 --> 39:25.600]  And it's, I think it's something
[39:25.600 --> 39:28.480]  that's gonna keep expanding as people keep, you know,
[39:28.480 --> 39:32.800]  going down the journey as a stoner, so to speak, you know,
[39:32.800 --> 39:34.120]  because stoners, they just,
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.240]  they're looking for the next level of quality.
[39:36.240 --> 39:39.200]  You know, the next level is smoke and, you know,
[39:39.200 --> 39:41.400]  that's gonna take you to solventless hash eventually.
[39:41.400 --> 39:42.640]  That's just how it works.
[39:43.640 --> 39:47.360]  You know, it's funny, Bubble Man
[39:47.360 --> 39:50.520]  really made a point years back saying that, you know,
[39:50.520 --> 39:51.800]  he smoked tons of it.
[39:51.800 --> 39:55.640]  He was a heavy consumer, but he didn't,
[39:55.640 --> 39:59.800]  it wasn't until he smoked some living soils,
[40:01.480 --> 40:04.960]  bull melt, that it really just sat him down in a chair.
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.440]  And I think, you know, what you're doing is, you know,
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.880]  again, is the beauty of where it should be coming from,
[40:11.880 --> 40:14.160]  not a synthetic, because it's just,
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.040]  the quality has gone through the roof
[40:16.040 --> 40:18.080]  because you've concentrated something
[40:18.080 --> 40:20.800]  that came from a living soil system.
[40:20.800 --> 40:23.200]  So I, you know, I can't speak highly enough about that.
[40:23.200 --> 40:25.460]  If you're gonna take the time to wash it,
[40:25.460 --> 40:27.440]  you're crazy to be growing it synthetically.
[40:27.440 --> 40:29.920]  You really need to be growing it in a living soil.
[40:29.920 --> 40:32.840]  And the other thing, you know, about that is like,
[40:32.840 --> 40:36.120]  I've seen people have great concentrates with synthetic,
[40:36.120 --> 40:39.240]  but I mean, they're not really gonna be hitting like,
[40:39.240 --> 40:40.720]  you know, the higher spectrum.
[40:40.800 --> 40:42.680]  Like some of the people will see my yields and be like,
[40:42.680 --> 40:45.000]  holy shit, your yields are so crazy.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.440]  Like, you know, how do you do that?
[40:46.440 --> 40:49.120]  And like this and that, when it's really like, you know,
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.120]  certain people are like growing their plants
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.560]  to push like plant weight per light.
[40:54.560 --> 40:56.840]  And they're not thinking about the resin, you know?
[40:56.840 --> 41:00.640]  And like your best resin is gonna be formed on like smaller
[41:00.640 --> 41:02.760]  and more open nugs to where you can get more
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.280]  of that really high melting resin on the first pole,
[41:06.280 --> 41:08.220]  you know, because as you're, you know,
[41:08.220 --> 41:11.540]  growing these souped up nugs that are really nice
[41:11.540 --> 41:13.800]  and like big and dense,
[41:15.380 --> 41:18.100]  you're just kind of locking out the resin on the inside
[41:18.100 --> 41:21.180]  and you're gonna get, you know, some good resin
[41:21.180 --> 41:23.380]  on the outside on those synthetic gardens, you know,
[41:23.380 --> 41:24.260]  when they're done right.
[41:24.260 --> 41:26.120]  But then you're gonna have to work really hard
[41:26.120 --> 41:29.500]  to get those nugs open and get the rest of the resin,
[41:29.500 --> 41:34.500]  which is like usually a lower melt quality by quite a bit.
[41:35.500 --> 41:39.180]  And you usually have to be a, you know,
[41:39.180 --> 41:41.980]  a well-established synthetic farmer
[41:41.980 --> 41:43.380]  to start to hit those levels.
[41:43.380 --> 41:46.020]  So if someone's starting out, that's why, you know,
[41:46.020 --> 41:48.780]  we're big proponents here on the show of always trying
[41:48.780 --> 41:50.380]  to introduce newer farmers to,
[41:50.380 --> 41:52.460]  hey, use the microbial world.
[41:52.460 --> 41:55.980]  Mother nature makes it a lot easier for you to try to,
[41:55.980 --> 41:57.820]  you know, we might not fully understand everything
[41:57.820 --> 42:01.340]  that's going on, but we understand the basics enough
[42:01.340 --> 42:04.140]  when we start to farm that we can see it with our own eyes
[42:04.780 --> 42:06.380]  and then Leighton and I are huge on, you know,
[42:06.380 --> 42:08.300]  teaching everybody to trust the process.
[42:08.300 --> 42:09.460]  And that's one of the hardest things,
[42:09.460 --> 42:11.820]  especially when you're maybe making the transition
[42:11.820 --> 42:15.620]  from synthetics is because the plants relied on you so much.
[42:15.620 --> 42:16.460]  I agree.
[42:16.460 --> 42:20.280]  And I mean, it's hard getting in the,
[42:20.280 --> 42:22.220]  like using all the ends of the process
[42:22.220 --> 42:23.220]  and really trusting it.
[42:23.220 --> 42:26.020]  Cause like, I know a lot of people like that run synthetic,
[42:26.020 --> 42:28.820]  they're used to keeping like a certain level of cleanliness
[42:28.820 --> 42:31.900]  and, you know, maybe not putting something
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.780]  that smells a little funny on their plant.
[42:34.420 --> 42:38.220]  Cause it's natural and, you know, that sort of thing.
[42:38.220 --> 42:41.620]  Like people are, they're off put by the natural aspect
[42:41.620 --> 42:44.540]  of growing naturally or organically.
[42:44.540 --> 42:46.340]  Yeah. Isn't that crazy how that is?
[42:46.340 --> 42:47.180]  You know, it's like,
[42:47.180 --> 42:49.860]  Yeah, they want to see it like be like, you know,
[42:49.860 --> 42:52.100]  not natural and they want to have like, you know,
[42:52.100 --> 42:56.020]  all these like sugary smelling inputs that they're using.
[42:56.020 --> 42:59.020]  And I mean, not to say that KNF has great sugary inputs,
[42:59.020 --> 43:00.420]  but like some of the stuff that like,
[43:00.420 --> 43:03.460]  I remember smelling like on synthetic was like,
[43:04.140 --> 43:05.540]  I don't know, it was crazy smelling.
[43:06.860 --> 43:08.500]  Trust the process.
[43:09.940 --> 43:10.780]  No, but you know,
[43:10.780 --> 43:13.140]  That's what Philly fans keep telling themselves.
[43:15.140 --> 43:16.220]  You know, it's funny though,
[43:16.220 --> 43:19.860]  that once you get that living soil system up,
[43:19.860 --> 43:21.100]  then it's a lot easier.
[43:21.100 --> 43:23.860]  And that's, that's the part where, you know,
[43:23.860 --> 43:25.940]  we can't pound that home enough
[43:25.940 --> 43:29.300]  that the system will begin to balance itself.
[43:29.300 --> 43:30.860]  And that's where it's really important.
[43:30.860 --> 43:33.060]  You start with good ingredients, you know,
[43:33.660 --> 43:35.300]  good soils, you know,
[43:35.300 --> 43:39.100]  a functioning soil system that has the diversity there
[43:39.100 --> 43:41.300]  to provide that microbial foods
[43:41.300 --> 43:44.380]  for that diverse microbial inoculum.
[43:44.380 --> 43:48.340]  And if you start there, you start with good materials,
[43:48.340 --> 43:50.420]  you get yourself some really good inoculants,
[43:50.420 --> 43:51.820]  you know, you'll be off to the races.
[43:51.820 --> 43:54.720]  I mean, look at the farm in Colorado, Parachute.
[43:54.720 --> 43:55.940]  They never even grew weed.
[43:55.940 --> 43:58.220]  That was their first time growing weed.
[43:58.220 --> 43:59.420]  And they knocked it out of the park
[43:59.420 --> 44:02.260]  because again, they had Chris Trump's guidance.
[44:02.260 --> 44:04.860]  They used the Horizonal Soil System.
[44:04.860 --> 44:06.900]  They used AMO products.
[44:06.900 --> 44:08.020]  They used some of my product
[44:08.020 --> 44:09.960]  and they used all of Chris's products.
[44:09.960 --> 44:12.780]  So they created the diversity necessary
[44:12.780 --> 44:15.500]  to really get you up and running on the first run.
[44:15.500 --> 44:18.100]  And I think that's the big mistake with these,
[44:18.100 --> 44:18.980]  with these salt growers.
[44:18.980 --> 44:20.580]  They're, they're, they're scared.
[44:20.580 --> 44:22.580]  They don't understand what, what it is that,
[44:22.580 --> 44:23.760]  you know, we're talking about.
[44:23.760 --> 44:25.820]  But if they just did a little research,
[44:25.820 --> 44:28.540]  they'd realize it's just as easy as salts,
[44:28.540 --> 44:31.340]  except for you don't have to waste as much money.
[44:31.340 --> 44:33.380]  And once you get that system up and running,
[44:33.380 --> 44:34.820]  it's gonna take care of itself.
[44:34.820 --> 44:37.780]  It's not gonna, you know, you're not fighting the pH.
[44:37.780 --> 44:40.300]  You're not fighting the nutrients
[44:40.300 --> 44:42.100]  or nutrient crash or lockout.
[44:42.100 --> 44:43.700]  It's just, it's functioning.
[44:43.700 --> 44:45.980]  It takes so much of the work out of it.
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.660]  Yeah, well said.
[44:47.660 --> 44:50.340]  And the end result is undeniable.
[44:50.340 --> 44:52.100]  Yeah, I remember like just fighting
[44:52.100 --> 44:53.860]  with those blue lab pens, you know,
[44:53.860 --> 44:55.860]  I had all those problems with the blue lab pen.
[44:55.860 --> 44:58.080]  I was always trying to pH my water
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.060]  and then I'd get these big swings in the soil
[45:00.060 --> 45:01.260]  when I was running synthetic.
[45:02.180 --> 45:03.020]  And like, I don't know,
[45:03.020 --> 45:04.140]  it was a bigger headache than what it is now.
[45:04.140 --> 45:06.500]  Now I can just run like regular water.
[45:06.500 --> 45:08.300]  I run my ferments and I, like I said,
[45:08.300 --> 45:10.740]  I give that biological treatment of, you know,
[45:10.740 --> 45:14.500]  the IMO and whatnot, every growth cycle
[45:14.500 --> 45:16.180]  or twice every growth cycle.
[45:16.180 --> 45:18.420]  And, you know, it keeps my bases covered.
[45:18.420 --> 45:22.820]  And it's a whole lot easier than trying to fight
[45:22.820 --> 45:26.140]  pH-ing water or, you know,
[45:26.140 --> 45:27.980]  a lot of those things that come with synthetic,
[45:27.980 --> 45:29.240]  you know, it's, you know,
[45:29.240 --> 45:32.000]  it seems appealing to follow the directions on a bottle,
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.400]  but if you just take the leap of faith
[45:34.400 --> 45:36.120]  and, you know, get a little bit of understanding
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.000]  into the organic system, you know,
[45:38.000 --> 45:39.000]  you're gonna come out on top
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.880]  and it's gonna work out good for you.
[45:42.440 --> 45:43.880]  Thank you for pounding that home.
[45:43.880 --> 45:45.480]  That was good.
[45:45.480 --> 45:47.040]  Hopefully people are listening.
[45:48.840 --> 45:51.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's really hard pursuing it
[45:51.040 --> 45:53.800]  at the beginning, you, and they are,
[45:53.800 --> 45:56.240]  like the synthetic world's breaking it down week by week.
[45:56.240 --> 45:58.600]  So it's like, you know, week one, week two, week three.
[45:58.960 --> 46:02.000]  That seems like a better system, I will admit at first.
[46:02.920 --> 46:06.560]  And a lot of us, you know, especially the older growers,
[46:06.560 --> 46:08.320]  that is exactly how we started to grow
[46:08.320 --> 46:10.680]  because that was the only way that we were taught to grow.
[46:10.680 --> 46:12.060]  You know, there was no way that we were gonna be
[46:12.060 --> 46:12.920]  on the internet.
[46:12.920 --> 46:15.680]  There's no way we're gonna go to the library
[46:15.680 --> 46:16.500]  or something like that.
[46:16.500 --> 46:18.660]  Barnes and Noble wasn't selling cannabis books
[46:18.660 --> 46:20.240]  on the bookshelves yet.
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.360]  So basically it was a high times magazine back then
[46:22.360 --> 46:23.360]  or just with your friends.
[46:23.360 --> 46:25.400]  And that's again, where a lot of that bro science
[46:25.400 --> 46:27.080]  came from is because we were all just trying
[46:27.080 --> 46:28.960]  to figure this out together.
[46:28.960 --> 46:31.360]  But now there's a new paradigm shift,
[46:31.360 --> 46:33.520]  especially with YouTube and all of the ways
[46:33.520 --> 46:34.920]  that we can educate one another.
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.720]  And I feel like the faster that this information gets out,
[46:38.720 --> 46:41.440]  I think more and more people are going to take hold on this
[46:41.440 --> 46:44.960]  when they begin to farm because they can see down the road
[46:44.960 --> 46:46.240]  that they're gonna be able to cultivate
[46:46.240 --> 46:48.880]  the kind of cannabis that they want, you know,
[46:48.880 --> 46:50.840]  their dispensary to give them.
[46:50.840 --> 46:52.960]  But unfortunately, especially here in Colorado,
[46:52.960 --> 46:56.700]  unless you're a few brands, there's not a lot of people
[46:57.320 --> 46:58.260]  that are keeping up with the quality
[46:58.260 --> 47:00.100]  that Andrew's producing.
[47:00.100 --> 47:02.380]  And these people are, you know,
[47:02.380 --> 47:04.260]  backed by millions and millions of dollars,
[47:04.260 --> 47:06.400]  some of them tens of millions of dollars.
[47:06.400 --> 47:08.380]  So that's the other part that I really enjoy
[47:08.380 --> 47:11.780]  about our little community is I feel like the real artists
[47:11.780 --> 47:14.940]  are still here sharing with that community.
[47:14.940 --> 47:18.020]  While that big ag, big commercial,
[47:18.020 --> 47:21.300]  they really aren't able to dial it in
[47:21.300 --> 47:24.580]  as well as they should be, to be honest.
[47:24.580 --> 47:26.980]  I think it comes down to too with that, you know,
[47:26.980 --> 47:29.300]  it's like I was saying before, like, you know,
[47:29.300 --> 47:31.140]  they get a lot of this weed and it's not too bad
[47:31.140 --> 47:33.460]  when it's finishing, but then they can't figure out
[47:33.460 --> 47:36.220]  how to get it all trimmed and fresh frozen on time
[47:36.220 --> 47:38.500]  to where, you know, things are getting overripe.
[47:38.500 --> 47:40.380]  They're short cutting the process
[47:40.380 --> 47:44.500]  and sacrificing resin in the process of that.
[47:46.020 --> 47:46.860]  You know.
[47:46.860 --> 47:47.980]  Definitely taking shortcuts.
[47:47.980 --> 47:49.580]  And that's why I want, you know,
[47:50.700 --> 47:51.860]  the majority of people to see,
[47:51.860 --> 47:53.900]  especially if you start at the beginning,
[47:54.220 --> 47:56.780]  if you don't take shortcuts and you're going out of your way
[47:56.780 --> 47:59.460]  to understand the A to Z process,
[47:59.460 --> 48:02.900]  within just a few years, you are gonna be light years ahead
[48:02.900 --> 48:06.740]  of really any farmer that started 10, 15 years ago
[48:07.580 --> 48:09.460]  that didn't continue to educate themselves.
[48:09.460 --> 48:10.780]  You're just gonna understand the plant
[48:10.780 --> 48:12.600]  on a whole different level.
[48:12.600 --> 48:14.640]  So I encourage you guys that if you haven't started
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.340]  to at least just start growing plants and see for yourself,
[48:18.340 --> 48:21.140]  grow one side with synthetics and one side
[48:21.140 --> 48:22.860]  with the microbial world,
[48:22.860 --> 48:24.860]  especially if you've never grown plants before.
[48:24.860 --> 48:27.620]  It's fantastic just to start to get your hands
[48:27.620 --> 48:30.300]  touching plants and seeing, like Andrew was mentioning,
[48:30.300 --> 48:31.740]  the structure and that kind of stuff,
[48:31.740 --> 48:34.100]  because you need a trained eye
[48:34.100 --> 48:36.340]  if you're really going to take your skillsets
[48:36.340 --> 48:37.260]  to the next level.
[48:39.300 --> 48:43.260]  Yeah. And you know, it's easy to just do one 30 gallon pot
[48:43.260 --> 48:44.300]  and just play with it.
[48:44.300 --> 48:45.600]  It really is.
[48:45.600 --> 48:49.940]  So, you know, grow some balls and go for it.
[48:50.780 --> 48:53.620]  What was Marco Grose?
[48:53.620 --> 48:55.260]  He's like, get off the bottles.
[48:55.260 --> 48:56.740]  No, he says, I love it.
[48:56.740 --> 48:58.600]  He says, bottles are for babies.
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.340]  Real men use jars.
[49:05.780 --> 49:06.980]  Nice, nice.
[49:08.180 --> 49:12.900]  So how long have you been in the living soils?
[49:12.900 --> 49:15.540]  Were you in it before you went to Chris's class
[49:15.540 --> 49:17.220]  or was that just kind of a-
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.380]  I was in it before that.
[49:19.380 --> 49:21.580]  And that was something that I did.
[49:21.580 --> 49:25.700]  I really wanted to learn more about the FAA process
[49:25.700 --> 49:30.060]  and also about the IMO 3 and some of those things.
[49:30.060 --> 49:32.100]  So that's really what I went there to go for.
[49:32.100 --> 49:33.860]  And I guess also the OHN,
[49:33.860 --> 49:37.300]  I really wanted to like see how he was doing his OHN
[49:37.300 --> 49:40.500]  because what I was doing before was not that, you know,
[49:40.500 --> 49:44.340]  it was more my interpretation from the PDF.
[49:44.340 --> 49:48.000]  And that was not necessarily a good thing.
[49:50.460 --> 49:53.540]  Did you have adverse reaction when you used it?
[49:53.540 --> 49:55.420]  No, I just don't think it was as effective.
[49:55.420 --> 49:58.260]  I think I was missing the ball, you know?
[49:58.260 --> 50:00.580]  And when I went to Chris Trump's class,
[50:00.580 --> 50:03.960]  it really helped me kind of sharpen out those things
[50:03.960 --> 50:06.940]  and ask some questions and, I don't know,
[50:06.940 --> 50:08.600]  be with other people that actually know
[50:08.600 --> 50:10.520]  what they're doing too and have done it before.
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.720]  And that was a really good thing for me.
[50:14.860 --> 50:18.860]  I really recommend any of Chris Trump's course,
[50:18.860 --> 50:21.140]  especially the hands-on one to anybody
[50:21.140 --> 50:24.860]  that's looking to learn about Korean natural farming.
[50:24.860 --> 50:29.700]  Yeah, those in-person classes at the bottom.
[50:29.700 --> 50:31.620]  He did one out in Connecticut for me.
[50:31.620 --> 50:32.860]  I invited him out to East,
[50:32.860 --> 50:35.340]  but no one was out there representing
[50:35.340 --> 50:36.580]  the natural farming community.
[50:36.580 --> 50:40.300]  And he came out and so I got to participate with one day.
[50:41.220 --> 50:43.220]  Fantastic, you could just give a ride.
[50:43.380 --> 50:46.020]  Everybody's learning from each other,
[50:46.020 --> 50:47.060]  looking at the skirts,
[50:47.060 --> 50:51.100]  elevating the understanding of what's going on.
[50:51.100 --> 50:53.420]  So it's really the best way to learn.
[50:53.420 --> 50:55.620]  You know, you can do it via video or YouTube,
[50:55.620 --> 50:57.900]  but if you have the opportunity,
[50:57.900 --> 51:00.140]  that'll be the best way.
[51:00.140 --> 51:02.020]  Because it's really next level.
[51:03.060 --> 51:03.900]  Yeah, absolutely.
[51:03.900 --> 51:05.460]  His YouTube videos are great,
[51:05.460 --> 51:06.660]  but yeah, the experience
[51:06.660 --> 51:08.500]  just takes it to a whole other level.
[51:10.700 --> 51:12.940]  We getting a little feedback there, Peter?
[51:13.700 --> 51:14.540]  Yeah, but we didn't want to interrupt
[51:14.540 --> 51:17.380]  because we were so happy to see Peter taking a dab live.
[51:17.380 --> 51:19.780]  We didn't want to interject.
[51:21.260 --> 51:22.500]  Good to see you, brother.
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.280]  So my, yeah, I had a lot going on there.
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.320]  I updated my credit card.
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.640]  And like, you know,
[51:39.640 --> 51:43.800]  like everywhere where you have recurring payments,
[51:43.800 --> 51:47.920]  you have to update and StreamYard was one of them.
[51:47.920 --> 51:49.840]  And so like, it kicked me out
[51:49.840 --> 51:51.560]  just as I was about to dab.
[51:51.560 --> 51:55.440]  And it's like, you need to update your credit card info.
[51:55.440 --> 51:57.520]  So I'm like looking for my credit card.
[51:57.520 --> 51:58.600]  And anyway,
[51:59.920 --> 52:03.240]  but yeah, Cheddar Bob with the peer pressure.
[52:04.880 --> 52:08.800]  So this is some Puffin solventless.
[52:08.800 --> 52:10.080]  I don't know if you can.
[52:10.080 --> 52:10.920]  No.
[52:11.920 --> 52:12.760]  You know.
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.600]  Kind of see the branding.
[52:13.600 --> 52:14.440]  A little better.
[52:14.440 --> 52:15.840]  You see the bird, the Puffin?
[52:15.840 --> 52:16.680]  Yeah.
[52:16.680 --> 52:17.520]  Oh, Puffin.
[52:17.520 --> 52:18.840]  Some Mac one.
[52:20.480 --> 52:23.480]  So anyway, I was choosing between that
[52:23.480 --> 52:28.280]  and some Rosin Tech,
[52:28.280 --> 52:32.080]  some talking trees, some Sunfire Farms.
[52:33.240 --> 52:34.800]  These are tough decisions.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.720]  You're gonna be the guy with the knapsack
[52:37.720 --> 52:39.480]  at all the expos now, Peter.
[52:41.920 --> 52:44.240]  I'm not a big dabber though.
[52:44.240 --> 52:45.440]  I like my flower.
[52:46.560 --> 52:47.400]  Fair enough.
[52:47.400 --> 52:49.200]  It takes a long time to be able to dab
[52:49.200 --> 52:50.480]  and hold a conversation.
[52:50.480 --> 52:52.000]  But we can help you with that.
[52:54.200 --> 52:55.560]  So I sealed the gap.
[52:58.160 --> 53:00.600]  I don't know if you saw that question earlier
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.640]  that I threw up about ferments.
[53:05.520 --> 53:06.560]  Pipes don't play.
[53:07.920 --> 53:09.280]  You gotta leave them up there, Peter,
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.320]  until we answer them.
[53:11.320 --> 53:12.360]  Yeah, let me.
[53:12.360 --> 53:14.080]  It's a lot of scrolling up.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.760]  If someone remembers the question in the chat.
[53:20.240 --> 53:21.080]  There you go.
[53:21.080 --> 53:21.920]  Help Peter out.
[53:21.920 --> 53:26.320]  There being some kind of question about the weekly-
[53:26.320 --> 53:27.880]  Oh, how often you apply.
[53:27.880 --> 53:28.720]  That's right.
[53:28.720 --> 53:30.720]  The application of ferments.
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.160]  So, I mean, this is like really everybody's thing
[53:35.160 --> 53:37.200]  that they can play with, in my opinion.
[53:37.200 --> 53:38.640]  There's some flexibility with it.
[53:39.040 --> 53:40.560]  In Korean malt-filled farming,
[53:41.760 --> 53:44.520]  some people like to spray their maintenance spray every day.
[53:44.520 --> 53:48.360]  And for me, I like to hit my maintenance spray
[53:48.360 --> 53:51.600]  probably, I don't know, maybe every other day.
[53:51.600 --> 53:53.960]  And sometimes I even let two days go between.
[53:53.960 --> 53:56.520]  But the key with that, for me,
[53:56.520 --> 54:00.000]  is I like to apply it an hour or two
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.800]  before the lights come on
[54:01.800 --> 54:05.120]  so it can kind of simulate a morning dew.
[54:05.120 --> 54:07.000]  And that seems to be a good way
[54:07.040 --> 54:11.320]  to get the plants to intake whatever I'm trying to give them.
[54:12.320 --> 54:14.000]  That's a great suggestion, dude.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.640]  I mean, that's an amazing suggestion.
[54:16.640 --> 54:20.640]  It's basically the functions of nature
[54:20.640 --> 54:23.920]  because when the plants get dew in the morning,
[54:23.920 --> 54:24.880]  they absorb it.
[54:24.880 --> 54:26.320]  It doesn't just naturally-
[54:28.760 --> 54:29.760]  Evaporate.
[54:29.760 --> 54:31.200]  Evaporate, thank you.
[54:31.200 --> 54:32.280]  Maybe I need a dab.
[54:33.520 --> 54:34.560]  I think that's a key thing,
[54:34.560 --> 54:37.080]  especially for people that live in drier states
[54:37.080 --> 54:38.880]  like Colorado, because if your plants
[54:38.880 --> 54:40.440]  aren't getting enough foliage moisture,
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.480]  they're gonna start to hate you.
[54:42.480 --> 54:45.440]  Like, you're gonna start to get some BPD and-
[54:45.440 --> 54:48.200]  That really is a major issue, man, out here.
[54:50.960 --> 54:55.080]  It's just, especially at the commercial level.
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.360]  So do you think that a farm can grow
[54:59.360 --> 55:01.680]  with your style and your techniques
[55:01.680 --> 55:04.280]  and scale it to a larger farm?
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Or do you think that the quality just will always be lost
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.440]  when it's at that scale?
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.600]  I think that it's very possible for people
[55:12.600 --> 55:14.640]  to actually grow the weed at that scale.
[55:14.640 --> 55:16.160]  But I think what happens is,
[55:16.160 --> 55:20.680]  it's hard to harvest all that material.
[55:20.680 --> 55:22.720]  Like I said, I think that's where a lot of people
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.560]  are gonna lose their quality when they try to do
[55:25.560 --> 55:27.440]  these giant ventures,
[55:28.200 --> 55:31.600]  where they're just pulling an excessive amount of cannabis.
[55:31.600 --> 55:33.640]  Just like those fucking Amazon buildings
[55:33.680 --> 55:34.880]  you see on the internet.
[55:35.920 --> 55:37.600]  Canopy buildings, and I don't know,
[55:37.600 --> 55:39.920]  it's like, how would somebody even like,
[55:39.920 --> 55:42.360]  how would you care for each of those plants in there?
[55:42.360 --> 55:45.240]  Pay somebody to care for each of those plants in there?
[55:45.240 --> 55:47.440]  You know, there's a point where,
[55:47.440 --> 55:50.360]  I feel like that the heart gets detached
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.840]  from what's actually going on in the growth process.
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.640]  Yeah, and then here comes all the pests and disease.
[55:58.640 --> 56:00.680]  It seems like that rears its ugly head
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.320]  when the passion isn't there
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  and it's just another plant.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.360]  Or it's just a paycheck.
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.680]  And that's, you know, he's spot on about that.
[56:09.680 --> 56:11.400]  Brian, we chop that up all the time.
[56:11.400 --> 56:12.240]  Yeah.
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.640]  About that connection to the plant.
[56:13.640 --> 56:16.480]  And the plant's alive, it's a sentient being.
[56:16.480 --> 56:18.720]  So if you're just treating it like money
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.800]  and this is just a job, there's no love being shared.
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.240]  And so therefore, it's not gonna wanna produce for you.
[56:26.240 --> 56:28.840]  So I think that, Andrew, you make a really good point
[56:28.840 --> 56:31.480]  that once you get to those scales where,
[56:31.480 --> 56:34.560]  you're just another number or employee
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.200]  who gives a shit, right?
[56:36.200 --> 56:39.200]  And that's the bad side of what we do.
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.320]  It's kinda like, you know, where we farm cows.
[56:42.320 --> 56:43.160]  We feed lots.
[56:43.160 --> 56:46.200]  I mean, you know, they're not healthy and they're stressed.
[56:46.200 --> 56:49.040]  So the minerals and vitamins aren't there.
[56:49.040 --> 56:51.120]  The feeds, you know, they're getting fed junk.
[56:51.120 --> 56:54.320]  And so the same idea with the cannabis plant.
[56:54.320 --> 56:56.840]  I mean, it is a living thing.
[56:56.840 --> 56:57.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[56:57.680 --> 57:00.480]  Layton, you need to adopt a cow from-
[57:01.680 --> 57:03.280]  One of the lot's up there.
[57:03.280 --> 57:06.320]  The Bakersfield Mega Cow Farms.
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.720]  And you think your girlfriend would be psyched
[57:09.720 --> 57:12.000]  if you were like, all right, so.
[57:12.000 --> 57:12.840]  Oh, she'd be all over.
[57:12.840 --> 57:15.280]  I just adopted a cow and it's gonna live with us.
[57:15.280 --> 57:16.280]  My landlady?
[57:16.280 --> 57:17.120]  Oh.
[57:17.120 --> 57:17.960]  My man.
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.400]  I was gonna say, do you have an HOA?
[57:21.400 --> 57:22.240]  Yeah, literally.
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.760]  I can almost spit and hit six houses out of my backyard.
[57:26.760 --> 57:29.840]  So I don't think it would go over so well.
[57:29.840 --> 57:33.400]  But-
[57:33.400 --> 57:38.400]  Just quickly, I wanna have the middle of the show segment
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.680]  where we bring on, if you give me one second.
[57:45.200 --> 57:47.680]  I was gonna try to answer that question too
[57:47.680 --> 57:49.440]  about the fogger.
[57:49.440 --> 57:52.680]  So Andy, how do you apply your foliars?
[57:55.000 --> 57:55.840]  Oh, what's that?
[57:56.360 --> 57:57.200]  There we go.
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.360]  All right, this is what I was, can you all see that?
[58:00.360 --> 58:03.560]  I kept trying to make it go live, but okay.
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.880]  So then, and I don't know if he wants his name mentioned.
[58:07.880 --> 58:12.000]  So this is in reference to last week's show.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.240]  So this is someone took what they learned
[58:14.240 --> 58:17.800]  or took what they heard last week and tried it.
[58:17.800 --> 58:20.160]  This was with Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[58:20.160 --> 58:21.760]  So someone tried the heat treat-
[58:21.760 --> 58:23.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[58:23.200 --> 58:24.800]  They're already praying.
[58:24.800 --> 58:26.960]  So I don't know if he's watching
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.520]  and he's cool with me saying who he is on Instagram.
[58:30.520 --> 58:32.400]  I will show his Instagram handle,
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.400]  but he's trying it out and likes the results so far.
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.160]  I mean, that's old tech, man.
[58:39.160 --> 58:40.200]  That's really old tech.
[58:40.200 --> 58:43.840]  And coming from a place that grows in massive greenhouses.
[58:44.920 --> 58:45.840]  That would work.
[58:45.840 --> 58:48.440]  It's old tech for us, Layton, and our peer group,
[58:48.440 --> 58:51.360]  but that's what we're really learning week by week
[58:51.360 --> 58:54.240]  is that a lot of these people, or maybe just in our world,
[58:54.680 --> 58:57.080]  we take for granted how much, especially you,
[58:57.080 --> 58:59.440]  probably take it granted how much you know.
[58:59.440 --> 59:01.680]  And so it's like, oh yeah, you probably know about that.
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.360]  But I feel like a lot of people
[59:03.360 --> 59:05.720]  are really starting to eat this up
[59:05.720 --> 59:09.480]  because of the fact that there's not a clear path
[59:09.480 --> 59:10.560]  to a lot of this.
[59:10.560 --> 59:12.160]  You would have to take information
[59:12.160 --> 59:13.960]  from a variety of different places
[59:13.960 --> 59:16.480]  to be able to get on that one path.
[59:16.480 --> 59:19.520]  And that has been extremely detrimental,
[59:19.520 --> 59:20.920]  I feel like, in these last few years
[59:20.920 --> 59:23.080]  for people to try to get, like Andrew,
[59:23.080 --> 59:24.680]  where they can take themselves
[59:24.680 --> 59:28.240]  and they understand A to Z, they're self-educated,
[59:28.240 --> 59:29.680]  and they're building brands
[59:29.680 --> 59:30.960]  and making a name for themselves.
[59:30.960 --> 59:32.720]  That is the, at least in our world,
[59:32.720 --> 59:34.320]  the American dream for us,
[59:34.320 --> 59:36.680]  is to stay out of all the bullshit and nonsense
[59:36.680 --> 59:38.520]  that we grew up in and do something
[59:38.520 --> 59:40.240]  that's giving back to the community
[59:40.240 --> 59:42.120]  and doing something positive.
[59:42.120 --> 59:44.080]  And that's really the main focus, I feel like,
[59:44.080 --> 59:46.200]  especially for a lot of these guys that have talent.
[59:46.200 --> 59:49.160]  We wanna get out there that they're creating beans now.
[59:49.160 --> 59:52.200]  They're creating quality products
[59:52.200 --> 59:54.360]  that people are willing to pay a premium for
[59:54.360 --> 59:58.400]  because they understand what it takes to get that product
[59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.640]  and what it takes to produce it
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.600]  at that high level of consistency.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.560]  It's craft.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.160]  It's the difference between a really nice craft beer
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.980]  and a can of friggin' Budweiser.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680]  It's night and day.
[01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:20.470]  I would say after the fall harvest would be amazing
[01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:22.550]  in Cali.
[01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.590]  Oh, there you go.
[01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.990]  How about we, when we have our guest on,
[01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:30.710]  we could probably ask that question live to our guests
[01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.910]  and maybe we could link up those two and have a cup.
[01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.270]  That'd be pretty fun.
[01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.430]  It'd be badass.
[01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:40.470]  So Andrew, what do you use for your foliar applications?
[01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.030]  You just using a backpack sprayer, a mister, or a fogger?
[01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:46.070]  I'm just using a backpack sprayer.
[01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.270]  I've been looking into getting a fogger
[01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.790]  because I do like the idea of getting down
[01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.270]  to the droplet size, even smaller.
[01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.750]  But yeah, I've been using it as a sprayer
[01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.350]  because I think it's easy to clean.
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:00.830]  It's easy to use.
[01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:02.030]  Gets the job done.
[01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.870]  I don't know.
[01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:05.590]  Do you use any surfactant like yucca, yucca extract?
[01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:07.990]  I have at certain points,
[01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.510]  but I've really just been kind of sticking
[01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:13.510]  to the Korean natural farming for the foliar sprays.
[01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:15.950]  I've been doing the maintenance spray,
[01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:20.990]  which is FPJ and OHN and vinegar.
[01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.150]  And I spray that all the time.
[01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:27.070]  And then I add fish to that as needed.
[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:30.910]  And I add calcium to that as needed
[01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:32.950]  and calfos to that as needed.
[01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.230]  But generally the maintenance spray
[01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.910]  is it's kind of been my go-to.
[01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.030]  For the most part, it's been providing my plants
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.990]  with moisture and yeah,
[01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.590]  I just think all good natural things.
[01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.110]  Like I said, the simulating of the dew
[01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:52.550]  and helping kind of round up its nutrient uptake
[01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.270]  between the soil and then also getting
[01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.630]  some of that foliage nutrient uptake,
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.230]  I think is just priceless.
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:02.790]  And just getting that peak plant health that you can get.
[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:06.230]  There's so many theories on that, Andrew.
[01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:11.150]  Like so many people, they make great concepts
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.590]  and pros and cons of why you should
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.350]  and why you shouldn't foiler feed.
[01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:18.110]  But it is interesting to hear
[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:19.190]  a lot of different perspectives.
[01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.550]  I personally like to foiler feed.
[01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:24.870]  I like to notice that the plants kind of perk up
[01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.870]  and I enjoy taking a shower.
[01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:29.270]  So I would imagine that my plants would as well.
[01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.750]  You take a shower with FPJ?
[01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:37.150]  Well, it's soap, right?
[01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:38.950]  So I guess it's whatever the equivalent.
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:39.790]  Fish hydrolysis.
[01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:45.110]  I think that Kevin Jodry demonstrated it best,
[01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:47.430]  up on his farm.
[01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.550]  He's got temperature swings, 80 degrees
[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.190]  between day and night.
[01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:55.630]  The wind can just get crazy hard up there.
[01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:58.910]  And he was struggling to get plants to produce,
[01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.990]  but then he switched to the phylo system
[01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:03.710]  and went pure foliar.
[01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:07.430]  Now he did have a good soil, a good healthy living soil.
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:08.750]  I've been up there, I smelled it.
[01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.070]  I could tell just by the texture
[01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:14.590]  that he had put a lot of love into that soil.
[01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.470]  But what was the game changer
[01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:19.110]  was when he went onto that foliar feeding,
[01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:21.390]  man, those plants just pushed.
[01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:24.750]  I got to go up there harvest last fall with him,
[01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.310]  spent the day up there chopping it up.
[01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.110]  And man, those things were stacked hard.
[01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:31.110]  Now, some of it has to do with the genetics,
[01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.910]  but I'm guaranteeing you that a lot of that,
[01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.950]  that ability for the plant to stack that hard
[01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:40.390]  came from that foliar applications of nutrients.
[01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.350]  So, no, I think it's the answer in a lot of ways.
[01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:46.870]  Layton, it feels like it's just a way for the farmer
[01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:48.830]  to kind of improve on mother nature.
[01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:51.310]  And if you have the skillset to make all the variety
[01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:53.190]  of different things, now again,
[01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:56.230]  you can kind of play around with that yourself.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.630]  An OG like Kevin Joddry has just gotten to the level
[01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:01.630]  where he has his system so dialed in
[01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.310]  that he's, again, it's an art.
[01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.150]  Yep.
[01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.150]  That man is an artist.
[01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:07.230]  And I agree.
[01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:10.270]  Brian, look, think of the energy currency
[01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:12.430]  that's required to take that sunlight,
[01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.230]  break it into a ATP, shoot it up,
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:21.190]  create enzymes, peptides, exudates,
[01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.710]  all these different pieces that the plant needs to do.
[01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:28.470]  Push 70% of that energy into exudate production,
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:31.110]  grow out the biology, wait for the biology to mineral,
[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.150]  mine the nutrients the plant's looking for,
[01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.750]  take it all the way back up,
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.070]  push it out and distribute it throughout the plant.
[01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:40.350]  That's a tremendous amount of energy.
[01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:42.270]  And if you're feeding it foliarly,
[01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.470]  you're not required to spend that energy.
[01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:47.670]  The plant isn't required to spend the energy.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.390]  So therefore it can push more plant production,
[01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:53.830]  more secondary metabolites is what we're looking for.
[01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:55.990]  So in many ways, I agree with you 100% Brian.
[01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:57.470]  I mean, it is next level shit.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:02.070]  It's the next level to improving the potential
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:06.350]  or the abundance of the production
[01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.670]  that we are looking for.
[01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:11.310]  And it's true with fruits too, and all kinds of plants.
[01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.310]  It's just, you gotta use the right stuff
[01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:16.110]  and obviously don't be a moron.
[01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:22.630]  I was curious, when do you cut off your foliar feeding,
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:23.470]  if at all?
[01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.830]  Like I know a lot of natural farmers
[01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.870]  are running their foliar feeds through flour.
[01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:30.470]  Yeah, I've been hearing-
[01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.270]  I've been trying to like, had the balls to do that,
[01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:37.230]  but like I've definitely like started pushing it more
[01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.070]  into like week three and stuff,
[01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.510]  as where before I was more cutting it off around week two.
[01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.550]  And I've been having good luck with that.
[01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:46.790]  For clarification though, real quick, Andrew,
[01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:48.630]  you're just simply talking about
[01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:50.350]  spraying Limo late into flower
[01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.230]  or spraying a variety of different things late into flower?
[01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:54.710]  No, I'm just like, I don't know.
[01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:55.830]  I guess I'm wrong,
[01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.470]  because I'm assuming that Layton's using
[01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.070]  like a Korean natural farming method.
[01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:01.230]  I know like a lot of Korean natural farmers
[01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:05.710]  are like spraying their maintenance fee in like LAB
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.790]  and like, you know, just some of the Korean natural farming
[01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:11.110]  stuff all the way through flower.
[01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:12.910]  Yes, I've been hearing the same thing.
[01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:15.910]  The problem is, is if you're being tested microbial,
[01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:19.550]  you got an issue, because you're gonna grow out
[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:21.910]  that population of biology.
[01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:26.310]  And potentially like, even if you have one little bad guy,
[01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:27.710]  he could potentially grow out.
[01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.430]  So like a little bit of salmonella or something,
[01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.190]  or, you know, E. coli.
[01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.150]  And so that's the fear.
[01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:38.270]  You know, labs, you should be able to go right to the end
[01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.310]  because they'll help to prevent bud rot.
[01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.910]  But again, if you're being tested,
[01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.950]  you just gotta be really careful with that stuff.
[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.630]  You know, so I usually tell people cut it off,
[01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.470]  cut off foliar at week two, and then just go to drench.
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.790]  Put it around the base of the plant.
[01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:57.350]  Make the plant work a little harder to get it up.
[01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:59.030]  Yeah, that's been my approach as well.
[01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.750]  And you know, like I said, I haven't had the balls
[01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.310]  to even try going all the way through.
[01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:06.150]  But one day I will, and just, I don't know,
[01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.550]  just out of curiosity and probably just run it through
[01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:10.630]  some microbial testing, like you said.
[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:11.510]  Yeah, do it, man.
[01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.550]  Take one plant, do a side by side.
[01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:14.710]  Yeah, see what happens.
[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:17.230]  Right, I don't think people do this enough.
[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:20.790]  I mean, you should always be doing some kind of experiment.
[01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:23.070]  Just to up your game, if nothing else.
[01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:25.470]  I mean, don't ever stop learning.
[01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:27.750]  I mean, I get up and read frigging two hours
[01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:29.190]  of science papers every day.
[01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.310]  Because I'm not only curious,
[01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:35.070]  but I like to put pieces together.
[01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.630]  So by doing that, I might read this paper a month ago,
[01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:41.550]  and one today, and all of a sudden I connect the dots.
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:44.630]  I'm like, oh, wow, that's interesting.
[01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.870]  So if you're not doing one little pot
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:51.110]  or one little bed separately to just learn tricks
[01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:55.150]  and techniques, then you're not learning anymore.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:56.670]  You've stagnated.
[01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:59.190]  And we all know what happens when you hit the plateau, man.
[01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:01.270]  It's a slippery slope after, man.
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.310]  Yeah, you're selling mid-packs to your homies
[01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:06.030]  and then they don't come around no more.
[01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:06.870]  Right.
[01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.470]  So yeah, so definitely, Andrew,
[01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.310]  pull one of the plants aside and pound it
[01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:16.030]  all the way through and see what happens.
[01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:17.030]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:19.110]  Yeah, I'll sit on it.
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.830]  All right, did you guys see this question?
[01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:30.350]  It's the year of, what is it, every 17 years?
[01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.110]  Is it really?
[01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:33.470]  I thought it was every seven.
[01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.310]  Seven?
[01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:37.870]  I would say absolutely you could do that.
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.590]  So you take the bugs, it's gonna stink like hell, dude.
[01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.230]  Kill them all, squeeze them,
[01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:47.430]  get all of the juices you can out of them
[01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.550]  and create a foliar spray.
[01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:50.390]  And you're very-
[01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.750]  Spray it all over the place, all over your plant.
[01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.750]  Definitely help to pull them off.
[01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.470]  Because they're not gonna wanna go,
[01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:59.630]  it's like the old Indians used to do.
[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.070]  Even the Romans do.
[01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:03.630]  They'd hang humans on crosses on the roadway
[01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:05.710]  so you didn't fuck with them.
[01:09:05.710 --> 01:09:06.910]  I'm not going there, man.
[01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.190]  I'm not fucking with them.
[01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:11.270]  They're gonna smell all that death
[01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.110]  and they're not gonna wanna go near it.
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:16.870]  Wendy's been doing some playing around with that shit.
[01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:21.870]  I know a guy here, Ron, at Recon Insectaries,
[01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:25.710]  who's been doing that shit for years
[01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:26.870]  and it really does help.
[01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.590]  I mean, you can scare a pest off
[01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.750]  based on using their biology to send them a warning sign.
[01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:37.110]  You come here, we're killing you, motherfucker.
[01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:43.310]  Streets are roughly savage.
[01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.870]  Absolutely, man.
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.070]  Is there a predator for that as well?
[01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:51.590]  Cicadas, or I'm sorry, what the fuck?
[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:52.630]  Yeah, cicadas.
[01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:55.590]  No, they're out of control, man.
[01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:57.790]  They outnumber everything.
[01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.830]  So I'm sure birds are picking them off,
[01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:03.070]  but they're like, we come with billions.
[01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:06.910]  An invasion, literally.
[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:09.910]  So no, there's really not a lot you can do.
[01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:12.430]  I mean, even if you nuked them with an airplane,
[01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.630]  they're still gonna get through.
[01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:18.310]  And we know that's not gonna be beneficial to anything else.
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.510]  So you're better off to crush them
[01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:22.350]  and turn them into a nasty-ass juice
[01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.790]  and spray everything with it.
[01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:26.150]  And then you just foil their feed
[01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.190]  and then it kind of just takes over from there.
[01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:30.750]  Yeah, coat everything with it.
[01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.070]  It definitely would work.
[01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:37.070]  Or at least steer a bunch of them away from you,
[01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.990]  that's for sure.
[01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:41.310]  And then you probably would just do that once a week,
[01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:44.670]  once a month, if it's a major infestation?
[01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:45.670]  It would depend.
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.630]  If it rains, you're gonna lose it.
[01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:50.790]  So you'd have to reapply.
[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:54.110]  But I would say that the greater the smell
[01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:56.390]  of all that bug death,
[01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:00.030]  the better chance you have of not getting an infestation
[01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:01.230]  that devastates you.
[01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:06.670]  You played around with predatory mice and stuff, Andrew?
[01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:07.550]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:10.450]  Those are definitely a regular part of my routine.
[01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:13.350]  Yeah, have you ever played around
[01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:15.630]  with that minute pirate bug?
[01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:16.750]  I have, I've used those.
[01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:19.150]  Those are actually pretty good for-
[01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.550]  They're savage.
[01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:22.630]  Yeah, they go hard.
[01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:23.870]  I mean, I haven't had any,
[01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:25.670]  they'd never bit me or anything.
[01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:28.070]  People were saying, I don't know,
[01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:29.830]  some people were saying that they would bite them
[01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:32.070]  and they'd get really mad and all this.
[01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.470]  That was not my experience with them.
[01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:36.230]  My experience with them was they were pretty chill.
[01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.350]  They stuck to the plants.
[01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.230]  They kind of buzzed a little bit around
[01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:40.230]  and you'd see them and you'd be like,
[01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.550]  oh shit, I got fungus gnats.
[01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:43.070]  I gotta get the nematodes out.
[01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:46.110]  But then you'd be like, oh, it's a pirate bug.
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.910]  And then it was cool again.
[01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:52.250]  But yeah, they're good for thrips, aphids, whatever.
[01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.070]  In the past, I've had some issues with thrips and whatnot.
[01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:00.430]  And I was able to get those under control using,
[01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.070]  I used cucumeris variety.
[01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.830]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, but I use that.
[01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:08.270]  I use pirate bugs and nematodes
[01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:11.710]  and that really helped clean them out.
[01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:12.870]  And ladybugs too.
[01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.890]  Ladybugs actually eat a lot of those thrips.
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:19.970]  Have you ever played around with the green lacewings?
[01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:23.170]  Cause I feel like they're more effective than the ladybugs.
[01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.910]  I think that they are more effective,
[01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.970]  but see the problem is, is the green lacewings,
[01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:30.010]  they aren't as effective once they've matured.
[01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:32.810]  Like the larvae is what you want.
[01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:36.170]  And after, I mean, I guess ladybugs are the same way.
[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:39.790]  Ladybugs have just been more my choice
[01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.570]  just because I could always just go down
[01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:43.050]  and buy them at the growth store
[01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.150]  and I couldn't get lacewings that way.
[01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:49.530]  The only thing I don't like about ladybugs
[01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:53.410]  is the way they're harvested is so not cool.
[01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.050]  I mean, they're just decimating entire colonies
[01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:57.410]  by collecting them.
[01:12:57.410 --> 01:13:01.130]  Whereas the lacewings and others are being grown out
[01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:04.130]  commercially in insectaries.
[01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.530]  For whatever reason, I don't know why
[01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:08.350]  they can't seem to grow out ladybugs,
[01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.450]  but they can all these other predators.
[01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:13.290]  So, you know.
[01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:16.810]  It seems like there's magic in sunlight for them.
[01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:18.370]  I think we've mentioned that a few times.
[01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:21.410]  It's like, you know, growing the ladybugs,
[01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:22.890]  or at least back when we were trying to do that,
[01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:24.350]  we were trying to get the larvae,
[01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:27.050]  like Andrew was saying, for the ladybugs as well.
[01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:28.410]  Cause that's really what's effective.
[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.770]  It seems like the adults that you buy
[01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:32.450]  from your local growth store,
[01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.150]  they just want to reproduce and eat.
[01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.090]  And to be honest, it seems like they're pretty lazy
[01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:38.650]  once they accomplish both of those things.
[01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:41.130]  So it's not as effective unless it is like thrips
[01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.430]  or aphids kind of thing.
[01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.170]  So I'd love, yeah, I'd love to keep that discussion open
[01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:47.810]  cause I don't want people to waste their money
[01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:48.850]  this year going out.
[01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.530]  Cause a lot of people hype a lot of bullshit,
[01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:52.810]  I feel like, especially at these,
[01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.850]  even some of these local garden centers here in Denver.
[01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:58.090]  Oh, there's so much misinformation.
[01:13:58.090 --> 01:13:58.930]  So much.
[01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:00.110]  It's scary.
[01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:05.110]  Like I highly recommend people find Suzanne Bug Lady
[01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:09.330]  on IG, hit her up, use her as a consultant.
[01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.570]  She knows her stuff inside and out.
[01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:12.530]  She went to college.
[01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:14.170]  She's got a degree.
[01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:17.930]  She's not one of these people that are Google scholars,
[01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:18.810]  or what do you want to call them?
[01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:21.850]  YouTube graduates.
[01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:24.750]  She's done the work and she knows which insectaries
[01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:29.130]  are going to sell you viable material or viable bugs
[01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:31.970]  and the ones that are abusing it.
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:34.330]  And again, when we were doing the conferences,
[01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:36.210]  she would always say,
[01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:37.850]  you really want to go,
[01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.690]  you really want to make sure you're buying
[01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:43.370]  close to direct with the insectaries as you can,
[01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.330]  because a lot of these guys that sell a third
[01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:48.090]  or fourth party, it's been sitting on docks,
[01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.570]  it's been sitting in warehouses,
[01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.610]  it's been sitting in, you know,
[01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:54.530]  UPS trucks going across the country.
[01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:56.850]  So you really want to get, you know,
[01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:58.690]  the freshest viable bugs.
[01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:02.930]  You've got to go as close to direct as you possibly can.
[01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:04.330]  You're going to pull her up?
[01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:06.210]  Wider.
[01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.410]  The assassin bug.
[01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:08.730]  That's another gangster.
[01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:10.530]  Yeah, this one,
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.810]  because the pirate bug is similar to this, right?
[01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:16.490]  Like it has the long like horn
[01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:17.970]  that it just stabs things with
[01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:20.130]  and just sucks their insides out.
[01:15:20.130 --> 01:15:20.970]  Yeah, it's a spear.
[01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:21.810]  So this one's similar.
[01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:23.330]  These guys put them,
[01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:26.050]  they'll put their dead prey on their back to ward others.
[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:28.850]  Yeah, they'll like flip them over backwards.
[01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:32.850]  They're fighting little scorpions in there.
[01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:36.330]  For some reason, my like suggested YouTube videos
[01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.570]  every time I'm on YouTube are insect death matches.
[01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:41.650]  So I actually watch a ton of these things
[01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:44.330]  and I'm like, that's fucking bad-ass.
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:45.890]  So this is Peter's porn.
[01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:48.210]  Yeah.
[01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:52.650]  Look at that thing, man.
[01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.890]  But these things beat the mantis.
[01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:57.450]  You know, right?
[01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:58.530]  And just like eat them alive.
[01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:02.610]  But anyway, not to get off topic.
[01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.690]  In for the kill.
[01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.530]  And then it flips it.
[01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:09.170]  I don't really see too many things attacking the scorpion.
[01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:12.170]  Like the scorpion's like stabbing it
[01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:14.210]  in the back of the neck.
[01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:15.530]  The thing's up there.
[01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:19.050]  Crazy.
[01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:21.650]  So Andrew, you going next level with all this, dude?
[01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.570]  I don't know about the bug fight.
[01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:27.530]  You need to up your predator game.
[01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.370]  Get some of these things.
[01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:33.970]  Ooh, now the other one's coming in and dude joining.
[01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.650]  Those look bigger than the ones I've ever had,
[01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.610]  assassin bug wise.
[01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.650]  Yeah, the pirate bugs probably won't bite you,
[01:16:40.650 --> 01:16:42.210]  but these motherfuckers would.
[01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:45.650]  These ones will take a rip of finger off.
[01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:47.210]  These look like abnormally big.
[01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:51.010]  Must be like an Australian version or something.
[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.290]  And you see the other scorpion in the other corner
[01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.130]  just beating the scale.
[01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.770]  I wonder how big the scale of this.
[01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:58.250]  Like, you know what I mean?
[01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:00.410]  I wonder what the scale is.
[01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:02.690]  I mean, scorpions aren't small.
[01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:03.530]  Well, there are small.
[01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:05.850]  But there is small scorpions though, you know?
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:08.330]  The ones in Arizona are pretty damn small.
[01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.890]  They glow.
[01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:11.050]  You hit them with a-
[01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:16.050]  Look, you can see the little spike there on the face.
[01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.730]  I don't know the right verbiage.
[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.850]  Spear.
[01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:21.530]  Spear.
[01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.050]  Think of it like a fungal feeding nematode
[01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:26.650]  or a leaf feeding nematode.
[01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:28.010]  You got a spear.
[01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.410]  That's the other thing, you know,
[01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:31.810]  I feel like all of us have played around with,
[01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:33.930]  you know, praying mantis and that kind of stuff
[01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:35.690]  and really seeing how effective that is
[01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.690]  because from, you know, my little world,
[01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.290]  when I was first starting out with this stuff,
[01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:43.330]  I noticed that as long as they went through the satchels,
[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:45.450]  through the battle royale, if you will, kind of thing,
[01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.770]  the alphas emerge.
[01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:50.850]  And then if I kind of like kept them away from themselves,
[01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:52.930]  they would just kind of guard the plant that they were on.
[01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:55.450]  And it seemed like if they saw the other praying mantis,
[01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:56.730]  they wouldn't really mess with that one
[01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:59.770]  as long as I continued, I did kind of add ladybugs.
[01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:01.370]  If they weren't able to find anything,
[01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:02.810]  they would just go around and eat the ladybugs.
[01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.250]  So you did have to add a certain food
[01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.210]  to keep the praying mantis alive
[01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:08.770]  if you have a healthy garden.
[01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:11.610]  But to me, I feel like that's kind of rewarding sometimes
[01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:13.250]  to sit down there and just smoke a bowl
[01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:15.410]  or something like that and watch them go to work
[01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:19.910]  and how quickly they react and snag a ladybug burger.
[01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:22.530]  Ladybug burger.
[01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:24.450]  Yeah, that's what I used to have my kids.
[01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:25.970]  That's what I always called it.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.200]  So what do you guys think of, like,
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.560]  do you think ladybugs still have, you know,
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.280]  adding them to feed a praying mantis?
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.520]  Does that make sense to you, Layton?
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.160]  Or do you feel like if they're not there anymore,
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.160]  like how do you continue to be proactive
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.800]  when your garden is successful?
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.040]  And that question's for you, Andrew, as well.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.560]  I would say just scouting.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.560]  I mean, like nature can get in balance and out of balance
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.040]  just like humans.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.720]  So yeah, the temperature change, you know,
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.520]  extra wind, lack of moisture can screw things up
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.600]  and the pests or the predators will move on.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.560]  I mean, I'm a big proponent of in the garden,
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.400]  make sure you have a big set of banker plants
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.000]  and pollinator gardens or pollinator flushes.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.020]  So you're gonna be attracting those indigenous predators.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.640]  That's, in my mind, the best way you can help
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.640]  to protect your garden from an invasion.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.360]  And the other thing is just healthy soil, healthy plants.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.400]  They're not even on the radar, you know?
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.120]  So if you do get a huge infestation,
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.840]  then you should be looking at your soil system,
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.160]  at whether it's chemistry or whether it's biology,
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.840]  because obviously that plant is stressed.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.360]  And remember, bugs are recyclers.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.640]  They're here to protect us or anything
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.280]  from consuming a plant that's not healthy.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.160]  So they infest it, they take it down,
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.960]  they turn it back into soil.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960]  All the bugs are doing is recycling.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.640]  That's their job.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.560]  And so, when they get out of balance,
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.400]  chances are you need to look in the mirror and say,
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.640]  fuck, what did I do wrong?
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.200]  Or maybe I should be pulling out the microscope
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.360]  and look at the biome that's going on in my soil
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.080]  or the chemistry relationship.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.840]  So don't hate on the bugs, man.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.800]  They're just there to do the recycling.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:22.040]  That's my opinion.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.560]  And to you, Andrew, how do you feel about adding
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.640]  certain bugs to keep other bugs alive?
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.520]  Is that, do you feel like that's in the wheelhouse or?
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.240]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's definitely necessary.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.160]  I mean, it's part of the food system, so to speak.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.480]  You want things to survive and part and part of that
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.840]  is that, like he said, like having pollinators
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:44.000]  in your garden, because that is,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.320]  it's a common source of food for a lot of the predators
[01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.880]  people are using in cannabis gardens in general.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:55.680]  They tend to feed on that when there's no active prey.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.560]  And I think that's a crucial piece to have
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.680]  is the pollinators, as well as some other soil dwelling.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.640]  I like to do some hypoaspis
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.920]  and if I can get springtails going, I get them going.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.680]  And yeah, usually just, yeah.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.920]  Sorry, I'm bad at talking.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.800]  You're all good, bro.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.640]  Good phone too.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.680]  Nah, man, it's cool.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:23.200]  It's tough to do a debut and also have it live,
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.040]  I would think, man.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.720]  So this is great, bro.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.880]  There's a question for you.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.440]  Are you a hand water, a blue mat guy, or how do you water?
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.040]  I do hand water for the most part.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.320]  And sometimes like I'll wet the soil usually
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.320]  with like a watering can style, like a hose attachment.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.400]  And then I'll like come through and then I'll water
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.200]  with more of like a gallon pitcher
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.320]  because the pots are big.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.160]  And like when I first started growing
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.000]  with bigger living soil pots,
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.040]  I had kind of a challenging time
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.840]  getting it thoroughly wetted.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.320]  So one thing I've done to help with that
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.720]  is kind of like have that like initial like wetting round
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.560]  where you go through and you kind of start the wetting
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.200]  with like I said, like a watering style can
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.400]  where it's kind of like a shower over
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.720]  and then come through and I can add my,
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:25.320]  more at once with like a bigger style watering device.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.320]  So you don't keep your soil cover cropped?
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.640]  I do keep it cover cropped as well.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.280]  Okay, but you still have some kind of dry down
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.560]  where you're gonna have to hand water?
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.480]  At certain points I did, but I have now remedied that
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.440]  just by mulch layering.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.920]  And also, like I said, like that initial like watering,
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.480]  it helps to where I'm not getting any like run out of water
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.520]  from the pots like when I start watering
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.880]  at that initial dampening.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.680]  And then like I said, introduce the rest of the water.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.080]  So breaking the surface tension of the soil.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.880]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.640]  And what size pots are you running?
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.880]  So I kind of vary
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.800]  cause like I'm doing a lot of the genetic stuff
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.700]  like in the stuff like where I'm like running
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.040]  like my select clones,
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.080]  like I'll prefer like a 40 to 50 gallon pot.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.280]  And then the stuff where I'm running my like pheno hunts,
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.060]  I'll do like 10 to 20 gallon pots.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.200]  And those can be a little bit more challenging
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.120]  as far as like from a no-till perspective
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.720]  with the smaller pots,
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.440]  but they are effective at turning over,
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:33.720]  you know, like I said, like pheno hunts and whatnot.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.640]  So I feel like part of that question is interesting,
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.120]  which is, do you like to keep your moisture band narrow
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:45.040]  and perfect like a blue mat system would do?
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.580]  Or like the opposite extreme is hand watering
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.640]  where it's gonna blow through
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.000]  that you're gonna overwater it
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.920]  and it's gonna go too moist and then like dry down
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.800]  and it's gonna go under your bottom perfect band.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.920]  So I feel like,
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.240]  does that kind of stress the microbial system in a good way?
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.880]  Like where the strongest survive
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:06.920]  and then the water gets back to an optimal moisture
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.320]  and like they thrive and make your plants thrive too?
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.920]  That's a great question, Peter.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.480]  You know, that was part of the reason
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.600]  why I put the horizontal soil system together
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.000]  was to handle those extremes.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.160]  I mean, the nice part of using a super soil
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.680]  or a soilless medium is that
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.880]  you can just flush everything through there.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.600]  The only problem is you move the fines
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.160]  and when you do that and the fines end up going anaerobic
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.680]  on the bottom of the pot.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.560]  And of course the top dries down
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.280]  and you get what's called biofilm,
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.320]  which turns the whole surface hydrophobic.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.760]  So when you pour water on it, it just runs off the sides.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.960]  So it's a little bit more tricky
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.560]  in just a soilless medium or a super soil
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.480]  than it is in like the horizontal system
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.480]  where no, the microbes are,
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.600]  I think I got a study that said 80%
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  of the microbes can live in an aquatic environment.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.640]  I don't know how long, they don't know how long,
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.840]  but they have proven it.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.480]  I mean, amoebas, I find them in ponds,
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.360]  I find them in aquatic ecosystems,
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.800]  I find them in aquaculture, it's why I harvest fish yet.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.520]  And I also see them in my compost,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.600]  I see them in terrestrial soils, all over the place.
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:28.400]  And the same with, to some degree, diatoms.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.320]  I'm sure that there were a lot more abundant
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.880]  in the soil in the past before the great migration
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.080]  or human migration.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.600]  But, and then there's, Dr. James White
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.360]  has done a tremendous amount of research
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.680]  on endophytic fungi and how,
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.600]  if in the surface of a leaf, there's an endophytic fungi,
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.240]  when it hits the soil, it morphs into a saprophyte
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.480]  or a saprobe, so it starts consuming that organic matter.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.120]  Same is true, that leaf falls into a river stream or pond
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.760]  and it actually becomes an aquatic fungi.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.800]  And so there's, the hard part is doing all of the studies
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.840]  on this stuff, because there's just not a lot of money
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.040]  being spent in this.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.080]  You know, people spend money to make money.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.760]  They don't spend money because they're inquisitive,
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.640]  unless you're a lunatic like me,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.640]  but there's not a lot of us out here.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.920]  So bottom line is that that kind of research
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.680]  is going to become available because as more and more people
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.480]  graduate from college and want to continue on
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.040]  to their education, those are the people
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.240]  that are actually doing the work, the research,
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.640]  to get their PhDs.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.960]  And that's another reason why we do the Clubhouse,
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.120]  Craig Leaf and I, is to get other people
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.440]  to start paying attention and connect the science world
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.680]  with the independent growers so that we can get them
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.560]  to start collecting data for us as well,
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:58.000]  so that we can get some more of this, you know,
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.760]  critical information that we need.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.000]  But for the most part, no, the microbes will do fine
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.040]  in an overwater.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.360]  I mean, think about how many torrential rainstorms,
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.480]  you know, that we get on the surface of the earth
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.400]  all over the place.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.920]  And you don't see a huge die down under those conditions.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.400]  The only times you really see a die down is, you know,
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.200]  a volcanic explosion, you know, earthquakes,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.400]  even tornadoes and hurricanes.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.720]  I mean, they do some damage, but pretty soon,
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.000]  the plants start to come back
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.760]  and the microbial communities build back up again.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.640]  You look at Mount St. Holland, five years after that,
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:39.360]  she popped her cork, man, she came back with a roaring rush.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.840]  So, you know, maybe some of the tropical islands
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.640]  are less so because they don't have the diversity
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.640]  blowing in on the wings, so to say.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.040]  But no, microbes can handle that, you know, incredible water.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.040]  Now, if you let them waterlog or go anaerobic,
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.080]  that's a different game.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.800]  Now the anaerobes are gonna consume the aerobes
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.240]  and then you're gonna have to swing it back,
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.720]  which is called re-inoculate.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.480]  But I hope I answered that, a little long winded,
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.520]  but doing the best I can.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:11.880]  You see that?
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.720]  What's up, green goddess?
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960]  What's up, green goddess?
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960]  All right, Andrew, what is in your teas?
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.440]  What are you using for, you know,
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.560]  you said you used an IMO2 and you liquefy,
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.840]  were there any other compost extracts
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.600]  or anything that you're doing?
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.240]  I do, I just like worm casting teas occasionally.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.240]  And I also use like some of the dragonfly products.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.320]  I really like their lush roots in particular.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.520]  That's something that I've been incorporating into my teas.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.360]  And yeah, I mean, that's, I keep it pretty simple.
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:53.520]  I water in the IMO teas and other times I'm watering in
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.400]  like ferment drenches with like FPJ and vinegar.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.640]  And sometimes like I'll like do some like casting with that,
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.080]  like, and, you know, like add that into the casting
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.860]  after I brewed it.
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.660]  And it seems to work really well.
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.220]  Yeah, dragonfly has some bad-ass shit for sure.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.020]  So bad-ass, like they said,
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.940]  if you spray their stuff late into flower,
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.300]  that mystic, their mystic product,
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.300]  you're gonna fail your microbial tests
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:28.900]  because it doesn't discern good from bad.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.980]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.820]  Yeah.
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:32.640]  Maybe someday.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.100]  So were there any other questions out there, Peter?
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.620]  There we go.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:42.260]  Do any of you ever use soap nuts?
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.220]  I have not, I've used yucca.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:48.060]  No.
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.420]  Soap nuts do work well.
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:52.720]  This would be a replacement for yucca basically.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.060]  How is it better than yucca?
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.140]  Can we talk about that then?
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.220]  I don't think it's better.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.980]  It's just a pack.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:02.860]  So it basically, it breaks the surface tension
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:05.900]  on whatever you're applying it
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.300]  so that the water coats it evenly.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.220]  Because yucca is a pinch basically
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.540]  for a five-gallon bucket.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:16.680]  I mean, that'll last you two years.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.900]  So is that kind of the same ratios with that product?
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.780]  I don't know.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:25.100]  I haven't played with the soap nuts.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:28.380]  So maybe I'd have put that on my list of,
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.040]  long list of things to play with.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:31.880]  But I have-
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.780]  Layton, I'll hook you up with a pair of soap nuts.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.480]  I'll get them to you.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.880]  Did you see this question?
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.680]  Oh, do you use any fish products, Andrew?
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.080]  I do use some fish products during veg.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.320]  I use FAA.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:56.200]  And, but when I haven't had FAA,
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.640]  cause I know that is a challenge for a lot of people.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.080]  I have had pretty good luck
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.040]  with the down to earth fish powder.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.640]  That has also worked pretty well for me in the soil.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.680]  So you did, you used hydrolysate or I missed that
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.240]  cause I was reading the comments.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:17.520]  So I've used, so like I'm using FAA now.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.360]  Yeah.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.680]  In the past, like when I didn't have FAA,
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.200]  I've used this fish powder from down to earth
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.240]  and it's pretty, it's pretty effective.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.680]  So it's a dehydrated hydrolysate?
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.260]  It's yeah, it's a dehydrated like fish powder.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.800]  And it's, you use like a teaspoon a gallon.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.640]  Okay.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:37.480]  But-
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:38.320]  Does it go right in the fish?
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.280]  I think they recommend a lot more than that,
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.760]  but like I've used, I used it like fractionally
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.160]  to like what they're recommending on the box.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.160]  Like that would be my advice, like with a product like that.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.640]  Other than that, like that's what I have to say about fish.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.120]  Did you use their down to earth,
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.480]  with the down to earth products?
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.940]  Did you ever use their bio live?
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.840]  Ask him about weed and he'll talk all day.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.440]  Ask him about fish and he'll be a man of few words.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.160]  Go ahead and re-answer that Andrew.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.360]  All right, say that question one more time.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.680]  Oh no, I forgot what I asked him.
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.720]  Yeah, we need playback.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:23.200]  Does anyone remember Brian's question?
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.420]  Oh, I was so entranced with what you guys were saying.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.600]  I don't know, he's talking to fish.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.640]  I don't remember dude.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.640]  Like I like totally like went over my head.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.400]  Oh, what about good?
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.680]  Yeah, fish heads are great man.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.480]  Grind them up, put them in your compost pile for sure.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.080]  That's how the old heads would,
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.000]  I mean, I remember they would talk about that stuff
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.280]  when I was living down in Valdosta, Georgia.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.760]  They're talking about just throw it in the field
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.280]  and put a fish head down there.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.200]  I'm always like really like skeptical
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.080]  on like where the fish is coming from though
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.720]  because of like all the heavy metals
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.680]  and like fish you can eat, fish you can't eat
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.560]  and like how those things can accumulate in the soil.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.200]  So, you know, like with that down to earth product,
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.720]  you know, I always use it like super lightly
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:09.680]  and like for like a short period of time
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.800]  because I never even knew where the fish was coming from.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.640]  Like.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.000]  Might be a hundred percent swordfish or something.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.960]  Well, not just that, but like, you know,
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.080]  like some of these fish that are out there
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.240]  have unnatural levels of like plastics and metals in them.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.360]  And you're seeing all kinds of stuff with fish.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.120]  It's disturbing and it's, I don't know, it's concerning.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.160]  I don't know if any of you guys seen that,
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.120]  what was it, that new Netflix documentary,
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120]  that sea spiracy they're talking about.
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.240]  Like, I mean, I almost don't even want to like
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.200]  take anything from the ocean at that rate.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.560]  Like, you know, like that was pretty crazy.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.400]  Yeah, it is.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.240]  It is.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:52.120]  Just the, like how fast like these species are declining
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:52.960]  and it's like all of them.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.440]  It's not just like a few things.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.800]  And it's, I don't know, it's disturbing.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.840]  And I think like when you're sourcing fish,
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.080]  like, I don't know, like I've always had, like,
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.320]  you know, it's kind of like a necessary part
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.160]  of like the organic system, I feel.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.120]  But like, there's like been like kind of like,
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.800]  like I want to know where the fish is coming from.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:14.920]  I want to catch my own fish.
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.920]  Like some of the fish I got,
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.120]  like that I made this small batch that I got now.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.920]  And it's like, I don't know, I made a little bit
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.080]  and it's lasted me like a really long time.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.800]  I got the fish myself from the Florida Keys.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:28.960]  You know, I caught them myself,
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.920]  like, you know, in their marine sanctuary.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:33.120]  I mean, I guess that's pretty clean,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.360]  but I don't even know, like I didn't test the water.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.600]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.640]  Yeah.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.720]  Which side of the country is cleaner, Leighton?
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.760]  Oh, to the, no.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.040]  Yeah.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.360]  Dude, it's all dirty.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.400]  It's all dirty.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.240]  It's all-
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.720]  I would recommend that, you know-
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.240]  Anything that you can get close to the shore
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.080]  is going to be dirty.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.560]  You'd have to go way out to get something even like-
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:58.280]  Yeah, and even in a sanctuary because of currents,
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.200]  everything is drifting all over the place.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.040]  Absolutely.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.720]  That's the one thing that people don't get
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.120]  is in an aquatic environment, like we're above,
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:07.400]  we're in air, right?
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.240]  The atmosphere.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.200]  So if I blow some smoke over here,
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.880]  it's not going to affect you over there.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.760]  But when you put a drop of something in water,
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.440]  it goes through the whole system very, very quickly.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.280]  So it's a different,
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.160]  it's a completely different environment
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.440]  that has its own unique properties
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.960]  that allow for, you know, that kind of stuff to happen
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.480]  and spread very quickly.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.520]  But as far as like getting fish from clean sources,
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.880]  you find an aquaculture company that you trust.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.560]  They are grown on shore
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.560]  and recirculating aquatic aquaculture systems.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  That's a safe way to get a clean fish for your, you know,
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.720]  FFA or if you want hydrolysate, the same thing.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.960]  Bit Up Fish Brew, Keith is doing a great job
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.800]  of he's actually starting to release
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.480]  within the next month or so,
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.760]  their first round of cold pressed pure fish hydrolysate.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.480]  They do not remove the oils,
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.240]  which is the key thing that you want.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.200]  And he could definitely, you know,
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.640]  kill a fish and ship it to you if you wanted one
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.080]  to make an FAA.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:20.920]  Absolutely.
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.320]  So, you know, hit him up.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.880]  That's a very clean source.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.320]  I know the water that it's grown in.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.880]  It's an amazingly mineral rich water.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.960]  It's so mineral rich, he has diatoms in the system
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.560]  and they are blooming like crazy all the time.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.840]  He did a silica test on a product
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.400]  that had been sitting on a shelf
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.080]  for I think it was six months and the silica doubled.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.800]  So that means that those diatoms are pulling the,
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.760]  pulling the mineral out of solution and growing,
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.000]  multiplying and it's really bioavailable silica.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.480]  So it's not silica sand.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.560]  Sorry, that went off on a tangent.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.920]  That's great.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.240]  I mean, that's something I like to hear about
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.280]  because silica is one of those things, you know,
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.000]  as an organic farmer, you're trying to source it naturally
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.880]  and, you know, it's-
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.640]  Get some of his teeth.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:18.640]  Go to fishbrew.com and he has a product called Bold
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.160]  and that is gonna be billions of diatoms.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.640]  And again, it's bioavailable silica.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.640]  So it breaks down really quick.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.640]  And these diatoms are actually gonna live
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.640]  in your soil system and they're gonna be pumping oxygen
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.920]  into the soil, which is amazing asset
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.440]  to building microbial communities.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.200]  Because the more oxygen you have in the soil system,
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.480]  the less compaction you have,
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.880]  the more biological activity, you know, bacteria,
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.840]  everything consuming it and the more CO2
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.640]  they're releasing up to the plant.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.520]  Absolutely.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.280]  Yeah, no, I, you know,
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.200]  I've been bugging him to do this for years.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.600]  And one day he went into a hydroponic shop
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.120]  and he saw a bottle of fish shit for like 60 bucks.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.400]  He's like, what?
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.080]  He called me screaming at me.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.840]  I'm like, dude, I've been telling you to do this
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.800]  for fucking years.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.600]  Why haven't you listened to me?
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.760]  Don't fucking call and yell at me, man.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.560]  So finally this year, he's, I think he's okay
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.240]  in all states except for Hawaii.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.840]  I think that Illinois is one.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.960]  California, it's gotta be experimental right now
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.600]  because they're not answering their emails
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.400]  to give him his regulatory permit,
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.160]  but he'll get there eventually.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:34.800]  I highly recommend that stuff.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.280]  I've been working with that product for eight years now.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.360]  His fish waste, like I used to go there and collect it
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:44.880]  and I use it in my, because of the value of those diatoms,
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.800]  as well as all of the, you know, he's got, I don't know,
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.400]  I don't know how many thousands
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.000]  of different type of bacteria,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.120]  aquatic fungi through the roof.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.840]  And all of these are, you know,
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.480]  I get crazy talking about AMOs, aquatic microorganisms
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:04.400]  and how before the great human expansion,
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.920]  we had mass migration.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.760]  So those migrations look like buffalo, deer,
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.440]  moose trashing through swamps, creeks, rivers, lakes,
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.880]  dragging all of those microorganisms up onto the soil
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.880]  and biofilm on their hair clumps.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.440]  And the birds did the same thing.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.680]  You know, they darken the sky with the migration of ducks,
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.920]  geese, and they would land in the water
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.560]  and then fly off and spread it all over the place.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.960]  And we don't have that migration anymore.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.560]  None of that's going on.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.960]  So I'm a big proponent of, you know,
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.720]  getting that aquatic microorganisms,
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.140]  because just like earlier I said,
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:46.160]  we know 80% of them can live terrestrial,
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.360]  just like 80% of the terrestrial species
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.840]  can live in an aquatic environment.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.880]  We just don't know how long.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.800]  What I can tell you is that I have,
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.000]  I diatoms and gone back a year later
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.800]  and they were still present in the soil system.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.520]  So I know that they can live at least that long.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.880]  So highly recommend you get some of that in.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.600]  A question, Andrew.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.480]  What you looking at brother?
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:17.880]  So right now I got, I've been working like some classics.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.680]  I got like some sour diesel going.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.740]  I've been hunting through a few varieties of that.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:24.040]  I've been going through the karma
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.880]  and I got some S1s that I got from a friend of mine too
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.800]  that I've been running and been seeing good things so far,
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.520]  but I haven't seen anything that's like the exact
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.960]  sour diesel that I want yet.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.320]  So that's kind of been an ongoing thing for me
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.240]  for the last like few years, honestly,
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.480]  the whole sour diesel hunt.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:49.000]  But I got some original diesel BX that I got going in soon
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.680]  from a strawberry fields family.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:55.520]  And yeah, so yeah, I mean,
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.400]  that's how I'm pretty much gonna go about that.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.480]  And I'm also finishing up the karma hunts
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.920]  and I got some actually right here.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.620]  This is the karma sour diesel.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.840]  This one's really good.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.960]  It's just the problem with it is it's more sour
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.000]  than it is diesel.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.400]  Like it's super sour, but like the diesel is like,
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.340]  I don't know, it's just way, way back there.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.480]  And it's just, I don't know.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.400]  To me, like I wanna have something that's sour,
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:26.040]  but I also want that diesel smacking on the backend.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.200]  So the sour hunt continues as far as that goes.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.200]  But as far as the piegasm line,
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.520]  I got all kinds of crosses going on with that.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:39.560]  I'm gonna kind of keep some of that secret,
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.000]  but for the first one,
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.120]  I've been working a papaya back cross to the straw guava
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.640]  done by Harry Palms.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.660]  And I caused my piegasm to that.
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:54.620]  So it's gonna be like a soda pie explosion.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.220]  I don't know, it's gonna be crazy.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.660]  But other than that,
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.940]  I'm probably gonna be dropping three flavors
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:08.860]  on July 23rd with Rocky Mountain High Seed Bank.
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:12.120]  And it's gonna be dope.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.140]  And I got a really, really dope freebie planned out
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:15.980]  that I don't know,
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:18.180]  people might want even more than the packs on there.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.660]  I'm really looking to put some good gear
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:23.980]  into people's hands and give people some stuff
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.520]  that's gonna be really terpy and do good in the bags too.
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.300]  And that's kind of the behind this whole new venture
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:32.140]  for you, right?
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.000]  Is you're breeding for the terps and really the terps only.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:39.700]  Terps, but I mean, like I said,
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.780]  the first thing I look at when I come into a room
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:43.460]  is the structure of the plants.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.240]  That's my first like,
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.700]  and I mean, having a limited plant count,
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.140]  I do even have like a little bit of a culling process
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:51.580]  to where a lot of the runts
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:56.580]  and unappealable growing plants get kind of cut down
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.820]  like in veg to where they don't even make it
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:01.400]  to the selection.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.900]  And there's exceptions to that, of course,
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.860]  and you got like a really rare pack of seeds
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:09.140]  and all that.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:12.500]  But as far as like when I'm doing like these bigger seed pops
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.260]  and stuff, I like to eliminate those
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:17.580]  because I don't want the runs to try to tempt me
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:19.460]  into using them into my selection
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:22.540]  because I know that terps are something
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.620]  that is determined in the grow too.
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:28.740]  And you can even see like a little bit of change on terpenes
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:31.200]  when you change stuff around in your grow,
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.100]  as far as like the exact terps.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.860]  So, I mean, I don't know, it's really a complex thing
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.340]  like as far as that goes.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.260]  Well, yeah, terpenes are the plant's defenses.
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:47.520]  So, you could swing them one way or another for sure.
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.180]  And that's something that I've been kind of learning
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.900]  to play with too is like figuring out
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.980]  what environmental factors make the terps which way,
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.380]  and how I can use that to my advantage, so to speak.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.660]  You know what, I would suggest to you
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.900]  like if you have a terp profile
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:09.840]  that you're really trying to push or encourage in a plant
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.700]  is feed that plant with plants that also have that terp.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.300]  So, whether you did a ferment,
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.340]  whether you mulch it into the soil,
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:23.180]  whether you liquefied it, like juiced it
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.820]  and then sprayed it fully.
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.180]  And that brings me to a good point.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:31.460]  I actually, I have practiced that.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.620]  I'd always put the plants back into the same like pots,
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:37.340]  like when I'm doing like a no-till scenario.
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.380]  I mean, that's not always possible on these pheno hunts
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:41.740]  because you got to rotate the soil to a different strain.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:45.100]  But when you got these bigger pots and stuff
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.700]  for running like the cuts and stuff,
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.420]  I do try to put the same plant back in the same soil
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.900]  with the compost from that plant.
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.820]  And then another thing I like to do too is like
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:00.020]  when I'm washing, I like to like sometimes
[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.780]  make like a hash ferment out of it.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.100]  Like for a while, I kind of got away from that
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:07.700]  because one thing you want to be sure of
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.420]  like when you're using like anything from your washroom
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.540]  is that like it's super clean.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.660]  And like at a certain point,
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.340]  like I was helping out like a few friends and stuff
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.300]  and like, you know, washing some of their stuff.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:26.300]  And it led to like getting PM and getting russets,
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.380]  you know, despite never taking in any cuts.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.300]  I don't know, just a lot of bad things can come from it.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.900]  I mean, it's the same as taking on a cut.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:38.100]  So like, if you're going to use the nug from your washroom,
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.500]  you want to make sure you're not washing
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.620]  your friend's shit in there too.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.540]  Especially if you're not willing to take a cut from them
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:47.500]  and put it in your garden, like it's the same thing.
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:52.000]  And I just, you know, I caution people about that.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.780]  And yeah, I mean, that's one of my golden nuggets
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.180]  so to speak as Brian said.
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:02.940]  That's an invaluable lesson that I had to learn
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.300]  the hard way, unfortunately.
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.420]  And yeah.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.060]  So the russets are coming through that way.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.780]  I hadn't heard it kind of explained in that manner.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:17.660]  Well, I did get russets from a friend's material
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:21.380]  and it was a pretty rough ride.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:23.420]  And like, that was pretty much the only source
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.900]  that it could have came from.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:27.580]  And like, it was a clear infestation.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.580]  I never took any cuts.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.260]  I still have never taken any cuts.
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:36.900]  I pride myself on finding my own selections.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.820]  And, you know, cause like I said to you before,
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:40.940]  like a lot of times, you know,
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.180]  some of these cuts aren't always like the number one,
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.020]  you know, for people.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.820]  And you also inherit a lot of problems with cuts.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:51.020]  So I've always just kind of stood clear
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.420]  because I like to keep my environment clean
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:57.140]  and I like to be able to do my natural farming,
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:00.020]  so to speak, without having to worry about any
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:02.780]  of those like crazy factors that you can't really get
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:06.300]  unless you're taking in cuts and like doing other things.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:11.620]  So to speak, you know, keeping it clean and closed loop.
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.780]  Yeah, it's all about keeping that loop closed.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.660]  It's called biosecurity.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:18.740]  One of the biggest failures in the cannabis community
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:21.740]  is not, you know, being really secure
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:24.260]  and making sure you're not a vector
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:28.460]  to bring in somebody's problem to someone else's problem.
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.300]  Absolutely.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.840]  A lot, a lot.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.000]  But there's also people that are doing compost
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.800]  with these foliar feeds, which is, again,
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.720]  you're pushing the plant to the next level.
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.800]  Yeah, second to that.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.640]  For sure.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.800]  So when is your guest popping on, Brian?
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.520]  Yeah, I thought, Peter, did you reach out to him?
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.440]  I thought I included him on the email.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.280]  I thought he would have.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.400]  I know, I definitely did.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:05.960]  Let me find his.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.000]  Maybe he got tied up.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.760]  IG, hold on.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.000]  That'd be cool if he could wrap on.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  That's really the thing, man.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.960]  I hope he can pop on here because I feel like, you know,
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.400]  you get a lot of love from the people
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.960]  that the community respects.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.520]  And so for you to come and continue on this journey, man,
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.200]  it's really cool to see you, you know,
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.960]  start this out for yourself.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.240]  I appreciate it, Brian.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.480]  I appreciate the opportunity to come on the show
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.160]  and talk about it a little bit
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.880]  and share a little bit of my perspective
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]  and yeah, I think it was a good thing.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.440]  Thank you guys.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.520]  Yeah, absolutely, my friend, absolutely.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.240]  You know, it's all about getting a wide variety
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:49.200]  of people's opinions and methods out to the population
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.200]  out in the virtual world that we live in nowadays.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.760]  Well, hopefully Peter will reach out to him,
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:59.440]  but our guest is pretty shrewd
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.840]  and I would say that he's never impressed.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.760]  So it'd be great to see this little discussion
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.840]  between you two.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.320]  So you can't tell us who it is, right?
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.160]  Still got to remain.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.520]  Hopefully it'll just pop up, yeah.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.880]  If not, then I'll just put it on there.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.160]  But I text him even to remind him
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.520]  because I know sometimes it gets busy, but yeah.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.520]  Nice.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.280]  Were there any other questions out there, Peter,
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.720]  that you highlighted?
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.820]  Keys, buckets, heads.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:34.860]  I saw that one.
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:38.860]  Hey, maybe we should scan the crowd,
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:41.100]  see where everybody is in the world.
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.020]  Hit us up, peeps.
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.540]  That really has become my little favorite thing.
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:47.380]  Isn't it?
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.100]  Just to see, like there's, I mean,
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:52.100]  half of those places, it's just amazing
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:54.460]  that everybody's here is just watching
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.860]  the shoot the shit, really, about cannabis.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.700]  All right, so this one was asking,
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.780]  how do you call the bad bugs in compost?
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.700]  Well, you shouldn't have bad bugs in your compost.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:10.660]  If you're making really aerobic compost,
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:13.900]  you're probably only gonna get roly-polies and worms
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.460]  or isopods and worms,
[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:18.300]  but you're not gonna be getting things
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.900]  that are potentially gonna attack the plant
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:25.300]  because you're dealing with dead plant matter.
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.180]  So there's nothing there for them to attack.
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:30.380]  So chances are you're not gonna get any contaminants
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:31.900]  other than biological issues
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.620]  if you're making anaerobic compost.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.860]  I think that's the biggest problem
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:40.380]  with most compost makers is that they can't get biology
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.420]  because they're running it too hot and too dry
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.980]  and or they're making putrefied shit
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.660]  because they're too wet
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:50.340]  and they're not checking your temps.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:54.980]  So that's the only issue with compost.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:56.660]  It's really not that hard to make,
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:58.220]  but you have to be dedicated.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.180]  Yes, exactly.
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.940]  You have to be realistic with yourself.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.720]  Are you gonna really commit to this?
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.660]  Because like Andrew had mentioned,
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.980]  if you're a busy human being constantly on the go,
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:10.820]  vermicomposting might be where it's at for you.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.100]  Absolutely.
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:15.060]  Here's one that says 30-year-old compost.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:18.940]  30 years old, it is just basically humate.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:21.540]  It's been broken down to the finest particulate.
[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:23.980]  It can be only biology,
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:27.260]  only bacteria could break that down more.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.780]  And so that's probably not the ideal compost.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:32.780]  You wanna have that nutrient value.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:36.660]  It should be, if you're thermocomposting, thermophilic,
[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:40.100]  it needs to be at least a year, if not two years old.
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:41.660]  If you're doing biologicals
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:46.580]  where you're basically doing low-temp composting,
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:49.260]  then it can be ready within a month.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.860]  It really depends on your style.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:56.140]  So Sean Russell, we can ask this question again
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:01.140]  when Alex Hardy's on or Mr. Toad or Doc Ray
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.780]  or some of the people who grow
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:07.700]  a lot of medically-specific cultivars.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.340]  But so if you guys have recommendations,
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.100]  but also just I'm saying to Sean,
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.300]  remind me when we have one of those guys on
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:16.140]  and I'll throw the question up.
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.060]  Or Sean, just put up Mr. Toad on IG.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:18.900]  Hit him up.
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.540]  He's there for you, man.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:21.380]  He's doing the work.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:22.540]  Or Alex Hardy.
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:23.860]  And same with Dragonfly.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.900]  They can definitely steer you in the right directions.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:29.540]  But they'll be back on soon.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.900]  So you can also ask them.
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:32.740]  There you go.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:34.300]  But I probably won't remember.
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:35.140]  Yeah.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:40.380]  Yeah, this whole getting old thing sucks, huh?
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.900]  How frequently do you foliar feed?
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:48.740]  Yeah. Andrew, how often do you feed?
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:50.380]  I mean, it depends what you're asking
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:52.380]  if like what you're feeding.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.220]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:54.060]  You can't fully-
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.420]  You can't feed a maintenance solution.
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:56.260]  What do you do?
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:57.540]  Maintenance solution you can do every day.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.020]  But like I said before,
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:03.780]  like I do it like every other day or even every two days
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:06.860]  to get that moisture and nutrient uptake.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.540]  Like as we were talking about before,
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:09.740]  like it's kind of like,
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:14.020]  it kind of helps the plant like relax a little bit
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.820]  in the sense that it has to use less energy
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:20.940]  to get more uptake from the nutrient system
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.060]  through the roots.
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.740]  Yeah, amen to that, my friend.
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:26.580]  Amen.
[01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.580]  So do you guys think for the newer farmer
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:33.260]  using the humics and the fulvics
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:34.820]  and just kind of playing around with that
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:36.740]  so they can see how,
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.940]  it really is amazing to me
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:40.660]  how quickly the plant kind of reacts to that
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:43.780]  compared to other amendments and products.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:45.900]  No, that's a great suggestion, Brian.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.660]  There's a gold bar.
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.660]  If you apply a fulvic or humic,
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:54.220]  you will see plant reaction pretty darn quick,
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:56.300]  especially as in a young plant.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:02.220]  So a combination of like full power or TM7 from BioAg,
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:06.660]  you're gonna see color literally,
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.500]  within 28, 24, 48 hours, if you're paying attention.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.460]  That's the hard part,
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.540]  especially for the newer growers
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:17.660]  is that they don't have that experience,
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:19.580]  years and years of experience growing
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:22.220]  to see so that they wouldn't necessarily
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:25.180]  might notice that plant reaction.
[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:27.420]  I mean, I know I, in my own experience,
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.460]  have had clients who I believe
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.220]  thought knew what they were talking about
[01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:34.100]  or knew what they were looking at.
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.500]  And I would spin their head and show them,
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.260]  hey, look at this plant, look at the color,
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:40.220]  look at the luster of the leaves,
[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:44.420]  look at the size of the leaves or the size of the blooms.
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:45.620]  And then look at this one over here
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:47.580]  that was treated synthetically.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.460]  What do you see?
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.820]  And when you stick their face in it, they get it.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:54.220]  But if you don't, that's kind of the hard part.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.340]  So maybe the suggestion is do a side by side,
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:55:01.100]  treat one plant one way and treat the other plant the other
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.340]  so that you can see it if you're not trained.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.740]  But it is-
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:07.740]  Sorry, bud.
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.980]  Yeah, yeah, all good, man.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:11.580]  It's amazing how well foliar works.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.820]  I was gonna echo that part is,
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.460]  because once you have that trained eye,
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.100]  that part never really leaves you.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.540]  Once you start to see what a real healthy plant looks like,
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:24.380]  especially a consistency over gardens, rows,
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.980]  depending on where you're at in your skillset,
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:29.940]  that's how you can also, I feel like, manage your team
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:32.420]  so that everybody starts to buy into the fact that like,
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.540]  hey, we're going with this microbial world now.
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:38.020]  Or if they are more familiar with that,
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:41.740]  I feel like letting them play with the soil itself
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:43.180]  and that kind of thing,
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:48.180]  allowing the team to basically see the worms
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:50.980]  and the avocado tech and all the little tips and tricks,
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.300]  I feel like, that whatever it takes for you
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:57.700]  to trust the process is kind of where I was going with that.
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:00.460]  Yeah, and well said, well said.
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:03.900]  Hey, doing it big time in Humboldt, send me some compost.
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:08.140]  Want to get you in the Ventura County Compost Cup.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:13.060]  Go to venturacountycompost.com.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:15.980]  Come on, California, send me some samples.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:20.980]  Got to pitch that.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.620]  What do you got, Peter?
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:27.740]  Now I was looking for that web, hold on.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:32.740]  I was looking for that website, venturacountycompost.com.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:38.020]  Yep, I texted you a picture of it.
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:39.620]  Right, right, right.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:41.380]  But I'm trying to get the website.
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:47.460]  So VC compost.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.100]  Oh, VC compost.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:51.620]  Yep, vccompost.com.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:01.840]  Okay.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.680]  Struggling to get it up.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:09.040]  So did he text back or no?
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.840]  No, Brian, he didn't text back, did he?
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.000]  I don't know, I didn't text him.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.320]  That's why I was asking if, my phone was with my kids.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:22.120]  I can run into the house real quick.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.960]  Yeah, my good friend, Eric,
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.240]  basically we started talking about this months ago.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:36.760]  And just like pot thoughts, chilling out, hanging.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.280]  And he pulled this together in like a couple of weeks.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.840]  So what do you guys got growing on right now?
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.760]  What do you guys, like strain-wise and whatnot,
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.360]  what are you guys excited about?
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:51.000]  I can't grow where I am.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.280]  I signed a waiver at renting here in Oxnard.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.920]  So unfortunately I can't even grow.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.600]  And I did have a vegetable garden, it did really well,
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:04.000]  but they're doing a development nearby,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.680]  a 50 house development.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.160]  And we got overrun with groundhogs.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.400]  I mean, like in the cartoons,
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.680]  I'd see plants getting sucked down into the ground.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:15.280]  I was like, what the fuck's going on?
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:16.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.800]  So it's-
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.960]  That's when nature gets in the way like that.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.000]  That was my experience like with IMO.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.600]  Like when I first started collecting IMO, man,
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:26.760]  the animals were just relentless.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.400]  Like I didn't really have as much of a problem
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.480]  with it in Colorado.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:31.760]  Like the animals pretty much left my stuff alone.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.600]  But like when I came to Michigan,
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.440]  it was like every time I tried to set up an IMO collection,
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.120]  it's like something would get in there
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.880]  and just like completely contaminate the collection.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.160]  Like just pull right through.
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:51.560]  I tried like putting like the screens on and stuff
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.480]  and like stapling them on and stuff.
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.360]  And like some critter, you know,
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.320]  whether it be a mouse or whatever would find its way in
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:01.480]  and then it would, you know, no good anymore.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.640]  Yeah, they contaminated it in a heartbeat.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.120]  Well, they want you guys all to dab it up.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:11.600]  Begier, hit it.
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:14.000]  I've been doing one every 15 minutes.
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:16.720]  We've been dabbing a lot.
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.920]  We've been dabbing a lot.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.960]  By the way, Peter, he's gonna be calling you here
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:21.800]  in a second.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:22.640]  Oh, good.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.720]  Oh, so you got a one.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.960]  You all have been doing a dab every 15 minutes
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.480]  the last two hours?
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:29.320]  I don't think so.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.160]  How about Ryan?
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.000]  I've only taken like,
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.080]  I took like two like big ass mouse legs though.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.000]  So I haven't done this.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.160]  I'm testing a theory I have.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:42.080]  Maybe not big ass, but decent, decent legs.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.400]  Very big ass.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.960]  He does indeed speak.
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:48.800]  Yes.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:55.200]  Well, he has earned the nickname standing coma.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.040]  He can talk to.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.200]  There's one for you.
[02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:05.040]  All right.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.160]  You're up next, Andrew.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.280]  I'm up next?
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.600]  You're up next.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.440]  Okay.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:13.400]  I'm up next?
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:14.680]  You're up next.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.600]  I gotta heat up.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:16.720]  Hold on.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.640]  All right, heat it up.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.840]  Peter, get your shit warmed up.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.680]  Fuck no.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.240]  I'm still high from before.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.200]  And I got kids to deal with in like 20 minutes.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.040]  Hey, so did Tom plant that pot yet?
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.600]  I put the creeping thyme in there.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.440]  Okay.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.000]  And that sprouted and that's starting to come up
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:39.960]  and take hold.
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:42.520]  And then I wanted to, I told you before,
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.920]  I wanna put a full term plant in there
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.080]  and I haven't popped or brought the full.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.200]  I have a bunch of actually full terms
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.400]  that I'm transitioning to flower there.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.440]  And then I'm gonna bring them inside to finish
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.200]  cause the days are getting longer.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:02.120]  And then I'm gonna plant the full terms outside.
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:03.440]  Got you.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.280]  Got you.
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:05.120]  I was confused.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.080]  I thought with all those ones that you had,
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:07.960]  you had some full term seedlings.
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:10.520]  They were finishing.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.480]  So they're flowering right now.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:16.000]  We're about to pull those.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.160]  Okay.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.960]  Oh, so they're the ones?
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.120]  And then all the other ones that are there
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.000]  are juveniles and they're going into flower.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:29.400]  So I killed the supplemental lighting,
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.400]  but then the day is gonna get longer and longer here.
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.880]  So I gotta eventually just keep them inside to finish.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:38.840]  Got you.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.920]  As kind of an in-between harvest, but yeah.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.320]  What was the topic?
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:48.440]  What are you growing?
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.440]  Oh, so I have like some hazes and haze skunk crosses
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:01.240]  and I'm gonna pop some cat pissy stuff in the next round.
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:07.280]  I have the Roberts Creek Congo just showed up.
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.760]  There's a Topanga that just showed up.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.840]  I have cherry pie outside.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:17.800]  Oh, here we go.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.720]  Some James Loud auto flowers
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.160]  and I'm gonna pop some of Russian Land Race Bureau's
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.280]  autos as well.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:29.520]  Oh my God, it's our surprise guest.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.760]  What's up brother?
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.600]  What's up?
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:35.520]  What's up Sticky?
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.400]  So we were just talking about you buddy.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:40.040]  We're glad that you could jump on here live with us.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.160]  Right before you came on,
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.440]  we were joking that nothing impresses you ever.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.680]  You're always talking shit on everything.
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:49.800]  And so we'd love to have you come on here with somebody
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.640]  that you love to talk about, man,
[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:53.560]  that the community respects.
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.360]  So we appreciate you again,
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.240]  hopping on here real quick with us.
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.800]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.560]  Yeah, it's good to see you Andrew, how's it going?
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.200]  Good dude, how are you doing?
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:03.040]  Not bad.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.480]  Working?
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.640]  Yeah, he's got his homework in.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.480]  Yeah.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:11.320]  What are you working on?
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:12.640]  I'm building my head so,
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.960]  it catch most of the combos.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.440]  Well, what are you growing on?
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.560]  What am I growing?
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.400]  Yeah.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.800]  Oh, I'm at work right now.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:24.000]  That's really what I'm growing.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:28.440]  I've been focusing all my efforts on the career aspect
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.080]  of things, I guess you could say.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.720]  We wanted to get your insight Sticky
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:35.840]  on basically Andrew's work
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:37.160]  and some of the Sullivan stuff
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.120]  that we've all been able to smoke on his work
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:41.280]  and that kind of stuff.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  Yeah, pretty much when I met this cat
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:49.520]  he was doing things other people weren't doing.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.680]  And he kind of turned me onto the KNF scene
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.680]  and I was impressed by his work for sure.
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:01.520]  And like you say, I'm not impressed
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:02.600]  by too many people's stuff.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.440]  So it was kind of cool and refreshing
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:07.400]  to see somebody coming up that was,
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.600]  doing things all the right ways in my eyes.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:14.880]  You're gonna make me blush dude.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.720]  Pat.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:16.560]  Pat.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.760]  Keep crying my friend.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.360]  Thank you for those kind words.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:23.560]  So because you're such a connoisseur Sticky,
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:25.320]  what are some of the things that stick out
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:28.320]  with his artwork compared to some of the others
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.360]  that are in the game?
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.400]  Definitely is gonna be the taste.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:36.000]  And then from what I've heard from his research
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:36.840]  is the yield.
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:40.640]  So, I mean, I don't know if you can really beat that
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:42.440]  from the angle he's approaching it.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.880]  We were kind of getting into,
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:49.600]  he's kind of the full circle if you will.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:53.400]  Like he understands everything A to Z
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:54.800]  from the process standpoint.
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.400]  I feel like that really stands out
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.040]  because there's not really that many people out there
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:00.440]  that understand it at that level,
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:02.880]  each part of the system, the canvas
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:06.360]  that you're trying to put together to create that artwork.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:10.520]  Yeah, I mean, sorry, I'm a little distracted.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:11.360]  I'm at work.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:15.880]  A to Z is pretty much a one-stop shop for getting it done.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:18.800]  It seems, I mean, if he can become an electrician
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.920]  and a welding fabricator, then I think he's got it covered.
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:26.240]  I can weld, but I don't got the electrical yet.
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:29.440]  Working, you'll get it.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:30.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:33.760]  You love to cook as well, man.
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:34.960]  You're a man of many talents.
[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:37.400]  I've noticed on Instagram and stuff.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.320]  I appreciate that.
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:40.520]  Yeah, I do like cooking too.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:42.040]  That is definitely a passion.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:45.880]  I'm a man of flavor.
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:47.400]  I like my turfs and food
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.680]  and I like my turfs and my hash.
[02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:58.320]  So like Sticky, you work at a place that's well-respected.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.800]  It's really the coloring I feel like where
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:04.080]  the brand that you're with sticks out.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:07.080]  It's also what Andrew's product sticks out.
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:09.160]  I was trying to pull out of them a little bit more
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:13.040]  of the entire process that it takes to get to those
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:14.560]  because the yields really aren't there
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:18.040]  as far as what some people probably perceive.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.520]  And that's why the cost is always there as well.
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.480]  So is there any way you can kind of break that down
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:27.480]  for somebody that's maybe newer to smoking the top tier,
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.240]  which is from hanging out with you buddies,
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.800]  just chilling in your bathroom.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:37.720]  Yeah, the old carbon filter bathroom trick.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.480]  The old super fire in the bathroom trick.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.760]  Yeah, I mean, I think I've heard about,
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.480]  20% goes to about the 90 U-ish area
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:54.560]  of what you yield, something around there.
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:58.200]  So you're talking about raising a lot of cannabis
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.520]  for a little bit of tricholomes
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.960]  and then filtering out even the best of that.
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.720]  It's gonna get expensive.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.600]  I mean, it does, but there's also a good margin on that too.
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:15.440]  And I think that that's what varies as well as,
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:18.240]  sometimes like the 90 U will hit 20%.
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.880]  And that's like, I don't know, that's good.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:24.400]  But like I've seen like the 90 U hit even higher than that.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.200]  I mean, that's when things get really crazy
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  and that's when you can get into like yields that are like,
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:33.280]  I don't know, just extremely high and return a lot back
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:36.020]  and the final rosin product too.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:39.920]  Yeah.
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:42.040]  So what are realistic yields for you guys?
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:43.440]  Like what are you realistic seeing?
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.400]  Cause everybody's, it's almost like fish stories.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:49.920]  Everybody's killing it kind of thing.
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.320]  Well, realistically, I mean,
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:53.640]  it's completely depends on the genetics.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.320]  And I mean, and of the genetics,
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:56.880]  it's gonna depend on the phenos
[02:07:56.880 --> 02:07:59.620]  and the phenose selection is extremely important
[02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:01.440]  because even on these like strains
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.280]  that people are gonna be claiming as the big dumpers,
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:06.400]  like there's gonna be phenos in there
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.760]  that don't exactly hit, you know?
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.640]  And sometimes the ones that are dumping
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:15.640]  these ridiculous numbers, like nine, 10%, even like,
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.880]  sometimes those ones are a little bit on the blander side,
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:19.840]  but sometimes not.
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:21.660]  And that's when you really got a golden ticket.
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:26.140]  But I mean, those are sometimes fewer and far between,
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:28.500]  but all I gotta say about that is like,
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.940]  I didn't even see those numbers
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:32.760]  until I started like growing like organically
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:36.820]  and living soil and focusing more that way.
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:39.160]  And like I had this cut that like,
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:42.480]  I was pulling like over 10% on
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.700]  and I gave it away to one of my friends
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:48.260]  who runs like a synthetic garden and he does good on it.
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:51.040]  He gets like 7% on it though, you know?
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.880]  And that's gonna vary too per round.
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.260]  You can see like, you know,
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.660]  sometimes like a percent or two change per round.
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:00.080]  I mean, that's gonna come down to like, you know,
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.640]  if you let it dry on the stock at all,
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.000]  which I don't, I avoid like at all costs
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.960]  because I try to keep my soil balanced
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:10.280]  and try to keep that moisture present through the end.
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:13.880]  Like I'm not somebody who dries out the pot
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:14.860]  at the end of the cycle.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:18.160]  I think that's counterproductive to the plan
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:19.800]  and also to the next batch.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:27.040]  But yeah, that's, I always get on these tangents
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:29.520]  and then I'm like, where the fuck was I going?
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:30.720]  I get too stoned.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:31.560]  It's all good, man.
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:33.920]  You know, that's where we get those little gold nuggets
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.600]  and that's what Leighton and I really like
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600]  about doing it and Peter and Daguerre,
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:40.600]  we like doing it this way is that it comes out naturally
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:43.960]  so that it's like, you know, it's almost like, you know,
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.960]  everybody on the show has a lot of knowledge to give
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.800]  and so it's kind of like
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.160]  when we get these conversations going,
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.400]  we get you in those rants, Andrew,
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:51.880]  we can get you really talking, man.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:54.520]  And I feel like, and that's why we got sticky on here
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.560]  is there's gonna be a lot of people, in my opinion,
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.840]  are gonna be running your gear, bud.
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:09:59.680]  I'm trying to get-
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.400]  I mean, like realistically, like, I mean,
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:04.320]  what people are gonna see, like, you know,
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.720]  on running like my genetics is they're gonna see
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.400]  like some plants that are like, you know,
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.880]  maybe like three to 4% and maybe even some,
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.040]  a tiny bit less than that.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.680]  But in the mix, there's gonna be some like serious bangers
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:23.760]  and dumpers and you're gonna have to hunt them out.
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.720]  Like, and there's gonna be, you know,
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:27.920]  a higher percentage of, you know,
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.560]  profitable washers and whatnot,
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.560]  but it's just nothing's guaranteed as far as that goes.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.160]  You know?
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:38.880]  Were you just limbering up for your dab?
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:39.720]  Nice.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.560]  Yeah.
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:42.480]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.840]  You'd be amazed what he does when he's off screen back here,
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:49.040]  getting ready to do dabs on the show.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:53.840]  Yeah, like the hash yield is, it's like so largely like,
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  you know, has to do with like how the product was grown
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.600]  and how it was finished too,
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:03.160]  and how the material was handled in the finishing process.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:06.760]  That can take percents off the yield in general.
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:10.720]  So like, I think like, as a, like, you know,
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:12.480]  a seed person, it's hard to say like,
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.080]  you're gonna get these yields and whatnot,
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.640]  cause you don't know what people are doing to their plants.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:19.360]  Like I can say you're gonna have, you know,
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.120]  good luck finding washers out of here
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:22.360]  if you're doing that kind of thing.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.960]  But you know, it's like some people like,
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.080]  just like abuse like the nug and it's like,
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.280]  you can't like tell people they're gonna get this.
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:32.120]  And then, you know,
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.080]  like they're doing some crazy shit behind the scenes,
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:37.320]  like both in the grow and then in the harvesting process
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:40.520]  that affects the resin, like detrimentally.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:43.080]  One thing that like, I can like say that it's like,
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:45.800]  I've seen a lot is like people that just like
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.960]  throw all the material, like they're trimming it wet
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:50.520]  and they're bucking it off like the branches
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.360]  and they just throw it all in a turkey bag.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.680]  And then by the time like they're done,
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:58.120]  you pull it out and it's all stuck together.
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.600]  And that's just all resin that you could have collected,
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:03.280]  gone, like it's ruptured
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:05.440]  and you're never gonna be able to collect it again.
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.520]  And I don't know, it's like, it's always heartbreaking.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:11.600]  You're gonna lose like a big percentage of your yield
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.560]  because that's your outer resin.
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.920]  And that's the resin that makes up your highest
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:20.920]  like rosin return, so to speak, that's what's your juice.
[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:23.420]  And if you lose that outer resin,
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.780]  you're taking a big chunk off your yield.
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:30.720]  So that final step in the fresh frozen process
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:32.600]  is absolutely critical.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.320]  And I can't stress that enough.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.400]  It's more important than growing it organically
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.000]  or not organically or anything else is, you know,
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.340]  people are smashing these nugs together
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:45.940]  and they're losing like immeasurable amounts of profit.
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.140]  Sticky, you have a palette
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:52.300]  that I feel like rivals very few, man.
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:54.420]  I mean, you're up there with like,
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:55.740]  I don't even understand how you're able
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:58.180]  to taste some of the stuff that you do.
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:12:59.980]  So when the artwork is there,
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:01.780]  is that really where that allows you
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:05.740]  to taste some of those different flavor profiles
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:08.300]  that I feel like, to be honest with you,
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:10.140]  I don't have that same skillset.
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:15.140]  Yeah, I guess when you say you speak with the artwork
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.620]  when everything's done properly,
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.700]  when it's A to Z, seamed up, when it's not.
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.980]  Is that what allows you to be able to taste
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:25.580]  and identify some of those profiles
[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:28.260]  that I feel like a lot of people miss?
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:30.580]  I mean, it definitely helps.
[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:33.340]  I mean, I don't think you're gonna get
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:36.160]  as pronounced stuff if you take it super early
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:39.020]  or if you beat it up or, you know,
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:42.260]  all those things you was just speaking about,
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.660]  preparing it correctly.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:49.620]  Two is like a lot of these people are like trying to push,
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.660]  you know, earlier harvest for color and whatnot.
[02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:54.360]  And I mean, I can't stress enough
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.540]  that you should not be afraid to take those plants full term
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:58.940]  and if your stuff is quality,
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:01.860]  it's gonna be the same color on the full spectrum
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:03.500]  or however you pull it.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:07.540]  And I mean, that's pretty much the bottom line.
[02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:10.820]  I mean, there's no reason to sacrifice turps
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:15.620]  or the cannabinoid effect in pulling it early
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:18.660]  to try to get a color so that they can try to get,
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:21.600]  you know, an extra whatever on their gram.
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:28.400]  Yeah, they're usually just tricking their customers
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:30.100]  and that's the real beauty of,
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:33.540]  especially some of the customers here in Colorado stick
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:36.020]  is they're starting to be well-educated
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.860]  on what is quality and what is boof,
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:41.700]  what is the CRC bullshit kind of thing.
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:44.500]  Definitely.
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:45.460]  Like you were saying earlier,
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.820]  Colorado is kind of setting the bar for concentrates,
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:50.020]  it seems in the nation.
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:54.260]  At least they did a few years ago.
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:57.100]  And I mean, there's no, I don't know,
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:58.540]  it can go in any direction now
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.140]  because I mean, everybody's spread out
[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:02.300]  and there's, I mean, there's talented people
[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.780]  in every state at this point
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:08.780]  and people are kind of like cannabis migrants at this point.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:11.900]  You know, we're like, I can conclude in this,
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:15.660]  like I've just kind of like gone wherever the plant takes me
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:18.940]  and wherever I can just keep doing what I love.
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:22.980]  And I don't know, it's just kind of an everlasting journey
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:24.500]  and I'm sure it lasts, you know,
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:26.020]  it's that way for a lot of us, you know,
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:28.060]  I think that's a common thread for a lot of people
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:30.140]  that are chasing that dream is, you know,
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:32.220]  you gotta make sacrifices,
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:37.380]  you just gotta move past like your comfort zone sometimes
[02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:38.900]  and move away from your family
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:42.500]  and, you know, chase what you really wanna do.
[02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:49.510]  I'm excited to see you doing what you love to do, man.
[02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:52.470]  Say again, Swiggy?
[02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:55.070]  Well guys, I gotta get rolling.
[02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:58.110]  We appreciate you, bud.
[02:15:58.110 --> 02:15:59.590]  My battery's dying.
[02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:00.630]  Have a good one, dude.
[02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:01.470]  Peace out, brother.
[02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:03.270]  Peace out, brother, good seeing you.
[02:16:07.070 --> 02:16:10.030]  Shh, I'm back.
[02:16:12.230 --> 02:16:14.150]  That was nice of him, man, he is always working,
[02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:15.990]  so appreciate him doing that.
[02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:20.390]  One of the people asked in the chat, what is he doing?
[02:16:20.390 --> 02:16:21.550]  Is he growing?
[02:16:21.550 --> 02:16:22.710]  Is he working in a grow?
[02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:23.790]  Yeah, he works at a grow
[02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:26.070]  at a pretty prestigious place here in Denver.
[02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:29.430]  He looks like he had like a girlfriend
[02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:31.790]  who wanted to hang out over his shoulder.
[02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:34.670]  And he's like, no, no, no, I just gotta do this one thing,
[02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:35.630]  it's really important.
[02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:37.150]  And then like, she's looking at him,
[02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:39.990]  like you're just talking to a bunch of dudes
[02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:41.590]  who are getting high right now.
[02:16:41.590 --> 02:16:44.550]  And he's like, no, no, no, just one more second.
[02:16:48.430 --> 02:16:49.470]  Is that you, Layton?
[02:16:49.470 --> 02:16:51.590]  No, that's not one of those outside.
[02:16:52.590 --> 02:16:54.470]  That's gotta be Andrew's pup.
[02:16:57.970 --> 02:16:59.650]  I know, he just muted himself.
[02:17:02.130 --> 02:17:02.970]  That's funny.
[02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:08.380]  Should we wrap it on that?
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:14.660]  Yeah, guys, we appreciate your time, Andrew.
[02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:16.540]  Thank you, thank you again.
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:18.860]  And for everybody interested,
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:22.260]  stay tuned for the July 23rd,
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:24.900]  gonna be some novelty seeds.
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:28.260]  Make sure you post it up, my friend.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:29.580]  Will do.
[02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:30.860]  Yeah, it's on my page,
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:34.140]  I post it up like the Rockies,
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:35.860]  I post it up like the Rockies emblem
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:37.660]  and put the drop information on there.
[02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:40.940]  So anybody interested, refer to that post
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:44.820]  and have some good fruity surprises.
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:49.180]  Nice.
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:51.900]  All right.
[02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:58.500]  So Layton, I gotta bring, is this afternoon going on?
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.340]  Yeah.
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:03.660]  Okay, I'll probably disappear for big parts of it
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.380]  because I gotta bring Gemma to get a COVID test.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.700]  Hey, I'm up to now, guys, thanks for having me.
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:09.100]  All right, thanks, brother.
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:09.940]  Much appreciated.
[02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:12.140]  All right, and...
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:17.860]  So you can start it and then you can just bail,
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:19.540]  just make sure I'm a moderator.
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:20.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:22.660]  Okay.
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:23.620]  All right.
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.500]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:26.340]  Any last-
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:27.300]  See you guys next week.
[02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:29.220]  Peanut Gallery.
[02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:31.180]  So are we still live?
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:32.260]  We are still live.
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:33.220]  Yeah.
[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:35.060]  Yeah, don't get crazy.
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:36.260]  I know, all right.
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:41.260]  Layton's gonna get naked and streak through hemp fields.
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:45.180]  I'm gonna go get some compost corn going.
[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:47.740]  Through Ventura County hemp fields.
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:48.580]  There you go.
[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:49.900]  People will be like, is that a naked guy
[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:51.780]  running through that field over there?
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:52.620]  Yeah.
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:56.260]  All right.
[02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:59.420]  Kill the feed, because I gotta house clean.
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:01.100]  All right, see everyone.
