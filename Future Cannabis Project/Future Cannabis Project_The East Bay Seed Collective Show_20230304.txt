[00:00.000 --> 00:13.080]  All right. Hello. We're live with the East Precinct Collective show. Good morning, everybody.
[00:13.080 --> 00:21.600]  Right now we have some hemp breeders. We have Jeremy, who was on my show before, and he
[00:21.600 --> 00:27.600]  is coming back on with some of his friends, and we're going to talk hemp. Would you guys
[00:27.600 --> 00:34.880]  like to introduce yourselves? Sure. I'm Thomas Swanson. I'm the owner and operator of High
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.040]  Alpine Genetics, and I just try to put out open source genetics for the people mostly,
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.160]  so that's my company's goal. Yeah, I'm Josh Turner. I'm the founder and
[00:48.160 --> 00:56.440]  owner and operator of Yellowhammer Genetics. We do a wide variety of cannabis breeding,
[00:56.440 --> 01:06.400]  type 1s, type 2s, type 3s. We've been doing industrial hemp breeding since 2015, 2014,
[01:06.400 --> 01:15.160]  I guess really, and type 1 stuff since around 2002. We've been breeding for quite a while,
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.960]  and it's good to be here. Awesome.
[01:19.960 --> 01:27.400]  Cool. I'm Jeremy Kledtke. I'm the founder of Davis Farms of Oregon, and I cut from the same
[01:27.400 --> 01:33.880]  cloth as these guys. Lots of years in the space, came out of medical into whatever this is,
[01:33.880 --> 01:44.120]  and decided to stay into type 3 because we were already doing type 2 and some closer to type 3
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.080]  varieties, and so we ended up going to the hemp side. I'd say that one common thread that we all
[01:49.080 --> 01:53.720]  have is that we're breeders of diverse genetics. I like the way Thomas put it, that we're,
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.640]  I think we're all that, and I'm sorry if I claimed that a little bit, Thomas, but we're
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.080]  all breeders of genetics for the people. We want to see diversity. We want to see quality. We want
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.320]  to see people have stuff that's stable and good and fun to grow, so that's one thing I think all
[02:09.320 --> 02:18.280]  three of us have in common. Yeah. Excellent. Well, I kind of wanted to start with a
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.920]  somewhat different question to start off today, so I don't know. We'll see how this goes. I mean,
[02:26.920 --> 02:34.600]  all of us have been in this industry for a while, and it's very difficult to find a balanced
[02:34.600 --> 02:41.560]  lifestyle often within this industry, and so my main question, or this question is,
[02:42.040 --> 02:50.040]  how do you guys balance your personal life and your career in this field? Because I feel like
[02:50.040 --> 02:54.440]  for a lot of people in this industry, that's a continuous issue is how to find the balance.
[02:56.520 --> 03:02.840]  Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, I don't really. I work all the time. Just like right now, I'm like,
[03:02.840 --> 03:09.080]  oh, shit, I got to be on a podcast, and I got to go clone. We got to finish planting a 224 room,
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.560]  and then I have to put out orders, so it's crazy hectic just to make it, and I think
[03:16.120 --> 03:20.040]  everyone feels that in the cannabis industry is you have to hustle all the time, not only
[03:21.800 --> 03:27.080]  put yourself out there, but always put new stuff out there and blow the market wide open,
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.240]  and that's not always possible, especially in the THC industry, so we're kind of lucky that we have
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.440]  an avenue to do that, but like I said, I have to make time for my personal life,
[03:38.440 --> 03:42.440]  so I have to go time, make time and see my girlfriend, or make time and go skiing or
[03:42.440 --> 03:47.720]  something, but I haven't been skiing. I grew up in Colorado, and I haven't been skiing until this
[03:47.720 --> 03:57.000]  year since 2017, I think, so you know what I mean, but what about you guys? Yeah, I don't know. I'd
[03:57.000 --> 04:05.560]  say from my side, that's one thing that's really changed with legal, above-board cannabis. The more
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.760]  regulated it's gotten, the more that we have to pay attention to compliance issues, and the
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.200]  more rigid things have become, and the more competitive. I think it's one thing
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.520]  Thomas and Josh and I all share, is there were grassroots companies who have remained very
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.720]  competitive in a market that a lot of times we have people with a lot more weight to throw around
[04:25.720 --> 04:32.680]  than we do as far as capital, so it takes a lot of drive for us to maintain that, but it's really,
[04:32.680 --> 04:39.160]  you know, you commit to this, I guess is what I'm saying. Since legal cannabis came along,
[04:39.160 --> 04:44.440]  like I mean before that, there was time. We made time. The operations, I think, were smaller.
[04:45.720 --> 04:51.000]  We were able to make a living a little bit better that way, and so I think we all had lives probably
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.560]  where we made time to do hiking and skiing and snowboarding or whatever our fancies were,
[04:58.120 --> 05:04.040]  and I think we had a lot more time for our family, you know, our families, but yeah, that's what I'd
[05:04.040 --> 05:08.040]  say is there's not a lot of balance. I guess what I'm trying to say is you have to kind of be
[05:08.040 --> 05:13.880]  all in to do this, and in order to do that, you have to find people that'll be by your side that
[05:13.880 --> 05:19.240]  are in the space or as committed or passionate about the space as you are, and I think in Thomas's
[05:19.240 --> 05:25.560]  case, he has family that's there supporting him, and Josh's case, his wife is like right there by
[05:25.560 --> 05:30.200]  his side in everything that they do. I'd be surprised if she wasn't sitting there right next
[05:30.200 --> 05:38.040]  to him now, and the same with where I'm at. I have a girl that's deeply engaged and involved
[05:38.040 --> 05:42.600]  in the industry, and that's her life as well, but man, this is something that's...
[05:44.040 --> 05:48.120]  What else can you say but we have a huge passion for the plant, right? It's the passion for the
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.840]  plant that drives us, and I think all four of us, including you, Jamal, feel that, so there's my
[05:52.840 --> 06:02.360]  two cents on that. Love to hear your guys. Yeah, I'll say for me, it's difficult to strike that
[06:02.360 --> 06:15.240]  balance between your personal life and running the business. For example, in 2021, I was
[06:16.200 --> 06:23.880]  taking a job as a director of cultivation for a large company, and I think that whole year,
[06:23.880 --> 06:30.680]  I was home for like 10 days, including the weekends, so I was constantly traveling out on
[06:30.680 --> 06:38.200]  the road and still trying to keep a company running and breeding projects going and all of
[06:38.200 --> 06:46.200]  that stuff, and so it can be a bit overwhelming, and then you have to make time,
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.800]  you have to find the time, and I think a lot of it comes back to prioritizing.
[06:54.040 --> 06:58.600]  There's always something to do in the garden. There's always a breeding project, there's always
[06:58.600 --> 07:03.960]  clones to cut, there's always something to do, and you're just never gonna get caught up on
[07:03.960 --> 07:08.040]  everything, and so at some point, you have to figure out, it's like, okay, I can get to this
[07:08.040 --> 07:12.440]  stopping point, and the rest of this can wait for tomorrow, and then I can go have dinner with my
[07:12.440 --> 07:19.800]  family and go. I used to fish all the time. I haven't been fishing. I got a brand new Thomas
[07:19.800 --> 07:25.800]  Fly Rod that's still in the bag I got when I first moved to Massachusetts in 2019. I haven't
[07:25.800 --> 07:33.320]  even put a reel on this thing, so it's difficult at times to balance, especially when you're a
[07:33.320 --> 07:40.040]  small company and you're running everything. It does help to have a partner who's also engaged
[07:40.040 --> 07:48.680]  and involved in the industry, and so that helps out a lot. Like Jeremy was saying,
[07:48.680 --> 07:57.160]  my partner is very supportive of what I'm doing and is learning the ropes on how to grow and how
[07:57.160 --> 08:03.160]  to take care of plants and do all of this stuff, and so that helps out a lot because now it's like,
[08:03.720 --> 08:09.160]  not just me doing everything by myself. I've got some help, but it also becomes something you can
[08:09.160 --> 08:15.800]  kind of do together, and it's kind of a bonding thing, so that helps out as well, but when we...
[08:15.800 --> 08:22.520]  I mean, we handle everything from advertising and doing the breeding project, taking care of
[08:22.520 --> 08:28.120]  mother plants, packaging the seeds, cleaning the seeds, and shipping out orders, order fulfillment,
[08:28.120 --> 08:33.000]  and all of that, so it's a lot of work, and it can be difficult to manage that
[08:33.880 --> 08:39.320]  healthy life balance for sure. For sure. I mean, I guess my two cents would be,
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.720]  I agree with you guys. I find it difficult to strike that balance. I have a two-year-old,
[08:45.720 --> 08:53.240]  so I'm kind of now becoming a father and learning that whole balance as well. I guess what I've
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.840]  kind of read from your guys' responses and from my own experience, it's kind of like a 100%
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.120]  thing, and you just do it, and then at a certain point, you just got to take a break,
[09:04.120 --> 09:11.560]  take a break for a little bit, and then come right back to 100%. It's something I've been
[09:11.560 --> 09:17.160]  starting to struggle with because I want to be in this for a long time, and I also see a lot of
[09:17.160 --> 09:23.880]  people that are getting burnt out in the industry. I've always just been very curious how
[09:23.880 --> 09:31.160]  people are able to strike that balance. Jamal, I'd jump in and say this is a part of why I want
[09:31.160 --> 09:37.720]  these guys to be sitting on a podcast with these guys and with you or on a YouTube, on FCP with
[09:37.720 --> 09:44.600]  you. I think that one way that we can do this, create something more sustainable for all of us
[09:44.600 --> 09:52.520]  is through cooperation, competition, collaboration. We're all small, prominent brands,
[09:52.520 --> 10:00.600]  and we see a drive for these multi-state operators to kind of homogenize and corporatize the space,
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.400]  and every time they do that a little bit more, they shrink us down a little bit more. It's just
[10:05.400 --> 10:12.200]  reductionist mathematics, if you will, and so a lot of, I think, getting us to be in a sustainable
[10:12.200 --> 10:19.080]  place is finding these great people because I can tell you this, these guys here are two of the
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.680]  best breeders, I think, in the space period and have consistently been. All of us came from legacy
[10:25.480 --> 10:33.000]  to medical to this new legal market, and I think we have a lot to offer.
[10:34.040 --> 10:41.560]  Whatever we can do to stay together and, of course, keep things moving, but, of course,
[10:41.560 --> 10:46.840]  the back of that is very selfish. It's like, hey, we're all struggling a little bit, man.
[10:46.840 --> 10:53.320]  Let's all get together, figure this out, and wherever, again, the three words, it can be,
[10:53.320 --> 10:59.320]  you know, cooperation, competition. You're talking to three guys that really couldn't be more
[10:59.320 --> 11:05.960]  competitive in the industry as well as far as we're directly in the same lanes doing the same
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.800]  things, right? But this is the beauty of the planet. It's so freaking nuanced and so diverse
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.600]  that it has so much to offer us that there's no way we can really step on each other's toes,
[11:17.240 --> 11:26.200]  and two, we've all gotten here. There he is right on, Pat. So we've all gotten here by
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.640]  supporting the plant and supporting each other in some way, shape, or form through the years. So
[11:31.640 --> 11:40.120]  there's my podium. Awesome. Yeah. I mean, sorry, please, Yellowhammer. Please, please.
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.600]  Oh, I was just saying that was well said. I think Jeremy's right in that, you know,
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.280]  this industry is getting much more competitive. Markets are compressing. Things are getting,
[11:51.320 --> 11:56.440]  you know, things are getting a little crazy, especially in the adult use side of things.
[11:56.440 --> 12:03.320]  We're seeing medical kind of disappear, and we're moving to more of this tax, heavy tax base model,
[12:04.520 --> 12:10.840]  which that could be a whole show in and of itself to discuss that. But I think Jeremy is spot on
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.560]  where there's a lot of opportunity to collaborate, to cooperate with each other, and to work
[12:17.160 --> 12:25.000]  parallel with each other to advance the plant, advance the community, advance our culture,
[12:25.000 --> 12:35.160]  and not have to step on everybody's toes. Yeah, definitely. We have Patrick the soil king.
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.720]  He has been putting together a really awesome event, and I reached out to him to
[12:46.600 --> 12:50.520]  to, you know, make a little PSA about the event that's happening next Saturday.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.080]  Would you like to share that with us? Yeah, what's happening? Man, I, hey, Jeremy, how's it going?
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.920]  Yeah, I just caught the tail end of that very important subject you guys were talking about
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.560]  right there. Sorry I'm late. I've been doing marketing for the show, you know, content,
[13:10.440 --> 13:16.440]  you know, how much editing time takes. So, sorry I'm a little late on this. But yeah,
[13:16.440 --> 13:25.560]  definitely. So, Soil King Legends of Legacy is a 2021 was, you know, the precursor to it,
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.960]  trying to get it up and going. But the idea is just to take across the country,
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.360]  Legends of Legacy, it's called Soil King Legends of Legacy. There's different parts, David versus
[13:36.360 --> 13:42.040]  Goliath tour, and where we go to events, you know, there's a bunch of different events. The next one
[13:42.680 --> 13:50.920]  on that one is going to be Kansas City, Missouri, which is a cannafest. And super excited on the
[13:50.920 --> 13:58.920]  414 and 415 on that. But the idea is to bring legacy that has the right and should be should
[13:58.920 --> 14:04.920]  be highlighted in our industry across the country. I mean, there in every state we have legacy and
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.960]  there's legacy across the board. I mean, not just cannabis. I mean, there's breeders, there's
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.000]  legacy and big agriculture, there's legacy and music, right? There's legacy and a lot of
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.720]  different things. And legacy seems this legacy pioneers, these industries are where they're at
[14:21.720 --> 14:27.160]  today. And then, and then a lot of new companies and corporations, especially the corporations come
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.360]  in, and they they don't give you knowledge and respect to those who gave their fucking life
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.800]  for this industry. And you know, and so the idea of this whole thing is to get
[14:39.320 --> 14:46.920]  awareness of why can you make money in the industry called cannabis today? I'll tell you why.
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.440]  For a lot of us, we gave it all we lost our families went to prison, we did a lot of things
[14:52.440 --> 14:57.640]  and did not acknowledge and respect those who paved the way and pioneered the industry where
[14:57.640 --> 15:04.760]  it's at today is downright disrespectful. And and did and the disrespectful side is that we
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.280]  most people don't know who did the hard work to get us where we're at today. So the idea is let's
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.280]  build this thing out. Let's bring legacy. It's all everybody's event to come in and to start
[15:17.480 --> 15:23.160]  giving people the idea why why are you why are you in the legal side or even the you know,
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.320]  the illegal side of cannabis? This is where we came from. Why are you putting money in your pocket?
[15:27.320 --> 15:31.560]  Why are you struggling today? And you're hearing all this and you're talking to people and it's
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.160]  great because there's a whole new set of pioneers out there that are so needed in the new era of
[15:37.160 --> 15:44.840]  cannabis and other other industries. But those who gave all need to be acknowledged without
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.520]  how are they going to get acknowledged? They're only going to get acknowledged if we talk about
[15:48.520 --> 15:53.400]  it and show them and and you know, highlight them. So that's the idea. And there's legacy
[15:53.400 --> 15:59.880]  across the whole world, right? In cannabis and people don't know where the roots came from.
[15:59.880 --> 16:06.440]  You know, people don't know. This is interesting. I just made a post on LinkedIn, I believe it was
[16:06.440 --> 16:13.160]  yesterday or day before. You could it's almost like you're reading from that post Patrick where
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.360]  I talked about this exactly like what's going on in the industry, how
[16:18.920 --> 16:30.120]  the corporate side has come in and just pushed the legacy market out and squeezed us out. I mean,
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.720]  look at what's going on. And I used to live in Laytonville and I go back up there. It doesn't
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.920]  even look like the same place that I lived in five years ago. Like everything Garberville,
[16:40.920 --> 16:47.560]  Leggett, Willits, you know, all are everything in Northern California is just completely changed
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.480]  and they're in trouble. They're in real trouble up there right now. And that's, you know,
[16:51.480 --> 16:58.520]  the Emerald Triangle is it was it was the Mecca of cannabis for 50 years. You know, I mean, it's
[16:58.520 --> 17:03.480]  been where some of the best cannabis like as breeders, a lot of the genetics that we work with,
[17:04.040 --> 17:08.520]  you know, came from the Emerald Triangle. And right. So like right there. Yeah. Yeah.
[17:08.920 --> 17:18.040]  You see, to see the the the corporate side of this, just be so disrespectful towards the
[17:19.480 --> 17:24.360]  towards the legacy market and to just squeeze everybody out and try to outcompete and to not
[17:24.360 --> 17:27.880]  have that cooperation and collaboration that Jeremy was talking about a few minutes ago.
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.280]  It's really it's really frustrating as somebody who's been doing this. You know,
[17:32.280 --> 17:37.800]  like I grew up in northeast Alabama and started growing in the hills and was a griller grower,
[17:37.800 --> 17:42.360]  hiking up the side of mountains every summer and with a backpack and toting water up and down the
[17:42.360 --> 17:49.080]  hills. And like I paid my dues that way. But, you know, there was a there was a risky side of that.
[17:49.080 --> 17:54.600]  It was 20 to life. Right. Like it wasn't like I was just like, oh, just go. Let's go plant some
[17:54.600 --> 17:57.880]  plants on the side of the mountain. Like this shit was serious. That's right.
[17:58.680 --> 18:02.920]  To fight this war of genocide, there was consequences, man, like potentially seven
[18:02.920 --> 18:08.840]  years or more in federal time. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what it was. It was a war against genocide
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.160]  and that the version, the diversity preservation is what all those corporate guys are benefiting
[18:13.160 --> 18:18.680]  from today. Yeah. I mean, it's so important of a discussion. This is so important of a discussion.
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.640]  You know, first time handcuffs for me is 11 years old. I've done just under seven years behind bars,
[18:23.640 --> 18:29.480]  San Quentin, I mean, jail, but just for this plant. Right. And there's two common denominators in my
[18:29.480 --> 18:34.440]  entire life. One is peanut butter, because I had a rough childhood and the comfort food for me to
[18:34.440 --> 18:39.560]  live upon was water and peanut butter and agriculture hands in the fucking soil and growing
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.600]  weed. And so you talk about breeders in northern California, across the world. The other part of
[18:44.600 --> 18:51.080]  this whole thing is, is that word breeder really gets to me because I know breeders out there that
[18:51.080 --> 18:57.960]  are hardworking, putting dedicated their entire life to come up with the structure of a plant
[18:57.960 --> 19:03.400]  in a culture bar that we get to grow out from that. But now all these new people down the line,
[19:03.400 --> 19:09.240]  they get to stamp themselves as a breeder. For me, that is super disrespectful for the guys who
[19:09.240 --> 19:15.240]  paved the way. I can't walk on to a job site and never fucking twisted some wire and call me
[19:15.240 --> 19:20.440]  attorney and electricity, electricity, you know, so the theories and there's nothing wrong with
[19:20.440 --> 19:26.920]  down the line. Right. Because there's there's one awesome and, you know, that are coming out of F1s
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.200]  and F2s that are great. And there's nothing wrong with that. But how do we highlight those who gave
[19:32.200 --> 19:39.560]  their entire life right and have a have a brand have a tag of a breeder or a legacy breeder? Maybe
[19:39.560 --> 19:46.920]  we call it that. Yeah, that person gave it fucking all. And then somebody else comes in now and gets
[19:46.920 --> 19:52.680]  the same title. I don't I don't I don't I'm not down with it. I'm just not OK with that. There's
[19:52.680 --> 19:57.480]  a problem that we need to talk about. And I'm not knocking other breeders down the line at all.
[19:58.440 --> 20:02.280]  But I'm saying, you know, like there's old pioneers, there's new pioneers. There's you know,
[20:02.280 --> 20:08.680]  I'm an outlaw to pioneer. Right. I came from that. I'm turning the I'm turning the torch over to the
[20:08.680 --> 20:14.440]  new pioneers that are going to change the world as cannabis agriculture industry is. They're super,
[20:14.440 --> 20:20.920]  super important. Right. And so going back and talking, we need to just need to make sure that
[20:20.920 --> 20:28.920]  the legacy, you know, in our industry is held with respect and honor and dignity. And, you know,
[20:28.920 --> 20:33.160]  you're talking about Laytonville falling apart. Oh, my God, man. This is my this is my Emerald
[20:33.160 --> 20:38.840]  Triangle, right? This is where I'm at. I fight for these farmers my entire life. This is what I do.
[20:38.840 --> 20:43.400]  The next event that's happening next weekend, the 10th and 11th. That was just one part with
[20:43.400 --> 20:48.520]  Legends of Legacy gave David versus Goliath tour. Now we have the Legends of Legacy,
[20:48.520 --> 20:55.160]  Soil King Legends of Legacy monthly marketplace in at the Garden Center and my garden, Soil King
[20:55.160 --> 20:59.640]  Garden Center that's converting to Soil King Community Marketplace and getting rid of the
[20:59.640 --> 21:05.400]  garden center. It's a monthly marketplace. And what it is is for legacy. We have two different.
[21:05.400 --> 21:12.120]  We have a Friday night. That's a that's a invite closed party. So, you know, all of us that are
[21:12.120 --> 21:19.560]  outside the legal industry, we still have a platform to come meet and greet. And brokers
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.200]  are coming from New York and L.A. just to come meet people. Right. So we have that. And then
[21:24.200 --> 21:29.320]  Saturday is a legal market. We're trying to get survival to some of these licenses that are
[21:29.320 --> 21:37.800]  falling. We lost so much. I mean, we right now we have six licenses in Mendocino County. Right.
[21:37.800 --> 21:44.920]  Not a five or six thousand dollars, five or six thousand two years ago. So I we had we have
[21:44.920 --> 21:52.360]  Woodman Peak Farms. We started Woodman Peak Farms in 2014. Me and my buddy Chris Vaughn and we
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  didn't operate our we didn't operate our license in Mendocino this year. We we went we leased some
[21:59.000 --> 22:06.520]  land in Upper Lake and did a project there. But yeah, Mendocino's I mean, with the ten thousand,
[22:06.520 --> 22:09.880]  you know, square foot canopy cap and stuff like that, it's tough.
[22:11.320 --> 22:15.720]  Yes. The board of supervisors walked away from the whole problem after they took everybody's
[22:15.720 --> 22:19.240]  fucking hundreds of thousands of dollars from cultivator, millions of dollars
[22:19.240 --> 22:25.400]  collaboratively and just shut the fucking key off. Well, that's right now. But everybody
[22:25.400 --> 22:30.600]  out of compliance. It's insane. It's like like how did we ever get here? I'll tell you how we
[22:30.600 --> 22:36.120]  got here is we just didn't show up in numbers when we when when people voted for Prop 64.
[22:36.120 --> 22:39.320]  Right. And they didn't read the bill and they thought it was going to be great. You got Gavin
[22:39.320 --> 22:44.440]  Newsom, who's a fucking piece of shit, you know, and you got all the sorry if I'm cussing on this,
[22:44.440 --> 22:50.120]  but this is who I am, what I do. Right. Fuck you, Gavin. And and all these all these big
[22:50.120 --> 22:55.720]  commercial players, they came in the back room at the at the Capitol at the last meeting and they
[22:56.040 --> 23:01.800]  pulled that 10,000 square foot and allowed multiple licenses stackable across the state.
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.120]  They did this right at the end of this and what they did in Mendocino County,
[23:06.120 --> 23:10.360]  Animal Triangle. We don't we don't we can't do acres because we live in the mountains.
[23:10.360 --> 23:15.640]  Right. And you got to you have to actually cut fire road. You can't use your goat trails anymore.
[23:15.640 --> 23:20.360]  You got to have fire roads. Got to have bunkers and turnarounds and all this stuff where
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.600]  only a compliant have to do any of that. So, I mean, it was a it was a shit show that happened
[23:27.720 --> 23:32.760]  and how why did it happen that way? Because of us, because we don't show up in numbers.
[23:32.760 --> 23:38.360]  And this is a message across the United States coming online right now. If you're if you want to
[23:38.360 --> 23:43.720]  talk about activism and not being about it, you're the problem. You're not going to show up in
[23:43.720 --> 23:49.800]  numbers to support against this monstrosity of bullshit that's going to come at you and try to
[23:49.880 --> 23:54.280]  regulate you in the wrong direction. You're the problem. We learned our lesson because there was
[23:54.280 --> 24:01.560]  only a few that all showed up and we everybody in Emerald Triangle would say, great job. Yeah,
[24:01.560 --> 24:04.760]  keep showing up. We love you. I'm like, where are you at? You said you're going to be here.
[24:04.760 --> 24:09.400]  Nobody showed up. Nobody showed up. Well, guess what? We got our asses kicked because we only had
[24:09.400 --> 24:14.200]  a few at the table. All right. We didn't have a voice. We didn't have the power of the people.
[24:14.200 --> 24:18.680]  So take that as a message. If you want to change things, show the fuck up, man.
[24:18.680 --> 24:26.120]  Show up or shut up, really. And when people like Patrick schedule events, come to them.
[24:27.640 --> 24:34.200]  That's a monthly market. This one's badass. So we have we have brokers coming Friday night,
[24:34.200 --> 24:39.080]  pre-party. It's a private event. We have all legacy spot, you know, legacy coming from out
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.640]  of the fucking hills on Friday night just to meet and greet people. We have people flying from all
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.680]  over the world just to come to the Friday night. And we're doing a monthly marketplace. The whole
[24:48.680 --> 24:54.680]  idea is because our small legacy farmers across the straight state, we don't have access to
[24:54.680 --> 25:01.880]  dispensaries because dispensaries aren't supporting us. For one is we we have we have low numbers of
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.840]  products. So we grow only a certain batch of this flavor this year, this flavor and dispensaries.
[25:06.840 --> 25:13.720]  It's just easier for them to take, you know, a fucking shit ton of cheap mid product and have a
[25:13.720 --> 25:19.400]  repetition of the cold or the buyer coming back and back or just that's you. And we don't get
[25:19.400 --> 25:23.880]  supported. So I'm like, fuck it. Let's do our own event. Let's do our own market event. We're going
[25:23.880 --> 25:28.520]  to do it in northern California and southern California. We're going to bring it and we're
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.640]  going to explode this fucking thing. Right. I'm not I'm not applying for licenses. Fuck you. I'm
[25:33.640 --> 25:37.960]  not giving you my money. I'm not giving the state my money. I'm doing a delivery service.
[25:37.960 --> 25:44.200]  I'm hosting the Saturday. It's no we're working on it right now to have consumption on site. But
[25:44.200 --> 25:49.240]  right now I can't. Otherwise, I got to go through the city. I got to have all these special licenses.
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.440]  I have to I have to get the state license and I have to go to council. I got to get approvals.
[25:54.440 --> 26:00.520]  Guess what? Fuck you and your approvals. We're going to save our industry. We're housing a
[26:00.520 --> 26:05.240]  marketplace that we're going to have a delivery service out outside. And if you want to come in,
[26:05.240 --> 26:10.760]  you want to meet a cultivator, a legacy cultivator, old school motherfucker that does the craft,
[26:10.760 --> 26:15.000]  the best of the ability in the world. Right. And doing it his whole life, three generations,
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.600]  you're going to be able to look at him. You're going to be able to get a QR code and you're
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.240]  going to order your product and it's going to show up in a van out front on a delivery.
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.440]  That's how we're going to get through this shit right now. Yeah, I think we need to go back to
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.280]  what we you know, we had to overgrow the government. Now we've got to overgrow the
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.840]  corporation and the government again with the regulations. We need to make sure every state
[26:38.840 --> 26:45.240]  that comes online from here on home grow right. We need to really support home growers and
[26:45.240 --> 26:50.360]  everybody needs to be growing a garden. And if everybody's growing a garden and we can we can
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.560]  get that real free market back, everybody goes to the black market or whatever. No, it's a real
[26:55.560 --> 27:01.320]  free capital market. It's probably the only true free capital market in the US. And we need that.
[27:01.320 --> 27:07.000]  We need that to exist. We need that. It works so well. Like if you look at the prop 215 model,
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.640]  there was problems with it here and there. But by God, it was a pretty sustainable model.
[27:11.640 --> 27:16.280]  And it built a lot of generational wealth for a lot of people and put a lot of food on a lot
[27:16.280 --> 27:22.040]  of tables and allow people to buy farms and buy homes, buy lands. And it allowed people to
[27:22.600 --> 27:28.040]  build themselves from the ground up. And we just we just wipe that all away with a pen overnight.
[27:28.040 --> 27:35.640]  Like you said, it's so on point. The problem with the 215 movement is we had everybody growing 99
[27:35.640 --> 27:41.480]  plants and they were spraying fucking Abbott and all this shit and growing deadly fucking
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.520]  products and selling them in the name of medicine, sacrilegiously, just fucking,
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.280]  fucking everybody over that. And that was the problem. And the only thing that legal cannabis
[27:52.280 --> 28:00.680]  has provided is testing and testing across the states is completely fucked up. It's about 75%
[28:00.680 --> 28:06.120]  right. But at least we have for stuff, right? And there's and so that is very, very important. If
[28:06.120 --> 28:12.120]  you're a medicinal user, and somebody selling it to you in the name of medicine, and you don't know
[28:12.120 --> 28:17.480]  what they did, how they cultivated what they put on it, there's a good chance that you're doing,
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.160]  you're killing yourself instead of helping yourself. And that's that was the problem with
[28:21.160 --> 28:26.360]  the 215 movement. And then to go back into where we need to go with corporate and you said it when
[28:26.360 --> 28:33.960]  we at home, medical growing at your home is so needed. Patients, right? And all that stuff is
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.360]  needed. But we're not going to get away from the corporate corporates here to stay. They're,
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.360]  they're going to be here today, what we need to do is find out how we can build a bridge.
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.040]  With those who want to actually sit at our table, pull the chair out, look us in the eyes,
[28:48.040 --> 28:53.240]  shake our hands, say thank you for the pioneering you did. If they can't do that, get the fuck out
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.480]  of the room, because you're not welcome. We're up building the bridge. But there has to be
[28:57.480 --> 29:03.560]  an opportunity this we're going into an era where we are the small people, they will overpower us,
[29:03.560 --> 29:07.480]  there's no doubt about it, we're going to lose this storm, unless we figure out a working
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.680]  relationship, unfortunately. But that's the way it's going to be. How do we do that? You know,
[29:12.680 --> 29:19.240]  we do a lot of due diligence. And we figure out the play. And we put the priority back in marketing
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.520]  of who we are, they need us, we don't need them. They forget that we're the important cog in the
[29:24.520 --> 29:30.280]  fucking wheel. They aren't. Right. So we work that together and get authentic product and good
[29:30.280 --> 29:36.600]  products to a to the retail establishment, then there's a win for us. But that's a long haul.
[29:37.480 --> 29:45.880]  Yeah, I remember was a year before last, I think, MJ biz 2021. They had a panel. And the title of
[29:45.880 --> 29:50.840]  the panel was kind of insulting. But it was basically this was like, I think the head of
[29:50.840 --> 29:55.960]  Cresco was up there chick from a sim wellness was up there, this underground grower from New York
[29:55.960 --> 30:02.920]  and Swami were up there. And the head of Cresco was like, yeah, we're gonna start finding these
[30:02.920 --> 30:07.800]  legacy growers and underground growers and we're gonna help them get their licenses and we're going
[30:07.800 --> 30:12.360]  to give them a space in our cultivation operation and we're gonna let them run everything and then
[30:12.360 --> 30:17.080]  we're going to give them a special section and all of our dispensaries and all that. I've yet
[30:17.080 --> 30:23.160]  seen that. I haven't seen that come to pass yet. I'm just now seeing it. I am seeing are you
[30:24.760 --> 30:29.960]  moving but that's a long haul and it's it's very little right now. But as as our culture,
[30:29.960 --> 30:35.640]  we are growing. All right. And it's all based on reductionist math. Don't forget that these
[30:35.640 --> 30:40.200]  guys are still trying to reduce the value of everything we do just to hit the bottom line.
[30:40.200 --> 30:44.840]  Yeah, they want to reduce the cost of production, but they also want to reduce the value of our
[30:44.840 --> 30:49.960]  germ plasm and everything we do. We have to flip that. And I think going back to what you brought
[30:49.960 --> 30:56.280]  up the other day, Josh about these guys have spent we have a group out there that spent $337,000
[30:56.280 --> 31:02.840]  collectively in the last 12 months to lobby for things like limited licensure in new states. This
[31:02.840 --> 31:10.280]  is a group of very subversive and bad players. You know, at this point, I don't know how you
[31:10.280 --> 31:16.520]  combat something like that. We as a company, like I was the only one here that had was
[31:16.520 --> 31:21.720]  independently registered with the Government Ethics Committee in 2015 doing what you're talking about,
[31:21.720 --> 31:27.640]  Patrick, being in there with a lobbyist trying to influence things in a positive way, because in
[31:27.640 --> 31:32.600]  Oregon, all we had were these dirty packs, where you could pay like the grow pack, you could pay
[31:32.600 --> 31:37.720]  five grand and get in there. And then you'd have this tiny little squeaky voice that was really
[31:37.720 --> 31:42.760]  driven by the guy who had the most money. So we got in there early on, but I'm still a small
[31:42.760 --> 31:49.320]  company. I didn't make millions. So now the weight is bigger. I can't compete or you can't compete
[31:49.320 --> 31:55.720]  with $337,000 lobby effort. So you're right, we have to support the traditional markets.
[31:56.680 --> 32:03.080]  Yeah, you can, but it takes numbers. Okay, yeah, getting out of podium and talking and trying to
[32:03.080 --> 32:08.840]  get your two minutes to talk and show up with a fucking 300 motherfuckers outside the building
[32:08.840 --> 32:13.880]  when all the cameras and all the news crews are out there and make a difference and be fucking loud.
[32:14.840 --> 32:21.320]  Right? That's how you change, right? That's how we fail. Not having the support. I hear exactly
[32:21.320 --> 32:27.080]  what you're saying. You're pioneering, but nobody's supporting you at that level, right? You need us
[32:27.080 --> 32:33.480]  to be standing side by side with you. You need us to take your two minutes at that panel and throw
[32:33.480 --> 32:39.720]  it over a worldwide market, right? At the end of the day, what you're doing is more important,
[32:39.720 --> 32:44.120]  I think, man, supporting the traditional markets right now. They're not going to go away until
[32:44.120 --> 32:50.280]  these guys acknowledge quality and the value of quality that they've proven it. They've fueled
[32:50.280 --> 32:54.840]  the traditional markets. They're the place to be. The legacy market is the place to be. I saw
[32:54.840 --> 33:00.120]  someone in the comment profile, like legacy market is the community market. That's where we all go.
[33:00.120 --> 33:06.840]  In Oregon, we say there's dispensary urban, there's good urban. You know what I mean? So they've
[33:06.840 --> 33:11.160]  created that. And so what you're doing, I think, is one of the strongest things you can do.
[33:11.160 --> 33:15.480]  Support craft growers, support legacy growers, the same from our side, Thomas.
[33:16.120 --> 33:17.400]  Fight against Davinucy.
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.680]  We're about legacy craft breeding. We're not breeding 80 million seeds of something. We're
[33:24.680 --> 33:28.280]  trying to get something that's so quality, people are going to want to hunt it, go through it,
[33:28.840 --> 33:33.160]  and grow it again. Something so stable, they can put it in the field and count on the seeds.
[33:33.720 --> 33:36.280]  That's exactly it. Right there. Yes.
[33:37.240 --> 33:46.120]  I'd like to jump in and say I was pretty ignorant of hemp farmers. I suspected they could be on our
[33:46.120 --> 33:52.280]  side and that we were all brothers, but I didn't know any of them. And it really takes us talking
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.840]  and getting out there and talking with our competitors to realize that we are all on the
[33:58.840 --> 34:05.640]  same page and we all are working with the same plant. It's the same plant where it just has more
[34:05.640 --> 34:13.480]  THC or less THC. It's not really a big of a difference. And to be able to be out in the open
[34:13.480 --> 34:20.280]  and advocate for ourselves because a lot of us did a lot of work and kept it as undercover as
[34:20.280 --> 34:25.160]  possible. And that was the whole deal was to not be noticed and to not let people know what you're
[34:25.160 --> 34:29.720]  doing. And then at a certain point, it's like you need to then say, hey, I've been doing this forever.
[34:29.720 --> 34:35.560]  I've been doing this for 20 years, but I've been pretending like I haven't been doing this for 20
[34:35.560 --> 34:44.440]  years. And it's kind of this back and forth where you have to prove that you belong in a certain
[34:44.440 --> 34:50.520]  space, but at the same time for years pretending that that wasn't where you were. Because for me
[34:50.520 --> 34:59.960]  as a Black man, my parents were like, hey, stay out of jail. And that was a huge impact on my
[34:59.960 --> 35:06.440]  cannabis career was, OK, well, first off, I want to stay out of jail. Second off, I want to be in
[35:06.440 --> 35:12.760]  this industry, but I can't do some of the things that other people could do because I had to be
[35:12.760 --> 35:19.560]  cognizant of those things. And that's just part of it. And Jeremy, you reaching out to me,
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.240]  it basically opened up my whole world to like, oh, shit, there's these other hemp breeders that
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.520]  they're breeding Acumen is sharper than the high THC breeders.
[35:31.560 --> 35:39.480]  You know, like, and, you know, like THC breeders, that's the irony. And, yeah, we all started.
[35:40.040 --> 35:45.960]  Yeah. And if you ask me if we're breeding hemp, I'd say no. I'd say industrial hemp is something
[35:46.520 --> 35:53.080]  for fuel, for fiber. You know, we're breeding cannabinoid rich, non intoxicating terpene,
[35:53.080 --> 35:59.640]  richest cannabis. That's what it is. And look, I'll be straight with you guys. A lot of why
[35:59.640 --> 36:04.760]  I leaned into type three is here I am doing policy work or into hemp. And I see,
[36:04.760 --> 36:09.640]  oh, my God, metric is coming online for these guys. I don't know. How am I going to breed
[36:09.640 --> 36:15.720]  in metric? That's scary. Like when they're figuring this out. Secondly, I see 280 E taxation coming
[36:15.720 --> 36:21.720]  online and I'm like, how is anyone going to make a living? And, you know, I'm a little guy like so
[36:21.720 --> 36:28.680]  there's a lot of drivers as to why I went to type three that really just have to do with, you know,
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.000]  not so much a support of hemp, but really a support of the plant and looking for a pathway
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.760]  to stay relevant and stay here. Damn it. Just this is all I know how to do. I don't know how
[36:38.760 --> 36:44.760]  to do anything else real well. We need you here, Jeremy. We need you. You're an advocate in the
[36:44.760 --> 36:49.560]  voice and you're super important to our industry. You really are. I mean, we've got man, I've known
[36:49.560 --> 36:55.880]  you for a long time. And, you know, spot in on you on a few talk shows and things that even I think
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.680]  it was MJB was one of them. Remember that a long time ago? Yeah, that was a good one. But anyways,
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.480]  the guy that's in the forefront is the most important person in our industry. And that's
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.480]  what I'm talking about. Identifying and acknowledging and respecting those who paved the road for us.
[37:12.040 --> 37:18.360]  Right. And guys like Jeremy are the same thing. The policy is the most super important thing we have.
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.400]  And that's what put put the Emerald Triangle and craft farmers and legacy farmers out of business
[37:23.400 --> 37:28.040]  because we didn't support the Jeremy's out there. I mean, that's that's the fact. And to go on the
[37:28.040 --> 37:35.080]  THC, THC percentages, they mean absolutely shit to me. Yeah, absolutely. Shit to me. I can produce
[37:35.080 --> 37:41.880]  some badass fucking terpenes. I'll throw you in the couch on a 20 percent THC. Right. So how do
[37:41.880 --> 37:47.320]  we get from corporate cannabis back over to, you know, why is the corporate mid so important?
[37:47.320 --> 37:53.720]  Because those guys are only growing THC. I can't do that. Midgrade higher THC weed. You know,
[37:53.720 --> 37:59.000]  I own I'm an owner in Rosin Tech Lab. We want an Emerald Cup first, fifth and sixth last year.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  I've been pumping solventless. I have two manufacturing facilities in California,
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.280]  Northern and Southern, been pumping and screaming, rising and turfing since everybody told me I was
[38:08.280 --> 38:13.720]  stupid because I put my all my energy into this. But I can tell you right now I know a fucking
[38:13.720 --> 38:21.480]  thing about it. And we are we cannot win these cups unless we are growing the baddest terpene
[38:21.480 --> 38:27.800]  profiles. Right. And we are producing that quality of a flower that's clean and really
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.320]  it doesn't have a bunch of bullshit sprayed all over it. And these these monocropping and these
[38:33.320 --> 38:39.720]  big indoors and there's there's there's regenerative living soil that's coming out of
[38:39.720 --> 38:45.080]  indoor that's growing terpenes that's fucking blowing me away right now. And the indoor right.
[38:45.080 --> 38:51.080]  So the thing that's coming out is crazy. So fuck the THC. It means absolutely nothing compared to
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.600]  compounds and terpenes. And just to add one more thing on that, I had an argument at my facility
[38:56.600 --> 39:02.440]  a few years ago with all my employees. So I got them 99 percent distillate and then I got a pure
[39:02.440 --> 39:09.000]  terpenes and we dabbed it and they were super afraid of the of the distillate. Super for that.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.040]  We're just going to fuck us up. And I'm like, OK, so I let them do that first. Right. And they're
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.560]  like, damn, this is pretty good. It tastes like shit. Oh, just like, oh, yeah, I got high off it.
[39:19.560 --> 39:25.960]  I'm OK. But wait a few minutes. Right. Wait about 30 minutes. And then I had I hadn't had the fucking
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.600]  terpenes, straight terpenes, cannabis, terpenes, not that fake shit everybody's using cannabis
[39:30.600 --> 39:36.040]  terpenes. And and these guys were fucking eyes were going back and forth and writing that you
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.280]  for feeling that happened for about 10 minutes that they had to sit down and grab the desk.
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.880]  And that's the power of terpenes. So fuck the THC percentages means absolutely nothing.
[39:46.440 --> 39:54.440]  The problem with THC is it's sold as the thing to the community and the consumers. And that is the
[39:54.440 --> 40:02.440]  driving force that allows corporate shitty weed to prevail over legacy quality. That's it. So we
[40:02.440 --> 40:10.120]  need to change that game. Right. And we are doing it. We're changing it. Yeah, the consumer side
[40:10.120 --> 40:15.720]  definitely needs to be educated when it comes to kind of endocannabinoid system, the effect
[40:15.720 --> 40:21.560]  and the and the role of terpenes. I was working with a company called Ohio Energetics. Will
[40:21.560 --> 40:30.360]  Clyden out of out of Ohio, California, brilliant guy, really ahead of his time. And he and I,
[40:31.080 --> 40:37.240]  he had me do this thing with CBD where I took a CBD tincture. He has a CBD tincture that it's
[40:37.240 --> 40:42.760]  kind of bitter when you first take it and you continue taking it until it starts to taste sweet.
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.040]  And that's an indicator of when you're kind of endocannabinoid system has reached an equilibrium
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.360]  and it's kind of like full, right? Like you got an empty tank or a full tank. Well, once you kind
[40:52.360 --> 40:59.640]  of get on a full tank, then you can take individual terpenoids and like limonene, for instance,
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.400]  and you put it on a little bit of black pepper and like say a ramekin, you put some black pepper
[41:03.400 --> 41:10.440]  in there and you drop that terpene in there and you smell the terpene. And instantly it's like,
[41:10.440 --> 41:15.400]  like the limonene was like a shot of cocaine. It was just like, boom, eyes open wide,
[41:16.040 --> 41:22.760]  just full of energy, like almost jittery energy. And then you grab something like, like Linalool,
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.640]  do that. And then you just like feel your body melting like that. And so those terpenes have
[41:27.640 --> 41:35.480]  such a huge, huge, huge impact on the overall effect and the therapeutic medicinal component.
[41:35.480 --> 41:43.400]  What Jeremy's talking about is breeding these compound rich varieties. It's really crucial for
[41:43.400 --> 41:49.960]  us to have those available to people, especially if we can do it in a CBD form where it's 50 state
[41:49.960 --> 41:56.920]  legal, then people can start to really experience what the cannabis plant is truly all about. And
[41:56.920 --> 42:03.880]  not just this one compound that's being used and being marketed. You know, like I've smoked tons
[42:03.880 --> 42:13.240]  of sun grown flower that's 21% or 18% that blows the doors off of some of these 32% indoors with
[42:14.040 --> 42:18.120]  one and a half percent terps. Like it's just- Every one of us come from that world. Every
[42:18.120 --> 42:24.280]  one of us come from a world before HPLC and GCMS looks, huh? We all were going by different
[42:25.320 --> 42:29.480]  effects. And yeah, when we started to see what our genetics that we really love we're doing,
[42:29.480 --> 42:34.360]  we weren't finding 28%. They're in there in the mix, but we're finding the stuff we love is lower
[42:34.360 --> 42:40.760]  and higher terpenes. Yes. Josh, you're talking really good information that needs to get out
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.960]  there. Those are the discussion platforms that are super important. We got just like with the
[42:45.960 --> 42:51.080]  ganja, right? So we give away and we teach terpenes. These are all cannabis terpenes,
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.400]  limonene. And so you could take all these different, wherever they are, all these different
[42:55.400 --> 42:59.000]  terpenes, there's liquid terpene in here. I don't open it up and smell it because it'll fucking,
[42:59.560 --> 43:07.560]  it's so potent, right? But I do different terpene patterns. And so I do different,
[43:08.520 --> 43:15.640]  what do you call it? I forget what you call it when you get a platform. We go in and we make a
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.800]  chocolate. How do you make chocolate? How do you make that chocolate flavor? How do you make this
[43:19.800 --> 43:25.560]  flavor? So it's these combinations of different terpenes of what happens and how it occurs. And
[43:25.560 --> 43:31.000]  that is the most important thing because when we start, you breeders start growing this and
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.320]  started learning a lot about the terpenes. Now you can identify plants and go in a certain
[43:37.320 --> 43:43.720]  direction for elements in medical, right? You can go different sleeping. You can start dividing
[43:43.720 --> 43:49.800]  this stuff up or if you want certain flavor profiles, you have all the different layers
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.880]  of terpene and you put all those terpenes together and you make, there's a million different
[43:55.880 --> 44:02.520]  varieties you can make out of this box. It's insane. It's crazy. So yeah, this is an important
[44:02.600 --> 44:05.960]  subject to talk about. And this is the future of cannabis right here.
[44:05.960 --> 44:12.760]  It is. One thing that the type three plants or CBDs led us to be able to do is work with all
[44:12.760 --> 44:19.320]  these universities in a really unique way. And in the last couple of years, we had 153 compound
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.760]  look on four of our genetics done in Israel, right? And I had never seen anything that deep,
[44:24.760 --> 44:29.240]  right? And I think Josh has even seen these analytics or we've certainly talked about them,
[44:29.880 --> 44:36.760]  but they showed that the type three plants we have, have over 40 quantifiable terpenes,
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.320]  model and cesspa terpenes and over 40 quantifiable cannabinoids, right?
[44:41.320 --> 44:46.520]  So when we start looking that deep, like we're going to find a lot of really interesting stuff
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.240]  in the cannabis that, you know, guys like Thomas and Josh are breeding and all the guys out of the
[44:51.240 --> 44:57.320]  EC or the ET animal triangle. You know, another thing that I'd say that's happening with terpenes
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.200]  that you guys should be aware of is, and I know Josh is, I believe Thomas is as well as,
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.200]  you know, for the last couple of years now, we have companies that are coming online and growing
[45:07.080 --> 45:11.800]  large volumes, lots of acres of our type three plants just for terpene extraction.
[45:12.840 --> 45:17.240]  You know, there are several out there and one in particular, I think is growing over 200 acres
[45:17.800 --> 45:21.880]  in central California this year, just for terpene extraction. And it starts out with,
[45:22.520 --> 45:28.120]  you know, the fractions that, I mean, it starts out with the complexes, right? Like you have
[45:28.120 --> 45:34.120]  everything put together and they're just pulling a full cannabis profile. But what Josh is talking
[45:34.120 --> 45:38.040]  about, what you're talking about with that box is what's really exciting to me. When we get to
[45:38.040 --> 45:44.760]  being able to fraction them out at an acre scale, they already have a value. We may be able to,
[45:44.760 --> 45:49.240]  you know, help some of these farmers just on an acre or two acres, guys that know how to grow
[45:49.240 --> 45:55.320]  cannabis, terpene rich cannabis, really sustain themselves once that process gets going. Because
[45:55.320 --> 46:00.920]  I can tell you, go online and look at like a company called Sigma Aldrich sometime. Anybody
[46:00.920 --> 46:07.960]  who's listening? That's a compound company. Yeah. Yeah. They have catalogs. They have like
[46:08.520 --> 46:14.040]  1200, 1500 page catalogs. So I was in college, I studied biology and chemistry and like
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.640]  Sigma Aldrich catalogs are scattered about the labs and everything. And they're great reference
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.440]  books for you guys to have too. If you'll contact Sigma Aldrich, they'll send you a free catalog
[46:24.440 --> 46:28.760]  and they're fantastic books to have as a reference for chemicals because they have
[46:28.760 --> 46:36.760]  boiling points, melting points, evaporative points, all the chemical profiles of all these chemicals,
[46:36.760 --> 46:42.200]  like Jeremy's saying, are available in that book. And they have the cost, the value. So you can see,
[46:42.200 --> 46:47.560]  oh, 25 milligrams of that terpene extracted by itself is worth that. And I can tell you,
[46:47.560 --> 46:51.480]  if you start looking at the math there and you start talking about us growing plants that are
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.520]  three or four or 5% terpenes by weight, total weight, which is what Thomas is doing.
[46:56.520 --> 46:59.080]  We've seen it too. Yeah. It's fucking awesome.
[46:59.080 --> 47:03.720]  It could get really crazy. So I want everybody to know that like just on the terpene end,
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.600]  man, this shit's getting very legit. And there are a lot of ways to skin this cat,
[47:08.600 --> 47:11.400]  man. This plant's going to keep rewarding us if we pay attention.
[47:12.360 --> 47:18.200]  It's super important to talk that, you know, it's like you're decarbonizing at different
[47:18.200 --> 47:22.920]  temperatures. You'll get different profiles, right? So everybody asks me, why am I,
[47:22.920 --> 47:27.800]  why do I smoke doobies? Like I'm a doobie guy. The lungs are shot. Why do I smoke doobies? I
[47:27.800 --> 47:34.280]  don't like pipes. I can't stand bongs. You know, I've had that ear in my life. I don't do a lot of
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.960]  dabbing. I'll do a small amounts of rosin, right? I've got rosin bait pins we make as well as
[47:39.960 --> 47:45.800]  Robin dabbed, but I'm a doobie guy. And the reason why I like doobies is because when you're smoking
[47:45.800 --> 47:51.480]  a joint and you have a cherry at the end, that cherries at a certain temperature burning, right?
[47:51.480 --> 47:57.560]  And so when you're dragging that weed, you're dragging, doing that pull, that heat is now
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.280]  changing and going lower, lower, lower, all the way down to the roaches. You're inhaling it. So
[48:02.280 --> 48:07.240]  those terpenes along that aren't on the cherry are decarbing at different levels. So it's giving
[48:07.240 --> 48:13.800]  you a different euphoric feeling. And so that's why good weed high terpenes gets you so fucking
[48:13.800 --> 48:18.040]  higher out of a doobie than it ever does. When you're putting a flame on a bong or playing on
[48:18.040 --> 48:24.920]  a pipe, you're converting and decarbing those terpenes at one heat element. Bam, right? You're,
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.440]  you're heating it up or you're firing it and you're not getting that entourage
[48:29.240 --> 48:35.320]  feeling and effect, right? So for me, it's like, and I can, if you ever see me smoking the second
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.600]  half of a doobie, you know, that's good weed because once again, another thing, if it's not
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.840]  clean or if it's just doesn't have that, or it's clogging up, it'll get down to the first half of
[48:44.840 --> 48:50.680]  that joint. And I like to enjoy it. And when I can't fucking enjoy it, I'm not smoking it. Right?
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.800]  So I'd rather light up a new one than fucking smoke the second half most of the time until
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.680]  I hit that one off. And then I, and then there's those cultivators that grow just,
[49:00.680 --> 49:06.840]  they're just growing like there's a forbidden fruit that I fucking love only grown by one
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.960]  cultivator, right? The rest of it gets me this weird feeling and high and not really too high,
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.920]  you know, because it's always lower THC levels and it doesn't really get me, but the terpene
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.720]  compound, the different terpenes and how they're cultivated and how they're grown means a lot. So
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.280]  there's one cultivator that I smoked that whole fucking joint down and I'm on the phone with him
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.280]  making sure every time, cause I'm in Arizona right now, every time I show up in Cali, I got a bag of
[49:30.280 --> 49:36.520]  weed sitting there for him. I mean, so that's kind of how, how, how quality to me exists. It's the
[49:36.520 --> 49:42.920]  whole, it starts from the fucking growing soil and the soil produces the quality plant. And at the
[49:42.920 --> 49:49.800]  end of the day, I'm smoking it down to the roach. Bam. I would completely, completely agree. I mean,
[49:49.800 --> 49:55.000]  that's my opinion. How you can tell good weed is something that's that tastes good all the way to
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.600]  the end that you want to finish it. You know, that, that it burns well enough that you can smoke
[50:00.600 --> 50:04.520]  it all the way. And that it does. That's the difference between a good grower and a bad
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.240]  grower for sure. Right there, man. Absolutely. That's your corporate monocropping versus your
[50:09.240 --> 50:15.000]  legacy people. Hey, speaking of corporate monocropping, I see dirty the grower over here
[50:15.000 --> 50:22.200]  talking about Oregon CBD and their tripoids. And I would just say that, man, that's, that's a really
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.560]  good point to bring up that you're talking to three breeders on here who have been crucified
[50:27.560 --> 50:33.880]  by those guys over and over again, because we produce high quality, novel, unique genetics
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.560]  that actually are like patentable. We don't have to sterilize them and create tripoids out of them
[50:39.560 --> 50:46.040]  to stop people from reproducing them. We, we want the industry to have diversity. So
[50:46.040 --> 50:50.440]  you should definitely look at these three companies that are on here, Davis Farms, Yellowhammer,
[50:53.960 --> 50:58.920]  send me a note, man. Send me a note. You can go on Instagram, the soil king on Instagram.
[50:58.920 --> 51:04.440]  Send me a note. Like let's, let's collab and figure it out and talk and support each other
[51:04.440 --> 51:09.720]  on any level. Absolutely. Absolutely, man. But you got, this is a grassroots podcast or a
[51:09.720 --> 51:15.880]  grassroots event. I love everybody that shows up on this. I'm honored to be here. And yeah,
[51:15.880 --> 51:21.880]  I want to say that what we talk about is not corporatization of, of cannabis. We talk about
[51:21.880 --> 51:27.320]  preserving diversity. I think Jamal, you probably just received the seeds that we talked about from
[51:27.320 --> 51:33.560]  the last podcast, but we, we send out breeders packs of four, anybody that wanted them from the
[51:33.560 --> 51:37.400]  event and I'll announce it again. I think Josh wants to do the same thing that we send out
[51:37.400 --> 51:44.360]  breeders packs to anybody that asked for them of preservation that we work, that we did on Acapulco
[51:44.360 --> 51:53.160]  gold, 1975, a Tora Bora from Afghanistan. I think it was a Highland tie and then a Bel-Dia from,
[51:53.160 --> 52:00.200]  from Katama that kind of predates a lot of the Afghani influence. Again, we're about preservation.
[52:00.200 --> 52:06.520]  We're about community, you know, so not, not about sterilization, this industry in any way.
[52:06.520 --> 52:09.640]  And I think our genetics stand up and toe the line next to those guys.
[52:09.640 --> 52:15.880]  Yeah. I remember when, when I had all my genetics in phylos back in the day when they raped and
[52:15.880 --> 52:23.400]  pillaged, right? Oh my God, man. I have, I've got, finally got my names out of there, but they
[52:23.480 --> 52:30.600]  still have a number. All my, all my cultivars are a number in there now. Oh, I, I, yeah. I mean,
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.360]  I, yeah, they're still around. The phylos is still around. They're, they're, uh,
[52:35.480 --> 52:41.640]  I got hit up by their CEO. Um, well, I was, I was working for a big company and I saw and,
[52:41.640 --> 52:46.600]  and was head of their cultivation group. They, they're doing feminized seed. Uh,
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.600]  they're trying to convince every, all the, all the girls to get rid of moms, get rid of clones,
[52:50.600 --> 52:55.560]  just run them and I see, you know, they, they claim they've got a feminine seed line that has
[52:55.560 --> 53:01.160]  almost no variation in phenotypic expression. And, but the CLAs are low. They're like, you know,
[53:01.960 --> 53:10.200]  20% terpenes are one, 1.25, 2%. So it's interesting how they kind of pivoted. But
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.840]  I go back to that, uh, dirty to go. You're saying that, uh, about some of the best CBD genetics,
[53:17.640 --> 53:24.520]  I, I, I encourage you to go look at what, um, what we're doing, what Thomas is doing, Jeremy,
[53:24.520 --> 53:32.120]  myself, um, go, go and check out some of the work that we've done. I've, you know, had to compete
[53:32.120 --> 53:38.200]  direct head to head with, with Oregon CBD. Um, like we're getting ready to release a varian line,
[53:38.200 --> 53:44.760]  um, here very soon. And, and I saw Oregon CBD released a varian line and I think it was like
[53:44.760 --> 53:53.720]  five, 6% THC V or we're fixing to drop a line. That's like 10 to 15% THC V and ours can be gone.
[53:53.720 --> 54:00.360]  Ours can be gone under industrial hemp because it tests below 0.3 total THC. And so I just kind
[54:00.360 --> 54:03.720]  of reached out to them and said something like, Hey, you know, uh, cool. You guys are doing that.
[54:03.720 --> 54:08.360]  Hey, check out this, this is the CLA. This is what we're doing. And like, man, they were not happy
[54:08.360 --> 54:13.720]  about it. And then there's a bunch of us like Floyd's not on here, but Floyd's doing a lot of
[54:13.720 --> 54:21.080]  Baron work. Um, clay, um, uh, out in Oregon and Clement falls. He's doing a lot of Baron work.
[54:21.080 --> 54:26.680]  Thomas, I think you've been doing some stuff with variance. Um, yeah, CBTB auto flowers, but uh,
[54:26.680 --> 54:30.040]  yeah, there's still a little bit land race right now. You know what I mean? But yeah,
[54:30.040 --> 54:34.840]  my buddy's got Eric hemp seed. He's working on a THC V line as well. Uh, he doesn't have a really
[54:34.840 --> 54:39.960]  big facility, so it's not going very fast, but the same as you're talking, it's compliant, total THC,
[54:40.600 --> 54:44.760]  uh, you know, high in THC V. So we'll see what comes out of it. But yeah,
[54:44.760 --> 54:49.080]  I would love to check out your THC V as well. Run them in my facility.
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.280]  Yeah. I got some seeds. I'm going to send you anyways. I'll send you a pack of those as well.
[54:54.280 --> 55:00.040]  Oh yeah. Arizona there. You know, I, there's a lot of hemp farmers coming online that been here
[55:00.040 --> 55:04.920]  and they failed because of the summer heat. So there have been reaching out to me for autos
[55:04.920 --> 55:10.200]  hemp autos. Right. And so it makes sense out here because they can't get through the summer
[55:10.200 --> 55:13.240]  without destroying a plant, especially if you're going to grow up for flower.
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.000]  Yeah. So there's a lot of, a lot of different stuff. So if anybody out there has a good little
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.240]  stable line, I don't want to get behind something that goes wrong. I got some purple autos. You
[55:23.240 --> 55:27.880]  should definitely check out. I'll send you some Patrick, but uh, I got, uh, the purple autos are
[55:27.880 --> 55:33.000]  producing around 4% terpenes, but, uh, I made this new line. It's a blood orange diesel line,
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.120]  but just like straight tangerines with a little terpinaline. Yeah.
[55:39.800 --> 55:42.600]  How do we get, how do we collab? How do I get your information?
[55:42.600 --> 55:45.080]  Yeah. I'll send you a message on Instagram if you want.
[55:47.720 --> 55:51.960]  Oh yeah. Yeah. And then there's early season varieties, F1 hybrids. What, uh, you know,
[55:52.920 --> 55:57.640]  I don't know if fast buds did this. I'm guessing, but, uh, what Oregon CBD does and what I do,
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.840]  we take auto flowers and cross them into a photo periodic line and it makes an F1 hybrid. So they'll
[56:02.840 --> 56:08.040]  harvest three to four weeks earlier than your regular season. So that's what, uh, you know,
[56:11.800 --> 56:14.760]  what's that? I can link you up with a couple of farmers out here for sure.
[56:15.880 --> 56:21.720]  I'm supporting on the back end and helping him. He's he's high up. I'm sorry, Patrick. He's high
[56:21.720 --> 56:29.480]  Alpine genetics with a Z. Yeah. Yeah. And he's high Alpine genetics, dub, dub, dub, dub high
[56:29.560 --> 56:36.440]  Alpine genetics.com on, on, uh, his website as well. So he's easy to find. Yep.
[56:37.800 --> 56:44.440]  I want to, I want to jump in just, um, sorry. I just want to jump into kind of moving a certain
[56:44.440 --> 56:55.240]  direction. Um, um, if that's okay with you guys, we get stuck on a subject for hours. If we let us,
[56:55.720 --> 57:03.720]  my wife was like, don't let them take over the podcast. Um, well, I mean, my question was
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.800]  current breeding projects. I mean, I hear you guys kind of, you know, touching on it, but I'm,
[57:07.800 --> 57:11.960]  I'm very curious, you know, what are you guys, what are your current breeding projects?
[57:11.960 --> 57:19.480]  What are you excited about? Oh man, I've got, um, we always have tons of stuff going on,
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.480]  but we we've retired some of our old stuff, like our blueberry, OG, um, lime we've retired. Uh,
[57:25.480 --> 57:33.400]  we just dropped the big sexy work, which is with, um, uh, the 95 AK 47, uh, cut. It's,
[57:33.400 --> 57:39.320]  it's an incredible plant. Uh, it breeds really true. Simon did a great job at serious when he,
[57:39.320 --> 57:45.400]  when he did the AK 47 work and bringing those land races together into a stable form. Um, I mean,
[57:45.400 --> 57:50.680]  he was really doing some phenomenal, like true genetics, Mendelian genetics work when he was
[57:50.680 --> 57:55.240]  creating all of that. And so we've got that, but we're really focusing on type two stuff right now.
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.600]  And we've got a bunch of new type three CBD stuff that we're going to be, um, releasing next year
[58:00.600 --> 58:06.040]  for 2024 that we're really excited about, uh, based off our strawberry orange trifle and, and
[58:06.040 --> 58:13.240]  Oompa Loompa. And then we, uh, have a whole catalog that we're developing of type two stuff.
[58:13.240 --> 58:21.160]  Um, I dropped, um, four cultivars in the Massachusetts market, um, this past year,
[58:21.160 --> 58:29.560]  uh, 2022 that were type ones, our hell on wheels, um, and a few others. And the market response to
[58:29.560 --> 58:34.200]  them has been overwhelming. The company that's growing the flower can barely keep up with the
[58:34.200 --> 58:41.720]  production, um, type twos, you know, ratioed flower, one-to-one, uh, two-to-ones THC CBD.
[58:42.280 --> 58:46.520]  And there's usually a lot of other minor cannabinoids in that, but we're producing
[58:46.520 --> 58:55.320]  type twos that are got the bag of pill. There are three, five, 6% terpenes with total cannabinoids
[58:55.320 --> 58:59.560]  in the mid thirties. Um, so that's, that's a lot of what we're working on right now.
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.920]  Awesome. That's good. Yeah. I'm just going for the type twos as well. Just trying to collaborate
[59:04.920 --> 59:09.720]  with a lot of people. So, uh, bakery genetics, I've been trying to, uh, collaborate with him.
[59:09.720 --> 59:15.160]  He just sent me back some crosses of some CBD into THC and then, uh, also working with, uh,
[59:15.160 --> 59:21.880]  med trees, send me some back. And then, um, also the beliefer, he's another flower seller online,
[59:21.880 --> 59:26.440]  but, uh, you know, he's really excited with this type two breeding. So he's pushing me forward
[59:26.440 --> 59:30.680]  a lot with that, but, uh, just a lot of type two genetics and just trying to pull everything back
[59:30.680 --> 59:35.080]  in. So I just popped some, uh, meat breath yesterday. I popped some of the, uh, the
[59:35.080 --> 59:39.800]  Downey's bird cross with motor breath and Donnie's burgers back cross GMO. So what does that triple
[59:39.800 --> 59:45.400]  burger or something? But, uh, yeah, just, uh, yeah, trying to, trying to bring back in mostly
[59:45.400 --> 59:53.080]  terpenes and, uh, smokable, um, qualities into hemp, I guess. So it's going well so far. I mean,
[59:53.720 --> 59:59.080]  the response is unbelievable. I can't keep up with even trimming, but especially type twos,
[59:59.080 --> 01:00:03.960]  people are hitting me up for type twos all the time and type threes. Um, but, uh, so yeah,
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.920]  I think that's the problem with, uh, with the hemp industry is we have like, you know, there's four
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.480]  people to go to. People always ask me, you know, I sell a lot in Italy. I don't know why Italy and
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.880]  then France and like, who else, who else can we go to? And I'm like, well, we got, you know,
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.520]  just a few breeders to recommend and that's it. And everyone just dropped off probably because,
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:28.120]  you know, um, no one's really concentrated on breeding and, you know, just to, just to make it,
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.680]  I have to do flower as well, you know? So it's been hard on my company as well. You know, every
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.360]  year we like make money and then by, by springtime I'm, you know, out of money. So, you know, it's
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:46.040]  like, uh, it's a vicious cycle. Um, so like, as far as, as far as the type twos that you're
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:51.880]  breeding, are those, are there specific THC thresholds for those as well?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.200]  Oh no, no. So type two generally the way I see it, uh, I'm, I'm sure other people see it
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:05.320]  differently, but CBD and THC are essentially two different, uh, genetics. So just like auto flowers
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.840]  in a regular photo periodic variety, those are two different genetics. So you make an F1 hybrid,
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:17.320]  or, you know, so you got an F1 THC CBD, you know, some people find more CBD, some people find THC,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:23.160]  but you do still have that genetic in the line. So you can either make an F2 generation. And then
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.440]  what I've been finding is with the Punnett square, you'll see one in four, but I've seen like one in
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:35.720]  eight is a, is a CBD variety. But, uh, you know, I'm mostly just trying to pull out hemp varieties,
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:42.600]  you know, for the hemp industry, you know, below 0.3% THC. So, uh, you know, I don't really,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.360]  I have a few one-to-ones out there, but it's kind of like, you know, I did the work for the one-to-ones
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.640]  now I'm going to do it for this CBD and then re-release it. So, um, I haven't been focused
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.760]  on releasing one-to-ones because I can't make, legally, I can't make that much seed,
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.080]  you know what I mean? Uh, for people to have. So it's just, that's almost like an underground
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.720]  market that I would have to hit, you know, uh, to stay, I have to stay above board, but, uh,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:15.960]  Yeah, from a regulatory standpoint, as far as the hemp bill is concerned, uh, type twos are,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:22.600]  are not going, you can't grow type twos in a field for as under the hemp bill. Um, now
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.640]  yeah, anything over 0.3% total. And that's something else I'm seeing. And like, there's
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.120]  this movement right now with some guys that are saying, well, technically the farm bill says
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:47.080]  this total THC, but the DEA's definition of hemp is 0.3 Delta nine. So if we can find a 25% THC
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:55.080]  A with under 0.3% Delta nine, then we can technically sell this online as hemp. And so
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:02.760]  they're redefining it. They're calling it THC A flower. And this is a terrible idea.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.520]  This is a terrible idea. This is going to draw a, they're, they're selling THC flower. That's 25,
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:17.320]  30% flower online as hemp. And they're going to step on the toes of the wrong people, the DEA,
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:22.280]  and it's going to draw a ton of scrutiny out onto our industry that we don't need.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:30.200]  Um, and it's kind of like the Delta eight and the, uh, HHC and the THC P and all that, you know,
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.080]  they're, they're kind of following that same pattern where they're trying to skirt the rules
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.920]  and, and take advantage of a, of a definitional loophole of, well, it says 0.3, you know,
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.720]  Delta nine, like, well, the farm bill says 0.3 total after decarboxylation. And so if they,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.160]  there's a conflict with the federal government and I think they'll close that loophole soon,
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.680]  which is going to put a lot of people in, in a situation where they're, um,
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.520]  they're going to be out of compliance. It draws a lot of attention to the legacy market.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  Yeah. I want to add one thing at this leg, this legends of legacy marketplace that's monthly.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.200]  We breeders are welcome. Like we have a lot of breeders, like it's, it's a seed swap as well.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:20.120]  So we have, um, 150 bucks a table and you can have a six foot table outside of a 21 and over,
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.680]  you know, illegal cannabis purchasing side. So you can sell genetics at this monthly.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:32.520]  And the best part about it is, you know, we're looking for legacy people to be there and promote,
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:39.160]  but also the marketing you're going to get from all of the soil king empire and associated content
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.960]  providers is massive. Right. And so that's what the thing, that's what this whole thing is about
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.480]  is just to raise, uh, you know, raise information on who the, who's who, and the people that are
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.440]  left behind. And again, promote those that are pioneering our industry and leading the,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.680]  leading the race. So that's, if anybody wants any information or to come down or whatever,
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:08.200]  in this email, my team at info at the soil king.com info at the soil king.com come down with,
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.360]  you know, come down, hang out there, motel rooms in town. We have, like I said,
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.920]  the pre-party and the night before is going to be a bachelor. We're just hanging out. We got a
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:22.520]  dad bar. We've got legacy, uh, laws and producers with that, you know, just fun time. We got,
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:29.080]  we got vegan food and then we have a wild wild pork stew. Cause we're going to just get the
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:37.400]  shit and get moment. Right. Yeah, for sure. I'll be there. I'll have a booth. Yeah. Yeah,
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:43.400]  definitely come though. It should be a great time. Had a buddy who came to like the one last week,
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.920]  believe it was last week, a month ago, about a month ago, Jerry, we did said Jerry C seed swap
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.320]  out there. And so that was a great one because we had all these breeders that came out and you see
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:58.520]  these seed swaps going up everywhere and they're all important, but you know, again, I go, I have
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.880]  to go back to, let's just, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to say this because I get hate, but
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:12.280]  let's just think which, uh, you know, who the legacy are as well and honor them. Right. So if
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:17.480]  you're, I know my genetics, I've been working on him for years. I don't call myself a breeder,
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:23.800]  but I've been my entire life for about five years, just in, I was popping 1100 fucking seeds of the
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.600]  same strain. I had fucking massive greenhouse. I'm growing them under the sun and into teenagers.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.000]  And I'm doing my selection, jacking them off, all that, you know, all that stuff that goes
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.800]  into stabilizing your back crossing and getting the right structure on a male. But anyways,
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:44.040]  I never called myself a breeder. I have my own genetic line. I, I'm not that because I haven't
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:50.120]  given my life to that part of it. Right. So I follow those. And plus I had some really good
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:55.640]  land rates, you know, they're not, uh, my cultivars aren't like crossed over, you know,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.960]  a hundred times. They're not a Skittles or not all this, right. They got just a few different
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:06.520]  points on it, you know, one or two to four, but still I honor those who, who I got the seeds from.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:12.600]  It's very important to keep that, that heritage in the genetics, where you got them from. And
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.160]  if you're a breeder, find out who that is, find out really where, where those came from
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.480]  and honor those people because they laid the path for where you're at today. And this is important
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.040]  topic that nobody wants to talk about. And I'll probably get a lot of hate on here for that, but
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.680]  you know, I stand up for this industry, the best of my ability and pioneering ain't fucking easy.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:35.240]  And sometimes you're hated and then you're loved out the gate right at the end of it. So I am who
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:41.480]  I am. It's what I am. Not perfect, Pat. No, I haven't.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.720]  No, for sure. I mean, we appreciate you. We appreciate you in the space and speaking your
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:58.840]  mind, you know, I mean, you know, that's, that's, that's what we got to do. Would Jeremy or Josh
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.680]  like to talk about any breeding projects that you guys have going on? I'd take a stab at that for
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:12.120]  sure. Just say that, you know, number one, we, I came from doing type twos, you know, back in the
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:18.120]  Oregon medical days. So we were primary producer in Oregon at one to ones, two to ones, 10 to ones
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:23.560]  and 20 to one. So it's easy for us to move back in that direction. We have a lot of genetic material
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.840]  and that's the exciting place. That's a lot of why I think I was interested in sitting here with
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.480]  Josh and Thomas is that that's where we're focused on. We're focused on high efficacy plants,
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.480]  plants that have a really big impact and I'll have a wide reach. And so I'm excited to say that
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:45.320]  we're going to be leaning back into type two. But I think probably the most exciting thing to maybe
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:51.640]  the FCP viewers that we're working on right now is that, and this is what's neat about hemp for us
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.960]  too, about type three is it's given us a more global reach. It's given us an understanding of
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.280]  things like legal seed labels and USDA APHIS and how to move seeds around the world the way that
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.480]  we're supposed to. And one of those relationships that's been really fun for us is we, there are a
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.960]  few groups in Malawi right now that are doing type three. And so we've engaged with a couple
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.720]  of those. And one in particular has a young gentleman who is a Spanish gentleman. And he is,
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:26.280]  he took a year off from this breeding program that he's doing in Malawi and went on like a
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.880]  sabbatical and it's just like a can of sabbatical, if you will. And he went around to try and find
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:39.400]  and distinguish anything that was verifiable and undiluted in Malawi, right? Because we all,
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.200]  like every, I'm sure everyone here, all five of us know Malawi has these core genetics.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.880]  There's barons in there. There's all this unique stuff. There's old history about dogons and
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.120]  shit like that going on in Malawi. So anyway, this guy is sending us into the States,
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:03.720]  some of the premier stuff that he has identified out of that year long sabbatical. And we've
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.880]  reciprocated and done some stuff from our end to help them with type three, but I should be
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.320]  having that to start work on here in the next maybe, I don't know, two to three weeks. And so
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:18.440]  I'd like to get that going. The first plan with it is all open source is to do seed increases on
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:24.040]  it like we do and then cast it out to everybody. Yeah. Two dogs, serious, start plan. That's what
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.680]  Rotten Skateboards is saying. That's exactly it. So this guy is the real deal. He's on the ground
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.280]  in Malawi. He knows about everybody else's subversive work to try and go in and dilute
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:42.520]  genetics. And he's really spent the time. I trust him to go find some hardcore, you know, true
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.120]  Malawi heirlooms. And so we're going to start working with those. And again, I just want to
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.480]  get them out to the community, get them out to the U.S. breeders because, you know, we're the next,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.760]  the second or third generation of breeders like Josh and I, Patrick, we're all getting there. We've
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.200]  spent some time in this industry, Thomas as well. It's I'm 30 plus years into it. And I still,
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.440]  you know, I still pay tribute and honor the generation before me that brought in these
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.600]  genetics from other parts of the world and put them together and created these amazing
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.240]  first hybrids from these heirlooms, you know, so to go back to that and do this preservation work
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.760]  and find that and maybe have an opportunity to bring that and that together again is what really
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.360]  excites me. And so that's where we're coming in. And granted, we are important. And that's just so
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.000]  super important, especially for you to say that, you know, I mean, that's what, that's the important
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.320]  thing. It's got, you know, we hold integrity in this industry. How do you hold integrity
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.200]  by being humble and honoring those that provided space before you? I mean, that's just the way it
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:50.840]  is. It is. It is. And, you know, so from a company standpoint, Jamal, we're still,
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:57.240]  because we focused on total THC compliance right out of the gate on 0.3 at full maturity,
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.320]  it gave us a big lead in international markets. So frontier markets where, you know, we're in 25
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:10.360]  plus countries moving seed where governments care, where they don't allow 0.4 or 0.5. So that's been
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.800]  a benefit to us. The type two is where we're heading, but our type threes have been a staple
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.320]  and will continue to be a staple. And, you know, my goal in the end is I think Josh and I both
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.120]  were out here in Massachusetts together temporarily, and we're talking about genetic
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:33.160]  preservation. We're talking about one, putting together a nursery to maybe help some of the
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:41.400]  breeders that we know get their genetics that are not maybe as elite or, you know, novel,
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.800]  but some of their genetics that are staples into the marketplace out here that has a thirst for
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.480]  them in a clean way and maybe help them bridge the gap while nobody sees value in their germplasm.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:57.560]  Because what I see is like Patrick's, Thomas, John, this germplasm is worth millions of dollars
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:05.880]  going forward. I mean, you know, we see a $6 billion transaction over a PDLX to Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:12.760]  And I mean, these are, these things dwarf canopy and these big MSOs. So the value in genetics and
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.720]  germplasm is real. So Josh and I, like I said, we're trying to figure out a way that we can maybe
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.640]  TC some of these things as legacy breeders who have the trust of the community to preserve them.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:29.400]  And also in the process of that, get some of their genetics into the marketplace in a clone variety,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.320]  hoping to put some royalty money in their pockets just to, anyway, bottom line,
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:40.760]  find in ways to bridge the gap. Because what I firmly believe is that we're in a point right now
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.280]  when nobody sees the value, the real value in the germplasm. A lot of what Patrick says is true,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.840]  like it's all about that THC, but the real value is in this diverse germplasm. So we got to bridge
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.320]  this gap. We got to bridge this gap together. That's the only way we're going to do it. And so,
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.800]  you know, not just talking about it, but like I said, I want you guys to know that, that actively
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.400]  Josh and I are here on the ground, literally pulling our hair out, bootstrapping together
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.080]  this beautiful nursery opportunity to help these guys to bridge this. And that's just one facet.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:20.360]  If anyone else can bring another idea or concept to how we do this, we all benefit from it in the
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.760]  long run. You know, the sum of the parts, man, is what it's all about to me right now.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:31.400]  Exactly. This is a great show, by the way, man. This is awesome.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:39.000]  Yeah, no, I mean, I think we had a, you know, it was a great combination of people. And,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.680]  you know, also like sometimes just like the moon, you know, the energy is just in a certain way that
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.920]  it just really comes out nicely, you know, because sometimes it's like kind of flat. But,
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.440]  you know, as soon as I heard, you know, Jeremy, as soon as you were like,
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.760]  oh, I have my buddies coming on, I was like, oh, this is going to be fun. And then,
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.840]  you know, when you said, I said, Soil King's coming on, you guys like, oh, yeah, I know Patrick. I
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.560]  was like, oh, yeah, this is good. This is going to be good. Okay, so here's my next question.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.040]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:15.720]  Um, and please don't hold back. Um, what is something that you would just urge to
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:22.760]  throwers in general, really breeders in general not to do? And just like a word of advice,
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:29.560]  like, please stop? Whatever it is? You know, that's my question.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.480]  I just say real fast, don't change the honor the breeder and everything that you do don't ever
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.720]  change the names and genetics. Make you know, some people think that's the right thing to do
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:44.040]  to kind of maybe put things into their box, especially the new breeder. It's not how we've
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.240]  done things historically. It's not beneficial. So don't ever mask your lineage. There's my two
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:58.280]  steps. I'd say two things. First, verify your cuts verify like if you did, if you're breeding with,
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.840]  let's say, I'm just gonna pick two random strains here, GMO and cap junkie. And let's
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.000]  say you got for some reason you want to combine those plants, you're going to reverse cap junkie
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.560]  and make some fem seeds between the two and make sure that that you can trace the provenance.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.560]  Make sure that you actually have the GMO cut, make sure you actually have.
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.040]  But if you didn't pop the seeds and hunt those seeds from a from an original pack,
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.400]  and you bought a clone from a nursery, or you got it from a buddy or whatever,
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:37.320]  you need to find a way to verify that what you're working with is really what you're working with,
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:43.800]  because there are a lot of fake cuts floating around right now. Strainly and a lot of like
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:49.400]  Instagram clone companies and stuff like they're just taking cuts, renaming them with whatever's
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.560]  the hottest thing and selling them for $1,000 a piece to make some money. They don't give us,
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.520]  they don't care that you're, you know, you got this big breeding project and your reputation
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:03.160]  is riding on that. And I guarantee you there's one thing that everybody on this podcast has in
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:11.240]  common. We have worked incredibly hard our entire careers to keep a good reputation through what
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.960]  Patrick was talking about a minute ago through integrity. We've been honest in our work. And so
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.760]  that's another thing I say, be honest in your work. Give credit where credit is due to those folks,
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.280]  verify what you're working with, and test your gear. Don't release stuff to the public,
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.320]  especially if it's seminar stuff, like don't release stuff to the public that you haven't
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:36.680]  grown out. Like I can't tell you how many times I've made a cross, especially film crosses where
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.560]  I thought something was just going to be absolute fire. And then I grew it out and it was so-so,
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:46.200]  but I ended up running into like some intersex trade issues or had, you know,
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.520]  germination issues and things like that. So just test your work, make sure you verify your stuff
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.180]  and stay honest. Go ahead, Thomas.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:03.540]  Well, I don't know. It's with the hemp industry, like I said, not a lot of people are doing
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:10.660]  anything. So just continue to be making F2s and back crossing into F3s is what we need in this
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:16.580]  industry. I mean, collaboration all together is what makes us better companies, you know.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.740]  I don't know. There's not a lot of people breeding CBD right now. I know it's not that popular,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:30.100]  but, you know, I don't know why, you know. I always get shit online. People are like,
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:35.140]  what, you breed CBD? I'm like, what are you talking about? You don't need a gram of CBD a day?
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:40.100]  Like, what's your problem? I don't know. But I don't know where I was going with that. But just
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:47.780]  I don't want anyone to be, you know, scared to do any breeding. So I just recommend them go forward
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.860]  and keep pushing them. Yeah, test your genetics, but just keep making them because that's what we
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.740]  need, especially in this in the CBD industry, type 2s, type 3s, and different cannabinoids as
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:02.100]  well. So reach out to me if you guys ever want to test anything. I do have a lab, Spectrum CBD
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:07.860]  Botanicals, and, you know, they test everything for me. You know, they'll test type 1s, type 2s,
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:14.180]  type 3s. I don't know if I should say that, but, you know, if you ever want to test, you know,
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:20.580]  that's where we find really crazy different, you know, cannabinoids like THCV. My buddy found it
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:26.820]  out of a Lemon Pledge cut, and it's a Lemon Pledge Auto THCV, which is really interesting. So,
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:31.700]  you know, always testing the varieties. And, you know, don't be scared to move forward, I guess.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.860]  You know, we all got to start somewhere. But how about you, Patrick?
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.900]  Yeah, that was good. Good point, Tom. I smoke CBD flour. I love that fucking high hit on terpenes,
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:49.780]  on good quality CBD. Like I smoke CBD flour. My dogs eat, you know, CBD products. And so CBD is
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:55.860]  part of my life, absolutely. I can, a good thing about a good terpene doobie on CBD is I can smoke
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:01.700]  it and get fucking high, and then really go back to spreadsheets in a half an hour and be, you know,
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:07.220]  not focused again. So I, during the day, I love it. I love a good, but it's hard to find good
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.660]  quality flour CBD. So Thomas, I'm down. Check out. Yeah, check out Thomas. I got
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:16.340]  some friends up in Wisconsin. We'd love to send you some flour and some seeds. Sorry to interrupt.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.540]  I would love flour and seeds. Let's do that. I can, I definitely.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:25.140]  Cornell, Cornell Urban Agriculture. I think you can find them on Instagram and online.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:31.060]  It's Cornell Urban Ag out of Wisconsin. They've, they're, they've got some of the best CBD flour
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:37.380]  I've seen. It's their, they're growing indoors and living soil, full living soil, raised beds,
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:44.980]  fully regenerative grow. Phenomenal folks doing a great job. They just started growing micro greens
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:52.180]  under their plants. It's pretty cool. Yeah. You mentioned Beliefer Blooms too,
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:56.980]  Thomas. That's another one we're talking about really high end flour. I see him doing some crazy
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:05.460]  stuff. Anyway, I don't want to hijack the podcast. You know, and go into it. What's a couple of
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:10.180]  things like, like just quit following social media. You're not going to find your answers
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:16.420]  on social media. Grab the belt loop of a real producer. Right? I, where do I get my knowledge?
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:21.140]  I get my knowledge from people that are higher than me and freely give it and we're working back
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:26.020]  and forth. Right. And it's a growing thing. You, a lot of people will go out to social
[01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:30.100]  meeting. They'll believe the hype and the white noise that's just thrown everywhere,
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:36.820]  but don't back that up. We Josh was talking a lot about cuts, right? You, they just renamed this
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:42.020]  shit. Right. And it's so crazy. And then Jeremy was talking about, you know, things that are going
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:48.100]  back to these, these, these people that a lot of people that are calling themselves breeders are,
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.580]  are they, you know, they're taking auto flowers and they're crossing it and they're getting this
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:56.900]  next thing. You know, you've got this unstable plant that throws polyps and does all this crazy
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:02.900]  shit down the line. It's like, grab the belt loop of somebody and run with it. I have friends,
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:10.740]  foundation, Joel, he's out here. Like I'm serious motherfuckers that have the base knowledge. And,
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:15.940]  and those types of people are hard to get ahold of and get answers from. And it's not because
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:20.420]  they're disrespectful. It's because they're answering a lot of people. So just don't,
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:24.260]  don't take that upon yourself as them being disrespectful, take it upon yourself as you
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:28.820]  need answers from an OG and reach out to that person and just keep asking the question. They're
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:33.300]  going to answer you. They're going to help you out. You know, we need to get this gene pool back
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:39.220]  up to where it's at and out of this cesspool that it's been in for so long. Just follow the right
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:43.300]  people. Quit listening to the white noise, you know, and do your craft. Like and believe in
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:48.180]  yourself. Hey, we didn't touch, we didn't touch on it. But one last point that I know Josh is
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:54.660]  super aware of is clean stuff. Like it's another thing we need to really work on is when Josh and
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.900]  I are talking about doing this nursery, a lot of why is we see dirty stuff too. And we see
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:04.500]  unverified stuff. The stuff that we want to do is all verified by breeder from breeder,
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:10.260]  be a breeder direct to us. And it's all byroid tested for eight viruses because people are not
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.340]  paying attention. And as a breeder, man, you don't want to be breeding that stuff. What,
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:20.340]  what I'd say about byroids and I, there's an argument here is that at the very least,
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:24.260]  and I've said this as a seed producer for a long time, at the very least, these byroids
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:28.820]  are intelligent enough. The more you learn about viruses, a very intelligent thing here,
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:35.300]  living, intelligent, not living to be not listening. That's right. And what the, at the
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:42.820]  very least, they will embed the predisposition for that byroid into the genomic sequence of that
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:48.260]  seed at the very least, if they can't put themselves in there. So we got to stop breeders
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:52.020]  from breeding with that. And we certainly need to stop it from getting in the market. So that's
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.060]  just another point I think of when I see you guys all talk. Yeah, you can't, you can just,
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:03.860]  everybody that's listening, you can pick up the hoplite and byroid from seed. Just FYI. So there,
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.020]  there's a couple of guys that are doing some research that I know. So I come from academia.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:13.620]  I've got a master's degree in genetics and there's a lot of research being done on this
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:19.940]  byroid, on the genes of the byroid, how we can stop it, maybe using not genetic modification,
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:27.300]  but some disruptors of the protein, like things that we could do to treat seeds, to treat clones
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:33.860]  that are systemic, that would interrupt the ability of the byroid to replicate. And so
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:40.660]  I'd say that too, is grab a genetics book, like just any genetics book and learn about genetics.
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.980]  If you want to be a breeder and you want to understand, you know, how to categorize traits,
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:50.660]  look through traits and things like that. Greg Green's Cannabis Breeders Bible is a pretty good
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:56.820]  one. You can get off Amazon. It's cheap. My very first grow book back in the early mid nineties,
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:01.860]  I think was Greg Green's Grow Bible, which is funny. Yeah, there you go. The Cannabis Breeders
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:07.940]  Bible. It's a great primer on genetics. It's well written. So you can understand what he's
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:13.700]  talking about. You don't have to be a, you know, have a bachelor's degree in biology to understand
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.820]  what he's talking about. He does a good job in that book of walking you through the process of
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:24.580]  creating something new, but also talks about stabilization and phenotype and chemo bars and
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:30.340]  stuff like that. So, but yeah. I would also capitalize on that, Josh. I don't know about
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:36.580]  you, but I'm super available and high touch, man. I've gotten to where if you're from Cresco or
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:41.300]  Ascend or something, you know, I'm probably not going to want to sit there and jabber with you
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:46.980]  on the phone, but if you're from the community and you have a question, I'm 100% engaged.
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.260]  Yes. And I'm here like a hundred percent for everybody that's engaged in FCP.
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:08.420]  I know Josh is as well. That's why we're here. Like we want this, we want to create sustainability
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.900]  out of this and we know it doesn't come from plasticizing and corporatizing the plant. It
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:18.980]  just can't. This plant is too nuanced, you know. For sure. I would, I just wanted to touch on
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:24.980]  Jeremy, you were, and I think a few of you were talking about citing your essentially
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:31.300]  based, recording what you're breeding with and not changing the names. And I call it citing
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:36.820]  essentially, because you know, you're using somebody else's work and you are free to use
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:43.540]  other people's work. You are just obligated to record whose work you use and how you use it.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:49.700]  And I would, I would say further, like a lot of us have cuts that are not a hundred, they are
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:55.460]  verified in certain ways. Like you have a story behind a cut. I got it from this guy who is
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:27:01.300]  notorious for this particular cut. That's what you put on your site. You know, this is who I got the
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:07.140]  cut from. And you know, you know, the little story of that cut. And I also would agree that, you know,
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:12.740]  you can kind of pick breeders. You, like you can get a lot of similar genetics from different
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:16.740]  people, but a lot of what you're doing is you're buying into a certain person's
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:22.500]  story. You're buying into their energy, their work that they put into it. So I always really
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:29.060]  encourage people to work with breeders that will respond back to them. If they send them an email,
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:33.940]  somebody that's going to get back to you because they're not so busy. Or if you know, they are that
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.940]  busy, just know that that's part of it, that, you know, maybe the seeds aren't going to pop and
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.500]  that's just the way it goes. But you know, like you're saying, Jeremy, there are a lot of people
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:47.620]  that you buy their seeds and they want to know how those seeds went. That's how I am. You know,
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:52.900]  I want to know if you were successful with my gear, if there was issues with it. I want to
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:58.020]  see those posts on Instagram to be like, oh yeah, you know, those plants are dope. You know, like
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:05.060]  a lot of us, that's, that's the medicine and that's the intrinsic value that we get out of this
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:10.100]  besides just the money, which goes straight back to your bills. You don't see any of that.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.020]  Goes straight back to your bills. You don't see any of that. And then at the end of the day,
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:17.860]  you're kind of like, why am I doing this? I'm tired. I don't have any money. I broke even.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.940]  Okay. But you know, when you have this connection with this new person,
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:28.340]  you have this product that basically the both of you have created together,
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:35.380]  you're able to get, in my opinion, what a lot of this are lacking in our society, which is this
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:43.780]  kind of connection to our craft and the reward of our work besides the paycheck that just goes
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:49.300]  to somebody else. Which kind of goes back to that same question, like the first question, which was
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:55.940]  like, how do you balance? So Patrick, the first question was how do you balance your career in
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:01.300]  this industry and a family life? Because, you know, I have a brand new kid and I'm learning
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.100]  all right, you know, you can't just be in cannabis your whole life and not pay attention to your
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:11.860]  family. And, you know, how are you balance these? And to me, it seems like through these personal
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:18.980]  connections, through the intrinsic values or intrinsic rewards of this work, you're able to,
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:26.500]  for me, get some of that balance back in your life. Simple. I can answer that question.
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:31.700]  How I do it, because my life is completely unmanageable with a family. You know, I got
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:38.980]  a mix. I got seven kids getting married again in June 10th. And so I do it. I write a journal,
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.900]  man. I'm writing my journal at night. I write it in the morning. It's the most successful thing
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:47.860]  I've ever done. You put notes in your phone. Doesn't matter because it doesn't comprehend
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:52.260]  when you put a pencil to a paper. Before I go to bed, I ask the good things I've done,
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:58.340]  the positive things I've applied in my life for that day, the top list things. And the top list
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:03.780]  things aren't business related. It's value in my family. Right. And then I wake up in the morning
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:10.500]  and I look at what I did yesterday and I plan the five most tasks in my life. And that is the most
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:16.260]  important. I have a to do list in business, but this is like for my family, you know, the love
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.140]  language and things for the wife, right. It's like, have you, you know, what can I do for her
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:26.660]  today? How can she feel more love? Right. What can I do to make my kids, you know, my kid has an
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:31.060]  event today. What can I do to make them feel special? What's that communication? I'm proud of
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:34.900]  you. You know, I'm really seeing you and I'm proud of you. It takes a little bit of time,
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:40.340]  but it means so much. So that's a great balance, you know, of what you're asking on that. And it's
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:46.020]  very important because I can work nonstop and forget about the most important people in my life
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:51.620]  very easy with the excuses. Hey, I'm fucking busy. Like you guys are, I'm supporting all this. You
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.140]  guys got everything you want. You got a whole, you know, you got the few box full of Benjamin's.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:59.540]  You got all this, but the reality is that that doesn't matter. That breaks families up.
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:06.420]  That breaks it up. Right. I can still provide that and honor their experiences in life. And I
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:11.620]  can honor who they are and make them feel good about themselves. And that's a reciprocal
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:16.180]  relationship that comes back to me when they tell me, I see how hard you're working today here. I
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:21.780]  just want to bring you a cup of coffee and tell you, I love it. That's serious stuff that answers
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:28.420]  that question. And then just to go back with Jerry, he was saying on a, on breeding a little
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:34.900]  while ago on, on a clock, I forgot, but it was something that it was important about,
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:42.100]  oh, about, you know, in breeders out there that we get, they get so big and they just want people to
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:47.780]  be tested. They want testers, but you, Jamal, you were talking about it too, is you have to,
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:53.060]  you have to grow your own shit out. That's so important. You, you, these so many people out
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:59.700]  there just producing, sending them off to testers. You don't, a tester means absolutely nothing to me
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:04.020]  because they, they're shitty growers out there and good growers out there, right? You don't know
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:08.820]  how we're cultivating it the same as you. You, they're not going to produce a plant and a bud
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:14.820]  and a seed like you're going to produce it. And you're just sending out to, you know, new growers
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:18.980]  that don't know how to grow. And next thing you know, they're talking bad about your good genetics
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:23.940]  or you're, they're talking good about your bad genetics. But really, if you aren't crafting and
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:28.900]  doing it yourself and, and stabilizing and doing whatever trait you're going to do to that
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:35.300]  cultivar yourself before you give it to testers, you really have gone too far. And that's, that's
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:40.500]  not good. That's going back to the septic side of the chain pool, right? It's like, so, you know,
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:44.420]  I just, those are two highlights I just wanted to bring out that we talked about. Very important.
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:51.220]  You're dead on. And what, what, what you said, Jamal, is true that we say, let the seed sale
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:56.820]  be the beginning of the relationship. I think a lot of people say, let the seed, okay, you bought
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:03.220]  a seed, woo, you're out of here. And to me, man, I want to know every freaking seed. That's my baby.
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:09.700]  What are they doing? And you want to know if your cultivator is good at cultivating before you become
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:14.340]  one of your testers. That's super important to know who you're giving the seed to. Well, dude,
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:18.580]  imagine the hemp industry where we got to sell these things to farmers that are, last year,
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:23.380]  they were growing corn. And this year they're growing five acres of hemp. And, you know,
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:26.820]  they're going to sit there and go, first person they blame is the damn breeder when they have a
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:33.860]  problem. What you are talking about, I saw Josh nodding his head, the Thomas nod, it's absolutely
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:40.900]  what we've experienced. Yeah. Yeah. I had a farmer I worked with in 2020. It was his first year
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:48.820]  growing hemp here in Massachusetts. Five generation farming family. They know farming like the back of
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:54.580]  their hand. That's all they do. And he comes to me. He's like, hey, I want to buy, I want to buy
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:34:00.660]  enough seed to do a hundred acres. And I'm like, really? Have you ever grown cannabis before in
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:06.500]  any, in any form? Like medicinally, have you ever grown cannabis plant? Nope. I was like, well,
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:12.340]  maybe we ought to start out with like 10 acres. Let's do 10 acres and not a hundred. And at the
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:18.900]  end of the year, that farmer came to me and he said, thank you. I'm so glad I listened to you
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:24.500]  because half of this would have sat in the field and rotted if we had done more than 10. And
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.740]  because the people don't understand like the, the Harvard, like planting the plant and getting the
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:33.220]  plants growing and getting them in the field and all that, that's, that's the easy part. Harvest
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:38.580]  and, and the post harvest process, that's where it's super labor intensive. It's a long hour days
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:43.780]  and it's all that. And so we, we offer anybody that buys, even if it's a 10 pack of seeds from
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:51.940]  us or if we're selling a million seeds to a customer, we offer seed to sell support. 24 seven,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:56.500]  you call me on the phone. I'm there. If I need to come out to your farm, I'm there. And I don't know,
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:01.220]  I can't fly across the country for people for a 10 pack, but I'm definitely more than willing to
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:06.980]  jump on a Skype or a zoom call and, and do anything that I can to help you out. I've got a full deck
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:11.780]  of SOPs I'm willing to get you if you, if you're learning how to grow and things like that. So we
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:18.660]  definitely do more than just grow or just breed. But, and then Patrick, I really, really love what
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:23.780]  you're doing with that, that journal. I told them I've just started doing recently journaling in the
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:30.900]  afternoons and at night. And I think having that journal to reflect on in the day, what you did
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:36.660]  and where you can improve and things like that. But I like how you have your kind of family focus.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:43.540]  That's really cool. Yeah. I like that a lot. It changed my life. It made me a better,
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:52.580]  made me a better, uh, you know, role model, parent and lover. Right. And easier on myself
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.580]  because I feel better. Like when I'm not forgetting the most important thing in my life
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:00.980]  every day, I'm honoring it and I'm reflecting it at night, what I did and I'm writing it down.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:05.060]  And then I wake up in the morning with a cup of coffee. First thing I do is I looked at my day
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:10.580]  yesterday and I understand what I did yesterday and how it applied to other people and how did
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:15.060]  it affect them? I can write down what it affected, you know, my daughter like this, my son like this,
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:20.420]  you know, so it's super, super important. There you go. And a pencil, it always goes back. I did
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:26.100]  this on, believe me, I did this on apps, on phones, I did the apps, I did everything. But when you put
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:33.540]  a pencil to a paper, that's constant. I owe this to my girl. Like she, she does this all the time.
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:39.780]  And so I definitely owe it to her. She got me doing it this year. And I'm just laughing because
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:44.740]  it's the most valuable thing like that she's brought or one of the most in my life because
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:49.620]  of what you said. You look back, you take a moment, you reflect on the things that you did
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:54.820]  that are very easy to forget and life goes by. So I agree, Patrick. That's an awesome thing.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:37:00.740]  When we talk about family, if you're struggling to find that balance, journaling is a really good
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.140]  way to find that balance. And that came from a woman who's been doing that for years and years
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:10.660]  and years with her life. She has four kids and is very engaged with all four of those kids and is
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:17.620]  also a VP of sales for a major HPLC company. So she's pretty good at balancing a lot. So I agree
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:23.620]  with you, Patrick, dead on the mark there. Yeah, thank you guys for that one. I mean,
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:28.900]  that was kind of striking to me. I'm like, all right, all these, these men are journaling. I
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:35.460]  thought that was for girls. But I mean, it seems like the best therapy you could have is, you know,
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:40.900]  with your journal. Matthew McConaughey is the one that got me started. I watched him. Matthew
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:47.140]  McConaughey pulled my mind. And so when I was doing it on my phone and all this, I'm like,
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:53.780]  it never registered. It's something to put in pencil paper, like you said, Patrick,
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:59.860]  there's that connection that you make, you know, with your brain and to the end,
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:04.420]  and you and now you've got it right there on paper and you go back. Yeah.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:09.380]  Well, you're talking to also, I just want to defend our masculinity a little bit too,
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:14.020]  because you're definitely talking to a bunch of guys that will drive dump trucks, pick up shovels,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:19.780]  build anything there is to be built. There's no question about it. So yeah, I love operating
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.260]  equipment and doing anything. I know Josh does, Patrick, I believe Thomas in the same way. So
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:29.860]  in that, in that sense, I don't think it's something that's, you know, softer at all.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:34.820]  I think it's really important that we remember that with like spreadsheets to cultivation,
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:41.540]  to **** tractors, to dump trucks all day long, all day long. And then back to the journal. I start
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:47.460]  with my journal. I end with my journal, man. Is that, is that sissy la la? No, that's **** manly
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.540]  right now. That's how I get up and have a productive day the next day.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.380]  Peter in the comment threads talking about playing with Barbie makeup right now. So see,
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:04.020]  he's engaged with family too. On that note, as I'm watching this go by, I see a lot of talk about
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:09.780]  Durban and Durban's been a conversation of Josh and I's these last couple of days because,
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:16.180]  and this is important to talk about a little bit. Legacy markets are existing. Traditional markets
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:20.420]  are sustaining a lot of people. And this has been a, on a serious note, this has been a hard
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:25.540]  industry for a lot of people. And if I can say it without getting choked up about it, because the
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:31.220]  guy's a very good friend of mine, but we had a great breeder and grower here in Oregon, a legacy
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:38.100]  grower for 30 years, and he produced some amazing genetics. He was a top shelf grower. And unfortunately
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:42.900]  the stuff just got too hard on him. He had kids and unfortunately just got too hard on him. And
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:50.180]  he took his own life in October of last year, but he brought to light this. And so it's really
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:56.900]  important that we preserve these people's legacies too. And he brought to light this cut that I've
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:03.620]  been familiar with for 25 plus years called the Mount Hood Magic in Oregon. And the Mount Hood
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:10.100]  Magic had two crosses, two cuts that these guys released. And honestly, Josh can, he can speak to
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:16.260]  the lineage is better almost than I can. But essentially one of those cuts is the Durban cut.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:24.580]  And it carries a lot of Durban traits. This is some of the best, best smoke that I have ever seen.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:30.260]  It would, you can read about it in the forums. We were reading about it yesterday, how 12 pounds
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:36.820]  would drop in Portland, in Oregon, and it would be just gone like a vacuum in two days, right, in the
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:43.380]  medical markets. Well, through those traditional markets and the trust that I've gained and the
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:48.020]  fact that this guy was a friend of mine since we were 18 years old. I mean, how rare is that? You
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:56.580]  know, we're, we're 50 now. We ended up with that cut and the guy's name is Joel Jennings, if anybody
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:02.980]  knows him. He had Pudding River Farm and Five Zero Trees, but we want to honor him with that cut.
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:08.820]  And so if anybody has any good, you know, we have it, we have access. We want to put it out into the,
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:13.860]  into this program that we're doing with the nursery. But you know, I'd like for that to, to
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:18.420]  first circle in our community. So if anybody has any good ideas as to what we should do with that
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:25.540]  cut, we hold it. It's a legacy cut. It has never hit any of these commercial markets. There's one
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:30.900]  other group in Portland that had access to it. They've been very good at holding, holding tight.
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:36.820]  And so this is a very special legacy cut that is one of those gems. And so I put it out there
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:41.380]  to the community at FCP that if anybody has any good way that we get that out or
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:46.500]  any intelligent people that should get that cut first, let us know and we won't
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:51.300]  send it out in the wrong way. It has those Durban notes that we're all looking for. And Josh can
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:56.660]  attest to that. It is absolutely that Durban fuel. But yeah, that's, that's, I wanted to get those
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.500]  two cents in before we parted away here and sorry for being a little choked up about it, but it was
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.740]  is a rough one, man, to see that happen to somebody that's really worked that hard in the
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:10.740]  space and done that much. Yeah, that's awesome, man. That's a good story. And that's honoring
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:18.740]  and respecting. Right. And I see, I see Joel Hytal Foundation out there in the chats. He's awesome.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:24.820]  He's helping me with all him and Mama K are, you know, the back end helping put on this whole
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:30.020]  Legends of Legacy marketplace and just super excited. They're coming out to Kansas City,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:37.380]  Missouri with the event out there at KC CannaFest. But he's talking about a men's group. He's done.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.980]  If you're looking at the comments and everything about it, he's, you know, I don't know how many
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:46.180]  people don't know him out there, but everybody probably should. Anyways, there's a lot of good
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:53.220]  people. And he's a good friend of mine. I honor and respect him. Well, that cuts available. I
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.060]  want to know that. So if anybody thinks of an intelligent way to get to the community,
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:02.660]  let us get it there. Otherwise, if anybody here that's talking about Durban wants access to that
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:10.740]  cut, all we ask is that we somehow honor the legacy of Joel Jennings and Pudding River Farm
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:16.260]  and what he did for our community. I'm down. I'm down. However I can use, Jeremy,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:22.260]  any support you need from me on anything on any level with that, let me know. Absolutely. 100%
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:26.740]  support, marketing, whatever we need. Well, maybe it starts with just getting it out to this
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:32.500]  community because I see the thirst right now for Durban. And you know, this is a preserved cut. I
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:36.500]  mean, this is also a guy that taught me about solar radiation therapy for preservation of
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:41.380]  mothers. You know, we would be growing indoors to hide from everything. And our mothers over
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:46.820]  years, as good as we are, they would just get degraded. And so he taught me about how to,
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:53.140]  really strengthen and preserve mother varieties. And so how rare is it even now that we have a
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:58.340]  preserved mother like that, that's verified and transmitted for 25 plus years, right?
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:04.260]  That's crazy. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. We have to figure that out. Like I said, anything I can
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:09.780]  do. I don't know where you're at. Do you ever want to come down and be a panel guest for the
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:15.060]  education at Legends of Legacy Monthly Marketplace? Jeremy, come on down, man. You guys want to bring
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:20.580]  a podcast and do a podcast on site? We can do that as well. There's great internet and all that.
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:28.020]  We can do a grow off with that. Like there's a lot of different ideas. We can do it. And if
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.620]  anybody needs, wants to come down to the event and help out with volunteering, we got Rasupa in the
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:38.820]  chat room. He's handling and running up all the volunteers to get it ready. It's your marketplace.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:43.940]  That's what I say. It's the Soil Kings, Legends of Legacy Marketplace, but it's the Legends of
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:49.140]  Legacy, or it's your marketplace. If you have an idea, you want to do a private event, you want to
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:55.620]  do any of that. It's a Soil King community event center, you know, marketplace. And so like, let's,
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:45:00.500]  let's do this. Like we can support each other. We can honor each other. We can take that craft and
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:05.460]  that cultivar you're talking about, and we can do a grow off right there. You know, it doesn't have
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:10.340]  to be that big, but the marketing behind it takes what you're honoring and that name and throwing it
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:16.340]  out to the world because we do amongst all of us have a platform that's worldwide. You know, so I'm
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:21.860]  in whatever you need. I'm in on that. Cool. Well, let's figure it out. Let's keep the dialogue
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:26.980]  rolling after the podcast and let's figure out exactly what, what we might be able to do to
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:32.980]  honor that because I think it's really important that we do. Heck yeah. I think we, okay. I think
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:39.220]  we, we, we had lost Patrick. Let me get him back on. Here we go. Here we go. So my next one,
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:43.300]  we got a break though. I would love to collab with you guys though. If, if you ever wanted to
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:48.020]  send me a cut, I can hit it with some CBD and send it back or vice versa. If you guys, you know,
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:53.140]  Jamal, if you ever wanted to CBD cut, I got some pretty crazy stuff right now. So I don't know if
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.900]  you are interested in making one-to-ones or anything, but you know, and also the mountain
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:02.340]  magic you know, maybe just preserving it, you know, crossing it forward, you know, and just keeping it
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:08.100]  within the memory of people. So you know, just preserving it by making new crosses as well.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:14.020]  But yeah, yeah. Well, you can send it to me. Yeah. Definitely. Send it back. And yeah,
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.980]  I got like a legendary banana Mac coming and then a pineapple sugar cookies is
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.820]  So I have a question for you, Thomas.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:28.900]  Are there some strains that you find make better CBD strains than others?
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:37.860]  Yeah. Just the, the density, the bud structure, and then the oiliness of it. So just if it's a
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.900]  highly resinous, highly oily plant, it seems to be better. And then, you know,
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:49.700]  just compact bud structure as well. I'm not too sure why I just like the better bud structure
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:53.620]  indoors, you know, just a lot of the hemp varieties, you know, they're bred from cherry
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:58.180]  wine and things like that. They're a little bit larger and they have not as much weight in them,
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:02.740]  you know, so, you know, you grow a room and you don't necessarily get the yield that you want. So
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:10.100]  I don't know, better have varieties, you know, just, it's all about testing, testing what you,
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:15.620]  what you have, you know, 30, 35 to ones are generally and above, you know, for some reason,
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:20.900]  you can get 30, 35 ones and all of a sudden you get like a 70 to one out of that. But
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:26.900]  kind of like what I meant was like, like, so it sounds like you can take a strain,
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:34.580]  you can take like a variety and turn that into a CBD or a one to one like to that.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:40.580]  Yeah, we did that, but we did that before a couple years ago where we had, it was called
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:47.700]  the chemotype conversion project. And we did, and we took a bunch of cuts, type one cuts,
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:55.620]  and work them forward to type three. With the goal, and we did this with Keylon pod cut,
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:01.300]  we did this with GDP, with the cookies and cream cut, we did a cherry pie, we did
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:08.020]  a Malawi diesel, speaking of Malawi, we did, I don't know, I think it was about 10 total,
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:16.900]  we did banana OG, bubble cush. Anyways, what I found in that is if you run it as a type one,
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:23.460]  if you'll notice on COAs for some type ones, there's some, a bit of predisposition for CBD
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:29.140]  in some of them. Some have no detectable CBD whatsoever, and then some have a detectable
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:35.860]  amount of CBD. The ones that have a detectable amount of CBD seem to convert easier, and you
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:42.660]  get less, like it took us to about F5 generation with a back cross to get them stabilized as true
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:50.100]  type threes. But at the F4 generation, we thought we were stabilized at F4, and we luckily ran out
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:55.380]  of a population of a thousand plants, and in that thousand plants, we had about three pop up that
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:49:02.660]  were still type two chemovars. So it took a little bit more work, but what I've seen, if you're doing
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:08.340]  that conversion from type one to type three, and you're trying to produce it, at least so it'll be
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:13.940]  compliant, you've got to find something that has a little bit of predisposition for CBD. And there
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:19.540]  may be some outliers to that, that's just what I've seen. Thomas may have a completely different
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:28.340]  experience. Yeah, I don't know. Just like what I've seen is just that I can almost breed anything
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:34.020]  into anything, and take those terpenes, that bud structure, whatever I want. So I made unicorn
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:40.900]  butter, and I didn't focus so much on bud structure. It's not the most dense flower in the
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:47.700]  world, but it does carry those GMO terpenes over. So I'm not really seeing a problem with
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:54.660]  type one or type two genetics ever coming out with the type threes. So I don't know, as long
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:00.100]  as I can pull out that F2 or the back cross of that CBD genetic, I'm not really seeing any problems.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:06.180]  But maybe I'm just not hunting through a big enough population, testing every single phenotype.
[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:11.460]  But everything seems to work out, but it's all with the genetics. I don't know where I'm
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:16.900]  going here, right now, but it's generally when I pull out those genetics,
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:23.220]  like a unicorn butter, one of my keeper phenotypes, Flow Gardens, it's the skunk butter phenotype.
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:30.980]  That's like a 70 to 1. We're getting around 2% CBC. So that was actually from the cherry blossom.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.580]  So I took that cherry blossom, crossed it into the T1, and then made Buddha's Hand,
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:43.380]  and then I took a Buddha's Hand male. Is that Black Rose A? The Black Rose?
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:48.900]  No, that's the Chardonnay phenotype. But no, it was originally the Chardonnay phenotype.
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:54.980]  But yeah, well, HGH doesn't like me too much, so I don't know.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:59.460]  HGH isn't HGH anymore.
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:01.460]  Right? I know, it's just important.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:05.300]  They don't want me to start talking about HGH genetics right now.
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:11.940]  No, no, I'm just saying people ruin varieties, and then like you say,
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:18.740]  mislabel them, and then all of a sudden, this variety is super horrible, where it was absolutely
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:23.700]  a legend in the beginning. T1 was a legend. Now you tell people you got T1, or whatever.
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:29.940]  But it's amazing, like Afghan super orange terpenes, great bag of pears.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:36.180]  I love the T1. I used the T1 in the Opalumpa and the Strawberry Orange Trifle, and
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:45.060]  it's such a phenomenal plant. That orange terpene profile is just, it's so crazy. It was the first
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:52.420]  hemp plant that I grew, CBD dominant plant, that had a terpene profile that wasn't Cherry Wine or
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:54.100]  Boxer Otto, basically.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:52:01.140]  Right? Yeah, yeah. And that's from a Pakistani Citroen Kush, Dude's Diesel, I guess, and then
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:06.340]  hit to the R4. So I'm guessing the Dude's Diesel is probably some sort of catatonic diesel cut.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:13.300]  But even with autoflowers, I'm finding that first generation, yeah, there's a lot of weird stuff. But
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:19.460]  as long as you can hit an autoflower to an autoflower and back cross it, everything seems to
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:24.500]  stabilize. You know what I mean? And then just it's pulling out phenotypes and blood structure,
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:32.180]  I guess, in terpenes. But- Excellent. So my next question for all of you guys is,
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:44.020]  what do you think is a practical population to look through for selections? Now, of course,
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:48.580]  the largest population is best, but for when you're selecting by smoking,
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:55.460]  there's only a certain amount of samples that really becomes practical to go through.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:00.020]  Yeah. So I mean, this is, I guess, mainly for like a,
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:04.820]  you know, quote unquote, hobby grower. But just in general, like, what do you think is a
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:10.660]  practical population to go through when you're smoking every sample to make a selection?
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:18.180]  You know, people say they go like thousand seed phenohunts, and, you know, that's great and all,
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:22.580]  but, you know, try to clone a thousand plants and then try to smoke all those plants and then try to
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:28.500]  keep them all organized in your head. And it's really hard to do. You know, I've tried it before,
[01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:32.260]  you know, especially in an outdoor environment. It's like, how are you going to clone all those
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:37.860]  varieties and bring them indoor? Then I don't know. And some people say they do thousand plant
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:43.140]  phenohunts, but, you know, sure, you can pull out the best structure, the best smoke, but I don't
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:50.820]  know. It almost is too overwhelming, I find, just like, you know, which one is the best. But, you
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:56.900]  know, you can find seeds, great seeds from, you know, if they're really good seeds and really
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:54:02.420]  good genetics, 10, 20, 30, 50, you know, a lot of people say you got to do more genetics, but
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:07.060]  sometimes you just find that amazing keeper cut in, you know, 10 seeds. That's what I found the
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:14.740]  legendary OG. You know, it's a legendary OG from Zara Farms and it was a bag seed, you know, but,
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:19.220]  you know, sometimes you just get that ultimate beautiful phenotype and who knows what it is.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:25.220]  So, you know, that was from like 30 seeds, I think, but, you know, I haven't seen anything
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:30.020]  before since from that seed population that's kind of like that. But I don't know, you know,
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:36.900]  you can find anything from five seeds to, you know, 200 seeds, but, you know, over 200, I would say,
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:40.420]  starts to get confusing for me. I don't know.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:44.980]  Well, you just said it really well, Thomas, when you talked about a breeder. If it's a good breeder,
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:51.460]  you should be able to look through a subset of 50 and find most of the examples. Like we find,
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:57.540]  yes, in a subset of a thousand, there tend to be one or two anomalies in there that are unique
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:02.260]  that you find, but you'll find most every example of a good breeder is working for 50 seeds,
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:07.460]  certainly 100 seeds. So from a, you know, from what you're talking about, Jamal, a guy trying
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:14.020]  to just get that hunt done and find his selection to move forward, either to breed with or to
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:19.780]  produce as a clone, I think 50 is a really good number to start with. And that's kind of where we
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.860]  at now. We have an unfair advantage with hemp, like all of the breeding that you guys were
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:31.780]  talking about doing, you know, we effectively did through population. Like we did 10,000 examples
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:37.620]  of these American feral crosses year one that we did the breeding in through 10,000 examples.
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:42.580]  When you take the time and you spend the money and you do the analytics and you really get some
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:47.860]  nose out there, it gives you a massive advantage. So when you guys are talking about pulling this
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:53.140]  profile or pulling that profile, we just had this massive subset to look through and go, yep,
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:58.420]  that's got thiols. Yep. That has this, let's pull that here. Let's do that. This has a 30 to one or
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:05.380]  better. But that's a totally unfair game. So the trick to me is a good breeder, work with good
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:11.300]  breeder stock and maybe 50 seeds or less through your hunts and you should find everything that
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:17.460]  you want to find. I mean, I also feel that sometimes or often those outliers don't breed
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:25.780]  for being an outlier. They often breed for the mean of the population anyways. I like to look
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:32.900]  for things that are pretty much in the middle of the population because that's what most of them
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:42.020]  are and their progeny will be similar to that. Instead of looking for this one unicorn out of
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:50.020]  all of them because, I mean, I don't know. I haven't found many crazy unicorns that check
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:54.980]  every single box. There always seems to be a box that doesn't check.
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:57:00.340]  I've got to go through wilder populations. You'll find some unicorns in those 200 seeds we sent you,
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:06.420]  those 50 a piece, because they're just wilder and looser. Yeah, go ahead.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:11.060]  Well, I was just going to say too, like you're talking about the wilder populations, they have
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:15.380]  these unique recessive traits that pop up and those are kind of usually the unicorns where you get
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:20.820]  these dominant recessive traits that are overexpressive. Now, those are hard to breed
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:25.300]  with because you're not going to see those traits pop up in that next F1 generation.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:33.540]  I think a lot of it has to do, like if you're working an F1 line, the F1 ratio is one to two
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.660]  to one, right? You're going to have 25% that are similar to the mom, 50% of the population is going
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:44.420]  to be a combination of mom and dad, and 25% they're carrying the traits of the mom. You get to that F2
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:50.500]  generation though, there's a lot of variability there and you have a lot of different traits to
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:54.660]  look through. You're going to find traits from the grandparents, you're going to find ancestral
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:58:00.580]  traits from land races way back, you're going to find the F1 traits popping up again. And so,
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:04.980]  Jamal, I like what you said about kind of finding that middle of the pack, because that's part of
[01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:10.020]  what we do with our F2 line is we look for that kind of middle of the pack, something that's a,
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:15.620]  that we know if we breed that into an F3, F4, that it's not going to be some crazy recessive
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:20.500]  trait that we got to hunt through another thousand plants to try to find that one unique trait again.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:25.780]  And we want to make sure that the traits that we're, like in our catalog, we say, oh, this plant
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:30.260]  has these certain traits. That's what we want the people who are growing the plants to see. We want
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:36.020]  them to see those traits that we're, you know, and so if you're trying to breed with recessive
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:41.460]  traits or non-dominant traits or these unique unicorns, they're good to have as cuts, right?
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:48.420]  Like you can pass those unicorns around as clones, but for breeding, they pose some challenges for
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:56.260]  sure. Yeah, I go back to what, you know, Thomas said in our earlier conversation, it's so important
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:01.940]  when you're looking, when you're, you know, when you're smoking and you're looking for that in the
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:08.260]  smoke, it's super important to have the same cultivation and doing your own cultivation with
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:13.460]  the same system, right? You can, you got all this to test, you know, you can't, like that's the
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:17.700]  problem with a lot of testers, right? Is you don't really know what's going because every, the style
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.420]  is different and the style, you know, your cultivation is going to be stimulated from the soil
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:28.340]  or your cultivation style, whatever that cultivation style is. So it's super important to grow your own
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:32.980]  when you're, when you're identifying where you're going with it. And so you have a consistency
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:37.620]  of the smoke so you can identify the different turkeys and different flavors and, you know,
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:42.820]  different structures. And for me, like the M80, the M1000, Mama Cheese, all that different
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:48.100]  cultivars that I've done and a number of other ones, you know, I always started, nobody really
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:53.300]  taught me, you know, I'd started with a thousand seeds. I'd pop the thousand seeds and that's where
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:57.220]  I'd start out from. And I'd be going back out of that thousand. Of course, I did it all in
[01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:02.980]  greenhouses and back into the 215 movement where I, you know, I have a thousand fucking plants in
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:09.460]  a greenhouse under a 99 plant. I'm doing federal time, right? But I got multiple greenhouses stacked
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:15.620]  with different, and I would end up with a couple males, right? Identifying the structure, the
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:20.340]  terpenes on those couple of males that I really wanted to hit and four females out of a thousand
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:25.780]  fucking plants. And then that's where I would start my craft from that moment on. And it was,
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:33.060]  it's a lot of, it took my entire life at that moment, right? It was my fucking job, right? And
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:37.460]  a lot of time and energy that goes into it, but it's so fun. It's your passion when you're doing
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:43.220]  it too. And I, you know, the things that you learn from morning to midday to afternoon,
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:48.260]  like I remember going in in the afternoon, I'd love, I'd walk through in the morning,
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.780]  I'd be identifying, marking different plants. And I'd come in a few hours later and-
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:53.620]  Totally different.
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:58.340]  Completely different. And in the afternoon, I'm like, God, this one has absolutely no smell.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:03.220]  So I realized that had, it was a timing thing. I didn't know, I'm learning all that. So,
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:07.220]  and you're crapping out. And I have those cultivars. I've always had them. I haven't,
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:11.780]  I haven't gone to other stuff because I'm not a breeder. I'm not spending my life doing that
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:18.740]  anymore at this time, you know? So anyways, yeah, it's a good conversation, but I'm learning a lot
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:22.100]  with what you guys are saying. I'm listening a lot as well. This is awesome.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.420]  And I don't want to seem weird either, but I do want to like ground us a little bit with this
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:32.180]  particular very, very wise plant and just present the idea that there is an element of quantum
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:37.940]  physics here. There is an element of intention. There is an element of selection that comes from
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:43.220]  your intention, you know? So again, like go on, flash my logo a little bit, like-
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:43.860]  Other side.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:49.140]  Can't even get it up there. But yeah, but you know, just look, it's, it really is about, well,
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:55.540]  anybody can find it, but the logo, people know it. It's, it's about, about quantum physics,
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:01.220]  man. It's about intention. It's about the desire of creation. And a lot of what we've done is
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:05.860]  because of that. Like I said, it's really weird in talking to these science guys,
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:09.300]  which Josh does a lot. We've had communication with a guy named
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:16.820]  Dedi Miri. And Dedi Miri is the understudy of Raphael Mishulam. He's out of Israel and he's
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:20.900]  deep into looking at this plant now. And he's smart enough to have figured out what we know,
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:25.940]  that nature has a lot to do with it and you can't isolate a compound and have it have high efficacy
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:30.660]  because that's the first thing we want to do is synthesize everything and make it fake.
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:36.340]  We can't, we can't do that. But on the phone with this guy one day, they've been taking our germ
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:41.460]  plasm and doing research at Technion Cancer and Cannabinoid Research Center. So they're putting
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:45.940]  the genetics that we have onto different human disease indications. And they found something
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:50.980]  that was interesting to them. And he said, look, we, we want to get that germ plasm over here and
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:56.020]  have our grower grow it. And I presented to him the idea. I said, look, I'd like to do that for
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:02.100]  you, but I would really like to be the one to grow that as I have historically for you, because I
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:07.540]  firmly believe that when you germinate this seed, a lot of what comes from the seed has to do with
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:13.940]  the person that germinates it. And I wasn't afraid to say that to a guy with multiple PhDs because
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:19.220]  it's time that we fucking evolve, pardon my language. And it's time that we recognize that a lot of how
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:26.660]  we have done this so successfully for 30 years, how we literally thwarted an entire system saying,
[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:31.380]  we're going to route you out like scourge. And we said, bull fucking shit, you will, we're going to
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:37.060]  make a living and create an industry out of this right strongly. And a lot of how we did that is
[02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:42.340]  through not believing that everything exists through a myth of limited abundance, that in
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:47.860]  order for my plate to have more on it, I have to have somebody else's plate be emptier. We didn't
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:53.300]  believe in that. We believed in the ability to create abundance. And so again, like I want to
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:59.140]  really stay grounded here and say, this is why I believe Thomas has created these amazing genetics
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:03.700]  that he has. It's because he's sitting there with his heart doing these crosses with conscious
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:10.260]  thought and with intention. Same with Josh. And I will say we're the same way. Our genetics are novel.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:16.340]  They're patented because they're so unique compared to Oregon CBD who had to tripoid their shit to
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:22.740]  protect it. But that's because of intention. That's because of our relationship with the plant.
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:27.860]  We aren't necessarily growing the plant. The plant is sometimes growing us.
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:34.020]  This plant is figuring out really critical parts of our system. The ECS really critical parts of
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:39.460]  how we survive and evolve. So I just want to keep it there at some point and just say, look, man,
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:44.740]  we got to bring it back down there. If we want to evolve the way that we're trying to do things
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:49.860]  is not correct. The way that we want to corporatize cannabis is it's a microcosm of all the things
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:54.500]  that we're doing wrong for our kids and our kids' kids. We're not creating a better future for them.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:05:01.060]  So simple. So simple, guys. Just don't live by the limited abundance. Realize that this plant's
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:06.900]  given us an opportunity to create. And if we create with intention, the outcomes are incredible.
[02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:14.900]  If nothing else, I'm the proof. I'm the most ripped off breeder right now in type three plants.
[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:20.340]  So I haven't made hundreds of millions of dollars. But the fact is, is our genetics have permeated
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:26.020]  25 plus countries. They've been novel enough to gain U.S. patents for protection, which is
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:31.860]  another thing I'd like all of our breeders to look at is the value of their genetics when they protect
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:37.460]  them, not to keep people from working with them, but to give them the right to open them up safely
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:43.460]  and freely without one of the four big agribusinesses owning them in the future. So, you
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:48.500]  know, again, this all comes from intention, guys. Sorry to grab the podium again to steal your,
[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:53.700]  you know, your platform, Jamal, but you triggered me there with what's being said, that a lot of
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:59.940]  this isn't about populations of seeds. It's about heart and intention. And the plant has taught us
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:06.900]  that all our lives. Every meal, guys, that I have had in my adult life, and I'm 51 years old, is in
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:13.300]  some way, is in some way associated or related to this plant. Every single meal. And every single
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:21.220]  meal my kids have had, right? So true, man. You're not taking over. That's awesome. You've given away
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:25.860]  a good lot of information. Just the word intention. Just keep coming back to the word intention. It's
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:32.660]  so true. You know, you give your life and you're honoring this plant, you know, and that intention
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:37.620]  that goes in. And I mean, it's so reciprocal, isn't it? Like if you've given that much, you feel that
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:45.220]  much in that word intention, but it's given us so much in return in every level, like serenity.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.300]  I mean, it goes back to you're playing with this plant. You're doing things that are just
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:58.180]  soul searching, calming, right? It's a form of counseling, to be honest with you. I go out in
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:03.060]  the field. I go out and I'll say it over and over again. There's no segregation in agriculture.
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:09.700]  There's just no segregation in agriculture. Cannabis is such a less than a small percent
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:16.020]  of agriculture worldwide, but it has the biggest meaning behind it because it set the bar
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:22.260]  of quality to the highest point. Agriculture let cannabis run loose and said, okay, well,
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:26.500]  if you're going to start doing cannabis, we're going to put all these regulations that they'll
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:31.540]  never be able to meet. Well, guess what? Not only we met them, we're blowing them away. And now
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:36.420]  we're called to action is, hey, fuck you, big ag. Come on up to our level and quit cheating the
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:41.380]  game. Right? So they, we said, it's the most important part of agriculture. It's the smallest
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:46.500]  part of agriculture. And that intention behind it just sets the bar because we're a community
[02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:50.420]  and this is what we do with our life. We don't do it for the money. We do it for
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.900]  the pleasure, right? We do it for the experience. We do it because that's what we are. We're one
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:56.580]  with the planet.
[02:07:56.580 --> 02:08:03.780]  100%. 100%. I think there was like a dog in the background. That was also,
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:07.060]  I'm sorry about that. I got a dog barking. I got a dog.
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:16.340]  No, no, no. That was about a hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, all right. Well, I have one last
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:24.500]  question and then we'll wrap up. My question is, are there any products that you guys are
[02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:30.980]  really excited about for the future? I mean, preferably like good hemp products. Cause I
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:35.300]  know there are a lot of bad ones out there. So like any companies or any types of products that
[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:40.420]  you would say like are a good way to look or, you know, positive products that will help people.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:48.180]  I would say, Ohio Energetics, their products are produced with intent.
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:56.820]  Their bioavailability is bioavailability with cannabinoids. Most CBD products are either
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:03.540]  gummies or tinctures or whatever. A lot of them are. Bioavailability is an issue, right? And so
[02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:13.620]  you're looking at, at best 10% bioavailability orally ingested. So finding a company that has
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:18.820]  a higher bioavailability and then looking at your dosage, daily dosage. I was talking about this the
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:28.100]  other day. You need at least two to three milligrams per kilo of body weight for dosage.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:35.140]  People should be taking a couple hundred milligrams of CBD a day, not just 10 milligrams
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:39.300]  of CBD and a gummy. It's not going, it's not going, I mean, it's good to get some,
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:45.300]  but you're not getting an effective dose, right? Like, so to get an effective dose,
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:53.140]  you need to either need to really increase the bioavailability or to take more so that you get
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:58.580]  more into your system. Because we lose a lot of, we lose 80% just through the first pass phase of
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:06.820]  the liver. 80% is gone right there. And so that first pass phase of the liver filters out. And
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:11.060]  that's why they're talking about, it's like, oh, well, you know, CBD products cause liver damage
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:15.620]  and stuff like that. It's like, well, it's because the bioavailability of the product is so low.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:20.260]  So if you do have liver damage, I would say maybe look at either some of the patches,
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:28.500]  like for Mary's Medicinals or Vapen. There's a lot of companies that are putting CBD,
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:32.980]  Rosin out, or CBD Hash. There's a lot of CBD flowers. Smoking Vapen's a great way.
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:39.540]  The bioavailability on Vapen and smoking is more like 90%. So getting your dosage up,
[02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:44.980]  finding companies, find a reputable company to buy products from that have chain of custody,
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:49.700]  that have current COAs and things like that. There's a lot of snake oil out there. Don't buy
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:54.020]  I say, don't buy really, if you're going to buy CBD from a gas station,
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:56.100]  really look into the company that you're buying it from.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.220]  Just don't, just don't.
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:57.940]  Or just don't.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:10:58.500]  Just don't.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:58.980]  Just don't.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:10:59.220]  Just don't.
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:10:59.460]  Just don't.
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:02.660]  If you're over 50, just don't.
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:09.060]  Yeah, just don't. A lot of times you'll see those products don't even have any CBD in them at all.
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:14.100]  Or they're isolate derived and that's not, you know, look for something that's not isolate
[02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:17.380]  derived if you want efficacy out of it. But yeah, you nailed it, Josh.
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:20.100]  Some full spectrum. Yeah.
[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:30.660]  What's Future Compounds, Future 4200. They've got a company, I think, that's Future Compounds.
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:39.220]  That's a reputable company as well. Cornell Urban Ag, like I said a minute ago,
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.340]  they got some cool products.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:43.940]  Mary's is good. You mentioned Mary's. I know Mary's.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:48.180]  When we were in Oregon, they were very specific about wanting a specific
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.620]  set of genetics grown by a special, you know, so when you hear stuff like that,
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:56.180]  but main thing is, yeah, just get your dosage up and stay away from isolate.
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:01.140]  Because if it's isolate derived, you got to take 10X to get even close to the same efficacy.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.020]  If you can get it there, going back to the beginning of our conversation,
[02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:06.900]  we all know this is about compound diversity.
[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:13.060]  This isn't about a single compound. It's about terpenes and flavonoids and stilvonoids and
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:14.020]  cannabinoids.
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:18.420]  Yeah. And I find that, you know, the smaller company, the better product you seem to get.
[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:23.620]  You know, these big companies, it seems to, I don't know, seems to get diluted or I'm not too
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:26.660]  sure. You probably get the lowest quality. Everything's blended together so they can
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:31.380]  sell a bunch. But, you know, I'm going to plug Floyd here. Floyd from Haku Seed.
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:37.460]  You know, I always tell people that to Floyd, I've cured my, well, my ex-wife, her mother got
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:42.660]  stage four glioblastoma and we cured her with a gram of TNC every day.
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:48.900]  So I always send people to Floyd from Haku Seed or hit me up if you guys ever want CBD, you know,
[02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:51.460]  I have a massive amount of CBD.
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:52.660]  Same. And that's, that's,
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:55.940]  So I would recommend going for smaller companies.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:01.700]  Where we all come from, too. Don't forget that. I think if this had been here long enough of giving
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:06.500]  out treatments like that, you know, we were known in Oregon for a long time for giving out
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:10.900]  those type of treatments or like your mother-in-law's glioblastoma.
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:17.300]  So all of us come from that again. Like I wouldn't say it on a podcast with 10,000 viewers where I
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:24.500]  knew that there was a bunch of MSO people trolling, but I'd say here, call us up. You can call me up.
[02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:31.060]  You know, if you need access to CBD, raw CBD, I'll either connect you with one of our small farmers,
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:36.900]  like Thomas says that single source, or if it's serious, we still do that all the time, man.
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:42.500]  I still get calls. The Instagram community is amazing. They've known us from 14 for being
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:48.660]  providers of oil treatments. And when it comes to that, I don't give a shit if it's THC or CBD,
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:52.820]  we'll make that oil and get it to people that need their loved ones to feel better.
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:54.900]  So yeah, I remember sending Mike.
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:00.580]  Oh, I just want to pull in Rosin into the CBD world. And maybe I should hit you up Patrick
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:03.380]  and find out your ideas about that. But I don't know.
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:07.940]  That's what I was just about to talk about, Thomas. The Cornell Urban Ag guys, they're doing
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:13.540]  Rosin-based tinctures. So you get a full, that kind of full spectrum terpenes and everything.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:20.260]  And I'm seeing that pop up more often where people are doing CBD Rosin-based tinctures or
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.820]  Rosin-based gummies and edibles and stuff, which is cool.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:31.540]  I've heard some fun Rosin from CBD plants. It's a very interesting effect,
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:34.100]  the Rosin that comes from CBD plants.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:41.060]  So yeah, to highlight on that, in 2016, 2017, anyways, my mom passed from cancer. She was
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:50.260]  diagnosed with under 90 days to live. And I was growing CBD strains that we were making.
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:54.420]  Ended up with one, you guys, I don't know if you ever searched mom, it's called Mama's Boy.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:15:00.340]  It's 21 CBD. This is way back when. And we were doing huge high time shows and I was pressing
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:06.660]  Rosin with it. My mom ended up living over two years. I end of life during my arms saying goodbye
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:13.780]  to her thanks to this plant without being all fucked up with other outside stuff. She did take,
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:17.140]  it was a yin to the yang to the other medicines really is what it was.
[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:23.380]  And so producing Rosin, Thomas was saying that oil consistency in different things. We got down
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:30.660]  to this 21 and the consistency was more like a THC Rosin. It wasn't super oily. So I was able
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:36.900]  to press the flour. And back then we were pressing flour, just started doing ice water hash with
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:43.700]  nicotine. But we were pressing the Rosin back then out of this one. Everything I did, I have one to
[02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:49.780]  one's mom's berries. I called it and a bunch of different cultivars, but the 20 to one was the one
[02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:54.660]  to press and Rosin. And the consistency of it was like a honey. It was tacky. It was sticky and it
[02:15:54.660 --> 02:16:00.500]  would come out and you could dab it. You could put it in a jar. You can do all that. So it was,
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:07.140]  those were super exciting times. Unfortunately, last year we lost the mother to that. Of course,
[02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:11.860]  I have all my seeds that I started with. So again, we're back to a breeding project.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:17.300]  And so you have to have time to do a breeding project. Is this not something you throw out
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:23.620]  there, crack a seed and call it 20 to one mama's boy again. Man, this is a three year minus project
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:30.740]  of cracking and finding and working and stabilizing and just like crazy. So anyways, with that,
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:38.100]  new products, let's highlight them, Jamal, for me. I'm a soil guy as well too. So I'm always
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:44.260]  crafting up the next thing that I've been working on King coffee compost. I took 1100 yards of
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:53.140]  quality compost that I met because I couldn't find any compost to buy on that scale and not doing it
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:59.460]  sustainable. So I was making these compost. I put 30,000 gallons of fermented EM one on it.
[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:04.820]  And I added a bunch of other inputs and it cooked it down for 24 months. It's premium right now.
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:09.620]  So high quality, but that's one of them that I'm going to. And I'm trying to get back into more
[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:15.380]  sustainable inputs. I've been working really hard on that and to grow the hemp, the hemp,
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:19.940]  the big thing and not to let the cat out of the bag on a lot of my most, well, that's my most
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:25.060]  exciting project was a King caution compost. But the next one coming online is changing the food
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:30.340]  source for, for, you know, animal feed across the world with hemp. And in order to do that,
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:37.060]  you have to grow and grow and would fermentation process and taking that hemp and pelletizing,
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:42.180]  pelletizing it and giving it back. And there's a whole different concept of this fertilizer that
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:47.460]  I've been working on for a long time. And I think that project will be up and running and probably
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:53.780]  launched next year. And not only that, it's the same pelletized fermented hemp that will be
[02:17:54.420 --> 02:17:59.940]  feeding, feeding animals, as well as will be eradicating across agricultural fields,
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:08.020]  right? Regenerating, regenerating, regenerating this, this ruined microbe. You know, this,
[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:12.660]  this, what I call it, and people hate it when I do it, but it's genocide cultivation around the
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:18.180]  world where they're just destroying, you know, a number of just, just wiping out the lands of
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:23.460]  biology and microbes and everything else. So it'll, it'll reapply and it's a fertilizer as
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:28.740]  well. So that's super exciting things I'm coming out with right now. I've been working on this,
[02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:35.700]  on this tech. Unfortunately, the last 2022 was, was one of the worst business years in my life,
[02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:41.300]  but what it did is redefined me on who I was and what I want to come out with and putting my time
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:47.300]  as a, into buckets that are going to do what I want to do back to the passion, right? Back to
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:51.860]  what you really want to do. So I got some really cool stuff coming out. I just talked really quick
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:57.380]  about another substance that I, and I can't because I'm under NDA with these world platform
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:04.500]  people, but we have a sustainable product that is going to knock off the cocoa market.
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:10.420]  So look for that coming right now. It's going to be super, super exciting. And all of our
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:15.540]  data over the last 18 months, just fucking, and it's sustainable and I can't talk anymore,
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:20.340]  but when I launch it, you guys are going to, the world's going to be badass. Super excited about
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:27.140]  that as well. That's excellent to hear. I'm, I'm, I'm really happy to hear that. It's, it's great
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:33.460]  that, you know, we can keep making the industry better and being, becoming a good example of
[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:41.220]  responsible agriculture. Dry agriculture. Yeah. Yeah. I would, I think we should maybe end it
[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:45.540]  about now. I would love maybe for Jeremy, if you would like to say anything to close out,
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:51.220]  cause I mean, I think you were the one, you know, that you're the impetus behind this, this
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:56.420]  podcast. So I would, you know, I'd love if you have any closing words. Or if you're this person,
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:01.780]  anybody else has any closing words first and then Jeremy, you can, you can wrap it up. Yeah,
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:04.580]  go ahead. If you guys want to say something, go ahead. And that's a great way to end.
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:10.260]  Thanks for having me here. Jeremy, again, so anytime you want to bring me in, I'm,
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:15.700]  I totally love the dialogue, man. I'm all about it. And then, Patrick, I did message you on your
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:21.140]  personal Instagram, but hey, if you ever need any CBD cuts, we have, I have some cuts that are
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:26.740]  coming in like 26, 27% total cannabinoids. So those would be perfect for pressing rosen. I
[02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:31.700]  don't know if you're still cultivating pressing rosen out there, but if you need anything, so
[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:36.500]  anything you want, but I'm dedicated to collab with all you guys as well. So thank you so much.
[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:43.620]  Yeah, I'll just say thanks to Jeremy, Thomas, Patrick, Jamal. It's been a pleasure. Always
[02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:49.620]  learn something new for everybody. Thanks for everybody in the, in the chat. I'm unfortunately
[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:53.620]  on the road traveling, so I wasn't sitting on my computer and being able to answer back in some of
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:58.740]  the questions in the chat, but yeah, this has been very informative. Thanks for Jeremy putting
[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:02.660]  together and everybody to take their time today to do this.
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:08.900]  Yep. Yeah, no. And I'd say the same thing. I started off by saying, thank you guys. If
[02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:14.820]  it was Jamal came forward and asked if maybe we want to have Josh on, on another podcast. And I
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:20.020]  said, that's a freaking great idea. Super brilliant guy. And then I thought Thomas should be here too.
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:24.500]  I'm really sorry that Floyd wasn't able to join us today because he would have been a great asset
[02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:29.540]  to have on as well. Just good human beings, but I'm super happy that Patrick was stepping in and
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:34.820]  filling his place. And I think we've given a pretty good picture of where we're headed. I mean,
[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:39.700]  I do want people to know kind of what we talked about a little while ago that Josh and I are out
[02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:45.220]  here in Massachusetts trying to put together sort of a nursery that's going to, you know, offer
[02:21:45.940 --> 02:21:50.420]  again to all of our breeding friends, an opportunity to gain some royalty, some top
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:55.460]  line royalty, put some genetics into the market, better clean. So we're kind of working on that
[02:21:55.460 --> 02:22:00.900]  project and would love breeder support. I also want to say again, that we have this mountain
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:07.380]  magic, this Durban cut, which is a, you know, a 25 plus year old cut. I know it is because I knew
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:13.460]  Joel Jennings for 30 years. And I remember that cut being there from before the time of anything
[02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:18.580]  coming, you know, any of these modern hybrids coming in and we'd like to honor him by getting
[02:22:18.580 --> 02:22:23.780]  that out into the community. So it's pretty open. I just want to make sure that it stays in our
[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:29.700]  circles to begin with. And I would love any feedback that anybody has about how to get that
[02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:36.500]  out into the community. You can contact me at Jeremy at Davis Hemp Farms, excuse me,
[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:43.140]  davishempfarms.com is our website. I'm also at Davis Herb Farms and at Davis Hemp Farms on IG.
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:49.220]  You know, please all this community, you're my community. So reach out to me and tell us what
[02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:55.940]  we should be doing to create coopetition, collaboration, and cooperation in the industry
[02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:59.940]  so that we can create something sustainable. Because guys, I don't know about a lot of people
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:03.780]  sitting here, but I know that if we don't create something sustainable out of this,
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:10.020]  I don't know what else to do. This is what I do. I'm a cannabis guy. I've given my life to this
[02:23:10.020 --> 02:23:16.180]  plant. And so it's absolutely necessary that we come together and create some sustainability. What
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:23.620]  Josh talked about in NorCal is very real. I mean, these people are struggling to feed families now,
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:28.180]  and that's not how it was supposed to end up. The people who did the hardest work shouldn't be there.
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:33.300]  So let's all come together and do what the plant has taught us how to do, have empathy and look
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:37.540]  out for each other. Because I don't think anybody who's worked with this plant for more than a
[02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:43.140]  decade or five years or four years, I'm going to put a timeline on it. Anybody who has grown this
[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:48.500]  plant and has it in their heart, it's gotten hold of them, they've paid attention. We all have
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:52.020]  empathy. We all know how to take care of each other. So let's try and do that a little bit.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:58.660]  Hey, last, we'll be at NOCO. Sorry for jumping in there just to pitch. If anybody's going to be in
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:04.820]  Colorado at NOCO, come see me in person. I'd be more than happy to talk about any of this, be
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:09.220]  more than happy to offer seeds to anybody, be more than happy to talk about genetic trade.
[02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:13.460]  Josh and Thomas, I hope you guys know that. Same with you, Patrick, Jamal.
[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:21.060]  Very open source. It's all about preservation. I think removing the middleman from commodities,
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:25.940]  which is all that money is, whenever we can to trade these commodities is really important right
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:31.620]  now. I think there's a huge value in offering things to people in the community without
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:37.140]  a dollar exchange. The dollar is a piece of shit that's driving us all. So let's stick
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:43.940]  together and try to support each other that way too. Awesome. Thank you guys all. Thank you,
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:50.020]  Patrick. Thank you, Josh. Thank you, Thomas. And thank you, Jeremy. And thank you everybody in
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:55.940]  the chat. Great show. I hope you guys have a great day. Yeah. Thank you, man. Appreciate it so much.
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:25:00.340]  Thanks, everyone. Take care, guys.
