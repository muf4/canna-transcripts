I keep dancing with the devil but he doesn't have a back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I really enjoy this, this is an everyday part of my life
Hey, this is, I'm gonna get into this industry
and it's gonna be part of my future
and I'm stepping into that
that initial step into the next level
What got you into that?
And what got you into what you do today?
Wow, I guess a series of facts
about how that happened, I guess
Always was around, you know, cannabis or weed as a kid, right?
I got my thoughts, I got my thoughts in my mouth
No, I didn't, she would have killed me if I said no
So, I found though, when I was a kid
and this is maybe a cautionary tale for some children out there
is that when you take weed at a young age
and there's evidence that supports this, right?
You can develop psychosis, you know, you can be susceptible to that
And I found that I used to smoke weed at 16, 17 years old
You know, it would make me think, right?
I think that's the typical, you know, you get that, right?
And that's what happens when you get THC
sometimes from your CB1 or CB2, you just have to quit
Yeah, when you get a little bit too high
and it's like, oh, I'm thinking way too much
I always get used to, I remember one night
one night I got really, really high
and like, this beast shot magnets into space
and it's like, oh, the space stuff, so the space boy
But anyways
But see, that is a good functional phase of that, right?
Like, sometimes you're just thinking and we worry
because society teaches us
It's kind of just second nature for us that the default of that
But when you seize your high, that's when you, you know
you can transcend with more, right?
Yeah, really great, great
So, what was that kind of moment for you?
So, you know, I used to sell some meat as a kid, you know
just, you know, like, the franchise sort of stuff
And it wasn't until, honestly, that I came to Vancouver in 2001
I think it was those, I was probably early 20s
Probably, I would bet you, you'd have some raw mullet at that time
which was popular, you'd have some Sweet Island stuff
You know what?
There was a lot of diesel going around that time
There was some original Jack Kerr going around at that time
There was some Northern Lights going around at that time
And the first time I came here, I just injured my back
So, it was probably my early 20s, mid-20s
And I injured my back and it was killing me
And I bought a house, right?
Because I was here for like two weeks
I said, you know, I'll go to this movie, right?
I bought an house and also my back pain was huge, right?
It was like gone, gone, gone
Disappeared
And it wasn't until years later that I finally realized what it was
Because when I came back, I'm from Toronto, right?
So, I came back to Toronto from Vancouver on my vacation
The first time I went to Vancouver
And basically, it came to the point where I was like, I got back
The pain was back
And I was like, oh, it must be the weather or it must be my bed
And I bought a new bed
And I went to the doctor and they misdiagnosed me
And there was a whole bunch of things
Because it ended up being sciatica
And I have it for the rest of my life now
Yeah, you got like a pain sciatic nerve, right?
Well, the nerve stretched too much
Now, the nerve goes too far, right?
So, over time, it's just, it's always in constant pain, right?
The nerves are always being painful
And so, basically, from that point on, somebody helped make that correlation
It's me, everyone else probably helped me with the pain, right?
It was constant
And then, I started to learn to use it also when I was doing physical activities
Like playing sports
But not only did it help with the pain, but it helped me most during those sports
Okay
So, now, this is, you know, I'm part of a legacy record
Because, you know, when I first went to Vancouver, I didn't stop going to Vancouver
So, let's just leave it at that, okay?
Yeah, it happened
So, I became part of the union in BC, right?
So, you know, always going back and forth between Toronto and Vancouver
So, I've been in this market for a very long time, right?
But I think once they said, hey, we're going to legalize everything
That gave an opportunity for everybody who's always wanted and saw the benefits of this
And saw how much potential we could build a market in Canada
And have a very unique market, right?
Yeah
Especially BC, like, kiddo, this is the heartland
This is our California, if you want to compare it to anything
Yeah
Right? It's probably the second largest region in the entire world that produces marijuana
Yeah
Right? So, because, like, you know, you go to the Okanagan
You go to parts of the lower mainland and every second has this
Yeah, exactly
It's going somewhere
There's every, it's part of culture, like, all my friends who made it
You probably, when you're talking about it, there's more plant growers growing on here
Than anywhere, which is pretty cool
I know there's, like, some huge fields out in bushes and places and stuff like that
But the Okanagan Valley is slowly becoming that
That's where your business is located
Yeah, so that's where we have our farm
Yeah, exactly
We have our farm out in Long Beach and we love Long Beach
It's such a great area and the community there is so friendly
Like, we had some problems at the beginning, but I think we've got to a point where
People know now that marijuana is coming in there
And I think, you know, there's a little bit of stigma that happens with marijuana
And we see it all the time, you know, there's card rings on every dispenser, right?
Yeah, exactly
Well, government mandated
Well, that's normalcy, right?
So I think it's just, you know, and they're used to weed out there
It's not like you're not used to it
But having it in the forefront now is
Like, now we can be like, hey, now we're weeding
That's the thing that's so good
That some of these spaces where it's been like these people that have been the righteous activators
You know, on cannabis, you know, like they're against it
And it's always been on their rule
And then everybody's had to be quiet and keep their eyes closed
Keep everything closed in and keep themselves quiet, right?
And now that they don't have to at all
It's like, oh, well, I'm here
And for some people, that's just a mess
So what was it where you like involved yourself in weeding out there to help kind of deal with that?
Well, we had to do some community engagement
And then we did that and some of that went well and some of it didn't go well
Because there was a lot of people that did approach me after those engagements
And say, hey, you know, we support you, we want to get you stuck here
We've been doing hemp fields in Lumbee
So we employed people in Lumbee to do our harvest and help with us out there
So we do know the people that want us to succeed
And we do know the people that want to work with us
So, you know, and there's opportunities for every farmer in that area, especially on the hemp side
We do a lot of hemp too
To potentially start getting people more used to cannabinoids as the preferred medicine
Not even an alternative
Yeah, well, I see a great pool of cannabinoids for everybody
You know, that's going to be an interesting space for science
I was chatting with a guy at the conference in May with a few people in general
Because they're like, I think ultimately when you're looking for medical, growing into medicine
You'll see like the bioreactors of bacteria
Or go individual cannabinoids based on that
But, you know, it'll go one of two ways
Because there'll be a whole holistic market that will also be realized
It's brilliant, it's going to be a lot of fun to see what comes out of it
I've been wondering, is anybody really doing a hybrid fiber seed in the Okinawa?
So people are doing things here and there
And then there's a bunch of different groups that are saying, hey, we might be able to utilize them for this
I know there's some even folks with even with BC Craft Farmers, for example
There's folks that are exploring the hemp creek and different degrees of products that you can make out of hemp fiber
We've researched that from even an energy perspective
So like if, for example, we put hemp in our field
Then that hemp, the fibers would then be used in the winter when we needed fuel to then light up our grove
Yeah, OK, OK, cool
So you'd like to do a biomass?
Not like a biomass, yeah
Yeah, you can use a biomass. It's a boiler, essentially
In Italy, they do this thing where you have all of your olives and they come off the trees
And you then go through and get all the preps through
You actually can collect the byproduct, all the preps, all of them
And you use that as the heat generator for your house
It's a very, very typical thing. People actually go out and buy bags of it
Because it's just like really cheap, readily available
And that's how you heat, that's how you boil the water for your home
Yeah, well, if you can look at it
Wood is always like high in terms of joules that's produced when it's combusted, right?
Yeah
But hemp fiber and hemp stock is not that far off
OK
It's not that far off
I think it's in the magnitude of maybe 20% less energy or 25% less energy
I could be wrong, don't quote me
I have papers that actually show
We would sew up
It's actually pretty efficient
I think it's around 25%
25%? That's pretty good
So there are so many applications
And we're just talking about hemp, right?
Imagine we just talked about marijuana
And marijuana as not only the preferred recreational, social thing to do
But also it has all these medical applications
And we develop a whole market for it
Which we do have potential to do
Why are we holding back here in Canada?
That's the biggest jump, right?
Well, I think we've also
The way that they've also done the system is
They've managed to lock out a lot of people that were part of the movement
Like we have
There's two things that I see that's happening on the legal marketplaces
Everybody wants hot California strength
Well, it was good
Now we're going to get into big
But that's the problem, right?
But we have Pixar and then more
We have Romulan
We have some amazing readers
And some amazing craft cannabis that's been growing here for so fucking long
And what goes on the market is big questions
It's just like, what's happening?
So we need to do a better job here in BC of getting together
And sharing of information
Sharing the strengths to build really high-end genetics
Not like we don't have it
But we need to put it out
Keep it at the forefront
And have people recognize
And get the story out
People know about Texas Outback Market
It's like there's a fucking island
There's like
So what should the story be?
There's a cove on Vancouver Island
Where the water grows the best
And if you start your mothers there
You can take them back to their property, right?
There you go, right?
Or high in the mountains
Exactly
There are some interesting growth efforts
I didn't understand until the business conference
About how to work
It's like a lot of people do it
So this outdoor, like you've seen earlier today
That's the type of outdoor you do
You select a few
You target what you're doing
You know what you're doing
I don't know if these outdoor fields
Especially with global warming
And the ever-changing climate that we're getting right now
That we can predict
Because cannabis, especially the market in Canada
It's a very richer market, right?
So we know really good, great cannabis
Versus stuff that's like, you know
There's a lot more heads, for sure
Exactly
Definitely a lot more
And then even being able to control that crop
Make sure, like for example
Did they say, hey, you know
If you're just growing out there
You can just select those extracts
So what do we do?
But what if you had a medical deal
That required it to be a certain GMP certification?
Right?
And then you had an infestation in your field
And it was half the field
Then technically you've lost half of your crop for your client
Right?
So I think smaller gardens are nice
Outdoor
Breeding is amazing after we breed outdoor
Yeah
Right?
I think that's important
Especially if you're going to try and grow outdoor
You've got to do the breeding outdoor
You've got to do it in the environment that you want it to grow
After you want it to develop those good pathways
And those good strains
But then, so
I mean, you're part of it
You've been part of the industry since 2001
I've been in the legacy market for a very long time
Yeah, I went Doe View into it
So where did the lighting come into?
When did that happen?
Or we could, before we get into that, we could have a go
Yeah, let's
Or I could start answering that
We could start prepping
Yeah, yeah
You start answering that
And I'm going to mix it with the talk
So the lighting came in
And it's very interesting
We used to have an engineer
Who used to be part of Green Ambler
He's part of our brain trust
And he was a lighting engineer
And he used to own a lighting company
Sometimes when I talk I'm moving
So I try and keep it at a fair distance
It's a unidirectional light, right?
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's my brain going
Double check, double check
Double check, double check
Sorry if I got you mixed up
So he was
We were working on original numbers on lighting
And he was telling me, here's the lighting talents
And I go, what about LED?
And he goes, yeah, it would save us money
But they're very expensive
Because at those times when we were looking at the stuff
Probably 2018
And LEDs are probably like 2000, 2000
And all blurble
Yeah, and all like, yeah, the blurble
Blurble, blurble
Now don't get me wrong
We can make a blurble setting in our light
That's all that was on the market, right?
So he said we could start exploring
And I, you know, every time I
Like we went out and found a product
I said, what about this?
And he gave me advice and gave me some direction on it
And I'm like, why don't we just make our own then?
Yeah, right?
Because these prices are really high
And if I'm sure we can probably find a manufacturer
That will go work with us
And we found a manufacturer about three years ago
And we've been working with them ever since
And now we built the product that we put on the market
And that's kind of how we got there
Because we started doing a lot of other work for other people
So people were asking if they can help us get our license
Can you help us design some stuff?
And then they were like, what about equipment?
And I'm like, okay, well, there's this on the market
And this like, well, is there stuff that can
You can play around with the spectrum or the stuff that
You know, you have a controller that you can set it, leave it
And I said, well, there's stuff like this here
And there's kind of stuff like this here
But there's not an all-in-one solution
That's kind of why we started developing it
Because we know we're building out a facility for ourselves
And we want something that works for ourselves
And your growers, and you know what we're doing
So here's our thought on a light of
If you want full control of your light quality
That's kind of what you want to know and what you want to do
So we kind of got passionate about lighting
And we kind of figured it out
We brought it to a point where it's now
We think it's a good product for the market
It's like a running theme on the show
It's like, tell your story?
No, definitely, but it's like
I tend to pull people on that were like, well, nobody's doing this
And I want it, so I'm going to fucking do it
There's a gap in the market
There's a gap in the market, you have to fill it
And if you happen to make some money by filling it, then hey
Wonderful, wonderful
But it's like, hey
The ultimate goal is I want this
Like we had Trevor Ball on
Trevor on, and he does this beauty blog
He's like, I want to smoke out of that, I'm going to do it
It's like that type of thing
Well, that is in there, not like, hey, let's fucking settle with half-half
Trevor had a nice mountain
That was a very, that was a nice mountain
I got a good picture of that
Well, that's over here
But so Trevor, like
He's one of those people, like yourself
He's like, you know what, I want this
I'm going to do it, and there are people that do that
There are people that go, oh well, you know what
I can't quite get there
I can't quite do that myself
So I'm not going to bother
And that's kind of a running theme
That people that decided to go, hey, you know what
It's not where I want it, let's make it, let's get it there
Yeah, and I know some people don't care about that
And I can appreciate that because some people are like
Hey, as long as what I'm doing works
That's all that matters
I find that understanding the processes
Especially from a science perspective
On what you're doing
Helps you then to understand
The bigger picture of everything else that you need to do
Especially when it comes to cultivation
Right? Yeah
So when we were looking at light
And like, what really matters with light
Is it about watts?
No, it's not about watts, it's about how many photons
You can deliver onto your plants
Right? Exactly
It's not about, I've always loved the LED
Lots of people
But LEDs by nature
Are basically more efficient
Right? Yeah
And let's be honest, right
They're a little bit different
Because they're targeted little diodes
Of light, emitting light
Versus one big light source like a bulb
Right?
And you've got to grow under them a little bit differently
Oh yeah, for sure
But there's so many, because of the
Lower heat capacity
Like triple stack
Tents, like just do little plants
That are just like this tall
And do three floors of LED lighting
And then just flower the whole thing up
And run it, run it
And you can like, because if you do a flat
Canopy in a 4x4 space
Right? You can pull
Right? Like that's kind of, you can pull
More than that if you really
Know what you're doing, but on average
Your basic person without a lot of work
Can pull a town out of a 4x4 space
So they could, they were pulling
Three towns out of a 4x4 space
Guaranteed every time they did a triple stack
Because they did verticals
Yeah, exactly, but you could
Imagine trying to do that with bulbs
You burn your roots
On the bottom
Yeah, so yeah, I think from that perspective
All of these are great
Right? Well, especially
They put up
Very little, like don't get me wrong
You know, you're running them 12, 18 hours a day
You're not going to have heat, especially if you have a room full of LEDs
Sure
But you know, there's certain things
That you have to learn with LEDs
And once you learn them, it's like, hey, this is not that bad
I've still threw up a coat here
Of some of the Syrah
And I've sprinkled some cotton candy in
Cotton candy was courtesy
Of Candy Bird
From BC Craft Co-op
In the shadows
And as usual
I make everybody do it through my
You know, get right in the situation
Yeah, there it is
Oxygen? Why would I need oxygen?
You don't need to breathe
I thought, well, let's do it
That cotton candy comes through pretty nice on that
It's a bit harsh
I put a lot in there
I'm not going to lie
I've made it very, very soft
I think it's resin, it's not rosin
It's definitely resin
That's the difference between solid and solid
Yeah
I've started
To get away from the
Solvents
I used to really like the solvents
With the extracts
I started solvents, extracting solvents
And
That was
That was there
All my friends were blasting butane
I was growing up
I was sold
I bought a vac oven
A pretty large vac oven
And I used to vent it out
My apartment
And I had it grounded to you and everything
Along with everything else that was blasting in my apartment
But that's when you just
Started learning
I'm like, whoa
You can make this concentrate
This is so nice
And then when you learn, hey
Wow
Really nice stuff
But
You know what, I've recently
Just started following up with resin and rosin
And all this stuff
Because I knew it was good
And I knew there was this
I've made a clear effort in my life
To focus on vaporizing
And make sure I'm consuming and not combusting
Like getting the flavor profile
And I've been doing that
And I've recently gotten to
Really try some amazing stuff
And also get to try it in
Systems where it wasn't like a
Fucking screen hot nail
Where you're burning the crap out of it
You're hurting your lungs
You're hitting it so hard
You know what I mean?
This is a pen
It's so perfect for controlling your dose
Right?
And controlling your heat too
It's very discreet
It's very discreet
And if you keep it clean
You can get the taste of anything you're hitting
So let's get into some of the deep stuff
I want to ask you about the lights
Because your lights are like
The Cadillac
Of light
One thing that is often missing
That you maybe see coming through
But it's often
You went from the god awful perfect
Lamp lights
To these white lighting sticks
That were just monochrome
And now there's
This new extra level
That a lot of people are introducing
That I think you're doing quite well
So do you want to talk about that part?
Well it's
About light quality I think
So
When it comes to LED the advantages
There's huge advantages
And that's easily available
So one
You can accurately dial in
Your
How much you can dim your light for example
With LED
Now you're dealing with diodes, you're dealing with PCB board
You can program that board and have that
Information put in
You can also
Look at
The intensity
And duration
In terms of the duration
And have the duration programmed in
Okay so
So now
Now
When we used to have timers
Right?
We all have a lot of timers
I have a few timers here
To say the least
Right?
And remember if the timer resets
If the timer goes out
Right?
So I had to stay home the other day
Because we got a message from the government
Saying
From the local police
And that candy is a little strong but it's good
Yeah
It's nice
Anyway
They were resetting the electrical
Grid or something like that
So they're like oh between 9 and 1 o'clock in the afternoon
The power's going to go out
I'm like oh fucking great
It's not going to be a bad day I'll take all the time
So I'm sitting there and waiting
But I'm not going to do anything
They never turned the power off
It was like I had to stay at home
For like 6 hours out of the day for no reason
And it drove me nuts
But like that's the frustration
And so you're telling me
What happens when the power goes out
So
So our unit already
Once you program it it stays with the unit
So the minute it goes out
Unless you press the manual reset button on the unit
Anytime the power goes out
It comes back on it'll remember
If it knows the lights have to be on
The lights will be back
You won't have issues like that
Not only that but you have greater control
On what you can time and how you can program
So within 24 hours you can program the light
To do
One of multitudes of things
And that's like working towards the third thing I was talking about
In terms of light quality
Is the spectrum
So
We know that different aspects
Of the visible spectrum
So for example, if you have a plant that's
700 nanometers
It delivers light photons
That drive photosynthesis
And we know that
So photosynthetic active radiation
Right
So once we know that
And we know the level that you can deliver with that
And the color
You can now start to play around with your genetics
You can start to play around with different plants
You can grow with this
This is not just about cannabis obviously
You can have different types of plants grown under this
And then you can understand
At what part of the life cycle
What kind of spectrum the plant is more receptive to
Okay
So like
Say I wanted to be
In California
Shout out to Mr. Trees
That we do a show on
On the weekends
We missed it last week but we'll have another one up soon
But
You know he's got these beautiful
Ice cream cakes, crosses
That have been grown well
And bred in the California
In the California sun
Can I try and replicate that?
You can definitely replicate that with our
Can you like
So how does that work?
So I can show you a good
I can show you a good example
So right now I have here
A spectrometer
Okay
So this spectrometer is actually pretty good too because this spectrometer
Can measure within
350 and 800 nanometers
Okay
So outside of the visible spectrum
So wavelengths that you can pick up
So we're talking about UVA probably
Up to 350
And we're talking about far-red and infrared
Up to 800
Okay
I think you have to program which one
I think this one's programmed for having UV
Okay
Yeah
So basically this is a
Spectrometer, right?
So with that you can just go out
Take a shot of what the sun's looking like
And the sun's pretty intense
As you can see that
But what you can do is mimic
Your light that can cover most of that up
Remember that the plant doesn't use all of that
Okay
But once you find out the level the plant can use
Within that spectrum
You can also mimic that spectrum
If the plant's doing well in that
This region here
Which is your UV
And this region here
Which is past 700
Which is your far-red and your infrared
But then what we can do is go into your globe
We can bring out your light
And we can basically mimic a spectrum
That looks like this
When we look at some of the experiments
That you can kind of extrapolate
Information from the studies
It's been showing that
If you use those
Far-red and infrared
With the normal wavelength
You can basically double your
Photosynthetic output in the plant
Okay
Because now you've activated PS1 and PS2
Yeah
Okay
So there isn't enough evidence right now
That shows cannabis can do that
But we are trying to do that research
We're trying to get some folks together
And actually do some research
And see if we can do that
We're trying to get some folks together
In academia
My quality assurance person, Matthew
Shout out to Matthew by the way
At NACPP
And her company and her colleagues
They also have a research office
So we're going to be trying to
Hopefully team up with somebody this fall
To do that kind of research
To look at those deeper ranges
We'd really like to do that
And take that research to the next level
Because then that then tells people
We've seen it happen
We've tested it out
We think it can happen, yes
And then you can put it in a light
And market it
Which is important
You've really got to vet some of that
Yeah, anything to get better with the light would be great
So if you can just throw in a couple of different diodes
In different nanometer ranges
And that helps the plant even grow better
Why not
Or even, and here's an extra layer
Even the bacteria
And all the bugs
So UV, right
You're getting light into the soil
That you're getting more out of
So your bacteria, I mean as much as
Light doesn't penetrate that far
There is some surface
But with UV, the other thing too
It's been shown to be very detrimental
To plants if you leave it on
Or you leave it on for a long duration
Interesting
So what's kind of the
What's the duration
Well I know guys that are
Doing very brief cycles
I know guys that are pulsing it
Because they're using lamps
So there's so many people doing things
Out there but you've got to get it on paper
Put it in some research
Test it out
And wouldn't infrequent use of UV also help with bacteria levels
That's what I've looked at
So just look at infestations of pests
Yeah
That could help with that too
Well guys do that with the filtration systems
In their HVAC
Exactly
Or there's the new systems where they
But they go hard with the UV
That's meant to kill things
Well you can walk in
And some of those things I wouldn't suggest
Ever
Even some of the really strong UV lights
That you can buy that are for cleaning
That stuff's dangerous
It's personagenic
If you would have kept it on until your skin fell off
Yeah
So with cannabis
They're learning too
That UV receptive
Cannabis were probably ones that
Were very high latitudes
Because they probably got a lot of UV
Being that high in the atmosphere
Yeah
I've actually had conversations with
A few breeders in the group
That have gone through
The appellations
And they found that even some of the lower
As the plant
As the same plant grows further and further
In elevation because they're using
The same seed
You can see a little bit of a morphology change
Due to the change in light spectrum
You know you get a thinner leaf
On the lower part of the mouth
And a thicker wider leaf on the upper part of the mouth
And then in different
Coloring as well which is epic
Right? Everybody always wants
Those colorful breed lines
Well it's the enzymes that have developed
Based on like well different factors
Yeah there's none to it
But a healthy light system
Is an important part of that
And an important part of that factor
Right?
And then when your plants all of a sudden
Start changing color and they're purple
Instead of green
And you don't get as much light spectrum into the plant
That's kind of the thing
Well the other thing that people have been talking about
Is that
That like well there's
Green too right?
That's part of the
Basically the chloroplasts
And chlorophyll
And they say well plants just absorb that a lot
But look it's still absorbing all that energy
And they're saying it doesn't really go
To contribute to photosynthesis
Yeah it reflects all of it
But you can get deep absorption
With that green and there has been
Evidence I think like there's some even
Bugby videos that show that
Yeah I've heard a lot about using
A small amount of green
I think it's being able to
Convert that energy right?
Yeah
So are there green diodes?
There are green diodes but white makes enough green
Yeah
White makes every color
But white's 400 to 700
Yeah
That middle spectrum
So when
What was
What are some key factors
We were talking a little bit at the conference
About some of the safety keys
Because often there are
Like you'll get a quantum board
And it'll have a driver
Screwed on, they'll be loosely gauged
They'll be tied on top of
And I noticed your units seem to have
A closed system and you don't see a visible diode
Yeah so ours are IP
65 right? So that's the IP
Rating that just basically says how much
Moisture
Or dust that can get
Into your unit right? So it's a good
Rating in terms of being able to
Have a damp or moist
Environment, it's not getting
Into those driver boxes, not getting into the
Wiring of your unit right?
So with those exposed drivers we don't know
Right now because we've been seeing those
That have been coming out recently
But we don't know the longevity of those units
Because we don't know the effects of high humidity
Like some of our
Environments can be right?
Or even in infrequent hits
Because I can't tell you how many times
I have to go through my space and
The space doesn't take down
Our boxes are pretty good because
We're also part of our fire unit warranty
So that IP rating
Also goes to that
Warranty
So you got a good warranty
Well the warranty is pretty good on the lights
If anything goes out on the light we just
Replace it right?
So it's a barred light, it's a 6 bar light
So if any of the bars go out we just send you a new bar
Or if the
Driver box goes out then we just send you a new driver box
And keep the bar there
That's kind of nice and functional
Right?
To be honest this light was designed
As a commercial drill
You can use this light for home hobbyists
I'm sure
We've got a lot of listeners that are like
I want a commercial drill light
And that's amazing
No but we designed this for
Basically
The commercial guy right?
We designed the spread of the lighting
It's good for overlap
If you're building them out in rows
Which most commercial rows do
Because they're great to go straight
Down the wastegate because the overlap you have between the lights
Does that make up for
The LED
Basically having diminished values
On the edge because there's less LED
Actually hitting down
And they're great for the ones
On the outside because you know
On those outside rows you don't want
As much as you want your plant to be bursting
You don't want it hanging into the middle of the aisle
As you're going to the commercial grower
You mentioned a really important point
We were chatting about it a little bit before we go
That's actually pretty cool
The LED diode and lighting
Comes to the physician
A lot more up and down vertical
They don't bow out
Down to the side as much
And you can really take advantage of that
As a grower to grow a really nice
Flat view canopy
As long as you're getting
The same consistent quality over time
Over your duration
That you can program for example with our light
Then you should be fine
If you just have a certain set of diodes
At a certain amount of time
And then that changes as the height grows
And you can't change intensity
You can't change duration at that point
You can't change the spectrum
And then you're adjusting heights to make things work
It just makes things more complicated
From a commercial perspective
If you just want the bells and whistles for home growth
This is the bells and whistles for home growth
That's the thing
There's a lot of mid-level people
A lot of practice people
That watch the show
They really like
Trying to play around with these types of things
And see how is the show
Why not?
It's one of the more popular hobbies
I think
It's definitely a cool one
I think it's a great way to get you that vibe
1% increase in quality of ganja
When you've been growing it for a number of years
Is a nominal increase
In quality
And anytime you get the opportunity
To add a little bit more control
And a little bit more fun into your life
It's always good
It is
We got some guys that have given it out
Or they've bought it for us
And they love them
They love the control
They love the ability to do these things
Because now they keep notes
That they basically changed the soil on this day
And added this on this day
So they keep diligent notes
And cross-reference it
That's how we design this
Virtual situation
So you've got a little calendar
That pops up on your system?
What we can do
Is the programming language
That we built our system on
Can be interchanged with almost any
Major programming language
Used by any controller system
It's very basic
So it's very easy
So we can output data
Say you are one of those people that love the notes
We can output data
We do this custom for some of the LPs
That we work with
And then we build out what they want to have
Outputted from the light
We can output all the data
That we have
And then we send it to the light
Which is basically any signal that we send to the light
We tell the light at 2 o'clock
We want it to go to 100% red
0% blue
And 100% white
It will do that
But then at that time it will record that
It will send it to a unit that records that information
And then you'll be able to keep that track
Through whatever system
Yeah
You'll be able to
You can keep it
We've been working with some of the
ERP systems out there
So the seat to seat tracking
We've talked to a few people out there
And we've been working with them to say
What if we dump this data
And correlate it to the batch record
That you have
And then that batch record is correlated to a sales number
And then that sales number
Is then we did a really good job
We hit 27%
What did we do right environmentally
The lighting did this
Our soil sensors were saying this
This is how much loading we gave
In terms of newts
So when you fuck with this system
You get to track what you fuck with
We're just part of big agribusiness
We're a subsection of that
For cannabis
And that's what we've been focusing on
That's that gap in the market you talked about
There's not enough data
We need more data from cannabis guys
That want to do this
And some of them are
Like forever
Dude it's legal now
You can build a business
And pass it on to your kids
That can be multi-generational
And you can support
I love the community
And get to know the most amazing fans
And followers
These last two events
Have been pretty good
In terms of not only the turn up
But the quality of cannabis people
Yeah
There's a lot of good stuff going on
In BC
And in Canada in general
I hear a lot of people
From the prairies
That I was not expecting
I was like are you from the mainland or Vancouver
And they're like I'm from the prairies
I'm like okay
A couple people from out east
From the maritimes are out there
And a couple people from Toronto are definitely out there
And a lot of people from BC were there
I've seen people there
I've been to one scene
And I had about two or three years in the cannabis business
It's nice
There was a lot of good stuff
I got to hang out with Ed
I gave him one of our
Tiny poke puzzle boxes
And we were at Jim Belushi's
And we got a nice photo
With him and then Jim Belushi
We shared it with Seth
Jim Belushi was such an actor that day
He came out
He did the talk
He was like a total comedian actor
A comic actor
Everybody was laughing it up
They were taking their pictures
And then they had him at the reception
After it
And they had him taking pictures the whole time
Yeah, the poor guy had to
It's like
I hope he's high and I hope he's well paid
That's what I was saying
You know what the best part was?
The first person to light up a doobie on the rooftop patio
Of the Sticky Wicket in Victoria
It was Ed Rolvinsall
That was the most epic thing
We're standing in the middle like nobody's smoked weed yet
Everybody's worried about it
Can we do it yet?
You're not allowed to smoke weed
On a rooftop restaurant in Vancouver
You're not
It's illegal
Or your restaurant's gonna fine
Or there could be some problems
But there's fucking Ed
The oldest guy in the room
Rolling up
And he's got a big
Honking big doobie
Lights it right up there
I'm like fuck this
Big shout out to the Grow Up folks
And Randy Rota over there
That was an amazing conference
They put on a lot of good talkers
A lot of good speakers
Was there a favourite speaker?
I didn't get to see a lot
I would hear it from everybody
Who spoke there?
That's definitely who you want to see
It was a hard run
The Smoking Lounge was killing it
To think that you would be at the Empress Hotel
In Victoria
At a big cannabis conference
Smoking on a private patio
We paid for that private patio
Yeah I know they paid for it
But it's the fucking Empress
Cannabis is legal
So the Empress is on board
Exactly
I've noticed in the last two events
The Empress is on board
And Kelowna is on board
The other Roto in Kelowna did an amazing job
Letting us be high
The whole time
They want people to go
Hey I want to go to Vancouver or Victoria
Or Kelowna to smoke weed
And check out farms
Because they're about letting people smoke weed
And weed's okay
Yeah weed's okay in Kelowna
It's very okay in Kelowna
It's because it created
Like you yourself
You have a small business
How many people do you employ?
So we only employ maybe like
Three or four people
We contract a lot of people
So we do a lot of contracts
So right now we employ
Probably at least
Seven people on our property
Eight people on our property
Okay which is awesome
So you're helping the community
Which is almost a little bit better
Because now you're
You've got a small staff
That are on full time
But then you're doing contract work
So you're helping other small businesses grow and develop
Oh for sure we employ a lot of businesses
Excellent
That's why these communities I think open up
Because now all of a sudden we're bringing this money in
We're helping to supply
Community
Oh yeah these guys love it
They ask me what should I buy
And I'm like yeah okay no problem
Was there something that you got to try out
While at the conference that was like
This was special
This was something
Yeah I was a buddy of mine he's locally in Kelowna
I know him I haven't seen him in a while
And I saw him there and he goes hey I'm working
He's working with Marcus
Oh really?
And I saw him and I'm like
Hey I need someone
I'm interested in being the processor
And he's like okay I'd be interested
Really good
It blew me away
I didn't know you were doing this
But I just started a couple years ago
And I'm like wow
They're standing up
I think it's a facility
My understanding is that
Who?
Marcus
I have no idea
There's always something being set up somewhere
I was talking to somebody
And I haven't seen him in a while
And I'm like I'm pouring concrete
This year
Four years ago we've been
You know
High hopes and big dreams
But you know what the good thing that's happened
In this market we've kind of hit cannabis 3.0
Now we've kind of realized
Hey we've got a band together
A lot of people want to work together now
Let's work together
Let's work to make a better product
So we start with our light here for example
That's what we say
If you want to do this level of detail
That's what you can get
Exactly
Let's go all the way with the detail
Not only that if you're highly detailed
And say hey I need this
Rather than what you have
We can do something custom for you
We get the full spectrum
We get the crazy passionate home growers
The type of guys that would get stuff like this
And you know the large facilities
The large people that you can set up
One of the things that's interesting
I would love to know
If you've got a lot of sales
If you've seen a lot of interest in this
It's like that greenhouses
In BC
In the Philomene
The region
With supplemental additional lighting
Because naturally we get shitty weather
We are like a terrible climate place
When it comes down to it
When it comes to growing cannabis
We were talking earlier
You know how you can find a good genetic in BC
In BC
In the Pacific Northwest
The ones that don't mold
The ones that don't mold
Or are PMed out
The ones that aren't susceptible
I've been in BC
Four years now
I've seen a lot of stuff that happens
In the summer
Right now we had a wet
We had a really wet
Beginning of the summer
Now are we going to have it drier
It's nicer
But at the same time
When it gets really dry
The fires come back
Now we don't have sunlight
It's smoky everywhere
It's a good thing
With the greenhouses
You can use our light
We have different configurations
You won't take up as much space
In terms of blocking out light
You can also at the same time
Orient it so it's going to be in line
With the area that's already in a blackout
So you align it with those things
Or even have the layout for your facility
So the shadow doesn't
Give you much of an issue
Because these actually give you more coverage
Area in terms of light
So you can put them a little bit higher
And they'll give you a lot of coverage
It'll give you a lot of the same kind of energy
That you would see in terms of a spectrum
From the sun
You don't get that crazy sun power
Because again
That thing is
We'll get a picture of that
And pop that up there
In BC here we're trying them out
In a few greenhouses right now
We're going to see how those effects are going to look like
So when we're setting up this thing
And we'll get into this in a little bit more detail
How do we know that
How do you set California's spectrum?
So you'd have to find
A spectrum for California
And see what it would look like
And then you could basically
Use the same device that we have
And basically
Tune it
When we set up LPs we come in and we tune it
You tell me what you want me to tune it to
You tell me what kind of program you want us to program it to
And we'll pre-program it for you
Or we'll just give you our recommendation
And give you suggestions
And give you suggestions to say
Typically start with this
And then start playing around from this point on
Everybody knows that I'm like that
I'm that guy that's like
Instead of a 4x4 bed
Let's try and do the same thing
In a 3 gallon pot
And then the weirdo that tries to do that
So I'm like I'll probably try and figure out a setting
And share it with everybody
Well there's different things that you can do
I know lots of guys they'll put UV on the side
And they'll have a T5 in the middle here
They'll do some crazy things
Like look what we got
And I'm like
Well that's interesting I wonder how that happened
And they're like
I don't know either because
Here's some hypotheses why it would happen
But there's so many different factors
When it comes to genetics
You don't know what plant he started with
And at what stage it was
Or how many generations it was in
And how it was trained
Because those are big factors
Huge factors
And then you want to retrain the plant
Because if you had HPS for example
You'd have a single source
That then comes down
And it's kind of like the sun
Versus now you have an LED
Which is a bunch of laser beams
That are now hitting you
So a plant's going to do different things
Especially in its chloroplast
To try and get to that light
It's going to grow differently
It's going to develop differently
And you can see that when you take plants out
I want to shout out to Mark
Who won the contest
For the free ticket
Which is awesome
He had just an awesome time
He thanks us both for that
Did you see his old copy
Of Ed Rosen's book
Oh his Bible?
He had the
Cannabis hand growers book
The marijuana hand growers book
But he had the first copy
That he released with Robert Clark
And he went there and showed it to Ed
And got Ed to sign it
It was just epic
So it was so fun for that to happen
So Ed is a plant that
Has been passed down from his mother
And I mean asexually
But cut by clone
And cut over and over again
For 20 years
And his thing that he says
Is every year he takes it and puts it outside
And he allows the sun to heal it
So this is the key thing about genetics
Now if you're talking about genetics
I've got a breeder
And my breeder
He's amazing
He's taught me a lot in the last couple years
About breeding
And he keeps saying
The thing about all these hybrids right now
Is none of them are stable
They're just fucking shit
They're trash
They don't have any generational lineage to them
They don't have any resistance to PM for example
And they fail quick
Because people think
The minute they get their cross
Oh my god I hit 30%
On their first or second round
Of clone cuttings
And then you run it 10 more times
And you've had it for 4 or 5 years
And it's like exploding
Bananas in the hardest fucking spot
And it's like you don't know what to do
And it's like
But that's how it is
That's what we talk about
Long term bio stability
When it comes to cannabis
That's what we mean by it
Not just hey I'm going to plant a plant
And I'm going to be able to keep it for 5 or 10
And it's going to still survive
He's got a 20 year old plant
That's a crazy plant
Yeah that's a crazy plant
You can keep it genetic for 20 years
And you're going to have it still bigger
Yeah of course
Then there's the tissue cultures
And everybody's saying that
And I say this guy's got a good
I mean I got to smoke weed and he's got a good dog
He's got a good system right
There's nothing wrong with keeping a genetic plant
In a backyard
That's all it takes
That's all it really takes to do
And that's where those stories come from
Well you know we breed on the side of a mountain
Right
So
Do you use the old grape methodology
Where you plant with the aspect of the sun
So that you have the south bearing
So my
Breeder does all the planting
It's his garden right
But he's got it sun facing
And it gets a lot of air
So it's a nice spot where the trees are
And it gets it nice
It's pretty good
That's sick
Hey well I hope you enjoyed that episode
Of garden journeys as it were
We were joined by
Jonathan Fernandez of Green Amber Canada
We had an awesome time
Setting up our brand new light
I was excited to announce him as our very first sponsor
