[00:00.000 --> 00:19.780]  We are here doing the Dragonfly Earth Medicine panel.
[00:19.780 --> 00:24.420]  These are breeders I kind of announced earlier but I've got to go over it again.
[00:24.420 --> 00:25.660]  We've got Jesse BioVortex.
[00:25.660 --> 00:30.300]  He's also a producer of a movie that's coming out called Tending the Garden.
[00:30.300 --> 00:32.500]  He's also an incredible breeder.
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.500]  He's been working things.
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.100]  He does a lot of breeding on the coast.
[00:35.100 --> 00:39.340]  So if you are looking for that mold resistant stuff, this is the man.
[00:39.340 --> 00:41.020]  He's been doing some amazing stuff.
[00:41.020 --> 00:46.980]  I've been working with his genetics for years and I can't talk highly enough about them.
[00:46.980 --> 00:49.300]  We've got Forrest from Sun Roots.
[00:49.300 --> 00:51.900]  Covolo, you know.
[00:51.900 --> 00:54.300]  We all know Covolo.
[00:54.300 --> 00:55.580]  Big plants.
[00:55.580 --> 00:56.580]  Big plants.
[00:56.580 --> 00:59.580]  If you guys want big plants, these are the people that work on that.
[00:59.580 --> 01:02.860]  But you have to grow me Covolo in the water.
[01:02.860 --> 01:04.260]  I think it does help.
[01:04.260 --> 01:05.260]  It does help.
[01:05.780 --> 01:07.900]  And then we've got Zelly from Spring Creek.
[01:07.900 --> 01:13.420]  You've got to check out what he does.
[01:13.420 --> 01:20.340]  I mean the man obviously works really, really hard and much respect to just the tenacity
[01:20.340 --> 01:26.180]  and the pursuit of farming and challenging mountain hillsides and stuff and working with
[01:26.180 --> 01:27.180]  it.
[01:27.180 --> 01:28.180]  So yeah.
[01:28.180 --> 01:30.180]  And then Daniel from Heart Rock Mountain.
[01:30.820 --> 01:40.780]  Daniel is the family guy that you want to bring your kids to hang out with.
[01:40.780 --> 01:43.900]  And so he's a true breeder.
[01:43.900 --> 01:48.220]  He's good at making kids and he's good at making seeds and he makes a lot of them.
[01:48.220 --> 01:55.260]  So people that want the auto flower or some CBD, this guy's got kind of the range.
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.260]  Look into it.
[01:56.260 --> 01:57.740]  And then we've got Moon Gazer.
[01:57.740 --> 01:59.740]  We've got Josh over here.
[01:59.740 --> 02:06.900]  You know, I met Josh a long time ago at this point, which is kind of a trip because it
[02:06.900 --> 02:09.180]  doesn't, it's just like time has gotten weird.
[02:09.180 --> 02:15.700]  But it's been really cool watching somebody like you guys came to our farm way back in
[02:15.700 --> 02:19.220]  the day before you had a farm and before you started yours.
[02:19.220 --> 02:24.500]  And so, you know, I got to kind of watch that process unfold via Instagram mostly.
[02:24.500 --> 02:26.540]  But also I've been able to visit that farm.
[02:27.060 --> 02:28.260]  It's been just magical.
[02:28.260 --> 02:29.740]  They've got twins.
[02:29.740 --> 02:35.300]  You know, we all, you know, the whole kid thing changes your world.
[02:35.300 --> 02:38.980]  So yeah.
[02:38.980 --> 02:40.740]  So yeah, that's who's up here.
[02:40.740 --> 02:47.620]  I do have a piece of paper and I was trying to be somewhat organized.
[02:47.620 --> 02:50.460]  I like to look like I am.
[02:52.860 --> 02:56.420]  But basically what I'm going to do is just kind of bring up some topics in relation to
[02:56.500 --> 03:00.780]  breeding and genetics and let these people kind of share with you their thoughts on what
[03:00.780 --> 03:01.780]  I'm asking.
[03:01.780 --> 03:02.780]  So prepare.
[03:02.780 --> 03:03.780]  Demp here.
[03:03.780 --> 03:08.900]  So I just got a shout out to Josh and Kelly.
[03:08.900 --> 03:15.220]  You know, they really have spearheaded a large network of community that has really, you
[03:15.220 --> 03:18.660]  know, they're really doing good stuff.
[03:18.660 --> 03:24.140]  Like they're up in Canada, kind of stuck there.
[03:24.140 --> 03:29.300]  And that's so good, you know, because they get to really work on their space and but
[03:29.300 --> 03:31.340]  they bring bring a lot of inspiration.
[03:31.340 --> 03:36.300]  And so this is a Demp here panel and we're all a part of that family.
[03:36.300 --> 03:42.100]  And we've all been sharing genetics and working with genetics for some time now.
[03:42.100 --> 03:43.980]  So thanks.
[03:43.980 --> 03:49.700]  Thanks everybody who put this on, you know, Tamara and Joey making this kind of thing
[03:49.700 --> 03:50.700]  happen.
[03:51.260 --> 03:57.220]  To me, this is like this is like the true future of all this.
[03:57.220 --> 04:01.860]  It's like going back in time, you know, it's like, let's make this happen like it once
[04:01.860 --> 04:06.020]  did again, regardless.
[04:06.020 --> 04:08.060]  And I feel like it's a timeless act.
[04:08.060 --> 04:13.580]  So, you know, we gather, we share seeds, we work, we get to be around the people who have
[04:13.580 --> 04:16.540]  put a lot of time and energy into their seeds.
[04:16.660 --> 04:22.060]  And that needs to keep happening in our in our planet in order for us to really fully
[04:22.060 --> 04:28.380]  awaken into this next coming age, which is the age of golden light.
[04:28.380 --> 04:32.100]  And you know, that age of golden light and consciousness is real.
[04:32.100 --> 04:37.380]  So, you know, I just want people to I've been trying to give people as many people some
[04:37.380 --> 04:42.460]  of that weed that I grew just a smoke during the time while we're all listening so we can
[04:42.460 --> 04:45.820]  receive that energy.
[04:45.860 --> 04:47.660]  So let's get let's get into it.
[04:49.780 --> 04:54.100]  I'm going to I'm going to let each one of the breeders here just kind of talk about
[04:54.100 --> 04:55.380]  themselves a little bit.
[04:56.900 --> 04:59.140]  And I want you to just kind of introduce yourself.
[04:59.940 --> 05:09.900]  But I want I want to know your relationship to the breeding and to genetics and what
[05:09.900 --> 05:14.380]  inspires you and what has inspired you in in that realm.
[05:15.300 --> 05:19.100]  And where it kind of started and and I know it can get long winded, so let's just keep
[05:19.100 --> 05:23.620]  track of time. But just try to pick out some nuggets of things that have really helped
[05:23.620 --> 05:25.740]  guide you further into the process.
[05:26.500 --> 05:31.980]  So let's start maybe on one end and work down the line just for easy sake.
[05:32.860 --> 05:36.180]  So, Jesse, what's the inspiration?
[05:37.020 --> 05:38.860]  Come up or do you move in the microphone?
[05:38.940 --> 05:40.380]  Let's do that. Oh, well.
[05:41.180 --> 05:44.580]  I stand and deliver.
[05:49.340 --> 05:51.660]  We're here for Nick. That was freaking amazing.
[05:51.660 --> 05:54.260]  Like it's a real shit.
[05:55.660 --> 06:00.620]  Mix a little stand up comedy and like brought everyone in and all of the seeds and those
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.980]  seeds will do a lot of stuff.
[06:02.300 --> 06:07.020]  It makes me think of the original Living Soil Symposium and the seeds that went out
[06:07.020 --> 06:12.620]  there and like seeing that stuff today still in all the different ways that it's been
[06:12.620 --> 06:18.620]  worked on. So I think it's real beautiful that the sharing of seeds and the way that
[06:18.620 --> 06:25.260]  we it brings us together and we get to like exchange a relation around a relationship
[06:25.260 --> 06:27.100]  with nature, observing a plant.
[06:27.620 --> 06:34.380]  And I think from the moment I first like found cannabis seeds and weed, like I was
[06:34.380 --> 06:39.500]  immediately fascinated, immediately grew them, brought them out in the woods, fascinated
[06:39.500 --> 06:40.860]  about the plant in every way.
[06:40.860 --> 06:46.060]  And then that made me fascinated about nature in every way and science and art and
[06:46.860 --> 06:51.100]  mutualistic relationships, all the ways that those work and how those actually can apply
[06:51.100 --> 06:56.060]  to everything in nature, but also everything in our own constructs.
[06:56.060 --> 07:01.980]  And that's the way we should be working for economy and for the way that we interact in
[07:01.980 --> 07:06.700]  business and friends and events like this, I think, are an amazing example of that
[07:06.700 --> 07:09.900]  potential. So, yeah, let's hear it for this event.
[07:09.900 --> 07:16.140]  Thank you guys. Really special because this is what it was and it's yeah, feels good.
[07:16.140 --> 07:17.500]  The weather blessed us.
[07:18.780 --> 07:23.980]  Yeah, it just this is the type of exchange, this type of thing we've been hungry for very
[07:23.980 --> 07:25.820]  much the last two years for sure.
[07:26.220 --> 07:30.940]  But honestly, before those two years, it already kind of got fucked and we didn't even have
[07:30.940 --> 07:32.700]  shit like this before covid.
[07:32.700 --> 07:38.860]  So I don't know, it's definitely a very cathartic feeling to just be here and experience all
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.980]  this with you and celebrate the plants and friendship and community.
[07:46.860 --> 07:55.180]  I started a project called BioVortex a while ago around the idea of influencing cannabis
[07:55.180 --> 07:59.820]  industry in a more environmentally thoughtful direction and mutualism in general, in the
[07:59.820 --> 08:02.140]  way that we interact with each other.
[08:02.140 --> 08:04.380]  And the breeding has been part of that.
[08:04.380 --> 08:10.940]  But so has the social media, as the photography, the art projects, the movie projects that
[08:10.940 --> 08:13.340]  we're doing now, all kinds of different aspects.
[08:13.340 --> 08:17.500]  And then the talks and events, the Regenerative Cannabis Farm Award at the Emerald Cup and
[08:17.500 --> 08:23.180]  being able to have an award ceremony also talk about the practices and the farms and
[08:23.180 --> 08:27.340]  getting to know the farms in that level and being able to do the Rage Lounge and do all
[08:27.340 --> 08:31.740]  the different talks that got to connect cannabis community to the practices that mattered.
[08:31.740 --> 08:37.660]  And that also built this kind of amazing family, like everyone right here, just very special
[08:37.660 --> 08:37.900]  people.
[08:37.900 --> 08:43.020]  And we've got to grow each other's genetics, visit each other's gardens, share in each
[08:43.020 --> 08:47.260]  other's families and food and watch each other's children grow up.
[08:47.260 --> 08:51.180]  And it's special stuff, you know.
[08:51.740 --> 08:55.660]  And yeah, I'll let it go to the next person.
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.660]  But I'm very thankful for this moment and all of you.
[08:57.660 --> 09:08.310]  Hey, I'm Forrest from Sunroots Farm up in Povolo.
[09:08.310 --> 09:13.270]  And everything what Jesse just said, like bring this all together, really feels like
[09:13.270 --> 09:15.110]  the right thing to do right now.
[09:15.110 --> 09:19.750]  You know, it's like we need this more than ever to be able to come and just show each
[09:19.750 --> 09:22.870]  other what we're doing, what we still love to do.
[09:22.950 --> 09:26.150]  And it just feels like a good thing to be doing.
[09:26.150 --> 09:36.710]  Like, I started growing when I was at a young age and I always was drawn to, you know, the
[09:36.710 --> 09:43.430]  color and the weed and like the connection to farming and, you know, just being out in
[09:43.430 --> 09:44.150]  the garden.
[09:44.150 --> 09:50.870]  And it's really been like a journey through life, just doing what I love and like sharing
[09:51.430 --> 10:02.230]  each step and, you know, just keep expanding the awareness of good, conscious gardening
[10:02.230 --> 10:06.630]  and bringing the skills to the table to show people.
[10:06.630 --> 10:10.390]  And I like to grow big plants, obviously.
[10:10.390 --> 10:11.430]  You guys have probably heard.
[10:11.430 --> 10:15.350]  We do a lot of our own genetics.
[10:15.350 --> 10:19.670]  We've done our own genetics for a long time.
[10:20.310 --> 10:22.630]  My family has been breeding.
[10:23.270 --> 10:31.910]  My brother crossed the jaw of goo and we've just been kind of going off, you know, the
[10:31.910 --> 10:32.870]  goo line, really.
[10:33.510 --> 10:37.350]  And, you know, breeding this and that into it.
[10:37.350 --> 10:42.310]  And it's really been a pretty awesome thing to be doing.
[10:42.310 --> 10:43.510]  And it feels good.
[10:43.510 --> 10:50.550]  So thank you for being, letting us be up here and showing you what we do best at.
[10:59.420 --> 11:01.260]  Yo, what's up, everybody?
[11:01.980 --> 11:03.020]  Nice to see you all.
[11:03.820 --> 11:09.660]  I'm Zelig, Spring Creek Farm, Sonoma County, Cazadero.
[11:10.540 --> 11:17.980]  We've been doing no-till light-depth for, you know, 18, 19, 20 years or so.
[11:18.620 --> 11:20.620]  Before we knew what we were really doing.
[11:21.260 --> 11:28.620]  So, you know, it's really nice to be here with everybody and, you know, experience,
[11:28.620 --> 11:30.140]  you know, this seed swap.
[11:30.140 --> 11:36.860]  And, you know, just really thankful to, you know, know you all and just, you know, just
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.660]  smoke weed.
[11:37.660 --> 11:40.780]  I just smoked a bunch of hash, so I'm fucking baked.
[11:41.660 --> 11:44.060]  So yeah, hitting the old hash pipe.
[11:44.860 --> 11:47.100]  But yeah, no, this is what we all really need.
[11:48.060 --> 11:52.860]  We all know what's going on in the industry and, you know, it is what it is.
[11:52.860 --> 11:59.660]  The plant is kind of in control of this whole paradigm, you know, it's not about money or
[11:59.660 --> 12:00.140]  anything.
[12:00.140 --> 12:06.860]  It's really just about the plant, you know, and so there's a lot going on.
[12:06.860 --> 12:12.060]  And, you know, I think that as long as we, you know, obviously it's bringing us together
[12:12.060 --> 12:17.420]  as much as, you know, I think we can all say that maybe we feel a little bit detached,
[12:17.420 --> 12:19.740]  you know, honestly, because I know I do.
[12:21.500 --> 12:25.420]  I am right here with everybody, you know, but at the same time, I feel I don't know
[12:25.420 --> 12:29.260]  if it was just me, but I feel like there's this detachment going on.
[12:29.260 --> 12:35.180]  And so by all of us coming together, it's really crucial, you know, especially right
[12:35.180 --> 12:37.180]  now, because I know we're all feeling it.
[12:37.180 --> 12:38.140]  I know I'm feeling it.
[12:38.140 --> 12:39.820]  I know everybody else is feeling it.
[12:39.820 --> 12:43.180]  So just really thankful that we're all showing up for each other.
[12:44.540 --> 12:49.900]  You know, you know, just like you're all my favorite people in the world right here, you
[12:49.900 --> 12:55.180]  know, I just love you all and just been doing my thing up on the hill.
[12:55.180 --> 12:57.420]  You all probably see me doing what I do.
[12:57.420 --> 12:59.020]  I, you know, I just do what I do.
[12:59.740 --> 13:00.780]  Make no claims.
[13:01.580 --> 13:03.980]  I come from no educational background.
[13:04.540 --> 13:09.740]  I'm just a practical guy who, you know, just listens to the plants and do what I'm told.
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.860]  They just tell me what to do.
[13:10.860 --> 13:12.460]  I just do what they want me to do.
[13:12.460 --> 13:13.900]  That's all I need to know.
[13:13.900 --> 13:17.660]  It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter what what you think.
[13:17.660 --> 13:23.340]  And that's kind of the whole part of my whole methodology is just the trust, you know, just
[13:23.340 --> 13:27.580]  trusting the plant, trusting the process, you know, kind of like an onion.
[13:27.580 --> 13:29.100]  You're just peeling back the layers.
[13:29.100 --> 13:34.460]  The more you peel back the layers, the more you trust it and the more the more is revealed
[13:34.460 --> 13:35.180]  over time.
[13:35.180 --> 13:39.500]  So I think that's just the, you know, because like there's a lot of, you know, there's like
[13:39.500 --> 13:44.300]  the the bro science that people like the science world is like, oh, if you don't test stuff,
[13:44.300 --> 13:46.860]  you're a bro science, you know, like, you know what I mean?
[13:46.860 --> 13:51.740]  That's like if you don't test something, you're automatically, you know, like you don't know
[13:51.740 --> 13:52.540]  what's going on.
[13:52.540 --> 13:57.100]  Like you don't need to know because if you're following the methodology, methodology of
[13:57.100 --> 14:02.700]  nature, nature is taking care of everything because nature is the most intelligent system
[14:02.700 --> 14:03.180]  on Earth.
[14:03.180 --> 14:06.940]  So we don't really need to know, you know, I think it's good to know.
[14:06.940 --> 14:09.020]  So you have that relationship with your soil.
[14:09.020 --> 14:14.220]  But once you get that base of your understanding and relationship with your soil, then, you
[14:14.220 --> 14:17.340]  know, you can kind of just go from there.
[14:17.340 --> 14:21.340]  And, you know, I don't know, it's just I don't know, just something I've been thinking about
[14:21.340 --> 14:25.900]  a lot, you know, just it's just like this, you know, within the industry, how, you know,
[14:25.980 --> 14:31.100]  people are, you know, just the different sides of the coin of the science side to, you know,
[14:31.100 --> 14:35.580]  like me and Nick are just like on our own little world, you know, and like, you know,
[14:35.580 --> 14:39.100]  a bunch of other, you know, farmers, we just kind of like do our thing and listen to the
[14:39.100 --> 14:44.220]  plants, do what we're told, you know, but you know, then there's the side of the coin
[14:44.220 --> 14:46.940]  where you have to test everything and it's all like that.
[14:46.940 --> 14:50.300]  And, you know, I think it's and ultimately everybody's just looking for that balance,
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.180]  you know.
[14:51.180 --> 14:53.500]  So I think it's just what we're looking for.
[14:53.500 --> 14:57.420]  Everybody's looking for balance, whatever it is, whatever you're trying to do.
[14:57.420 --> 15:00.300]  I think we're just all looking for the same thing, which is balance.
[15:00.300 --> 15:01.980]  So I don't know.
[15:01.980 --> 15:05.740]  Yeah, I've been doing my breeding project, which is just like I'm just breeding for like
[15:05.740 --> 15:15.100]  this head change that I am experiencing, which was this dog shit seeds, bag seed that I started
[15:15.100 --> 15:16.700]  just kind of a long story.
[15:16.700 --> 15:17.580]  I won't get into it all.
[15:18.220 --> 15:24.140]  But yeah, I've just been kind of which turned out to be I was breeding for a high CBGA and
[15:24.140 --> 15:30.300]  didn't know it until I started testing and then went back and went through all of my
[15:30.300 --> 15:33.740]  previous tests and I found they were all high in CBGA.
[15:33.740 --> 15:36.540]  And so I've realized that's what I was breeding for.
[15:36.540 --> 15:42.060]  So that's kind of like my breeding project is like a high CBGA breeding project, which
[15:42.060 --> 15:43.980]  is the precursor to all canbinoids.
[15:43.980 --> 15:45.900]  So, you know, it's kind of significant.
[15:46.460 --> 15:50.300]  So that's something that's cool that I've been working on.
[15:50.300 --> 15:53.260]  But yeah, just super thankful to be here.
[15:54.620 --> 15:55.820]  Yeah, I don't know.
[15:56.540 --> 15:57.260]  Just love you all.
[15:57.260 --> 15:57.820]  Give thanks.
[16:06.870 --> 16:11.590]  Okay, I'm Daniel with Heart Rock Mountain Farm, Pride of the Lion Seeds.
[16:11.590 --> 16:16.070]  And I think kind of what like Jesse was saying, cannabis was my gateway plant.
[16:17.270 --> 16:18.630]  It was the first plant I grew.
[16:19.430 --> 16:24.150]  And my older brother isn't here to confirm anymore, but he had like house plants in like
[16:24.150 --> 16:24.630]  middle school.
[16:24.630 --> 16:26.470]  He could have been growing weed then too, probably.
[16:26.470 --> 16:31.190]  But yeah, I started out growing cannabis and now I have, you know, cactuses in my greenhouse.
[16:31.190 --> 16:35.350]  You know, I'm like taking cuttings from people's houses of their house plants and I'm obsessed
[16:35.350 --> 16:35.990]  with plants.
[16:36.630 --> 16:39.990]  And so I'm thankful for that and for this community.
[16:39.990 --> 16:45.430]  And I'm second generation cannabis breeder.
[16:45.430 --> 16:49.750]  Third, if you count my Nana, who grew in Old Topanga for a long time.
[16:49.750 --> 16:52.150]  I even went down to help her harvest once in high school.
[16:52.150 --> 16:53.110]  She's like, can you help me out?
[16:53.110 --> 16:53.830]  I'm like, sure, I'll come down.
[16:53.830 --> 16:55.110]  It'll be a fun trip to LA.
[16:55.110 --> 16:57.590]  Then she had like a plant up her second story window.
[16:57.590 --> 16:58.470]  Like, okay, I see why.
[16:58.470 --> 16:59.270]  Yeah, I'll get it.
[17:01.030 --> 17:05.350]  And you know, one of my favorite stories from my dad, he was saving bag seeds for like a
[17:05.350 --> 17:08.790]  decade, you know, before he popped his first seeds in 76.
[17:08.790 --> 17:10.870]  And it was like, you know, Mexican, South American.
[17:11.910 --> 17:14.550]  They acclimated that to the hills in Northern California.
[17:16.070 --> 17:18.310]  And then some indica came in from Afghanistan.
[17:18.310 --> 17:18.950]  They grew that.
[17:18.950 --> 17:21.030]  They crossed those together, grew them for decades.
[17:21.030 --> 17:23.590]  And then I came onto the scene.
[17:23.590 --> 17:27.030]  My older brother, a lot younger, I think he was like 10 or 11, helping my dad in the garden.
[17:27.030 --> 17:29.350]  And he looked at me and said, you know, you need to go to school.
[17:29.350 --> 17:30.950]  I got one kid growing weed.
[17:32.230 --> 17:33.590]  Do something else with your life.
[17:33.590 --> 17:36.150]  And now I'm running the family farm and he's pretty happy.
[17:36.870 --> 17:40.150]  I mean, he wanted me to be more than just an outlaw, which I get.
[17:40.150 --> 17:41.590]  And now I'm more than just an outlaw.
[17:41.590 --> 17:44.870]  I run a commercial cannabis farm and licensed nursery.
[17:45.430 --> 17:53.270]  And then we just, you know, we just we've always made seeds.
[17:53.270 --> 17:59.670]  And like I've talked with Nick and like Zellick was saying, like we learned the heart first.
[17:59.670 --> 18:01.110]  We're plant whispers first.
[18:01.110 --> 18:03.350]  And now we're like, OK, what does filial mean?
[18:03.350 --> 18:05.110]  I better look that up from Webster's.
[18:05.110 --> 18:11.110]  OK, like, you know, so we're learning the science where we need to.
[18:11.670 --> 18:15.350]  And it's fun and we're all very passionate about what we do.
[18:15.350 --> 18:17.830]  And it's great to be up here with these guys.
[18:25.900 --> 18:28.460]  Hey, I'm Josh from Moon Gazer Farms.
[18:30.860 --> 18:35.420]  Just got to give a huge love and gratitude to Joey and Tamara.
[18:35.420 --> 18:36.460]  This is amazing.
[18:38.300 --> 18:39.260]  You guys are amazing.
[18:40.540 --> 18:42.220]  This is like how things used to be.
[18:42.220 --> 18:45.420]  And I'm getting a lot of good feeling from how that all was.
[18:45.420 --> 18:46.700]  And thank you all for coming.
[18:47.420 --> 18:53.820]  But basically, pretty much my wife, Sandra, and I, we have a couple kids, twins,
[18:53.820 --> 18:57.260]  and we're just trying to make it as a legal as a, you know, rec farm.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.500]  Back when we met Nick and Jesse and everyone,
[19:01.500 --> 19:03.980]  things were starting to get legal and we kind of jumped into it.
[19:03.980 --> 19:10.140]  And people were telling us to grow clones and have everything be all uniform and everything.
[19:10.140 --> 19:15.260]  And we just always wanted to stick with the seeds and do our breeding.
[19:15.260 --> 19:19.980]  And it's finally gotten us to a point now where it's like,
[19:19.980 --> 19:23.500]  you just got to have like AAA herb right now.
[19:23.500 --> 19:26.780]  And it's got to be good.
[19:27.820 --> 19:31.420]  And growing from seeds, we're able to achieve that,
[19:31.420 --> 19:33.340]  even though we have different phenotypes.
[19:34.220 --> 19:38.700]  And things don't have to be like super duper uniform all the time.
[19:40.060 --> 19:41.660]  So it's, you know, yeah.
[19:41.660 --> 19:44.300]  So, you know, seeds are just for so many reasons.
[19:44.940 --> 19:49.260]  I mean, even our own kids, like they're, you know, we had, they're different phenotypes,
[19:49.260 --> 19:50.700]  but people think they're identical.
[19:50.700 --> 19:52.540]  People think they're identical all the time.
[19:53.980 --> 19:57.420]  But we see their subtle differences and we love their subtle differences.
[19:59.020 --> 20:02.780]  And so that's sort of how I approach the cannabis
[20:03.820 --> 20:06.540]  and how a lot of us here approach the cannabis.
[20:08.380 --> 20:13.500]  And it's just kind of been, if you want a truly sun-grown product,
[20:14.140 --> 20:16.140]  which we do, that's what we like to smoke.
[20:17.180 --> 20:22.460]  It's sort of planted in the spring on the, when the moon is a specific,
[20:22.460 --> 20:25.100]  when the moon is in a certain phase.
[20:25.100 --> 20:30.060]  And we harvest it in the fall when the moon's in a certain phase.
[20:30.060 --> 20:33.340]  And, you know, when you're growing from clones,
[20:33.340 --> 20:38.940]  clones are wonderful and they've been crucial for this plant, of course, in its evolution.
[20:38.940 --> 20:42.860]  But at this point for us, when we're out in the light and we're doing it out,
[20:42.860 --> 20:47.260]  we're doing it this way, you know, that's, that's how we want to smoke.
[20:47.260 --> 20:49.180]  That's what we want to provide for people.
[20:49.180 --> 20:51.580]  And so that's how we're doing it is just from seed,
[20:51.580 --> 20:53.740]  planted in the spring, harvested in the fall.
[20:53.740 --> 20:57.340]  And of course, planted among lots of other beautiful plants
[20:57.340 --> 20:59.260]  so that we don't have to spray anything.
[21:00.060 --> 21:00.940]  And that's what we do.
[21:01.660 --> 21:02.460]  All right.
[21:02.460 --> 21:15.340]  Thank you.
[21:22.620 --> 21:23.100]  Hello.
[21:23.100 --> 21:23.600]  Okay.
[21:28.180 --> 21:28.660]  Hello.
[21:28.660 --> 21:28.980]  Hello.
[21:28.980 --> 21:29.540]  Okay.
[21:29.540 --> 21:33.460]  I think this just got a loose thing, so we got to be careful when we're holding it.
[21:33.460 --> 21:37.700]  But I just would rather sit down and kind of not do the whole thing in that way.
[21:40.100 --> 21:41.780]  And I'll just pass this around,
[21:41.780 --> 21:43.780]  but I'm just going to kind of bring up some topics.
[22:13.020 --> 22:13.660]  Back on.
[22:13.660 --> 22:14.540]  Okay, we're back on.
[22:16.300 --> 22:16.700]  All right.
[22:18.780 --> 22:21.340]  So I want to, I want to get into some,
[22:22.140 --> 22:24.780]  just kind of, I want to dig into some breeding a little bit.
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.660]  I'm pretty passionate about it.
[22:27.660 --> 22:32.220]  You know, my evolution with breeding seeds has evolved rapidly,
[22:33.420 --> 22:35.580]  and I haven't been doing it as long as everybody.
[22:37.020 --> 22:41.340]  But I've been committed to it very, pretty seriously,
[22:41.340 --> 22:47.420]  and been paying really close attention to a whole bunch of different lines and working lines.
[22:47.420 --> 22:49.420]  But my question is,
[22:51.740 --> 22:54.860]  out of all the seeds that you like to grow,
[22:55.740 --> 23:04.300]  and if we could think of seeds in different categories, such as F1, IBL, polyhybrid,
[23:05.820 --> 23:08.860]  specific traits within genetics that you might like,
[23:10.940 --> 23:16.940]  but what type of seeds are your preference for growing for you?
[23:17.580 --> 23:21.580]  Not, not for what the market wants,
[23:21.580 --> 23:27.740]  because if we're all, all breeders have to do a certain amount of work for the market,
[23:27.740 --> 23:31.580]  but also then there's a certain amount of soul work that goes on in breeding.
[23:31.580 --> 23:34.220]  And so I want to pull some of the soul out of you guys,
[23:34.780 --> 23:41.100]  and just like hear what your favorite types of seeds to pop right now are,
[23:41.100 --> 23:45.180]  and interpret that the way you will, if it's from your own stock, if it's just whatever.
[23:45.180 --> 23:49.180]  But if anybody wants to volunteer to take that one on first.
[23:51.660 --> 23:53.900]  Go down the line again, it's nice and easy with the mic.
[24:08.490 --> 24:08.970]  We good?
[24:08.970 --> 24:09.370]  All right.
[24:12.810 --> 24:21.450]  I guess what I most want to grow is what I find interesting, and that's a little bit rough.
[24:23.290 --> 24:27.930]  Yeah, it's what, what I get to learn from, what things that I find interesting,
[24:27.930 --> 24:33.050]  that's, that's what I want to keep sprouting, the things that I have in my head, what I want to see,
[24:33.770 --> 24:37.930]  what I want to see other people grow, and what I want to see come from that.
[24:37.930 --> 24:43.130]  It's all like very interesting, like possibilities that go out,
[24:43.130 --> 24:47.370]  and you know, what, what else will come from this seed.
[24:57.920 --> 25:00.480]  The speaker's right here, so that actually works a lot better.
[25:04.960 --> 25:12.160]  So to be able to see the outcome of something on a farm too, in different locations,
[25:12.160 --> 25:13.520]  also really interests me.
[25:14.400 --> 25:20.400]  And doing that around hash is really interesting, to be able to see how hash comes out,
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.840]  how that yields, and to see that on different farms, and different plants isolated,
[25:25.840 --> 25:27.760]  and then the idea of breeding with them.
[25:28.640 --> 25:36.320]  But some of the like really joyful things are growing like true primordial varieties,
[25:36.320 --> 25:41.280]  and landraces, and seeing all the lessons that they like kind of have in there,
[25:41.280 --> 25:43.840]  and really observing the plant in those forms.
[25:44.400 --> 25:52.800]  The low lab from Erazan Indian Landrace Seed Exchange, he had got these low lab valley
[25:53.680 --> 25:59.520]  um seeds, which is like 7,000 feet up in um Kashmir,
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.880]  and in an area growing in the trees, and in the hills where it didn't have any other cross
[26:04.880 --> 26:09.360]  pollination, there's no light pollution, so it's not really affected by human encroachment,
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.360]  and it actually is a primordial variety that's just been growing in the trees.
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.440]  And it was really interesting to see all the things that were already there,
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.120]  and this thing, this plant that's been growing in the same way for thousands of years,
[26:21.120 --> 26:24.640]  in the same location without other things messing with it.
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.920]  And it was very, they were very adaptive, very smart, they're kind of like
[26:32.160 --> 26:38.880]  the wolves of a cannabis plant, in the fact that they're like just adapted to survive in this place,
[26:38.880 --> 26:40.400]  and not domesticated.
[26:40.400 --> 26:45.840]  When we start to do domestication process, like instant morphology changes happen,
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.320]  so like if you're picking your favorite plant, and smelling those flowers,
[26:50.320 --> 26:53.520]  and then, or seeing how well it hashes or something,
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.600]  those seeds are the ones that are actually inside the flower,
[26:57.600 --> 27:02.960]  and just hidden in that brax a little closer to the actual stem and inside,
[27:02.960 --> 27:07.280]  and so those ones, they don't like fly out that easy, and they get bigger,
[27:07.280 --> 27:10.960]  and instantly you start domesticating, the seeds get plumper and bigger.
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.600]  These seeds are incredibly small, and very thin, and ready to like fly out,
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.560]  so like when breeding with it, like I had to be really careful to like put it back around it,
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.760]  before cutting it, because the seeds would all just start flying, you know,
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.080]  and that's like a scattering too, the wind would come by,
[27:26.080 --> 27:29.520]  and they would actually go pretty far, it was just like ready to shoot out,
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.280]  and it's like, oh yeah, you know, like the only reason why they'd stay in,
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.840]  is because that was like an interaction with humans, and like picking the thing that you,
[27:37.840 --> 27:39.760]  so those are the ones that keep getting passed on,
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.280]  it's like the one in your favorite flower,
[27:41.280 --> 27:44.720]  if you're actually choosing in that kind of selection process,
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.400]  it's just kind of interesting to think about all the lessons something old can show us,
[27:50.400 --> 27:57.600]  and the adaptive aspect of it too, as far as being able to watch it,
[27:57.600 --> 28:00.640]  and interact with the sun, and its environment, or them,
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.160]  I don't want to say it, it's not like the right word when referring to a plant,
[28:04.160 --> 28:09.040]  but you know, they, I was growing both male and females,
[28:09.040 --> 28:11.520]  and we should have better words, I guess,
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.720]  but they were tracking the sun so perfectly before it rose,
[28:16.720 --> 28:21.840]  you know, like, and I actually did night vision time-lapse photos of them,
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.240]  to watch this dance that they do each day,
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.040]  and they would just like set up so good,
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.560]  like just stretching like straight yoga ready for the sun,
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.160]  and got every bit of that perfect like light in the beginning,
[28:34.160 --> 28:38.320]  and then would kind of track, and then at night they would fall down so far,
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.760]  just completely like hold everything in, and go through this whole breath,
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.040]  and yeah, it was just interesting, like how fast they grew,
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.720]  and how small and slow they grew at first too,
[28:52.720 --> 28:58.080]  all the seeds were, they're just so small, and they take so long to germinate,
[28:58.080 --> 29:01.680]  and are difficult to germinate, and I was thinking about,
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.120]  well that makes a ton of sense, because if all of a sudden they're scattering,
[29:05.120 --> 29:09.360]  and then the snow comes down, or like it rains right before the winter,
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.040]  every plant that germinates just dies 7,000 feet up or so,
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.760]  and so they had to really be smart enough to know,
[29:17.760 --> 29:21.200]  hey are these conditions really right, you know, like, okay yeah, it's wet,
[29:21.200 --> 29:24.320]  maybe it's warm enough, but is it warm enough for enough period of time,
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.080]  for us to really be like, okay cool, let's crack,
[29:28.080 --> 29:32.800]  we're gonna have a successful season, and not immediately die by like some big storm,
[29:33.440 --> 29:36.800]  and yeah, then they seem to like show that too, they're very careful,
[29:36.800 --> 29:40.480]  they're just like, okay is this it, and they crack so slowly,
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.320]  the germination, and just that root radical is just so small,
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.400]  and coming out the teeniest little sprouts, but then they grow really, really fast,
[29:49.440 --> 29:53.360]  and take advantage of whatever they have, and that might be,
[29:54.160 --> 29:56.560]  but if they don't have much, they'll conserve too,
[29:56.560 --> 30:00.560]  so they can kind of, they're very adaptive in figuring that kind of stuff out,
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.040]  but yeah, the things that are fascinating,
[30:05.040 --> 30:08.640]  are interesting, that connect to something old, and get me thinking,
[30:08.640 --> 30:12.400]  and whether that's for making something that makes a farmer more successful,
[30:12.400 --> 30:15.280]  and what they're doing, you know, I like mold resistance,
[30:15.280 --> 30:19.600]  I like having stuff that flowers at certain times, certain terpene profiles,
[30:19.600 --> 30:23.120]  certain hash yielding, just profiles in the flowers,
[30:23.120 --> 30:26.560]  and look at all the things, and like figuring out what works for someone,
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.440]  and that's a constant puzzle, and fascination too,
[30:30.160 --> 30:31.280]  the things that are interesting.
[30:40.230 --> 30:45.750]  So I want to thank Jesse, because he shared his genetics with me,
[30:45.750 --> 30:56.230]  and have just made new genetics now, that are like substantially better mold resistance,
[30:56.230 --> 31:02.710]  and you know, crystal content, because he has a lot of hash strains,
[31:03.430 --> 31:07.510]  so I bred that with a lot of my different velvet perps crosses,
[31:08.710 --> 31:11.990]  so now they're like, they seem super charged,
[31:11.990 --> 31:16.950]  but I started growing like little plants in the bushes,
[31:16.950 --> 31:21.430]  like gorilla status, you know, I'm sure a lot of people have done that before,
[31:21.430 --> 31:28.790]  but I was always fascinated with like, you know, throwing pollen on,
[31:28.790 --> 31:33.990]  I would have to like, walk two miles, and I had a couple little male plants,
[31:33.990 --> 31:39.110]  in a little spring bed, you know, and I would take the pollen,
[31:39.110 --> 31:42.550]  and throw it on my best, you know, one of my best plants,
[31:43.190 --> 31:48.230]  and you know, just to see the diversity of what comes out of,
[31:48.950 --> 31:51.030]  you know, just throwing a little bit of pollen on,
[31:51.990 --> 31:55.110]  and seeing, you know, the different phenotypes that come out,
[31:55.110 --> 31:58.550]  it's just, it's kind of like a Pandora's box, you never know what you're gonna get,
[31:58.550 --> 32:04.710]  so that really like, you know, got me into breeding, you know,
[32:05.350 --> 32:09.750]  so about 10 years ago, I really started to do it each year,
[32:11.110 --> 32:13.510]  making my own seeds, and then growing them,
[32:13.510 --> 32:17.190]  and then selecting the best ones, you know, that I liked,
[32:17.190 --> 32:24.150]  and throwing more pollen on them, and it's, you know, it's just like a,
[32:24.710 --> 32:31.510]  it's a good thing to do, you know, yeah, it really, it makes me happy,
[32:33.510 --> 32:36.150]  and you know, yeah, keep on doing it, yeah,
[32:38.630 --> 32:42.710]  now it's like that everything's changed into, you know, like,
[32:43.990 --> 32:47.190]  you have to have the best stuff to even just get it on the market,
[32:47.190 --> 32:51.350]  to maybe sell it for a decent price, possibly, I don't know, not anymore,
[32:51.670 --> 32:55.190]  maybe, hopefully in the future, you know, but, you know,
[32:56.710 --> 32:59.670]  we can just keep crossing our varieties together,
[33:00.630 --> 33:03.030]  and who knows what we'll come up with, so,
[33:05.430 --> 33:12.560]  I'm gonna jump in, because I'm right here in line,
[33:12.560 --> 33:16.240]  I just want to share what I'm working on as well, or what is exciting right now,
[33:17.920 --> 33:20.800]  but when I think of breeding seeds, I mean, that's the piece that
[33:21.520 --> 33:25.040]  I'm most excited about, which is funny, because that doesn't mix,
[33:25.280 --> 33:29.040]  as well as a commercial production farmer, which I have to rely on,
[33:30.080 --> 33:34.480]  but I love breeding so much that I just do it,
[33:34.480 --> 33:40.160]  and my favorite thing lately has been doing as many inbred lines as I can,
[33:40.160 --> 33:43.600]  as many populations of those inbred lines as I can in small rows
[33:43.600 --> 33:46.400]  within a greenhouse high population counts,
[33:46.400 --> 33:49.200]  and making selections within those inbred lines,
[33:49.200 --> 33:52.480]  and furthering each inbred line, but also they're all there set up,
[33:52.480 --> 33:54.480]  stacked on one another to make real F1s,
[33:54.480 --> 33:58.160]  if all of the lines that you're putting in your breeding hoop are inbred,
[33:58.160 --> 34:02.400]  so you're making more IBLs, and you're making more F1 stock,
[34:02.400 --> 34:06.400]  and F1 stock is what you want to have if you're growing production,
[34:06.400 --> 34:08.560]  which I have to do, and I have to depend on that,
[34:08.560 --> 34:11.440]  so I've had to go through that testing process,
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.960]  but the truth is there aren't really real F1s out there right now,
[34:14.960 --> 34:17.600]  because we're all still so immature in our breeding,
[34:17.600 --> 34:20.560]  you know, there are some, you know,
[34:20.800 --> 34:25.840]  deeper, we're getting further, but really standard inbreeding
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.640]  for isolating traits and characteristics is like more than 10 generations,
[34:30.640 --> 34:33.680]  so, you know, when that's the case, we just have to be realistic,
[34:33.680 --> 34:37.280]  but I just say keep going down the lines, keep inbreeding,
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.200]  but also keep crossing those inbred lines to make those F1s,
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.040]  and explore that, because the hybrid vigor is definitely something
[34:45.040 --> 34:47.680]  to understand when you're growing for production.
[34:47.760 --> 34:50.560]  So the breeding is the most exciting thing for me,
[34:50.560 --> 34:55.760]  and I just go kind of a little overboard with inbred line collections, but...
[34:55.760 --> 35:03.760]  Yeah, yeah, what Nick just said, yeah, what he just said, basically well said.
[35:03.760 --> 35:10.240]  But yeah, there's a bunch of things in there, like what you're saying,
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.160]  how it's hard to do that in a commercial environment,
[35:14.160 --> 35:18.160]  and how it's hard to do that in a commercial space
[35:18.160 --> 35:19.680]  that you're trying to run for production,
[35:19.680 --> 35:21.360]  and that's what I've been doing for years,
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.400]  is breeding and doing production, so running a research facility
[35:26.400 --> 35:28.800]  and a production facility in one space,
[35:28.800 --> 35:33.360]  which is really crazy, because there's a lot of room for,
[35:34.080 --> 35:36.240]  I mean, there's no room for error, you know,
[35:37.200 --> 35:40.640]  so you really have to be like extra on your shit,
[35:41.280 --> 35:43.760]  you cannot slack for one second,
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.400]  because you're working with a lot of different lines,
[35:46.400 --> 35:51.760]  so plus it's just, you know, yeah, it's just hard to really,
[35:51.760 --> 35:54.800]  you know, pop enough seeds and have the square footage
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.240]  to make those selections, so I'm kind of actually,
[35:58.240 --> 36:03.600]  kind of phased out of doing my breeding projects for right now,
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.440]  and just holding on to my seed stock,
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.920]  just because I'm trying to just stay, you know,
[36:09.920 --> 36:11.440]  shit's kind of falling apart, right,
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.120]  so I'm just trying to stay in my lane, and that's okay, you know,
[36:15.120 --> 36:18.400]  so I'm not trying to do too much, which is, you know, it's okay,
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.520]  you know, I've been, so yeah, I was running these inbred lines,
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.600]  I've been running these dogs, I'm calling it the dog pound,
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.200]  which, you know, from my dog, my dog,
[36:29.200 --> 36:31.920]  originally it was like dog shit, bag seed,
[36:31.920 --> 36:37.200]  and then this super silver haze male,
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.120]  so, you know, we just started running a bunch of lines
[36:41.120 --> 36:45.280]  off of that dog shit, so I really like the dog shit terps,
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.600]  I just literally, I just love it, I don't, a lot,
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.640]  it was a hard sell because of the name, you know, obviously,
[36:53.360 --> 36:56.240]  so, you know, but, so that's, you know,
[36:56.240 --> 36:59.040]  so then that's how kind of the dog star came up,
[36:59.040 --> 37:01.280]  once it went into the super silver, you know,
[37:01.280 --> 37:04.880]  we called it dog star, you know, which was, you know,
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.240]  like serious A, you know, the origins of cannabis,
[37:10.240 --> 37:12.480]  that whole story, I'm not gonna get into all that,
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.960]  but, you know, that's kind of like, you know,
[37:14.960 --> 37:19.920]  paying homage to the origins of cannabis and that whole thing,
[37:19.920 --> 37:22.240]  and the fact that, you know, kind of, you know,
[37:23.120 --> 37:25.760]  that we ended up finding the high CBGA,
[37:26.640 --> 37:30.240]  which is the precursor to all cannabinoids, you know,
[37:30.240 --> 37:33.520]  that was pretty appropriate for, you know, calling it dog star,
[37:33.520 --> 37:35.040]  I felt, you know, to, you know,
[37:35.040 --> 37:37.280]  because it was something special,
[37:37.280 --> 37:42.560]  like, you know, over 3% CBGA at full term,
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.200]  like, like full term, you know, full term,
[37:45.840 --> 37:50.800]  three months later, testing it, it's over 3%, 3, 4% CBGA,
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.640]  which was, you know, which is one of the first cannabinoids
[37:54.640 --> 37:56.960]  that, you know, deteriorates, you know,
[37:56.960 --> 38:00.560]  and so it's really hard to get high, you know,
[38:00.560 --> 38:02.720]  to isolate the CBGA, apparently,
[38:02.720 --> 38:03.840]  which I didn't know at the time.
[38:03.840 --> 38:06.240]  So, you know, once we found that out,
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.200]  we just started working with that a little more intentionally,
[38:11.200 --> 38:13.120]  you know, and that was kind of like,
[38:13.120 --> 38:15.680]  that was that head change that I was chasing,
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.040]  kind of like a CBD, you know, we all know what that's like,
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.160]  you know, but the CBGA, it's kind of, it's similar,
[38:22.160 --> 38:24.240]  but it's got like that different head change,
[38:24.240 --> 38:26.400]  but it's similar, you know,
[38:26.400 --> 38:29.040]  and it's really hard to put your finger on,
[38:29.040 --> 38:29.760]  you know what I mean?
[38:29.760 --> 38:32.000]  Because, you know, it just is.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.440]  So that's, you know, so that was really exciting for me,
[38:35.440 --> 38:36.640]  because that's what I was doing,
[38:36.640 --> 38:38.000]  and that's kind of like my story.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.440]  So that was really exciting.
[38:39.440 --> 38:41.200]  As far as what I would like to work with,
[38:41.200 --> 38:43.120]  I'd like to work with everyone else's stuff,
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.240]  but I don't quite have like the space
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.120]  to pop everybody's label at all,
[38:49.120 --> 38:51.360]  and, you know, but I would love to.
[38:51.360 --> 38:52.640]  So I really, you know,
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.400]  and if somebody's going to give me something to work with,
[38:54.400 --> 38:57.440]  I kind of need like a hundred of any one, you know,
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.640]  seed to just to pop,
[39:00.640 --> 39:02.320]  because like 10 is just like,
[39:02.320 --> 39:03.600]  what am I doing with that?
[39:03.600 --> 39:06.240]  You know, I'm like, where, what, I don't have,
[39:06.240 --> 39:07.760]  you know, I'm going to start looking for other,
[39:07.760 --> 39:09.600]  you know, head step, you know, just,
[39:09.600 --> 39:10.960]  you know, I'm trying to, you know,
[39:10.960 --> 39:12.160]  on a commercial facility,
[39:12.160 --> 39:13.760]  I have to have more of a direction.
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.280]  So, but we just don't have the, my county, whatever.
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.400]  So we're just, we're just staying in our lane for right now,
[39:21.360 --> 39:22.240]  you know, which is cool.
[39:23.360 --> 39:25.520]  So anyway, that's been, it's been good,
[39:25.520 --> 39:28.320]  but, you know, I'll get back into messing with,
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.200]  popping a bunch of seeds and looking for different lines.
[39:31.200 --> 39:34.080]  And, you know, I'll get back into that in a minute now,
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.640]  but for right now, I've just been trying to like,
[39:36.640 --> 39:40.080]  you know, hold the line, you know,
[39:40.080 --> 39:41.520]  just survive for a minute.
[39:41.520 --> 39:43.760]  But yeah, yeah, I just like to,
[39:43.760 --> 39:46.640]  I would love to work with like everyone's stuff, really.
[39:47.280 --> 39:49.040]  But yeah, kind of like what Nick is saying.
[39:49.040 --> 39:51.360]  It's just like, that's what I've been, you know,
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.680]  just doing that for a long time.
[39:53.760 --> 39:57.520]  And so, yeah, just, yeah, it's working out.
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.040]  Just got to listen to the plant.
[39:59.040 --> 40:01.600]  You know, we were just, we were just, you know,
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.520]  we weren't, we didn't have any like, you know,
[40:03.520 --> 40:04.880]  education or guidance.
[40:04.880 --> 40:07.040]  We were just literally just like, you know,
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.120]  like we do everything, just listening,
[40:09.120 --> 40:10.720]  just being guided by the plant.
[40:10.720 --> 40:13.520]  And it's amazing how far that can get you.
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.440]  You know, it's amazing.
[40:15.440 --> 40:17.040]  That's really just what it is.
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.400]  Our ancestors did that.
[40:18.400 --> 40:21.520]  That's just how it is, you know, it's really effective.
[40:21.520 --> 40:22.960]  It got us all this far.
[40:22.960 --> 40:25.520]  Look at all the amazing genetics and lines
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.280]  and breeding, you know, that's happened throughout,
[40:29.280 --> 40:31.840]  you know, like a long, many, many years.
[40:31.840 --> 40:34.480]  So yeah, it's just, it's really good
[40:34.480 --> 40:36.400]  that we're all here swapping seeds.
[40:36.400 --> 40:39.200]  And, you know, I think it's awesome.
[40:39.200 --> 40:41.280]  It's really cool how everybody's like,
[40:41.280 --> 40:42.800]  not holding onto shit anymore.
[40:42.800 --> 40:46.560]  Like it used to be like this, like whole lockdown, you know.
[40:46.560 --> 40:48.640]  And that's kind of also why I just was like
[40:48.640 --> 40:49.920]  doing my own thing, you know,
[40:49.920 --> 40:52.000]  just because we were just doing our own thing.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.280]  We weren't like messing with anyone else's stuff, really.
[40:55.280 --> 40:57.280]  So yeah, it's just been,
[40:57.280 --> 40:59.920]  so it's really nice that to have all this variety
[40:59.920 --> 41:01.840]  because that's, you know, that's just like,
[41:01.840 --> 41:04.080]  that's what life is about, variety.
[41:04.880 --> 41:05.520]  All right, cool.
[41:12.230 --> 41:13.830]  I'll keep this short.
[41:13.830 --> 41:14.470]  What Nick said?
[41:18.710 --> 41:20.870]  Yeah, I mean, just working lines is definitely
[41:20.870 --> 41:21.990]  what I'm into too.
[41:21.990 --> 41:24.470]  And, you know, you kind of,
[41:25.430 --> 41:28.070]  you kind of see what you want to look for
[41:28.070 --> 41:29.910]  in your first generation.
[41:29.910 --> 41:31.430]  And then you get to see what you're working with
[41:31.430 --> 41:32.630]  in your second generation.
[41:32.630 --> 41:35.670]  And, you know, and it is like,
[41:35.670 --> 41:37.270]  I'm sure everyone up here will agree,
[41:37.270 --> 41:39.270]  like it's about getting lucky too, you know.
[41:39.270 --> 41:41.350]  It's like sometimes you just,
[41:41.910 --> 41:44.790]  but then if you had like the populations to do the sifts,
[41:44.790 --> 41:50.310]  like if you start enough seeds of, you know, F1, F2, F3,
[41:50.310 --> 41:52.710]  you're going to find one that looks just like her mother.
[41:52.710 --> 41:54.470]  And that's the one you made the seeds on,
[41:54.470 --> 41:56.310]  you know, that's the one you want to stabilize.
[41:56.310 --> 41:58.070]  And sometimes you get lucky and find her
[41:58.070 --> 42:00.150]  and, you know, 40 seeds or less, you know,
[42:00.150 --> 42:00.950]  sometimes you don't.
[42:00.950 --> 42:02.710]  You got to look again, the next generation.
[42:02.710 --> 42:04.150]  Or there's been a lot of times
[42:04.150 --> 42:06.070]  where I make a generation of seeds, get the pond.
[42:06.070 --> 42:07.430]  I'm like, oh, I'm not going to make it this year.
[42:07.430 --> 42:09.670]  This isn't, you know, I didn't find what I was looking for.
[42:09.670 --> 42:11.910]  But, you know, it's fun.
[42:12.470 --> 42:13.430]  And you're going to lose things
[42:13.430 --> 42:14.550]  and you're going to find things.
[42:14.550 --> 42:17.990]  And it is beautiful working with this plant,
[42:17.990 --> 42:19.590]  this plant spirit, you know,
[42:19.590 --> 42:22.710]  the, you know, cannabis is,
[42:23.750 --> 42:25.350]  I mean, everything's consciousness, right?
[42:25.350 --> 42:26.790]  You know, our light or vibrate,
[42:26.790 --> 42:28.470]  whatever you want to look at on the molecular level.
[42:28.470 --> 42:31.270]  And something like cannabis or the cactus
[42:31.270 --> 42:33.670]  or some other plants that interact with our consciousness,
[42:33.670 --> 42:35.430]  they have a higher concentration of that.
[42:35.430 --> 42:36.790]  And we get to co-create with that
[42:36.790 --> 42:38.150]  and we get to find whatever, you know,
[42:39.110 --> 42:40.710]  any one of us could take a line
[42:40.710 --> 42:41.990]  and go a different direction with it
[42:41.990 --> 42:43.190]  when we put our heart into it.
[42:43.190 --> 42:44.790]  And that's a beautiful thing too.
[42:44.790 --> 42:47.990]  And it is beautiful to share those genetics with everybody.
[42:48.550 --> 42:52.550]  And to not worry, like worry about getting out there
[42:52.550 --> 42:54.230]  because you're going to do something beautiful with it.
[42:54.230 --> 42:55.430]  And we might go somewhere else with it.
[42:55.430 --> 42:56.950]  And then we get something back from somebody
[42:56.950 --> 42:57.750]  or lose something.
[42:57.750 --> 43:00.630]  And you get that co-creation with this plant.
[43:01.590 --> 43:04.310]  And yeah, we really need that right now
[43:06.550 --> 43:07.670]  as a planet and a people,
[43:07.670 --> 43:10.870]  what cannabis can do from like oil production to medicine
[43:10.870 --> 43:14.390]  and just with consciousness in general, you know.
[43:14.390 --> 43:17.350]  And I'm also very excited that psychedelics
[43:17.350 --> 43:18.790]  are going to be legal soon,
[43:18.790 --> 43:21.270]  hopefully in the next, our lifetime
[43:21.270 --> 43:23.030]  across the United States.
[43:26.790 --> 43:29.590]  Yeah, I mean, if you listen, you know,
[43:29.590 --> 43:31.030]  she calls to you, she talks to you
[43:31.990 --> 43:33.750]  and then you get to put your input in too.
[43:33.750 --> 43:36.070]  And it's a fun relationship as a breeder
[43:36.070 --> 43:39.030]  that you develop with your plants in your lines
[43:39.030 --> 43:40.470]  and then your friends lines, like, you know,
[43:40.470 --> 43:42.790]  like, you know, we're all doing like amazing work
[43:42.790 --> 43:44.150]  or, you know, or getting lucky.
[43:44.550 --> 43:53.790]  Yeah, I mean, with regard to what we like to grow,
[43:54.750 --> 43:56.750]  basically when we first started out,
[43:59.150 --> 44:02.350]  you know, definitely Jesse seeds I had been seeking out.
[44:02.350 --> 44:04.750]  I was basically looking for seeds that had been grown
[44:04.750 --> 44:09.710]  in living soil and on the full sun that were resistant.
[44:09.710 --> 44:12.350]  And of course that tasted really good and things like that.
[44:12.350 --> 44:14.110]  I mean, since then we've probably,
[44:14.990 --> 44:15.870]  everyone on this panel,
[44:15.870 --> 44:17.630]  we've got a little bit of genetics from,
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.830]  we have some of our own genetics.
[44:19.550 --> 44:23.710]  We have some from Amanda's garden and Joey and Tamara.
[44:23.710 --> 44:27.790]  We got some seeds from, so we just love to mix it up.
[44:27.790 --> 44:29.150]  We love to smoke.
[44:29.150 --> 44:31.630]  And so we like to try lots of different things
[44:31.630 --> 44:35.070]  and from day to day or, you know,
[44:35.070 --> 44:37.950]  our taste or our palate might change,
[44:37.950 --> 44:42.190]  but we definitely will go for commercial as well.
[44:42.190 --> 44:47.310]  So, but we're not too fixated on having them all be purple.
[44:47.310 --> 44:49.470]  You know, if you end up having a little bit
[44:49.470 --> 44:52.110]  of mixed phenotypes, but they all have a certain smell.
[44:52.670 --> 44:56.510]  We're super into like some, you know, uniformity in that sense.
[44:57.870 --> 45:01.070]  But hash also, we're definitely been breeding for
[45:01.070 --> 45:04.190]  and thankful to Jesse for getting us some of the Nana breath
[45:04.190 --> 45:06.190]  and the other banana OG crosses.
[45:07.310 --> 45:08.910]  They've been super nice for us.
[45:10.430 --> 45:16.110]  Yeah, bananas, coffees, just lots of different guavas,
[45:16.110 --> 45:21.550]  watermelons, blueberries, just kind of mixing it all up.
[45:21.550 --> 45:22.430]  It's always been fun.
[45:30.500 --> 45:35.700]  So I'm into hash as well now, by the way.
[45:36.900 --> 45:39.620]  And so that's another part that I'm super excited in the,
[45:40.500 --> 45:45.860]  I'm seriously mostly focused on hash line seeds for growing
[45:45.860 --> 45:49.860]  because I really just like, well, the truth is,
[45:49.860 --> 45:54.180]  is when the resin is stored, I can have something for years.
[45:54.180 --> 45:57.460]  That's really like it was in the flower.
[45:58.340 --> 46:01.380]  You know, it's bulky and big and I don't know,
[46:01.380 --> 46:05.540]  but so there's this beauty in hash that I've really been tuning into.
[46:06.100 --> 46:08.980]  So from a genetic standpoint, that's definitely been something
[46:08.980 --> 46:12.660]  I have felt, but I think, you know,
[46:12.660 --> 46:14.740]  things have been rolling for quite a while.
[46:14.740 --> 46:16.020]  How's everybody feeling?
[46:16.020 --> 46:18.820]  Do we want to keep rolling down this path
[46:18.820 --> 46:21.940]  or should we kind of take a break and walk around?
[46:21.940 --> 46:23.620]  And what do you guys think?
[46:23.620 --> 46:24.980]  It's way past the time.
[46:24.980 --> 46:26.500]  I can't, I don't know when we started.
[46:26.500 --> 46:27.540]  I don't know where we're at.
[46:29.540 --> 46:30.100]  Keep going.
[46:30.980 --> 46:31.480]  Cool.
[46:33.140 --> 46:34.260]  Yeah, let's do another round.
[46:34.260 --> 46:34.660]  We got it.
[46:34.660 --> 46:38.180]  We don't, rarely are we all in this kind of scenario together.
[46:38.180 --> 46:41.620]  So let's see.
[46:41.620 --> 46:50.580]  We have, so when I, when I talk to people about
[46:51.540 --> 46:54.260]  what are you going to get from a seed standpoint?
[46:56.340 --> 46:58.980]  You know, I like to have some categories of like steering people
[46:58.980 --> 47:02.420]  in the right direction to kind of most help them in their path
[47:02.420 --> 47:03.860]  towards what they're trying to do.
[47:03.860 --> 47:08.340]  So it's like trying to create a whole bunch of stuff.
[47:08.820 --> 47:12.500]  And so there's all these names that people use in our cannabis genetics.
[47:13.060 --> 47:16.660]  And I just kind of want to address them a little bit and be like,
[47:16.660 --> 47:24.740]  there's a lot of loose meaning to a lot of the language when it comes to F1, F2.
[47:25.620 --> 47:33.380]  There's a lot of, you know, it's not super dialed within cannabis breeding
[47:33.380 --> 47:37.940]  or it hasn't been as much, but I think it's important for us to explore it
[47:38.100 --> 47:42.820]  and to understand it more and to understand like what agriculture normally does
[47:42.820 --> 47:44.260]  in the breeding sense.
[47:44.260 --> 47:48.340]  And so I was talking about inbred lines and, you know,
[47:49.140 --> 47:53.380]  the value of breeding within bred lines to create hybrids
[47:53.380 --> 47:55.940]  that really have a lot of vigor and all that.
[47:55.940 --> 47:59.380]  But I want to talk a little bit about the benefits
[47:59.380 --> 48:03.540]  and the value of polyhybrids as well, because, you know,
[48:03.540 --> 48:06.740]  there's a lot of polyhybrids around
[48:06.740 --> 48:10.980]  and a lot less of the more strict line work has been being done.
[48:10.980 --> 48:15.140]  And, you know, there's a lot to learn when you get on that path of strict line work
[48:16.020 --> 48:20.180]  and when you peter out or just understanding that inbred lines
[48:20.740 --> 48:24.980]  do kind of slowly become less of a productive thing,
[48:24.980 --> 48:27.300]  but it should be being more honed.
[48:27.300 --> 48:32.580]  And as you narrow that further, your population should start to become increasing.
[48:32.580 --> 48:36.180]  So you might bottleneck some things a couple generations
[48:36.180 --> 48:38.500]  to try and steer it in the direction you want.
[48:38.500 --> 48:42.180]  But after that point, when you've honed something that you've got,
[48:42.180 --> 48:46.100]  and most of them are showing that, you want to open the population's backup
[48:46.100 --> 48:49.300]  because you don't want to keep taking one single parent
[48:49.300 --> 48:51.940]  and one single male and only doing that.
[48:51.940 --> 48:55.380]  You want to start to increase the genetic diversity
[48:55.380 --> 48:58.660]  amongst your bottleneck genetics already.
[48:58.740 --> 49:04.500]  So inbred line work is more than just continually filial generationally crossing,
[49:04.500 --> 49:08.420]  but you also want to think about some population expansions
[49:08.420 --> 49:13.700]  as you're getting into a lesser or more inbred degraded state,
[49:13.700 --> 49:15.860]  which are actually really good for breeding.
[49:15.860 --> 49:18.580]  And people shouldn't get scared of an inbred line
[49:18.580 --> 49:21.860]  that doesn't produce and grow like a hybrid does.
[49:21.860 --> 49:24.900]  But you don't get them for that. You don't get them for production.
[49:24.900 --> 49:27.940]  You get those inbred lines because you want to work with them
[49:27.940 --> 49:34.900]  from a breeding standpoint because they create a super vigorous F1 hybrid offsprings.
[49:34.900 --> 49:38.980]  But I want to go down the line and just let people address polyhybrids
[49:38.980 --> 49:43.700]  and how polyhybrids and working with polyhybrids, what that's like for you.
[49:44.820 --> 49:45.540]  So here we go.
[49:53.010 --> 49:55.570]  Man. Is that working?
[49:57.810 --> 49:58.690]  We good? All right.
[50:00.690 --> 50:01.190]  It is.
[50:01.830 --> 50:04.950]  Man, that was excellent information.
[50:04.950 --> 50:06.870]  I hope everyone was actually paying attention to that.
[50:08.390 --> 50:11.110]  Yeah, there's a lot to think about with that.
[50:11.110 --> 50:15.350]  So I really appreciate Nick's constant work to go down,
[50:16.150 --> 50:19.910]  you know, like multiple, multiple generations,
[50:19.910 --> 50:24.150]  like getting to F6, 7, 8 in different varieties.
[50:24.150 --> 50:27.670]  And when you get to that point, it's a certain level of line breeding
[50:27.670 --> 50:31.510]  that breeds over very true as far as genetics go.
[50:31.510 --> 50:34.710]  And the hybrids that come out of that are really amazing.
[50:34.710 --> 50:37.830]  And, you know, when we first met, there was these,
[50:38.710 --> 50:41.990]  it was with Ryan from Humble Seeds and the glazed cherry.
[50:41.990 --> 50:44.550]  And he gave you those. I gave you the black dog.
[50:44.550 --> 50:48.550]  And you took them to like multiple generations and then put them together.
[50:48.550 --> 50:53.190]  And those hybrids were so even and so much bigger.
[50:53.190 --> 50:57.030]  Like you could just see that multiple generation vigor.
[50:57.030 --> 51:01.430]  And it's like, you know, that's how a lot of breeding is done in agriculture for vegetables
[51:01.430 --> 51:05.030]  and everything. You take stuff to pretty far generation F8, F9,
[51:05.030 --> 51:07.430]  and then you put them together to make an F1.
[51:07.430 --> 51:09.830]  That is a true vigorous hybrid.
[51:09.830 --> 51:12.950]  And there's actually, strangely enough, a certain uniformity
[51:12.950 --> 51:19.350]  in what happens from that crossing of varieties when they're to that point of line breeding.
[51:19.350 --> 51:22.310]  But he also just gave really amazing, really good information
[51:22.870 --> 51:25.270]  around not getting bottlenecked genetically.
[51:25.270 --> 51:29.910]  So as you, you know, you start off earlier, making very solid selections
[51:29.910 --> 51:31.590]  for exactly what you want it to be.
[51:31.590 --> 51:37.190]  You're building that canon of the flavor, the like, the resistance, the structure,
[51:37.190 --> 51:39.910]  all of the factors that you're thinking about and building that.
[51:39.910 --> 51:43.190]  But then you want to make sure that you're using multiple males.
[51:43.190 --> 51:45.750]  And then if you're putting that on to multiple females,
[51:45.750 --> 51:51.190]  and this is from sibling generation, that you then get to really choose from those females.
[51:51.190 --> 51:54.070]  But you know that they've been pollinated with multiple males.
[51:54.070 --> 51:57.750]  And so then, as you've already done some work towards that,
[51:59.910 --> 52:02.150]  selecting what you want and stabilization of that variety,
[52:02.150 --> 52:03.670]  you make sure not to bottleneck it.
[52:03.670 --> 52:05.750]  And then you can work that for longer.
[52:05.750 --> 52:11.270]  So that's, it's really like opening that potential to not get too far down that line.
[52:11.270 --> 52:16.150]  And what happens is actually smaller and smaller plants, a little less vigor.
[52:16.150 --> 52:19.590]  And but more and more, smaller seeds.
[52:19.670 --> 52:20.170]  Yeah.
[52:20.710 --> 52:25.030]  But more and more similar too, though.
[52:25.830 --> 52:28.150]  So it's an incredibly useful thing.
[52:28.150 --> 52:30.070]  But F1s are amazing too.
[52:30.070 --> 52:33.430]  So anyway, polyhybrids, it's actually what the question is about.
[52:34.710 --> 52:35.910]  What we're supposed to be talking about.
[52:35.910 --> 52:37.590]  And I fucking love polyhybrids.
[52:37.590 --> 52:40.870]  I love the work of going down multiple generations.
[52:40.870 --> 52:44.950]  I also love back-crossing work too, which is going back to a generation,
[52:45.590 --> 52:48.710]  the original generation, what you like the most of something.
[52:48.710 --> 52:51.990]  And it's a way of like kind of stacking the genetics onto each other.
[52:51.990 --> 52:56.150]  And you can get to a higher percentage of the same genetic in that next generation really quickly.
[52:56.150 --> 52:57.190]  So that's something I like to do.
[52:57.190 --> 53:02.870]  And then I like to combine that with then doing sibling generations from that.
[53:02.870 --> 53:08.390]  And so making the VC1 F2 or F5 or something in the black dog case.
[53:08.390 --> 53:11.270]  And then it becomes a very much just that genetic.
[53:11.270 --> 53:18.230]  It's the and very useful for breeding because it's similar to that line breeding of getting to a F8 or something.
[53:19.110 --> 53:24.470]  But during that time with polyhybrids, you get to do all kinds of things.
[53:24.470 --> 53:27.430]  I only line breed a couple things each year.
[53:27.430 --> 53:30.470]  You choose a few things that you're going to work pretty good.
[53:30.470 --> 53:32.790]  And then you have the potential to do whatever you want.
[53:32.790 --> 53:34.150]  So I don't really want to limit that.
[53:34.150 --> 53:37.750]  And so it's pretty exciting to be like, oh my god, this would be amazing with that.
[53:37.750 --> 53:44.310]  And just it's all these probability wave fields of potential and goodness that you're
[53:45.430 --> 53:47.350]  looking at and wanting to see happen.
[53:48.070 --> 53:51.430]  And yeah, it's just a super fun selection process.
[53:51.430 --> 53:52.870]  It's a it's a freedom.
[53:52.870 --> 53:53.510]  It's a jazz.
[53:53.510 --> 53:55.510]  It's an art like that.
[53:55.510 --> 54:02.070]  You get to just kind of immerse yourself in the moment and figure out like, man, this should go here on this.
[54:02.070 --> 54:03.270]  And I just can't wait.
[54:03.270 --> 54:04.550]  And you're so excited about it.
[54:04.550 --> 54:07.590]  Like as soon as it happens, it's like, oh my god, I'm going to crack these next year.
[54:07.590 --> 54:09.590]  And I want to make sure my friends grow these.
[54:09.590 --> 54:11.750]  And then you get to see it on other farms in place.
[54:11.750 --> 54:17.270]  And that's so exciting to see something new and all kinds of amazing things come out
[54:17.270 --> 54:18.950]  of polyhybrids.
[54:18.950 --> 54:21.350]  And it can be very different, too.
[54:21.350 --> 54:26.070]  So I like to really label the polyhybrids because there can be certain aspects that
[54:27.990 --> 54:29.190]  come from the line breeding.
[54:29.190 --> 54:32.230]  So they can actually kind of be relatively stable sometimes.
[54:32.230 --> 54:34.710]  And then other combinations will be all over the place.
[54:34.710 --> 54:37.110]  And it depends on those combinations going in.
[54:37.110 --> 54:42.310]  And so I like to kind of like be able to let people know a bit and guide like on what you
[54:42.310 --> 54:43.430]  might be experiencing with something.
[54:43.990 --> 54:48.070]  There's three very select kind of things that come out of it.
[54:48.070 --> 54:51.350]  Or there's a certain uniformity where it's just all over the place.
[54:51.990 --> 54:56.870]  But yeah, I just love the selection process.
[54:56.870 --> 55:04.390]  And really respect the length of time to put each year into making a selection on that
[55:04.390 --> 55:05.190]  next generation.
[55:05.190 --> 55:08.310]  Like to grow out several plants and to then continue on.
[55:08.310 --> 55:09.910]  That's a very useful thing.
[55:09.910 --> 55:16.230]  And Nick, with the seeds that he's brought today, a lot of people have some really useful
[55:16.230 --> 55:20.310]  breeding tools in their hand because now you actually have a line bred thing that you could
[55:20.310 --> 55:26.870]  put with another one to make true F1 hybrids that are going to have that vigor and uniformity
[55:26.870 --> 55:28.630]  that we expect in all agriculture.
[55:30.870 --> 55:31.370]  Thanks.
[55:39.020 --> 55:43.900]  So yeah, keeping the diversity in the stock is important.
[55:43.900 --> 55:49.660]  Like my dad always said, keeping more than just one of the males around.
[55:50.620 --> 55:56.540]  At least keep a couple of them to breed on, you know, keeping the diversity in the stock.
[55:58.940 --> 56:01.420]  You never know what you're going to get out of those seeds then.
[56:01.420 --> 56:04.540]  Like there might be one in there that's just like the one.
[56:07.260 --> 56:07.760]  Louder.
[56:07.920 --> 56:08.420]  Yeah.
[56:12.240 --> 56:21.600]  Polyhybrids, I like, I breed, I bred the velvet perps down like five or six generations.
[56:21.600 --> 56:22.800]  So it's pretty stable.
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.520]  And then definitely breeding them back on other varieties.
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.600]  And you know, it just shows the diversity of, you know, what we're working with.
[56:34.320 --> 56:41.040]  And it's just really special and I'm happy to do it.
[56:48.330 --> 56:55.850]  Polyhybrids, I say, are the best for people hunting clonal stock.
[57:04.970 --> 57:06.090]  What Nick said.
[57:08.650 --> 57:10.810]  I'm going to write a book that's called What Nick Said.
[57:10.810 --> 57:11.310]  Yeah.
[57:12.010 --> 57:12.510]  Yeah.
[57:12.890 --> 57:14.650]  No, but seriously, what Nick said.
[57:14.650 --> 57:15.150]  Yeah.
[57:16.090 --> 57:17.050]  For clone stock.
[57:17.050 --> 57:23.530]  Yeah, that's kind of, yeah, because I've, yeah, this just depends on the direction you want to go.
[57:23.530 --> 57:24.030]  Right.
[57:24.650 --> 57:27.210]  You know, who your clients are, what your market is.
[57:27.210 --> 57:33.130]  So I mean, a lot of this really is depends on who your clients are and where your market is.
[57:33.130 --> 57:37.050]  So it's kind of like, but yeah, as far as polyhybrids.
[57:38.090 --> 57:42.010]  Yeah, like if you're, which is kind of good because you have your polyhybrid,
[57:42.010 --> 57:47.610]  you have you make an amazing selection and then you clone, you're working that line there.
[57:47.610 --> 57:51.210]  And which you're going to get some really nice diversity.
[57:51.210 --> 57:56.970]  And then you can just kind of work with that because, you know, there's a lot of ways to,
[57:57.930 --> 57:59.050]  you know, I don't know.
[57:59.050 --> 58:02.810]  It just depends on, I really feel like it depends on like what you're trying to do.
[58:02.810 --> 58:09.450]  A lot of the times, you know, that just makes, that just makes, you know, whatever,
[58:09.450 --> 58:10.890]  you know, you go in that direction.
[58:10.890 --> 58:16.490]  So, you know, for me, that's kind of like the polyhybrid thing is cool because I make a selection
[58:16.490 --> 58:24.170]  and run that in my greenhouse in like a high yield in, you know, see a green style and that kind of works.
[58:25.370 --> 58:27.050]  Then I get what I'm looking for.
[58:27.610 --> 58:34.650]  But lately, I mean, I've just been kind of running with, you know, whatever different hype clones and,
[58:34.650 --> 58:37.850]  you know, bullshit just because like the market.
[58:37.850 --> 58:38.170]  All right.
[58:43.130 --> 58:43.850]  Hey, everybody.
[58:45.290 --> 58:48.010]  Finn is looking for Tucker.
[58:52.170 --> 58:52.670]  Tucker.
[58:53.390 --> 58:53.890]  Tucker.
[58:56.670 --> 58:57.170]  Tucker.
[58:59.150 --> 58:59.650]  Tucker.
[59:03.550 --> 59:04.110]  Okay.
[59:04.110 --> 59:09.230]  So, we're gonna stay really close to this area.
[59:09.230 --> 59:11.710]  If anybody knows Tucker, what's Tucker's last name?
[59:12.750 --> 59:13.470]  Johnson.
[59:13.470 --> 59:16.190]  Tucker Johnson from where?
[59:17.550 --> 59:18.050]  Okay.
[59:18.370 --> 59:18.870]  Barberville?
[59:21.810 --> 59:22.610]  Thank you very much.
[59:36.930 --> 59:37.730]  You ready, Daniel?
[59:41.810 --> 59:43.330]  The Jadam General, everybody.
[59:43.570 --> 59:45.330]  And at your service.
[59:46.850 --> 59:51.570]  Which, you know, with the price of inputs, you know, it seems like everyone's gonna be
[59:51.570 --> 59:53.090]  hit at that route, you know.
[59:53.970 --> 59:55.970]  I'm about to go get a truckload of mistletoe.
[59:55.970 --> 59:57.650]  I'm excited for the high phosphorus.
[59:59.890 --> 01:00:06.130]  Yeah, it's fun working the lines and I like to grow for like production for like commercial farm,
[01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:07.890]  like an F3 to F6.
[01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:12.130]  And I've seen some F3s that are really stable and I've seen some F4s that aren't.
[01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:19.090]  But stable enough to blend and, you know, Moon Gazers here, they're, you know, they're
[01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:23.650]  doing some smaller batches stuff, which is also kind of like, it could be a niche market
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:24.370]  trend anyway.
[01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:28.850]  Like, I know like smaller batches are easy to work with and we're gonna see what that's
[01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.570]  like when we're going some shoe F1s in a few years, you know.
[01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.650]  They're gonna see, that's gonna be fun, you know.
[01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:38.130]  I have the Velvet Coffee I'm gonna be starting, which is, you know, not, you know, but two
[01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.610]  stable lines bred in together.
[01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:41.650]  I'm excited for that.
[01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:49.490]  And I also breed a lot of auto flowers and bat cross into that with the photo periods.
[01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:53.250]  And so we're getting the, here you go.
[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:53.890]  What Nick said.
[01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:58.050]  I'm just gonna just repeat what Jesse said.
[01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:59.810]  I fucking love polyhybrids.
[01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:04.770]  Testing, testing.
[01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:08.450]  I just absolutely love polyhybrids too.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:15.730]  Yeah, I guess, yeah, I didn't know about cloning them, but I just love to find them and breed
[01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:18.210]  them and then just kind of do the whole cycle again.
[01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:23.570]  We keep our males pretty close, like just far enough and downwind.
[01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:30.530]  So I love each, every, each of our 600 plants to have like one seed in it.
[01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:35.890]  So if I find some pheno that I didn't breed, I can just, I'll plant that.
[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.970]  And if it's a male, I'll use it.
[01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.130]  If it's a female, I'll definitely seed it up.
[01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.050]  That's it.
[01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:44.930]  Sweet.
[01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:45.430]  Yeah.
[01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:52.370]  I'm like, if you're looking for hash, if you're looking for the best hash varieties, you got to
[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:58.930]  go find the polyhybrids and look at the back stock, the lineage in there and all the stuff
[01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.730]  should be from other hash varieties too.
[01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:07.330]  So, so yeah, yay for polyhybrids.
[01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:09.250]  We should never like look down on that.
[01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.530]  Yay for inbred lines.
[01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:11.570]  We love them.
[01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.010]  Yay for the back crosses.
[01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:20.210]  We could get into that and I have a whole, my own kind of way of back crossing, but back to
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.690]  generation, even next generation.
[01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:25.170]  But anyway, thanks.
[01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:25.970]  Thanks for listening.
[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.650]  You guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.090]  Thanks for coming out, everybody.
[01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.010]  Dempere panel.
[01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:38.690]  So, for us at our booths, you know, we're hanging out, come talk.
[01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:41.730]  There's a lot to talk about.
[01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:50.310]  Feel the light.
