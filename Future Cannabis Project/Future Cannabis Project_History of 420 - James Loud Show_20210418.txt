[00:00.320 --> 00:07.400]  It's epically beautiful outside in LA, although the wind has started whipping, but yeah, it's
[00:07.400 --> 00:10.320]  probably like 80 already or 75.
[00:10.320 --> 00:13.080]  Anyway, welcome everyone.
[00:13.080 --> 00:18.640]  It's gonna be a short and sweet 420 James Loud episode.
[00:18.640 --> 00:21.720]  Let me introduce the one and only Mr. James Loud.
[00:21.720 --> 00:25.680]  Hey, how's it going everybody?
[00:25.680 --> 00:26.920]  Thanks for tuning in this week.
[00:26.920 --> 00:30.880]  We're just gonna keep it short and simple and talk about some fun stuff.
[00:30.880 --> 00:35.280]  So Peter and I, we're gonna do some Q&A with everybody and some giveaways in a little bit,
[00:35.280 --> 00:41.160]  but I first wanted to start talking about 420 and the history of 420.
[00:41.160 --> 00:48.120]  And so I guess let's see with everybody that's tuning in, how many people who got tuned in
[00:48.120 --> 00:49.120]  Peter?
[00:49.120 --> 00:51.440]  It keeps going up.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.960]  It just said 14.
[00:53.960 --> 00:54.960]  Now it says 20.
[00:54.960 --> 00:55.960]  Okay.
[00:55.960 --> 00:58.480]  Yeah, no, that's okay.
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.600]  So yeah, we're gonna start off talking about 420 and we'll do a little contest here.
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.600]  Who knows what...
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.600]  32.
[01:06.600 --> 01:07.600]  32.
[01:07.600 --> 01:09.520]  We got 32 people logged in here.
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.680]  So where did 420 originate?
[01:12.680 --> 01:19.240]  And if you get that right, you're gonna get a pack of seeds sent to the house.
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.960]  By which of the two guys, who do they need to hold responsible for that promise?
[01:24.960 --> 01:26.680]  Peter, you're gonna have to send those out.
[01:26.680 --> 01:28.240]  Ah, fuck you.
[01:28.240 --> 01:29.400]  Actually, you know what?
[01:29.400 --> 01:30.400]  They can email me.
[01:30.400 --> 01:31.400]  They can email me.
[01:31.400 --> 01:32.400]  We'll do it simple.
[01:32.400 --> 01:34.840]  Go ahead and email me and then yeah, we'll take it off.
[01:34.840 --> 01:36.480]  Peter, he does a lot.
[01:36.480 --> 01:39.220]  Someone said it's a police code.
[01:39.220 --> 01:41.000]  Someone said a college.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.000]  We're getting closer.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.040]  School yard, kids meeting at 420.
[01:44.040 --> 01:46.640]  Yes, but where in the world did that happen?
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.640]  That's the question.
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.640]  Where did it happen?
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.400]  School yard in Marin County, California, 1971.
[01:54.400 --> 01:56.600]  Somebody Googled that, I guarantee you.
[01:56.600 --> 02:02.920]  But that is XXEliteGPXX.
[02:02.920 --> 02:03.960]  So this is correct.
[02:03.960 --> 02:09.120]  So there's been a lot of rumors about 420, how it originated, what it actually means.
[02:09.120 --> 02:16.760]  If it's a penal code used by the law enforcement or a scanner code and that is absolutely not
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.320]  true.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.440]  It was the old Earth Day, if you didn't know that.
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.960]  420 used to be Earth Day, but it's also Adolf Hitler's birthday and the anniversary of Columbine.
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.320]  So there's a lot of bad association with it as well as the good.
[02:30.320 --> 02:37.320]  But in 1971, a group of people called the Waldos that were in high school in Marin County,
[02:37.320 --> 02:44.840]  they basically were looking for a grow in Northern California and they would meet at,
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.280]  I think it was the water fountain.
[02:46.280 --> 02:49.880]  They would meet at 420 and then they had a treasure map and they would go out and look
[02:49.880 --> 02:51.640]  for a cannabis field.
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.160]  And so that, I think it was originally called 420 Luis or Louis or something like that.
[02:57.160 --> 03:01.160]  And then they changed it to just 420 and then it kind of stuck.
[03:01.160 --> 03:07.560]  And Steve Hager from High Times, he's the one who really kind of made it famous, started
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.840]  talking about it in 1991, which was 20 years after it originated.
[03:11.840 --> 03:13.640]  And that's when I heard about it in school.
[03:13.640 --> 03:16.600]  It was like code for going to smoke weed.
[03:16.600 --> 03:21.520]  And the other one I just heard from one of my friends today was chemical compounds within
[03:21.520 --> 03:22.880]  a resin gland.
[03:22.880 --> 03:28.460]  There was a rumor that there was 420 chemicals within a resin gland, chemical compounds.
[03:28.460 --> 03:29.960]  Not true either.
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.080]  So yeah, so that's the 420 story, the Waldos.
[03:34.080 --> 03:37.680]  And I know a lot about the Waldos because of Lagunitas.
[03:37.680 --> 03:45.560]  So Lagunitas Brewery, I worked with Lagunitas for the last, since 2004, so almost 20 years.
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.000]  We used to do a 420 party every Tuesday, the first of the month, there'd be a 420 party
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.380]  at Lagunitas.
[03:52.380 --> 03:53.380]  This is pre Heineken.
[03:53.380 --> 03:56.240]  This is over the last like 15 years.
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.620]  And I was a chef for the beer circus at Lagunitas.
[04:00.620 --> 04:05.060]  So I traveled around with like the Vodovir Society, who has the most amazing acrobats
[04:05.340 --> 04:09.660]  and circus performers and stage performers, just amazing people.
[04:09.660 --> 04:12.100]  And we did the traveling beer circus.
[04:12.100 --> 04:15.020]  It started in 2009.
[04:15.020 --> 04:16.500]  And I was the backstage chef.
[04:16.500 --> 04:17.500]  So I did the backstage.
[04:17.500 --> 04:18.780]  I just, it was part of my summer.
[04:18.780 --> 04:23.220]  We'd do it every year up until before COVID was my last year doing it.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.940]  I did over 10 of them.
[04:24.940 --> 04:25.940]  It was a lot of fun.
[04:25.940 --> 04:28.260]  And we traveled all around the United States.
[04:28.260 --> 04:33.580]  Before that, it started in Petaluma, originally at the brewery, and then moved to the fairgrounds.
[04:33.580 --> 04:37.660]  And so my explanation, the reason why I'm telling you guys this is because Lagunitas,
[04:37.660 --> 04:39.740]  they have a beer called the Waldo's.
[04:39.740 --> 04:42.860]  If you enjoy beer, it's an amazing beer.
[04:42.860 --> 04:45.260]  Yeah, Lagunitas.
[04:45.260 --> 04:46.260]  Somebody said Lagunitas.
[04:46.260 --> 04:49.420]  That was one of my strains for Lagunitas.
[04:49.420 --> 04:55.700]  Lagunitas was a OG Kush crossed with a Afgu.
[04:55.700 --> 04:58.540]  That was made like over 10 years ago as well.
[04:58.540 --> 05:01.780]  So yeah, and Lagunitas started in Marin.
[05:01.980 --> 05:04.980]  Tony, he's an amazing guy.
[05:04.980 --> 05:09.580]  And Ron Lindenbush, who was the second employee, who's one of my really good friends.
[05:09.580 --> 05:15.980]  They took a company from, Tony started in his garage and turned his small garage into
[05:15.980 --> 05:19.660]  a billion dollar company over time.
[05:19.660 --> 05:21.900]  Living the American dream.
[05:21.900 --> 05:26.100]  So someone said their Czech style is amazing.
[05:26.100 --> 05:28.580]  Beer is very much like cannabis, is very subjective.
[05:28.580 --> 05:35.300]  There's lots of different styles of beer, but it's more similar to wine, I feel, than
[05:35.300 --> 05:37.100]  cannabis in some ways.
[05:37.100 --> 05:39.940]  But yeah, there's so many different brewers expressing the same stuff.
[05:39.940 --> 05:44.740]  So you'll get an IPA and it tastes 300 different ways that are all slightly different, kind
[05:44.740 --> 05:46.980]  of like gelato.
[05:46.980 --> 05:52.860]  But Peter, what's your history with 420?
[05:52.860 --> 05:54.580]  Caught you in the middle of a bite, but.
[05:54.780 --> 06:03.580]  Yeah, I'm eating roasted salted almonds with shells on, which is highly addictive.
[06:03.580 --> 06:04.580]  Amazing.
[06:04.580 --> 06:13.740]  I've never, I mean, obviously smoking weed with friends, but I've never been like.
[06:13.740 --> 06:20.460]  There's never been like a build up for me to 420 as some sort of special day.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.460]  Really?
[06:21.460 --> 06:25.820]  So even throughout the last 20 years, 420 hasn't meant like you didn't go out and party
[06:25.820 --> 06:28.060]  on 420 and smoke weed with your friends?
[06:28.060 --> 06:35.980]  No, I would, but that's kind of mostly because everybody's having parties and doing right.
[06:35.980 --> 06:40.100]  Not that I was like leading the charge of like 420 is coming.
[06:40.100 --> 06:42.140]  Like I'm so amped up.
[06:42.140 --> 06:43.460]  What are you doing for 420?
[06:43.460 --> 06:44.460]  Totally.
[06:44.460 --> 06:51.980]  I would say that within recreational since like more so Pat in the 2000s than the 90s,
[06:51.980 --> 06:58.300]  but 2000s we really started doing 420 parties and then with recreational and legalization,
[06:58.300 --> 07:01.220]  420 is really like been a big deal.
[07:01.220 --> 07:09.020]  You know, I mean the last 10 years, especially, you know, 420 when Denver and Colorado got
[07:09.020 --> 07:10.700]  legal, the 420 was amazing.
[07:10.700 --> 07:13.100]  That's when High Times did their event there.
[07:13.100 --> 07:14.100]  Good times.
[07:14.740 --> 07:20.020]  I remember the 710 cup, which was partially at Adam's spot, right?
[07:20.020 --> 07:22.460]  Like six years ago or something like that.
[07:22.460 --> 07:24.500]  I don't remember when it was, but yeah.
[07:24.500 --> 07:25.500]  Oh yeah.
[07:25.500 --> 07:28.940]  If you guys want to catch the Adam Dunn show, I'll be on there sometime.
[07:28.940 --> 07:33.700]  He's doing a 24 hour episode for 420, so should be interesting.
[07:33.700 --> 07:36.380]  Yeah, I can't wait.
[07:36.380 --> 07:40.940]  Adam now he has some crazy stuff going on on 420.
[07:40.980 --> 07:45.100]  Yeah, so he's doing a 24 hour marathon.
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.100]  Exciting stuff.
[07:46.100 --> 07:48.340]  Happy 420 everybody.
[07:48.340 --> 07:53.300]  Seeing a lot of 420 and good vibes in the chat.
[07:53.300 --> 07:58.940]  I mean, every state was at some point an anti-cannabis state.
[07:58.940 --> 07:59.940]  Yeah.
[07:59.940 --> 08:06.620]  I would say most states, even though they're recreational, they're still anti-cannabis
[08:06.620 --> 08:07.620]  for the most part.
[08:07.620 --> 08:15.020]  I think that's slowly changing, but someone says, too bad 420 girls are ratchet.
[08:15.020 --> 08:18.380]  Well, they're not all ratchet.
[08:18.380 --> 08:21.060]  You can't just generalize.
[08:21.060 --> 08:25.740]  But anyway, Peter, too cool for 420.
[08:25.740 --> 08:26.740]  Maybe.
[08:26.740 --> 08:29.620]  I wouldn't say too cool.
[08:29.620 --> 08:33.940]  I'd just say, yeah, I don't know.
[08:33.940 --> 08:36.620]  It's indifference maybe.
[08:37.620 --> 08:41.060]  Yeah, so what is everybody doing for their 420?
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.100]  Let us know.
[08:43.100 --> 08:46.580]  With COVID, it really killed 420 last year.
[08:46.580 --> 08:49.180]  Luckily, we're able to start having parties.
[08:49.180 --> 08:54.860]  Marlon Asher, my good friend Marlon, will be up in Humboldt performing at the Arcata
[08:54.860 --> 08:56.420]  Civic Center, I believe.
[08:56.420 --> 08:57.700]  Are you going to go?
[08:57.700 --> 09:00.860]  I want to go, but I'm so busy with stuff.
[09:00.860 --> 09:04.540]  I'm helping build out a grow right now.
[09:04.540 --> 09:08.940]  Small seed production grow should be a lot of fun stuff.
[09:08.940 --> 09:13.060]  You always think when you're building out rooms, and this has happened throughout history
[09:13.060 --> 09:17.540]  for the last 25 years, that it's only going to take this long, and then it takes almost
[09:17.540 --> 09:18.820]  double every time.
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.540]  If you think it's going to take two months, it might take four months.
[09:21.540 --> 09:26.140]  If you think it's going to take six weeks, it might take 12 weeks.
[09:26.140 --> 09:29.460]  I feel like I'm so much better at designing rooms now for that kind of stuff.
[09:29.460 --> 09:33.020]  Chad has a question for you.
[09:33.020 --> 09:38.660]  You've all done stupid 420 things, like dressing up as a leaf, smoking five joints at a time,
[09:38.660 --> 09:40.100]  or a two-gram dab in the head.
[09:40.100 --> 09:47.060]  What's the dumbest, most 420 thing James has done for 420?
[09:47.060 --> 09:51.580]  I think we smoked ounces and ounces and ounces before.
[09:51.580 --> 09:53.260]  I think we smoked a quarter pound.
[09:53.260 --> 09:55.540]  It's probably the craziest thing.
[09:55.540 --> 10:01.020]  It's not that crazy, but there was only four of us.
[10:01.460 --> 10:05.460]  We get together and we get really high every 420, whether it's dabbing.
[10:05.460 --> 10:07.900]  Then we always bring out the old glass.
[10:07.900 --> 10:09.620]  For us, it's not that crazy.
[10:09.620 --> 10:14.860]  Let's see if I can get my glass case.
[10:14.860 --> 10:16.780]  We've got glass.
[10:16.780 --> 10:17.780]  That whole case is filled.
[10:17.780 --> 10:20.260]  You want to zoom in on it?
[10:20.260 --> 10:25.500]  There's glass, cannabis cups, all kinds of fun stuff in there.
[10:25.500 --> 10:30.660]  I really like to get high on 420, and every other day as well.
[10:30.660 --> 10:35.940]  I would say 420 is definitely the day you end up smoking a bunch of weed with your friends.
[10:35.940 --> 10:37.220]  We bust out all the old glass.
[10:37.220 --> 10:42.900]  I got some old chem dog pieces, Jerome Baker, stuff that I keep clean and only smoke pretty
[10:42.900 --> 10:45.860]  much on 420.
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.180]  That's about it.
[10:47.180 --> 10:50.460]  We have some glue auto and juice box finishing up drying right now.
[10:50.460 --> 10:52.100]  Might have some to test on Tuesday.
[10:52.100 --> 10:53.380]  I think that's amazing.
[10:53.380 --> 10:55.380]  I'd love to test some on Tuesday.
[10:55.380 --> 11:02.500]  Yeah, sushi, good cannabis is perfect for 420.
[11:02.500 --> 11:03.980]  Yeah, sushi is great.
[11:03.980 --> 11:04.980]  Love sushi.
[11:04.980 --> 11:07.860]  I eat sushi a lot, probably more than I should.
[11:07.860 --> 11:14.060]  I would say my mercury levels are probably pretty high.
[11:14.060 --> 11:15.060]  Smoking one pounders.
[11:15.060 --> 11:17.020]  Yeah, we used to roll really big joints.
[11:17.020 --> 11:21.460]  I kind of miss doing all that stuff.
[11:21.540 --> 11:24.100]  Shout out to chem dog, 420 will never be the same.
[11:24.100 --> 11:28.300]  Man, it's like chem dog, the Grateful Dead, those things have impacted cannabis.
[11:28.300 --> 11:33.540]  There's a bunch of things that have impacted cannabis heavily to where it changed cannabis
[11:33.540 --> 11:36.620]  to where it's different today because of it.
[11:36.620 --> 11:42.700]  I think most people will never even know the profound effects of chem dog and him finding
[11:42.700 --> 11:43.700]  those bag seeds.
[11:43.700 --> 11:48.380]  That's just, it's something profound that changed the industry permanently.
[11:48.380 --> 11:53.660]  You could even say Girl Scout cookies and you can take that step back, one step back
[11:53.660 --> 11:59.780]  further and go Durban poison, how that changed cannabis.
[11:59.780 --> 12:01.520]  These things are profound.
[12:01.520 --> 12:04.860]  It's like you think of the butterfly effect of something like that.
[12:04.860 --> 12:05.860]  Pretty wild.
[12:05.860 --> 12:08.460]  Oh yeah, we got some acid gas auto seeds.
[12:08.460 --> 12:11.980]  Can't wait to see pictures of those, some slurlato.
[12:11.980 --> 12:17.740]  I guess let's do a 420 trivia.
[12:17.740 --> 12:23.410]  Got any trivia questions, Peter?
[12:23.410 --> 12:29.730]  I have zero trivia questions, but we can, give me a minute to think about it.
[12:29.730 --> 12:36.450]  Yeah, see we can type, I mean just off the top of my head, when did, this isn't 420,
[12:36.450 --> 12:40.010]  but how about we got a question about California legalization?
[12:40.010 --> 12:43.370]  What year, and don't look this up guys, off the top of your head.
[12:43.370 --> 12:45.050]  I know somebody knows it.
[12:45.050 --> 12:52.210]  What year did medical cannabis go legal in California?
[12:52.210 --> 12:54.850]  Yep, soul seeker.
[12:54.850 --> 12:57.410]  That was like almost before I said it.
[12:57.410 --> 12:58.950]  1996.
[12:58.950 --> 12:59.950]  You get a pack of seeds.
[12:59.950 --> 13:01.610]  We're going to be like Oprah today.
[13:01.610 --> 13:04.730]  You get a pack of seeds and you get a pack of seeds.
[13:04.730 --> 13:11.130]  Since we're not doing a show on 420, we're going to kind of do some fun stuff today.
[13:11.130 --> 13:13.930]  Some college kids who met at 420 after class.
[13:14.010 --> 13:15.730]  Yeah, we already settled that one.
[13:15.730 --> 13:18.890]  It was high school kids, not college kids.
[13:18.890 --> 13:22.450]  I think some people start the stream after other people.
[13:22.450 --> 13:23.810]  Totally.
[13:23.810 --> 13:25.890]  But they're in the same live chat.
[13:25.890 --> 13:27.690]  Oh yeah, that's awesome.
[13:27.690 --> 13:28.690]  Thank you.
[13:28.690 --> 13:32.770]  Well yeah, thank you guys for all tuning in.
[13:32.770 --> 13:35.690]  Hey, someone was born in 96.
[13:35.690 --> 13:39.330]  Good job.
[13:39.330 --> 13:40.330]  Two years before-
[13:40.330 --> 13:41.330]  You're just a baby.
[13:41.330 --> 13:42.330]  Yeah.
[13:42.330 --> 13:43.330]  Man.
[13:43.730 --> 13:52.970]  I got a- or I didn't get a DWI, but I had to go through the court system to not get
[13:52.970 --> 13:56.450]  the DWI.
[13:56.450 --> 14:04.170]  I remember I was in the court with this panel of guys who were evaluating me.
[14:04.170 --> 14:10.010]  I know, sorry, this was the part to get my license back.
[14:10.050 --> 14:12.890]  I think one of them said something funny and I started laughing.
[14:12.890 --> 14:15.610]  He's like, why, what are you laughing about?
[14:15.610 --> 14:17.610]  You're just a baby.
[14:17.610 --> 14:24.360]  I was like-
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.600]  Born in 96, been growing since 09.
[14:26.600 --> 14:29.400]  What does that mean?
[14:29.400 --> 14:30.400]  You've been growing since you were 13.
[14:30.400 --> 14:33.240]  Some older people too.
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.680]  I love it when people are like, I was growing when I was six.
[14:38.680 --> 14:39.680]  There's people that have done that.
[14:40.200 --> 14:43.040]  You grow up in a family where it's part of your thing.
[14:43.040 --> 14:44.400]  That wasn't my family.
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.840]  My parents were not growing weed when I was a kid.
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.880]  I have other family members that were into some interesting stuff.
[14:51.880 --> 14:53.920]  Happy Birds born in 73.
[14:53.920 --> 14:54.920]  Nice.
[14:54.920 --> 14:55.920]  I'm 76.
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.120]  You were born in 76.
[14:59.120 --> 15:00.680]  I was born in 77.
[15:00.680 --> 15:02.640]  We're old as fuck.
[15:02.640 --> 15:04.920]  That's just how it goes.
[15:04.920 --> 15:07.280]  So guys, you want to talk about auto flowers for a little bit?
[15:07.280 --> 15:10.200]  I think that'd be a great topic.
[15:10.200 --> 15:16.120]  So we got Gelato Autos available through Daggadot Love and seeds here now on 420.
[15:16.120 --> 15:18.000]  We're going to be launching some stuff.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.800]  So you'll have the Ganja Farmer seed line, but you can get it today at Daggadot Love
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.600]  if you're interested.
[15:23.600 --> 15:29.520]  But auto flowers, you know, auto flowers are really special in my opinion and they've come
[15:29.520 --> 15:30.520]  a long ways.
[15:30.520 --> 15:36.200]  You know, if we look at the history of auto flowers, as far back as I can remember, auto
[15:36.200 --> 15:44.400]  flowers were a thing.
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.840]  That's not far off from my dad.
[15:45.840 --> 15:56.660]  He's only 12 years from there.
[15:57.100 --> 16:18.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:18.980 --> 16:19.980]  Perfect.
[16:19.980 --> 16:24.100]  But yeah, so auto flowers, if you look back in the day, there was the Mexican Rudy and
[16:24.100 --> 16:27.580]  then we had the early girl, my earliest.
[16:27.580 --> 16:30.620]  76 isn't old.
[16:30.620 --> 16:33.020]  Oh yeah, that's even older.
[16:33.020 --> 16:34.940]  Well, it's the 1956.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.140]  I feel old.
[16:36.140 --> 16:37.140]  That's all.
[16:37.140 --> 16:38.860]  You know, I was born in 77.
[16:38.860 --> 16:40.920]  Lots of prickweed and consumed in 76.
[16:40.920 --> 16:41.920]  Not for me.
[16:41.920 --> 16:43.780]  I was not born yet.
[16:43.780 --> 16:45.460]  But do I have cat piss seeds?
[16:45.460 --> 16:50.620]  I got cat piss seeds from 707 Seed Bank that I'm testing now and I'll let you guys know
[16:50.620 --> 16:52.740]  if it's what I would consider cat piss.
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.700]  We're doing a cat piss cup this summer.
[16:54.700 --> 16:58.980]  Adam Dunn and I will be announcing stuff shortly.
[16:58.980 --> 17:05.220]  But getting back to the auto flowers, the early auto flowers had a very hay-like smell.
[17:05.220 --> 17:06.460]  They didn't grow very tall.
[17:06.460 --> 17:07.460]  Maybe one foot.
[17:07.460 --> 17:12.460]  I saw stuff that was like 18 inches tall, but it was just like really, really terrible
[17:12.460 --> 17:13.460]  structure.
[17:13.460 --> 17:16.180]  You know, node spacing was bad.
[17:16.180 --> 17:19.380]  It was loose bud and it was low.
[17:19.420 --> 17:24.860]  I've seen hot hemp test higher than the Mexican Rudy stuff that was going back in the day.
[17:24.860 --> 17:30.860]  The early varieties that we had, they were all just funky.
[17:30.860 --> 17:33.380]  You know, the early girl, all that stuff.
[17:33.380 --> 17:38.740]  But as time progressed and people started breeding them and working these genetics,
[17:38.740 --> 17:39.740]  they got better.
[17:39.740 --> 17:42.860]  I saw stuff in 2012 that I still wasn't impressed with.
[17:42.860 --> 17:48.020]  And then I saw Mephisto Genetics through my friend, Open Source.
[17:48.020 --> 17:51.580]  Game changer as far as genetics.
[17:51.580 --> 17:54.580]  The stuff Mephisto has done.
[17:54.580 --> 17:56.180]  Been growing on Guam.
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.940]  We like that.
[17:57.940 --> 17:58.940]  Low Rider.
[17:58.940 --> 18:01.980]  Yeah, Low Rider was still, that wasn't where it was at.
[18:01.980 --> 18:06.100]  I feel like Low Rider had been worked and it was an improvement, but it was still very
[18:06.100 --> 18:07.100]  hay-like.
[18:07.100 --> 18:09.260]  Low THC.
[18:09.260 --> 18:13.300]  Not what I would consider a viable plant to breed with necessarily.
[18:13.300 --> 18:17.180]  I mean, somebody had to believe in it that much that they kept working it.
[18:17.180 --> 18:23.460]  And those guys at Mephisto, complete game changers when it comes to auto flower.
[18:23.460 --> 18:29.620]  They definitely have their place in history for making stuff that's amazing.
[18:29.620 --> 18:33.860]  I've worked some of their lines, working some of their lines right now, doing other stuff,
[18:33.860 --> 18:34.940]  breeding with some of their stuff.
[18:34.940 --> 18:42.820]  I think they actually, as far as testing, that's when we started seeing stuff that tested
[18:42.820 --> 18:46.020]  at 18% THC, 20% THC.
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.020]  I've heard at 25.
[18:47.020 --> 18:53.020]  I've seen, I just had some of my own stuff test at an independent laboratory for 30%
[18:53.020 --> 18:55.780]  THC and 31% THC.
[18:55.780 --> 19:01.980]  And we're going to be testing that independently at other laboratories against it.
[19:01.980 --> 19:07.020]  But seeing stuff, even if they're off by 4%, 26% is ridiculous.
[19:07.020 --> 19:10.700]  That's grown under HPS indoors.
[19:10.700 --> 19:17.420]  Someone wants to know when we're going to do a show on Skunk.
[19:17.420 --> 19:19.260]  Daz is an amazing auto breeder.
[19:19.260 --> 19:23.260]  Not sure he's still with Mephisto, but I also released his...
[19:23.260 --> 19:26.500]  Yeah, Night Owl Seeds, he's doing some interesting stuff.
[19:26.500 --> 19:27.500]  He's a character.
[19:27.500 --> 19:30.260]  But yeah, I mean, I haven't worked any of Daz's stuff.
[19:30.260 --> 19:34.500]  I've worked Mephisto's gear and those dudes, they know what's up.
[19:34.500 --> 19:37.900]  They got to get credit for taking auto flowers to that next level.
[19:37.900 --> 19:43.280]  There was a point where auto flowers were undesirable and then they became desirable
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.340]  and you got to give Mephisto credit for that, doing the real work.
[19:47.340 --> 19:50.780]  And I think a lot of people, you can buy two auto flowers and breed them together and make
[19:50.780 --> 19:57.380]  another auto flower, but to actually do the work, that takes time.
[19:57.380 --> 20:01.420]  You're talking about taking an auto flower to a photo period and then taking that photo
[20:01.420 --> 20:05.460]  period, which is like regular full-term photo period.
[20:05.460 --> 20:08.260]  You take those two and cross them together, you don't get an auto flower.
[20:08.260 --> 20:11.140]  And I think there's a lot of confusing stuff around that.
[20:11.140 --> 20:13.540]  People think, oh, you just cross it and then you get auto flowers.
[20:13.540 --> 20:15.460]  No, that's not the case.
[20:15.460 --> 20:16.980]  I hear this time and time again.
[20:16.980 --> 20:23.920]  Auto flower, you have to actually take through that original F1 cross, then you cross those
[20:24.040 --> 20:27.840]  two again together, or you cross it back to the auto parent.
[20:27.840 --> 20:32.600]  And then within that next generation, they start expressing auto flower.
[20:32.600 --> 20:38.120]  It's a recessive trait, so it takes two plants together with both of that trait to express
[20:38.120 --> 20:39.120]  it.
[20:39.120 --> 20:44.560]  And then what happens is by the F3, you should have the majority of your stuff expressing
[20:44.560 --> 20:45.560]  auto flower.
[20:45.560 --> 20:49.880]  And by F4, everything's expressing auto flower if you've done it correctly.
[20:49.880 --> 20:53.680]  My perspective was about 10 years ago when auto stops completely sucking.
[20:54.680 --> 20:59.600]  It was interesting, the stuff in Spain though, I wasn't super impressed with their auto flowers.
[20:59.600 --> 21:01.760]  This was 10 years ago.
[21:01.760 --> 21:06.560]  I really wasn't impressed and didn't see big auto flowers that yielded, that got really
[21:06.560 --> 21:07.560]  like...
[21:07.560 --> 21:12.640]  I mean, the Terps, they're starting at Terps and stuff 10 years ago, but really game changing.
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.280]  And now there's a handful of companies that produce really amazing high THC auto flowers.
[21:18.280 --> 21:19.280]  They have good structure.
[21:19.360 --> 21:23.200]  I mean, the stuff that I'm working with, you wouldn't even be able to tell that it was
[21:23.200 --> 21:24.920]  auto flower if it's grown correctly.
[21:24.920 --> 21:29.280]  I think it's sticky, it doesn't knuckle up.
[21:29.280 --> 21:35.420]  And I think that's one of the big things is these loose calyxes that stack and then they
[21:35.420 --> 21:36.520]  look like loose buds.
[21:36.520 --> 21:39.800]  It's a very typical auto flower structure.
[21:39.800 --> 21:42.520]  Steve Gonzales says he's not impressed with any autos.
[21:42.520 --> 21:45.120]  Well, I just...
[21:45.120 --> 21:47.240]  If you want to stay away from it, that's your choice.
[21:47.240 --> 21:55.280]  I think auto flowers, man, I think they have so much potential for so many things, especially
[21:55.280 --> 21:56.680]  large scale cultivation.
[21:56.680 --> 21:59.560]  You talk about places with monsoons.
[21:59.560 --> 22:01.160]  Auto flowers are a big game changer.
[22:01.160 --> 22:03.280]  And breeding auto flowers is something that takes time.
[22:03.280 --> 22:07.360]  So a lot of people don't want to put in the work.
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.000]  Dutch Passion auto flowers are popular here in Sweden.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  Yeah, I would agree.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.960]  Dutch Passion makes some good autos.
[22:13.960 --> 22:18.880]  I think they were one of the first seed companies that was making feminized seeds, if not the
[22:18.880 --> 22:24.800]  first in the 90s, very late 80s, early 90s.
[22:24.800 --> 22:30.080]  Hank, he's kind of responsible for the auto flowers.
[22:30.080 --> 22:33.760]  Who has unfeminized auto flower seeds?
[22:33.760 --> 22:36.000]  I don't know who has unfeminized auto flower seeds.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.000]  You can get them.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.520]  I don't work with unfeminized auto flowers.
[22:39.520 --> 22:42.920]  I tend to work with the feminized ones.
[22:42.920 --> 22:48.800]  I grew a bunch last year, but I got to find more of those seeds.
[22:48.800 --> 22:55.280]  Yeah, and the thing is, at scale, a lot of companies are not going to produce unfeminized
[22:55.280 --> 22:56.280]  seeds.
[22:56.280 --> 22:58.880]  There's not a huge demand for unfeminized seeds.
[22:58.880 --> 23:03.000]  The thing with seeds that aren't feminized at scale, you don't have to pull males.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.800]  I mean, it's just pretty straightforward.
[23:05.800 --> 23:12.120]  First decent auto flower I saw was in 2000, was Bubbleberry Ruderalis grown and bred in
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.320]  Maine.
[23:13.320 --> 23:14.320]  I never saw it.
[23:14.320 --> 23:20.120]  Stuff in 2000 wasn't looking pretty.
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.960]  If you don't like autos or you have no desire for it, that's up to you.
[23:24.960 --> 23:29.840]  You think of it as an agricultural product.
[23:29.840 --> 23:33.440]  It's so beneficial for doing stuff at scale.
[23:33.440 --> 23:37.120]  With crop steering, now you apply crop steering to auto flowers, and you're going to be able
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.440]  to do some badass shit.
[23:39.440 --> 23:43.520]  Just throwing them outside and feeding them water, you're not going to get great stuff.
[23:43.520 --> 23:49.320]  Once you start really dialing them in, run after run using the same variety, that's when
[23:49.320 --> 23:53.440]  you get some really interesting things happening like quality.
[23:53.440 --> 23:59.360]  That goes across the board with photo period, full term stuff as well, all the photo periodic
[23:59.360 --> 24:00.360]  stuff.
[24:00.360 --> 24:04.560]  Someone in Pineapple Glue crossed with Northern Lights, and they're exploding right now, and
[24:04.560 --> 24:06.480]  not even week six.
[24:07.080 --> 24:11.920]  Auto flowers generally take around 70 days for the normal auto flower, 70, 80 days.
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.920]  It depends on the season though.
[24:12.920 --> 24:16.560]  The colder they are, the slower they grow.
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.320]  If you put them in cold soil, I had some friends recently that got some seeds, and they put
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.640]  them in too early.
[24:23.640 --> 24:25.480]  What happens is they stunt them out.
[24:25.480 --> 24:33.300]  If that soil is cold, you end up with 12 inch, 8 to 16 inch plants that don't yield.
[24:33.300 --> 24:36.900]  You put them in right now, this time of year in California.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.340]  Really depends on where you are too.
[24:39.340 --> 24:44.380]  I feel like just because you're in one place and it's successful, you can take that same
[24:44.380 --> 24:50.180]  principle from California to Colorado, or California to Oregon or Washington, and it
[24:50.180 --> 24:54.460]  doesn't necessarily make sense to use the same methodology.
[24:54.460 --> 24:56.060]  You're going to have to do different stuff.
[24:56.060 --> 24:57.420]  You have different light cycles.
[24:57.420 --> 24:59.980]  Auto flower, you should be able to go 24 hours.
[24:59.980 --> 25:01.740]  It's not going to veg.
[25:01.740 --> 25:02.940]  It's not going to go back into veg.
[25:03.580 --> 25:05.180]  It's going to stay in flower regardless.
[25:05.180 --> 25:09.860]  That's how we breed them as well.
[25:09.860 --> 25:13.940]  Auto flowers are great.
[25:13.940 --> 25:18.240]  If you're in a monsoon area and you're talking about light depth, that makes no sense.
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.620]  You're trapping in all the frigging PM and all kinds of stuff.
[25:22.620 --> 25:27.820]  I would say that using autos, you don't have to tarp.
[25:27.820 --> 25:31.420]  For the monsoon season, it's perfect.
[25:32.420 --> 25:38.220]  Again, crop steering, looking at what you're feeding the plants, and collecting data.
[25:38.220 --> 25:42.660]  I think that's the biggest thing is collecting data, using that data to create a better product.
[25:42.660 --> 25:47.060]  Every time you run it, you get more data and you realize that maybe you want to push the
[25:47.060 --> 25:53.460]  PPM, EC a little bit higher when you're talking about your salts.
[25:53.460 --> 25:57.020]  If you're doing that, if you're going organic, maybe you want to switch stuff up.
[25:57.020 --> 26:00.460]  There's so many different ways you can do stuff.
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.740]  No flower, lives matter.
[26:01.740 --> 26:02.740]  I agree.
[26:02.740 --> 26:07.900]  Rob Clark, it's funny.
[26:07.900 --> 26:12.820]  Rob Clark is the authority on cannabis as far as I'm concerned.
[26:12.820 --> 26:16.820]  Rob Clark, he knows more than anybody, especially about cannabis history.
[26:16.820 --> 26:22.460]  He was making books that were amazing long before anybody else.
[26:22.460 --> 26:26.060]  I feel like his books to this day still hold a ton of knowledge.
[26:26.660 --> 26:31.340]  A lot of other books, the information has changed.
[26:31.340 --> 26:33.340]  Some of the information in his books has changed as well.
[26:33.340 --> 26:38.740]  I'd say for the most part, his has scientific backing to it.
[26:38.740 --> 26:40.620]  Just started using Arroyo sensors.
[26:40.620 --> 26:45.780]  Yeah, Arroyo, totally.
[26:45.780 --> 26:47.300]  Yep.
[26:47.300 --> 26:51.860]  I think using Arroyo, it just depends on what you're doing.
[26:51.860 --> 26:53.860]  Arroyo is amazing at scale.
[26:53.900 --> 26:55.900]  I don't think you'd want to use your...
[26:55.900 --> 26:59.020]  You wouldn't pay for a six lighter to use Arroyo.
[26:59.020 --> 27:03.660]  Trollmaster is another way you can start using Trollmaster to collect data.
[27:03.660 --> 27:09.100]  You can do that over time and then really understand what you're doing.
[27:09.100 --> 27:14.660]  Using light sensors, I think that's a big thing as far as light sensors are game changers.
[27:14.660 --> 27:17.660]  Yeah, going into the...
[27:17.660 --> 27:19.660]  Hi, James.
[27:19.660 --> 27:22.660]  Hey, how are you doing?
[27:23.460 --> 27:25.460]  Well, then everyone's going to hear the echo.
[27:25.460 --> 27:27.460]  But here, why don't you put that in?
[27:27.460 --> 27:29.460]  What kind of deep thought...
[27:29.460 --> 27:31.460]  What are you guys doing upstairs?
[27:31.460 --> 27:33.460]  You guys sound like you're...
[27:33.460 --> 27:37.460]  There's a lot of screeching and other stuff.
[27:37.460 --> 27:40.460]  Weird sounds I'm hearing.
[27:42.460 --> 27:44.460]  Just hanging out?
[27:44.460 --> 27:46.460]  I know. I made a bathing suit.
[27:46.460 --> 27:50.460]  You're making a bathing suit for one of your LOL dolls?
[27:50.460 --> 27:52.460]  Oh, nice. Okay.
[27:53.260 --> 27:55.260]  Carry on, James.
[27:55.260 --> 27:58.260]  Oh, so does your daughter have a trivia question for us?
[27:58.260 --> 28:00.260]  Ooh, Gemma, do you have...
[28:00.260 --> 28:02.260]  Actually, all right. So I'm going to have to...
[28:02.260 --> 28:04.260]  What is trivia?
[28:04.260 --> 28:08.260]  Trivia is where you ask everyone a question to see who answers first.
[28:08.260 --> 28:12.260]  So what kind of... Can you think of a fun question that...
[28:14.260 --> 28:16.260]  How about like a...
[28:16.260 --> 28:18.260]  How many kombuchas have you drunk in your whole life?
[28:18.260 --> 28:20.260]  Well, that's...
[28:21.060 --> 28:23.060]  That's a good question, but I don't even know the answer.
[28:23.060 --> 28:25.060]  That's a good question, but it's not a trivia question.
[28:25.060 --> 28:29.060]  A trivia question like... How about with princesses?
[28:29.060 --> 28:33.060]  Say, who's the princess who did something?
[28:33.060 --> 28:37.060]  How many princesses are there in the world?
[28:37.060 --> 28:39.060]  That's another tricky question.
[28:40.060 --> 28:42.060]  Wow.
[28:42.060 --> 28:48.060]  Can you think of a Moana question or an Elsa and Anna question?
[28:48.060 --> 28:50.060]  How old is Moana?
[28:50.860 --> 28:52.860]  In the movie?
[28:52.860 --> 28:54.860]  Do you know the answer? You got to know the answer.
[28:54.860 --> 28:56.860]  Just ask the question.
[28:56.860 --> 28:58.860]  Yeah, do you know the answer?
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.860]  How about Gemma say how old?
[29:00.860 --> 29:02.860]  Actually, we have a good question.
[29:02.860 --> 29:06.860]  You ready? So tell people what they're going to win if they answer this question.
[29:06.860 --> 29:08.860]  You're going to win a pack of seeds.
[29:08.860 --> 29:12.260]  Okay.
[29:12.260 --> 29:14.260]  How old am I?
[29:14.260 --> 29:16.260]  Ooh.
[29:16.260 --> 29:18.260]  Okay, first person to get that.
[29:18.260 --> 29:20.260]  There's a very narrow range of possibilities.
[29:21.060 --> 29:23.060]  I'm not nine. I'm not five.
[29:23.060 --> 29:25.060]  Okay, do you see this? Nine, five.
[29:25.060 --> 29:29.060]  Oh, I think Graham White answered it correctly.
[29:29.060 --> 29:33.060]  Six? Okay, you get a free pack of seeds.
[29:33.060 --> 29:35.060]  Nice.
[29:35.060 --> 29:37.060]  Congratulations.
[29:37.060 --> 29:39.060]  Say, but don't send them crap.
[29:39.060 --> 29:41.060]  But don't send them crap.
[29:41.060 --> 29:45.060]  That's a good idea.
[29:45.060 --> 29:47.060]  Go play.
[29:47.860 --> 29:49.860]  Excellent.
[29:51.860 --> 29:55.860]  Well, guys, back to some autoflower chat.
[29:55.860 --> 29:59.860]  So, yeah, warm root zones are essential.
[29:59.860 --> 30:01.860]  Putting them out too early, you know,
[30:01.860 --> 30:05.860]  I think a lot of people think you can run them as a winter crop.
[30:05.860 --> 30:07.860]  And that's difficult.
[30:07.860 --> 30:09.860]  You have lower light, for one thing,
[30:09.860 --> 30:11.860]  in autoflowers, the more light, the better.
[30:13.860 --> 30:15.860]  So, commercial scale cultivars,
[30:16.660 --> 30:18.660]  such as CannaCraft,
[30:18.660 --> 30:20.660]  Craft Growers,
[30:20.660 --> 30:24.660]  What are your thoughts on commercial scale cultivators,
[30:24.660 --> 30:26.660]  such as CannaCraft,
[30:26.660 --> 30:28.660]  beating Craft Growers at the Emerald Cup this year?
[30:28.660 --> 30:30.660]  I have no opinion on that.
[30:32.660 --> 30:34.660]  You know, I think CannaCraft,
[30:34.660 --> 30:36.660]  actually, I have a lot of respect for CannaCraft
[30:36.660 --> 30:38.660]  and what they've done.
[30:38.660 --> 30:40.660]  So, regardless of commercial scale,
[30:40.660 --> 30:42.660]  I think Dennis and Ned and those guys,
[30:42.660 --> 30:44.660]  Dennis is a freedom fighter.
[30:45.460 --> 30:47.460]  He's said F you to the man more than once.
[30:49.460 --> 30:51.460]  And he's been fighting the good fight
[30:51.460 --> 30:53.460]  for a long time,
[30:53.460 --> 30:55.460]  as far as, you know.
[30:55.460 --> 30:57.460]  Anyway, I have no opinion on them
[30:57.460 --> 30:59.460]  beating out the small guys,
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.460]  you know, the craft farmers.
[31:03.460 --> 31:06.790]  How many?
[31:06.790 --> 31:08.790]  I don't have an answer,
[31:08.790 --> 31:10.790]  but you know who I would talk to
[31:10.790 --> 31:12.790]  is Ramsey from Aroya.
[31:13.590 --> 31:15.590]  You can hit him up online.
[31:15.590 --> 31:17.590]  Ask him about the micromoles for autos.
[31:21.590 --> 31:23.590]  In fact, I've been talking to a couple guys
[31:23.590 --> 31:25.590]  about how we can get in this future cannabis project.
[31:25.590 --> 31:27.590]  Does James have an Instagram?
[31:27.590 --> 31:29.590]  Yeah, it's James Loud.
[31:29.590 --> 31:31.590]  Just go to James Loud.
[31:31.590 --> 31:33.590]  That's my account.
[31:33.590 --> 31:35.590]  Yeah.
[31:35.590 --> 31:37.590]  Follow me on there.
[31:37.590 --> 31:39.590]  I might follow you back.
[31:39.590 --> 31:41.590]  We're getting lots of follows.
[31:42.390 --> 31:44.390]  Let's go.
[31:44.390 --> 31:46.390]  He had a surgery.
[31:48.390 --> 31:50.390]  So, grow autos in ground, outdoors,
[31:50.390 --> 31:52.390]  under sun.
[31:52.390 --> 31:54.390]  I think you can do both.
[31:54.390 --> 31:56.390]  I see guys getting results
[31:56.390 --> 31:58.390]  doing greenhouse, indoor, and outdoor.
[31:58.390 --> 32:00.390]  I think it's really depending on what you're doing for.
[32:00.390 --> 32:02.390]  I think autos
[32:02.390 --> 32:04.390]  are best grown,
[32:04.390 --> 32:06.390]  best used outdoors.
[32:06.390 --> 32:08.390]  But if you think of putting 20 hours of light
[32:08.390 --> 32:10.390]  with something indoors, you can crush.
[32:11.190 --> 32:13.190]  Again, we started talking about
[32:13.190 --> 32:15.190]  crop steering and working
[32:15.190 --> 32:17.190]  through multiple cycles
[32:17.190 --> 32:19.190]  to optimize the varieties.
[32:19.190 --> 32:21.190]  Does the reversal plant
[32:21.190 --> 32:23.190]  carry more traits
[32:23.190 --> 32:25.190]  than the receiver plant?
[32:25.190 --> 32:27.190]  I used to think that.
[32:27.190 --> 32:29.190]  Then I think I've been
[32:29.190 --> 32:31.190]  shut down on this show before.
[32:31.190 --> 32:33.190]  So, as far as
[32:33.190 --> 32:35.190]  does the donor
[32:35.190 --> 32:37.190]  carry more traits
[32:37.190 --> 32:39.190]  or pass on more traits than the receiver?
[32:39.990 --> 32:41.990]  I think with regular breeding,
[32:41.990 --> 32:43.990]  I've observed it a lot more
[32:43.990 --> 32:45.990]  than with feminized breeding.
[32:45.990 --> 32:47.990]  But in feminized breeding,
[32:47.990 --> 32:49.990]  how about we got somebody
[32:49.990 --> 32:51.990]  watching on the show.
[32:51.990 --> 32:56.480]  Does anybody have an opinion on that?
[32:56.480 --> 32:58.480]  What's going to happen if you pollinate
[32:58.480 --> 33:00.480]  mother auto with non-auto strain,
[33:00.480 --> 33:02.480]  all progeny with auto, or some or neither?
[33:02.480 --> 33:04.480]  Now, this is what I was talking about.
[33:04.480 --> 33:06.480]  In that F1 generation,
[33:06.480 --> 33:08.480]  from an auto to a photo period,
[33:08.480 --> 33:10.480]  you cross those two things together.
[33:11.280 --> 33:13.280]  It's faster finishing
[33:13.280 --> 33:15.280]  that triggers faster.
[33:15.280 --> 33:17.280]  I would say
[33:17.280 --> 33:19.280]  you're going to end up with something more vigorous.
[33:19.280 --> 33:21.280]  Part of it is the genetic diversity,
[33:21.280 --> 33:23.280]  but also it has that
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.280]  auto flower gene.
[33:25.280 --> 33:27.280]  You need both parents to have that auto flower gene
[33:27.280 --> 33:29.280]  for it to express auto flower.
[33:29.280 --> 33:31.280]  It's not going to auto flower
[33:31.280 --> 33:33.280]  with your first generation.
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.280]  But then as you
[33:35.280 --> 33:37.280]  cross it in the inbred line,
[33:37.280 --> 33:39.280]  when you're crossing those generations,
[33:40.080 --> 33:42.080]  you're going to get them to auto flower.
[33:42.080 --> 33:44.080]  It takes time. You have to do selections.
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.080]  You have to breed with 24 hours of light
[33:46.080 --> 33:48.080]  so you can cull all the plants that don't auto flower.
[33:48.080 --> 33:50.080]  That's important.
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.080]  Basically,
[33:54.080 --> 33:56.080]  if you want to
[33:56.080 --> 33:58.080]  take an auto flower
[33:58.080 --> 34:00.080]  and you want to bring in some characteristics
[34:00.080 --> 34:02.080]  or traits from a photo period that you like,
[34:02.080 --> 34:04.080]  what's your process
[34:04.080 --> 34:06.080]  for getting it
[34:06.080 --> 34:08.080]  back to full auto?
[34:08.880 --> 34:10.880]  Step by step.
[34:10.880 --> 34:12.880]  It's super detailed.
[34:12.880 --> 34:14.880]  What you really need to do,
[34:14.880 --> 34:16.880]  besides collecting a lot of data,
[34:16.880 --> 34:18.880]  you have to have a good nose and know how to grow.
[34:18.880 --> 34:20.880]  Those are two important things.
[34:20.880 --> 34:22.880]  If you're a shitty grower
[34:22.880 --> 34:24.880]  and you're only working with a small population,
[34:24.880 --> 34:26.880]  the possibilities
[34:26.880 --> 34:28.880]  of you getting good auto flowers
[34:28.880 --> 34:30.880]  are going to be tough.
[34:30.880 --> 34:32.880]  You need to be able to work with larger populations
[34:32.880 --> 34:34.880]  and you need to be able to breed
[34:34.880 --> 34:36.880]  for not only auto flower
[34:37.680 --> 34:39.680]  and terpene profile,
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.680]  but you need to be able to breed for things like structure.
[34:41.680 --> 34:43.680]  That's what working in larger populations.
[34:45.680 --> 34:47.680]  You're looking for
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.680]  genotypes specifically
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.680]  that are like the parent
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.680]  that you're breeding towards.
[34:53.680 --> 34:55.680]  If you're trying to breed towards a specific thing,
[34:55.680 --> 34:57.680]  you can breed towards those goals
[34:57.680 --> 34:59.680]  as far as structure-wise.
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.680]  I think where a lot of people make mistakes,
[35:01.680 --> 35:03.680]  and this goes not just for autos
[35:03.680 --> 35:05.680]  but for photo period,
[35:06.480 --> 35:08.480]  you're looking for structure
[35:08.480 --> 35:10.480]  and vigor
[35:10.480 --> 35:12.480]  as opposed to terpene profile.
[35:12.480 --> 35:14.480]  The number one thing
[35:14.480 --> 35:16.480]  if you're trying to breed for something
[35:16.480 --> 35:18.480]  and you want to make an auto version of it
[35:18.480 --> 35:20.480]  is that terpene profile.
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.480]  If the wedding cake smells like Jack Herrera,
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.480]  you can't call it wedding cake.
[35:24.480 --> 35:26.480]  It's really difficult.
[35:26.480 --> 35:28.480]  Even with the OG,
[35:28.480 --> 35:30.480]  it's been something that's really tough to get in there.
[35:30.480 --> 35:32.480]  We're not even talking about necessarily that.
[35:32.480 --> 35:34.480]  That could be a number of things
[35:35.280 --> 35:37.280]  besides just terpenes that you're breeding towards.
[35:37.280 --> 35:39.280]  You really have to breed towards those goals.
[35:39.280 --> 35:41.280]  Each generation,
[35:41.280 --> 35:43.280]  you're breeding for that terpene profile.
[35:43.280 --> 35:45.280]  Every generation,
[35:45.280 --> 35:47.280]  you're going for that and then structure.
[35:47.280 --> 35:49.280]  The structure can be so diverse.
[35:49.280 --> 35:51.280]  The thing is
[35:51.280 --> 35:53.280]  when you're talking about something
[35:53.280 --> 35:55.280]  that is a complex polyhybrid
[35:55.280 --> 35:57.280]  that has five or six different lines,
[35:57.280 --> 35:59.280]  you're going to get a ton of genetic diversity.
[35:59.280 --> 36:01.280]  That's why you need to work with these larger populations
[36:01.280 --> 36:03.280]  to really narrow it down
[36:03.280 --> 36:05.280]  and breed towards your goals.
[36:05.280 --> 36:07.280]  My buddy Nick,
[36:07.280 --> 36:09.280]  he looks at seed color, seed size.
[36:09.280 --> 36:11.280]  I learned some interesting stuff that he does.
[36:11.280 --> 36:13.280]  As far as I really go in the room
[36:13.280 --> 36:15.280]  and try to pick apart the plants,
[36:15.280 --> 36:17.280]  spend a lot of time smelling them.
[36:17.280 --> 36:19.280]  That's what I've been doing lately
[36:19.280 --> 36:21.280]  besides building rooms out is smelling,
[36:21.280 --> 36:23.280]  going in and smelling
[36:23.280 --> 36:25.280]  and really picking out those phenos.
[36:25.280 --> 36:27.280]  The thing is you can't keep an auto flower alive.
[36:27.280 --> 36:29.280]  When you make seeds of it,
[36:29.280 --> 36:31.280]  you're selecting that next generation
[36:31.280 --> 36:33.280]  of seed cross that you made.
[36:33.280 --> 36:35.280]  You're going in the room, smelling it.
[36:35.280 --> 36:37.280]  It is population size
[36:37.280 --> 36:39.280]  prohibitive. Yes.
[36:39.280 --> 36:41.280]  Population size is important.
[36:41.280 --> 36:43.280]  It's really
[36:43.280 --> 36:45.280]  important.
[36:45.280 --> 36:47.280]  Homebreeder, you can do some interesting stuff
[36:47.280 --> 36:49.280]  too, but as far as really
[36:49.280 --> 36:51.280]  being able to create quality,
[36:51.280 --> 36:53.280]  I feel that you need
[36:53.280 --> 36:55.280]  to work with larger populations.
[36:55.280 --> 36:57.280]  Just from a genetic standpoint,
[36:57.280 --> 36:59.280]  if you're looking at diversity and stuff like that,
[36:59.280 --> 37:01.280]  the more diverse you're working with,
[37:01.280 --> 37:03.280]  the more seeds you germinate, the better results
[37:03.280 --> 37:05.280]  you're going to have because you're going to have more plants
[37:05.280 --> 37:07.280]  to work from.
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.280]  Then
[37:09.280 --> 37:11.280]  when was High Times
[37:11.280 --> 37:13.280]  Magazine founded? Interesting.
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.280]  We got the people in the
[37:15.280 --> 37:17.280]  chat. What do we win if we
[37:17.280 --> 37:24.140]  answer that?
[37:24.140 --> 37:26.140]  You do marker-assisted breeding.
[37:26.140 --> 37:28.140]  I'm working towards marker-assisted breeding.
[37:28.140 --> 37:30.140]  We have all kinds of stuff that are going
[37:30.140 --> 37:32.140]  down. I think they do.
[37:32.140 --> 37:34.140]  High Times Magazine has isolated
[37:34.140 --> 37:36.140]  a trait for autos.
[37:36.140 --> 37:38.140]  That's great. You can use that for
[37:38.140 --> 37:40.140]  breeding.
[37:40.140 --> 37:42.140]  It's like marker-driven
[37:42.140 --> 37:44.140]  breeding, cannabinoid terpene profile.
[37:44.140 --> 37:46.140]  Those things, if you're talking
[37:46.140 --> 37:48.140]  about analytics, analytics can help
[37:48.140 --> 37:50.140]  you a great deal too.
[37:50.140 --> 37:52.140]  If you're trying to match up
[37:52.140 --> 37:54.140]  similar terpene profiles, you can do it
[37:54.140 --> 37:56.140]  through analytics. More so for cannabinoids
[37:56.140 --> 37:58.140]  though is really what
[37:58.140 --> 38:00.140]  I'm concerned with breeding higher cannabinoid levels
[38:00.140 --> 38:02.140]  and so testing populations.
[38:02.140 --> 38:04.140]  That's not
[38:04.140 --> 38:06.140]  cheating. That's the way you do it
[38:06.140 --> 38:08.140]  if you want to be successful. Now, it costs a lot more
[38:08.140 --> 38:10.140]  money. Those things can
[38:10.140 --> 38:12.140]  be super expensive.
[38:12.140 --> 38:14.140]  Is Steve
[38:14.140 --> 38:16.140]  D'Angelo's hair real?
[38:16.140 --> 38:18.140]  Or the braids attached to the hat?
[38:18.140 --> 38:20.140]  You know, you should
[38:20.140 --> 38:22.140]  probably ask Steve.
[38:22.140 --> 38:24.140]  If we knew the answer, that could be our trivia question.
[38:24.140 --> 38:26.140]  Yeah, seriously.
[38:26.140 --> 38:28.140]  Cush auto,
[38:28.140 --> 38:30.140]  do they yield? It depends on
[38:30.140 --> 38:32.140]  where you're growing them and if you know how to grow
[38:32.140 --> 38:34.140]  or not. Yeah, they can yield.
[38:34.140 --> 38:36.140]  You can get three ounces off a plant.
[38:36.140 --> 38:38.140]  I think
[38:38.140 --> 38:40.140]  three ounces is a great number for autos.
[38:40.140 --> 38:42.140]  I think you're crushing it if you're getting
[38:42.140 --> 38:44.140]  three.
[38:44.140 --> 38:46.140]  Even two at scale,
[38:46.140 --> 38:48.140]  I think even using two, if you're doing
[38:48.140 --> 38:50.140]  15,000 plants per acre,
[38:50.140 --> 38:52.140]  that's a lot of pounds.
[38:52.140 --> 38:54.140]  Yeah.
[38:54.140 --> 38:56.140]  I also
[38:56.140 --> 38:58.140]  isolate the plant I'm reversing and put it under
[38:58.140 --> 39:00.140]  low-powered light
[39:00.140 --> 39:02.140]  till the pollen sacs pop.
[39:02.140 --> 39:04.140]  Yeah, so we were kind of talking about
[39:04.140 --> 39:06.140]  the low-powered
[39:06.140 --> 39:08.140]  light, LEDs, spectrums, all that
[39:08.140 --> 39:10.140]  stuff a while back. I would love
[39:10.140 --> 39:12.140]  to tell you that HPS definitely
[39:12.140 --> 39:14.140]  is the game changer
[39:14.140 --> 39:16.140]  for LEDs.
[39:16.140 --> 39:18.140]  Unless you're adding spectrums and working
[39:18.140 --> 39:20.140]  with it, I'm just going to stick
[39:20.140 --> 39:22.140]  with HPS for now, till I have it dialed in.
[39:22.140 --> 39:24.140]  HPS produces
[39:24.140 --> 39:26.140]  better quality reversals
[39:26.140 --> 39:28.140]  than LED.
[39:28.140 --> 39:30.140]  CMH,
[39:30.140 --> 39:32.140]  all that stuff.
[39:32.140 --> 39:34.140]  I'm sticking
[39:34.140 --> 39:36.140]  with the HPS for the reversals.
[39:36.140 --> 39:38.140]  I think it's just that much more
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.140]  beneficial and easy
[39:40.140 --> 39:42.140]  to do. I'm getting
[39:42.140 --> 39:44.140]  more than double the yield of pollen
[39:44.140 --> 39:46.140]  off of my plants that are HPS.
[39:46.140 --> 39:48.140]  Yeah, and so start your autos
[39:48.140 --> 39:50.140]  in final pots. They start to flower
[39:50.140 --> 39:52.140]  as soon as roots hit the wall of the pot
[39:52.140 --> 39:54.140]  to get more veg time.
[39:54.140 --> 39:56.140]  I don't know.
[39:56.140 --> 39:58.140]  You can do field sown, which is kind of
[39:58.140 --> 40:00.140]  similar. You're talking about putting it in its final home
[40:00.140 --> 40:02.140]  right from the beginning and germinating it there.
[40:02.140 --> 40:04.140]  You can go in a paper towel
[40:04.140 --> 40:06.140]  and then go into
[40:06.140 --> 40:08.140]  a little one-inch
[40:08.140 --> 40:10.140]  starter. There's all kinds of stuff you can do.
[40:10.140 --> 40:12.140]  I would say if you go
[40:12.140 --> 40:14.140]  and start them in your
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.140]  whatever it is, cocoa
[40:16.140 --> 40:18.140]  and rockwool, I don't think you're going to get
[40:18.140 --> 40:20.140]  as good results as starting
[40:20.140 --> 40:22.140]  in soil. That's just my personal opinion.
[40:22.140 --> 40:24.140]  But
[40:24.140 --> 40:26.140]  I would say that you don't want
[40:26.140 --> 40:28.140]  them to go for more than seven to ten
[40:28.140 --> 40:30.140]  days. Once you get that taproot
[40:30.140 --> 40:32.140]  exposed, that's when you should transplant.
[40:32.140 --> 40:34.140]  Even at scale, it's like
[40:34.140 --> 40:36.140]  you let them go a week
[40:36.140 --> 40:38.140]  and you transplant them a week later.
[40:38.140 --> 40:40.140]  But yeah, germinate in water
[40:40.140 --> 40:42.140]  or paper towel, but don't do it
[40:42.140 --> 40:44.140]  in a final pot. I'm okay with
[40:44.140 --> 40:46.140]  transplanting them. I find
[40:46.140 --> 40:48.140]  that it's easier to work with at scale.
[40:48.140 --> 40:50.140]  Now, if you're working with a couple, yeah,
[40:50.140 --> 40:52.140]  that's great. But if you're working at scale
[40:52.140 --> 40:54.140]  and you want to germinate them, you're going to
[40:54.140 --> 40:56.140]  start them in whatever kind of
[40:56.140 --> 40:58.140]  starter cube or
[40:58.140 --> 41:00.140]  cell tray
[41:00.140 --> 41:02.140]  that you're using
[41:02.140 --> 41:04.140]  and then you're able to work with them.
[41:06.140 --> 41:08.140]  Let's see.
[41:08.140 --> 41:10.140]  I'm going to go ahead and
[41:10.140 --> 41:12.140]  let's see.
[41:14.140 --> 41:16.140]  Should we be having so
[41:16.140 --> 41:18.140]  many breeders? You know, everybody's
[41:18.140 --> 41:20.140]  a breeder to this day. I think
[41:20.140 --> 41:22.140]  the term breeder, it's like it's hard
[41:22.140 --> 41:24.140]  to differentiate who does what.
[41:24.140 --> 41:26.140]  Breeders are
[41:26.140 --> 41:28.140]  overrated. Seed
[41:28.140 --> 41:30.140]  companies, there's a million seed companies. But
[41:30.140 --> 41:32.140]  who's really producing seeds that
[41:32.140 --> 41:34.140]  are good? Who's really putting in the work?
[41:34.140 --> 41:36.140]  There's only a handful of guys out there.
[41:36.140 --> 41:38.140]  I'm not going to name names. I'm going to let you guys
[41:38.140 --> 41:40.140]  do some research. But I can tell
[41:40.140 --> 41:42.140]  you that the guys that are
[41:42.140 --> 41:44.140]  putting in the real work are
[41:44.140 --> 41:46.140]  pheno-hunting. Oh, yeah.
[41:46.140 --> 41:48.140]  Peter, are you making seeds? Peter, are you starting your
[41:48.140 --> 41:50.140]  own seed company?
[41:50.140 --> 41:52.140]  You're on mute.
[41:52.140 --> 41:54.140]  No, I'm just...
[41:54.140 --> 41:56.140]  We were talking autos and then these ones
[41:56.140 --> 41:58.140]  have just started to flower.
[41:58.140 --> 42:00.140]  Yeah, see that's...
[42:00.140 --> 42:02.140]  Okay.
[42:02.140 --> 42:04.140]  Are those outside?
[42:04.140 --> 42:06.140]  Yeah, I basically have them outside during the
[42:06.140 --> 42:08.140]  day and then I bring them inside for a little more
[42:08.140 --> 42:10.140]  light right behind me at night
[42:10.140 --> 42:12.140]  until like nine
[42:12.140 --> 42:14.140]  ish. Yeah, see I
[42:14.140 --> 42:16.140]  would give them 24 hours of light.
[42:16.140 --> 42:18.140]  They would have got bigger. But it looks like
[42:18.140 --> 42:20.140]  they're a little smaller for flowering.
[42:20.140 --> 42:22.140]  I mean, it's going to be okay.
[42:22.140 --> 42:24.140]  You're not going to get a three ounce plant out of that.
[42:24.140 --> 42:26.140]  But once they start flowering, they can triple
[42:26.140 --> 42:28.140]  in size. So a lot of...
[42:28.140 --> 42:30.140]  Head back on.
[42:30.140 --> 42:35.520]  Peter Longpipe
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.520]  Seed Company.
[42:37.520 --> 42:39.520]  So yeah.
[42:39.520 --> 42:41.520]  That joke's had legs.
[42:43.520 --> 42:45.520]  Pollen Chunking Polycluster
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.520]  F2 Dealers.
[42:47.520 --> 42:49.520]  I mean, even not F2
[42:49.520 --> 42:51.520]  dealers. I think guys making feminized seeds, but they're
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.520]  breeding other stuff. They're releasing F1
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.520]  crosses that are polyhybrids.
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.520]  They have all these different lines
[42:57.520 --> 42:59.520]  and they're not testing their stuff.
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.520]  You want to see guys that are actually
[43:01.520 --> 43:03.520]  pheno hunting their stuff, breeding,
[43:03.520 --> 43:05.520]  back crossing,
[43:05.520 --> 43:07.520]  reinforcing traits. I think those
[43:07.520 --> 43:09.520]  are all great things. And a lot of people talk
[43:09.520 --> 43:11.520]  like they're doing stuff, but
[43:11.520 --> 43:13.520]  it's really easy to tell who's...
[43:13.520 --> 43:15.520]  I mean, I wouldn't say it's really easy
[43:15.520 --> 43:17.520]  actually, but you can tell who's
[43:17.520 --> 43:19.520]  doing the real work. You come on here
[43:19.520 --> 43:21.520]  and you get guys like Mean Gene. He's a great
[43:21.520 --> 43:23.520]  example of somebody
[43:23.520 --> 43:25.520]  who's doing some work. I mean, fucking his root beer
[43:25.520 --> 43:27.520]  looks crazy. I've never even seen
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.520]  it. But the prices people are willing to pay
[43:29.520 --> 43:31.520]  for it, that's nuts.
[43:31.520 --> 43:33.520]  But, you know, I think
[43:33.520 --> 43:35.520]  breeding is a real interesting thing
[43:35.520 --> 43:37.520]  though, because you can call yourself a breeder
[43:37.520 --> 43:39.520]  because you made a cross.
[43:39.520 --> 43:41.520]  And now you're a breeder, right? Well,
[43:41.520 --> 43:43.520]  breeding is something like martial arts
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.520]  or anything else. It takes a lifetime and you're
[43:45.520 --> 43:47.520]  still constantly learning shit.
[43:47.520 --> 43:49.520]  They're constantly
[43:49.520 --> 43:51.520]  learning new ways to do stuff.
[43:51.520 --> 43:53.520]  And the industry is evolving so fast
[43:53.520 --> 43:55.520]  that it's like we're talking about autos now.
[43:55.520 --> 43:57.520]  We weren't talking about autos five years ago
[43:57.520 --> 43:59.520]  really as a
[43:59.520 --> 44:01.520]  collective group of people that are
[44:01.520 --> 44:03.520]  interested in breeding. Autos was not a subject
[44:03.520 --> 44:05.520]  we were talking about. Now autos is
[44:05.520 --> 44:07.520]  very hot.
[44:07.520 --> 44:09.520]  But I think reinforcing
[44:09.520 --> 44:11.520]  traits is one of the biggest things. And also
[44:11.520 --> 44:13.520]  how do you know if your
[44:13.520 --> 44:15.520]  genetics are good unless you're able to pop
[44:15.520 --> 44:17.520]  a bunch of them and see how they perform?
[44:17.520 --> 44:19.520]  Tons
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.520]  of guys are selling seeds and it's like they have
[44:21.520 --> 44:23.520]  some cool names that they cross. How do you
[44:23.520 --> 44:25.520]  know those guys got the real phenos?
[44:25.520 --> 44:27.520]  You don't. I mean, the thing is
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.520]  did they get the real plant?
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.520]  The real wedding cakes. The thing is
[44:31.520 --> 44:33.520]  there's 31 JVZ released
[44:33.520 --> 44:35.520]  wedding cake seeds. There's 31
[44:35.520 --> 44:37.520]  phenos of wedding cake out there.
[44:37.520 --> 44:39.520]  Different expressions.
[44:39.520 --> 44:41.520]  I think
[44:41.520 --> 44:43.520]  it's funny because you have all these 31.
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.520]  Which one was the right one?
[44:45.520 --> 44:47.520]  Can you breed with one that's different
[44:47.520 --> 44:49.520]  and get similar results? Yes,
[44:49.520 --> 44:51.520]  but it doesn't happen all the time.
[44:51.520 --> 44:53.520]  I think people are on such
[44:53.520 --> 44:55.520]  the hype train and there's so many people
[44:55.520 --> 44:57.520]  that are buying seeds that are just putting them
[44:57.520 --> 44:59.520]  away for
[44:59.520 --> 45:01.520]  preservation purposes. They
[45:01.520 --> 45:03.520]  collect them. That's
[45:03.520 --> 45:05.520]  an interesting thing. I believe that over
[45:05.520 --> 45:07.520]  75% are probably just put away
[45:07.520 --> 45:09.520]  and preserved. Reserva
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.520]  Provada Sour D.
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.520]  I love Don and Aaron. I love
[45:13.520 --> 45:15.520]  Reserva Provada. I think they do some interesting
[45:15.520 --> 45:17.520]  stuff. I did the same thing. I had a Sour
[45:17.520 --> 45:19.520]  D back in the day. I don't think they have a Sour
[45:19.520 --> 45:21.520]  D. Maybe they do.
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.520]  People calling stuff
[45:23.520 --> 45:25.520]  Sour D or OG Kush seeds.
[45:25.520 --> 45:27.520]  There's a company out of California that's in northern
[45:27.520 --> 45:29.520]  California that released all
[45:29.520 --> 45:31.520]  these blueberry
[45:31.520 --> 45:33.520]  I'm not going to name all the names but OG Kush
[45:33.520 --> 45:35.520]  Blue Dream. All these seeds
[45:35.520 --> 45:37.520]  after and those aren't necessarily Blue Dream
[45:37.520 --> 45:39.520]  seeds. I did
[45:39.520 --> 45:41.520]  some more stuff back in the day, but
[45:41.520 --> 45:43.520]  really those are where you're
[45:43.520 --> 45:45.520]  crossing other stuff with. OG Kush is a
[45:45.520 --> 45:47.520]  clone only. Unless you're making an S
[45:47.520 --> 45:49.520]  1 or you're
[45:49.520 --> 45:51.520]  selfing it or putting OG
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  Kush with a different type of OG Kush, you're not
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.520]  selling OG Kush seeds. The
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.520]  Transparency Limited Edition Sour D
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.520]  Don and Aaron had not sold anything
[45:59.520 --> 46:01.520]  that's whack.
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.520]  I think Don and Aaron have done a
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.520]  really good job of releasing fire
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.520]  over the years for sure.
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.520]  With Crockett in that group too
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.260]  for sure.
[46:18.260 --> 46:20.260]  There's a lot of
[46:20.260 --> 46:22.260]  truth to that.
[46:22.260 --> 46:24.260]  Breeding takes a long time to learn
[46:24.260 --> 46:26.260]  and you have to be working with
[46:26.260 --> 46:28.260]  really good genetics. Anybody can
[46:28.260 --> 46:30.260]  say anything is anything. You've got to
[46:30.260 --> 46:32.260]  remember
[46:32.260 --> 46:34.260]  that
[46:34.260 --> 46:36.260]  most growers care none for the real
[46:36.260 --> 46:38.260]  plant, just the shine and profits from
[46:38.260 --> 46:40.260]  those. No real research into
[46:40.260 --> 46:42.260]  genetics. That's 100%
[46:42.260 --> 46:44.260]  for sure. I think there's a lot of
[46:44.260 --> 46:46.260]  people that cross this with this and then they have some
[46:46.260 --> 46:48.260]  hype names and then people want to buy the seeds
[46:48.260 --> 46:50.260]  but they don't do the
[46:50.260 --> 46:52.260]  research on that breeder or they're like,
[46:52.260 --> 46:54.260]  they're selling lots of seeds. They must be good.
[46:54.260 --> 46:56.260]  There are some good breeders
[46:56.260 --> 46:58.260]  out there. There are some bad ones.
[46:58.260 --> 47:00.260]  Cookies clone only. Cookies
[47:00.260 --> 47:02.260]  is clone only. Girl Scout
[47:02.260 --> 47:04.260]  Cookies seeds or Sunset
[47:04.260 --> 47:06.260]  Sherbert seeds. Anybody
[47:06.260 --> 47:08.260]  who tries to say that they're creating
[47:08.260 --> 47:10.260]  Cookies seeds, Girl Scout Cookies seeds
[47:10.260 --> 47:12.260]  or Sunset Sherbert seeds or
[47:12.260 --> 47:14.260]  Gelato, straight Gelato
[47:14.260 --> 47:16.260]  33 or any of those, that's
[47:16.260 --> 47:18.260]  hype. It's not real. Those
[47:18.260 --> 47:20.260]  are clone only varieties
[47:20.260 --> 47:22.260]  unless they're selfing it and calling
[47:22.260 --> 47:24.260]  it a selfed version of it.
[47:24.260 --> 47:26.260]  Copycat, he does
[47:26.260 --> 47:28.260]  Copycat genetics. He copies stuff
[47:28.260 --> 47:30.260]  very openly.
[47:30.260 --> 47:32.260]  Status of cat
[47:32.260 --> 47:34.260]  piss hunt. I got some seeds in another
[47:34.260 --> 47:36.260]  room that I've germinated from 707.
[47:36.260 --> 47:38.260]  Someone wanted to know about the status
[47:38.260 --> 47:40.260]  of the cat piss cup
[47:40.260 --> 47:42.260]  and maybe the cat
[47:42.260 --> 47:44.260]  piss. As far as an update, I have
[47:44.260 --> 47:46.260]  still yet to see the real cat piss.
[47:46.260 --> 47:48.260]  Day by day, I get
[47:48.260 --> 47:50.260]  more depressed about it actually.
[47:50.260 --> 47:52.260]  Hopefully, we'll see some in the near future.
[47:52.260 --> 47:54.260]  I got some germinated.
[47:54.260 --> 47:56.260]  If you got flower. Jnetics,
[47:56.260 --> 47:58.260]  I think he has potential with his stuff.
[47:58.260 --> 48:00.260]  The SoCal stuff, I think
[48:00.260 --> 48:02.260]  is pretty solidified that
[48:02.260 --> 48:04.260]  Tom, that's his strain.
[48:04.260 --> 48:06.260]  That's his
[48:06.260 --> 48:08.260]  originated from Tom.
[48:08.260 --> 48:10.260]  Don't tell Tom any differently.
[48:10.260 --> 48:12.260]  Don't tell Tom any differently
[48:12.260 --> 48:14.260]  or people will go. As far as
[48:14.260 --> 48:16.260]  SoCal cat piss, which I definitely
[48:16.260 --> 48:18.260]  know for a fact is different
[48:18.260 --> 48:20.260]  than Menorcal cat piss.
[48:20.260 --> 48:22.260]  If we had all three samples of them,
[48:22.260 --> 48:24.260]  it'd be great to be able to
[48:24.260 --> 48:26.260]  share them with everybody so the world
[48:26.260 --> 48:28.260]  could see what's what.
[48:28.260 --> 48:30.260]  You're going to try the Jnetics one.
[48:30.260 --> 48:32.260]  Jnetics one is coming out of tissue culture
[48:32.260 --> 48:34.260]  and it should be available
[48:34.260 --> 48:36.260]  shortly.
[48:36.260 --> 48:38.260]  I would say that
[48:38.260 --> 48:40.260]  I'm really excited.
[48:40.260 --> 48:42.260]  I've talked to a lot of people
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.260]  and he definitely
[48:44.260 --> 48:46.260]  is from the same circles that had cat piss.
[48:46.260 --> 48:48.260]  Originated cat piss, I think there's a really good
[48:48.260 --> 48:50.260]  chance that his cat piss is the real cat piss
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.260]  from the Bay Area,
[48:52.260 --> 48:54.260]  not from SoCal.
[48:54.260 --> 48:56.260]  I would say that
[48:56.260 --> 48:58.260]  it's funny because our cat piss up here
[48:58.260 --> 49:00.260]  was super pissy. Old school chronic.
[49:00.260 --> 49:02.260]  He has a SoCal cat piss.
[49:02.260 --> 49:04.260]  He had some interesting stuff when I went
[49:04.260 --> 49:06.260]  to see him.
[49:06.260 --> 49:08.260]  Tom's cat piss is gone.
[49:08.260 --> 49:10.260]  I don't know if he's still around.
[49:10.260 --> 49:12.260]  Tom's cat piss is gone.
[49:12.260 --> 49:14.260]  Well, yeah.
[49:14.260 --> 49:16.260]  He made the
[49:16.260 --> 49:18.260]  Kosher Kitty. It was fire.
[49:18.260 --> 49:20.260]  He gave me some Kosher Kitty. Nothing like
[49:20.260 --> 49:22.260]  what I would say cat piss is.
[49:24.260 --> 49:26.260]  I would love to do a show on
[49:26.260 --> 49:28.260]  there's a bunch of varieties like
[49:28.260 --> 49:30.260]  Romulan. We're going to get Romulan
[49:30.260 --> 49:32.260]  Jnetics on here one of these days. If you guys
[49:32.260 --> 49:34.260]  talk to him, let him know. He needs to come
[49:34.260 --> 49:36.260]  on the show.
[49:36.260 --> 49:38.260]  He's not super public about all
[49:38.260 --> 49:40.260]  the stuff he does, but he's amazing.
[49:40.260 --> 49:42.260]  I think his work has been really good. I've seen him
[49:42.260 --> 49:44.260]  really come up.
[49:47.790 --> 49:49.790]  Let's see.
[49:49.790 --> 49:51.790]  OG
[49:51.790 --> 49:53.790]  clone only, Codenog clone only,
[49:53.790 --> 49:55.790]  Sour D clone only, and most
[49:55.790 --> 49:57.790]  of these were clone only. Then humans made available
[49:57.790 --> 49:59.790]  to others by reversing and
[49:59.790 --> 50:01.790]  showing love. Yeah, this stuff really
[50:01.790 --> 50:03.790]  didn't get out that much back in the day, but
[50:03.790 --> 50:05.790]  the OG was clone only. It still is.
[50:05.790 --> 50:07.790]  OG Kush. Oh, you
[50:07.790 --> 50:09.790]  know what? I have some OG Kush buds
[50:09.790 --> 50:11.790]  to show you guys.
[50:13.790 --> 50:15.790]  I got
[50:15.790 --> 50:17.790]  some fire right now that I'm smoking on.
[50:17.790 --> 50:19.790]  Some Ganja Farmer OG.
[50:19.790 --> 50:21.790]  This was an entry at
[50:21.790 --> 50:23.790]  one point and I started smoking it.
[50:23.790 --> 50:25.790]  If you guys grow really good
[50:25.790 --> 50:27.790]  weed and you want to enter it in cups,
[50:27.790 --> 50:29.790]  the best way to do it is freeze
[50:29.790 --> 50:31.790]  it. What you do is
[50:31.790 --> 50:33.790]  you basically take a sandwich bag
[50:33.790 --> 50:35.790]  with a little lip on it. You fold it over.
[50:35.790 --> 50:37.790]  You vacuum seal that with your perfectly
[50:37.790 --> 50:39.790]  cured, I would say, three
[50:39.790 --> 50:41.790]  weeks after harvest. You can maybe three to
[50:41.790 --> 50:43.790]  four weeks after harvest, you vacuum seal it.
[50:45.790 --> 50:47.790]  You see that OG Kush structure. That
[50:47.790 --> 50:49.790]  thing is great. This is some
[50:49.790 --> 50:51.790]  Ganja Farmer OG. Me and Marlon
[50:51.790 --> 50:53.790]  got this going on. This has been
[50:53.790 --> 50:55.790]  going on for a long time.
[50:55.790 --> 50:57.790]  It's got that nice
[50:57.790 --> 50:59.790]  pine and gas
[50:59.790 --> 51:01.790]  structure. A little bit of
[51:01.790 --> 51:03.790]  lemon.
[51:03.790 --> 51:05.790]  I've been smoking on that.
[51:05.790 --> 51:07.790]  Then we're going to look at some Skittles now.
[51:07.790 --> 51:09.790]  I got some
[51:09.790 --> 51:11.790]  Skittles. A little bag of Skittles
[51:11.790 --> 51:13.790]  here. Normally, I
[51:13.790 --> 51:15.790]  store my stuff in
[51:15.790 --> 51:17.790]  glass. These ones
[51:17.790 --> 51:19.790]  carry around a baggie.
[51:19.790 --> 51:21.790]  When you look at that, we got
[51:21.790 --> 51:23.790]  Skittles with the seed in it.
[51:23.790 --> 51:25.790]  That's a white
[51:25.790 --> 51:27.790]  seed.
[51:29.790 --> 51:31.790]  This Skittles was grown in January
[51:31.790 --> 51:33.790]  last year. Put it in the freezer. It still has
[51:33.790 --> 51:35.790]  that Z-Turp, super, super, super
[51:35.790 --> 51:37.790]  strong. It's ugly looking
[51:37.790 --> 51:39.790]  bud, but Skittles,
[51:39.790 --> 51:41.790]  I love it. It's hard
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.790]  to deny the turps on the Skittles.
[51:43.790 --> 51:45.790]  Then I just
[51:45.790 --> 51:47.790]  dug out some other stuff that I've been smoking
[51:47.790 --> 51:49.790]  on. This is called Tiger
[51:49.790 --> 51:51.790]  Bomb. It's actually from
[51:51.790 --> 51:53.790]  Compound Genetics. I didn't know it was from Compound
[51:53.790 --> 51:55.790]  until recently. Time Bomb's awesome.
[51:57.790 --> 51:59.790]  It's definitely got some gas
[51:59.790 --> 52:01.790]  and soil,
[52:01.790 --> 52:03.790]  almost soil-like smell to it. It's got
[52:03.790 --> 52:05.790]  leather, gas,
[52:05.790 --> 52:07.790]  earth.
[52:07.790 --> 52:11.450]  A lot of the great things.
[52:11.450 --> 52:13.450]  The thing is, these
[52:13.450 --> 52:15.450]  three varieties, none of them have
[52:15.450 --> 52:17.450]  color. Color
[52:17.450 --> 52:19.450]  dictates whether it's exotic right now
[52:19.450 --> 52:21.450]  or what the price is going for it.
[52:21.450 --> 52:23.450]  Although, OG's, I think, is making a comeback.
[52:25.450 --> 52:27.450]  Let's see.
[52:27.450 --> 52:29.450]  Cookie strains have a higher
[52:29.450 --> 52:31.450]  tendency of becoming a herm compared to something
[52:31.450 --> 52:33.450]  like DJ Shorts Blueberry.
[52:33.450 --> 52:35.450]  It's funny that you
[52:35.450 --> 52:37.450]  say that with DJ Shorts Blueberry.
[52:39.450 --> 52:41.450]  Run 20,000 of each and see which line
[52:41.450 --> 52:43.450]  produces more. Why?
[52:43.450 --> 52:45.450]  Because it's in the genetics.
[52:45.450 --> 52:47.450]  Yes, yes, yes.
[52:47.450 --> 52:49.450]  I think DJ Shorts Blueberry, when he
[52:49.450 --> 52:51.450]  was making seeds along the way, I feel like
[52:51.450 --> 52:53.450]  at one point, where it was like the
[52:53.450 --> 52:55.450]  F5 maybe, they were super
[52:55.450 --> 52:57.450]  amazing. Then by the F7, I had some
[52:57.450 --> 52:59.450]  herm issues. Daniel gave me
[52:59.450 --> 53:01.450]  some. I think he makes really good stuff.
[53:01.450 --> 53:03.450]  DJ Shorts Blueberry is a great one.
[53:03.450 --> 53:05.450]  Cookies definitely has intersexual
[53:05.450 --> 53:07.450]  traits. You need to work those out of the
[53:07.450 --> 53:09.450]  genetics. Those need to be
[53:09.450 --> 53:11.450]  worked out. It's definitely
[53:11.450 --> 53:13.450]  reverses really easy. That's why you see a lot
[53:13.450 --> 53:15.450]  of people making feminized seeds with it because it's
[53:15.450 --> 53:17.450]  something that doesn't matter what your reversal
[53:17.450 --> 53:19.450]  spray is. I feel like Cookies is
[53:19.450 --> 53:21.450]  an easy one to reverse.
[53:23.450 --> 53:25.450]  As far as
[53:25.450 --> 53:27.450]  I'm concerned, yeah. I guess
[53:27.450 --> 53:29.450]  it definitely is in the genetics.
[53:29.450 --> 53:31.450]  When we talk about herms and
[53:31.450 --> 53:33.450]  stability, I think there's a lot of
[53:33.450 --> 53:35.450]  confusion there too because
[53:35.450 --> 53:37.450]  we talk about
[53:37.450 --> 53:39.450]  stability and people
[53:39.450 --> 53:41.450]  right away think
[53:41.450 --> 53:43.450]  hermaphrodites. Usually, that's not the
[53:43.450 --> 53:45.450]  case. We're talking about that's sexual
[53:45.450 --> 53:47.450]  stability. Sexual stability is different
[53:47.450 --> 53:49.450]  than zygocity. When we talk
[53:49.450 --> 53:51.450]  zygocity, homozygocity
[53:51.450 --> 53:53.450]  and heterozygocity, that's
[53:53.450 --> 53:55.450]  stability. That's phenotypical
[53:55.450 --> 53:57.450]  expression. How much phenotypical
[53:57.450 --> 53:59.450]  expression? How similar do the
[53:59.450 --> 54:01.450]  plants look? Genotypes? How many
[54:01.450 --> 54:03.450]  genotypes are there?
[54:05.450 --> 54:07.450]  Then as far as
[54:07.450 --> 54:09.450]  intersexual traits, which
[54:09.450 --> 54:11.450]  would be like hermaphrodites and full-blown
[54:11.450 --> 54:13.450]  males in a population of feminized seeds,
[54:13.450 --> 54:15.450]  you get those. The less
[54:15.450 --> 54:17.450]  stable they are,
[54:19.450 --> 54:21.450]  as far as
[54:21.450 --> 54:23.450]  sexuality,
[54:23.450 --> 54:25.450]  the more sexually stable
[54:25.450 --> 54:27.450]  they are, the less they're going to hermaphrodite.
[54:27.450 --> 54:29.450]  That actually is
[54:29.450 --> 54:31.450]  the answer I've been searching for, James.
[54:31.450 --> 54:33.450]  Some breeders are lazy and pass it on
[54:33.450 --> 54:35.450]  frequently, but other breeders have bred
[54:35.450 --> 54:37.450]  stability back into some cookie strings.
[54:37.450 --> 54:39.450]  I would say that for
[54:39.450 --> 54:41.450]  sure that's the case.
[54:41.450 --> 54:43.450]  I think you
[54:43.450 --> 54:45.450]  can test for sexual stability now.
[54:45.450 --> 54:47.450]  Those are things that you can test for
[54:47.450 --> 54:49.450]  that's important.
[54:49.450 --> 54:51.450]  A lot of breeders don't stress test
[54:51.450 --> 54:53.450]  their plants that they're breeding with either,
[54:53.450 --> 54:55.450]  their selections.
[54:55.450 --> 54:57.450]  Blueberry muffin is one that I really like.
[54:57.450 --> 54:59.450]  Blueberry muffin tends to herm.
[54:59.450 --> 55:01.450]  We got an amazing cut of it. It grows amazing
[55:01.450 --> 55:03.450]  flower. Love it, but it's
[55:03.450 --> 55:05.450]  one of those ones that totally herms.
[55:09.450 --> 55:11.450]  Let's see.
[55:11.450 --> 55:13.450]  Indigenous hormones.
[55:17.940 --> 55:19.940]  Mr. Toad, what do you want to tell us about
[55:19.940 --> 55:30.380]  indigenous hormones?
[55:30.380 --> 55:32.380]  Nice.
[55:36.380 --> 55:38.380]  It's really interesting when you're talking about breeding
[55:38.380 --> 55:40.380]  and intersexual traits.
[55:42.380 --> 55:44.380]  We got all kinds of good stuff in the chat today, guys.
[55:44.380 --> 55:46.380]  Thanks for all the contributions.
[55:54.260 --> 55:56.260]  You know what? How does a breeder breed stability
[55:56.260 --> 55:58.260]  for thousands of environments that are
[55:58.260 --> 56:00.260]  being swayed by...
[56:00.260 --> 56:02.260]  You got me there.
[56:02.260 --> 56:04.260]  I believe that if you're
[56:04.260 --> 56:06.260]  going to put it outside,
[56:06.260 --> 56:08.260]  you should definitely be breeding for stuff
[56:08.260 --> 56:10.260]  that's outside. Autoflowers should be bred for
[56:10.260 --> 56:12.260]  stability outside.
[56:12.260 --> 56:14.260]  Again, there's so many different
[56:14.260 --> 56:16.260]  regions.
[56:16.260 --> 56:18.260]  Stress
[56:18.260 --> 56:20.260]  can affect plants so differently.
[56:20.260 --> 56:22.260]  I think you can have some bulletproof stuff, but that's
[56:22.260 --> 56:24.260]  pretty rare.
[56:24.260 --> 56:26.260]  It's 100% bulletproof
[56:26.260 --> 56:28.260]  in every environment. You take an OG kush,
[56:28.260 --> 56:30.260]  it's not meant to be grown in the Caribbean.
[56:30.260 --> 56:32.260]  It's just not.
[56:32.260 --> 56:34.260]  Same thing with sativas.
[56:34.260 --> 56:36.260]  In equatorial,
[56:36.260 --> 56:38.260]  stuff that you would consider a sativa,
[56:38.260 --> 56:40.260]  like equatorial or tropical varieties
[56:40.260 --> 56:42.260]  that are used to high humidity, you wouldn't grow
[56:42.260 --> 56:44.260]  those in Colorado necessarily.
[56:44.260 --> 56:46.260]  I don't think you're going to get good results.
[56:46.260 --> 56:48.260]  Light and temperature
[56:48.260 --> 56:50.260]  can really stress stuff out.
[56:50.260 --> 56:53.850]  Swaying hormones
[56:53.850 --> 56:55.850]  are what's causing hermaphrodites in the majority
[56:55.850 --> 56:57.850]  of stress factors. Yeah, I would
[56:57.850 --> 56:59.850]  agree.
[56:59.850 --> 57:01.850]  I think you can definitely
[57:01.850 --> 57:03.850]  improve the quality
[57:03.850 --> 57:05.850]  of these plants though by
[57:05.850 --> 57:07.850]  ... I wouldn't say that it's all that.
[57:07.850 --> 57:09.850]  I would say that if we're looking
[57:09.850 --> 57:11.850]  at breeding stuff, we can increase
[57:11.850 --> 57:13.850]  stability, sexual stability,
[57:13.850 --> 57:15.850]  or we can decrease it. Those are traits
[57:15.850 --> 57:17.850]  that can be bred in and out.
[57:17.850 --> 57:19.850]  I bred seeds inside and outside. Hormones are driven
[57:19.850 --> 57:21.850]  by spectrum, heat, moisture.
[57:21.850 --> 57:23.850]  How does the breeder breed these out?
[57:23.850 --> 57:25.850]  It's not just that.
[57:25.850 --> 57:27.850]  I would say that
[57:27.850 --> 57:29.850]  some plants are more
[57:29.850 --> 57:31.850]  inherent to
[57:31.850 --> 57:33.850]  stress factors. It just depends
[57:33.850 --> 57:35.850]  I guess what region you're breeding
[57:35.850 --> 57:37.850]  for. That's a tough
[57:37.850 --> 57:39.850]  question.
[57:39.850 --> 57:41.850]  You don't actually
[57:41.850 --> 57:43.850]  breed those out, but I think you can have stuff
[57:43.850 --> 57:45.850]  that's less susceptible to
[57:45.850 --> 57:47.850]  stuff. I guess again, it's depending on your
[57:47.850 --> 57:49.850]  area and what you're breeding
[57:49.850 --> 57:51.850]  for.
[57:51.850 --> 57:53.850]  I wouldn't even say breeding
[57:53.850 --> 57:55.850]  for. It's depending on who's germinating
[57:55.850 --> 57:57.850]  your seeds and what they're doing with them,
[57:57.850 --> 57:59.850]  the results they get.
[57:59.850 --> 58:01.850]  Even in perfect environment,
[58:01.850 --> 58:03.850]  I've seen stuff ... If you put
[58:03.850 --> 58:05.850]  stuff in flour too early after you
[58:05.850 --> 58:07.850]  germinate the seeds, you can stress them out
[58:07.850 --> 58:09.850]  and cause them to
[58:09.850 --> 58:14.400]  hermaphrodite.
[58:14.400 --> 58:16.400]  Yeah, topic is definitely
[58:16.400 --> 58:20.250]  complex.
[58:20.250 --> 58:22.250]  Are we ever going to see the
[58:22.250 --> 58:24.250]  real versions of these? This is a great
[58:24.250 --> 58:26.250]  question, but myth like
[58:26.250 --> 58:28.250]  skunk and cat piss. One would have
[58:28.250 --> 58:30.250]  to recreate the exact environmental
[58:30.250 --> 58:32.250]  microbial signals to reproduce
[58:32.250 --> 58:34.250]  these expressions.
[58:34.250 --> 58:36.250]  I think with the recombination of
[58:36.250 --> 58:38.250]  genetics and the
[58:38.250 --> 58:40.250]  diversity, we
[58:40.250 --> 58:42.250]  may see these things again.
[58:42.250 --> 58:44.250]  I don't think it's
[58:44.250 --> 58:46.250]  that we won't see them. I think
[58:46.250 --> 58:48.250]  the skunk ... I don't know.
[58:48.250 --> 58:50.250]  It's interesting what was going on back
[58:50.250 --> 58:52.250]  then, who was growing it, and those plants.
[58:52.250 --> 58:54.250]  Mutation happens
[58:54.250 --> 58:56.250]  for sure,
[58:56.250 --> 58:58.250]  but that doesn't mean we can't mutate back
[58:58.250 --> 59:00.250]  towards those things.
[59:00.250 --> 59:02.250]  The thing is, we've got so many
[59:02.250 --> 59:04.250]  people breeding now, so many people doing
[59:04.250 --> 59:06.250]  work. I feel like eventually ... I've
[59:06.250 --> 59:08.250]  seen a lot of stuff that's very cat piss
[59:08.250 --> 59:10.250]  like or very roadkill
[59:10.250 --> 59:12.250]  skunk like that's just not roadkill.
[59:12.250 --> 59:14.250]  The stuff I've seen that's cat piss like
[59:14.250 --> 59:16.250]  is amazing, but
[59:16.250 --> 59:18.250]  it's not cat piss. Some of
[59:18.250 --> 59:20.250]  it smells great, but it's usually a big letdown
[59:20.250 --> 59:22.250]  on the smoke where you get it.
[59:22.250 --> 59:24.250]  Eventually, I think if we're all
[59:24.250 --> 59:26.250]  trying to breed towards these things,
[59:26.250 --> 59:28.250]  I think there's guys trying to breed towards
[59:28.250 --> 59:30.250]  some of those original haze lines
[59:30.250 --> 59:32.250]  to be able to recapture some of
[59:32.250 --> 59:34.250]  that stuff that's special.
[59:34.250 --> 59:36.250]  I would love to say yes. I don't know.
[59:36.250 --> 59:45.340]  No breeder
[59:45.340 --> 59:47.340]  is breeding evolutionary traits
[59:47.340 --> 59:49.340]  bred into a ...
[59:51.340 --> 59:53.340]  If I understand correctly,
[59:53.340 --> 59:55.340]  I think part of what he's saying is when people
[59:55.340 --> 59:57.340]  grow stuff out and get upset
[59:57.340 --> 59:59.340]  at the breeder,
[59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.340]  it's like
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.340]  each environment's different.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.340]  Sometimes ... Mr.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.340]  Toad, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.340]  like from your Instagram,
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.340]  it's like sometimes shit happens
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.340]  in different environments.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.340]  I honestly think there's a lot of
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.340]  work we can be doing by stress
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.340]  testing to get rid of
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.340]  inferior phenotypes and inferior
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.340]  things.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.340]  Breeding towards these goals that we have
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.340]  or towards these exotics, if you're not
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.340]  stress testing your stuff in your environment,
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.340]  whatever that is, to try
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.340]  to get the best quality stuff,
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.340]  then I think you're losing. If you're just
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.340]  breeding to breed and you're just crossing whatever,
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.340]  there's not a lot of work that goes in.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.340]  I think you can breed for more
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.340]  stability. I see
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.340]  it with a lot of the stuff I do. Now, breeding
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.340]  out all that stuff, no way.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.340]  It's not going to work in every environment.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.340]  In the environment you're using,
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.340]  there's no reason why you
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.340]  shouldn't stress test, in my opinion.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.340]  We're not talking about stuff
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.340]  that open pollinates that's going to
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.340]  ... I don't know.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.620]  Yes, stress test. Why so many
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.620]  pests and PM issues seem like genetics?
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.620]  I think
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620]  someone mentions right here weak genetics.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.620]  I think we're talking about
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.620]  people that ...
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.620]  These bottleneck situations where
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.620]  you're not actually breeding into any diversity.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.620]  What you're doing is you're taking a gelato,
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.620]  putting it with something that's
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.620]  70% gelato.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.620]  You're almost breeding an inbred
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.620]  line to a degree away
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.620]  from diversity
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.620]  more towards
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.620]  less phenotypical
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.620]  variation with some
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.620]  phenotypical expression. What you're doing
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.620]  is you're breeding out the vigor. You're breeding
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.620]  out a lot of the important
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.620]  things that
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.620]  make these things so great.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.220]  Cushberry cheesecake grown by L.A.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.220]  Cush.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.220]  There's a lot
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.220]  of stuff that smells like
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.220]  the ... That's funny that you have that tasted
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.220]  like the original cactus.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.220]  It's funny because when you say original cactus, it's like
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.220]  is it the Bay Area cactus? Is it the
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.220]  San Diego cactus?
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.220]  Is it the
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.220]  Portland cactus that was taken from the Bay Area?
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.220]  It's really tough.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.220]  Same thing with
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.220]  the shoreline. I want to do an episode on the shoreline
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.220]  because what you see is shoreline all around the world
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.220]  is completely different. There's the one from
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.220]  Texas that's super skunky.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.220]  Amsterdam is supposedly that cross with
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.220]  lavender.
[01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.770]  Depending on where you live, you have less problems.
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.770]  I think ... Glulato.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.770]  Glulato is really
[01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.770]  great. You want me to talk about glulato?
[01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.770]  Those are Gelato 41 crosses.
[01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:53.770]  Dark Sunset is the Sunset Sherbert
[01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.770]  times the Gelato 41.
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.770]  I think you get a lot of interesting
[01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:59.770]  varieties popping off of there
[01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.770]  as far as ...
[01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.770]  This is ...
[01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.770]  Keep on your topic.
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.770]  I'm just trying to step up.
[01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.770]  You're going to have to throw that up in a second again
[01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.770]  or leave it up.
[01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:13.770]  As far as the Dark Sunset,
[01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:15.770]  I think you're going to get
[01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.770]  some phenotypical variation
[01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.770]  between the plants, obviously.
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.770]  You're going to get a lot of purple, a lot of gas.
[01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.770]  You're going to get that Gelato we know
[01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:25.770]  is on most of it.
[01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:27.770]  It's like a back cross to the Sunset.
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.770]  Gelato 41
[01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:31.770]  putting it back on the Sunset,
[01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.770]  that's one of the parents of it.
[01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:35.770]  You will get that lavender floral
[01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.770]  character along with the gas.
[01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.770]  You'll find some really great phenos in there.
[01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.770]  I really like that one.
[01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:43.770]  The Glulato is great.
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.770]  Gorilla Glue. You get gas.
[01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.770]  I think you can get some that lean towards the structure.
[01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.770]  They pheno-hunted some up in Washington
[01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.770]  that were amazing, super gassy
[01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.770]  but didn't have
[01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.770]  a ton of color necessarily.
[01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:57.770]  There was some color.
[01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.770]  I wouldn't say they had the real Gorilla Glue
[01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:01.770]  chocolatey
[01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:03.770]  chem-cis-ish
[01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.770]  nose on it from the
[01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.770]  chem-cis.
[01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.770]  That overly powerful
[01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:11.770]  burnt tire.
[01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.770]  Both good strains.
[01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:19.770]  Decent yielders.
[01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.770]  You're going to get exotic
[01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.770]  phenotypes out of there for sure.
[01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:25.770]  Exotic expressions.
[01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:27.770]  It's funny. Color can be
[01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.770]  ... Here we go again. Mr. Toad.
[01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:31.770]  We'll go back on this. There are thousands
[01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:33.770]  of different things I've seen gardeners do from
[01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.770]  feeding plant rotten meats to letting plants
[01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:37.770]  go bone dry or use 72 hours
[01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.770]  of darkness. All cause stress.
[01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.770]  For sure.
[01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.770]  His point is then they come back and
[01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.770]  complain to the breeder that their shit's not
[01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.770]  stable and it's like, wait, what'd you do?
[01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.770]  Yeah. I agree that
[01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.770]  there's a lot of misconceptions out
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.770]  there. A lot of people are putting blame
[01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:55.770]  on the breeders when they don't even fucking
[01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.770]  know how to grow. There's a lot of fucking
[01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.770]  people that grow shitty ass weed
[01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.770]  that they think is the best
[01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.770]  and then it's everybody else's fault.
[01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.770]  Whether it's the breeder or
[01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:07.770]  whatever. The genetics, the clones were bad.
[01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.770]  It's like
[01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.770]  if you don't know how to grow, it's going to be hard for you
[01:05:11.770 --> 01:05:13.770]  to differentiate one thing to the next.
[01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.770]  My Gelato 41
[01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.770]  reverses are all gas, burnt rubber
[01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.770]  and rare black phenol,
[01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.770]  all gas. I think
[01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:23.770]  the Gelato 41 is amazing.
[01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.770]  I think a lot of people
[01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.770]  don't have the real Gelato 41.
[01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:29.770]  If you got it, that's what you're going to get. It's some really amazing
[01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:31.770]  stuff. Cheddar Bob, what is
[01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:33.770]  the original Royal spill?
[01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:37.770]  I have no idea.
[01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.770]  Sounds fire though.
[01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.770]  For sure. Triple X OG Royal
[01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.770]  7, that's great stuff.
[01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.770]  People think just because
[01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:52.110]  they can grow tomatoes.
[01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.110]  I think that people...
[01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:56.110]  I like the name by the way.
[01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:58.110]  People just think
[01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.110]  because they can grow tomatoes or some kind of
[01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:02.110]  vegetable, there's no difference. I think
[01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:04.110]  vegetables are actually hard to grow.
[01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:06.110]  I think cannabis is hard to grow.
[01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.110]  Just because you can grow a vegetable
[01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.110]  and it yields a fruit doesn't mean
[01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:12.110]  you did a good job growing that plant.
[01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:14.110]  Kevin Jottery doesn't know anything.
[01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.110]  Kevin Jottery knows.
[01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.110]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:20.110]  I would agree that Kevin Jottery knows a lot.
[01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.110]  Everybody has a hater somewhere though.
[01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:24.110]  For sure.
[01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:26.110]  36 hours of flip massive form of hormone
[01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:28.110]  swing and it's a reason
[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.110]  your environment isn't locked down.
[01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.110]  Then there's all kinds of stuff
[01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:34.110]  you can do as far as
[01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.110]  when we're talking about stressing.
[01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:38.110]  It's like these small
[01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.110]  things that you can do
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.110]  and it's like these small
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:44.110]  things too. I mean, fluctuation
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.110]  in temperature is huge.
[01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.110]  Some plants are affected and some plants aren't.
[01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.110]  Tomatoes are hard. Growing tomatoes
[01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:52.110]  really well and getting them to yield is
[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.110]  difficult. At scale, tomatoes are really...
[01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.110]  I would also think that
[01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.110]  we're not working with 1,200
[01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.110]  different varieties of tomatoes. The stuff
[01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:02.110]  is really refined. The stuff that you're
[01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:04.110]  working with vegetable-wise is a lot
[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.110]  more refined and a lot less diverse
[01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.110]  as far as populations. Cannabis is
[01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.110]  the most diverse plant
[01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.110]  that's cultivated in the world.
[01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:14.110]  We're talking about
[01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.110]  genetic diversity, not just about
[01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:18.110]  different looking plants,
[01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:20.110]  slightly different. We're talking about full-on genetic
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.110]  diversity from...
[01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.110]  It's almost like cauliflower
[01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:26.110]  and broccoli.
[01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:28.110]  Don't talk shit about
[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.110]  Kevbro, fam.
[01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:32.110]  Okay.
[01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:34.110]  It's funny how people want to
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:36.110]  hate about everything. Kevin's a really smart
[01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:38.110]  guy, man. He's put in the work
[01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.110]  and the time and done some badass shit.
[01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:42.110]  I love it when people want
[01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:44.110]  to hate on him. It's like, man...
[01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.110]  Hold on. Let me pull
[01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.110]  apart this comment. Not
[01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:50.110]  hating on him, hating on all his fanboys,
[01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:52.110]  but then you're also saying he doesn't
[01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.110]  know shit. I would disagree and
[01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.110]  say he does know a lot.
[01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.110]  You may think that some people
[01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.110]  put people on a pedestal too
[01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.110]  much, but to say he doesn't
[01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:04.110]  know shit, I would disagree
[01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:06.110]  vigorously with that comment.
[01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:08.110]  Yeah. I mean, he's
[01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.110]  been pushing boundaries for a lot
[01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:12.110]  longer than most people on here
[01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.110]  and
[01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:16.110]  has some great stories. I think he has some
[01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:18.110]  amazing stories, actually.
[01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.110]  Algae is the
[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:22.110]  most diverse, but I'll digress.
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:24.110]  You might
[01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:26.110]  be right. That might be true.
[01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:28.110]  As far as, are we cultivating
[01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:30.110]  algae? Algae might be on the planet
[01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:32.110]  as far as...
[01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:34.110]  I'm sure there's
[01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.110]  stuff that's way more diverse on the planet, but
[01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:38.110]  as far as cultivated
[01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:40.110]  varieties, I believe...
[01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:42.110]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but
[01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:44.110]  cannabis is the most diverse.
[01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:46.110]  Genetically diverse.
[01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:48.110]  Someone said
[01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:50.110]  something about blueberries back here.
[01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:52.110]  What are we...
[01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:54.110]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:56.110]  The jelly beans,
[01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:58.110]  if you go loud, jelly beans, you guys,
[01:08:58.110 --> 01:09:00.110]  regardless of the comment,
[01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:02.110]  I just want to tell you guys that's an amazing
[01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:04.110]  variety and it smells like straight...
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:06.110]  It's got a candy nose. It's got some
[01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:08.110]  gas on it, but it definitely has that
[01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:10.110]  fake candy terp in it.
[01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:12.110]  Similar to a
[01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:14.110]  Z-terp, but
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:16.110]  a little bit different.
[01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:20.020]  Oh, man.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  Let's not get into politics on here, guys.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.020]  Two thumbs up for Kevin and a
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020]  Semper Fi, too. Yep.
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.020]  Yep. Without people like
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.020]  Kevin... We got people backing up Kevin, flexing
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.020]  now. Without people like Kevin,
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.020]  this industry wouldn't be where it's at.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.020]  I'll tell you, I wouldn't have got the Skittles
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.020]  clone that I had if it
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.020]  wasn't for Kevin Jodry.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.020]  I got it through my
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.020]  friends who got...
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.020]  The first to drop knowledge about
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.020]  growing in was on Candy Up.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.020]  Be humble
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.020]  growers.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.420]  Charlotte's Web.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.420]  That's been an interesting one.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.420]  That was
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.420]  the hype CBD strain.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.420]  I think a lot of it's been done with Charlotte's
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.420]  Web.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.420]  Man.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.420]  How about
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.420]  some more giveaways before we
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.420]  close this up today so I can go hang out in the
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.420]  sun, guys? Yes. Is there any
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.420]  other questions you guys have? Some interesting stuff?
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.420]  Slurrlato. If you haven't got Slurrlato, you
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.420]  better buy it because it's pretty much sold out
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.420]  everywhere. Terps, it's got that...
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.420]  I love the...
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.420]  How many packs do you have?
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.420]  Yeah, because otherwise it's sold out everywhere.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.420]  I think we're going to have to
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.420]  maybe do a
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.420]  giveaway with Slurrlato.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.420]  Who is some of the best jiu-jitsu
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.420]  guys in the cannabis game? It's funny because
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.420]  I feel like there's not a ton
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.420]  of jiu-jitsu. Yes. No more
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.420]  Slurrlato. It's sold out
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.420]  everywhere. Sorry, guys. That was
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.420]  super amazing. It had that slurricane nose
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.420]  with gas. Can't go wrong.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.420]  There's a...
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.420]  Jiu-jitsu, he's a good guy
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.420]  in the cannabis black belt. He's in the...
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.420]  If you look at him on Instagram,
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.420]  Joe's an amazing guy.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.420]  If we go
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.420]  the other way and we talk about
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.420]  jiu-jitsu guys that are into cannabis,
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.420]  there's a bunch. I feel like
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.420]  all the Brazilians I know smoke a bunch
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.420]  of weed. Some
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.420]  of the best guys, Diaz brothers.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.420]  Throw those.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.420]  The Diaz brothers are synonymous
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.420]  with cannabis.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.420]  Those dudes smoke before they do everything.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.420]  If you... Gracie Black Belt,
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.420]  it's required that you smoke lots of weed
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.420]  whether they tell you that or not.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.420]  I would say a lot of those
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.420]  dudes love to smoke and roll
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.420]  and I think that's a great thing. Eddie Bravo,
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.420]  another one, Joe Rogan.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.420]  He's one of my idols.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.420]  But...
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.420]  Stockton Slap.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.420]  I thought that'd be a great name for a strain at one point,
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:49.420]  would be the Stockton Slap.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:51.420]  Said just quickly, someone
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:53.420]  or a couple of people have asked if there are going to be
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.420]  any 420 deals on
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.420]  the Daga Love website.
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.420]  I'm a little
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.420]  overwhelmed but
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.420]  my thinking has always been
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.420]  I need to ask all the breeders
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.420]  for their blessing to be like, can I cut your
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.420]  stuff by 40%
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.420]  for a day? I just don't have
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.420]  the time but
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.420]  maybe I'll
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.420]  do something on 420 but
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:19.420]  definitely next year I will
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.420]  have my... This year was
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.420]  about setting up the
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.420]  picking, packing and shipping
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.420]  infrastructure for the past couple
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.420]  months. Totally.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.420]  It's a lot of work, man. That's why
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:33.420]  I'm not doing...
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.420]  Guys like you and James and I
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.420]  keep it real limited to who sells my seeds.
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.420]  It's a lot of work.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.420]  But yeah.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.420]  So how about
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.420]  we do 50% off on all the auto
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.420]  flower? We have the OG
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.420]  and we have the Gelato autos.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.420]  How about we do 50% off on those?
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.420]  Gelato OG. Okay.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.420]  50% off for 420 on Daga.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.420]  Look at that.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.420]  But Top Floor is letting everyone know that the prices
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.420]  are usually pretty low.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.420]  Yeah. They don't want to drop their prices.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.420]  Mr. Toad is a ninja.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.420]  This is true. Ninjitsu, bro.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.420]  And Jiu-Jitsu is great.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.420]  I think if you haven't done Jiu-Jitsu, it's a great
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.420]  thing to
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.420]  try. I think it's not for
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.420]  everybody. It's hard work.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.420]  But when I was in the best
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.420]  shape of my life, I trained three days
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.420]  a week. I wasn't training five days a week. I was only
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.420]  training three days a week in Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.420]  And
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.420]  Jiu-Jitsu is great. There's a lot of people within the
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.420]  cannabis community. I feel like it's something
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.420]  similar to cannabis that really brings a lot of
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:37.420]  people together. Because you go to Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.420]  most schools, there's everybody
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.420]  from police officers
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:43.420]  to musicians to
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.420]  not just police officers,
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.420]  but first responders. Great
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.420]  people, though. I think Jiu-Jitsu, for the
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.420]  most part, brings great people together.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.420]  Martial arts saved my life, somebody
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.420]  said. Strong style,
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.420]  organics. I think martial arts are a great thing.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.420]  And I agree.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.420]  They changed my life for the better.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.420]  I have relationships
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.420]  because of them for the better.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.420]  Someone said,
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.420]  the juice box is probably the slowest grower I've ever
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.420]  had. Anyone actually finish a run?
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.420]  Sure.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.420]  I have
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.420]  picks of it somewhere.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.420]  But yeah, I think
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.420]  they're definitely growing in Arizona. I was
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.420]  just at a grow last week. They were
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.420]  killing it with the juice box.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.420]  So
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.420]  if you only pop one seed and you had
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.420]  some problems with it, someone says autos
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.420]  suck. Again, that's an opinion.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.420]  So yeah,
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420]  half price. You guys got any other
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.420]  cool questions?
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.420]  Should we do more giveaways?
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.420]  Just remember,
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.420]  each giveaway, you gotta pack up and
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.420]  ship. Exactly. That is up
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.420]  to you. I really wish I could
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.420]  give you guys weed, but I can't.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.420]  But I do have some seeds right
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.420]  here.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.420]  See, I'll tell you, the seeds I'm
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.420]  giving away, man, I got some really interesting stuff.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.420]  I got some stuff
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.420]  that's previously unreleased that
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.420]  I'll be giving away.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.420]  That's a good
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.420]  giveaway.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.420]  Yeah, previously unreleased.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.420]  Someone asked,
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.420]  dark sunset. Hold on a second. Where'd that
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.420]  just go? Sure, if we're talking
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.420]  about, I would say like 63
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.420]  days, you're done.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.420]  Maybe a little bit less. I have friends that pull it earlier.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.420]  I would go
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.420]  minimum 63 days with it.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.420]  And
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.420]  as far as structure, you're looking
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.420]  at
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.420]  big buds,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.420]  dense nugs.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.420]  I wouldn't say it's the largest yielder, but I wouldn't
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.420]  say it's the smaller. It's one of those yielders
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.420]  in the middle, but it's definitely exotic, so you're
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.420]  getting color. You're getting super
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.420]  strong. Okay, someone's
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.420]  got juice box going. Juice box
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.420]  is good as well, but as far as
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.420]  the sunset, I feel like that
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.420]  might be between that and the jellybeans.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:59.420]  Those are my two favorite ones.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.420]  The Offendo
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.420]  that's being released, that's the GMO. If you guys
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.420]  want to get it, there's only a limited amount available.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.420]  Seeds here now on
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.420]  starting Tuesday, and that is the GMO
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.420]  x Gelato 41. It's called Offendo,
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.420]  named by Kyle
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.420]  up in Washington,
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.420]  one of the loud Canagenics partners.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.420]  Super fire.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.420]  Yeah, the jellybeans,
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.420]  I thought had the most amazing nose. Sunset's
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.420]  nice.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.420]  You got any questions, you're more than welcome
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.420]  to email me. Let's see, give it away,
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.420]  give it away. Someone wants me to give it away now.
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.420]  Let's see.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.420]  Let's get all trivia'd out right
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.420]  now.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.420]  Yeah, we need someone to
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.420]  come up with good
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.420]  trivia questions.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.420]  Yeah.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.420]  Right, Rose, you're
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.420]  here with us live right now.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.420]  Yeah, you didn't miss the live this time.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.420]  Yeah.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.420]  So,
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.420]  let's see, the first person that
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.420]  puts five different names for
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.420]  cannabis,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.420]  slangs that we use for cannabis,
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.420]  wins, and we're going to give you a pack of seeds.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:15.420]  Who is known as the Gracie Killer?
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.420]  There's a lot of typing going on right now.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.420]  Yep. That's a good
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.420]  question. I like that. Who is known as the Gracie Killer?
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.420]  We're going to do that, but Cheddar Bob, you can't win a pack
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.420]  of seeds.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:33.750]  I've had the question, so that'll be the next one.
[01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:39.340]  All right, so.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.340]  Who had the first one?
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.340]  Dink, weed.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.680]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.680]  This all blew by me.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.680]  I see some people put like one.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.680]  Oh, man, you guys
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.680]  got busy.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.680]  God, I keep thinking I got the
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:08.240]  one.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.240]  I'm like, wow.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240]  There's also,
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.240]  Siti, if you can repeat that question
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.240]  once we're done
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240]  with this.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.560]  What are four ways to stress test
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.560]  new strain crosses?
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560]  Got some allergies today.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560]  It's always good.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560]  So, Monster OG, he's the winner?
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.560]  So, by the
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.560]  way, one thing
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560]  I've learned in the past is you
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560]  may see on your own computer that
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.560]  you posted first, like a split
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560]  second ahead of someone else, but
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.560]  all we can go by is just when
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560]  YouTube displays
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.560]  the posts.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.560]  So, don't get mad.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.560]  We're just trying to have
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560]  some fun.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.560]  It's less fun for me
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.560]  when people complain to me that
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560]  they answered a question first, then I have
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560]  to like
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.560]  handle them.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.560]  The next question was, who is the Gracie killer?
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.560]  Do you guys know who the Gracie killer is?
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:23.940]  This is where you
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.940]  go to get those packs.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.940]  We got radio silence?
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.940]  James is standing by, ready to
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.940]  pack and ship your order.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.940]  Yeah, we'll definitely try.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:41.050]  Oh, wait. CheddarBob
[01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:43.050]  just... So, we got one answer
[01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:45.050]  and it's the right answer.
[01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:47.050]  So, we got Sakuraba.
[01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:49.050]  CheddarBob, is that approved
[01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:51.050]  by CheddarBob? Sakuraba being the
[01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:53.050]  correct answer.
[01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:55.050]  Kazushi Sakuraba.
[01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:59.050]  CheddarBob is now officially in
[01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:01.050]  charge of trivia
[01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:03.050]  questions.
[01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.050]  Okay, I
[01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.050]  got another trivia question. Who was the original
[01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:09.050]  nutrient company
[01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:11.050]  back in the day?
[01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:13.050]  Wait, so who won that one, by the way?
[01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:15.050]  Sakuraba.
[01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:17.050]  Whoever said Sakuraba first.
[01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:19.050]  I see Wildfire.
[01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.050]  I see
[01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:23.050]  Wildfire, yep.
[01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:25.050]  This guy, I think, spelled it
[01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:27.050]  wrong. Oh, wait. Chad had it.
[01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:29.050]  Groski808, yep.
[01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.050]  There's Groski808 at
[01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:33.050]  1221.
[01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:35.050]  I think it may be Chad Westport.
[01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:39.050]  Chad Westport.
[01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:41.050]  I don't see anyone. If anyone
[01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:43.050]  can help,
[01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:45.050]  but Chad, I believe. That's it, I believe
[01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:47.050]  Chad. Good job.
[01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:50.960]  Mr. Chad Westport.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.960]  Send your
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.960]  email right over there.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.960]  So, now we go down for the
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.960]  original nutrient company back in the day.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.960]  For cannabis.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.960]  Let's get this straight. For Monsanto,
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.960]  all this stuff.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.960]  CheddarBob,
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.960]  send me a message.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.300]  We'll send you
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.300]  one seed.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.300]  One seed per question.
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.300]  Yeah.
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.300]  And I'm only sending it to other people four.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.300]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.300]  But we'll figure something out.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.300]  So, yeah, I see GH.
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.300]  GH, GH, yes.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.300]  GH, this is the correct answer.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300]  Fox Farm. Okay, so I see Gary.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.300]  Whoa, these guys.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.300]  Oh, wait, no, sorry. GH Europe
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.300]  was above that.
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.890]  Monsanto.
[01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:47.890]  So, this is even more specific.
[01:21:47.890 --> 01:21:49.890]  Did GH
[01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:51.890]  start in Europe? No, they
[01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:53.890]  started by getting Larry
[01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:55.890]  in General Hydroponics Europe.
[01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:57.890]  I'm 99% sure
[01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:59.890]  that it was started up in
[01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:01.890]  NorCal by Larry.
[01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:03.890]  General Hydroponics is the correct answer, but
[01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:05.890]  General Hydroponics Europe is not the correct
[01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:07.890]  answer. Unless somebody can prove me
[01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.890]  wrong. I mean, we can Google it, but.
[01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:11.890]  Okay,
[01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:13.890]  and Chris Holding, any complaints you
[01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:15.890]  have can go right there.
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:17.890]  Uh-huh.
[01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:21.990]  So.
[01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:23.990]  You're not
[01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:25.990]  going to see the sun today. You're going to
[01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:27.990]  be answering emails.
[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:29.990]  No, no, I'm not doing any email answer until
[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:33.390]  tomorrow.
[01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:35.390]  All right, so then.
[01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:40.200]  Oh, yep.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200]  He only needs one seed. I like it.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:47.780]  So,
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.780]  I guess, in
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.780]  closing, how's the last question?
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.780]  I got a great last question.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.780]  Okay, wait. So, just quickly.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.780]  Who won that one if
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:59.780]  adding the word Europe was too
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.780]  much? Oh, I don't know. We've got to scroll
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:05.820]  way back now.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.820]  And now I can't even find.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:11.090]  I don't know. That's
[01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:13.090]  the Sakurabu.
[01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:15.090]  Jake Paul.
[01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.090]  The
[01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:19.090]  Gracie Killer.
[01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:21.090]  Did you watch that,
[01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:23.090]  by the way? I didn't see it.
[01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:53.090]  Ben Askren is bad. Ben Askren was the guy who got
[01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:55.090]  kneed by Masvidal.
[01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:57.090]  He's also the guy who went like 16 straight
[01:23:57.090 --> 01:23:59.090]  in Bellator.
[01:23:59.090 --> 01:24:01.090]  16 straight wins.
[01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:03.090]  Got kneed by
[01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.090]  Jorge Masvidal
[01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:07.090]  for the fastest knockout ever
[01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.090]  in the UFC.
[01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:11.090]  After beating Robby Lawler with a choke
[01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:13.090]  that I didn't think was all that great. But, you know, I have
[01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:15.090]  a lot of, or I had a lot of respect for Ben Askren.
[01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:17.090]  Then he didn't train for this at all. He went
[01:24:17.090 --> 01:24:19.090]  down at like a
[01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:21.090]  minute and 59 seconds of the
[01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:23.090]  first round and got knocked. TKO.
[01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:25.090]  You know, he stood back up, but it was a
[01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.090]  TKO.
[01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:29.090]  Really disappointing. And the whole YouTube stuff,
[01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:31.090]  I mean, whatever.
[01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:33.090]  I just, I don't like the attitude. I feel like he's the
[01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:35.090]  Kardashians of boxing, Jake Paul.
[01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:37.090]  And he wants you to hate him.
[01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:39.090]  You know, it's like the guy's making money off of people
[01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:41.090]  hating him. But it's not my kind of boxing.
[01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:43.090]  I'm a Mike Tyson fan.
[01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:45.090]  Maybe one day we'll be able to get Mike Tyson on the
[01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:47.090]  show. I met him in 2006. Really nice
[01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:49.090]  guy. I love
[01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.090]  the art of boxing.
[01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:53.090]  And I mean, it's just amazing to
[01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:55.090]  watch these guys that train so hard.
[01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.090]  But the Paul brothers, yeah, I'm not a fan.
[01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:59.090]  They're mids
[01:24:59.090 --> 01:25:04.340]  for sure.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.340]  So yeah, it's
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.340]  totally embarrassing situation. They're very
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.340]  off topic for what we talk about here. I don't
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.340]  talk a lot about the Jiu Jitsu, even though
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.340]  I think Jiu Jitsu is amazing.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.340]  And I think MMA is amazing.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.340]  I think Gordon Ryan, as far as Jiu Jitsu,
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.340]  that dude is friggin legendary.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.340]  Mike Tyson will bite
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:24.340]  your ear off. Yeah.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.340]  Mike Tyson's amazing. He's in cannabis
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.340]  now too. Talk about athletes
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:30.340]  going to cannabis and cannabis going to
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:32.340]  athletes.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.340]  Anyway, guys, I really appreciate
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.340]  you chiming in. We're going to end
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.340]  this with one more trivia question.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.340]  More Jiu Jitsu. We should have a show just on
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.340]  Jiu Jitsu and Cannabis. I would love to be able to interview
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.340]  people that smoke
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.340]  and train and talk about why it's
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.340]  beneficial. I think
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.340]  for me and my perspective
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.340]  with sports, weightlifting, Jiu Jitsu
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.340]  and Cannabis,
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.340]  it kind of takes me out of my head. And so I'm
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.340]  not thinking about it. I'm just moving and flowing.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.340]  You're able to kind of not think
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.340]  about it and just do it. And I think
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.340]  some people can naturally
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:08.340]  do that. Some people enjoy using Cannabis
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.340]  to do that. And I think
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:15.280]  it's a great way to do it.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280]  So anyway,
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.280]  one more question.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  Let's see.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  What episode of the James Loud
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.280]  show is this week?
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.280]  What episode was this? First person to get
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.280]  the answer, we're going to send them a pack
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.280]  of seeds. But we may
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  be wrong.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.280]  Really? With the episode numbering. Let me
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  just... I know.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  We are wrong. I noticed that when
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  you sent it, but I was like...
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280]  We start in 20 minutes.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280]  So I was just like, it's good enough.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  Yep.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.280]  I know. It's a trick question, guys.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.280]  What episode should it be? How about that?
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.280]  What is the true answer to the question?
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.280]  Not what was posted online.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.280]  I see the answer.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.280]  Fuck.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  I think I just blew past it.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  Real answer?
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280]  Because I'm seeing all the wrong answers.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.280]  Oh no, I see one.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.280]  25.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.280]  Sub 10.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  There was a misprint that went out that it was episode
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.280]  24, but truthfully it was episode...
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.280]  Wait, but there are a whole bunch of answers above
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.280]  them. Oh wait, Mike Denver also
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  had 25. Upstrong Style. Oh wait.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.280]  Is that above it?
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.280]  Yeah, these are all...
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.280]  Alright, it looks like
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  Adam Bolton.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.280]  Brother of Michael.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.220]  Michael Bolton's brother.
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.220]  Yeah,
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.220]  from Office Space, though.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.220]  One of the greatest
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:52.220]  movies of all time. Such a good movie.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.220]  Mike Bolton.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:58.220]  Anyway, guys, well I appreciate you
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.220]  for checking
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.220]  us out this week. It was a short episode.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.220]  We're going to end it on that.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.220]  Peter and I are going to both go hang
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.220]  out in the sun. I'm in NorCal. He's in SoCal
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.220]  with his family.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.220]  We're going to do some rollerblading
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.220]  with Gemma. Nice.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.220]  I'm going to jump in the pool. It's like
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:18.220]  70 degrees now in the pool. 67
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.220]  degrees, I think. Yay.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.220]  It's freezing cold if you don't know about
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.220]  pool temps.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.220]  Alright.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.220]  Okay. Well, you guys have a great week.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.220]  Happy 420 Check Me Out on the Adam Dunn Show.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.220]  We're going to be doing more giveaways on there.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.220]  Peace and pot.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.220]  Love and light.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.220]  Alright. See you, everyone.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.220]  Peace out.
