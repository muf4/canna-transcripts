[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  At the very end, yeah.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  All right, we're live, I think it says.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Oh, hello.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  We are.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  I think that means we're live. Okay, so the comments will all come in here.
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  You can see the comments, right?
[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  Yes.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  All right, cool.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  All right, well, we'll wait for people to roll in. Let's see.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  What's going on? Good vibes, chirp says,
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  Woo, barely made it. I'm so excited we're having this chat.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  I feel like it's been a long time coming.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  For sure.
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for having me.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  It's, I haven't seen you for, since Vegas.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  I know, you know, I didn't go this year.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Did you go last year?
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  Nah.
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  I might want to go to, I mean, I might want to go next year.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  I'm not, I'm not sure.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  Right.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  But that was fun.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Honestly, like, meeting you,
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  meeting your nephew too, right?
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Wait, your nephew?
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  Yes.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  Man, that was a good time.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  I hadn't been back in like, so that was the first time I had been in like 10 or 11 years.
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  And the last time I was there,
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  cannabis was still completely illegal in Vegas.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  Right.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Which was just strange.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  It was like, we were smoking behind like dumpsters and stuff, you know?
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  Like hiding it.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  It's like a felony.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Nevada's like conservative.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Oh, it's true.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  It's wild to see like that,
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  to where I feel like cannabis is
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  as pervasive as like cigarettes now there.
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  Yeah, I was just walking the strip like we're smoking weed.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  And I mean, it's like,
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  it's interesting because they don't let the medical dispensaries,
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  they don't let the adult use dispensaries come on the strip.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Right.
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  Like, so we saw all of the like converted synthetics instead.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  You know, it was just interesting.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Like,
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  I found that to be like, you know,
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  I don't know.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  I don't know.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  I don't know.
[01:52.000 --> 01:54.000]  It's like, you know, I don't know.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  A strange thing.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.000]  But all right, so let's dive in.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  So I'm really excited to talk to you because when we connected,
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  I spent like so much time,
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  like a lot of my most favorite childhood memories are in Hawaii.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  And it's the place where I first learned about connecting to the earth.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  And it's the first location that I ever felt connected to nature in.
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  Especially, I was raised in Southern California.
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  So, you know, like my mom's family is from Big Island, but like I was raised in SoCal.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  So I was like a mainlander, you know, and cannabis culture in Hawaii is huge,
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  pervasive, like important.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  And I'm really excited to talk to you about it and to talk to you about it
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  specifically from the perspective of advocating for patients like medical value and
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  what's currently going on right now,
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  because there's some really not good stuff happening in Hawaii right now.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Not good. Not good.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  No. Yeah. Do you want to?
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  So I guess maybe we'll just go through.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Let's introduce ourselves. So I'll let you introduce yourself.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  Okay. So, my name is Mei Fui Ma'unopo.
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  I'm a family nurse practitioner and I founded the Malia Cannabis Clinic in 2016.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  So we're the first nurse-led cannabis clinic in the state of Hawaii.
[03:18.000 --> 03:28.000]  And since then, we've done thousands of certifications, but, and also a ton of education
[03:28.000 --> 03:39.000]  and really lobbying and community organizing when it comes to cannabis and cannabis legislation.
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  It's so important to be involved.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  I feel like, so when we first met, we met through A-Chem, which if people are not aware,
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.000]  A-Chem is an awesome organization and is pushing education and medicine and equity.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  And I was so excited when we were on that meeting together,
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  because I actually think I just saw your TikTok that day.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Yes. Nice.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  And I was like, it was interesting.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  So I was thinking it being like, oh my gosh, Hawaii.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  I have such significant, I tend to put emotions into physical locations
[04:21.000 --> 04:28.000]  and I feel like I have a lot of emotion in Hawaii, just from a young age.
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  And it's so great to see medical professionals really for the community and helping your community.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  So I'm so excited and I'm so excited to have this chat.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  And for anyone who doesn't know who I am, I'm Miabi.
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  I'm a cannabinoid and psychedelic scientist.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  My PhD is in pharmaceutical sciences.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  I studied drug discovery in the system in the brain that interacts with cannabis.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  But then like actually halfway through my PhD was when I was like, oh wait,
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  pharmaceutical sciences is not necessarily the thing that I want to be researching.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  Although earlier today I was saying that I am extremely grateful for the context
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.000]  that pharmaceutical sciences has given me, because I was in drug discovery research.
[05:12.000 --> 05:18.000]  So I was in the level of research when we're actually looking at new lead compounds
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  and trying to create new synthetic cannabinoids.
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  And I think when you put the natural plant and the potential,
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  like the true therapeutic potential of the plant up against that,
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  I think it's a really clear contrast for what potential there is and what we should explore.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  I'm also a neurodiversity advocate and I talk a lot about mental health and cannabis.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  And I think it's really important that we share these experiences.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  So I've been starting to do that and on Project Chronic.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  And I think this is probably, this was you.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  When you said this, I was like, okay.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  Like this is the big three and these are the three things.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  And I want to talk about all three of them in the context of Hawaii,
[06:03.000 --> 06:09.000]  in the context of the history that Hawaii has with the plant,
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  but also the history that Hawaii has being colonized first,
[06:14.000 --> 06:22.000]  like to use as plantation labor and then later converted into tourism.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  And it's a transformation that the islands have gone through years and years.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Many island cultures, Hawaii is not unique in that and going through that,
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.000]  but Hawaii has its own very distinctive experience that it has had from that colonization,
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  from the sugarcane plantations and then from the pineapple industry and then more.
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000]  So I think it would be awesome to talk about these big three.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  So what were you thinking when you said the big three?
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  I like that. I want to use that now. I like it.
[06:51.000 --> 07:00.000]  Yeah. I mean, because when you look at cannabis, the plant is one thing.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  The culture is another thing.
[07:02.000 --> 07:11.000]  So for people who are younger, like cannabis culture has evolved and has changed.
[07:11.000 --> 07:20.000]  Because like cannabis culture from the 90s is super different from cannabis culture now.
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  Because like in the 90s, half of these people,
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  well, I would say 80 percent of these people who own dispensaries would never be able to get weed.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  Because it was like this whole bedding and it was different.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  And now I think that the culture has changed.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  We have people using vapes, cannabis vapes everywhere.
[07:50.000 --> 07:58.000]  And that would have definitely not flown even a decade ago.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  I find it interesting that then civics.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  So it's fascinating to me, the evolution of culture,
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  and then even just myself navigating different aspects of that culture.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  Because I always think that increased accessibility is positive and important.
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  But at the same time, it's currently coming at a dilution of our culture.
[08:23.000 --> 08:33.000]  Like it's coming at a loss, I think, to what ideals and morals and ethics
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  and like what the plant has stood for for us, like spiritually and culturally for so long.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  And I've only recently gotten more involved in the civics aspect of it.
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  Because to be totally honest, I was like a completely disengaged, hopeless,
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  like, oh, I shouldn't even be paying attention to any of this type person until very recently.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  It was shockingly recent that it was like, oh, OK, I think that maybe I should be tuning in.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Because if not, then I'm part of the problem type of like a moment.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  And it was because one of my friends told me it was like he was like a relatively new friend at the time.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  And he was like, we're talking about politics.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  And I was like, I don't really like politics.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  And he's like, you're in cannabis science.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  So you're in politics.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  You don't have a choice.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  You're a city no matter what.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  Oops.
[09:26.000 --> 09:27.000]  Oh, shit.
[09:27.000 --> 09:28.000]  Yeah.
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Like there's no way that I dropped these people on the ground.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  Yeah, there's no way that you can get away from that.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Like, you know, like it.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  So I think that here are some of the questions that I here are some of the questions that I had that I was thinking when we were chatting about what we thought was the best like outline.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  Because one of the things I really want to talk about is quality of medicine.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  And like one of the questions then is what is medicine and the idea of medicine?
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  And this is like something that's been evolving for me over the last few weeks.
[10:03.000 --> 10:13.000]  Like I've been sort of redefining what I think about medicine, what I think about what it what criteria it takes for something to be medicine.
[10:15.000 --> 10:27.000]  And yeah, I wanted to know your perspective, because to me now I have been thinking more about parts of medicine that are unquantifiable, like parts that we can't put a number to.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  And you and I, as people who are like nerds, basically, like we want to put a number to something.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  But like, I guess I want to know what your thoughts are on that.
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  I've been just wrapping my head around that, that there's so many parts and aspects to medicine that we can't put a number on.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  And so we can't measure it, you know?
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  Absolutely.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's almost like I feel like just the environment that it's grown in changes cannabis too.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  And we see that a lot in Hawaii.
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  Like, for instance, I had friends that grew and they had this huge lychee farm.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  And so literally all of their cannabis had like that little lychee bag.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  No matter what, they grew because it was in their compost, right?
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  It was like...
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  Yeah.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  Oh, man.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  Oh, man, that's cool.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  But it's something that we could never measure, right?
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  Like we could never like test for that.
[11:31.000 --> 11:39.000]  So, you know, I think that cannabis, it's like all and I respect all forms of it.
[11:40.000 --> 11:50.000]  You know, even the synthetic, you know, and or, you know, what we're seeing a lot now with like some of the more manufactured products, you know?
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  So you do?
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  You support like the THCO and like...
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  Not all of it, but I think some of...
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  I think it's nice to be able to have CBG.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  That's fair.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  And CBN.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  Yeah, I think being able to have...
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  I think being able to extract CBG and CBN is valuable.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  I mean, but when you get to some of the other formulations, I'm like...
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  Yeah, I think like on one hand, I feel like regulation control is possibly like, you know, possibly a problem we should think about.
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  I also think that like it's a problem of access because people who have access to like, look at this flower.
[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  Like if people who have access to that flower are not going to really like gravitate heavily towards the synthetics.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  They have access to the real medicine and the synthetics really prosper in the markets that don't have access.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  And it's like, it's just like another example of how...
[12:54.000 --> 13:04.000]  I feel like it's another one of those examples where how prohibition is making things more dangerous because you're creating, you know, you're driving people to do that.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  And yeah, I just think like I'm not opposed to any of the synthetics either.
[13:11.000 --> 13:23.000]  Like I don't... I actually follow a strict guideline of not really judging anyone for any of the things that they do or would potentially benefit from because I don't...
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  I'm not inside their body and like having their experience.
[13:27.000 --> 13:37.000]  So I know I've heard a lot of qualitative stories from people who really value the synthetics medicinally and that it's access and stuff for them, you know.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  So, but OK, so I will say that I love flower.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Yeah, same. I mean, that's always been my preference.
[13:47.000 --> 14:00.000]  And I think we could go into the science about that for forever, but I'd like to take a moment and go into the part about flower that is tied to Hawaii's cultural heritage, ancestral spiritual practices.
[14:01.000 --> 14:06.000]  Let's talk about terroir. Like, let's talk about like the land race strains.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  Like everyone's heard of Maui Waui.
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.000]  Like, I mean, I will never forget the first time that I saw Half Baked with Dave Chappelle.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  I had this one part of the movie stuck in my head for like a year.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  He goes, Maui Waui.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  It's just like, oh man. But, you know, I've never smoked Maui Waui.
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like if most people were given Maui Waui, they would be like, ew, what's the schwag?
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  You know, like that land races, they look different.
[14:41.000 --> 14:43.000]  They do. They're almost like they're seedy. They're long.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  They are. And they're like long and they're like thin.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  They're like long and thin.
[14:54.000 --> 15:07.000]  Yeah. And if you look at I think it's like High Times, like 78 or something, they have pictures of like Maui Waui and people would probably look at it now and be like, ew.
[15:08.000 --> 15:24.910]  And, you know, Hawaii has had such an intense eradication cannabis program that, you know, a lot of these strains, they do exist, but, you know, they're different.
[15:25.910 --> 15:33.910]  You know, I think that our eradication has probably been one of the most aggressive in the nation.
[15:33.910 --> 15:39.910]  You know, so if we look at, you know, Hawaii's relationship, like when did it come?
[15:40.910 --> 15:47.910]  You know, cannabis was brought here. It's not it's not like native to Hawaii.
[15:48.910 --> 15:50.910]  Did it come from the did it come from Asia?
[15:51.910 --> 15:59.910]  So these are great questions. And so the thought is that it probably came with the whalers.
[15:59.910 --> 16:13.910]  OK. Which would make sense because if you look at like contact, right, like, you know, Hawaii is one of the most isolated island change in the Pacific.
[16:14.910 --> 16:16.910]  So, you know, first it was definitely Polynesians.
[16:17.910 --> 16:18.910]  It's not close to anything.
[16:19.910 --> 16:20.910]  It is not. Yeah.
[16:21.910 --> 16:29.910]  And so, you know, of course, Polynesians and Polynesians would go back and forth and we shared with each other.
[16:30.910 --> 16:35.910]  But then after that, it was really like Captain Cook, whalers.
[16:36.910 --> 16:42.910]  Some people say Captain Cook brought cannabis here because, you know, his botanist was really into him.
[16:43.910 --> 16:49.910]  But I don't believe that because his botanist wasn't with Captain Cook when he came here.
[16:50.910 --> 17:00.910]  And and with the relationship that we have with Captain Cook, I don't think people would take the plant that he had brought and been like stoked on it.
[17:01.910 --> 17:02.910]  Yeah.
[17:03.910 --> 17:04.910]  Oh, man.
[17:05.910 --> 17:09.910]  I think it was whalers because, you know, it had to have been grown here.
[17:10.910 --> 17:17.910]  And this was when we actually saw Hawaii's the way that we grew food changed.
[17:17.910 --> 17:18.910]  Huh.
[17:19.910 --> 17:21.910]  Was with the whalers. So it would make sense.
[17:22.910 --> 17:23.910]  But then you were growing crops.
[17:24.910 --> 17:31.910]  Yes. When it was brought in because the the whalers, you know, it was huge out here and the whalers didn't.
[17:32.910 --> 17:36.910]  They weren't into like, you know, fish, poi, traditional food.
[17:37.910 --> 17:38.910]  Yeah. So that you had to have agriculture, basically.
[17:39.910 --> 17:40.910]  Yes.
[17:41.910 --> 17:44.910]  Yeah. So it's the beginning of agriculture and the end of hunter-gatherer forage.
[17:44.910 --> 17:45.910]  Like, well, not.
[17:46.910 --> 17:50.910]  But it was the beginning of like foreign more foreign agriculture.
[17:51.910 --> 17:59.910]  Right. Like growing, you know, because Hawaii and Polynesia has always been very agrarian.
[18:00.910 --> 18:08.910]  We've always grown fish, you know, raised raised animals once once they were brought in.
[18:08.910 --> 18:14.910]  But but yeah, for I mean, it's that's kind of the thought.
[18:15.910 --> 18:22.910]  And we first started seeing it written about in the Hawaiian language newspaper, Kānōna Nōna, in the 1800s.
[18:23.910 --> 18:25.910]  Oh, wow. OK, so, I mean, that was a long time ago.
[18:26.910 --> 18:33.910]  Like the first the first official mention of it in like Western science is the Royal British Society in the early 1800s.
[18:33.910 --> 18:40.910]  So that's like in the same timeline of being in awareness.
[18:41.910 --> 18:44.910]  So I'm glad you mentioned Maui Waui, the land-raised strain, like looking different.
[18:45.910 --> 19:02.910]  And it's something that I wanted to talk about just in terms of like history of a location and history of the earth and the relationship with the plants that grow on it and like natural medicines from where we live and where we are currently at.
[19:03.910 --> 19:05.910]  I think that that's something really important to preserve.
[19:06.910 --> 19:08.910]  And I'm really into land-raised strains.
[19:09.910 --> 19:22.910]  I've been like really curious about them for years, but this year I'm going to be more like actively interested in them because I think that it's really important to study what would grow just like on the side of a hill.
[19:23.910 --> 19:24.910]  It's supposed to grow like a weed.
[19:25.910 --> 19:27.910]  And actually, it's really good at remediating soil.
[19:28.910 --> 19:30.910]  So it's a really good like regeneration crop.
[19:30.910 --> 19:37.910]  So I didn't know that about Hawaii having the most aggressive eradication program.
[19:38.910 --> 19:39.910]  I didn't know that.
[19:40.910 --> 19:41.910]  Yeah.
[19:41.910 --> 19:50.910]  So and it's kind of what started the medical legalization issues.
[19:51.910 --> 19:58.910]  So also randomly, Hawaii passed the first medical cannabis laws in the United States ever in 1978.
[19:58.910 --> 20:00.910]  It was just never enacted.
[20:01.910 --> 20:08.910]  And that bill, I think it was like SB 1217, I forget.
[20:09.910 --> 20:26.910]  But that bill was the one that kind of went on to help model Prop 215 in California, which was of course their medical bill that they, it was one that you know, it was in like 94?
[20:26.910 --> 20:27.910]  96.
[20:27.910 --> 20:28.910]  96.
[20:28.910 --> 20:29.910]  Yeah.
[20:30.910 --> 20:37.910]  So we, Hawaii had the first, one of the first, I think it was Hawaii and New Mexico.
[20:37.910 --> 20:39.910]  No, it was 1978.
[20:40.910 --> 20:58.910]  And so what happened with cannabis and Hawaii in the 70s is when all of our Vietnam, you know, soldiers went to Vietnam, that is where they got seeds.
[20:59.910 --> 21:04.910]  And they brought these seeds back and then they bred them here.
[21:04.910 --> 21:11.910]  And that's how we ended up with all of these like beautiful lands, land race strains.
[21:11.910 --> 21:17.910]  But they were originally from, you know, like Vietnam brought over by the soldiers.
[21:18.910 --> 21:30.910]  And so really like what we saw in like the 70s and 80s was this abundance of cannabis grows, cannabis farms.
[21:31.910 --> 21:40.910]  And it was like the end of the 80s is when Hawaii got designated as a high intensity drug trafficking area.
[21:40.910 --> 21:41.910]  Right?
[21:41.910 --> 21:43.910]  Man, the 80s were a time.
[21:44.910 --> 21:47.910]  80s, 90s, early thousands.
[21:47.910 --> 21:53.910]  Like, but seriously, I feel like the 80s is when it started, when it was basically just like, we don't like black and brown people.
[21:53.910 --> 21:54.910]  We don't.
[21:54.910 --> 21:58.910]  Like, that was just like the theme of that entire, like two decades.
[21:58.910 --> 22:08.910]  I feel like, oh man, I, I didn't know that, but it makes a lot of sense because the climate I feel like would be, it's really tropical.
[22:08.910 --> 22:09.910]  Right.
[22:09.910 --> 22:21.910]  Like, and it seems like maybe that would be actually a more natural place for cannabis to sort of make that jump as opposed to like the more like arid, like desert, you know, like desert strains.
[22:21.910 --> 22:27.910]  Which I think, okay, this is just like a random fun fact, but I learned this last week and I think it's so cool.
[22:27.910 --> 22:32.910]  So I'm telling everyone who knows endocannabinoid system stuff because it's so cool.
[22:32.910 --> 22:38.910]  So there's this YouTube video of these, like a bunch of older guys, I think they're in Afghanistan and they're smoking.
[22:38.910 --> 22:39.910]  They're like, let me show you how we smoke hash.
[22:39.910 --> 22:50.910]  And they have this like giant pipe and they have a really hot stone and they like shove this giant pipe full of hash on this stone and then like, like take a big hit of just like a giant hash.
[22:50.910 --> 22:54.910]  And they're all taking turns on this like giant clay pipe of hash.
[22:54.910 --> 22:59.910]  And they're talking about it and they're like, yeah, like makes you feel good, whatever.
[22:59.910 --> 23:02.910]  But then they're like, and it keeps you cool.
[23:02.910 --> 23:04.910]  That it keeps you cool.
[23:04.910 --> 23:06.910]  And I was thinking about it.
[23:06.910 --> 23:08.910]  So I also want to talk to you about this because Hawaii is hot and humid.
[23:08.910 --> 23:17.910]  And like, I think it's really fascinating because I've always talked about how one of the biggest negative effects from THC that I get is I get cold.
[23:17.910 --> 23:20.910]  I get really bad induced hypothermia.
[23:20.910 --> 23:27.910]  And I was thinking about it and I was like, yeah, but if I was really hot, then that would just make a lot of sense.
[23:27.910 --> 23:30.910]  So I thought it was fascinating because it's an ancient use.
[23:30.910 --> 23:40.910]  And I think it's one of the reasons why, especially island cultures, like warmer climates, you know, there is like a real, that's not even medicinal at that point.
[23:40.910 --> 23:42.910]  That's just like your quality of life.
[23:42.910 --> 23:44.910]  Yeah, no.
[23:44.910 --> 23:49.910]  And I mean, you know, it's like very much with like the, you know, the scientists and us.
[23:49.910 --> 23:52.910]  So it's like, it's the TRPV receptor, right?
[23:52.910 --> 23:58.910]  And, and that's why we're seeing all of this really cool like temperature regulation stuff.
[23:58.910 --> 24:04.910]  So I always say like with topicals, if you want it to work better, use a little heat first.
[24:04.910 --> 24:05.910]  Yeah.
[24:05.910 --> 24:10.910]  Because it's really going to bust those, you know, those, those pathways open, right?
[24:10.910 --> 24:12.910]  It's just going to open them up.
[24:13.910 --> 24:29.910]  And so, and, you know, if you even look back into the United States history, that was one of the big things with like the Mexican immigrant workers was also they, they talked a lot about that as well.
[24:29.910 --> 24:40.910]  Really? Yeah, it's, it's so, so for the thing with cannabis and like, so that brings me to like the last question on this slide, which is like, who should be empowered to produce this medicine in Hawaii?
[24:40.910 --> 24:48.910]  It's like, I mean, you and I are like, obviously we know the answer to that question, but there are people out there.
[24:48.910 --> 24:53.910]  There are groups of people out there, right?
[24:53.910 --> 25:01.910]  Who would argue or would believe that it should be actually I got a few comments on them on, on Instagram, right?
[25:02.910 --> 25:11.910]  Like the regulation is the only way and that that's the only way to be able to produce it.
[25:11.910 --> 25:24.910]  But the question that like, I think that one of the main issues that we come to when we're talking about, like you and I are talking about cannabis as a medicine and we're talking about the science of it and the science of it being so complex.
[25:24.910 --> 25:30.910]  I mean, there's, there's other aspects to this that, because like we fully understand how much there is left to study.
[25:30.910 --> 25:32.910]  It's not about just growing the plant.
[25:32.910 --> 25:35.910]  It's not just like, oh yeah, you grow it and cannabis is cannabis.
[25:35.910 --> 25:38.910]  Like it's so much more than that.
[25:38.910 --> 25:45.910]  And also like when it comes to what's happening right now to you guys, like, so what is this, what is this bill?
[25:45.910 --> 25:47.910]  The bill is actually for legalization.
[25:47.910 --> 25:48.910]  Is that the.
[25:49.910 --> 25:57.910]  So we were able to kill the legalization bill here, which was actually really awesome.
[25:57.910 --> 26:06.910]  And I know like I never, ever in a million years thought that I would support killing a legalization bill.
[26:06.910 --> 26:10.910]  But it was something that was super important.
[26:10.910 --> 26:16.910]  So what they did was instead, you know, of course, they put it into another bill.
[26:16.910 --> 26:20.910]  So now we have SB 962.
[26:20.910 --> 26:28.910]  And so what this one is doing, I'm, I'm looking at it right now.
[26:28.910 --> 26:43.910]  So, so basically it is for any cultivation, handling, possession or manufacturing.
[26:43.910 --> 26:49.910]  And because it just says manufacturing, it's not a specific, right?
[26:49.910 --> 26:52.910]  So manufacturing is, is every product, right?
[26:52.910 --> 26:55.910]  Everything that is not cannabis.
[26:55.910 --> 26:56.910]  It has to be.
[26:56.910 --> 26:57.910]  Yeah, free rolls, etc.
[26:57.910 --> 26:58.910]  Right.
[26:58.910 --> 27:04.910]  I mean, you know, if you're, if you're making, if you're putting cannabis and oil, that's a manufactured product, right?
[27:04.910 --> 27:05.910]  Yep.
[27:05.910 --> 27:12.910]  So it can only be obtained if the person does it themselves.
[27:12.910 --> 27:17.910]  So if you make it for yourself, you can use that product.
[27:17.910 --> 27:31.910]  Or if it's, it's from the dispensary, which, and then from caregivers, but they're, they're really, so what they're doing.
[27:31.910 --> 27:34.910]  So Hawaii has a lot of collectives.
[27:35.910 --> 27:39.910]  So basically people, you know, it's been, it's been going on for years.
[27:39.910 --> 27:43.910]  California was really big and into collectives as well.
[27:43.910 --> 27:47.910]  So essentially every card gets 10 plants.
[27:47.910 --> 27:50.910]  I am unable to grow the 10 plants in my house.
[27:50.910 --> 27:51.910]  Say I live in a condo.
[27:51.910 --> 27:56.910]  So I put my card at someone's house that has a farm.
[27:56.910 --> 27:58.910]  They, they grow my 10 plants.
[27:58.910 --> 28:01.910]  I helped take care of it.
[28:01.910 --> 28:05.910]  And then it's the harvest is, is shared, right?
[28:05.910 --> 28:06.910]  Okay.
[28:06.910 --> 28:07.910]  Yeah.
[28:07.910 --> 28:08.910]  That's better than what we have here.
[28:08.910 --> 28:14.910]  Cause, cause what we have is that you could do that, but then every plant has to be tagged.
[28:14.910 --> 28:25.910]  So it's not shared as a collective, like at the end of it, which is hard because you don't want just like all of one strain or like what happens if your one plant is dotted or something, you know what I mean?
[28:25.910 --> 28:28.910]  Like, yeah, I like that model.
[28:28.910 --> 28:34.910]  So every, every plant has to be tagged with the person's registration.
[28:34.910 --> 28:35.910]  Right.
[28:35.910 --> 28:36.910]  Yeah.
[28:36.910 --> 28:44.910]  And then typically it's, it's shared what, you know, within the community, however people do that.
[28:44.910 --> 28:45.910]  Right.
[28:45.910 --> 28:46.910]  Yep.
[28:46.910 --> 28:52.910]  And what they, so right now Hawaii, it's currently unlimited.
[28:53.910 --> 29:05.910]  So this session has been all about like killing these collectives and basically forcing everybody to have to go into the dispensary.
[29:05.910 --> 29:06.910]  Right.
[29:06.910 --> 29:07.910]  Right.
[29:07.910 --> 29:18.910]  And, and a lot of the big messaging has been that cannabis that's grown home grow that's grown from a collective isn't safe.
[29:19.910 --> 29:25.910]  We had a member of our house go on the news and say that last night, which is just wild.
[29:25.910 --> 29:26.910]  Right.
[29:26.910 --> 29:27.910]  Yeah.
[29:27.910 --> 29:28.910]  No, it's wild.
[29:28.910 --> 29:36.910]  I mean, also it's like, it's frustrating because like the easy fix for that is to subsidize testing.
[29:36.910 --> 29:37.910]  Yes.
[29:37.910 --> 29:45.910]  Like, and that's a government fix and everyone like, they're definitely capable like of implementing programs where they support home grow.
[29:45.910 --> 29:49.910]  And there's actually like a ton of evidence, just like, I'm saying this, like there's a ton of evidence.
[29:49.910 --> 29:51.910]  I don't actually know if there's a peer reviewed study.
[29:51.910 --> 30:00.910]  I'm going to tell you that like my lips, mouth and lungs evidence that quality home grow has almost always beaten anything that's come from like a mass production.
[30:00.910 --> 30:07.910]  And I think that people know that when they drink beer, people know that when you eat food, you know, that just in general.
[30:07.910 --> 30:12.910]  And I think that we forget it, but like, you know, cannabis is an agricultural product.
[30:12.910 --> 30:13.910]  It's a plant.
[30:13.910 --> 30:23.910]  And so just like other plants, you could buy it at Walmart or a market basket, or you could go to a farm stand and get it from someone who is growing it.
[30:23.910 --> 30:26.910]  And those are all choices and accessibility issues.
[30:26.910 --> 30:33.910]  But I think like one of the things that struck me was that you couldn't make edibles or topicals.
[30:33.910 --> 30:36.910]  Like, I think that's ridiculous.
[30:36.910 --> 30:44.910]  I think that that specifically targets people who use medically because a lot of medical users will use everything.
[30:44.910 --> 30:48.910]  Like I use topicals, edible, like I use everything.
[30:48.910 --> 30:50.910]  So, you know what I mean?
[30:50.910 --> 30:56.910]  And then a lot of medical users do it themselves because it's not cheap and it's not covered by our insurance.
[30:56.910 --> 31:01.910]  So, you know, and it's better often when you do it yourself.
[31:02.910 --> 31:10.910]  And then what you see is this like gaslighting where they're like, well, we're saying you can make your own edibles.
[31:10.910 --> 31:14.910]  You just can't buy them from anybody but a dispensary.
[31:14.910 --> 31:15.910]  Right.
[31:15.910 --> 31:20.910]  And so it turns into semantics because they're like, we're not banning it.
[31:20.910 --> 31:23.910]  Or like, yeah, you actually are.
[31:23.910 --> 31:27.910]  You're making something that's currently allowed, not allowed.
[31:27.910 --> 31:34.910]  There's like some I'm sure there's like a fancy term for this, but I'm not like learned in sociology or politics or whatever.
[31:34.910 --> 31:36.910]  But I'm sure there's a term for this.
[31:36.910 --> 31:41.910]  There's a way to like dissuade people from doing something without outright banning it.
[31:41.910 --> 31:48.910]  There's a way to like inconvenience it or in a way to frame it that, you know, that also comes with it.
[31:48.910 --> 31:53.910]  And I think it's complicated because on one hand, like testing is good.
[31:54.910 --> 31:57.910]  I think that regulation can be I think it's good.
[31:57.910 --> 32:00.910]  I think it's good to be able to do it at the same time.
[32:00.910 --> 32:02.910]  Like it's crazy expensive.
[32:02.910 --> 32:05.910]  And the machines themselves are pretty expensive.
[32:05.910 --> 32:07.910]  Like the ability to do the tests.
[32:07.910 --> 32:10.910]  Like I can see how there's like huge overhead on that.
[32:10.910 --> 32:21.910]  But if that is our concern, completely getting rid of the legacy market or any of the history that's present in Hawaii would only be a detriment to like the thought.
[32:21.910 --> 32:28.910]  Like to just like I guess like at least at least hundreds of years of medicine from Hawaii.
[32:28.910 --> 32:33.910]  But like that and then if not, then where did that knowledge come from and how did it transfer over?
[32:33.910 --> 32:39.910]  It would just be, you know, it's something that I'm conscious of because someone asked me recently.
[32:39.910 --> 32:43.910]  They were from Australia and they have only medical there.
[32:43.910 --> 32:45.910]  You will. And so like it's interesting.
[32:45.910 --> 32:55.910]  The question was when adult use comes around, like is there anything like to be worried about or like what's the thing that you would be worried about?
[32:55.910 --> 33:15.910]  And I feel like one thing that I've thought is something that is happening is a dilution of like not just culture, but of medicine and community around that medicine and what it means to the people who create it.
[33:15.910 --> 33:19.910]  Because it's not it's not the same for everyone.
[33:19.910 --> 33:20.910]  I think it's okay.
[33:20.910 --> 33:22.910]  I think that there should be like multiple options.
[33:22.910 --> 33:24.910]  But one shouldn't have complete control over the other.
[33:24.910 --> 33:26.910]  And I think that that's part of what we see happen.
[33:26.910 --> 33:27.910]  You know?
[33:27.910 --> 33:28.910]  Yeah.
[33:28.910 --> 33:37.910]  And I think that's nationwide where all of the licensing is so expensive that it becomes prohibitive.
[33:37.910 --> 33:46.910]  But here, you know, in Hawaii with our collectives, I mean, they're amazing.
[33:47.910 --> 33:59.910]  They seriously grow some of the best cannabis that, you know, that I've seen and, you know, been all over the United States at least and up into Canada.
[33:59.910 --> 34:05.910]  And preserving it is really, really, really important.
[34:05.910 --> 34:11.910]  And it's at the forefront because we believe that they can both exist.
[34:11.910 --> 34:14.910]  We just don't want to get the collectives killed.
[34:14.910 --> 34:19.910]  And, you know, in the name of legalization, it's not worth it.
[34:19.910 --> 34:20.910]  Yeah, absolutely.
[34:20.910 --> 34:29.910]  I mean, I think that I like overwhelmingly I lean towards just that everyone should have options and everyone should exist.
[34:29.910 --> 34:42.910]  And the main issue comes with one group having way more power over another group to either like promote or suffocate their ability to be a viable option for patients.
[34:42.910 --> 34:49.910]  And that specifically when it comes to something that is medicinal and something that I think that all of us do have like a right to have.
[34:49.910 --> 34:56.910]  But, you know, it's I think it's just it's something that we're navigating because it's never happened before.
[34:56.910 --> 34:59.910]  Like nothing of this of this exact thing.
[34:59.910 --> 35:00.910]  So, yeah.
[35:00.910 --> 35:07.910]  Anyways, I think that otherwise I was going to say our last thing, like there's there's characteristics that can be tested for.
[35:07.910 --> 35:17.910]  These are why I think that I think that normally it's the thing that unfortunately gets focused on at dispensaries because you have to.
[35:17.910 --> 35:27.910]  I mean, it's not it's not it's not the fault of any dispensary that when people come in on the menu like, well, you know what, maybe it is the fault.
[35:27.910 --> 35:33.910]  I mean, like why is the THC percentage the first thing that anyone sees about anything?
[35:33.910 --> 35:35.910]  Yeah, it's just a question.
[35:35.910 --> 35:44.910]  It's like, is it possible to create a choosing experience where the THC percentage isn't the focus of why people are purchasing something?
[35:44.910 --> 35:50.910]  You know, so this is just like I think this is just like a behavior thing.
[35:50.910 --> 35:59.910]  It's like let's say you walked into a dispensary and the like and all and then there wasn't any THC percentage, but you had like also there's like a lot of options.
[35:59.910 --> 36:02.910]  Let's say you have like 10 options for just flour.
[36:02.910 --> 36:09.910]  And instead of THC percentage, it was like, I don't know, in general, smell profile.
[36:09.910 --> 36:10.910]  The best thing I think would be able to smell it.
[36:10.910 --> 36:11.910]  But I get it.
[36:11.910 --> 36:13.910]  I've been talking to people and there's like problems with that.
[36:13.910 --> 36:15.910]  Can you do that in Hawaii?
[36:15.910 --> 36:17.910]  No, not in our dispensaries.
[36:17.910 --> 36:20.910]  OK, yeah, we can't do it either.
[36:20.910 --> 36:30.910]  Everything's prepackaged, like everything's like already in the little eighths and like, you know, all sealed up because it'd be great to be able to smell it.
[36:30.910 --> 36:32.910]  Like I can tell by the smell.
[36:32.910 --> 36:36.910]  Like I can just like, all right, that's no or like that's yes.
[36:36.910 --> 36:40.910]  But yeah, anyways, you you can't smell it in a lot of markets.
[36:40.910 --> 36:41.910]  And so that would be great.
[36:41.910 --> 36:43.910]  And I understand the problems with that.
[36:43.910 --> 36:50.910]  Like I've had many a conversation about it, but I've also thought of possible solutions that people could do.
[36:50.910 --> 36:51.910]  But I mean, it takes money.
[36:51.910 --> 36:57.910]  So it's like one solution I was thinking about was like if a company is vertical, right?
[36:57.910 --> 37:09.910]  So like they see the sale and then they were doing their extraction and then parts of like at some point they're going to use some extraction and throw it all into like a house blend or something or make it into some sort of distillate or whatever.
[37:10.910 --> 37:15.910]  They could like isolate all the terpenes first and like a cold finger or some other sort of trap.
[37:15.910 --> 37:27.910]  Right. And then get all the terpenes of that exact one from there and then use the other flower for distillery and then take that terpenes and dilute it and like glycol or whatever it is the perfume people use.
[37:27.910 --> 37:31.910]  Because like all those perfumes we buy in the store seem to last for a really long time.
[37:32.910 --> 37:35.910]  Yeah. So follow those formulations.
[37:35.910 --> 37:41.910]  Follow one of the perfume people formulations and spray it on a friggin post it or something.
[37:41.910 --> 37:44.910]  No, absolutely.
[37:44.910 --> 37:47.910]  And there's some great cannabis perfume out there.
[37:47.910 --> 37:49.910]  So, I mean, people are already doing it, right?
[37:49.910 --> 37:50.910]  Yeah.
[37:50.910 --> 37:51.910]  Yeah.
[37:51.910 --> 38:00.910]  I mean, I think that I think that it's doable to do it in a dispensary where then like, you know, people are looking at.
[38:00.910 --> 38:03.910]  But anyways, so there are qualities and characteristics that we can test for.
[38:03.910 --> 38:06.910]  And that's like THC percentage and terpene profile.
[38:06.910 --> 38:09.910]  But, you know, the terpene profile test results like they don't even mean anything to me.
[38:10.910 --> 38:22.910]  Like when I look at them, I'm like, I can't even tell if I would like the way this smells by looking at a percentage of like 20 to 30 terpenes, you know, like.
[38:22.910 --> 38:23.910]  Yeah.
[38:23.910 --> 38:33.910]  Most terpenes are so delicate too that like by the time they've been sitting on the shelf and flower, you know, a lot of them are probably a lot of them are complete.
[38:33.910 --> 38:35.910]  You know, they're not they're not there. Right?
[38:35.910 --> 38:37.910]  Yeah. Yeah.
[38:37.910 --> 38:49.910]  Yeah. And so, I mean, this is like I think that there's just all these issues that we're facing as also as advocates because it's so it is variable.
[38:49.910 --> 38:58.910]  And the things that we can test don't seem to be helping us like figure it like the things that we are able to test don't seem to help us at all, you know.
[38:59.910 --> 39:05.910]  And so then this is kind of like what I was thinking is kind of our closing statement.
[39:05.910 --> 39:08.910]  And then we'll just open it up and answer some questions in the chat and stuff.
[39:08.910 --> 39:16.910]  But like there also exists at least an equal and statistically likely to be greater number of characteristics or qualities that cannot yet be tested for.
[39:17.910 --> 39:31.910]  And I personally think a part of this specifically when we're talking about cannabis has to do with like the cultural history that it has in specific locations in communities tied to the people who are growing in and cultivating it.
[39:31.910 --> 39:39.910]  And I really I don't know how we would even go about testing it.
[39:39.910 --> 39:42.910]  Right. I mean, what are we even testing for?
[39:42.910 --> 39:55.910]  It's the heart and soul of the, you know, like what you were talking about with like how what you were talking about, how the strains the strains evolve there.
[39:55.910 --> 40:01.910]  And then the people are with the plants and we're with each other.
[40:01.910 --> 40:04.910]  And I think that part of healing is so undervalued.
[40:05.910 --> 40:27.910]  And when it comes to cannabis, there's part of that that people fear other people will fear is that unknown that comes with the community, because that same community that I was just talking about, like that same community, the same exact community that has been growing the plant and healing and been part of this community,
[40:28.910 --> 40:41.910]  that very same community is discriminated against on a regular basis for being cannabis users, for being socially vulnerable, usually like usually in in more than one way.
[40:41.910 --> 40:51.910]  And I think that when it comes to this bill in Hawaii, like so if you don't live in Hawaii, like, can I help or is there any like.
[40:52.910 --> 41:00.910]  Yes. So actually, you can when this bill comes out so anyone can testify nationwide.
[41:00.910 --> 41:08.910]  And so when we get a hearing for this bill, we've been doing a lot of like job forms, like single click testifying.
[41:09.910 --> 41:17.910]  So we're going to be putting it out as soon as it gets a hearing, because this is just the only bill that's left.
[41:17.910 --> 41:24.910]  Like we have been like systematically, you know, like one pops up, we we kill it.
[41:25.910 --> 41:32.910]  So we've been able to like kill or amend a majority of the of the bad bills here.
[41:32.910 --> 41:38.910]  But this is the one that they basically put every all of the bad things into.
[41:38.910 --> 41:44.910]  So, number one, it limits it limits collectives to 20 carts per site.
[41:44.910 --> 41:47.910]  And just as a reminder, right now, it's currently unlimited.
[41:48.910 --> 41:51.910]  So that would have to people.
[41:51.910 --> 41:58.910]  Right. So it would go to instead of so it'd be 20 people.
[41:58.910 --> 42:03.910]  So altogether, you have 200 plans as a collective site.
[42:03.910 --> 42:06.910]  But right now, it's currently it's unlimited.
[42:08.910 --> 42:18.910]  That's one. It it spells out who can process and manufacture and distribute products, which is huge.
[42:19.910 --> 42:30.910]  Because basically, it's, again, re criminalizing the this this community that that exists outside of the dispensaries.
[42:30.910 --> 42:38.910]  And then the third part that is really, really bad is that they're asking for a study.
[42:38.910 --> 42:47.910]  So any site that has more than five cards, they want it to be reported to the legislature.
[42:47.910 --> 42:58.910]  And so the governor and then also report how how they went and like educated them or told it's basically it's an enforcement bill.
[42:58.910 --> 43:04.910]  It's an enforcement bill that is hiding behind this.
[43:04.910 --> 43:07.910]  You know, they always make it sound good.
[43:07.910 --> 43:13.910]  But what what it truly is, is that is a way to to kill the collective.
[43:13.910 --> 43:16.910]  So the dispensaries have no competition.
[43:16.910 --> 43:25.910]  So when legalization comes out, they're going to have the exclusivity that they are wanting here.
[43:25.910 --> 43:31.910]  And in what could be seen as, you know, one of the most valuable markets worldwide.
[43:31.910 --> 43:36.910]  Right. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of connotation there with Hawaii and cannabis for sure.
[43:37.910 --> 43:52.910]  And so, you know, what we are asking for is that our our legacy growers, the people that have been doing this for years, that they are able to do direct farm to patient sales.
[43:52.910 --> 43:57.910]  Right. OK. Yeah. So so Maine has that model.
[43:57.910 --> 43:59.910]  Canada has that model.
[44:00.910 --> 44:18.910]  So that's that's really what what we're asking for is for all of these amazing legacy growers here to be able to, you know, like share their cannabis legally with the world and to exist alongside the dispensaries.
[44:18.910 --> 44:21.910]  We're not saying that the dispensary shouldn't exist.
[44:21.910 --> 44:23.910]  They absolutely should exist.
[44:23.910 --> 44:26.910]  Yeah. I feel like it's just like a little bit of healthy competition.
[44:26.910 --> 44:35.910]  It is, you know, as you keep the quality high, because honestly, like competition does make quality in general.
[44:35.910 --> 44:39.910]  It will push prices down. Right. And make the quality better.
[44:39.910 --> 44:45.910]  So I don't see why, you know, anyone should be opposed to such a thing.
[44:46.910 --> 45:04.910]  But I would be happy to write a letter or whenever, like, yeah, whenever it makes whenever it makes sense, because I think that it's important to raise awareness that these are things that are happening in places where, like, we have a history with cannabis and that we shouldn't just let it go away.
[45:05.910 --> 45:15.910]  Because if we think about it as just, oh, it's one collective, it's this collective having a problem and then it goes under and then it's this collective that has a problem and then it goes under, et cetera, et cetera.
[45:15.910 --> 45:23.910]  Like, if we do think about it just that way, then it's a it will just slowly fade into nothingness and cease to exist.
[45:23.910 --> 45:25.910]  And that's currently happening with a bunch of languages.
[45:25.910 --> 45:30.910]  It's happening all over the place and in a bunch of different sectors and regions.
[45:31.910 --> 45:38.910]  But I am specifically when we talk about cannabis and we talk about cannabis as a medicine, we're losing so much more than we think we are.
[45:38.910 --> 45:44.910]  And, you know, the same thing is happening all over the world where, you know, we're losing this knowledge base.
[45:44.910 --> 45:48.910]  It's passing away and no one's either learning it or. Right.
[45:49.910 --> 45:56.910]  And I think that so I think it's definitely worth remembering and, you know, worth saving.
[45:56.910 --> 46:00.910]  But anyways, I don't know if we want to take questions.
[46:00.910 --> 46:02.910]  I feel like the chat has been going off.
[46:02.910 --> 46:03.910]  It's been going off.
[46:04.910 --> 46:06.910]  I know I haven't been able to really to be able to really.
[46:06.910 --> 46:09.910]  I know I've been like so enthralled.
[46:09.910 --> 46:12.910]  I haven't even like been paying attention.
[46:13.910 --> 46:15.910]  Good vibes, everyone.
[46:15.910 --> 46:16.910]  Oh, my mom's here.
[46:16.910 --> 46:17.910]  Sup, mom?
[46:18.910 --> 46:19.910]  Yay.
[46:19.910 --> 46:20.910]  Hi, Mama.
[46:22.910 --> 46:26.910]  Jack says Jack Bats as I had no idea cannabis was so culturally important in Hawaii.
[46:26.910 --> 46:30.910]  I mean, it's been it's been there for just such a long time.
[46:30.910 --> 46:36.910]  And there's I mean, one of the first times that I ever smoked was in Hawaii.
[46:36.910 --> 46:40.910]  Like, yeah, I mean, definitely also cannabis culture is evolving.
[46:40.910 --> 46:44.910]  Like I I think that that's something that it's not.
[46:45.910 --> 46:50.910]  I don't think that there's any point in trying to stop an evolution of something that's definitely going to happen.
[46:50.910 --> 46:54.910]  Right. I mean, and I think accessibility is always good.
[46:54.910 --> 46:57.910]  I was literally I was saying this like it's such a weird place to be.
[46:57.910 --> 47:02.910]  I feel like I do think that increasing accessibility is pretty much always going to be a good thing.
[47:02.910 --> 47:06.910]  Like I do think that increasing accessibility is pretty much always good.
[47:07.910 --> 47:15.910]  It's pretty much always a good thing because cannabis can help so many people and is good for so many different reasons.
[47:15.910 --> 47:17.910]  But I mean, like pain, sleep and anxiety.
[47:18.910 --> 47:22.910]  And yeah, I I'm not sure.
[47:23.910 --> 47:30.910]  I think where I'm torn at in terms of like the culture and protecting like different aspects of the medicine is that
[47:30.910 --> 47:37.910]  like what you said about the plants just looking different, like we don't actually have like very much preservation of that, though.
[47:38.910 --> 47:47.910]  And let's say this is just like let's say as a personal example, let's say that I wanted to experience Maui Waui,
[47:47.910 --> 47:58.910]  because I wanted to see if that more ancient strain and that more primitive like combination of cannabinoids and terpenes and flower structure
[47:59.910 --> 48:01.910]  that I think that it would be.
[48:01.910 --> 48:03.910]  I mean, I probably would think it was swag.
[48:03.910 --> 48:04.910]  I'm sure.
[48:04.910 --> 48:06.910]  Yeah, no, for real.
[48:06.910 --> 48:13.910]  And that's also going back to, you know, like THC being such the focus.
[48:13.910 --> 48:17.910]  And we've lost so many amazing land strains to that.
[48:17.910 --> 48:18.910]  Right. Yeah.
[48:18.910 --> 48:21.910]  To like increasing THC.
[48:21.910 --> 48:26.910]  And, you know, that's what has happened to cannabis in general culturally.
[48:26.910 --> 48:28.910]  Right. Because you're going to get busted for it.
[48:28.910 --> 48:31.910]  You're going to be breeding for highest THC.
[48:32.910 --> 48:36.910]  Yeah. And oh, that's that's an interesting one.
[48:36.910 --> 48:48.910]  All right. So Peter says, let's see, Peter says that maybe we should talk to chat about like what like who's getting these licenses and like the.
[48:50.910 --> 48:53.910]  I guess I'm not aware, actually, of it.
[48:53.910 --> 48:58.910]  Do you have any MSO like multi-state operator like restrictions or is it like.
[48:59.910 --> 49:04.910]  So Hawaii is very interesting because it's vertical and we only have eight licensees.
[49:04.910 --> 49:09.910]  Right. So statewide, there's only eight dispensaries.
[49:09.910 --> 49:18.910]  And of those eight dispensaries, they can have three three retail and and, you know, manufacturing and production.
[49:19.910 --> 49:37.910]  So the people who who got them have when it comes to MSO, the only one that's super obvious is that Noah Botanicals has they grow some of the cookies strength.
[49:37.910 --> 49:45.910]  Right. So so we know that cookies already like obviously exist out here.
[49:46.910 --> 49:51.910]  Right. Mm hmm. OK, like I guess.
[49:52.910 --> 49:59.910]  I guess like some of the arguments that I am seeing that I think that are worth bringing up is the argument that.
[50:00.910 --> 50:14.910]  That everyone should be free to do whatever and that it's not necessarily like any one person that should have maybe say like a step up or any sort of like regulation over whether or not a culture is preserved.
[50:14.910 --> 50:19.910]  But that's actually what has been happening and is being done in other ways.
[50:20.910 --> 50:23.910]  There is a culture being preserved here. It is a different culture.
[50:23.910 --> 50:26.910]  This is what we're watching is one taking over the other.
[50:26.910 --> 50:41.910]  And so I do think that what we're like when people who say something like that, what they inherently think is that it doesn't exist and that or not that it doesn't exist, but that they are existing simultaneously together and that they don't affect one another.
[50:41.910 --> 50:44.910]  But it's not true. That's just not how it works.
[50:44.910 --> 50:46.910]  One culture will overtake the other.
[50:46.910 --> 50:49.910]  And I think that we're watching an evolution and that's OK.
[50:50.910 --> 50:52.910]  And both of us are for it.
[50:52.910 --> 50:54.910]  Both of us are for that increased accessibility.
[50:54.910 --> 51:09.910]  But I do want to address that the reason why it's important to actively and yes through regulation actually support and not necessarily not even going as far as the social equity component like let's not even go there.
[51:09.910 --> 51:16.910]  Let's just say that the legislation should not actively discriminate against one group versus the other group.
[51:17.910 --> 51:33.910]  And already it's made complicated by all the barriers to entry and all the barriers of privilege of like even being able to have a cannabis company and be able to go through this endeavor because it's not an easy or a small task.
[51:33.910 --> 51:42.910]  And I think that clearly it's a really somewhat contentious topic.
[51:43.910 --> 51:44.910]  Yes.
[51:44.910 --> 51:45.910]  Absolutely.
[51:47.910 --> 52:08.910]  Like, I think that it's good that it's at least evoking emotion, like in terms of, well, being able to take up space and be like, yeah, I don't think what's going on there is right.
[52:08.910 --> 52:23.910]  And I don't think that like we should just stand by idly and not do anything because it's also that Hawaii is only one of many other states that will come online and that this same thing will be happening.
[52:23.910 --> 52:38.910]  And all the states are doing it differently, which is a whole nother thing that I've only like recently been more paying attention to because again, I was just like blissfully and completely unaware and or not like not really interested in participating.
[52:38.910 --> 52:55.910]  But, you know, I feel like I would regret it as a scientist not participating in something when I know that there are like, I'm just going to make the analogy one more time about the whole buying your tomatoes from Market Basket or Costco, you know, Costco actually has decent vegetables.
[52:55.910 --> 53:00.910]  But like, you know, there's a difference in quality of mass production and it's always there.
[53:00.910 --> 53:02.910]  It's like it's why people like craft beer.
[53:02.910 --> 53:06.910]  It's why the wine industry exists the way that it does as well.
[53:07.910 --> 53:13.910]  It's why there are different levels of food like fast food versus like five star restaurants, etc.
[53:13.910 --> 53:24.910]  And it's because the molecules that we like about all of these things, all of those molecules that we enjoy, that it matters how that thing is grown and cared for, etc.
[53:25.910 --> 53:39.910]  You know, and I think I'm glad you brought up wine because that's really kind of the goal is, you know, like when you go to like Napa when you you know, it's like a specific region for wine, right?
[53:39.910 --> 53:47.910]  And that could really be huge here to where, you know, you go to the winery, but it was it's on the farm, right?
[53:47.910 --> 53:50.910]  The winery is typically where they grow the grapes.
[53:50.910 --> 53:52.910]  So it'd be that same concept.
[53:53.910 --> 53:57.910]  It would be where the cannabis is grown and it's like the direct sales.
[53:57.910 --> 54:02.910]  You know, you can go pet goats, you can go look at the farm itself, whatever.
[54:02.910 --> 54:20.910]  But that's like really the model that we would like to see here in order to take the legacy that already exists and give them the opportunity to also participate in this market in a meaningful and legal way.
[54:21.910 --> 54:27.910]  Right. And I think that like, yeah, I think it's difficult.
[54:27.910 --> 54:37.910]  I mean, even here we're having problems with we're just having issues with what is and isn't the best way, because it also has to make sense.
[54:37.910 --> 54:39.910]  It takes a lot of time.
[54:39.910 --> 54:41.910]  It's a huge amount of effort.
[54:42.910 --> 54:50.910]  And that all of that energy. So for like for people who are not aware of like the laws of thermodynamics, like energy is neither created or destroyed.
[54:50.910 --> 54:58.910]  Energy is transferred and we're all in the process of constantly transferring our energy.
[54:58.910 --> 55:10.910]  Right. Like and that I definitely believe that it absolutely makes a difference where you transfer your energy and in what place, especially with medicine, that that ends up being from.
[55:10.910 --> 55:17.910]  And that's that doesn't mean that the other things shouldn't exist, which is also what you were saying before.
[55:17.910 --> 55:24.910]  Like, I think that it's definitely yeah, I think that it's definitely something that I would hope to see change.
[55:24.910 --> 55:29.910]  And you can't you can't just let Hawaii's like land race strains go away.
[55:29.910 --> 55:34.910]  Like I know that like you're saying Maui, Waui would be swag, but like I don't know.
[55:34.910 --> 55:35.910]  It's Maui, Waui.
[55:35.910 --> 55:39.910]  People would think it was swag. I wouldn't think it was swag, but they would look at it and be like what?
[55:39.910 --> 55:43.910]  I know, I know. But it's it's like it can't go away.
[55:43.910 --> 55:47.910]  Yeah, I mean, I I feel like I've heard that about the terroirs anyways already.
[55:47.910 --> 55:52.910]  Right. Like the emerald, the emerald triangle versus like terroir, right?
[55:52.910 --> 55:56.910]  Terroir. I can never say that word. That's why I didn't say it earlier.
[55:56.910 --> 56:03.910]  That's why I just said region because I'm like, uh, it's a hard one.
[56:03.910 --> 56:10.910]  But I saw a question that's really important that I really want to answer from Jesse Thompson.
[56:10.910 --> 56:15.910]  So he's saying, what did Operation Green Harvest do to Hawaiians?
[56:15.910 --> 56:19.910]  So this is super, super important.
[56:19.910 --> 56:26.910]  So Operation Green Harvest, it was started on Hawaii Island.
[56:26.910 --> 56:30.910]  So Moku Keawe, also known as the Big Island.
[56:30.910 --> 56:34.910]  But, you know, Hawaii Island, it was started there.
[56:34.910 --> 56:38.910]  And this is when we became a high intensity drug area. Right.
[56:38.910 --> 56:46.910]  So we got this designation and then they would just do flyovers,
[56:46.910 --> 56:50.910]  seed the plant because when it was illegal, pull it and take it away.
[56:50.910 --> 56:58.910]  So Operation Green Harvest was really gnarly, but it was nothing like so Operation.
[56:58.910 --> 57:03.910]  Oh, gosh, I cannot believe that I forgot the name of it. I'll think of it.
[57:03.910 --> 57:09.910]  So it was the next one that came. So this was when we saw almost a complete eradication.
[57:09.910 --> 57:14.910]  This was in the 90s. And so what they did, it was military style.
[57:14.910 --> 57:23.910]  So they would use like satellite imaging in the 90s to find these cannabis farms in remote areas.
[57:23.910 --> 57:28.910]  And they retrofitted Black Hawk helicopters.
[57:28.910 --> 57:34.910]  And instead of the guns, you know, like the guns that they have on the side of the helicopters,
[57:34.910 --> 57:40.910]  they retrofitted them and filled them with glyphosate. So they would go down, they would fly low.
[57:40.910 --> 57:46.910]  They would spray the entire crop with glyphosate. Then they would come in and harvest.
[57:46.910 --> 57:55.910]  When I talk about this, what these people that experienced this, what would happen?
[57:55.910 --> 58:02.910]  People's animals were dying. People would be getting sick because you're having literally glyphosate
[58:02.910 --> 58:09.910]  from a helicopter sprayed on you. And with that, with this operation,
[58:09.910 --> 58:17.910]  they eradicated almost 90 percent of Hawaii's outdoor grows within a couple of years.
[58:17.910 --> 58:28.910]  And it was probably one of the most devastating things that that happened to Hawaii in cannabis so far yet.
[58:28.910 --> 58:35.910]  And then that's also when we saw this huge explosion of crystal methamphetamines,
[58:35.910 --> 58:43.910]  which I believe is connected because, you know, cannabis was no longer fully accessible.
[58:43.910 --> 58:53.910]  And also people who had been using it financially maybe no longer had that as an option.
[58:53.910 --> 59:00.910]  So, yeah. So thank you, Jessie. So we still have Operation Green Harvest. It still is active.
[59:00.910 --> 59:05.910]  They are still harassing medical patients out here.
[59:05.910 --> 59:11.910]  And, you know, they're still doing raids on medical patients in Hawaii.
[59:11.910 --> 59:17.910]  That's so fricking awful. I cannot. That whole thing about the spraying of the poison,
[59:17.910 --> 59:27.910]  like all over just is awful because there's no way that that goes anywhere except for into the people that who are living there.
[59:27.910 --> 59:36.910]  You know, and I think. Yeah, I think that that's I like want to like know more about it now.
[59:36.910 --> 59:41.910]  I didn't know that until this conversation that you've had the most serious like.
[59:41.910 --> 59:45.910]  But, you know, in some ways you're in you're so far away from everything.
[59:45.910 --> 59:55.910]  Like, you know, it's a very like isolated experience. But anyways, this has been so awesome.
[59:55.910 --> 01:00:00.910]  And I want to just make sure that we let people know like when you are.
[01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:04.910]  So when you do have a way for us to reach out, what is the best way if people are in Hawaii?
[01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:08.910]  Like, what can they do? So just give like a rundown of all of that.
[01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:18.910]  So so I would say you can follow us at Malia Cannabis Clinic and then also at Careway Lua.
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:23.910]  So Careway Lua is our largest collective here.
[01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:29.910]  And, you know, a lot of this legislation we feel has been just specifically to target them.
[01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:42.910]  So they're also really good. Fresh Farms Hawaii and Hawaii Grow Guru. Everyone knows you're high.
[01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:48.910]  So these are just some like Instagram handles that that I can send you a list.
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:55.910]  But I think if you Malia Cannabis Clinic, we always keep things really updated legislatively.
[01:00:55.910 --> 01:01:03.910]  And we always have links for single click testimony because that's really what we need is.
[01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:10.910]  It's like an overwhelming voice of opposition. And that's what we've been able to get locally.
[01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:16.910]  But if we can also get support nationally and internationally, that would be amazing.
[01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:26.910]  Yeah, I'm so down and I would like to, you know, I'm trying to advocate for some changes to be made here where I live, too.
[01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:35.910]  It's it's a tough and slow road. I mean, and when it comes to the actual like quality, I mean, what really gets me that.
[01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:43.910]  And I'm not super familiar with Hawaii, but I'm familiar with what the areas that I'm in is that, you know, there's a striking difference.
[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.910]  There can be a striking difference in quality, right?
[01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:50.910]  Like there there can be just a giant.
[01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.910]  And it's not the things necessarily that, you know, we're measuring.
[01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:59.910]  But yeah, so that is where you can find me. And thanks for joining everyone.
[01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:03.910]  So I'm thinking that these are also just like little announcement.
[01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:10.910]  Like I think towards the end of every month, I will be doing like a science related chat, science and cannabis.
[01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:14.910]  And I would love to know if anyone has anyone that they want to see on here.
[01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.910]  But I've been like, I'm so grateful to have had you on here.
[01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:22.910]  I'm so excited that we finally connected about this.
[01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:26.910]  And I'm actually we're going to be seeing each other in person this year.
[01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.910]  So that's cool. I know. I'm so excited. I can't wait.
[01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:36.910]  All right. Well, I hope everyone has a great night and we will see you all like in a month or so.
[01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.910]  All right. Bye. Bye.
