Hello everybody welcome to another day let's go join Jason Giddey and the show
they're just getting everything set up right now so I'm super excited to be
there I hope you're very excited to be there
we will all be there together momentarily hopefully you're well audio
is fine everybody's loading in let's see if my clubhouse decides to open right
now
up there go we are in everyone
all right all right all right all right how we doing it looks like London is
enabling the show getting things rolling here on the tube waiting for our good
friend Nick to join us go ahead and get my show notes up for this evening get
some prep tonight as we usually try to do and even with the prep I still have
trouble keeping up with I've got some I made some of this crazy powerful honey
for Christmas like I took like five pounds of decarbonate put it into like a
couple kgs of honey and and a two six of two six of crown royale and I put it all
together and reduced it that and cooked it down to like one full jar and like
gave it gave it to a bunch of friends crazy powerful it's not it's but it's
absolutely delicious it's actually get get got coat kind of almost like that
rye flavor carried through to the end even there's no alcohol at this point
I got a little bit of that sweetness going on there so I'm excited to hear
this conversation about sugar today very nice very nice yeah we're gonna get into
all sorts of stuff and there's a really interesting article I definitely post to
the chat that we're gonna get into in the second half I think the first half
we're gonna definitely focus on sugars and there is Nick welcome welcome welcome
so how you doing tonight Nick we just talked a little while ago so I hope
your evening is going as well as it was earlier yeah definitely I'm just
settling in here and getting ready definitely looking forward to tonight's
conversation and it's good to see so many people here already yeah yeah we
got a good crowd going in there already so yeah let's go ahead and get rolling
here welcome welcome welcome welcome to hoot to herbs grow and tell this is our
weekly cannabis cultivation club we are here every Thursday night 6 p.m. Pacific
9 p.m. Eastern and we are recorded and simulcast on YouTube on the future
cannabis project FCP o2 channel looks like we got Guerrero go grows getting
the crowd going on YouTube checking to see what people are smoking on tonight
we got Gibby grown in the house with Emma deus and donkey connington magnum
opus King dolo we got a lot of royalty on the line tonight kid rough indigo
dogo and of course what about Bob is here so we're ready to go and we got the
dacta in the room our man from the future in Alta Roa New Zealand growing
hemp on the other side of the planet we got Richie we got Jeff we got Matt the
mad scientist and Mikhail and Tim and Steven and Logan and James and we're
ready to rock tonight is episode 20 and we are gonna talk sugar very very sweet
subject to get into I am excited I am pumped I had extra sugar before or the
podcast tonight to make sure that I would be ready and roaring to go
hopefully I don't sugar crash about halfway through so as an intro we do
have a couple of different things covered tonight about sugar we're gonna
do our normal basic introduction into sugar and what sugar is and then we're
gonna jump into different types of sugar different ways that you can get where
you can get sugar different types of plants and things and then we're gonna
get into the biomechanics of what's going on with sugar and some really
really cool stuff that I had no idea was going on with sugar so awesome awesome
stuff so sugar is the generic name for sweet tasting soluble carbohydrates and
we're gonna talk a lot about carbohydrates tonight many of which are
used in food simple sugars are also called monosaccharides including glucose
fructose and galactose compound sugars also called disaccharides or double
sugars are molecules made of two monosaccharides joined to a glycidic
bond common examples are sucrose glucose plus fructose which is what sucrose is
lactose which is glucose plus galactose we have maltose which is a two molecules
of glucose and of course then you've got things like table sugar granulated sugar
regular sugar and those usually refer regular sugar they usually refer to
sucrose which is a disaccharide compound of glucose and fructose and I we're
definitely going to talk about that tonight as well in the body compound
sugars are hydrolyzed into simple sugars sugars are found in the tissues of most
plants honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of simple sugars and
we're you know that's where folks that are familiar with Korean natural farming
are very familiar with using fruit to produce to you to grab those sugars for
producing that FFJ to use during the enhanced ripening phase of cultivation
sucrose is generous especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet
making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined
sugar in 2016 the combined world production of those two crops was about
two billion with a B tons two billion tons of sugar beets and sugar cane
maltose may be produced by malting grains lactose is the only sugar that
cannot be extracted from plants it can only be found in milk lactic acid
bacteria lactobacillus including human breast milk and in some dairy products a
cheap source of sugar is corn syrup industrial produced by converting corn
starch into sugars such as maltose fructose and glucose all right so you
know sugars everybody's familiar with sugar you know sugar is a big source of
debate in the in the health of humans you know sugar is something that is
really really prolific really really everywhere it is used in so many so many
different things within our diets and it's it's actually something that's hard
to get away from it's also something that they use when they take other
things out so when they take fat out they put sugar in and salt in and other
things to try to compensate for the flavor that's being removed when they
dump certain things and I also you know sugars themselves are there's a lot of
people who try to avoid some of the problems with sugar by using fake
sugars and the reality is that most of those are pretty much they react pretty
much the same way in your body so you're not really escaping much when you go and
you try to use replace fake sugars with real sugars because your body's still
producing those same things and turning those into the same compounds in your
so that is the intro for tonight Nick you want to jump in here if before you
before you do Nick I don't want to throw you guys off here but if you like you
didn't mention labs I'm actually setting up to do like to separate out the curds
and whey right now if you want I can do that in the background on the video
shoot if you if you guys would be okay with that or interested I don't see a
problem with that hopefully folks won't find that too distracting it's a
relatively fun process that's you know I and we can take that little side tangent
for a second there we talked about this I think last night or the night before I
can't remember we've been chatting so often lately but labs is is that gateway
natural farming technique that is really really fun and is really dramatic and
easy to see when you got it and that's one of the things I love about labs and
then of course it's so simple to use and of course it's so good for your plants
and your own body so labs is a fantastic thing to make and if you want to go
ahead and do your lab separation in the background go ahead
Nick sir all right yeah so this is gonna be an interesting conversation tonight
about sugars and the thing that I would like people by the end of the
conversation to to have kind of in their minds is that sugars or what people
think of as sugars can actually refer to a really complex set of responses that
are possible to achieve out of the plants and I think oftentimes there's a
one-dimensional analysis of sugars in a sense that most people think if you put
sugars in a soil that it's gonna you know those sugars will feed the soil
microbes and then those soil microbes will in turn you know feed the plants
and then you know while that may be true I think it's worth pointing out too that
there's a lot more complex activity happening depending on the types of
sugars that you use you can sort of elicit different responses in plants and
so you know hopefully today we'll kind of go through some of these different
types of responses you know that you can elicit from the plants using different
types of sugars and and really how this whole thing gets interfaced in the
plants and how they can perceive some of these signals that are associated with
pathogens like microbes and fungi for example or you know herbivores aphids
things like that or just mechanical damage as well if there's something that
happens the plants have to be able to perceive that and then subsequently
dedicate a portion of you know the sugar pool that those plants have because the
sugars themselves are the things that get broken down to form the defensive
response so there's gonna be the sort of transition and crossover between sugars
as signaling molecules and sugars as like functional substrates you know they
are the building blocks but they're also the thing that's more or less helping
regulate or I should say participating in the complex network of regulation but
nevertheless participating in what is ultimately going to metabolize the
sugars and so yeah with that being said I'm definitely looking forward to
getting into that tonight I think we're gonna start off talking a little bit
about you know basic sugars and you know what's sort of the difference between
white sugar brown sugar cane syrup maple syrup corn syrup all these various
coconut syrup you know coconut nectar all that good stuff so yeah with that
being said I'll pass the microphone back to you Jason yeah and we did you
know I did mention that in the in the in the startup there that you know cane
sugar and beet sugar are extremely we we grow a shitload of it for sugar we
definitely do two billion tons of it and and yeah no we're getting we're
definitely gonna get into it so there's there's all sorts of different types of
sugars often in the natural farming community we talk about the different
types of sugars you use because sugars are very common it's a very common tool
it's one of the main things that we use in the process of a lot of the ferments
it's used for making FAA which is fish amino acids it's used for making FPJs
and FFJs fermented plant juice and fermented fruit juice and so it's it's a
common tool for us and in general gardeners have been using different
types of sugars primarily molasses in their grows and in their gardens for a
very long time it's you know you find references to it in the farmers almanac
you find references to it in lots of online recipes and things like that
sugars are definitely a very big part and you know most of us when you go to
the store you're familiar with white sugar and brown sugar you'll see natural
cane sugar then you get some other grades of sugar like damara and some of
these other types of pure cane sugars and less processed sugars but one of the
things that I like to talk about for folks that are not familiar with how
sugars are made is is brown sugar because brown sugar is interesting in
the fact that they basically it's not brown to start out that they basically
take white sugar and they apply molasses to that white sugar to make light brown
sugar and then they apply more molasses to make dark brown sugar and so they're
actually combining a couple of different types of things to make that
colored brown or dark flavored sugar that most people are familiar with from
baking. We talked about you mentioned a couple of them we were trying to come up
with all the different a bunch of different places that you could get
sugars from and sugar cane as you mentioned we've got beets sugar beets
stevia which is a plant right corn syrup maple syrup coconut sugar coconut syrup
I think you said sorghum agave looks like we lost London for a second there
oh he's off making the labs I see him pouring his serum into the strainer
right now agave and kelp sugars also I didn't really think about kelp sugars
and artichoke sugars the sugars in artichokes also really really
interesting do you want to get into a little bit of the process of evaporated
cane juice and why it is that color yeah yeah and it's kind of you know similar
to what you had mentioned earlier about the molasses you know there are certain
plants and we had talked about this briefly during our conversation on c3 c4
and cam plants think about c4 plants like turbocharged c3 plants even some of
these species like corn and sugar cane they're growing outdoors naturally where
it's around 400 to 450 ppm of co2 but the special thing about c4 plants is
they have this like mechanism that amplifies or maximizes the amount of co2
that rubisco is exposed to and so they functionally get you know somewhere
around five to ten times more co2 than other plants and so this makes them grow
very very fast relative to other plants there are some sacrifices and there's
some you know specific things that like as far as temperature and you know all
that fancy stuff goes on a on an enzymatic level there's some
considerations for c4 plants which is why you find them closer
towards the equatorial regions where you have a higher intensity of sunlight but
you know the point with c4 plants ultimately is that they do this carbon
fixation thing so well that you can quite literally take a cane stalk as
it's growing you know if it's at the right time you can harvest it and juice
it and you get a bunch of this stuff this phloem sap basically that's rich
in sugar and it's just a testament to how efficient some of these plants are
at photosynthesizing and making sugars and then moving those sugars around
within the plant and so you know definitely over the past 15 or 20 years
there's been a branch of biology that's more or less started to become explored
called glycobiology and it's just basically you know a good way to think
about glycobiology is that it's the study of the structure biosynthesis and
the sort of functions and applications of these sugars and how they came to be
how they're used in systems for redox purposes for example which we'll get
into a little bit or for signaling purposes because a lot of them as it
turns out do function above and beyond just simply being carbon substrates that
the plant can use for growth those would be like more of the simple carbohydrates
simple sugars like the mono and diacerate that you had mentioned Jason
and then once you start getting the longer polymers of sugars you start
getting polysaccharides and oligosaccharides and depending on the
specific types of those sugars you may have modifications to some that
transform them and so you have a very vast and extensive way to characterize
and sort of group and name some of these sugars that are being produced by plants
but it has been sort of shown overall that there are some of these classes of
sugars that seem to have like regulatory functions in terms of plant biology you
know they're produced for reasons that are above and beyond just them having
carbon skeletons they can function like phytohormones to a certain extent and I
think a good example of that and maybe I'll pass the mic back to you after this
question to you Jason but a good example of a polysaccharide that I'm talking
about that has this kind of function is one that I think everyone's familiar
with which is chitin and some of the derivatives the chitosan for example you
know if you've ever applied chitosan which is technically a carbohydrate
you'll see that does have a profound response right Jason here again apology
about that yeah no absolutely I think it was it is really interesting that that
came up as well in the in the prep I had I had really thought about it being
present in chitosan and in chitin in general it's interesting and that
article that I was reading more into and trying to absorb that I'll post up in
the chat here in a minute but it's it's it's interesting all of the different
compounds that are produced in all the different shapes that those saccharides
can connect with just fun looking at the general structures of all of these
different aminos I had some fun just kind of looking through the big chart
that came up on Wikipedia on all of these different chains and how they how
they connect and glutamate glutamate came up a couple of times and
interestingly enough can we were talking about glutamate last week so that was
also very cool to see that in there yeah you know just like terpene biosynthesis
is fairly like if you really think about it where it starts is fairly simple and
straightforward it's a five carbon building block that basically undergoes
the same repetitive sequence of combinations then you've got some
enzymes that kind of come in on the back end to you know continue to fine-tune
and tailor and modify and maybe add some functional groups into the mix too but
the point is ultimately that you have this pathway that gives rise to in
terpenes in particular this pathway that gives rise to like 70,000 plus known
metabolites that are based on again sort of repetitive motions just over and over
and over again you know you have five carbon linked together it makes a ten
carbon and that ten carbon is a monoterpene if you take another five to
that ten you get 15 that's a sesquiterpene you take two tens put them
together or find another way to make 20 there's your diterpenes and as you
continue to build up to 40 that's your carotenoids for example pigments and
plants and as you continue to build onward and upward from there you get
things like natural rubber for example and polymers gums you know in particular
so it's very interesting that in terms of glycobiology and like you're talking
about there's all these like really fascinating structures and all the
architecture it's easy to get lost in the potentially hundreds of thousands of
different types of sugars that there are but it's also I think important to
understand like on the back end of all of these vast and complex structures
there's somewhat simple logic to it as well you know all of them start from
monosaccharides for example and then those have like you mentioned
glycosidic bonds and these are sort of the things that hold them together and
they can get kind of linked together sometimes in certain cases you'll find
insoluble compounds that plants produce like pigments are a good example you
know anthocyanins are a really good example of pigments that the phenolic
of those compounds is technically insoluble in water but also for anyone
that's ever you know grown a plant that's turned out purple and then washed
hash out of it you'll see the hash water itself turns purple so you might think
to yourself well how is this true you know and the answer there is that
glycosides are a major constituent as far as what plants use in order to
enhance the solubility of things that they make which are otherwise not
soluble the lack of solubility presents a problem because if the plant needs to
move an antioxidant around or pigment around for instance it's gonna struggle
to do that so it makes sense why some of these conjugations might allow plants to
like better transport some of these metabolites that they constantly build
and break down and repurpose and so on and so forth so stevia is actually a
really good example the extract of stevia leaves is a really good example
of what I'm talking about because it's technically a diatropine alcohol and
for those of you who are sitting in front of a computer type in stevia all
its steviol type that into Wikipedia and then if you click it look on the right
hand side you'll see towards the bottom underneath properties you'll see a molar
mass which is like it says it's about 318.457 and if you open up another tab
type in THC Wikipedia you know let's see if it has the molar mass on here it
does 314.469 versus 318 so okay they weigh pretty dang close to each other
steviol just like at the cannabinols tetrahydrocannabinol is a diatropine
they both have 20 well THC has 21 carbons in it but steviol has 20 so you
know point ultimately here is that these are compounds that are
structurally similar and they come from similar pathways and the interesting
about the interesting thing about stevia plants is for those of you who ever had
the loose leaf you know you can just take some of the leaf throw it in water
and you know boiling water and walk away for a couple minutes that sugar gets
released that steviol compound gets released because the plants come along
and they fuse these sugars molecularly fuse them to these diatropine
compounds that are otherwise insoluble thereby making them soluble in water
and that's how you can pull steviol out of the leaves even though technically
that compound itself is not soluble hopefully that makes sense what do you
think Jason that makes sense to you absolutely absolutely and you know
another thing and you know back to chitin right it's the second most
ubiquitous natural polysaccharide after cellulose so it's everywhere and but
yeah no I appreciate that it's it's it's just it was like I said I got stuck
reading through the article which was talking about all the signaling and but
I ended up diving down the rabbit hole on the structures and how some of these
things all all like branched together so that was very cool so one of the things
that you know also that you mentioned was the chemical and industrial process
of making sugar did you want to get into that a bit you know more or less it was
specifically just in reference to how the you know just how sugar is sort of
decolorized through this process of removing the natural molasses content but
you know from there it was we wanted to kind of talk about like okay if you're
just using sugar as a supplement for your soils you know can you get away
with simple sugars or should you use something that's perhaps more of a
complex sugar and I'm always of the opinion that you should use complex
sugars wherever possible they just seem to have more sort of dimensions to what
it is they're capable of achieving as opposed to something like you know
simple sugars but that being said if you're using granulated white sugar
versus you know granulated brown sugar or evaporated cane juice I don't think
the you know the lack of molasses is gonna make that big of a difference
overall so it's just it's gonna come down to whether or not you like to you
know what kind of agriculture you like to support I suppose at the end of the
day yeah and you know another there's two other areas that you that you
mentioned you know artichokes I don't really think of artichokes as having
sugars in them but I guess now that I think about it they are in some ways
kind of sweet when you're eating that the meat off of the artichokes not
necessarily the pickled artichoke or fermented artichokes which is a lot of
the time what I'm eating where the you know they're set in oil or whatever they
are but when you do eat you know a fresh steamed artichoke that the meat of the
artichoke is kind of sweet so there's a lot of sugar in artichoke in the head
you were saying in the flower tops right yeah if you harvest the artichoke at the
right time you know while it's still kind of fairly young and immature and
it's supposed to be soft you know otherwise after a while starts to get
really hard of those fibers are difficult to break down even if you cook
them for long periods of time but the point about that is that that particular
type of sugar is a fructo oligosaccharide and it's just basically
that class of sugars these fructo oligosaccharides are produced by plants
like artichoke as sort of sinks for carbon so that there's available energy
to the plant at all times if it needs to form a defensive response I can pull
from these fructo oligosaccharides and because they are such a dense energy
source overall they can provide a lot of the substrate like physically provide a
lot of the substrate that the plants need but also on the flip side there's
something very unusual about their three-dimensional structure in general
that people are still trying to figure out and the best way that I can phrase
it is if you look at the like the I think the type of sugar that in the
pharmaceutical industry it's referenced as inulin and a lot of people might be
familiar with inulin it's a prebiotic fiber that if you take it it helps your
gut microbiome and so if you're having digestive issues it can help stimulate
the growth of healthy microbes that help you take care of those digestive issues
so that that whole thing has been very well explored in humans and certainly
the mechanics behind specifically why have also been explored but as
researchers were noticing that these prebiotic sugars have all these amazing
health benefits for your gut microbiome they also noticed that there was
something unusual about the three-dimensional architecture of the
sugar in that it functioned much like a very effective drug delivery mechanism
because it has these you know typically these fructooligosaccharides have like
multiple functional groups that are dotted along their fairly long skeletons
and these functional groups allow for these structural changes to occur where
the sugar itself can pull something that's otherwise not soluble in water
and it can kind of hold on to it or maybe there's an enzyme that acts on
that sugar to make it fold around this thing and all of a sudden whatever you
wanted to grab is soluble and watering can be taken up and further metabolized
downstream so that's just one of the examples of how it's not you know sugars
complex sugars to be specific like oligosaccharides in general they're sort
of like secret sauce lies more or less and what they actually look like in
terms of their three-dimensional architecture and this is where the
beauty of all of this really complex stuff comes out because at the end of
the day ultimately plants are just sugar factories that's what they do they take
energy from the light and they take water up from the soil and they try to
meet the two in the middle and make sugars and oxygen can get out of the
equation and the plants are happy with that so in this process of creating
sugars I think again it's been oversimplified quite extensively that
sugars are just like this energy source the plants use it to access carbon and
it's a building block and so on and so forth but in reality there's it's a very
vast and complex topic that's given rise to an entire branch of biology now
there's a glycome in this study of glycobiology and it's you know just
looking at the organized pattern and expression of some of these sugars and
how they may be linked to circadian rhythms and plants for example you know
because of those plants are photosynthesizing during the day they're
producing these sugars and at nighttime there's a drastic reduction in that
actual sugar production cycle and so in a lot of ways the sugar status of the
plant can inform you know plant-wide changes hormonal changes certainly
secondary defense pathways that's one of the things that we're finding in plants
at least is true with some of these besides our artichoke with the
fructooligosaccharides there's a variety of different types of sugars produced by
kelp that kind of can help act on the same pathways but what we're finding
specifically is the use of artichoke during the flowering stage seems to fill
like a multi-pronged approach you know this one plant can provide for sort of
the energy needs of microbiologicals in the soil I mean obviously it's a
complex sugar so microbes go nuts it's like rocket fuel for them but then on
the flip side there's also this really cool feature that's it's like a
three-dimensional chelating molecule that can be used to the pass metabolites
either from you know microbes back to the plant or in certain cases if we
ourselves are trying to trap maybe the energy of you know a phosphate group
inside and kind of like you know chemically bake it into the artichoke
sugars we can we can do that I do want to mention real briefly before I pass
the mic back to you Jason that one of the other cool functions of sugars that
a lot of people oftentimes overlook is that they actually can be used very
efficiently in the process of solubilizing and transporting phosphorus
for plants and I think the best example of that is the fact that co2 is first
taken out of the air and combined with a trigger phosphate that's step number one
that being said back to you Jason right thank you very much I think this is
actually a perfect time to go ahead and reset the room and they're going nuts on
the YouTube chat tonight absolutely singing sugar songs talking about Mary
Poppins we've got nothing but a bunch of sugar junkies running around Guerrero
grows is quoting full sets of lyrics on sugar it's fantastic we had a quick
question from chef Jay Reese Hota can you ask Nick if he has heard of sukanat
please s-u-c-a-n-a-t yeah it is a type of cane sugar and my understanding is
part of it it could come down to like a specific cultivar that they use or it's
just a degree of processing or dehydration that allows it to retain
more of its molasses content but my understanding is like even the
turbinado cane sugar in the Denver our cane sugar that you had mentioned
earlier Jason those are yep those are still cane sugar plants and so part of
it is gonna come down to again how maybe it's processed and if there's a specific
cultivar but I am unfortunately not a sugar junkie if you ask me that about
team and I could tell you anything about that but all right fantastic all right
so again this is Hota Herbs grow and tell welcome welcome welcome everybody
to the grow and tell this is our weekly cultivation club we are here every
Thursday night at 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern recorded in simulcast on YouTube
on the FCPO2 channel if you haven't already you're in the room you're
listening in you'd like what you hear please make sure you join the club join
the future cannabis club by clicking on that little greenhouse and jumping into
the club and make sure you follow the speakers and the other folks in the room
with you if you're on YouTube make sure you subscribe to both the future
cannabis project and the FCPO2 channel so that you catch all of the shows that
are on there including the shows that London hosts when he's not draining and
straining his labs for a live studio audience it was it was good to see good
to see you doing that work in the background London and I think that was
so hard that was so challenging yes do that on camera man absolutely
absolutely makes you think about what we were chatting about earlier so we'll
talk more about that in the future but yeah it is very challenging to do those
things and get the camera going by yourself you have to set the camera up
and hope that it's going to capture all the things that you're trying to show
people on what you do with your hands so always very interesting but back we're
here tonight talking about sugar this is episode 20 do you believe it's episode
20 already episode 20 and again I said these are recorded they're all posted on
YouTube so you can go back and listen to all the previous episodes as I
mentioned we talked about sulfur and we talked about glutathione last week and
we've had a bunch of episodes on carbon and of course we did a cow mag episode
there's some fermentation and a bunch of other great things and then coming up
next week we're going to talk about the hops late and thyroid Evian is going to
join us and Johnny's going to join us next week and we're going to talk hop
late and thyroid and then the following week I got my friends from science LED
joining us and we're going to talk spectrum and some really really cool
stuff that's going on with blue light just blue light it isn't all about the
red light sometimes even in flower you need the blue light so let's get back
into sugar so another one that you mentioned that I again didn't think
about sugars being there was kelp and it you know it turns out that there is
definitely a set of few cans and carry genes are sulfated polysaccharides as
you were saying right there's a lot of we're talking about sulfur and sulfated
polysaccharides present in brown and red algaes whereas all vins are hetero
polysaccharides found in the green algae yeah and those are species were
definitely familiar with you know we have the red kelps the green kelps and
the brown kelps going into one of our products root anchor and then we also
fold a couple of those individual species of help out into the various
products but you know the point is there's an interesting story to be told
about how kelp is one of those you know plants that's been with humanity for
tens of thousands of years I think some of the oldest records go back about
15,000 years I mean we had a you know a whole episode about it that was pretty
good so I don't want to rehash it too much but just as a quick reminder you
know some of these species of kelp they're producing different compounds
within their cell walls and these compounds are sugars much like starch
in land plants as a sugar there are examples of different types of storage
sugars and species of kelp like laminar and for example it's a particular
molecule that happens to be very useful in terms of it's like an analogous
function you know what land plants use starch for brown species of sugar kelp
like laminaria digitata they use laminarians and then so on and so forth
so you've got a variety of different sugars achieving different things the
one striking feature about sugars produced by sea plants versus land
plants is that land plants typically don't produce sulfated polysaccharides
but as Jason just said you have these derivatives of all these different
colors of kelp the red kelp the brown kelp and the green kelp that all produce
these polysaccharides that are dotted with sulfate groups and it's the
presence of those sulfate groups and the way that they interact with plants and
sort of the biological medium that helps sort of explain and inform their
function and you know to kind of segue a little bit into it for people that may
not be as familiar maybe they some of you haven't watched the episodes on kelp
but you know the extracts of sea plants are sort of like the jet you know the
future of fertilizers to a certain extent partially because sea plants are
so efficient at what they do they grow so fast and they happen to produce these
sugars that do a wonderful variety of things in the soil it's very difficult
to just come out and say well you know see sea plant extracts do this or sea
plant extracts do that part of it is because the mechanism that plants use to
respond is so complex that it's not really possible to determine what exactly
is going on it just seems like hey there's a lot going on and there's a lot
of very vital systems that all of all of them are talking to each other and
they're all kind of figuring out internally these you know internal plant
systems how to mediate a holistic plant response to something like a sea plant
extract and so you know from a research perspective or a science perspective for
almost a hundred years now researchers have been trying to figure out you know
what is it in sea plants that allows them to behave in such a way and part of
it is you know because of this response that plants have it's thought that
there's a lot of phytohormones inside of kelp and while it may be true to some
extent the overall response that you see from land plants being treated with sea
plant extracts the response is so profound that there's not like that
quantity of hormone isn't enough to explain the response it could be that
plus something else and it likely is that plus something else the other
reason that it's really hard to kind of figure out what exactly is going on is
that depending on the mode of extraction you end up with fractions of compounds
that are different when Maxi crop first started producing their product in the
1930s I think it was 1939 or 1940 somewhere around there what they sort of
immediately noticed right off the bat was that alkaline hydrolysis the use of
potassium hydroxide or maybe even sodium hydroxide to treat the species
of kelp broke the sugars down by oxidizing them and it created smaller
sugars that were initially not present in the parent material the smaller
sugars have a high degree of biological activity for some reason land plants
really like those sort of more digested oxidized sugars that a little bit
broken down they seem to respond to it a little more so it seems like for a long
time their researchers were focused on just that but you know definitely the
past 15 or 20 years there's been a lot of different techniques that have been
developed simple mechanical extraction using water pressure there's acid
extraction there's the alkaline which is the most famous one there's microwave
ultrasound enzymes supercritical fluid pressurized liquids etc etc and there's
all kinds of different species now so you know neither needless to say there's
a lot of very interesting things happening at large and all of it is very
complex what I mean by that is you have you know if you're trying to measure a
response after you you know if you elicit a stress on the plant and you
supply the stress response really what you're looking for is like this linear
transfer of a this compound went into the plant and the plant formed a
substantive response and whatever stressor the plant was dealing with was
dealt with and so you know typically when you're looking at antioxidant
systems in particular this type of stuff is more or less it's possible to measure
this type of stuff out but you introduce kelp extracts into the equation and it's
like everything just goes all at once everything all of this positive
activity start to get up really regulated in the plant and there's so
much crosstalk happening that it's really difficult to figure out why
exactly plants that are exposed to these kelp sugars for instance why they
start to act in the salicylic and jasmonic pathways to produce secondary
metabolites they also produce compounds that help keep internal water levels up
so you see it like a change in the amino acid status of the plant it's sort of
adjusting to make sure it can stay hydrated more or less in the presence of
salt stress for example which kelp extracts obviously very very good for
alleviating salt stress and things like that we had their complex responses
I'm gonna pass the mic back to you real quick Jason and then we'll kind of keep
going from there awesome awesome I I will say just to make sure that folks
following along in the YouTube video that the future cannabis project in no
way condones the use of Eagle 20 as a product or a band name and I don't I
don't know this polysaccharide person that they keep trying to call to the
stage but she sounds like she's probably a troublemaker and we don't want her
around so sorry to fall in with with that with the gaggle of guys going on
the on the YouTube feed tonight loyalty and donkey connington Gibby and Chad and
Abraham and shredder and Greg and extra moist Ian Craig Gatlin chef Reese and
the whole crew I really appreciate you guys having fun tonight and keeping
things lively on the YouTube feed so oh you know we've talked about artichokes
we talked about algae I mean kelp and we've talked about stevia did you want
to get into a little bit more about them being elicit errs do we want to go
into a little bit more about aloe vera maybe yeah and maybe aloe vera can be a
nice little bridge because it's also to some extent an elicitor it's just it's
one of those things where sea plants particular brown seaweed species like
ascophyllum nodosum or rock weed is the common name there's just so many
publications and so much research available about those types of sugars
and how exactly they function and like I mentioned earlier it's really easy to
get sort of lost and looking at you know the specific enzymes that may get
upregulated or you know the metabolic you know responses that happen afterwards
I think the important thing to remember is that there's a very complex systemic
response even though the final concentration like by the time you
dilute this kelp product whatever you may purchase and use by the time you
dilute it and add it to your plants most of those functional molecules they're
present in very trace amounts in some cases maybe even the parts per billion
or the parts per definitely in the parts per million but perhaps even in the
parts per billion so it doesn't take much to elicit these systemic responses
and you know depending on the type of species that you're working with you can
also custom tailor your manufacturing processes to get a particular type of
nutrient profile out of the kelp and the best example of this is a product called
kelp pack that is made with species of kelp called the glonia maxima or sea
bamboo and it's one of the few if not the only oxen dominant species of kelp
and so they got smart with it and said hey it's oxen dominant so you know you
can use this as a foliar spray and it makes the plants basically shoot up
vertically whereas most kelp on the market the brown seaweeds like rock
weeds those are typically cytokine and dominant and so you see a cytokine and
dominant profile come out versus an oxen dominant profile so this this type of
stuff as you know we continue to learn about how to work with these species of
kelp we're realizing like hey this kelp will make the plant grow vertical you
know basically six feet overnight and hey the other one over there will make
it grow six feet sideways overnight and then there's other species of kelp like
the the green kelp for example those olvins the sulfated polysaccharides do a
really good job of eliciting stress response pathways and plants like really
quick bursts and they don't have like super lingering effects they don't you
know take a week to make the plants fully adjust like it happens real quick
and then the plants just kind of keep moving on with their normal metabolic
cycles so there are very subtle things that are kind of profound and create
shortcuts in conventional agriculture which is specifically why you know
people like ourselves you know fertilizer manufacturers are looking to
exploit some of these natural resources they are basically an endless supply in
the oceans obviously we're learning how to cultivate them properly and you know
with respect to natural cycles we're paying attention to all that stuff and
hopefully in the next five to ten years you know you're gonna start to see more
and more of a kelp based not only bio stimulant industry but also like bio
fertilizers in general I hope so especially watching the news about that
that nitrogen fertilizer fire in North Carolina that's been going on for like a
week now it's not you put all that ammonium nitrate in one place and you
get a spark you got a problem yeah yeah and so if you use certain sea
plants like maybe single-celled algae could be a better like actual protein
source for nitrogen but you know still with the nitrogen thing like nitrogen
use efficiency the sugars that are present inside of kelp do increase
nitrogen use efficiency directly inside of plants and you know the nice thing
about some of these kelp sugars is that they really help regulate the level of
balance between the cells like inside the cell should always maintain a
certain level of hydration and if the outside of the cell starts to get really
really dry the plant starts to try to you know it starts to struggle basically
to maintain that level of balance and as it turns out application of sea plants
during times of drought due to these sugars again helps regulate the overall
ability of the cells to maintain hydrated during really really stressful
times where water levels are really low for example income these sugars and
they're magical you know they help do these things in sea plants and then
obviously it makes sense why some of those benefits would extend to land
plants if you know you could sort of digest them enough and introduce them to
plants and and get them to basically treat them in the same way such that you
can improve tolerances to drought like we just talked about water logging
salinity even extreme temperatures where you may have evaporation of the
water you know occurring on the inside of the leaf surface because light
intensity is so high you have these classes of compounds called osmolites in
osmo protectants inside of sea plants that are like functional sunscreens and
they absorb all of that extra radiation energy and they sort of cool that water
off passively they allow that heat to dissipate through you know their
molecular bonds as opposed to having the water evaporated so there's all
kinds of cool stuff and you know there's one type of sugar may end up doing 10 15
20 different things which gives rise to why it's like so complex and people have
been studying one species basically that's been extracted more or less one
way for so long you know yeah absolutely very cool very cool yeah I mean I've
even I've seen all sorts of really cool stuff on how those plants have affected
our history and and we talked about it a lot on the kelp episode as well right we
got into that and went off on that tangent and you know I think a lot of
these things are really super super interesting I mean we you know I
mentioned earlier that you know sugars are a really really big part of
the natural farming Korean natural farming approaches we use sugars for
FFJs and for FPJs and for making for making FAA you know and that's that's an
amazing process where you're utilizing sugars to just ferment and break down
these materials and you know the sugars are in some cases almost like bursting
the walls of the the plant material and sucking all the goodness out of them so
it's really really cool and and you get these just wonderful products for your
plants and fermented plant juices is you know taking a usually a good bio
accumulator of a plant and then fermenting it with sugar for seven to
ten days straining off the liquid and then using that you know putting that
plant material into your compost or something else from a FPJ standpoint
and those that FPJ is I like to make mine with aloe I actually like to make
an aloe FPJ and actually do an aloe fermented aloe so I instead of just
making the FPJ in a typical aerobic fashion with a breathing lid I actually
go the other route and add some lactic acid bacteria some lab and put that
puppy with a closed lid for 30 days and ferment it and that's what I usually use
on my plants instead of a traditional FPJ and I love just the feel of that
material the fact that there's also that lactic acid bacteria in there for that
little bit of a additional boost but yeah just pulling all of the natural
aloe vera goodness out with those other sugars and then feeding that to the
plants they really enjoy it yeah and you know aloe vera just like kelp does a
really good job of holding on to water in environments that are typically very
unforgiving and if plants can't figure out good mechanisms to you know prevent
you know dehydration during really like excess light intensity you know days
where it's really hot outside where it's really bright or on the flip side you
know the weeks and months that go by and there's access to very very little water
while at the same time this plant has to kind of figure out how to do its normal
thing from day to night so that being said some of these plants like aloe vera
certainly have developed good strategies in the form of the sugars that they
produce and these sugars in the case of aloe vera function again with you know
in an analogous way to the kelp sugars such that they hold on to water very
very efficiently and this is one of those properties that you know seems to
get translated a little bit over to cannabis plants at least from as far as
what we've seen although it does seem like the specific types of sugars also
depend like their response depends on when you apply it you know during the
early stages of vegetative growth a good aloe vera extract is definitely going to
improve and increase your rooting it's going to make the plants a little bit
more vigorous when you start transplanting them and it's going to
make them a little bit more resilient to the shocks and the stressors and all the
sort of daily bumps that happen you know between those early stages part of this
benefit I will say also comes from you know the introduction of these sugars
either as a foliar spray or in the rhizosphere does actually stimulate the
production of beneficial microbes which come in and you know they end up
producing more or less specific metabolites you know using those sugars
and they pass those on to plants it is interesting to mention real quick I want
to say that there are there was a you know there's been examples of plants
that have been genetically modified to produce you know one type of sugar
versus another type of sugar with the purpose or the intent of studying how
those types of sugars naturally condition and select for microbes to be
present in the rhizosphere and the big question overall is like hey does this
type of sugar versus that type of sugar really affect you know the microbial
population the answer is yes it does but it doesn't affect what is outside the
normal scope as far as like what that plant would you know which microbes it
may associate with it just kind of changes the ratios and so you get this
profile of microbes that starts to get conditioned as a result of using certain
types of sugars now having said that we have a young cannabis plant we're using
aloe sugars on it and those aloe sugars as they coat the root hairs part of
their direct exposure to the root hairs in the plant is going to stimulate a
response in the plant and that the stimulation of this response will you
know be like the SAR or the ISR type of elicitor effect it's like the the vitamin
C in the the willow bark kind of thing it stimulates the immune system and it
provides you know the sugars the plant needs to respond to that stimuli but
then on the flip side to remember that the microbes are also actively breaking
some of these sugar compounds down and as they break it down and pass that back
to the you know the plants the roots all of a sudden have very explosive growth
so of course if you're using aloe on young plants you notice like hey the
roots are growing really fast well yeah you're turbocharging a lot of really
good healthy beneficial microbiology biology down there you know and then on
the flip side too if you're in flowering stage obviously you're not going to get
explosive and profound root growth you may get some photo protective benefits
though like we were just talking about with kelp you may find that some of
those sugars from the aloe can function like a fuel source that burns for a long
time in the cannabis plants as they take it up in the transpiration stream and
they start to metabolize it it's a more or less a complex sugar that you know
they can burn for a longer period of time and the third thing too is as a
foliar spray let's not forget there's just like the rhizosphere is rich in
microbes and beneficial fungi there's also a thing called the phyllosphere and
it exists on the leaf surface which is also home to a lot of microbes that
plants interact with and it has been you know demonstrated or shown more or less
that these sugars produced throughout photosynthesis do get exchanged with
microbes in the phyllosphere as well as microbes in the rhizosphere so yeah I
just add that little twist in the wormhole
awesome awesome yeah yeah and then you know I think also just to mention while
we're still in this little spot here before we go ahead and do our reset
because we hit the hour mark is that FFJ is fermented fruit juice which would be
the sweeter side of that equation right tends to be made traditionally for K&F
at least fermented fruit juice is made from three different fruits also
combined with equal weights of sugar and then fermented for seven to ten days and
then strained off and instead of necessarily composting your leftovers in
this case you can actually take that leftover fruit and add water and make
your own vinegar and it's a really really nice fruity vinegar you can make
use for salad dressings and for some other things London you know got to
throw in a quick recipe for London if we can while we're at it but save that FFJ
especially if you do something you know I do I try to do seasonal things and you
know collect things in my yard when I can right we get a lot of wild berries
grow here dogwood tree cherries are actually quite delicious so you can
actually make some ferments there's tons of apple orchards around here so I can
go to my local organic orchard and go pick some apples right off the tree and
and get those right into a ferment so using three different types of fruit and
mixing it with sugar that FFJ though is that fermented fruit juice is primarily
for the enhanced ripening phase of your flowering or fruiting and that's whether
you know regardless of the type of plant you're growing that is for that enhanced
ripening phase so you really are you're applying that FFJ those last two or
three weeks of flower and that's when you're boosting the sugar levels I know
a lot of growers who throw bricks and sugars at plants in the flowering stage
to help build weight additional molasses and things like that as well
yeah and that's one of the things actually I wanted to talk about just as
a piece of practical advice for people so give me one minute here Jason I need
to have a quick safety meeting and then I'm gonna come back and we'll give the
audience absolutely let me go ahead and light I'll relight the room and then
we'll go ahead and launch there and then we'll jump into that second side of the
topic so we're here it is Thursday night it is Hota Herbs Grow and Tell and
we're here in our weekly cultivation club meeting we meet here every Thursday
night on Clubhouse 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern this at these episodes are
always recorded in simulcast on YouTube on the future cannabis project please if
you have not already subscribed please subscribe to the future cannabis project
and the FCPO channel FCPO to channel both this way you won't miss all of the
great stuff that's going on there we have just got a fantastic bunch of hosts
some of them are online causing chaos right now like Chad and and some of the
other folks around that are also part of the family here at the future cannabis
project I also I did turn off hand raising in the room until we get through
the rest of the agenda for this evening so in another about half an hour 45
minutes will allow people to come up and ask questions we are still taking
questions on YouTube so if somebody wants to post something in the chat we
can try to get it into the conversation especially if it's part of what we're
chatting about if not we'll save it till afterwards or send us a message on
the back channel here in Clubhouse and we'll try to get it in there so let's
jump back in are you ready Nick are you still having your safety meeting sir
yeah yeah I'm just doing a little bit of QA work here on some wedding cake
fantastic I I've been enjoying some 92 burst tonight and it's a it's a it's a
cross that a friend of mine Kush forest hooked me up with that was a
collaboration between him and main grower and it is this old 1992 real G
real deal OG San Francisco OG I think let me see if I can find the actual
lineage on that on that burst but it was it was a fun plant to grow I grew it a
while back I'm kind of cleaning out some of the older cannabis that's in my
curator now trying to clear that out make sure that I keep you know that
first in first out type of approach going we don't want things to get too
old although it's amazing that curator does keep things pretty good but the
1992 bait only clone a Bay Area clone only real deal OG Kush from Kush forest
crossed with the purple star burst OG from main grower and that was something
I grew in 2020 so it actually was getting towards that really passing its
expiration date but it's still it still has some decent flavor and it's got me
chatty tonight so I can't complain there my buddy Kush forest I got a hook up
with him again he is an amazing grower here in Massachusetts definitely he's
he's one of the people that I would pay and buy weed from just because his
cannabis is so good although usually that's not the problem he just tends to
gift me some when I do see him just fantastically talented grower and
snowboarder by the way so yeah yeah let's go ahead and jump back into it now
that you are properly prepared to go down that chute
yeah and the point that I wanted to make for people was you know like
realistically practically you're gonna get benefits from applying sugars or you
know participating in that sort of sugar application process regardless of if you
brew compost teas you know using artichoke and stevia or if you just go
to Costco and buy a bag of sugar and and use a tablespoon to scoop it out either
way any time that you apply those sugars you're gonna get some benefits however
realistically you know the the flowers in the mid to late stages of bloom they
function solely to produce sugars on behalf of trichome heads because there's
a lot of enzymes inside of the trichome heads that are you know creating a
demand or a draw for those sugars when they take those sugars and they break
them down there's a couple of different pathways these sugars get oxidized and
broken down and as a result of these breakdown pathways the building blocks
for terpenes and for cannabinoids and for phenolic compounds start to get
generated and that's where you have all of this activity happening with the
actual cannabinoid and terpene synthase enzymes the ones that are making all of
the wizard juice and magic sauce are acting on broken down furs that are
being supplied into trichome heads from the flowers obviously through the stocks
so if you understand this system it's a good idea to supplement sugars as these
flowers get big because you're gonna notice again simple sugars or more
complex you're gonna notice that your plants do pack on a little bit of weight
there's a very mechanical reason for that as we just kind of went through so
yeah that was my realistic practical piece of advice my little freebie for
the day the rest of what I'm gonna tell you guys is gonna be complex and you'll
definitely have to work harder for it so write it down remember it yeah yeah
you know it's funny because I was in we had I was I was chatting with Doc Ray a
few months ago and I got into a conversation with him and I got him to
like start dumping out some of his some of his old-school secrets and a lot of
it was really dumping in those sugars and those like a lot of it was dumping
in a lot of that extra sugar in the end there to help with getting some just
fattening up with those buds and and and helping the plant out at that stage so
really really really really good old-school stuff there so we've talked
about different types of sugars we've talked about different types of plants
that produce sugars we've talked a bit about the functions of sugar in plants
and we've talked a little bit of the functions of sugars and biomes did you
want to talk about how it affects fungal species hmm yeah this is a very
interesting topic and I've kind of brought this up in a variety of
different ways in the past but you know it's kind of no secret that microbes and
fungi in the soil depend on the amount of carbon they can draw down in bulk
amounts through photosynthetic activity when plants successfully do this crazy
complex thing called photosynthesis they chemically reduce carbon make sugars
those sugars get loaded up in the phloem tissue and then at nighttime when the
stomata close there's a little bit of a downward pressure gradient that's
generated and the leaves can tumble you know sugars and move them out to the
roots and during this process there's this exchange that happens where it's a
very complex system not fully understood quite yet but there's a sort of a
complex interchange between the photosynthetic you know the byproducts
of photosynthesis those photosynthetes with certain things the plant needs as
far as limiting factors go so you may find that the plant itself is capable of
through whatever metabolites and exudates it produces and secretes out of
the roots it's capable of more or less conditioning the soil for its
microbiological needs in other words if the if the plant needs some phosphorus
you're likely to see a specific type of sugar that happens to attract a microbe
or species of fungus that can help with the problem the phosphorus problem on
the flip side legumes are a really good example legumes form relationships with
nitrogen fixing microbes called rhizobia this is very old ancient relationship
and it's fairly special overall but one thing you got to look at is the types of
organic acids and the types of compounds that are produced by legumes happen to
plug pretty dang well into the pathways that the rhizobia have and it just so
happens that the rhizobia have pathways to plug the nitrogen in the form of
amino acids into the carbon skeletons that the plants produce and funnel those
amino acids back to the plant so it doesn't have to divert about 25% of its
total energy flow to to do that you know it can trust the microbe to do that and
focus on reducing carbon in exchange so when you're looking at just like the
thermodynamic equilibriums it makes sense why there's specific relationships
that have formed with nitrogen fixing microbes and plants because the
reduction of carbon and the reduction of nitrogen is really complex and it
requires a lot a lot a lot of energy so much energy in fact that it costs less
for the plant to form relationships that withstand the test of time and last for
you know tens of millions if not a hundred or so million years these are
you know very strong systems overall is what I'm trying to get at so in certain
contexts when phosphorus needs are low in the soil the plants can produce
certain compounds to attract our muscular mycorrhizal fungi and then on
the flip side too as these fungi form relationships with plants they get the
plant to pass specific flavors of sugars down that happen to allow these fungi to
make fatty acids and cell walls for example because the way that they grow
and the hyphae and that you know the way that the hyphae forms networks through
the soil it's under a different set of sort of biological needs you know they
need very little mineral fertilizer overall fungi just need a lot of carbon
they're really really carbon hungry they're always trying to find something
to decompose or in the case of plants when they pass the phosphorus onto the
plants what they're doing specifically is passing that phosphorus in a form
that allows the plants to move through the sugar production process a little
bit more quickly because it's broken up let's say into three stages this process
of producing sugars and plants and one of those stages may move a little bit
more slowly than the other two and fungi through their complex relationships that
they form with the plants are able to perceive this and they say hey let me
plug something into that to reduce the time that you need to turn the whole
cycle over so the plant all the sudden can if it runs 10% to 20% more efficient
well it can produce 10 or 20% more sugars and guess what's gonna eat all of
those sugars that fungus that's why it formed the relationship to begin with
so yeah these are very complex mechanisms that are still being further
elucidated and further understood yeah so it's it's not something that is like
hey we have the answers figured out and it exists in this paper on the flipside
people are still trying to figure out exactly what's going on and how the
stuff even happens and just just witnessing the exchange of metabolites
itself is something that's actually only very recently been possible
probably in the past you know 10 to 15 years you have researchers taking this
type of stuff more seriously so it's definitely fresh and groundbreaking for
sure very cool it's very cool and so you know we did talk a bit about
supplementation of sugars and when to feed the plants did you want to mention
anything else about the effects on the bacterial communities yes similar to the
fungal networks and the ability of some of these compounds to regulate diverse
interactions you know the sugars that are more complex sugars like that ones
we're using to make our peak bloom the artichoke and the aloe you know inside
of lush green and so on and so forth these complex sugars seem to actually
modulate relationships between various microorganisms that like the best way
that I can describe it is it's very rare if you look at nature at some of these
plants that grow let's say I'm looking at an artichoke plant or an actual aloe
plant that's growing if I'm profiling the microbes that exist on its roots
what I find is there's a certain level of a diversity there that's you know
more or less maintained as you know partially as a result of the metabolites
they're being produced the sugars and the fructooligosaccharides and all that
stuff so when you apply these types of complex sugars what happens is you
inherently due to their complexity automatically increase the the the
species diversity it's not even the species count I'm just talking about the
species diversity you can have more or less the same levels but instead of
having a you know limited number of species maybe only three or four you
start to open that up and maybe get five six seven eight that start to create a
balanced ecosystem within themselves because again this is something that you
find out there in the natural world and having you know less refined forms of
sugar in our case the artichoke does provide for this like multitude of
benefits that we're seeing there are specific benefits for the plants and we
recognize that you know besides besides plants and agriculture these
fructooligosaccharides of this inulin compound it's very well studied in
humans and on the pharmaceutical side of things too so for us to kind of start
to piece together like hey this translates pretty dang well actually
it's it kind of makes sense too because when we apply the artichoke
fructooligosaccharides into the soil with cannabis plants we notice that the
beneficial microbial and fungal activity goes up kind of along the same lines as
we notice that's what happens when you apply it to humans and again there's
vast and extensive amounts of literature that prove this to be true
and it's kind of funny that there's you know beneficial microbes inside of your
stomach that more or less come from the soils around and you know hopefully
there's this nice balanced reflection going on so yeah it's kind of in a weird
way it's like it makes perfect sense that it works like this but it's also
kind of crazy that it does you know yeah absolutely absolutely so you know
somebody brought it up on the chat and I think it's really good before we start
jumping into the stuff on that article about you know how sugar is a signaling
compound and drives a bunch of you know responses for the plant the question is
around molasses being unsulfured or sulfured and what the comment on here is
you know for so long and I've heard the same thing everybody has said to use
unsulfured molasses right sulfur not don't use sulfur molasses but there are
now some studies that are showing sulfur is enhancing terpene so should we be
using molasses with sulfur in it or is it really just a case where that sulfur
molasses is not good for the plants because the way that it's produced you
know I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with the production
method I think that you know again I'm not an expert on sulfur versus unsulfured
molasses but my understanding is if you're using you know sugar cane that's
unripe much like you would pick a banana that's unripe and expose it to ethylene
you can process this unripe sugar cane with sulfur dioxide and that helps bring
out this you know brown color and make it look more or less like regular
molasses once it's been sulfur and so I don't think that inherently necessarily
is bad for plants I don't think you're likely to produce anything that's like
gonna be toxic if anything in you know if your plants are deficient in sulfur
then it would definitely help correct that but that being said it also kind of
depends on like at the end of the day you know what kind of agriculture do you
want to support I know a lot of people that are trying to make their own
compost teas and things like that are more willing to support the right way of
doing it quote-unquote as opposed to trying to rush things and use chemicals
to you know enhance or ripen or you know accelerate a certain process or
something like that so with that being said absolutely yeah yeah yeah no I and
I'm glad that they brought it up on on the chat and I agree you know and we
should be looking and I don't care if you're regenerative or organic or
whatever you want to call yourself you should be looking at everything you put
into the plants because the end of the day it's going into you so when you buy
stuff that you don't know where it came from it's hard for you to understand
what's in it and where it's gonna end up in you right plants especially cannabis
plants are tremendous bio accumulators they pull everything out of the ground
it's not just the nutrients right they're pulling everything out of the
ground and so whatever they feed whatever they breathe whatever they
drink it ends up in the plant and so when you're using stuff that was not
necessarily cleanly made so to speak you're going to have to you know you're
going to see the results of that you're gonna get that in you so I agree I think
a lot of especially folks that take time to you know create their own ferments
and their own inputs or do compost teas and things like that in general tent
because that's a long process it's not something you just you know mix up and
throw on your plants you're brewing for 24 hours in many 24 to 36 hours in many
cases yeah you take the time and effort to make sure that everything that's
going into that it's going to be good for the plants and also good for you but
also good for what you're trying to produce you don't it's it's antithetical
to put something in there that might kill bacteria right because you're
trying to grow fungal bodies and bacteria when you make a compost tea
you're trying to produce more of them you're trying to enhance them and get
them excited and if you're putting something in there that's bad for them
like chlorinated water you're gonna be working against yourself in many cases
so you don't want to do that you're trying to go the other direction so I
completely agree I completely agree yeah and in a lot of ways like the sugars you
know particularly those which come out of kelp in certain cases they can be
used to help detoxify plants because again they're sometimes dotted with
these functional groups that can sort of bend and distort and fold around what
would otherwise be a toxic element and the plants can more or less tag that for
export and flush it out of the roots and so some of these sugars that are more
complex they do have the ability to help plants you know function they can
function like antioxidants interestingly enough they can soak up hydroxyl stress
specifically that's what they're pretty dang good at doing and then on the flip
side they can also be used to kind of help chelator complex these elements
that are undesirable so as they you know happen in the soil if you're always you
know watering instead of using plain water for example if you're always
introducing some some ferment you know like we're doing with our line we've got
a complex mixture of about four dozen species of plants and in this entire mix
there's a lot of these compounds that act like little microscopic filters if
you will and they help scrub all these toxic elements in the soil down to a
state of not being available you know they basically reduce the ability of
these elements to become soluble or even interact with the types of chemistries
that normally happen in the soil like generally speaking the types of acid
base reactions you would see or the redox transfer that you would see you
know like just through normal biology you know the these sugars do a really
good job in certain cases of locking up and binding out things that are perhaps
less desirable for the plants so yeah I feel like in a lot of ways you know it's
it's important to make sure that your input is clean obviously there's a
little bit of a scare I think due to kelp having been tested high for arsenic
and lead and cadmium and maybe some other you know less desirable stuff but
you got to take that into context to a lot of the fertilizer manufacturers out
there they may be using technical grade kelp whereas like what we're doing with
kelp is we're only sourcing food grade kelp so you know it comes to us already
below detectable limits and we even can get radioactive isotope profiling done
on it if we want so the standards are pretty high for us meaning we can
concentrate a very large amount of these kelp sugars in with every drop and there
are these like really bizarre changes that happen the structure of the water
itself changes these sort of properties that help condition the soils get
extended over long periods of time too and I just you know I imagine that over
a very long period of time as you continue to feed the plants with healthy
sugars that promote you know diverse microbiology and fungi things like
that in the soil you know ultimately you're creating an ecosystem for the
plants to function at their optimum even if there is some kind of
reactive oxygen species that's generated the plant is loaded up with
antioxidants and if the stress becomes a little too great for it then it can rely
on its friends that are in the soil hanging out and the roots ready to go to
produce some compounds that the plants can't produce you know in response to
let's say a fungal pressure or disease pressure or something like that yeah so
forget where we're going with that but yeah sugars are pretty interesting and
complex yeah yeah no all good all good and I think you know to finish off the
KNF approaches and portion an area right you know the other side of it you know
sugars produce organic acids and organic acids and plants are in the plants that
we're using to break down and we're using those products that we broke down
in those sugars and those organic acids and we're putting those back onto the
plants and feeding them back to the plants that are then in turn creating
more of it as well and and vinegars are also a class of substances that are you
know constantly changing and they're there and all sorts of crazy metabolic
states and vinegars are also there's a lot of sugars in them as well yeah and a
lot of times you know plants will convert organic acids back to sugars or
if they need to turn their sugars into organic acids like we talked about
earlier for the purpose of making terpenes and cannabinoids these pathways
are reversible to some extent you know the plants as they go through their
normal daily cycles if they you know receive a giant metabolic flux that lets
them capture and store a lot of energy you know they're not really gonna be in
the business of breaking down you know as many sugars and into those organic
acids they're gonna on the flip side be trying to stockpile some of their extra
energy reserves in the form of maybe rather than simple sugars like mono and
diacarides maybe they're gonna start producing some of these more complex
sugars like oligosaccharides and it's interesting to point out too with some
of these sugars just like terpenes you know you have a class of compounds that
is very large in its number sugars are also you know you can think about them
like a class of compounds carbohydrates in general that are very large in their
number but you have a great degree of biological specificity associated with
very very small amounts of these sugars just like you know hypothetically out of
all the metabolites that are produced by all plants on earth you know how many of
them are gonna be like the cannabinoids produced by cannabis plants you know
probably not too many and that's also true for some medicinal compounds like
taxol for instance or digitalis derived from foxglove you have these like really
really hyper specific compounds they're ultra rare in nature and they have
profound biological function and this is true there are some sugars that are like
this if you introduce them to cannabis plants they evoke and elicit these
really really profound responses and again I think one of the best and
longest studies examples of that would be with the use of seed plants and the
sugars that are coming out of kelp they just they do so much such a wide variety
of things depending on the species you use and how you process it and how the
sugars end up changing you know across time and so on and so forth I mean it's
remarkable the decades and decades and decades of research can be done about
this this type of stuff awesome awesome alright so it's just about 1030 and I
definitely want to make sure we have time to jump into this and talk about
pamp-mamp and damp because we can't we can't finish this discussion today
without the pamp-mamp and damp conversation so this is Hoater Herbs
Grow and Tell welcome again to Hoater Herbs Grow and Tell thank you all so much for
joining I really appreciate everybody joining us every week looks like we got
a good crowd of folks who jump on and join us and spend their evening with us
every Thursday night starting at 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern either here in
the clubhouse room or on our YouTube feed where these pot where these
sessions are recorded and simulcast future cannabis project on YouTube FCP
o2 channel so the article that we have pinned in the clubhouse room and London
was nice enough to post on the chat in YouTube is all about carbohydrates in
plant immunity and plant protections and the roles and potential applications as
foliar sprays and really this gets into or ties directly into our conversation
because it's it goes it has to do a lot with sugars and how sugars are act in
many ways is signaling compounds and so the things that I mentioned pamp-mamp and
damp are really really cool so there's increasing interest is devoted to
carbohydrates for their role in plant immunity so we've already talked a lot
about all the different things that it does in the plant and how it helps the
biology and fungal bodies and the plant grow itself but it also plays a role in
plant immunity and that's what this is the great stuff that I got to learn this
week was diving into this of course as I mentioned earlier I got a little bit
lost in the architecture of the and the structures of the sugars but some of
them are elicit errs of plant defenses whereas other ones act as signaling
molecules in a manner similar to phyto hormones this review first describes the
main classes of carbohydrates associated to plant immunity and the role and mode
of action precisely more precisely the state of the art about the perception of
pamp-mamp and damp pathogenic microbial and damage associated molecular patterns
so associated molecular patterns who have got those path and agent associated
patterns microbe associated patterns and damage associated micros molecular
patterns and it talks about you know that a particular attention is paid to
the structure and activity and relationships of these compounds the
role of sugars as a signaling molecule especially in plant microbe interactions
is also presented secondly potentially potentialities and limits of foliar
sprays of carbohydrates to stimulate plant immunity for crop protection
against diseases focusing on the roles of the leaf cuticle and the phyllosphere
microflora so really really cool stuff reading into more about how plants
possess immune system and there's all these different ways that they defend
themselves we talk about this a lot when we talk about terpenes in the cannabis
space where terpenes are often talked about as a you know as something that is
a response to stimulus from the outside and whether that stress or a you know an
attack by an insect or heat or lack of water or all these different stressors
and all these different things that cause the plant to react in different
ways again in some cases like you're saying there Jason you know the plants
are able to perceive what exactly is going on in their external environment
you know they've got these fine-tuned sensors that are capable of detecting
things like if an insect bites in across the cell wall for example you know
there's maybe some saliva or a microscopic amount of you know spit or
juice or whatever else comes out and the plants you know have these sensory tools
and these mechanisms in place to sense some of this stuff and there's molecular
patterns that are sort of associated with it you know it's more or less like
the plant picks up a compound and it tries to screen that compound against a
list of active known compounds and it can kind of you know further that
response down whichever appropriate pathway it needs to go from there if
it's a known microbe for example if it's a known fungi you know if it's
something else that's more like a mechanical stressor so on and so forth
you know the the plants have these tools that they can use as a result of first
sensing on a very accurate basis and that's what Jason was you're referring to
with the various types of these molecular patterns you know it's
important to kind of understand that like the the purpose of all this stuff is
when plants produce sugars throughout the day they want to be able to use
those sugars to form the types of responses that they need to be
successful in dealing with daily stressors and you know the occasional
insect that comes along and wants a bite for free so having the ability to
mobilize these sugars and more or less accurately and precisely transform or
maybe break down these sugars into compounds that are really useful in
those defense responses is something that the plants have sort of evolved and
it makes a make sense why they've you know spent a long time figuring out this
degree of specificity you know these things are very subtle cues you know for
example if a microbe secretes a particular enzyme that breaks down a
plant cell wall well that broken down plant cell wall there's going to be some
physical residue left over of that digestive enzyme some kind of you know
functional there's gonna be something physically left behind and the plants
are capable of detecting that and again recognizing what it is and then getting
the appropriate response ready which oftentimes includes the use of burning
up some of the sugar reserves and creating metabolites that can do a
variety of things you know one of the interesting things about the sugar
metabolism too in the case of you know damaged cell walls is that the plants
can repurpose and create you know polysaccharides that are used to fill
the cell walls like pectin you know pectic acid residues I think are some of
the more abundant they're either second or third most abundant the right that
right up there with chitin as far as one of the most abundant polymers in nature
cellulose obviously is the number one most abundant polymer but pectin isn't
that far behind and pectin is just a bunch of these like cross-linked sugars
that exist to kind of add padding to the cell wall and a lot of times you'll find
calcium that's kind of cross-linked calcium is nice and it like it just like
in our bones that offers structures to plants in the cell wall and then so it's
interesting I guess to note that plants can mobilize the use of some types of
sugars to create other types of sugars that they can use in a specific response
you know that that utilize your sugars and originated from sugars that were
damaged so like this whole thing kind of comes back and it's all tied together
and plants have these remarkably sensitive abilities to figure out what
exactly is going on there yeah yeah so this was really again a very interesting
rabbit hole to to jump down thinking about sugars is as a signaling compound
definitely not something that had crossed my mind before and and there's
different types of sugars and different types of reactions that are happening
depending on the types of things that are going on whether it is a pathogenic
or it's a microbial or it's a damage-related signaling and then of
course you add in the really really cool angle of that that not only does the
plant itself have these signaling compounds and then these responses to
those external forces but then it also has the ability to use those mycelial
networks to help share that information with its friends and its neighbors
there's many cases of you know that have been shown where the that you know the
plants are able to communicate trees and forests are able to communicate when
there's predation on one of the trees or you know there's other types of
attacks fire damage and things like that that might be coming where the tree may
will signal its counterparts and in some cases provide energy and water to help
support that next generation to survive during those times sugars are great
give me absolutely sugars are great yeah and just really quickly throw in a
bonus point you know we talked about antioxidant enzyme systems in the past
it was an episode that we did on sulfur and I mentioned you know glutathione has
these file groups that happen to be really really efficient at maintaining
their redox status of a plant and you know the redox status of a plant changes
obviously plants do the crazy task of trying to harvest the energy of the Sun
in the presence of the Sun and oxygen which is a very very dangerous thing to
do because oxygen really likes electrons and in the presence of sunlight which
also really likes to give up free electrons some really dangerous stuff
can happen along these photosynthetic pathways that plants ultimately and
vitally depend on so the potential for these reactive oxygen species to get
generated it goes up as certain things go up like light intensity for example
in the overall productivity of the plant and transpiration rates aka if your
grow is dialed in you're creating a very high potential for oxidative stress and
damage is sort of the nature of the business so you know that being said a
lot of these antioxidant defense mechanisms are very well studied very
well established in plants some of them like the diffusion limited enzymes
superoxide dismutase and catalases two examples they are among the most badass
enzymes in nature they operate so efficiently that researchers are looking
into utilizing quantum mechanics to explain just how efficient it's even
possible because they seem to violate the laws of thermodynamics they also
represent biological perfection and like peak evolutionary fitness so yeah
diffusion limited enzymes as antioxidants are incredible glutathione
obviously participates I don't know if it's diffusion limited but it
participates in the redox status of a cell and so to do sugars as it turns out
because all of these very complex diffusion limited enzymes have all these
super magic powers they end up processing things like singlet oxygen
and super oxides and hydrogen peroxide and various flavors of oxygen that
accepted that electrical energy when it shouldn't have depending on how much it
accepted it gets really really excited or it gets a little excited and then so
depending on the degree of excitation plants have developed very
sophisticated tools some of which you can operate at the speed of light that's
how badass they are but all of that being said it seems like there's no
enzymatic system that plants have developed to deal with hydroxyl free
radicals that can be generated as well it is a reactive oxygen species and
along come sugars which can functionally act like compounds they're
molecules they're not like you know systems like glutathione is a system you
know sugars are just more or less simple molecules if you will but it turns out
that they plants use sugars to mitigate light intensity and so if you're
grossed out and your light intensity is very high and you're pushing your plants
really really high it could be that if you're adding in a pinch of sugar you
know you could be directly contributing to the plants ability to resist
oxidative stress so that part's pretty cool too couple comments coming in here
on the YouTube feed merch grows are there any negative effects of using low
doses of sugars throughout the entire grow in the soil with high microbe and
carbon content and I would say absolutely not sugar is good there should
be there are no negative effects of using it in low doses and in fact in
some cases you may want to up those doses at certain points in time and I
would recommend a mix of different types of sugars yeah yeah and it really
depends on how heavy you're feeding some of the other stuff I mean put it this
way as plants are naturally producing sugars part of what they're doing is
they're creating the potential for carboxylic acid or an aghast carbon
skeletons to get funneled down to produce amino acids and so you know
again they're processing carbon out of the air they're creating these sugars
and at the same time they need to process nitrogen out so if you give them
access to more building blocks to make amino acids by giving you know the
plants more sugars in this organic system you could also in conjunction
maybe bump up the nitrogen levels a little bit you know if you're using like
a fish emulsion or fish hydrolysis that might be a good source of nitrogen or if
you have something else it would be a good idea to kind of attach just a
little bit extra to help balance out that system otherwise you're gonna
create a little bit of a disbalance in the plants overall yep and you know I
think to add on to that you know what about Bob's comment you know sugar added
to the soil makes sense if using it to manage the C and ratio otherwise isn't
the plant isn't it the plants job to put sugar into the soil and and plants do
release sugars in the for you know exudates cookies and cakes as dr. Elaine
likes to call them right it does release sugars but that's the there it's another
type of sugar there's a lot of types of sugars and different types of sugars
have different parts of the reactions anything you want to add on to that Nick
yeah it sounded like the point that he was making was more or less the the
inverse of what I was saying which is like you know pay attention to the
metabolism because plants are always trying to you know figure out it's kind
of baked into there it's hardwired into their photosynthetic process this
balancing act nitrogen and carbon fundamental at the end of the nitrate
reduction process if there's nothing to plug that nitrate or I'm sorry if
there's nothing to plug that ammonium head group into that it's functionally
useless for the plants and you don't want to accumulate a bunch of ammonium
inside of your tissues if you're a plant certainly so you know they have this
inherent task of naturally balancing out the carbon to nitrogen ratio which you
know you should definitely pay attention to but you know if you're adding sugars
again for the purpose of maybe you know because you can you can kind of boost
the the growth of the plants overall you realize like hey this you know this works
the plants are growing a little bit faster again it may not be a bad idea to
add just a pinch more nitrogen and see if the plants like that a little bit
more you know it may be enough and sufficient as it is anyways but it never
really hurts to kind of figure out how else to make the system turn and cycle
through nutrients and a more balanced and rapid way overall awesome awesome
and shredder added we are always told adding sugars made microbes fat and lazy
I don't believe that's the case although you know I do in some ways in some
philosophical way agree I guess shredder is somewhat right there is similar to
the fact that you know plants that are grown in an organic in a living soil
fashion right they develop a relationship with the microbes and
things that are in the soil that you don't necessarily get when you you're
growing in like rock wall right there's a whole bunch of information and
exchange and different things going on there that you just don't get and the
reality is it's the plants don't need to focus on that type of exchange but
they're just you know basically straight mainlining water-soluble
nutrients in through their root system so they don't they don't get all the
fuzzy hairs as much they don't get the same type of growth they don't build
those same relationships with the microbes so I think in some ways when
you are providing all of those substances to the biology it may not
necessarily develop the types of relationships that they would naturally
and in some ways might be a little bit fat and lazy or maybe spending too much
time looking at their phones so yeah you know just to maybe add a counterpoint to
that I don't know if it would quite operate like that as much as it would
you know because if you give these microbes they will ultimately end up
fitting into the roles that have more or less been carved out for them across
evolutionary history and things like sugar enriched water are very rare
occurrences in nature so they tend to temporarily drive transcriptional
factors within the plants and the microbes which change things for as long
as maybe the sugars are there and then once the sugars aren't there things kind
of go back to business as usual so you can make quick turns in the soil if you
will with your microbial community let's say you know for whatever reason you
have one of your buddies take care of your garden and he ends up watering you
know a little bit of peroxide in instead of using the pH down or whatever you
know that the case may be I just like you know something hypothetically that
damages your soil microbiome and you think oh crap well how can I correct
this you know one way to add one way would be to add the beneficial microbes
obviously you start to correct those colonies by adding those colonies back
in and then the other way would be to provide them with a food source to get
them to quickly multiply their numbers but not have you know so much present
that you have to deal with what happens on the back end is you know these
microbes get decomposed because you certainly don't want to encourage
anaerobic activity and you don't want to encourage any pathogenic microbes that
may come in and try to disrupt the natural chemistry that exists between
the healthy microbes and the plants because if you know these populations
spike up real high and then the sugar load isn't available for them those
populations are gonna drop down and you're gonna run into some of that type
of activity yeah I think imbalances in some of those cases tend to take care of
themselves where you'll get that burst of activity and then they'll balance
themselves back off you're not going to destroy your population in most cases
unless you're really screwed up that balance I guess all right so I want to
at this point in time invite anybody who's got questions and wants to come up
to the stage and ask a question or if anybody else on YouTube says that that
has some additional questions that they might want to ask we've got a follow-up
question from shredder but you know we can go ahead and see anybody else in the
room want to come up and say hello or pop in and ask question but so just
going down the list here can plants out compete the microbes for the sugars in
the feed water and I would say the microbes are going to get access to it
first yeah I mean part of it is you know there better be enough water to make
everyone and everything happy but yeah I mean it's a function of volumetric
displacement how fast can the microbes move that sugar-rich water inside of
their cells versus how plant how quickly can the plant take it up and mass you
will find you know properly saturated soils like if you know how to water the
soil properly which can be a skill in an art form I always tell new people that
enter the cannabis industry you know the hardest thing that you will ever learn
to do is how to properly water your plants you know you can put together a
ten million dollar facility you know on a bootstrap budget do it all yourself
and at the end of you you're gonna realize finally like ah now I know what
it means to actually water the plants properly so you know that being said if
you look at how sugars just naturally diffuse in water they tend to follow the
equilibriums that are set up by roots because roots control most of the
hydraulic pressures you know like imagine you had a plant that was growing
in a 20 gallon pot with a massive root system and it was drinking five gallons
of water a day and all of a sudden you harvest the plant well there's no plant
anymore so if you water that soil with five gallons of water like 99% of that
hydraulic conductivity is gone that potential is gone so the plants doing a
majority of the heavy lifting and again if even saturation with good soil
chemistry with all that good stuff you're probably gonna deliver a lot of
triggers to the plants passively but at the same time you're gonna get a lot of
sugars to the proper microbes the proper fungi and in some cases you know there's
gonna be other more complex species that start to join the mix as well and all
kingdoms of life end up being happy as a result
awesome awesome there's a question on here can I put psilocybin fungi in my
organic soil and also get mushrooms or is it not good to have that much fungi
in your soil so I agree with Sonny Chiva that you shouldn't waste them
psilocybin fungi in your grow but I know a lot of people who have mushrooms
growing and it's part of the natural cycle mushrooms are very good fungi are
very good at doing what they do which is helping decompose things and so they do
they are definitely useful in your garden but I don't think you should add
psilocybin mushrooms necessarily I would probably grow those in a separate you
know a separate tray with some cocoa and a nice and do that properly and
separately it's my advice there yeah and you know the needs the environmental
needs for psilocybin mushrooms versus cannabis plants like the optimal
environment to produce high-quality flower versus psilocybin dense mushrooms
is probably entirely different but you know that being said on a serious note
you you would probably want to try to find some species of mushrooms you know
if you have soil that's rich in organic matter and a variety of different things
you want to introduce some decomposers into the mix saprophytic fungi into the
mix those are a little bit different than things like AMF fungi or muscular
mycorrhizal fungi glomus is the most common genus that people are familiar
with but it's sometimes listed as gigaspora as well but yeah that being
said you know it all comes down to this state of balance that has to be achieved
and the whole point again of tonight's lecture initially as I mentioned was I
want to give people an understanding that sugars are not a simple and
straightforward not a one-dimensional thing it's a very complex topic because
you know we have everything from the three-dimensional architecture and
structure of these complex sugars being able to modify and improve how
substances are delivered you know to humans in a pharmaceutical setting or
even nutrients that are passed around between plants and microbes and fungi
doing all kinds of crazy complex stuff to help regulate relationships in the
soil balance out reactive oxygen species that are generated in every cell of the
plant you know function like building blocks and substrates to accumulate
more biomass and produce more terpenes and produce more cannabinoids sugars are
extremely extremely complex they're like the sort of a chameleon of substances if
you will yeah yeah and absolutely it was an awesome topic and I appreciate Peter
too because Peter was the one who actually spurred this one on originally
he's like you guys need to do one on sugars and unfortunately he's not here
tonight he's probably cooking dinner hopefully he'll catch the replay on this
because this one was for you Peter he this was his the topic that he requested
recovered and Nick was giddy with joy to jump in here and and add that and and
who else would know when somebody's being giddy than me Jason Gideon so
anyway we're we're coming to the top of the second hour it is almost 11 o'clock
here on the East Coast and it is getting towards the end so anybody else have any
questions please feel free to come up on stage and ask them we get any more
questions on the YouTube feed please send those out before we wrap up tonight
and I really wanted to say that I appreciate everybody joining us this
week and every week that we do this because this is our weekly cultivation
club where we get together we talk about ways to grow the plant ways to use the
plant sometimes occasionally but really it's it's all about our love of the
plant and just trying to find better ways to care for her and help her
express and sometimes him express their best selves right that's what this is
really all about you know when I originally started the grow and tells
and Worcester it was a monthly club we would all get together and sniff each
other's jars and smoke each other's weed and really just talk about what we did
to grow it you know how we grew it you know where did you get the seeds from
and you know who is the breeder and get into some of that stuff and oh yeah I
grew some of his stuff and especially because we had a lot of Massachusetts
local growers and seeds and things like that and so it was an awesome awesome
experience and you know it this moving it to this platform provides us with the
ability to obviously reach a much larger audience but it's always been about that
it's always been about being a cultivation club and learning about the
plant and and focusing on the plant and and that's you know those are the types
of conversations I wanted to have and that's why I formed that community in
Worcester in Massachusetts and that's why when Peter asked to that we should
start doing you know suggested we start doing this I thought yeah let's do it
let's do it weekly and and you know Nick running into Nick in one of the
rooms and getting him to come in and join me almost every week has just been
awesome so I appreciate Nick and all the awesome knowledge and sugar definitely I
will never look at sugar the same way again never look at sugar the same way
again I hope also everybody else got a lot out of it as well what are your did
you have any additional final thoughts tonight besides what you mentioned
already Nick you know I would say for those of you who again want to just take
away some practical piece of advice just remember that sugars can be used to help
drive all kinds of good stuff that you want to see happen in your plants it's
just a matter of figuring out how that system works at large because it does
work by design and it certainly works in principle in an application too so you
know start using sugars if you're not already using sugars and if you are
using sugars right now then go ahead and start expanding your list of sugars try
to get some aloe try to get some whole artichoke you know if you're making
compost teas out a little bit of artichoke and next time as an ingredient
and see what that does for your soil chemistry and in the more complex
mixture of these organic substances you can get into the fold the better because
I mentioned earlier there are it's rare you know but every once in a while you
stumble across these molecules that are highly conserved in nature but to have
very profound effects and sugars happen to be compounds that are like that if
you just take some crab shells for example and grind them down and add them
into the soil the plant definitely has a powerful response well it's a particular
type of polysaccharide a sugar that's well known and then same thing as I
mentioned with artichokes there's an analogous concept there we have profound
responses so hopefully people like you Jason all are also looking at sugars now
and starting to think to themselves you know what what else is there beyond just
feeding microbes and so on and so forth you know what other kinds of plants
produce whatever what other kinds of special sugars so yeah I hope I hope
everyone enjoyed tonight's conversation I don't know if you're talking or not
Jason but your microphones muted thank you appreciate that so just a quick
question that I invited our good friend the doctor up from up to join us I'm
sure he has something fantastic to say or add but real quickly I wanted to just
mention from the YouTube feed Abraham Espinosa had a question about the
shelf stability of your line and I was gonna say Abraham it's probably best to
just you know shoot them an email or hit root hit the rooted leaf up directly
on Instagram to talk about the questions about the specific pieces of the
different line and the shelf stability of those different products doctor what
do you got going on how you doing how's things looking in the future fairly well
my brother fairly well yes here in Aotearoa New Zealand a small group of
islands off near Australia or those people that don't know where New
Zealand is the native tongue of the local Aboriginal people who are not
called Aboriginals they're called Maori called the land of the long white cloud
Aotearoa and my name Jason is pronounced Jack the Christ that's short for
Christopher and I'm a doctor not a doctor I'm trying to get I do try to I
try to highlight that doctor not doctor or doctor it's definitely got to be the
accent it is it is the accent yes the accent is quite pronounced you're right
I'm not British I am a Kiwi I'm a Kiwi from Aotearoa trying to speak my local
dialect though so yes Aotearoa thank you for specifying this my question was
for Nick whether or whether or not the sea algae or the river algae because we
live near a river it is the mountain that we get our water supply from is
Mount Hikurangi and we have many a boulder and or rock that stumbles down
our river and crumbles to rock dust and algae grows there and it's quite quite
bright green and I was just wondering if we could use that the same way we use
our sea kelp and when we do collect our sea kelp we are trying to we go to the
beach where we can collect the different varietals of sea kelps and the
different colors and thank you for the inputs on the whys and the reasonings
for how and and the interactions and I'll have to pen and paper and currently
out on the tools just had my 420 now five o'clock and as Jason says tomorrow
because I am from the future future future so yes river stream algae or sea
kelp algae differentials and or benefits or non benefits please Nick yeah so you
know single-celled algae like chlorella and spirulina are starting to be studied
more and more for their specific benefits to agriculture and part of what
the specific angle is is that these single-celled algae obviously they're
just single-celled organisms so everything within the cell is like it's
very concentrated in all the proteins all the cofactors all the vitamins
aminos minerals etc etc that is needed to sustain a pretty complex life overall
so it's remarkable in that in that a for you know from that angle and so a lot of
the processes that have been developed around spirulina and chlorella have
looked specifically at breaking their otherwise very tough cell walls without
necessarily damaging some of the interior components so none of the
proteins really get degraded none of the amino acids get broken down and when
that rich soup that was in on the inside of the cell comes out and researchers
start kind of studying it and determining what's going on they again
find unique fractions of sugars that are rare in nature otherwise they happen to
be produced you know more or less by these specific single-celled algae and
they have benefits in the soil they turbocharged soil chemistry in some
pretty profound ways and to kind of highlight one example there's a semi
famous study that was done maybe 10-15 years ago now by educational
institution here in the United States that showed something like a magical you
know five to two kelp to humic ratio and they just kind of made this blanket
assertion that you could take five parts of you know either the kelp or the
humic I forget and then two parts of the other one and you can mix them it would
have this like magic combination and it would you know turbocharge the soil well
that sort of like that general premise is true the specific ratio may be off a
little bit more or less but the point overall is that that effect that they
noticed is actually amplified even greater when you combine humic and
single-celled algae so to answer your question more specifically for your
context I'd probably want to look you know more specifically at that species
of algae and see if you can like determine to run it through a basic you
know send it off to a lab and get it analyzed for heavy metals and toxins and
things like that obviously most of if not all the chlorella and spirulina
that's produced for commercial purposes for food consumption purposes this stuff
is controlled environment and they have QA's like every you know two minutes
three minutes because they need to be careful about dealing with these types
of metabolites they can accumulate whereas out in nature you know if you're
just harvesting this stuff from the river you may not be able to have as
much control over the thing the last thing you want to do is introduce some
some weird stuff into your soil you're just like man I have no idea what's
going on right now okay yes it does thank you for that Nick I will try to
get a analytical test on that room a river slime thank you for your time
yeah and real quick the other thing I'll mention too about the single-celled
algae is that typically the processing methods involved breaking down the cell
wall because it's otherwise a unit you put in the soil it's a little bit
different even some of the microbes and fungi the saprophytic fungi that like to
break stuff down they really solve these digestive enzymes into the soil they too
could have a little bit of trouble breaking down some of these cell walls
not to say that they won't obviously fungi are badass decomposers but it's
just one of those things to point out that maybe you would want to find a way
to transform it first but overall not a bad idea and you could have potentially
have a you know a very specific type of algae that only grows in that region
that produces a very specific type of metabolite that could actually be very
useful in plants you know let's say it's a type of sugar that does something to
plants that no other type of sugar does because no other you know that algae
doesn't grow anywhere else in the world so hopefully that inspires you to look
inside and see what's going on there it certainly does thank you very much for
that yeah and I would just also add then you're also going to be getting all the
benefits of those successful microbiology that's in your environment
right you know staying true to some of those Korean natural farming practices
where you're using those indigenous microorganisms so when you collect those
things that are successful in your environment and you utilize those
products as part of your your growing you're bringing that productivity in and
you're bringing in those things that are successful in your environment that's
why it's such a powerful tool so yeah no I absolutely recommend doing that
looking at some fermentation or some other techniques to try to utilize that
material and you know there's also we're talking about in Korean natural farming
we use a seawater seawater is a great great product to add into your into your
especially when you're brewing a tea or a liquid IMO but seawater is fantastic
it's got a ton of biology but the place that you want to collect seawater is
actually in an area where it's more of an estuary where you're getting that
natural blend between the water that's coming from the land and the water
that's coming from the sea combined together where you're getting that
massive burst of biology those are usually the most rich and bountiful
areas of water where you get those combinations and you get such a
diversity of life in those spaces that you want to try to capture from from
there so hope I didn't go too off too far off down on the natural farming
philosophy there but it's really really awesome when you introduce the aquatic
life forms into your land-based gardening and when mixing the salt water
be aware I think it's the ratio a thousand to one is it Jason when mixing
that in with you onto your garden remember not to over salinate our garden
yeah yeah no it is definitely mixed in that I actually think that ratio is is is
a bit higher than that but I don't actually have my spreadsheet in front of
me unfortunately so I will back channel you though that correct ratio sir you
can also make a fermented seawater as well and I'll send you information on
that as well all right so do we have anything else any other questions before
we wrap up I think we had a fantastic conversation going on I did want to
mention that I think Chris holding was on to something with his comment and I
think that's an awesome awesome marketing slogan when your plant seeks
help seek help so anyway he was commenting that seek help sounds like
seek help s eek HV LP so I think that's a great marketing campaign you may want
to steal that and if you do I want I want I want some I want in on that and I
think Chris holding also wants in on that as well right so when your plants
seek help seek help all right so with that I'm gonna go ahead and close it
down thank you so much everybody for joining us tonight it's been an awesome
show super fun a lot of interesting information and as I said earlier I will
definitely never look at sugar the same way again thank you dr. Mike and drew
and Luke and Johnny and Tim and Amos and Brian and Abe and Diane and Tyson and
Artemis and Christina Roxanne Jolie Lisa and Jason for joining us tonight chef
and Abraham and we had Marshall artist and wheatest and shredder and chef and
and Gibby of course has been with us for the whole show we just as well as Sonny
Chiva joining unfortunately at the end he's usually here for the whole show and
no he's gonna relisten to this because he was sugar so thank you all for
joining us we are here back next week and we're going to be talking about hot
blatant viroid which is a big topic of conversation in the community and we
have the wonderful and talented Evian joining us next week along with our good
friend Johnny who's an awesome regenerative farmer and we're gonna talk
about the hot blatant viroid we're gonna get into it and we're gonna talk
about ways to try to keep yourself safe from it and we're also going to talk
about you know all the hype around it because I know personally every time I
post a picture that has a little bit of a curling leave or something looks a
little funky they're like you should have it tested for hot blatant viroid so
yeah there's a lot of that running around as well so it is a problem it is
a serious issue for the community but it is not always the cause of some
deformity on a plant I think people like simple solutions so anyway we're gonna
jump into that next week get into the hot blatant viroid and so it's gonna be
an awesome conversation I'm really looking forward to having Evian and
Johnny up with us next week so thank you all for joining us 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m.
Eastern every Thursday night here on Clubhouse and simulcast on YouTube on
the Future Cannabis Project FCPO2 thank you London as always for producing the
show sir I will allow you to take us out as I end the room have a fantastic
evening everybody
every time every single time I go on in the mute my mute problem anyways
hopefully my children are running around in the background and spend time so they
all get ready for bed it gets a little hectic here but anyways another amazing
show again from the the Joda crew thanks Jason we appreciate you I appreciate you
I love having you on the show and I'm Evian and and Johnny are gonna add a lot
of value and a ton of awesome conversation as well so I look forward
to that next week and appreciate every single time you hold something together
there's lots of stuff going on all throughout the community I don't think
there's anything tonight I haven't seen much scheduled for tomorrow but Saturday
Chad will be back at 2 and something I'm actually I'm doing a morning show on
Saturday too so we'll be doing a morning show on Saturday because we didn't do
the cannabis for breakfast so we're doing cannabis for breakfast on Saturday
morning we got a really cool guest coming on I'm excited to check out his
grow it looks really sick but yeah hopefully we have a good time keep an
eye out for good stuff check out the description and the links in the
comments and stuff like that and keep it growing
peace out
