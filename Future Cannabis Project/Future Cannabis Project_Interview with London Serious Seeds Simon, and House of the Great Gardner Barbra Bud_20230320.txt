[00:41.600 --> 00:47.040]  Hello, hello, hello. London here at Spanabus yet again. We're excited. This is the second
[00:47.040 --> 00:50.560]  time I've gotten the opportunity to shoot. Actually, third time we met first at Grow Up.
[00:50.560 --> 00:54.960]  Yeah. And then we had you on the show The Sift with Ron Harrington, which was
[00:54.960 --> 00:58.960]  delightful. We're at like 4,000 views on that already. It's done really, really
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.520]  well. So thank you for so much for coming on because it's always about community.
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.800]  So I have Simon here and Matt, right? Yeah. Do you guys want to introduce yourself a
[01:08.800 --> 01:11.200]  little bit to the camera? Let people know who you are that might not.
[01:11.760 --> 01:19.600]  Okay. I'm Simon from Serious Seeds. And I'm doing this kind of thing. I'm breeding seeds
[01:19.600 --> 01:29.840]  for about next year, 30 years. So yeah, I came out with some things which are well known,
[01:29.840 --> 01:36.080]  I guess. Like AK-47, bubblegum, Calimis, white Russian, things like that.
[01:36.640 --> 01:42.320]  So humble. So humble. I mean, AK-47, you have some of the classics that a lot of like,
[01:42.320 --> 01:48.640]  Kevin Jodry was on the show recently with us on our, when we did the last episode of The Sift.
[01:48.640 --> 01:56.720]  And he based a lot of his success in the early days off of an AK-47 that he found.
[01:56.720 --> 02:01.920]  Then he's like, I was so excited to talk to Simon to say thank you because that was actually killer.
[02:02.240 --> 02:06.320]  Those that know Jodry is a huge name in the industry and space in California has done a lot
[02:06.320 --> 02:11.920]  of work. So to have that line, it's very cool to have those little things. It's quite an amazing
[02:11.920 --> 02:18.000]  story that you've done with the AK-47. Now we met for the first time today and you're from BC.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.560]  Yeah. My name's Matt. I'm the breeder for House of the Great Gardener, which is our European
[02:23.520 --> 02:32.080]  company. And then in Canada, we have Great Gardener Farms, the legal micro production
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.880]  facility out on Vancouver Island. So we supply the legal market in Canada.
[02:36.880 --> 02:43.680]  So what does your farm supply to dispensaries? What markets are you in and what markets can we
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.560]  help get more exposure for you? If I have people in Ontario, should they go to the dispensary and
[02:48.560 --> 02:59.520]  ask? So in Ontario, I think you have access to Waterhash and Barbera Bud, Barbera Bud Waterhash,
[02:59.520 --> 03:08.720]  Barbera Bud Vape Carts and seeds. We have Barbera Bud, Orange Barb and CBD RenÃ© seeds available in
[03:08.720 --> 03:17.840]  Ontario. We also have Barbera Bud Rosin. It's available in BC along with the Hash and the
[03:17.840 --> 03:24.640]  Vape Hens and all the seeds. Those are the two main markets. We're doing a little bit in Manitoba
[03:26.320 --> 03:33.680]  and I think we'll start a little bit in Saskatchewan. So those are sort of coming soon.
[03:34.480 --> 03:39.760]  Awesome. Now, Simon, you're back. One of the things that we love about you is you have this
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.360]  very kind of select catalogue of things you do very, very, very well. Is there anything new that
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.680]  we can be excited about coming to the market this year or in the next little while? Or is there
[03:49.680 --> 03:55.200]  something that maybe you're bringing back? The thing we just came out with two strains which
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.920]  are really nice. I don't know if they're known yet, but that's the Siriosa and the Siriotica.
[04:00.080 --> 04:07.040]  The names maybe confusing for people, but you have to understand that I have so many problems
[04:07.040 --> 04:13.760]  with people using my names for their own CBD seeds, which gives me bad rep in return. And
[04:14.880 --> 04:20.080]  you know, it takes a long time to find that without any solution basically. So now,
[04:20.800 --> 04:28.400]  and I have a fair amount of infusion of Sirius 6 being a very popular outdoor strain. Nobody ever
[04:28.400 --> 04:33.840]  used the name of that. But a lot of awards and stuff. And that's because Sirius is in there. So
[04:33.840 --> 04:41.360]  now I'm trying to think of that solution, Siriosa, Siriotica. And I think people will probably not
[04:41.360 --> 04:47.200]  use those names because they refer to Sirius seeds, right? So that's sort of an excuse for
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.480]  people, sorry that the names look alike so much, but that's behind it. It's also a really good
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.920]  branding. I mean, when it comes down to keeping your name on the tip of people's tongues and
[04:58.640 --> 05:02.400]  when they're talking to you about strains, it creates more of a dialogue. Where did it come
[05:02.400 --> 05:07.440]  from? Oh, it's actually Sirius. It's not just an exotic or blah, blah, blah. This is from Sirius.
[05:07.440 --> 05:10.960]  It's so important. What do you do to differentiate yourself and your market?
[05:12.960 --> 05:19.360]  House of the Great Gardener, what do we do different? I mean, we were sort of some of the originators
[05:19.360 --> 05:25.760]  in the rosin process. I mean, our Barbara Bud strain that is well known in Barcelona and well
[05:25.760 --> 05:34.720]  known sort of around the world was one of the original strains used by the guy that gave rosin
[05:34.720 --> 05:43.360]  its name, rosin. So it was at the time, I mean, this goes back like 10 years before rosin.
[05:43.360 --> 05:51.200]  Otterhash was just a thing and Barbara Bud strain, especially in Spain here, became
[05:51.760 --> 06:00.480]  almost a cult classic. We now see Barbara Bud in third generation crosses all over Barcelona.
[06:00.480 --> 06:05.680]  You can go into the pubs in Barcelona and chances are they'll have a Barbara Bud or a Barbara Bud
[06:05.680 --> 06:14.240]  cross of some sort on the menu in hash forms. So we've really got our name for producing high-end
[06:15.200 --> 06:25.360]  solventless concentrates. And we've now had about 80 awards on four continents and most of them are
[06:25.360 --> 06:32.400]  for hash. I mean, I've grown up in BC and it's really kind of surreal to meet Barbara Bud.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.120]  Yeah, they don't know. And I've grown up in White Rock. I grew up in this area. This was
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.000]  a plant I had interaction with and to meet someone, the person, it's a really big deal.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  So I don't like to keep these too long because there's so much going on in these awesome spaces.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.720]  But I always, there's one question I have to ask each one of you. You know, there's a lot of
[06:54.720 --> 06:59.120]  challenges right now in the cannabis space. We have all these investors running away, which is
[06:59.120 --> 07:03.760]  great. And we have the OGs left, people that were here for the plant and that are really part of it.
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.040]  So my question is, what would you tell the farmers that are going through the bullshit right now?
[07:09.760 --> 07:13.200]  What would you tell them to help get them through? What's the next step? Like,
[07:13.200 --> 07:17.280]  what do you think will help them? What do you mean, the farmers? Yeah, the farmers. Like,
[07:17.280 --> 07:22.800]  if you were a farmer in the early space, in legal space right now, what might you tell them
[07:22.800 --> 07:29.280]  to keep them going, to help them progress? Maybe you want to start on this one?
[07:30.640 --> 07:35.760]  It's tough, man, because it's hard. You got to keep it. You got to keep it slim and trim. I mean,
[07:36.080 --> 07:41.760]  you know, there's, I mean, everybody's started, everybody's throwing money at everything,
[07:41.760 --> 07:46.320]  you know, promotion this, promotion that. But I mean, really, at the end of the day,
[07:47.200 --> 07:54.880]  it's about producing quality product. Don't put your money into advertising and don't put your
[07:54.880 --> 08:01.520]  money into other things. You should be focusing on the genetics that you're growing. Make sure that
[08:01.600 --> 08:07.680]  you get your genetics from like the breeders that are going. If you're not sort of breeding
[08:07.680 --> 08:14.800]  yourself, make sure you go to reputable breeders that have genetics that you can sort of count on.
[08:14.800 --> 08:21.600]  I mean, we're in a world right now that's sort of hot-blatant byroid is on the rise, right? And we
[08:21.600 --> 08:29.120]  have so many, they say like 95% of all seed banks currently were started in the last three to five
[08:29.200 --> 08:36.640]  years, right? That's 95% of them. And if they're not doing testing, if they're not testing their
[08:36.640 --> 08:42.080]  genetics to make sure that they're not, they don't have hot-blatant byroids, the hot-blatant byroids
[08:42.080 --> 08:47.440]  can get into the seed. And then all of a sudden you're selling seed to people, three to 5% of
[08:47.440 --> 08:53.360]  the seed, you start 100 seeds, you're going to have it in there. So you really got to be,
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.680]  you just got to know where you're getting your stuff from and just know that those people are
[08:59.680 --> 09:07.600]  doing the testings and are, you know, fine-tuning their selection instead of just sort of willy-nilly
[09:07.600 --> 09:12.560]  pollen chucking, you know, you just don't know. You don't know what the outcome is going to be.
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.280]  Nothing wrong with pollen chucking, but do it at home, you know, don't do it in the mid-season.
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.080]  Yeah, for sure. I totally encourage people to sort of, you know, cross things and stuff. But
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.240]  if you're a person going into the legal profession and you're spending a million dollars on your
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.360]  facility and you're, you know, you've got all the bells and whistles and everything in the facility,
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.320]  the last thing to do is not to cheap out on the genetics that you're going to bring into
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.840]  your facility. And then the last thing is grow stuff that you like to smoke, right?
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.040]  Yeah, if you smoke, you start.
[09:47.040 --> 09:48.160]  Don't chase the market.
[09:48.640 --> 09:53.600]  I want to add to that because I saw when I heard about all the problems, you know,
[09:53.600 --> 10:01.120]  the producers had with mildew, for instance, and how you combat that by genetics which are,
[10:01.120 --> 10:04.800]  you know, not mildew susceptible. Our seriotica, for instance, you know,
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.200]  it's not susceptible to mildew.
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.720]  Can you pass me the seriotica pic? Because this is just an absolute gorgeous plant. We'll get
[10:12.720 --> 10:13.760]  a zoom in on that.
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.800]  I don't know. We have different things. This is our latest strain which is great.
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.160]  Somebody grew 700 of them, also production in Thailand.
[10:25.840 --> 10:28.160]  Production in Thailand in that humid environment?
[10:28.160 --> 10:34.880]  Yes, exactly. He grows in 90-95% humidity, no mildew at all, and very few, only two plants
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.520]  out of 700 that actually great fungus. So he was completely delighted. And they harvested it at
[10:41.600 --> 10:47.600]  five and a half weeks. That's to me a bit short. I would say six and a half to seven weeks or
[10:47.600 --> 10:54.400]  something, but he was very happy with the results. So I mean, this is our latest seed and it's
[10:54.400 --> 10:57.760]  absolutely fantastic. For some of the reasons I just mentioned.
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.880]  Start with the good and don't, it's hard enough. It's hard enough to do this and jump into this
[11:06.880 --> 11:11.760]  industry. Start, make sure that you jump off of someone's work like yourself that have taken the
[11:11.760 --> 11:14.960]  time to do it. Now, thank you guys so much. We are professional seed makers. We put a lot of
[11:14.960 --> 11:19.920]  time and effort. We put all our time and effort and passion into making those great seeds.
[11:20.960 --> 11:26.560]  Look at our list. We don't start with a list of 50 seeds like every seed company starting nowadays.
[11:27.200 --> 11:31.920]  How many I walked up to, I walked up to a few of these. I won't say their names. I walked up and
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.720]  they got a list of like this and I'm like, okay, I've got some friends, beautiful breeders. They
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.280]  make some amazing CBD stuff. I pulled them right off the mountain to bring them to you to show and
[11:41.280 --> 11:47.280]  they're like, no, we produce all of our own seeds, just ourselves. It's like, you have one breeder
[11:47.280 --> 11:52.320]  and you have 80 strains. It's a month. I can plant any seed from any pack. I'm going to get the same
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.280]  fucking thing out of it. And it's, you're just bullshit. Right. And it's, it's sad. And you know,
[11:57.280 --> 12:01.840]  there's nothing wrong with white label. I don't see a problem with that, but as a business, I think
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.840]  it's, it's like, you've got to say it. I'm going to white label. It's like people, there's this
[12:05.840 --> 12:12.080]  group of processors in Canada that are producing flour, but all they do is take it and put it in
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.800]  the bag and sell it. But they're selling it themselves. Like they're the farms behind it.
[12:16.800 --> 12:20.960]  And it's just like, no, you're a trapper. Like that's what you are. And let's call it for what
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.320]  it is. And you know what? There's nothing wrong with that. The biggest brands in the world are
[12:24.320 --> 12:29.440]  made off of traffic. You just tell the truth. There's some hash on the market in Canada that
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.760]  came out and, and it's like, all of a sudden it comes out. It's like, well, you're mixing
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.640]  distillate and botanical turps in with your hash, but you're not telling people. Yeah. Right. And
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.680]  it's like, I don't mind. I don't mind if you make that piece of hash, but if I buy that piece of
[12:43.680 --> 12:50.080]  hash, then I find out after you put distillate into it to sort of bind it. I'm not going to be
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.520]  a happy kid. But if it's on the package and you're being honest with what you're doing, I have no
[12:55.520 --> 13:01.760]  issues with, with you being honest. You're trying to deceive people into a snappy marketing campaign.
[13:01.760 --> 13:06.560]  And at the end of the day, the product is, you know, it's not, it's not really hash. I'm not
[13:06.560 --> 13:11.040]  sure what you would call that. Hash with distillate and botanical turps in it. It's just like a
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.800]  salad soup. Anyway, thank you guys so much. You guys are going to be here for the next couple
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.040]  of days. Of course. Um, how can we support both of you? How can my community support you guys?
[13:25.040 --> 13:29.520]  Like other than going on and buying your seeds, of course. Um, where can we find you in social
[13:29.600 --> 13:33.360]  sites and that type of stuff? Oh yeah, we have an Instagram and we have a website.
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.440]  Serious seeds. You'll find them. Houseofthegreatgardener.com,
[13:46.160 --> 13:50.800]  great gardener on Instagram. I think it's a great gardener underscore on Twitter.
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.480]  House of the great gardener on Facebook. That's how you get a hold of us. Appreciate it. Well,
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.240]  thank you again and I hope you guys have an awesome spanimus and let's get all this.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.080]  Thank you man. Awesome. Thanks guys.
