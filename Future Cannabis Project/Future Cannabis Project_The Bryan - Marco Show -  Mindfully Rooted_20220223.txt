[00:01.020 --> 00:06.020]  And we are live back on another wonderful Wednesday.
[00:06.020 --> 00:08.860]  You guys are tuned into the Brian and Marco show.
[00:08.860 --> 00:12.480]  So let me turn it over to your hosts, Brian and Marco.
[00:12.480 --> 00:15.540]  Yeah, happy Wednesday to you, living soil folks,
[00:15.540 --> 00:17.420]  and also bioactive folks.
[00:17.420 --> 00:19.800]  This is, I'm trying to include maybe two sides
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.240]  of the coin here today.
[00:21.240 --> 00:24.080]  I know one side enjoys exotic animals
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.500]  while the other side has exotic animals, but loves cannabis.
[00:27.500 --> 00:29.660]  So one of the main things on both sides of the coin
[00:29.660 --> 00:32.660]  is understanding what builds a living soil system,
[00:32.660 --> 00:35.720]  what builds a bioactive substrate.
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.340]  Those are for the most part interchangeable worlds.
[00:38.340 --> 00:42.420]  They're just two different sides,
[00:42.420 --> 00:43.780]  two different views on things.
[00:43.780 --> 00:46.100]  So I'm excited to be able to talk more.
[00:46.100 --> 00:48.700]  And if you are coming from the reptile world today,
[00:48.700 --> 00:50.620]  we appreciate that you guys are watching
[00:50.620 --> 00:52.060]  this show today as well.
[00:52.060 --> 00:54.060]  But from our background,
[00:54.060 --> 00:56.660]  it really is feeding the soil, not the plant.
[00:56.660 --> 00:57.860]  So it's kind of the same thing.
[00:57.860 --> 01:02.860]  We're gonna feed the soil, not necessarily focused on NPK
[01:03.340 --> 01:05.980]  for you guys that are used to farming in that manner.
[01:05.980 --> 01:07.740]  When we're building these soil systems,
[01:07.740 --> 01:11.660]  they in time end up feeding that soil system themselves.
[01:11.660 --> 01:13.260]  So we're trying to get as close as we can
[01:13.260 --> 01:14.740]  to a closed loop system.
[01:14.740 --> 01:16.740]  Same thing in a terrarium or vivarium.
[01:16.740 --> 01:19.920]  We're really trying to take that stuff to the next level.
[01:19.920 --> 01:23.200]  I would also let you guys know that my co-host Marco
[01:23.200 --> 01:27.180]  made a fantastic soil horizons, like mini vivarium.
[01:27.220 --> 01:28.340]  So you guys can check that out.
[01:28.340 --> 01:30.460]  I believe that's on the playlist, Marco.
[01:30.460 --> 01:32.920]  We've had a Mindfully Rooted on the show before.
[01:32.920 --> 01:34.820]  And of course, obviously we've had Marco on the show
[01:34.820 --> 01:37.700]  and then he became a co-host with me.
[01:37.700 --> 01:40.140]  The main thing that I like about both of these two gentlemen
[01:40.140 --> 01:42.540]  is they go really deep into understanding things.
[01:42.540 --> 01:44.420]  They don't bullshit you so that you realize
[01:44.420 --> 01:46.620]  that you're going to make mistakes.
[01:46.620 --> 01:49.100]  That's kind of the key aspect of this show today.
[01:49.100 --> 01:51.980]  We hope to minimize the mistakes that you guys are doing
[01:51.980 --> 01:53.900]  from some of the big brains here,
[01:53.900 --> 01:55.700]  guys that I trust that understand
[01:55.700 --> 01:58.340]  building indigenous microorganisms.
[01:58.340 --> 01:59.620]  This is a lot of time.
[01:59.620 --> 02:02.040]  So if you may mess up or maybe you don't understand
[02:02.040 --> 02:04.260]  everything from A to Z, the way that you thought,
[02:04.260 --> 02:06.860]  you could have a horrible outcome.
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.620]  And then of course, frustration kicks in.
[02:09.620 --> 02:10.540]  Time is money.
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.740]  So to waste a lot of time doing this,
[02:12.740 --> 02:15.540]  we hope that putting in three hours today,
[02:15.540 --> 02:19.620]  listening to us is going to really minimize the failures,
[02:19.620 --> 02:21.280]  the failure boxes that you're putting out,
[02:21.280 --> 02:23.820]  or just understanding the system from A to Z.
[02:23.820 --> 02:25.460]  These two gentlemen really understand that.
[02:26.220 --> 02:28.740]  So I'm excited to kick it off and give it over to Marco
[02:28.740 --> 02:31.820]  to kind of talk about what he sees in Johnny as well.
[02:32.920 --> 02:35.580]  Yeah, good afternoon, Living Soil Nerds.
[02:35.580 --> 02:37.380]  Good to see y'all again on this Wednesday.
[02:37.380 --> 02:39.380]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:39.380 --> 02:42.740]  Yeah, today we got a friend, Mindfully Rooted.
[02:42.740 --> 02:45.820]  Johnny is somebody that I've known on IG for a while.
[02:45.820 --> 02:49.020]  We bounced a lot of things off of each other.
[02:49.020 --> 02:52.900]  Grown together in a sense of learning this natural farming
[02:52.940 --> 02:55.540]  and different techniques and things that each other
[02:55.540 --> 02:56.820]  kind of brings to the table
[02:56.820 --> 02:58.820]  and things that we've learned over time.
[02:59.900 --> 03:01.420]  Like Brian said, we're talking about building
[03:01.420 --> 03:03.020]  these living soil systems.
[03:03.020 --> 03:06.900]  And you can't do that without the inclusion
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.980]  of indigenous microorganisms.
[03:10.380 --> 03:12.760]  So one thing we will be getting into
[03:12.760 --> 03:14.240]  is a collection of those.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.180]  And I can't wait to hear what Johnny has to say on that
[03:17.180 --> 03:22.180]  as far as collecting IMO and multiplying them in IMO piles
[03:22.180 --> 03:24.100]  and just experiences along the way
[03:24.100 --> 03:26.860]  and natural farming in general.
[03:26.860 --> 03:29.220]  Starting off, I wanna give the floor to Johnny
[03:29.220 --> 03:33.220]  and let him kind of take us into a different direction.
[03:33.220 --> 03:36.020]  I want you guys to free your minds a little bit.
[03:36.020 --> 03:38.180]  Mental health is a huge thing.
[03:38.180 --> 03:41.540]  Johnny is in that industry in his other life,
[03:41.540 --> 03:45.100]  Clark Kent, Superman, a lot of us are.
[03:45.100 --> 03:47.900]  So yeah, let's just open our ears a little bit,
[03:47.900 --> 03:51.460]  chill out on the chat and let's let Johnny take us to a spot
[03:51.460 --> 03:52.380]  and then we'll go there
[03:52.380 --> 03:54.660]  and then we'll start this conversation.
[03:54.660 --> 03:56.140]  Cool, appreciate you guys.
[03:56.140 --> 03:58.060]  Thanks for having me.
[03:58.060 --> 03:59.420]  Thanks for having me again.
[04:00.620 --> 04:02.740]  I wanted to start today off a little different
[04:02.740 --> 04:05.180]  than what I hear some of the other shows
[04:05.180 --> 04:06.500]  that you guys have done.
[04:06.500 --> 04:08.300]  Just something that kind of speaks to
[04:09.500 --> 04:11.660]  like what Marco was saying, my other life
[04:11.660 --> 04:15.380]  outside of the cannabis industry and things like that.
[04:15.380 --> 04:20.380]  And part of my handle and my Instagram
[04:20.620 --> 04:21.460]  if you guys have seen,
[04:21.460 --> 04:26.220]  it's really taking a mindfulness approach at growing
[04:26.220 --> 04:29.380]  and trying to really be in the present moment
[04:29.380 --> 04:30.700]  when you're doing things.
[04:30.700 --> 04:32.340]  So what I wanted to do
[04:32.340 --> 04:35.420]  is just do a quick mindfulness exercise with everybody.
[04:35.420 --> 04:38.300]  I just wanna invite everybody to participate.
[04:38.300 --> 04:40.300]  If you do, awesome.
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.940]  If you don't, no pressure.
[04:44.180 --> 04:45.260]  I just wanna invite everybody
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.060]  to kind of get in a comfortable seat,
[04:47.060 --> 04:48.860]  put your feet on the floor.
[04:48.860 --> 04:50.300]  If you're laying down, that's fine.
[04:51.180 --> 04:52.140]  Just somewhere where you feel nice and comfortable
[04:52.140 --> 04:54.660]  where you can kind of sit still or lay still.
[04:55.860 --> 04:57.180]  If you have any sensitivity
[04:57.180 --> 04:59.380]  or anything that's happened to you around water,
[04:59.380 --> 05:00.220]  I just wanna let you know
[05:00.220 --> 05:03.540]  that this exercise does visualize water.
[05:03.540 --> 05:06.580]  So I also wanna be sensitive to that as well.
[05:06.580 --> 05:09.020]  So just kind of give you a full warning
[05:09.020 --> 05:09.860]  of what we're gonna be doing.
[05:09.860 --> 05:12.180]  Just very brief, couple minutes,
[05:13.180 --> 05:15.500]  just to kind of get everybody into this,
[05:15.500 --> 05:17.380]  the mindset of emptying your mind
[05:17.380 --> 05:19.820]  and just being present with this conversation
[05:20.340 --> 05:21.500]  that we're gonna have today.
[05:21.500 --> 05:23.660]  So I just like everybody
[05:23.660 --> 05:26.380]  to kind of get in a comfortable position
[05:26.380 --> 05:28.260]  and you can either close your eyes
[05:28.260 --> 05:31.020]  or just gently fix your eyes in a room
[05:31.020 --> 05:32.620]  in a spot right in front of you.
[05:33.460 --> 05:35.580]  And I'd like you to visualize yourself
[05:35.580 --> 05:38.500]  sitting beside a gentle flowing stream
[05:38.500 --> 05:41.100]  with leaves floating along the surface of the water.
[05:41.980 --> 05:43.100]  And just take some time
[05:43.100 --> 05:45.300]  just to try to visualize that in your mind.
[05:49.400 --> 05:50.960]  What the grass might look like,
[05:51.800 --> 05:53.760]  what the trees around you may look like,
[05:55.400 --> 05:56.240]  things like that.
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.440]  For the next few minutes,
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.880]  take each thought that enters your mind
[06:01.880 --> 06:05.360]  and place it on a leaf and just let it float by.
[06:06.720 --> 06:08.720]  Do this with each thought,
[06:08.720 --> 06:11.560]  pleasurable, painful, or even neutral.
[06:13.160 --> 06:15.760]  And even if you have joyous or enthusiastic thoughts,
[06:15.760 --> 06:18.560]  maybe about what we're gonna be talking about today,
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.480]  just place them on a leaf and just let them float by.
[06:26.170 --> 06:28.170]  And if your thoughts momentarily stop,
[06:29.850 --> 06:32.170]  just sit there and just watch the stream.
[06:32.170 --> 06:36.050]  And sooner or later, your thoughts will start up again.
[06:52.490 --> 06:55.050]  And allow the stream to flow at its own pace.
[06:55.050 --> 06:59.210]  Don't try to speed it up and rush your thoughts along.
[06:59.210 --> 07:00.970]  You're not trying to rush the leaves along
[07:00.970 --> 07:03.210]  or get rid of any of your thoughts.
[07:03.210 --> 07:06.570]  You're allowing them to come and go at their own pace.
[07:08.330 --> 07:11.770]  And your mind might say, this is done or I'm bored,
[07:11.770 --> 07:13.770]  or maybe I'm not doing this right.
[07:13.770 --> 07:15.730]  Place those thoughts on the leaves too
[07:15.730 --> 07:16.890]  and just let them pass.
[07:29.990 --> 07:31.270]  And if a leaf gets stuck,
[07:32.230 --> 07:34.910]  allow it to hang around until it's ready to float by.
[07:36.270 --> 07:37.790]  If the thought comes up again,
[07:37.790 --> 07:39.590]  just watch it float by another time.
[07:52.420 --> 07:54.780]  If a difficult or painful feeling arises,
[07:54.780 --> 07:57.420]  simply just acknowledge it and say to yourself,
[07:57.420 --> 08:00.020]  I'm noticing myself having this feeling of boredom,
[08:00.020 --> 08:04.380]  impatience, frustration, whatever may be coming up for you.
[08:04.380 --> 08:06.380]  And just place those thoughts on the leaf
[08:06.380 --> 08:07.860]  and allow them to float along.
[08:09.500 --> 08:12.180]  From time to time, your thoughts may hook you
[08:12.180 --> 08:14.860]  and distract you from being fully present in this exercise
[08:14.860 --> 08:16.300]  or even in life.
[08:16.300 --> 08:18.500]  And this is completely normal.
[08:18.500 --> 08:22.940]  As soon as you realize that you're becoming sidetracked,
[08:22.940 --> 08:24.820]  just gently bring your attention back
[08:25.740 --> 08:27.940]  to this visualization exercise
[08:27.940 --> 08:30.260]  or to what you're doing in your day-to-day life.
[08:33.320 --> 08:36.120]  And when you're ready, open your eyes,
[08:36.120 --> 08:37.200]  come back to the room.
[08:42.110 --> 08:43.550]  Thank you guys.
[08:43.550 --> 08:44.390]  Appreciate that.
[08:45.310 --> 08:47.270]  All right, all right.
[08:47.270 --> 08:48.110]  Nice.
[08:48.110 --> 08:49.510]  Appreciate you guiding that, man.
[08:49.510 --> 08:52.470]  Always open to new intros and stuff.
[08:52.470 --> 08:55.870]  So yeah, man, we appreciate that, boy.
[08:55.870 --> 08:59.830]  I'm definitely relaxed and ready to do this.
[08:59.830 --> 09:01.390]  Trying to get in my flow today.
[09:02.310 --> 09:03.390]  Well, stay in it, bro.
[09:03.390 --> 09:04.310]  Go, go.
[09:06.830 --> 09:09.030]  If you got something you want to talk about specifically,
[09:09.030 --> 09:10.350]  if you got some flow,
[09:10.350 --> 09:13.110]  I'm not gonna come on in and do his thing.
[09:13.110 --> 09:14.390]  Yeah, do your thing, man.
[09:15.390 --> 09:18.630]  Well, when we're putting up all these things,
[09:18.630 --> 09:20.830]  people are starting to understand from the rhizosphere.
[09:20.830 --> 09:24.670]  And remember guys that this is all these words even,
[09:24.670 --> 09:26.630]  I think a lot of these people have to kind of,
[09:26.630 --> 09:28.070]  maybe you can go run to the dictionary
[09:28.070 --> 09:29.910]  and find out what rhizosphere means.
[09:29.910 --> 09:32.190]  Plant growth promoted rhizobacteria.
[09:32.190 --> 09:33.510]  Some of these different things where it's like,
[09:33.510 --> 09:34.710]  what the hell is this?
[09:34.710 --> 09:36.630]  When reality, all we're kind of teaching
[09:36.630 --> 09:38.510]  is that we're harnessing mother nature.
[09:38.510 --> 09:40.470]  We're learning to use mother nature in our favor.
[09:40.470 --> 09:42.230]  There's ways to improve on mother nature
[09:42.230 --> 09:43.510]  by using our farmer brain
[09:43.510 --> 09:46.150]  and finding ways to continue to improve things.
[09:46.150 --> 09:48.150]  That's what these two gentlemen represent,
[09:48.150 --> 09:51.110]  in my opinion, from the IMO world.
[09:51.110 --> 09:52.990]  There's so many different ways to do this,
[09:52.990 --> 09:54.470]  but these guys have it dialed in.
[09:55.270 --> 09:56.830]  And again, this is the same thing
[09:56.830 --> 09:58.350]  with all this other stuff that we talk about.
[09:58.350 --> 10:00.790]  There's a variety of ways to do this.
[10:00.790 --> 10:02.750]  You yourself are gonna wanna be the chef.
[10:02.750 --> 10:05.390]  So you decide what recipe you wanna work with.
[10:05.390 --> 10:07.270]  It's just different people have found success
[10:07.270 --> 10:08.110]  with different things.
[10:08.110 --> 10:10.230]  And remember, we all don't live in the same environment.
[10:10.230 --> 10:12.310]  So the same thing that's gonna work for me in Colorado
[10:12.310 --> 10:13.750]  is not gonna work for Marco.
[10:13.750 --> 10:15.590]  There's little nuances, little variables
[10:15.590 --> 10:19.110]  that you're gonna have to fine tune and dial in.
[10:19.110 --> 10:22.270]  So the main point of also of this show today, boys,
[10:22.310 --> 10:24.590]  is that I want you guys to kind of talk about ways
[10:24.590 --> 10:27.190]  that you've seen, what were your struggles with
[10:27.190 --> 10:29.990]  so that people can kind of maybe head off
[10:29.990 --> 10:31.710]  or maybe not see that frustration?
[10:31.710 --> 10:34.190]  Because I've even felt that frustration going out,
[10:34.190 --> 10:35.550]  putting out the boxes,
[10:35.550 --> 10:37.470]  maybe hitting one out of 10 the first time,
[10:37.470 --> 10:39.070]  two out of 10 the second time,
[10:39.070 --> 10:40.790]  and just feeling kind of defeated.
[10:45.070 --> 10:46.950]  So Brian, I think what you're describing
[10:46.950 --> 10:51.950]  is very realistic and very normal to start with.
[10:52.790 --> 10:55.670]  You're gonna have hundreds of collections
[10:55.670 --> 10:58.270]  and you may only pull a couple
[10:58.270 --> 10:59.870]  that are actually worthwhile.
[11:02.750 --> 11:04.630]  Patience is gonna be your best friend
[11:04.630 --> 11:05.470]  when it comes to this.
[11:05.470 --> 11:06.790]  It's one of the reasons why I wanna kind of start
[11:06.790 --> 11:09.470]  with that exercise, just kind of bring us into this,
[11:09.470 --> 11:11.870]  to understanding that it's like,
[11:11.870 --> 11:14.110]  you can't control nature.
[11:14.110 --> 11:15.630]  So you're gonna put out these boxes,
[11:15.630 --> 11:18.150]  you're gonna try to collect IMO,
[11:18.150 --> 11:20.870]  and an animal's gonna get to it.
[11:20.870 --> 11:25.390]  It rains, something gets into it.
[11:26.710 --> 11:28.390]  Maybe a park ranger comes and takes it.
[11:28.390 --> 11:29.430]  Like there's all these different things
[11:29.430 --> 11:32.050]  that you can't control.
[11:33.310 --> 11:35.310]  So it's really patience, I think is,
[11:36.910 --> 11:38.150]  patience with the journey, I think,
[11:38.150 --> 11:40.990]  is one of the most important pieces to kind of consider.
[11:40.990 --> 11:44.390]  And really just trying to enjoy the process.
[11:44.390 --> 11:46.350]  That's one of the principles of the KNF.
[11:46.350 --> 11:48.990]  And I know we're not going down the KNF rabbit hole per se,
[11:48.990 --> 11:50.270]  but when we're talking about IMO,
[11:50.710 --> 11:53.070]  that's kind of one of the big components of it.
[11:54.570 --> 11:56.510]  So just as we're kind of talking about this,
[11:56.510 --> 11:57.390]  just keep that in mind.
[11:57.390 --> 11:58.750]  It takes a lot of reps.
[12:00.030 --> 12:01.410]  And even then, like once you feel like
[12:01.410 --> 12:02.330]  you have it figured out,
[12:02.330 --> 12:03.750]  life's just gonna hit you with a curve ball,
[12:03.750 --> 12:06.230]  and you'll be like, you'll get humbled real quickly
[12:06.230 --> 12:08.250]  when it comes to collecting IMO.
[12:11.030 --> 12:12.430]  But yeah, I mean, there's different,
[12:12.430 --> 12:14.070]  yeah, I mean, I don't know where you guys
[12:14.070 --> 12:15.510]  wanna kind of take this.
[12:15.510 --> 12:17.250]  Well, let's start off with substrates.
[12:17.250 --> 12:18.310]  Like when you're building that up,
[12:18.310 --> 12:21.210]  what have you guys seen that you feel is tried and true?
[12:21.210 --> 12:22.990]  And what are some more things that are, again,
[12:22.990 --> 12:24.630]  maybe tried and true for other individuals
[12:24.630 --> 12:26.190]  you haven't found success with?
[12:28.150 --> 12:32.750]  For me, I've primarily stuck with white rice.
[12:32.750 --> 12:34.350]  If we're talking about IMO one, right?
[12:34.350 --> 12:37.870]  So IMO one, right, we're putting out a collection box.
[12:37.870 --> 12:41.870]  For one, I have found that using a container
[12:43.990 --> 12:45.510]  that's made out of a natural material
[12:45.510 --> 12:48.050]  has been the most successful for me,
[12:49.070 --> 12:51.050]  unless I have something else that's laying around.
[12:51.050 --> 12:54.810]  But I've, like I found old cedar fencing
[12:54.810 --> 12:57.910]  that I just literally cut up and made into a little box,
[12:57.910 --> 12:59.270]  and I've used that.
[12:59.270 --> 13:02.230]  I live down in Southern California.
[13:02.230 --> 13:04.470]  There's tortilla shops all over the place
[13:04.470 --> 13:05.310]  around where I live.
[13:05.310 --> 13:07.790]  So I went to a Mexican market
[13:07.790 --> 13:10.310]  and picked up a tortilla basket, and I've used that.
[13:10.310 --> 13:13.170]  Like that worked great for me when I first started off.
[13:14.170 --> 13:16.250]  Just the container size was a little small,
[13:16.250 --> 13:19.290]  so my IMO collections were a little on the smaller end,
[13:19.290 --> 13:21.130]  which means that I have to obviously do more,
[13:21.130 --> 13:23.290]  and I'm gonna run out a little bit quicker.
[13:23.290 --> 13:25.090]  So since then, I've kind of done a little bit
[13:25.090 --> 13:28.890]  of a bigger box, say maybe like an eight by eight box,
[13:28.890 --> 13:32.530]  something around that size, has been good.
[13:32.530 --> 13:37.010]  I've seen people with success with brown rice.
[13:37.010 --> 13:38.850]  I know some people have tried using quinoa,
[13:38.850 --> 13:41.210]  but essentially just some kind of grain.
[13:41.210 --> 13:43.970]  But white rice to me is the tried and true.
[13:43.970 --> 13:47.330]  It's cheap, it's successful to everybody
[13:47.330 --> 13:49.050]  for the majority of people,
[13:50.410 --> 13:52.090]  and then you can make laps out of the rice water
[13:52.090 --> 13:53.610]  after you make that rice.
[13:53.610 --> 13:55.810]  So, I don't know, Marco, what do you think?
[13:57.450 --> 14:01.490]  Yeah, man, I like anything that's cheap.
[14:01.490 --> 14:03.070]  You know me, I like to start there.
[14:03.070 --> 14:07.490]  So I've done things as far as anything cardboard is good,
[14:07.490 --> 14:08.650]  but you gotta put holes in it
[14:08.650 --> 14:10.090]  because cardboard is not breathable,
[14:10.090 --> 14:12.410]  but I like pizza box.
[14:12.410 --> 14:14.990]  My boxes I have are cedar.
[14:14.990 --> 14:17.930]  So I would recommend getting you some good quality boxes.
[14:17.930 --> 14:20.170]  Those I can just throw up in the corner
[14:20.170 --> 14:23.090]  and pull them out and they're all good.
[14:23.090 --> 14:26.530]  So yeah, definitely the box is crucial.
[14:26.530 --> 14:29.870]  I've done things like I've used a bonsai pot.
[14:30.930 --> 14:33.730]  It's just a clay pot, it's got holes on the bottom.
[14:33.730 --> 14:35.010]  It was cracked, so I couldn't,
[14:35.010 --> 14:36.610]  I didn't wanna use it for a bonsai pot,
[14:36.610 --> 14:38.130]  so I used that for a rice collection.
[14:38.610 --> 14:39.650]  It worked out nice.
[14:39.650 --> 14:41.550]  And I've even taken the rice
[14:41.550 --> 14:44.650]  and really cleared the forest floor,
[14:44.650 --> 14:47.730]  put it right on the forest floor, you know what I mean?
[14:47.730 --> 14:51.310]  And got a nice collection right there in direct contact.
[14:51.310 --> 14:52.770]  And that's kind of a crap shoot,
[14:52.770 --> 14:55.290]  whether or not critters get to it or not,
[14:55.290 --> 14:57.730]  but I still did cover it with my tote
[14:57.730 --> 15:00.770]  and my screen kind of how it would on my box.
[15:00.770 --> 15:03.570]  So yeah, man, like you said, lots of different options.
[15:04.450 --> 15:06.130]  Don't get hung up on the box.
[15:06.130 --> 15:07.770]  Try lots of different collections.
[15:07.770 --> 15:08.930]  All those things are key.
[15:08.930 --> 15:10.890]  I like white rice is fine,
[15:10.890 --> 15:12.650]  because I usually have that around.
[15:13.530 --> 15:15.530]  Like Johnny said, I've tried brown rice.
[15:15.530 --> 15:17.330]  That's a little bit more expensive.
[15:18.250 --> 15:20.730]  Results not much different.
[15:20.730 --> 15:22.330]  Some friends have tried sorghum.
[15:22.330 --> 15:24.130]  I'm gonna try that this year.
[15:24.130 --> 15:27.050]  So any kind of grain is gonna be good to inoculate.
[15:27.050 --> 15:30.490]  And one thing I wanna do is kind of grow my grain
[15:30.490 --> 15:33.050]  and then use that to kind of take my collections.
[15:33.050 --> 15:36.090]  So just kind of closing those loops, you know what I mean?
[15:36.930 --> 15:37.770]  And that's next level.
[15:37.770 --> 15:38.810]  That's cool.
[15:38.810 --> 15:39.850]  Yeah, it'd be nice.
[15:39.850 --> 15:41.290]  One thing that Johnny touched on too
[15:41.290 --> 15:44.410]  that I've personally experienced is park rangers.
[15:44.410 --> 15:46.610]  They're not really gonna hear you out on what you're doing.
[15:46.610 --> 15:48.290]  They're like, if you're sitting there
[15:48.290 --> 15:49.610]  with a bucket full of shit,
[15:49.610 --> 15:51.410]  I mean, they made us literally dump it out
[15:51.410 --> 15:53.970]  and then watch this like we had just done a drug deal.
[15:53.970 --> 15:55.810]  You know, I mean, they were on us.
[15:55.810 --> 15:57.290]  And from what I understand,
[15:57.290 --> 16:00.090]  park rangers have a hell of a lot of authority
[16:00.090 --> 16:01.730]  more than you probably think they do.
[16:01.730 --> 16:04.250]  So, you know, use caution
[16:04.250 --> 16:05.370]  when you're out there kind of thing.
[16:05.570 --> 16:07.370]  You know, you yourself are kind of understanding
[16:07.370 --> 16:09.050]  what you're doing, but they have no idea.
[16:09.050 --> 16:13.210]  And they, from what I understand from my interaction,
[16:13.210 --> 16:15.090]  where, you know, I've had two interactions with them,
[16:15.090 --> 16:16.170]  they were pissed.
[16:16.170 --> 16:17.370]  So just remember that.
[16:18.930 --> 16:20.530]  Yeah, no, that's a big one.
[16:20.530 --> 16:24.410]  I mean, it's also not proper
[16:24.410 --> 16:28.090]  and I don't wanna necessarily encourage this to like
[16:28.090 --> 16:29.290]  everybody, but at the same time,
[16:29.290 --> 16:31.610]  like you could always bring stuff home with you,
[16:31.610 --> 16:34.170]  even though technically that's frowned upon
[16:34.210 --> 16:36.250]  or possibly even illegal,
[16:36.250 --> 16:38.010]  depending on the area that you're taking.
[16:38.010 --> 16:39.970]  Like I live in the city,
[16:39.970 --> 16:44.650]  so I don't have, you know, forests around me.
[16:44.650 --> 16:46.570]  So for me, when I go do my collections,
[16:46.570 --> 16:48.170]  I have to drive a couple of hours
[16:49.290 --> 16:52.850]  to go find somewhere where it's undisturbed.
[16:52.850 --> 16:55.930]  A lot of people, you know, have this conception.
[16:55.930 --> 16:58.690]  It's like, just because you get a bloom on rice
[16:58.690 --> 17:00.250]  that boom, I got IMO.
[17:00.250 --> 17:02.930]  I mean, like, I mean, I can put it in my compost bucket
[17:02.930 --> 17:04.050]  and it'll do the same thing,
[17:04.930 --> 17:06.690]  but is it really indigenous microbes
[17:06.690 --> 17:08.090]  that are as strong as what you're gonna find out
[17:08.090 --> 17:09.010]  in the forest?
[17:09.010 --> 17:09.850]  Probably not.
[17:11.090 --> 17:13.010]  It's just what you already have in your system.
[17:13.010 --> 17:15.170]  So it's not, I don't know how much more
[17:15.170 --> 17:16.570]  it's really gonna do for you
[17:18.450 --> 17:21.730]  or finding somewhere down like at a street park, right?
[17:21.730 --> 17:24.290]  But at the same time, like who's around there,
[17:24.290 --> 17:27.290]  what interactions are happening, how disturbed is it?
[17:27.290 --> 17:28.650]  You know, things like that,
[17:28.650 --> 17:30.950]  like the diversity is gonna be pretty minimal.
[17:31.150 --> 17:34.510]  So I know during like the winter time and stuff like that,
[17:34.510 --> 17:35.910]  and I've talked to a couple of other farmers
[17:35.910 --> 17:38.030]  that have done stuff similar,
[17:38.030 --> 17:41.930]  where they'll kind of go out and find, you know,
[17:41.930 --> 17:46.930]  small amounts of forest material that has mycelium on it,
[17:48.070 --> 17:49.930]  some leaf duff and things like that.
[17:49.930 --> 17:51.070]  And we'll bring it inside.
[17:51.070 --> 17:54.590]  And I've done this, I don't have any pictures with me,
[17:54.590 --> 17:55.990]  but if you guys look through my Instagram,
[17:55.990 --> 17:59.070]  you guys will see a video where I did a collection,
[17:59.070 --> 18:03.990]  an indoor collection where I basically took a cardboard box
[18:03.990 --> 18:05.790]  that I got at my local grocery store
[18:05.790 --> 18:07.150]  that they were dumping from there,
[18:07.150 --> 18:08.670]  you know, set up from the restocking.
[18:08.670 --> 18:11.470]  And I basically laid, I created a fourth floor in a sense
[18:11.470 --> 18:15.330]  by putting the material that I got on the bottom,
[18:15.330 --> 18:18.030]  put my collection box on top of that,
[18:18.030 --> 18:20.510]  covered it with, or I got a couple of pieces of mycelium,
[18:20.510 --> 18:23.350]  laid it on top of the rice on the inside, covered it,
[18:23.350 --> 18:24.970]  put a little bit more duff on top
[18:24.970 --> 18:27.770]  and just let it sit there, let it rock for about a week.
[18:28.730 --> 18:30.330]  Put my hands right underneath it,
[18:30.330 --> 18:31.330]  started feeling some warmth,
[18:31.330 --> 18:33.330]  the microbes were basically cooking it.
[18:33.330 --> 18:34.770]  And I checked and opened it
[18:34.770 --> 18:37.050]  and that thing was just a solid brick.
[18:37.050 --> 18:39.010]  It basically looked like tempeh.
[18:40.350 --> 18:42.770]  So that's another piece too, is like when we look at it,
[18:42.770 --> 18:45.210]  you want it to be actually be stuck together.
[18:45.210 --> 18:46.390]  You can see little strands here,
[18:46.390 --> 18:47.690]  but it's a pretty weak collection.
[18:47.690 --> 18:50.250]  Like if you can pick it up and it just falls apart,
[18:51.990 --> 18:53.210]  the collection wasn't strong enough,
[18:53.210 --> 18:55.110]  may not be that strong, whether it was the microbes
[18:55.110 --> 18:56.830]  or maybe the way that you cook the rice
[18:56.830 --> 19:00.390]  and the way that it was essentially initially set up.
[19:00.390 --> 19:01.490]  But essentially that's what you want.
[19:01.490 --> 19:04.470]  You want it to be like essentially like a brick.
[19:04.470 --> 19:05.430]  So you can pull it out
[19:05.430 --> 19:07.630]  and it'll basically just hold itself together
[19:07.630 --> 19:08.470]  for the most part.
[19:08.470 --> 19:10.190]  I mean, granted, it might be heavy on one end
[19:10.190 --> 19:12.470]  and break off, but I think you guys get kind of the picture
[19:12.470 --> 19:13.470]  of what I'm trying to paint.
[19:13.470 --> 19:14.670]  Yeah, that's one thing.
[19:14.670 --> 19:17.090]  Man, one thing I noticed about that, Johnny too,
[19:17.090 --> 19:21.070]  is that has a lot to do with, I feel like,
[19:21.070 --> 19:24.110]  the collection, where I took the collection.
[19:24.150 --> 19:27.990]  Because some areas in three days on really warm weather,
[19:27.990 --> 19:31.070]  you can get a really thick mat of mycelium in that rice
[19:31.070 --> 19:32.310]  where it'll hold together.
[19:32.310 --> 19:35.710]  Some areas, same three days, same warm weather,
[19:35.710 --> 19:36.590]  you don't get that.
[19:36.590 --> 19:38.750]  So for me, that tells me,
[19:38.750 --> 19:43.330]  I just feel like that diversity of microbes in the soil
[19:43.330 --> 19:44.990]  wasn't as dense.
[19:44.990 --> 19:46.750]  So then in that same time period,
[19:46.750 --> 19:49.510]  they didn't grow as dense in my rice.
[19:49.510 --> 19:51.670]  Just my kind of analytical-
[19:51.670 --> 19:52.550]  That makes sense.
[19:52.550 --> 19:53.390]  That makes sense.
[19:53.390 --> 19:55.910]  I wonder if another piece of that could also be
[19:57.150 --> 20:00.790]  how the rice was cooked relative to the atmospheric
[20:00.790 --> 20:03.470]  temperature and humidity and things like that
[20:04.510 --> 20:07.510]  for that region to play, right?
[20:07.510 --> 20:09.750]  Because if it's a little drier, the rice may dry out.
[20:09.750 --> 20:11.510]  I've noticed that it doesn't stick as well,
[20:11.510 --> 20:14.250]  but if it's too wet, you just get a soggy mess
[20:14.250 --> 20:15.830]  and essentially you're just capturing
[20:15.830 --> 20:18.030]  a bunch of anaerobic bacteria in that thing.
[20:19.110 --> 20:21.710]  Yeah, there's definitely a Goldilocks way
[20:21.790 --> 20:23.390]  of kind of cooking that rice.
[20:23.390 --> 20:25.530]  I've always heard it through other mentors
[20:25.530 --> 20:27.790]  and people that I admire,
[20:27.790 --> 20:30.070]  that they say it's more of like an al dente.
[20:30.070 --> 20:32.630]  So however you kind of feel that for your environment.
[20:32.630 --> 20:34.310]  And you'll find more success that way,
[20:34.310 --> 20:38.310]  where if it is too wet, you're shooting yourself in the foot.
[20:38.310 --> 20:39.590]  Like driving out there and everything
[20:39.590 --> 20:40.630]  is not gonna be worth it.
[20:40.630 --> 20:42.750]  So knowing these little tips,
[20:42.750 --> 20:46.070]  then you know, like, okay, I'm gonna redo the rice
[20:46.070 --> 20:49.150]  and start over maybe in a day or two and drive out there,
[20:49.150 --> 20:51.510]  then just kind of rush through things.
[20:52.310 --> 20:53.870]  And that's what I feel like a lot of my peers,
[20:53.870 --> 20:55.310]  myself included, when we were first getting
[20:55.310 --> 20:57.030]  into a lot of this stuff is,
[20:57.030 --> 21:00.450]  we just didn't understand the full A to Z process.
[21:00.450 --> 21:02.830]  So those mistakes, it would just honestly,
[21:02.830 --> 21:03.830]  it would just piss you off.
[21:03.830 --> 21:05.150]  Cause it's like, man, I don't have time
[21:05.150 --> 21:06.670]  to fucking drive back and forth.
[21:06.670 --> 21:07.990]  Like you guys had just mentioned,
[21:07.990 --> 21:09.590]  some might happen in a couple of days
[21:09.590 --> 21:11.230]  where you go out there in a couple of days,
[21:11.230 --> 21:12.290]  you're hoping everything is there.
[21:12.290 --> 21:14.910]  Maybe one or two have actually taken foot
[21:14.910 --> 21:16.270]  or maybe zero have,
[21:16.270 --> 21:18.190]  or maybe all of a sudden you can't find half of them.
[21:18.190 --> 21:20.190]  And you're like, I swear I put it here, here.
[21:20.190 --> 21:23.150]  So there's just all of those little nuances.
[21:23.150 --> 21:24.270]  You know, if you've never done this,
[21:24.270 --> 21:25.830]  make a little checklist from today
[21:25.830 --> 21:27.590]  and kind of mentally check that off.
[21:27.590 --> 21:30.070]  Or if you need to write things, I like to write things down
[21:30.070 --> 21:31.990]  and then kind of just remember like, all right,
[21:31.990 --> 21:32.830]  how's my rice?
[21:32.830 --> 21:33.990]  Is that on point?
[21:33.990 --> 21:36.710]  You know, from a boxes standpoint,
[21:36.710 --> 21:38.670]  most people will go with cedar.
[21:38.670 --> 21:40.450]  The microbial world can't break that down.
[21:40.450 --> 21:42.150]  I wanted to kind of briefly talk about that.
[21:42.150 --> 21:45.190]  I know I've talked with you before, Johnny, about that.
[21:45.190 --> 21:46.910]  Marco and I have talked about that a few times,
[21:46.910 --> 21:48.230]  but from my understanding,
[21:48.230 --> 21:50.630]  we've had a lot different viewership today.
[21:50.630 --> 21:52.830]  So we want to kind of talk about that.
[21:52.830 --> 21:54.190]  You know, why cedar is important
[21:54.190 --> 21:56.950]  if you're looking for longevity with IMO collections.
[21:58.230 --> 22:00.030]  Yeah, I mean, like you can,
[22:00.030 --> 22:00.870]  like what Marco was saying too,
[22:00.870 --> 22:04.270]  it's like you can use a pizza box and you can use,
[22:04.270 --> 22:06.030]  I mean, I've seen people use like eight cartons
[22:06.030 --> 22:07.550]  and stuff like that,
[22:07.550 --> 22:10.750]  but it's a one shot, one shot and done, right?
[22:10.750 --> 22:12.690]  After you're done with that, you got to toss it.
[22:12.690 --> 22:13.830]  So for your next collection,
[22:13.830 --> 22:17.470]  you have to find another pizza box or another cardboard
[22:17.470 --> 22:18.790]  or whatever the case is.
[22:20.470 --> 22:21.870]  And me personally,
[22:21.870 --> 22:24.830]  I just try to minimize as many variables as I can.
[22:26.130 --> 22:28.190]  So that's why I went ahead
[22:28.190 --> 22:29.950]  and I just made myself a cedar box.
[22:29.950 --> 22:33.570]  Cause essentially, I don't know what it is about the cedar,
[22:33.570 --> 22:35.150]  but I think it releases some kind of oils
[22:35.150 --> 22:37.790]  or something that's antimicrobial in a sense,
[22:37.790 --> 22:40.210]  that it just essentially won't break down
[22:40.210 --> 22:41.430]  the same as if you were to,
[22:41.430 --> 22:42.830]  like you can make it out of a pallet, right?
[22:42.830 --> 22:44.990]  You can go get a pallet and set it up
[22:44.990 --> 22:47.710]  or use any kind of wood
[22:47.710 --> 22:49.110]  that you can get at a hardware store,
[22:49.110 --> 22:50.310]  just have laying around,
[22:50.310 --> 22:53.150]  but it might break down quicker over time.
[22:54.450 --> 22:57.150]  So really having something
[22:57.150 --> 22:59.190]  that is gonna give you the longevity,
[22:59.190 --> 23:00.670]  so you can continue to practice
[23:00.670 --> 23:02.790]  so that that variable is eliminated.
[23:02.790 --> 23:05.290]  So you can know it's like, okay, it's not my box.
[23:06.150 --> 23:08.270]  It may be my rice, it may be this, it may be that.
[23:08.270 --> 23:10.030]  So you can slowly start figuring out
[23:10.030 --> 23:11.870]  what that process looks like for you
[23:11.870 --> 23:14.630]  and what works in your environment.
[23:15.990 --> 23:19.950]  So that's my take on why I like having
[23:19.950 --> 23:21.030]  a cedar box personally,
[23:21.030 --> 23:22.950]  just because of the longevity of it.
[23:22.950 --> 23:24.510]  I can use it for years and years.
[23:24.510 --> 23:29.310]  And starting out, like you said, I gotta rewind,
[23:29.310 --> 23:31.210]  but starting out, like you said,
[23:31.210 --> 23:33.130]  I started out with the cedar box.
[23:33.130 --> 23:36.790]  And the biggest reason is the consistency
[23:36.790 --> 23:39.350]  because starting now, if you don't know
[23:39.350 --> 23:40.910]  that with the pizza box,
[23:40.910 --> 23:42.390]  you need to put a certain amount of holes
[23:42.390 --> 23:43.310]  or you need to do this.
[23:43.350 --> 23:44.190]  And with the cedar box,
[23:44.190 --> 23:45.270]  it just gives you a consistent
[23:45.270 --> 23:47.110]  every time you got the same box.
[23:47.110 --> 23:49.030]  That's a gold nugget with the collection.
[23:49.030 --> 23:52.150]  I like that, especially for folks just starting out.
[23:52.150 --> 23:54.150]  And a few things about cedar.
[23:55.150 --> 23:56.430]  I have cedar on my property
[23:56.430 --> 23:59.510]  and I've actually, my dad cut down a couple of trees.
[23:59.510 --> 24:01.150]  So we took those and I sliced them
[24:01.150 --> 24:02.670]  and made stepping stones
[24:02.670 --> 24:05.230]  because cedar has that longevity.
[24:05.230 --> 24:07.670]  And they've been down about three years
[24:07.670 --> 24:10.750]  and you can't use the word never.
[24:10.750 --> 24:12.970]  They do break down, but it's very slow.
[24:13.630 --> 24:15.690]  If I had oak, even one of the hardest oaks down
[24:15.690 --> 24:17.010]  for that same period of time,
[24:17.010 --> 24:19.570]  that oak I could probably bust it up by hand.
[24:19.570 --> 24:21.410]  So, and that cedar is still pretty tough.
[24:21.410 --> 24:23.450]  So cedar is very durable.
[24:23.450 --> 24:28.450]  Another wood that's very durable like that would be cypress.
[24:29.330 --> 24:31.210]  And look at your sources for some of these things.
[24:31.210 --> 24:34.650]  Some of these trees are more available than others.
[24:35.650 --> 24:38.410]  So yeah, a couple of trees with high oil content
[24:38.410 --> 24:39.810]  are the ones that are gonna be,
[24:39.810 --> 24:41.010]  have that anti-microbial.
[24:41.810 --> 24:44.210]  And if you live in the city
[24:44.210 --> 24:47.610]  and you live somewhere where you have a hardware store,
[24:47.610 --> 24:50.890]  I mean, cedar fencing is pretty damn cheap.
[24:52.090 --> 24:55.050]  Let's get a couple of six inch,
[24:55.050 --> 24:58.730]  I think they're like six inch wide fencing poles.
[24:58.730 --> 25:00.850]  And you could take one of those, two of those
[25:00.850 --> 25:03.890]  and just chop it up into like eight inch segments.
[25:03.890 --> 25:05.610]  And then just literally create yourself a box,
[25:05.610 --> 25:07.250]  take the little pieces, slice them in half
[25:07.250 --> 25:09.370]  and put them in the bottom and just screw them in,
[25:09.370 --> 25:12.090]  drill a couple of holes and boom, you're good to go.
[25:12.090 --> 25:13.210]  That's a simple box, right?
[25:13.210 --> 25:16.650]  Some people I've seen create like crazy boxes
[25:16.650 --> 25:18.570]  where like there's a lid with a screen on top
[25:18.570 --> 25:20.630]  that can lock and a bunch of stuff.
[25:21.810 --> 25:23.770]  But I'm not a carpenter by any means.
[25:23.770 --> 25:26.930]  So I just stick with the, yeah, that's the way I roll with it
[25:28.050 --> 25:29.130]  it's worked for me.
[25:29.130 --> 25:32.530]  That staple gun and just laying down like a little screen
[25:32.530 --> 25:36.010]  or even just like a white paper towel,
[25:36.050 --> 25:39.450]  just put on top and just pop a couple staples into it
[25:39.450 --> 25:40.650]  and have it hold in tight,
[25:40.650 --> 25:43.210]  put a screen on the tops and nothing falls in
[25:43.210 --> 25:44.810]  and you should be ready to rock.
[25:46.090 --> 25:48.890]  You can make a bunch of these over like half a weekend.
[25:48.890 --> 25:50.090]  You know, I mean, this isn't something
[25:50.090 --> 25:53.370]  that's super time consuming and again,
[25:53.370 --> 25:55.970]  well worth it once you get the skillset.
[25:57.090 --> 26:00.410]  Yeah, and Brian, something you mentioned earlier too
[26:00.410 --> 26:03.570]  is about dealing with park rangers and like going out far
[26:03.570 --> 26:07.130]  and putting out a couple of boxes and coming back
[26:07.130 --> 26:08.470]  and maybe they're all jacked up
[26:08.470 --> 26:11.490]  or whatever the case happened, put out more than one,
[26:11.490 --> 26:14.090]  do yourself a favor and put more than one box out.
[26:15.930 --> 26:17.910]  Also, if you're new at this
[26:17.910 --> 26:20.370]  and you're trying to look at this from a,
[26:22.490 --> 26:24.450]  almost kind of like a research perspective for yourself
[26:24.450 --> 26:25.850]  to figure out what works,
[26:25.850 --> 26:29.490]  cook different rices at different moistures,
[26:29.490 --> 26:31.890]  put them out and see which one works best
[26:31.890 --> 26:32.890]  in your environment.
[26:33.970 --> 26:35.510]  Like do one, because you can start
[26:35.510 --> 26:37.170]  with one to one rice to water,
[26:37.170 --> 26:39.330]  then maybe do one worth one cup of water
[26:39.330 --> 26:41.410]  and like half a cup of rice or I'm sorry,
[26:42.530 --> 26:44.450]  a cup of rice to like half a cup of water
[26:44.450 --> 26:46.090]  and play with those ratios
[26:46.090 --> 26:48.210]  and have a couple of different rices
[26:48.210 --> 26:50.570]  and just make sure you mark them, put them out
[26:50.570 --> 26:53.550]  and you know for sure one's probably gonna be too wet,
[26:53.550 --> 26:54.490]  one may be too dry,
[26:54.490 --> 26:57.250]  but you might try to find that Goldilocks effect in there
[26:57.250 --> 27:00.090]  and find one that kind of fits your environment.
[27:00.090 --> 27:01.990]  This is what I found at least when I was first starting out
[27:01.990 --> 27:04.950]  so that way I'd at least have a couple that were decent.
[27:06.510 --> 27:09.710]  Got a partial tinfoil hat question for you.
[27:09.710 --> 27:10.950]  When you're making the rice,
[27:10.950 --> 27:14.430]  do you feel like kind of speeding up the steps maybe
[27:14.430 --> 27:16.350]  and putting it in the microwave
[27:16.350 --> 27:18.630]  instead of actually boiling it on the stove?
[27:18.630 --> 27:21.630]  Do you feel like it's going to make a difference collecting?
[27:22.670 --> 27:23.590]  I'll be real with you man,
[27:23.590 --> 27:26.150]  I've never cooked rice on the stove ever in my life.
[27:27.990 --> 27:28.910]  Ever.
[27:28.910 --> 27:30.950]  I use a rice cooker man, I'm Hispanic.
[27:30.950 --> 27:33.270]  I grew up with rice as a staple in my household bro,
[27:33.270 --> 27:36.550]  like I needed that big amounts and a lot quick.
[27:36.550 --> 27:37.710]  From like a metaphysical thing,
[27:37.710 --> 27:38.710]  so maybe not a rice cooker,
[27:38.710 --> 27:40.310]  but do you think the microwave
[27:40.310 --> 27:44.270]  is going to potentially mess up your collections
[27:44.270 --> 27:46.870]  because of the way that the rice is cooked in that manner?
[27:46.870 --> 27:48.870]  I don't think so, I don't think so.
[27:48.870 --> 27:50.070]  And the reason I say that
[27:50.070 --> 27:51.690]  is I don't have any experience with that
[27:51.690 --> 27:56.690]  so this is also just based off of what my thought process is
[27:56.710 --> 27:57.910]  and what I've seen other people do.
[27:57.910 --> 28:01.990]  I mean, I've seen people culture mushrooms
[28:01.990 --> 28:06.910]  on like the Uncle John's like microwavable packs of rice.
[28:08.070 --> 28:10.230]  So it's like if someone can culture that,
[28:10.230 --> 28:12.790]  I mean, I'm sure taking out to,
[28:12.790 --> 28:16.090]  using that outside would probably work something similar.
[28:16.090 --> 28:18.190]  I probably wouldn't recommend using a bag like that
[28:18.190 --> 28:22.070]  for collecting IMO
[28:22.070 --> 28:25.050]  just because you can't control the moisture content.
[28:26.010 --> 28:29.650]  But I guess I personally don't think it makes a difference
[28:29.650 --> 28:31.410]  whether you're microwaving it or not.
[28:31.410 --> 28:32.570]  I think the most important piece
[28:32.570 --> 28:35.370]  is the consistency of the grain that you're putting out.
[28:36.650 --> 28:38.810]  Marco, kind of the same question, dude.
[28:38.810 --> 28:42.130]  Yeah, I think that the microbes are more,
[28:42.130 --> 28:44.010]  they just cared at that moisture
[28:44.010 --> 28:47.490]  and that food sources there when you put it out.
[28:47.490 --> 28:50.730]  I don't think the microwave does anything
[28:50.730 --> 28:53.930]  that leaves anything in it to where they don't want it.
[28:53.930 --> 28:55.570]  I don't think so.
[28:55.570 --> 28:57.130]  Kind of an interesting question though.
[28:57.130 --> 29:00.210]  I never really thought of that question,
[29:00.210 --> 29:01.130]  but if that's the case,
[29:01.130 --> 29:02.770]  then we also got to look at all the food
[29:02.770 --> 29:04.690]  we microwave for our bodies.
[29:04.690 --> 29:05.530]  So then-
[29:05.530 --> 29:08.290]  Well, they do look at that and it kills the nourishment.
[29:08.290 --> 29:10.690]  So I guess that's kind of where that thought process
[29:10.690 --> 29:13.730]  comes from, you know, but-
[29:13.730 --> 29:17.090]  Well, maybe, but I wouldn't think it would damage the starch
[29:17.090 --> 29:20.810]  to the point because even when you have a healthy collection,
[29:20.810 --> 29:22.570]  you still, it's not like that,
[29:22.570 --> 29:25.250]  the microbiology was able to eat all this food
[29:25.250 --> 29:26.210]  that's in that box.
[29:26.210 --> 29:30.250]  You know, there's still tons of starch in that rice.
[29:31.690 --> 29:34.610]  So, all right, let's, we went out, we got our collection,
[29:34.610 --> 29:36.930]  we feel like we got our rice dialed in,
[29:36.930 --> 29:39.050]  we got our cedar boxes made.
[29:39.050 --> 29:41.130]  We're going back to collect, see that collection.
[29:41.130 --> 29:43.930]  And when some boxes we see maybe a little bit
[29:43.930 --> 29:46.610]  of white fluffiness, some boxes we see blackness,
[29:46.610 --> 29:49.690]  some boxes we might see like a rainbow of color.
[29:49.690 --> 29:52.130]  Can you kind of explain what the new person is seeing
[29:52.690 --> 29:53.890]  when they're out there in the woods,
[29:53.890 --> 29:55.490]  seeing this for the first time?
[29:57.450 --> 30:02.170]  So, the different colors can be due
[30:02.170 --> 30:04.130]  to the different moisture content.
[30:05.770 --> 30:07.890]  If the rice was a little too wet,
[30:07.890 --> 30:10.770]  as the microbes are kind of cooking off or cooking,
[30:10.770 --> 30:13.090]  you know, everything and populating,
[30:13.090 --> 30:15.730]  they're gonna, you know, put out moisture into the air,
[30:15.730 --> 30:18.210]  which then could drop droplets onto the rice,
[30:19.350 --> 30:20.490]  which creates, you know,
[30:20.490 --> 30:22.490]  obviously different pockets of moisture.
[30:24.250 --> 30:26.890]  And you may start getting different colors of blooms.
[30:27.850 --> 30:30.610]  Ideally, what you're looking for is it to just be,
[30:30.610 --> 30:32.170]  at least from my experience and from the teachers
[30:32.170 --> 30:34.970]  that I've learned from, is we want it to just be white.
[30:36.490 --> 30:39.530]  The whole thing just basically looked like tempeh.
[30:39.530 --> 30:42.090]  If you look at the Jadam book, things like that,
[30:42.090 --> 30:44.570]  they'll talk about where it looks like a rainbow.
[30:45.890 --> 30:47.490]  So, it really just depends on the teacher
[30:47.490 --> 30:49.250]  that you're learning from,
[30:49.250 --> 30:53.210]  and what essentially what they're looking for.
[30:53.210 --> 30:56.370]  Sometimes we'll see black on the top.
[30:56.370 --> 30:58.330]  The realist, if you look at it closely,
[31:00.090 --> 31:02.450]  what that means is that you may have actually waited
[31:02.450 --> 31:05.930]  a day or two too long to pull your collection.
[31:05.930 --> 31:07.690]  Because what happens is the mycelium just starts
[31:07.690 --> 31:10.610]  to stack on itself and starts collapsing.
[31:10.610 --> 31:12.130]  And what you're seeing is just basically
[31:12.130 --> 31:13.890]  like the gnat of it all together,
[31:13.890 --> 31:16.250]  and it just looks a little bit darker in color.
[31:16.250 --> 31:17.810]  Or you might see little specks where it starts
[31:17.810 --> 31:19.610]  to sporulate and things like that.
[31:21.810 --> 31:24.050]  If I see a ton of different color,
[31:24.050 --> 31:26.890]  I probably personally wouldn't use it.
[31:26.890 --> 31:30.450]  I try to stay away from things like red.
[31:30.450 --> 31:31.930]  And if it's like a deep black,
[31:31.930 --> 31:33.090]  I try to stay away from that too.
[31:33.090 --> 31:35.450]  But typically if you think it looks black,
[31:35.450 --> 31:38.010]  look at it closely, and it's probably a really dark gray,
[31:38.010 --> 31:40.330]  or where the mycelium kind of started collapsing itself
[31:40.330 --> 31:41.370]  and things like that.
[31:42.610 --> 31:45.090]  But yeah, those are kind of my two cents on that.
[31:46.090 --> 31:46.930]  Marco?
[31:48.570 --> 31:49.410]  Oh, me?
[31:50.250 --> 31:51.650]  Yeah, man, I just kind of,
[31:52.890 --> 31:55.410]  I look at an IMO collection
[31:55.410 --> 31:58.410]  as I'm going to collect what is there.
[31:58.410 --> 32:02.930]  So a lot of it is gonna be on me as the collector
[32:02.930 --> 32:06.610]  to find a suitable spot that I feel like
[32:06.610 --> 32:07.890]  it's gonna be a good collection.
[32:07.890 --> 32:08.890]  You know what I mean?
[32:09.810 --> 32:12.610]  When I collect, there may be some colors in there.
[32:12.610 --> 32:14.970]  I'm not gonna throw a box of colors in there.
[32:15.810 --> 32:17.810]  I'm gonna throw the box out because it has colors in it.
[32:17.810 --> 32:20.930]  And just anecdotally, myself and some other folks
[32:20.930 --> 32:23.970]  that have reached out in my region
[32:23.970 --> 32:26.730]  have noticed that in the cooler temps,
[32:26.730 --> 32:29.650]  like around October, November,
[32:29.650 --> 32:31.810]  collections were having a lot more red in them.
[32:31.810 --> 32:32.970]  You know what I mean?
[32:32.970 --> 32:37.210]  I don't, I'm not gonna try to classify microbes in the soil
[32:37.210 --> 32:39.050]  because scientists can't even do that.
[32:39.050 --> 32:43.690]  So my approach is if the box didn't go all the way blacked
[32:43.690 --> 32:48.690]  out to spore, if it doesn't, if it isn't a majority colors
[32:51.490 --> 32:55.290]  and another thing, it has to be a full sheet.
[32:55.290 --> 32:57.690]  Like it has to pull out and I gotta be able to hold this
[32:57.690 --> 32:58.530]  thing in chunks.
[32:58.530 --> 33:01.090]  That means all my fungi is in there.
[33:01.090 --> 33:03.050]  And I got plenty of webbing in there
[33:03.050 --> 33:04.610]  because the bacteria aren't gonna necessarily
[33:04.610 --> 33:05.450]  hold it together.
[33:05.450 --> 33:07.050]  That's gonna tell me the fungi is in there.
[33:07.050 --> 33:11.370]  So if I see fungi holding it together, a few colors
[33:11.370 --> 33:16.370]  but not a majority of the sheet of the rice being colors
[33:16.530 --> 33:19.250]  and it's not blacked out, then I'll usually keep that.
[33:19.250 --> 33:22.730]  You know, I've had collections that were a lot heavy green.
[33:22.730 --> 33:26.130]  You know, that ended up being a nice trichoderma collection
[33:26.130 --> 33:29.970]  that I collected the same way labeled it trichoderma IMO.
[33:29.970 --> 33:31.690]  And now that's one of my IMOs.
[33:31.690 --> 33:32.530]  You know what I mean?
[33:32.530 --> 33:34.010]  So I don't know.
[33:34.010 --> 33:36.650]  I look forward as more, I collected what was there.
[33:36.650 --> 33:39.430]  If I went to a healthy place and I collected,
[33:39.470 --> 33:42.190]  then I'm gonna be, I'm actually kind of proud
[33:42.190 --> 33:43.870]  of what I collected because I said, okay,
[33:43.870 --> 33:44.710]  I got what was there.
[33:44.710 --> 33:45.950]  I did the right process.
[33:45.950 --> 33:46.950]  I didn't wait too long.
[33:46.950 --> 33:49.430]  I felt like my rice was good.
[33:49.430 --> 33:50.450]  You know, those kinds of things.
[33:50.450 --> 33:52.270]  It's a lot of checklist to it for me.
[33:52.270 --> 33:55.990]  Cause it's not just boom, did it now colors, is that okay?
[33:55.990 --> 33:57.990]  You know, I got to kind of know the process,
[33:57.990 --> 33:58.810]  you know what I mean?
[33:58.810 --> 34:01.870]  So just some things that I look at, but yeah,
[34:01.870 --> 34:04.110]  I've had, I get collections that are a hundred percent
[34:04.110 --> 34:06.390]  white fluffy and I like them,
[34:06.390 --> 34:08.790]  but I also like the ones that I get that are
[34:08.790 --> 34:11.070]  somewhat diverse, you know, but that's just me, man.
[34:11.070 --> 34:13.390]  I could have a lot of different IMO collections
[34:13.390 --> 34:15.950]  and it just seems like it works, man.
[34:15.950 --> 34:17.470]  Just that diversity.
[34:18.510 --> 34:19.590]  Yeah, that diversity.
[34:19.590 --> 34:22.030]  And it seems like some people,
[34:22.030 --> 34:24.670]  maybe there's two camps on this where some are saying
[34:24.670 --> 34:27.750]  like white fluffy, more like cotton candy.
[34:27.750 --> 34:30.390]  Some of I even heard is kind of like the rainbow death.
[34:30.390 --> 34:33.590]  When you peek in, they viewed it as that was a failure.
[34:33.590 --> 34:36.230]  So it's interesting to hear you guys talk about,
[34:36.230 --> 34:38.030]  you know, a variety of different collections.
[34:38.150 --> 34:40.390]  What do you guys consider a failure?
[34:40.390 --> 34:42.490]  And I guess you kind of already spoke mostly
[34:42.490 --> 34:46.910]  on what you view as success, but is it,
[34:46.910 --> 34:49.310]  are you able to say like, all right, I went out there,
[34:49.310 --> 34:50.830]  this one's looking like a failure,
[34:50.830 --> 34:53.630]  so I should just cut my losses then with that one?
[34:53.630 --> 34:56.590]  Or do you allow them to maybe take a couple of days
[34:56.590 --> 34:58.430]  or maybe if it's not too far, you know,
[34:58.430 --> 35:01.570]  you check it out, check out on the boxes every day.
[35:04.770 --> 35:06.270]  So I try not to peek.
[35:07.270 --> 35:11.270]  I try to like just leave it alone until I'm ready.
[35:11.270 --> 35:14.690]  So I pull it and I pull it, I pull it.
[35:14.690 --> 35:17.550]  But I wanted to comment on something that Marco had said
[35:17.550 --> 35:18.970]  about the different colors in it.
[35:18.970 --> 35:21.550]  Yeah, you bring up a really good point.
[35:21.550 --> 35:23.990]  Like if I see a couple of colors here and there,
[35:23.990 --> 35:25.870]  like it is what it is, right?
[35:25.870 --> 35:28.230]  But the majority of it to me is white.
[35:28.230 --> 35:29.790]  But if I see, if I pick up a collection,
[35:29.790 --> 35:32.270]  it's like solid yellow or solid green
[35:32.270 --> 35:34.270]  or solid another color.
[35:34.270 --> 35:35.630]  Personally, I probably wouldn't use that
[35:35.990 --> 35:37.630]  because that, you know, one or two microbes
[35:37.630 --> 35:39.390]  probably dominated the whole thing.
[35:41.190 --> 35:42.910]  But yeah, that's a really good point, man.
[35:42.910 --> 35:45.470]  Yeah, so I second that.
[35:46.550 --> 35:48.470]  In regards to a failure, what you were saying,
[35:48.470 --> 35:51.370]  it's like if it's soggy, don't use it.
[35:54.450 --> 35:57.550]  Another good way to kind of check to see if it's cooking
[35:57.550 --> 35:59.670]  is put your hands underneath it.
[35:59.670 --> 36:01.750]  Like if you put your box on the ground,
[36:02.710 --> 36:06.190]  there's so much microbial activity that's going on
[36:06.190 --> 36:07.970]  between the soil and that rice.
[36:07.970 --> 36:09.350]  It's like a compost pile, right?
[36:09.350 --> 36:12.990]  Like people heat it up to 140, 50 degrees, whatever it is.
[36:12.990 --> 36:15.310]  And essentially it starts letting off
[36:15.310 --> 36:17.350]  all this different steam and you can see this heat
[36:17.350 --> 36:18.550]  that's coming off of it.
[36:19.790 --> 36:22.350]  IMO collections to me are very similar.
[36:22.350 --> 36:25.870]  You can slide your hand right underneath the box
[36:25.870 --> 36:27.350]  and it'll be hot.
[36:27.350 --> 36:29.790]  If it's hot, it means it's cooking,
[36:29.790 --> 36:31.190]  which means that things are there
[36:31.590 --> 36:32.410]  and you're in the right zone.
[36:32.410 --> 36:34.670]  You can probably start thinking about pulling it.
[36:34.670 --> 36:39.310]  If it's cold, it probably didn't colonize.
[36:39.310 --> 36:41.710]  It's not active enough, which means that when you pick it up
[36:41.710 --> 36:43.270]  the rice is just gonna fall apart.
[36:43.270 --> 36:46.030]  Just something to kind of think about
[36:46.030 --> 36:48.150]  instead of opening up the cover and peeking in it
[36:48.150 --> 36:49.510]  because then the light might degrade
[36:49.510 --> 36:51.990]  what's happening inside, stuff might fall in,
[36:51.990 --> 36:54.670]  whatever the case is, you have to undo the entire thing,
[36:54.670 --> 36:56.670]  especially if you hit it, right?
[36:56.670 --> 36:59.470]  If you're out in the forest and you buried this damn box
[36:59.470 --> 37:01.190]  underneath a log and leaves and all that,
[37:01.190 --> 37:02.270]  like it's gonna be really hard
[37:02.270 --> 37:04.150]  to kind of peek it open and check.
[37:04.150 --> 37:06.830]  Just find your hand, put your hand underneath it,
[37:06.830 --> 37:08.150]  feel what it looks like underneath.
[37:08.150 --> 37:09.470]  If it's nice and warm, then cool.
[37:09.470 --> 37:10.990]  I can consider pulling this.
[37:10.990 --> 37:13.390]  If it's cold, you probably need to wait a little longer
[37:13.390 --> 37:15.750]  or yeah, I'd probably just wait.
[37:15.750 --> 37:18.070]  And then if a couple of days later it doesn't heat up,
[37:18.070 --> 37:19.830]  I'd probably start again or check it, pull it
[37:19.830 --> 37:22.390]  and see what happens, but it's probably gonna fall apart.
[37:22.390 --> 37:23.550]  That's valid, man.
[37:23.550 --> 37:26.510]  I kind of forgot that it is warm when you reach in there
[37:26.510 --> 37:28.550]  and you slide your hand under to pull it out
[37:28.630 --> 37:30.070]  and show it off, it is warm
[37:30.070 --> 37:32.590]  and you do get that warm sensation.
[37:32.590 --> 37:34.430]  Great point with that.
[37:34.430 --> 37:38.230]  For me, I know that in my area,
[37:38.230 --> 37:40.310]  when the temperatures are 80 and up,
[37:40.310 --> 37:44.350]  like when it's like May, June on down through summer,
[37:44.350 --> 37:46.150]  three days is a sweet spot here.
[37:46.150 --> 37:49.190]  Like in my process, I put my box out,
[37:49.190 --> 37:52.390]  I take a Rubbermaid tote over top of the box
[37:52.390 --> 37:55.870]  and then cover all that to make a little microclimate
[37:55.870 --> 37:59.670]  in there with no wind and no breeze blowing around,
[37:59.670 --> 38:03.230]  only the microbiology can kind of move up.
[38:03.230 --> 38:06.270]  But yeah, three days, man, seems like a sweet spot.
[38:06.270 --> 38:09.550]  And then when it gets cool, five,
[38:09.550 --> 38:12.350]  and then it can get even farther than that, 10.
[38:12.350 --> 38:15.430]  But it's tough when it gets over like 10 days
[38:15.430 --> 38:17.950]  because then you're gonna get colors.
[38:17.950 --> 38:20.870]  Like it's gonna be hard to get a full white
[38:20.870 --> 38:22.830]  waiting that long in the cool temps.
[38:22.830 --> 38:24.430]  So you're gonna get some colors.
[38:24.430 --> 38:26.830]  And guys, there's nothing wrong with taking a collection.
[38:26.830 --> 38:29.630]  If you, in your personal philosophy,
[38:29.630 --> 38:30.990]  you don't wanna do the colors
[38:30.990 --> 38:33.270]  and you've heard too much difference,
[38:33.270 --> 38:34.670]  pull that piece out.
[38:34.670 --> 38:37.990]  It's all right to take this rice collection and cut it up,
[38:37.990 --> 38:39.750]  discard parts that you don't want.
[38:39.750 --> 38:43.270]  If you only wanna take that nice white part fluffy,
[38:43.270 --> 38:44.430]  and that's good.
[38:44.430 --> 38:45.250]  You know what I mean?
[38:45.250 --> 38:46.090]  It's all good practice.
[38:46.090 --> 38:48.230]  But usually, like Johnny was saying,
[38:48.230 --> 38:51.750]  in a collection, there'll be something good in there usually.
[38:51.750 --> 38:54.670]  And the indicators, like we said, it's sticking together.
[38:54.670 --> 38:57.750]  It's webbing, it's thick, and that warm temperature.
[38:57.750 --> 38:58.790]  And it gets a little smell.
[38:58.790 --> 39:01.110]  It's like not as yeasty,
[39:01.110 --> 39:04.030]  it's not as nice as like a IMO 3 pile,
[39:04.030 --> 39:06.990]  but it does have its own little kind of IMO-ish,
[39:06.990 --> 39:09.630]  bready kind of smell to it too.
[39:09.630 --> 39:11.630]  Yeah, I love that smell, man.
[39:11.630 --> 39:14.310]  It's just, it's kind of grown on me over the years.
[39:14.310 --> 39:15.150]  Exactly.
[39:15.150 --> 39:16.950]  It's like this, just, I don't even know how to describe it.
[39:16.950 --> 39:19.670]  Just, it just smells like fermented rice,
[39:19.670 --> 39:21.110]  essentially, in a sense.
[39:21.430 --> 39:22.870]  And then some of the old ones, when they're,
[39:22.870 --> 39:24.630]  you know, the IMO 2s that I have,
[39:24.630 --> 39:25.710]  they're just kind of aged.
[39:25.710 --> 39:26.870]  And when you smell them,
[39:26.870 --> 39:29.030]  they've got all that sugar in the rice and the microbes.
[39:29.030 --> 39:30.830]  I mean, that's just a really unique smell.
[39:30.830 --> 39:33.030]  You get all kinds of different.
[39:33.030 --> 39:35.470]  Yeah, I pulled out some of my collections with me too,
[39:35.470 --> 39:36.950]  and I was just smelling them earlier.
[39:36.950 --> 39:38.870]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[39:38.870 --> 39:40.670]  And it's interesting that you said in your climate,
[39:40.670 --> 39:42.230]  it's, this is what I tell people too.
[39:42.230 --> 39:43.550]  It's like, it's different every climate.
[39:43.550 --> 39:44.990]  Like, right, how we started.
[39:44.990 --> 39:47.550]  Mark, you said in yours, it's what, three days or so?
[39:47.550 --> 39:48.870]  And you can pull a box.
[39:48.870 --> 39:50.830]  For me, I have to run at least five.
[39:51.550 --> 39:53.510]  Yeah, but see, what your thing is,
[39:53.510 --> 39:55.990]  is your humidity being that much lower, I think.
[39:55.990 --> 39:59.430]  And do you cover over top with the Rubbermaid Tote,
[39:59.430 --> 40:02.190]  or are you just going straight out there, box?
[40:03.630 --> 40:06.390]  I usually drop like burlap over the top.
[40:06.390 --> 40:07.270]  Okay, keep it up.
[40:07.270 --> 40:09.110]  Keep the humidity up a little bit in there.
[40:09.110 --> 40:13.830]  Yeah, I don't, I, if I'm, it's just, it's difficult for me.
[40:13.830 --> 40:14.910]  If I'm going somewhere, like,
[40:14.910 --> 40:16.670]  I'm gonna stick out like a sore thumb
[40:16.670 --> 40:18.230]  if I have a backpack with a bucket
[40:18.230 --> 40:20.430]  and like a tote on my back.
[40:21.030 --> 40:21.950]  And all this stuff to go out into nature.
[40:21.950 --> 40:23.590]  So like for me, if it doesn't fit in a backpack,
[40:23.590 --> 40:24.430]  I'm not bringing it.
[40:24.430 --> 40:27.430]  I'm trying to just like try to be as low-key as I can.
[40:27.430 --> 40:28.630]  I'm not trying to have those interactions
[40:28.630 --> 40:30.110]  with park rangers if I don't need to.
[40:30.110 --> 40:31.430]  Gorilla style.
[40:31.430 --> 40:33.310]  That's why we always say on this show too,
[40:33.310 --> 40:34.270]  it's always key, man.
[40:34.270 --> 40:36.910]  Keep it working and let's get, own your own property.
[40:36.910 --> 40:39.110]  That way you're the fucking park ranger.
[40:39.110 --> 40:40.390]  You make the rules.
[40:40.390 --> 40:42.430]  Absolutely, that's the goal at some point.
[40:42.430 --> 40:44.110]  That is gold bars for days.
[40:44.110 --> 40:45.870]  Cause then you can just control everything.
[40:45.870 --> 40:47.870]  You know what's going on.
[40:47.870 --> 40:48.830]  Cause you just never know
[40:48.830 --> 40:50.270]  when there's enough people in the woods,
[40:51.110 --> 40:51.950]  what potentially could have been there.
[40:51.950 --> 40:54.750]  So to do this successful, at least in Denver,
[40:54.750 --> 40:55.990]  we had to go deep.
[40:55.990 --> 40:57.470]  I mean, you're talking like you mentioned,
[40:57.470 --> 41:01.510]  maybe an hour or two to get where confidently,
[41:01.510 --> 41:03.990]  you know that there's nobody really messing
[41:03.990 --> 41:07.590]  with this part of land other than park rangers, I guess.
[41:07.590 --> 41:11.510]  Yeah, I did see a question that came up in the chat.
[41:11.510 --> 41:15.790]  Someone asked me about putting like wood
[41:15.790 --> 41:18.230]  or my ceiling into the rice.
[41:18.230 --> 41:20.150]  And I would, I take,
[41:20.150 --> 41:23.110]  if I have like really thick fungal hyphae that I found,
[41:23.110 --> 41:24.990]  like on a, like in that area,
[41:24.990 --> 41:26.750]  like I'll take a couple of them
[41:26.750 --> 41:28.310]  and lay them on top of the rice
[41:28.310 --> 41:29.630]  to kind of give it a quick start.
[41:29.630 --> 41:30.870]  So that way it'll eat from the bottom
[41:30.870 --> 41:31.950]  and eat from the top.
[41:33.670 --> 41:36.350]  That's something that I have found helpful.
[41:36.350 --> 41:37.190]  So.
[41:38.430 --> 41:39.470]  Yeah, that's good practice.
[41:39.470 --> 41:40.310]  All that's good.
[41:40.310 --> 41:42.150]  And that's, that's, that comes with experience
[41:42.150 --> 41:44.630]  knowing that you grabbed a piece of my ceiling,
[41:44.630 --> 41:46.430]  not a piece of root, you know,
[41:46.470 --> 41:49.070]  and just understanding and knowing what you, what you got.
[41:49.070 --> 41:51.710]  And that's why it's always good to grab you a buddy
[41:51.710 --> 41:52.550]  or a mentor.
[41:52.550 --> 41:53.950]  You guys are in San Diego.
[41:53.950 --> 41:54.950]  I'm not going to speak for you,
[41:54.950 --> 41:58.030]  but if you're in Richmond or Petersburg, Virginia,
[41:58.030 --> 41:58.870]  hit me up.
[41:58.870 --> 42:01.310]  I can, you know, help you out, man.
[42:01.310 --> 42:03.030]  It's good to have a mentor or a person
[42:03.030 --> 42:05.550]  that can at least put eyes on some of this stuff.
[42:05.550 --> 42:07.190]  And as the Earth Bro was saying,
[42:07.190 --> 42:11.270]  shout out the Earth Bro with the dope fungi t-shirt.
[42:11.270 --> 42:16.070]  Is he saying even, even smelling your JLFs and things like,
[42:16.710 --> 42:17.550]  hey buddy, what do you think, man?
[42:17.550 --> 42:18.630]  Does this thing smell okay?
[42:18.630 --> 42:20.070]  Yeah, man, I think it smells good
[42:20.070 --> 42:23.950]  because a lot of these funks to a, a funk noob,
[42:23.950 --> 42:24.790]  you know what I mean?
[42:24.790 --> 42:27.770]  Someone that's not embracing that funk as much.
[42:27.770 --> 42:29.670]  Some of these funks are questionable.
[42:30.950 --> 42:34.350]  So, you know, just getting it, getting it a little bit of,
[42:35.590 --> 42:37.630]  you know, someone to help guide you on these things
[42:37.630 --> 42:38.590]  is always easier.
[42:39.550 --> 42:43.110]  What do you guys think should be done with wasted samples,
[42:43.110 --> 42:44.030]  failed samples?
[42:44.030 --> 42:46.430]  Can you just put that in the vermicompost,
[42:46.430 --> 42:48.550]  compost bin or, yeah.
[42:48.550 --> 42:50.330]  I would, yeah, compost it.
[42:51.470 --> 42:54.110]  Compost it, compost it or put it into,
[42:55.030 --> 42:56.950]  into your worm bin, things like that.
[42:56.950 --> 42:59.190]  I mean, yeah, whatever is bad,
[42:59.190 --> 43:00.750]  that's the way it is, it'll probably get taken out
[43:00.750 --> 43:03.310]  or you can throw it into a JLF, yeah.
[43:03.310 --> 43:05.950]  Use this like microbial stuff or something.
[43:05.950 --> 43:07.950]  I wouldn't just toss it, like don't throw it in the trash.
[43:07.950 --> 43:08.790]  Right. Right.
[43:08.790 --> 43:10.550]  We want to try to minimize any kind of food waste
[43:10.550 --> 43:12.430]  as possible, so if anything,
[43:12.430 --> 43:13.870]  it's like you had a spoiled banana
[43:13.870 --> 43:15.830]  or spoiled piece of fruit, you know,
[43:15.830 --> 43:17.030]  put it actually in your compost bin
[43:17.030 --> 43:19.750]  and let the microbes have at it.
[43:20.670 --> 43:22.510]  Do you guys co-sign that it's worth
[43:22.510 --> 43:24.430]  collecting four samples a year?
[43:26.150 --> 43:28.710]  More at least if you need to, I mean more.
[43:28.710 --> 43:29.910]  Yeah.
[43:29.910 --> 43:31.070]  But at least bare bounds,
[43:31.070 --> 43:32.910]  you want to go each season out there
[43:32.910 --> 43:36.390]  and collect your stuff and start to build a,
[43:36.390 --> 43:38.270]  you know, hoard it up.
[43:38.270 --> 43:40.830]  These are wonderful things to hoard
[43:40.830 --> 43:42.870]  and kind of build up from year to year.
[43:42.870 --> 43:46.510]  Yeah, I would say, I mean, winter collections are tough.
[43:46.510 --> 43:49.470]  I was visiting a farm out in Colorado
[43:49.470 --> 43:51.310]  and just hearing them how they were doing
[43:51.310 --> 43:52.990]  their winter collections.
[43:53.910 --> 43:54.990]  I mean, you have to adapt, right?
[43:54.990 --> 43:57.710]  You can't go put them out there
[43:57.710 --> 43:58.990]  because I mean, they might get covered in snow
[43:58.990 --> 44:00.910]  for you guys in Colorado.
[44:00.910 --> 44:02.910]  So I don't get snow where I'm at.
[44:02.910 --> 44:04.790]  I don't really even get a frost,
[44:04.790 --> 44:06.710]  at least where I'm at in the mountains we do.
[44:06.710 --> 44:08.230]  So like I'll typically bring,
[44:08.230 --> 44:09.670]  that's when I'll typically try to really do
[44:09.710 --> 44:12.590]  my indoor collections if I make my way out to the mountains
[44:12.590 --> 44:15.270]  during the winter time to bring some stuff in
[44:15.270 --> 44:17.030]  and do it that way.
[44:17.030 --> 44:18.670]  But that way you can have the diversity
[44:18.670 --> 44:20.950]  from the microbes that are thriving during the summer,
[44:20.950 --> 44:23.230]  microbes that are thriving during the spring, the fall,
[44:23.230 --> 44:25.150]  and then also the ones that are cold tolerant as well.
[44:25.150 --> 44:27.350]  So if your area doesn't end up getting a frost,
[44:27.350 --> 44:28.870]  you at least have some kind of microbes
[44:28.870 --> 44:31.470]  that are able to thrive in that environment.
[44:31.470 --> 44:33.030]  And how cold tolerant are they?
[44:33.030 --> 44:35.510]  Like in Denver right now, it was negative eight,
[44:35.510 --> 44:36.910]  I think when I woke up this morning,
[44:36.910 --> 44:39.590]  like we have these like super freezes every now and then.
[44:40.430 --> 44:41.890]  So if I had samples out there,
[44:43.190 --> 44:45.230]  is that gonna potentially be a lost cause
[44:45.230 --> 44:46.670]  or because it's so cold,
[44:46.670 --> 44:49.950]  do you now wait a day or two and then go out and collect?
[44:49.950 --> 44:52.110]  I think it would take a lot longer.
[44:52.110 --> 44:54.070]  This is just from experience.
[44:54.070 --> 44:55.830]  I don't have much experience when it comes
[44:55.830 --> 44:58.310]  to doing big winter collections and things like that,
[44:58.310 --> 45:00.150]  just given where I live in my region.
[45:01.590 --> 45:04.670]  But I mean, it's like with anything, right?
[45:04.670 --> 45:07.230]  The temperature is gonna speed things up.
[45:07.230 --> 45:09.150]  Like Marco saying, when it's hot and humid
[45:09.710 --> 45:10.670]  in his environment, three days,
[45:10.670 --> 45:12.630]  me in my environment's five days.
[45:12.630 --> 45:14.990]  My guess is that it'd probably take a lot longer
[45:16.590 --> 45:19.270]  to run an IMO collection during the wintertime
[45:19.270 --> 45:21.430]  if you're doing it outside that environment.
[45:21.430 --> 45:23.670]  But you could always bring some stuff inside,
[45:23.670 --> 45:26.310]  put it in your garage, on a shelf or on the floor
[45:26.310 --> 45:29.990]  or something like that and run it that way if you needed to.
[45:29.990 --> 45:31.830]  Yeah, the cool thing about,
[45:31.830 --> 45:34.470]  thankfully microbes can survive.
[45:34.470 --> 45:37.150]  If they couldn't, then our forest would die every winter.
[45:37.150 --> 45:37.990]  You know what I mean?
[45:37.990 --> 45:39.110]  So that's awesome.
[45:39.950 --> 45:40.950]  But yeah, man, it's gonna be tough going
[45:40.950 --> 45:42.350]  when it's stuff's frozen.
[45:42.350 --> 45:44.750]  There ain't shit happening out there.
[45:44.750 --> 45:48.790]  But one thing that I think is pretty cool practice,
[45:48.790 --> 45:50.430]  if you can do it sustainably,
[45:50.430 --> 45:53.110]  I'm not telling you go out on public lands,
[45:53.110 --> 45:54.590]  if you have your own property,
[45:54.590 --> 45:55.910]  but go onto your own property,
[45:55.910 --> 45:57.990]  if you have a tree or if you can get some
[45:57.990 --> 45:59.470]  and dig down in the wintertime
[45:59.470 --> 46:01.870]  when the ground is really, really cold,
[46:01.870 --> 46:04.510]  bring that indoors, put that in your cooler
[46:04.510 --> 46:05.350]  or whatever you're gonna do
[46:05.350 --> 46:07.350]  and then do an indoor collection on that.
[46:07.350 --> 46:08.190]  You know what I mean?
[46:08.910 --> 46:12.030]  Those microbes are gonna be pretty much dormant.
[46:12.030 --> 46:15.550]  They should wake up when they warm up and you're indoors
[46:15.550 --> 46:18.070]  and then now collect on that and just see what happens.
[46:18.070 --> 46:20.110]  You know, those are kind of experiments I like to do,
[46:20.110 --> 46:21.350]  especially in wintertime.
[46:22.950 --> 46:25.710]  And in your opinion, Marco,
[46:25.710 --> 46:27.550]  it's worth doing the winter collection.
[46:27.550 --> 46:29.070]  It's kind of the worst one, I guess,
[46:29.070 --> 46:32.030]  to do is because you're getting the Debo microbes
[46:32.030 --> 46:34.590]  that are going to really kind of take over
[46:34.590 --> 46:36.110]  and build that diversity
[46:36.150 --> 46:38.390]  because they're over there just running things.
[46:38.390 --> 46:39.470]  Yeah, exactly.
[46:39.470 --> 46:41.150]  They're tough.
[46:41.150 --> 46:43.270]  If you come out, wake up out of winter
[46:43.270 --> 46:45.270]  and start talking shit, you're tough.
[46:45.270 --> 46:46.110]  You know what I mean?
[46:46.110 --> 46:47.910]  So that's how I look at that.
[46:47.910 --> 46:48.750]  You know what I mean?
[46:48.750 --> 46:50.350]  They're just like, they're guys.
[46:50.350 --> 46:52.070]  You know, microbes are some weak ones.
[46:52.070 --> 46:54.430]  That don't mean they're not valuable to us,
[46:55.590 --> 46:56.750]  but there's some tough ones too,
[46:56.750 --> 46:59.550]  but they're probably more valuable when times are tough.
[46:59.550 --> 47:01.510]  You know, that saying about the tough guys
[47:01.510 --> 47:04.830]  make it to easy times and all that kind of stuff.
[47:04.830 --> 47:07.590]  I ain't gonna try to spit that back out,
[47:07.590 --> 47:10.550]  but I think I heard it like Joe Rogan or somebody say it
[47:10.550 --> 47:12.310]  or one of these other podcasters,
[47:12.310 --> 47:14.350]  but you know, like tough guys are what you want
[47:14.350 --> 47:16.630]  because tough guys are gonna get in your soil
[47:16.630 --> 47:17.790]  and make things easy.
[47:17.790 --> 47:20.270]  They're gonna make things, the environment smooth.
[47:20.270 --> 47:21.190]  You know what I mean?
[47:21.190 --> 47:23.110]  If you have too many weak guys,
[47:23.110 --> 47:24.750]  it's just like being at a party.
[47:24.750 --> 47:26.030]  You know, for some reason,
[47:26.030 --> 47:27.390]  something always starts happening
[47:27.390 --> 47:29.070]  when there's too much weakness.
[47:29.070 --> 47:29.910]  You know what I mean?
[47:29.910 --> 47:31.630]  You get enough, you get two or three big,
[47:31.630 --> 47:33.750]  strong alpha corners in there
[47:33.750 --> 47:35.470]  and it kind of just smooths everything out.
[47:35.470 --> 47:37.110]  Maybe there's tension.
[47:37.110 --> 47:38.470]  There's nothing wrong with tension,
[47:38.470 --> 47:40.430]  but things kind of stay in control.
[47:40.430 --> 47:42.350]  So I kind of look at the microbes like that, man.
[47:42.350 --> 47:46.670]  And it just kind of, just a mindset that I have,
[47:46.670 --> 47:50.310]  the way I equate them with real life situations.
[47:52.190 --> 47:55.430]  So it sounds like as in all things in life,
[47:55.430 --> 47:58.710]  sometimes the things that are kind of the hardest to do
[47:58.710 --> 47:59.950]  is worth the effort
[47:59.950 --> 48:02.030]  because you're gonna be able to get that diversity
[48:02.110 --> 48:04.070]  that you're not necessarily gonna have
[48:04.070 --> 48:05.190]  in your indoor environment.
[48:05.190 --> 48:06.190]  So you're going out of your way
[48:06.190 --> 48:09.830]  to continue to build those diverse communities.
[48:09.830 --> 48:11.710]  And then when things start to pop off
[48:11.710 --> 48:15.270]  and you got your winter collection to put in there,
[48:15.270 --> 48:16.870]  it does seem like more and more farmers
[48:16.870 --> 48:18.190]  are starting to understand this again
[48:18.190 --> 48:19.630]  from an A to Z perspective.
[48:19.630 --> 48:22.270]  So they're also using that as preventative maintenance,
[48:22.270 --> 48:24.310]  being proactive.
[48:24.310 --> 48:26.590]  Are there other things that you guys think
[48:26.590 --> 48:28.830]  adding some lab and adding some IMOs,
[48:28.830 --> 48:30.350]  do you think that could turn around?
[48:30.990 --> 48:32.870]  Let's say some things went anaerobic.
[48:32.870 --> 48:35.630]  Somebody's starting this off, tried to keep it cheap
[48:35.630 --> 48:37.950]  and we're growing in a Home Depot buckets
[48:37.950 --> 48:39.190]  or something like that, right?
[48:39.190 --> 48:40.590]  It's gone anaerobic.
[48:40.590 --> 48:42.750]  Do you guys feel like someone could turn that around
[48:42.750 --> 48:44.310]  in a short amount of time?
[48:44.310 --> 48:47.950]  Or do you building this utopia,
[48:47.950 --> 48:52.190]  you guys should just focus on maybe restarting at that point?
[48:52.190 --> 48:53.350]  I hope that made sense.
[48:54.470 --> 48:55.510]  I think it does.
[48:57.350 --> 48:58.630]  I feel like there's a lot of factors
[48:58.630 --> 49:01.150]  that could go into that of why it went anaerobic
[49:01.150 --> 49:03.110]  in the first place.
[49:03.110 --> 49:05.390]  And I think that that may kind of lead to
[49:05.390 --> 49:06.950]  if this would work or not.
[49:08.030 --> 49:10.590]  I mean, labs are kind of looked at as like the police force
[49:10.590 --> 49:12.910]  in the soil and in most things.
[49:13.910 --> 49:17.590]  So those facultative anaerobes, I think would really help
[49:17.590 --> 49:19.550]  to start cleaning things up.
[49:19.550 --> 49:22.110]  And IMO, I think could really have a big impact
[49:22.110 --> 49:23.030]  on that as well.
[49:24.550 --> 49:26.230]  But I've never grown on that scale
[49:26.230 --> 49:28.630]  and I don't have that experience.
[49:28.630 --> 49:30.390]  So I don't wanna talk too much on that
[49:30.390 --> 49:32.830]  just because I don't wanna be pushing out
[49:32.830 --> 49:34.830]  wrong information or anything like that.
[49:36.550 --> 49:38.710]  Hey, there's nothing wrong with saying, I don't know,
[49:38.710 --> 49:41.030]  especially when we've been talking to you for three hours.
[49:41.030 --> 49:44.430]  Your personality, it's really kind of hard to hide
[49:44.430 --> 49:46.710]  who you are and that's why we like doing this show
[49:46.710 --> 49:50.990]  is how the hell would you know the answer to every question?
[49:50.990 --> 49:52.470]  We're all in this shit together.
[49:52.470 --> 49:55.630]  So hopefully if somebody doesn't know the community
[49:56.030 --> 49:57.190]  out there watching does.
[49:57.190 --> 50:00.390]  And that's really the end goal of this is the more people
[50:00.390 --> 50:02.390]  that are out there doing this, obviously there's
[50:02.390 --> 50:06.870]  this skillset vibes with a variety of different things.
[50:06.870 --> 50:08.990]  I was talking to a friend of mine,
[50:08.990 --> 50:10.150]  her and her husband and stuff.
[50:10.150 --> 50:13.270]  I'm not gonna out you or anything, but it touched me
[50:13.270 --> 50:16.510]  in the fact that like the skillset that they understand
[50:16.510 --> 50:18.750]  that maybe they'll fail in one direction
[50:18.750 --> 50:22.110]  or succeed in one direction, but the skillset alone
[50:22.110 --> 50:25.070]  is really how you're able to kind of pivot in life
[50:25.510 --> 50:27.990]  or as long as I know how to build a soil system,
[50:27.990 --> 50:30.750]  I can basically grow anything.
[50:30.750 --> 50:34.110]  I can grow flowers, I can grow food, I can grow medicine.
[50:34.110 --> 50:36.070]  We're all in this together to build that up.
[50:36.070 --> 50:39.150]  So that's why this community I hope continues to build up
[50:39.150 --> 50:42.510]  on those principles that, hey, you might not necessarily
[50:42.510 --> 50:45.510]  be a cannabis farmer yet, we're still learning from you
[50:45.510 --> 50:48.870]  because you grow vegetables or fruit.
[50:48.870 --> 50:50.790]  I mean, a lot of us wanna grow our own food.
[50:50.790 --> 50:52.110]  A lot of people that grow their own food
[50:52.110 --> 50:53.950]  wanna grow their own medicine.
[50:53.950 --> 50:56.150]  For some of us that maybe have a wedding coming up here,
[50:56.150 --> 50:58.550]  I would love if I could grow my own flowers.
[50:58.550 --> 51:00.110]  I don't know if you guys ever checked out pricing
[51:00.110 --> 51:02.790]  on that shit, but there's a lot of ways
[51:02.790 --> 51:05.230]  you could save some money when you have
[51:05.230 --> 51:06.390]  your own piece of property
[51:06.390 --> 51:09.150]  and that really should be the goal in life.
[51:09.150 --> 51:11.430]  Maybe that's my own personal goal in life.
[51:11.430 --> 51:13.630]  But for most of us, I feel like the goal in life
[51:13.630 --> 51:15.750]  is to maybe have a little piece of property,
[51:15.750 --> 51:17.750]  maybe kind of ranch that and farm that out
[51:17.750 --> 51:20.330]  and find ways where the property itself
[51:20.330 --> 51:23.430]  is now being monetized so that you can continue
[51:23.950 --> 51:27.110]  to have less of a burden as the years go by.
[51:28.790 --> 51:30.110]  Yeah, that's good points, Brian.
[51:30.110 --> 51:32.270]  And one thing, like you said, man,
[51:32.270 --> 51:34.750]  you guys said nobody does know everything,
[51:34.750 --> 51:36.870]  no one does and that's awesome.
[51:36.870 --> 51:38.030]  That means we're all learning.
[51:38.030 --> 51:41.430]  But one thing you can have is you can have your own mindset
[51:41.430 --> 51:43.750]  and then you have your principles so that that way
[51:43.750 --> 51:46.670]  when a question or an issue does come up,
[51:46.670 --> 51:49.990]  it's easy for you to talk your way kind of through it
[51:49.990 --> 51:52.630]  based on what you do know and based on kind of
[51:53.390 --> 51:56.910]  what you think is the right way to do things.
[51:56.910 --> 51:58.830]  So I think mindset is big.
[51:58.830 --> 52:01.630]  And man, shoot, who doesn't wanna have a little patch of land
[52:01.630 --> 52:03.830]  and grow some flowers for their woman, man,
[52:03.830 --> 52:06.750]  and that kind of stuff, man, grow a little food.
[52:06.750 --> 52:08.550]  That's what it's all about, you know what I mean?
[52:08.550 --> 52:10.870]  And these kind of things are gonna be key to that.
[52:10.870 --> 52:14.270]  Like any kind of land, yard or starting a new bed,
[52:15.310 --> 52:17.670]  collecting these IMO is gonna be key.
[52:17.670 --> 52:20.030]  It's gonna be the edge to me.
[52:20.310 --> 52:22.990]  It's what gives you that little bit more,
[52:22.990 --> 52:23.830]  you know what I mean?
[52:23.830 --> 52:26.990]  And your soil system and then your final product.
[52:28.230 --> 52:32.230]  So yeah, definitely taking notes here, guys,
[52:32.230 --> 52:34.590]  and get out there and make some collections,
[52:34.590 --> 52:35.430]  you know what I mean?
[52:35.430 --> 52:37.350]  Be creative, it's cold out,
[52:37.350 --> 52:38.710]  but you gotta be a little creative
[52:38.710 --> 52:41.030]  and try to figure out how to do it.
[52:41.030 --> 52:43.270]  One thing I wanna mention
[52:43.270 --> 52:45.230]  that just kind of came to mind to me,
[52:46.790 --> 52:47.830]  this is a big one.
[52:48.230 --> 52:51.310]  When you put your outdoor collections
[52:51.310 --> 52:52.670]  and you go to pick them up,
[52:53.550 --> 52:56.450]  make sure you bring your supplies to make IMO too.
[52:57.630 --> 53:01.790]  Do not try to take them home on a two, three hour drive
[53:03.070 --> 53:05.790]  and hope that the collection is gonna be the same.
[53:05.790 --> 53:09.590]  The IMO multiplies, microbes multiply so quickly.
[53:09.590 --> 53:10.910]  I know Leighton talks about this
[53:10.910 --> 53:12.030]  when you guys have done the other shows,
[53:12.030 --> 53:13.750]  how fast they multiply
[53:15.030 --> 53:17.150]  and how quick a generation will change.
[53:17.870 --> 53:21.350]  So when you're gonna go pull your boxes,
[53:21.350 --> 53:23.830]  bring your brown sugar, bring your vessel,
[53:23.830 --> 53:27.030]  bring your cloth lid, your sealed lid,
[53:27.030 --> 53:29.750]  whatever you need to make sure they're secured.
[53:31.110 --> 53:32.330]  And obviously don't put out more
[53:32.330 --> 53:34.630]  than you can take home with you, right?
[53:35.790 --> 53:37.270]  Just those are all kind of restraints
[53:37.270 --> 53:40.810]  of what you can and can't, what fits with your style.
[53:41.670 --> 53:44.570]  But please take your sugar with you.
[53:44.570 --> 53:46.530]  So that way you can set those IMO twos
[53:46.530 --> 53:47.730]  and have them ready to go
[53:47.730 --> 53:50.610]  and stabilize them at the time you pulled them.
[53:50.610 --> 53:51.850]  Because you saw them and visualize,
[53:51.850 --> 53:54.010]  you're like, okay, this is what I like, this is what I see.
[53:54.010 --> 53:55.370]  I wanna capture this,
[53:55.370 --> 53:59.610]  not this after two hours later when it's changed.
[53:59.610 --> 54:01.570]  So just something to keep in mind
[54:01.570 --> 54:03.770]  for those of you that have never tried this.
[54:04.810 --> 54:08.610]  Just make sure you're ready to do the next step after that.
[54:09.890 --> 54:12.130]  That is wisdom because maybe that was
[54:12.970 --> 54:16.490]  the my few mentors that I was doing this with,
[54:16.490 --> 54:17.490]  they never mentioned that.
[54:17.490 --> 54:20.290]  So we would drive back and then do it immediately.
[54:20.290 --> 54:21.570]  But that makes sense.
[54:21.570 --> 54:23.470]  Another two, three hours have gone by.
[54:24.570 --> 54:25.970]  Even if you're getting dinner,
[54:25.970 --> 54:26.970]  because it's been a long day.
[54:26.970 --> 54:30.250]  So now maybe it's three, four hours coming back.
[54:30.250 --> 54:31.690]  It makes a lot of sense, man.
[54:31.690 --> 54:32.890]  Weigh out your stuff,
[54:32.890 --> 54:34.690]  where you know the weight of it when you leave.
[54:34.690 --> 54:36.010]  So you can weigh out your rice,
[54:36.010 --> 54:38.490]  weigh out your put it out and come back with your sugar.
[54:38.490 --> 54:40.170]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[54:40.450 --> 54:43.090]  Again, yeah, that's things that I don't even think about
[54:43.090 --> 54:43.930]  without, you know,
[54:43.930 --> 54:47.250]  because you're not leaving the property very far,
[54:47.250 --> 54:48.410]  which is cool.
[54:48.410 --> 54:51.170]  But yeah, great, great, great point right there, man.
[54:51.170 --> 54:54.170]  Very good point to bring your fucking sugar
[54:54.170 --> 54:55.650]  and bring the right sugar guys.
[54:55.650 --> 54:56.890]  Like I'm tired of this.
[54:56.890 --> 54:58.210]  I'm gonna tell it like it is.
[54:58.210 --> 55:02.170]  I'm tired of this cheap sugar shit.
[55:02.170 --> 55:05.210]  Don't come at me with this cheap brown sugar
[55:05.210 --> 55:07.210]  that we used to put in our baked beans
[55:07.210 --> 55:08.290]  when we were little kids.
[55:08.330 --> 55:12.410]  Like I want that Dermarara, I want Jaggery sugar.
[55:12.410 --> 55:14.450]  And then you say, well, damn, that's expensive.
[55:14.450 --> 55:17.370]  Well, a two pound box of sugar in a raw,
[55:17.370 --> 55:20.970]  Dermarara sugar is like five bucks, worst case.
[55:20.970 --> 55:23.490]  All right, so you don't have $5
[55:23.490 --> 55:25.330]  to put into a quality input.
[55:26.370 --> 55:28.890]  What's gonna happen is if you don't use a quality sugar,
[55:28.890 --> 55:32.930]  your IMO2s are gonna get really runny and watery
[55:32.930 --> 55:34.330]  and they're gonna start growing things
[55:34.330 --> 55:35.770]  because people hit me all the time.
[55:35.770 --> 55:37.850]  And the first thing I say, well, what sugar did you use?
[55:38.410 --> 55:39.250]  And they say brown sugar.
[55:39.250 --> 55:40.090]  Well, let me see it.
[55:40.090 --> 55:43.490]  And it won't be the unrefined sugar.
[55:43.490 --> 55:45.530]  And the reason being that unrefined sugar
[55:45.530 --> 55:47.850]  is just like it says, like when you guys,
[55:47.850 --> 55:49.410]  you guys shouldn't even eat white sugar.
[55:49.410 --> 55:50.450]  I say this all the time,
[55:50.450 --> 55:52.370]  stop eating white sugar in your body
[55:52.370 --> 55:54.530]  because what white sugar is,
[55:54.530 --> 55:56.850]  they've stripped all the nutrients out of it,
[55:56.850 --> 55:58.450]  just giving you that sweetener.
[55:58.450 --> 56:01.050]  And it's basically a process sweetener now.
[56:01.930 --> 56:06.930]  Stick to the raw stuff, close to the source as possible.
[56:07.210 --> 56:08.570]  It's gonna give you a better collection.
[56:08.570 --> 56:10.890]  It's gonna be better for you in the long run.
[56:10.890 --> 56:13.970]  These IMO2s, you think you make a jar of IMO2,
[56:13.970 --> 56:15.930]  I think it lasts you a year or two,
[56:15.930 --> 56:17.930]  depending on how active you are
[56:17.930 --> 56:19.690]  or how many other collections you have.
[56:19.690 --> 56:23.650]  So spend a few dollars, get you some good sugar
[56:23.650 --> 56:26.770]  and start eating good sugar yourself
[56:26.770 --> 56:28.210]  if you're gonna eat it.
[56:28.210 --> 56:29.570]  Yeah, there you go, Johnny.
[56:30.810 --> 56:32.370]  Some of the best advice I ever got
[56:32.370 --> 56:34.010]  when you're starting some of this stuff
[56:34.010 --> 56:36.490]  is just to realize that you are going to
[56:37.410 --> 56:39.610]  sometimes spend money in the wrong places.
[56:39.610 --> 56:40.610]  And that's just how it is.
[56:40.610 --> 56:42.690]  But you're trying to get to the end goal
[56:42.690 --> 56:44.250]  where now you have that skillset.
[56:44.250 --> 56:45.770]  Now you know which brand to buy.
[56:45.770 --> 56:47.410]  Now you know, everything's dialed in.
[56:47.410 --> 56:50.930]  So you have a consistency with this stuff
[56:50.930 --> 56:52.650]  because once you have this skillset,
[56:52.650 --> 56:55.490]  again, you can apply this to any soil system.
[56:55.490 --> 56:57.890]  I mean, it just opens up a variety of different things
[56:57.890 --> 56:59.970]  and it just takes your,
[56:59.970 --> 57:02.410]  just everything that you're growing to the next level.
[57:02.410 --> 57:05.970]  And I mean, I hope more and more people understand
[57:06.410 --> 57:08.370]  that from vivariums to cannabis plants,
[57:08.370 --> 57:10.970]  this is long-term thinking so that you yourself
[57:10.970 --> 57:12.410]  don't have to manage it anymore.
[57:12.410 --> 57:13.890]  You just kind of monitor things,
[57:13.890 --> 57:15.970]  maybe make small improvements week to week,
[57:15.970 --> 57:17.050]  month to month.
[57:17.050 --> 57:18.570]  And that should be the end goal
[57:18.570 --> 57:21.450]  when we're starting to understand how to farm,
[57:21.450 --> 57:25.170]  build things using mother nature, using the soil food web.
[57:25.170 --> 57:28.370]  As soon as you understand that specific verbiage,
[57:28.370 --> 57:30.530]  you're definitely on the right rabbit hole
[57:30.530 --> 57:31.850]  to kind of changing your stars
[57:31.850 --> 57:34.530]  and understanding things from a whole different perspective,
[57:34.530 --> 57:37.450]  maybe even potentially creating your own business
[57:37.450 --> 57:39.050]  from just that skillset alone.
[57:42.400 --> 57:43.240]  Yeah, that's true.
[57:43.240 --> 57:45.560]  I know that Johnny, you're doing some inputs and things.
[57:45.560 --> 57:48.160]  So how's that been going, man?
[57:48.160 --> 57:49.800]  It's going, it's going, man.
[57:49.800 --> 57:53.000]  I feel like when I jumped into this,
[57:53.840 --> 57:55.480]  just with what I do for a living
[57:55.480 --> 57:58.680]  and how present you have to be
[57:58.680 --> 57:59.880]  with a lot of the K&F stuff,
[57:59.880 --> 58:03.040]  like I just wanted as many reps as I could get.
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.200]  So like I just tried making as many things as I could
[58:07.080 --> 58:10.640]  so I could learn and just do my own R&D with it.
[58:12.120 --> 58:15.520]  And then I had some people that are very much so respected
[58:15.520 --> 58:18.680]  in the K&F community try some of my stuff
[58:18.680 --> 58:19.840]  and they really liked it.
[58:19.840 --> 58:22.400]  So I'm like, well, hell, if it came out good,
[58:22.400 --> 58:23.800]  let's see who else wants it.
[58:23.800 --> 58:27.040]  And some other people started reaching out to me.
[58:27.040 --> 58:30.860]  So like I carry my OHN and my FA on my website,
[58:31.840 --> 58:35.360]  myfillerooted.org for those of you, if you guys need any.
[58:37.040 --> 58:38.520]  But that's primarily it.
[58:38.520 --> 58:39.560]  I feel like everything else,
[58:39.560 --> 58:43.280]  like for the most part, it's pretty easy to make.
[58:43.280 --> 58:47.080]  And the carbon footprint of me putting that in a bottle
[58:47.080 --> 58:48.800]  and shipping it to you,
[58:48.800 --> 58:51.400]  when you can make your own FPGA in your own labs,
[58:51.400 --> 58:52.800]  I just feel like it'd probably be better
[58:52.800 --> 58:54.280]  from your own region.
[58:54.280 --> 58:55.940]  But I wanna make sure that people can have
[58:55.940 --> 58:57.720]  the starting material that they,
[58:57.720 --> 58:59.880]  if they wanna try a lot of this K&F stuff,
[59:00.940 --> 59:03.480]  they don't have to wait the six months to a year
[59:03.480 --> 59:05.840]  to make fish amino acids.
[59:06.680 --> 59:08.460]  I don't know if you have any active on your site,
[59:08.460 --> 59:09.960]  but I know that's something that you were selling
[59:09.960 --> 59:11.480]  for a while.
[59:11.480 --> 59:13.080]  And same thing with like OHN.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.080]  But yeah, it's all listed there.
[59:16.080 --> 59:21.080]  And I have, I carry a wetting agent on there as well.
[59:21.400 --> 59:22.520]  It's very simple to make.
[59:22.520 --> 59:24.920]  Like honestly, you could make it for pennies
[59:24.920 --> 59:26.700]  on pennies for the bottle.
[59:28.220 --> 59:30.920]  So I honestly encourage everybody to try to make this stuff
[59:30.920 --> 59:32.140]  as much as you can.
[59:32.540 --> 59:35.980]  Make it on yourself, become self-sufficient.
[59:35.980 --> 59:37.300]  Like that's really the name of it.
[59:37.300 --> 59:39.560]  Cut the cost from your own production.
[59:39.560 --> 59:42.620]  But if you don't want to, I mean, there's my website.
[59:42.620 --> 59:45.880]  You can take a look and you can go to the products section
[59:45.880 --> 59:47.260]  of it and stuff.
[59:47.260 --> 59:48.500]  Yeah, that was a picture from my garden
[59:48.500 --> 59:51.100]  from a couple of years ago, my outdoor veggie garden.
[59:52.540 --> 59:53.380]  And things like that.
[59:53.380 --> 59:55.540]  But yeah, you can take a look and pick up
[59:55.540 --> 59:57.460]  some of those things if you'd like.
[59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.420]  I also usually try to carry the herbs for OHN
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.400]  if anybody can't find them.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.080]  I think Mountain, is it like Mountain Rose something?
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.980]  I think they sell it online.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.620]  And a couple of other people,
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.220]  other websites you might be able to find them.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.580]  But if you can't, just send me a message.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.340]  And we have a couple of shops in my neighborhood
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.980]  that I usually go to to stock up on.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.820]  And I'd be more than happy to make sure
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.460]  I can help you guys out to get you guys supplies
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.980]  that you guys need.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.040]  But like I said, make it yourself.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.700]  It's so much cheaper.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700]  It's just time.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.100]  So if you don't want to put the time in,
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.980]  you got people like me and Mark that'll help you out.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.940]  That's right.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.940]  And just back to one real quick thing on the sugar.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:42.120]  Francis Meow, there is not hippie sugar.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.660]  If you understand what jaggery sugar is,
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.700]  jaggery sugar is sugar cane
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.660]  that was squeezed out of this plant,
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:54.860]  put in a pot to dehydrate.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.660]  That's two steps.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.100]  There's nothing hippie about that, bro.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.740]  That predates anything.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.100]  I don't understand what that means, Mark.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.620]  I don't know what it means either.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.780]  Oh, like- I do.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.140]  Fruit flavor?
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.540]  What do they mean, Johnny?
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.580]  Because I don't like that kind of talk.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.420]  I feel you.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.720]  And I think that makes sense.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.140]  And I think I understand what they're saying.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.860]  There's sugar and then what some people
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.360]  would consider to be bougie sugar, right?
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.340]  But at the same time, it's what we have access to,
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.180]  what we don't have access to,
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.340]  what's good for us and what's not,
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.820]  what modern society tells us is good for us and what's not.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.260]  I mean, there's different ways we can take that.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.860]  But I think what they're meaning is that
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.860]  K and F and a lot of this stuff is supposed to be low cost.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.700]  So what's accessible to the farmer,
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.620]  but what's accessible to the farmer in this region
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.820]  can be different than what's accessible
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.460]  to the farmer in that region.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.940]  So for instance, if you're down in Latin America
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.660]  where people grow sugar cane like crazy
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.240]  and you have sugar cane growing,
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.140]  you could juice it, take it, dry it out, crack it up,
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.060]  and boom, you have fresh cane sugar that you can use.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.540]  I mean, technically, I guess that could be
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.820]  considered hippie stuff, right?
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.060]  But it's just what's accessible.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.300]  Like for me, what's accessible, it's cheap,
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.020]  is C&H, which is what they were using.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.660]  A lot of the teachers were using out in Hawaii as well,
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.260]  just because it's easy, cheap, and you can buy it
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260]  and it's affordable.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.540]  But for instance, like what you're saying,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.500]  Marco Jaggery, something that's easy for you
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.060]  to get ahold of, and you can probably find it
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.220]  in your local area.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.740]  That's what you like to use.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.580]  I think that's kind of what they mean.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.220]  Yeah, yeah, I don't have any issues
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.240]  with anybody using whatever works for them,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.960]  but it ain't about like, I didn't know
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.280]  that they had hippie sugar back then.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.520]  Everybody had what was available to them.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]  Like I don't know.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.680]  So that was just kind of weird.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.240]  And then that's a lot of this society too,
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.480]  where everybody has big screen TV,
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.480]  everybody has nice high dollar shoes,
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.280]  everybody has thousand dollar smartphones,
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.920]  but nobody has $5 to put into an input to grow their food
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.360]  that's gonna be able to sit on the shelf
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.240]  for a year to two years.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.200]  So that's just a mindset and that's just me
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.400]  spitting out what I spit, but everybody's got money
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  for everything until it comes to,
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.080]  oh man, you're using that expensive sugar?
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.360]  Like, well, fuck, yeah, I want my body
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.240]  to have a quality input.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.000]  And you're gonna pay the doctor later
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.600]  for poor quality inputs, or you can pay a little bit
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.400]  up front for higher quality inputs.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.240]  So it's just a mindset.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.040]  And I just get disappointed when people
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.640]  kind of put their thought process into the wrong way.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.360]  You're looking at things a little bit the wrong way,
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.200]  you know what I mean?
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.360]  And I wouldn't use honey because honey
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.680]  is not gonna have that osmotic pressure that sugar.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.520]  Yeah, you don't wanna use something wet.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.360]  It has anti-microbial processes to it.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.440]  You don't wanna use something wet.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.480]  You wanna use something dry
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.200]  because you want it to suck the moisture out
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.360]  what's in there.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.640]  Honey and molasses already have a balanced
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.800]  liquid content within it.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.000]  So it's not gonna necessarily pull the moisture
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.840]  out of what you want.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.560]  You're adding more moisture to the solution.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.240]  What you're trying to do is, in a sense,
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.880]  dehydrate it to preserve it so it'll last longer.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.920]  So you wanna use something dry
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.440]  so that osmotic pressure will suck the liquid out.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.400]  I think what Aiden might be getting at too,
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.400]  is there an advantage to using maybe diverse sources
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.880]  of sugars so that might create different sources
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.320]  of the microbes?
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.960]  So maybe using beet sugar along with brown sugar
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.960]  and running with that and seeing how you're successful
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.800]  with that.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.840]  And then, love to hear what you...
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.240]  One said yes, one said no.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.080]  So that's why I love asking these questions.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:34.920]  My take on-
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.000]  I'm just gonna nod and I'll let Johnny go ahead.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.600]  I'd say my take on it is the sugar has nothing to do
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.480]  with the microbes in this stage, right?
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.520]  In this particular process.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.640]  The process of collecting microbes
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.920]  is you going out to the forest and collecting the microbes.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.260]  You're trying to stabilize that, period.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.360]  The sugar is stabilization, not microbial food.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.840]  That's right.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.200]  You're stabilizing with the sugar,
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.000]  but you want a quality sugar.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.680]  Quality sugar.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.040]  Because if you think about it,
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.000]  Mark, what you were saying before about even just
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.760]  our own health and stuff, sugar is so processed.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.360]  The glycemic index is so high.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.040]  Then we start looking at why we have
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.320]  so many health issues in America.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.360]  But if you look at something that's super unrefined,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360]  probably like jaggery, the glycemic index in that
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.600]  is completely different than what it would be
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.760]  for a processed table sugar,
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.920]  or the white sugar that you might see.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.880]  And it's packed with minerals.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.480]  There's a company called Justpanela
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.160]  that's out of Colorado that gets their stuff
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.640]  shipped in from Columbia.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  It's basically dehydrated cane sugar.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.040]  Their manganese content is extremely high
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.160]  relative to other sugars that I've seen, at least.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.880]  They'll break down, their whole mineral breakdown.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.120]  You don't get those minerals
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.440]  if you're buying other cheap sugar.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.040]  Granted, that stuff's expensive.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.800]  But man, I started using that for my tea
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.760]  and coffee in the morning.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.160]  Oh man, that stuff's delicious.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.560]  And it tastes better.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.400]  Hell yeah.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.680]  When you're cooking, man, you use good ingredients,
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.800]  that shit's gonna taste way better.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.640]  You know, one thing about-
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.040]  You're gonna pay an hour later.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.040]  But one thing about, another thing to look up
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.160]  is Nova Class, and that is about talking
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.520]  about the classification of food processing.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.080]  So if I take an apple,
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.760]  I believe that's not on Nova Class,
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.360]  because that's one whole food within itself,
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.680]  no food labels, right?
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.960]  If I take that apple and put it in the slices
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.280]  and I put it in a package,
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.640]  now that's Nova Class 1,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.680]  meaning that's one step in processing.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.800]  And it goes on up to the point where you're taking
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.000]  that apple up to Nova Class 4,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.520]  where I've taken that same apple,
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.000]  now I've cut it, now I've crushed it,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  now I've juiced it, now I've put it in a concentrate,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.120]  now I've put it into a bottle.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.200]  That's Nova Class 4.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.160]  That's the worst classification of processed food.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.400]  So when you guys are thinking about these foods,
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.000]  and this is something I've just been reading on,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.760]  so do your research as well,
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.160]  look at how the food is processed
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.720]  and it's got a classification
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.680]  and you can look this up online
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.280]  and kind of see how processed things are
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.080]  that you're eating and that you're putting in your body.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.000]  So just something to think about out there.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.920]  Process is kind of the worst thing for your body,
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.260]  processed foods.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.120]  So that's just not really had anything to do with the IMO,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.160]  so we can get back to that,
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.320]  but I just wanted to kind of-
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.520]  Well, processed foods kill your microbial world
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.360]  in your gut.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.760]  As well, the sugar in the same way.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.600]  I mean, I bet everybody is probably experiencing that,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.600]  even if they don't realize that.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.760]  That's true, man.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.880]  Even going out to eat,
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.760]  most of that food is flavoring MSG.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.360]  I learned that Chick-fil-A,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.520]  that's why everybody loves Chick-fil-A,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.400]  well, Chick-fil-A is good too, but-
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.600]  They're pumping in the chicken.
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.080]  They got MSG in that shit.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.080]  Well, here's a myth.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.160]  There's a myth now that the MSG thing
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.800]  was just propped up to kind of...
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.000]  You got to look at this,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.240]  but my wife read and she kind of conveyed it to me
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.240]  that MSG is not as bad as people put it out to be.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.480]  It was something about the food
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.800]  and it's trying to kind of discredit folks,
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.560]  class of people's food, Chinese food.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.840]  They try to put that stigmatism on that,
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.440]  oh, it's got all MSG.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.640]  Well, if you look at studies,
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.440]  MSG by itself isn't horrible.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.280]  You know what I mean?
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.520]  So things just to read up on,
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.800]  understand what's going on out there.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240]  Do your own research.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.120]  I'm just dropping a little tidbits to make you think
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.000]  that's something that we did read out there about the MSG.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.560]  So educate yourself.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.600]  MSG to me makes the food taste like
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.800]  when you're high tasting food.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.800]  It's like, damn, this chicken is delicious.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.640]  Right.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.320]  I haven't ate as cold as fuck, man.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.920]  This is some good, you know.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.600]  So I don't know, do your research on that.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.480]  It makes sense to me.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.400]  I think Chick-fil-A, at least for my family,
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.960]  is craveable because they're closed on Sunday
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.800]  and that's when the kids seem to always want that anyway.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.840]  So yeah, look after your stomach, microbe.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.760]  Stop eating fast food.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.360]  Yeah, pretty much cook your own food.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.600]  You cook, Johnny, you cook your own food
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.120]  or you're a fast food guy?
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.760]  My lady's the main chef in the house.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.040]  Okay, okay, okay.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.640]  She throws down, and props to her
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.920]  if you're listening right now, girl.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.200]  She slays it, yeah.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.240]  Mainly plant-based too, so I don't think we have any meat
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.800]  in the house other than like the dog food.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.840]  Yeah, we're on a high on that.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.080]  I like my fish though.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.800]  And yeah, my lady's all,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.120]  I think she's gone trying vegan again.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.080]  Yeah, I think what I had for lunch today,
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.880]  like some shepherd's pie that she made
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.120]  with like lentils and mushrooms.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.720]  Yeah, she was delicious.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.120]  Man, people are sleeping on just making a big pot of beans.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:10.960]  There's something about it.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.640]  Having a big pot of beans.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.720]  Lentils, beans, yeah.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.880]  Eat on that stuff for two, three days.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.720]  Make me hungry.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.720]  All right, so do you guys kind of want to talk through
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.560]  for people that don't understand that,
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.120]  for the most part, you've just been kind of talking
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.560]  about IMO1 and there's levels to this shit.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.760]  So what happens now that we brought the sugar
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.120]  with us out in the forest,
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.880]  we're putting things together.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.880]  You got one dude peeping park rangers,
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.760]  putting it all spy style, got it finished.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.760]  Now that would be considered IMO2?
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.560]  Yeah, once it's stabilized, I'm sorry.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.680]  Once you, so IMO1, you make the collection,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.600]  you capture a snapshot of the microbes
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.640]  that are out in the forest
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.200]  or wherever you essentially collect from.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.760]  Once you stabilize it, now that becomes IMO2.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.960]  I'll show you guys here.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.320]  This is IMO2.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.280]  So this is my rice collection I dropped in here.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.880]  And basically I weighed it out,
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.880]  added equal weight brown sugar,
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.400]  and boom, this is stabilized.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.360]  If you look at it closely,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.560]  you might see a couple of like air pockets.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.640]  That's normal, but it's not bubbling.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.480]  If it's bubbling, you need to add more sugar.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.560]  That means it's still active.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.880]  Eventually it'll kind of stable out.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.560]  Like I did this one in April of last year.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.000]  So this is almost a year old.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.480]  I like writing down personally the date
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.520]  where it was collected, how it was collected,
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.960]  the region it was collected from,
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.000]  and how many days it took.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.840]  So this collection I started,
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.920]  I put it out on the 11th of April.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.200]  I picked it up on the 16th.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.640]  It was a five-day collection.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.480]  So I like writing that information down.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.320]  Let me see if I can.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.440]  I was about to say, Johnny,
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.000]  that aspect cannot be overstated of taking good notes,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.240]  quality notes.
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240]  Absolutely.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.200]  Using a high quality Sharpie pen
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.360]  that's not going to smear over time.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.280]  Marco was saying,
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.440]  if you can't put a couple of dollars into this,
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.080]  you're learning how to do it already
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.880]  for pennies on the dollar.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.240]  Yeah, that's valuable, Brian, that Sharpie, man.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.240]  I don't know how many times I've wondered
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.320]  what the hell did I write on this?
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.320]  Yeah, you can't cheap out on certain things.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.560]  And when you're saying cheaping out,
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.440]  we're talking a couple of dollars here.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.440]  Yeah, I did that with my JLF buckets last year.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.600]  And I don't know what any of my buckets are this year.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.440]  They've completely decomposed.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.240]  I can't tell what the material is
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.560]  because it's literally decomposed.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.160]  And the rain destroyed whatever I wrote on the tape
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.240]  or whatever it was.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.480]  Well, still good stuff.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.160]  At this point with some of my buckets,
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.800]  I'm just kind of guessing that are outside.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.600]  But yeah, get a good Sharpie.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.440]  Even on tape, like duct tape, it'll smear off the duct tape.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.160]  I think that's what I did.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.480]  Just write it directly on the bucket,
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.160]  especially if you're doing like JLFs.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.600]  You're not gonna use that bucket for anything else,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.720]  trust me.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.280]  You're not gonna want to.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.400]  Make sure it's on there nice and clear
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400]  for you to do yourself that favor.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.040]  But yeah, you wanna make sure you write down
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.520]  as much information as you can when you do this collection
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.760]  so that way you can replicate it if need be.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.080]  How many days?
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.560]  I put the lat long on here as well
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.000]  from the area that it came from,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.520]  the area that I picked it up from,
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.200]  how I did the collection, and then the date.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.920]  Those are just little things that I like marking on here.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.880]  And these are gallon size containers.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.480]  This is a gallon right here.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.880]  And I still have some room.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.720]  Obviously I've used some of it,
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.920]  but this will last me a long time.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.280]  I mean, that's a whole nother conversation
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.200]  that we can get into using IMO two or three or four.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.280]  But yeah, get a good size collection
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.120]  and make sure you mark it properly
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.320]  and store it in a dark place.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.280]  Don't leave this out in sunlight.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.540]  If you have a closet or if you have a shelf
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.600]  that's out of direct sunlight, that would work.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.940]  And I just use a breathable lid for mine.
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.780]  That seemed to work.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.200]  I mean, this collection, as you guys see,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.880]  I did in April of last year,
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:18.000]  and I mean, it looks good to me, so.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.480]  Yeah, good points on that.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.080]  One thing, definitely don't write on the lids
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.280]  because there's nothing like swapping lids.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.560]  I like to put right on my side of the bucket
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.300]  where it won't easily rain off.
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.320]  Like you said, that's valuable.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.760]  Some of the IMO twos, man,
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.480]  I noticed that some of them are wetter than others.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.760]  The wetter ones I leave with a breathable cloth
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.000]  if they start getting dry,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.600]  because they will get crusty on the top
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.140]  where you got to damn near take a chisel
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.800]  to kind of bust it up if you let it dry out too much.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.680]  And some of those that get on the drier side,
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.880]  just seal them with a closed top to keep that moisture in.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.480]  There's a little trick to that too.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.480]  You could add a little water to it.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.800]  Now, I'm not saying grab an ounce of water
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.640]  and pour it on top, nothing like that.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.680]  I'm talking like get your hands wet
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.400]  and just like sprinkle some water on,
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.320]  flick some water on the top.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.360]  That little bit of moisture
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.440]  will kind of help break that up over time.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.400]  But yeah, I understand what you mean.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.480]  Like this one right here
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.200]  has a little bit of crust on it on the top.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.440]  This one I collected in the fall of 2020.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.240]  So this is, I mean, this is a lot older than that.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.200]  I think I filled this one up a little too much.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.440]  I don't usually like filling it up this big or this high,
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.600]  but I didn't have another container at the time.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.720]  So I just went with what I had.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.560]  And then same thing,
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.840]  I just use a breathable cloth on the top and a rubber band.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.880]  And that usually seems to work for me to store it.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.360]  So make sure there's still gas exchange
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.200]  and things like that.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.980]  And if it starts to bubble up,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.600]  make sure you add some more sugar to it.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.860]  You can add a little sugar cap if need be,
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.740]  or mix in a little bit of sugar into the top.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:56.900]  Just be gentle with it.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.700]  I think also what Marco is highlighting too
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.240]  is remember that these, where your environment is.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.420]  So there's nothing really concrete with all this.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.860]  They're giving you guidelines.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:08.340]  Then you take that and figure out,
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.900]  hey, maybe three days is it, maybe not five days.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.740]  Maybe for me, it's nine days of collection and stuff.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.860]  And these little nuances
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.940]  that you already gonna know to think about,
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.740]  I promise they're gonna save a lot of time.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.140]  And just even the lid aspect from what Marco was saying.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.580]  I mean, let's be faced.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.740]  Some of us work late at night,
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:28.780]  pretty stoned after a long day.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.220]  So there's just mistakes that can be made.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.540]  So why not minimize that from the start
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.500]  and just realize, all right,
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.420]  I'm gonna put all my information on the side.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.240]  It is better at the beginning, obviously,
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.180]  to do more information than less
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.820]  and start to figure out what collections
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.600]  seem to really take hold.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.180]  Do you guys feel like you should go to the same area
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.180]  year after year, or do you kind of like
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.860]  have your 2021 season and now you're going into 2022
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:54.900]  at a different spot?
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.860]  I don't have a lot of, I guess I go to the same,
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.700]  I guess, in a sense region.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.340]  I may collect from, I'm never doing like
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.000]  the exact same spot.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.780]  I kind of just walk around.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.460]  If I'm going on a hike, I'll just walk through the forest
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.300]  and just kind of see.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.740]  It's like, I usually have like my knife with me
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.340]  and I'll pull back some of the leaf litter
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:22.140]  and kind of see if that spot vibes with me.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.420]  I mean, as odd as that may sound,
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:27.200]  but like it just, if that spot feels right,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.160]  see what I'm looking at there.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.860]  If I'm seeing my seedling growing,
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.980]  I can actively see these microbes that I want.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.540]  I'll probably just choose that.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:39.440]  But I typically stick to the same regions
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:43.340]  just because I don't have a lot of forest in my area.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.820]  And even some of the areas that,
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.980]  yeah, basically, I don't have a lot of forest areas
[01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.120]  in my region.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.260]  So I stick to the same in sense mountain ranges
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.100]  and things like that,
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:58.740]  but different exact collection spots, if that makes sense.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:05.460]  When you're collecting from these samples,
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.660]  is there a difference like putting it in glass
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:08.720]  versus plastic?
[01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:14.050]  Personally, I don't know.
[01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.910]  I've always been told that I don't want to use plastic
[01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:19.570]  for storing.
[01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.750]  So I leave this up to my teachers
[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.790]  that have passed down that wisdom to me.
[01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.670]  And I've just used glass since I've started for storing.
[01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:28.630]  Yeah, man, you know, you don't want to put them turps
[01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:30.350]  in under glass, man.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.140]  Hey man, sometimes I ask leading questions, you know that.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:36.980]  I know.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:37.900]  Glass is important.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:38.940]  Cedar is important.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:42.500]  If this is a long ball play for you, which it should be,
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.220]  then yeah, you want to realize that this is going to be,
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.300]  maybe a hundred bucks to get started.
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:53.060]  If you really have your things dialed in,
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.660]  you can sometimes even get like the Home Depot individuals
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.140]  to cut everything for you.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:00.300]  So if you are a city individual,
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.500]  maybe you can get all that stuff done.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.140]  So you can just take all the wood home,
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.060]  work on it in your backyard, get it done,
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.620]  and then off to the races with this kind of stuff.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:13.300]  They will cut wood for you guys at Home Depot on those.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.940]  That's a great point, bro.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.960]  Yeah, and then, I mean, there you go.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.680]  There's half the battle with a lot of that stuff.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.920]  And again, if you live in an apartment,
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.080]  maybe you just dial down.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.640]  You're doing this more often than somebody
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.680]  that's a homeowner that probably has storage
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.520]  and all that kind of stuff.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.160]  But wherever you are living,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.880]  you're able to take the time to improve things.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.120]  And that really is the end game is to have the experience
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.920]  because then when you do have opportunities arise,
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.480]  you know how to, maybe it's an opportunity
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.280]  for monetary things.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.120]  Maybe it's an opportunity to learn
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.600]  underneath another mentor.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.960]  And that is sometimes invaluable for you
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.440]  in your path in life to sometimes just understand
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.040]  where someone else is coming from,
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.560]  that's doing it at scale.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.440]  And they can tell you all these little nuances,
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.280]  not necessarily with IMO, but just in farming in general,
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.040]  when somebody has done it at scale
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.080]  and you are a tent farmer or a basement farmer,
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.520]  there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.120]  But then have somebody pull you under your wing and say,
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.480]  hey, this is how you run this.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.100]  This is how we're gonna run these things.
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.800]  That is fantastic.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.440]  When you also have these other skillsets
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.040]  that you could probably teach that individual
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.160]  that might not understand natural farming,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.800]  that's where a true friendship can hopefully blossom,
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.240]  a real community.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.200]  And that's at the end of the day,
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.000]  we say this so many times,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.680]  if we're all bickering within each other, man,
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.280]  there's fucking no way that we're gonna compete.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.720]  So if I'm teaching you, man, you're teaching me,
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.400]  I know that I'm building my attributes on another level.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.800]  And that should be a daily process.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.720]  That's where part of shows like this,
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.080]  I feel like, and I'll just say this,
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.280]  get as good as you can get.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.120]  You know what I mean?
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.720]  If you're that guy sitting on the sidelines,
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.520]  you're that player, you know you're a good player,
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.520]  you're ready to get in the game, whatever it may be,
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.080]  whatever your field of choice may be,
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:20:59.920]  you know what I mean?
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.480]  Keep getting as good as you can get
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.220]  because eventually you're gonna get a shot.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.280]  Someone's gonna see you.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.400]  Somebody's gonna say, hey man,
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.200]  I see what you're doing over there.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.040]  What's going on?
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.520]  Just like the FCP show.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.760]  They reached out to me a while back
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.040]  and I didn't realize anybody was even really paying attention
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:17.880]  to what I'm doing.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.720]  You know what I mean?
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.680]  I'm just doing the best I can for myself.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.960]  And I think that's the key, man, when you're doing anything,
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.000]  do the best you can for yourself.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.560]  Because when that opportunity comes,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.840]  you're already grinding.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.800]  And those are the things that are gonna show through.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.360]  People might just happen to walk by you that day
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.680]  and you took a lazy day off,
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.000]  you took the lazy way out and they noticed that.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.200]  Well, that might be the one day
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.600]  you shouldn't have took the day off.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.400]  So that's why you kind of,
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.720]  like Michael Jordan used to say,
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.960]  do things as if somebody's watching you all the time.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.840]  And that's kind of what his advice was.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.060]  Like he said, he'd just be shooting by himself,
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.200]  but he'd do it as if the whole world was watching.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.160]  And those are kind of things
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.000]  where you put the pressure on yourself,
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.960]  get better, keep grinding,
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.460]  and eventually something's gonna open up for you.
[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:10.750]  Because in time, I feel like there's gonna be
[01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.590]  just so many job opportunities
[01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:14.030]  that could potentially come from
[01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:17.990]  this small little wave that everybody,
[01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:20.350]  just with organic farming, if that's the umbrella,
[01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:24.110]  so that I'm including everybody under that little banner,
[01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:27.270]  then there's a way for us to find opportunity
[01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:28.830]  for everybody involved.
[01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:33.830]  There's just so many things that go into a large,
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.790]  even like a 10,000 or less square foot facility.
[01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:38.870]  I mean, there's still multiple individuals
[01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.430]  that now have jobs from that.
[01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:43.710]  So you can turn or talk to the people
[01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:46.070]  that are making financial decisions
[01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:47.470]  and really get their ear.
[01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:49.430]  This makes a lot of sense to them
[01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:52.270]  because they are also in the long-term play.
[01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:54.590]  Or you should be working with somebody
[01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:57.030]  that's viewing this as a long-term play
[01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:59.670]  because that's what really cannabis farming is,
[01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:02.750]  is there's obviously a huge upfront cost.
[01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:06.630]  And then on the backend, hopefully things are dialed in.
[01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:09.350]  Most of us know that it's really no secret
[01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:12.110]  that large commercial facilities
[01:23:12.150 --> 01:23:14.950]  end up usually costing more over time.
[01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:18.790]  Labor becomes a nightmare, just trying to dial things in.
[01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:21.030]  Crop loss is sometimes high.
[01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:24.230]  Inner fighting between individuals.
[01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:26.510]  One guy wants the opportunity to throw the ball
[01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:27.870]  while the other guy doesn't wanna give the guy
[01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:30.070]  the opportunity and never wants to say things.
[01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:33.350]  So again, this all comes down to you as the individual.
[01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:35.270]  You can only control what you do.
[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:39.350]  And when you're at that level, you just play your role.
[01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:42.190]  And if you continue to educate and put it out there
[01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:46.150]  that you understand the way that things are farmed,
[01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:48.710]  like Marco was saying, you will get your opportunity.
[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:50.030]  If you're out there enough,
[01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:52.390]  somebody will eventually put you on.
[01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:55.030]  And so whether that takes a few years, a few months,
[01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:57.470]  sometimes that's just luck,
[01:23:57.470 --> 01:24:00.070]  but somebody will eventually get you to that point.
[01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:04.710]  And it really starts by understanding building soil systems
[01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:07.470]  because maybe, let's say maybe your journey
[01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:08.870]  isn't necessarily cannabis farming,
[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.750]  but you're at least farming organically,
[01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:13.990]  using organic practices so that when you do get
[01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.990]  that interview with a cannabis farm, you'd be like,
[01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:19.390]  well, yeah, I'm building soil systems with tomatoes,
[01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:22.470]  but obviously that's pretty close to the same thing.
[01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.950]  And people, as long as you have a certain charisma about you
[01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:27.910]  I think they'll sit and listen.
[01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:31.030]  If you're able to present this in a way where they,
[01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:33.510]  most owners are losing money at this point.
[01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:39.590]  What you got Johnny?
[01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:41.870]  Everybody came here to see you, man.
[01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:43.350]  They don't wanna hear us talk.
[01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:44.190]  What do you wanna see?
[01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:45.150]  What do you wanna know?
[01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:47.310]  Should we move on to IMO three?
[01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:49.350]  Yeah, where you wanna talk about, man?
[01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.750]  Well, we're talking about you obviously
[01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:53.430]  ain't interested in, so what you got?
[01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:55.070]  I'm interested, man, I'm listening.
[01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:56.750]  My girl just sent me a text message telling me
[01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.030]  that she heard me shout her out about her cooking.
[01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.870]  So I was looking at that.
[01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:00.790]  Oh, that's what's up.
[01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:02.070]  Yeah, let's go IMO three,
[01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:04.830]  cause that's a fun baby.
[01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.870]  Talk to folks through kind of your process, man.
[01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:09.430]  I know you've developed some nice stuff
[01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:10.790]  on how to get your IMO three.
[01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:12.670]  Yeah, so before we jump to that,
[01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:13.510]  I wanna say one thing.
[01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:15.590]  I saw there's something that came up
[01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:17.790]  like way earlier in the chat that was asking me about,
[01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:20.670]  can you use IMO two instead of using IMO three
[01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:22.630]  in any of your stuff?
[01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:24.190]  And the answer is yes, you can.
[01:25:25.190 --> 01:25:26.310]  I mean, you can use any microbes.
[01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:27.630]  You can use leaf mold too.
[01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.550]  The nice thing about IMO two is that it's shelf stable.
[01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:34.470]  Leaf mold will eventually decompose.
[01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:36.150]  Things will change.
[01:25:36.150 --> 01:25:37.350]  The storability and things like that
[01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:39.350]  will be different than something that's shelf stable
[01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:41.710]  that you can just keep on your shelf.
[01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:44.550]  As a farmer, if you could have any of these tools,
[01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:46.830]  I would highly recommend doing IMO one and two
[01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:47.910]  at a bare minimum.
[01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:52.430]  Because that is your inoculant that is on your shelf,
[01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:54.190]  that is indigenous to your area
[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:56.790]  that you can use on and on and on moving forward.
[01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:59.470]  That's not gonna cost you a damn thing.
[01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:03.750]  Like I said before, this will last me a hell of a long time.
[01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:06.350]  The only issue is that if I decide to use IMO two
[01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:08.910]  for my processes, eventually this will go down
[01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:10.350]  a lot quicker, right?
[01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:12.630]  Which means that I gotta go out and get more collections.
[01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.230]  And as Brian was talking about,
[01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.230]  hey, you're right, you put all these collections out
[01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:20.670]  and what happens if they don't go right?
[01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:23.350]  Well, now I feel like I'm wasting time or things like that.
[01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:27.150]  So I wanna make this last me as long as possible.
[01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:30.110]  So that way I can continue to get more and more IMO two
[01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:34.710]  collections and in turn diversify what I'm doing.
[01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:36.830]  This is a snapshot of what I picked up in the forest.
[01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:40.270]  But if I take this and then I take this one,
[01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:43.750]  now I have a little bit more diversity into my file.
[01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:46.350]  And then let's say I take this one and this one,
[01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:49.110]  now I have a little bit from all these four pieces
[01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:52.950]  when I'm making IMO three versus just using this one
[01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:55.250]  or just using this one or just using that one.
[01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:59.150]  So diversity is the name of the game.
[01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:01.910]  How do you use those Johnny,
[01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:04.470]  without not going to IMO three yet,
[01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:06.350]  but how do you use those for regular folks
[01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:09.190]  if they got one of these, tell them kind of how.
[01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.010]  A couple of ways.
[01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:12.030]  I mean, you can take what people were looking at
[01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:15.790]  as your traditional aerated compost tea, use that.
[01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:17.670]  You could also do it as an extract, right?
[01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:19.350]  Where you can just kind of break it up into the water,
[01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:21.690]  mix it in and then dump it into your beds.
[01:27:21.690 --> 01:27:23.790]  But realistically, you're gonna need a lot.
[01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:27.570]  So that's one way you could do it.
[01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:29.070]  But yeah, you could just grab a little handful of,
[01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:30.470]  I mean, I wouldn't put your hand into it
[01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:32.310]  cause your hands gonna be covered in other microbes.
[01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:36.910]  Get a clean spoon, put it in there, take some out,
[01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:39.410]  dump it into a mesh bag with the other stuff.
[01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:41.310]  However, you're doing your compost teas
[01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:44.050]  and you could use that, like that'll work.
[01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:46.150]  It's not gonna be as strong
[01:27:46.150 --> 01:27:48.030]  because we didn't grow them out, right?
[01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.590]  It's just what was in that spoon
[01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:51.990]  is all you're really gonna have.
[01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:55.190]  What you put in is what you're gonna get out essentially.
[01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:56.870]  So that's how you can use it.
[01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:59.030]  What I personally like to do is I like to take it
[01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.830]  and I make my IMO three.
[01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:04.590]  I think IMO three is probably my favorite one to use
[01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:06.990]  because of its storability.
[01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:11.590]  And then also because of the amount that you get for it.
[01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:16.050]  So when I make my IMO three, I will take,
[01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:20.030]  let's say maybe a tablespoon.
[01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.730]  Yeah, I'd say maybe about a tablespoon from each jar.
[01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:29.210]  And that's really all I'm using.
[01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:30.930]  And I put them back on my shelf.
[01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:35.810]  Versus if I'm making a compost tea now,
[01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.650]  I just took a tablespoon and use that.
[01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:40.530]  And I got one shot at it.
[01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:44.210]  Versus if I take a tablespoon and make IMO three,
[01:28:44.210 --> 01:28:47.990]  now I've made, let's say 50 pounds of it.
[01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:52.570]  And now that 50 pounds, I can lay across my entire yard
[01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.310]  or keep it in a sack and store it.
[01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:04.270]  Like all those, that teaspoon essentially made me that.
[01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:05.630]  This is a bad angle to show.
[01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:06.470]  I don't wanna make a mess,
[01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:09.050]  but you guys can kind of get the idea.
[01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:11.430]  This is all inoculated essentially.
[01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.590]  And now I can take a handful of that
[01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:18.590]  and make a compost tea or liquid IMO.
[01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:24.290]  And a teaspoon made me bags like this.
[01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:30.350]  All right, so now I can leave that IMO two on my shelf
[01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.310]  and not have to worry about it.
[01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:33.650]  I don't have to worry about running out
[01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:37.030]  in the next couple of weeks or need more for next season.
[01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:40.010]  Now I went out, collected one each season.
[01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.970]  They're sitting on my shelf
[01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:43.990]  and I'm gonna be using those for years on years.
[01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:46.430]  As I'm continuing to get more IMO twos,
[01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:48.350]  now I can diversify even more
[01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:52.550]  and take a little bit from each one and throw them all in.
[01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:54.830]  And then start growing my piles.
[01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:56.950]  So it's just trying to simplify things for yourself.
[01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:59.670]  So it's just, you don't have to put in more work.
[01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:01.310]  Collecting IMO is challenging
[01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:03.270]  as those of you that are new to it
[01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:05.070]  or have tried it or listening, as you see,
[01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:08.030]  it's like, I can't give you direct steps.
[01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:09.710]  I'm like, you need to do this, this, this,
[01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:10.990]  and this perfectly.
[01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:12.270]  It's all gonna be these.
[01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:14.670]  I can give you small guidelines
[01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:17.430]  and like these are the things that you can expect to see.
[01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:19.870]  These are things that might happen.
[01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:21.290]  If you see this, don't use that.
[01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.430]  If you see this, it's good.
[01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.870]  Those are all things that you have to use
[01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:27.710]  your sense of observation
[01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:33.390]  and your own intuition to kind of see for your own self.
[01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.550]  And that's where this whole piece of mindfulness comes.
[01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:36.510]  And that's why I really wanted to start
[01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.990]  with that exercise today.
[01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:39.830]  Because it really takes us to clear our mind
[01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:43.270]  and us to just look at this non-judgmentally
[01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:46.790]  to kind of see what it kind of takes for this process
[01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:48.830]  before we start throwing our own,
[01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:51.350]  I don't wanna call them like insecurities,
[01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:53.950]  but like our own thought process that comes
[01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:54.790]  and says, I can't do that.
[01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:55.610]  That's too hard.
[01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:59.090]  This is bad, or whatever the case is.
[01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.870]  To really clear our minds, being like, look,
[01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:03.610]  like we can do these processes.
[01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:07.990]  It's create less work for ourselves in a sense.
[01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.830]  So I guess-
[01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.910]  I think most, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:11.750]  I thought you were done.
[01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:12.570]  No, no, go for it, man.
[01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:13.410]  You're good.
[01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:14.930]  Well, I think most people,
[01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:17.110]  as long as they understand that it's difficult
[01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:19.350]  from day one, right?
[01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:23.030]  And maybe I was misguided.
[01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:24.430]  And sometimes when I was learning things,
[01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:27.070]  but they didn't make it seem like it was going
[01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:29.530]  to be as hard as it was to try to pull things off.
[01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:32.510]  So that was that one caveat that I do wanna give
[01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:33.670]  to the communities.
[01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.090]  You're listening to these two gentlemen.
[01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.190]  You're going to be able to minimize those risks
[01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:40.030]  so that this stuff really starts to take off
[01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:41.070]  for you right away.
[01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:44.630]  There definitely is a learning curve.
[01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.230]  I wouldn't say it's extremely difficult,
[01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:52.230]  but it takes patience and us putting our own judgments aside
[01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:56.590]  and really just trying to, if you wanna do this, do it.
[01:31:58.530 --> 01:31:59.590]  But it's gonna take some time.
[01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:01.070]  It's gonna take some failures,
[01:32:01.930 --> 01:32:04.350]  but these failures in a sense where we can call them failures
[01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:06.350]  lead to really opportunities to learn.
[01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.190]  And then we can kind of see,
[01:32:07.190 --> 01:32:09.090]  but that's why taking those notes are really important.
[01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.050]  Take those notes, figure out what works,
[01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.510]  what didn't work, why didn't it work, what happened,
[01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:15.790]  take pictures of it, document it.
[01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:16.950]  So that way, if you see that again,
[01:32:17.670 --> 01:32:19.350]  you're not gonna be like, oh, I know why that happened.
[01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:21.330]  Or I made this change, oh, okay,
[01:32:21.330 --> 01:32:22.510]  I know why this happened.
[01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:24.430]  You don't wanna make too many changes at once,
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:26.910]  but take the information that we're giving you
[01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:28.870]  and apply that so that way you can minimize,
[01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:32.590]  like Brian was saying, minimize that learning curve
[01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.670]  or make it drop that slope as much as possible.
[01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:38.750]  So that's IMO one and two.
[01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:40.510]  So sorry, that was a long segue back
[01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:43.010]  to what we were gonna talk about IMO three.
[01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:47.330]  But yeah, so IMO three is my favorite one to use
[01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:48.490]  for those reasons.
[01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:54.650]  And if you read a lot of stuff on KNF,
[01:32:54.650 --> 01:32:59.650]  they'll talk about using like basic, any kind of brand.
[01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:02.570]  I know Master Chose talked about using Rice brand,
[01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:07.290]  Mill Run, different things like that.
[01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:10.130]  Just whatever is accessible to your area.
[01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:13.730]  If you're out in a non-urban environment,
[01:33:13.730 --> 01:33:16.650]  in a rural area, animal feed stores are a great place
[01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:18.190]  to get stuff if you need them.
[01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.930]  That's kind of where I go.
[01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:23.050]  Like I'll have to drive out like 45 minutes to an hour
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:24.770]  to go to an animal feed store
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:27.910]  to go pick up some supplies that I use.
[01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:29.930]  But if you have stuff on your property, you can use,
[01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:32.130]  I know Marco, you were using some kind of leaves recently
[01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:33.690]  that you were able to kind of gather up.
[01:33:33.690 --> 01:33:35.370]  I don't have trees like that in my area,
[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:37.090]  so I don't have access to that.
[01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:42.170]  So each region is gonna kind of have its own material
[01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:44.130]  that'll work, but essentially you need something
[01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:46.190]  that's high in fat and protein,
[01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:51.490]  and then some kind of carbon source.
[01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:54.330]  The carbon source really helps to aerate the pile.
[01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:57.050]  I've noticed that if I use straight Rice brand,
[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.850]  I just get huge clumps.
[01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:00.350]  And you're like, oh yeah, I have all these clumps
[01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:01.930]  of microbes, and in reality, in the inside,
[01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:05.590]  it's just soaking wet and it's gone completely anaerobic.
[01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:09.350]  So that's just something to consider.
[01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:11.850]  So I like using a mixture of things,
[01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:13.610]  something that's gonna provide food,
[01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.530]  and then also sometimes gonna provide some level of fluff
[01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:20.690]  to allow air and the microbes to kind of breathe
[01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:23.610]  in the center of that pile to kind of keep things moving
[01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:25.170]  in the right direction.
[01:34:25.170 --> 01:34:27.490]  And we can talk about the ingredients that I like to use,
[01:34:27.490 --> 01:34:29.450]  and I'm sure Marco probably has a list of stuff
[01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:32.610]  that he likes to use, but that's kind of like the base of it.
[01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:36.510]  The idea is that we're taking the IMO2 that we had,
[01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:38.390]  and we're growing it out on a substrate
[01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:41.590]  so we can make the IMO2 last a lot longer.
[01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:44.830]  And then now we have a dry meal type form
[01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:47.330]  or something that we could either make a tea with,
[01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:51.110]  or we can lay it out on the land essentially
[01:34:51.110 --> 01:34:53.070]  and allow that to, in a sense,
[01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:55.110]  inoculate the area that we're growing in.
[01:34:57.750 --> 01:35:02.070]  Yeah, like basically IMO3 now, we're taking that IMO2
[01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:04.190]  and we're just multiplying that big time,
[01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:08.110]  by thousands and thousands of times,
[01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:10.510]  and we end up with that IMO3.
[01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:13.750]  I like to source different ingredients.
[01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:16.710]  If I'm just doing my base IMO3,
[01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:21.110]  and a easy one that someone can go down to Tractor Supply,
[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:24.670]  you can get a bag of partially cracked grains,
[01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:29.130]  I'm sorry, cracked grains or partially rolled oats,
[01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:32.270]  and then get a rice bran.
[01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:35.350]  And so those are my two of my three.
[01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:39.790]  And then what I like to do, I use well-aged wood chips,
[01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:41.550]  and I would only recommend these chips.
[01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:44.030]  These are really soft wood chips that you could,
[01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.350]  you could take them and squeeze moisture out of them,
[01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:48.190]  you know, with your fingers, like really age.
[01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:50.350]  I wouldn't go anything fresh wood chips
[01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:51.990]  or anything like that.
[01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:53.830]  So I do a third, a third, and a third,
[01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:56.710]  and then I'll use those natural farming inputs
[01:35:56.710 --> 01:35:58.950]  along with the IMO2 as Johnny said,
[01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:01.470]  and then I will wet this pile inoculating.
[01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:04.350]  I always like to do a little bit of a,
[01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:06.910]  not, I call it a, not a mystery ingredient,
[01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:08.110]  but a special ingredient.
[01:36:08.110 --> 01:36:11.430]  Like, so this time Brian and I got together
[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:14.790]  along with kind of the needs for his, you know,
[01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:19.070]  trying to get, hit that bio, biodiverse soil,
[01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:21.310]  believe that's what it's called.
[01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:23.230]  Bioactive is what they call it.
[01:36:23.230 --> 01:36:24.470]  Bioactive soil.
[01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:25.830]  Okay, so bioactive soil.
[01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:28.870]  And to me that's similar to our living soil.
[01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:32.230]  And what I wanna do is I'm trying to create an IMO3
[01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:35.830]  that can be used in like a reptile terrarium.
[01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:39.270]  So I want it to be active enough,
[01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:41.390]  and it's also gonna have some shredders
[01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:42.670]  and it's gonna have springtails
[01:36:42.670 --> 01:36:43.910]  and all that kind of stuff in it
[01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:45.190]  when I'm done blending it.
[01:36:45.190 --> 01:36:47.390]  But I want that to be like a living floor
[01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:49.430]  for these reptile terrariums.
[01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:52.030]  And similar to like how we do no-smell pig farming
[01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.990]  in natural farming.
[01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:55.870]  It's just an experimental thing.
[01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:56.950]  We're gonna try it out.
[01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:58.550]  I think it's doable.
[01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:00.390]  It would really depend on the thickness.
[01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:01.790]  I think I can get it in there,
[01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:04.590]  but the whole point is I wanna use that microbiology
[01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:09.030]  and that IMO3 to break down those wastes
[01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:10.750]  in that reptile terrarium,
[01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:15.270]  just like they would in a forest soil.
[01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:17.230]  Break those things down, neutralize them,
[01:37:17.230 --> 01:37:19.750]  and then just like in our soil,
[01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:23.590]  turn them into a beneficial by-product.
[01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:24.430]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:25.750]  And then in the terrarium side,
[01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.030]  it'd be something that doesn't smell.
[01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:31.150]  So yeah, just kind of my two cents on how I start a pile.
[01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:32.350]  There's easy ways to do it.
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:33.950]  Like Johnny said, track their supply
[01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:38.230]  and as a horse feed places, look for good quality.
[01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:39.230]  That's one way to do it.
[01:37:39.230 --> 01:37:41.710]  So yeah, well, take us on through the process, Johnny.
[01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:42.870]  So you kind of got your pile,
[01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:45.030]  you get your dry ingredients.
[01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:50.030]  Yeah, so I like using rolled oats
[01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:53.430]  and it wasn't until I started diving into this
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:55.550]  that I realized that rolled oats are not rolled oats.
[01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:57.990]  Like there's different types of rolled oats,
[01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:59.230]  even though they're all called rolled oats.
[01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:01.790]  That itself was a learning curve.
[01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:05.070]  What you buy at the grocery store is rolled oats
[01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:09.590]  are like extremely rolled oats and they de-hust them
[01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:12.630]  and they remove all the other pieces from it.
[01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:15.590]  If you go to track your supply or a feed store
[01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:19.670]  and you buy rolled oats, they still sprout,
[01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:21.390]  which you would think that they're supposed to be rolled,
[01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:22.790]  right, so they shouldn't sprout at all,
[01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:24.550]  but they still somehow do.
[01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:28.230]  I finally found one that I liked the texture of
[01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:30.110]  that actually looked rolled,
[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:32.230]  but it still had the outside,
[01:38:32.230 --> 01:38:33.870]  almost kind of looked like a rice hole
[01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:35.070]  that was like kind of stuck on the outside
[01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:36.310]  based on the whole of it.
[01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:39.270]  So it added a really nice texture to it.
[01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:40.590]  But the reason I like them broken up
[01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:43.430]  is because they absorb the liquid a lot easier.
[01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:48.430]  If you, what I've noticed that if I've used crimped oats,
[01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:53.110]  for instance, they don't absorb the liquid.
[01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:56.670]  So all the liquid gets taken up by the rice bran
[01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:57.830]  if it's all mixed together
[01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:59.430]  because the rice bran will suck up the moisture
[01:38:59.430 --> 01:39:00.830]  extremely fast.
[01:39:02.150 --> 01:39:05.030]  So finding the right material in that regard
[01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.990]  was a little bit of a challenge,
[01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:10.790]  but yeah, I like using rolled oats as my main food source.
[01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:12.070]  Rice bran is my second.
[01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:17.070]  I usually use that at about 25% of the total carb volume.
[01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:20.490]  Reason being is because that stuff,
[01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:21.550]  I mean, if you have the time for it,
[01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:23.270]  by all means, you could use all rice bran,
[01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:25.110]  but man, that stuff heats up quick.
[01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:30.270]  It'll, you won't sleep day one and two, have fun.
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:32.470]  Actually, I'll say day three or four, depending,
[01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:35.430]  because day one and two, it still takes time to warm up.
[01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:38.190]  But that heating process, man, once it's off to the races,
[01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.670]  like you're babying that pile for the next week,
[01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.590]  every couple of hours, depending,
[01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:44.710]  especially when you're first learning,
[01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:46.230]  every one or two hours,
[01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.550]  you're gonna be flipping that damn pile,
[01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:50.310]  depending on how much moisture and stuff you put into it.
[01:39:51.710 --> 01:39:52.990]  But yeah, that's what I like using.
[01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:56.750]  And then I'll usually use pine shavings
[01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.910]  when I don't have access to like a chip drop
[01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:04.470]  or the type of wood chips that I would like to use,
[01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:06.490]  or depending on like the size of the material.
[01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:08.950]  So for instance, if someone lives in an urban environment,
[01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:11.790]  you don't have any raw material to use,
[01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:15.010]  rolled oats would be great, rice bran's great,
[01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:19.270]  animal bedding, basically like your pine shavings would work
[01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:21.430]  and that's essentially what you need, right?
[01:40:21.710 --> 01:40:23.710]  The shavings are gonna help fluff it up,
[01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:26.770]  the rice bran will kind of be that quick start fuel,
[01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:27.990]  that gas to get it going,
[01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:29.750]  and then the oats will be something
[01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:32.670]  that kind of gives it time, that longer food,
[01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:34.990]  is what I have found to work for me.
[01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:38.710]  Moisture's the big piece that you wanna kind of play with.
[01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:40.390]  But yeah, that's essentially the material.
[01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:42.910]  And then in that, you're adding in your OHN.
[01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:44.630]  If you have it, if you don't have OHN,
[01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:46.190]  you don't need to have it.
[01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:49.750]  It's not a hard set fast requirement.
[01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:52.250]  Big piece of natural farming is use what you have.
[01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:58.510]  FPJ, if you have it, your vinegar,
[01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:00.230]  you don't wanna use distilled vinegar,
[01:41:00.230 --> 01:41:02.750]  you'd wanna use ideally brown rice vinegar.
[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:05.590]  If you don't have that, apple cider vinegar would work
[01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:10.130]  or a fruit vinegar that you've made on your own.
[01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.710]  I've started making my own vinegars
[01:41:12.710 --> 01:41:16.330]  and that just cuts another cost out for me completely.
[01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:19.170]  So if you can make your own vinegar,
[01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:20.870]  I would roll with that personally.
[01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:23.610]  Sea water is another piece.
[01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:26.210]  You want those added minerals into it.
[01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:28.210]  If you don't live near a coast
[01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:30.610]  and you don't have access to seawater,
[01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:33.650]  C90 is a great alternative.
[01:41:33.650 --> 01:41:35.950]  And you can basically take the C90
[01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:40.250]  and you can either take the salt itself
[01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:44.090]  and drop some into the water to make that one to 30 ratio,
[01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:46.170]  or you can add enough of that
[01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:49.270]  to where you create a bottle of seawater
[01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.810]  and then use that one to 30 into the mixture.
[01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:54.650]  I'd have to take a look at my notes
[01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:57.430]  to see what the exact breakdown is.
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:42:00.970]  I believe it's about one gram of salt
[01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:04.450]  to one liter of water creates the salinity of blood,
[01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:06.710]  which is what you're looking for for one to 30.
[01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:11.310]  So if you don't wanna have a jug of seawater sitting around,
[01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:12.570]  you could just have the dry form
[01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:16.450]  and then just basically weigh out one gram per liter
[01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:18.810]  and then add that into your water.
[01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:21.750]  And that would create the seawater ratio
[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:22.950]  that you're looking for.
[01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:25.970]  So what else am I missing?
[01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:28.530]  Oh, humic acid is another big one as well.
[01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:30.290]  That's a big fungal food,
[01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:32.450]  especially also if you're using chlorinated water
[01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:34.530]  or city tap water,
[01:42:34.530 --> 01:42:37.510]  the humic acid will break down the chloramine.
[01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:40.850]  I forget the process of what it does,
[01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:43.350]  but it basically unbinds the chloramine,
[01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:45.290]  whatever those two molecules are,
[01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:46.490]  allows one to gas off
[01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:48.610]  and the other one just becomes inert in a sense.
[01:42:48.610 --> 01:42:50.250]  And then same thing,
[01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:51.850]  the chlorine that's in there will dissipate out
[01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:52.970]  if you let it just bubble out
[01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:55.410]  or let it sit for about 24 hours.
[01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:57.710]  What else am I missing?
[01:42:59.050 --> 01:43:00.530]  Mark, was that about it?
[01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:01.730]  I'm running through my head and I'm like,
[01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:02.570]  I don't know what that is.
[01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:04.490]  I don't put FAA in there.
[01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:06.810]  No, no, no, no, no FAA.
[01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:09.370]  Yeah, yeah, that's about right.
[01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:12.330]  Yeah, and then you just wanna kind of mix these.
[01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:13.570]  That's your solution now.
[01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:16.210]  Now you wanna take that and wet your grains.
[01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:17.290]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.290]  Now, one piece of that too,
[01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:21.130]  when you're doing that is
[01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:23.290]  you're gonna have your dry material.
[01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:25.330]  You wanna make sure that it's well mixed.
[01:43:27.690 --> 01:43:28.770]  Once it's well mixed,
[01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:31.270]  you're gonna measure out of amount of water.
[01:43:32.250 --> 01:43:33.890]  This is something that you're gonna have to play with.
[01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:35.970]  I can't tell you how much water to use.
[01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:39.330]  Basically, you don't want it to drip
[01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:42.930]  and I would add small amounts of water to start with
[01:43:42.930 --> 01:43:46.330]  and then add more as you start learning more with this.
[01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:49.210]  Because if not, you will be up all damn night
[01:43:49.210 --> 01:43:52.650]  turning your pile because you need to keep the temperatures
[01:43:52.650 --> 01:43:56.370]  under 120 degrees or in that range.
[01:43:58.290 --> 01:44:00.210]  Can we go a little deeper on that, fellas?
[01:44:00.210 --> 01:44:03.450]  Like why you have to wake up and why that's so important?
[01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:05.850]  Well, let me just get to you on the moisture right quick.
[01:44:05.850 --> 01:44:08.090]  Just so a good rule of thumb for moisture
[01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:09.450]  when you're working on these piles
[01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:12.010]  is take a handful of it and squeeze it.
[01:44:12.010 --> 01:44:14.070]  And then you just wanna see a little bit of water
[01:44:14.070 --> 01:44:16.330]  starting to glisten out of these knuckles.
[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:20.370]  So that's just a good way for moisture content in my opinion.
[01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.290]  Just barely, not even dripping,
[01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:25.250]  but just barely kind of seeping into them knuckles.
[01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:27.410]  Let's see if that's too wet for me.
[01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:31.250]  I've done that before and my shit just runs.
[01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:33.450]  So I even try to go a little less than that.
[01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:37.250]  Like I clump it up.
[01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:39.610]  And as I clump it up in my hand,
[01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:43.610]  if it'll hold somewhat together, that's all I go with.
[01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:45.450]  If I bounce it and it starts falling apart, cool.
[01:44:45.450 --> 01:44:47.810]  But as soon as I start getting water out of my knuckles,
[01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:50.650]  for me and my system, it's been too wet.
[01:44:50.650 --> 01:44:51.610]  Well, like I said,
[01:44:51.610 --> 01:44:54.130]  we're not getting any water out of the knuckles.
[01:44:54.130 --> 01:44:56.810]  We're just getting, when you open your hand back up,
[01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:58.010]  it'll be wet in there.
[01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:00.650]  So that's what I'm on.
[01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:03.090]  That seems to work, you know what I mean, here.
[01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:04.690]  So that just tells you right there,
[01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:06.810]  two different people doing it two different ways
[01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:08.210]  and it seems to work.
[01:45:08.210 --> 01:45:11.730]  So, you know, find your way.
[01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:17.290]  And Brian, you asked about the temperature.
[01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:18.650]  Is that what you're asking?
[01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:20.570]  Yeah, part of it.
[01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:25.570]  Just kind of understanding, yeah, like best practices.
[01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:28.610]  Got it.
[01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:33.610]  So my mentors have taught me to keep it roughly about 120
[01:45:33.610 --> 01:45:35.250]  is when you wanna be turning the pile.
[01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:37.890]  You start losing diversity in a pile
[01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:40.330]  once it gets above that, right?
[01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:43.010]  If you think about your traditional compost piles,
[01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:44.770]  that the thermophilic, that heat up to what?
[01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:47.850]  It's like 140, 145, 50, something like that.
[01:45:48.810 --> 01:45:51.970]  The idea is that you're trying to kill everything
[01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:53.450]  because you wanna essentially kill it.
[01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:55.890]  So that way things will break down.
[01:45:55.890 --> 01:45:59.190]  You kill the bad stuff, the seeds, whatever the case is.
[01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:02.010]  But in a sense, you're losing diversity in that process.
[01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:03.650]  And then you let it sit and mature.
[01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:05.810]  That's where kind of everything comes back.
[01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:08.650]  But in this process, we're not decomposing anything.
[01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:09.530]  We're growing it.
[01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:11.610]  So we need to keep it in a temperature range
[01:46:11.610 --> 01:46:14.290]  that allows the microbes to thrive.
[01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:17.610]  And once it gets too hot, you start losing diversity.
[01:46:17.610 --> 01:46:19.610]  It'll start changing in smell as well.
[01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:25.810]  So yeah, that's kind of, I would say between like
[01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:30.710]  above 110 to 120, if it sits in that range,
[01:46:31.810 --> 01:46:33.050]  I would just let it ride.
[01:46:33.730 --> 01:46:35.570]  Let it go and don't turn it too much
[01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:37.930]  because you're right there in that sweet spot.
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:39.250]  At least what I have found.
[01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:42.370]  Mark, what about for me from your experience
[01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:43.350]  temperature wise?
[01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:47.370]  Yeah, man, I'm about the same with you, Johnny.
[01:46:47.370 --> 01:46:52.370]  I go 125 is my number and that's just where I'm at.
[01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:55.250]  But yeah, temperature, man, is key.
[01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:56.710]  The point is I don't even wanna be,
[01:46:56.710 --> 01:46:58.050]  I wanna be in the 20s.
[01:46:58.050 --> 01:46:59.370]  That's where I'm feeling good.
[01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:01.050]  25 is my high spot.
[01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:03.550]  So I don't wanna start getting too close to that.
[01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:07.450]  Yes, IMO3, man, is pretty wild.
[01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:09.650]  Cause like I said, I'm on day four on one.
[01:47:09.650 --> 01:47:11.210]  I just started here recently.
[01:47:11.210 --> 01:47:12.370]  The one with Brian and I are doing.
[01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:14.370]  And what I was, I kind of lost my train of thought
[01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:17.610]  on the other deal, but my special ingredient this time
[01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:19.610]  is the magnolia leaves.
[01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:22.370]  So I'm doing the, I did the rice bran,
[01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:27.370]  the cracked grains, and then I used magnolia leaves.
[01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:30.610]  So that's gonna be the one I'm working on now.
[01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:32.650]  And that thing has an awesome smell to it, man.
[01:47:32.650 --> 01:47:34.610]  It just smells like so amazing.
[01:47:34.610 --> 01:47:36.650]  It's got that yeast smell that we normally get,
[01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:39.690]  but then these magnolia leaves are just pumping out
[01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:40.610]  something, man.
[01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:42.690]  I mean, it smells almost turpy.
[01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:43.530]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:46.370]  Once it gets done, I'll send some folks a sample.
[01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:48.970]  And if you want a sample, I'll send you one, Johnny.
[01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:52.650]  But yeah, temperatures for me are key.
[01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:53.770]  Just to give you an idea,
[01:47:53.770 --> 01:47:56.090]  just to catch you up to where I'm at on day four here.
[01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:58.970]  So day one, I made this mix.
[01:47:59.010 --> 01:48:01.290]  Ambient temperatures outside were pretty cold.
[01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:03.770]  I think it was 30 something degrees.
[01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:06.610]  I knew that I had three warm days coming up,
[01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:08.210]  which is the days I'm in right now.
[01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:09.890]  Like today it was 60 something.
[01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:11.290]  Yesterday it was 60 something.
[01:48:11.290 --> 01:48:14.130]  Tomorrow, I think it's gonna start dropping.
[01:48:14.130 --> 01:48:15.930]  So I went ahead and started this pile.
[01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:19.970]  And just based on that, first two days,
[01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:22.890]  temperature stayed super low, but it was 50.
[01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:26.370]  The pile temperature was like 52.
[01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:29.090]  But ambient temperature was 30s.
[01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:32.010]  So that told me, even though if I put my hand
[01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:34.530]  in this pile at 50, it's cold,
[01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:37.250]  it still had microbial activity.
[01:48:37.250 --> 01:48:41.050]  So a lot of people say, man, turn that IMO
[01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:43.210]  no matter what after 24 hours.
[01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:45.050]  Well, I don't think that's always true
[01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:47.010]  because in this case, I did not turn it
[01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:48.770]  because had I turned it,
[01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:51.810]  now I could have probably took that 50 degree pile I had
[01:48:51.810 --> 01:48:55.410]  and now took it to ambient temperature, lost all activity.
[01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:57.610]  So I wrote it out.
[01:48:57.610 --> 01:49:01.610]  The next morning, outdoor temperature started going up.
[01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:03.530]  Like I said, the weather would.
[01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:06.690]  And then now my internal pile temperature also went up,
[01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:08.890]  but it went up more than ambient.
[01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:12.930]  So say if ambient went up 10, my pile went up like 15.
[01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:15.570]  Now I'm saying, all right, I'm at 60 something,
[01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:18.410]  like 65 ish or 67.
[01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:20.210]  67 in the pile.
[01:49:20.210 --> 01:49:24.650]  Outdoors is like right there too, watching it.
[01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:27.850]  All right, a few hours later, boom, now I'm above ambient.
[01:49:27.850 --> 01:49:30.890]  Now my pile is actually warmer than outside temperature.
[01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:32.410]  Now I know I'm cruising.
[01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:34.290]  Okay, now you gotta really watch that pile
[01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:36.690]  because you know it's cooking, it's going.
[01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:40.130]  So what happened was I went,
[01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:43.610]  I turned it yesterday morning, it got up to 120s.
[01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:48.450]  Turned it and went back to like 117.
[01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:53.850]  Two, three hours later, bumped back up to 121.
[01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:55.730]  Watching it instead of turning it
[01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:59.090]  because I have this big, I got layers of cover over it.
[01:49:59.090 --> 01:50:00.370]  I guess I didn't say that part.
[01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.090]  I just took some of my layers of cover off.
[01:50:03.090 --> 01:50:04.930]  I was close to my 125.
[01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:07.010]  I didn't wanna be there with that cover on.
[01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:10.850]  So I popped that off, dropped me back to 118.
[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:13.770]  So the point I'm trying to make is these piles,
[01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:17.930]  they take a little bit of strategy and planning.
[01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:20.770]  Like plan when you wanna start it based on the weather.
[01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:21.610]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:23.130]  Look at it, if it's gonna be super cold,
[01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:24.250]  you might not wanna start it.
[01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:29.250]  If you get a warm spell in the winter, start one then.
[01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:31.050]  But, and also another thing I noticed, Johnny,
[01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:32.810]  is when I start the pile is critical
[01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:35.090]  because in the summer months,
[01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:39.930]  usually at around that 24 to 30 something hours
[01:50:39.930 --> 01:50:42.250]  when it really starts blazing.
[01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:44.930]  So if you started at the wrong time of day,
[01:50:44.930 --> 01:50:48.010]  that point could be at two or three in the morning, see?
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:49.610]  So you wanna try to start your pile,
[01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:51.650]  even if you got started at nine at night
[01:50:51.650 --> 01:50:53.930]  or something late or weird,
[01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:58.930]  start it in a way that it starts acting up on your time,
[01:50:58.930 --> 01:51:00.250]  like when I'm up and about.
[01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:04.330]  And so you kinda, little things you can do to help
[01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:07.530]  kinda guide that pile and think ahead on it.
[01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:08.930]  That was a gold truck, dude.
[01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:10.410]  I couldn't agree more, man.
[01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:13.010]  I don't make, I do not start piles in the morning
[01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:14.810]  because that 36 hour mark will hit me
[01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:15.810]  right in the middle of the night.
[01:51:15.810 --> 01:51:18.890]  I start my piles right before I go to bed
[01:51:19.770 --> 01:51:20.930]  or like in the evening time.
[01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:22.610]  The last pile that I made,
[01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:26.410]  I have a full video of me making it on my Instagram.
[01:51:26.410 --> 01:51:27.650]  Like it's an hour and a half long.
[01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:30.050]  I'm literally just, I was doing live
[01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.370]  and I just showed what I made.
[01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:33.210]  I saw it, I can see that.
[01:51:33.210 --> 01:51:35.050]  Yeah, and I made in the evening time.
[01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:37.610]  So when it hits that mark, it's when I'm waking up,
[01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:42.010]  that day, 36 hours later.
[01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:44.570]  So that way I can turn it at that point.
[01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:46.130]  So that's typically when you'll see that crank.
[01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:49.730]  So if not, you're gonna be up all damn night.
[01:51:49.730 --> 01:51:52.210]  That's one thing with IMO three is,
[01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:54.410]  that's where the learning curve comes in is,
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:57.370]  figuring out that moisture content
[01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:59.530]  of what works for you and your environment.
[01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:04.970]  So that way you can actually sleep
[01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:06.530]  and spend time with your loved ones
[01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:08.850]  versus having to baby this pile
[01:52:08.850 --> 01:52:10.290]  for the next week and a half.
[01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:13.950]  It definitely, are you still running the wifi?
[01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:15.850]  Yeah, I am.
[01:52:15.850 --> 01:52:16.690]  I'll show you guys real quick.
[01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:17.530]  Yeah.
[01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:20.250]  I've been debating that.
[01:52:20.250 --> 01:52:22.650]  I've been under control right now.
[01:52:22.650 --> 01:52:23.770]  So I'm all right.
[01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.730]  This thing is a lifesaver.
[01:52:27.690 --> 01:52:29.850]  I'll show you guys where it's an Inkbird.
[01:52:31.170 --> 01:52:32.010]  What's her name?
[01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:34.650]  Wendy, oh my God, what's her last name?
[01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:35.970]  Cornbread.
[01:52:35.970 --> 01:52:38.810]  Yeah, she goes by Senebis on IG.
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:40.930]  She introduced this to me,
[01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:42.130]  or a bunch of people in the community.
[01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:42.970]  And I saw it and I was like,
[01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:44.970]  oh my God, this is a game changer.
[01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:46.010]  So prior to this,
[01:52:46.050 --> 01:52:48.290]  I was just using your compost thermometer.
[01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:49.810]  I think I have one somewhere on here.
[01:52:49.810 --> 01:52:51.290]  But basically, I mean, you guys know what that is.
[01:52:51.290 --> 01:52:52.650]  Just a thermometer.
[01:52:52.650 --> 01:52:53.730]  So every couple of hours,
[01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:55.170]  I would just have to set an alarm on my phone.
[01:52:55.170 --> 01:52:57.330]  It's like, all right, I gotta get up and go check it.
[01:52:57.330 --> 01:53:00.010]  Now with this thing, it has four probes.
[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:02.450]  I plug my probes into the pile
[01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:04.790]  and it'll register to my phone.
[01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:08.410]  I set the temperature on here.
[01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:10.730]  It's like, okay, max at 125.
[01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.610]  So as soon as this thing hits 125 degrees,
[01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:15.350]  boom, my phone blows up.
[01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:17.550]  And then I get up, I'll go flip it,
[01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:20.510]  put my probes back in, and go on to carry on with my day.
[01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:21.710]  And then that way, the cool thing is
[01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:23.750]  I can actually monitor on my phone.
[01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:25.990]  It'll show me a chart and I can see the slope of the line
[01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:27.210]  of how quick it's increasing.
[01:53:27.210 --> 01:53:28.750]  So if I see it's increasing,
[01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:31.190]  you know, every 15 minutes it's going up like a degree.
[01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:32.470]  So I'm like, okay, shit.
[01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:33.790]  I got maybe 20, 30 minutes
[01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:36.190]  before I'm gonna have to flip this thing again.
[01:53:36.190 --> 01:53:38.270]  Or if I see it's a very, very slow increase,
[01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:40.030]  I'm like, okay, I know I'll be able to draw this out
[01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:42.590]  and I can deal with that in a couple of hours.
[01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:44.550]  So this has been helpful.
[01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:46.150]  I would highly recommend it.
[01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:46.990]  Yeah, that's dope.
[01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:49.350]  Especially for the, definitely for the young,
[01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:51.670]  the new person.
[01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:54.070]  See, so what he did with that little machine right there
[01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:57.150]  is he just kind of shortcutted all the things
[01:53:57.150 --> 01:53:59.350]  I've been doing, like all my strategy, you know what I mean?
[01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:01.110]  But that's part of the fun of it for me.
[01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:03.110]  Like I think the pile's a challenge.
[01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:04.350]  I like to be hands-on.
[01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:05.710]  She becomes alive.
[01:54:05.710 --> 01:54:08.710]  She becomes something that I love, you know what I mean?
[01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:11.510]  And I just baby and nurture.
[01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:13.590]  But like you said, you gotta plan her out, man,
[01:54:13.630 --> 01:54:16.270]  because she will run your ass crazy.
[01:54:16.270 --> 01:54:18.870]  Even before the show, I went out there and turned it
[01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:20.590]  and I lowered it a little bit.
[01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:23.270]  And what I mean by that is I lowered the height of it,
[01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:24.350]  because if you think about it,
[01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:29.030]  a taller, more dense pile is gonna create more heat.
[01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:30.230]  Those are ways, by the way,
[01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:32.070]  if you want to adjust your temperature,
[01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:35.270]  you kind of lower that pile and then raise it up.
[01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:37.670]  And if I lower it and flatten it out,
[01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:39.990]  it's gonna give me a lot cooler pile
[01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:41.430]  and not heat up as fast.
[01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:42.750]  So those are little tips and tricks.
[01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:44.390]  And I would do that too sometimes,
[01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:46.510]  like, man, I don't want to come back over here at night,
[01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:48.590]  like when I make a pile at my property.
[01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:52.070]  So I just go as late as I could,
[01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:53.590]  check that temperature,
[01:54:53.590 --> 01:54:56.910]  and then lower her down to as thin as I think it'll be,
[01:54:56.910 --> 01:55:00.750]  it's good without losing that temperature,
[01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:01.590]  you know what I mean?
[01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:04.830]  And then usually that could be around six inches even,
[01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:06.550]  as low as six to eight inches.
[01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:09.710]  Right now, you know, and on an average pile,
[01:55:09.710 --> 01:55:12.350]  you might be at 20 to knee high
[01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:15.510]  on a height of average IMO pile.
[01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:17.670]  So just something to think about,
[01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:18.990]  getting that temperature up and down
[01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:21.190]  is raising and lowering the height of your pile too.
[01:55:21.190 --> 01:55:23.070]  Yeah, adding carbon too.
[01:55:23.070 --> 01:55:24.390]  You could always add a little bit more carbon
[01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:25.830]  to the pile as well.
[01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:27.150]  That'll help with some of the moisture.
[01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:29.450]  And if you've added a little too much moisture,
[01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:31.830]  that's been helpful just to find a product
[01:55:31.830 --> 01:55:34.470]  that's a little bit more carbon material.
[01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:36.790]  But I mean, the idea is that you're gonna take that,
[01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:40.190]  if you decide to make IMO four or store it with IMO three.
[01:55:41.230 --> 01:55:42.790]  One thing I forgot to mention before too,
[01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:44.830]  is I made this mistake when I was first starting off,
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:46.390]  when I was trying to find rice bran,
[01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:47.750]  is look at the ingredients.
[01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:50.430]  Just because something says that it's rice bran,
[01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:51.750]  doesn't mean that that's the only thing in there.
[01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:53.530]  I bought a rice bran with molasses in it,
[01:55:53.530 --> 01:55:55.110]  that kicked my ass.
[01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:59.030]  Just think about like you have the rice bran,
[01:55:59.030 --> 01:56:01.830]  and then you just spike the shit ton of sugar in there,
[01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:05.570]  like man, it was off to the races very quickly.
[01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:09.030]  Which is good if that's what you're looking for,
[01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:10.750]  but with this pile that you're trying to finesse,
[01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:14.110]  and take your time with, and do it over the week or two.
[01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:17.430]  Yeah, it just heats up too quickly,
[01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:20.030]  and you're gonna be up all damn night trying to flip that.
[01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:22.270]  So just make sure you look at the ingredients,
[01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:24.090]  and that it's just rice bran,
[01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:26.630]  or whatever the material is that you're looking for.
[01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:29.270]  You don't want added molasses in there, period.
[01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:31.870]  Yeah, I noticed some of the horse feeds
[01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:32.710]  and things like that,
[01:56:32.710 --> 01:56:35.150]  they'll have calcium carbonate will be in it too.
[01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:37.910]  Some of those things are not bad at all,
[01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:40.510]  you just have to know what they are,
[01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:42.230]  what's in there, and work accordingly.
[01:56:42.230 --> 01:56:43.590]  The rice bran that I have,
[01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:44.710]  the one that I have has a little bit
[01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:46.350]  of calcium carbonate in it.
[01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:47.710]  It's a stabilized rice bran,
[01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:50.950]  which is what most people kind of get a hold of.
[01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:54.590]  But yeah, molasses is the one that you don't want in there.
[01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:56.750]  Definitely, you gotta watch that with alfalfa too,
[01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:59.950]  because what they do is they'll spray a little molasses
[01:56:59.950 --> 01:57:01.790]  in that stuff, because think about it,
[01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:04.310]  just like dog treats, if your dog likes a treat,
[01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:05.670]  you're gonna buy more treats.
[01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:07.830]  Your horse likes this oat, or whatever,
[01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:10.310]  with the sweet molasses, you're gonna buy more.
[01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:12.990]  So they do things like that to kind of flavor up
[01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:15.870]  even horse feeds, so something to think about.
[01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:18.390]  Absolutely.
[01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:19.590]  Mark, when you do your piles,
[01:57:19.590 --> 01:57:22.270]  you do them outside or you do them inside?
[01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:26.110]  I'm outside, baby, I'm on the ground, I got pits.
[01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:28.350]  I got my pit under my porch,
[01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:30.150]  at my house is where I'm at right now,
[01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.990]  and I got my pit over on my property.
[01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:35.750]  What I call pit, guys, is where that's that dry spot
[01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:39.670]  on the ground where you make your IMO piles.
[01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:40.910]  You know what I mean?
[01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:42.070]  You can make them indoors,
[01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:45.750]  Johnny's dialing that in, being good at it, that's fine.
[01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:47.970]  For me, I like that contact with the earth.
[01:57:47.970 --> 01:57:50.830]  I have the space, I have that ability,
[01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:52.410]  so I'm thankful I can.
[01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:55.550]  To me, that helps you control your pile a little better,
[01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:57.830]  helps control that moisture when you're turning it.
[01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:59.630]  You're also turning up some of the soil,
[01:57:59.630 --> 01:58:01.310]  some of the earth underneath.
[01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:04.470]  I protect my pit, my pit when I'm not using it,
[01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:08.590]  my pits are covered up with tarps,
[01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:11.430]  and you don't go walking over there on it.
[01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:12.670]  That's my IMO pit.
[01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:16.270]  That's a place that's very rich in biology, rich in life.
[01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:18.710]  You could take a rice box and set it right on that pit,
[01:58:18.710 --> 01:58:21.910]  and you can get busy right there.
[01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:22.910]  You know what I mean?
[01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:24.830]  Your pit is a very important space
[01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:26.110]  and something to work on.
[01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:28.870]  And so to answer that in a long way,
[01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:30.150]  no, Johnny, I do not, brother.
[01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:32.750]  But I have done them in coolers before,
[01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:35.190]  just IMO2 collections,
[01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:38.350]  but I've never done that IMO3 pile indoors
[01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:41.710]  because I just felt like that was gonna be a tough,
[01:58:41.710 --> 01:58:42.550]  tough go.
[01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:43.510]  Yeah, I would do that.
[01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:46.030]  I mean, ideally, man, I would do it outdoors.
[01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:48.350]  If I had the space to do it, that's where I'd love to.
[01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:49.870]  Well, talk to the people on that,
[01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:52.150]  on how you got your setup for indoor, man,
[01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:53.750]  because I got respect for it,
[01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:54.830]  and I like how you're doing it.
[01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:56.670]  You're doing it in a proper way, in my opinion.
[01:58:56.670 --> 01:58:58.510]  Not that my opinion means a lot,
[01:58:58.550 --> 01:59:00.230]  but I like what you're doing.
[01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:01.070]  Maybe it could help my group.
[01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:02.190]  I appreciate that.
[01:59:02.190 --> 01:59:05.910]  When I first started diving into some of the K&F stuff
[01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:07.950]  and the IMO collections,
[01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:09.910]  I was able, my last property,
[01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:13.590]  I was able to do it outside.
[01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:16.110]  And I really liked how that worked.
[01:59:16.110 --> 01:59:19.910]  I felt like something about the shift in temperature
[01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:23.790]  from the day and the dew had a big impact
[01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:27.310]  on the way that the pile finished out and looked.
[01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:30.710]  I really liked that aspect of it,
[01:59:30.710 --> 01:59:33.470]  but I don't necessarily have that luxury at the moment.
[01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:37.630]  If you own a property,
[01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:41.670]  I would not recommend doing this inside.
[01:59:41.670 --> 01:59:44.510]  Just think about the material that you're bringing
[01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:47.670]  to the home and how you're setting this up.
[01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:51.790]  These microbes, I mean, they break things down.
[01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:53.470]  These are sap ropes, right?
[01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:56.470]  Like these will decompose.
[01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:58.750]  So just something to keep in mind.
[01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:59.830]  I rent an apartment.
[01:59:59.830 --> 02:00:03.990]  So for me, I mean, it is what it is.
[02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:05.950]  This is what I'm able to do.
[02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:07.230]  But just something to keep in mind.
[02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:08.950]  You don't wanna do this in your bedroom
[02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:11.110]  because if you start dropping IMO into the walls
[02:00:11.110 --> 02:00:12.710]  and different things like that,
[02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:13.670]  I don't know what's gonna happen,
[02:00:13.670 --> 02:00:15.390]  but just something to keep in mind.
[02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:19.750]  But basically what I did is at first,
[02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:21.510]  I was like, I just need a breathable floor.
[02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:23.070]  I need something that's breathable.
[02:00:23.070 --> 02:00:25.430]  The reason why doing it outside works so well
[02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:27.990]  is because the ground breathes.
[02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:29.590]  You don't wanna do this on cement.
[02:00:29.590 --> 02:00:32.070]  You don't wanna do this on a non-breathable surface
[02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:34.870]  because you need the pile to breathe from all areas.
[02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:38.550]  If for instance, like if Marco was doing this
[02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:41.270]  and letting it sit for a couple of days
[02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:42.950]  while this thing heated up
[02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:45.430]  and he was doing this in like a plastic floor,
[02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.430]  the bottom's gonna sit wet
[02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:50.070]  and the bottom's gonna essentially go anaerobic.
[02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.950]  So as you're turning that,
[02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:52.670]  you're also turning all those anaerobic microbes
[02:00:52.670 --> 02:00:54.350]  into this pile.
[02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:56.590]  So you need it to breathe on all sides.
[02:00:56.590 --> 02:01:00.830]  So what I did is I got a piece of wood.
[02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:01.670]  This is my first attempt.
[02:01:01.670 --> 02:01:03.990]  I'll kind of walk you through the progression that I did.
[02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:05.590]  And I got a piece of wood
[02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:07.310]  and I just drilled a bunch of holes in it.
[02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:08.950]  And that seemed to somewhat work
[02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:10.470]  so I can get the breathability from the bottom.
[02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:11.310]  Oh, my bad.
[02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:12.470]  And I propped it up as well.
[02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:17.470]  I think I put like some seedling trays underneath
[02:01:17.590 --> 02:01:18.950]  to kind of like prop it up.
[02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:20.230]  So that's just what I had.
[02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:21.250]  But it made a damn mess
[02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:22.590]  because there's no border around it.
[02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:24.510]  Everything was just kind of falling off the sides
[02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:25.350]  when I was trying to,
[02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:26.170]  every time I'd flip the pile.
[02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:30.510]  So it just, it wasn't very conducive for my situation.
[02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:33.430]  Chris Trump has something that he's done
[02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:37.410]  where he made a cedar box that's used in,
[02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:42.210]  in like in cacao production,
[02:01:42.210 --> 02:01:44.190]  I believe it's like where they do fermentation
[02:01:44.190 --> 02:01:46.830]  in when like they harvest cacao beans
[02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:47.670]  and different things like that.
[02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:50.110]  And this is kind of the idea that he took.
[02:01:50.110 --> 02:01:51.190]  So I took that idea
[02:01:51.190 --> 02:01:52.690]  and I kind of replicated it for myself.
[02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:54.790]  I'm not a carpenter by any means.
[02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:56.670]  So my box isn't even even,
[02:01:56.670 --> 02:01:58.190]  it doesn't look nice, but it works.
[02:01:58.190 --> 02:01:59.990]  It works for me and my setup.
[02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:03.990]  So basically what I did is I built a base
[02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:06.950]  out of cedar fencing material.
[02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:08.950]  And I basically got a quarter
[02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:10.250]  and I put a quarter in between.
[02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:11.510]  So that way I could get,
[02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:14.790]  whatever the width of a quarter is
[02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:16.910]  essentially spacing between each.
[02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:18.350]  16th of an inch.
[02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:19.190]  Perfect.
[02:02:19.190 --> 02:02:21.070]  16th of an inch basically.
[02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:23.550]  I would even go a little bit wider than that.
[02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:27.790]  16th to even like a quarter of an inch in between each,
[02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:31.910]  I guess I'll call it slab to allow airflow.
[02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:33.750]  And I drilled a bunch of holes in it,
[02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:35.190]  put a support beam on the bottom
[02:02:35.190 --> 02:02:36.190]  and then I put walls.
[02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:37.630]  Actually, here, let me just flip this.
[02:02:37.630 --> 02:02:38.930]  See if I'll show you guys.
[02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:44.210]  But basically this is what I kind of made.
[02:02:44.210 --> 02:02:45.230]  Something like this.
[02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:47.590]  Okay, nice.
[02:02:47.590 --> 02:02:49.750]  And I don't have a lid on it
[02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:52.230]  just because I'm not that carpenter savvy.
[02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:54.990]  So if anybody out here is in near my area, let's talk.
[02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:58.470]  I'd love to get a nicer box built,
[02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:01.670]  but for now this is just kind of what I'm using.
[02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:03.190]  And then I just put walls up as well.
[02:03:03.190 --> 02:03:05.710]  So that way, as I'm turning this pile,
[02:03:05.710 --> 02:03:08.050]  I'm not dumping IMO all over the floor.
[02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:12.310]  I do put a tarp underneath it as well to catch anything.
[02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:13.750]  And that way I can just clean it up
[02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:16.790]  and make the maintenance a little bit easier.
[02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:21.110]  But the idea is since I don't have the earth floor
[02:03:21.110 --> 02:03:24.430]  to go to work with in my environment,
[02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:26.550]  I'm using what I have available to me.
[02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:28.970]  The cedar box is essentially my method.
[02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:32.410]  And I mix my material on a tarp
[02:03:32.410 --> 02:03:34.650]  and then I dump it all into the box
[02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:37.310]  for the fermentation process of making the IMO three.
[02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:43.030]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:44.470]  I make the box big enough.
[02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:47.030]  And you wanna use enough material,
[02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:48.110]  but not too much material.
[02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:49.470]  So that way, if you need to thin it out,
[02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:51.270]  you actually have the space for it.
[02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:52.230]  Because the last thing you want
[02:03:52.230 --> 02:03:56.390]  is to fill this whole damn box up 12 to 18 inches,
[02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:57.470]  and then it gets too damn high.
[02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:59.150]  And you're like, well, I can't make it any smaller
[02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:01.170]  because I don't have any room in the box.
[02:04:01.170 --> 02:04:02.590]  So that's something to kind of keep in mind
[02:04:02.590 --> 02:04:05.870]  if you're doing that, this style of IMO threes.
[02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:08.230]  You have to just kind of mess with it.
[02:04:08.230 --> 02:04:09.510]  Whatever size box you have,
[02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:10.950]  you wanna make sure you leave enough room
[02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:12.910]  so where you can move the material
[02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:15.310]  from one side to the other side.
[02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:18.030]  So if the floor is wet on this side,
[02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:20.350]  then when you shift it to this side, this side is dry.
[02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:22.350]  And then by the time you shift it back,
[02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:23.270]  this side is also dry.
[02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:24.510]  So you're not creating a wet spot
[02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:26.630]  on the bottom of the pile.
[02:04:26.630 --> 02:04:28.630]  So those are kind of little things to kind of keep in mind.
[02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:29.750]  I'm sure Marco, you've noticed, right?
[02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:31.150]  When you move your pile, it's a little bit damp,
[02:04:31.150 --> 02:04:33.190]  a little bit wetter on the bottom, right?
[02:04:33.190 --> 02:04:34.790]  And you move it to a wetter spot.
[02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:36.550]  It's kind of the same idea.
[02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:37.550]  Yeah, I like that, man.
[02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:39.710]  I like how you made it where you got that shift
[02:04:39.710 --> 02:04:40.550]  back and forth.
[02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:42.190]  I like that because one of the key things
[02:04:42.190 --> 02:04:45.830]  with the IMO 3 is gonna be turning that middle.
[02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:47.790]  When I turn that, baby,
[02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:50.190]  I really wanna go dig deep in that middle.
[02:04:50.190 --> 02:04:53.510]  I wanna pull that middle out, put that middle on the edges,
[02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:55.310]  put the edges in the middle.
[02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:56.150]  You wanna revert.
[02:04:56.150 --> 02:04:58.310]  You just wanna keep rotating that in and out.
[02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:59.910]  Because what'll happen is, like you said,
[02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:03.390]  if you just, even outdoors, if I don't turn thoroughly,
[02:05:03.390 --> 02:05:05.430]  the bottom, the very bottom of my pile,
[02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:08.510]  even sitting on the earth, can get anaerobic on you
[02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:10.070]  and get overheated.
[02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:13.190]  So it's important to get down in there and turn that.
[02:05:13.190 --> 02:05:14.470]  But yeah, I like that box, man.
[02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:17.110]  I would probably, I'm sorry, I can't help it.
[02:05:17.110 --> 02:05:18.150]  I always gotta think.
[02:05:18.150 --> 02:05:23.150]  So I would probably put soil on that tarp,
[02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:26.030]  put that box over top of that soil,
[02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:28.110]  and then make my pile right there,
[02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:29.190]  same way you're doing it.
[02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:30.510]  Just my two foot.
[02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:31.470]  That's a good idea.
[02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:36.630]  If that box goes anaerobic, are there ways to churn it,
[02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:40.190]  like tame it like a wild horse or something,
[02:05:40.190 --> 02:05:42.630]  where it's up and down, but you finally rein it in?
[02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:46.150]  Or how do you feel about on the indoor side of things?
[02:05:46.150 --> 02:05:48.390]  Do you mean with the pile itself?
[02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:52.270]  So yeah, say you're starting to know that it's,
[02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:53.790]  maybe even just from your nose,
[02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:56.110]  it's starting to seem like it's going anaerobic.
[02:05:56.110 --> 02:06:00.230]  Do you then kind of add lab or something like that,
[02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:02.150]  where you feel like it's worth it?
[02:06:02.150 --> 02:06:06.550]  Or if it's gone putrid, is that a lost cause?
[02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:09.510]  In my opinion, it's a lost cause.
[02:06:10.590 --> 02:06:14.310]  And the reason I say that is because you've lost diversity.
[02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:16.830]  If the name of the game is diversity,
[02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:20.030]  and the whole point is we're growing at the IMO2,
[02:06:20.030 --> 02:06:22.110]  and essentially at that point,
[02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:23.910]  if it's gone anaerobic on you,
[02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:27.070]  or you start getting that wet asphalt smell
[02:06:27.070 --> 02:06:28.430]  because it got too hot,
[02:06:29.190 --> 02:06:32.590]  there is no really bringing it back.
[02:06:32.590 --> 02:06:34.350]  I mean, you could add more IMO2 to it,
[02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:36.390]  hopefully that that dominates it, right?
[02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:38.270]  And add more moisture to it.
[02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:42.670]  But at that point, yeah, this is where it's a baby, man.
[02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:45.550]  You just have to care for it from the beginning.
[02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:46.390]  And if it goes wrong,
[02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:48.030]  that's where the learning curve kind of comes in.
[02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:50.270]  And trial and error, man.
[02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:54.470]  I remember when I first started making these piles,
[02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:56.550]  I was trying to make a pile like every other week,
[02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:59.830]  just so I could try to dial in my system
[02:06:59.830 --> 02:07:02.270]  and try to learn as much as I could.
[02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:05.510]  I didn't sleep very much during that time.
[02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:07.150]  And I don't think my partner was very happy with me
[02:07:07.150 --> 02:07:08.190]  at that point either.
[02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:12.510]  But she was a champ and we rode it out.
[02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:16.590]  So yeah, I don't think there's any kind of coming back
[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:17.430]  from that.
[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:18.550]  I don't know, Marco, if you have any experience with that.
[02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:20.030]  I mean, I'd use it for something else.
[02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:21.910]  Like I wouldn't just dump it,
[02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:23.630]  but it's not gonna be the IMO3
[02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:25.030]  you're gonna wanna take to IMO4.
[02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:27.990]  I don't know if I would put that more much time
[02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:29.510]  into it at that point.
[02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:31.710]  I'd probably scrap it and start all over again
[02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:33.270]  and learn from that experience.
[02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:36.430]  Yeah, thankfully I haven't had one go all the way out
[02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:39.310]  and go bad on me, which is good.
[02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:40.230]  I guess something like that.
[02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:42.070]  I've heard people say you can take that baby
[02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:45.430]  and try to dry it back out.
[02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:49.310]  Gotta restart all the way over from scratch.
[02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:52.350]  Fresh wedding, fresh IMO, fresh book.
[02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:54.870]  But then you got kind of got a little bit of issues there,
[02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:59.070]  possibly growing some of that anaerobic stuff.
[02:07:59.070 --> 02:08:00.630]  Something like that would be a good candidate,
[02:08:00.630 --> 02:08:03.950]  tossing a JLF, tossing your soil pile,
[02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:07.070]  get it back in the earth, let the earth kind of rework it.
[02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:10.390]  And you can, yeah, definitely don't toss it though.
[02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:12.430]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:08:12.430 --> 02:08:16.350]  I mean, use old IMO or IMO that didn't work out,
[02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:19.430]  use it as kind of like your leak mold replacement
[02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:21.470]  when you're making JLS.
[02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:22.310]  Yeah, I actually use it.
[02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:24.910]  So it's kind of like, I got a bit one
[02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:27.590]  that's got so many grains in it because I do that.
[02:08:27.590 --> 02:08:30.550]  Like if I, just any spent grains,
[02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:32.830]  I'll just keep throwing them in the same IMO.
[02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:35.030]  I'm sorry, JLF bucket, sorry.
[02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:38.830]  And yeah, you know, JLF because it'll neutralize it.
[02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:40.070]  Whatever was in that thing,
[02:08:40.070 --> 02:08:42.990]  JLF is gonna have so many microbes in there.
[02:08:42.990 --> 02:08:44.390]  It's just gonna neutralize that.
[02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:46.110]  So you'd be fine.
[02:08:46.110 --> 02:08:48.350]  Yeah, and adding the labs to it.
[02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:51.990]  I mean, IMO already has so much lab in it already
[02:08:53.190 --> 02:08:55.670]  that I don't know if that's really gonna do much to it,
[02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:58.710]  to be honest, because we're neutralizing the smell.
[02:08:58.710 --> 02:09:00.790]  But then at that point, we're literally just creating
[02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:04.610]  like a Bukashi if you think about it at that point.
[02:09:05.630 --> 02:09:07.190]  So it's not gonna have the same diversity
[02:09:07.190 --> 02:09:10.350]  that we would if we, you know,
[02:09:11.630 --> 02:09:12.990]  baby I guess from the beginning
[02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:15.550]  and kept that diversity from the IMO too,
[02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:17.310]  from that forest collection.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.620]  Do you think composting worms
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.720]  could turn around an anaerobic pile?
[02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:30.690]  I don't see why not.
[02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:34.650]  But I think it would just be a different material
[02:09:34.650 --> 02:09:35.970]  at that point, right?
[02:09:35.970 --> 02:09:37.170]  Like at that point.
[02:09:37.170 --> 02:09:38.770]  Yeah, when we're talking like lost cause,
[02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.090]  I was just trying to think.
[02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:41.810]  Yeah, but yeah, worms will turn it up.
[02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:42.650]  That'll be fine.
[02:09:42.650 --> 02:09:44.570]  And the worm bin, shredders and worms,
[02:09:44.570 --> 02:09:45.890]  yeah, they'll get all in that stuff.
[02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:49.010]  So kind of just, it might be a lost cause for moving that,
[02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:50.290]  but then just throw your shredders,
[02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:51.370]  throw your life in there.
[02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.770]  And now you got basically a living leaf mulch
[02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:56.090]  or something like that.
[02:09:56.090 --> 02:09:56.930]  Hell yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:57.770]  I wouldn't dump it.
[02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:59.330]  Like you just create a pile somewhere
[02:09:59.330 --> 02:10:01.370]  and just let nature kind of go at it.
[02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:02.330]  And it'll balance out.
[02:10:02.330 --> 02:10:04.290]  Like, I mean, when you create a compost pile
[02:10:04.290 --> 02:10:06.610]  that's thermophilic and you've lost a lot of diversity
[02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:09.410]  from going so high as it matures, right?
[02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:10.730]  Isn't that kind of what happens, right?
[02:10:10.730 --> 02:10:12.050]  Like all the critters start moving in
[02:10:12.050 --> 02:10:14.510]  and start bringing the life back into it.
[02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:17.930]  I'm sure you could probably do something similar to it.
[02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:18.770]  I don't know.
[02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:20.550]  I just personally wouldn't take it to the next stage.
[02:10:21.190 --> 02:10:22.510]  I would make sure that I have a good product.
[02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:26.510]  If I'm gonna put all that effort into making an IMO three
[02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:30.070]  and then making an IMO four, possibly even an IMO five,
[02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:32.070]  I would make sure that the material
[02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:34.630]  that I'm going into the IMO four is solid.
[02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:36.750]  Because if not, I mean,
[02:10:36.750 --> 02:10:38.510]  you're gonna put so much time and effort
[02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:41.270]  and possibly lack of sleep going into that,
[02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:44.710]  that I just wanna make sure that it's a solid product.
[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:45.550]  Yeah.
[02:10:45.550 --> 02:10:47.110]  Yeah, I'm with you on that, Johnny.
[02:10:47.110 --> 02:10:49.010]  You just kind of want that done right.
[02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:51.390]  Worms.
[02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:52.870]  Like, I think that's why it's invaluable
[02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:55.310]  to have vermicompost, huge.
[02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:57.030]  Regular compost, huge.
[02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:58.710]  JLFs, huge.
[02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:01.790]  And then I like the black soldier fly compost
[02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:05.950]  because they're my toughest guys.
[02:11:05.950 --> 02:11:07.630]  Like if somebody were to give me something,
[02:11:07.630 --> 02:11:09.110]  hey man, I got some food scraps
[02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:12.150]  that may have something in it, meat or something.
[02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:14.030]  Black soldier flies don't give a damn.
[02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:15.070]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:15.070 --> 02:11:17.830]  They can take any of that stuff that worms
[02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:20.110]  or earthworms can't necessarily take
[02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:23.270]  or won't really care for that environment.
[02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:26.390]  And what black soldier flies do is they convert it.
[02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:28.910]  They actually produce hormones and gases
[02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:31.710]  that deter regular flies.
[02:11:31.710 --> 02:11:33.390]  So you can literally have rotting meat
[02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:34.670]  in a black soldier fly bin
[02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:36.550]  and no other flies will come into it
[02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:39.470]  because they overpower it that way.
[02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:40.910]  So I think those are key
[02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:43.230]  because what happens is like on my place,
[02:11:43.230 --> 02:11:45.310]  the only trash I have is like plastic
[02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:46.190]  or something like that.
[02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:47.030]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:49.110]  If it's something that can go back into earth,
[02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:51.710]  one of those processes that I have
[02:11:51.710 --> 02:11:52.670]  is gonna be able to take it.
[02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:53.870]  So like those old grains,
[02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:55.150]  they can go in either,
[02:11:55.150 --> 02:11:57.470]  they can go in any of those, you feel me?
[02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:59.710]  So yeah, that's why it's important to kind of have that
[02:11:59.710 --> 02:12:01.070]  that way you're not wasting.
[02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:03.910]  That's all about closing those loops, guys.
[02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:05.350]  I hate that, it's kind of sucks
[02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:06.870]  that we got to buy some things
[02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:10.710]  and we got to buy our grains and things like that at times.
[02:12:10.710 --> 02:12:14.550]  But key thing is not wasting them
[02:12:14.550 --> 02:12:16.870]  and reusing what we got there.
[02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:21.770]  What do you think, Johnny?
[02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:24.810]  So now you're into your IMO three,
[02:12:24.810 --> 02:12:28.130]  how long do you usually process usually take in the box?
[02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:30.090]  I mean, about the same amount of time,
[02:12:31.130 --> 02:12:33.290]  week is two days.
[02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:36.490]  I'd say about a week to 10 days, sounds fair.
[02:12:37.970 --> 02:12:39.170]  It's something that I've been playing around
[02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:40.490]  with moisture wise.
[02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:45.250]  The more moisture I add, the quicker it spikes.
[02:12:45.250 --> 02:12:46.770]  The least amount of moisture I add,
[02:12:46.770 --> 02:12:48.210]  I kind of get that slow rise
[02:12:48.210 --> 02:12:49.250]  from what you were describing.
[02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:50.970]  I think I was following your story on IG,
[02:12:50.970 --> 02:12:51.890]  like when you were doing,
[02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:55.210]  like it took two or three days for it to kind of heat up.
[02:12:55.210 --> 02:12:57.010]  Personally, man, that'd be my ideal.
[02:12:58.130 --> 02:12:58.970]  I just wanna be able to,
[02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:00.290]  especially with this Inkbird thing,
[02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:01.530]  I just wanna be able to look at my phone and be like,
[02:13:01.530 --> 02:13:04.410]  cool, we're good, we're chillin', we're cruising.
[02:13:04.410 --> 02:13:05.970]  Versus having to pop in and being stressed,
[02:13:05.970 --> 02:13:08.490]  I'd be like, shit, am I gonna have to turn this thing or not?
[02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:11.290]  Or it's like, okay, I'm gonna go out to dinner,
[02:13:11.290 --> 02:13:12.570]  but I'm like sitting here on my phone,
[02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:13.930]  making sure that my pile is good to go.
[02:13:13.930 --> 02:13:15.730]  Like, I don't wanna have to do that.
[02:13:17.130 --> 02:13:18.330]  So that's another thing too,
[02:13:18.330 --> 02:13:21.690]  is I try to set my piles like on the end of my work week.
[02:13:21.690 --> 02:13:24.130]  So that way those few days, then that heat process,
[02:13:24.130 --> 02:13:25.210]  like I know I'm gonna be home
[02:13:25.210 --> 02:13:28.410]  or I know I can be attentive to them.
[02:13:29.410 --> 02:13:32.690]  Yeah, so we're setting ourselves up for success, guys.
[02:13:32.690 --> 02:13:34.290]  You know, that's all that is.
[02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:37.970]  You know, I know that if you, you know,
[02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:40.410]  certain times you're not gonna wanna go messing with stuff
[02:13:40.410 --> 02:13:42.850]  at two, three in the morning, you know what I mean?
[02:13:42.850 --> 02:13:45.810]  Why not try to set yourself up for success?
[02:13:45.850 --> 02:13:49.210]  Because, you know, it'd be somewhat heartbreaking, man.
[02:13:49.210 --> 02:13:51.730]  You working on this pile and you got lazy,
[02:13:51.730 --> 02:13:52.930]  didn't check it overnight.
[02:13:52.930 --> 02:13:55.570]  And the next morning you're out there smelling ammonia,
[02:13:55.570 --> 02:13:56.610]  you know what I mean?
[02:13:57.730 --> 02:13:59.530]  That just would be kind of discouraging.
[02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:02.010]  So we're wanting to set ourselves up for success.
[02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:04.890]  And I mean, it's just doing little things ahead of time
[02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:06.050]  to set the table,
[02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:09.330]  to make sure that we have a successful run at it.
[02:14:09.330 --> 02:14:12.250]  And like you said, man, start these things on a Thursday
[02:14:12.250 --> 02:14:13.970]  or, you know, Thursday's a great day.
[02:14:13.970 --> 02:14:16.610]  If you're off Friday, you know, Saturday, Sunday,
[02:14:16.610 --> 02:14:17.770]  start it Thursday.
[02:14:17.770 --> 02:14:21.130]  You kind of don't really heat up till Friday evening.
[02:14:21.130 --> 02:14:24.050]  And then you got the weekend to have a beer or whatever
[02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:25.570]  and mess with this pile.
[02:14:25.570 --> 02:14:27.730]  And then hopefully by the time Monday comes back around,
[02:14:27.730 --> 02:14:30.450]  it's in control to the point where you can kind of
[02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:33.210]  flatten it in the morning before you gotta go to work,
[02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:34.050]  cool it down.
[02:14:34.050 --> 02:14:35.770]  And when you come home, rush and check it.
[02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:37.610]  And hopefully you can kind of pick it up,
[02:14:37.610 --> 02:14:40.290]  flatten it and then that kind of process.
[02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:42.430]  That's, yep, that's exactly right.
[02:14:43.330 --> 02:14:44.170]  I'm with you there.
[02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:45.490]  I completely agree.
[02:14:45.490 --> 02:14:47.890]  Like Thursdays or Wednesdays are typically
[02:14:47.890 --> 02:14:49.770]  when I start my pile.
[02:14:49.770 --> 02:14:52.290]  Cause you're gonna end up waiting that 36 hour mark,
[02:14:52.290 --> 02:14:54.810]  36, 48 hours, it'll start heating up.
[02:14:54.810 --> 02:14:57.290]  So if I start my pile on a Wednesday
[02:14:57.290 --> 02:14:59.070]  and I work till Friday,
[02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:02.810]  I know I usually cleared until Friday, midday Friday,
[02:15:02.810 --> 02:15:04.610]  I might have to get that first turn.
[02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:08.610]  And then you spend over the weekend,
[02:15:08.610 --> 02:15:11.130]  you're probably gonna have to monitor the pile a lot more.
[02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:14.170]  So don't plan too many activities that weekend.
[02:15:14.170 --> 02:15:16.610]  Cause especially if you're making your first pile,
[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:18.490]  you will be turning it every couple of hours.
[02:15:18.490 --> 02:15:20.650]  It's just the nature of it.
[02:15:20.650 --> 02:15:22.610]  As you kind of figure out that finesse of,
[02:15:22.610 --> 02:15:25.030]  do I need to make it higher to heat it up more?
[02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:27.170]  Do I need to make it lower to cool it down?
[02:15:28.610 --> 02:15:30.250]  Do I need to cover it, uncover it?
[02:15:30.250 --> 02:15:31.090]  Little things like that.
[02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:32.490]  You wanna try to keep it in that temperature
[02:15:32.490 --> 02:15:33.610]  as much as possible.
[02:15:35.650 --> 02:15:37.010]  But yeah, that's a great time.
[02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:39.650]  You want us to make sure you think this process through.
[02:15:39.650 --> 02:15:40.770]  And this is where I really hope
[02:15:40.770 --> 02:15:43.510]  that this episode helps you guys with is,
[02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:48.370]  a lot of these things that Marco and I have tried
[02:15:48.370 --> 02:15:51.530]  and used time-wise to kind of set yourself up
[02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:54.470]  so you can have a successful first run
[02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:58.490]  or maybe the second run when you're running this.
[02:15:58.490 --> 02:15:59.370]  Cause it's stressful, man.
[02:15:59.370 --> 02:16:00.530]  It can get stressful.
[02:16:02.690 --> 02:16:05.090]  You've invested a bunch of money into this material,
[02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.670]  especially if you're doing this on scale.
[02:16:07.330 --> 02:16:10.990]  I can imagine making a pile that's the size of a ton,
[02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:12.190]  like a ton of material.
[02:16:12.190 --> 02:16:14.390]  That's a lot of money that you put into that.
[02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:15.790]  And for that to go anaerobic,
[02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:18.470]  to have to throw that on,
[02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:21.270]  I mean, it's a whole nother ticket on your bottom line.
[02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:26.270]  So setting yourself up in that regard,
[02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:28.790]  think about it, what you have coming up,
[02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:32.310]  how much time you have, the day you're starting it,
[02:16:32.310 --> 02:16:33.530]  all of those pieces.
[02:16:34.530 --> 02:16:36.050]  Yeah, weather, weather's key.
[02:16:36.050 --> 02:16:37.230]  Weather and up weather's big too.
[02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:39.290]  If it's gonna rain, be mindful of that.
[02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:41.550]  Cause if it, I mean, the rain's gonna add extra moisture
[02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:43.770]  to it, especially if you're doing this outside
[02:16:43.770 --> 02:16:46.250]  in an uncovered area, things like that
[02:16:46.250 --> 02:16:47.590]  are really big to consider.
[02:16:47.590 --> 02:16:50.970]  So think about the weather timeline
[02:16:50.970 --> 02:16:53.890]  when you're starting it, things like that.
[02:16:53.890 --> 02:16:55.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:58.650]  And that's a good time, saving,
[02:16:58.650 --> 02:17:02.170]  I don't know if you get old sheets and old towels
[02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:03.010]  and stuff like that.
[02:17:03.450 --> 02:17:04.710]  Don't throw that stuff away, keep that stuff.
[02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:07.070]  Those things are all good to kind of wrap up your piles
[02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:08.030]  and cover them up.
[02:17:09.130 --> 02:17:11.090]  It's always good uses for stuff like that.
[02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:14.250]  And like right now I got mine covered up with a bill,
[02:17:15.330 --> 02:17:17.210]  just kind of a breathable,
[02:17:17.210 --> 02:17:18.570]  I don't even know where I got it from.
[02:17:18.570 --> 02:17:19.730]  It's like a sheet.
[02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:22.530]  And then I got that covered up with a LED box,
[02:17:22.530 --> 02:17:23.370]  you know what I mean?
[02:17:23.370 --> 02:17:25.770]  Big cardboard box, just trying to keep that environment,
[02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:28.690]  keep that microclimate in my box,
[02:17:28.690 --> 02:17:31.090]  humidity high, temperature up.
[02:17:31.090 --> 02:17:33.890]  And just so that piles is somewhat insulated
[02:17:33.890 --> 02:17:35.810]  from the outdoors, because it's nice today,
[02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:38.690]  but it's gonna be cold again in the morning.
[02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:40.930]  So, you know, it'd be just another challenge
[02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:43.970]  with see how it is when I wake up
[02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:46.010]  and you know, where it's gonna bring me.
[02:17:46.970 --> 02:17:47.810]  But yeah.
[02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:49.650]  Yeah, I do that indoors, I tarp it too.
[02:17:49.650 --> 02:17:51.850]  Okay, yeah, just to keep that humidity up.
[02:17:51.850 --> 02:17:53.290]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:54.170]  I've noticed that if I don't,
[02:17:54.170 --> 02:17:56.250]  it dries out on the top too much.
[02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:59.370]  And I start losing moisture content.
[02:17:59.410 --> 02:18:01.890]  Now, if you made it too wet, don't cover it, right?
[02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:05.530]  Because you need that moisture kind of to dissipate out.
[02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:07.330]  But if you were able to kind of dial it in,
[02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:08.970]  keep it covered.
[02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:10.690]  I mean, I'm not talking like tuck it in tight,
[02:18:10.690 --> 02:18:12.010]  but like for my box,
[02:18:12.010 --> 02:18:14.690]  I'd literally just have a tarp that I just lay on top.
[02:18:14.690 --> 02:18:16.490]  So it creates a somewhat of a microclimate
[02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:18.610]  and it's warmer on the inside.
[02:18:18.610 --> 02:18:20.650]  So as the moisture is kind of beating off,
[02:18:20.650 --> 02:18:21.770]  it'll land on the top.
[02:18:21.770 --> 02:18:22.810]  I'm trying to, in a sense,
[02:18:22.810 --> 02:18:25.930]  trying to create that dew that happens in the morning.
[02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:28.210]  To let it re-wet itself from the dribble.
[02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:29.330]  Right, right.
[02:18:31.210 --> 02:18:32.690]  That has helped.
[02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:34.210]  But yeah, these are all just like kind of little things
[02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:35.050]  that I'm toying with
[02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:37.490]  and seeing kind of the results that I get.
[02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:38.690]  This is, I enjoy doing this shit.
[02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:42.970]  So like I just make piles and see what works
[02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:43.810]  and what doesn't.
[02:18:43.810 --> 02:18:45.850]  And then I microscope it and see what we got.
[02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:47.290]  Yeah, it's a nice challenge.
[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:48.890]  And another thing guys,
[02:18:48.890 --> 02:18:51.650]  a lot of times IMO3 will,
[02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:52.490]  cause think about it.
[02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:54.130]  What happens is when those microbes are growing
[02:18:54.130 --> 02:18:55.490]  and they're creating that heat,
[02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:57.730]  well, one of the byproducts is moisture.
[02:18:58.170 --> 02:18:59.810]  So what'll happen is you'll be on this pile.
[02:18:59.810 --> 02:19:01.730]  This pile will be hot as hell.
[02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:03.410]  And then all of a sudden you'll crack it open
[02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:04.890]  and go inside of it.
[02:19:04.890 --> 02:19:05.730]  And it'll be dry.
[02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:07.410]  It'll be a kind of a dry.
[02:19:07.410 --> 02:19:08.490]  Steam will come out,
[02:19:08.490 --> 02:19:10.610]  but you'll say, man, this thing's really drying out.
[02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:14.090]  And what happens is sometimes you can run out of steam,
[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:15.010]  literally.
[02:19:15.010 --> 02:19:17.730]  And with IMO3 and you kind of got to re-wet
[02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:20.130]  sometimes around that fourth, fifth day.
[02:19:20.130 --> 02:19:22.410]  Just depends on how it's going.
[02:19:22.410 --> 02:19:23.810]  But don't be afraid to re-wet.
[02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:25.610]  And by re-wet, I mean,
[02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:29.210]  make another small batch of the natural farming inputs
[02:19:29.210 --> 02:19:30.970]  that you kind of started off with.
[02:19:30.970 --> 02:19:34.050]  And I've also even used JLF in the past to re-wet.
[02:19:34.050 --> 02:19:38.370]  I've literally just taken JLF and re-wet my pile.
[02:19:38.370 --> 02:19:41.210]  And that really kicked it back up quick.
[02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:42.050]  You know what I mean?
[02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:45.170]  So different little things you can kind of experiment with,
[02:19:46.450 --> 02:19:48.850]  learn the basics, you know what I mean?
[02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:50.650]  And then kind of go from there.
[02:19:50.650 --> 02:19:53.010]  You know, that's how I always tell people that.
[02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:55.650]  If you're making your first pile,
[02:19:56.890 --> 02:19:58.690]  I would recommend to not re-wet.
[02:20:00.290 --> 02:20:01.490]  So you can learn from it.
[02:20:02.490 --> 02:20:04.210]  See what happens.
[02:20:04.210 --> 02:20:05.290]  Stack it up top.
[02:20:05.290 --> 02:20:10.290]  Like if it's low, stack it up high and see what happens.
[02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:13.610]  See if the temperature goes up.
[02:20:15.610 --> 02:20:17.490]  Just so you can kind of really learn from that experience.
[02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:18.530]  And then the following time you're like,
[02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:20.490]  okay, I need to add a little bit more moisture
[02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:22.890]  when I get to this point, if this happens again.
[02:20:23.770 --> 02:20:25.650]  But if you don't know what happens on the back end,
[02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.770]  then you're not gonna know what to be looking for.
[02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:30.290]  So that's just, I would recommend doing that.
[02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:31.650]  It's not like it's gone to waste.
[02:20:31.650 --> 02:20:32.570]  It'll still work.
[02:20:34.090 --> 02:20:36.330]  It just might not be as strong.
[02:20:36.330 --> 02:20:37.530]  But that's what I would do.
[02:20:37.530 --> 02:20:38.770]  And also if you're gonna re-wet,
[02:20:38.770 --> 02:20:40.650]  if you're making a small pile,
[02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:42.490]  this is just from my experience from what I'm doing in here,
[02:20:42.490 --> 02:20:43.610]  is use like a sprayer.
[02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:47.490]  You don't want the water to be all concentrated in one area
[02:20:47.490 --> 02:20:49.210]  because you're gonna get hot spots.
[02:20:49.210 --> 02:20:50.770]  You need it to be even.
[02:20:50.770 --> 02:20:52.570]  So like, I just went to Home Depot
[02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:55.050]  and I just bought like a little sprayer
[02:20:55.050 --> 02:20:56.290]  and I'll just fill it up with the liter
[02:20:56.290 --> 02:20:59.250]  and I'll just mist the whole pile
[02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:01.170]  if I need to add more moisture to it.
[02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:02.290]  But same thing as Marco was saying,
[02:21:02.290 --> 02:21:05.370]  like I'll make that solution, not the IMO2,
[02:21:05.370 --> 02:21:06.970]  but I'll make everything else.
[02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:10.890]  And I can, I think Marco,
[02:21:10.890 --> 02:21:12.370]  you've probably listed it somewhere on your IG.
[02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:13.570]  If not, I can make a post about it
[02:21:13.570 --> 02:21:15.450]  to tell everybody kind of what's in there.
[02:21:15.450 --> 02:21:18.330]  So if you want, you can kind of go look at that.
[02:21:18.330 --> 02:21:21.170]  But basically your OHN, FPJ, vinegar,
[02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:22.690]  seawater, humic acid,
[02:21:23.970 --> 02:21:26.970]  in certain ratios that you'll dilute that into water.
[02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:29.210]  And-
[02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:31.250]  Please make a post about that, Johnny.
[02:21:31.250 --> 02:21:32.690]  Will do, yeah, I'll do that.
[02:21:33.930 --> 02:21:37.930]  But basically that's what you're gonna be needing to re-wet.
[02:21:37.930 --> 02:21:39.370]  You could also just add regular water.
[02:21:39.370 --> 02:21:40.410]  I've never done JLF.
[02:21:40.410 --> 02:21:41.410]  That sounds really interesting.
[02:21:41.410 --> 02:21:42.510]  I'll have to try that.
[02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:46.010]  Yeah, it works.
[02:21:46.010 --> 02:21:47.410]  I mean, you just, the idea,
[02:21:47.410 --> 02:21:49.730]  the whole idea of just adding that microbiology
[02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:52.130]  and moisture back is all that really was.
[02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:53.710]  And it works out pretty nice.
[02:21:55.650 --> 02:21:59.530]  Yeah, man, great info on the piles for sure.
[02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:04.490]  You know, it's just a work of art in a way, guys.
[02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:06.050]  It just takes a little bit of time.
[02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:08.170]  It's not too bad.
[02:22:08.170 --> 02:22:12.010]  Like we're saying, man, you spend, you know,
[02:22:12.010 --> 02:22:13.650]  under 50 bucks, you know,
[02:22:13.650 --> 02:22:16.570]  if you had to buy everything and have some inputs,
[02:22:16.570 --> 02:22:20.410]  you could make, you know, make an IMO three pile, you know?
[02:22:20.410 --> 02:22:22.870]  I feel like that's kind of the step up
[02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:25.410]  when you're in natural farming, you know?
[02:22:25.410 --> 02:22:27.610]  Are you making an IMO three or you're not?
[02:22:27.610 --> 02:22:30.490]  And to me, that's kind of a line you cross.
[02:22:30.490 --> 02:22:33.050]  And okay, now you're taking it on up to another level.
[02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:33.890]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:33.890 --> 02:22:36.570]  That's what this stuff's about, is learning more,
[02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:37.810]  taking it to another level.
[02:22:37.810 --> 02:22:40.210]  And when you got these IMO threes finished,
[02:22:40.210 --> 02:22:41.890]  I mean, you're talking about, you got, you know,
[02:22:41.890 --> 02:22:45.210]  if you did the three bags of 50 pounds from tractor supply,
[02:22:45.210 --> 02:22:48.530]  I mean, you're talking about 150 pounds of IMO three,
[02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:49.370]  you know what I mean?
[02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:54.210]  That's a nice supply, man, for anybody's home.
[02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:56.810]  Even a small piece of property like mine,
[02:22:56.810 --> 02:22:58.530]  like, you know, 150 pounds of IMO,
[02:22:58.530 --> 02:23:01.450]  I spread out and still have some leftover,
[02:23:01.450 --> 02:23:02.290]  you know what I mean?
[02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:03.890]  So you can really,
[02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:07.530]  and think about it for about 50 bucks
[02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:10.530]  and the time you took, man, you got a really great input.
[02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:13.290]  And if you want to take it up another notch, go to IMO four.
[02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:17.170]  Now you're adding garden soil to that IMO three,
[02:23:17.170 --> 02:23:18.290]  similar process.
[02:23:18.290 --> 02:23:20.450]  And now you've just expanded at IMO three
[02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:22.010]  with the garden soil.
[02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:24.610]  And then now you can take that IMO four,
[02:23:24.610 --> 02:23:28.450]  go to an IMO five with either, I like, I don't do manure,
[02:23:28.450 --> 02:23:31.490]  but a high nitrogen source like manure.
[02:23:31.490 --> 02:23:34.810]  I make my own out of alfalfa and different things,
[02:23:34.810 --> 02:23:37.050]  but basically combine that IMO four
[02:23:37.050 --> 02:23:38.930]  with that high nitrogen source.
[02:23:38.930 --> 02:23:40.850]  Now doing the same similar process.
[02:23:40.850 --> 02:23:43.570]  Now you got a fertilizer aspect to it.
[02:23:43.570 --> 02:23:46.410]  So now you've made something that's so powerful, man.
[02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:49.530]  It's like, it's just hard to explain the feeling
[02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:50.610]  that you got in your hands.
[02:23:50.610 --> 02:23:52.130]  Like this, you know what I'm saying, Johnny?
[02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:53.610]  A little bit of inoculate,
[02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:57.530]  once you get that IMO three can just do so much, you know?
[02:23:57.530 --> 02:23:59.690]  So many, so many options with that.
[02:23:59.690 --> 02:24:00.850]  It really can.
[02:24:00.850 --> 02:24:04.770]  And IMO three,
[02:24:04.770 --> 02:24:06.370]  it's like you took what was on the forest
[02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:09.130]  and you grew it out, right?
[02:24:09.170 --> 02:24:13.170]  IMO four, we start introducing other components
[02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:15.050]  of the soil food web.
[02:24:15.050 --> 02:24:18.490]  IMO three is mainly gonna be fungal spores,
[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:21.770]  bacteria and yeast from my understanding.
[02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:23.170]  I could be off.
[02:24:23.170 --> 02:24:26.950]  I'm not trained in microscopy.
[02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:30.490]  This is just something that I decided to do for fun
[02:24:30.490 --> 02:24:32.410]  where I bought a microscope and I'm like,
[02:24:32.410 --> 02:24:33.250]  let's see what's in there.
[02:24:33.250 --> 02:24:35.330]  I just wanna know, I wanna look at things
[02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:37.830]  from different levels and different aspects.
[02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:40.550]  So from the questions that I've asked
[02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:42.350]  and the people that I've spoken to
[02:24:42.350 --> 02:24:44.470]  and the IMOs that I've collected and made,
[02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:47.190]  that's primarily what I've seen
[02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:49.730]  and been shown that's in there.
[02:24:49.730 --> 02:24:51.830]  When you start incorporating IMO four,
[02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:52.990]  you'll probably get a lot of,
[02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:56.470]  you can even find, you know, microanthropods in there
[02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:59.150]  and you might find other critters in there as well.
[02:24:59.150 --> 02:25:02.070]  But IMO three is primarily gonna be fungal spores,
[02:25:02.070 --> 02:25:03.270]  yeast and bacteria.
[02:25:06.350 --> 02:25:10.790]  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm gonna be working on
[02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:12.750]  for our little project, Brian,
[02:25:12.750 --> 02:25:15.670]  is that taking out Magnolia IMO three
[02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:18.230]  and then finding that right mix of shredders
[02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:19.070]  and everything in there.
[02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:22.870]  And it should be a nice little living soil there.
[02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:26.950]  Yeah, man, I'm excited for that.
[02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:29.710]  Let's talk even more on the soil.
[02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:33.110]  So when you're putting that much time and effort into things,
[02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:34.690]  obviously you're not gonna go out then
[02:25:34.730 --> 02:25:38.650]  and get bullshit soil and kind of like create dirt
[02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:43.650]  with this beautiful microbial product
[02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:45.810]  that you've created for yourself.
[02:25:45.810 --> 02:25:48.050]  So do you guys feel like you're going out
[02:25:48.050 --> 02:25:51.090]  and then out of your way to build your own soil?
[02:25:51.090 --> 02:25:54.210]  Are you using a brand that you feel like is tried and true?
[02:25:54.210 --> 02:25:55.690]  So somebody that is in an apartment,
[02:25:55.690 --> 02:25:57.990]  they can just buy back soil, keep it simple,
[02:25:57.990 --> 02:26:00.650]  just to be, again, have a successful flip
[02:26:00.650 --> 02:26:02.090]  and then continue to learn?
[02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:07.170]  What am I trying to say?
[02:26:07.170 --> 02:26:08.010]  I wanna step back real quick.
[02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:08.850]  When you're saying soil,
[02:26:08.850 --> 02:26:10.210]  are we talking like a soilless medium
[02:26:10.210 --> 02:26:11.290]  that someone's using indoors?
[02:26:11.290 --> 02:26:12.890]  Are we talking like field soil?
[02:26:12.890 --> 02:26:15.530]  Or what's the application you're talking about?
[02:26:15.530 --> 02:26:17.530]  Well, we're getting into more of IMO four.
[02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:19.410]  Isn't that necessarily when you're starting
[02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:22.870]  to really expand or at least you're like kind of,
[02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:24.290]  isn't that the goal?
[02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:27.330]  I think it's more like, yeah,
[02:26:27.330 --> 02:26:29.650]  would you build that soil for your IMO four?
[02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:31.650]  Where would you acquire that soil kind of,
[02:26:31.650 --> 02:26:33.770]  is that what you're saying, Brian?
[02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:34.690]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:34.690 --> 02:26:37.770]  So if we're doing an outside application,
[02:26:37.770 --> 02:26:39.210]  you're gonna wanna use whatever
[02:26:39.210 --> 02:26:40.770]  you're gonna be growing into.
[02:26:40.770 --> 02:26:42.290]  That's what I would recommend.
[02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:43.670]  One, that it's gonna be there.
[02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:46.010]  It might be shit at first, but guess what?
[02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:47.810]  Natural farming isn't gonna turn your world around
[02:26:47.810 --> 02:26:48.650]  in a year.
[02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:49.530]  Like it's gonna take time.
[02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:51.250]  It's gonna be a progression, right?
[02:26:51.250 --> 02:26:53.250]  As you make these paths, it's gonna develop and develop.
[02:26:53.250 --> 02:26:54.970]  That's why you're working this land.
[02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:56.650]  The whole aspect of regeneration, right?
[02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:58.630]  Regeneration doesn't happen overnight.
[02:26:59.770 --> 02:27:01.930]  So it's a process.
[02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:04.930]  The idea of IMO four is that you're introducing
[02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:09.770]  the microbes that you collected out in nature
[02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:13.730]  and you're introducing them into your native soil.
[02:27:13.730 --> 02:27:15.410]  So that way in a sense they become,
[02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:17.970]  they start working in harmony with one another
[02:27:17.970 --> 02:27:21.730]  and they start understanding what that material's made out of
[02:27:22.850 --> 02:27:24.510]  so that way when you apply it,
[02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:29.210]  when you apply that soil out to the field,
[02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:31.690]  they're like, oh shit, I already know what this looks like.
[02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:33.730]  I've worked this soil before.
[02:27:34.850 --> 02:27:37.010]  Oh, those are the same minerals that I was eating yesterday.
[02:27:37.010 --> 02:27:38.610]  You know, that type of idea, right?
[02:27:38.610 --> 02:27:41.810]  So they're already used to that environment
[02:27:41.810 --> 02:27:45.590]  and they can work synergistically with what's already there.
[02:27:47.170 --> 02:27:50.010]  In applications for indoor stuff,
[02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:52.050]  I've heard a couple of different things.
[02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:55.130]  I don't typically make IMO four for indoor
[02:27:55.130 --> 02:28:00.130]  because I'm not using actual outdoor field soil
[02:28:00.570 --> 02:28:04.690]  and I don't really see the benefit from using that
[02:28:04.690 --> 02:28:06.730]  in a peat-based mix just to be honest.
[02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:10.050]  To mix it with peat moss and cocoa
[02:28:10.050 --> 02:28:10.890]  and a bunch of other stuff,
[02:28:10.890 --> 02:28:12.530]  I don't know really how beneficial that would be
[02:28:12.530 --> 02:28:14.410]  because I'm not bringing in any other biology
[02:28:14.410 --> 02:28:16.410]  other than what I put in there myself.
[02:28:16.410 --> 02:28:17.810]  So I'm not introducing anything more.
[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:19.730]  So at that point, I'm just gonna save myself that trouble
[02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:22.370]  in those nights of sleep and just brew a liquid IMO
[02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:24.470]  with IMO three to supply that personally.
[02:28:25.470 --> 02:28:29.790]  Yeah, and it's gonna be a lot lighter mix too, man,
[02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:31.230]  especially, you know, indoors,
[02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:33.750]  you're talking about these large volumes of soil we got.
[02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:37.150]  So you're talking IMO four with the, you know,
[02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:39.350]  outdoor soil, now you're talking about indoors,
[02:28:39.350 --> 02:28:41.190]  you're talking about a lot of weight.
[02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:43.590]  So, you know, one of the mix, my mix,
[02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:46.690]  what I like to do is I like to do that one third peat.
[02:28:47.950 --> 02:28:50.390]  I do one third rice hulls,
[02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:52.910]  and then I do the other third as a combination
[02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:57.910]  of half IMO three and half of my outdoor soil slash compost.
[02:28:59.510 --> 02:29:03.070]  So now that mix is low, it's just all biology.
[02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:04.870]  It's like super living.
[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:07.070]  And it's been working out really well, you know,
[02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:09.490]  and then amended with various amendments.
[02:29:10.750 --> 02:29:13.510]  But, you know, like you said, that IMO four,
[02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:18.510]  indoors, yeah, I probably wouldn't do that heavy soil indoors
[02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:22.190]  but a piece of it, sure, a little bit of it,
[02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:23.790]  definitely will be valuable.
[02:29:23.790 --> 02:29:25.750]  Because see what I do is I build like, you know,
[02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:27.030]  I have my IMO thing going,
[02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:29.550]  but all the while there's always a soil going,
[02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:32.030]  there's always a soil pile outdoors that's, you know,
[02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:33.910]  working like right now it's working, you know,
[02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:36.230]  and I'm adding to every once in a while
[02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:38.150]  when I'm not there, microbes are working it.
[02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:41.190]  So I think that outdoor pile is valuable,
[02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:43.670]  even if you can kind of get you a small pile
[02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:45.190]  just to help bring in a little bit more
[02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:48.310]  that indigenous, you know, local microbiology.
[02:29:48.310 --> 02:29:51.510]  If you do not soil this type setup,
[02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:54.390]  that I just said, the third peat, third rice soils
[02:29:54.390 --> 02:29:57.690]  and third IMO slash compost,
[02:29:57.690 --> 02:30:01.410]  that's a wonderful soil blend for me or call it soil-less.
[02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:05.070]  I use clay and silt and part of my horizontal stuff.
[02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:07.270]  So I don't really call my stuff soil-less,
[02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:11.470]  I'm pretty much soil, but I ain't splitting hairs, man.
[02:30:11.470 --> 02:30:14.070]  My, you know, it's all about results.
[02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:16.390]  You know, we, a lot of us get to the same result
[02:30:16.390 --> 02:30:18.670]  different ways, you know what I'm saying?
[02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:24.120]  So, yes, sir.
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:29.180]  I wrote some, oh, I wanted to get more
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:32.620]  into like the liquid IMOs.
[02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:35.940]  Some people probably heard that as the LEMOs.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:38.420]  That is something where I've seen as a foiler feed
[02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:40.540]  with the naked eye, you could see
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:43.620]  in a large enough establishment, you know,
[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:45.740]  the effects of the overall, you know,
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:48.180]  how they perked up, kind of like the old school trick
[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:51.420]  of Epsom salts with a little bit of yucca extract.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:53.900]  The plants seem to perk up noticeably,
[02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:55.820]  especially to people that might not necessarily
[02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:57.460]  go into the room every day.
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:00.980]  So can you guys kind of talk about what that is
[02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:03.900]  and why it seems like it is a,
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:06.220]  there's just a little extra specialness to it
[02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:07.900]  when it gets to that point.
[02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:09.540]  Yeah, man, it's just a bunch of goodness
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:11.960]  mixed up in one bucket, man.
[02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:16.080]  For those of you that don't know what it is,
[02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:21.240]  liquid IMO or LEMO is for an abbreviation
[02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:22.760]  or acronym or whatever.
[02:31:24.580 --> 02:31:27.740]  It's basically K and S version of like a compost tea,
[02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:29.140]  like an aerated compost tea.
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.060]  I think Chris Trump's the one that kind of started
[02:31:32.060 --> 02:31:35.860]  that whole train after realizing that,
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:38.220]  like trying to apply a lot of this stuff to the acres
[02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:41.380]  that he was trying to run was somewhat difficult
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:43.300]  just because the amount of material that was needed
[02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:44.900]  and you can spray a lot easier, right?
[02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:46.860]  That's why a lot of people use compost teas.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:50.000]  She can inoculate a bigger area with less material
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.520]  and use water as the carrier.
[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:57.320]  But basically what it is, it's a maintenance solution,
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:59.600]  a KMF maintenance solution, which is your vinegar,
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:03.800]  your FPGA and your OHN, humic acid,
[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:05.400]  or actually that's the maintenance solution
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:07.080]  and then your humic acid and seawater.
[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:09.600]  So actually all the material that went into making
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:15.760]  your IMO three, but instead of adding IMO two to it,
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.880]  you're using, but you can use IMO two
[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:19.040]  if that's all you have.
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:23.060]  You're using your IMO three or your IMO four
[02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:24.040]  as your inoculant.
[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:27.280]  And then you're also gonna add some sugar to it
[02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:32.280]  as that initial food source to get the biology kickstarted.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.120]  You're not adding a ton in there.
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:37.400]  You're probably adding an equal amount of that to the IMO.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:40.320]  So if you grab a handful, just like a small handful of that.
[02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:44.700]  And basically that's gonna kind of be the kickstart to it.
[02:32:45.700 --> 02:32:49.100]  I have some pictures and videos on my page.
[02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:51.700]  I think Marco recently has done some stuff too,
[02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:54.380]  where you can actually start seeing the spores of,
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.080]  the fungal spores start to open up
[02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:59.620]  and you start seeing the fungal body start to form.
[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.980]  This can get somewhat controversial for some folks
[02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:07.540]  because the fungus isn't brown,
[02:33:07.540 --> 02:33:09.280]  so it doesn't look beneficial.
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:14.500]  At the same time, I mean, scientists really only know
[02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:16.420]  like 1% of what's underneath the ground
[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:17.900]  or what's in soil anyways.
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:21.180]  But yeah, it's a different method
[02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:25.080]  of creating a sense like a compost tea,
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:26.180]  but just using IMO.
[02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:28.300]  So you can start seeing a lot of these spores opening up
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:30.840]  and the diversity is huge.
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:33.620]  I mean, you'll see not only a few types of bacteria,
[02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:37.380]  but you can probably see eight, nine, 10 different sizes,
[02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:39.060]  varieties, or whatever you wanna call them,
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:40.540]  shapes and sizes and vibrations
[02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:44.180]  of different bacteria moving around.
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:47.220]  You'll also see a bunch of yeast start opening up
[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:48.460]  that look like little clubs,
[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:51.140]  and then you'll start to see fungal spores start to open up.
[02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:52.660]  The only difference is that you're not gonna find
[02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:53.940]  any nematodes in there.
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.780]  You're not gonna find other pieces
[02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:59.420]  that weren't collected in the IMO2 collection.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:03.100]  So that's where, just something to kind of keep in mind.
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:03.940]  Like I was talking about,
[02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:06.100]  it's fungal spores, yeast, and bacteria primarily.
[02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:08.420]  So those three pieces are what you're gonna essentially grow
[02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:10.180]  in this component.
[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:13.180]  So just something to kind of keep in mind,
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:15.860]  but that is an easy way to spray your plants.
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:20.260]  And the reason I wanna bring that up is
[02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:23.860]  when we tend to plant,
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:28.140]  how do I say this?
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:30.740]  Pathogens in a sense try to,
[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:32.880]  they're opportunistic.
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:36.240]  If something is weak, they're gonna move in.
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:38.940]  So the idea is that if we can put enough good guys in,
[02:34:39.980 --> 02:34:42.740]  build a strong enough of a stronghold
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:44.500]  where they can even compete,
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:47.180]  then the idea is that we should hopefully not have
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:51.140]  as many pathogen pressures as you would
[02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:53.300]  if you didn't have something on the leaf surface
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:55.180]  that can out-compete it.
[02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.060]  And that's where, in my opinion,
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:59.980]  Limo is such a powerful force.
[02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:03.060]  I've seen some anecdotal data of some farms
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:05.300]  that were like, yo, we stopped spraying for like three weeks
[02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:08.700]  and I'll never do that again because PM moved in
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:12.660]  or other pieces moved in that they weren't battling
[02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:15.980]  while they were doing their regular weekly
[02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:17.220]  Limo applications.
[02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:24.620]  Yeah, some people are anti-foiler feed
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:26.740]  and then some people swear by it.
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:29.220]  Again, you need to figure this out for yourself,
[02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:34.220]  but I've personally seen fantastic results on both sides.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:37.100]  So it's really up to you.
[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:39.980]  But it seems like on a larger scale,
[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:42.100]  as things start to progress,
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.660]  foiler feeding is where it's at.
[02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.300]  And Limo and Epsom salts
[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.620]  and certain those little tricks over the years,
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.180]  those are definitely warranted.
[02:35:50.700 --> 02:35:54.100]  And I mean, for those that aren't looking to foiler feed,
[02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:56.660]  we don't have to necessarily look at this as a feed.
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:36:00.140]  You're really trying to coat the leaf surface
[02:36:00.140 --> 02:36:01.820]  to protect the leaf surface.
[02:36:03.180 --> 02:36:04.020]  So-
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:07.580]  Yeah, just like those bugs on our skin.
[02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:08.580]  I mean, that's usually kind of how
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:11.500]  that's sold to people, right?
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:14.620]  You're building up the immune system from the forest floor,
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:16.820]  building up that as the utopia.
[02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:18.860]  Then you're going out of your way
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:21.220]  to just add added protection,
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:23.620]  being able to sleep easier at night,
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:27.200]  knowing that you're kind of adding that extra layer
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:28.500]  to the plant skin.
[02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:34.900]  I will say also that Liquid IMO does have an EC to it.
[02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:37.580]  Like after a brew, I just did one not that long ago
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:40.500]  and it was like a 1.2 EC.
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:41.820]  So it was fairly strong.
[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:45.420]  So that's probably attributed to the inputs
[02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:46.780]  that it's made with.
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:49.300]  But I think it's also within that brew,
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:51.900]  microbes are actually really cycling nutrients
[02:36:51.900 --> 02:36:53.140]  that quick, I think.
[02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:57.140]  I probably should have checked it out before and after
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:57.980]  on the EC.
[02:36:57.980 --> 02:37:01.100]  I wish I would have, and I'll do that next time.
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:02.340]  But yeah, I was surprised.
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:05.020]  I was like, wow, the EC was up there pretty good.
[02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:07.020]  And yeah, I used it, man.
[02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:08.860]  Where I used it last time was
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:13.580]  late flower right at the end.
[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:15.540]  I shut water down.
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:17.500]  I started trying some stressing at the end,
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:19.100]  basically last 10 days.
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:21.260]  So I hit them with that Liquid IMO.
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:23.700]  And then that was kind of the last drink they got
[02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:24.540]  for right now.
[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:27.020]  So I think that's going to be valuable.
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:29.300]  I think there's just something about the way
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.020]  all that microbiology that just,
[02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:32.540]  it just recharges everything.
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:34.180]  Like you said, Brian, you could just see it
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:36.040]  like right away, like next day.
[02:37:39.210 --> 02:37:40.730]  And another thing with foliars, guys,
[02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:41.810]  I like to foliar.
[02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:45.090]  I like to keep my FAA foliar all during veg.
[02:37:45.090 --> 02:37:48.650]  I'm more foliar for coating with the biology.
[02:37:48.650 --> 02:37:50.530]  I say that all the time.
[02:37:50.530 --> 02:37:52.410]  Feeds are awesome when you got to hit them,
[02:37:52.410 --> 02:37:53.930]  spot feed and that.
[02:37:53.930 --> 02:37:55.050]  But all throughout veg,
[02:37:55.050 --> 02:37:58.250]  every watering is basically a foliar and a soil drench.
[02:37:58.250 --> 02:38:00.530]  Like I just watered a whole damn plant,
[02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:04.010]  drench everything until flower.
[02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:06.210]  Like you said, man, you just want to keep that contact.
[02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.250]  Like if you go outdoors, you don't have lotion on,
[02:38:08.250 --> 02:38:09.090]  you're going to get ash.
[02:38:09.090 --> 02:38:09.930]  You know what I mean?
[02:38:09.930 --> 02:38:10.770]  You got to keep your plants protected.
[02:38:10.770 --> 02:38:11.590]  You know what I mean?
[02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:12.770]  And keep that coating on there
[02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:16.570]  so they don't get susceptible to these bad guys
[02:38:16.570 --> 02:38:17.810]  that want to get on them.
[02:38:19.330 --> 02:38:22.170]  Now, once we've gotten to IMO 5
[02:38:22.170 --> 02:38:24.090]  and we're talking manures,
[02:38:24.090 --> 02:38:25.410]  especially when we're getting for like,
[02:38:25.410 --> 02:38:27.010]  this is beginner tips.
[02:38:27.010 --> 02:38:29.890]  Once they've maybe gotten, now they're at level five,
[02:38:29.890 --> 02:38:32.370]  do you guys personally feel that maybe they should just work
[02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:35.170]  with the cold manures to dial stuff in?
[02:38:35.170 --> 02:38:37.210]  Or I mean, yeah.
[02:38:37.210 --> 02:38:38.770]  What are your thoughts on that?
[02:38:40.090 --> 02:38:42.290]  I'll leave that to you guys.
[02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:44.610]  I don't mess with too many manures.
[02:38:44.610 --> 02:38:46.570]  I don't have much experience with that.
[02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:50.730]  Yeah, I don't really have much to add on that piece.
[02:38:50.730 --> 02:38:53.290]  Well, you know, like you said, Brian, cold manures,
[02:38:53.290 --> 02:38:54.730]  we talk about them all the time.
[02:38:54.730 --> 02:38:56.890]  Those are your rabbit and alpaca,
[02:38:56.890 --> 02:39:00.370]  or your more famous one, rabbit being better.
[02:39:00.370 --> 02:39:02.290]  My point of view, man, on manures,
[02:39:02.290 --> 02:39:05.530]  and even me, man, where I'm at doing my thing,
[02:39:05.530 --> 02:39:07.170]  I don't care for bringing manures
[02:39:07.530 --> 02:39:09.730]  too much onto the property at all.
[02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:13.730]  I'd much rather make, soak in these greens,
[02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:16.490]  leafy greens and some water and some microbiology,
[02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:19.850]  make them funky, and then kind of make my own manure.
[02:39:21.250 --> 02:39:23.450]  I just don't, you know, Brian, if I was gonna do it, man,
[02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:25.650]  I would literally, if somebody said,
[02:39:25.650 --> 02:39:27.570]  hey man, I got a bunch of manure, do you want it?
[02:39:27.570 --> 02:39:29.970]  I would literally take it and I would set it on the corner
[02:39:29.970 --> 02:39:32.130]  of a property somewhere,
[02:39:32.130 --> 02:39:34.290]  and I wouldn't mess with it for probably a year.
[02:39:34.290 --> 02:39:36.930]  It'd be this time next year, I'd start messing with it.
[02:39:37.690 --> 02:39:38.530]  And my trigger to mess with it
[02:39:38.530 --> 02:39:41.210]  is when I can stick my hand in there
[02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:42.450]  and feel like that soil,
[02:39:42.450 --> 02:39:44.530]  and I'm not sticking my hand in a big pile of shit,
[02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:45.530]  you know what I mean?
[02:39:46.450 --> 02:39:48.210]  Gotta let nature break that down.
[02:39:48.210 --> 02:39:50.170]  And the reason being there's some microbes,
[02:39:50.170 --> 02:39:53.370]  as you know, guys, like everybody hears about it,
[02:39:53.370 --> 02:39:57.770]  you know, the ones that attack the food, salmonella,
[02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:59.530]  the other one, I don't even like to eat shit,
[02:39:59.530 --> 02:40:02.010]  so I don't even remember the names of them.
[02:40:02.010 --> 02:40:04.650]  But the bad guys, the ones that have the,
[02:40:04.650 --> 02:40:06.970]  you always having to break out, you know?
[02:40:06.970 --> 02:40:08.730]  Be careful bringing that stuff to your property,
[02:40:08.730 --> 02:40:09.570]  you know what I mean?
[02:40:09.570 --> 02:40:11.010]  And if you do handle the property,
[02:40:11.010 --> 02:40:14.010]  let the microbes handle it, and then it's safe,
[02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.850]  you know what I mean?
[02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:18.070]  But don't be too anxious to use these hot, fresh manure
[02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:20.170]  that you just got and you don't know what's in it,
[02:40:20.170 --> 02:40:22.930]  could have wormers in it, dewormers,
[02:40:22.930 --> 02:40:25.930]  which are detrimental to your microbiology.
[02:40:27.490 --> 02:40:28.970]  So taking that actually another step,
[02:40:28.970 --> 02:40:30.210]  if somebody wanted to give me manure,
[02:40:30.210 --> 02:40:31.890]  I'd probably say I want to have it tested
[02:40:31.890 --> 02:40:33.570]  before they even bring it to my place,
[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:37.130]  just to see if it's even something I wanted to work with.
[02:40:37.130 --> 02:40:40.290]  But if you knew the inputs, would you rock with it?
[02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:43.570]  Like if it's obviously like, maybe it's my personal question.
[02:40:43.570 --> 02:40:47.170]  So if I wanted to, on a microcosm scale,
[02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:49.130]  go from kind of like IMO3,
[02:40:49.130 --> 02:40:52.050]  and then just drizzle my own kind of vermicompost,
[02:40:52.050 --> 02:40:54.650]  and then rabbit manure, would that take that
[02:40:54.650 --> 02:40:58.970]  to IMO5 on a very small scale?
[02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:02.210]  Yeah, I think so. Sounds about right.
[02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:03.730]  Yeah, you'd have that manure in there.
[02:41:03.730 --> 02:41:07.090]  So you saying take you like a 10 pound of soil,
[02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:09.370]  and you get your 10 pound IMO3,
[02:41:09.370 --> 02:41:11.410]  and then 10 pound of rabbit shit, right?
[02:41:11.410 --> 02:41:13.050]  Boom. Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:14.450]  You can definitely do that like that.
[02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:15.930]  That'd be nice.
[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:16.770]  Yeah.
[02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:17.610]  I mean, cool to see how small,
[02:41:17.610 --> 02:41:19.810]  but that's how it would heat up, you know?
[02:41:19.810 --> 02:41:20.810]  Yeah.
[02:41:20.810 --> 02:41:23.330]  Well, I think just like the aspect of natural farm,
[02:41:23.330 --> 02:41:25.330]  or just natural farming as a whole,
[02:41:26.450 --> 02:41:28.130]  if you have access to manure,
[02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:29.970]  I wouldn't necessarily say go out and source it,
[02:41:30.010 --> 02:41:32.770]  like you have manure on your property,
[02:41:32.770 --> 02:41:34.970]  then yeah, and it's a waste material.
[02:41:34.970 --> 02:41:36.170]  I would, hell yeah, I would use that,
[02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:40.090]  whatever it is, I would try to use that to make IMO5.
[02:41:41.010 --> 02:41:43.650]  That way you can process it just from the sample.
[02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:47.330]  See, the difference is, if it's my animal's manure,
[02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:50.210]  I feel that's different than if it's his animal's manure,
[02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:53.730]  because we all know that you don't know
[02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:57.050]  what goes on behind closed doors, you know what I mean?
[02:41:57.050 --> 02:41:58.530]  So if it was my own, yeah,
[02:41:58.530 --> 02:42:01.130]  if I had my own cow and my own cow shit,
[02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:02.570]  I'd handle that a lot differently,
[02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:04.250]  and I'd be putting that through a process
[02:42:04.250 --> 02:42:07.050]  to try to speed it up and using it faster.
[02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:08.090]  With that unknown though,
[02:42:08.090 --> 02:42:09.890]  definitely would be sitting on that.
[02:42:14.940 --> 02:42:17.540]  This is next level for me, just picking your brains.
[02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:19.820]  I know we're getting close to the end mark here,
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:21.860]  so I wanted to kind of open it up to questions
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.260]  and to the audience.
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:26.460]  And then I really guys encourage you guys to, again,
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.660]  do this kind of stuff,
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:30.620]  even if you're just on a smaller scale.
[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:34.220]  I know you've heard Marco and Johnny mentioned several times
[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:37.100]  like you build something, you set something up,
[02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:38.340]  you get it dialed in,
[02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:40.620]  and then you kind of go to like version 2.0.
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:44.100]  So don't worry about if you didn't make the perfect IMO box,
[02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:47.060]  you know, the first run, you know, maybe you fucked up.
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:49.140]  However, there's so many variables with it,
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:51.380]  but if there's something that's fucked up with that,
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:53.540]  just know that you can continue to improve things.
[02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:58.540]  So very minimal costs with this to really run with it.
[02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:01.740]  And then once you got this as a skillset,
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:04.620]  I promise you that's why we dedicated a whole show to it.
[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:07.980]  Cause I'm encouraged by how excited everybody is
[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:09.940]  to try to understand this.
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:12.060]  And you guys break it down so that the average person
[02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:13.700]  can kind of understand things,
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:17.540]  maybe do a little experiments for themselves,
[02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:19.180]  and then come back to the drawing board,
[02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:20.460]  watch another show or two,
[02:43:20.460 --> 02:43:23.540]  watch some older videos from a variety of mentors,
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:25.780]  and then find your own path.
[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:26.980]  Thank you.
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:29.620]  Very well said, brother.
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:31.820]  Find your path, find somebody to watch.
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.300]  Johnny's a great guy to watch.
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.800]  I saw one question from my buddy, Heather.
[02:43:37.980 --> 02:43:41.220]  She said, how far into, Heather Wright,
[02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:44.460]  how far into Flower would you spray liquid IMO?
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:47.180]  Heather, I wouldn't spray anything after that first week,
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:49.980]  kind of once you start seeing pistols,
[02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:51.940]  knock off the spraying in my opinion.
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:57.940]  Yeah, I would leave that up to how risky you wanna get with
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:00.620]  depending on how much testing is being done.
[02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:04.180]  I've heard from some farmers are like,
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:05.380]  we'll push this all the way through the end
[02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:07.860]  and we've had no issues with microbial testing,
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:09.380]  but I'm not at that level
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:11.100]  and I don't have to get my stuff tested,
[02:44:11.100 --> 02:44:13.960]  but I typically don't spray once the buds are set.
[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:16.380]  At that point I stop.
[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:17.580]  Now with fruits and vegetables,
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:20.140]  I'm spraying fucking all the way.
[02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:23.140]  Cause I'm eating that too and that IMO
[02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:25.100]  and there's money for your own gut biome.
[02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:26.840]  So I'm eating all that shit.
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:31.840]  Well, if we don't have any questions,
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  I did have a personal question again for Marco.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:35.920]  Where'd you get that hat, dude?
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:39.000]  I enjoy hats and that's got like that grandpa bar.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:39.840]  Yeah, man.
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:42.040]  I like that shit, that old school.
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:46.240]  That pineapple with that little, yeah, the grandpa bar.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.720]  I think my wife picked this up for me.
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:50.120]  She got good taste, man.
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:51.280]  Yeah, she does, man.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.560]  Well, if no one else has a question,
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:55.920]  I had a question for Marco.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:58.560]  How do you like to store your IMO?
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:01.520]  Once you get to three and four, how do you like to store it?
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:04.800]  I like to store, well, here's how I like to store it, Johnny.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:08.360]  I like to store it in burlap sacks in a cardboard box,
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:11.360]  but the fucking IMO eats the burlap sack.
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:17.400]  So really, man, I like a wood box
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:19.640]  and then throw my burlap sacks in there.
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:23.200]  But it's crazy, like the IMO actually eats the burlap sack.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.840]  So when you go in there and pick one up later,
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:27.320]  just the bottom just blows out.
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:28.160]  Yeah.
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.280]  How about you, man?
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:31.680]  I started using sandbags.
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:32.960]  Okay, yeah.
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:35.480]  Okay, so then you don't have to worry
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:36.920]  about them eating it up.
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:38.400]  Yeah, I don't have to worry about them eating it up.
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:40.520]  They'll still breathe a little bit.
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:43.080]  And I don't have to worry about like the little pieces
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:46.160]  as it dries out further, like falling out of the bag
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:48.520]  where I start losing a bunch of spores.
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:49.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:50.880 --> 02:45:51.720]  There you go.
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:55.760]  Yeah, okay, I look at your barn from SD Microbe, I see you.
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:57.840]  Yeah, that's where I got that idea.
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:00.120]  He sent me some compost and I checked it.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:02.520]  I was like, oh man, this would be perfect for some IMO.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:05.400]  Hey, Uline comes through once again.
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:06.240]  All day.
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.200]  I hate to admit it, but yeah, man,
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:11.640]  they came in pretty clutch with that,
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:13.760]  you know, next day delivery, you gotta say.
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:15.080]  I like that.
[02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:16.120]  You gotta love Uline.
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:17.880]  We did have a couple of questions from chat
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:19.760]  that I can go over here with you.
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:23.080]  And I'll put one up here real quick,
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:25.160]  but there's a question in front of it.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:30.840]  Question being is when you're inside, indoors, in containers,
[02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:35.440]  what is the significance of having local microbes
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:37.360]  in action there in the IMO?
[02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.920]  What is the significance there?
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:41.560]  It'll save you money from going to the store
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:44.000]  and buying more shit and being a consumer.
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:44.840]  That's it.
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:46.160]  Perfect, perfect.
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:47.560]  I mean, you could go to the store
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:50.120]  and you can go buy bugs in a jug or all that stuff.
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:50.960]  But I mean, think about it.
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.000]  What you're spending, is it actually there?
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.880]  That's something that we hear a lot.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:57.040]  Is the microbial count there?
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.080]  Who knows, right?
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:02.360]  So for me, I'm not a farmer,
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:04.760]  but as someone that produces my own medicine
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:06.160]  and my own food, right?
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:09.520]  Like farmers are producers, not consumers.
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:14.080]  So stop consuming and start producing.
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.520]  Kind of the way that I look at it from.
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:16.920]  And start making your own stuff.
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:21.040]  And yeah, I mean, you're not gonna get those microbes,
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:23.240]  that diversity of microbes in a jug.
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:24.080]  Let's just be real.
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.000]  Like you're gonna find consortiums
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.640]  that are one, two, three different microbes
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:29.040]  that do something special.
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:31.040]  But to have that big of diversity,
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:33.040]  you're just not gonna get in a jug.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.880]  And they won't live, they won't survive long.
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:37.400]  The reason you want these microbes,
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:38.920]  because they're gonna cycle these nutrients,
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:40.520]  even in your pot.
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:42.160]  Things in your pot, these microbes
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:44.240]  are gonna be giving your plant available nutrients.
[02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:46.760]  So that's why you want bigger pots, the better.
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:50.320]  It just helps that cycle a little bit more.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:51.160]  That's awesome.
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:52.200]  I just wanna say that,
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:53.960]  that couldn't have been answered more perfectly.
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:54.840]  So thank you.
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:56.320]  I just wanted to add real quick,
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:58.240]  the Oregon Department of Ag
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:01.440]  did supposedly a pretty decent study
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:04.480]  on microbials in bottles.
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:06.800]  And you can go for yourself.
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:09.080]  It's a couple of Google searches, I think.
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.960]  And you can find that for yourself.
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:13.960]  And it names the companies right there for you.
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:16.040]  So it's pretty eye-opening.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:19.640]  Especially with some of those brands,
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:22.360]  you're paying for brown colored water,
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:26.200]  or yellow kind of colored looking water.
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:27.880]  So just buyer beware with this stuff.
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:29.040]  That's the whole point of this show,
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.960]  is that you guys minimize mistakes,
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:34.320]  minimize wasted money.
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:35.560]  And time and effort,
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:38.280]  and knowing what you're doing with your own inputs,
[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:39.560]  that can't be overstated.
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:42.680]  I mean, that's why we devote multiple shows to it.
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:44.520]  I mean, this is how you're gonna be able
[02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:46.680]  to build up something that nobody else has.
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:48.240]  So you're gonna have nutrient dense food.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:49.080]  You're gonna have medicine
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:51.400]  that's actually being beneficial to your loved ones,
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:52.920]  people that actually need that.
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:55.200]  And you're taking the time to understand these things
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.600]  so that you can continue that process.
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:00.240]  And that's where karma, all good things come.
[02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:02.160]  When you're going out of your way
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:06.800]  to produce something that is noticeably beneficial,
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:09.360]  being beneficial to your loved ones,
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:10.920]  it really comes back tenfold, man,
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:12.680]  just life in general and health.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:15.080]  And I've been watching a lot of like,
[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:17.480]  kind of these older individuals
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:19.800]  that seem like high wealth individuals.
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:21.680]  And yes, they have a lot of money and stuff.
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:23.400]  But when you talk about health,
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:26.240]  that seems to be the one thing where they just,
[02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:27.480]  most people don't talk about that.
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:30.160]  So when you're really eating a bunch of processed foods
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:31.520]  and you're not really thinking about,
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:34.920]  you're not conscious of what you're eating on a daily basis,
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:36.240]  the weeks go by, the months go by,
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:37.480]  it's the same shit with you, dude,
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:38.480]  same thing with your plants.
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:42.520]  So if you can continue to just think deeper on that level,
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:44.080]  start to notice the small things
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:45.560]  and you don't wanna make small changes.
[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:48.200]  And that's when stack those little Ws
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.680]  and things will change for you.
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:52.120]  On the microbial side, as well as your gut health
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:53.720]  and just your mental health,
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:56.240]  I do believe there is a correlation with that.
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:59.160]  And Leighton and I talked about that on the show last week.
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:02.480]  I do believe that when you feel bad, you're eating bad,
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:05.280]  you're not going outside, you're doing all of those,
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:08.280]  we could go on and on with those kinds of things.
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:11.720]  There's going to be some kind of repercussion for that.
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:14.120]  Like you need to go outside, you need to eat healthy food,
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:18.080]  you need to realize that this is a pretty bad-ass machine
[02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:21.520]  that we're able to operate on such a high level.
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:23.540]  Why wouldn't we need high level nutrients,
[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:27.400]  dense level nutrients to operate at a high level?
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:30.360]  And that's intellectually, I think that's what this show,
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.640]  it stimulates me because we are able to talk
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:33.880]  a variety of different things,
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.400]  talk about tinfoil questions,
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.520]  as well as tried and true sound information.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:42.240]  And that's where a lot of this is getting out, Chad.
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:43.480]  And I hope in time, buddy,
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:45.320]  that more and more individuals see
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:48.000]  that not only are we organic farming,
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.320]  but now we're kind of just taking it like, yes,
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:54.080]  I mean, now we're all trying to understand mother nature.
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.240]  Right.
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:57.300]  Bigger picture, because like you're saying,
[02:50:57.300 --> 02:51:00.400]  it leads to a lot more things than just a better yield.
[02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:02.400]  So, yeah.
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.080]  And then there was a question here on the screen too,
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:07.980]  is about what about making IMO3 on your indoor beds?
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:12.280]  Bet you guys take that.
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:13.480]  Yeah, I'm a fan.
[02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:15.360]  I've never done it,
[02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:17.120]  because I don't have beds to be able to do that on.
[02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:20.520]  What I've seen produced off of them has been phenomenal.
[02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:22.620]  I think there's a dude out of Puerto Rico
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:23.460]  that I've seen do it.
[02:51:23.460 --> 02:51:25.560]  I forget his Instagram handle, but-
[02:51:25.560 --> 02:51:27.000]  PRKNF.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.040]  Yeah, PRKNF.
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:29.720]  He did some stuff on his beds.
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:30.920]  That stuff looked great.
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:35.280]  Also, there's a farm out in Colorado.
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:36.660]  I forget the name of the farm,
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:39.440]  but that's what they've done some of their IMO collections
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:41.920]  and things like that on the beds themselves,
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:44.360]  just because they didn't have a floor to do it on
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:45.520]  during the winter time.
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:48.600]  But yeah, I would do it.
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:49.960]  You just need something breathable, right?
[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:54.040]  And if your substrate that you're growing in is aerobic
[02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:57.520]  and it's a breathing, living system, fuck hell, why not?
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:51:58.720]  That sounds like a great idea.
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:51:59.560]  I would.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:01.840]  Nice.
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:03.560]  And here's another one here.
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:04.400]  I'll just read them.
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:05.520]  I don't know if you can see them over there.
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.480]  I'll be the narrator of the day.
[02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:09.700]  But how often should an IMO be applied
[02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:12.400]  to no-till living soil beds indoors
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:14.220]  that are perpetually cycled?
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:17.520]  That's a tough one.
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:21.400]  I would love to say, get a microscope and see if you need it
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:24.400]  would be my more approach to people
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.200]  that have access to that technology.
[02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:27.240]  I would do it.
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:31.580]  If not, I think it's just gonna be,
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:36.120]  I'll apply a liquid feed or microbes
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:37.160]  almost every watering,
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.680]  because I'm adding in my JLFs
[02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:41.760]  and my fermented pine extracts
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:43.760]  and different things like that.
[02:52:43.760 --> 02:52:48.080]  So I typically do it a couple of times a month,
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:50.080]  maybe every other week I'll spray.
[02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:52.320]  But once I get into flower and stuff,
[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:53.760]  I'm not spraying the plants,
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:55.040]  kind of just soak the soil a little bit.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.600]  The thing is that there's already a balance in there.
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:01.560]  So I'm really not trying to sway that balance off too much.
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:05.720]  I just wanna add a little bit to kind of inoculate.
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:07.560]  So that's a tough question to answer.
[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:09.720]  That's a question that I've had for a long time
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:12.000]  that I wish I had a clear cut answer on,
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.560]  even for myself, but I haven't been able to get one.
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:20.680]  So many times it comes down to, it depends.
[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:24.640]  And that really is a legit answer and not just a cop-out,
[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:29.360]  especially on a lot of these that involve so many variables,
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:31.200]  but you can get close sometimes.
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:33.760]  And I think that was a good way of going about it.
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:40.160]  Yeah, I will say that my stuff's almost like one third IMO.
[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:43.040]  And I still add, after the end of a run,
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:45.600]  I'll still refresh my bed.
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:47.640]  And I do that with my old Horizon.
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:50.120]  I'll just freshen that back up.
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:52.400]  Some alfalfa, whatever I may have,
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:55.080]  some IMO, new top layer.
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:56.160]  Now when I'm watering in,
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:54:00.280]  just kind of precipitating in some more microbes.
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:03.800]  Like when I amend, I add IMO three with it as well.
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:05.680]  So it's gonna start breaking down that process.
[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:07.600]  I'll mix some compost with the amendments.
[02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:09.520]  So that way, hopefully the humics will start binding
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:11.240]  to a lot of those minerals.
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.440]  And then I'll add IMO to add a little bit more diversity.
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:15.680]  And that's what I'll use as like my top dress.
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:17.000]  Nice.
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:20.880]  And I guess that kind of leads into an earlier question too,
[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:23.160]  was can you overuse IMO?
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:26.280]  Is there such a thing as like overdosing on the IMO?
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:28.240]  I haven't done it yet.
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:31.280]  And I've pushed the fucking limits.
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:33.280]  I was just about to say,
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:35.320]  somebody that I looked up to was like,
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.200]  it's gonna be pretty hard for how quickly cannabis flips
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:41.800]  for you to ever achieve the ultimate utopia
[02:54:41.800 --> 02:54:43.560]  and keep it at that point.
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:45.360]  So that's why you just always assume
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:47.480]  that you're always kind of setting these protocols
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:48.840]  and rocking with that.
[02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:51.640]  But then also adjusting if certain things,
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:53.280]  like if something goes out haywire,
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:54.840]  then obviously reassess.
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:57.120]  Right.
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:00.440]  Please go ahead.
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:01.800]  Because the idea of IMO, right,
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:04.080]  is it's a fungal inoculant.
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:08.320]  And are we really truly reaching like 100% fungus?
[02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:09.160]  No.
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:11.840]  So I mean, realistically,
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:14.560]  like you could keep adding more and more of it
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.160]  because all you're doing is really trying
[02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.920]  to increase your fungal numbers
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:19.480]  and the fungal spores.
[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:21.440]  And if you're growing in a soilless medium,
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:22.280]  you're growing, I mean,
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.920]  Pete's antimicrobial to start with in a sense, right?
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:26.000]  Like right off the bat.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.320]  So like it's, or antifungal, should I say?
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:30.760]  So like in a sense,
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:33.720]  it's you're gonna have to be continuously adding
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:37.840]  more microbes to it,
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.640]  just to kind of keep that substrate going
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:41.040]  the way that you want it to.
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.200]  So I don't think you can overdo it.
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:47.360]  Chad, do a hair toss and show off that shirt.
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:50.360]  Bam, future of cannabis project.
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:54.880]  That's what we do at night on Zooms
[02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:56.160]  when we're not on the air.
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:58.160]  We just go back and forth and hair toss.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:01.520]  One more question though,
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:04.120]  that we had from Chad coming in here earlier.
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:05.760]  Cause I know you guys talked a lot about, you know,
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:08.040]  having to really watch the pile for temperature,
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:10.160]  having to flip it, you know,
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:11.720]  higher temperature,
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:13.800]  you can affect a lot of things that way.
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:16.760]  Now, granted, if you had room to make a whole bunch,
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.000]  it's great because obviously it looks like
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.440]  it stores very well for you, mindfully rooted.
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.440]  But if somebody was going to maybe try
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:26.160]  to make a small batch,
[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:28.040]  what is like the critical mass?
[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:30.800]  How small can you actually go
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:34.200]  before you lose the reactions that you're looking for
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:36.360]  from the composting effects?
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:39.400]  So, I think,
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:41.280]  I'm not sure how to put this in context.
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:42.920]  So, part of that,
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.520]  I'm going to use that cop out, it depends.
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:48.960]  Because it depends on like the environment.
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.080]  I've made piles as small as two five gallon buckets.
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:57.800]  So, if you can fit two five gallon buckets, cool.
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:00.200]  If you have like, I think I had palms in my yard that year
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:01.560]  when I made that pile.
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:02.960]  And I just laid a bunch of palms on it
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:04.920]  to kind of create a like a little microclimate on it.
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:06.080]  And that worked for me.
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:08.120]  So, basically made 10 gallons of it.
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:11.080]  But the thing is that like,
[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:13.680]  if it's too cold outside, right?
[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:15.120]  And the pile is too small,
[02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:16.480]  the internal core temperature
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:19.040]  is basically gonna be the same temperature as the outside.
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:20.680]  So, you have to make sure
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:22.160]  that there's enough material on the inside
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.360]  so that the outside, in a sense, right?
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:25.680]  Will kind of insulate the inside
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:27.320]  to where it can start cooking.
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:28.920]  Because you need the inside to cook.
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:30.000]  Because what's going to happen is
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.800]  the microbes are going to multiply in the middle.
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:34.480]  When you turn the pile,
[02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:37.040]  I'm sorry, they're gonna multiply in the middle
[02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:39.040]  and then sporulate because it's too hot.
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:41.400]  When you flip the pile, now the spores are on the outside.
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:42.680]  And then the spores on the inside,
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:45.160]  as it's warming back up, can start opening up.
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:46.240]  And then they sporulate again.
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:47.240]  And then they go back out.
[02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:48.880]  And it just kind of starts creating spores
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.400]  around the entire piece.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.800]  So, you just need the pile big enough
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:55.360]  to where the middle will get hot.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:57.240]  And I have found the smallest that I've made
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:58.520]  is two five gallon buckets.
[02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:00.040]  And that seemed to work for me.
[02:58:00.040 --> 02:58:02.120]  I haven't gone any smaller than that.
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:03.960]  And was that the indoors
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:06.280]  with the typical ambient indoor temperature?
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:08.320]  No, I actually did that out in my yard.
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:11.600]  But my climate's pretty temperate.
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:13.360]  I mean, I'm in Southern California.
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:16.200]  Every day's a teacher day.
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:17.160]  Yeah, every day's a teacher.
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:18.520]  I mean, I'm gonna sweat shirt year round
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:20.400]  because I'm fucking cold all the time.
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:21.240]  But yeah.
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:25.320]  I would die in your guys' part of the woods, man.
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:29.880]  And I guess I just have one personal question too.
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:32.480]  Is because you're talking about
[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:35.480]  collecting at different locations.
[02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:37.720]  And a little bit of here, a little bit of there is great
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:39.560]  because you kind of have a little bit of everything
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:42.760]  and you can kind of prep the plants or the soil for it.
[02:58:44.200 --> 02:58:46.000]  So, when we're collecting, is it,
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.800]  the microbes we're not necessarily knowing
[02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:51.440]  specifically by name which ones we're getting,
[02:58:51.440 --> 02:58:54.000]  but we're knowing that we're getting beneficial ones.
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:57.360]  So, that's why if I did a pile here and a pile there,
[02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:59.200]  I'm just taking really the beneficials.
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:01.120]  And I'm not like, well, this is to extract those
[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:03.480]  stupid competitive piles and this is, you know.
[02:59:05.080 --> 02:59:06.560]  Exactly, right?
[02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:09.520]  Nature doesn't, you're grabbing a little bit of everything.
[02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:11.720]  You might even get some anaerobes in there too.
[02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:13.120]  But they're part of the picture.
[02:59:13.120 --> 02:59:13.960]  It's part of the balance.
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:15.160]  They're in nature for a reason.
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:16.760]  They serve a purpose.
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:18.440]  So, you're gonna get a little bit of everything.
[02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:20.760]  And yeah, it's almost like a shotgun approach.
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:21.960]  You're throwing all the microbes,
[02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:24.920]  be building as much diversity in there as possible.
[02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:27.960]  Some people farm using particular microbes
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.760]  and they found that if I use this, it'll help with that.
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:35.840]  But to me, it's like, the science isn't that interesting
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.680]  to me for me to dive into it like that.
[02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:40.000]  To me, it's creating something that's very diverse
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.240]  that I can just apply and I'm like, hey, look, it worked.
[02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:44.160]  Like, that seems to be more my style.
[02:59:45.720 --> 02:59:47.640]  So, yeah, that's, yeah.
[02:59:47.640 --> 02:59:49.880]  Basically, it's just a shotgun approach with it.
[02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:50.720]  Cool.
[02:59:50.720 --> 02:59:51.880]  Trust in the process.
[02:59:51.880 --> 02:59:52.720]  Yeah.
[02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:53.560]  Got a lot to do with it.
[02:59:54.920 --> 02:59:56.040]  Awesome.
[02:59:56.040 --> 02:59:58.600]  Well, I think for house cleaning,
[02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:01.120]  I know we'll be back tomorrow morning.
[03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:04.840]  Brian and Leighton are going to be in the house.
[03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:08.200]  We have a guest coming on with you tomorrow morning, Brian.
[03:00:08.200 --> 03:00:09.040]  We do.
[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:11.360]  We have, I feel like everybody's favorite,
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:13.120]  if you haven't checked him out,
[03:00:13.120 --> 03:00:15.080]  his name is Smiley's Garden.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:17.120]  Brilliant, brilliant mind.
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:19.960]  Yeah, definitely somebody in the community
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:21.960]  that everybody loves and respects.
[03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:23.720]  So, it's gonna be fun to chop it up
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:27.560]  and listen to Smiley and Leighton kind of go back and forth.
[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:29.160]  And I hope to guide that.
[03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:32.520]  So, if you guys have specific questions, let me know.
[03:00:32.520 --> 03:00:35.640]  Yeah, I'll have to set the alarm clock early on that one.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:38.160]  You know, it is only 10 a.m. on the West Coast
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:39.000]  that one starts.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.680]  So, that's an alarm clock.
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:44.240]  And later that evening, we've got Hota Herb.
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:46.600]  And definitely keep your eye on FCP02.
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:51.040]  I know London has a bunch of great topics coming up.
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:53.560]  And for me, I'm excited Friday evening,
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:56.160]  7 p.m. on the West Coast, 10 p.m. on the East Coast,
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:58.520]  I will be here with AK Beanbrains.
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:00.200]  So, that's gonna be an awesome conversation.
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:02.480]  We talked for about three hours the other day.
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:04.440]  It's gonna be a fun one.
[03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:06.360]  So, check us out Friday.
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:07.760]  That'll be a good one.
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:09.160]  And please, gentlemen,
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:11.160]  I'd love to give everybody the last words.
[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:12.920]  Brian and Marco, we'll start with you guys
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:15.280]  and then Mindfully Rooted, we'll let you close it out.
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:17.240]  Hopefully like you brought us in today.
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:18.600]  Yeah, I'll go ahead, man.
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:19.920]  And then you can finish it off, Brian.
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:22.080]  I just wanna say thank you, Johnny.
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:23.320]  This is wonderful, man.
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:25.520]  It started off really nice, started off peaceful.
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:28.280]  And I tell you, man, it's seven o'clock.
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:32.600]  And usually I get real antsy about 6.15,
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:34.600]  about 45 minutes ago.
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:36.680]  And this has been so pleasant, man,
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:39.320]  that I've been actually hanging in there.
[03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:42.280]  So, my ass isn't on fire today
[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:44.440]  because my mind is focused.
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.640]  And I appreciate that, man.
[03:01:45.640 --> 03:01:47.520]  And I like that little exercise we did
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:49.040]  with the leaves flowing by our stream.
[03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:50.040]  I think that's pretty cool.
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:51.760]  I'm gonna try that when I'm just sitting back,
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:53.280]  trying to relax.
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:54.960]  Yeah, man, thank you for sharing everything
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:56.200]  with the community, brother.
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:58.840]  And I'll see you on IG and on text.
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:05.800]  Yeah, shout out to the audience yourselves.
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:07.760]  A lot of you guys continue to reach out
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:09.040]  and ask for certain things.
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.160]  And I hope that you see as we're doing this,
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:15.720]  and I hope that you see as time progresses,
[03:02:15.720 --> 03:02:18.000]  I'm trying to fulfill those things as best I can
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.040]  with people that wanna come on the show.
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.440]  And when people wanted to talk IMOs,
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:26.160]  I thought these two gentlemen to have a conversation,
[03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:27.640]  hopefully continue,
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:29.840]  we obviously can continue this conversation.
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:31.320]  There's a lot of things to understand
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:33.040]  when it comes to natural farming,
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:37.280]  but indigenous microorganisms to maybe the newer world
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:38.160]  that hasn't understood that.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:39.720]  I hope that's now in your vernacular
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:42.200]  and you start to maybe really start to understand
[03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:43.360]  soil food web,
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.440]  just these little bullet points that really stick out.
[03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:48.760]  And then once you understand that,
[03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:50.040]  you start to see it for yourself,
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:51.320]  build this for yourself,
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:53.600]  that's when you're contagious with it.
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:55.680]  And you wanna obviously help others
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:02:58.320]  and it just improves almost anything
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:00.880]  that you're rocking with.
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:03.560]  So again, shout out to you guys for being students
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:06.120]  of what it really takes to grow medicine
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:09.720]  and to grow nutrient dense food.
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:13.120]  Yeah, this was cool, man.
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:15.880]  I really appreciate you guys having me on here
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:20.120]  and being able to talk this process through
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:22.880]  something that I just enjoy doing all my free time
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:26.760]  and then maybe eventually turn it into something full time,
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:28.000]  but this has been great for me.
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:32.640]  And I appreciate you guys looking to me as,
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:34.520]  quote unquote, an expert in this type of thing
[03:03:34.520 --> 03:03:35.560]  or specialists in this.
[03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:37.440]  And it means a lot.
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:39.760]  It's very humbling to be on here with you all.
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:43.960]  And everybody that participated in that exercise,
[03:03:43.960 --> 03:03:46.240]  thank you for giving me that opportunity
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:50.920]  to share something that brings me peace with you all.
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:53.320]  And just remember your thoughts and your feelings
[03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:54.840]  are gonna hook you from time to time.
[03:03:54.840 --> 03:03:57.760]  And they pass right that wave
[03:03:57.760 --> 03:03:59.920]  and just put it on a cloud
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:01.360]  or put it on a leaf on a moving car
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:03.000]  and just let it go by the same way it came in,
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:03.840]  it'll go out.
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:06.240]  Feelings change, they ebb and flow.
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:09.000]  So just remember that as you carry on your day-to-day life.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:09.880]  So thank you all.
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:13.240]  Awesome, very excellent.
[03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:15.720]  I thoroughly enjoyed this and everybody in chat,
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:17.120]  thank you for being here.
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:19.920]  Everyone, thank you for watching on replay.
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.840]  And Brian and Marco will be back same time next week.
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:24.960]  So until then, enjoy your day.
