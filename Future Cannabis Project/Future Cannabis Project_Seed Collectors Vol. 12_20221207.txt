[00:07.740 --> 00:26.780]  Welcome back everybody. We are on another edition of the Sea Collectors up to volume
[00:26.780 --> 00:33.620]  12. That's hard to do with two hands, man. I don't think it's possible unless you're
[00:33.620 --> 00:40.220]  like Edgar Montoya's twin brother or something. He only had 11 though. It'd be difficult to
[00:40.220 --> 00:49.060]  get 12 fingers. Heartbreaking. Yes. And I mean, episode 12, that's where we are. Yes.
[00:49.060 --> 00:55.620]  Episode 12. Thank you guys and girls for tuning in again. We have a lot of fun on this show
[00:55.620 --> 01:03.220]  and you may notice we are short one member this evening. We are short Dave. He had some
[01:03.220 --> 01:09.060]  unavoidable things pop up at the last minute. So respect to Dave. I hope everything goes
[01:09.060 --> 01:13.380]  well for you, buddy. And we'll see you later this month. Actually, Dave's got something
[01:13.380 --> 01:18.540]  special lined up for later this month. Might be another two episode month here. So nice.
[01:18.540 --> 01:25.100]  Yeah. Stay tuned to that one. I'm excited. He's Dave puts in the work, man. He does,
[01:25.100 --> 01:31.020]  man. He does in the garden, in the, in the, the, the, the live shows. I mean, he's doing
[01:31.020 --> 01:38.900]  it all. He does. And battling you in auctions, which is actually how we came about. So for
[01:38.900 --> 01:44.660]  everybody watching tonight, James is your return guest. He was on episode seven of the
[01:44.660 --> 01:50.460]  seed collectors go back and watch it. It's a fun one, fricking a wealth of knowledge.
[01:50.460 --> 01:54.100]  And James, that's why, you know, we wanted to have you back tonight. Both Dave and I
[01:54.100 --> 02:00.860]  were like, we need James. So thank you for making time and coming back. Absolutely. Yeah.
[02:01.700 --> 02:07.900]  I'm very happy to be back. I love, love chatting about such something that I'm so passionate
[02:07.900 --> 02:13.820]  about and a subject that I mean, obviously, you know, Dave and I have been friends for
[02:13.820 --> 02:20.260]  quite some time. And honestly, we met if you didn't see the last one, we met actually battling
[02:20.260 --> 02:26.620]  it out for different charity auctions and stuff of seeds once upon a time. And honestly,
[02:26.620 --> 02:31.340]  we just kept up with one another from there. And when I, when I started to notice that
[02:31.340 --> 02:36.500]  you guys were doing some of these, cause he's always been really big into the collecting,
[02:36.500 --> 02:41.700]  you know, market over the last several, several years. And when I saw that you guys were doing
[02:41.700 --> 02:46.620]  something like this, I was like, Hey man, you know, if you know, your buddy, Chad, like
[02:46.620 --> 02:51.060]  I, you know, it seems like a great guy. You know, if, if you guys want to have me on sometime,
[02:51.060 --> 02:55.060]  we can do this. It'd be, it'd be a lot of fun. And you know, yeah, if you go back and
[02:55.060 --> 03:00.740]  watch it, it's a lot of laughs and it's pretty much just half of it is just Dave and I just
[03:00.740 --> 03:05.780]  kind of cracking wise at one another the whole time. And yeah, it's, it's, it's awesome.
[03:05.780 --> 03:11.060]  And me, me singing vanilla ice in the background. I was actually, that was on there. We do have
[03:11.060 --> 03:16.980]  that recorded for, for posterity. It is of course, it doesn't take much out of me to
[03:16.980 --> 03:21.740]  start singing a vanilla ice. So just, just a little, just a little, just a little nudge
[03:21.740 --> 03:28.180]  is all I need. A shout out Lugo Mez. He says, rewatch the Mila conversation last night.
[03:28.180 --> 03:32.700]  That was a fun one too, with Mila Jansen, the hash queen. It was her birthday yesterday.
[03:32.700 --> 03:39.620]  So everybody wants to go to her IgE. And I think it's like, I want to say eighties in
[03:39.620 --> 03:47.260]  the eighties. I hope I'm not adding too many years there, but yeah, she's the hash queen.
[03:47.260 --> 03:52.780]  I mean, check her out. Mila Jansen from Columbia with love. He says, awesome. And I know the
[03:52.780 --> 03:59.540]  Dabadoo events were just down there too. And oddly enough, Friday, Saturday, I'm going
[03:59.540 --> 04:05.820]  to have two winners from separate Dabadoo events on talking about organic growing and
[04:05.820 --> 04:12.420]  how they do it all. But that's that we're talking seeds and anybody who's watched the
[04:12.420 --> 04:17.180]  seed collector shows know that I like to start out with a t-shirt. Usually the t-shirt I'm
[04:18.100 --> 04:23.180]  wearing, it's a company I like, products I like, people I like, seeds I like. We've done
[04:23.180 --> 04:29.540]  like Bud and Lather, Eagles Gardens. Last episode, it was FCP, Future Cannabis Project.
[04:29.540 --> 04:30.540]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[04:30.540 --> 04:38.780]  So anybody that goes on the Daga site, there are more than beans on the Daga site. Stop.
[04:38.780 --> 04:43.340]  Portal Dreams is tempting me. Ice Ice Baby chants starting getting louder. Man, what
[04:44.340 --> 04:49.900]  are you going to do? Okay, so I'll skip that. I'm going to go. I'm actually, I make a couple
[04:49.900 --> 04:55.340]  of different t-shirts myself. I have the traditional Twin Peaks logo, the owl that you saw. I like
[04:55.340 --> 05:02.620]  that one, but I wanted to wear this one for this show. So everybody take a look.
[05:02.620 --> 05:04.900]  Oh my gosh. Is that fantastic?
[05:04.900 --> 05:07.060]  Read it loud.
[05:07.060 --> 05:10.780]  That is awesome, man.
[05:10.780 --> 05:18.380]  So I joked on previous episodes, every time I say cookies or burner, I get $2. Bam. Thank
[05:18.380 --> 05:23.940]  you, burner. Appreciate it. Sure, there'll be more where that comes from. That's my retirement
[05:23.940 --> 05:24.940]  fund right there.
[05:24.940 --> 05:25.940]  There you go, man. There you go.
[05:25.940 --> 05:31.580]  I just make fun of cookies and burner. So, all right. So we got this one out of the way
[05:31.580 --> 05:37.220]  and we actually kind of, I mean, we chat in the background and we had some fun things
[05:37.220 --> 05:43.980]  to discuss on this show. We're going to talk about finding, you know, new breeders, where
[05:43.980 --> 05:48.560]  to find some of these things and you know, maybe why that's important or something people
[05:48.560 --> 05:56.420]  should start looking for. But we also got to have what's new. So definitely got to have
[05:56.420 --> 06:00.540]  what's new, man. What's new in the collection this time, James?
[06:00.860 --> 06:12.660]  Well, you know, to be honest, we've been doing a lot of, you know, hunting through some older
[06:12.660 --> 06:21.940]  heirloom land race kind of work. So we've been getting into like some of the Afghan
[06:21.940 --> 06:31.500]  selection stuff, some of the work from Afghan selection. We got the Shulgar region. We got
[06:31.500 --> 06:40.540]  the, we got Kunduz region. We're working through and we get, this is one of their old ones.
[06:40.540 --> 06:44.580]  I think this was the ball cash plant one, actually, if I'm not mistaken.
[06:44.580 --> 06:46.300]  And are these all regular?
[06:46.300 --> 06:51.940]  They are. Yep. Yep. These are, these are a hundred percent straight from heirloom, like legacy
[06:51.940 --> 06:58.580]  farmers out in, you know, different parts of Afghanistan. And to be honest, some of the better
[06:58.580 --> 07:06.220]  stuff that we, that we parse through right now is really, we've been doing a big feno hunt of some
[07:06.220 --> 07:17.460]  of the stuff from Azad Kashmir right now. And that is, you know, what, during the like mid 2000s,
[07:18.020 --> 07:26.900]  there was a huge boom of some just outstanding Hindu Kush, Afghani plants that were making it
[07:26.900 --> 07:36.740]  into all of our genetics. The Afghani bull rider, the, the big red Hindu that, that, that Minjin used to
[07:36.780 --> 07:47.300]  work with extensively. A lot of those plants that, that honestly set us up to be able to make so many of the
[07:47.300 --> 07:58.020]  strains that are present today are sadly, you know, are gone. You know, their, the cuts have been lost, the, or
[07:58.020 --> 08:03.740]  they, they, you know, for one reason or another, they're gone from the gardens. And, you know, we have a, we have
[08:03.740 --> 08:11.820]  a very extensive mother room. We have about, I think on last count, it's somewhere right around 50 mom plants in
[08:11.820 --> 08:19.780]  our, in our garden. And our head grower is just a, is just a superstar and, and just loves taking care of them. But,
[08:20.500 --> 08:31.500]  you know, we, I acquire these from, from old head farmers all over the, the US and beyond sometimes. And it's
[08:31.500 --> 08:40.700]  something that is really going without is the, these, these beautiful pieces to a, to a genetics lineage that just
[08:40.700 --> 08:47.420]  doesn't exist anymore. And so we were like, you know what, we got to get back into this a little bit more. And, you
[08:47.420 --> 08:55.540]  know, we've always been, all of the cuts that you'll find in our garden right now are pretty much all, I would say, you
[08:55.540 --> 09:07.220]  know, two, you know, nothing, maybe one or two strains, you know, post 2015, 2016, but otherwise, all stuff back going
[09:07.220 --> 09:17.060]  into the, you know, the early 2000s, the 90s, even the 80s, some of it, like a really old Durban poison plant that goes
[09:17.060 --> 09:30.140]  back to, all the way back to, to early, early days. We have a 35-year-old Indiana bubblegum original. We got some, some
[09:30.140 --> 09:37.260]  really interesting stuff like that. But, you know, those all came from a beautiful combination of, of landrace and
[09:37.260 --> 09:44.580]  heirloom genetics. And so, you know, we really wanted to start from the ground up a little bit with some of our projects
[09:44.620 --> 09:54.780]  and, you know, figure out exactly what we needed to do to build, put those building blocks in order so that when we come to
[09:55.020 --> 10:02.500]  the garden, we are really confident in what we are getting consistently time and time again. And, and to be honest, if we're
[10:03.020 --> 10:11.220]  passing out seeds to anybody else, if we're sharing genetics, if we're doing whatever, there's no way in the world that, that my
[10:11.220 --> 10:19.140]  team and I are going to share genetics that aren't like tip-top shape, that, that aren't going to produce the very best medicine
[10:19.140 --> 10:27.620]  or flower that we can possibly make happen for somebody. Because I am not going to put that in somebody's hands and say, Oh,
[10:27.620 --> 10:38.180]  good luck with this. It's not going to happen. So, been doing a lot in, in that area. We also have some, some fun, some
[10:38.180 --> 10:47.700]  exciting little star, star dog hunt that we're doing, which is kind of fun of some of the old, like 2015 stock of some star
[10:47.700 --> 11:02.100]  dog stuff that, that we go back, you know, a little bit of a ways with. And then we've been doing some, some early, some
[11:02.140 --> 11:12.300]  early, I know this has been a bit of a controversial situation, but, you know, I still love his work and it's Bodie. And I, I
[11:12.300 --> 11:26.380]  understand that there's a lot of hit and miss out there for, for the Bodie fans. And I, you know, I, I don't, I don't ever want to
[11:26.540 --> 11:36.260]  put, you know, I think it's very sad that he went to work with, with a guy like, like, like, like Berner. And, but you know what, we
[11:36.260 --> 11:45.140]  don't know his situation. I know he has a little one who has some pretty serious medical needs. And somebody like myself who, who
[11:45.140 --> 11:55.220]  has to constantly care day in and day out for my own severe medical illness, I'm not going to go ahead and tell somebody that they
[11:55.220 --> 12:03.580]  can't go and do whatever they need to do possible to make that happen. And, and, you know, it's, that's just the way it is. And it
[12:03.580 --> 12:12.020]  doesn't take away from the extraordinary work that he has, you know, previously, I mean, we've acquired some really wonderful
[12:12.020 --> 12:26.420]  strains, the Mother's Milk, Goji-Oji, pretty much every Nepali-Oji, Goji-Oji cross out there. We have, so, in, in spades, because
[12:26.420 --> 12:35.220]  frankly, we, we were really, you know, really keyed up to find some work to cross with a really special cut in our own garden. But
[12:36.220 --> 12:44.740]  that's kind of where our, our, our work has gone at the moment. But tell us, Chad, a little bit about what you got going, man.
[12:45.220 --> 12:53.300]  Chad Moses Well, I've got a few, a few new things coming up here. And, you know, touching on earlier talking about, you know, some of the
[12:53.300 --> 13:02.780]  Afghani strains. And one thing that, you know, I didn't realize initially, you know, you hear Afghani, you think it was, you know,
[13:02.860 --> 13:11.460]  Afghanistan, obviously, there's the association, but there's a lot of regions, all these green regions here are different areas that
[13:11.460 --> 13:20.100]  cannabis has grown. The gray is kind of not mapped out. But these are different regions in Pakistan. And you, you know, you were
[13:20.100 --> 13:30.820]  saying them out the different regions. So as you can imagine, this is a wide swath. I like that word, a wide swath of land. I sound so
[13:30.820 --> 13:43.860]  smart right there. It's a large swath. It's a cornucopia of possibilities. I had to say that like this. But you really do get a lot of
[13:43.860 --> 13:51.380]  different varieties. Now a lot of it is high elevation, a lot of it is cold weather. So it tends to give you a pretty hardy plant where I'm
[13:51.380 --> 14:00.220]  at in the Pacific Northwest, things that can handle cold and a little bit of moisture and finish faster are a plus for me. So those are some
[14:00.220 --> 14:06.820]  interesting things that you might pull out of there. And it kind of, you know, you're talking about your projects there. That's kind of one of
[14:06.820 --> 14:19.620]  the foundations of how I approach work is like, I want to start with something that is older, that doesn't have as complicated genetic
[14:19.660 --> 14:29.300]  background, something that pretty much gives you consistent expressions. I won't lie, it's not going to be the highest THC percentage. And it's
[14:29.300 --> 14:39.740]  probably not going to be, you know, rainbow belts, terpenes. But there's magic in there. And it also allows me and I imagine it allows you
[14:39.740 --> 14:50.060]  and your facility to, to identify what plant is passing on what, because the whole point, well, there's many points to it. But one point of
[14:50.060 --> 15:01.580]  breeding is to isolate particular genetics or traits that you enjoy. And if you just have a big combination of, you know, genetic potential,
[15:02.420 --> 15:12.660]  it's hard to isolate and nail it down, because there's so many combinations. So if at least half of my initial breeding stock is plain Jane, but
[15:12.660 --> 15:25.980]  still solid, yeah, it helps. But it also brings back the hybrid vigor. We see a lot of strains today. They all have similar backgrounds. And I'm
[15:25.980 --> 15:36.660]  going to toss this one out to chat. I have a seedfinder.eu pulled up here on the other screen. I just want to ask you guys what you use for, I
[15:36.660 --> 15:44.700]  don't know, just information about strains. Granted, there isn't one that's going to have the accurate story for everything. But some are better than
[15:44.740 --> 15:53.420]  others. And seedfinder.eu seems to be one of the better ones. And you were talking Stardog earlier. I'm like, that's a top dog, isn't it?
[15:53.460 --> 15:53.860]  Yep.
[15:53.860 --> 15:55.220]  So I punched that in.
[15:55.540 --> 15:56.900]  It sure is. Yep.
[15:57.100 --> 15:58.580]  Pretty, pretty powerful one.
[15:59.140 --> 16:09.260]  It is. And you know, you got a couple different cuts of her that you got the Cory, which is, the Cory Haim cut, which is, you know, it's not as,
[16:10.340 --> 16:23.340]  people say it's not as commercially, it just doesn't eat quite as much as the Bacchus, but I don't care. It's a better, it's just all around, in my
[16:23.340 --> 16:33.660]  opinion, my head growers opinion. And to be honest, you know, we do it, we do a ton of outreach to people. And before we put things on the market, we have
[16:33.660 --> 16:41.940]  people test them. We have lots of people try different strains and just tell us, hey, you know what, can you just give us a rundown of what is this
[16:41.940 --> 16:54.140]  something that you enjoy? Is this something that meets your requirements or not? And then we know kind of out of a group of 30, 40 people, maybe, you know, maybe even
[16:54.140 --> 17:01.620]  more depending on how much, you know, we want to we want to work a project before we kind of think about, okay, are we really putting this out into the public?
[17:01.620 --> 17:14.860]  And so, you know, one of the things that we, you know, that, that we've kind of wanted to start doing is, you know, making sure that people are aware of, of, you
[17:14.860 --> 17:26.380]  know, what sort of, what sort of genetics they really, you know, work best for them. Because I don't want somebody coming in and, and needing to buy something from,
[17:26.380 --> 17:39.940]  you know, I mean, one of the things that we, you know, that, that we've kind of wanted to start doing is actually trying to put together like a sampler box, essentially, of about an
[17:39.980 --> 17:51.580]  eighth of about four or five different strains. It, you know, we obviously, I'm not worried about the, about the cost on it, to be honest. I'm just want to see what people come back to us
[17:51.580 --> 18:03.540]  with, as far as, OK, these two worked for me, these three, or these two definitely did not. And this one, I don't know, I couldn't really tell if it was if it was a good fit for me or not.
[18:03.740 --> 18:17.140]  And then we know how to take that customer, or that, that, that patient or that consumer, we know how to lead them down the right path to what's going to work best for them. And that at the end of the day is all we are about.
[18:17.620 --> 18:29.300]  OK, we don't need to, there's no, there's no other worry in the world other than making sure that somebody who comes to us for help is getting the help they need. Period.
[18:30.580 --> 18:34.780]  And, and everybody's, you know, endocannabinoid system is going to be different.
[18:35.540 --> 18:36.180]  Definitely.
[18:36.220 --> 18:44.020]  And that's why, you know, a lot of times we, or I recommend more or less based off of terpene profiles.
[18:45.620 --> 18:52.140]  I think that's kind of more effective than THC percentage, but there are some strains that help.
[18:52.980 --> 19:02.380]  Yeah, yeah. No, but you're absolutely right. I mean, I could go ahead and put four different strains in front of a person who's telling me that, oh, it's all about the THC.
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.460]  It's all about THC.
[19:03.820 --> 19:14.740]  And I can guarantee you that I will get you, that you will, you will be stoned out of your skull with, with at least one of those strains that is maybe 16% THC.
[19:15.020 --> 19:20.420]  But the wide spectrum cannabinoid profile of that strain is going to knock you out of the park.
[19:20.460 --> 19:23.020]  And that's, that's what the older strains do.
[19:23.500 --> 19:33.660]  That's why, you know, a lot of times when you're going and you're finding strains of today, you've mentioned this about having common lineage of all these different pieces.
[19:33.860 --> 19:36.540]  Well, they've all been parsed up so much now.
[19:36.540 --> 19:50.220]  They're all such a dense plethora of, of different, you know, tree, family trees that honestly you get like a, you get like a 60 minute high from it at the most.
[19:50.220 --> 19:53.180]  And then you're just like, well, wait a second, this is, this is weird.
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.100]  It faded away.
[19:54.740 --> 19:57.340]  And it's like, it's like, that's, that's a problem.
[19:57.380 --> 19:59.460]  That's not, that's not what we're here for.
[19:59.460 --> 20:06.180]  We, we, we want somebody to experience what they need to experience and help them get to where they need to be.
[20:06.180 --> 20:22.020]  And to be honest, that's why some of the, the best work out there, I think right now are the people who are doing the very specific cannabinoid, single cannabinoid work.
[20:22.020 --> 20:30.420]  And that is one of the very best out there that I can recommend to people in our community.
[20:31.180 --> 20:39.580]  And also just an outstanding human being and great guy to work with is, is Seattle Chronic Seeds here.
[20:41.500 --> 20:45.580]  If you go look him up, he has been a friend of mine.
[20:45.700 --> 21:00.620]  Actually, I will say that he is probably one of the first friends who, who I got to know very well a few years ago when I first kind of came on to the, the, the social, I literally knew nothing about social media whatsoever, truly.
[21:01.100 --> 21:05.540]  Except for a LinkedIn profile for like my business, entrepreneurial stuff.
[21:05.580 --> 21:11.060]  And I, you know, I started chatting with him and he was telling me about all the work that he does.
[21:11.660 --> 21:19.060]  And I was sitting there as a patient going, oh my gosh, this is, this is what we need.
[21:19.380 --> 21:20.140]  We need you.
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.500]  Please keep doing the work that you're doing.
[21:22.500 --> 21:23.460]  Oh my goodness.
[21:23.780 --> 21:38.260]  Because the way that he is able to isolate certain cannabinoids and make them very unique in, in these particular strains can be a world of difference for people.
[21:38.260 --> 21:44.900]  And I, I would really highly encourage you to, to learn a little bit about his stuff.
[21:44.940 --> 21:54.580]  Actually here, Chad, a good throwback for you that I, I got off of an auction not too long ago and it was, it was so silly that no one had bid on this.
[21:54.780 --> 21:59.420]  I talked to him the other day about this, that I found a pack of his rhino shit.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.500]  What was what it is?
[22:01.500 --> 22:04.060]  It's a beautiful, it's a purple rhino.
[22:04.500 --> 22:11.140]  Pakistani Citro push across his famous Mac type that he has done for a long time.
[22:11.140 --> 22:16.300]  That's, that's been around for, especially in the Pacific Northwest for a while.
[22:17.140 --> 22:30.060]  And, you know, his stuff is just, he is, he is breaking boundaries on a lot of the, the THC V work that, that people are just starting to get to learn more and more about.
[22:30.780 --> 22:34.380]  The CBG that he does is so impressive.
[22:35.420 --> 22:38.780]  And I just, his pricing is so reasonable too.
[22:38.780 --> 22:51.740]  And I know that's something that we're gonna, we're gonna chat a little bit about here with, but I would really, really recommend him to anybody who's watching who, who really needs something in the, Oh, perfect.
[22:51.740 --> 22:55.020]  He's up on the, on the future cannabis project.
[22:55.660 --> 22:56.460]  That's awesome.
[22:56.620 --> 22:57.340]  Santaga.
[22:57.340 --> 23:01.260]  And it has a, you know, a nice kind of a little bit of background about him.
[23:02.140 --> 23:14.060]  But you mentioned CBG and yeah, that's, you know, something that I dig people going after these, you know, minor cannabinoids because we're not necessarily sure what they do.
[23:15.980 --> 23:19.980]  But I can honestly tell you, I have grown his evasion right there.
[23:20.540 --> 23:29.020]  I've grown the Ginsu and I've grown his I have his a cut of his Verins G as well.
[23:29.900 --> 23:39.100]  And I mean, you would never know that these plants are not absolutely, you know, out of this world spectacular.
[23:39.100 --> 23:45.420]  I mean, you could, you could tell somebody, yep, this is the same THC percentage as you're getting from another strain.
[23:45.420 --> 24:00.300]  And I bet you the, the combined components of the cannabinoid profile of it will give you so many similar feelings to what most people think is THC from the CBG and the THC V that their bodies are just going to go.
[24:00.300 --> 24:00.620]  Wow.
[24:01.500 --> 24:03.420]  This is so relaxing.
[24:03.420 --> 24:05.020]  Holy smokes.
[24:05.020 --> 24:08.060]  And it's like, yup, that's, that's exactly it, man.
[24:08.060 --> 24:10.060]  It's not all THC, my friend.
[24:10.620 --> 24:11.260]  Yes.
[24:11.260 --> 24:14.620]  And Hoku who that was a collaboration with Hoku.
[24:15.180 --> 24:16.940]  They're also on the Daga site.
[24:16.940 --> 24:18.780]  They do their own work as well.
[24:18.780 --> 24:22.220]  Another person who, you know, THC is not their focus.
[24:23.100 --> 24:26.620]  No, it's all these minor cannabinoids and they put some really interesting stuff.
[24:26.620 --> 24:34.860]  And for people who are looking for, you know, medicinal effects and they may find something that works a little bit for them, but not fully all the way.
[24:35.820 --> 24:43.980]  I encourage to play around mixing in some of these minor cannabinoids, you know, with your flower, with your concentrate, you know, make hash out of it.
[24:43.980 --> 24:46.220]  That makes those minor cannabinoids even better.
[24:47.500 --> 24:51.260]  But that's, you know, one thing I like to recommend to people too.
[24:51.260 --> 25:00.300]  And I got, I've got one here from Hillbilly grower herb because I wanted to look for something that is just, you know, really CBD focused.
[25:00.300 --> 25:01.420]  Speaking of focus.
[25:02.860 --> 25:05.500]  Oh God, I'm not good at this.
[25:05.500 --> 25:08.780]  I've done this a million times, but there we go.
[25:09.900 --> 25:13.660]  Jerry wine CBD, you know, it's a 50 to one CBD to THC.
[25:13.900 --> 25:20.700]  I highly doubt this is going to make me very stoned, but I can mix this in with other flower.
[25:21.580 --> 25:24.620]  I can mix this in with other plants if I want to.
[25:25.580 --> 25:30.940]  I was really excited to get these because again, a little bit of variety, man.
[25:30.940 --> 25:34.620]  I mean, I almost think you need to change it up on your endocannabinoid system sometimes.
[25:34.620 --> 25:39.820]  That's why a lot of people, you know, will get tired of strains after like smoking it for three weeks.
[25:39.820 --> 25:41.340]  It just doesn't hit them anymore.
[25:42.220 --> 25:46.700]  And that's actually one thing I look for in keep in deciding to keep something.
[25:46.700 --> 25:51.740]  I'm like, can I smoke it for two months and still not have a tolerance or be tired of it?
[25:51.740 --> 25:52.940]  Absolutely.
[25:52.940 --> 25:54.540]  If so, let's dance.
[25:58.220 --> 26:01.020]  So yeah, that's, that's a very good point, actually.
[26:01.020 --> 26:05.820]  It's because let's be honest when we harvest, you know, that's, that's kind of what we're,
[26:05.820 --> 26:07.260]  we're usually working off of.
[26:07.420 --> 26:12.860]  Unless we have a really extensive reserve, which sometimes, you know, as growers we do.
[26:13.500 --> 26:17.740]  But other times, you know, you're kind of, depending on what projects you've been working on,
[26:17.740 --> 26:21.340]  or if you've maybe not had the time in your own garden or whatever it may be,
[26:22.380 --> 26:26.140]  you're, you know, you're smoking out of those same jars time and time again.
[26:26.140 --> 26:31.980]  And so there are times, and I swear just with the newer hype strains, man, by,
[26:31.980 --> 26:36.940]  by, you know, after smoking them for a week or so, I, I personally,
[26:37.580 --> 26:39.100]  I get, I'm done.
[26:39.100 --> 26:41.340]  I, you know, I've tried with a few of them.
[26:41.340 --> 26:46.140]  I wanted to give a fair shake to certain strains and see what all the hype was about.
[26:46.140 --> 26:53.500]  And I just have unfortunately come up very disappointed in what I found.
[26:53.500 --> 26:55.740]  And so that, that's okay.
[26:55.740 --> 26:57.740]  You know, everyone has their own tastes.
[26:57.740 --> 26:59.740]  So yeah.
[27:00.300 --> 27:01.260]  So, okay.
[27:01.260 --> 27:05.980]  So we, we can think of, you know, like Seattle Chronics doing some work with minor cannabinoids.
[27:05.980 --> 27:11.740]  We got Hoku, H-O-K-U doing work with minor cannabinoids.
[27:11.740 --> 27:14.220]  That pack was from Hillbilly Herb.
[27:16.140 --> 27:20.860]  Are there any other, Dynafem was a, a pretty interesting group.
[27:20.860 --> 27:23.980]  They were in Spain, Amsterdam, that type of thing.
[27:23.980 --> 27:27.180]  They unfortunately got busted, but they were doing some cool stuff,
[27:27.180 --> 27:33.260]  breeding CBD into traditional lines, like a CBD rich OG Kush.
[27:33.260 --> 27:37.020]  I know I had a one-to-one White Widow that I really liked.
[27:37.020 --> 27:37.660]  Oh, there you go.
[27:39.100 --> 27:43.580]  Are there any other, you know, breeders that kind of come to mind as far as
[27:43.580 --> 27:50.940]  people exploring the minor cannabinoids in the, in a, in a THC rich environment, I guess too,
[27:50.940 --> 27:51.980]  because there's a lot of hemp.
[27:51.980 --> 27:55.420]  Hemp is traditionally where we're seeing a lot of these minor cannabinoids,
[27:56.860 --> 28:01.980]  but there aren't a lot of THC rich strains, I guess.
[28:01.980 --> 28:03.660]  I don't want to say rich because it's not 20%.
[28:03.660 --> 28:05.820]  No, no, no.
[28:06.540 --> 28:07.580]  But you know what I mean?
[28:07.580 --> 28:09.340]  Yeah, no, I know where you're coming from.
[28:10.620 --> 28:16.540]  You know, I know that there is that, that group out of, I believe they're out of Colorado.
[28:16.540 --> 28:22.940]  They did, they've won so many different cups and everything else with the, the Alpine glow
[28:24.700 --> 28:25.100]  stuff.
[28:25.180 --> 28:33.580]  It's like, it's something like, like Alpine Valley or, or, oh shoot.
[28:36.060 --> 28:40.380]  They, it's one of those ones I'm going to have to like, like look up.
[28:41.020 --> 28:41.900]  Yeah, no worries.
[28:41.900 --> 28:47.740]  I'm, I'm looking too in the chat here and apparently Rico has an impressive seed collection.
[28:47.740 --> 28:48.380]  We need to see.
[28:49.180 --> 28:49.900]  Ah, okay.
[28:49.900 --> 28:50.620]  Just reading chats.
[28:51.420 --> 28:53.820]  But yeah, you know, I also like to obviously chat.
[28:53.820 --> 28:59.580]  I like to get y'all involved because if you know people who are working with minor cannabinoids
[28:59.580 --> 29:03.820]  as well, holla, let us know so everybody else can know too.
[29:04.940 --> 29:09.100]  Again, you know, the, the show it is, it's about seeds and we've both got stacks of seeds
[29:09.100 --> 29:13.500]  here and we're going to go through some, it's also kind of about educating or well,
[29:14.060 --> 29:22.300]  that sounds fucking pompous, but trying to spread the word, you know, some other things.
[29:22.300 --> 29:27.180]  Yeah, no, I mean, I, I think that, you know, one of the, one of the ones that, that does
[29:27.180 --> 29:37.420]  come to mind for me was professor P has always done the, the, the, a lot of his he worked
[29:37.420 --> 29:42.060]  with, with, let's see, he worked with some, some Ringo's gift.
[29:42.140 --> 29:43.180]  Ringo's gift.
[29:43.180 --> 29:46.540]  He did a whole bunch of stuff with he did.
[29:47.500 --> 29:54.380]  He worked with some Stephen Hawking, Kush, I think at one point he's worked with his,
[29:54.380 --> 30:03.420]  his the, the consumption that he has is a, is a CBD high Alpine genetics.
[30:03.420 --> 30:04.860]  That's exactly what it is.
[30:04.860 --> 30:05.420]  Thank you.
[30:06.220 --> 30:07.900]  Matt Malice Malice.
[30:08.700 --> 30:15.980]  I'm sorry, I'm butchering your name, but that is exactly who they do a marvelous job with
[30:15.980 --> 30:16.540]  their work.
[30:17.180 --> 30:22.860]  And it's, it's still out there and in out in the public for the public eye to, to go
[30:22.860 --> 30:24.460]  ahead and, and, and acquire.
[30:24.460 --> 30:30.540]  And so, yeah, I mean, you know, you could go with something like, like from them, for
[30:30.540 --> 30:40.300]  example you know, professor P with dynasty and dynasty and the other one that he's affiliated
[30:40.300 --> 30:40.460]  with.
[30:43.180 --> 30:47.900]  It'll come to me at some point, my apologies.
[30:49.260 --> 30:56.140]  But I mean, there are, there are enough people who are exploring the combinations of things.
[30:56.140 --> 31:01.500]  I just think that it's, you know, it's really getting down to like, you know, how do we get
[31:01.500 --> 31:07.740]  the, the, the greatest expression of like, for example, THCV is something that for the
[31:07.740 --> 31:11.580]  most part has been bred out of, of cannabis plants period.
[31:12.300 --> 31:18.940]  It's because it's, it's the, the essentially the longer you let those flower.
[31:18.940 --> 31:24.220]  So the only things that really come to mind, unless you've been working them, like, like
[31:24.300 --> 31:29.180]  for example, the, the captain over at Seattle chronic has been working those for generation
[31:29.180 --> 31:31.500]  after generation to fine tune them.
[31:31.500 --> 31:36.860]  The, the closest thing that you're going to get from like a base generation strain is
[31:36.860 --> 31:41.340]  going to be a lot of those like African land race sativas that just take like 18 weeks
[31:41.340 --> 31:41.900]  to flower.
[31:43.020 --> 31:49.820]  And most of us don't have time for that or space or, you know, 50 foot ceilings to put
[31:49.820 --> 31:50.300]  them in.
[31:50.780 --> 31:51.280]  Yeah.
[31:52.140 --> 32:00.140]  I just, just this last month had, had a very nice offer to talk, to test for a breeder
[32:00.140 --> 32:01.260]  who I really enjoy.
[32:01.980 --> 32:03.100]  They've got great work.
[32:04.060 --> 32:05.420]  They actually sent the seeds.
[32:05.420 --> 32:10.220]  I had them in my hands and I asked what the flowering time was and I was like, can't do
[32:10.220 --> 32:10.780]  it.
[32:10.780 --> 32:10.940]  Yeah.
[32:10.940 --> 32:13.420]  So can't, yeah, I can't do it.
[32:13.420 --> 32:15.580]  I'm like, when it grows out, let me know.
[32:15.580 --> 32:19.180]  Cause I'd love to smoke it, but I just couldn't do it.
[32:19.180 --> 32:26.300]  So, you know, that is real and yeah, it's a THCV does tend to be, or at least in my
[32:26.300 --> 32:30.220]  experience, I see a more an equatorial type sativa plants.
[32:30.220 --> 32:30.860]  Yep.
[32:30.860 --> 32:33.980]  That's a, it's very common that that is the case.
[32:34.940 --> 32:39.580]  There are people that are doing some amazing work to bring those times down and everything
[32:39.580 --> 32:39.820]  else.
[32:40.460 --> 32:41.660]  Relic seeds.
[32:41.660 --> 32:42.460]  Absolutely.
[32:42.460 --> 32:42.940]  Thank you.
[32:42.940 --> 32:44.380]  Disbanded Brotherhood.
[32:44.380 --> 32:44.860]  The chat.
[32:44.860 --> 32:47.020]  You guys are knocking it out for us.
[32:47.020 --> 32:48.220]  We really appreciate it.
[32:48.780 --> 32:49.900]  The third window tonight.
[32:51.820 --> 32:56.460]  So, yeah, it's, and that is a hard thing to, you know, it's really, really difficult to
[32:56.460 --> 33:03.580]  be put in a situation where you have to decide, okay, can you make room for a, you know, a
[33:03.580 --> 33:10.860]  10, 12 week or 14 week, you know, flowering time and, and in most circumstances, no.
[33:12.060 --> 33:16.940]  But at the same time, you know, I've had people come up to me who are like, you know, you
[33:16.940 --> 33:23.420]  have a couple really amazing sour diesel cuts that we really love.
[33:23.420 --> 33:26.780]  And we really would love to see more with those.
[33:26.780 --> 33:34.060]  And it's like, okay, I got, you know, those are typically like in that 12, 13 week range
[33:34.060 --> 33:38.060]  with these ones that I'm talking about going back to, you know, the mid nineties.
[33:38.060 --> 33:43.260]  And, you know, there, you have to give them that time.
[33:43.260 --> 33:47.820]  And when, but when somebody comes to me and says, Hey, look, you know, this is really,
[33:47.820 --> 33:49.980]  this is something that's, that's important to me.
[33:49.980 --> 33:53.420]  It's something that I really could use that, that would be special.
[33:54.620 --> 33:58.380]  I'm sure shoot, not going to turn them down or tell them, no, I'm going to figure out
[33:58.380 --> 33:59.020]  how to do it.
[33:59.660 --> 34:04.460]  And so, you know, that's, that's kind of our thing is like, we're not gonna, we're not
[34:04.460 --> 34:06.300]  going to turn anybody down or anything.
[34:06.300 --> 34:11.340]  I mean, unless you are telling me that you need, yeah, I need 18 weeks to put something
[34:11.340 --> 34:11.740]  in there.
[34:11.740 --> 34:13.100]  Then I'm like, oh boy.
[34:13.100 --> 34:13.420]  Okay.
[34:13.420 --> 34:19.340]  I don't know how I can do that, but, but I can stretch it for, for, you know, enough
[34:19.340 --> 34:25.820]  to make, you know, understand the reason why that, that particular, you know, sour diesel
[34:25.820 --> 34:28.300]  is so important when you let that, that finish.
[34:28.300 --> 34:29.340]  Oh my goodness.
[34:29.340 --> 34:32.380]  Is it something special when it comes from a really great cut?
[34:33.820 --> 34:34.220]  Yeah.
[34:34.220 --> 34:38.700]  And, you know, I wish I did have more, more space or just even a commercial facility.
[34:38.700 --> 34:41.340]  Cause I'd absolutely throw a couple, you know, I'd have a room.
[34:41.340 --> 34:47.980]  I'd have a few lights of that going because I, I do, I do like it and I do believe in
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.020]  the power of it.
[34:49.020 --> 34:54.140]  And, you know, I, me, like many other people are kind of part of the reason why we don't
[34:54.140 --> 34:55.660]  see a lot of those anymore.
[34:55.660 --> 35:04.140]  It's just because it's so Amsterdam pays you or used to pay on days of flowering time.
[35:04.700 --> 35:09.820]  So you would actually be incentivized or, you know, you could grow these long strains
[35:09.820 --> 35:14.460]  and it's just worth your while it kind of flipped because it bit people in the ass
[35:14.460 --> 35:17.980]  kind of like, you know, DNA genetics when they were over there, because they've got
[35:17.980 --> 35:22.620]  a lot of like 50, 55 day finishing flowers that are just fire.
[35:23.420 --> 35:27.340]  They couldn't get anything in the, you know, in the coffee shops for it.
[35:27.340 --> 35:33.340]  So that's sometimes why maybe you see nine to 10 weeks when it really finishes early.
[35:33.340 --> 35:34.220]  It's kind of funny.
[35:34.220 --> 35:36.940]  People used to always say it finished earlier than it really did.
[35:36.940 --> 35:39.020]  Now it's kind of like it finishes later.
[35:39.020 --> 35:39.520]  Yes.
[35:40.060 --> 35:43.340]  It actually benefits to leave it a little longer typically.
[35:43.340 --> 35:48.700]  But I mean, you know, the, the, the grow experience to, you know, some guys just know when it's
[35:48.700 --> 35:53.740]  when their time to come down, you know, it's like my head grow will be like, okay, you
[35:53.740 --> 35:58.860]  know what, this is typically, you know, running like 68 to 72 days, but I'm at 58 and I'm
[35:58.860 --> 36:00.220]  ready to take it down.
[36:00.220 --> 36:02.620]  And I'm just like, are you sure?
[36:02.620 --> 36:05.980]  And he's like, have I ever not been sure?
[36:07.180 --> 36:08.380]  I'm like, final answer.
[36:08.380 --> 36:08.700]  No.
[36:08.700 --> 36:09.180]  Okay.
[36:09.180 --> 36:09.740]  I got it.
[36:09.740 --> 36:10.140]  I got it.
[36:10.140 --> 36:11.260]  I'm going to back away now.
[36:12.780 --> 36:17.660]  Well, we've got a couple, a couple of recommendations coming here, Malice again, the Mad Villain,
[36:17.660 --> 36:20.380]  the CBG and THCV content.
[36:22.060 --> 36:23.100]  Let's see here.
[36:23.740 --> 36:24.060]  Whoops.
[36:24.060 --> 36:25.100]  That's the right comment.
[36:26.300 --> 36:26.620]  Nope.
[36:26.620 --> 36:28.300]  Well, oh, things are scrolling me.
[36:28.300 --> 36:28.700]  There we go.
[36:28.700 --> 36:30.700]  DGaZ, Mass Medical.
[36:30.700 --> 36:32.860]  That's, that's another one that I've heard out there.
[36:32.860 --> 36:35.420]  Not, not ultimately familiar, but I've heard that.
[36:35.900 --> 36:39.020]  And another one that came to mind too was Oregon CBD.
[36:39.020 --> 36:44.220]  I can't believe I spaced that one from the top, but Oregon CBD is another breeder.
[36:44.220 --> 36:48.860]  Great place to find CBD obviously, but some other minor cannabinoids too.
[36:48.860 --> 36:49.500]  Absolutely.
[36:50.380 --> 36:55.740]  So, and I see a Sodac Med Grower.
[36:55.740 --> 36:58.140]  I just got some Cuban Missile Crisis seeds.
[36:58.140 --> 36:58.860]  That sounds good.
[36:58.860 --> 37:01.260]  Cuban Black Haze times the EQ Haze.
[37:01.900 --> 37:09.260]  Closest I got to that one is a Cuban Black Haze, which is Northern Lights times Haze
[37:09.260 --> 37:11.500]  times the Pina F4 for Mean Gene.
[37:11.500 --> 37:13.980]  And this is actually, this one is from the ranch.
[37:13.980 --> 37:14.780]  Oh yeah.
[37:14.780 --> 37:15.340]  Yeah.
[37:15.340 --> 37:20.300]  But the, you know, again, it's hard to get the real stories out of all these because there's
[37:20.860 --> 37:22.060]  numerous real stories.
[37:22.700 --> 37:27.900]  But Cuban Black Haze allegedly is the Mysterious Piff.
[37:28.780 --> 37:29.100]  Yeah.
[37:29.660 --> 37:31.500]  So that's the story.
[37:31.500 --> 37:37.580]  So this, I don't expect to be a quick flowering one, but it's still something that I'd like
[37:37.580 --> 37:38.540]  to look through.
[37:38.540 --> 37:39.020]  Yeah.
[37:39.020 --> 37:41.900]  It's going to be a little longer there for you.
[37:43.180 --> 37:49.580]  You know, Skunk Tech went through and did a big project with Cuban Black Haze when they
[37:49.580 --> 38:00.620]  were doing their, his, the gas company thing that they were doing together with the OG
[38:00.620 --> 38:01.180]  family.
[38:02.780 --> 38:07.980]  Anyway, he had done some Cuban Black Haze crosses with a whole bunch of stuff.
[38:07.980 --> 38:11.180]  And they, you know, they have some, they have some real positives to them.
[38:11.820 --> 38:15.180]  But the flowering time is real hard to beat.
[38:15.180 --> 38:15.900]  There you go.
[38:15.900 --> 38:16.940]  Little burgers and beer.
[38:17.100 --> 38:19.420]  You see that one mentioned in chat too.
[38:19.420 --> 38:20.380]  I'm like, KABAM!
[38:25.020 --> 38:25.260]  Yeah.
[38:25.260 --> 38:31.260]  I, you know, it just depends on what your, what your capabilities are, what your type of
[38:31.260 --> 38:37.340]  setup is, you know, what you're willing to work with as far as the genetics go.
[38:37.340 --> 38:40.460]  And, you know, you just, you do what you can with them.
[38:40.780 --> 38:48.460]  And, you know, the, there's some great, great strains that come from, you know, things that
[38:48.460 --> 38:54.060]  are, that are, that are very fast flowering versus stuff that does take a very long time.
[38:54.060 --> 38:59.500]  So it's, you know, there's, there's no right or wrong answer.
[39:00.060 --> 39:00.380]  No.
[39:00.380 --> 39:03.820]  And, and that, you know, that I'm kind of thinking about it, that could also be one of
[39:03.820 --> 39:08.060]  these identifiable traits for anybody who's sitting there and wants to start a project
[39:08.060 --> 39:09.180]  and who wants to breed.
[39:09.180 --> 39:10.540]  They have two things they like.
[39:10.540 --> 39:12.380]  One of them finishes in 50 days.
[39:12.380 --> 39:14.220]  The other finishes in 80.
[39:14.220 --> 39:17.980]  Well, pop your offspring and see where they start to finish.
[39:17.980 --> 39:19.260]  You see where it's leading.
[39:19.260 --> 39:24.380]  That's an easily trackable trait, you know, how long does it take to finish?
[39:25.020 --> 39:25.500]  100%.
[39:26.380 --> 39:27.900]  So you can keep getting back there.
[39:27.900 --> 39:30.620]  And, and, and real quick too, I saw this one pop up.
[39:30.620 --> 39:32.060]  Oh, let me change the banner here.
[39:32.060 --> 39:33.580]  Cause I like it when it's bubbles.
[39:33.580 --> 39:34.940]  It's easier to read the comments.
[39:35.420 --> 39:41.500]  Rico's one of those people always on the charity auctions.
[39:41.500 --> 39:42.140]  Rico.
[39:42.140 --> 39:43.900]  I know who that is now.
[39:43.900 --> 39:49.660]  Not, I know him as Rico, but I've definitely seen you in the auctions and I know you've
[39:49.660 --> 39:51.260]  pissed Dave off a few times.
[39:51.260 --> 39:52.620]  So hats off.
[39:52.620 --> 39:53.740]  That's not easy to do.
[39:57.100 --> 39:58.540]  That's fantastic.
[39:58.540 --> 39:59.100]  Yes.
[39:59.100 --> 40:01.260]  As a fellow battle buddy of Dave's.
[40:02.460 --> 40:03.100]  Yep.
[40:03.100 --> 40:03.900]  Absolutely.
[40:04.940 --> 40:09.660]  But you know, you guys both do, and this is something too that, you know, he, he mentioned,
[40:09.660 --> 40:13.420]  you know, cause I, I, you know, again, I always take hats off today because he gives a lot
[40:13.420 --> 40:18.300]  back but he, you know, he really sung your praises as well, as far as kind of giving
[40:18.300 --> 40:23.420]  back to the community through auctions and you kind of just do this silently.
[40:23.420 --> 40:29.020]  But also now that we're having the conversation medicinally, which is really where I come
[40:29.020 --> 40:33.500]  from, you know, TGA seeds, that's how I was introduced to sub cool.
[40:33.980 --> 40:40.220]  Uh, one of the driving forces behind that, as I understood was they were looking for
[40:40.220 --> 40:43.340]  specific medicinal strains for specific people.
[40:43.340 --> 40:46.700]  And it just happened to be that other people liked them.
[40:46.700 --> 40:49.180]  Other people had similar medicinal effects.
[40:49.820 --> 40:51.180]  And I just thought that was great.
[40:51.180 --> 40:53.980]  You know, I'm like, that's a good mission to have.
[40:53.980 --> 40:58.700]  And that's, you know, again, kind of selfishly, I'm looking for the perfect medicine for myself.
[40:59.260 --> 41:03.500]  Um, but I also know that it's going to translate to other people.
[41:03.500 --> 41:09.100]  And I guess since we're on the medicine tip and, and the generosity, I have mentioned
[41:09.100 --> 41:14.540]  that for my stomach, Bubba Kush and Katsu Kush really, really help.
[41:15.100 --> 41:20.460]  And James had sent me out some very awesome things.
[41:20.460 --> 41:24.940]  So Shrom, Shromba, which is awesome because Shrom is one of my wife's favorites that we
[41:24.940 --> 41:26.460]  haven't seen for years up here.
[41:26.940 --> 41:27.100]  Yeah.
[41:27.100 --> 41:28.540]  That's the P98 Bubba.
[41:28.540 --> 41:30.620]  So very excited.
[41:30.620 --> 41:36.460]  And then also to, you know, Katsu Katsu seeds, again, fantastic breeder.
[41:36.460 --> 41:42.060]  Um, anybody in chat, if you've run any Katsu seeds before, let us know what it was and
[41:42.060 --> 41:46.140]  how you liked it, but I've heard nothing but good things and yeah, Key Lime Kush.
[41:46.140 --> 41:52.300]  So the Key Lime Pie times the P98 Bubba, um, very excited to get these going.
[41:52.300 --> 41:52.540]  Yeah.
[41:53.180 --> 41:58.540]  I remember, I remember you saying that you and your wife, you know, the Shrom was a,
[41:58.540 --> 42:01.180]  was a special, was a special one for you.
[42:01.180 --> 42:06.780]  And, and, uh, you know, that was, that was an early, um, that was an early strain that,
[42:06.780 --> 42:11.100]  you know, that, that was part of the whole Martian Mean Green back in the back, back
[42:11.100 --> 42:15.980]  a long time ago, if you're familiar with the strain, that was, uh, uh, that was a piece
[42:15.980 --> 42:17.740]  that helped to build up Shrom.
[42:17.740 --> 42:23.660]  And, uh, um, it's, uh, um, you know, when I saw that and you, you had mentioned that
[42:23.660 --> 42:30.060]  and you, you know, Bubba Kush is one that, um, is one of the best medicinal strains just
[42:30.060 --> 42:32.140]  in general out there for people.
[42:32.140 --> 42:38.700]  Um, it has a number of different capabilities that, uh, will help with, uh, pain control
[42:38.700 --> 42:42.940]  will help with, um, digestive GI issues.
[42:43.740 --> 42:50.140]  Um, uh, I've had many people, um, who have gone through chemotherapy treatments and radiation,
[42:50.140 --> 42:57.020]  um, tell me that that is, you know, one of the more, um, successful, um, uh, strains
[42:57.020 --> 42:58.140]  for them.
[42:58.140 --> 43:04.700]  Um, I mean, we've gone so far as to make RSO with, um, with the, the, with Bubba before
[43:04.700 --> 43:12.540]  just to try and get that, um, that extra oomph into the, uh, the RSO.
[43:12.540 --> 43:17.500]  Um, but you know, there's, there's different, there's even, you know, there's different
[43:17.500 --> 43:24.700]  parts of the old Bubba Kush too, that, that, uh, um, you know, that, that goes back beyond
[43:24.700 --> 43:31.020]  the, the pre 98 stuff from, from Katsu and goes back even further.
[43:31.020 --> 43:37.740]  So, um, you know, some of those actually give off, I think an even better medicinal,
[43:37.740 --> 43:39.180]  uh, quality to them.
[43:39.180 --> 43:45.980]  The, um, uh, and obviously, you know, these, these historical facts and things get lost
[43:45.980 --> 43:52.700]  in the, you know, everyone has their own thoughts on different things of how these came about.
[43:52.700 --> 44:01.660]  But, um, yeah, this is so shroomy 420 actually was a guy in the, in the forums for a long
[44:01.660 --> 44:02.620]  time.
[44:02.620 --> 44:11.100]  And he, um, he, he grew, not only was he responsible for, for the, um, uh, the, the shroom, but
[44:11.100 --> 44:19.180]  he was also responsible for a absolutely mind blowing original diesel that is just out of
[44:19.180 --> 44:19.980]  this world.
[44:19.980 --> 44:20.220]  Yeah.
[44:20.860 --> 44:21.360]  Wow.
[44:21.920 --> 44:23.360]  So yeah, here's, here's trauma.
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.520]  That's what I was showing you earlier in this, you know, again, the seed finder.edu.
[44:28.240 --> 44:31.360]  I tend to go here to, to track down linear.
[44:31.360 --> 44:34.160]  As do I with a lot of the stuff I, as do I.
[44:34.800 --> 44:35.200]  Yeah.
[44:35.200 --> 44:36.640]  So it's, it's, you know, it's nice.
[44:36.640 --> 44:40.240]  And, you know, again, a lot of these names we recognize and back to your original comments,
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.880]  you know, you've got that base of Northern lights, the Afghanistan Indica, these were
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.120]  the bases for so many strains that we know today.
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.240]  It's almost, you know, like three, three or four generations removed.
[44:54.240 --> 44:59.200]  It kind of almost seems like, uh, you know, in the beginning, everything was like cross
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.400]  with like an Afghanistan or an Afghani or, you know, a skunk.
[45:04.400 --> 45:06.080]  Uh, and then it kind of shifted.
[45:06.080 --> 45:10.240]  Everything got like crossed with like chem chems and cushions.
[45:10.960 --> 45:14.560]  And then the next generation was everything got crossed with cookies.
[45:14.560 --> 45:17.440]  And now after a lotto, everything's getting crossed with.
[45:17.440 --> 45:17.940]  Yep.
[45:18.660 --> 45:24.900]  So it is interesting to see these different building blocks over time, but also illustrates
[45:24.900 --> 45:25.400]  how.
[45:26.740 --> 45:30.900]  Ununique some of the roads that we've gone down are.
[45:32.100 --> 45:32.600]  Yep.
[45:32.980 --> 45:40.020]  A perfect example, honestly, if people wanted to take a look at, um, uh, my, my head grower
[45:40.020 --> 45:45.300]  and I were having this conversation just the other day actually was, um, for those who,
[45:45.300 --> 45:51.940]  who are not familiar, um, there is a fantastic company that is called the Indian land race
[45:51.940 --> 45:52.820]  exchange.
[45:52.820 --> 46:01.060]  Um, on, uh, if you go onto their page on, on Instagram, um, they, they also have a website
[46:01.060 --> 46:07.700]  where they're able to offer their, um, uh, their strains and they're typically, um, labeled
[46:07.700 --> 46:13.380]  under now, I believe almost completely under the full power selections is what it's called.
[46:13.380 --> 46:20.020]  But if you go, if you go and take a look at the photos that were taken from their 2022
[46:20.660 --> 46:29.300]  block, a Stan, um, uh, uh, uh, selections that they chose for this 2022 year, those
[46:30.420 --> 46:39.380]  flowered plants look good enough to be put into a store or a, um, uh, uh, you know, just
[46:39.380 --> 46:40.260]  right away.
[46:40.260 --> 46:42.020]  I pulled up the wrong fucking page.
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.060]  You're a scammer.
[46:43.060 --> 46:43.940]  God damn it.
[46:44.500 --> 46:44.980]  Hate that.
[46:45.940 --> 46:46.660]  Sorry guys.
[46:47.300 --> 46:48.740]  Trying to work on the fly.
[46:48.740 --> 46:49.380]  No, no, no.
[46:49.380 --> 46:50.420]  It's, it's, it's okay.
[46:50.420 --> 46:56.020]  I would recommend though, just if, if somebody just take it, if you go ahead and for those
[46:56.020 --> 47:00.500]  just listening, just take a second on Instagram and go take a look at the pictures from these,
[47:00.500 --> 47:07.060]  because I'm telling you that they are so gorgeous and such beautiful plants.
[47:07.060 --> 47:13.300]  And I can guarantee you, they are going to pack one hell of a punch, um, coming from
[47:13.300 --> 47:14.020]  that region.
[47:14.500 --> 47:21.300]  Um, it's, it is, and those, those plants are as hardy and resistant as they get.
[47:21.300 --> 47:27.220]  And to be honest, if they're coming up that way in an, in, in the generation, the domesticated
[47:27.220 --> 47:31.700]  generation that they are, um, that they're presenting them in.
[47:31.700 --> 47:36.260]  I mean, if that's what you're getting is your final product, holy smokes.
[47:36.260 --> 47:38.580]  I mean, don't, don't worry about anything else.
[47:38.580 --> 47:39.860]  Just go do that.
[47:39.860 --> 47:43.780]  I'm telling you, I mean, the flowering times aren't bad on them either.
[47:43.780 --> 47:47.540]  I mean, there are anywhere between, uh, seven and 10 weeks.
[47:47.540 --> 47:52.500]  I'm pretty sure if I saw correctly, I got on there immediately and pre-ordered from
[47:52.500 --> 47:55.460]  them because I was, I was so impressed with their stuff.
[47:55.460 --> 48:04.100]  And, um, uh, and they are, they are such kind people as well that, um, to be, to be honest,
[48:04.100 --> 48:09.380]  you know, you were, you were so kind to sing, sing my, you know, praises there for a second
[48:09.380 --> 48:12.180]  about, about being generous and whatever else.
[48:12.180 --> 48:20.100]  And, and, you know, to be fair, this is a community of, of really, for the most part,
[48:20.100 --> 48:21.460]  really wonderful people.
[48:22.100 --> 48:28.260]  And it's something where we should all be able to rally together to help one another.
[48:28.260 --> 48:30.980]  There shouldn't be a, even a question about that.
[48:30.980 --> 48:35.540]  When people need help, you, you, you do what you can to help them, whether it's in the
[48:35.540 --> 48:41.540]  way of, of a financial thing or, um, or whatever it may be, you know, helping them to get some
[48:41.540 --> 48:41.940]  flower.
[48:41.940 --> 48:47.380]  They, they just received a bad medical diagnosis, whatever that can be, you know, you try to
[48:47.380 --> 48:48.580]  help them out.
[48:48.580 --> 48:54.180]  Sadly, there are certain people who do take advantage of those situations and it's really
[48:54.180 --> 48:56.900]  sad, um, because it does make people...
[48:56.900 --> 48:57.940]  Don't call them chads.
[48:58.180 --> 49:05.540]  But there are predatory people in this space and it sucks because, you know, a lot of people
[49:05.540 --> 49:08.020]  turn to this plant for hope.
[49:08.580 --> 49:13.140]  And when you're looking for hope, you can easily be taken advantage of because you want
[49:13.140 --> 49:18.180]  to believe, and there are the predators out there, but yeah, there, there are a lot of
[49:18.180 --> 49:19.220]  good people out there too.
[49:19.220 --> 49:24.340]  It's, it's, you hear about the one bad actor for every like a hundred good actors, because
[49:24.660 --> 49:26.740]  good news doesn't make the news.
[49:26.740 --> 49:32.340]  But I think that the cannabis community does a good job of trying to support, or at least
[49:32.340 --> 49:34.580]  shine a spotlight on these people.
[49:34.580 --> 49:41.300]  Um, you know, the, the, we're all, we're all kind of in it together and you can tell who's
[49:41.300 --> 49:41.860]  not.
[49:42.420 --> 49:43.620]  They're still in the industry.
[49:43.620 --> 49:47.780]  They're right next to you at the dab bar, but you can tell who's, who's on a different
[49:47.780 --> 49:48.500]  trajectory.
[49:48.500 --> 49:49.060]  Yup.
[49:49.060 --> 49:49.620]  Yup.
[49:49.620 --> 49:49.860]  Yup.
[49:49.860 --> 49:51.300]  There's, there's the people.
[49:51.700 --> 49:52.100]  Yep.
[49:52.100 --> 49:52.340]  Yep.
[49:52.340 --> 49:52.500]  Yep.
[49:52.500 --> 49:52.740]  Yep.
[49:52.740 --> 49:58.500]  There's, there's the people that, that just have the new Maserati outside versus the people
[49:58.500 --> 50:01.780]  who are sitting there and, and honestly just want to be able to
[50:05.700 --> 50:07.380]  Burn their money, burn their money.
[50:08.660 --> 50:12.580]  And you know, and that's, that's honestly what I say to people when they ask about,
[50:12.580 --> 50:17.460]  you know, wanting to be in this, you know, industry in a legal market or whatever else
[50:17.460 --> 50:19.300]  is, I'm just, I tell people, look.
[50:20.180 --> 50:26.500]  All I care about is being able to take home the same paycheck that I took home from my
[50:26.500 --> 50:29.860]  previous position to support my family.
[50:29.860 --> 50:30.340]  Okay.
[50:30.340 --> 50:33.060]  At the end of the day, that's all that matters.
[50:33.060 --> 50:38.820]  And I'm being, and I'm able to do it with a, with a passionate, with a passion of mine
[50:38.820 --> 50:44.900]  that is so great that I, you know, it doesn't feel like work, but knowing that, that some
[50:44.900 --> 50:51.300]  of this does go and help people and, and, you know, get through some of their really
[50:51.300 --> 50:55.060]  bad days, which, which I have a lot of them because of my own health.
[50:55.620 --> 51:01.300]  I can tell you that it, it honestly gets me emotional sometimes when people come and talk
[51:01.300 --> 51:07.860]  to me or tell me, Hey, you know what, that, that those, those gummies, that strain, whatever
[51:07.860 --> 51:10.740]  it is that, that really saved me, man.
[51:10.740 --> 51:12.260]  Like that did so much for me.
[51:12.260 --> 51:14.020]  I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
[51:14.020 --> 51:15.860]  And you're just like, it's priceless, dude.
[51:16.420 --> 51:20.260]  There is nothing that will ever, that will ever stand in the way of that.
[51:20.260 --> 51:22.580]  I mean, it just, it, wow.
[51:22.580 --> 51:25.860]  Does your heart just swell with joy when you hear that from somebody?
[51:25.860 --> 51:32.740]  So, you know, it's, it's, it's just, it's important to make sure that, that we, you
[51:32.740 --> 51:34.820]  know, are all looking out for one another.
[51:34.820 --> 51:40.020]  And, and honestly, like, you know, the last time I was on this show, I was talking about
[51:40.900 --> 51:46.260]  the fact that I have so much, you know, so many ridiculous amounts of seeds that I honestly
[51:46.260 --> 51:49.060]  need, you know, I've needed people to run certain things.
[51:49.060 --> 51:53.940]  And I've, I've been like, Hey, you know, if you, if you are interested in, you know,
[51:53.940 --> 51:58.180]  maybe, maybe right now is a little bit of a hard time for you and, you know, seeds,
[51:58.180 --> 52:01.140]  you know, maybe you don't have a bunch of them lying around.
[52:01.140 --> 52:06.100]  If you want to run something for me of some kind, you know, I'll be happy to try and help
[52:06.100 --> 52:06.980]  you out that way.
[52:06.980 --> 52:13.140]  The only thing I ask for in return is simply if something comes of it, that's that you
[52:13.140 --> 52:17.540]  find a really special plant, you know, that you go ahead and share a cut of it.
[52:17.540 --> 52:18.660]  That that's with me.
[52:18.660 --> 52:19.540]  That's all.
[52:19.540 --> 52:23.300]  You keep all the flower, you keep all everything else from it.
[52:23.300 --> 52:27.700]  I don't need a thing other than just, if there is something special that comes from it, that
[52:27.700 --> 52:28.740]  we can share together.
[52:29.300 --> 52:32.580]  That's, that's all I, that's all I would ask of somebody.
[52:32.580 --> 52:37.940]  And, and, and honestly, I had a couple of people get in touch with me and, and, and
[52:37.940 --> 52:41.220]  ask, you know, kind of give me the story of what, what's been going on with them.
[52:41.220 --> 52:44.980]  And they have a lot of experience with their, with their growing and breeding.
[52:44.980 --> 52:48.580]  And we're just like, you know, I'm just a bit down on my luck right now.
[52:48.580 --> 52:52.900]  Could I get, would you mind just if I, if you maybe could help me out with that?
[52:52.900 --> 52:58.740]  And I was like, heck yeah, man, this is, this is what I, you know, that's why I don't need
[52:58.740 --> 53:00.500]  all the, the, the fricking seeds.
[53:00.500 --> 53:02.660]  Cause they're just going to sit in the back of a vault.
[53:02.660 --> 53:07.300]  So while I love to help with those charity auctions, I also am like, I don't need any
[53:07.300 --> 53:08.180]  more seeds.
[53:08.180 --> 53:09.060]  Yes.
[53:09.620 --> 53:15.860]  And you know, that is, that is kind of one fun thing about having a decent size seed
[53:15.860 --> 53:20.980]  collection because I, I, you know, I will, I'll talk to people and you know, they'll,
[53:20.980 --> 53:25.140]  they'll have one issue or another and I'll be like, well, I'd like to try to help you.
[53:25.220 --> 53:29.620]  I've got this and it came to mind and they're, you know, they're already growing.
[53:29.620 --> 53:33.060]  So I'm like, would you, how would you feel about trying this and just letting me know?
[53:34.020 --> 53:35.540]  That's, you know, that's huge.
[53:35.540 --> 53:36.500]  And I love to do that.
[53:36.500 --> 53:39.620]  And that is, you know, a great thing about having a good collection.
[53:39.620 --> 53:41.540]  And you know, Mr.
[53:41.540 --> 53:46.020]  Toad is one of those guys who sends out a lot of things for free to veterans, to medical
[53:46.020 --> 53:46.500]  patients.
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.420]  He sent me a whole bag of stuff.
[53:48.420 --> 53:50.740]  Such a top notch gentleman right there.
[53:50.740 --> 53:51.300]  Every time.
[53:51.380 --> 53:51.880]  Yeah.
[53:52.340 --> 53:56.020]  I'm almost starting to get low on his stuff because every time somebody hits me up, I'm
[53:56.020 --> 53:59.380]  always like, I've got this toad strain that would be good for that.
[54:00.100 --> 54:03.700]  I've got a couple of my strains and you know, I'll dig through some of the other stuff as
[54:03.700 --> 54:08.180]  well, but yeah, his, his, his is usually one that always goes out.
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.500]  And again, that's just, you know, kind of paying it forward.
[54:10.500 --> 54:15.460]  We talked about that before is just, you know, I'm never going to be able to pop all of these.
[54:15.460 --> 54:20.820]  I do want to, and there are some that are definitely at the top of the list, but
[54:21.860 --> 54:27.460]  I want to see other people have health and, you know, wealth, I guess, not because they're
[54:27.460 --> 54:32.820]  growing it and selling it, but because they don't have to go buy $80 grams of FICO at
[54:32.820 --> 54:34.100]  the fricking dispensary.
[54:34.100 --> 54:39.460]  Like who can maintain a regimented, you know, medicinal schedule.
[54:39.460 --> 54:41.140]  I don't think many people can.
[54:41.140 --> 54:46.500]  So, well, and to be honest, that's the other issue is right now, the people going to the
[54:46.500 --> 54:51.140]  dispensaries there, for example, you know, we're here in Michigan and Michigan.
[54:51.140 --> 55:00.260]  Is so overloaded with, with crap in the dispensaries that they've had all sorts of, of you know,
[55:00.260 --> 55:03.860]  product coming from other States that got secretly snuck in there.
[55:03.860 --> 55:10.020]  There's a lot of different people looking into certain regulatory problems that have
[55:10.020 --> 55:10.980]  gone on here.
[55:10.980 --> 55:15.780]  And, and, you know, one of the issues is, you know, that, that caused a lot of people
[55:16.100 --> 55:21.300]  after October to shut their doors because they honestly were not managing their business
[55:21.300 --> 55:21.940]  well.
[55:21.940 --> 55:27.860]  And the quality of the flower that was coming out of it was about as good as, you know,
[55:28.980 --> 55:33.700]  like the guy growing for the very first time, you know, and, and, and expecting somebody
[55:33.700 --> 55:42.020]  to pay, you know, 30, $30 a gram or something, or 20, you know, $30 an eighth, you know what
[55:42.020 --> 55:42.900]  I'm like?
[55:42.900 --> 55:44.100]  I'm like, wait a second.
[55:44.100 --> 55:49.060]  You're, you're telling me that you expect a medical patient to walk in here or, or maybe
[55:49.060 --> 55:52.660]  they don't have a med card, but they still use it for, for medicine, or they use it to
[55:52.660 --> 55:56.180]  help them calm down or go to sleep or whatever else.
[55:56.180 --> 55:57.700]  And you expect them to pay for this?
[55:58.420 --> 56:00.900]  As, as my wife would say, do I get a stripper with that?
[56:03.380 --> 56:06.020]  I'm always like, I gotta meet, I gotta meet your wife.
[56:06.020 --> 56:06.340]  Okay.
[56:06.340 --> 56:11.620]  I'm just telling you right now, we're coming out to Oregon to meet, to see you in person.
[56:12.020 --> 56:13.860]  Cause she sounds like an absolute hoot.
[56:14.420 --> 56:14.980]  She's fun.
[56:14.980 --> 56:17.140]  She, she's a fireball, the yin to the yang.
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.020]  But yeah, you know, I wanna, I wanna, you know, shout out real quick.
[56:22.580 --> 56:29.380]  A guy, Hogleg, who, you know, has been listening to the, oh, it's always backwards.
[56:29.380 --> 56:31.700]  It's like driving a damn boat and I am not a captain.
[56:35.060 --> 56:40.100]  Who's listening to the show and hearing me talking about, you know, my, my love of cheese.
[56:40.740 --> 56:43.700]  And so he's like, man, I've got this cross that I've been working on.
[56:43.700 --> 56:48.900]  It's, it's a cheese, kind of a BC pink cush times UK blues, which is also kind of a cheese.
[56:48.900 --> 56:51.620]  He's like, it's cheesy every time.
[56:51.620 --> 56:52.740]  I'd love for you to try them.
[56:52.740 --> 56:53.860]  I'd love for you to have these.
[56:53.860 --> 56:58.420]  So Adam tier, you know, cause I've got, I'm stacking up cheese candidates
[56:58.420 --> 57:00.340]  cause I want to find the cheese.
[57:01.700 --> 57:04.340]  And he's like, dude, pop that in there, throw it in there.
[57:04.820 --> 57:11.060]  And he, and we're going to just ignore the top word there.
[57:11.700 --> 57:15.700]  I don't know how to pronounce that, but this actually looks pretty fire too.
[57:15.700 --> 57:18.980]  And you know what the, the Skittles, the dark, absolutely.
[57:18.980 --> 57:24.740]  And, and Green, Green, does some great, does some great work and they're very nice people.
[57:24.740 --> 57:28.420]  So don't worry about the, the, that horrid word up top there.
[57:28.420 --> 57:33.220]  Just, just focus on the rest of the nice, the nice parts of that, for example.
[57:33.700 --> 57:40.260]  I may have to change my shirt when I, when I plant them, but yeah, they're, they're definitely,
[57:40.260 --> 57:44.260]  they're definitely on the, I want to get to those pretty soon list too.
[57:44.260 --> 57:50.900]  Well, and I must say, I really appreciate as somebody who is a, who comes from a fine
[57:50.900 --> 57:57.380]  wine and spirits background for a profession, the Patroos that, that, that was, that strain
[57:57.380 --> 57:59.060]  is named after right there.
[57:59.060 --> 58:04.900]  I couldn't help, but be, but appreciate that, especially as that is a very, very famous
[58:05.940 --> 58:12.500]  and old outstanding, but also outrageously expensive bottle of Bordeaux from the South
[58:12.500 --> 58:13.060]  of France.
[58:13.060 --> 58:17.780]  So, but, but that looks like an absolute dynamite strain.
[58:18.980 --> 58:25.540]  And, you know, it kind of makes for a perfect segue to one person that one thing that I
[58:25.540 --> 58:33.380]  had brought up to Chad when we, when he asked me to be on the show was everyone, all these
[58:33.380 --> 58:39.460]  seed banks are, are trying to get rid of the stock that they have, because frankly, it's
[58:39.460 --> 58:41.940]  not selling, people can't afford it.
[58:41.940 --> 58:46.660]  And it's just kind of like people, I mean, there's, there's all these outrageous sales
[58:46.660 --> 58:48.500]  and stuff just to get rid of their stuff.
[58:48.500 --> 58:54.740]  And the sad part is the reason they can't get rid of it is because it's bad.
[58:54.740 --> 58:55.380]  Most of it.
[58:55.940 --> 58:59.220]  And that's the, you know, the, the it's, it's untested.
[58:59.220 --> 59:02.580]  It's just, it's not good quality.
[59:02.580 --> 59:09.220]  And so one thing I wanted to be able to bring up to help growers out there is give you guys
[59:09.860 --> 59:15.060]  a good, to grow the sweet heat or the Englewood cookies.
[59:15.060 --> 59:16.500]  FLORINUG This is Florinug.
[59:16.500 --> 59:19.460]  He's on the Daga.site as well.
[59:19.460 --> 59:20.820]  Oh, South Bay Genetics.
[59:21.380 --> 59:25.860]  He grows tremendous looking plants and he uses cookies in, in a lot of them.
[59:25.860 --> 59:31.300]  And we, we, we kind of, well, I'm joking when we go back and forth about giving them crap
[59:31.300 --> 59:34.820]  about it, but no dude, he grows fire and definitely has good genetics.
[59:34.820 --> 59:40.420]  So I saw him pop that up and I'm like, okay, in all fairness, I'm going to mention cookies.
[59:40.420 --> 59:43.620]  This is, this is, you're getting rich this evening.
[59:43.620 --> 59:44.420]  You're getting rich.
[59:44.420 --> 59:45.380]  I am.
[59:45.380 --> 59:46.980]  I'm making bank off this episode.
[59:47.860 --> 59:48.580]  Thanks Berner.
[59:49.140 --> 59:56.740]  But, but really I just want to be able to, to give people a little bit more as far as
[59:56.740 --> 01:00:02.580]  like, you know, being able to find the, the very, and I, and I'm not talking about like,
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.100]  like good bang for your buck.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.940]  I'm honestly talking about some of the very best genetics that I have ever grown.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.940]  And I have been growing for quite a long time.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:19.140]  And I can tell you that, that the other people who, who grow this right along with me are
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:27.220]  people who have been growing since, since Vietnam are, are absolutely astounded by some
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.500]  of this work.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.660]  And, you know, one of them is a dear, dear friend of mine.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:41.700]  And, but his work is, it, it honestly is some of the most impressive breeding I have ever
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.500]  seen.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.020]  And it really is.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.940]  If you go on IG, if you type in Ozark Nation.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.820]  Oh yeah.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.320]  Okay.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:58.180]  He is, his work is, is, is second to none in my book.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:04.260]  I truly think that he's probably potentially one, you know, he's one of the best breeders
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.140]  out there, period.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:11.460]  And right now what he's working on is a, is, and I couldn't help but think of you with
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:17.620]  the, with the cheese is right now he's working with a UK cheese, cherry AK 47.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.380]  Oh, shut up.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:27.140]  That he's crossing into some of the most, some of the most special and unique cuts there
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.020]  are period.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.940]  If you look through the cuts that he has right now.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.900]  There we go.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.420]  He does everything or completely organically.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.660]  And yep, that's exactly.
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:43.860]  So that's, he's crossing in that RC Cola cut right there is one of the rarest cuts
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.900]  you will ever find.
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:49.940]  I have it in my garden and man, it took a long time to get, let me tell you.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:57.620]  And that is his very special grass Valley, Nepali hash plant right there that he is,
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.860]  that he just, it's, it's been a stunner forever.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:06.900]  But one of, one of the things that you, I just love about his work is the fact that
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:12.260]  time and time again, the germination rates are just stunning on them.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:18.980]  They, they are popped and, and, you know, moving within 24 to 48 hours, no question,
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.860]  all, all of them.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.460]  And I, I honestly can't say enough about him.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.580]  I could go on and on.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:32.100]  But really what then it comes down to is the pricing that he gives and all the freebies
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.500]  that he throws in and everything else.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.780]  You know, I, he, I think he honestly sells his packs at like, you know, sometimes you
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.900]  can get them as cheap as like 30, 40 bucks a pack.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:49.300]  And, and these are packs that like, if they had, if they had any, any logo on them, that
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:55.460]  was a, you know, a seed junkie, a lit farms or whatever, whatever you want to call them,
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.380]  they'd be several hundred dollars easily.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.160]  Yeah.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.260]  Yeah.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.340]  And it's, you know, I look at it this way too.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:07.140]  It's like, you know, if you pay $30 for a pack and you get an eighth of good smoke out
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.300]  of it, you got your money back.
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.820]  So I think that's highly possible.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.540]  And you're right.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:18.340]  This is something that, you know, you'd hit me up in the DMs and we were talking about,
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.060]  and I love the idea and now I actually see him in chat.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.660]  This is one person I mentioned earlier.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.500]  Where were you Hillbilly Herb?
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.500]  We're talking about the damn CBDs and the cherry wines.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.460]  And I did get the camera.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.420]  Oh, not focus.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:30.920]  There it is.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.560]  Um, but yeah, no, one thing that you had mentioned that we wanted to highlight is there's a lot of
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.880]  growers out there who don't have, you know, the hundred thousand followers who don't have
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.400]  the flashy packages.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.640]  Um, but they've got just some fire stuff, man.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.240]  There's so much untapped talent out there.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:59.240]  That's why I love the opportunities like these shows to try to just like highlight them or
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.480]  just like raise awareness for them.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:07.240]  And one, one that you raised awareness for, uh, for me and don't bust these out here.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.360]  Uh, uh, absolutely.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.320]  Or these, and I always say kinetic genetics and every time I get corrected, it's four wise eyes
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.040]  or four.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:16.280]  Yeah.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.480]  Well, so his thing is he is no, you're absolutely right.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.160]  His company is kinetic genetics.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.240]  Um, four wise eyes is his, is his name on, uh, um, on Instagram.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:33.560]  Um, and, um, he's, he's been around since the old overgrow, you know, forum days and some of
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.920]  the other forums as well.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.320]  Um, he's a Northern Michigan guy.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.000]  And, um, so, you know, I, I definitely have some love for him and he's a, he's a very good
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.320]  friend.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.520]  He's a good friend of mine.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:54.040]  And, um, he, he, again, is another guy works has bought off and, um, is, is like, like I was
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.280]  mentioning with, with Ozark nation.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.560]  These are both guys that also donate to every charitable thing you can possibly imagine with
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.480]  seeds and with, um, you know, you just tell them where and when to send them and they're there.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:14.680]  And it's because they do care so much and there, but they're also not out here trying to create
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.920]  some sort of ridiculous brand out of it.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:23.480]  They, they do it for the passion and love of, of, of what, of, of what brings what brought
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.240]  them to the table in the first place.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:32.840]  And, um, you know, four wise eyes, you know, has been at it for a long time and he just,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:38.920]  not only is he such a top-notch guy, but he is a, um, his, his work is outstanding.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.000]  That's, you know, and that's cool.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.640]  And again, it's like, you, you've known him, uh, he's been around for a long time.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.040]  This was my first introduction.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.600]  Oh, and, and, you know, it was funny because I, I did get these and I showed these on a
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.800]  couple of previous shows and every time I've had responses in chat, I'm like, oh yeah.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.720]  And cause again, they always correct me on the name and they're like, yep, do it, you know,
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.720]  fire doing great stuff.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.000]  And I used to live in Michigan.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.440]  So just the grand Travers tart cherry sounds interesting.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.480]  Cause I remember going to grand Travers as a kid.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.160]  Uh, and one of the people I'm trying to get it out here, uh, it's stuck.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.400]  Uh, I don't, I guess this doesn't really count for cool seed packs cause there's not in stickers.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.600]  But another guy from Michigan, who's, you know, I think under the radar right now, he does have
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.920]  a couple of packs on, uh, the Daga site.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.480]  Um, he goes, uh, Smiley's angels is the name of the seed company.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:43.560]  Um, but Smiley gardens, who's a lot of people maybe on this channel are familiar with him.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.480]  Um, but I don't think he's, you know, not a seed junkie.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.240]  Uh, no, not, you know, Capulator, but.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.960]  Dude, he's, he's got some fire.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:58.200]  And again, he's, he's a person that, uh, you, you can go and watch his grows.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.880]  Uh, you can go and watch what he does.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.160]  You can watch he's out there trying to help and educate the community as well.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.560]  And like, you know, those are the type of people that get me excited to support them.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.600]  100%.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.160]  And then when you plant them and you get fire, you're like, what's up, new best friend, how
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.120]  you doing bro?
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.600]  Can I send you a t-shirt?
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.280]  You know, that's exactly right.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.320]  And, and, um, you know, there, there are, there are a lot of wonderful people in, in
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:33.480]  Michigan who, um, aren't the gauge greens and the thug pugs and the other, sorry to
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:40.440]  say, but just not in, not a indicative of the, the spirit that is Michigan.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:47.640]  And, um, because there are just so many lovely people here who really do, do care and really
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.840]  do want to see, um, people doing well.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:57.000]  And so, um, you know, when, when I do see somebody like, like, you know, the smiley
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.120]  gardens up there, the, the four wise eyes, I mean, those are, it's, it's always wonderful
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.320]  to see that their, their genetics are making the rounds to, to people like yourself, to
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.360]  people in the chat, to people, you know, you know, making, making waves slowly, but
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.920]  surely, because that means that we're getting more and more of these great genetics into
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.120]  people's hands who might never have come across them otherwise.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:27.160]  And, and, you know, it's, it's common and I've seen some, you know, comments that I've
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.800]  liked about Instagram breeders in the chat.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:37.480]  Um, but it is common to, to kind of see those and I freaking spaced where I was going with
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:37.720]  that.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.440]  It was a really nice sentiment too, damn it.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.560]  I got all excited.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:44.920]  Go team.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.320]  I'll take a penalty toke.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.640]  Yes.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.840]  Penalty toke time.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.360]  But yeah, you know, so supporting people, um, it's cool that we meet in the community
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.120]  because there are, there's a lot of giving people, um, you know, in the chats in sometimes
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.000]  up on the screens.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.040]  And it's fun when you get to see and use those in the garden and you're just like, well,
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.480]  damn, yeah.
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.960]  Didn't spend $500 on that.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.000]  So maybe that was, maybe that was the question I was getting to.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.400]  Yeah.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.280]  Do you have to spend $200 to get fire genetics?
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.000]  Absolutely not.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.480]  No.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.600]  Uh, the best, the best strains, honestly, that I've grown from seed were nowhere near
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.160]  $200.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:35.560]  Um, they are, um, I mean, I can think of a handful of them off the top of my head.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.000]  One of the, one of the breeders that comes to mind, um, that, you know, now he does work
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.040]  for a very large, um, he is the, the head, uh, grower for a very large company called
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:48.680]  Steezy.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:58.120]  Um, but is obsolete, um, is a guy that used to, um, I have his stuff sitting here somewhere.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:58.520]  Yeah.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  Um, who did, um, he has been doing, he's been growing since forever.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:15.560]  And, um, I can tell you that some of the seeds that I have taken from, uh, here of like,
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.640]  um, this, this headband killer, for example.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.720]  Um, uh, but really, you know, a couple of them that, that come to mind are, um, his
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:35.080]  alien tarantula is one that I, uh, the plants that came off of that are hard to even begin
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.120]  to, to, to compete with, to be honest.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.960]  Um, this Irene alien, uh, OG crossed with the Irene Cush.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.680]  I don't know if everyone's familiar with Irene Cush, but, um, it is, uh, it's one of
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.200]  the very best OGs out there in my personal opinion.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:05.160]  Um, uh, but it is a, um, it, to see it in such a pure form out of the seed is, is really
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:05.880]  special.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.200]  And one of the things I really like about him is the fact that, you know, we talk about
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.680]  going on to, um, uh, the, the, um, that wonderful site that, that shows us the lineage and,
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.320]  and, um, of the, of the different genetics that we were talking about that you were just
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.160]  on the EU dot, um, you know what I'm talking about?
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:25.400]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:25.960]  Seed finders.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:26.360]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.000]  Seed finder.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:27.800]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:34.360]  Um, you know, obsolete was one of those guys that never, um, that, that didn't really share
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.800]  his genetics a whole lot.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.280]  Like there'd be a lot of strains that would go by.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.400]  And one of them in particular that I grew out that I can remember, like it was yesterday
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.720]  along with those, with that alien tarantula was a, was a strain called Adam splitter.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.560]  And this Adam splitter was, I've had, I've actually had multiple people say the same
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.760]  thing that it was the greatest strain they ever grew from seed.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:02.760]  And I have no idea what the, um, what the genetics are on it.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:10.840]  Um, it was some of the most overwhelming smoke I've ever had in my entire life.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.760]  And it was outstanding.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.160]  And the plants were just something else.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.320]  I mean, it was, it was, it was gassy.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:25.480]  It was, it was like taking the, the very best of a skunk and crossing it with the very best
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.000]  of a chem and mixing it together and just saying, and just like, boom.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.160]  And that's, yeah, I mean, I'm not, I'm not kidding you when I say that truly.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:45.000]  Um, so there are a number of really wonderful, you know, breeders out there who are not going
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.840]  to charge you an arm and a leg.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:53.320]  Um, another guy who comes to mind for, for those looking for other alternatives, um,
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.880]  is a guy who really could, you know, is, you know, one of the things that we don't often
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.680]  think about is some of, some of these people who are doing the breeding are really reliant
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:07.960]  on this for their, for their wellbeing, or maybe they have some medical issues, um, that
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.760]  are, you know, that they really do rely on their breeding work as a, as a means of their,
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.920]  uh, their, their financials.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:21.640]  And, um, one of the gentlemen that, that I really speak to here is, um, Big Buddy Seeds.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.600]  Um, Big Buddy is a, is a Canadian gentleman.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:33.000]  Um, he, uh, um, he was actually, um, Bodie used his lavender strain, um, for all of the
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.600]  lavender work that he ever used in his various crosses of like Lavender Jack.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.040]  Um, I know the, the, um, the, the, the, the, what was it?
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.000]  The Lavender Aura or something, something along those lines.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.280]  And then there was a, there was a Wookiee cross that was in there as well.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.800]  I mean, he used a whole line of, um, of his lavender in his, in his work.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:02.120]  And, um, you know, he, he now has done some work with a, with a Lemon Larry lavender,
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:08.760]  which is, which is just, um, I, I actually had a friend of mine, or I, I got to know a guy
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.600]  through this show actually, who had gotten in touch with me, said, Hey, you know what?
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.920]  I'd love to grow out something if you, if you know, you have something available.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.360]  And I said, I sure do.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.080]  I have a Garberville purple Cush cross with a Lemon Larry lavender.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.880]  And so he, so he started growing those out and he goes, he, he, he messaged me just the other
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:36.040]  day and goes, I cannot tell you this stuff is some of the loudest I have ever come across in
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.800]  all my years of growing.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.640]  And I was like, see, there you go.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.520]  I mean, I, you know, and, and I think big buddy stuff is somewhere around like the
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.800]  maybe 50 bucks a pack, something like that.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.880]  And it's, it's, you know, and, and, and on top of that, you are helping out somebody who, who,
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.480]  who needs the help.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.720]  And so, you know, he, he is not a, not, he is one of the real good guys out there.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.880]  So, um, I, I really, I really do think that, um, you know, that's the kind of stuff that
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:17.400]  could be really helpful for, um, not only your garden, but also for his, um, uh, you know,
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.000]  living expenses as well.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.040]  So, um, it's, it's a nice mutual deal there.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:22.840]  Yeah.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.680]  And, and we were talking about, you know, you were mentioning the gas earlier and, you know,
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.080]  just some of the, just the strength of some of these profiles.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.560]  And I believe before, when we talked, you're a gas guy, you were kind of like Dave, like
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.920]  gas is your thing.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.800]  So you, you're a connoisseur of gas.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.240]  It's not just like, Oh, it smells like a gas rag.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.200]  You're just like that shit lit my nostril hair on fire, bro.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:44.440]  Yeah.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.760]  That, that, and, and, um, to be honest, you know, the, the, uh, the, you know, we're,
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.560]  we're finding, we're starting to find bits and pieces of some more unique skunks out
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:57.880]  there.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.840]  And, and I'm not going to get into the conversation of, Oh, who found their RKS again?
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.960]  And who did this and that?
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.000]  Because it doesn't matter.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.360]  It just doesn't.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.480]  You know, people get bogged down in these silly conversations because they do.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.920]  And it's just silly.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.960]  But, um, you know, when you're able to find some really Epic, you know, some of the, the,
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:23.160]  as you just talked about burning nose hairs out from, you know, inside out the old super
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.880]  skunk that used to make you just like, Whoa, Oh my gosh.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.800]  That's, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.000]  That this is the kind of stuff that, that, you know, is being asked for more and more
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:46.280]  in our, um, in our community and is something that, um, you know, I know for, for my, my,
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.920]  my team and I, you know, that's something that we're really about is trying to bring
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.080]  all these classic smoke strains back to everybody to be able to enjoy.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.680]  And also for us to be able to let some of the, some of the, uh, seed crosses out that
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.640]  we, that we do.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.920]  Um, we, we're not, you know, we're not trying to, to keep it from anybody else.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:13.800]  You know, it's not a, it's not like a, Oh, well we have this and no one else can have
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.520]  it kind of thing.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.520]  You know, the only, the only thing that, that, you know, a lot of times what people will
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:24.280]  ask if they are kind enough to, uh, share part of something is they're just like, you
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.480]  know what, if you wouldn't mind not, not letting out the pure cut of it, that that's
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.520]  my only ask.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.480]  And, and, and so you always just a absolutely wouldn't dream of it.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.320]  Totally understand where you're coming from.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.000]  Um, but, but you're, but you know, and there'll be like, well, you know, but please go ahead
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.160]  and do, you know, any crosses, whatever you want to do with that, that's up to you.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.240]  And, and, um, so, you know, those are the kinds of things that we, we want to get in
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:57.800]  people's hands again, because I think that's really where, um, we, we had a bit of a golden
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.160]  age in, in marijuana at that point in time.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:07.560]  Um, there was a lot of really special gear that was coming up that, uh, um, you know,
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:14.440]  now is, um, now that we're, we're moving, I think there's been a bit of a, of a crash
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:20.120]  and some of the, the hype strains, I'm hoping people will start to look back a little bit
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.040]  and go, huh, you know what?
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.080]  I remember that, that, you know, one of my, if you really look back and just go to yourself,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:32.360]  you know, what were the great top three smoking experiences of my life, as far as the strains
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.080]  go, you know, and, and think about what those are.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.000]  I bet you a number of those are going to harken back to like a, you know, a time when, you
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.240]  know, say 10 plus years ago when, and, and maybe it was because of the company and everything
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:47.560]  else.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.200]  But, but I, I think a lot of times too, the, the, the, the strain you were smoking had
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:52.920]  a lot to do with it.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.280]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani The, the spicy cannabinoids and, and to, you
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.800]  know, like you're saying a lot of things, you know, the market has dictated where the
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.480]  direction of breeding has gone.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.440]  And a lot of those things were unknown or undesirable.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.160]  So we have lost those.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.360]  So when you go back to some of those, hopefully we can, you know, reintroduce those kind of
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.040]  like I was saying earlier with my goal.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.560]  I go back to that stuff to help reinvigorate, you know, absolutely new generations, more
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:21.960]  vigor.
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:29.800]  You know, it used to be too, and the reliable expression and we, you know, we're kind of
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.680]  talking about price earlier and, you know, hype stuff as well.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:41.800]  And it, you know, it used to be price kind of dictated that it was a worked line, like
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.840]  for a truly like stabilized bread line.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.560]  This is going to take you multiple generations.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.360]  It's going to depending upon how many rooms you can have, it's probably going to take
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.720]  you a couple years.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.640]  Yes, to get something and the market moves way faster than that.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.800]  So it's sad, but there's it, you know, in the market, which isn't our craft people,
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.600]  and it isn't the people seeking medicine because we have that commitment, but in the market,
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.800]  you know, it doesn't pay to be a line breeder anymore.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.360]  And you can, you know, if you're slamming fucking Tom Brady and Giselle bungee together,
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.720]  your kids are going to be cute, like, okay, but they're not stable.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.040]  They're going to be, you know, they're going to be on a freaking rooftop someday.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:31.960]  So that's, that's something that I kind of see a little disconnect with the pricing though,
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.480]  because you're right, you know, there is hype.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:38.280]  There's a lot of stuff that is just, it's not tested or it's not worked.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.960]  It's just hype, but that's what's seemingly getting the higher dollar value these days.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.440]  Yeah.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.000]  Yeah.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:45.560]  What is that?
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.840]  Whose fault is that?
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.080]  I don't know.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.960]  To be honest, the fault, the fault lies with the brand marketing, frankly, is that, that
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.080]  companies went out and bought themselves an army of market of marketers instead of an
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.280]  army of good growers.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.840]  And because the growers will tell you what needs to be done to make sure that they are
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.880]  bringing a line of, of the highest quality to market.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.280]  Whereas a marketer is just sitting there going, well, can I get Mike Tyson in front of it?
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.560]  Yes.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:23.880]  You know, or can I have, you know, some rapper do this or that, or can I have, you know,
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.680]  some athlete or whatever else?
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.920]  It drives me insane to see that kind of stuff.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.560]  It's like, why on earth does that mean that that's a good product?
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.320]  Do you want to be like Mike Tyson?
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.480]  Like, oh my goodness.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.680]  I hope not.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:46.680]  I, you know, so I, you know, I, that's, that's the struggle is, is marketing came in and
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:54.520]  marketing knocked quality work out of, out of the, the, the, the, you know, what's most
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.160]  important.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.360]  It's your fault, Chad.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.520]  I had to put that up.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:58.920]  Damn it.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.080]  Always my fault.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.880]  No, you're right though.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.800]  Um, God, I fucking, I'm earning my money today.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.240]  $2.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.440]  Cookies was the first brand I'm aware of that actually had an active marketing campaign.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.200]  It worked.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:16.600]  Yep.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.000]  Worked.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.120]  It's a lifestyle.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.560]  It's a household name.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.080]  They did everything right.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.280]  They're fucking owning the space right now.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.560]  The space is a little fricking short bus.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.160]  Sorry, short buses.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:33.240]  But, uh, it is, you know, that's where the money's coming from right now.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:39.160]  And it's, it's, it's weird because I kind of missed the, uh, legacy market days where
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:45.400]  really quality is what drove things, you know, not marketing because you couldn't talk about
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:45.560]  it.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.160]  You couldn't post your pictures.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160]  It was like, no, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.120]  It's like that dude's whack, yo, I'm going over here.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:52.440]  Right.
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.600]  So yeah, I, I kind of missed that aspect to it.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:05.720]  And I hope the, you know, the, this commercial market, once it opens up and people like,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:12.360]  you know, us are allowed to thrive and flourish and not compete on scale with these MSOs.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.280]  Cause they're always going to be there, but you know, it's like quality again, back to
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.120]  traditional days, quality speaks.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:18.360]  Sure.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:23.240]  You could go buy it over there for a little bit cheaper, but you want to come over here
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.000]  because it's better.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.400]  That's, that's exactly the, the, what you try to instill in your, your consumers, in
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.600]  your patients, whatever it is, is look, you know what, go over there and try that stuff
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.240]  versus this.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.080]  And tell me, tell, come back to me tomorrow and tell me what you think, because I'm going
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:47.320]  to tell you that, that, uh, unless, you know, a nine, you know, 99 out of a hundred times,
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.560]  I I'm going to almost guarantee you that you're going to be coming back to me going, wow.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:51.880]  Okay.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.360]  You know what?
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:58.120]  I don't mind paying a reasonable price for what you're offering here in comparison.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:04.520]  And it's just, um, you know, right now the market is going through so much turmoil that,
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:12.280]  um, it, it really is, you know, the, the, the market kind of needs what, what, you know,
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:19.000]  you think of in, um, farming and forestry terms as a controlled burn right now, literally
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.880]  it needs to clear out all of these people.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:26.760]  And it's actually happening is it needs to clear out all of these, these people who got
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.080]  into this industry and said, I'm going to get rich quick.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:35.000]  And now that they're at this like year and a half, two year mark the market for, for
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.640]  the, the, you know, a pound of, of weed in the, in the, um, the, the legal market is,
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.560]  you know, absolutely tanked.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:48.840]  They're sitting there with a massive tax bill, uh, that they can't pay to the IRS.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.800]  They have a huge balloon payment on their loans.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.200]  Um, and, uh, they're, they're destitute and they can't continue.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.880]  Um, so I apologize for, for, for finance, for bringing up financials on here.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.040]  And we're not, we're not the financial times.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.320]  I, I wrote a wall street journal, but exactly, exactly.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:15.480]  But, um, it is, there is actually, I think a lot of hope on the horizon for what you
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.920]  were just talking about with, with legacy coming back around and, um, the, the, the
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.600]  data out there suggests that.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.000]  So I, I'm, I'm really hopeful that we will see the same thing.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.760]  I'm right along there with you, Chad.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.920]  I, I, I want that to be the case for all of us to be able to enjoy and have a piece of,
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.640]  of this wonderful community together, not sitting here cutthroat, you know, trying to,
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:47.720]  to, um, fight big companies over, you know, over the little guy, so to speak.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.280]  Yeah.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.840]  You're never gonna win on volume.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.160]  That's just get that out of your head.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:58.040]  So it goes back to having, you know, a good quality product, knowing how to do it, you
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:04.280]  know, almost again, going back to the traditional market where you monocrop a room because it's
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.240]  so specific.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.680]  And if you really dial things in, you can bring out the, that last like 2% of expression
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:15.800]  on certain things, but also to the bigger picture to kind of tie everything together,
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.880]  where we started with this point is supporting these small, you know, craft for lack of a
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.840]  better word breeders, people who are just putting in that work that you probably haven't
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:30.680]  heard of, but you find through a show where you find through a community, hopefully you
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.160]  learn of people here and you try their gear.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.560]  Yeah.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:40.440]  And then you would like it and you tell everybody, but again, to traditional market, um, why
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.280]  do you think cuts were held so closely?
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:48.040]  Because you had something special and in the future when it hopefully does open up and
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:53.240]  there's a lot of wonderful growers out there, you're going to need something special to
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.360]  draw people in.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:00.040]  And where better to find that from one of these, you know, smaller growers that are
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:09.000]  still charging 40, $50 a pack, which is absolutely reasonable in my eyes compared to some $200,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.800]  $500 and actually be leaf cannabis.
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:18.280]  Um, you know, he was on a show with Brian and Marco and myself before, and he was kind
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.120]  of talking about how he got into it.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.960]  I got his stuff here, um, you know, showed him on the other shows, the one that I ran,
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.600]  uh, before and everybody's seen my, my pictures of is that, is that Kool-Aid man.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.200]  Um, but he was, you know, it was interesting.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.800]  He was talking and I'll just put up some Kool-Aid man pictures here that I grew.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.000]  Very nice.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:39.560]  Yeah.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.480]  Just like the frost was insane.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.080]  Beautiful.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:43.480]  On it.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.680]  It's got such a unique taste and profile.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.600]  And that's actually what I'm smoking right now.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.720]  It's just, it's like, it's all I want to smoke that my Westport grape juice are like the
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.480]  only two jars getting touched lately.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.120]  Beautiful.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.400]  Um, but, but one thing he said that I really kind of like, he's like, so what I did is,
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.560]  you know, in the beginning it's like, I wanted to start.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:09.800]  So I did my research, I found, you know, who I considered like the top five breeders.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.320]  And then I went and got their gear and then I found the best of their gear that I liked.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:20.520]  And then that was my starting point, you know, he worked it into, into some other things.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.240]  So there is something to be said for, you know, like fire packs or some of these, you
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.960]  know, more expensive ones, if it's able to bring something that you want, but that's
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:38.200]  because these people have put in the work to make it that way and to pass on those reliable.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:39.560]  Trace.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.120]  Yep.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:45.160]  So that's, you know, again, price, I don't mind paying someone who's worked something
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.320]  for years because they've missed out on the market and they're just really in love with
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:49.960]  this plant.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.560]  And so hopefully it's going to be special.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.640]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:29:00.360]  And, and another, another shout out name that I can give you that I'm sure a lot of you
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:07.160]  have seen the name in in various seed banks, but I'm telling you, please don't buy the
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:13.720]  gear from the seed bank, go to him directly because you will get a, I mean, his, his packs
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.520]  in seed banks are two, $300 a piece.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:22.280]  But if you go to him directly, the deal that he will give you on, on all your stuff is
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.680]  absolutely outrageously insane.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.800]  And it's fantastic.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:31.640]  Is snow high seeds is, has been around for a long time.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.760]  Another, another very good friend of mine.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:43.720]  And you know, somebody who has dedicated his whole life through a lot of, of, you know,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:50.040]  medical turmoil and other things having to try and overcome and is still, you know, has
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:57.160]  some of the most exclusive and unique genetics out there, period, no questions asked.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:05.240]  And he does such a sweet combination of what is like, you wouldn't call it hype necessarily
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:12.120]  in today's market, but it is more in the, you know, of, of a hype style.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:18.920]  And then on the other side of things, he has, you know you know, four different types of,
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:25.160]  of Panama red and, you know, he has, you know, Acapulco gold going back to the sixties.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.560]  He has, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.600]  And I, I have been running his gear for a long time.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.320]  I absolutely love it, love him.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:41.160]  And you know, working with him via email is, is the best way to do his gear.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:48.520]  And you will pay a tiny fraction of what you would if you went into a seed bank to get it.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:57.240]  So my recommendation is as a little, little hack here is to go, you know, find him on, on Instagram,
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:04.360]  go and email him and get the lowdown of what his, his menu looks like.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:11.320]  And from there, you know, there are so, so many good genetics on that list that I,
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:18.440]  it kind of blows my mind when I look at it and I'm just like, man, I, I, I'll take one of everything.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.360]  You know, you're like, I just, this is, this is insane.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.280]  I don't know what else to say about it, but.
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.280]  Where do I stop slapping your hand?
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.120]  Enter, enter.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.880]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:35.080]  So yeah, another, another outstanding breeder out there who doesn't get nearly the credit he deserves.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.680]  Doesn't ask for the credit, you know, either.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.920]  And that's the thing with all of these gentlemen that we brought up this evening is
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.560]  they don't ask for credit for any of this.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.320]  They, they just do what they do because they absolutely love it.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.440]  Do it, do it.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.720]  What, what else, what else would we ask for from our, from our,
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:59.400]  from, you know, the, these, these excellent growers breeders in this community.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.360]  Yeah.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.560]  And then it's cool.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:07.720]  You know, I, I think anybody on the human level, you know, unless you like kick kittens,
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:16.200]  gets like a real genuine, like sense of pride from that email or that DM of like, Hey,
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  this helped me or, Hey, that was a really good piece of information.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.520]  Like, absolutely.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.800]  That's why a lot of people do this.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.040]  Yes.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.040]  And you're looking at two of them.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:28.840]  Yes.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:29.720]  Yeah.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.720]  Those, those little things go a long way.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:35.000]  So that, that's all the motivation you need sometimes.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.600]  Cause the internet can be pretty fricking wicked if it wants to be.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:38.920]  Yeah.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:44.440]  So for someone to go out of their way and take their time to, to, to say something nice helps.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:48.440]  And so I tried to, you know, I tried to make an effort to do that myself too, just because it's,
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.880]  you know not good karma.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:56.360]  I mean, I do it even if it never came back, but it's just, I don't know the right thing to do,
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.320]  I guess, you know, show support if you appreciate somebody.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:06.200]  And, and so for showing support, we, we kind of talked about, it's great that we're mentioning
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.520]  some breeders now that people can look into.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.560]  I also mentioned, you know, you know, your friends in chat or, you know,
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.880]  following somebody on YouTube, that's Miley's garden.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:21.960]  Are there any other ways that you've used and you just kind of touched on Instagram,
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:26.760]  but any other ways that you've used to help maybe discover some of these people or
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.440]  any serendipitous experiences where you're just like, Hey, that, that worked out nice.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:38.840]  I will be honest that a lot of it really, for me comes with, with just trying to build
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.200]  relationships with people.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:47.320]  I come from a, a legal then, then entrepreneurial background.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:54.520]  And so when you're an entrepreneur to, to be successful at that sort of level,
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.480]  you really have to, to be kind of the go getter person and really try to,
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.920]  to establish connections and network with people.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:10.040]  And it's, you know, it's all about being actually genuinely interested because
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.440]  you're both in the same space and you both are passionate about the space.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.720]  As long as you find those people who are going to, to show you that same sort of,
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:23.960]  you know, as, as I like to kind of call it, like we're nerding out on this stuff together.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.560]  You know, when you're able to find that common ground, there's, there's,
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.400]  I mean, there, there's so much that can be, that can be carried forward from that.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.640]  I mean that's how I had gotten to know pretty much everyone I have mentioned this evening
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.920]  was through literally kind of doing a cold call with somebody and just like,
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.880]  Hey, you know what? I think you do some amazing work.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:51.960]  I, you know, I really love the stuff you got going on right now, you know, is,
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:57.800]  you know, and at the time when I was looking for genetics, I'd be like, you know, I don't know if
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.760]  you, you know, do any, I see maybe that you do some breeding work. I didn't know, but
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.960]  it just seems like top stuff. And I, I'd love to be able to try some of it myself.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:13.240]  And you know, sometimes you, you won't get somebody getting back to you or, or maybe a
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.880]  long time from then, whatever, but you know, now a lot of people are also moving over to the
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:28.200]  discord servers as well. So that's another great place to because it kind of files
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:35.800]  things down very neatly into like, okay, top dog has one bloom has one
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:42.120]  many places to be, you know, it's, it's a lot of different stuff that you can, you can check out
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:51.480]  and, and, and kind of find like, you know, unique passions within those. And it's, it's another way
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.480]  of kind of being able to find some nice relationships. I know that I've, I've been able to
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:04.600]  to kind of craft and, and cultivate, if you'll excuse the pun here,
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:14.200]  relationships with, with people through discord as well. So I really just, I would emphasize to
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:20.280]  people to not be afraid to just get out there and, and put yourself out there with people.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:24.920]  And, you know, and when you see something that looks really special, just, you know, give somebody
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:30.600]  a shout, you know, no one's gonna, no one's going to, to backhand you for giving them a compliment
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.400]  about something. I mean, no one's gonna go, oh, well, you know, you're a jerk, you know, blah,
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.320]  blah, blah. Like, I mean, you know, that's not gonna happen. So like, if they don't get back to
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.960]  you, no big deal. Like you just move on to, you know, maybe you, you, you don't see something else
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.000]  you like down the road from somebody else, or heck, maybe in a month down the road, he does
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.840]  get back to you, or she gets back to you. And they're like, yeah, you know, thanks so much.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:58.040]  I really appreciate the love. I, you know, I was just off of my social media for a while or
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:04.440]  something. And, you know, maybe that spawns a great, great relationship too. So, you know, it's,
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.520]  it's never, it's never a perfect, like, you know, there's, there's no perfect formula, but, you know,
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.280]  the forum stuff isn't really alive as much as obviously it used to be, you know, that was the,
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.520]  the place to be on the overgrow and stuff like that. I know they're still around, but
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:24.520]  it's not around to the same extent. My space is still around too.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:33.560]  Yeah. I mean, that's true. That's true. So yeah, I mean, you know, that used to be the place to be.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:40.520]  I mean, that was, that was where the, the most of it was kicking off to be honest, but you know,
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:45.720]  these, these other outlets aren't, aren't bad either. And, and there really are a lot of,
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.200]  a lot of, you know, as we started this show there's a lot of really good people in the
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:55.960]  community who really do care and just want to share their passions with others.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:03.080]  That's, that's so awesome that you mentioned it. That's how a lot of probably my best relationships
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.400]  have come to. And I didn't even think about it because it's something that just happens naturally.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.560]  You know, it's like me and Dave have a passion for seeds. We love talking about it. He says,
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:19.480]  Hey, let's bring James in. I could talk to you for all day, any day by ourselves, any time.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.200]  Absolutely.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.520]  Cause we have that passion. It's just like you said, we kind of get to nerd out on it.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.400]  Yes.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.880]  That is a, you know, a bright side of the internet and connecting, like you said, you know,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.440]  reach out, just, you know, don't be like, yo dog, let me run your shit. Just be like,
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.440]  come on, man. Be, you know, be a little more tactful than that, but you'd be surprised at
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.160]  the amount of people that are able to get back to you. And some people may not even run the
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.880]  account. Some people may not ever open the DMS because it's a black hole for them. So don't get
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:55.480]  personally offended and then go out and like slander people, but you'll be surprised. And
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:03.240]  that's how I've booked a lot of guests of just like, you know, you dream you want, and you know,
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:07.960]  the entrepreneurs like, well, it's never going to happen if I sit on my thumb. So I'm just going to
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.680]  send an email.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.440]  Absolutely right.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.360]  Holy shit. They called me back. Yeah. Okay. And, and, you know, for testing, you know,
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.200]  that happens with a lot of testing. People will always need testers, but you gotta be, you know,
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.360]  good, not necessarily a good grower, but good at documenting it good at being able to communicate
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:34.760]  it. One thing we're working on like right now is actually I did just get some testers. We're doing
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:41.560]  a little FCP test group for these. Yeah. From Myers Creek cannabis.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:44.520]  Oh, beautiful. They do some good stuff.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:51.080]  I'm stoked here. It's called Lemon Degreaser. So I have high hopes for it, but you know,
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.560]  Peter just kind of said, Hey, we need to put together a test group.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:56.920]  Nice.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:02.680]  Okay. Let me, you know, call a couple of people. And these are all people who I've, you know,
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:07.720]  I've known and I respect and I've seen them. I've seen their grows and I think it would be
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:13.720]  interesting. You know, I've got one person who does DWC. I got another person who is fully living
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:19.640]  soil. I've got another person who's like an award-winning grower. I'm in it too. So it's,
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.320]  it'll be a good group, but people who make seeds always need testers. They're invaluable.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:31.160]  And I've used a lot this summer for the Nakatomi Plaza. And I probably actually,
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:37.400]  I did, I gave away more seeds of that, that I'm going to sell, but I don't care. It's okay. I'm a
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:44.680]  little overcautious in that sense. But yeah, you know, if, if people are working on things and
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:51.240]  people who do many numerous strains per year, they always need testers. So long way of saying,
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.480]  don't be afraid to reach out and just see what happens and then be prepared to follow through
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:01.640]  on your commitment. Because I'll say like one thing, I've got a video actually pulled up from
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:11.960]  this person Trippy who I think he was, he was just asking me for the Westport grape juice for a long
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:17.160]  time. And I'm just like, ah, you know, no, I don't have it. Don't have it. Don't have it. And then
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.600]  I had the Nakatomi Plaza and I hit him up and sent him out and he's growing them right now. And he
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:28.840]  sends me awesome pictures and he sends videos and I'm like, this person's a tester for life.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:33.000]  You find a good tester as a creator. And you're like, I'm always happy to give these persons seeds
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.520]  because I know what they're going to do. So a hundred percent, that's another tip. If you do
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:43.080]  get in, do a good job. Cause you'll probably be like tester for life in that sense.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.360]  Yeah, no, that's, that's absolutely true. And, and it's, you know, it's always nice when you can,
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.400]  people just really appreciate when you can dedicate that extra time to getting them,
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:01.240]  you know, showing them, you know, weekly updates on the plants and stuff like that. And, and being
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:07.320]  able to, to keep notes and, you know, being able to document certain aspects and certain traits
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:13.400]  that you're seeing. So I, you know, it is one of those things where when you're, when you look to
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:19.720]  becoming a tester, if you're working with somebody who's like a pretty well-known brand or something,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:28.440]  I would recommend that like, it's not necessarily something for the beginner per se, but don't be,
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:33.480]  don't be afraid to just, just try anyway, though, because, you know, there may be some guys who
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.640]  actually are like, you know what, I could really use people of all different grow abilities and
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:44.520]  skill. But, but don't, don't also get down on yourself. For example, like if somebody is just
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:49.080]  like, well, no, I'm, man, you like don't have enough experience and this is only for like
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:57.320]  super experienced growers and, you know, that's my, yeah, that's my, that's my rad, you know,
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:08.440]  joke voice there of the goofy overinflated ego guy. And, you're going to get those too. And,
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:12.920]  and that's okay. There's, there's, you know, you just, you just shrug them off and it's like,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:20.040]  whatever, you know, there's always another person. So, you know, don't be afraid by that, but,
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:29.240]  you know, it's just important to, to always be trying with people and, and just, you know,
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:35.880]  putting yourself out there and giving it a shot, because, I mean, you can't, you know, you can't,
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:41.960]  what's the, how does that saying go? You can't, you can't miss it or you can't make a shot that
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:48.680]  you never took or something like that. And that's, that's exactly the, the, the point is that you
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:55.880]  can't. So yeah, I was just thinking, you know, to kind of like, you know, and you know, with ending
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:02.360]  things, we got to, I feel like we've, we've short ended the guys with, with the not as many
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.840]  show and tell pieces here. So I was trying to pull out.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.720]  I was just, I was just looking around. I'm like, we've been having a great conversation. I need to,
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:18.040]  I should probably show some seeds, but it's all been about how to find them and how to find people.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.880]  Cause that's equally important. You know, like, like I showed earlier, you know, hog leg,
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:28.440]  you know, I've, I've not seen his stuff, you know, on, you know, seeds here now, but
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:35.240]  he reached out with something that I talked about that I'm looking for and he's really likes it.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.520]  And it's like, dude, this will hit the ticket. So, you know, I would have loved to found a new
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:45.320]  person just through this show that I could be like, well, Hey, I've got this. Why don't you try
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.560]  this? And you know, we can, you just go back and forth. And then sometimes, you know, you even get
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.200]  males and you start collaborations that way and then you go back and forth and it's fun.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.400]  Absolutely. I mean, so I got some, some, some stuff going back to a little bog here,
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:09.960]  little bog bubble got let's see, we got a few packs of the bog bubble. We got, we got,
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:18.760]  got two of those. And then, okay, there we go. Yeah. And then we got,
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.680]  let's see, three packs of sour bubble.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.600]  And so those now have you, have you grown out much of bogs gear or have you grown out either
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:40.520]  of those specifically? So I have, yes, I have grown out. Excuse me. I have grown out both of
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:48.840]  those. And it's been a long time since I have though. They were, that was probably, gosh,
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:58.840]  number of years ago that I had had other packs of, of his gear when he was still alive. And they are,
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:04.360]  one of the great things about his gear is that it really was super fast finishing. Like I'm talking
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:11.880]  about like 50 days worth of, you know, like, like, like just boom, done. And they, they,
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:18.200]  they are, yeah. And somebody just mentioned lifesaver. I got a lifesaver right here as well.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:29.240]  Yes. And, and a blue cush is the other, the other one on there. They are, both of those are
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:37.160]  outstanding strains. The bog bubble is a, is a big you get a lot of bubble gum traits off of that.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:46.680]  I mean, big time bubble gum flavor or like morphology. Both. If you've ever grown some of
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:52.200]  like the original Indiana bubble gum, for example, it's it's very reminiscent of it. They're very
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:47:01.960]  they're it's a, it's a, it's a very stout plant. It's, it's, it, they can go different ways
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:07.400]  sometimes with, with the bog bubble though, you know, it was always kind of like a, it just
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:14.600]  reminded me of like a really solid kind of Christmas tree style. It was not a super big plant.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:20.200]  It wasn't like, it wasn't yielding a ton, but it was yielding enough where like you got a couple
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:25.640]  solid jars out of it. I mean, at least I would say I was getting, you know, off the old, you know,
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:33.000]  HPS lights and everything probably, you know, still, I mean, probably like, like four ounces
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.200]  off a plant, three ounces off a plant. That's fine for a head stash. Yeah. I mean, exactly. And that's
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:47.080]  what it was for. So I have never grown the blue cush and I have never grown the lifesaver.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:52.200]  The other thing that I did grow of his though, that I just, I've always been absolutely in love
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:59.160]  with. And another guy who was took it, you know, to another level was a dead pan head. If, if any of
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:06.840]  you are familiar with his work, check him out. It's he does some absolutely amazing stuff. Also a
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:13.640]  Michigan guy. I don't know if he's based in Michigan anymore, but he was from the Michigan area
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:24.040]  and what is the LSD that they did? LSD is one of the greatest, highest experiences I can ever tell
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:30.600]  you. It is outstanding. And so, yeah, that's, that's a cool older collection of stuff that,
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:38.440]  you know, isn't really out there for, for all to see anymore. And so, you know, thought it was a
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:44.440]  fun one to share. Indeed. Yeah. Bog passed away, I believe a couple of years ago.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:53.000]  A lot of the seeds did go up on auction sites after that. Now, was there somebody,
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:59.080]  cause we've actually lost a lot, well, a decent amount of breeders over these last couple of
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:06.360]  years, but was there somebody, was it family related that is still reproducing the lines
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:12.200]  or is this somebody else that I'm thinking of? From what I understand, his son did some, like,
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:19.080]  did a drop with one of the seed banks or something like that. I don't know the,
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:26.840]  I didn't follow up with it. Cause I, you know, I'm always suspect with kind of some of that,
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.240]  that kind of stuff. Like, I don't know exactly where that comes from. I don't want to,
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.360]  it always makes me wonder, like, especially if you're going to hunt them together,
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:42.200]  I would feel weird hunting something that you're telling me is coming from several years down the
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:48.440]  road compared to this stuff, which is, I want to say, I have it written on the back of,
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:58.920]  of this one here. This was, this was 2014 for the, for the bog, for the, the, the sour bubble. So,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.040]  so I mean, it's, it's, it's been I mean, so I wouldn't want to put that with something that
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:10.200]  like is, you know, being released in 2022 or 2021. Like that's just, those are probably vastly
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:16.760]  different in, in a number of ways. So I, I always kind of steer clear with that. I, you know, and so
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:23.480]  I don't know, I think he was trying to do some reproductions, but I, I'm not sure the whole story
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:30.280]  there. Yeah. And, and we've seen this, you know, many times with many different breeders where
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:36.520]  the original parental stock is loss, but they still have seeds. So then they pop that and then
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:41.880]  they make the cross and then they call it the same thing, which technically by name it is,
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.840]  but we all know, dude, it's so hard once, once you lose the perfect plant, even if you have more
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:55.720]  the perfect plant, even if you have more seeds of it, you're never just like you get 99% of the
[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:03.880]  way to that plant, but you never get fully, fully get it. Cloning kids, clone your plants.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.960]  Yeah. You know what? And tissue cultures are becoming more and more of a really,
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:17.560]  really useful line. I know that that's something that, that we are very much working towards doing
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:23.240]  for all of these wonderful cuts that we've been able to acquire over time to make sure that they
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:31.080]  will be able to be, you know, passed down for other generations to, to utilize. I, you know,
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.840]  I, I love it if somebody was to be able to take some of this stock and put it towards, you know,
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:42.200]  whatever down the road, I think it'd be just magical if, if we could help to continue to
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:50.120]  further the, the experience for others to be able to have, you know, like one of my all-time
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:56.920]  favorite strains that I have in my, in our mom collection, for example, is the original Federation
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:05.080]  Romulan. So the original, original Romulan, not, not the, not the Romulan Joe Romulan, the original
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:15.720]  straight from Federation Romulan. And that plant is, I mean, when I say knock you on your ass and
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:25.320]  completely out, I mean it like it is. And so to be able to make sure that that stock is still there
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:31.880]  for people, cause I, cause it's not, it's very locked up very, very tightly. And I don't know,
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:36.680]  you know, who else would ever really be able to get their hands on it too much. And I would love
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:42.600]  though, if it was something that, you know, somebody could use down the road, if, if I was no longer
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:48.360]  here or something to be able to use it, then I would love it. And that's why we use it in crosses
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:54.200]  and other things is I can't let it, I can't let it out in a pure form. That's a promise that I made
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:53:00.840]  to the person, but I absolutely want to make sure that people get a chance to, to try it and, and
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:06.840]  to actually get, you know, a sense of like, wow, this stuff is amazing, you know? And this was
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:12.760]  something that was, that was devised, you know, it's amazing to think that like the late eighties
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:19.000]  becoming almost 40 years ago. I do that every time, like a fucking album anniversary is like,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:25.560]  it's been 30 years since Nevermind came out. I'm like, really? I do it with all the Zeppelin and
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:31.640]  Hendrix albums and stuff too. I'm a huge album collector. So I'm right there with you. It drives
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:37.800]  me nuts. And I'm not that old. And that's what's, that's what's even worse is like, I, I'm only,
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:44.280]  I'm only, you know, in my early thirties. So I, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm mid forties and I cry every
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:50.200]  time I see it's like three men and a baby came out 25 years ago today. It's like, ah, I saw that in
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:54:02.760]  the theater. So yeah. Oh, come on, man. But yeah, it, it, it happens. I'm glad that there has been
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:08.040]  over and you know, bring it back to Bodhi. Bodhi is one of these people who helped start maybe,
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:15.480]  or is part of the preservation conversation. Because we were going really quickly in one
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:20.360]  direction. And there were some people out there who consciously pulled the brakes and said,
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:26.760]  you know what, I'm going to go for old ugly stuff because I want to work it. And we're,
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.920]  yeah, it's, it's just fortunate. I see someone, you know, or disbanded brotherhood mentioning
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:39.480]  Island Sweet Skunk. That's, you know, and you mentioned Al Capoco Gold earlier, and I had Jorge
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:44.440]  Cervantes as a guest, another one of those just emails I sent and I was like, holy shit, he
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:52.040]  answered. But we were talking about Al Capoco Gold and I, and I say this, it's like, I've smoked
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:58.680]  it. I've been handed it, but I'm not convinced I've ever actually smoked Al Capoco Gold. And he
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:04.040]  was like, yeah, because it's, it's not pure. It's, it's not what it was in the sixties and the
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:10.440]  seventies. So you haven't, but I'm sure you've smoked it. You know? Yeah. It's a very, it's a
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:17.560]  very good point. And you know, the, the stuff that goes back to like, I have some of some of
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:24.520]  Bodhi's earliest, the, the, the first, the second release that he ever did only to family and
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:34.280]  friends when he took, when he took Breeder Steve's Sweet Skunk and crossed it with, shoot, what did
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:34.760]  he call it?
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:35.320]  Is it the God Bud?
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:44.600]  It was, it was something real early. I got it. I got it in here that I can pull it out and show,
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:55.480]  show some old world goodness here. Oh, is that funny or what? Here's the LSD that I was talking
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:55.720]  about.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.280]  Nice.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:06.760]  Yeah. I have it in here somewhere. I have all this stuff. Like it's all, it's all kind of put
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:15.800]  together in a, in by like, this is all my preservation Bodhi work sitting in one area here
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:23.000]  versus, you know, some sitting in some of the other areas. Chad, why don't you go ahead and
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.240]  do one while I'm, I'm searching away here.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.720]  Cool. All right. Well, I'll toss up the, the, this is what I was talking about earlier.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:37.080]  The Nakatomi Plaza, that'll be coming out. It should have gotten to Peter today. So I need to,
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:44.280]  to write up the description and send it over to, to him. But I was mentioning, you know, the tester
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.840]  Trippy who's been doing something for me. And just the other day, you know, he posted a little
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:57.560]  Instagram short on his page of flowering out some of the Nakatomi Plaza. And I was like,
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.360]  well, hell yeah, dude, you know, he just throws up little things. I think these were about,
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.760]  you know, day 30 and you know, there's goes in and he gets to show some good trichome coverage,
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:13.320]  but you know, like he's done a great job with the plants. They look happy and healthy. They're,
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:19.800]  you know, trained very well for multiple colas. So, you know, again, it's, it's just the little
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.680]  things like this. If you do manage to, to, you know, become a tester for somebody or get the
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:30.360]  opportunity, do little things like this. And I tell you what, this guy is going to have whatever
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:36.520]  I make for life pretty much. Cause you know, it gives me cool shit. Cause there's no way we could
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:41.480]  do all this ourselves. And there was a lot of people this summer who tested it outdoors. I
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:48.760]  can't grow outdoors where I am. So that's a big issue. That's huge for me. I love that, you know,
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:54.040]  and, and, you know, sometimes things indoors that were bred indoors and they go outdoors or bred
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  outdoors and then come indoors, they, they don't handle the, the, the stress the same.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:07.480]  No, they do not. Absolutely right. And that, that does tend to, you know, it, it, it tends to throw
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:14.600]  everything off and then you're kind of left, you know, with the, you know, without, without a paddle
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:19.480]  going up, going, going against the rapids a little bit like, Oh, this is not going to work very well.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.120]  Yeah. Yeah. So that was, that was a little bit of the Nakatomi Plaza.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:29.080]  We'll give the shameless plug to myself there. Hey man, I love, I also love the
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:40.920]  the, the, the graphics on the front of it. I'm not scared about being shameless. So thank you.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:46.120]  Yes, I definitely, I had to go with it and I had to make sure that it dropped in December
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:51.080]  and I did actually, and he was growing two of the Hans Gruber's there. I had,
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.840]  there were two in the front and then the Nakatomi plazas were the two in the back
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.000]  in that video. And I was going to release that too, but one of the testers,
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.400]  they just found something that they really liked and they said, how many you got?
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.480]  What do you want for them? So that sold out before it became a release.
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:16.200]  Not complaining. Yeah. So did you, did you find what you were looking for there?
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:25.720]  I did. Yeah. So, so this is the, so this was what was called little, little blessings is actually
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:37.720]  what it was, what it was called. And it is a, it is a, it is a sweet skunk, it pretty much a heavy
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:47.160]  sweet skunk leaner. And then it is a, where did it go? The, the,
[01:59:53.150 --> 01:59:57.390]  so I, oh, that's right. You were looking at the Island sweet skunk or the sweet skunk that got
[01:59:57.390 --> 02:00:01.790]  crossed with breeder Steve's. Oh, with a, with breeder. So it's breeder Steve's sweet skunk
[02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:09.230]  crossed with talk of Kabul. So the old, old Afghan, so basically like the old Afghanica,
[02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:18.830]  if you're, if you're familiar, the talk of Kabul is a much less known it's not as widely talked
[02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:25.230]  about as a lot of the other regional stuff is like, for example, like the Jalalabad star and
[02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:32.590]  some of those other land race heirloom work. But this was his, one of his first like shots at using
[02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:40.030]  a combination of, you know, a, a, a sweet skunk with, with the talk of Kabul. So, so you're,
[02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:45.950]  you're, you're getting a lot of, probably a lot of the sweet skunk in there. And it's, I mean,
[02:00:46.590 --> 02:00:54.670]  I was very, very curious when I came across it and this was, you know, this was a long time ago
[02:00:54.670 --> 02:01:04.110]  and I have not popped it, but I probably at some point in time will, because why the heck not?
[02:01:05.630 --> 02:01:10.430]  To be totally honest, when you look at how much Bodhi that is in here, I mean, it's just like,
[02:01:11.070 --> 02:01:16.590]  dude, it's, it's not, let me, let me, let me big screen that again. So they don't see me drooling,
[02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:23.630]  but yeah, I mean, so these are all the snow Lotus crosses that I have of all sorts of stuff.
[02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:29.790]  The snow Lotus was there, was there anything in particular that stuck out about snow Lotus?
[02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:37.950]  Well, snow Lotus was, I mean, the, the, my favorite stuff from snow Lotus is, or from the,
[02:01:37.950 --> 02:01:48.670]  the snow Lotus work was like his, his snow leopard was really good. I mean, he, he had the,
[02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:56.350]  I have a snow Lotus back cross in here as well. He did two versions of that, which were both,
[02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:06.270]  I mean, pretty on point. We're both really, really excellent. And then I'm trying to think
[02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:13.470]  what were some, he did a, he did a, he did an, an Apolli with it as well. I know that. And then,
[02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:24.110]  and then here is the Appalachia crosses that I have of his stuff. So like just a lot of like the,
[02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:31.470]  I was always a big Appalachia fan of, of, of his work. And then you got just like some of the rare
[02:02:32.670 --> 02:02:41.710]  stuff that came from Mrs. Bodie, for example, over the years. And then some mother's milk work as
[02:02:41.710 --> 02:02:52.270]  well. And last but not least, certainly not least is my Nepali Goji crosses. So a whole bunch of
[02:02:53.150 --> 02:02:59.150]  some of the very best of, you know, having a handful of Goji, Oji packs and mother's milk and
[02:03:00.110 --> 02:03:06.910]  all that kind of good stuff. So, you know, I, I, I will always love and appreciate
[02:03:07.710 --> 02:03:11.950]  the, the Goji, the Bodie work, man. That's for sure.
[02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:16.670]  Yeah. I was, I was going to say the Goji, Oji and I was actually, I have a cross in it and I was
[02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:23.470]  going to grab the, the box that it came in down and my Boof Life star, my Boof Life fell, fell
[02:03:23.470 --> 02:03:34.110]  down on me. Shout out to DP, Boof Life. So for, for free thinkers conversation, it was a Goji, Oji
[02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:45.070]  times Duke Diamonds, local skunk, number 16 or number 17, something like that. But yeah, that
[02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:49.790]  was a one that he had sent me and I, I threw a couple in the soil, but they both came up males
[02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:56.510]  and like, damn, okay. But I obviously have more to work, but limited times where you're just trying
[02:03:56.510 --> 02:04:02.110]  to quickly go through things to get a taste for it. You just couldn't give me one female, come on.
[02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:09.630]  But yeah, no, I'm definitely going back to that. He sent me some other really rad crosses too
[02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:11.790]  that I want to get to.
[02:04:11.790 --> 02:04:16.190]  Yeah. I mean, you know what, that and the, and then just, just having a lot of like the
[02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:24.430]  preservation work and stuff like that of just so many, so many different strains, portable spaceship,
[02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:31.070]  God's paintbrush, all of like, like a handful of packs of like the metal haze preservation that he
[02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:38.750]  did. You know, stuff like that where I will definitely make sure that it's run at some point
[02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:45.150]  in time, whether it's with some help from some, someone or with my group and team doing it or
[02:04:45.150 --> 02:04:50.990]  whatever, whatever else, like I just, you know, this is, this is exactly what you just mentioned.
[02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:57.230]  This was somebody putting the parking brake on, on, on the, the, the way that things were
[02:04:57.790 --> 02:05:02.750]  winding forward way too fast. And was, you know, them saying, Hey, look, let's,
[02:05:03.710 --> 02:05:10.910]  let's make sure that we, we give, give, you know, we give due deference to the, to the, these,
[02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:14.990]  you know, amazing strains that deserve our attention and love for sure.
[02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:24.990]  Yeah. Because kind of how I understand it is, you know, Bodie didn't necessarily earn his good
[02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:31.630]  following or his good reputation because he sat there and he, you know, meticulously worked lines.
[02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:38.670]  He got his following and because he would go out to these places and he would bring back these,
[02:05:38.670 --> 02:05:43.550]  you know, land race type of things that we haven't seen and haven't introduced. So when you
[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:48.350]  get your hands on them and you put them into, you know, other things, you really see some new
[02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:54.430]  expression. So that's, that's the preservation part. Again, it's not necessarily that they're
[02:05:54.430 --> 02:06:01.710]  all wort. It's, it's stuff that you don't have. Exactly. And, and, you know, for people who want
[02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:08.990]  to hear a perfect example of that is, you know, Bob Hemphill and, and Hannah Bolt doing the
[02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:15.070]  crickets and cicada, they, they came out with a preservation of the Pakistani Peshawar not too long
[02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:22.350]  ago. And that was, they, they got, they got Bodie's blessing to do that because that was a strain
[02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:28.190]  that, that I actually, I have some of the original work from Bodie of, of that preservation that he
[02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:35.630]  did, but he went, he actually went there to, to bring, to return home with those seeds. And,
[02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:41.470]  you know, that's where they did originally come from. So, you know, somebody who, who has given
[02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:48.510]  that much time and effort to, to their craft is, is something to be, to be honored regardless of,
[02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:55.630]  of, you know, other motives or other things going on. I don't see seed junkie doing that, sorry. So,
[02:06:56.830 --> 02:07:01.630]  you know, it's, it's something where I think that's, that's really nice. And
[02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:08.590]  yeah, Johnny, that, that sounds like a, a fire, you know, some firework, man. The underdog is,
[02:07:08.590 --> 02:07:15.950]  is, is outstanding. That's up your, that's up gasoline alley for you, right? Yeah. That's some
[02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:21.790]  really, really good stuff right there. And, and yeah, that should, that should turn out lovely.
[02:07:22.350 --> 02:07:27.790]  That's, that's that perfect skunk gas combo right there to burn the nose hairs.
[02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:33.710]  Here's, here's a tough question. I actually see Disbanded Brotherhood tossing,
[02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:41.630]  tossing us one in the chat says, what, what are y'all's most coveted packs you have in your
[02:07:41.630 --> 02:07:52.030]  collection? That's a tough one to answer right now, but is there anything that immediately
[02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:58.430]  jumps to the top of your list? For me? Yeah. Oh, I'm not taking the whole responsibility on that
[02:07:58.430 --> 02:08:08.110]  one. Come on now. Yeah. So I actually, because I shared, I, I shared them with the last time I was
[02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:16.670]  on. I don't think I brought them up to my wife's office this time around, but I do have original
[02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:26.590]  stock of the very original Super Silver Haze, Neville's Haze, Neville's Skunk. The birthplace
[02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:36.110]  of Scentsy Seeds. Exactly. They actually all, they come in the, the, the little straw wrappers
[02:08:36.110 --> 02:08:44.590]  that are burnt on either end. And I actually, it was, it was Shanti Baba who actually confirmed it
[02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:50.110]  for me. He's like, he's like, he's like, Oh, just don't, don't let those go. Don't ever let those
[02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:54.030]  go. He's like, he's like, those are the real thing. And I was like, I was like, wait a second,
[02:08:54.030 --> 02:09:00.750]  really? And he's like, yes, they really are. Don't let them go. So yeah, the original Super Silver
[02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:12.670]  Haze, the original Angel, the, what was one of them? It was an, it was an Afghani, a Northern
[02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:20.510]  Lights Afghani cross that was done. And there, there are one or two more, Critical Skunk was
[02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:28.990]  one of them. So the old Critical Plus crossed with that same Skunk. And yeah, so, I mean,
[02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:33.070]  those are, those are like something that could go in a museum, you know, like they're, they're
[02:09:33.070 --> 02:09:40.430]  like something that, you know, is the original Nevels and stuff like that. So that stock is,
[02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:50.430]  is, is, you know, it's pretty priceless to have and, and pretty special. So yeah, you know, that,
[02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:56.510]  that's some stuff that, you know, definitely like to run in a, in probably a tissue culture
[02:09:56.510 --> 02:10:01.070]  environment, knowing how old they are and everything else. But, you know, I'd love to
[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:05.790]  see what, what could come of them at some point and maybe something, you know, really, really
[02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:12.830]  special. You know, who knows? Yeah, that's, that's really cool. I've only ever seen that one other
[02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:19.950]  time before. And it's a person who's, who's usually in chat, but the American one who has the,
[02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:26.270]  the biggest like memorabilia collection of anybody I know. And you know, he's all like me.
[02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:32.190]  So it dates back a while, but that guy's got so many just like magazines and like,
[02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:36.030]  all like business cards, the, you know, that, that type of packaging,
[02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:43.310]  I've got like original super sativa club stuff. Yes. Yes. Yep. I swear he came on one of the
[02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:47.870]  episodes. Cause I was like, damn, you got to show off the collection. But that was the only
[02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:55.070]  other time that I've ever seen one of those originals before still in the, the straw.
[02:10:55.790 --> 02:11:02.510]  So, yeah, you know, I'm, I'm juggling back and forth with my answer right now because,
[02:11:03.390 --> 02:11:08.750]  you know, initially, and I kind of already showed these, but the two, you know, the katsu's from
[02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:16.750]  Bubba, because again, if, you know, if I find something that works for my stomach and my
[02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:21.070]  conditions, that's, that's fucking priceless, dude. That's what, that's what it's been about
[02:11:21.070 --> 02:11:29.230]  this whole time. So that, but I also wanted to, Oh yeah. Where, where are they? Where are they?
[02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:36.750]  I got seeds everywhere. Oh, these, which, which I kind of showed last episode with me and Jean
[02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:42.110]  all really fun. Yeah. It was really fun because I kind of got to pick his brain a little bit
[02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:50.670]  about open pollination and just ways to go about it. Cause I am back from a trip to Mexico
[02:11:51.230 --> 02:11:59.390]  and weed is easy to score in Mexico and most of the weed will have seeds. So absolutely this is
[02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:05.950]  one. And then this was another that was just called Kush, but these might be up there as far
[02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:13.550]  as my most coveted things right now, just because of what I experienced from this and what I think
[02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:22.430]  the potential is. So, yeah. So, so I guess right now today it's kind of a toss up between completely
[02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:27.950]  unknown, but I do, I honestly think the skunks in here guys, there you go.
[02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:38.270]  Leprechauns. But also, also these, because again, you know, I'm, I'm, I use the plant medicinally
[02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:44.030]  and that's, that's what I'm looking for. And once I find that I'm going to just share it with
[02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:50.830]  everybody I can because yeah, cannabis is an amazing thing. It really is. It really is, man.
[02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:56.110]  Those are, no, those are both, those are both great. I love, I love the, how, how different they
[02:12:56.110 --> 02:13:01.870]  are, but at the same time, the potential is there with both of them. There's so much potential and
[02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:07.070]  that's what's, that's, what's so cool about seeds in general is that there is so much potential to
[02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:14.430]  be had with, with this kind of stuff, you know, and, and you know, I, I have a number of those
[02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:19.230]  strains that you're talking about that were just put on business cards and were like, and it's,
[02:13:19.230 --> 02:13:24.750]  they're literally written out like on there, you know, of what, of like in, in marker or pen of
[02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:28.590]  what, what the strain was. And it's just a- This is my label.
[02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:33.310]  Yeah. That's, that's exactly it. You know, I mean, it was just like written over there or like
[02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:40.270]  yeah, I mean, just a lot of that kind of stuff, but you know, honestly, the, the stuff that I,
[02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:45.070]  I covet, you know, or the stuff that I'm most excited about is just when we're able to,
[02:13:45.070 --> 02:13:50.270]  to create, or when, when we're putting projects together that we really look at and go,
[02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:57.950]  this, this has some serious potential to be, to be really helpful for a lot of people, like truly.
[02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:58.510]  Yeah.
[02:13:58.670 --> 02:14:03.310]  And so let's get to work and bust our ass on it. Like, like that's, that's really where it comes
[02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:08.190]  from is, is that like, okay, fine. Let's stay a couple extra hours and make sure that everything's
[02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:11.070]  done and let's, you know, do, do whatever you have to do.
[02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:17.070]  Label the clones right. And yeah, you know, Mean Genes, you know, advice was, he's like, well,
[02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:23.790]  you know, you could just open pollinate it and then just, you know, mix the seeds and start
[02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:31.150]  hunting from there. And, or you can open pollinate individually, label all of the females,
[02:14:31.150 --> 02:14:35.790]  keep those seeds separate, run those separately, because then you're going to know exactly what's
[02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:42.350]  passing where versus the homogenized, oh, maybe I don't know what female this seed was from and
[02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:49.790]  that, and that. So a lot of work up front, but it's going to save me probably years in the
[02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:55.870]  end, because again, I don't have a huge warehouse where I can have 20 rooms doing multiple cycles.
[02:14:55.870 --> 02:15:03.230]  So I'm going to put in a lot of work up front to save time later. So yeah, this, and you know,
[02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:07.630]  again, this is, this is kind of one of those passion projects. It's not necessarily market
[02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:12.510]  driven. It's something where I just want to go in and try to find something cool and then
[02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:15.710]  isolate it. And that'll be, that'll be my Mexican experience.
[02:15:15.710 --> 02:15:19.470]  That's all that matters, man. It's all that matters. It doesn't, nothing else is,
[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:23.870]  you know, you're, you're driven by passion. That's all that counts. And that's all that
[02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:29.070]  counts for, for all of us in here, you and I talking plus anyone in the chat, it's the same
[02:15:29.070 --> 02:15:33.950]  way. It's just, you know, that, that passion is, is what keeps us going, man. And it keeps us,
[02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:38.270]  keeps us searching for, for the next thing or for whatever, whatever works.
[02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:41.470]  Yeah. I think Raymond just freaking summarized it.
[02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:50.510]  Well said. Yeah. We're gonna see, we're about two hours and 15 minutes right now. You want to go
[02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:57.230]  another 15 minutes or you're stretching way later into the night than I am.
[02:15:57.230 --> 02:16:00.830]  Oh, that's all right. 15 minutes is, is, is at this point.
[02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:06.910]  Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:16:07.230 --> 02:16:07.310]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.470]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.870]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:20.710]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,
[02:16:20.710 --> 02:16:24.210]  That's why I had to look at the clock,
[02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:28.190]  cause I know we could do this for another four or five hours
[02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:29.830]  and still not be tired.
[02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:32.310]  But yeah, we're still sitting here just chatting.
[02:16:32.310 --> 02:16:34.770]  I wanna be respectful, respectful of everybody's time.
[02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:38.390]  So yeah, but okay, so let's see here.
[02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:39.490]  Let's see, what do we got?
[02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:44.190]  So breeders that people might not have heard from,
[02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:45.870]  we've already pulled some things out.
[02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:49.510]  You know, we had the kind genetics.
[02:16:49.510 --> 02:16:52.270]  I pulled out some Smiley's Angels.
[02:16:54.510 --> 02:16:58.590]  We've got, you know, the hog leg that came into me here.
[02:16:58.590 --> 02:17:00.750]  You had mentioned a few breeders.
[02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:05.750]  We're talking about minor cannabinoids, CBD, THC, CBG.
[02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:07.870]  We had Seattle chronic seeds.
[02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:11.330]  We had Hoku, Oregon CBD.
[02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:14.790]  Who else am I missing here that we covered on this?
[02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:19.790]  We had SRP on there from Relic and from Dynasty.
[02:17:21.430 --> 02:17:26.190]  And yeah, I mean, I think that was it
[02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:28.890]  for the isolated cannabinoids.
[02:17:28.890 --> 02:17:31.910]  But then, you know, we got into, you know,
[02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:34.390]  just talking about overall quality of work.
[02:17:34.390 --> 02:17:38.270]  And that really comes down to, you know,
[02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:40.750]  go check out Ozark Nation.
[02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:43.030]  Would be my first bet for you.
[02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:47.570]  Then, you know, I would say Big Buddy does great stuff.
[02:17:47.570 --> 02:17:49.750]  You know, Snow High has been around forever
[02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:51.470]  and it's just a, I mean,
[02:17:51.470 --> 02:17:54.150]  you just get the best of both worlds with him.
[02:17:56.670 --> 02:17:57.610]  Let's see.
[02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:00.750]  So, oh, one more here that I had mentioned earlier.
[02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:02.790]  The hillbilly herb grower.
[02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:06.070]  That's the cherry wine CBD 50 to one.
[02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:08.670]  Not gonna get you stoned, but I like the potential.
[02:18:08.670 --> 02:18:10.470]  So stoked to have that.
[02:18:10.510 --> 02:18:14.030]  So yeah, I mean, you know,
[02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:16.830]  one thing that was really kind was
[02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:21.030]  I was supposed to be at an event a few,
[02:18:21.030 --> 02:18:23.310]  about like, I don't know, five, six weeks ago
[02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:25.330]  up in Northern Michigan.
[02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.450]  And unfortunately my health didn't leave me in a place
[02:18:27.450 --> 02:18:29.670]  where I could make the trip up there.
[02:18:29.670 --> 02:18:33.790]  And one of the main guy who was organizing it
[02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:36.230]  is a good friend of mine.
[02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:40.030]  And if you go look him up on Instagram,
[02:18:40.550 --> 02:18:43.270]  his handle is the chronic connoisseur.
[02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:47.230]  And he put on an amazing event for people.
[02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:51.230]  It was basically a salute
[02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:56.710]  for all of these small breeders throughout Michigan.
[02:18:56.710 --> 02:19:00.070]  It was basically, you know,
[02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:05.070]  giving them all the props that they are due, frankly.
[02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:08.770]  And so it was a big kind of get together.
[02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:12.570]  And he just put on a really awesome,
[02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:14.570]  he organized I think a lot of it
[02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:15.810]  and put on an amazing thing.
[02:19:15.810 --> 02:19:18.990]  And I had bought a VIP ticket for it.
[02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:20.530]  And I had just told him, I said,
[02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:22.530]  I said, man, honestly, just give me,
[02:19:22.530 --> 02:19:25.250]  just give my stuff away to whoever,
[02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:27.130]  you know, let a buddy in
[02:19:27.130 --> 02:19:29.690]  and just give whatever the packs are
[02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:32.490]  and whatever to a friend or to somebody,
[02:19:32.490 --> 02:19:34.370]  you know, there who, you know,
[02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:36.090]  seems like they're, you know,
[02:19:36.090 --> 02:19:38.530]  would be really excited by the gear and whatever else.
[02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:41.290]  It's okay, don't worry about sending it down.
[02:19:41.290 --> 02:19:44.010]  And I already paid for it.
[02:19:44.010 --> 02:19:46.130]  So it's no big deal one way or another.
[02:19:46.130 --> 02:19:51.130]  And instead he sent me all of this, you know, great stuff.
[02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:53.730]  But one guy who does do a great job
[02:19:53.730 --> 02:19:58.730]  is Blue Star out of Michigan here.
[02:19:59.130 --> 02:20:04.130]  And he, one of his main strains
[02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:08.610]  that he did for a long time was called Navy Cross.
[02:20:08.610 --> 02:20:11.730]  And it was a really, really outstanding.
[02:20:11.730 --> 02:20:14.290]  I can't think of the genetics off the top of my head,
[02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:17.610]  but it was a really outstanding plant.
[02:20:17.610 --> 02:20:20.610]  And he's done several of them here.
[02:20:20.610 --> 02:20:22.970]  And he's local in Michigan.
[02:20:23.970 --> 02:20:28.250]  And, you know, it was cool to see his name in there.
[02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:33.050]  And then the guy, this was very impressive.
[02:20:33.410 --> 02:20:37.690]  This Magic Bean Seeds, I thought was,
[02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:40.930]  he threw three packs into everyone's thing here
[02:20:40.930 --> 02:20:41.890]  of different stuff.
[02:20:41.890 --> 02:20:43.330]  And I thought that was very nice.
[02:20:43.330 --> 02:20:46.490]  I was, you know, his stuff is all, you know,
[02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:50.410]  kind of based off of other work, you know,
[02:20:50.410 --> 02:20:55.050]  as far as like it's Triangle Cush cross to a Dire Wolf.
[02:20:55.050 --> 02:20:57.930]  This is an Afghani Open Pollination.
[02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:59.570]  And then the other one is like a,
[02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:05.410]  is a Star Killer OG cross to an AJ Sour Diesel.
[02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:10.370]  So, you know, nothing that we haven't seen before,
[02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:14.250]  but nevertheless still very, you know,
[02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:16.530]  could be very, very good quality stuff.
[02:21:16.530 --> 02:21:17.930]  I, if you put it in there,
[02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:21.850]  I'm sure that, you know, he's a very good breeder.
[02:21:21.850 --> 02:21:25.370]  And so, you know, a very nice and kind,
[02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:26.690]  generous thing to do.
[02:21:26.930 --> 02:21:29.490]  And, you know, to be able to give a shout out
[02:21:29.490 --> 02:21:30.690]  to some of those breeders
[02:21:30.690 --> 02:21:32.290]  who were kind enough to contribute.
[02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:34.210]  Marty was another, or I'm sorry,
[02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:36.730]  Four Wise Eyes was another one that was,
[02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:41.450]  that contributed quite a lot to the pot as well.
[02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:43.730]  That was another person we talked about this evening
[02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:46.330]  who absolutely everyone should go look up
[02:21:46.330 --> 02:21:49.130]  because his stuff is outstanding
[02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:52.450]  between the Traverse City Cherry
[02:21:52.450 --> 02:21:55.610]  and the, he has another Cherry Cush.
[02:21:55.610 --> 02:22:00.610]  And then he has, his Flow G is outstanding.
[02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:03.730]  It's a Flow cross with a Go G OG.
[02:22:03.730 --> 02:22:08.730]  So, yeah, that's exactly good peeps up in Northern Michigan.
[02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:10.290]  Absolutely, man.
[02:22:11.170 --> 02:22:16.170]  So yeah, just giving a shout out for the small breeder,
[02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:20.490]  but a really nice celebration that they did up there
[02:22:20.490 --> 02:22:25.090]  for honoring the guys that do put in a lot of this hard work
[02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:27.530]  that you're talking about.
[02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:32.530]  Awesome, it's cool to have some of these smaller based
[02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:35.550]  events where it really is kind of the, you know,
[02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:36.930]  the local folks.
[02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:38.050]  Absolutely.
[02:22:38.050 --> 02:22:40.450]  Kind of one thing that blew my mind too is, you know,
[02:22:40.450 --> 02:22:42.210]  again, I'm on the West Coast.
[02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:45.550]  I'm not in California, but I'm in Washington
[02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:49.450]  and I've actually lived all three states on the West Coast.
[02:22:50.490 --> 02:22:53.570]  But, you know, the Cannabis Universe revolves
[02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:55.730]  around California.
[02:22:55.730 --> 02:23:00.730]  So when Michigan has just come with this plethora of,
[02:23:01.690 --> 02:23:04.490]  you know, breeders over these past few years,
[02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:06.250]  and they've been doing it for a lot longer
[02:23:06.250 --> 02:23:07.450]  than these past few years,
[02:23:07.450 --> 02:23:10.890]  but like the word got out to the West Coast and it's like,
[02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:13.250]  there's a lot of fire in Michigan, man.
[02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:16.610]  Like you guys have been hiding this whole time in a glove.
[02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:17.770]  Like what the hell?
[02:23:18.890 --> 02:23:20.190]  You know what, to be honest, man,
[02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:23.410]  it was because the crackdown on Michigan stuff
[02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:29.250]  was so intense that it was very hard
[02:23:30.970 --> 02:23:34.250]  to even want to expose yourself whatsoever
[02:23:34.250 --> 02:23:37.210]  to the question of the law.
[02:23:37.210 --> 02:23:41.530]  Because it got bad for a lot of people very quickly.
[02:23:41.530 --> 02:23:45.490]  And so I know that there were a lot of people who just,
[02:23:45.490 --> 02:23:49.330]  you know, my mentor basically taught me everything I know
[02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:51.890]  about cannabis was one of those.
[02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:54.850]  He used to gorilla grow out in the forest
[02:23:54.850 --> 02:23:56.650]  and in Northern Michigan actually.
[02:23:56.650 --> 02:24:00.090]  And he was the only, I mean,
[02:24:00.090 --> 02:24:05.050]  he was where I truly learned the incredible beauty
[02:24:05.050 --> 02:24:09.130]  that is original stock Acapulco Gold.
[02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:12.890]  Because he had that stuff coming from the early 60s.
[02:24:13.770 --> 02:24:17.170]  And that was stuff that they had all the way back then
[02:24:17.170 --> 02:24:21.410]  that he had worked stock all the way up from,
[02:24:21.930 --> 02:24:24.250]  that he had been working it for years and years and years
[02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:25.770]  and holding on to different plants.
[02:24:25.770 --> 02:24:27.490]  And then he'd throw them into different projects.
[02:24:27.490 --> 02:24:31.730]  And so, well, it obviously wasn't the original original
[02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:34.650]  that I was smoking at that point.
[02:24:34.650 --> 02:24:36.810]  But just to be able to have some of that,
[02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:41.050]  of the expression of that from the original was, man,
[02:24:41.050 --> 02:24:43.010]  it was something special for sure.
[02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:47.510]  So, you know, it was a lot of,
[02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:50.370]  I think a lot of hide and seek, unfortunately, in Michigan
[02:24:50.610 --> 02:24:52.850]  until kind of, I even remember when I went
[02:24:52.850 --> 02:24:54.250]  and got my first med card
[02:24:54.250 --> 02:24:57.570]  and it was in this really shady doctor's office thing.
[02:24:57.570 --> 02:25:00.850]  And it was like, I mean, I was 19 at the time.
[02:25:00.850 --> 02:25:04.730]  It had just become legal in the state of Michigan
[02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:07.970]  to have a medical marijuana card.
[02:25:07.970 --> 02:25:11.130]  But people were absolutely terrified to go and get them.
[02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:14.570]  And so it was just kind of like, you know,
[02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:16.410]  just wasn't done really.
[02:25:16.410 --> 02:25:20.970]  And so, yeah, now it's been nice
[02:25:20.970 --> 02:25:23.450]  that Michigan's been able to show a little bit more
[02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:25.490]  of what they have on offer.
[02:25:25.490 --> 02:25:29.250]  Cause I mean, Ohio was able to show out a little bit more.
[02:25:29.250 --> 02:25:31.730]  I mean, there were a number of strains that came from Ohio
[02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:33.810]  that were pretty epic.
[02:25:33.810 --> 02:25:35.290]  I mean, the Death Star,
[02:25:40.130 --> 02:25:42.850]  there was a really great cut of lemon skunk
[02:25:42.850 --> 02:25:43.970]  that came from Ohio.
[02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:48.730]  I remember, you know, Indiana had the bubble gum.
[02:25:48.730 --> 02:25:50.970]  So there were other strains from the Midwest
[02:25:50.970 --> 02:25:52.450]  that kind of like lit that up
[02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:54.730]  and Michigan was kind of quiet in the background.
[02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:58.530]  So, except some of you guys may remember,
[02:25:58.530 --> 02:26:01.730]  if you're good old head here
[02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:04.730]  is the pink conning purple paralyzer.
[02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:07.970]  I don't know if anyone on here might remember that or not,
[02:26:07.970 --> 02:26:12.970]  but it was a great strain that actually Moda Rebel
[02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:18.370]  did a creation of in seed form.
[02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:20.770]  And I have a pack of it that's just stored away
[02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:24.450]  that I'm like, it's just for the vanity sake of having it,
[02:26:24.450 --> 02:26:27.410]  to be honest, because it's like one of those things,
[02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:29.330]  you know, as a kid that was like,
[02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:32.570]  that was some of the best weed around, you know,
[02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:35.690]  even though I lived closer to Detroit,
[02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:39.930]  but after they dumped a bunch of cocaine into the AK-47,
[02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:44.930]  people ran far away from Detroit weed for a long time.
[02:26:44.970 --> 02:26:46.050]  So, yeah.
[02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:47.890]  That's not cost efficient dealers.
[02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:49.410]  No, no, it's not.
[02:26:49.410 --> 02:26:51.570]  And it scared the crap out of most people.
[02:26:51.570 --> 02:26:52.410]  Yeah.
[02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:54.850]  So they're responsible
[02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:57.890]  for all these Halloween bullshit stories.
[02:26:57.890 --> 02:26:58.730]  Okay.
[02:26:58.730 --> 02:27:00.770]  I just see a comment too,
[02:27:00.770 --> 02:27:01.650]  cause I was thinking, you know,
[02:27:01.650 --> 02:27:03.370]  you were talking about being sketched out
[02:27:03.370 --> 02:27:05.810]  about going to get your car for the first time
[02:27:05.810 --> 02:27:09.690]  and Florida Nugs, we, you know, we ran in the same area.
[02:27:10.450 --> 02:27:14.130]  Dude, if this was 2011, we got our card in the same place.
[02:27:15.210 --> 02:27:16.930]  I was up on Aurora Avenue,
[02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:18.530]  which for those who don't live in Seattle,
[02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:21.770]  Aurora Avenue is where the ladies of the night like to walk.
[02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:25.970]  It's not your family neighborhood,
[02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:28.970]  but yes, Aurora Avenue and a house with shady doctors,
[02:27:28.970 --> 02:27:30.450]  waiting room full of people.
[02:27:30.450 --> 02:27:32.010]  They didn't care what you said.
[02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:33.650]  They're just like $200.
[02:27:33.650 --> 02:27:34.530]  Thank you.
[02:27:34.530 --> 02:27:35.370]  Yup.
[02:27:35.370 --> 02:27:38.610]  And unfortunately that is why our med system disappeared
[02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:40.690]  is because it wasn't legitimate.
[02:27:40.690 --> 02:27:44.290]  People were stacking caregiver cards and that ran a problem.
[02:27:44.290 --> 02:27:48.330]  So fuckers abused it and they ruined a good system
[02:27:48.330 --> 02:27:50.890]  for people like myself and other people
[02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:53.050]  who needed a lot more than me.
[02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:54.490]  Now we have shitty wreck.
[02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:59.570]  But yeah, that was like 2011, Flora.
[02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:01.490]  We went to the same place.
[02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:02.330]  Yeah.
[02:28:04.770 --> 02:28:07.850]  So I guess maybe to wrap it up,
[02:28:08.250 --> 02:28:10.650]  what are the couple exciting things
[02:28:10.650 --> 02:28:13.610]  that you currently have right now at Joint?
[02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:14.770]  I know it's all exciting,
[02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:17.810]  but a couple ones that maybe wet your lips.
[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:20.490]  So really right now what we're doing is
[02:28:20.490 --> 02:28:25.490]  we're kind of, we're doing a bit of a reboot a little bit
[02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:30.490]  with a partner of mine left
[02:28:30.890 --> 02:28:34.170]  to pursue other avenues and whatever else.
[02:28:34.170 --> 02:28:37.690]  And so we had to kind of change course a little bit,
[02:28:38.530 --> 02:28:43.530]  we've continued to do the breeding
[02:28:43.850 --> 02:28:48.850]  and the genetic side of things in our own smaller way.
[02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:52.650]  And now we're just basically,
[02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:55.730]  we wanted to wait for the market to snap,
[02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:58.890]  as I said, kind of control burn a lot of these
[02:28:58.890 --> 02:29:01.290]  bigger companies that just have no business
[02:29:01.290 --> 02:29:02.930]  in this space whatsoever.
[02:29:02.970 --> 02:29:07.970]  And to be honest, we got enough of the push forward
[02:29:08.290 --> 02:29:11.690]  by a lot of really interesting people here in Michigan
[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:15.290]  about doing this from a very craft standpoint.
[02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:18.850]  And so we are really pushing forward with that.
[02:29:18.850 --> 02:29:23.730]  And right now are some of the strains
[02:29:23.730 --> 02:29:26.250]  that we're working with are,
[02:29:28.410 --> 02:29:31.170]  we have some really interesting,
[02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:36.450]  a very special I-95 that we're working on
[02:29:36.450 --> 02:29:41.450]  that we pheno hunted a significant amount of seeds out of.
[02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:48.050]  We, as I said, we're doing a lot of the kind of building
[02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:52.010]  blocks of like the Kashmir Azad work.
[02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:58.050]  We are, keep an eye out over the next six to eight months,
[02:29:58.570 --> 02:30:00.690]  there's gonna be some really interesting stuff.
[02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:03.210]  I really wanna be able to get some of it
[02:30:03.210 --> 02:30:06.850]  into all your hands and be able to let you
[02:30:06.850 --> 02:30:08.170]  run it a bit more.
[02:30:09.570 --> 02:30:12.690]  And I wanna be able to help out also,
[02:30:12.690 --> 02:30:15.490]  I had a blog started on our website
[02:30:15.490 --> 02:30:17.970]  and then between some health things
[02:30:17.970 --> 02:30:21.850]  and a change of management,
[02:30:21.850 --> 02:30:24.650]  we had to kind of work on other things.
[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:26.490]  And so that went a little bit by the wayside,
[02:30:26.490 --> 02:30:28.730]  but I'd like to be able to kind of get that running
[02:30:28.770 --> 02:30:31.210]  a little bit more for people,
[02:30:31.210 --> 02:30:33.610]  because the main thing that we wanna get out there
[02:30:33.610 --> 02:30:35.490]  is education for the consumer
[02:30:35.490 --> 02:30:38.410]  and be able to make sure that they understand
[02:30:38.410 --> 02:30:42.130]  at least the basic tenets of what this is all about
[02:30:42.130 --> 02:30:46.370]  and why cannabis could be very useful for them.
[02:30:46.370 --> 02:30:50.170]  And also why you shouldn't be so afraid of it
[02:30:50.170 --> 02:30:52.570]  and why it's not some evil drug
[02:30:52.570 --> 02:30:55.250]  that Nancy Reagan brainwashed you with.
[02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:56.730]  Just say no.
[02:30:56.730 --> 02:30:58.090]  Nancy Reagan, that's where it came from
[02:30:58.450 --> 02:31:00.450]  for those who weren't alive.
[02:31:00.450 --> 02:31:02.850]  Nancy Reagan, she gave us just say no
[02:31:02.850 --> 02:31:05.930]  and Tipper Gore gave us the freaking
[02:31:05.930 --> 02:31:07.850]  parental advisory stickers.
[02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:10.970]  I'm freaking laughing and you saw me
[02:31:10.970 --> 02:31:12.730]  probably almost stand up because I was like,
[02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.650]  oh, I don't have my wallet on me.
[02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:17.770]  I still carry my Evergreen Patient Network card
[02:31:17.770 --> 02:31:19.090]  in my wallet, dude.
[02:31:19.090 --> 02:31:20.810]  We really, we did.
[02:31:20.810 --> 02:31:22.650]  We went to the exact same spot for our cards.
[02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:23.490]  But yeah.
[02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:27.890]  The cards expired, but it was the last time
[02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:30.970]  that they were actually issuing ID cards for cannabis
[02:31:30.970 --> 02:31:34.370]  after that it went to an official state paper
[02:31:34.370 --> 02:31:35.290]  with watermarks.
[02:31:35.290 --> 02:31:37.490]  So I was like, dude, I wanna show my card right now
[02:31:37.490 --> 02:31:40.130]  because it was the exact same place
[02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:42.650]  we got our freaking recommendations.
[02:31:42.650 --> 02:31:43.730]  That's hilarious.
[02:31:43.730 --> 02:31:45.290]  Sorry.
[02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:46.610]  And no, you're good, man.
[02:31:46.610 --> 02:31:48.850]  And I just, once again, as always, Chad,
[02:31:48.850 --> 02:31:50.930]  thank you so much for having me on.
[02:31:50.930 --> 02:31:54.690]  It is always such a treat to come on and chat.
[02:31:55.650 --> 02:31:59.370]  And the chat also gave us some nice,
[02:31:59.370 --> 02:32:02.450]  some good references and some good questions too.
[02:32:02.450 --> 02:32:05.890]  And that's something that you can always reach out
[02:32:05.890 --> 02:32:07.730]  and ask too, if you ever,
[02:32:09.290 --> 02:32:11.770]  Chad was kind enough to put that in the,
[02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:14.850]  put our IG thing in there.
[02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:19.850]  And there's also a, yes, I do have an Insta.
[02:32:20.810 --> 02:32:24.490]  It's at joint cultivation.
[02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:26.890]  I missed that one, damn it.
[02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:28.050]  I'll pull that up here.
[02:32:28.050 --> 02:32:29.650]  I had no worries.
[02:32:29.650 --> 02:32:31.250]  Did I put that one up?
[02:32:31.250 --> 02:32:32.770]  I thought maybe you did.
[02:32:32.770 --> 02:32:33.810]  I'm not sure.
[02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:34.650]  Oh, there we go.
[02:32:34.650 --> 02:32:35.490]  Yes, I did.
[02:32:35.490 --> 02:32:36.330]  Oh, perfect.
[02:32:36.330 --> 02:32:37.490]  Organized.
[02:32:38.890 --> 02:32:42.410]  But yeah, I mean, honestly, anyone, anytime, feel free.
[02:32:42.410 --> 02:32:46.090]  I always try to keep up to date with that.
[02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:49.650]  I will get back to you within at least like a day or two.
[02:32:50.850 --> 02:32:55.010]  Please don't think that I'm trying to offend you
[02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:57.050]  if I don't get back to you in a day or something.
[02:32:57.050 --> 02:32:59.570]  It's not you, it's me and my schedule.
[02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:02.050]  So I got a two-year-old running around the house
[02:33:02.050 --> 02:33:06.850]  and a wife and a job and it's a hectic world.
[02:33:06.850 --> 02:33:11.010]  So, but I really love being able to help anyone
[02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:12.530]  that I can in this space.
[02:33:12.570 --> 02:33:17.570]  And so don't ever hesitate to get in touch for sure.
[02:33:18.010 --> 02:33:18.850]  That's awesome.
[02:33:18.850 --> 02:33:19.690]  And thanks for reaching out.
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:23.730]  And everybody too, these are all also down in the show notes.
[02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:25.170]  So they're just clickable links.
[02:33:25.170 --> 02:33:27.570]  You don't have to remember it or write them down.
[02:33:29.170 --> 02:33:32.010]  Dude, thank you again, James, for making the time
[02:33:32.010 --> 02:33:34.290]  and for coming here and sharing your knowledge.
[02:33:34.290 --> 02:33:36.570]  Definitely well-received.
[02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:37.930]  People enjoying the show.
[02:33:37.930 --> 02:33:40.450]  I, dude, I can't get enough of this.
[02:33:40.450 --> 02:33:43.690]  So we're definitely gonna do this again.
[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:44.970]  We'll go for the three-peat.
[02:33:44.970 --> 02:33:45.810]  Three-peat.
[02:33:45.810 --> 02:33:46.650]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:49.010]  I mean, man, you guys, you can have me out here anytime.
[02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:50.690]  Anytime Dave decides that, you know,
[02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:53.170]  he doesn't wanna be a part of this and, you know,
[02:33:53.170 --> 02:33:55.530]  just have me come in and take over for him.
[02:33:55.530 --> 02:33:58.450]  And, you know, we'll just set Dave adrift
[02:33:58.450 --> 02:33:59.450]  and that'll be fine.
[02:33:59.450 --> 02:34:01.050]  Dave, you're watching the replay.
[02:34:01.050 --> 02:34:02.650]  You just got out bid, dude.
[02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:06.050]  You just got out bid and there's 30 seconds left.
[02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:07.930]  I had to throw something in at him.
[02:34:07.930 --> 02:34:09.890]  I had to throw it in at the end, man.
[02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:12.130]  I had to get him somehow.
[02:34:12.130 --> 02:34:13.530]  That's why I love you, man.
[02:34:15.250 --> 02:34:16.290]  Oh, dude.
[02:34:16.290 --> 02:34:18.850]  Thank you, everybody in chat for hanging out tonight.
[02:34:18.850 --> 02:34:20.370]  This has been very fun.
[02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:23.650]  I absolutely love the interactions that we do on this show
[02:34:23.650 --> 02:34:25.050]  because it drives the show.
[02:34:25.050 --> 02:34:26.610]  It gives us what we need to pull,
[02:34:26.610 --> 02:34:29.410]  what we wanna talk about and directions to go.
[02:34:29.410 --> 02:34:31.490]  So thank you for being part of that.
[02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:34.050]  You're the third box tonight.
[02:34:34.050 --> 02:34:34.970]  Absolutely.
[02:34:34.970 --> 02:34:35.930]  Absolutely.
[02:34:35.930 --> 02:34:38.250]  Yes, 100%.
[02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:40.570]  Appreciate having you all, you guys on there with us.
[02:34:40.570 --> 02:34:43.170]  And Chad, once again, love you, buddy.
[02:34:43.170 --> 02:34:45.850]  And I'll be talking to you soon.
[02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:46.690]  Cool.
[02:34:46.690 --> 02:34:49.250]  All right, well, I will hit the end broadcast button here,
[02:34:49.250 --> 02:34:51.490]  but James, rock on brother.
[02:34:51.490 --> 02:34:53.490]  And we will definitely talk soon.
[02:34:53.490 --> 02:34:54.330]  All right, man.
[02:34:54.330 --> 02:34:55.170]  Sounds good.
[02:34:55.170 --> 02:34:56.130]  Peace out, everybody.
