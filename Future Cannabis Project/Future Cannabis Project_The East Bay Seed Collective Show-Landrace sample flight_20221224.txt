[00:02.110 --> 00:13.470]  All right, we're live. Good morning. Kush morning everybody. It's the day before
[00:13.470 --> 00:20.910]  Christmas. It's Christmas Eve and yeah we have an awesome show. As I start to wake
[00:20.910 --> 00:26.590]  up my brain will start seeing my brain start moving faster and faster. Yeah we
[00:26.590 --> 00:34.910]  have our guest. I'm gonna put him on right now. Good morning. Morning. Yeah we
[00:34.910 --> 00:42.110]  got Huey Jack back on. He was my original partner in crime with this but yeah he's
[00:42.110 --> 00:49.230]  back on. Did you get my text? I did as I walked in the door I had to run out to
[00:49.230 --> 00:56.830]  the grocery store which what a shit show that was. Yeah. Do you want to like maybe
[00:56.830 --> 01:01.670]  put out like a tray and I can probably like help you put them in like a
[01:01.670 --> 01:07.870]  specific order I was figuring. So for today's show my idea was that we would
[01:07.870 --> 01:19.430]  do a little like flight tasting of some heirloom genetics just some like
[01:19.430 --> 01:25.870]  base genetics. I have a few things that we can kind of compare and contrast
[01:25.870 --> 01:30.870]  which is really cool. I thought you know with these different tastings it would
[01:30.870 --> 01:35.590]  kind of take some of the mystery away from a lot of this because I feel like a
[01:35.590 --> 01:41.590]  lot of what we do as growers is we kind of like see something it interests us
[01:41.590 --> 01:46.310]  and then we grow it and we kind of think what it's gonna be like and it takes a
[01:46.310 --> 01:52.070]  long time to actually figure out what the actual effect is of that smoke. So
[01:52.070 --> 01:57.070]  now we have some flowers in front of us of some interesting cultivars that
[01:57.070 --> 02:02.870]  aren't super common and we can kind of talk about them show pictures of them
[02:02.870 --> 02:08.830]  compare and contrast and that will give you guys a better idea of you know if
[02:08.830 --> 02:12.110]  you're digging into these populations what you might know. I know if it's me or you
[02:12.110 --> 02:21.270]  somebody's fuzzing out. I mean it's I mean I'm clear on here I don't know if
[02:21.270 --> 02:29.830]  okay well it might be me I'm on a hot spot so yeah in the chat are we are we
[02:29.830 --> 02:36.150]  clear everybody? Let me know if anything isn't clear but did you did you hear
[02:36.150 --> 02:42.110]  what I said Huey? No not really no sorry. Okay no worries so basically I was
[02:42.110 --> 02:49.710]  saying um when we grow often we're kind of guessing what the outcome is
[02:49.710 --> 02:54.030]  gonna be what we're smoking what the effects will be and with a lot of these
[02:54.030 --> 02:57.790]  cultivars awesome yeah people are saying it's clear a lot of these cults so it's
[02:57.790 --> 03:03.830]  you so with a lot of these cultivars people don't know what they're gonna be
[03:03.830 --> 03:10.510]  like and so it'd be cool for us to do like a flight basically like a tasting
[03:10.510 --> 03:16.070]  and we can go over these different flavors and you know like I don't want
[03:16.070 --> 03:20.270]  it to be too much us just straight smoking the whole time but like you know
[03:20.270 --> 03:25.790]  I feel like we have some pretty interesting cultivars to go through and
[03:25.790 --> 03:29.630]  you know like I think that would that's that's what we're gonna do today and
[03:29.630 --> 03:33.750]  then I talked to Grasshopper for a second he may come on if he's feeling up
[03:33.750 --> 03:40.630]  to it he's still you know wait waking up this morning but yeah is that cool?
[03:40.630 --> 03:52.950]  I got beer class so. Awesome. Is there anything you would like to address with the our show or
[03:52.950 --> 03:58.550]  anything before we we start with that? I'm sure there is but I'm still not
[03:58.550 --> 04:08.910]  awake either so yeah. Okay. So I mean I think so okay we're so we're gonna there
[04:08.910 --> 04:15.790]  are six see there's eight different things for the first one is this this is
[04:15.790 --> 04:24.550]  a pure Thai I believe it's a God I'm gonna need to go back and see the exact
[04:24.550 --> 04:29.190]  name of it it's from one of our seed club members named Taj something ranch
[04:29.190 --> 04:37.870]  Thai so the first Alpine ranch Thai Alpine ranch Thai and I mean the bugs
[04:37.870 --> 04:46.670]  look sorry this light is not working come on light so yeah I mean the buds
[04:46.670 --> 04:51.590]  are traditional Thai I guess I mean I just have not smoked that much Thai to
[04:51.590 --> 04:56.990]  really to really comment on it then the next we're gonna go with is I believe
[04:56.990 --> 05:03.310]  another pheno of this Thai which I'm extremely excited about maybe Hugh if
[05:03.310 --> 05:11.350]  you want to put your put the nugs up there I'm still slacking in the nugg so
[05:11.350 --> 05:16.510]  it's a similar thing it's just a little bit denser very interesting stuff and
[05:16.510 --> 05:24.310]  then next we have some Hanalei this one here we go some Hanalei so this is like
[05:24.310 --> 05:34.910]  a chunkier pheno then here we have another pheno upon a lay here is some
[05:34.910 --> 05:44.940]  sour diesel so you can kind of like and then here is some diesel first one was
[05:44.940 --> 05:56.980]  sour this one is just straight diesel here's the day is this sour for me and I
[05:56.980 --> 06:13.340]  gotta jump into the big bag for the diesel oh and why is saying hopefully
[06:13.340 --> 06:17.940]  we're staying warm yeah I'm gonna have I was gonna do this in my garage but I'm
[06:17.940 --> 06:24.100]  gonna stay warm so which one is that the diesel yeah and then the last but not
[06:24.100 --> 06:38.550]  least is the Congo hash plant so here is a more hash plant you know and here
[06:38.550 --> 06:51.980]  is a more Congo you know we're smoking that last that stuff lit me last night I
[06:52.140 --> 06:59.620]  was gonna say um I'm a as far as order I don't really want to smoke the Hanalei
[06:59.620 --> 07:09.380]  second second I think maybe the Hanalei should be last or second to last I was
[07:09.380 --> 07:19.060]  thinking maybe we would do Thai sour and diesel and then either Hanalei or or
[07:19.100 --> 07:29.380]  Congo hash plants what are your thoughts I'm game that sounds good um and yeah I
[07:29.380 --> 07:36.140]  mean definitely when we get towards the end of this I don't know how much we're
[07:36.140 --> 07:42.220]  gonna be able to truly tell the effects differently yeah well just let's just
[07:42.220 --> 07:49.100]  start with the beginning this alpine alpine ranch tie is you know from one of
[07:49.100 --> 07:55.900]  our members this is the best tie weed I've why aren't they trimmed that's a
[07:55.900 --> 08:03.420]  great that's all growers trim when you're an actual grower you don't trim
[08:03.420 --> 08:11.560]  your shit well I would just say like I have a two-year-old I'm so I just have a
[08:11.560 --> 08:17.720]  lot of shit going on on my plate so actually some of these are trimmed
[08:17.720 --> 08:25.360]  we did farmers trim did yeah yeah I mean you don't really need to trim it for
[08:25.360 --> 08:28.360]  smoking you do need to trim it if you're gonna sell it but if you're I mean I
[08:28.360 --> 08:34.600]  just don't really sell any weed so I don't I don't really trim it so my
[08:34.600 --> 08:38.400]  personal stuff I really don't either you know I give it a I just take the fan
[08:38.560 --> 08:44.200]  leaves off and I leave a lot of the other stuff so yeah that's why here's
[08:44.200 --> 08:51.160]  everybody good morning uh alpine ranch tie here we go
[08:52.760 --> 09:04.250]  dude my cat's trying to jump on the tray of weed this morning I have to tell you
[09:04.250 --> 09:12.810]  no kitty that's a bad kitty it was my cheesy poofs what do you think I mean I
[09:12.810 --> 09:19.850]  smoked high stick from Thailand for my mom like in the 80s like she found a
[09:19.850 --> 09:26.930]  brick of that stuff that had been like something similar yeah so interestingly
[09:26.930 --> 09:32.730]  I get a lot of this like baby poop kind of thing going on it's like rotting
[09:32.730 --> 09:42.170]  fruit type of yeah it's like this rotting fruit skunk genetics like
[09:42.730 --> 09:52.730]  he has that a lot I don't know if it's like the orange skunk thing going on but
[09:52.730 --> 09:58.650]  I get a lot of that smell do you know I'm talking about Jeff yeah just trust
[09:58.650 --> 10:04.570]  me baby poop is a very different smell than an adult carnitas poop so you know
[10:04.570 --> 10:09.450]  what's kind of like it's like a fermented fruit type of type of thing
[10:09.450 --> 10:15.290]  like it's like a rotting I don't know if it's like an overly it's like overly
[10:15.290 --> 10:19.170]  ripe type of fruit type of smell that's that's kind of what I'm getting from it
[10:19.170 --> 10:25.810]  yeah dirty diaper weed exactly yeah it is weird cuz I have a two-year-old and
[10:25.810 --> 10:33.850]  I'll tell you it's not interesting but interestingly enough from hanging out
[10:33.850 --> 10:37.650]  with grasshopper I learned that he does not like that smell and that's actually
[10:37.650 --> 10:41.370]  something that he really veers away from which is really cool and
[10:41.370 --> 10:45.810]  interesting because when you get to know these types of things about people you
[10:45.810 --> 10:48.650]  can understand in there selecting what they're what they're picking and what
[10:48.650 --> 10:55.090]  they're not and you know just from that little hint from him and he's like yeah
[10:55.090 --> 10:59.410]  I like the candy stuff you know in my mind I was just like okay I can see
[10:59.410 --> 11:03.290]  instantly the kind of stuff they are into and the kind of stuff that you
[11:03.290 --> 11:07.690]  breed for so you know if you like the candy stuff definitely go with
[11:07.690 --> 11:11.530]  grasshopper stuff I mean which is which isn't dry these seeds but you know just
[11:11.530 --> 11:15.650]  in general you know it's good to know those kind of things what people like
[11:15.650 --> 11:19.610]  because you know when you like those same things you know there you go good
[11:19.610 --> 11:25.090]  morning good morning and diva where's mine I thought yeah it's just we're
[11:25.090 --> 11:31.690]  sharing I mean you may you may get a something and you may get a little
[11:31.690 --> 11:37.370]  something and give it so yeah I'm gonna try this one what do you think of the
[11:37.370 --> 11:45.530]  high I mean I could see that if I smoke too much of this I might get a headache
[11:45.530 --> 11:52.890]  but it's bright dude like all of a sudden like the coffees not kicked in
[11:52.890 --> 11:58.370]  but all of a sudden I just realized I'm like ping you know like it hit me like
[11:58.370 --> 12:06.810]  right in the temples I'm definitely I'm awake so it's it's not it's not a downer
[12:06.810 --> 12:14.450]  high it's at all you take another hit so something interestingly that I learned
[12:14.450 --> 12:22.610]  from smoking this weed is that this is actually too much sativa for me because
[12:22.610 --> 12:27.730]  I mean I've smoked this bag a few times and you know it's it's the most sativa
[12:27.730 --> 12:32.730]  weed that I've smoked and this you know like it's tasty but as far as the effect
[12:32.730 --> 12:37.290]  it's almost I mean I would argue for me it's it's too much sativa like it's kind
[12:37.290 --> 12:43.370]  of like like when I smoke this it makes me understand why you why people put
[12:43.370 --> 12:50.010]  indica into into their hybrids because it kind of gives it a little bit more I
[12:50.010 --> 12:56.370]  don't know if it's like substance or if it's focus or its direction I feel like
[12:56.370 --> 13:01.490]  I would almost mix this stuff with tobacco and that might be like which I
[13:01.490 --> 13:05.970]  in general don't really like to do but I feel like for me it's almost like too
[13:05.970 --> 13:14.970]  much just kind of going up like this and not really like I don't know I get you
[13:14.970 --> 13:19.850]  almost all my friends are split smokers and I'm like like now I'm just gonna
[13:19.850 --> 13:25.690]  roll a straight joint but I get it though like yeah I mean every once in
[13:25.690 --> 13:30.730]  a while it's it's not my cup of tea per se or coffee but every once in a while
[13:30.730 --> 13:37.090]  you know I like to I like to smoke these really pure sativas to kind of like
[13:37.090 --> 13:42.930]  check them out the one thing I've noticed with them is like especially
[13:42.930 --> 13:47.810]  things like this I think if I had smoked previously something else I think this
[13:47.810 --> 13:51.570]  would have just wiped the slate clean you know like like some weed is just
[13:51.570 --> 13:57.330]  like nope you're not high anymore this is what you're doing and I think this
[13:57.330 --> 14:02.370]  could be one of those trades which there's benefits for that especially if
[14:02.370 --> 14:07.290]  you're at a weed smoking party at a 420 party you got like 20 different things
[14:07.290 --> 14:11.390]  or eight different things that you know I might go back to this later if I get
[14:11.390 --> 14:15.050]  too lit after we smoke the Hanalei and all that I'll be like well I'm gonna
[14:15.050 --> 14:23.050]  clean the slate a little bit elevate it yeah no I mean this is this is a good
[14:23.050 --> 14:29.210]  there's a good example and chief Taj if you're if you're listening props um
[14:29.210 --> 14:35.210]  something that I noticed for me is that this weed kind of acts like MSG in my
[14:35.210 --> 14:41.090]  brain like what you want to eat more I want it's it's like I want to smoke more
[14:41.090 --> 14:46.610]  you know what I mean it's like it's like oh like okay I want to keep doing
[14:46.610 --> 14:50.450]  you know I mean it's like it kind of it's an excuse I mean I don't know like
[14:50.450 --> 14:54.490]  you know I missed you as an excitotoxin like you can tell if your food has MSG
[14:54.490 --> 14:59.210]  in it when you lick the bowl clean you know what I mean like when you're eating
[14:59.210 --> 15:03.610]  like Vietnamese food and you're just like slurping the broth and just like
[15:03.610 --> 15:09.050]  you know what I mean like every every every drip of it are you on the next one
[15:09.050 --> 15:16.970]  yeah I'm going to 71 DPO yeah I reached out to a friend I hadn't talked to in
[15:16.970 --> 15:22.570]  two years last night we had an hour-long chat it was good to catch up so yes it
[15:22.570 --> 15:28.450]  is the holidays yes it's a time when people are depressed and you know a lot
[15:28.450 --> 15:31.930]  of us don't show that sort of shit so thanks for bringing that up if you have
[15:31.930 --> 15:35.450]  a friend you haven't talked to in a while reach out man before the end of
[15:35.450 --> 15:42.850]  the year thanks for bringing that up yeah a hundred percent I mean um I don't
[15:42.850 --> 15:48.650]  know we're not here forever so you know tell people that you care about them and
[15:48.650 --> 15:58.390]  that they're your homies you know the best presents are free and you know the
[15:58.390 --> 16:04.690]  more possessions you have the harder life can be so it's funny like totally
[16:04.690 --> 16:12.810]  off-topic subject it was my kids birthday like a month ago and the more
[16:12.810 --> 16:22.170]  presents we gave her the least happy she became throughout the day and you know
[16:22.170 --> 16:28.490]  the more like things that she had that were hers the least happy she was and
[16:28.490 --> 16:33.890]  the funniest or the most joyful part for me was that the gift that she liked the
[16:33.890 --> 16:42.050]  most were some balloons that I got her and you know it just felt really nice to
[16:42.050 --> 16:49.010]  see that the simplest things brought the most joy and you know I was like oh shit
[16:49.010 --> 16:53.450]  you know already her possessions are becoming an issue you know and it really
[16:53.450 --> 16:58.410]  reminded me like you don't need a million possessions you need a few
[16:58.410 --> 17:06.770]  things a few things that make you happy and your friends and your family so
[17:06.770 --> 17:11.410]  which one are we going to the next one yeah dude this one's uh it's a little
[17:11.410 --> 17:17.090]  bit of that baby poop baby diaper smell but it's a lot fruitier I'm getting more
[17:17.090 --> 17:22.690]  you know there's like like it's like overripe mango or something like that
[17:22.690 --> 17:27.870]  dude on it that one is it's like a bunch of calyxes pushed together like the
[17:27.870 --> 17:32.150]  first one we smoked was like like a traditional looking tie stick like it
[17:32.150 --> 17:36.590]  was thin and tiny you kind of would like have to smash a bunch of them together
[17:36.590 --> 17:43.230]  this one had the bud structure of like a solid bud like this one seemed like it
[17:43.230 --> 17:47.470]  could be possibly like commercially viable or you know like at least
[17:47.470 --> 17:55.190]  practical dude that went straight to my noggin that's an expander we'd almost
[17:55.190 --> 17:59.390]  cough but coughed a lung up you know when they talk about that Southeast
[17:59.390 --> 18:04.750]  Asian weed it just like expands in your lungs like yeah this is it right here
[18:04.750 --> 18:13.270]  like whoo so I smoked that one was that yesterday or a few days ago and it it
[18:13.270 --> 18:18.030]  had me the highest that I'd been in definitely like a year I wasn't sure
[18:18.030 --> 18:21.990]  what was going on it and know if I was like low blood sugar cuz my brain
[18:21.990 --> 18:26.830]  started to like tickle and I don't know do that right now
[18:26.830 --> 18:36.510]  feel it in my eyeballs dude like yeah like okay fuck me y'all trying to get me
[18:36.510 --> 18:41.470]  dead before I gotta do shit later today but it's all good oh you won't be able
[18:41.470 --> 18:48.390]  to do anything today after all of this for sure yeah I'm supposed to be moving
[18:48.470 --> 18:55.910]  yeah this one is pretty interesting it's like chunky it really has like a
[18:55.910 --> 19:02.670]  fat nug structure and apparently from Todd's this was a pretty common pheno
[19:02.670 --> 19:09.150]  that came out of there I like this pheno better than the thin one I know I said
[19:09.150 --> 19:13.350]  that before but I really like this one a lot a lot better operation annihilation
[19:13.350 --> 19:19.750]  we're smoking the second tie the second of the two tie the actually more nuggy
[19:19.750 --> 19:26.910]  than sparse so you know it's like I've already feel that interesting feeling
[19:26.910 --> 19:31.430]  it's like it almost feels like the blood is like I don't know if it's going to
[19:31.430 --> 19:35.510]  your brain or if like your blood vessels are opening or something but it's like
[19:35.510 --> 19:40.350]  tingling all up in here which is weird I mean you would think people like would
[19:40.350 --> 19:43.510]  say this kind of stuff you're like you guys don't smoke weed you're just like
[19:43.510 --> 19:48.830]  fronting but like it's it's really interesting like I can kind of feel it
[19:48.830 --> 20:00.190]  like the front of my head a lot feels like I got a headband on so yeah so
[20:00.190 --> 20:08.150]  basically here are two or two type he knows I'm arguing that the chunkier one
[20:08.150 --> 20:14.510]  of this alpine ranch I mean it still has that like baby poo type smell to it
[20:14.510 --> 20:22.950]  that some people don't like I love it and the high I mean it feels it feels
[20:22.950 --> 20:31.870]  similar to every once in a while I have passed out that is something that I that
[20:31.870 --> 20:35.790]  I guess I'm genetically prone to and right before you pass out you can
[20:35.790 --> 20:40.070]  literally feel your blood vessels kind of opening and the blood moving in
[20:40.070 --> 20:46.830]  different ways in your body that's the shit that I feel like right now I can
[20:46.830 --> 20:56.270]  do it like this with my eyebrows just kind of weird I can't smoke no more of
[20:56.270 --> 21:06.240]  that stuff right this morning no no all right so I'm gonna try that second one
[21:06.480 --> 21:12.680]  so yeah what are you what is your growing that you're your projects you're
[21:12.680 --> 21:19.360]  getting into um shoot I'm about to move into a bigger space here as you can see
[21:19.360 --> 21:27.440]  really packed much shit but I do have a new place and so like it's got bigger
[21:27.440 --> 21:32.800]  space I'm probably gonna work in the hazes I really want to work on the
[21:32.800 --> 21:39.160]  citrus hazes so like relics grapefruit haze and then working probably gonna do
[21:39.160 --> 21:46.040]  an open pollination with this super or the tangy haze f2s and rather than do a
[21:46.040 --> 21:53.520]  selection for the f3s probably just gonna be an open poll with those I don't
[21:53.520 --> 21:57.880]  know like and we're I'm working more towards the haze the super silver side
[21:57.880 --> 22:06.000]  of things there's also some of yours and grasshoppers gear that I want to get at
[22:06.000 --> 22:13.000]  this next year too so I would highly recommend working with bad diesel
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.440]  wait the sour the diesel the diesel I don't have that cut you're gonna have to
[22:18.440 --> 22:24.480]  give that to me yeah sure that's that's the one I'm very I'm very hopeful about
[22:24.480 --> 22:29.920]  I mean here's here's that one here's the diesel nice all right I'm gonna get at
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.640]  that we this dude pep o cam I don't know what that is but I love I love me some
[22:36.640 --> 22:43.520]  headbanger and the straw Nana 14 or cut from Colorado will always stay in my
[22:43.520 --> 22:50.560]  collection so and like interestingly I don't know if you all I'll remind people
[22:50.560 --> 22:57.760]  Huey's cannabis is always extremely potent you can you'll you can tell the
[22:57.760 --> 23:03.920]  type of stuff that he breeds and grows because it's always always always not
[23:03.920 --> 23:11.040]  sleepy but like trying to figure out how to explain it it's like the kind of
[23:11.040 --> 23:19.640]  stuff that's so potent that you lose a bunch of seeds for like three months you
[23:19.640 --> 23:24.400]  know like we're like parts I mean would you consider that blackout weed we're
[23:24.400 --> 23:31.440]  like you smoke and like you know great time but like I don't remember half of
[23:31.440 --> 23:36.960]  this this stuff that went down in diva I do like the baby poop shit I like a
[23:36.960 --> 23:43.400]  lot of stuff I love Jack turps I'm like one of those weird outcasts who like you
[23:43.400 --> 23:50.160]  know like I don't like I never really liked super super overtly like sweet
[23:50.160 --> 23:56.720]  stuff but I do love the old-school flavors it takes me back you know takes
[23:56.720 --> 24:01.200]  me back to the 80s when I was in high school so yeah I do like that shit I do
[24:01.200 --> 24:06.560]  like the baby shit yeah I mean for me it's like also I don't really care what
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.960]  it tastes I like some that taste good but I like stuff that gets me in the
[24:10.960 --> 24:17.920]  right effect mostly that's what I'm the most excited about it's like if it tastes
[24:17.920 --> 24:22.480]  terrible but it gives you the best effect for me I'll just associate that
[24:22.480 --> 24:28.960]  terrible taste with that effect so it was interesting is like it like when I
[24:28.960 --> 24:32.680]  was in a shoot I was in Amsterdam this was a long time now it's like seven or
[24:32.680 --> 24:39.080]  eight years ago I smoked some Thai and it was terrible it was not cured right
[24:39.080 --> 24:42.680]  you know like there was no comparison to what we just smoked now like you
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.800]  couldn't taste it and be like if there's turps on it it was just like fermented
[24:46.800 --> 24:54.960]  brown I mean so and also I'm curious you know perhaps that stuff that's fermented
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.880]  has a different high and that maybe has a more desirable stronger high than if
[24:59.880 --> 25:05.200]  it's like cured to way that the way that we like it you know I mean cured where
[25:05.200 --> 25:09.240]  it's like nice and green and that kind of thing you know which should kind of
[25:09.240 --> 25:15.080]  go into like how like people in Afghanistan and Pakistan like or even
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.800]  Morocco like when you see their cannabis that they're using to make hash out of
[25:19.800 --> 25:26.920]  it's a completely different thing than what we would use to make hash out of
[25:26.920 --> 25:30.720]  and how people would like fresh freeze and you know what I mean like all this
[25:30.720 --> 25:36.440]  different stuff yeah yeah so yours truly just throwing it out there nothing is
[25:36.440 --> 25:44.000]  for sale so not on here and most of the cuts that we get from people are traded
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.080]  not bought we'll do trades with people that we know that have legit cuts I mean
[25:50.080 --> 25:54.840]  I would say definitely there'll be some hybrids coming out yeah I mean totally
[25:54.840 --> 25:58.200]  seeds and stuff absolutely yeah yeah they'll definitely be some hybrids
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.800]  coming out I've already hit it to the Hanalei so it's the Hawaiian and then I
[26:03.800 --> 26:08.280]  also hit it to the Malawi super super excited I think that's what I'll be
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.560]  working with next year is the Malawi but yeah I mean I think that the Malawi or
[26:13.640 --> 26:22.200]  diesel Malawi's would be a pretty interesting thing I think those and you
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.040]  know and also keep in mind that diesel breeds hell of dominance so like you
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.640]  know when you buy those I mean I'm not I don't want to say when you buy these
[26:30.640 --> 26:37.360]  seeds you're gonna be getting a lot of those but I'm assuming my prediction is
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.800]  that when you grow out those you'll be getting a lot of a lot of diesel
[26:42.800 --> 26:48.040]  phenotypes but you know you have to grow you have to test it and that's why
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.960]  all this stuff takes way more time than is practical because we're putting out
[26:52.960 --> 26:59.320]  stuff that's tested yes so what are you smoking on the diesel right now yeah
[26:59.320 --> 27:09.600]  what do you think maybe as diesel always is for the reason I wanted I brought in
[27:09.600 --> 27:14.040]  the diesel is like you know the straight diesel is not super common
[27:14.040 --> 27:20.640]  sour diesel used to be all over the place but you know it was cool to stick
[27:20.640 --> 27:28.120]  like can't you compare and contrast them like to side by side so yeah here is
[27:28.120 --> 27:37.200]  sour here is diesel I mean I guess these are slightly different but the diesel
[27:37.200 --> 27:44.440]  one it's a little bit light diesel is lighter in color the buds are way more
[27:44.440 --> 27:52.680]  square I think it's a bit louder do you think it's louder the sour over the
[27:52.680 --> 28:11.520]  diesel the diesel I think I think the diesel is louder than sour shit dude I
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.560]  put that I put that lemon stuff dude in the same bag and those lemon turps like
[28:17.560 --> 28:29.360]  really frickin just kind of well it's on the diesel also there we go and it's
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.360]  weird like when I smell both of these it's like you get this high lemon smell
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.680]  and then you get this like after smell that's like a very planty material has
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.600]  anybody in the chat know what I'm talking about like when you smell diesels
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.880]  it's like the back end of the diesel there's like this heavy plant material
[28:47.880 --> 28:56.620]  smell that combines with the like it's funny dude this sour this sour sample
[28:56.620 --> 29:00.500]  that you gave me that I know is the sour dude if when I break into it and get
[29:00.500 --> 29:06.420]  into the middle it smells like paint thinner so level playing fields is
[29:06.420 --> 29:12.860]  asking if there's any skunkiness in it in the diesel no not once over I mean I
[29:13.180 --> 29:22.580]  don't get it I mean to me it tastes like a sharper version of sour diesel that's
[29:22.580 --> 29:26.540]  that's all that I really get from it it's like sharper version of sour diesel
[29:26.540 --> 29:34.940]  the blood structure is even more eccentric than the sour bud structure so
[29:34.940 --> 29:44.780]  it's even more not ruled out like if you see like like if you can kind of it's
[29:44.780 --> 29:47.780]  like see see there I don't know if you guys can see that see it's like the bud
[29:47.780 --> 29:57.370]  is it's like a lot of basically like calyxes like this I don't know if you
[29:57.370 --> 30:04.090]  guys are getting this or not but it's like a bunch of like essentially it's a
[30:04.090 --> 30:08.850]  bunch of there you go it's like a bunch of these things just like press together
[30:08.850 --> 30:15.130]  and that's what makes the diesel as opposed to the sour which is still like
[30:15.130 --> 30:24.450]  actually a bud you know more less like little little little things grown out
[30:24.450 --> 30:33.610]  and pushed together and more like an actual bud so I don't know but at the
[30:33.610 --> 30:42.850]  same time it grows extremely similar to sour it gets big it takes basically the
[30:42.850 --> 30:47.810]  exact same amount of time I know that there are various cuts of New York City
[30:47.810 --> 30:51.850]  diesel sour diesel West Coast sour diesel and like some of them are short
[30:51.850 --> 30:57.170]  plants are you familiar with that do we yeah I mean there's there's so many
[30:57.170 --> 31:01.050]  different cuts of the diesel out there like the East Coast grows a little more
[31:01.050 --> 31:08.090]  water you know like the sour that floated around here in California I
[31:08.090 --> 31:17.210]  don't know what the thing gets like you know yeah I had a friend growing
[31:17.210 --> 31:23.650]  outdoors in San Leandro and it was just like freaking giant plant you know
[31:23.650 --> 31:30.410]  that's what this hour is yeah yeah your plants were pretty big as well so
[31:30.530 --> 31:37.290]  yeah and I mean honestly like I didn't eat like I kind of stunted those like I
[31:37.290 --> 31:42.710]  transplanted those outside and it was like July or August they were in 15
[31:42.710 --> 31:48.370]  gallon pots for most of their life but they still get huge I don't know if
[31:48.370 --> 31:52.850]  people don't know I mean I'm I'm just gonna go over this because I don't know
[31:52.850 --> 31:58.010]  if people know or not so I'm just gonna go sour is a great plan for outdoors
[31:58.010 --> 32:07.410]  great thing it produces a lot of really good quality herb it's commercially
[32:07.410 --> 32:18.170]  viable and it's really good quality it actually makes amazing extracts I don't
[32:18.170 --> 32:24.290]  see it I'm not as much tied in with with the extract whatever game but it makes
[32:24.290 --> 32:32.050]  great extracts yeah and I mean it's like one of those things that's just
[32:32.050 --> 32:42.850]  really good and it yields a lot and I kind of think that the diesel might take
[32:42.850 --> 32:49.930]  its place because I think it's just as good and almost even better so yeah
[32:49.930 --> 32:56.850]  what are you smoking no flower taking about three or four hits each what do
[32:56.850 --> 33:03.850]  you think of a sour it's good it's heavy sour you know
[33:04.770 --> 33:09.090]  sour is one of those always those weird eyes like I've had sour what's like
[33:09.090 --> 33:14.810]  really good daytime need to smoke and I've had sour before what's like I don't
[33:14.810 --> 33:22.690]  want to get up off the couch yeah I'm hoping this is not the latter you know I
[33:22.690 --> 33:29.370]  think because it's outdoor it doesn't have that extra level of potency to it
[33:29.370 --> 33:42.200]  yeah yeah I mean I think the sour is a really good one I mean what do you think
[33:42.680 --> 33:50.000]  I mean they both are good they both have their you know their little things I
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.960]  think it just boils down to personal preference like really because I mean
[33:53.960 --> 33:59.400]  they're both really similar you know and I mean we have we have people in the
[33:59.400 --> 34:03.240]  club that are like I like this and another person says well I like that you
[34:03.240 --> 34:09.960]  know and that's just that's just what what it is you know I mean yeah I think
[34:09.960 --> 34:16.440]  I'm on you I'm with you though about the diesel though just a plain diesel
[34:16.440 --> 34:22.480]  yeah it'd be interesting to experiment with the two I actually like to make a
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.040]  couple crosses you know and we can just kind of see like which turned out better
[34:27.040 --> 34:32.320]  like on something that is proven that we know what the mail is gonna bring to the
[34:32.320 --> 34:39.400]  table pretty much any every time we could hit the sour and the diesel yeah
[34:39.400 --> 34:44.680]  and kind of go from there and see what's up I smoke these the last week
[34:44.680 --> 34:54.520]  it was what I wanted to keep smoking your berries yeah yeah I mean you know
[34:54.520 --> 34:57.720]  like I think I could have grown this better I think it could be better but I
[34:57.720 --> 35:06.560]  mean it's fire all right so let's do you want to talk about these homilies you
[35:06.560 --> 35:15.680]  want to talk about the Congo hash plants I don't know dude if you gave me
[35:15.680 --> 35:24.400]  that on a play that I got at your party then maybe I want to smoke that last
[35:24.400 --> 35:31.600]  because that that stuff made me feel like I'd eat mushrooms so I don't know
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.560]  fuck it let's get into it it's a fun you want to do that over the Congo ash
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.960]  plant yeah dude because I smoked the Congo hash plant last night which one
[35:41.960 --> 35:46.040]  did you smoke the thinner one or the thick one oh whatever that nug was that
[35:46.040 --> 35:54.040]  you threw down on the table that I was smoking on I just finished that up yeah
[35:54.160 --> 36:00.960]  well I tried to mix a DJ set last night and was too high yeah it was too much
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.520]  for you a little too much for me yeah and I tried to zone out and watch TV and
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.120]  then it was like what did I just watch so well that's why I like I think I
[36:11.120 --> 36:16.720]  smoked some of that and then I talked to you and then I was like I'm gonna take a
[36:16.720 --> 36:25.800]  nap then you came by and Katya was like Jeff's here I'm like oh yeah uh-huh
[36:25.800 --> 36:38.320]  yeah she looked at me was like is he expecting you and I was like yes it's
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.320]  the holidays you know I love what level playing field said we'll be moving today
[36:44.320 --> 36:55.040]  just packing I might take a couple carloads of like kitchen stuff but yeah
[36:55.040 --> 37:03.160]  no it's packing I think it's just going through stuff just to freaking get stuff
[37:03.160 --> 37:12.120]  out and figure out what I'm not moving all right I'm gonna hit this dude let me
[37:12.120 --> 37:22.040]  let me kind of which one is that what's the Hanalei dude that's Hanalei yeah
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.040]  I'm pretty sure cuz it's not the fruity one it's the one that smells more like
[37:28.040 --> 37:33.880]  like chemically or is that weird so there are two Hanalei's and yeah one of
[37:33.880 --> 37:39.560]  them is not okay here's the more sativa one yeah where's the no I'm smoking the
[37:39.560 --> 37:45.400]  sativa one so yeah what is your take on that smell I have my own my own opinion
[37:45.400 --> 37:51.880]  what do you think about that one I mean it's it's kind of train wrecky there's
[37:51.880 --> 37:57.280]  some terpene lean in there I don't know you know me with those weird turps like
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.240]  I like it like you know it's not it's not something I'd want to smoke every
[38:01.240 --> 38:09.960]  day but I do enjoy smoking those you know yeah turp turps so what I get is
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.080]  like I get underlying guava from all of the Hanalei's right no matter what it's
[38:15.080 --> 38:25.320]  like guava with this or guava with that so like this pure the pure okay so this
[38:25.320 --> 38:30.120]  one that you're smoking I get like a guava jam I get a little bit of sour
[38:30.120 --> 38:36.520]  cream I get like almost like a guava pie I get like this pie like it's almost
[38:36.520 --> 38:44.640]  like a like almost savory guava where it's like sweet and savory and with the
[38:44.640 --> 38:49.240]  guava smell to it and I was I was just in Hawaii a little while ago so I bought
[38:49.240 --> 38:56.080]  like a bunch of guava turps so I got like guava soda guava nectar you know
[38:56.080 --> 39:00.320]  like all guava jelly like all these different things so I could like really
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.080]  like get a chance to like get to know what that flavor was cuz I mean you
[39:05.080 --> 39:08.880]  don't really get that much of that you know what it smells like to me it smells
[39:08.880 --> 39:16.040]  like unripe mango skin like if you if you know what I'm talking about it has a
[39:16.040 --> 39:21.920]  very particular kind of scent like almost there's almost like peppery in
[39:21.920 --> 39:32.240]  there but it has some terpeneleum and it definitely has that weird kind of like
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.920]  what is it acetone like paint thinner kind of back notes there's like a
[39:36.920 --> 39:43.800]  chemical like something's off gassing you know but definitely it's like to me
[39:43.800 --> 39:49.200]  it's mango skin unripe mango skin but I see where you could get the guava out of
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.960]  it too because something about mango guava papaya those tropical fruit kind
[39:53.960 --> 40:03.200]  of realms really kind of weave in and out yeah grasshopper warned me about
[40:03.320 --> 40:12.760]  that stuff and also like it's not a typical city of a high at all I mean
[40:12.760 --> 40:17.760]  it's a pretty it's a pretty it's like I'm the stronger side of the Indica
[40:17.760 --> 40:25.160]  house but I mean he's like yeah like he I went to kick it with him he rolled up
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.400]  like a half joint of that and was like he's like mm-hmm yeah this is what I
[40:30.400 --> 40:35.120]  like to smoke you know and I'm like dude I don't even smoke this stuff that
[40:35.120 --> 40:47.320]  much like it's yeah I mean that's heady I've always thought that his Hanalei was
[40:47.320 --> 40:53.200]  pretty magical though like it's it's not it's you're not gonna find stuff like
[40:53.200 --> 40:58.440]  that in a dispensary period like that's you know unless your dispensary is like
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.720]  grows heirloom cultivars you know stuff that like actually takes longer than
[41:05.720 --> 41:12.480]  nine weeks you know but here's the not like the weird thing is like also
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.320]  morning Dalton um the weird thing is like when you flower it indoors it
[41:18.320 --> 41:25.160]  doesn't take forever and flowering it outdoors I cut it down before the end of
[41:25.160 --> 41:32.400]  October so it's not like like I was yeah like I was a little confused you
[41:32.400 --> 41:36.240]  know I mean I was like well you know I mean I was getting trying to get some
[41:36.240 --> 41:41.920]  advice like it looks like it's ready but you know I'm assuming that this plant
[41:41.920 --> 41:51.720]  needs a lot more time to go and you know it was it was where it needed to be yeah
[41:51.720 --> 41:58.440]  it finished it finished I don't know October 20th or something like yeah I
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.760]  mean this year by like the start of November I don't even know if I had any
[42:02.760 --> 42:07.400]  anything that was still like out there like any of like the original plants I
[42:07.400 --> 42:10.880]  think everything had basically been cut down okay
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.000]  hmm so yeah I mean it you know it is a sativa but it also does have some
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.080]  indica traits to it and I mean the main one I would say is that effect like it
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.400]  is potent maybe they're all sorts of tevas that are potent like that that is
[42:28.400 --> 42:34.240]  oh nice level also I think it needs to cure a lot more I think that the cure is
[42:34.240 --> 42:39.720]  not I think you know it has the turps that it you know it's no would have like
[42:39.720 --> 42:49.520]  another month to oh speaking of the devil speaking what's up grasshopper
[42:49.520 --> 42:56.480]  good morning tomorrow good morning everyone good morning Huey morning yeah
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.680]  how you guys doing today we're well I'm happy to be talking with my friends on
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.200]  this podcast that's great I'm happy to be talking with you guys as well I'm
[43:07.200 --> 43:13.080]  being a part of it awesome you know I'm gonna stop my cam for two seconds but
[43:13.080 --> 43:20.800]  I'm gonna be here in the conversation yeah I mean I so I went over to your
[43:20.800 --> 43:28.160]  house and I got a chance to experience that and I thought that that was a
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.680]  really interesting smoke I think that that is the kind of stuff that people
[43:32.680 --> 43:36.880]  who listen to this show would be really interested in what was that tomorrow I
[43:36.880 --> 43:41.160]  was saying that when I went over to your house and I smoked the Durban Hanole
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.000]  I thought that that was really interesting and that's the kind of thing
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.080]  that people who listen to this particular show would be interested in
[43:50.080 --> 43:57.600]  hearing about you know it was very land racy but still you know solid bud it
[43:57.600 --> 44:05.480]  smoked up it you know had good effect it was really interesting herb yeah I
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.920]  agree it's some interesting herb yeah it's nice for me it's not as strong as
[44:11.920 --> 44:19.040]  the Hanole but it was pretty good and both both the licorice pheno and the
[44:19.040 --> 44:26.040]  anise phenos they were interesting yeah and you're saying basically there were
[44:26.040 --> 44:32.120]  there were two phenos I think I only smoked one that anise one is the greener
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.560]  one with the tinier buds that people have been selecting away from is that
[44:36.560 --> 44:44.440]  correct yeah exactly that's the yes more golden as opposed to purple yeah and
[44:44.440 --> 44:47.560]  that's the one that you know there were two plants hanging up there in the
[44:47.560 --> 44:51.640]  garage and that's the one that when you got here that one was already stripped
[44:51.640 --> 44:58.040]  down that's the one that we all smoked off of and you know so for me I was
[44:58.040 --> 45:03.600]  always drawn to the the honest side of it you know it maybe it's because you
[45:03.600 --> 45:07.240]  know I experienced so much of the licorice side of it in all the hybrids
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.040]  that are circulating today and those are in all the Durban poison hybrids that's
[45:13.040 --> 45:19.320]  the licorice that's that's what I would yes I would say here and I mean that was
[45:19.320 --> 45:24.640]  the one that I smoked was a licorice and it was still like it was still very
[45:24.640 --> 45:36.000]  interesting and like I noticed right I was like a really large hit of it and I
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.080]  guess like the smoke wasn't very like harsh on my lungs at all like you could
[45:41.080 --> 45:48.960]  really like hit it hard and blow it out I don't know that's what I remember I
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.680]  recall that I thought was an interesting trait from it yeah it has a
[45:52.680 --> 45:59.200]  smooth taste to it and smooth palate and in it it's not very aggressive and
[45:59.200 --> 46:04.960]  evasive it's pretty chill it's really chill it's you know it puts you in like
[46:04.960 --> 46:11.200]  I don't know what term I would use them like a mellow mood you just mellow out
[46:11.200 --> 46:19.520]  you're not feeling too sedated you're not feeling too racy you know I kind of
[46:19.520 --> 46:24.560]  enjoyed that part of it it was very chill unlike the Hanalei that kind of
[46:24.560 --> 46:30.720]  it's more soaring and yeah I was expecting I didn't know what to expect
[46:30.720 --> 46:38.720]  out of them I mean the Durban itself is a more land racy unhybridized thing so
[46:38.720 --> 46:47.320]  yeah I didn't know what to expect but I was drawn back by by how you know that
[46:47.320 --> 46:53.200]  the entire progeny just moved more towards being a more land-race type or
[46:53.200 --> 46:59.000]  more wilder structure type looking plant as opposed to the Hanalei you get a
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.080]  little more modern structure out of it so you know it also tells me that you
[47:05.080 --> 47:11.480]  know that the Durban's are pretty pure you know because they breed like a pure
[47:11.480 --> 47:16.840]  land race their dominance is held in the crosses you know it just yeah I think I
[47:16.840 --> 47:21.680]  said that before in the last podcast that they're so dominant even when
[47:21.680 --> 47:27.120]  pairing them up with with plants that you know the crosses for dominant traits
[47:27.120 --> 47:38.200]  still it knocks those shit go right over them yeah if you notice that flower
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.160]  that you got there was no you could not really recognize they could probably
[47:42.160 --> 47:50.720]  give it to someone I said this is Durban do you agree with that sentiment or I'm
[47:50.720 --> 47:55.240]  sorry sorry can you rephrase that again right that the flower that you had got
[47:55.240 --> 48:00.840]  for me yeah it looks like pure Durban it smells like pure Durban you couldn't
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.680]  really identify Hanalei traits in it yes yes yes yes I yeah I didn't get any like
[48:06.680 --> 48:12.560]  any of the guava or any of the stuff like the terpene leaner yeah yeah it
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.680]  really took it so that's that's why that's the unique thing about the Durban
[48:17.680 --> 48:24.280]  and it's a pure one and it breeds that way so basically just turns everything
[48:24.280 --> 48:29.880]  into Durban turns everything into Durban even the things that you know even like
[48:29.880 --> 48:34.800]  I feel like even the things like tangy and stuff like that that carries through
[48:34.800 --> 48:41.000]  into multiple out crosses you know pairing it up with someone something
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.320]  like the Durban yeah even the Durban might overshadow that thing so that's
[48:46.320 --> 48:53.480]  funny it sounds like that your Durban is kind of like Bodie's 88 hash plant g13
[48:53.480 --> 48:59.400]  exactly you're not gonna get away from it whatever you breed into that like if
[48:59.400 --> 49:05.640]  you use the 88 g13 ash plant as the dad like anything with that in there it's
[49:05.640 --> 49:10.720]  that's just gonna be the dominant of everything so yeah way that I mean
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.520]  that's that's actually you know cool in a way for breeders at least you know you
[49:15.520 --> 49:20.240]  have a strain that's dominant and it's gonna do this you know what you're
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.600]  getting into what about what if like you were saying that the Urkel Durban
[49:25.600 --> 49:30.720]  was really it was really nice which what made that one different hold on did you
[49:30.720 --> 49:40.080]  see my head just go Urkel Durban you got some Durkel Durkel and that's a cool name
[49:40.080 --> 49:50.080]  too yeah the difference in those plants is you get a more modern structure from
[49:50.520 --> 49:58.640]  those plants and you get an earlier flowering plant and yeah and it kind of
[49:58.640 --> 50:05.360]  you get it takes the Urkel is a short squatty indica type thing that flowers
[50:05.360 --> 50:11.400]  really early so you know pairing up with that you know there was some you had
[50:11.400 --> 50:18.920]  some of that indica vibes that carried on and still though very Durban plants
[50:18.920 --> 50:27.480]  from you know when it comes to turps and stuff like that very Durban and
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.840]  you get a better flavor out of those you get a more you know more grape added
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.160]  from the Urkel that comes through with the Durban but mostly Durban still I
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.680]  mean there's not much to really say about the Durban when it comes to the
[50:42.680 --> 50:46.400]  out crosses you're gonna get Durban the structure I could speak to the structure
[50:46.400 --> 50:53.080]  a little bit well because you know I use the Durban males you know you have
[50:53.080 --> 51:00.760]  a more Durban structure plant especially with the Hanalei but with the with the
[51:00.760 --> 51:07.800]  Urkel it kind of you have this weird early looking type sativa that is the
[51:07.800 --> 51:15.360]  bud structures are more modern but the plant don't look very modern per se you
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.320]  know because this have all of these longer thinner leaves and but you know
[51:21.320 --> 51:26.640]  the finished product is yeah it has a better bag of peel for sure than the
[51:26.640 --> 51:42.360]  Hanalei's Durban. How is the smoke? That one that one had a more I would say a
[51:42.360 --> 51:47.400]  little more aggressive onset with the smoke as far as the Hanalei Durban
[51:47.400 --> 51:52.200]  they were more chill a bit more mellow like I was describing that as being like
[51:52.200 --> 51:59.520]  more mellow mood type stuff but with the Indica crossed into it
[51:59.520 --> 52:08.120]  you had a more body effect you had a more sit down and kind of spaced off by
[52:08.120 --> 52:12.640]  halfway the joint you know so that's that's what I experienced from from that
[52:12.640 --> 52:16.960]  side of it and there's a whole bunch of crosses I made with that Durban I
[52:17.600 --> 52:23.720]  shared you know shared a few with a couple friends and get a few samples to
[52:23.720 --> 52:29.440]  look at and but there's a whole bunch of them there's Brunce by Durban, Jealousy
[52:29.440 --> 52:42.680]  Durban, Larry's Bread Durban, the usual, Mangos by Durban, OG's by Durban
[52:42.720 --> 52:47.400]  yeah so you know I just do I just you know like I normally I would do
[52:47.400 --> 52:51.920]  preservations and at the point of preserving and refreshing the Durban's
[52:51.920 --> 52:58.240]  we'll throw some stuff in there and let it happen. I gotta say one thing real quick
[52:58.240 --> 53:06.160]  we smoked your Hanalei before you jumped on and I feel that stuff dude like my
[53:06.160 --> 53:11.480]  eyes kind of sunk back in the head in my head everything kind of took on a hazy
[53:11.520 --> 53:18.760]  view to it. It cut through all the other stuff? The psychedelic aspect of it and like I feel kind of
[53:18.760 --> 53:31.880]  stupid like my brain is somewhere up here. Oh yeah exactly. I'm watching myself but I'm not connected to you know like. Man that's what I did this morning too and yeah
[53:31.880 --> 53:37.640]  kind of like trying to keep my train of thought intact with that one. I'm gonna
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.200]  need some more of this because I want to smoke it with the kids at my barbecue
[53:41.200 --> 53:50.720]  spot and see how many of them check out. Yeah it's really you're here but you're not here but you're here.
[53:50.720 --> 54:00.640]  Which Fino are you smoking? I'm smoking on the you know what I had got from the from the
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.960]  original collection. I kept the Guava Fino and then I kept that other Fino
[54:05.960 --> 54:12.360]  that I don't even I can't even call it Jack I can't even call it train wreck
[54:12.360 --> 54:16.680]  but that's the one I was smoking on this morning. I think that's what we're
[54:16.680 --> 54:25.880]  smoking on I say. It smells like like paint thinner, paint remover. You know almost.
[54:25.880 --> 54:31.400]  It has a really and it's pungent and it carries through in the taste and you
[54:31.400 --> 54:35.200]  know all the way to the to the end of your joint you're still getting that
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.840]  nice flavor. It's really tasty. I enjoy it. I think you and I talked about this before.
[54:39.840 --> 54:47.120]  It's unripe mango skin. Yeah it's pretty you know it's with a little bit of
[54:47.120 --> 54:54.920]  sweets on there. It's pretty good. Yeah it's one of those ones. I don't even know what we were
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.600]  supposed to smoke next. Yeah it's one of those things man it's not the best one
[54:59.600 --> 55:06.200]  for the morning but it's a great sativa. With that Fino there that I'm smoking on
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.760]  that was the first one that I worked with because you know I popped some of
[55:10.760 --> 55:16.320]  this I opened some of the seeds first looked at and selected that one and then
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.720]  came back and selected the Guava later but that one is that one is amazing as
[55:20.720 --> 55:31.720]  well. And now that it's cured. Hold up a second. Yeah thank you. I mean thank you.
[55:31.720 --> 55:36.200]  Like it wasn't even Grasshopper it was me that said it. Oh and let me be clear
[55:36.200 --> 55:42.720]  when I mean kids I mean 20 year olds. I'm gonna be 50 in a few months. 20 year
[55:42.720 --> 55:50.320]  old is a kid to me you know like could be my kid you know like anyway so
[55:50.920 --> 55:57.600]  I mean from the time you say from the time you say kids at work. I know dude
[55:57.600 --> 56:06.280]  seriously I'm way too high to deal with that nonsense. But from the point from the time you say kids at work
[56:06.280 --> 56:13.000]  people should understand that kids don't get employed you know in certain aspects
[56:13.000 --> 56:25.880]  of work maybe a little summer job a little summer camp something. Anyway yeah I told you where were we?
[56:25.880 --> 56:32.600]  Yeah I mean we were just talking about different herbs.
[56:36.320 --> 56:42.840]  We were talking about the Hanalei and what that was like and yeah that's what I'm
[56:42.840 --> 56:50.040]  smoking on it's interesting. I still think you know it's something that people
[56:50.040 --> 56:56.200]  should experience you know. It's a sativa like that that puts you you know stimulate
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.160]  your thinking and put you in overdrive when it comes to thinking and you know
[57:00.160 --> 57:07.480]  you stay ahead of your yeah. Oh I had a thought this is what I was thinking. It
[57:07.480 --> 57:14.840]  would be interesting to put the most dominant genetics against each other.
[57:14.840 --> 57:27.440]  Dominant as far as? So as far as like like grasshopper you would throw your
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.400]  Durban which would be the most I mean I don't know whatever is the most
[57:31.560 --> 57:38.400]  dominant of the genetics that you have and then I would let's say throw some
[57:38.400 --> 57:48.800]  ADG 13 across and somebody else could throw like deep chunk to see who is the
[57:48.800 --> 57:56.560]  most dominant of them all. I'd be down with that dude I want some of that. You know what I mean just it'd be
[57:56.560 --> 58:00.160]  interesting because like we're like really what I'm saying is like that you
[58:00.160 --> 58:05.240]  know we're we're observing that certain traits are more dominant than others.
[58:05.240 --> 58:09.440]  It'd be interesting to see like when you take these the most dominant ones and
[58:09.440 --> 58:15.560]  put them at each other see what happens. I mean my thought on it is that my
[58:15.560 --> 58:21.960]  thought on it would be that you know rarely I mean from my experience and
[58:21.960 --> 58:28.040]  from what I see there you know I think Bowdoin have a special plant there. Most
[58:28.080 --> 58:33.200]  of the Afghanis and stuff when you pair them up with the sativas they sativas
[58:33.200 --> 58:39.600]  you know seems to breed even more dominant or override some of the
[58:39.600 --> 58:46.880]  indica's or most of the indica's. I mean for example look at NL5 Hayes you know.
[58:46.880 --> 58:52.320]  I mean like the NL5 Hayes is you know most of those plants are sativa dominant
[58:52.320 --> 58:59.840]  with the Hayes more Colombian terps on them.
[58:59.840 --> 59:05.360]  Yeah. So that's you know it would be like yeah I mean I would go further and say
[59:05.360 --> 59:15.760]  you know probably the two the two highest terps sativa put together and
[59:15.760 --> 59:21.280]  see where that take you and then you put two of the highest terps indica together
[59:21.280 --> 59:26.200]  you know and then see where that takes you because I feel I feel as if though
[59:26.200 --> 59:35.720]  like you know like for you know I still feel like a pure Durban is gonna
[59:35.720 --> 59:45.360]  transform a G13 hash plant. I mean just just honestly speaking that's from that's
[59:45.360 --> 59:49.280]  just my opinion from my observation with the way these sativas have been
[59:49.280 --> 59:55.880]  breeding. You know I mean both it makes a few different sativa indica hybrid like
[59:55.880 --> 01:00:03.520]  for example Dread Bread is one of them and it's a when you look at those plants
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:11.480]  they are just some huge sativa on steroids. You know that's what I'm saying.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.720]  You know they get chunky they get more dense but they have that look and they
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:23.440]  take a little bit long to finish and stuff like that so yeah maybe you know
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.640]  switching the males back and forth doing indica males versus sativa females and
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.520]  vice versa might find that some of them pair differently from a gender
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:45.240]  perspective. Yeah. You know. Yeah it sounds I mean I got a few things like that but
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.920]  with my experience it's like whoa you have things that you thought was always
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.560]  dominant in the crosses and whenever you bring in some of these land races and
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:03.400]  you strike them you're like whoa. You know the things that you thought was
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  dominant now you know it's a new understanding of dominance so yeah you
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:20.120]  know. That's awesome. New understanding of dominance. Yeah when you start to when
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:25.560]  you start to bring in sativa land races into your gene pool you know because you
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.280]  know I mean you if you're making hybrids you have some things that are yeah I got
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.000]  these hybrids that are mashing together and you know I could always put this
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.240]  with this and get cherries I could put this with this and get OGs you know but
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:45.320]  hey take those same cherries and those same OGs and pair them with a derman
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:55.320]  it's like oh shit you know so it's just a new understanding of yeah things that
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:03.720]  are even yeah I think it's the multiple gene versus fewer genes one two three
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.760]  maybe versus 10 20 genes that are you know has to do with the characteristics
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.600]  of these plants and it would make sense to me because if you have multiple genes
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:25.920]  interacting then you know this chromosome space they're smaller. Somebody
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:36.240]  is asking what are Colombian tariffs? Colombian you know I mean from what I
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:45.880]  understand I've tried different Colombians and if you look at Colombia
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:51.040]  there's different there's different herbs that come from Colombia you have
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:58.600]  you know the red the mango and then you have you know Santa Marta and different
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.560]  things like that which you know they have their different little unique taste
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:11.560]  in their own way but it's like from those strains you're not getting the
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:18.840]  more fruity turf you're getting more earth ammonia and and that kind of with
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:24.720]  little tints of berry here and there depending on what strain it is or lemon
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:32.880]  or citrus added to that earth it's not so much the sweet candy kind of kind of
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.280]  stuff that's what I'm when I say like if you look at hazes or anybody have
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.440]  experience with hazes it's very earthy ammonia like that kind of vibes that's
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.680]  what I'm talking about what I mean Colombian or Colombian turps if anybody
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.440]  smoke hazes you know Colombian ties equatorial sativas they kind of share
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:58.920]  very very similar turps across the board you know it varies a little bit you get
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.400]  a little bit of colors in some of them like throughout the Congo you know more
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.560]  into Thailand you get some of the similar Colombian turps you know they're
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.480]  not very off they're not off by very far it's like you know you're talking about
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:21.200]  like earthy sandalwood cedar exactly citrus some lime here and there yeah
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:29.640]  you know incense or perfume yeah yeah anybody that smokes anybody that uses
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.560]  you know used to ties or you say used to smoking Southern American Mexican they
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:41.840]  could relate to what I'm talking about I hope I did my best to explain to the
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.960]  people who can't relate or who don't have the experience with with those
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:52.940]  strings are there would you say there any modern strings that have any similar
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:05:05.220]  to a propose as those trains yeah I mean the haze is like I was saying Mac the
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:11.980]  hazes the might have some some some some of that in the background yeah you know
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:18.340]  you have the hazes you have the skunks what they refer to as skunks with some
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:24.820]  kind of bland it out a bland off that that sativa turps a little bit into a
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.500]  little more Afghani smoother palette but you know find that the skunks this con
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.380]  ones a lot of these different things that people are looking for to find that
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:40.940]  dead skunk smell yeah actually kind of just like a little more sweeter more
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:48.540]  appealing land-raised lemony and those are you know the skunks you know I don't
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.100]  know about roadkill and all that but that might be something that have been
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:06:02.980]  circulating in California prior to you know the the Amsterdam era but most of
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.460]  what came out of Amsterdam when it comes to skunk is just land-raised
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:14.580]  1976 1977 was the first release of skunk seeds on the California and I grew up my
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:19.220]  dad was smoking that stuff when I was a kid in the 70s late 70s early 80s and
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.820]  yeah I told him I don't want you to smoke cigarettes I want you to smoke the
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.020]  other cigarette and he was like why and I told him like because it smells like
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.900]  you ran over a skunk and I remembered you could always find where dad's stash
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:38.540]  was in the house you could not hide that stuff like anyway in three bags and
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:44.060]  in a jar you still knew like oh it's tucked behind that you know the their
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:51.300]  bathroom sink with like cleaners but you could still smell that shit you know
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:56.860]  yeah so that's kind of like it's funny these last couple years online I've seen
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:03.180]  a lot of people running various people skunk reproductions and stuff and I
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:07.780]  think for the most part everybody was thinking they were gonna find the road
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:15.500]  kill and they're just not yeah yeah finding that um you know anyone but you
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:19.740]  know I mean it's just like I think it's at one of those risks purely recessive
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.500]  genes that like you're just you're not gonna find in a larger population and I
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:29.180]  believe that like honestly probably came from the Afghani that they bred out
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:34.740]  of it when they took it to Amsterdam you know when Sam sent the stuff over you
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:40.180]  know it was way more on the Afghan leaning but you have to understand in
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.060]  America at that time like we couldn't grow weed that smelled like that you
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.700]  know if you were growing the hill you could smell that shit a mile away you
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:55.580]  know I mean for me I like I said I have no no experience with roadkill skunk but
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:02.140]  the European skunks here I've seen those of you know I've seen a great skunk one
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:07.780]  back in the late 90s early 2000s I think it's the same one that that Duke and
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.980]  them work with because I had got it from Colorado the same time we got the cough
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:17.340]  what I had from Colorado was a skunk one from some super Sativa Club company
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:25.700]  I had the cough and Williams wonder and what else was it hash plant and it was
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:35.420]  one other thing that came from Colorado but um yes it's my experience with those
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:39.780]  as far as you know the skunks and that one was pretty sweet I could see where
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:45.900]  that one was more Afghani leaning early flowering but most of the stuff that you
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:50.980]  buy from census seeds and that came out of Europe as skunks and skunk ones and
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:57.140]  super skunks and ultra skunks they were pretty land-race it type smelling plants
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.740]  I mean what it seems like what was appealing back then was the discovery of
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:07.660]  terpenelein because that was the kind of like what drove the Jack era and you
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:13.820]  know that came out of those of those land-race hybrids so if you're asking me
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:19.420]  about a modern strain that has those terps yeah those those constant stuff
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:24.780]  right there and those hazes and those I'm sure people could relate to those
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:30.220]  because those people got their hands on them
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:35.860]  yeah like a David Brendan said earthiness is back well I think it's
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:42.900]  back for one reason is that sometimes the the best tasting plants aren't
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:48.980]  necessarily the most potent plants and you know it's a back and forth argument
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:55.740]  about the entourage effect of terpenes that mix with the different cannabinoids
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.980]  to create an effect but I will tell you what some of the best weed I've ever
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:10.420]  smoked in my life tasted like dirt and cardboard but like boy howdy like lit so
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:15.820]  yeah I think you're right but it's also that there's a lot of land races and a
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:21.140]  lot of these older land race you know like if you go and smoke like like say
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:25.020]  an African strain or something like that you know of some land race stuff it's
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:31.420]  not it's not you know fruit forward you know even a lot of the Indian stuff
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:36.740]  except for maybe like the lemon cashmere II you know you're not you're not
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:41.060]  getting those like in-your-face turps like we're getting now because of
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:46.540]  selection you know so yeah I think there's a resurgence in land race and
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:53.940]  that's one of the reasons why those flavor profiles are bad you know people
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.180]  are it's like that literally it's like it's like the 30-year wheel you know
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:06.300]  everything happens and seems like in 25 and 30 years clothing music weed you
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:13.020]  know so we're going back to that right now I think what's to me what's the most
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:20.180]  interesting aspect of the smell flavor is I find that that has for me the most
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:26.180]  predictability to be associated with taste or with effect so like I find that
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:35.340]  stuff that smells in certain ways I'm able to link that to certain effects and
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:40.980]  so that then when you smell something that has the baby poop or that has the
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:46.860]  whatever you can then be like oh this is the high that it gives me and I know how
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:51.740]  I'm gonna feel I really like that aspect of it so it's like that's why I was
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.460]  saying before like I don't really care what the smell is I just want to know
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:00.100]  what that smell what that effect is that's associated with that and that I
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:04.940]  can kind of you know pair those together because like honestly a lot of the like
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:14.140]  really tasty candy stuff that's loud gets me too sleepy and what's also
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.660]  interesting is as I get older I like smoking OG's and gas more and more and
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.900]  more that's just like what I find but when I was younger I felt like it wasn't
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.140]  really as much in the gas that just wasn't really my thing yeah when it
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:36.220]  comes to those on those older sativas and stuff I feel like most people at
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.900]  least in this hemisphere there this region don't really get to experience
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:47.140]  the true potential of those things because you know a lot of it is pre-judge
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:52.820]  a lot of it is not growing right a lot of it is not most of the time it's not
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:58.740]  finished yeah and people still enjoy it people still feel good about it and you
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:06.740]  know so and it also you know maybe that aspect of it is what kind of and you
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:10.940]  know the longer flowering about it as well but you know that can probably keep
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:16.260]  it from surfacing more often because you know there's different aspects of it
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:25.380]  that because you know like growing up in some place near the equator where
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:34.700]  sativas are done right and they're really left to their full potential those
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:40.140]  things when you hit one in the morning you're good you're good you're good for
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.900]  the day for almost half the day you know you're gonna have lunch you're gonna go
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.260]  you're gonna jump in the river you're gonna do everything and you're still
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:56.060]  baked so I feel like that's the missing link with why they're not getting the
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:02.500]  cloud that they should have or the reputation that most people remember and
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:11.780]  why can't really manifest itself these days is because you know I mean I get it
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.660]  dude it's like people say they got the Hawaiian around here I've smoked some
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:24.900]  and it wasn't nearly as good as the Hawaiian that I smoked in Hawaii in like
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:35.380]  87 88 you know it was like that stuff lit me like two three it's like which
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.700]  goes to the whole land-based thing like don't be trying to grow something that's
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.700]  acclimated for that environment and you're gonna grow it in Sonoma Mendo or
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.140]  humble and think you're even gonna get the same results because you're not like
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:56.860]  unless you're literally reproducing that biodiversity that you have in that I
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:02.740]  think I'm the terroir of where it was originally grown you know I think when
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:08.420]  when cannabis goes global I think that's when that's gonna be a part of the
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:13.220]  experience because it's gonna open up for imports and we can actually import
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:19.420]  these things from the region that you know from their homeland and actually
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:25.020]  and then I think that's you know that's also why you know a lot of the older cats
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:31.340]  and Kilo including myself reminisce on the old Thai stick or the old Colombian
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:36.940]  or you know because it was done right and when you get it you look at it you're
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:42.780]  like yeah this just look like a bunch of little calyx put together but whoa
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.940]  you know for for a sativa calyx to actually or calyx or brax or whatever
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:54.780]  people want to say for those to get really swollen and be the size of a
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:16:02.380]  indica looking one it takes some time yeah you know and you know it would
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:09.260]  sativa is in my experience I've seen some of the biggest brax on you know but
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:15.420]  not the ones here but you know the ones that are homegrown in their home in
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:23.300]  their origins those are yet some brax look like big as a teardrop like huge
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:31.060]  huge brax and when those cluster together then you kind of have an
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:36.540]  understanding of what you're dealing with and for whatever reasons most of
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:43.980]  the flower that you get back then that was really really heavy and smoked
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:47.700]  really good it seemed like the trichromes wasn't white it wasn't amber
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:54.020]  it was golden brown you know so it seemed like the plant they were they
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:59.420]  were allowed and left to their own to finish properly I could remember those
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:03.340]  you pull the leaves off and you have this thing that the trichromes look
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:09.020]  fuzzy it looks like grizzly bear it's just this red brown rust and you would
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.620]  think that you know and as soon as you put that in a piece of paper you fire
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:20.220]  that up oil start dripping out the end of that paper yeah yeah then that's what
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.820]  those are the ones that I know you don't see that no more you don't even see a
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.980]  paper color up when you light a spray but I could remember you know smoking in
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:35.460]  big bamboos which is thick like a almost like a printer's paper and you
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.380]  know you color that out make that real gummy and tarry and real quick you
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.620]  don't see that anymore I feel like all that has to do with the plants are not
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.900]  growing properly and enough left to their full potential no you know it's
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:55.860]  that was the one thing that you know Tom Hill talked about like resin
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:01.380]  reduction yeah resin on your teeth from the end of from it from the tail of your
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.500]  spliff you got big dark resin spot on your teeth or on your lips oh shit you
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:12.100]  put it you put it to your lips and you try to pull it oozes out just resin I
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:18.940]  mean you don't see that no more I haven't seen that in a long time but as
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:24.700]  you know growing up that was where was what it was oh yeah I hear people a
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:30.340]  couple of the commenters yeah environment is a huge huge you know
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:35.500]  play in that sort of stuff like even even indoor like you know from one
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:41.500]  person's garden to the next it's like we've seen some amazing Jamal and I have
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:48.540]  done like side-by-side runs indoor outdoors yeah environment in that like
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:52.780]  that's one of the things I actually was gonna touch on is like a lot of people
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:59.700]  buy these land-raised cultivars and you know they run them wherever you're at
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:06.660]  you know I mean people trying to run a highland freaking Indian strain in Maine
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:13.900]  you know you know unless you like up in the Himalayas that ain't really gonna
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:18.780]  work so if you're wondering why it didn't smoke like what you've seen it
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:23.180]  somewhere else because your environment is totally different you know we've we
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:28.620]  I know we've looked at like you know trends and stuff before we throw land
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:33.340]  races outdoors you know to see like all right you know what's the relative
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:37.380]  humidity of this place what are the highs and lows throughout what are the
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:41.180]  nighttime temps average what are the daytime temp average and if you're gonna
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:45.300]  grow outdoors with the land race try to get something that's more suited to
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:50.300]  where you're at you'll have much better chance of it producing something viable
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:57.860]  you're gonna want to smoke you know and also I mean like I would I would add that
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:05.140]  like you know that you just have to be open to the experience and to have as
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:11.540]  little expectations as possible at least that's what I try to do is it's less of
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:19.500]  a like I'm I'm growing sour diesel and I want sour diesel but you have the day
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:24.420]  to smoke and more of like okay I'm gonna grow something that I have no idea what
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.340]  you know I have no idea how it's gonna react in my environment I'm just going
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:37.500]  to observe and I'm going to observe and learn and you know take notes about how
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.660]  this plant may be different from these other things that I'm growing and just
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.780]  take notes on those types of things and hopefully you know you take clones and
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:52.180]  have you take clones so that it's something that you can rep replicate I
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:57.260]  guess is the term so that you can basically learn from it and it's it's
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:01.420]  less of a like I'm growing this from A to B to get cannabis and more of I'm
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.740]  learning and going through this process because through that process you'll be
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:11.580]  able to learn how to grow much more weed you'll be able to breed and be able to
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:16.140]  just identify a lot more things than if you just grew clones your whole career
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:23.260]  so for example I had a friend that we grew from we started growing and we
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:27.140]  grew from clones for years we'd never been a pop the seed for I don't know 10
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:32.620]  years those 10 years of me growing I'd never grown conceit ever it's just
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:37.860]  always rock wool maybe some cocoa we grew from clone that's just all that we
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:42.820]  did that was our whole perspective on growing period that's just like how we
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.940]  did it and it worked and you were good at it and that's great but like if you
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:53.260]  then threw in like a 13 weaker like we that wasn't within our purview or then
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:22:01.660]  if you threw in I don't know like certain plant diseases or pests we just
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.700]  didn't really know how to deal with those things because we knew how to do
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.900]  what we could do but when you jump into these you know heirloom strains these
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:17.260]  more base things it really forces you to understand more the plant as a whole and
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.900]  it lets you kind of able to discern a lot more different things in these
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.820]  plants because like when you learn a certain cut I mean a lot of people here
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.740]  I'm sure would notice that like when you learn a certain cut cuts are very
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:33.660]  certain cuts are very particular and so like certain things like let's say sour
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:39.100]  diesel or cookies or OG kush those plants you would all grow in a different
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:47.540]  way you flower them at different times way more food than others and you know
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.580]  in growing these different types of strains that helps you understand how to
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:23:01.740]  grow both the whole and they're great to breed with obviously so so yeah yes
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:08.180]  Huey I mean I agree with you that you're not going to get you know you're not
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:15.100]  going to get what like I grew some Burmese and the Burmese I grew two years
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:22.180]  ago did not come out anything like any Burmese in Burma it was because it took
[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:25.540]  20 weeks to flower and I was doing it outside it just wasn't the environment
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:30.060]  for that did I learn a lot from that definitely you know what I mean did I
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:36.780]  learn how to flower a lot flowering stevism how to control the various sizes
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:42.460]  you know all these different aspects of it yes I learned a lot so it's like I
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:47.020]  might have learned more than if I grew a blue dream plant in its place and just
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:52.740]  healed it out and got some smoke could you imagine running a Burmese this year
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.700]  when we got those early frosts in the morning you know and everything was just
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:05.860]  covered in like a little slushy you know where I live everything was fine but it
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.940]  all comes down to the smoke test and it's like those bags of weed of that
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:17.380]  stuff that I took a really really long time did not get smoked and for me
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.820]  that's like the ultimate test it's like okay if the bag was not smoked that year
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:27.580]  I'm gonna move on and grow something else because you know what's the point
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.980]  of me growing it if it's not getting smoked if nobody is getting it like to
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.460]  me that says oh this is something that was not chosen you know this wasn't a
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:42.500]  keeper female let me add to that Jamal please let me add to that by saying that
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:51.300]  um Sativas they're cool with cold nights but one one suggestion I would make is
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:57.540]  if you're doing like more Sativa dominant stuff land races stuff indoors
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.340]  you know you do the cool nights after your flowers develop and you have
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:10.260]  visible trichrome development and stuff they don't like cold nights so you know
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.980]  even with the season that we have here the temperature dropped really low at
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:19.700]  night sometimes in the 50s and 40s and they don't really like that so much so
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:24.820]  the whole metabolism the whole metabolics just stop for a few hours of
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:30.180]  the day in those plants as well so that also kind of slows them down from getting
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:38.420]  to full potential in the estimated time that was probably when you bought them
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:45.620]  they say 16 weeks yeah but you know you have metabolic stop for a few hours
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:49.300]  every day so you could just do your calculation and add on a few more weeks
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:57.460]  and just that kind of stuff so my suggestion with Sativas indoor they
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:01.700]  don't do really great outdoor because the cold nights is one of the factors that
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:08.180]  they don't really appreciate I could agree with having cold nights later into flower yeah
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:17.700]  but indoor yeah I would run them you know 60 70 degrees at night as opposed to dropping
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:23.220]  the degrees so far at night into flower and then drop it more later into flower
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:32.660]  so like what I guess like what would be like a practical how long of a flowering Sativa
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:36.820]  would you recommend grasshopper for people to grow outdoors so kind of like what I'm saying
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:44.340]  is like like like a plant that would go let's say 13 weeks indoors or or compared to something
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:51.140]  that would go like 20 weeks indoors well I mean I mean when you're talking about outdoors I would
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:57.620]  outdoors I would look at you know the outdoor seasons the cold nights and stuff like that you
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:03.780]  um like when it comes to Sativa you want a plant that when the nights start to get really cold
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:11.460]  saying mid-September or whatever you want a plant that is have already have some kind of development
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:19.380]  going on you know if they're still like little snow cap popcorn looking buds all over it and
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:23.460]  it's having cold nights more than likely that that flower is not going to develop
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.980]  you know but if you're doing one that have an earlier onset you know and um and stuff like
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:36.660]  that so that by the time you come around to the end of September into October when the nights are
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:43.300]  really getting chill then you're more focusing on you know trichrome development because you
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:51.220]  already have something to develop those trichromes on you know does that make any sense
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.500]  you're saying it's not about how many weeks it takes to flower but like what its trigger point
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:07.860]  is I mean yeah I obviously I mean I would not try to grow uh you know anything above 16 weeks
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.740]  in Northern California I mean because then it starts pushing you into December
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:19.860]  and even into November it's already struggling it's a thin margin at that point you're just
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:26.660]  scraping it at that point yeah um so I would go for the ones that are even earlier end of October
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:32.820]  the 12 weekers the hazes the you might stand a better chance with those yeah you know the
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:41.140]  the sativa hybrids per se yeah but pure sativas you're almost bound to just have an experience
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:48.980]  that was not to its full capacity yeah no for sure I mean I noticed like for for my garden
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:55.700]  in November there's just not that much light you know what I mean like the light quality is so much
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:02.580]  worse and you're like you know they're just like going into to where you want them to be
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:11.540]  exactly yeah so that's what I would suggest let's go ahead even no level playing field
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:18.500]  yeah you can grow giant sativas like down in North County San Diego like if you're a little
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:26.020]  bit inland from the coast like I've seen plants taller than a than a gabled one-story house
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:32.260]  that had to be like done down and it just seems like a lot of stuff because the it's it's more
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:39.300]  stable um environment you have a little more coastal influence but it's not cold air that's
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:47.780]  the thing you know the three of us are are in and around the SF Bay Area you know I mean these guys
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:54.740]  live like 10 10 miles north and 10 miles south of me but like even though like our climates
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:01.940]  are totally different from the micro regions around here um also like I would want to jump
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:10.100]  in and say like realistically like because you know like like we're growing on these huge farms
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.380]  each house is its own microclimate you know what I mean each garden is its own microclimate because
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.820]  everybody's garden is very specific to like you know their location in the sun and the
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:27.140]  environment and everything so it's like you know what I mean like you know like whether you're up
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:31.860]  in the hills or down by the water because you know like Berkeley is a tough place to do it
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:40.340]  yeah only my neighbor could grow really big plants but they never got like over six feet tall because
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:46.500]  we don't get heat you know we never got heat here but you can't grow you can't grow peppers
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:51.860]  and you can't really grow good tomatoes here you know outdoors yeah especially if you're
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:56.900]  you're in the hills it all depends on what side of the hill you're on you're on the south side
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:02.340]  south side you fared out pretty good I mean northeast I'm only gonna be here for another
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:09.140]  week but like shit don't break another pipe damn it um I broke my favorite pipe at Jamal's house
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:16.660]  last night I got too high uh but no like where I'm at in Berkeley for like the next week um I mean
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:21.540]  there's nothing outdoors right now but I'm right in that that gulf stream that comes in right through
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:29.060]  the bay inlet so like all that that cold air that's pushing against the hot comes right to my house
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:34.580]  like if you look like when shit gets fogged over you can literally see the stream coming in from
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:40.660]  the Golden Gate Bridge towards my house you know and so it's like it's I'm the whole time I worked
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:46.660]  at Berkeley under a garden I don't recall seeing much good herb that came out of Berkeley
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:56.660]  it was always Oakland or you know Oakland San Leandro or elsewhere I'm moving to Oakland
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:03.140]  yeah it was always either north or south never never in Berkeley maybe in the hills
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:09.860]  maybe but I mean they would always show their herb and like it was always so disappointing and
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:14.900]  like you know it'd be like at week seven of like indoors so it was like
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:24.340]  you know almost there but not you know and they put in so much work and it was always powder mildew
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:31.380]  and like botrytis and yeah yeah it was just like man I felt bad for them and somebody else would be
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:36.500]  like out Contra Costa County and just like I just put it in the ground just watered it like
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:45.540]  boom and all frosty and chunky and just like you know I don't know that old man that lived out there
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:53.220]  in the Mount Diablo foothills out in Contra Costa man he grew some fire stuff outdoors you know
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:59.140]  yeah it's it's the blockberry that came from him outdoors was probably the best outdoor
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:04.500]  blockberry I've had out of anybody I've given cuts to so
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:12.660]  someone bitcoin is going zero yeah I almost posted a meme where my crypto bros at now
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:24.820]  um yeah any uh any projects that anybody would like to uh to bring up on the show
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:31.530]  I mean yeah but here here's a project
[01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:41.830]  when uh when you ask for a kind of something that you gave grasshopper this is what he gives you
[01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:51.190]  back man this is such a giant plant but I'm like thank you blessings man uh you're welcome
[01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:56.310]  this next year this forbidden sherbert I'm definitely going to be hitting
[01:33:56.950 --> 01:34:03.510]  this to a bunch of with a bunch of stuff because this this stuff is terpy as all hell and
[01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:10.790]  pretty good smoke for being a cookie hybrid you know like uh yeah thank you so I'm gonna
[01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:22.070]  be working with this this goes back in the rotation um otherwise like uh as I said earlier
[01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:29.830]  like I'm gonna be working with some hazes so like I know um I know you guys got projects going on
[01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:35.510]  like I'm gonna run some of your gear the original and the 15 year old stuff you gave me grasshopper
[01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:40.150]  are you gonna be testing any of your own stuff that you made I really need to because like I
[01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:45.110]  had to like because I'm moving I had to throw away like a whole testing run I just didn't want
[01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:51.190]  to move flowering plants um and to be honest I'm kind of at a point in my life and breeding where I
[01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:57.670]  just there's a lot of great stuff and like I just don't want to keep it all you know like I just
[01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:02.150]  don't want to be this collector so like I've gotten the things that I know they're provenly
[01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:09.910]  either I like to smoke them or I know that they they breed true you know um but otherwise yeah
[01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:16.710]  no I'm gonna run through some of my other stuff um those Kona sunset crosses I just made um I
[01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:24.630]  guarantee you the gelato 41 Kona sunset and uh the pure kush the pure kush like pure Kona
[01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:32.150]  that's there's great potential there so I want to like run through those just kind of see I'm not
[01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:38.790]  worried about stability issues but you know me like I always test and you know I'll stress the
[01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:43.830]  shit out of things trying to get them to herm well and I mean the THC bomb I think that's like a pretty
[01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:51.990]  unique one that's like kind of I need that cut back uh thank god for our our friends at
[01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:58.950]  at PCG that we can uh possibly get that back I think it's an underrated breeder I think if you
[01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:04.630]  have something that's out of control and you want to add like just a little sweetness because
[01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:11.430]  really the THC bomb just tastes like sugar you know it's like it's like cotton candy um it really
[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:18.390]  doesn't it's like the white without the mushroom turps you know um but it's potent as all hell
[01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:22.630]  and like a three foot tall plant you could almost pull a pound off of yeah it's super
[01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:28.950]  awesome it's a great great tent plant um I think as well that that one is like super underrated
[01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:33.270]  like it came out at a time when there was just so much good stuff it was like yeah this is the
[01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:39.270]  shit but like everything else around it is also awesome so like um have you ever worked with that
[01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:49.750]  one grasshopper teach them THC bum no I haven't I haven't I haven't it's an interesting one like
[01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:57.590]  it's like super super super frosty smaller frame plant but like even if it bred 50 percent of its
[01:36:57.590 --> 01:37:06.790]  frostiness it would still make plants frostier than average interesting um and I definitely
[01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:12.230]  think it had like a little bit of like the candy thing going on yeah there's no lab results on it
[01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:20.310]  oh what on the THC bomb yeah uh like lab is in like THC yeah kind of annoyed
[01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:27.350]  terpene profiles I don't know about the terpene I'm sure there is I'm sure PCG has that stuff
[01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:37.510]  locked away but um I know it tests in the um in the 30s like low 30s so and it's interesting
[01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:44.390]  it was bred it's actually a european right yeah bomb seeds out of out of uh England like it's one
[01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:53.030]  of the only European strains in the last 10 years that have kind of like um you know it's interesting
[01:37:53.110 --> 01:38:04.470]  to me it's it's an interesting plant um yeah thanks Peter um yeah I could uh yeah I have no
[01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:12.310]  experience with it but I was smoking some um some cherry pie purple unicorn f5s as well
[01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:19.430]  and those are interesting if you if you really like the the cherry dogs these are yeah these
[01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:26.550]  are amazing sweeter and more colorful of course but I think it's something that you guys should
[01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:33.430]  try as well the cherry unicorns are amazing plants I mean I popped a 10 pack and all the
[01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:39.830]  females were as amazing just like with the cherry dog you know all the females have potential to be
[01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:47.430]  commercially viable or they are commercially viable I see my experience with the cherry unicorns
[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:53.270]  and amazing smoke I'm just yeah the purple unicorn really transformed it kept all the
[01:38:53.270 --> 01:39:02.710]  cherry turps and gave it a really beautiful effect yeah and now now as far as future projects goes
[01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:11.110]  just trying to um gather a few elite cuts here and there and go back into I'm kind of digging
[01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:17.750]  the feminizing thing these days so I'm about to do a couple more feminizing or feminized
[01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:23.990]  seeds runs coming up next next year you know kind of got my hands back on skittles and
[01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:33.350]  and I also have a thing from from Lit Farms they call it ice cream sundae yeah my nephew
[01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:39.590]  yeah my nephew has got a pack of those and he brought me a cut from one of those this is pretty
[01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:47.990]  interesting I think it's grape pie with purple puff and gelato four to five pretty interesting
[01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:53.590]  as well so trying to do a little bit of work with those reversing a mango and some skittles
[01:39:53.590 --> 01:40:01.030]  that's what's on the agenda trying to revive but this this mango that has all this medicinal
[01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:10.870]  quality and such an amazing soaring heady indica that and you know head on body is so trying to
[01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:17.430]  make that available and I think it's very unique it's uncirculated it's really good genes
[01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:23.190]  I was thinking it'd be cool to mix that mango with the New York City diesel
[01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:31.830]  I did it in the past I still have seeds from like 16 14 years ago maybe but like I said viability
[01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:40.630]  it was amazing amazing it was amazing you had this you had this very citrus orangey kind of
[01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:46.230]  stuff coming out of there and I you know I'm kind of worried I mean I'm not worried but I'm just
[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:52.870]  optimistic about you know the mango because it's an old mango that I got
[01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:57.190]  KC Brains 2006 but it's my selection from a bag
[01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:06.150]  you know I see people using it and they're making papaya and they're making different things from it
[01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:13.430]  and I you know the closest I've came to something with any with papaya turps is when I cross
[01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:23.670]  tangy with mango that was the closest I came but so you know but I thought that you know those
[01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:31.110]  papaya influences was you know more coming from the citrus side of the tangy but I there's a few
[01:41:31.110 --> 01:41:40.630]  different people that a few different companies I see that are using mango and afghani and you know
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.550]  trying to make or they make things they call papaya and stuff like that
[01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:49.510]  I'm interested in putting it into the gobi
[01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:56.550]  you know because the gobi is another crazy afghani type plant and you know the mango is like
[01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:02.950]  it's a Brazilian Thai Afghani so you know bringing more Afghani influence and
[01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:08.870]  playing around with it a little bit but I think the mango crosses are
[01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:16.870]  it's something that's not in the mainstream it's yeah and I think people should experience it
[01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:21.750]  somehow or another whether it's the regular seeds or the feminized seeds and passing some around to
[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:29.350]  friends and family to see that's what I think yeah I recall I grew some mango cam last year it was
[01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:39.590]  potent some real medicine and the mango is real real medicine I mean that came from the medicinal
[01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:48.550]  era you know that's yeah yeah I mean it's all medicine I feel like all plants all of these
[01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:53.830]  plants have medicinal properties and qualities but you know some of them stand out more for
[01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:59.590]  certain things like you know like the CBDs and the charlotte's webs and stuff like that
[01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:05.750]  with epilepsy and you know and you know you have certain some strains that are really
[01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:13.590]  you know known for pain killing qualities and and I feel like you know the mango is
[01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:20.550]  one of those that really stand out for specific medical ills that's awesome
[01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:31.990]  hey grasshopper the blockberry does that too the blockberry takes away like my knee arthritis
[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:36.150]  like it's uh that's kind of why I kept that cut around
[01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:44.470]  yeah I mean I tried some of it outdoor this year and it's pretty good I see why you like it I
[01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:51.670]  understand why you like it and yeah it doesn't work in outdoor it's better indoor 100 percent
[01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:57.670]  uh but you know it still does its thing it still you know has the medicinal qualities it's just not
[01:43:57.670 --> 01:44:05.110]  as uh there's not as much as the grape dough with like the tangy back note you know it's pretty
[01:44:05.110 --> 01:44:14.550]  pungent um like you know coming down to the to the end of your your joint or whatever you feel
[01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:20.950]  like you're getting like you have a little bit of finger hash down there it gets really potent
[01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:27.830]  it has a strong flavor in the end like yeah yeah with that citrus stones in it
[01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:33.990]  I know I want to get the super booth cut to like compare side to side with my cut and that cut
[01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:41.110]  I thought you said he did before well I want to do it on my own you know like we have different
[01:44:41.110 --> 01:44:46.470]  we have different ideas of what's good but yeah evidently that's the super booth cut of
[01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:53.750]  blockberry was the most awarded strain of 2022 yeah I see it's getting some momentum
[01:44:54.470 --> 01:45:03.430]  so um yeah actually that's Jamal brought up what am I doing uh so Blockhead Buds the creator of
[01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:10.550]  Blockberry aka Super Booth um is a friend of mine and we're actually going to start trading pollen
[01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:17.110]  um this next year and do like a small collab um so that should be interesting
[01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:23.750]  you know he loves those cookies and frosties and grapes and all that sort of stuff and you know me
[01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:30.230]  I work more in like the strawberry diesel tangy haze realm so it should be kind of fun to see
[01:45:30.230 --> 01:45:39.030]  this mash of like genetics and see how they come out you know let me start my cam sorry I've made
[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:41.670]  my cat's been running wild I had to feed the little bastard
[01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:49.030]  that's awesome yeah what are you doing Jamal like what's up with you what's on your uh
[01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:58.150]  agenda this next next year um well I'm interested in looking into the stuff that I've already made
[01:45:58.150 --> 01:46:05.350]  so I have a bunch of Hanalei crosses that I'm you know I want to grow indoors I'm in the process of
[01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:09.750]  growing indoors and then I'm excited about starting to grow outdoors next year
[01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:19.990]  um so that's one one one thing I'm interested in I found a pretty cool Malawi wine so just
[01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:27.030]  the Malawi gold from Hazeman and those came out all extremely extremely frosty
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:34.790]  and I think that might be my big one of the big things I'm looking at doing for next year
[01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:43.270]  the plants are big and extremely frosty and from my
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:57.160]  sorry I'm hella blazed uh I've smoked Malawi in the past and it has a extremely awesome high
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:04.040]  extremely awesome high that was the reason why I was looking into getting Malawis
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.400]  is that my experience with them is that they have an amazing high that's extremely energetic
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:19.320]  positive and so then I bought some I made some breeding with them and the quality of what I saw
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.280]  I don't know if you saw those plants right I mean they were like super frosty I mean they didn't
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:30.280]  look like like a like a rough Malawi at all so I don't know if it's a worked Malawi line
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:37.880]  it's Malawi gold from Hazeman and you know that's you know what I'm gonna dig into so you know I
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:43.640]  made a shill of F2s I'm gonna dig into those in the springtime and you know see what the males
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.280]  bring flower out some females and smoke it and you know decide if that's something I want to work
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:55.400]  with. Of course like the Belucha stands I like for the club we'll be uh you know looking into those
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:02.280]  to see to see what's what's good. I mean Hawaii sustainable I'm smoking on the Hanalei by
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  pure right now by itself it's fire but I will tell you this uh the purple urkel Hanalei was
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:17.400]  something magical in everybody's outdoor gardens this year in around the Bay Area and uh yeah so
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.520]  I like that don't California our genetics don't worry they're being preserved as well but
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:27.800]  you know you got to look at something for what it is and realize that there's potential in
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.600]  in the crosses you know and if you curate your stuff like uh you know like the purple
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:41.880]  urkel Hanalei was was a great marriage of the two genetics um and and I would be stoked to
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:47.480]  run that sometime might make it a little more sustainable for me indoors you know
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:55.880]  nice Aili freebies need more to give out okay yeah yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah I'll
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:03.400]  I know I need to get on it Peter I know I've I see um so yeah I guess that's something interesting
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:10.680]  to um yeah I have a bunch of things that need to be tested so um I need to talk to Peter but
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:19.320]  you know I'm gonna start putting out a lot more seeds um for testing and for sale in the near
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:28.680]  future but yeah the purple crosses I'm super excited about as well um
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.480]  yeah we're all like hint hint grasshopper
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:41.880]  yeah but I mean I just finished with a um with a reversal of the flow right at OG
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:51.240]  onto the urkel um so that's my latest urkel digs right there um actually low in stock when it comes
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:50:02.840]  to their uh Hanalei, urkel Hanalei's but yeah well and yeah the um the urkel the urkel Hanalei's
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:09.800]  were a pretty special plant that we're also nudging grasshopper maybe to
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:16.840]  make again at some point because I think I think those some of those are on FCP right I think
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.120]  no I didn't get those up on there what we had there was urkel purple unicorns
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:31.240]  oh unicorns okay those are in super low um stock then yeah I didn't I didn't really get those up
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:41.560]  there sure but you know there's a bunch of other urkel crosses but yeah sure yeah I mean I think
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.680]  there's a lot of interesting stuff coming up this year I would you know just encourage people to
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:58.280]  um I don't know make crosses and you know do your do your work do the do your work to find the right
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:04.440]  things that you want to work with and you know because all you need is a 10 pack or a 20 pack
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:10.360]  and you can make whatever you need to make and you have this foundation you can build upon it
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:13.160]  and move in whatever direction you want
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:22.600]  yeah I feel like that's where the um where the where the road ends for most people who have
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:30.360]  passion for it you know that it just inevitably leads down that road to breeding to preservation
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:37.880]  to keeping the things you like and yeah so you know it doesn't matter I think you know um
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:45.240]  everyone have the potential it's not it's not magic it's not like some rocket science or something
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:53.560]  I mean you know people put things together and come out really good things yeah so I feel like
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:52:02.760]  everyone have the potential to it's not like some gifted situation some people are more skilled in
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:11.560]  it but hey it's nature it's just fostering nature really so anybody can do it anybody can
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:18.360]  make we all started that's how we all started I guess totally honestly you know even the
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.640]  most renowned breeder today was just a child and was ignorant to this plant
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:29.320]  and I would and I would I would encourage people you know if you're trying to grow these different
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:35.800]  types of things indoors and like in a tent to perhaps take a clone of your plants so that
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:40.280]  you know you can flower your plant a lot smaller at first if you're
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:45.640]  diving into things that you don't know how big it's going to be and not flowering out
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:56.360]  heirloom type of seeds indoors because that will make it make it easier yeah you could do this
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.480]  you could just do a shot in the dark or you could flower with everything and take clones and do a
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:09.000]  selective type breeding it's not a you know if you if you see something you like in your first
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:16.600]  flower growing you're like whoa like that got a clone of that oh and here's a matching male
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:26.040]  let me try it out yes you know for for people who are new today you know the community just
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:32.600]  wanted to share a little you know dive in don't be scared of diving in it's rewarding it's
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:39.560]  this love it's it's just yeah it's so much to take from it it just opens up your whole
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:47.800]  way of thinking you know you know suddenly it's like oh herbs are natural across the board
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:59.160]  in plants as well you know say it opens up the mind for for everyone yeah just just understanding
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:06.200]  the biology of the plant really you know it makes us understand our biology a lot better
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:14.680]  yeah yeah so and you know it creates love it creates harmony it fosters community
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:26.830]  you know so there's no reason to to not dive in and just go for it yeah
[01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:36.550]  uh pit hunter tell that to the people that just buy clones a bottle of reversal spray
[01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:42.070]  hit whatever to whatever it is that they bought never selecting the thing in their life but yet
[01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:52.630]  their breeder yeah that's cool too that's cool i mean you wouldn't really bread anything like
[01:54:52.630 --> 01:54:59.270]  honestly you just reverse something onto itself and that's super easy i mean there's the outcome
[01:55:00.230 --> 01:55:02.230]  you know i mean
[01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:10.390]  yeah not to be not to be controversial but you know i just think that the outcome yeah no you
[01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:17.350]  know you can slap a ham sandwich together you know exactly i mean i'd call it a whopper
[01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:23.990]  and i mean also like you know like the mechanics of
[01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:31.350]  doing a reversal are not easy and you do have to time it properly and it's kind of like not
[01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:36.310]  everything wants to reverse and you know yeah not everything wants to reverse and you know i mean all
[01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:43.430]  different kinds of things like that but like it it's it's not original but you know i think there's
[01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:50.870]  like a lot of different skill sets that come into it and you know it's it's it's not original
[01:55:51.190 --> 01:55:57.510]  that come into it and you know like people do just take one cut and hit it to another cut
[01:55:59.270 --> 01:56:04.950]  and find a lot of really good results so i mean i don't know it's i think it's something that
[01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:12.870]  i remember i remember those feelings when you don't feel fire doesn't make you a breeder just
[01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:19.270]  a seed maker there you go yeah i don't yeah i remember those feelings when you don't feel good
[01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:27.270]  or you feel like you don't know enough and it is not a good feeling so you know i would never try to
[01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:34.710]  have anybody who is just entering the space feel that way you know it's an experience and
[01:56:34.710 --> 01:56:42.550]  through your experiences where you learn so you know you just gotta go forward it's not a nice
[01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:49.430]  feeling to you know to go out go to people and try to offer something and they look at you like
[01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:56.230]  you're just some lost kid who don't know what you're doing and i think you know you never know
[01:56:56.230 --> 01:57:04.390]  the luck of the draw you know i mean most of most people find their their one unicorn in one simple
[01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:09.990]  outcross and then they build a whole genetic company off of that one little accident or
[01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:16.230]  whatever so you know i think we i think we're trying to take too much credit for nature
[01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:27.910]  yeah but i mean i also agree with you like i i think it's nice for the
[01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:34.070]  the faith in a male you know what i mean it's like you're putting the faith in something that
[01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:39.430]  you can't see that you're hoping it's gonna produce something nice from something else
[01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:46.070]  or people putting in that that work into a line to know it well enough to then grab a male from
[01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:51.430]  them i mean i do appreciate that you know and there you know what i mean and there is like
[01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:58.470]  all these different intricacies that were you know we're able to figure out from you know working
[01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:03.750]  lines in many different directions and you know like you working a line and you know gifting a
[01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:08.150]  line to me and then me working in and getting all the information as opposed to just taking two
[01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:18.070]  clones reversing yeah i mean we all of it comes with time you know yeah you know we have put in a
[01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:25.590]  lot of time and and you put in you put in the time and you do the dance you know you know at some
[01:58:25.590 --> 01:58:33.590]  point you know you will see some results you know i mean in the beginning you could have that
[01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:40.150]  you know first player's luck and it works out sometimes but a lot of times you know
[01:58:40.150 --> 01:58:48.710]  you go through it you learn you figure it out and yeah because i mean we could talk about the
[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:57.990]  selections of male often it does help it does help when people have this information but until you
[01:58:57.990 --> 01:59:07.990]  actually you know you it helps but you really get more from from going through it you know and
[01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:16.150]  then you're like oh that ring a bell that's what he was saying i get it you know so the information
[01:59:16.150 --> 01:59:21.990]  is vital but you know the actual practical part of it is but you know actually confirms all the
[01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:26.070]  information and then you store that information and use it to move forward
[01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:36.070]  like when mean gene says look for the og og male that smells like pickles and you're like what
[01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:45.430]  yeah and that's just your time you know it takes time so everybody gotta start somewhere
[01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:51.830]  and usually it starts with smoking and then growing and then you find something that you like
[01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:57.190]  and then you lose it and then you try to get it back and you realize it's not
[01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:01.670]  the same and you try to get it back again and you realize it's a different cut
[02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:07.510]  and then you're like hell no how is this gonna work out and then when it happens to you again
[02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:12.070]  and you find something that you like then you're like okay i gotta figure out ways to sometimes
[02:00:12.070 --> 02:00:16.710]  you keep the clones for a long time cloning and cloning it and because you like it and you keep
[02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:21.750]  working with it and this is your thing and then later on you try to figure out how you're gonna
[02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:29.110]  preserve it i just feel like it's a it's a thing that happens to all of us it's like it's not yeah
[02:00:29.110 --> 02:00:35.030]  this is by choosing no i think it's a calling as long as you're involved with it on that level
[02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:39.830]  where you're appreciating and there's things that you see that you appreciate that you wish you had
[02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:46.710]  nostalgic on those things it is like inevitably at some point this is where you're gonna be
[02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:55.830]  you know i'm saying so i i just feel like you know most people in the community that's the
[02:00:55.830 --> 02:01:00.230]  driving force why you see there's so much homebreeders there's so many seed makers there's
[02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:06.310]  people are you know opening up to the reward that's coming for it you know
[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:13.070]  i hear you just started but that was a lot
[02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:20.030]  it's good i went on a little tangent i've had some uh i've had some run-ins with people online that
[02:01:21.230 --> 02:01:27.230]  dude my like my my profile is private but it's like i'm on my second grow ever and
[02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:33.310]  i've grown better than you ever will okay whatever you know like
[02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:42.350]  like i mean you're gonna have those people as well yo uh i'm now on the congo uh the congo
[02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:50.350]  cashmere hash plan or whatever axis like i definitely went and picked this up uh out of
[02:01:50.350 --> 02:01:56.430]  the bag of nugs you gave me and uh which one the fatter one or the skinnier one more 88 g13
[02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:01.710]  looking nug okay and i had to like smell them all for a minute and like really look at it
[02:02:01.710 --> 02:02:09.470]  but i could i could definitely yeah this is a little different than what i smoked last night
[02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:17.150]  i think oh so a grasshopper the the more one of the ones that's slightly more sativa
[02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:27.390]  88g 13 your congo 88g 13 right here um it has like a garlic thing on it and it uh
[02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:35.230]  it really puts you out um it's extremely potent um
[02:02:36.990 --> 02:02:43.390]  yeah i was surprised that i was surprised at how potent it was man those about his hash plant
[02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:51.710]  crosses oh man everything that i touched from but i did his ogkb by 88g 13 hash plant
[02:02:52.030 --> 02:03:00.910]  ash plant oh man same way potent heavy and um which was the other one i also did his hollyweed
[02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:09.070]  his back in the day i did uh that's like i think it's tapanga canyon by 88g 13 and again
[02:03:09.630 --> 02:03:14.590]  really heavy put you to sleep type things like yeah medicine
[02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:20.990]  yeah i mean i was i don't know i guess like the way that it grew because it it has something
[02:03:23.230 --> 02:03:25.550]  i don't know it just has something to it where it's like
[02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:29.950]  you don't think it's going to be that's that strong that potent it doesn't look like
[02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:40.030]  you know what i mean at all yeah i do i do i know what you mean yeah the hash plant is
[02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:49.870]  is yeah so that's a hash plant thing man look at the look at that look at that um
[02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:54.190]  other thing that has that hash plant in it that you've been working with the black triangle
[02:03:55.630 --> 02:04:03.950]  yeah is that same kind of like whoa yeah you know yeah yeah yeah you probably forget forget what you
[02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:11.630]  go to the store for and shit like that yeah dealing with with with hash plant and ogs and crosses and
[02:04:11.630 --> 02:04:20.270]  so you come out the store with a shopping cart full of snacks sometimes it's not even a store
[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:25.870]  you go to outside to grab something you're like hey i come out here for you're like i want to get
[02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:33.310]  a target how'd i end up at home yeah that's those black triangle hash plant og crosses the board is
[02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:44.190]  kind of yeah that was his contribution so some heavy heavy yeah no it is it is some nice stuff
[02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:50.430]  it's nice and it has like a sharp like kind of like i don't know if it's like an oniony thing
[02:04:50.430 --> 02:05:00.830]  to it did you get one of these ones really yeah yeah it has it's very sharp um
[02:05:03.550 --> 02:05:08.270]  yeah it's good it doesn't have any of like like when it was alive this plant had like a little
[02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:16.110]  bit of like blood and metal kind of thing smell to it um but now it's just like kind of skunky but
[02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:24.270]  like oniony like it almost smells a little bit like a bagel like an onion bagel
[02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:33.250]  man i gotta i gotta run guys and thanks so much for having me i was gonna say i got way too high
[02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:39.330]  smoking all these straight yeah no no for sure for sure thank you guys for coming on um yeah i
[02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:43.650]  think we'll maybe do like five more minutes to wrap up today's show but yeah maybe i could you
[02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:51.330]  know i could come on another time and you know kind of do a little dive into the home grower
[02:05:52.290 --> 02:06:01.010]  do a little dive into the home grower kind of organic methods as opposed to you know um
[02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:08.450]  hydroponics we would love to have you on whatever so you know just talking about how to accomplish
[02:06:08.450 --> 02:06:17.170]  a decent flower in the growing organically it's um i think it's the it's the best way to go i mean
[02:06:17.170 --> 02:06:24.450]  i appreciate it all but most home growers are not going to set up an entire um drip system and
[02:06:24.450 --> 02:06:31.170]  take it in the whole reservoirs and everything but you know for the tent grower or someone who
[02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:37.650]  just do a little hand feeding and want to understand how the ph is and how it stacks in
[02:06:37.650 --> 02:06:46.370]  the soil and how to how to kind of like get a you know maintain a neutral ph without actually phing
[02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:54.130]  up or down your solutions and you know i think it offers for better terps and stuff like that so
[02:06:54.130 --> 02:07:02.930]  something maybe to share with the people at home heck yeah i'm totally for it however thanks so
[02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:10.610]  much man thanks peter and thank you to huey good to see you all right you guys have a good one
[02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:18.290]  see you soon at the meetup looking forward to it awesome thanks everyone uh listening as well
[02:07:18.290 --> 02:07:27.970]  you guys have a happy holidays absolutely um yeah thank you grasshopper
[02:07:28.770 --> 02:07:39.360]  so cool is there anything else that we need to so i guess you'll be coming on on the
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:47.040]  semi basis yeah i'm gonna try to make it on i'm gonna try to work uh work schedule around to where
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:52.800]  i can at least kind of be a fly on the wall i don't have to you know just be it'd be interested
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:08:01.440]  you know yeah nice um yeah i'm i guess i'll be this next year trying to get some more guests on
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:06.720]  try to plan a little bit more ahead so we can get a little better schedule
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.440]  i'm gonna try to get some more guests on
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:17.200]  i'm not gonna be doing five strain testings if you are going to stay on topic
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:24.800]  uh yeah you guys let me know if you like the the strain reviews like we can do more strain testing
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:31.760]  like this it is difficult the second hour after smoking i don't know six different kinds of weed
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:36.800]  i'm gonna try to get a little bit more time to get a little bit more sleep
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.760]  um
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  um
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:58.400]  um i'm trying to think if there's anything else i need to address um yeah hello peter thank you
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:07.520]  peter for uh you know always providing this you know solid um space for us to do this and i

[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:44.080]  genetics that you guys can get on daga um yeah i gotta get some of my stuff to jamal so
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:50.080]  yeah throw it up there too for under ailey yeah and they're all under ailey seeds um
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:56.080]  i'm trying to think if there's anything else yeah you know i'll see you guys i'm gonna try to do my
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:02.000]  best to be on every week you know beyond as much as possible with some you know some solid content
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:13.120]  and um yeah i hope everybody has a nice holiday um yeah it's it's tough to do all of this after
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:21.360]  smoking six different kinds of weed um that's the guy yeah we have some big stuff coming soon
