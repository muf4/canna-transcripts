[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  This is a fabulous event that is celebrating you, the collector.
[00:07.000 --> 00:17.000]  And the collector is the person that appreciates cannabis to such an extent that you really start,
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  you find really good bud and you're like, wow, this is fire.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  You pocket it, you put it in a jar, you save it for later,
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  which is not always the best, save it for later for a special occasion.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  And then when you meet up with a friend that you also appreciates cannabis,
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  and you show your friend and you share it and you want to say,
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  hey, I've got something amazing, let's crack open this and enjoy this cannabis together.
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  When I was purchasing cannabis the other day, I was, you know, craving something good.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  And you know, this is the funny thing about the industry right now.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  I go into the dispensary and I say, I just want really good cannabis.
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  And so the bud tender says, okay, do you want Indica, hybrid or sativa?
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  And I say, it doesn't matter.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  They go, hmm, that's kind of interesting.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  I don't even know where to start.
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  And then they go, well, you know what, this one's high THC.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  And I tell them that also doesn't matter.
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  And now they're really in a loop.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  They don't know how to help me.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  And I say, look, I'm just wanting something that is really, really smooth, burns nice,
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  has great flavor, and doesn't have any kind of harsh burn or any bitterness.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  And they're like, oh, I see, I see.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  So I ask them, what are you smoking?
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  What are you enjoying?
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  And then we may start going through the products that are good.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  But as you may relate, how many times have you purchased cannabis thinking it was going to be good,
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  you get excited about it, and then you smoke it and it sucks?
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  Like for me, I'm so picky that when I can't finish it and it tastes bad, I put out the joint.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  I just can't do it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  And then that eighth is goners.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  And sometimes you can't buy things in eighths.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  You have to buy them in halves or ounces.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  And you're just like, that was a waste.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  That's money down the drain.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  So we're trying to flip that so it doesn't ever happen because cannabis can be expensive.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  And we're in a state of the world right now where we can't be just blowing money on weed that doesn't burn well.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  So we designed the Collectors' Cup to really emphasize quality.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And I'll just go here.
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.000]  Oopsie.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  All right.
[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000]  And so this is all about how right now, butt tenders have it really hard.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  They are selling blind.
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.000]  They don't have the ability to, first of all, to afford buying all the cannabis available out there.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Never mind the lung capacity to smoke and try everything out there.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  And it's a really tough gig.
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  And that's why in this industry right now, it's difficult.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  I am seeing retail stores closing.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  I'm seeing butt tenders quitting, not wanting to be part of the industry.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  And that really hurts because the butt tenders are the most influential people in this industry.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  OK?
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  That's right.
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  You really are.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  But they right now are, for some reason, the least respected.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  They're the least paid.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  They're at the bottom when it comes to the way that wealth is being distributed.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Whereas we have the government, OK, that's taking a cut off of every single side of the supply chain.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  And then we have the producer.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  We have the marketers.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  We have the retailers.
[03:57.000 --> 03:58.000]  And then we have the butt tenders.
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  OK?
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  But the butt tenders are the key people that are influencing and truly helping consumers.
[04:05.000 --> 04:14.000]  So Counter-Ups is here to really help find a way to sell cannabis that goes beyond,
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  hey, what's in this bag?
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  I don't know.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  And I'm not allowed to open it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  I'm not allowed to smoke it.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  I don't have the money to do all of that.
[04:21.000 --> 04:31.000]  So how can we sell cannabis in a way that's compliant and that goes beyond Indica, Sativa, hybrid, and cannabinoid content?
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  OK?
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  And that's why we're all focused on quality today.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  This is the essence of a Bud Cup.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  So we're also layering in some butt tender games.
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  So if you haven't played them yet, I do invite you to do it throughout the event.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  And I'm just going to â€“ whoop, whoop, whoop.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  All right.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  So let me see.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Let me just go back here.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  All right.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  So going back to the importance of the butt tender, I was a butt tender.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  I worked in a retail store.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  This was pre-legalization.
[05:03.000 --> 05:12.000]  And during that time, I went through a huge identity crisis because I actually didn't use my legal name.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  I was using my maiden name.
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.000]  And I was going not by Julie Domingo, but Julie Nguyen.
[05:19.000 --> 05:30.000]  And I had to do that because I wanted to avoid the stigma from the previous professional network that I built in my career prior to cannabis
[05:30.000 --> 05:40.000]  as well as my family that may have been a little bit judgmental about my cannabis consumption, use, and never mind, my passion into it.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Some people literally don't understand.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  They're like, you do what?
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.000]  No.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Why?
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.000]  Right?
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  And they say, why?
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  Why'd you do that?
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  Why would you do that as a career?
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000]  Because I'm like, I'm truly passionate, and I want to see this industry thrive.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  And I hope that you're all there too.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  We're so passionate.
[06:00.000 --> 06:10.000]  A lot of people have taken pay cuts, professional, let's call them downgrades in terms of what you're doing as a job, just so that you can work in this industry.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  And you realize, wow, this industry is harder than I thought.
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  And how are we going to really push this forward?
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.000]  Well, there's just so much resistance.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  There's so much volatility in the industry, whether it's market force related or government regulations related.
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  Or if it is just hard, sometimes working with stores, it's a little tough.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  Like I said, we invited 130 people here today and half showed up.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  I can see more trickling in, but it's just rather interesting.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  The reliability is just a little, eh.
[06:42.000 --> 06:55.000]  So bringing back to what Collectors' Cup is all about, we are here to say, first of all, we're giving you an opportunity to look and examine really amazing,
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  really amazing quality cannabis so that you can understand the essences of what it means for quality.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  And I'm going to be going through all the quality parameters very quickly.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  And then, Andy, we lost the feed.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  There we go.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  So before we get there, I want to have a quick note to thank.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  Let's see here.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.260]  Oh, back, back, back.
[07:24.260 --> 07:27.260]  I want to give a quick thanks to our sponsors.
[07:27.260 --> 07:32.260]  They could not, we, this whole event could not be made possible without their help.
[07:32.260 --> 07:38.260]  So first and foremost, our gold sponsor, Dunn Cannabis, their station's out here.
[07:38.260 --> 07:42.260]  And they are, they get full dibs on the smoking patio.
[07:42.260 --> 07:46.260]  So thank you to them for bringing that on, making it come alive.
[07:46.260 --> 07:49.260]  The lobby, that's all Dunn Cannabis and Bazam.
[07:49.260 --> 07:56.260]  And then Embark, we have Marcus Richardson, which is one of the most influential people in the industry.
[07:56.260 --> 08:03.260]  And he's made a special exception out of his incredibly busy schedule to be here with us.
[08:03.260 --> 08:05.260]  So thank you, Marcus.
[08:05.260 --> 08:10.260]  He will be providing a keynote presentation later today, this afternoon.
[08:10.260 --> 08:13.260]  And we're super stoked about that.
[08:13.260 --> 08:23.260]  We have Sweetgrass as well, and where they brought some amazing flower that I'm very interested to see how it plays through this event.
[08:23.260 --> 08:28.260]  And Pistol in Paris, over here, they are part of the Wayne 8th game.
[08:28.260 --> 08:30.260]  Thank you, Pistol in Paris.
[08:30.260 --> 08:35.260]  As well as we have some beautiful art in the back.
[08:35.260 --> 08:39.260]  That is actually provided for your viewing enjoyment.
[08:39.260 --> 08:42.260]  And that's actually an artist local to here.
[08:42.260 --> 08:43.260]  His name is Grant.
[08:43.260 --> 08:46.260]  He works at La Canapa.
[08:46.260 --> 08:49.260]  And when I came to their store and I was just in awe.
[08:49.260 --> 08:51.260]  I just appreciate their art so much.
[08:51.260 --> 08:56.260]  So I welcome you to take a nice view and gander.
[08:56.260 --> 08:59.260]  They're unfortunately not for sale, but it's just for us to appreciate.
[08:59.260 --> 09:03.260]  And of course, Borrow & Beyond.
[09:03.260 --> 09:06.260]  They are providing some awesome prizes.
[09:07.260 --> 09:10.260]  Their pieces are made out of true quartz.
[09:10.260 --> 09:13.260]  Like real, all, the whole thing is quartz.
[09:13.260 --> 09:18.260]  So what that allows for is the more durability in your piece.
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.260]  So then it doesn't shatter and break.
[09:20.260 --> 09:26.260]  And there's some, this I would say is the gold standard when it comes to glass.
[09:26.260 --> 09:32.260]  And so please talk to Jeff and the team in the back there to check out some beautiful pieces.
[09:32.260 --> 09:35.260]  But like I said, if you're going to be playing in any of the Budtender games.
[09:35.260 --> 09:38.260]  And there's a couple of door prizes that we're issuing.
[09:38.260 --> 09:40.260]  And that is thanks to Borrow & Beyond.
[09:40.260 --> 09:51.260]  Last but not least, we have Canport Weed Pool and the RCCBC.
[09:51.260 --> 09:53.260]  Which used to be CamCD.
[09:53.260 --> 09:55.260]  Which used to be Acres.
[09:55.260 --> 09:57.260]  But just to get that clear.
[09:57.260 --> 10:01.260]  It's the Retail Cannabis Council for BC.
[10:01.260 --> 10:08.260]  And we are all here to help support and build upon the community.
[10:08.260 --> 10:12.260]  I also want to give a special thanks to the volunteers.
[10:14.260 --> 10:16.260]  This is an amazing story.
[10:16.260 --> 10:20.260]  When I announced that Collectors' Cup was coming to Vancouver.
[10:20.260 --> 10:25.260]  I had an inpour of people saying, hey, I want to volunteer.
[10:25.260 --> 10:32.260]  I actually got more volunteers to sign up than I had sponsors or guests.
[10:32.260 --> 10:34.260]  Like when I made the initial announcement.
[10:34.260 --> 10:37.260]  That goes to show the power of our community.
[10:37.260 --> 10:41.260]  And how much people really want to make it happen.
[10:41.260 --> 10:43.260]  They are taking the day off of work.
[10:43.260 --> 10:46.260]  They're not even playing or judging the cannabis.
[10:46.260 --> 10:50.260]  They're just here to help me and Sharon.
[10:50.260 --> 10:52.260]  Okay, you're looking at the Cannareps team here.
[10:52.260 --> 10:54.260]  Put this beautiful event together.
[10:54.260 --> 10:57.260]  So thank you so much, volunteers.
[10:57.260 --> 11:01.260]  The volunteers are certified cannabis sommeliers.
[11:01.260 --> 11:06.260]  And so they are also going to be guiding you through the quality grading process.
[11:06.260 --> 11:09.260]  To ensure that we find good calibration.
[11:09.260 --> 11:15.260]  And that our judgment is all within a reasonable range.
[11:16.260 --> 11:18.260]  Okay, so.
[11:20.260 --> 11:22.260]  I'm going to go through each of the Budtender games.
[11:22.260 --> 11:24.260]  Because if you haven't played this before.
[11:24.260 --> 11:29.260]  It's all skills-based, cannabis appreciation-based.
[11:29.260 --> 11:31.260]  Okay, so the first game.
[11:34.530 --> 11:36.530]  Is the Cannabis Sommelier Competition.
[11:36.530 --> 11:40.530]  Alright, so that is going to be the table on the side here.
[11:40.530 --> 11:44.530]  So the first thing to do is warm up.
[11:44.530 --> 11:47.530]  Okay, and the warm up round is the Cannabis Matching Game.
[11:47.530 --> 11:50.530]  So the name of the game is that you play.
[11:50.530 --> 11:52.530]  And you study the cannabis.
[11:52.530 --> 11:55.530]  And then we're going to remove the packaging.
[11:55.530 --> 11:57.530]  Put it into a blank jar.
[11:57.530 --> 11:59.530]  And then you have to determine.
[11:59.530 --> 12:04.530]  Okay, what cannabis cultivar and what grower made this product.
[12:04.530 --> 12:07.530]  Then you move on to the next table.
[12:07.530 --> 12:09.530]  Which is the Blind Identification.
[12:09.530 --> 12:14.530]  So that is where you don't have any reference to what this product is.
[12:14.530 --> 12:18.530]  But I chose flower that is distinctive enough.
[12:19.530 --> 12:21.530]  So that when you examine the flower.
[12:21.530 --> 12:23.530]  And you've come across it.
[12:23.530 --> 12:25.530]  Which is very likely.
[12:25.530 --> 12:29.530]  Please try your best in inputting your best guess.
[12:29.530 --> 12:32.530]  For the name of the cultivar and the producer.
[12:32.530 --> 12:36.530]  And we do this in honor of the producer.
[12:36.530 --> 12:39.530]  And the consumer in terms of the consumer knowing.
[12:39.530 --> 12:41.530]  I appreciate cannabis.
[12:41.530 --> 12:44.530]  And I can recognize really good cannabis when I see it.
[12:45.530 --> 12:48.530]  The producer, when they produce a product.
[12:48.530 --> 12:53.530]  That is amazing, distinguishable, distinctive.
[12:53.530 --> 12:58.530]  Then that passes the brand test.
[12:58.530 --> 13:02.530]  Meaning that you can show off your flower.
[13:02.530 --> 13:05.530]  And the branding of it without any logos or names.
[13:05.530 --> 13:08.530]  So that is the Cannabis Somali Competition.
[13:08.530 --> 13:13.530]  And let me tell you the prizes that we have for today's competition.
[13:13.530 --> 13:16.530]  Is really, really, really good.
[13:16.530 --> 13:20.530]  And the best prizes are for the Cannabis Somali Competition.
[13:20.530 --> 13:22.530]  It ranges in the hundreds of dollars.
[13:22.530 --> 13:25.530]  And I have multiple prizes for the top three.
[13:25.530 --> 13:26.530]  So please play.
[13:26.530 --> 13:30.530]  Because the prizes I will be displaying later are amazing.
[13:30.530 --> 13:31.530]  Like I want it for myself.
[13:31.530 --> 13:33.530]  But we're gifting it to you.
[13:35.530 --> 13:40.530]  Next game we have is the Best Knows Terpene ID.
[13:40.530 --> 13:42.530]  Brought on by Sweetgrass.
[13:42.530 --> 13:44.530]  So if you come to our little booth.
[13:44.530 --> 13:46.530]  The Cush table over here.
[13:46.530 --> 13:48.530]  Where Shaini is doing her little dance.
[13:48.530 --> 13:51.530]  We have terpenes.
[13:51.530 --> 13:52.530]  And this is your warm up round.
[13:52.530 --> 13:53.530]  Okay.
[13:53.530 --> 13:55.530]  So you're going to smell the isolated terpene.
[13:55.530 --> 13:59.530]  And see if you can identify it just with your nose.
[13:59.530 --> 14:03.530]  Eventually when we get to the final round.
[14:03.530 --> 14:05.530]  I'm going to give you the terpene jars again.
[14:05.530 --> 14:08.530]  And you're going to try to determine the name of the terpene.
[14:08.530 --> 14:12.530]  And the Best Knows winner also gets an amazing prize.
[14:12.530 --> 14:14.530]  It's actually multiple prizes.
[14:14.530 --> 14:15.530]  Okay.
[14:15.530 --> 14:16.530]  It's a whole prize pack.
[14:16.530 --> 14:20.530]  So please give Shaini over here a visit to play this game.
[14:20.530 --> 14:23.530]  And then we have the Joint Rolling Competition.
[14:23.530 --> 14:24.530]  Brought on by Pistol in Paris.
[14:24.530 --> 14:25.530]  We have two categories.
[14:25.530 --> 14:27.530]  So we have the Speed Rolling Competition.
[14:27.530 --> 14:28.530]  Which is super fun.
[14:28.530 --> 14:31.530]  And then number two is the Most Creative Joint.
[14:31.530 --> 14:33.530]  So the Most Creative Joint.
[14:33.530 --> 14:37.530]  I'm going to make an announcement for any contestant that's ready to play the game.
[14:37.530 --> 14:41.530]  And then you're going to start rolling your joints.
[14:41.530 --> 14:47.530]  And we're going to give you one hour to do your best work for the Most Creative Joint.
[14:47.530 --> 14:49.530]  And then we will announce the winner for that.
[14:49.530 --> 14:52.530]  And then the Weigh in Eighth.
[14:52.530 --> 14:55.530]  That is in Thanks to Embark.
[14:55.530 --> 14:57.530]  This game is super fun.
[14:57.530 --> 14:59.530]  What you're going to do is you're just.
[14:59.530 --> 15:01.530]  You know how whenever you buy a bag.
[15:01.530 --> 15:03.530]  You want to make sure it's the right weight.
[15:04.530 --> 15:07.530]  The person you're buying it from is not ripping you off or anything like that.
[15:07.530 --> 15:10.530]  However, the interesting thing is.
[15:10.530 --> 15:13.530]  Depending on the moisture content of that bud.
[15:13.530 --> 15:16.530]  It may weigh differently in different stages.
[15:16.530 --> 15:20.530]  So and also buds of different morphologies.
[15:20.530 --> 15:22.530]  So different sizes and shape.
[15:22.530 --> 15:27.530]  The fluffier lighter buds might make the total volume look bigger.
[15:27.530 --> 15:30.530]  Compared to buds that are more dense and weight.
[15:30.530 --> 15:32.530]  And tight.
[15:32.530 --> 15:34.530]  So when you play this game.
[15:34.530 --> 15:39.530]  Let's see how good you are in terms of sensing what 3.5 grams is like.
[15:39.530 --> 15:41.530]  And then we're going to do a final round.
[15:41.530 --> 15:47.530]  And whoever comes closest to weighing 3.5 grams without going over.
[15:47.530 --> 15:49.530]  Will also win a prize.
[15:51.530 --> 15:52.530]  All right.
[15:52.530 --> 15:54.530]  And special thanks.
[15:54.530 --> 15:58.530]  This has almost no affiliation to Collectors Cup.
[15:58.530 --> 16:01.530]  But Inspired Cannabis is actually throwing a party.
[16:01.530 --> 16:04.530]  So we're going to help get people there.
[16:04.530 --> 16:06.530]  It's an Inspired After Party.
[16:06.530 --> 16:08.530]  It's tomorrow in the evening.
[16:08.530 --> 16:10.530]  So everybody here is welcome to come.
[16:10.530 --> 16:13.530]  There's going to be great discounts on products.
[16:13.530 --> 16:17.530]  Fun games and other interesting interactions.
[16:19.530 --> 16:20.530]  All right.
[16:20.530 --> 16:21.530]  So.
[16:23.530 --> 16:26.530]  We're about to get started with the flower grading.
[16:28.530 --> 16:30.530]  And I just want to say.
[16:32.530 --> 16:38.530]  For all the pioneers that have risked their lives working in the industry.
[16:38.530 --> 16:41.530]  Where you might have to go to jail.
[16:41.530 --> 16:44.530]  Or your friends and family might shun you.
[16:44.530 --> 16:48.530]  For your involvement in the drug trade.
[16:48.530 --> 16:52.530]  And anyone that feels like.
[16:52.530 --> 16:54.530]  Hey you know what I have to make a stand.
[16:54.530 --> 16:56.530]  I have an identity.
[16:56.530 --> 16:58.530]  I identify with cannabis.
[16:58.530 --> 17:01.530]  Someone told me today that I look like a bud.
[17:01.530 --> 17:02.530]  With sparkly trichomes.
[17:02.530 --> 17:03.530]  I'm like yeah I do.
[17:03.530 --> 17:04.530]  Right.
[17:04.530 --> 17:06.530]  Like I identify with weed.
[17:06.530 --> 17:09.530]  And so I want to make this type of experience.
[17:09.530 --> 17:11.530]  Really welcome for all of you.
[17:11.530 --> 17:14.530]  To say it's okay and it's safe.
[17:14.530 --> 17:16.530]  To be part of the cannabis experience.
[17:16.530 --> 17:19.530]  And that you're working so hard.
[17:19.530 --> 17:20.530]  Every single day.
[17:20.530 --> 17:22.530]  Especially the butt tenders.
[17:22.530 --> 17:23.530]  You are on your feet.
[17:23.530 --> 17:25.530]  And very often.
[17:25.530 --> 17:26.530]  Some locations.
[17:26.530 --> 17:27.530]  You're working by yourself.
[17:27.530 --> 17:29.530]  Without a break.
[17:29.530 --> 17:30.530]  It's tough.
[17:30.530 --> 17:31.530]  That's not fair.
[17:31.530 --> 17:33.530]  When I was working in the retail store.
[17:33.530 --> 17:35.530]  I got broken into five times.
[17:35.530 --> 17:36.530]  Okay.
[17:36.530 --> 17:37.530]  And that was me.
[17:37.530 --> 17:38.530]  I had to drive into the store.
[17:38.530 --> 17:39.530]  Five in the morning.
[17:39.530 --> 17:40.530]  Three in the morning.
[17:40.530 --> 17:41.530]  It doesn't matter.
[17:41.530 --> 17:43.530]  To ensure that no one else would.
[17:43.530 --> 17:45.530]  Like after the windows are smashed open.
[17:45.530 --> 17:48.530]  You know to ensure that no one else is going to steal the product.
[17:48.530 --> 17:53.530]  It's a risky like occupation.
[17:54.530 --> 17:56.530]  But I want to provide an opportunity where.
[17:56.530 --> 17:59.530]  Hey, look.
[17:59.530 --> 18:03.530]  There's the cannabis experience that may be divided.
[18:03.530 --> 18:05.530]  Because the government decided to.
[18:05.530 --> 18:09.530]  To say there is a medical experience of cannabis.
[18:09.530 --> 18:13.530]  And then there's a recreational cannabis experience.
[18:13.530 --> 18:14.530]  But I'm like.
[18:14.530 --> 18:16.530]  Lines are blurred here.
[18:16.530 --> 18:20.530]  So let's call it a professional cannabis experience.
[18:21.530 --> 18:24.530]  So you are here to smoke weed professionally.
[18:24.530 --> 18:26.530]  And I love that.
[18:26.530 --> 18:28.530]  Because this is the first.
[18:28.530 --> 18:30.530]  You are the first generation.
[18:30.530 --> 18:35.530]  That can say I'm a professional cannabis smoker.
[18:35.530 --> 18:38.530]  Like how awesome is that?
[18:38.530 --> 18:40.530]  You get paid to do this.
[18:40.530 --> 18:43.530]  And you can actually declare this on your taxes.
[18:43.530 --> 18:45.530]  Without any kind of issue from the government.
[18:45.530 --> 18:47.530]  This is a real job.
[18:47.530 --> 18:49.530]  A real career that you can progress in.
[18:49.530 --> 18:51.530]  And starting at the retail level.
[18:51.530 --> 18:53.530]  Where you have all this exposure to cannabis.
[18:53.530 --> 18:57.530]  Gives you so much insight and experience.
[18:57.530 --> 19:00.530]  That you're really pioneering the industry.
[19:00.530 --> 19:01.530]  Okay.
[19:01.530 --> 19:04.530]  We have legends here that have worked so hard.
[19:04.530 --> 19:06.530]  To allow us to be here.
[19:06.530 --> 19:07.530]  And I'm talking about John.
[19:07.530 --> 19:08.530]  And I'm talking about Marcus.
[19:08.530 --> 19:09.530]  Okay.
[19:09.530 --> 19:10.530]  I'm talking about all the growers.
[19:10.530 --> 19:13.530]  That have done all the amazing work to get here beforehand.
[19:13.530 --> 19:14.530]  Yes.
[19:14.530 --> 19:15.530]  Thank you.
[19:15.530 --> 19:17.530]  Really.
[19:17.530 --> 19:19.530]  They are like our legends.
[19:19.530 --> 19:21.530]  And I know that they are super humble.
[19:21.530 --> 19:22.530]  And they say, you know what?
[19:22.530 --> 19:24.530]  It's the people before us.
[19:24.530 --> 19:25.530]  The grandfathers before us.
[19:25.530 --> 19:27.530]  That really built the industry.
[19:27.530 --> 19:28.530]  But here we are.
[19:28.530 --> 19:30.530]  We're still in the beginning stages.
[19:30.530 --> 19:35.530]  So we want to be very positive representatives of the cannabis industry.
[19:35.530 --> 19:38.530]  And so how we're going to get there is.
[19:38.530 --> 19:45.530]  I want Canada to be the gold standard for good quality cannabis.
[19:46.530 --> 19:49.530]  It's very costly to grow cannabis indoors.
[19:49.530 --> 19:50.530]  Okay.
[19:50.530 --> 19:53.530]  Cannabis, there will be other countries and nations.
[19:53.530 --> 19:55.530]  If they choose to legalize.
[19:55.530 --> 19:58.530]  Will be a lot less expensive for them to produce it.
[19:58.530 --> 20:02.530]  So if we want the Canadian cannabis industry to thrive.
[20:02.530 --> 20:08.530]  We have to be known for extremely, extremely good cannabis.
[20:08.530 --> 20:10.530]  And unique genetics.
[20:10.530 --> 20:12.530]  And all the derivatives that come with that.
[20:13.530 --> 20:19.530]  So I cannot wait to hear more about hash and the hash rosin process.
[20:19.530 --> 20:23.530]  Because that is the next level of cannabis.
[20:23.530 --> 20:26.530]  And we need to be pioneers of that.
[20:26.530 --> 20:28.530]  With that said.
[20:28.530 --> 20:33.530]  Who is ready to smoke some weed?
[20:33.530 --> 20:36.530]  All right.
[20:36.530 --> 20:37.530]  All right.
[20:37.530 --> 20:42.530]  So Andy, if I could get the lights a little bit brighter.
[20:42.530 --> 20:44.530]  And what we're going to do is.
[20:44.530 --> 20:46.530]  I have cannabis sommeliers.
[20:46.530 --> 20:48.530]  And we have a lot of weed today.
[20:48.530 --> 20:52.530]  And we're going to be distributing the flower to your tables.
[20:52.530 --> 20:56.530]  And so your cannabis sommelier is going to help guide you.
[20:56.530 --> 20:57.530]  To make sure that.
[20:57.530 --> 20:58.530]  Sorry.
[20:58.530 --> 21:00.530]  We're going to do an elimination round first.
[21:00.530 --> 21:03.530]  So based on the flowers that we have.
[21:03.530 --> 21:05.530]  You're going to pick the top three.
[21:05.530 --> 21:06.530]  Okay.
[21:06.530 --> 21:08.530]  So you put in your vote for the top three.
[21:08.530 --> 21:11.530]  Based on aroma and appearances.
[21:11.530 --> 21:15.530]  And then the top three are going to be advancing to the next round.
[21:15.530 --> 21:20.530]  Where you're going to be grading it, smoking it, and tasting it.
[21:20.530 --> 21:23.530]  Once we get through the qualification round.
[21:23.530 --> 21:25.530]  This is how the schedule is going to go.
[21:27.530 --> 21:28.530]  Okay.
[21:28.530 --> 21:29.530]  Okay.
[21:29.530 --> 21:35.530]  So I highly suggest that we're going to be going through one flower at a time.
[21:35.530 --> 21:38.530]  And we're layering it with an educational presentation.
[21:38.530 --> 21:40.530]  This allows you to get nice and toasted.
[21:40.530 --> 21:44.530]  And primed and ready to learn about more educational content.
[21:44.530 --> 21:45.530]  Okay.
[21:45.530 --> 21:47.530]  So the first thing is.
[21:47.530 --> 21:51.530]  Make sure you go through the physical and aromatic descriptors.
[21:51.530 --> 21:52.530]  Then you do a dry pull.
[21:52.530 --> 21:54.530]  And then you do a burn test.
[21:54.530 --> 21:56.530]  After that.
[21:56.530 --> 22:00.530]  You input your scores into that little card that's on your table.
[22:00.530 --> 22:04.530]  And so you're going to see 12 different parameters that we laid out.
[22:04.530 --> 22:06.530]  For what is quality.
[22:06.530 --> 22:08.530]  What determines quality.
[22:08.530 --> 22:10.530]  Now if you were to add up those scores.
[22:10.530 --> 22:13.530]  It's not going to give you the total grading score.
[22:13.530 --> 22:16.530]  Because we have added a weighting system.
[22:16.530 --> 22:18.530]  Meaning some parameters.
[22:18.530 --> 22:20.530]  Such as trim and moisture.
[22:20.530 --> 22:24.530]  Aren't as important as things like smoothness.
[22:24.530 --> 22:26.530]  Endurance of flavor.
[22:26.530 --> 22:27.530]  Combustion.
[22:27.530 --> 22:28.530]  Alright.
[22:28.530 --> 22:31.530]  So that's why once you get your gratings done.
[22:31.530 --> 22:35.530]  We ask that you input the information into our app.
[22:35.530 --> 22:36.530]  Into our website.
[22:36.530 --> 22:39.530]  And it calculates the end result for you.
[22:39.530 --> 22:41.530]  And you do that for every single flower.
[22:41.530 --> 22:46.760]  And when you're rolling a joint.
[22:46.760 --> 22:49.760]  We ask that you do a tasting joint.
[22:49.760 --> 22:50.760]  Okay.
[22:50.760 --> 22:51.760]  Like about .7.
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.760]  You can either have that as a visual joint.
[22:54.760 --> 22:56.760]  You can have it as a sharing joint.
[22:56.760 --> 22:57.760]  Whatever it may be.
[22:57.760 --> 23:04.760]  Just a reminder to write the jar number on the end of the joint by the filter.
[23:04.760 --> 23:08.760]  Then you're being mindful of understanding.
[23:08.760 --> 23:09.760]  Okay.
[23:09.760 --> 23:10.760]  Like I'm connecting the dots.
[23:10.760 --> 23:12.760]  The flower that I saw inside the room.
[23:12.760 --> 23:13.760]  And the flower that I'm smoking outside.
[23:13.760 --> 23:14.760]  Does this make sense?
[23:14.760 --> 23:15.760]  Okay.
[23:15.760 --> 23:17.760]  You're welcome to roll more than one joint.
[23:17.760 --> 23:18.760]  Okay.
[23:18.760 --> 23:21.760]  And then lastly, if you want to kind of do a reference check later on.
[23:21.760 --> 23:24.760]  To see if like now you're on flower two.
[23:24.760 --> 23:26.760]  How does that compare to the burn in flower one?
[23:26.760 --> 23:27.760]  Alright.
[23:27.760 --> 23:31.890]  Okay.
[23:31.890 --> 23:32.890]  Also.
[23:32.890 --> 23:33.890]  Safety first.
[23:33.890 --> 23:34.890]  Okay.
[23:34.890 --> 23:43.890]  We are here to ensure that you have a very positive experience.
[23:43.890 --> 23:45.890]  A responsible experience.
[23:45.890 --> 23:50.890]  So if you are feeling like a little too overwhelmed or anything like that.
[23:50.890 --> 23:52.890]  Please let your cannabis mollier know.
[23:52.890 --> 23:54.890]  I know some people are like, I got this.
[23:54.890 --> 23:55.890]  I got this.
[23:55.890 --> 23:56.890]  Well, you know what?
[23:56.890 --> 23:58.890]  Sometimes if you're going into.
[23:58.890 --> 23:59.890]  There's going to be some dabs.
[23:59.890 --> 24:01.890]  There's a rosin press over here.
[24:01.890 --> 24:03.890]  Thanks to Cisco and True Fact Cannabis.
[24:03.890 --> 24:05.890]  If you want to squish some bud.
[24:05.890 --> 24:06.890]  We're going to be doing that.
[24:06.890 --> 24:08.890]  Like it can get pretty intense.
[24:08.890 --> 24:12.890]  So I please ask that you understand and you control yourself.
[24:12.890 --> 24:14.890]  And consume safely.
[24:14.890 --> 24:15.890]  Okay.
[24:15.890 --> 24:19.290]  Alright.
[24:20.290 --> 24:25.290]  And so as part of the cannabis mollier experience is all about appreciation
[24:25.290 --> 24:28.290]  cannabis to the next level.
[24:28.290 --> 24:30.290]  It's all about sensory training.
[24:30.290 --> 24:32.290]  That's why we have the terpene experience.
[24:32.290 --> 24:33.290]  The way in eight.
[24:33.290 --> 24:38.290]  It's all about how do you connect your knowledge and it translates into a
[24:38.290 --> 24:40.290]  real skill.
[24:40.290 --> 24:45.290]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through all of the grading
[24:45.290 --> 24:46.290]  parameters.
[24:46.290 --> 24:49.290]  While our cannabis Molly start bringing out the flower actually do it after.
[24:49.290 --> 24:50.290]  Yeah.
[24:50.290 --> 25:06.340]  And then let's do this.
[25:06.340 --> 25:07.340]  Okay.
[25:07.340 --> 25:12.340]  So when it comes to quality grading, we have 12 parameters.
[25:12.340 --> 25:13.340]  But integrity.
[25:13.340 --> 25:15.340]  Trichome expression.
[25:15.340 --> 25:16.340]  Trim moisture.
[25:16.340 --> 25:17.340]  Odor strength.
[25:17.340 --> 25:19.340]  Post grind aroma.
[25:19.340 --> 25:21.340]  Dry pull flavor.
[25:21.340 --> 25:23.340]  Flavor complexity.
[25:23.340 --> 25:25.340]  Flavor intensity.
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.340]  Smoothness.
[25:26.340 --> 25:27.340]  Combustion and ash.
[25:27.340 --> 25:29.340]  And endurance of flavor.
[25:29.340 --> 25:34.340]  So you can tell that we really nerded out on understanding what leads to good
[25:34.340 --> 25:36.340]  quality cannabis.
[25:36.340 --> 25:37.340]  We also.
[25:37.340 --> 25:39.340]  And this is not me making things up.
[25:39.340 --> 25:40.340]  Okay.
[25:40.340 --> 25:45.340]  We consulted with dozens of cannabis experts and consumers, growers, and
[25:45.340 --> 25:50.340]  breeders to find out what does it mean to them for good quality cannabis.
[25:50.340 --> 25:56.340]  And isn't it interesting that it doesn't say Indica Sativa hybrid or THC
[25:57.340 --> 25:58.340]  right.
[25:58.340 --> 26:02.340]  Terpene percentage may have an indication of quality, but there's a lot more to
[26:02.340 --> 26:03.340]  it than just terpenes.
[26:03.340 --> 26:08.340]  What if some, a flower had high terpene count and you ended up smoking it and
[26:08.340 --> 26:10.340]  it's like harsh and bitter and you're like, well, that wasn't that good.
[26:10.340 --> 26:11.340]  Right.
[26:11.340 --> 26:15.340]  So these are the parameters that we have determined to be good quality
[26:15.340 --> 26:16.340]  cannabis.
[26:16.340 --> 26:17.340]  All right.
[26:17.340 --> 26:19.340]  So I'm going to start off with bud integrity.
[26:19.340 --> 26:25.340]  Bud integrity is ideally we want the whole buds to look, be intact.
[26:26.340 --> 26:31.340]  And I'm looking for symmetry in the bud and also consistency in the whole
[26:33.340 --> 26:34.340]  batch.
[26:34.340 --> 26:38.340]  So when you're grading for bud integrity, we're giving you a fair amount of
[26:38.340 --> 26:43.340]  cannabis to take a look at all the buds and say, Hey, can I find somewhat
[26:44.340 --> 26:47.340]  uniformity, not in the size, but in the shape.
[26:47.340 --> 26:48.340]  Okay.
[26:48.340 --> 26:52.340]  And none of the buds here would ever fail.
[26:52.340 --> 26:53.340]  Okay.
[26:53.340 --> 26:55.340]  So this is all in market cannabis.
[26:55.340 --> 27:01.340]  So I know that you're all judges here, but let's try to be a little bit more
[27:01.340 --> 27:03.340]  humble and say, Hey, you know what?
[27:03.340 --> 27:06.340]  Like there's no flower here that should fail.
[27:06.340 --> 27:07.340]  Okay.
[27:07.340 --> 27:10.340]  If it fails, like everything should grade over 50.
[27:10.340 --> 27:14.340]  If it's graded under 50, it means it does not like, it should not be even
[27:14.340 --> 27:16.340]  eligible to be sold in the market.
[27:19.340 --> 27:20.340]  Next is trichome expression.
[27:20.340 --> 27:25.340]  So some of you may have a microscope, some of me not, but this is even at a
[27:25.340 --> 27:26.340]  quick glance.
[27:26.340 --> 27:30.340]  When you look at cannabis, it should be frosty, right?
[27:30.340 --> 27:33.340]  Under a microscope, that's where you can really see how well developed the
[27:33.340 --> 27:35.340]  trichome heads are.
[27:35.340 --> 27:40.340]  However, and what we want is dense sparkly trichomes.
[27:40.340 --> 27:43.340]  Like I love trichomes kind of like these like chandeliers here, right?
[27:43.340 --> 27:48.340]  Where you see more trichomes than plant matter, where there's so many trichomes
[27:48.340 --> 27:52.340]  that are covering the bud, you think the bud is lighter in color.
[27:52.340 --> 27:54.340]  You think the bud's white, but it's not.
[27:54.340 --> 27:59.340]  It's actually green, but the trichomes have totally masked that color.
[27:59.340 --> 28:00.340]  Trim.
[28:00.340 --> 28:02.340]  Easy to figure out.
[28:02.340 --> 28:06.340]  All we're doing is looking for a nice clean trim with minimal sugar leaves,
[28:06.340 --> 28:07.340]  okay?
[28:07.340 --> 28:11.340]  It's the sugar leaves that has excess chlorophyll.
[28:11.340 --> 28:15.340]  So when you smoke it, it delivers this like harsh kind of like when you know
[28:15.340 --> 28:19.340]  when you're, I don't know if you're a kid and you burn some grass in a field
[28:19.340 --> 28:22.340]  and you have that like really nasty flavor.
[28:22.340 --> 28:25.340]  That's what chlorophyll does when it burns.
[28:25.340 --> 28:29.340]  So you want to have minimum chlorophyll, minimum sugar leaves, and maximum
[28:29.340 --> 28:33.340]  flour because the flour actually burns nice and clean.
[28:33.340 --> 28:34.340]  All right.
[28:34.340 --> 28:35.340]  Moisture.
[28:35.340 --> 28:38.340]  Moisture is also great, easy to determine.
[28:38.340 --> 28:40.340]  You give it a squeeze.
[28:40.340 --> 28:46.340]  If it bounces back kind of like a Nerf ball or a marshmallow, then it's ideal moisture.
[28:46.340 --> 28:49.340]  If it crumbles upon your squish, too dry.
[28:49.340 --> 28:52.340]  If it squishes and it doesn't bounce back, too wet.
[28:52.340 --> 28:56.340]  And that is an indication of a good cure.
[28:56.340 --> 29:00.340]  And John B. is going to be doing a talk about that.
[29:00.340 --> 29:02.340]  Then, odor strength.
[29:02.340 --> 29:08.340]  So when it comes to physical and aromatic descriptors, odor strength is one of the
[29:08.340 --> 29:09.340]  most important.
[29:09.340 --> 29:12.340]  It is more heavily weighted than other parameters.
[29:12.340 --> 29:13.340]  Okay.
[29:13.340 --> 29:15.340]  So we want stinky, stinky weed.
[29:15.340 --> 29:21.340]  And we want it to be so stinky that when you open up the jar, it's like an explosion of aroma.
[29:21.340 --> 29:26.340]  When you squeeze it and you grind it, that aroma gets more intensified.
[29:26.340 --> 29:27.340]  It gets louder.
[29:27.340 --> 29:28.340]  Right.
[29:28.340 --> 29:30.340]  So it's not about if you like the smell or not.
[29:30.340 --> 29:31.340]  Okay.
[29:31.340 --> 29:33.340]  So you really have to get your head over this.
[29:33.340 --> 29:36.340]  It's not about personal preference.
[29:36.340 --> 29:39.340]  It's about how loud the smell is.
[29:39.340 --> 29:43.340]  Some people might not like cat piss.
[29:43.340 --> 29:45.340]  Some people might not like poop.
[29:45.340 --> 29:48.340]  Some people might not like cheese or skunk.
[29:48.340 --> 29:49.340]  Okay.
[29:49.340 --> 29:52.340]  It's not natural to like those aromas.
[29:52.340 --> 29:58.340]  But if it is a loud and pronounced aroma, that is an indication of good quality.
[29:58.340 --> 30:03.270]  Okay.
[30:03.270 --> 30:04.270]  And some deduction points.
[30:04.270 --> 30:06.270]  So hopefully we won't see any of this.
[30:06.270 --> 30:10.270]  But that's if you see seeded in more than one bud.
[30:10.270 --> 30:11.270]  Okay.
[30:11.270 --> 30:13.270]  If one bud may have a seed, that's all good.
[30:13.270 --> 30:14.270]  That's actually a bonus.
[30:14.270 --> 30:15.270]  Right.
[30:15.270 --> 30:18.270]  Because you're just going to put that later, save it for later.
[30:18.270 --> 30:19.270]  Right.
[30:19.270 --> 30:23.270]  If you find more than two buds having seeds, then yeah, it's seeded.
[30:23.270 --> 30:26.270]  The grower didn't really do a good job of keeping the males out.
[30:26.270 --> 30:28.270]  Bugs, definitely don't want to be seeing any of that.
[30:28.270 --> 30:32.270]  That's when you â€“ I don't know if you smoke like old school weed and sometimes it goes crack-pupple.
[30:32.270 --> 30:35.270]  That's just basically bug carcasses.
[30:36.270 --> 30:38.270]  Like burning.
[30:38.270 --> 30:39.270]  Yuck.
[30:39.270 --> 30:40.270]  And then mold.
[30:40.270 --> 30:41.270]  So the fuzzy white stuff.
[30:41.270 --> 30:44.270]  So that's not like the crystally shiny trichomes.
[30:44.270 --> 30:50.270]  That's the fuzzy stuff that you see sometimes on blueberries and other fruits that you're like, no.
[30:50.270 --> 30:54.270]  For the immunocompromised, you smoke that, you're going to feel really sick.
[30:54.270 --> 31:00.270]  And so before you burn the joint, this is something that I always forget to do,
[31:00.270 --> 31:03.270]  but I was inspired to do so, is the dry pull.
[31:03.270 --> 31:11.270]  And the reason why is sometimes you're going to find flower that has an amazing aroma and a great grind,
[31:11.270 --> 31:16.270]  and then you do a dry pull and the dry pull doesn't match the aroma.
[31:16.270 --> 31:17.270]  You're like, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:17.270 --> 31:21.270]  That translation of the aroma doesn't come through in the dry pull.
[31:21.270 --> 31:25.270]  It's going to be a clue that the flower is not going to burn right.
[31:25.270 --> 31:31.270]  And very often if there's a complete mismatch, that flower's got some kind of burn issues,
[31:31.270 --> 31:33.270]  whether it be harsh or bitter.
[31:33.270 --> 31:39.270]  If it comes through and it's strong and delicious, you're like, yeah, this has a good dry pull.
[31:39.270 --> 31:42.270]  And sometimes, especially the trained cannabis sommeliers,
[31:42.270 --> 31:47.270]  you can even identify a flower just by the dry pull because you're like, oh, I know this flavor.
[31:47.270 --> 31:48.270]  Right.
[31:48.270 --> 31:50.270]  And flavor complexity.
[31:50.270 --> 31:56.270]  So you know how with music there can be one note, right?
[31:57.270 --> 32:04.270]  Or you can have multiple notes or you can have a symphony with different instruments.
[32:04.270 --> 32:07.270]  And so the flavor complexity is very similar to that.
[32:07.270 --> 32:13.270]  So the more flavor notes that you can determine through your nose and your tongue,
[32:13.270 --> 32:22.270]  then the better quality that flower is because it's showcasing its full breadth of flavor.
[32:22.270 --> 32:23.270]  All right.
[32:23.270 --> 32:24.270]  And flavor intensity.
[32:24.270 --> 32:30.270]  So just like order strength, flavor intensity is just like the sound.
[32:30.270 --> 32:31.270]  So the volume.
[32:31.270 --> 32:35.270]  So low flavor intensity is quiet, it's muted.
[32:35.270 --> 32:39.270]  You can't really distinguish amongst the aromas or flavors.
[32:39.270 --> 32:45.270]  And then a flavor intensity that is extreme is like, wow, the flavor is getting more intense.
[32:45.270 --> 32:48.270]  I'm getting more flavors that are being delivered.
[32:48.270 --> 32:51.270]  The flavor is getting stronger.
[32:51.270 --> 32:53.270]  That is amazing flavor intensity.
[32:53.270 --> 32:55.270]  Very hard for a flower to score on that.
[32:55.270 --> 32:56.270]  Okay.
[32:56.270 --> 32:58.270]  Next up is smoothness.
[32:58.270 --> 33:06.270]  So smoothness is the most important, the most heavily weighted component when it comes to grating flour.
[33:06.270 --> 33:10.270]  Because at the end of the day, we want it to be smooth.
[33:10.270 --> 33:11.270]  Okay.
[33:11.270 --> 33:13.270]  If it's not smooth, then why smoke it?
[33:13.270 --> 33:14.270]  Like that's me.
[33:14.270 --> 33:19.270]  Some people will still smoke it if it's not smooth, but we want it to be smooth, not harsh.
[33:19.270 --> 33:23.270]  Like as if you're drinking like that chai tea that we've got going on.
[33:23.270 --> 33:24.270]  Okay.
[33:24.270 --> 33:26.270]  Not some kind of like acidic vinegar.
[33:26.270 --> 33:27.270]  Right.
[33:27.270 --> 33:32.270]  Like if I was to compare it as a liquid, but as like a gas, as a smoke, you want it to be smooth.
[33:32.270 --> 33:39.380]  You don't want to have a harsh irritation on the back of your throat.
[33:39.380 --> 33:40.380]  Combustion and ash.
[33:40.380 --> 33:50.380]  So the science is not settled on this yet, but for the most part, most of us believe that ash and combustion has a strong component to play.
[33:50.380 --> 33:53.380]  So we want it to burn all the way smoothly.
[33:53.380 --> 33:59.380]  You don't need to be relighting a joint over and over and over unless it's like raining and it's super windy or something like that.
[33:59.380 --> 34:06.380]  But on a regular circumstances, a joint should burn properly all the way through without relighting it.
[34:06.380 --> 34:10.380]  The ash should also be nice and white and fine.
[34:10.380 --> 34:13.380]  So the structure and the consistency of the ash.
[34:13.380 --> 34:18.380]  And the way to determine that is you just ash a little bit on the palm of your hand and give it a little touch.
[34:19.380 --> 34:23.380]  If it becomes like a fine dust, you've got something really nice.
[34:23.380 --> 34:34.380]  If it is chunky and black and different textured, there's something in there that's not burning as smooth as like a truly organic plant material.
[34:36.380 --> 34:37.380]  All right.
[34:37.380 --> 34:44.380]  Now, endurance of flavor is the hardest component for a flower to score high on.
[34:44.380 --> 34:53.380]  You may never even come across flower that has an endurance of flavor, that burns all the way to the end with all the flavor.
[34:53.380 --> 34:59.380]  So what I mean by that is often a joint should taste delicious first few tokes.
[34:59.380 --> 35:00.380]  Okay.
[35:00.380 --> 35:04.380]  But how often where you get to a quarter way, you're like, no more flavor.
[35:04.380 --> 35:06.380]  Halfway, no more flavor.
[35:06.380 --> 35:07.380]  It's harsh.
[35:07.380 --> 35:09.380]  And you're like, eh, not going to even finish it.
[35:10.380 --> 35:13.380]  Or very exceptional flower.
[35:13.380 --> 35:14.380]  Okay.
[35:14.380 --> 35:21.380]  Like only quads can really score high in this is you burn the joint all the way and it tastes so good.
[35:21.380 --> 35:22.380]  And you're like, you pass it around.
[35:22.380 --> 35:23.380]  You're already smoking it.
[35:23.380 --> 35:24.380]  They're enjoying it.
[35:24.380 --> 35:25.380]  They're enjoying it.
[35:25.380 --> 35:27.380]  And then all of a sudden you inhale.
[35:27.380 --> 35:32.380]  Oh, you got the, you hit the filter because you're like, damn, the flower was so good.
[35:32.380 --> 35:34.380]  The taste was all the way there.
[35:34.380 --> 35:37.380]  That is exceptional endurance of flavor.
[35:37.380 --> 35:40.380]  And hopefully we will experience that today.
[35:40.380 --> 35:48.160]  So let's get the greetings begin.
[35:48.160 --> 35:51.160]  Let's smoke some weed.
[35:51.160 --> 35:52.160]  All right.
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.160]  We're going to be distributing the flower and we're going to be doing an elimination round.
[35:57.160 --> 35:59.160]  So I'm going to be doing that live with you.
[35:59.160 --> 36:06.140]  Okay.
[36:06.140 --> 36:07.140]  Okay.
[36:07.140 --> 36:12.140]  So it's not all tables are going to get more than three jars because it looks like everybody filled in.
[36:12.140 --> 36:13.140]  Yay.
[36:13.140 --> 36:14.140]  Wow.
[36:14.140 --> 36:15.140]  Two and a half hours later.
[36:15.140 --> 36:16.140]  It's all good.
[36:16.140 --> 36:17.140]  Yeah, no problem.
[36:17.140 --> 36:18.140]  Okay.
[36:18.140 --> 36:19.140]  Let's go.
[36:19.140 --> 36:20.140]  Let's let's smoke some weed.
[36:20.140 --> 36:22.140]  You came just right on time.
[36:22.140 --> 36:23.140]  Huh?
[36:23.140 --> 36:24.140]  All right.
[36:24.140 --> 36:32.140]  Let's call up the cannabis Mali a volunteers to bring your flowers to your guest tables, please.
[36:32.140 --> 36:35.140]  And then music Andy.
[37:00.580 --> 37:02.580]  This song was inspired by the future cannabis project.
[37:02.580 --> 37:06.580]  It's been instrumental in the revolution and dedicated to his view.

[37:50.950 --> 37:51.950]  Mariah.
[37:51.950 --> 38:08.550]  For the tables that have four flowers, you just spend the first couple of minutes smelling
[38:08.550 --> 38:14.910]  each jar and looking at each jar to see what looks great in terms of bud integrity and
[38:14.910 --> 38:16.470]  also aroma.
[38:16.470 --> 38:21.430]  And then you eliminate the one flower that is not good enough for you to judge today,
[38:21.510 --> 38:22.010]  okay?
[38:22.010 --> 38:24.310]  And your can of s'mores is gonna help you with that.
[39:39.670 --> 39:42.390]  For the seed, there is no life.

[44:23.380 --> 44:27.460]  Come on, this is a new industry. You got to be able to pick up a microphone, step into the
[44:27.460 --> 44:32.900]  play, and it's Daniel. What do you think? So I think for us, the top two contenders would be
[44:33.060 --> 44:39.060]  five and seven, and then the toss up for the bottom is between two and four. Some people kept
[44:39.060 --> 44:45.780]  four, some people kept two. So it'll be interesting to see which one gets eliminated, if that's how
[44:45.780 --> 44:59.790]  we're doing it. Yeah? What's your thought? Yeah? What's your top number one? Yeah?
[45:05.390 --> 45:07.790]  Just on nose alone, what are you thinking?
[45:15.790 --> 45:25.180]  I feel like he's coming to it. Yeah? What's your number one?
[45:25.900 --> 45:26.540]  My man.
[45:32.780 --> 45:33.660]  It's looking at you.
[45:36.060 --> 45:39.260]  We eliminated four. Yeah, that's in the pocket.
[45:42.460 --> 45:47.180]  Oh, sorry. Apparently, I'm supposed to talk into a microphone. Thank you very much. I appreciate
[45:47.180 --> 45:51.740]  it. So yeah, there is a jar missing. It's called number four jars missing in my eyes.
[45:52.700 --> 45:56.380]  Um, I definitely like in the gas, but that's me, right? Everybody's got a different flavor,
[45:56.380 --> 45:59.740]  everybody's got a different tone of what's going to work for them or what they like. So
[45:59.740 --> 46:04.300]  it's really that terpene and they all have very good nose to them. I'd like to do the water
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.380]  activity testing. So at one point, I'm going to test the water activity and take a look at it. I
[46:08.380 --> 46:13.260]  can, I can smell by certain ones that are probably a little bit drier than what I would anticipate.
[46:13.260 --> 46:17.500]  And the ones that are more natural pundit probably got more moisture in them. So you can be able to
[46:17.500 --> 46:23.660]  smell that. And then this is me 30 years of smoking a lot of weed and testing a lot of it.
[46:23.660 --> 46:27.980]  But thank you guys just for being able to come to the table and thank you. And, uh, you know,
[46:27.980 --> 46:31.900]  I appreciate you. We're going to, this is our new rising star and I'm going to call him out. How
[46:31.900 --> 46:39.420]  about yourself? What was your little aspects? I'm also completely new to this space. So new
[46:39.420 --> 46:43.180]  means nothing. You know what that means? You have a nose, you eat food, right? You like food,
[46:43.660 --> 46:48.700]  you like the smell of grandma's apple pie. You like weed. You're not new at all.
[46:58.870 --> 47:04.470]  I don't know. I'm talking into it. Do you want it? Okay. Here. Is this the one?
[47:06.710 --> 47:12.790]  Hi. All right. Well, I'd like to just jump in there, right? It's kind of like,
[47:13.030 --> 47:16.870]  we were discussing now different flavors with different noses, different,
[47:16.870 --> 47:23.750]  different, uh, intake levels, heavy smoker, right? Light smoker, right? Don't smoke that much.
[47:25.430 --> 47:28.070]  No, but no, but, but it's, it's on the smells and the flavors.
[47:30.230 --> 47:36.470]  Exactly. Oh, have you? Ah, so you already know where that hits you. So we're going to, you know
[47:36.470 --> 47:40.870]  what? I got a moisture test that we're sitting right there. Should we do the water activity
[47:40.870 --> 47:50.950]  testing at one point? Okay. So we're going to take a jar, the one that you're eliminating back
[47:50.950 --> 47:55.990]  out and I'm going to make an announcement. Okay. All right. Thank you. Is this the mic?
[47:55.990 --> 48:00.470]  Is there a jar number four that somehow just fell off the wagon that landed in my pocket?
[48:02.070 --> 48:03.830]  Let's bring it back. Okay. I don't know why.
[48:06.150 --> 48:08.470]  Okay. Is this my mic now? Can I take this forever?
[48:09.190 --> 48:09.670]  Sweet.
[48:12.630 --> 48:13.670]  They cut me off, right?
[48:16.630 --> 48:19.430]  We think we're talking into something, but YouTube is listening.
[48:20.790 --> 48:25.510]  How you doing, Ian? Fantastic. Do you like to talk into a microphone?
[48:25.510 --> 48:27.910]  Yeah. We want to get right up into the microphone and get some of the
[48:29.510 --> 48:30.150]  so what are we here?
[48:34.150 --> 48:35.590]  Fine. Just cut me off again here.
[48:39.430 --> 48:43.430]  We will be right back. Julie will be here with another announcement in a minute.
[48:51.650 --> 48:53.010]  Yeah. She's doing an announcement now. Yeah.
[48:53.890 --> 48:56.050]  It's just a quick one and then it can go back to him.
[49:12.010 --> 49:19.050]  Okay. So you should all have only three jars on your table. For the tables that have four,
[49:19.850 --> 49:28.650]  our can of sommeliers will take that jar to the back. Okay. And now I ask that at your table,
[49:28.650 --> 49:35.450]  everybody will be grading one flower, the same flower. So choose the flower that you want to
[49:35.450 --> 49:42.570]  grade first and you will get to the other two. And like I said, you're welcome to roll multiple
[49:42.570 --> 49:47.130]  joints so that you can have a reference for when you're grading the second flower and when you're
[49:47.130 --> 49:56.730]  grading the third flower. But please just collectively do one flower. Gotcha. All right.
[49:56.730 --> 50:05.690]  Thank you. Oh, sorry. Another announcement. So no smoking, vaping, or dabbing is allowed inside,
[50:05.690 --> 50:14.570]  but we have an amazing patio and the sun's out. So please enjoy smoking outside in the patio.
[50:14.570 --> 50:22.010]  And your butts, please dispose them in the garbage can. All right. So we're going to give
[50:22.010 --> 50:29.290]  you about 20 minutes to get the first flower rolled up and smoked. And please ensure that you
[50:29.290 --> 50:35.370]  enter the grading parameters on your scorecard. And when you come back for your seats,
[50:36.730 --> 50:39.850]  we're going to enter it into the digital form. Thank you.
[50:39.850 --> 50:48.100]  So we'll get it switched so it's no longer on the PA and just coming through the main.
[50:48.100 --> 50:48.580]  Yeah. Amazing.
[50:48.580 --> 50:53.060]  And then we switch back and forth. It's easy peasy. Okay. Cool. Awesome.
[51:08.250 --> 51:13.210]  So hopefully I haven't bumped things around and moved things around too much, but we will go
[51:13.210 --> 51:18.010]  around and see if we can find some troublemakers to hang out with and see what they're doing.
[51:18.810 --> 51:22.330]  Hopefully you all are enjoying the show thus far. We're having a lot of fun here,
[51:23.450 --> 51:28.170]  as always. Hopefully you're going well. Let's see here.
[51:42.700 --> 51:50.060]  I, of course, forgot to bring my gimbal today. So I have to hand carry my phone,
[51:51.020 --> 51:53.900]  which is not exactly the desired outcome here,
[51:58.270 --> 52:04.270]  but we will get there regardless. Everybody hearing me loud and clear? We are coming through.
[52:19.530 --> 52:22.330]  Oh, I'm right here. Yeah. We're live right now.
[52:27.180 --> 52:28.460]  Not much, but it's like,
[52:32.940 --> 52:34.140]  I saw you here earlier.
[52:35.100 --> 52:35.980]  You're a busy table though.
[52:38.700 --> 52:41.260]  I'm never too busy to hang out with you. That's for sure.
[52:44.620 --> 52:45.180]  I try to.
[52:49.100 --> 52:54.140]  I don't do all of them. I just host them and make sure that they happen and make
[52:54.140 --> 52:57.980]  sure that they're not bullshit. Yeah. I just try and make sure there's good people.
[53:07.180 --> 53:12.220]  Seeing lives change and transform by cannabis. And you know, I really, I'm encouraged every day.
[53:14.460 --> 53:14.780]  Thank you.
[53:21.660 --> 53:24.940]  That nice joint? I just banged it off real quick. I'm actually a little unhappy. Okay. There we go.
[53:28.940 --> 53:30.300]  It's a little off, but we'll get there.
[53:31.740 --> 53:32.700]  Are we happy with the roll?
[53:32.700 --> 53:37.020]  We're good. Okay. Good. We're talking about testing.
[53:38.460 --> 53:41.660]  Slightly. Yes, but Hey, what's up, bro? Good to see you.
[53:42.860 --> 53:45.980]  Pardon me? Yeah. It was number. Was that number seven?
[53:47.740 --> 53:50.940]  Number two. Yeah. Two is fire. Actually. I gotta say my hands are sticky,
[53:50.940 --> 53:55.980]  had good aroma, bud structure. It'd be nice to know who that was, but let's be honest.
[53:55.980 --> 54:00.700]  I want to know who's being eliminated. I'm kidding. And not to be mean, but if you are
[54:00.700 --> 54:04.540]  being eliminated, I don't want to order. Somebody's getting caught. I'm talking about the
[54:04.540 --> 54:08.300]  butt. I'm almost more interested in knowing who's getting eliminated rather than who's winning.
[54:08.300 --> 54:13.340]  So you like number two? You like number two. So far is definitely. I'm going to test the water
[54:13.340 --> 54:16.860]  activity and all. We're going to give it a burn. I haven't done the dry pull yet. So first you guys
[54:16.860 --> 54:20.060]  are going to all smoke it. And then I'm going to test the AW on it and then take a look at what's
[54:20.060 --> 54:24.140]  going to be the freshest and what's got the more moisture content. What has the least. It's not
[54:24.140 --> 54:29.500]  blowing me out of the water, but it's definitely gassy. Oh, there we go. Number two. Maybe it was
[54:29.500 --> 54:33.980]  just a mint to my mouth. I think we eliminated jar number two somewhere else. There you go.
[54:33.980 --> 54:38.220]  I'm going to smoke that right now. So that's jar number two. Well, I'm going to stay tuned.
[54:39.500 --> 54:42.860]  You know where I'm going? We're going to go smoke number two.
[54:45.020 --> 54:47.980]  We got Corey from Mood Cannabis here.
[54:49.820 --> 54:54.220]  This is the Mood team here. They're in the mood. That's right. Yeah. I didn't see a car.
[54:55.020 --> 54:59.420]  There you go. Whereabouts are you from? Vancouver Island.
[55:02.380 --> 55:07.660]  That's number two. Is that a good flavor? Yeah. Okay, cool.
[55:09.660 --> 55:13.340]  I didn't know you were allowed. I thought they were handing jars back. I was going to take one.
[55:13.340 --> 55:17.020]  You guys are rolling out of them. I would just roll a couple of fatties. Rolling fatties. That's
[55:17.020 --> 55:20.700]  what we're doing at this table. Table five. I can go into that table and look at the back jars over
[55:20.700 --> 55:24.300]  there. One thing I should mention is we do have the Retail Cannabis Council at BC here today,
[55:24.300 --> 55:28.460]  along with the BC Craft Farmers Co-op. Two great organizations that are really advancing
[55:28.460 --> 55:33.100]  the interest of the whole industry. I've been working away for a very long time since I remember.
[55:33.100 --> 55:37.740]  Thanks, bro. Yeah, man. Like eight years. It feels that way. Yeah. I've been a member of
[55:37.740 --> 55:42.700]  CanCD through Acres all the way up. I served as a director a couple of times and back again.
[55:42.700 --> 55:45.820]  2012, 2013. Thanks, bro. Yeah. Back at well, 14.
[55:46.620 --> 55:49.900]  14? 15? Yeah, around there. I remember seeing you in 2012, 2013.
[55:49.900 --> 55:52.700]  I smoked weed. That's for sure. That's what it was. He's always coming by.
[55:52.700 --> 55:56.540]  But the Retail Cannabis Council at BC is doing some great initiatives on Farmgate,
[55:56.540 --> 56:00.940]  on on-site consumption, on the whole tourism angle. Which I think in British Columbia is
[56:00.940 --> 56:05.180]  going to be tremendous. I went out to Dunn Farms, hung out with Logan and the team there, and
[56:05.180 --> 56:10.060]  they got the kind of venue that would draw, create that kind of economic development and that
[56:10.060 --> 56:15.580]  destigmatization that we need from a wider consumer base that travels to Canada for cannabis or other
[56:15.580 --> 56:19.580]  things and can really get exposed, much like the wine industry, to something that's absolutely
[56:19.580 --> 56:23.820]  tremendous. So you see this a forthcoming bigger industry moving forward? It'll be billions of
[56:23.820 --> 56:28.860]  dollars. I love what you're talking about. I mean, Dunn Cannabis has one of those venues that's
[56:28.860 --> 56:34.140]  accessible. It's not way out. They have infrastructure that can accommodate and host
[56:34.140 --> 56:38.300]  people through. And the team's very open and informed about the whole production process.
[56:38.300 --> 56:40.380]  Where are the Dunn Cannabis people? There's Logan right there.
[56:40.380 --> 56:42.700]  Is that Logan? You own a fatty too? I think he is.
[56:42.700 --> 56:44.780]  Well, I think we got to go and talk to him. Absolutely do.
[56:44.780 --> 56:46.140]  You're next on the list. All right.
[56:46.300 --> 56:52.300]  Oh, wait, I did. Now I got two mics. Oh, he's rolling another one. Well, here we go. I'm just
[56:52.300 --> 56:57.260]  like walking right over here to the mound, apparently. Oh, you know, I get to hand you
[56:57.260 --> 57:02.540]  a microphone. There you go. I'm hearing so much great things about Dunn Cannabis. And I think
[57:02.540 --> 57:04.140]  we've met in the past, haven't we? We have, yeah.
[57:04.140 --> 57:06.060]  Yeah. And I've been trying to make it out to your place.
[57:06.060 --> 57:07.580]  Yeah. And I live around the corner.
[57:07.580 --> 57:10.140]  You got to come. And I have no reason why I haven't come
[57:10.140 --> 57:13.900]  there because now they're talking about what I've always been talking about, tourism and stuff like
[57:13.900 --> 57:18.380]  that and promoting what you guys are doing so much. And hearing so much about you and being
[57:18.380 --> 57:23.420]  just in the same town and not being able to really get myself to come over there. I don't know why.
[57:23.420 --> 57:28.060]  It's my fault. It's not yours. I haven't reached out and say, you know, I'd love to come over and
[57:28.060 --> 57:32.700]  take a look and see exactly what you're doing and just be able to showcase exactly even with the
[57:32.700 --> 57:37.340]  future cannabis project. And if you haven't already, talk about more about what you guys
[57:37.340 --> 57:39.340]  are doing in the industry. Oh, we love it. Like,
[57:39.980 --> 57:43.020]  it's we were one of the newer micro like on the block.
[57:43.020 --> 57:44.460]  Yeah. I remember right in the beginning that.
[57:44.460 --> 57:49.100]  Initially we were licensed early on in this system. And so we've really kind of been.
[57:49.100 --> 57:52.300]  Let me bring this up to here. Yeah. Just a little bit closer just in case.
[57:52.300 --> 57:57.180]  So we've been learning as we go. You know what I mean? And we've been able to like share that
[57:57.180 --> 57:59.420]  knowledge with other micros. Nice.
[57:59.420 --> 58:03.740]  We've been able to, you know, like help people not stumble in certain areas where.
[58:04.460 --> 58:07.020]  So you're giving back is what you're saying. Oh, absolutely.
[58:07.020 --> 58:10.620]  Like it. Where do you see your company going for the future right now?
[58:10.620 --> 58:15.500]  Well, we have a partnership with Bazaam and that allows us to really focus on cultivation.
[58:15.500 --> 58:18.140]  Yeah. And just put all our energy into making
[58:18.140 --> 58:22.780]  sure that the flower hitting the market, not just for our brand, but for theirs as well,
[58:22.780 --> 58:28.860]  is just top notch, you know, and when you're doing all of the, all of the things in the industry that
[58:28.860 --> 58:34.140]  it requires, it's difficult when you work with a small team, you know, and as micros, we're all
[58:34.140 --> 58:38.140]  relatively small. What would you say is what's working really well for your company?
[58:38.700 --> 58:42.780]  Um, I just, I just think that the synergy, like we all have the right headspace.
[58:42.780 --> 58:45.260]  Yeah. We all are, uh, want to be better.
[58:45.260 --> 58:50.780]  We want to advance. We want to use new technology. We want to find the new, new strains and,
[58:50.780 --> 58:54.060]  and the stuff that's hot and just. So new strains, new advancements,
[58:54.060 --> 58:58.300]  like everybody's looking for that new thing. So, I mean, this is a quick little interview
[58:58.300 --> 59:01.820]  because I want to talk to you more, but you know, quickly, what's not working in the industry right
[59:01.820 --> 59:05.100]  now? You know, I think that retailers are having difficult time.
[59:05.100 --> 59:11.260]  Okay. Micros particularly are having a difficult time with the exercise thing. I know that's a big
[59:11.260 --> 59:15.580]  topic nowadays. I don't know if they're ever really going to make a change on that. You know,
[59:15.580 --> 59:17.740]  You're seeing a lot of retail problems, what you're saying.
[59:17.740 --> 59:23.420]  Yeah. You know, it's, it's not just like being able to like get products, uh, to the end user
[59:24.300 --> 59:28.300]  quick enough. Right. It's, it's like, I'm hearing this gap of like, I bought,
[59:28.300 --> 59:33.180]  seen this stuff from John, seven acres, a friend, and he goes, go down and buy some.
[59:33.340 --> 59:37.820]  It was a year old. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild. So, so it's wild to hear this. And then from a, from,
[59:37.820 --> 59:42.940]  from a, from a manufacturer like self as in a micro breaking into this industry. I mean,
[59:42.940 --> 59:46.460]  what do you see? What, what, what do you see? What's the solve on this? How are we going to
[59:46.460 --> 59:51.740]  fix this then? I think it really is like focusing on small batch and out hitting your, your lots
[59:52.300 --> 59:56.700]  to multiple provinces and stab all of it. Just a one, you know, you don't want to sell it,
[59:56.700 --> 01:00:02.700]  obviously, but like letting it all drop on BCs, probably an error in freshness. It's an error in
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:08.220]  batch timelines and stuff, you know, as we just evenly distributed throughout Canada, like the
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:14.460]  rest of Canada, that we can have fresh product on the market or regularly. You know, I, I know
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.020]  that's going to be a big, big thing for the future is getting that freshness, like farm market to the
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.100]  farmers. Like when we can go to a farmer's market and that's what I know what a lot of the retail
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:27.660]  cannabis has been doing. And some of the stuff that Andy's been working with and Roji and myself
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:31.980]  for the last couple of decades, people like, like London here and everybody else is like
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.380]  striving for these great things, but it's great to hear it from you. I want to ask you just a few
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.780]  couple of questions, get you thinking, get the audience thinking and knowing what we tackle
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.340]  every day. People think it's easy and it's not, and it's, and it's a hard business, but at the
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:51.500]  same time, it's a rewarding and it's fulfilling. Man. It's so, when you see the smile on people's,
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:55.980]  look, look at this event, look at everybody like around the jars of weed. And like, you don't see
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.820]  people around bottles of Scotch having this much fun. They're normally falling over. And
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.380]  then we used to like the Scotch, but I mean, they're smiling. Look at them. They're happy.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.180]  Some of it, I don't know which one's my flower. We have some, we have an entry, right? So nice.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:13.340]  But if, if they're smiling because that guy's making them smile or we're like,
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.420]  well, I picked out like a number four for gassy. I'm a gas guy. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:21.660]  I'm a valley grower. I've been growing for 30 years. So I understand that kind of,
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.300]  I know where you kind of are. I probably be smelling you driving down the freeway a few times.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.500]  So that's good to see that coming on. And, and you know what, I really look forward to just,
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.540]  you know, coming over and taking a look, maybe talking with London about that and make, make,
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.380]  make something happen because even taking a look at, I do a lot of stuff with light recipes. I
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:43.980]  don't know if you're running LEDs. Yeah, we're running LEDs now. I just swapped the whole side
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:51.020]  over. What you're running right now. Think real model W. It's, it's really a unique light and it's
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.100]  doing some fascinating things. There you go. Yeah. We're really, really jacked about the new,
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.420]  maybe the show, if you had a chance to even do this little testing with some alias over the
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.100]  reds and show you some differences. Yeah. We can go far red with ours, like full light.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.820]  So they're actually being to dial now. So it's good to see different things. So
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.020]  you know, light recipes are going to be a key in understanding your DLI
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:15.420]  PPFD. And by the sounds of it, you're learning this and understanding it. Yeah. That's awesome.
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:21.100]  And I'm probably pretty sure then you deal with, uh, growing exposed with Justin.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.900]  We do. Yeah. And they've been really, really, really family. They're awesome.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:30.220]  We've been working with them for years and we're just, they support us any way they can along the
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:36.220]  way. And, and, and, uh, I can't think as we're talking, I've seen the episode now, right? So
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.700]  I'm thinking out loud and, and, uh, Jeremy was just by the other day, he was taking some pictures.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:46.140]  So he's, he's a fantastic. So always these other shows and different people that went out there.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.340]  I can, I can talk forever. And London's like, we got it. We got to check out some other stuff.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.660]  Yeah. I've got to go smoke some flower. It's smoke time.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.140]  Yeah. Yeah. Like we're able to drive to you. I do, I do Tuesday tours,
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.620]  week for everything from like the largest product facility in North America to like
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.820]  do growing weed in his closet. And if you buy it, like we do, we do everybody.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.740]  So we'd love to have you on and we can, we can go back.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:17.660]  Of course. Yeah. No, we should do some more of this stuff like that because, you know,
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:22.300]  we're bringing the industry out and showing you what's going on and, and, and actually just,
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.060]  you know, bring it to light with a lot of people that we all follow and people were involved with.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.380]  Some of us got to step up and say, Hey, this is where the product is now. This is the reality.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:38.300]  When I can go to, to, to, to a store and buy three grams of blueberry wedding cake,
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:45.020]  I bought Cush and about Barbara, but all three Roslins all for under 50 bucks legally at home
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:51.260]  package sitting there safe and sound. Shit. It was like $171 with tax. And you know what?
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.100]  That's ice Bay, 150 bucks for a gram. I know. It's great.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:01.340]  So I'm pretty stoked to see the industry moving forward. It's what we, we get there. And it's
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.060]  great to see you putting in that effort for us too. And you know, let's get out of the smoke,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.540]  let's get out of here. We'll see you out there.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.620]  You just keep going live. Don't you?
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.260]  Well, I mean, we can, we can, we can do that.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.300]  I think we're going to take a short break here, everybody and have a consumption moment. We will
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.540]  move a camera around, put it outside so you can see it. But we'll be right back with you.
[01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:30.990]  Flower grading number two. Johnny, make sure that Mike's off for me.

[01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:35.450]  So I did just...
[01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:41.870]  It's really, really delicious.
[01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:47.470]  And in general, everything's going out really, really well here. Everybody's having a lot of
[01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:51.790]  great feedback through the flower. And honestly, it's delicious. It's done really, really well.
[01:18:52.910 --> 01:19:00.270]  I'm very impressed. We're looking at having our speakers panel coming up next with some of our
[01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:06.270]  OGs, which is going to be very exciting. We're going to have Marcus coming on shortly to join us,
[01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.510]  as well as a lot of other fantastic human beings. Hopefully you're not getting too much
[01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:18.590]  background feedback noise, but this should be a fun day as well. Don't miss out. Check it out
[01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:24.430]  on all the networks and all the places and all the things. I'm fucking high, man. I've got good weed.
[01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:27.790]  I'm going to smoke more of that. And then I'm going to try some
[01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.990]  hash and extracts pretty soon here. I think it's pretty important to dig into that stuff.
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:38.830]  But we got to get an intermary period for the guys to start the show. So we'll let them get that rolling.
[01:19:40.590 --> 01:24:20.460]  Okay, so I hope the first talk was good. Yeah. All right. So next is a panel.
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:27.580]  Next is a panel discussion on quality. So we are going to be bringing the growers up on stage.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:35.260]  And today we have Sabine Schwartz. She is an amazing, incredible human being that is going
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:42.220]  to be leading the discussion. And she comes with deep roots in the cannabis community. She's here
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:48.540]  to really preserve and bring forth the community in terms of, hey, what is it about the cannabis
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:56.620]  consumer that makes them special and what unites all of us? So Sabine, she will be joined with
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:04.300]  Logan. He is the master grower for Dunn Cannabis. And we also had Johnny B. Johnny B, I know you're
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:10.940]  flying around. There he is. And so Johnny B, he is an incredible, he's a legend in the industry.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:17.580]  He's been growing for well over 20, maybe 30 years. He's overcome so many challenges in terms of his
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:23.820]  personal life and physical and health, but he's one of the most motivational, inspirational people
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:32.380]  that I've ever met. And he's the founder of Medtainer, which is the best, right? I love
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:40.140]  the Medtainer. So it's amazing that he's made a huge impact in this industry to help people
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:47.260]  spread the goodness of cannabis. So please welcome Sabine Shorts. She is the marketing
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:54.300]  manager from Bazam Cannabis. Logan, I don't know his last name, but he's the master grower for Dunn.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:26:40.370]  And Johnny B, up onto the stage, please. And does that work? That works pretty well.
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:46.210]  Hey, guys. How are you? They got us really stoned. And then they just put us up here and they want us
[01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:51.090]  to talk now. He's like, oh yeah, when we were talking and freaking out a little bit. We got to put the
[01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:59.650]  microphone up here. Okay. There you go. So standardization, freshness. You guys find any
[01:26:59.650 --> 01:27:03.170]  really fresh weed out there? You guys pretty happy right now with those jars that you were going
[01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:12.050]  through? Everybody? Yeah? Is it good? Yeah? We get like, yeah, the weed's awesome. A high five. We get
[01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:18.530]  up there and like, do we like it or was it crappy? There you go. We have somebody likes it.
[01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:22.690]  We need to hear it. Like, well, they're pretty stoned. Look at everybody's just kind of looking
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:28.290]  at us. They're like, wow. We can get some flashing lights behind us. Maybe you can get some more
[01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:35.090]  attention. Right? Yeah. So, I mean, you've been growing for quite some time. Yeah. I've been
[01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:41.810]  growing for over 20 years. To clarify, I no longer am the master grower over there, but we
[01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:48.450]  we run the show. So it's years and years of experience that we're all sharing with people
[01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:56.770]  that work with us now at Dunn. And yeah, we continue to thrive on and add more people to
[01:27:56.770 --> 01:28:02.290]  our team and teach them what we've learned over years and years. And we're sharing that info with
[01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:07.810]  our partners and our friends and guys in the industry. They're new. So yeah, it's just.
[01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:12.530]  When we were sitting here talking and before we knew we had a panel together, because we actually
[01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:16.930]  were talking, sitting on the side over here where you guys are all smoking and we were discussing
[01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:20.050]  what we're about to talk about right now. It's like, shit, we just talked about this for the
[01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:25.970]  last 20 minutes without even knowing we had a panel. But actually looking at, I mean, everything
[01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:30.210]  that we're smoking right now is really comes down to the grower. It looks like standardization and
[01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:34.930]  freshness and be able to bring that product properly to the market. So if your consumers are
[01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:39.490]  getting that quality product that we're looking at and that's why you bug tenders and people are
[01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:43.810]  trying to learn more about the quality. But it really comes down to the growers and then actually
[01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:50.370]  educating everybody on the aspects of, you know, the growing process. Was it grown with LEDs? Is
[01:28:50.370 --> 01:28:57.490]  it organically grown? Is it salt? Was it hung dry? Is it is it dehydrated? Is it a two week hang?
[01:28:57.490 --> 01:29:01.810]  Is it like there's all of these questions that are really not being discussed as you guys are
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:06.450]  learning out the bud from what you're having right now. And you know what? I'd love to start asking
[01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.810]  some questions with some of the people out here when we get a little bit further in this talk.
[01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:14.690]  But I mean, there's all these little aspects of growing that are playing a key role in the end
[01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:19.730]  consumer, even from making the hash when Mark and he's going to pick up his products. I mean,
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:25.330]  he's looking forward to the grower that's got that that that most dankest best bud. And I know a lot
[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:30.210]  of people out there are looking for those growers. So I mean, as in bud tenders, do you guys know
[01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:35.250]  who your growers who's growing the cannabis? Do you ask these questions? Can we ask these questions?
[01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:40.210]  Because I'm kind of curious right now. I don't know the legal industry that well, but I could
[01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:45.650]  tell you that I know cannabis extremely well. It's like a passion of mine. It's what I love.
[01:29:45.650 --> 01:29:49.970]  It's something I get up to and I look forward to growing it or consuming it or being able to
[01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:54.690]  actually educate myself more on it and learning more about it and learning about the industry and
[01:29:54.690 --> 01:30:01.570]  how it's changing and where we're adapting to new flavors and just new ways of how cannabis
[01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:06.370]  is being grown, which is really a key way of looking at how it's being consumed at the same
[01:30:06.370 --> 01:30:13.090]  time. So I mean, how do you feel about the new ways that we're talking about LEDs? You guys know,
[01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:18.770]  like if you're if your cannabis that you're consuming is LED grown or HDI grown, or if it's
[01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:24.450]  salt driven or if it's organic, I mean, should we ask you for this on the bottles more? I got all
[01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:29.570]  kinds of good questions for you guys. Yeah, I mean, I think the retailers have an open
[01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:33.330]  communication for the most part with a lot of growers where they can ask questions and get
[01:30:33.330 --> 01:30:39.970]  answers. We're here to help answer any of those that you guys have or don't know or want to know
[01:30:39.970 --> 01:30:46.050]  what's coming, what's available now, what's fresh, what's new and exciting. So we're happy
[01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:51.890]  to answer anything we can answer for you via social or direct message or whatever.
[01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:59.890]  So I guess I mean, I would love to ask some questions with some of you guys out there that
[01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:05.170]  was just kind of curious on what you feel is the standard. Yeah, you're gonna she's gonna my
[01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:14.330]  microphone. All right. Well, thank you both for starting off. So yeah, it's just Yeah,
[01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:20.730]  thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what do you guys see? I mean, as in bud tenders out there,
[01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:24.330]  when you're consuming products, you're getting products to sale me what are your number one?
[01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:27.850]  What is the number one question that your consumer is asking you when they come into the
[01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:32.170]  store? I mean, like, what are they looking at? We're looking at freshness standardization,
[01:31:32.170 --> 01:31:36.490]  we're looking at quality. So I mean, where's the quality? What are you guys seeing out there?
[01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:41.050]  And what quality are your consumers looking for? I mean, that's kind of what we're kind of talking
[01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:45.850]  about. That's I think, what we're asked here to talk about was quality and freshness, and how you
[01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:53.210]  guys are actually grading your weed, grading your bud and what you feel about it. People are pretty
[01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:57.610]  sure anyone raised a hand and share no one wants to raise your hand. That's okay. I have a question
[01:31:57.610 --> 01:32:02.330]  actually for both of you. And for the group, if anybody wants to, I guess, like the room in general,
[01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:07.530]  how much do you actually think like normal consumers every day actually know about like
[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:11.370]  the freshness of their weed and how they would even know what fresh looks like?
[01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:13.930]  Like, do you think they know? Like, what do you think they know?
[01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:23.970]  A lot of our consumers asking for package dates, but I think something we'd like to see is harvest
[01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:30.850]  dates as well. Okay, so packaging. So let's talk about packaging. You know, this is a good subject,
[01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:34.210]  because I've actually gone through a lot of packaging. We were talking about this briefly,
[01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:39.570]  how I have like, literally a box, I was going to bring it of so much different packaging over the
[01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:45.250]  last couple years, last four years of legalization. And the packaging has just been all over the
[01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:51.570]  place. I mean, packaging big deal. It's probably the most, it's probably the most expensive cost
[01:32:51.570 --> 01:32:58.210]  of the cannabis you're selling. Yeah, we've had a couple different things. We started off in glass,
[01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:03.650]  then we went to bags and we're bouncing around a little bit trying to find.
[01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:09.890]  Yeah, we have the tunic and to yeah, what's what the consumer really resonates with for the most
[01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:17.410]  part. Obviously, what's earth friendly to that's a big deal. And I know people like glass and
[01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:22.050]  everything else like that. But it's, it's, you know, I don't mind spending money on glass, if
[01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:26.290]  that's what everybody wanted. But I always think about how much we're really doing when it comes to
[01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:32.450]  recycling and being able to recycle and stuff. So transport costs, that's a big thing. When it comes
[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:37.490]  to packaging, you're doing a lot of packing with, you know, heavy, heavy merchant, and it's going
[01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:42.210]  Ontario, it's going to cost you a lot of money. So something to think about for sure. But it really
[01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:47.810]  just comes down to what the consumer resonates with most and what the retailers like to see. And
[01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:53.810]  you guys are sort of our soundboard to give us that info to make us better to improve.
[01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:59.330]  You know, the way we do things and, and what it should look like.
[01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:05.570]  Yeah, you guys are like the voice like I know back in the days, there was a lot of group of us with
[01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:13.410]  signs out, screaming and doing protesting and a lot of stuff. And now you have legalization. So
[01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:17.810]  the voice is different. It's coming from the stores and from the bud tenders. And they're
[01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:23.570]  actually actually educating, hopefully, on those ends being able to actually guide this system. But
[01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:28.530]  I have seen a change. I'm seeing more different concentrates on the market. I mean, as the as the
[01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:32.370]  industry is changing, we're seeing better Canada's we're seeing better consumption,
[01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:37.250]  pistol in Paris. Yeah, I've seen some really good, really good cannabis out there lately. I'm
[01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:42.770]  actually saying thank you. I'm pretty in getting impressed with the way things are coming out
[01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:48.450]  packaging is always going to be a hard thing because it's pricing. It really comes down to
[01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:53.890]  the cost of that package. And then how companies are cutting different costs where their money's
[01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:59.970]  being spent. And I think a lot of people don't like a standard beer bottle like there is in the
[01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:04.930]  beer industry or the wine industry, their basic same couple bottles, right? With cannabis, you
[01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:10.770]  got so many different packaging. So it's like, what's keeping it fresh? Oh, people don't know me
[01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:15.250]  for me, I standardized everything with Boveda because it's standardized and it keeps it at the
[01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:22.130]  same water activity level. Have this nice little meter in my hand. This tests all the water activity
[01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:26.610]  inside your container and tells you exactly how much water is keeping that cannabis fresh.
[01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:31.810]  And with a lot of the packaging out there, you're seeing that deplete pretty quickly. I've seen
[01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:38.210]  different seals on how the cannabis is drying out very quickly. I've seen AW levels at 33. That's
[01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:43.090]  as dry as popcorn. Like cannabis that goes to dust and they're selling it on the legal market.
[01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:47.810]  So I mean, that's a problem. And then when you guys see that coming into your stores,
[01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:54.690]  can you return it? If not, why are we not being able to return dry ass cannabis? I got a lot of
[01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:59.650]  weed I've been trying to return. They won't take it back. Any other industry, they take it back. I
[01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:03.970]  can send back stuff to Costco, use it for two years and bring it back and they take it back.
[01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:09.250]  But I mean, it's up to the, I mean, what's going on in the industry. What I see is some of this
[01:36:09.250 --> 01:36:13.570]  cannabis has to be returned. It's got to be put back on the government and say, you know, it's
[01:36:13.570 --> 01:36:17.650]  been sitting for two years and you sent it to us to sell to a consumer that ain't going to buy it.
[01:36:18.370 --> 01:36:21.810]  Because I've talked to other store owners and they're sitting on weed, they can't return.
[01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:26.770]  So I'm kind of curious on when we can do about that too, right? Because I mean, when you get
[01:36:26.770 --> 01:36:32.450]  dry weed that people aren't buying, Mark, he's going to get up here. Yeah, let's talk. This guy
[01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:36.930]  knows more about this, what's going on. You just made a good point. What I wanted to speak about
[01:36:36.930 --> 01:36:41.730]  specifically was we're talking about packaging. We're talking about water activity. What happens
[01:36:41.730 --> 01:36:48.130]  when you package volatile organic compounds like terpenes and thiols and esters is they
[01:36:48.130 --> 01:36:54.530]  volatilize and they create pressure and they're also solvents so they can consume the glue on the
[01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:59.090]  top of the packaging, microfissures that you don't even see with the naked eye and they're creating
[01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:03.170]  pressure. So they're blasting out and they're bringing in oxygen and they're drying up that
[01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:10.690]  weed. This isn't a packaging problem. It's a supply chain problem. You need to keep the product
[01:37:11.250 --> 01:37:18.370]  cold. It's like lettuce or spinach. It needs to be cold all the time, not just the drinks.
[01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:24.530]  If you don't keep these products cold, they volatilize and they disappear. These things
[01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:30.770]  are extremely unstable and this is the problem that we're shipping cannabis to, you know, I keep
[01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:36.610]  my hash at minus 20 degrees Celsius the whole time it's at my facility. Then some guy picks it up in
[01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:41.570]  his truck and unless I've paid an exorbitant amount of money it's not staying cold and even if I do
[01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:47.250]  pay that money there's no reason because once it gets to the OCS or the BCLDB, guess what? They don't
[01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:53.570]  care. They're just basically shipping spinach warm across the country and then we're getting stuck
[01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:58.530]  with the RTVs when people are like, oh this hash doesn't look like the picture. I think you did a
[01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:05.010]  bait and switch. It's like, no it sat at the OCS for at 32 degrees Celsius for three days because
[01:38:05.010 --> 01:38:10.850]  there was a barcode issue. We need to figure out the supply chain and we need to keep this product
[01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:18.450]  cold. Thank you. I am so excited if you guys have not submitted your feedback for Health Canada's
[01:38:19.650 --> 01:38:25.330]  Cannabis Act redo or update, you definitely should so we can start to see these changes. But I think
[01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:30.930]  what I was thinking and I think for like the folks in the room too, if we were going back to like
[01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:34.450]  what consumers know, what they don't know and I think like the note earlier about
[01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:38.370]  a packaging date versus harvest dates also really, really important and interesting because
[01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:44.050]  the distance between harvest, like what happens after harvest, like really, really impacts what
[01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:52.690]  the freshness does like long term. I've had cannabis hang for five or six months and then
[01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:57.570]  Mark did some stuff he thought was, he even said this is fresh so it comes down to the curing.
[01:38:57.570 --> 01:39:01.810]  That's exactly it, the curing. Yeah, totally. If you keep it at those temperatures, I keep my
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:08.050]  stuff at 55, 60 degrees at 67% relative humidity and I can keep that weed for a year or two and
[01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:12.050]  it's fine. It's like having your wine. So it's how you store it. It's exactly what he's talking
[01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:17.010]  about and it's what I've been preaching for years. So I mean it just comes down to handling and
[01:39:17.010 --> 01:39:22.210]  storage and how it's being actually presented to the end consumer. Even talking with some of the
[01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:26.530]  people from Pistol & Paris, just how that package sits, they stand it up so you can see the label
[01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:30.850]  but then the resin's coming out of the lid and it's sticking in the middle. So it's even how it's
[01:39:30.850 --> 01:39:36.210]  presented on the shelf and how it's being, so you got to keep it this way. So it should stay this side
[01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:41.490]  up. So there's all these little things that are coming into play that I mean at the end of the day
[01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:45.890]  you guys can actually be the voice that's going back to all of the people that need to hear it
[01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:52.210]  because in the reality, I guess the patient or the activist, they don't really listen to us.
[01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:57.250]  I think the interesting point about liquor though and I think like you've done, you were talking
[01:39:57.250 --> 01:40:01.970]  about doing a year-long one and like I don't think the curing is necessarily, like the length doesn't
[01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:06.130]  necessarily always matter to the freshness. No, no it doesn't. It is important but like you did a year-long one.
[01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:12.450]  Yeah. And that was weird. Yeah, it was wild. Oh yeah. I mean the package stays important for the provinces
[01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:16.290]  because they want to see, you know, they want to see when they date it, when it goes in.
[01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:22.290]  Well here, this is the other thing that Mark made very mention too is when they made his hash
[01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:26.450]  and he was found, they shipped it to Richmond. It sat outside in a container that went to 80 degrees,
[01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:31.250]  90 degrees, everything melted. So even when I bought stuff from CoLab Project, it was beautiful
[01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:35.250]  the first time. The second time, it went through summer and I bought it, it was oil in a jar.
[01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:41.010]  It wasn't their fault, you know what I mean? So I mean at the same time, they're keeping it cold now
[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:48.370]  but I mean this is all education that we're slowly, in 2018 it was a shit storm. So at least we're
[01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:53.810]  getting better, you know? We just keep moving along but it's the voices and the people and how they
[01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:58.930]  speak and how we get that information back to the people that can actually hopefully make the changes.
[01:40:58.930 --> 01:41:03.090]  Which is your CEOs, which is the owner of the companies because they're the ones who can make
[01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:06.210]  the call. They're the ones who can make the difference. They're the ones who can actually
[01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:10.210]  step up and say, okay we're going to do it this way. Maybe we'll take a little hurt or whatever
[01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:14.130]  it's going to cost but I mean at the end of the day, you're going to get a better return.
[01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:19.810]  Totally, yeah. I mean I also think that it's really important when it comes to
[01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:26.290]  the actual harvest times to realize that if you have a brand that you guys like and that you enjoy
[01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:33.330]  and they're small batch, they tend to be the better product. You know, there's smaller
[01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:39.250]  quantities of it. So it's getting distributed properly across Canada. You're just going to have
[01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:45.810]  better product at the end of the day regardless of if the stamp says, you know, August 1 or
[01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:51.250]  whatever, right? What's the turnaround time from when done cannabis crops and when it gets to the
[01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:55.650]  end user, when he gets to the store? What's your turnaround time? It's, you know, we were always
[01:41:55.650 --> 01:41:59.570]  about like pushing it and making it really, really quick but that kind of took away from that cure
[01:41:59.570 --> 01:42:06.850]  time. Okay. So we found that by slowing that part of it down, the full turnaround from harvest is
[01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:14.210]  in my opinion, two months is a good time from the day you harvest, you know, then you're hanging for
[01:42:14.210 --> 01:42:18.690]  two to three weeks which we do in the dark and we, you know, sweat in and out and we just get
[01:42:18.690 --> 01:42:24.450]  that moisture content perfect, hand trim it all, then it goes into cure in the cold, cold rooms
[01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:30.210]  and stuff and it takes time for that stuff to even out and balance out properly. People can go
[01:42:31.410 --> 01:42:36.450]  substantially longer, right? And you have a water activity meter, right? Yeah, we don't have water.
[01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:42.690]  I get to come visit. I get to come visit. You know, I was just kind of curious because education
[01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:46.850]  is the key and so once hopefully they have it on the bottle one day when it's, you know, we know
[01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:51.890]  what's going on and, you know, that's just more time and like Mark's saying, it's got to be
[01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:57.170]  properly transported like lettuce, like fresh, like fresh produce. It is live. It's something
[01:42:57.170 --> 01:43:02.530]  that we're consuming. It's a live product. Yeah, we're doing live rosin right now. Right? So
[01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:07.410]  everything we're doing is fresh and it's keeping it fresh and it's that understanding that
[01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:13.970]  when we get different products and you're going to find that patients are going to want or I always
[01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:19.010]  say patients because we're all patients by the way. Just what I say like cannabis is a medicine.
[01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:23.730]  We should all consume it. It should be in your Cheerios. If anybody has any questions,
[01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:28.210]  I think that we have a hard 3.30 here. Oh, we're getting kicked off the stage. You guys are awesome.
[01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:30.930]  We have a hard 3.30 stop because we got to move on. Thank you, Logan.
[01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:36.530]  Thank you, Mark. If anyone has a question, we can bring it. Everyone feel good? If not,
[01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:41.330]  we're going to be outside smoking joints. So you can also ask us questions during that time period.
[01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:47.330]  I promise. Yeah, great. Thanks so much. I was gonna say we could talk about like
[01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:52.370]  different types of consumption like like rosin is so interesting because it is being flash frozen
[01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:55.090]  and like what the value or the difference is, but I think we're out of time.
[01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:02.770]  These are all the retailers and like you guys are what make our business successful. You know,
[01:44:03.330 --> 01:44:07.330]  what do you guys do? We appreciate it all. Yeah, thank you. A whole bunch of different people in
[01:44:07.330 --> 01:44:13.490]  here. What you guys do for the industry. Thank you so much for all of your efforts and feedback,
[01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:17.650]  you know, to make us better and everything else. You guys are... You look around and see all these
[01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:21.570]  people four years ago would all went to jail for sitting here and doing what they're doing in a
[01:44:21.570 --> 01:44:25.490]  sense because I mean, come on, this is a legal industry and you guys got awesome jobs. You can
[01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:31.890]  sell cannabis and you can talk to people who love what they come in. I mean, congratulations and
[01:44:31.890 --> 01:44:36.050]  thank you guys for all the hard work you do in here and get outside and smoke some more weed.
[01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:42.050]  Have a good time. Keep doing what you love doing and always, you know, education is the key and
[01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:55.750]  puff and pass. Thanks, everybody. Go smoke some. Oh, wait, Julie's coming. She's running. Wait a
[01:44:55.750 --> 01:45:02.550]  second. Don't go anywhere. I can see the full sprint. Here she comes. Here she comes. Here she
[01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:11.990]  comes. We're right on time for you. Wait a second. Oh, she has a gift. Someone's winning something.
[01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:17.590]  Well, Jeff's going to come up here too. I hope everybody's really enjoying themselves. How was
[01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:27.830]  the food? The food was good. Yeah, there we go. Jeff, this one's for you. Thank you so much,
[01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:33.670]  Logan. Thank you so much, John. Thank you so much, Sabine. That was a great conversation.
[01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:38.310]  Isn't that interesting? I thought that quality was going to be something that was related to
[01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:45.830]  the growing medium or what food you feed it. But we're talking about supply chain, right? It's
[01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:53.910]  preserving all the hard work that the grower does so that that plant is exactly what you're
[01:45:53.910 --> 01:46:01.830]  consuming at the end. So supply chain. Interesting. Okay, so before we head on to our flower grading
[01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:10.630]  number two, I have Jeff here from Borrowed Beyond. Like I said, his artwork and his pieces
[01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:20.310]  are the gold standard. And he specializes in dab rigs. So with his generosity, he's issuing a
[01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:25.270]  really great door prize. So this is door prize number one. And other prizes are going to be
[01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:31.670]  coming along the way. So please tell me about this item. Thank you. So for those of you who
[01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:37.750]  don't know us, we have the table in the back there with the sweet glass pieces. So we supply a lot of
[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:44.950]  cannabis retailers and we do wholesale and retail of things like glass, of course, but also these
[01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:50.790]  quartz bangers that you put on a bong or any kind of piece that you have super high quality. And it
[01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:56.470]  allows you to take dabs, any kind of concentrates you have. And we're going to draw a winner for
[01:46:56.470 --> 01:47:03.430]  this one. And Julie here is going to tell me who wins this and they can come up onto the stage and
[01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:09.750]  collect their prize. Okay, so the winner is Christina Redlin.
[01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:13.590]  Christina, come on.
[01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:23.110]  Congratulations. And this is made out of like all quartz, right? Yes. Like the whole thing. So the
[01:47:23.110 --> 01:47:28.470]  pieces are made out of glass and then you want to be dabbing off of quartz because it's a super
[01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:38.310]  like pure material to be taking dabs off of. And congratulations. And do you dab yourself?
[01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:43.190]  I have just started in the last couple months. Well, that's perfect. You have the perfect
[01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:48.390]  thing to get started with. And congratulations. And thanks for coming out.
[01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:51.110]  Wonderful. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you.
[01:47:52.710 --> 01:48:00.710]  Okay, so moving on, we can get our lights on. Thank you, Andy. If we now we're going to go onto
[01:48:00.710 --> 01:48:10.710]  our second jar. So same thing. You can assess the flower, grade it. We're going to do the timing for
[01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:16.310]  the second flower just a little bit tighter. Okay, I'm going to give you 20 minutes. We're
[01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:24.630]  going to do 20 minutes, which is should be sufficient. Okay, so let's get real professional here and grade
[01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:31.270]  the flower. So as a reminder, your entire table should be grading the same flower in this instance.
[01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:37.590]  And if you roll the joint from the first flower, you can kind of do a cross comparison. All right.
[01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:47.190]  But yeah, we're focused on the second flower. And let's target to be back by four o'clock. Okay,
[01:48:47.190 --> 01:49:43.780]  thanks. This song was inspired by the future cannabis project was being instrumental in the
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:49.780]  revolution and dedicated to his fuel. Special Merit goes out to the Peter Safari, Brandon,

[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:41.120]  I guess I'll wait and find out how it ends up scoring.
[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:45.120]  So, I just want to introduce our next speaker.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:48.120]  He is our keynote speaker.
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:54.120]  Marcus is a very important person to me.
[02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:58.120]  And yes, he's a legend and he's helped pioneer the industry.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:10.120]  My personal connection to him was one day when I was running a dispensary, we did a rebrand and did a basically a relaunch of our dispensary.
[02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:15.120]  So, I just called up all of our vendors and said, hey, you know what, like we'd love to have you participate.
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:17.120]  Is there anything you can do?
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:29.120]  And he himself showed up with all his supplies, items, he gifted a bunch of samples and was right then and there from the start to the end.
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:46.120]  And so, his dedication to being on the ground, assisting small players like myself that was new to the industry, it was just his generosity of sharing his knowledge and his clout.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:51.120]  I got to say, he is one of the most beautiful people I've ever met.
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:58.120]  I spent a number of lunches and afternoons with him and every single time I just can't get enough.
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:04.120]  So, we have a very humble servant of Ja.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:08.120]  And this is Marcus Richardson.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:10.120]  Please give it up.
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:22.330]  Thank you. Yeah, I'll probably sit down here for a little bit.
[02:25:22.330 --> 02:25:23.330]  We'll see what happens.
[02:25:24.330 --> 02:25:27.330]  Oh, I begged her, don't call me a legend.
[02:25:27.330 --> 02:25:29.330]  I'm just a humble servant of Ja.
[02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:31.330]  I'm the legend of nothing.
[02:25:31.330 --> 02:25:37.330]  And if you don't believe it, I'll give you my wife's phone number and she'll confirm everything that I'm suggesting right now.
[02:25:37.330 --> 02:25:40.330]  Yeah, thanks everyone for being here.
[02:25:40.330 --> 02:25:41.330]  This is awesome.
[02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:43.330]  Thanks, Julie and Canna Reps.
[02:25:43.330 --> 02:25:46.330]  Since day one that I met Julie, I loved what she was doing.
[02:25:46.330 --> 02:25:49.330]  I love the idea of sensory science.
[02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:50.330]  It's very important.
[02:25:50.330 --> 02:25:51.330]  We're learning.
[02:25:51.330 --> 02:25:58.330]  We're at a more basic level right now in the cannabis industry, unfortunately, than say from the hops industry.
[02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:03.330]  But we're catching up and we're starting to learn more about these different volatile organic compounds.
[02:26:03.330 --> 02:26:09.330]  And I think events like this where we actually pay attention to the sommelier aspect and trust our olfactory.
[02:26:09.330 --> 02:26:19.330]  The one thing, two things I would suggest when you are doing sensory evaluations of cannabis is learn what your sensitivities are.
[02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:27.330]  So if you have like a sensitivity to D-limonene or a sensitivity to whatever sort of compound, could even be THC.
[02:26:27.330 --> 02:26:35.330]  It's important to take that into account in the way that you evaluate the sensory aspects of cannabis.
[02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:43.330]  The second one would be to, if you have, and if you recognize them, a lot of people don't, but if you have blind spots,
[02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:48.330]  if you have compounds that you can't perceive.
[02:26:48.330 --> 02:26:55.330]  And so understanding what your sensitivities are and the things, the compounds that you can't perceive, you might, you know,
[02:26:55.330 --> 02:26:57.330]  someone might say, oh, this smells like this to me.
[02:26:57.330 --> 02:27:00.330]  And then the person next to them is like, wow, I don't get that at all.
[02:27:00.330 --> 02:27:06.330]  It's like, yeah, well, if they're missing a single thiol that they are unable to perceive,
[02:27:06.330 --> 02:27:11.330]  the compounds would smell very, very differently to them than it would be to you.
[02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:13.330]  So those are good things.
[02:27:13.330 --> 02:27:19.330]  But hats off to Julie and CannaReps for putting on events like this and supporting the front liners, the bud tenders.
[02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:25.330]  You guys are the front liners of our industry, so we definitely have mad respect for what you guys are doing.
[02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:29.330]  And I guess I'll start by just telling everyone a little bit about myself.
[02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:34.330]  I go by Marcus Richardson, a.k.a. the Bubble Man.
[02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:37.330]  Came from Manitoba originally at a very young age.
[02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:39.330]  I think I was 17 or 18.
[02:27:39.330 --> 02:27:43.330]  I decided to become an activist in the cannabis world.
[02:27:43.330 --> 02:27:48.330]  We were in the Bible Belt in Manitoba, so we were like, maybe we'll do like hemp activism.
[02:27:48.330 --> 02:27:55.330]  Yeah, we'll do hemp activism because going to prison with hardcore criminals was not my idea of a good time.
[02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:58.330]  And the prison that we had outside of Winnipeg was very heavy.
[02:27:58.330 --> 02:28:04.330]  Stony Mountain Penitentiary did not want to be going into jail there as a habitual florist.
[02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:05.330]  So I avoided that.
[02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:07.330]  We did our hemp activism.
[02:28:07.330 --> 02:28:11.330]  We got the first hemp field growing in Manitoba in over 73 years.
[02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:13.330]  That was in 1995.
[02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:17.330]  And my partners went on to start the company Manitoba Harvest with the work that we did there.
[02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:21.330]  So you may have purchased those products at the grocery stores or whatnot.
[02:28:21.330 --> 02:28:29.330]  I basically left in 96 from Manitoba, came to British Columbia, hooked up with Hillary Black, a dear friend of mine,
[02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:36.330]  who was just kind of deciding in her life, should I go live in California with this guy that I've fallen in love with
[02:28:36.330 --> 02:28:42.330]  or should I come to Canada, back to Canada and start the BC Compassion Club.
[02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:51.330]  And I watched the BC Compassion Club get kind of created on my living room floor back in 97 while I was living in BC.
[02:28:51.330 --> 02:28:53.330]  And Hillary was really one of the only people I knew.
[02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:56.330]  We had known her from hemp BC, from Mark Emery's place.
[02:28:56.330 --> 02:29:03.330]  And so I immediately became a sort of grower and philanthropist to the BC Compassion Club
[02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:09.330]  because I loved the idea of supporting the most vulnerable people in our society.
[02:29:09.330 --> 02:29:19.330]  People that are not only mentally ill and terminally ill, but also homeless, which is a pretty hardcore trio to be rocking.
[02:29:19.330 --> 02:29:21.330]  Some amazing people that I met back in those days.
[02:29:21.330 --> 02:29:25.330]  And we should all really thank all of them for their pioneering work
[02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:31.330]  because the whole reason we can have an event like this today is based on a lot of the civil disobedience
[02:29:31.330 --> 02:29:34.330]  that Hillary was practicing at the BC Compassion Club.
[02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:36.330]  And that's how medical got into Canada.
[02:29:36.330 --> 02:29:40.330]  And Canada, of course, medical opened the door for federal legalization.
[02:29:40.330 --> 02:29:45.330]  So shout out to Hillary Black and all the good folks at the BC Compassion Club.
[02:29:45.330 --> 02:29:47.330]  I was helping them out a little bit too much.
[02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:53.330]  And at one point, someone was trying to steal all the cannabis out of their safe, trying to steal the safe, actually.
[02:29:53.330 --> 02:30:00.330]  They drove a car right through the front window of a commercial drive store back in 99 or whenever it was, 98.
[02:30:00.330 --> 02:30:05.330]  And so she asked me, can you take this cannabis home? I'm worried it's going to get stolen.
[02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:09.330]  And it was like, I don't know, 17, 16 and a half pounds.
[02:30:09.330 --> 02:30:13.330]  And there was a bit of cash that I just took it home.
[02:30:13.330 --> 02:30:20.330]  And that night I went through a roadblock at the Lionsgate Bridge and got busted with 16 and a half pounds and six grand cash.
[02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:22.330]  So that was fun.
[02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:33.330]  That really changed the sort of course of what I was doing and how I was sort of helping cannabis and the civil disobedience I was practicing.
[02:30:33.330 --> 02:30:43.330]  And that led me to realize I wasn't just going to be able to broker and sell cannabis at the rate that I was doing, which was at a fairly high rate in 97, 98.
[02:30:43.330 --> 02:30:46.330]  And so I needed to come up with something where I could.
[02:30:46.330 --> 02:30:48.330]  I mean, honestly, I'll be honest.
[02:30:48.330 --> 02:30:55.330]  It was my lawyer, John Conroy, who inspired this a great deal because I would give him money like cash in a paper bag.
[02:30:55.330 --> 02:30:58.330]  And that was proceeds of crime if the police caught me with it.
[02:30:58.330 --> 02:31:04.330]  But then he'd take the paper bag to the bank and it was like it was just legal money all of a sudden.
[02:31:04.330 --> 02:31:10.330]  Like he was like literally taking money from all these people in the cannabis industry, putting it in the bank, paying taxes on it.
[02:31:10.330 --> 02:31:15.330]  And it was legal. And I thought, I need to figure out how to do that.
[02:31:15.330 --> 02:31:27.330]  So I started a company called Fresh Headies and I started popularizing these sets of bags that I coined bubble bags, which are the water extraction bags that we'll talk a little bit about today here.
[02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:35.330]  That basically using water and ice, you can isolate the glandular trichome heads of cannabis and in a very pure form.
[02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:39.330]  And we're going to go through some macro photographs and talk about that in a little bit here as well.
[02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:44.330]  So this company was right at the onset of digital cameras.
[02:31:44.330 --> 02:31:52.330]  You know, to give you an idea, the Sony Cybershot in 1999 was a 2.2 megapixel camera, 2 megapixel camera.
[02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:59.330]  That was one of the first digital cameras that you could take pictures of something that was at your home and then upload it onto the Internet.
[02:31:59.330 --> 02:32:10.330]  This was also during a time where cannabis.com, cannabisculture.com, overgrow.com, cannabisworld.com, all of these sites were popping up.
[02:32:10.330 --> 02:32:21.330]  And people who were in the cannabis community, growers and dealers and hash makers and breeders and all of these different people were suddenly like brave enough.
[02:32:21.330 --> 02:32:28.330]  And they were living all over where you could get in serious trouble for this level of civil disobedience that they were practicing.
[02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:31.330]  And now we were on a website and we could all communicate with one another.
[02:32:31.330 --> 02:32:33.330]  And it was the most incredible thing.
[02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:41.330]  And the timing of that thing, the timing of me getting busted, which I thought was the worst thing at the time.
[02:32:41.330 --> 02:32:49.330]  And I learned that it was probably my own manifestation coming to me as they often do, which is as an obstacle.
[02:32:49.330 --> 02:32:56.330]  And then you have to get over your own ego and see past the obstacle and turn it into an opportunity.
[02:32:56.330 --> 02:32:57.330]  I could have played the victim.
[02:32:57.330 --> 02:32:58.330]  I could have woe is me.
[02:32:58.330 --> 02:32:59.330]  I lost the weed.
[02:32:59.330 --> 02:33:00.330]  I lost the cash.
[02:33:00.330 --> 02:33:01.330]  I'm busted.
[02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:02.330]  I'm a heat score.
[02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:03.330]  I can't sell weed anymore.
[02:33:03.330 --> 02:33:11.330]  But instead, I decided, maybe I'll pioneer something new like water extraction, not just in Canada, but all over the world through these websites.
[02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:23.330]  And I'll start teaching people how to make this incredible quality hash in their own homes, which was the opposite of sort of the other concentration that was popular in 99.
[02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:30.330]  And two months after I released my bags, Indra released the BHO method on Neuroad.org.
[02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:34.330]  And that was, you know, his karma was very different from my karma.
[02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:36.330]  And I know Indra very well.
[02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:44.330]  He basically put this method out there as a scientist but not understanding that young people would get a hold of it.
[02:33:44.330 --> 02:33:49.330]  And then they started blowing up, burning their houses down, blowing their hands off.
[02:33:49.330 --> 02:33:53.330]  And doing this whole variety of things that is very, very dangerous.
[02:33:53.330 --> 02:34:07.330]  So it was a unique place to be in 99 as the water extraction guy versus all of these BHO communities, which I will say now the majority of the people I know from the BHO community back in the day, they all smoke live hash rosin.
[02:34:07.330 --> 02:34:16.330]  So we're going to talk about solventless extractions, the three different practices that I personally use, my solventless quiver.
[02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:38.330]  But I figured I'd take you through some photographs because for me, before I could learn about terpenes and terpenoids and thiols and esters and esterification of terpenes and cannabinoids and trichomes and capitate stocks and all of these different sort of terminologies, I first had to see what they were.
[02:34:38.330 --> 02:34:41.330]  And I wasn't seeing enough with my naked eye.
[02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:46.330]  So around 2007, 2008, I started practicing macro photography.
[02:34:46.330 --> 02:35:04.330]  And I started photographing cannabis with a macro lens and bringing it to my eyes, bringing that world into my brain in a way that I could make more sense of it and have a deeper understanding of what it was, what it is that is going on at these levels.
[02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:08.330]  I just want to kind of quickly walk you through some of these photos.
[02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:14.330]  And then we'll talk a little bit about dry sifting rosin and bubble hash.
[02:35:14.330 --> 02:35:17.330]  So let me see. Okay, we're going the other way.
[02:35:17.330 --> 02:35:20.330]  So this is just a picture of seeds, just a picture of seed.
[02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:22.330]  It all starts with a seed.
[02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:27.330]  Julie asked me earlier, oh, could you speak to what makes a great quality?
[02:35:27.330 --> 02:35:30.330]  How do you make a great quality as a hash maker?
[02:35:30.330 --> 02:35:34.330]  Hash makers don't make great quality.
[02:35:34.330 --> 02:35:56.330]  And I know that might sound confusing to you, but what hash makers do and concentration extract artists, whatever you want to call them, they unveil what the genetics, the genes, and the grower, along with the terroir and the methodologies of growing, all of those variables, that's where quality is created.
[02:35:56.330 --> 02:35:59.330]  The hash maker does not create quality.
[02:35:59.330 --> 02:36:03.330]  He or she unveils quality if it's there.
[02:36:03.330 --> 02:36:08.330]  And we do that through what we practice, which is purification.
[02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:10.330]  We create purity.
[02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:12.330]  You want it to be as pure as possible.
[02:36:12.330 --> 02:36:17.330]  And you'll see in some of these pictures, some of the hash that I've made is just that, extremely pure.
[02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:22.330]  This was a photograph of Sleestack crossed with skunk number one from DNA Genetics.
[02:36:23.330 --> 02:36:26.330]  And it was, I don't know, 2009 or 2010 in Amsterdam.
[02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:34.330]  And Aaron from the D, or the A from DNA, Don and Aaron, of course, is the name of those two guys, DNA.
[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:38.330]  He asked me to take a photo for the inside of one of their hats.
[02:36:38.330 --> 02:36:41.330]  So when you took the hat off, you would get this picture of seeds.
[02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:43.330]  And it all starts with a seed.
[02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:46.330]  So I figured let's start this with a seed.
[02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:54.330]  Next up, this is a macro photograph of a hash plant seed that was 25 years old at the time of cracking.
[02:36:54.330 --> 02:36:56.330]  I did not keep it in a freezer.
[02:36:56.330 --> 02:37:01.330]  It was in a refrigerator for about the last 10 years, but at room temperature for quite a while.
[02:37:01.330 --> 02:37:03.330]  And I thought it would be a neat thing to document.
[02:37:03.330 --> 02:37:09.330]  And it's also the striations, the harshness of the crack in the seed.
[02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:11.330]  You can really see how sharp it is.
[02:37:11.330 --> 02:37:13.330]  And I learned something when I took these pictures.
[02:37:13.330 --> 02:37:19.330]  Because what I did not know, this is also a 25-year-old plant from Jamaica that I collected in 1995.
[02:37:19.330 --> 02:37:26.330]  And it's, I wouldn't call it a cultivar because lamb's bread isn't, and it's lamb's bread, not breath.
[02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:27.330]  It's the bread of the lamb.
[02:37:27.330 --> 02:37:29.330]  That's what the cultivar is called.
[02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:33.330]  Lots of people mix that up and call it lamb's breath, but it's actually lamb's bread.
[02:37:33.330 --> 02:37:38.330]  And this was, you know, lamb's bread would be in Jamaica kind of like someone saying sativa.
[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:43.330]  It would be more like for a genre of plants than an actual cultivar.
[02:37:43.330 --> 02:37:52.330]  There is no one single lamb's bread plant, but there are narrow-leaf drug cultivars that are considered to be lamb's bread, you know, around Jamaica.
[02:37:52.330 --> 02:37:58.330]  Less so now, unfortunately, but this one I collected in 1995, and it was spectacular.
[02:37:58.330 --> 02:38:00.330]  Just a cool up-close shot.
[02:38:01.330 --> 02:38:10.330]  And you see how sharp the husk of the seed is and how delicate and slug-like the root of the cannabis plant is.
[02:38:10.330 --> 02:38:15.330]  So, these are extremely opposing worlds so close together.
[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:21.330]  And that veil of like a half a centimeter or a quarter of a centimeter is life or death.
[02:38:21.330 --> 02:38:28.330]  Because if the seed touches that sharp edge and grows out and opens itself up, it will be dead.
[02:38:28.330 --> 02:38:30.330]  So, it's a very delicate process.
[02:38:30.330 --> 02:38:32.330]  Shout out to the breeders that are creating good genetics.
[02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:37.330]  And there's a whole process on how this happens without your seeds dying.
[02:38:37.330 --> 02:38:39.330]  And this is a big part of that process.
[02:38:39.330 --> 02:38:41.330]  So, this is called a bitumen.
[02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:51.330]  And this bitumen is like the sac that the embryo grows in inside the calyx when the male pollen hits the stigma, the pistillate hair.
[02:38:51.330 --> 02:39:00.330]  It travels one single piece of pollen, just like one sperm, one egg, travels down into the calyx, and it creates one single seed.
[02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:04.330]  This brown pad in the middle is actually what's sitting at the bottom of the calyx.
[02:39:04.330 --> 02:39:09.330]  And then that material is this membrane that wraps around the embryo.
[02:39:09.330 --> 02:39:14.330]  And it allows the embryo to birth out of the seed husk without damage.
[02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:18.330]  So, this is a very, very important part of seed breeding.
[02:39:18.330 --> 02:39:25.330]  And if you're growing seeds that produce a membrane that is too thin, you'll have less success rate in your germination.
[02:39:25.330 --> 02:39:27.330]  So, this is, I don't know, I find it interesting.
[02:39:27.330 --> 02:39:29.330]  Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
[02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:34.330]  Just a couple more pictures of this bitumen, because I thought it was so neat.
[02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:38.330]  Anyone that's grown enough seeds has seen the bitumen get trapped on the caudalodon.
[02:39:38.330 --> 02:39:41.330]  These are the first two leaves on the plant.
[02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:45.330]  And as any grower knows, they're called the caudalodon.
[02:39:45.330 --> 02:39:48.330]  They're not true leaves in the sense that they're not serrated.
[02:39:48.330 --> 02:39:51.330]  They're just round little leaves, and they're called the caudalodon.
[02:39:51.330 --> 02:39:57.330]  When the bitumen gets trapped on the caudalodon the way this is, if you don't help it and remove it,
[02:39:57.330 --> 02:40:04.330]  it'll only take a couple of days before the interior, the epicaudal, which is the part that we're going to see next,
[02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:09.330]  the true cannabis leaves that are trying to come out in the V, the bottom of this photo,
[02:40:09.330 --> 02:40:14.330]  they suffocate and they die, and then that is also a poor germination rate.
[02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:17.330]  This is just kind of cool. I thought it looked like a walnut husk.
[02:40:17.330 --> 02:40:24.330]  It's just the seed husk that the cannabis plant and the bitumen has expelled after rooting and growing.
[02:40:24.330 --> 02:40:31.330]  And another photo of the same thing with the caudalodon and that bitumen all in one place.
[02:40:31.330 --> 02:40:35.330]  They all used to be residing right inside this little husk.
[02:40:35.330 --> 02:40:37.330]  I just think that's so cool, personally.
[02:40:37.330 --> 02:40:43.330]  And yeah, right where this little piece of light is, is where we're going to see the epicaudal produce.
[02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:46.330]  And this will also be interesting for people.
[02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:52.330]  So you see these little arms. You can see right away the epicaudal looks like wet tissue paper,
[02:40:52.330 --> 02:40:54.330]  and it is pretty much that delicate.
[02:40:54.330 --> 02:40:59.330]  And so it grows these types of non-glandular trichomes.
[02:40:59.330 --> 02:41:05.330]  So these are trichomes that have a different purpose than producing aromatic volatiles and cannabinoids.
[02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:15.330]  Instead, they produce these little arms that allow the epicaudal to pull itself off of the caudalodon without getting stuck.
[02:41:15.330 --> 02:41:22.330]  And anyone that's grown has seen, once again, if you don't produce genetics that produce strong enough trichomes
[02:41:22.330 --> 02:41:28.330]  in this particular place on that epicaudal coming out of the caudalodon, you can run into problems.
[02:41:28.330 --> 02:41:32.330]  And all of these things, you can see how deep this rabbit hole goes, right?
[02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:34.330]  Literally, with your eyes, you can see it.
[02:41:34.330 --> 02:41:42.330]  It's really quite something to start understanding, like, what in the genetics creates a strong success rate of germination?
[02:41:42.330 --> 02:41:49.330]  And then that's not even to get into account what gene synthases are present and turned on,
[02:41:49.330 --> 02:41:57.330]  meaning, you know, a plant that has a gene synthase of CBDA, if it's in the off position, that plant will not produce CBDA.
[02:41:57.330 --> 02:42:04.330]  You can take that plant as breeding stock and produce CBDA in the offspring because the synthase is there,
[02:42:04.330 --> 02:42:06.330]  but you need to breed it in to be turned on.
[02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:13.330]  So all of the volatile organic compounds, those are gene synthases that are turned on to produce these very unique profiles
[02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:17.330]  that Julie definitely loves, because I heard her talking about it.
[02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:23.330]  I think it's so awesome how much she geeks out on cannabis and absolutely just truly loves cannabis.
[02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:25.330]  And it's one of the unique things about our community.
[02:42:25.330 --> 02:42:29.330]  It's really something that a lot of us absolutely love.
[02:42:29.330 --> 02:42:32.330]  You can see a little damage on the caudalodon here.
[02:42:32.330 --> 02:42:36.330]  That's probably from where that membrane was left on a little bit too long,
[02:42:36.330 --> 02:42:43.330]  and you can see it just starts eating into the plant, and that plant would have been dead in the very, very near future.
[02:42:43.330 --> 02:42:49.330]  That's a 25-year-old seed, so I don't know how many of you grow, but maybe, I don't even know how many of you are over 25 years old.
[02:42:49.330 --> 02:42:54.330]  But when you have a seed that's over 25 years old or around that, you want to give it the best care possible.
[02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:58.330]  You can see here the epicoctal is absolutely covered in trichomes now.
[02:42:58.330 --> 02:43:02.330]  The top of it is very white. That's where the two leaves meet.
[02:43:02.330 --> 02:43:05.330]  They're going to separate here very soon.
[02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:08.330]  This is just a cool picture of a pistilet hair.
[02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:12.330]  I thought it was like buddies, you know, they're just holding hands on the plant.
[02:43:12.330 --> 02:43:18.330]  This is where the seeds, you can see these are other types of trichomes that are growing on the outside of this pistilet hair.
[02:43:18.330 --> 02:43:21.330]  Each pistilet hair comes out of a calyx.
[02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:27.330]  Sometimes you'll get two coming out of a calyx, and that's how the plant gets pollinated.
[02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:32.330]  Pollen hits one of those trichomes, it gets sucked into the interior of the pistilet,
[02:43:32.330 --> 02:43:38.330]  and travels down below and produces seedling to pass on that to genetics.
[02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:42.330]  This would be the mycorrhizosphere of the root system.
[02:43:42.330 --> 02:43:46.330]  So just a kind of very hard picture to take, but this is the root tap,
[02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:53.330]  and these little mycorrhizosphere hairs are the things that will help the plant sequester the compounds that it needs
[02:43:53.330 --> 02:43:57.330]  in order to express itself in the way that you want it to,
[02:43:57.330 --> 02:44:03.330]  which is ideally strong terpene and volatile organic compound expression,
[02:44:03.330 --> 02:44:09.330]  and obviously a nice strong cannabinoid profile as well.
[02:44:09.330 --> 02:44:12.330]  So this is a picture of the epicoctal.
[02:44:12.330 --> 02:44:18.330]  It's now growing a little bigger, and I wanted to show this because a lot of people that tell me they grow say,
[02:44:18.330 --> 02:44:21.330]  oh we don't spray once it blooms.
[02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:25.330]  Once the trichomes are in development, we don't spray anymore.
[02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:33.330]  And I show them this picture and say, these are glandular trichomes on the first set of leaves of a seedling.
[02:44:34.330 --> 02:44:42.330]  So yeah, ideally, particularly if it's some sort of systemic poison, don't spray those on your plants.
[02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:46.330]  We're volatizing this stuff into our lungs, and it's probably best.
[02:44:46.330 --> 02:44:52.330]  This is also a picture of the epicoctal showing clearly bulbous trichome heads all over the outside of it,
[02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:59.330]  as well as once again another type of non-glandular trichome, which is called the systolith hair.
[02:45:00.330 --> 02:45:04.330]  So there's in general about six of these different types of trichomes.
[02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:08.330]  I've shown you quite a few of them on the epicoctal, on the pistillate hair,
[02:45:08.330 --> 02:45:13.330]  and also the systolith hairs here on the epicoctal.
[02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:15.330]  So those are three types of non-glandulars.
[02:45:15.330 --> 02:45:21.330]  Then we're going to talk about the three types of glandular trichomes, which, you know, here's a couple of them right here.
[02:45:21.330 --> 02:45:24.330]  This is, oh, I don't know what I did there.
[02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:25.330]  I don't know what I'm doing here.
[02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:29.330]  Sorry. I think she has this set up a little different than I normally do.
[02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:31.330]  Bear with me.
[02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:33.330]  I think we're back. Yes.
[02:45:33.330 --> 02:45:38.330]  Okay, so this is a picture I took of a good friend of mine's cannabis.
[02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:41.330]  It was the Burmese fucking incredible.
[02:45:41.330 --> 02:45:44.330]  And this was Opus from Cannabis Culture Days.
[02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:49.330]  I liked it because it had a refraction of a cannabis leaf in the trichome head.
[02:45:49.330 --> 02:45:54.330]  So these taller trichomes are called capitate stalk.
[02:45:54.330 --> 02:46:00.330]  And these little shorter ones aren't actually capitate stalks at a different level of maturity,
[02:46:00.330 --> 02:46:04.330]  but they're a totally different type of trichome called capitate sessile.
[02:46:04.330 --> 02:46:11.330]  The first ones we saw that were just the little balls stuck on the leaf, those ones are called bulbous.
[02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:18.330]  And from an inhalation standpoint, you want a cultivar that has capitate stalks and capitate sessiles,
[02:46:18.330 --> 02:46:20.330]  especially from an extraction standpoint.
[02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:22.330]  And we'll talk a little bit about that.
[02:46:22.330 --> 02:46:28.330]  So keep in mind, all of the medicinal compounds, some of you may want to argue this in your mind,
[02:46:28.330 --> 02:46:30.330]  but science disagrees with you.
[02:46:30.330 --> 02:46:40.330]  All of the volatile compounds, all of the cannabinoids are found inside the glandular trichome of this head.
[02:46:40.330 --> 02:46:44.330]  These capitate stalks are made of cellulose.
[02:46:44.330 --> 02:46:47.330]  So like the same thing a cardboard box is made of,
[02:46:48.330 --> 02:46:52.330]  which is also what the majority of the plant is made out of, cellulose and fiber.
[02:46:52.330 --> 02:46:57.330]  So really what you learn about cannabis, the same way when it produces,
[02:46:57.330 --> 02:47:03.330]  if you want to produce wonderful clothes from hemp, you don't take the seeds, you don't take the resin,
[02:47:03.330 --> 02:47:10.330]  you don't take the buds, you take the cellulose and the fiber from the plant.
[02:47:10.330 --> 02:47:12.330]  So you take the one from the whole.
[02:47:12.330 --> 02:47:17.330]  If you want to access the essential amino acid rich seed oil in the embryo,
[02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:21.330]  you don't squish the cellulose, you don't squish the fiber or the bud,
[02:47:21.330 --> 02:47:25.330]  you take the seed and squish that or remove the embryo,
[02:47:25.330 --> 02:47:30.330]  and that's where all of the essential amino acids are produced in the plant.
[02:47:30.330 --> 02:47:34.330]  So it's not like, this is my opinion, it's just the way the plant is.
[02:47:34.330 --> 02:47:40.330]  If you want to access the cellulose for making paper, you don't use the seed, you don't use the bud.
[02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:44.330]  So when it comes to accessing the medicinal components,
[02:47:44.330 --> 02:47:49.330]  whether it's for recreational perspective or medical perspective,
[02:47:49.330 --> 02:47:52.330]  it's all happening in this resin gland.
[02:47:52.330 --> 02:47:56.330]  And I have people all the time tell me, I don't like hash, I just smoke the flower,
[02:47:56.330 --> 02:48:00.330]  and I just say, well, that's okay, you're still smoking the hash,
[02:48:00.330 --> 02:48:05.330]  you just prefer it diluted on biomass so that you're getting less amounts of it.
[02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:10.330]  And it's different, like when you smoke cannabis, it's totally different from when you smoke hash,
[02:48:10.330 --> 02:48:12.330]  there's no doubt about that.
[02:48:12.330 --> 02:48:16.330]  But if I take the resin off the cannabis and I do it really well,
[02:48:16.330 --> 02:48:19.330]  and you smoke it, you won't want to smoke any more of it.
[02:48:19.330 --> 02:48:21.330]  Like, factual.
[02:48:21.330 --> 02:48:27.330]  The resin needs to be present on the flower to create the high that you're getting there.
[02:48:27.330 --> 02:48:30.330]  So, glandular trichomes, three different kinds.
[02:48:30.330 --> 02:48:34.330]  This is an Astro Boy photo, I grew this plant and I photographed it.
[02:48:34.330 --> 02:48:38.330]  This is a really good example of the capitate stalk, how tall it is.
[02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:41.330]  And then the capitate sessiles next to it.
[02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:45.330]  When you're producing hash-producing cultivars for the hash market,
[02:48:45.330 --> 02:48:48.330]  you know, there's plants that have 40% bulbous heads,
[02:48:48.330 --> 02:48:52.330]  so 40% of all the trichomes on the plant are bulbous.
[02:48:52.330 --> 02:48:57.330]  And you have to understand that they don't extract in solventless processing,
[02:48:57.330 --> 02:49:01.330]  they don't extract with mechanical screen separations, they don't wash off the plant.
[02:49:01.330 --> 02:49:07.330]  Washing and dry sifting require this long cap, this long stalk with a little head on top
[02:49:07.330 --> 02:49:10.330]  where it's easy to break it off and it snaps off,
[02:49:10.330 --> 02:49:13.330]  and then you use a variety of ways to isolate those,
[02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:17.330]  which we're going to talk about for a few minutes after I get through these photos.
[02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:21.330]  Another fan leaf, this is always a good sign.
[02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:24.330]  You want to grow genetics that produce large amounts of cannabinoids.
[02:49:24.330 --> 02:49:28.330]  I'm not as much worried about high THC,
[02:49:28.330 --> 02:49:33.330]  but I do like a very dense amount of trichomes,
[02:49:33.330 --> 02:49:37.330]  and I want 90-95% of the trichomes that are on the plants that I wash
[02:49:37.330 --> 02:49:40.330]  to be capitate stalked and capitate sessile.
[02:49:40.330 --> 02:49:43.330]  I want 5% or less to be bulbous.
[02:49:43.330 --> 02:49:49.330]  And if you isolated these glands into capitate stalks, capitate sessile, and bulbous,
[02:49:49.330 --> 02:49:54.330]  and you hit the bulbous ones, you'd realize they're waxy, they're thick,
[02:49:54.330 --> 02:49:59.330]  they contain a very unique oil compound that often lights on fire if you have a flame near it.
[02:49:59.330 --> 02:50:04.330]  It's very much like the 45-micron bubble hash, but very hard to extract.
[02:50:04.330 --> 02:50:07.330]  And it's the difference between solvent and solventless.
[02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:12.330]  When you have a solvent guy say, I ran that material and I got 24%,
[02:50:12.330 --> 02:50:16.330]  and you have a solventless guy say, wow, I ran that material and I got 14%.
[02:50:16.330 --> 02:50:19.330]  These are dry weights, not fresh frozen.
[02:50:19.330 --> 02:50:21.330]  Where does that difference come from?
[02:50:21.330 --> 02:50:24.330]  The difference comes from the fact that he's using a solvent, or she,
[02:50:24.330 --> 02:50:29.330]  to isolate or to extract and melt all trichomes present.
[02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:32.330]  So all the bulbous heads are going in there, and if it's 40%,
[02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:38.330]  you're going to literally get a 40% yield higher than your solventless counterpart.
[02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:42.330]  This is also important for LPs and hashmakers to understand these things
[02:50:42.330 --> 02:50:45.330]  so that they're not making hash from the wrong genetics.
[02:50:45.330 --> 02:50:49.330]  If your whole process is to make dry sift, and you're using cultivars
[02:50:49.330 --> 02:50:54.330]  that are bulbous rich in the glandular trichome area, you're missing the boat.
[02:50:54.330 --> 02:50:58.330]  You need to kind of go back and be like, okay, we need to have specific cultivars
[02:50:58.330 --> 02:51:00.330]  for specific processes.
[02:51:00.330 --> 02:51:05.330]  Otherwise, in these tough margins that we're in, it becomes very difficult.
[02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:08.330]  This is a UBC rock star from Remo, the urban grower.
[02:51:08.330 --> 02:51:11.330]  I thought it was a good plant to show the anthocyanin striations
[02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:14.330]  in the capitate stock, these little purple colorates.
[02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:19.330]  They often come in through stress, cold, different things that happen
[02:51:19.330 --> 02:51:21.330]  to the plant in the fall.
[02:51:21.330 --> 02:51:23.330]  It's why a lot of plants produce anthocyanin.
[02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:25.330]  It's an antioxidant.
[02:51:25.330 --> 02:51:27.330]  It's found in blueberry skin.
[02:51:27.330 --> 02:51:30.330]  It's found in all sorts of different flowers.
[02:51:30.330 --> 02:51:33.330]  And it's healthy to take orally, not so much to smoke it.
[02:51:33.330 --> 02:51:39.330]  It is water-soluble, so your water, when you wash anthocyanin-rich products,
[02:51:39.330 --> 02:51:42.330]  the water will be very purple.
[02:51:42.330 --> 02:51:47.330]  It doesn't very often translate into the resin itself.
[02:51:47.330 --> 02:51:51.330]  It can with rosin, but it's less likely with bubble.
[02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:54.330]  I've seen it, but it's far and few between.
[02:51:54.330 --> 02:51:57.330]  Just a little bumblebee that landed on a plant when Johnny B.
[02:51:57.330 --> 02:52:00.330]  and I were on my deck one day filming a Puff Wednesday,
[02:52:00.330 --> 02:52:02.330]  and this little guy came and landed on it.
[02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:04.330]  It was one of Johnny B.'s buds, actually.
[02:52:04.330 --> 02:52:06.330]  Shows you the difference between the size of an insect,
[02:52:06.330 --> 02:52:09.330]  and you can see in the corner here, these are the glandular trichome heads.
[02:52:09.330 --> 02:52:12.330]  I thought it was kind of a neat photo just to, A,
[02:52:12.330 --> 02:52:15.330]  horrify anyone that wanted to see what an insect looked up close,
[02:52:15.330 --> 02:52:18.330]  but also to show the difference between a tiny little insect,
[02:52:18.330 --> 02:52:24.330]  yet it's still like 50 to 100 times bigger than those trichomes.
[02:52:24.330 --> 02:52:27.330]  Some trichomes that we're really showing, you know,
[02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:31.330]  you can see these little circles are different types of organelles.
[02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:34.330]  And so you have plastids and you have vacuoles,
[02:52:34.330 --> 02:52:38.330]  and plastids produce phenols, and vacuoles produce hydrocarbons,
[02:52:38.330 --> 02:52:40.330]  and those hydrocarbons are terpenes.
[02:52:40.330 --> 02:52:46.330]  And so these are the little labs that cannabinoids become cooked into existence.
[02:52:46.330 --> 02:52:50.330]  It's the reason why I prefer hash over oil,
[02:52:50.330 --> 02:52:53.330]  whether it's rosin or full-melt bubble.
[02:52:53.330 --> 02:52:57.330]  I find full-melt bubble to be much more of like a five-course meal
[02:52:57.330 --> 02:53:04.330]  because the laboratory that cooked all of these compounds into existence is present.
[02:53:04.330 --> 02:53:08.330]  It's in the resin glands, so you're not filtering it out with heat and pressure.
[02:53:08.330 --> 02:53:13.330]  That being said, I certainly wouldn't kick rosin out of bed for eating crackers.
[02:53:13.330 --> 02:53:17.330]  That's something weird my dad would have said back in the day about something else,
[02:53:17.330 --> 02:53:20.330]  but I said it. I said it.
[02:53:20.330 --> 02:53:23.330]  I thought this was cool, too, a couple trichomes pounding each other out.
[02:53:23.330 --> 02:53:27.330]  Respect, Mon. Some Jamaican trichomes right there.
[02:53:27.330 --> 02:53:29.330]  I don't remember what the cultivar was,
[02:53:29.330 --> 02:53:32.330]  but it was from my buddy Archie in Kingston growing great wheat.
[02:53:32.330 --> 02:53:36.330]  It would have been something gassy and cushy for sure because that's what those guys loved.
[02:53:36.330 --> 02:53:38.330]  This isâ€”five minutes? Perfect.
[02:53:38.330 --> 02:53:41.330]  This is a picture of material that I washed.
[02:53:41.330 --> 02:53:45.330]  This I will talk about bubble hash real quickly for those of you that know or don't know.
[02:53:45.330 --> 02:53:49.330]  This is a way to purify glandular trichome heads into a very pure form,
[02:53:49.330 --> 02:53:53.330]  isolating them using water and ice, breaking the heads off.
[02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:56.330]  They sink. They're very brittle in the cold ice water.
[02:53:56.330 --> 02:53:59.330]  In the mixture, they break, and they're still affected by gravity,
[02:53:59.330 --> 02:54:02.330]  so they sink in the water while everything else floats.
[02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:05.330]  You end up with a very clean product.
[02:54:05.330 --> 02:54:09.330]  You can see these are all capitate stalks and sessiles with no heads on them,
[02:54:09.330 --> 02:54:11.330]  so I cleaned that plant very effectively.
[02:54:11.330 --> 02:54:14.330]  And then you can also see when you clean the plant effectively,
[02:54:14.330 --> 02:54:19.330]  this is what your hash should look like, and this is what I meant by purity.
[02:54:19.330 --> 02:54:23.330]  This grower, this breeder produced an incredible genetic,
[02:54:23.330 --> 02:54:27.330]  produced an incredible expression of that genetic, grew to perfection.
[02:54:27.330 --> 02:54:32.330]  All I really did was isolate the resin glands and purify them.
[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:35.330]  So did I make the quality? No.
[02:54:35.330 --> 02:54:41.330]  I created the purity, which unveiled the quality, unveiling the flame.
[02:54:41.330 --> 02:54:45.330]  This is some of my mentors, Gunkman Sam's Full Melt Dry Sift.
[02:54:45.330 --> 02:54:47.330]  It's been sifted to perfection.
[02:54:47.330 --> 02:54:50.330]  This is a much harder thing to do when you don't have water on your side
[02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:52.330]  and everything is falling through.
[02:54:52.330 --> 02:54:56.330]  Hopefully I'll get to speak on the difference between dry sifted.
[02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:58.330]  These are dry sifted, but they're very clean.
[02:54:58.330 --> 02:55:04.980]  Sorry, keep doing that, but we'll go back down here real quick.
[02:55:04.980 --> 02:55:07.980]  We're almost done. I took a lot of photos. Holy shit.
[02:55:07.980 --> 02:55:09.980]  So these are all dry sifts.
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:12.980]  We can kind of whip through them, and then there's some rosin
[02:55:12.980 --> 02:55:14.980]  and some dry sift pressed.
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:16.980]  This is some bubble hash that's very fresh.
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:21.980]  But what I wanted to get to, these are air-dried products from Barcelona,
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:26.980]  really nice orange soils and heat that volatizes the product while it's drying,
[02:55:26.980 --> 02:55:28.980]  so we're not using freeze dryers in this instance.
[02:55:28.980 --> 02:55:31.980]  It congeals together, and it's very different.
[02:55:31.980 --> 02:55:35.980]  These are all air-dried bubbles from back in the day, producing different colors.
[02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:37.980]  This shows the purity of the bubble.
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:40.980]  We call this Six Star Full Melt Bubble.
[02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:45.980]  It melts into a liquid, and it is really the holy grail of the hash world.
[02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:48.980]  I don't think it will be sold at dispensaries for a while.
[02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:51.980]  I don't think it will be something you see your customers coming in
[02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:55.980]  and asking for quite as much as pre-rolled joints and other hashes.
[02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:58.980]  But we'll get there as we do it together.
[02:55:58.980 --> 02:55:59.980]  More rosin.
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:03.980]  What I wanted to show was what dry sift looks like under the microscope.
[02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:05.980]  So you saw the bubble hash.
[02:56:05.980 --> 02:56:08.980]  You saw the purity of the bubble hash.
[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:10.980]  This is really important from a Budtender standpoint.
[02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:13.980]  When someone comes in and they say, I want the best bang for my buck.
[02:56:13.980 --> 02:56:15.980]  I want to buy a gram of hash.
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:21.980]  And there's a $40 gram of bubble, but there's a $20 or a $15 gram of dry sift.
[02:56:22.980 --> 02:56:25.980]  You have to understand the $15 to $20 gram.
[02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:29.980]  Let's say it's $20, which is half the price of the bubble at $40.
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:33.980]  The purity of this is 10%.
[02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:36.980]  And if you understand what that means, it means 10% of this product
[02:56:36.980 --> 02:56:39.980]  is glandular trichome heads and active.
[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:41.980]  90% of it is not.
[02:56:41.980 --> 02:56:45.980]  Which means to get one gram of glandular trichome heads,
[02:56:45.980 --> 02:56:51.980]  you would have to buy 10 grams of this product at $15 to $20 a gram.
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:56.980]  So now you're $200 into your gram of heads versus the $40 gram
[02:56:56.980 --> 02:56:58.980]  that you could have got of bubble.
[02:56:58.980 --> 02:57:01.980]  So this isn't a story that the COA is telling.
[02:57:01.980 --> 02:57:05.980]  Oh, well, this one's 60% THC and this one's 30.
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:07.980]  So 40 bucks, 20 bucks.
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:08.980]  It makes sense.
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:09.980]  It's half the price.
[02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:10.980]  It's half the THC.
[02:57:10.980 --> 02:57:12.980]  That's just confusing people.
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:15.980]  The reality is you want to understand when you're purchasing hash,
[02:57:15.980 --> 02:57:18.980]  what is the purity of the hash of glandular trichomes?
[02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:23.980]  What is the percentage of trichome heads that are in that hash?
[02:57:23.980 --> 02:57:24.980]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:26.980]  Sometimes you need sift like this.
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:29.980]  I like it to be at least 20% to 25% heads.
[02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:32.980]  But when we make our hazel joints, which are the pure hash joints
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:37.980]  that have no paper and no glue, it can't be too high of a purity.
[02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:40.980]  If it's that full melt bubble and you go to light the joint
[02:57:40.980 --> 02:57:44.980]  and it starts dripping and melting and it won't burn consistently,
[02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:46.980]  then that product is not going to be effective.
[02:57:46.980 --> 02:57:50.980]  So there are times where you want hash to be of this particular caliber,
[02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:54.980]  but in my opinion, it's for novel products where you â€“
[02:57:54.980 --> 02:57:57.980]  and the fact is also it's a much more mellow smoke.
[02:57:57.980 --> 02:58:01.980]  And a lot of people that smoke hash â€“ I'm sure you guys would agree with this.
[02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:04.980]  Not most people are not carrying around rigs
[02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:07.980]  and smoking $100 grams of live hash rosin.
[02:58:07.980 --> 02:58:10.980]  It's a small percentage of the customers that are coming into dispensaries.
[02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:12.980]  They want pre-rolled joints.
[02:58:12.980 --> 02:58:15.980]  They want gummies and different drinks and, of course, herb,
[02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:17.980]  eighths and ounces and whatnot.
[02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:22.980]  But hash is still very much niche, so it's all about kind of educating.
[02:58:22.980 --> 02:58:24.980]  It's a fun little rabbit hole to go down.
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:28.980]  I have a bunch of different social media you can check out.
[02:58:28.980 --> 02:58:32.980]  My YouTube channel is called BC Bubble Man's World.
[02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:35.980]  And there's a show called Hash Church.
[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:38.980]  I can implore all of you, if you really want to learn about cannabis
[02:58:38.980 --> 02:58:42.980]  and get yourself some PhDs, go and watch that show.
[02:58:42.980 --> 02:58:44.980]  There's a couple hundred episodes.
[02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:49.980]  It's me basically moderating a panel of six to 15 absolutely inspirational,
[02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:53.980]  incredible, high-caliber people who have lived the experience that they're sharing,
[02:58:53.980 --> 02:58:59.980]  patient stories, breeders, growers, people that have opened stores, bud tent,
[02:58:59.980 --> 02:59:03.980]  like everyone from every aspect, doctors and PhD chemists,
[02:59:03.980 --> 02:59:08.980]  the whole nine yards, we're all getting together, sharing about a plant that we love.
[02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:12.980]  And I do hope in the future to meet some of the most gung-ho, passionate,
[02:59:12.980 --> 02:59:18.980]  obsessed bud tenders because I'd love to do a Hash Church with some of you guys.
[02:59:18.980 --> 02:59:23.980]  I like the idea of the information that you have being shared to a wider audience
[02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:25.980]  because you guys are the front lines.
[02:59:25.980 --> 02:59:27.980]  You're talking to people every day.
[02:59:27.980 --> 02:59:30.980]  And, yeah, I take this shit pretty seriously.
[02:59:30.980 --> 02:59:32.980]  It's my life's passion.
[02:59:32.980 --> 02:59:33.980]  It's my life's work.
[02:59:33.980 --> 02:59:35.980]  I've never really done anything else other than cannabis.
[02:59:35.980 --> 02:59:39.980]  So I'll finish off by thanking each and one of you for being a part of the industry
[02:59:39.980 --> 02:59:41.980]  and being a part of the community.
[02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:43.980]  More important, we have our own culture.
[02:59:43.980 --> 02:59:45.980]  We don't need it to be recreated.
[02:59:45.980 --> 02:59:48.980]  And keep doing what you're doing.
[02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:49.980]  Sell tons of weed.
[02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:51.980]  Can you believe you get to sell weed?
[02:59:51.980 --> 02:59:53.980]  That is fucking awesome.
[02:59:53.980 --> 03:00:13.580]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:15.580]  Thank you so much, Marcus.
[03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:19.580]  I learn so much every single time he speaks.
[03:00:19.580 --> 03:00:27.580]  But more importantly, I just, I don't know, I just learn about what it takes to be a humble human being.
[03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:29.580]  Like, I just love Marcus's essence.
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:32.580]  So thank you so much for donating your time.
[03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:36.580]  He took time away from making beautiful hash just to be with us today.
[03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:38.580]  So appreciate that.
[03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:39.580]  All right.
[03:00:39.580 --> 03:00:51.580]  So next up, I'm going to have Brittany from Weed Pool do a little spiel about what the Weed Pool co-op is all about.
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:55.580]  So Brittany, are you around?
[03:00:55.580 --> 03:00:57.580]  Yes, Brittany.
[03:00:57.580 --> 03:00:58.580]  The three.
[03:00:58.580 --> 03:00:59.580]  Thank you.
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:01.580]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:01.580 --> 03:01:03.580]  Thank you so much, you guys.
[03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:11.580]  I really appreciate you guys taking your time to listen to me and Weed Pool and what we are bringing to BC.
[03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:27.580]  So if you haven't heard of Weed Pool before, it was created in Saskatchewan by a bunch of retailers who realized that the direct sales between LP to retail stores was just not feasible and it became a logistical nightmare.
[03:01:27.580 --> 03:01:32.580]  So together, these retailers created a co-op.
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:38.580]  And as of August 15th, you guys all know, direct sales became accessible for us.
[03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:52.580]  But again, running into the same problems, trying to find the micros and small standard processors and producers, trying to order from them and manage multiple invoices, multiple stock days, it's just not realistic.
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:54.580]  So I'm very, very humbled.
[03:01:54.580 --> 03:02:00.580]  I'm very honored that Weed Pool's decided to expand into other provinces, including BC.
[03:02:00.580 --> 03:02:07.580]  And this means that if you're a retailer, private or independent, we're looking for members to sign up.
[03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:08.580]  There's annual dividends.
[03:02:08.580 --> 03:02:10.580]  There's vendor benefits.
[03:02:10.580 --> 03:02:14.580]  There's open discord channels to talk to all the other retail members.
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:31.580]  There's going to be exclusive products that are not available to the BCLDB, actually not available to non-members either, which is going to really help you guys diversify your stores and kind of edge away from the transactional experience that the BCLDB has created for us.
[03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:35.580]  So this is going to be one single shopping portal.
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:39.580]  Order one shipment, one stock day, one invoice.
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:40.580]  Really simple.
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:52.580]  You guys can still have specific days where you can tell your customers, you know, Tuesdays are BCLDB, Thursdays we get our Weed Pool order and you can keep things consistent and make it easier.
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:03:04.580]  And whatever you guys need, whatever you guys want, whatever kind of products you're looking for, we're going to be able to communicate with the micros, small standard processors and producers to get those products done for you.
[03:03:05.580 --> 03:03:07.580]  So it really, it's about community.
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:13.580]  It's about just overall cooperation and transparency with you guys, with the micros.
[03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:21.580]  We're really trying to open that door for everyone so that you're not just ordering off a web page and communicating with a website.
[03:03:21.580 --> 03:03:23.580]  So I'm really excited about it.
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:25.580]  I hope you guys are too.
[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:31.580]  If you have questions, concerns, you're bored, you need a cool toque, we're over in the corner.
[03:03:32.580 --> 03:03:33.580]  And we want to talk to you guys.
[03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:34.580]  We need your help.
[03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:48.580]  This is about everybody working together in tandem with different associations to get the word out there and to help you guys make this work and make it functional and profit off of it as well, which is nice.
[03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:50.580]  So anyway, thank you.
[03:03:50.580 --> 03:03:51.580]  That was short and sweet.
[03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:53.580]  Enjoy the rest of your night, guys.
[03:03:53.580 --> 03:03:54.580]  Thank you.
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:57.580]  Thank you, Brittany.
[03:03:57.580 --> 03:03:59.580]  Okay, awesome.
[03:04:00.580 --> 03:04:07.580]  I would like to begin the flower gratings, number three, the final grating.
[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:11.580]  So this is where you can open up your jars, fill in your gratings.
[03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:16.580]  And then this round, I'm going to try to keep it a tight 20 minutes.
[03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:20.580]  So if we can all agree to be back at our seats by 5.05.
[03:04:21.580 --> 03:04:32.580]  And I would really appreciate it if you can input all your scores into the digital form so we can compute everything and then announce the best flower winner.
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:40.580]  So as a reminder, if you already have joints rolled from your previous two flowers, you want to do cross references, this is your opportunity.
[03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:44.580]  But yeah, here you are, ready to grade flower number three.
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:47.580]  And please be back by 5.05.
[03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:48.580]  Thank you.

[03:19:36.140 --> 03:19:45.260]  Check, check. I can hear myself lovely in here, but am I coming through on the radio?
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:49.180]  I think it should be fine now. It feels good for me.
[03:20:09.170 --> 03:20:11.010]  It's perfect. Check, check, check.
[03:20:11.810 --> 03:20:14.210]  It's still coming. Yeah, it should be still coming through. Let me check.
[03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:17.090]  Check, check. Yep, perfect. Thank you. High five.
[03:20:17.890 --> 03:20:23.340]  All right, we're going to get going on the Budtender Games here any second.
[03:20:25.820 --> 03:20:33.970]  We will be getting rolling on the Budtender Games here any second.
[03:20:39.490 --> 03:21:28.310]  We will be up in a moment doing the Budtender Games here,
[03:21:29.430 --> 03:21:32.070]  so don't go anywhere y'all. It's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:37.110]  Check, check. Yeah, we've been doing audio check.
[03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:42.630]  Make sure that we're good to go. Hopefully I should be coming through nice and loud and clear
[03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:46.550]  to y'all. Let me know if I'm not. Have y'all been having fun so far? You good to go?
[03:21:49.350 --> 03:21:51.590]  This is working? Yep, we are good to go.
[03:21:53.990 --> 03:22:01.100]  Okay. We're perfect. All right, good. We're on camera.
[03:22:02.380 --> 03:22:06.300]  So we're going to be introducing the Budtender Games.
[03:22:07.100 --> 03:22:13.740]  The Budtender Games is all about skills development, whether it is the skill in your senses,
[03:22:13.740 --> 03:22:19.660]  like see, smell, touch, feel. We just found really unique ways to
[03:22:22.860 --> 03:22:27.660]  show appreciation to the Budtenders and the people working in the industry to say,
[03:22:27.660 --> 03:22:33.260]  hey, your job and your work requires a real skill. It's not the same as
[03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:40.060]  working at a coffee shop or anything like that. So this is what we do. So we invite our guests
[03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:47.500]  to come to our terpene table and as you smell each jar, no, no, no, you're here. You're here.
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:55.340]  Come on, do it. Come on, do it. Come on, come on. You're beautiful. Come on. So I'm just describing,
[03:22:55.340 --> 03:23:01.260]  you don't need to do anything. So we're just smelling isolated terpenes and we're just
[03:23:01.260 --> 03:23:07.500]  smelling isolated terpenes and trying to identify what is Mersenne, what is betta-caffeine,
[03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:14.780]  what is each of the different aromas of isolated terpenes. Very different from what the bouquet of
[03:23:14.780 --> 03:23:22.460]  all, the bouquet of the cannabis flower and what that overall aroma is. But the foundation of it
[03:23:22.460 --> 03:23:28.780]  is identifying the isolated terpene. Which is awesome and a lot of fun. And I love this because
[03:23:28.780 --> 03:23:34.540]  as chefs, we did a lot of training in this as well. And it's something that we don't often assign.
[03:23:34.540 --> 03:23:38.140]  We had a conversation about this actually last night on one of our other shows. One of the
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:44.700]  challenges in the cannabis space and in any consumption space where you're taking things in
[03:23:44.700 --> 03:23:50.220]  is the influence to aroma. So that's what sommeliers, when you're looking at wine connoisseurs,
[03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:55.820]  high-end foodies, people that are running massive restaurants that are centered around
[03:23:56.300 --> 03:24:01.500]  their sense of flavor, is they have to break through the influence of what is told to them.
[03:24:01.500 --> 03:24:05.740]  And often what we get is, oh hey, this is going to taste like lemon. This is going to taste like
[03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:09.980]  cherry. So what do we do when we taste something, we search for those flavors. And even if they're
[03:24:09.980 --> 03:24:15.420]  in minute concentrations, those are the highlights that we're going to be when really flavor and
[03:24:15.420 --> 03:24:21.180]  taste is unique to the individual. So you need to learn how to analyze and do those things yourself.
[03:24:21.180 --> 03:24:25.820]  So by giving those pre-recognitions, we create that challenge. So exercises like these are what
[03:24:25.820 --> 03:24:30.460]  we would do in the chef space to try and analyze. Now, of course, it would be a strawberry,
[03:24:31.020 --> 03:24:38.140]  you know, a glass of wine and something else. So an aroma rather than an isolated terpene.
[03:24:38.140 --> 03:24:43.260]  Yeah. Which is a volatile compound, which is a terpene or an ester or a...
[03:24:43.260 --> 03:24:49.260]  Exactly. So the next level would be the combination of an aroma to say, hey,
[03:24:49.500 --> 03:24:56.140]  stinky feet, rotten cheese, whatever it may be, that is a combination of all volatile compounds
[03:24:56.140 --> 03:25:05.180]  that combine together to make an overall aroma and flavor. So the best knows competition is
[03:25:05.820 --> 03:25:12.460]  the final competition where we have contestants come up. I'm going to be giving them the jars and
[03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:18.460]  they need to write down what they believe that terpene is. And whoever wins gets an amazing prize.
[03:25:19.580 --> 03:25:22.700]  So is that what we're going to do here?
[03:25:24.140 --> 03:25:26.940]  That's what we're going to be doing later on stage. Yeah, this is the practice round.
[03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:29.740]  This is the practice round. OK, so you guys are going to be doing this later on stage.
[03:25:31.020 --> 03:25:34.620]  Oh yeah, live. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah. So there are a couple other
[03:25:35.260 --> 03:25:37.900]  games. Are we going to go check those out and talk about those in a minute, too?
[03:25:37.900 --> 03:25:41.180]  So you guys don't go anywhere. We'll be right back in one minute. All right.
[03:26:04.160 --> 03:26:11.680]  Mr. Toe, Mr. Tree's heart. James Brown, the Crested Family. All right.
[03:26:17.280 --> 03:26:23.360]  Oh, you Gates, my powers. Brian Mason. Check. Here we go.
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:24.880]  Hey, Jar.
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:36.400]  So we have our next but while we're waiting for that, can you tell me a little bit
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:41.520]  a little bit about these banners that you've put all over the place?
[03:26:42.400 --> 03:26:47.200]  Yeah. So the one of the foundations of a cannabis Mali is to understand
[03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:55.040]  the regions of cannabis that where it's grown. And because cannabis is a reflection of the
[03:26:55.040 --> 03:27:02.400]  environment that it's in, there are some distinctive features of certain areas because it has a unique
[03:27:02.400 --> 03:27:07.120]  environment, unique climate. And so, of course, the cannabis plant is going to
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:16.400]  adapt and adjust that way. So we chose four key locations where cannabis is really known for,
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:24.880]  such as the this one is the Afghan region from Afghanistan, broadleaf plant and has a more musty
[03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:32.800]  or the mulching leaves type of aroma. We were just at the Kush booth. That's a higher elevation
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:40.480]  in the Hindu Kush region. So northern India, Himalayan areas, and also a broadleaf drug type
[03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:46.480]  plant. But it expresses very differently than the Afghan. It is more gassy, more pine and some of
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:51.440]  that skunk and very different morphology in terms of the bud is more dense and tends to be smaller
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:56.480]  than the Afghans. So as we move to the different booths, we'll take a look at haze and Himalayan.
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:02.480]  But what we have right now is this is another butt tender game. It's weighing eight. And so
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:04.560]  let's play it, London. Let's see how good you are.
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:09.760]  So I don't know. I'm going to be the worst at this because I haven't had to weigh weed for
[03:28:09.760 --> 03:28:14.880]  10 years. You put it in a zip and you pull out a handful when you need some.
[03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:18.560]  Well, that's nice when you grow it. But you know, like for us, I got to weigh in eight.
[03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:24.560]  So yes, let's weigh in. You and I, we're going to compete right now. Okay, let's do it. Let's weigh
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:30.560]  in eight. Let's see. And then we have jar here that's going to be helping us determine, hey,
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:38.640]  do we have the eighth? Correct. I'm done. Let's do it. All right. So you already tarred it?
[03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:45.200]  All right, you have? How's that tar? Six point? Oh, yeah, he's good. Yeah, he was at minus 13.
[03:28:47.520 --> 03:28:47.920]  Okay.
[03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:57.280]  So at 6.59. I'm gonna be that eight. I'll buy an eighth from you anytime.
[03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:01.920]  Is that correct? I don't think so. Let's just recalibrate.
[03:29:03.920 --> 03:29:07.520]  Okay, let's tar it. Yeah, tear it and pour it in there. Now. Okay,
[03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:11.760]  tear it and pour the bowl for that. Pour in it. Yeah, yeah. And where are we at? I got
[03:29:12.880 --> 03:29:18.080]  5.12. 5.12. Okay, so now. How much is in an eighth? And then pour that. How many grams are in
[03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:25.760]  an eighth? 3.5. Okay, really? Oh, 6.5. Wow, we know we weigh fat eighths. You know what,
[03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:30.160]  the buds pretty dense. I didn't take a lot of time with this. It's really nice. Actually,
[03:29:30.160 --> 03:29:33.920]  this is a flower. It's nice flower. Can you tell me who this is yet? Yeah, I can. Well,
[03:29:33.920 --> 03:29:38.160]  this one is a non competition flower competition. Peanut butter breath. Peanut butter breath. You
[03:29:38.160 --> 03:29:43.280]  know, who is a grown man? distinct, distinct. This is some fucking fire, man. Like, okay,
[03:29:43.280 --> 03:29:47.200]  this is your show me. This is the weed that they're using to throw around. That's the funny
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:52.880]  part. Well, I'm just saying, you know, as we go into the finals, I'm going to be bringing up
[03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:58.720]  three different cultivars. So not all eights look the same. Not all eights are going to take the
[03:29:58.720 --> 03:30:02.960]  total same amount of volume. It's all about the different moisture content. It's all about the
[03:30:02.960 --> 03:30:08.320]  different morphology. Yeah, it's always going to change, which is cool. So it's a skill. Right?
[03:30:08.320 --> 03:30:13.120]  Exactly. All right. Next one. Next game. Yep. You walk us over and I'll just point it straight.
[03:30:13.120 --> 03:30:27.480]  Okay, so Daniel, I just want you to stand there and look pretty. All right. So this is another
[03:30:27.480 --> 03:30:32.600]  butt tender game. Now this is the biggest competition. It is the cannabis sommelier
[03:30:33.400 --> 03:30:43.560]  flower blind ID. So what that is, is I have three jars. And it has some product in here.
[03:30:43.560 --> 03:30:51.880]  And the name of the game is to guess the name of the cultivar and the producer. And so I chose
[03:30:51.880 --> 03:30:56.280]  I'm just saying if it is brought to you by done, it is brought to you by done, but none of the
[03:30:56.280 --> 03:31:01.640]  flowers are done. Okay. Oh, okay. So that's the trick. They're trying to trick you. The prize
[03:31:02.280 --> 03:31:07.000]  is, is given by done, but none of these flowers are actually done. Can I get a, can I have a
[03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:12.040]  second question? Are these cultivars on the regular market? Like if I go to the store,
[03:31:12.040 --> 03:31:16.200]  I'm going to find them on a regular basis. Pretty probably suggested by some of the people here.
[03:31:16.200 --> 03:31:23.000]  Right? Oh yeah. So I chose flowers that are in my opinion, common and distinctive. Okay. Because
[03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:27.880]  I'm not going to choose a common flower that a lot of growers grow and there's different
[03:31:27.880 --> 03:31:31.560]  phenotypes and expressions going around. Like I'm going to choose a flower that's
[03:31:31.560 --> 03:31:36.600]  distinctive enough that I could recognize and any seasoned consumer and butt tender
[03:31:36.600 --> 03:31:41.320]  should know these flowers. Of course, when we get to the final round, it's going to get a little bit
[03:31:41.320 --> 03:31:48.680]  harder, but this is a preliminary round. That's going to pick out the top five, hopefully of the
[03:31:48.680 --> 03:31:57.080]  best guessers. So can you guess one? No, I'm not even getting the reason I, it's, I don't think,
[03:31:57.640 --> 03:32:02.120]  I don't think you can, unless you are. Well, I couldn't because I'm just not tasting this product
[03:32:02.120 --> 03:32:06.280]  on a regular day, but I bet you there are tons of people here that are tasting these things on the
[03:32:06.280 --> 03:32:11.000]  regular that can get a neat experience with the product to be able to understand that. And, and,
[03:32:11.000 --> 03:32:15.480]  and that's part of the challenge because I don't like when it comes to like, you know, cannabis in
[03:32:15.480 --> 03:32:24.200]  general, the, the, the, the individual strains or, you know, lines can, an individual plant can taste
[03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:28.440]  differently, whether it's grown in a different place or not. So it's really hard to like, oh,
[03:32:28.440 --> 03:32:32.840]  this smells like that. And I was like, no way you can't smell that. No way. But some things have
[03:32:32.840 --> 03:32:37.960]  those characteristic like terpeneline dominant or, or, or gaseous dominant. So they're really
[03:32:37.960 --> 03:32:42.520]  defined. But the thing is, is that was how it was, but now we're in an illegal space and these,
[03:32:42.520 --> 03:32:47.960]  these producers are putting out stuff that's consistent, regular and high quality. So that's
[03:32:47.960 --> 03:32:53.800]  the plan. And that's, that's the thing, right? I'm, I'm choosing flowers that have a proper
[03:32:53.800 --> 03:33:00.920]  representation of the cultivar as chosen by the breeder, right? So the breeders saying, Hey,
[03:33:00.920 --> 03:33:08.040]  this is the, the phenotype, this is the genetics that I want to express. And these are the growers
[03:33:08.040 --> 03:33:11.880]  that are growing it to kind of meet that expectation. Of course, there's going to be
[03:33:11.880 --> 03:33:18.920]  variances, but what I hope to do is develop, you know, people's appreciation for certain cultivars.
[03:33:19.720 --> 03:33:24.280]  And it's the way to go. And this is, this is the way to do it. I'm excited to see that. So
[03:33:24.280 --> 03:33:28.280]  how far are we from the, from the, from the tail end here? What's, what's the excitement?
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:33.320]  What's going to happen is we're going to kick off the joint rolling competitions, which is
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:39.320]  number one, the most creative joint. Okay. So you can use unlimited number of papers,
[03:33:39.320 --> 03:33:44.200]  you can use a maximum three grams and let's see what they come up with. And then we're going to
[03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:48.840]  kick off the bartender games live on stage. Awesome. And we'll be here, there, and everywhere
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:53.400]  trying to get as much of this on camera for you as possible. Thanks again and keep it growing.
[03:33:53.400 --> 03:33:55.000]  We'll be, we'll be back shortly. Thank you.
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:58.760]  So can you get the, thank you. You're wicked.
[03:34:03.480 --> 03:34:07.080]  Steve. Jason.
[03:34:15.900 --> 03:34:21.420]  A very special. Thank you for the dedication and for bringing the science into what we believe in
[03:34:21.420 --> 03:34:29.580]  goes to Dr. Ethan. Dr. Christine. Dr. James.
[03:34:35.740 --> 03:34:37.580]  Dr. Bruce.
[03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:54.220]  All the seed. There is no.
[03:34:56.860 --> 03:35:02.300]  Yellow hammer genetics. We should taste good. The ranch. The American one.
[03:35:02.380 --> 03:35:09.580]  Sonoma. South Bay genetics. So we're legacy. So we're rebel genetic. Seattle chronic.
[03:35:10.140 --> 03:35:16.700]  Seattle. Yes. And see Russian land. Res. Blue Romulan genetics. Predictive breeding.
[03:35:16.700 --> 03:35:28.300]  Pride of the lion. Seed. Musco seeds. Legendary genetics. Clever genetics.
[03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:38.940]  Genetics. HBK genetics. Genome. Alchemy. Free thinkers. Conservation. Family tree.
[03:35:44.460 --> 03:35:44.780]  Dog.
[03:35:47.340 --> 03:35:49.900]  Coastal. Company. C and H.
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:51.660]  Botanicals. Brandon.
[03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:53.420]  Boneyard.
[03:35:53.500 --> 03:35:57.180]  Seeds. Bodies. Seeds. Blood. Dime.
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:50.920]  Green flowers. So we're going to be inputting the information. So I do ask that you start
[03:38:50.920 --> 03:38:58.360]  entering it into the actual digital quality grading form. And we do need to cut it off so
[03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:05.080]  that the computation works properly. So please get that in as soon as possible. And our cannabis
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:12.920]  molliers can actually assist you with that as well. Okay. So before I kick off the bartender games,
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:21.480]  I would like to invite Jeff back up on stage. And Jenny. Is Jenny around? I just need the list
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:28.760]  again. Thank you, Jenny. The list. And Jeff with the prize. So it's another door prize.
[03:39:30.200 --> 03:39:49.780]  I'm just going to grab it. Give me a second. So another door prize. And we wanted to make this
[03:39:49.780 --> 03:39:54.260]  really fun and accessible for everybody. So you don't always have to compete. You just need to
[03:39:54.260 --> 03:39:59.940]  participate. So this, you don't need to do any work. You just need to show up. And you get to win
[03:39:59.940 --> 03:40:12.500]  this. So I've been using one of these for the whole day and I've been getting progressively
[03:40:12.500 --> 03:40:19.460]  higher with it. So someone's going to get to enjoy this as much as I did. Except a brand new one,
[03:40:19.460 --> 03:40:25.620]  not the one I used. Because that one's, it's been used a lot. So who do we have for a winner?
[03:40:26.020 --> 03:40:37.940]  We have Jason Zahineko. Is there a Jason Zahineko?
[03:40:37.940 --> 03:40:38.980]  Come on down.
[03:40:40.020 --> 03:40:43.060]  Awesome. Congratulations, Jason.
[03:40:45.620 --> 03:40:46.340]  Do you dab?
[03:40:47.860 --> 03:40:51.780]  All right. Can you go full screen, please? Present, just presentation mode.
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:58.580]  All right. So now we are going to kick off. Thank you so much, Jeff. We are going to kick off the
[03:40:58.580 --> 03:41:04.580]  cannabis molly competition. So with Sharon's assistance, we're going to get the top contestants.
[03:41:04.580 --> 03:41:10.340]  And I'm going to be inviting you up to our dance floor here. And we're going to be identifying the
[03:41:10.340 --> 03:41:14.580]  flower. Okay. So just give me a moment. We're going to round up the people. She's going to
[03:41:14.580 --> 03:41:21.380]  call out the names. And I'm going to, and if you're curious to know what flower was what for
[03:41:21.380 --> 03:41:29.950]  the games. Was anyone really confident about what flower number one was?
[03:41:32.430 --> 03:41:34.030]  I think Justine would really know.
[03:41:36.030 --> 03:41:45.550]  Yeah. So it's Amnesia Haze by Broken Coast. Number two flower was, any strong guesses?
[03:41:48.350 --> 03:41:57.230]  Who said that? Okay. I heard Gelato 33 by Lot 420. And then flower number three was,
[03:41:57.230 --> 03:42:03.470]  any guesses? It was pretty distinctive one. Yeah. Romulan by 1964.
[03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:07.550]  Awesome. Okay. So let's get the contestants up for the blind ID.
[03:42:10.350 --> 03:42:12.190]  So who is that?
[03:42:12.990 --> 03:42:19.150]  Okay. So, we've got great contestants. So I got to say these people named the cultivar name and
[03:42:19.150 --> 03:42:27.070]  the LP pretty bang on. This would be Austin, Eli, Jeremy and Gabby. Gabby's coming back to defend
[03:42:27.070 --> 03:42:35.310]  her title. She won the last collectors cup cannabis molly competition and maybe she can do it two in a
[03:42:35.310 --> 03:42:37.710]  row. So let me get those names up for you.
[03:43:15.020 --> 03:43:23.740]  Right. So do we have the three? I know Gabby's here. Come on up. Oh, and sorry, I'm going to
[03:43:23.740 --> 03:43:29.260]  kick off the joint rolling competition. So the joint rolling competition, you get about 30
[03:43:29.260 --> 03:43:36.300]  minutes or until our speed rolling competition ends and you get three grams, unlimited papers,
[03:43:37.020 --> 03:43:43.740]  and you got to roll the most beautiful joint. So in any takers, please come up to this table
[03:43:43.740 --> 03:43:49.020]  and we're going to run the side competition while you roll your most creative joint.
[03:43:50.140 --> 03:43:55.740]  And if you like free weed, you got to keep the weed in your joint. It does have to be
[03:43:55.740 --> 03:44:01.580]  smokable. We're going to actually test it. And all the prizes up on the stage right now.
[03:44:01.580 --> 03:44:06.860]  Okay. The top winners will be taking away a prize and they're juicy prizes. Okay. Like,
[03:44:07.500 --> 03:44:10.860]  like I'm jealous. So got to say it's worth it to come up.
[03:44:13.260 --> 03:44:25.550]  You just got the answers. Huh? Okay. Okay. They just saw the answers.
[03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:41.030]  Okay. So Austin, Jeremy and Gabby. So Jeremy, are you here, Jeremy?
[03:44:57.630 --> 03:45:03.950]  Jeremy. Okay. This is amazing because Jeremy also, he was a finalist at the first collector's
[03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:08.910]  cup in Vancouver as well. So we have Jeremy and Gabby. That's amazing. All right. So any
[03:45:08.910 --> 03:45:16.350]  takers for the creative joint competition, please come on up. Yes, yes, yes. Come on up.
[03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:20.910]  Thank you. Thank you. Look, you have a very high chance of winning at this point. Like,
[03:45:21.550 --> 03:45:26.430]  seriously. All right. Have a seat. Have a seat. We're going to be bringing up the flowers. All
[03:45:26.430 --> 03:45:32.510]  right. So first of all, please give it a round of applause for these three individuals,
[03:45:33.150 --> 03:45:40.830]  because they have proven themselves yet again for knowing really good flower. All right. So
[03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:44.910]  amazing job, because that means you've seen enough flower, you smelled enough flower,
[03:45:45.470 --> 03:45:50.430]  you have the memory of knowing what the good flower is. And that just goes to show you have
[03:45:50.430 --> 03:45:55.710]  the appreciation for it. So thank you. Very well done. We're going to kick off the creative joint
[03:45:55.710 --> 03:46:02.030]  rolling competition. And since I opened my answer book, I have to get you another set of flowers.
[03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:09.070]  So how about in the meantime, you can just sit aside and then we're going to kick off the
[03:46:16.890 --> 03:46:27.060]  Okay, here we go. Let's do this. First things first. This is going to be,
[03:46:27.380 --> 03:46:32.500]  this is going to be nice and easy. So I just need all Sharon, I lost the notes.
[03:46:34.100 --> 03:46:50.320]  The voting papers, the voting papers. I know. You gave it to me. Sorry.
[03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:59.200]  I'm going to give you this flower. Okay, sniff, open, smell. And then I'm going to give you a
[03:46:59.360 --> 03:47:03.280]  piece of paper, write your name on it. Tell me what flower you think it is. Okay.
[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:28.820]  And I'll get you the paper. So please start. So this is a really difficult competition because
[03:47:29.380 --> 03:47:34.820]  the flower is going to get more and more complex. Hopefully they are identifiable to you.
[03:47:35.780 --> 03:47:42.420]  However, you got to have a really good memory to know but it seems like Jeremy's pretty confident.
[03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:55.250]  Can you round up three pens for me? Two more. This competition is brought to you by Dunn
[03:47:55.250 --> 03:48:22.280]  Cannabis. And so the top winning prize is going to get a, sorry, it's a vaporizer. And Sabine,
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:30.360]  what was the name of the brand again? Azenco. Okay, retails 300 bucks. All right. So it's a
[03:48:30.680 --> 03:48:37.240]  beautiful, it's a dry herb and concentrate vaporizer. Jeremy knows what it is. He's like,
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:44.840]  I want that. So we're going to try really hard here. All right. So what is in this jar? Let's
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:54.680]  find out. Ready? Okay. Flip over your answer. That's good. Booyah. Gabby made it through first
[03:48:54.680 --> 03:49:04.360]  round. Booyah. Austin, you made it through the first round. Holy smokes. Jeremy, you did too.
[03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:11.160]  Okay, next time get the LP or the producer as well. I know you know. Yeah. So it was Orange
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:17.240]  Tings by Pistol and Paris. And it's a distinctive flower, right? Yeah, pretty distinctive. I gave
[03:49:17.240 --> 03:49:22.120]  that to you. All right. Just to kind of get the confidence going. All right. So let's do something
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:59.300]  else. What is in jar number five? I'm going to give you another paper. So the first prize is
[03:49:59.300 --> 03:50:04.740]  a Azenco vaporizer, which will be sent to you. It's beautiful. And I'm going to show you what
[03:50:04.740 --> 03:50:15.330]  you're going to get as a second. So second place is going to get, this is a gift from Truo Cannabis.
[03:50:15.730 --> 03:50:23.330]  And it comes with, I don't know, is this a probably an eighth of, yeah, an eighth of the
[03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:32.050]  True Truo G flower along with, okay, one of the most beautiful, I don't want to drop it, okay?
[03:50:32.050 --> 03:50:41.010]  Like, it's like, look at this flower explosion twist. It's a Sherlock pipe. Beautiful by Boron
[03:50:41.810 --> 03:50:50.050]  Glass. They did a special collaboration with Boron Beyond and Truo. So thank you, Axel de la
[03:50:50.050 --> 03:51:08.710]  PeÃ±a for donating this beautiful prize for the second place finisher. Do we have our answers?
[03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:27.660]  No cheating. Oh, do you need more time? Oh, yeah. Come on. Let's get it in.
[03:51:38.820 --> 03:51:43.940]  What is this flower? Do you want to get a closeup? Oh, nice.
[03:51:46.820 --> 03:51:51.380]  I know deliberations. What is it? What is it? Let's see. Okay.
[03:51:52.260 --> 03:52:15.970]  Oh, come on. Just a guess whether it's the producer or the name of the cultivar. Okay.
[03:52:17.250 --> 03:52:23.810]  Jeremy, you in? Just try. Just try. Okay. Okay.
[03:52:24.770 --> 03:52:37.010]  Okay. All right. So Jeremy guessed this was some blue or no broken coast. Gabby guessed.
[03:52:39.490 --> 03:52:45.170]  Okay. I'll give you. Okay. And then Austin guessed it was by
[03:52:45.170 --> 03:52:58.760]  Coastal Mountain, the organic Pemberton pink. Close. I might just go with it.
[03:53:01.560 --> 03:53:03.640]  I don't know. Write down something, Gabby.
[03:53:10.850 --> 03:53:13.570]  Okay. You know what? Since everybody, I'm going to just say
[03:53:15.730 --> 03:53:22.930]  you were the closest. It was the Crunch Berries by Sweetgrass. You wrote mint chocolate. I know.
[03:53:22.930 --> 03:53:29.170]  It's so close. Yeah. Now it connects, right? Yeah. Now it connects. Yeah. Not quite a pink
[03:53:29.970 --> 03:53:37.810]  fruity. Yes. Delicious, delicious, delicious. Okay. So thank you. Crunch Berries by Sweetgrass.
[03:53:38.370 --> 03:53:49.900]  The next one is going to be. Let's do this one. Okay. Austin, you can try first.
[03:53:50.860 --> 03:54:24.480]  Jar number one. What is it? All right. So thank you, Dunn Cannabis, for
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:33.120]  putting your forces into making this experience a reality for the community.
[03:54:34.240 --> 03:54:44.160]  I'm trying to avoid the word using. But what you're going to get is this awesome gift pack from
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:54.560]  Hyten. This is a cannabis infused nano gummy. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. And then watermelon mint
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:55:02.960]  beverage. Also a lava lamp, thanks to Dunn Cannabis, which I'm like, oh, I always wanted a
[03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:12.720]  lava lamp. So that would be third place. First place is a vaporizer, the Zanko. And then second
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:20.800]  place is the Hippo Sherlock pipe from Borro Glass. And then the third place is the Hyten gift pack
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:26.480]  of a drink, a gummy, and a lava lamp. So all pretty good. So all three are going to get one
[03:55:26.480 --> 03:55:32.960]  because there's only three top contestants they tied. So this is going to be jar number one.
[03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:40.640]  I wonder what it may be. And guess what, folks? The jar number one, all and the numbers here
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:45.040]  actually correlate to the flowers that you've been grading. So it's kind of a sneak peek to
[03:55:45.040 --> 03:56:07.180]  find out what flowers they are. So jar number one, are you ready? Okay. All right, let's see.
[03:56:08.060 --> 03:56:17.070]  Let's see. Let's see. And maybe is Logan here? Can you help me with this?
[03:56:20.150 --> 03:56:26.870]  Because I find this interesting. So Jeremy, he guessed Coast Mountain, their pure skunk cake.
[03:56:28.470 --> 03:56:31.350]  I'm going to reveal the answers. I want to know the lineage behind this one.
[03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:37.030]  Okay, so the lineage because you would know. Yeah, it's this one.
[03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:41.430]  So I want to know the lineage of it. Okay.
[03:56:43.350 --> 03:56:50.870]  Because it's tricky. It's super like skunky, gassy pine very much so. So Gabby got
[03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:58.150]  the Whistler Bubba Kush, very close. Oh, and then also Austin, you got the
[03:56:59.750 --> 03:57:04.470]  pure cake skunk by Coast Mountain. So seems like you're familiar with this bud, right?
[03:57:05.190 --> 03:57:11.590]  I've actually seen the pure cake skunk. And the bud morphology is actually a little bit different.
[03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:17.270]  It's smaller, tighter, not as big and fluffy as this. So just by the way, it looks different.
[03:57:17.270 --> 03:57:24.230]  But the smell. Oh, yeah, the smell is just so gassy. Like this. Like this in terms of loudness
[03:57:24.230 --> 03:57:30.310]  of aroma just explodes out of the out of the jar. So the answer, okay, we're gonna have to figure
[03:57:30.310 --> 03:57:36.230]  out maybe we'll do a tiebreaker. Okay. But the answer for this is Karma by Don Cannabis. So
[03:57:36.230 --> 03:57:47.410]  let's see who came closest. I want to know the lineage, please. Do you know? Oh, yeah.
[03:57:47.410 --> 03:57:56.210]  No. So it's like it was one of our 74 bring in that we did. So it has a sorry, it's crossed with
[03:57:56.770 --> 03:58:04.690]  acai berry or the acai gelato, which is like not the berry version. And the mint 11.
[03:58:04.690 --> 03:58:13.330]  Okay, okay. So it smells like a Bubba slash skunk. So y'all came close. So we're gonna have to do
[03:58:13.330 --> 03:58:22.290]  another round. Let's do Sharon, I need your fingerprint. I should just like, duplicate my
[03:58:22.290 --> 03:58:31.090]  fingerprint. Okay, so let's do this one. Should we do this one or this one? This one's pretty.
[03:58:36.330 --> 03:58:40.890]  Yeah, already did that one. Okay, this one. Jar number seven. Back at you, Jeremy.
[03:58:41.370 --> 03:58:50.110]  Okay, so it's a suspenseful thing, right? Like, what is happening? What are they going to guess?
[03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:54.910]  What is it going to be? Do they know? Do they know good weed? Do they know what this is?
[03:58:54.910 --> 03:59:00.190]  How distinctive is it? So this is a nod to the cannabis consumer, the butt tender and the producer.
[03:59:00.750 --> 03:59:10.910]  Can you produce an experience that is replicable, that is consistent, that is recognizable?
[03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:16.030]  That's a very hard thing to do for a natural plant, right? So put in your answer.
[03:59:18.350 --> 03:59:23.630]  So guess of the producer and the name of the cultivar.
[03:59:45.260 --> 03:59:50.300]  This is full concentration mode right here. And as we can see, we have the most creative
[03:59:50.300 --> 03:59:55.260]  joint rollers putting on their A game. This is nice because I've seen these peeps
[03:59:55.900 --> 04:00:00.940]  roll joints earlier. I'm like, damn, that's a good joint. And I know Panda, I used to smoke
[04:00:00.940 --> 04:00:09.660]  her joints all the time. So yeah, it's I know she's gonna make she making a to my first to
[04:00:10.700 --> 04:00:16.380]  All right, let's see what the okay we have. This is one of my faves. Okay.
[04:00:16.380 --> 04:00:28.750]  So Austin, you did. Great guess is the Mendoz Stomper by Sweetgrass. Gabby guess Platinum
[04:00:28.750 --> 04:00:36.750]  Grapes by Organica. Organic craft. Yeah. You also guessed Platinum Grapes. Yeah,
[04:00:36.750 --> 04:00:45.630]  mind meld. What's going on here? So congratulations, Austin. Bang on Mendoz
[04:00:45.630 --> 04:00:50.990]  Stomper by Sweetgrass. Amazing. He knows his flowers. So please tell me
[04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:55.790]  where you work. How do you know about all of these flowers?
[04:00:56.990 --> 04:01:04.830]  I work at Burb Cannabis and that Mendoz Stomper specifically, I actually have like an eighth in
[04:01:04.830 --> 04:01:11.150]  my bag and an unopened eighth at home. I'm very familiar with that flower. And the rest is just
[04:01:11.150 --> 04:01:22.710]  from buying and trying flower. Congratulations, Austin. What a wonderful job. I will get your
[04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:28.310]  gift and then Gabby, please tell me about yourself. And you're pretty skilled about flower too. So
[04:01:29.270 --> 04:01:33.350]  you know, where are you in the industry? And how do you know about all this great flower?
[04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:39.270]  Definitely. So for the past couple of years, I've actually worked at Muse Cannabis as a supervisor
[04:01:39.270 --> 04:01:43.590]  slash butt tender. And it's been a really wonderful experience. I've had the opportunity
[04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:49.110]  to meet so many different people and also just have the access to such a large selection of weed.
[04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:54.630]  I have decided to go back to school. So I'm just kind of decided to move to a smaller dispensary
[04:01:54.630 --> 04:02:00.150]  called Elmwood Cannabis. But yes, I'm going back for a bachelor's degree in marketing and hope to
[04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:06.070]  reenter the industry from a different standpoint. So I'm very excited about that. But I'm very
[04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:10.390]  excited to see what the new year has to hold. And it was honestly an honor to compete and
[04:02:10.390 --> 04:02:16.390]  congratulations. That was spot on. The grapes really threw me off. But yeah, it was really awesome.
[04:02:16.390 --> 04:02:25.040]  Thanks so much. Thank you, Gabby. All right. And then we have Jeremy. I love how we have repeat
[04:02:25.040 --> 04:02:31.920]  contestants from last time like that is so wicked. So Jeremy, tell me your story. Where are you in
[04:02:31.920 --> 04:02:38.160]  the industry? And how do you know about all this good weed? I'm the purchaser for Zeden Stone. So
[04:02:38.160 --> 04:02:43.920]  I buy all the weeds. So I kind of tend to try a little bit of as well.
[04:02:46.480 --> 04:02:50.880]  Awesome. All right. Let me give you your prizes. Just come up on stage with me. We'll take a photo
[04:02:50.880 --> 04:03:07.860]  up here. Rules on the joint rolling. So three grams, as much paper as you want. And then
[04:03:07.860 --> 04:03:13.140]  time's up when the joint rolling competition's over. So cannabis sommeliers, please come up.

[04:03:27.330 --> 04:03:31.810]  All right. Okay. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay. There we go. There we go.
[04:03:31.810 --> 04:03:38.050]  A round of applause. Congratulations, the cannabis sommeliers. We have Austin, Gabby, and Jeremy.

[04:11:28.420 --> 04:11:42.370]  Does anyone need six? Yeah. There may be a tiebreaker. There may not be. Okay. Who hasn't
[04:11:42.370 --> 04:11:47.730]  gotten everything except for number one, like basically two to six? You just need number two?
[04:11:47.730 --> 04:12:01.810]  You have it? Okay. You knew four? Okay, so everybody's done three. Everybody's done five.
[04:12:01.810 --> 04:12:12.630]  Where's five here? Everybody's done six. Okay, everybody's done two? Yeah.
[04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:25.310]  Where's four? Over here. Okay. Good. All right, let's start.

[04:12:42.180 --> 04:12:48.820]  answer. And then we'll see who gets the most number of points. There may be a next round
[04:12:48.820 --> 04:13:18.380]  because there may be a tie. Okay, Adrienne gets two points. Justine. Justine also gets two points.

[04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:47.390]  I'm sorry. I love your presence, Megan. She's always at study hall and everything,
[04:13:47.390 --> 04:13:51.870]  and she knows good weed. Okay, I know. I trust her nose when it comes to weed, but
[04:13:52.590 --> 04:14:05.950]  the chirping competition, not so. Okay, so Corey. Zion. Okay, there we go. Zion. There we go.
[04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:12.350]  Yeah, you got one, so you also got eliminated. Okay, there we go. And then we have...
[04:14:13.310 --> 04:14:19.640]  And your name's different too. Okay, I thought you went by a different name earlier. No. Oh, okay.
[04:14:21.480 --> 04:14:36.000]  Okay, yeah. Thank you. You got one. Nice. Yeah. Corey got one. Okay, so you kind of got eliminated
[04:14:36.000 --> 04:14:39.520]  though, but you got one. I know, but I got nothing. Yeah, yeah. Better than nothing. Better than nothing. That's okay.
[04:14:39.840 --> 04:14:55.780]  Chloe, you got two. Yeah. All right. And then now,

[04:15:24.910 --> 04:15:31.310]  She won the competition. She got five. You got all five. All five. Everybody was one or two.
[04:15:32.270 --> 04:15:39.070]  Kaido, you came really close, okay, with four, but Shay got all five, so we don't even need to do...
[04:15:39.790 --> 04:15:44.030]  Holy smokes. Shay Nakano, you're amazing.
[04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:51.870]  Super cool. We spent like an afternoon together, and I feel like we're like sisters, so congratulations.
[04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:57.310]  Shay, and all the contestants, thank you so much for playing. That was fun, right? It was fun
[04:15:57.310 --> 04:16:01.950]  regardless. Thank you for trying. It was close, but it's so hard because sometimes your nose gets
[04:16:01.950 --> 04:16:08.430]  confused by smelling so many things, right? But Shay, damn, you got it right. So come up on stage here,
[04:16:09.230 --> 04:16:16.670]  and you get to win this amazing prize pack. All right, and Bobby will get a photo with Shay.
[04:16:18.750 --> 04:16:27.210]  Everybody, round of applause for Shay Nakano. That's so exciting. Yes.
[04:16:27.610 --> 04:16:38.290]  Oh my god. Okay, here you go. This whole thing is yours. Okay.
[04:16:43.560 --> 04:16:49.960]  You get it all. I'll drive you home, girl. Okay. All right. Thank you, Terpene contestants.
[04:16:50.520 --> 04:16:57.640]  All right. So now we're gonna do the weigh-in eighth competition. In the meantime, for anyone
[04:16:57.640 --> 04:17:01.720]  that is interested in the speed rolling competition, we will be doing that last.
[04:17:01.720 --> 04:17:06.840]  I'd love to see at least five, ideally ten people come up for the speed roll competition. So
[04:17:06.840 --> 04:17:12.760]  that's gonna come up after this. So, Gapreet, the next slide, please. This should be... No, one more
[04:17:12.760 --> 04:17:19.320]  slide, please, Gapreet. Weigh-in eighth. This is brought to you by Embark. So, weigh-in eighth. I have some names.

[04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:46.270]  Samantha from Evergreen. Brent from Muse. Paul. Paul. And Dana from Mood Cannabis. Please,
[04:17:46.270 --> 04:17:50.430]  I just need... Let's see, one, two... I just need three more chances.
[04:17:50.430 --> 04:17:59.470]  Yes. Okay, so Dana from Mood Cannabis. Paul. Brent from Muse.
[04:18:00.670 --> 04:18:05.470]  Samantha from Evergreen. Rai from La Canapa. Please come on up.
[04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:14.750]  And then Jar, my friend, is going to help us do this game. Wonderful.
[04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:23.370]  All right, so we're gonna do this in rounds, all right? So, if you can come closest without going
[04:18:23.370 --> 04:18:36.660]  over, you will win. So, we're gonna start off with this. This is tabletop OG Chem.
[04:18:37.940 --> 04:18:45.700]  This is a tabletop OG Chem. So, this is a tabletop OG Chem. So, we're gonna start off with this.
[04:18:46.420 --> 04:18:52.500]  This is tabletop OG Chem. This is rather fast. It's not like you're gonna get all this time.
[04:18:52.500 --> 04:18:58.340]  So, okay, do you want to open it for me, though? Okay, and so you're weighing an eighth again
[04:18:58.340 --> 04:19:05.140]  without going over. Okay, and the last time I weighed it, I weighed 6.59. So, I have the fattest
[04:19:05.140 --> 04:19:15.980]  eighths. Okay, so what we're gonna do now is... Go ahead. Start. No, you're putting it in here.
[04:19:16.780 --> 04:19:24.540]  Can I look at it first? Sure, sure. Okay, use tongs, please. There we go. Okay, so you tar it.
[04:19:24.540 --> 04:19:28.460]  Yeah, and then you dish it out. They dish it out, and then you do it, okay?
[04:19:34.220 --> 04:19:39.780]  I think that's gonna be a light. Okay.
[04:19:41.460 --> 04:19:43.460]  No, it's fine. Okay, so Paul's good.
[04:19:44.100 --> 04:19:48.960]  Okay, Paul's in. Rai's putting in his guess of an eighth.
[04:19:51.280 --> 04:19:56.640]  I don't know if we have one nugget that's 3.5. Ideally, I'd like to see that, but not yet. Okay,
[04:19:56.640 --> 04:20:04.400]  okay. All right, okay. They're pretty dense, and that's the thing, right? So, some buds are
[04:20:05.120 --> 04:20:10.640]  heavier than the others because they just have more moisture content. They are more dense. They
[04:20:10.640 --> 04:20:16.720]  are not as fluffy, right? So, it could... And of course, this weight's gonna change as it dries
[04:20:16.720 --> 04:20:22.960]  out, but thankfully, we have some fresh cannabis to play with right now. All right, so we're gonna
[04:20:22.960 --> 04:20:33.670]  start weighing, and then we're not gonna show them until... Okay, so put this back.
[04:20:34.070 --> 04:21:02.520]  And then we have Corey over here. Yeah, just don't touch the table. These scales are sensitive.
[04:21:04.360 --> 04:21:34.440]  Feeling happy? Yeah, thank you, Samantha. Okay, so Rai, you weighed out 2.1.
[04:21:45.260 --> 04:21:47.740]  Corey, 2.9.
[04:21:47.740 --> 04:21:52.780]  Samantha, 2.2. And Paul, 3.49.
[04:21:55.340 --> 04:22:03.820]  A one-shot. 3.49. That is amazing. Thank you so much, Rai, for being my lovely assist...
[04:22:03.820 --> 04:22:09.100]  Jar, for being my lovely assistant. Where do you work, Jar? Nowhere currently. School.
[04:22:09.100 --> 04:22:14.060]  School. School. School. School. School. School. School. School. School. School. School. School.
[04:22:14.140 --> 04:22:22.060]  School. Okay, if you're looking for work, then I'm sure that you're in the right place, but
[04:22:22.060 --> 04:22:27.260]  thanks, Jar. Love it. Thank you. And Paul, tell me about yourself, where you're from,
[04:22:27.260 --> 04:22:33.420]  and what you do. Yeah, yeah. I work for Bazzam, and I love weighing out drugs, so
[04:22:34.540 --> 04:22:37.100]  just wanna throw down. Thanks, guys.
[04:22:37.500 --> 04:22:44.950]  Okay, so you get this prize. You're gonna get a snack box from Bazzam,
[04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:47.350]  and Paul, come on right up. You also get this.
[04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:55.910]  You can donate it to one of your fellow contestants. Yeah, I can see that. I don't need a prize.
[04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:59.510]  I'll give it to one of the... Sure, but you can get the bragging rights. You know you're ace.
[04:22:59.510 --> 04:23:05.110]  Sure, thank you. Yeah, please take a photo. There you go. Congratulations, Paul. Thank you.
[04:23:05.430 --> 04:23:16.640]  All right, so yay, that was fun. All right. Thank you so much. So we're gonna just put this back.
[04:23:19.440 --> 04:23:19.840]  Yeah.
[04:23:23.200 --> 04:23:29.360]  Okay, you know what? Let's... Since... You know what? Let's do it again with different flower.
[04:23:29.360 --> 04:23:33.520]  Oh, again? Yeah. You wanna see that? Do you wanna see a second round? Let's see with different
[04:23:33.920 --> 04:23:39.040]  flower. Okay, okay, let's do a different flower. John, I just need your help again. Okay,
[04:23:39.040 --> 04:23:46.540]  let's do it. So you wanna weigh an ounce? No, I don't have enough.
[04:23:46.540 --> 04:24:13.430]  No, that would be a struggle. Oh, sorry. I feel like...
[04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:17.110]  I feel like... Oh, we're dumping it all back.
[04:24:23.670 --> 04:24:30.390]  Okay, so this flower is Blue Cherry Pie. This is from Parkland. So only available in Alberta for
[04:24:30.390 --> 04:24:42.690]  now. Yeah, Samantha's gonna try to weigh out an eighth. And please, we're gonna be bringing up
[04:24:42.690 --> 04:24:48.290]  contestants for the speed rolling competition. So you're gonna get a gram of weed that you gotta
[04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:56.530]  keep. And if you can spin one up with the filter and it has to smoke properly, we are going to
[04:24:56.530 --> 04:25:01.650]  award you a nice prize. And you can tell these prizes are sweet, right? So it's worth it.
[04:25:10.310 --> 04:25:16.790]  Is it dense or bud? It does look dense. I really like how this bud integrity is really nice. Like,
[04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:23.430]  look at this bud. It's all whole and pieces. It's symmetrical, very similar in shape and
[04:25:23.430 --> 04:25:30.710]  bud development. Okay, yeah, you got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know, because a point,
[04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:39.990]  like 3.5 is tough, right? Okay, let's do it. Okay, and then you guys can both do it at the same time.
[04:25:41.270 --> 04:25:45.910]  Okay, because maybe Paul doesn't gotta take the prize. You know, if he's giving away this title,
[04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:48.390]  like, you know what, let's see if we can find consistency.
[04:26:51.330 --> 04:27:06.200]  No, no, no, no, you're contestant number one. That's, don't touch the table. Okay, just tar it
[04:27:06.200 --> 04:27:34.130]  again. Okay, Corey. All right, Paul. Denser buds? Yeah, it's, oh, sorry. Like, look how big this bud
[04:27:34.130 --> 04:27:58.160]  is. Like, this might be 3.5 on this. Okay. And then Rye. Yeah, I'm not gonna breathe.
[04:28:04.490 --> 04:28:16.650]  Okay, so Samantha got 2.62, a little light. Corey, 4.79, a little over. Yeah, you had a couple big
[04:28:16.650 --> 04:28:28.330]  buds in there. Paul, 3.79. A little over, but the closest. Rye, 4.47, way over, 4.47.
[04:28:29.690 --> 04:28:35.770]  Yeah, really, really dense. Okay, so Paul is kind of still in the running. Damn. Okay,
[04:28:35.770 --> 04:28:41.290]  so do you want to defend your title for the third round? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're gonna do it. Let's
[04:28:41.290 --> 04:28:51.290]  do it. You want to do another size? No, come on. Let's do another eighth. Come on, come on,
[04:28:51.290 --> 04:28:58.570]  come on. It's just another flower. Okay, so I only have enough. Okay, so we're gonna have to do this
[04:28:58.570 --> 04:29:06.330]  one live. Okay, so, because I only have a little bit of weed for this one. This is the Karma by
[04:29:06.330 --> 04:29:23.670]  Dunn Cannabis. Yeah, I'm gonna just toss this here. No, no, I'll get it. So I gotta say this
[04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:29.990]  is a sticky, sticky, sticky flower. Like, it already stuck to the tongs just by picking it up.
[04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:37.110]  And it's an interesting morphology. It's actually quite fluffy. So, but, hint,
[04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:43.590]  the fluffy, but you know, it's sticky at the same time. All right, so we're gonna do,
[04:29:44.710 --> 04:30:02.430]  okay, we'll go once. Okay. All right. Let's see what Corey has. 4.62. Oh, Corey, over two times.
[04:30:33.370 --> 04:30:39.130]  You want a little bit more? Okay. Sorry, I'm just gonna borrow this person out.
[04:30:44.810 --> 04:30:51.050]  No, no, this is, it's not cheating until it's done. Done? Done. Okay, go for it. Go for it.
[04:30:51.850 --> 04:31:00.180]  All right, Samantha. Let's see. 4.35.
[04:31:03.300 --> 04:31:11.380]  Over and over. So, Samantha, you've been under, under, and then over. Corey, you've been under,
[04:31:11.380 --> 04:31:18.180]  and then over and over just by a little bit. Okay. Let's see what Rye and Paul come to.
[04:31:19.380 --> 04:31:31.210]  Okay, let's do it. Let's see what it is. It's fun. I know a lot of people are really confident
[04:31:31.210 --> 04:31:38.730]  about this. So like, you know what, I would do this, but. Okay, so Paul's got 3.32.
[04:31:39.690 --> 04:31:50.010]  And then Rye, where are you? The last one. Rye, you were under and then over, and then now you are
[04:31:57.940 --> 04:32:03.940]  2.97. So you know what, it goes to show three times in a row. Paul's got it.
[04:32:04.500 --> 04:32:10.180]  Do you weigh it like semi-professionally? Because like, damn, you're close. Damn, you're close.
[04:32:11.140 --> 04:32:15.780]  When you're 13. Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, contestants. That was a fun,
[04:32:15.780 --> 04:32:21.060]  fun game. Thank you. Interesting how all the different buds have different weights. Yeah,
[04:32:21.060 --> 04:32:33.380]  thanks, Paul. All right. So speed rollers, speed rollers, please come on up. We have a one gram
[04:32:33.380 --> 04:32:39.940]  roll with a filter. This is a fun one. And the speed rolling competition is going to get a
[04:32:39.940 --> 04:32:49.220]  Bezam napping pillow and a gift bag from Western Cannabis. So please take a seat. Speed rollers.
[04:32:51.620 --> 04:32:54.180]  And we actually have the flower pre-ground for you.
[04:33:07.850 --> 04:33:14.090]  Yes. So brought to you by Pistil and Paris. Let's do this. We need some ground flower. We have some
[04:33:14.090 --> 04:33:21.770]  papers. The rule is it has to be with the filter, smokeable, nice and tight. And Ian, are you
[04:33:21.770 --> 04:33:31.050]  participating? Or are you the judge? What do you want? Do you want to play or do you want to?
[04:33:31.050 --> 04:33:37.450]  I kind of want to play. Then play. Then play. Samantha, play. Yeah, come. Come, come, come,
[04:33:37.450 --> 04:33:42.810]  come, come. There we go. You got to keep the weed. I don't have to sign up. You don't have to sign up.
[04:33:42.810 --> 04:33:50.810]  You can play. Just play. Here we go. All right. So it's got to be under two minutes. We're going to get you
[04:33:50.810 --> 04:34:02.580]  the bud. Okay. This is kind of like a semi tray. Oops. That's a lot. That's... Come on.
[04:34:03.940 --> 04:34:12.500]  You see this? How's that one gram? Well, just one gram. Gee. No.
[04:34:15.620 --> 04:34:22.340]  There you go. Like that. Yeah, that's more than a gram. That's way more than a gram.
[04:34:23.380 --> 04:34:26.260]  Yeesh. Whoever finishes first.
[04:34:31.140 --> 04:34:34.980]  You're not allowed to pre-roll your filter. You're not allowed to do anything.
[04:34:35.860 --> 04:34:42.260]  You are starting fresh. Oh, look, we did pre-roll your filters. Okay, fine. Fine. Fine.
[04:34:45.300 --> 04:34:49.780]  No, no, no. I want to see you do it from scratch, man. Okay. It's from scratch.
[04:34:52.900 --> 04:34:59.780]  Yeah. You don't get to pre-roll your filter. Yeah, yeah. It's all good. Okay. Where's...
[04:34:59.780 --> 04:35:08.120]  Everybody have their flower? No. You're doing it from scratch.
[04:35:08.520 --> 04:35:20.300]  Okay. Here we go. Let's get a close-up camera. Do you need a tray? Okay. Everybody have a
[04:35:20.300 --> 04:35:24.860]  healthy amount? Everybody's got a healthy amount. That's a healthy amount. All right.
[04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:35.910]  Okay. So ready? On your mark, get set, go.
[04:35:36.630 --> 04:35:39.670]  As fast as you can go. As fast as you can go.
[04:35:41.430 --> 04:35:51.250]  10 seconds. 20. Oh, nice. Okay. Keep on going. Keep on going because it's got to be a nice
[04:35:51.250 --> 04:36:01.060]  enough joint, right? It's got to be a proper joint. Okay. What's your name?
[04:36:01.060 --> 04:36:01.860]  Kaito.
[04:36:01.860 --> 04:36:08.980]  Kaito. Samantha. I also saw Henrique was done here. Yeah. Yeah.

[04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:53.070]  Kaito. That's a good joint. It's a little fluffy for my liking, but it'll burn
[04:36:54.030 --> 04:37:05.640]  with the filter proper. Okay. Who was second? Okay. That's a tight joint. That's a tight joint.
[04:37:05.640 --> 04:37:10.920]  That's a proper joint. All right. So there you go. Top two winners are going to get a prize.

[04:37:55.200 --> 04:38:01.040]  Now we're going to do Ian. You can be the judge for the most creative joint. So most creative
[04:38:01.040 --> 04:38:05.120]  joint rollers, please bring up your joints up to here. And then we're going to do,
[04:38:06.640 --> 04:38:27.900]  we're going to decide who wins. Oh, yeah. Take it. Okay. So Ian, you're going to be the judge.
[04:38:28.460 --> 04:38:34.620]  So we have Ian here. He is a master roller and he's going to be the judge for the most creative
[04:38:34.620 --> 04:38:40.220]  joint. So if you could just please introduce yourself and tell me about your joint.
[04:38:41.420 --> 04:38:50.860]  Hello, I'm Rye. I rolled a cross joint because it's a cross joint, you know, so I hope it burns
[04:38:50.860 --> 04:38:54.780]  because they usually don't, but it looks good. So that's a pass.
[04:38:57.420 --> 04:39:00.700]  I'm Andy from AR Cannabis. I wrote the T joint.
[04:39:04.860 --> 04:39:13.500]  I'm Panda and I rolled a flower. I'm Aniky and I rolled a tulip.
[04:39:19.010 --> 04:39:22.530]  First of all, I got to say all beautiful joints. I'm just going to give it the touch test because
[04:39:22.530 --> 04:39:30.900]  it's got to like actually burn all the way. It's tighter at the top, a little bit loose to the
[04:39:30.900 --> 04:39:45.380]  bottom. It might, it might just have, it might run. Let's see. Very, you know,
[04:39:45.860 --> 04:39:51.300]  this is an interesting one. I got to say the consistency of the roll, the tightness is there.
[04:39:53.940 --> 04:39:58.740]  We're going to have to burn it later. Okay. T this is a, Oh, okay. See, this is what I mean.
[04:39:58.740 --> 04:40:06.180]  When we're talking about a tight joint, I like it like this, like thick, thick, heavy and dense.
[04:40:06.180 --> 04:40:12.740]  So I know that that's, I wonder how it'll burn. Okay. So this is kind of like a cone.
[04:40:12.980 --> 04:40:17.540]  However, this one, it is tight and dense, but one is a cross joint,
[04:40:17.540 --> 04:40:25.780]  but one side is bigger than the other. So it's not as symmetrical. Okay. So Ian gets to decide.
[04:40:27.540 --> 04:40:37.190]  Okay. I think it might have to come down to smoke ability in this one.
[04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:45.030]  It's a, it's a tough call. I do like, I really like the flower. I think this is beautiful.
[04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:54.070]  I think this is the cleanest rolling work for sure. I'm wondering if there's any weed in the
[04:40:54.070 --> 04:41:01.030]  top here. Is there a weed right here? Nice. It has to be. In order to come down, it has to be.
[04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:15.030]  This cross is really, really nicely done. I think if this burns, it's a contender.
[04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:24.190]  It's tricky. Yeah. I think to the patio to test them out.
[04:41:24.670 --> 04:41:28.750]  Yeah. Let's smoke more weed.
