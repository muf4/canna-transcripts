[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  The worst thing about the NFL is being on a weight trip.
[00:03.000 --> 00:06.000]  You're playing in New England, it's cold as hell,
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  and then you've got to get on a flight, and you've got to fly all the way back home.
[00:09.000 --> 00:11.000]  I don't know if you guys have seen football players in person,
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  but a lot of those guys are pretty big.
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  I remember my rookie year, I'm sitting next to Tony Finotti.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  He's about 6'8", 370.
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  And I'm sitting next to the guy, and he's got some edible candies.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  And I asked him, I was like, you know, what are these for?
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  He's like, oh, these are my little weed candies.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  I was like, well, why do you take that? You can't take that, it's bad.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Everything that I knew about weed was bad, bad, bad.
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  You can't take that. It's against the rules.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  And he says, man, I need something that's going to help me with this inflammation in my hands.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  He says, because by the time we're at wheels up on this plane,
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  my hand's going to swell up to twice the size.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  And literally, I watched his body just bloat up.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  He told me that he was taking a lot of Percocets and Vicodins,
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  and he was getting a lot of bloating.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  I'm just seeing what damage can be done with opiates.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  I know that a lot of players were taking like candy.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  Our team physicians would just give you whatever you needed.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  I mean, especially night before a game, guys that couldn't sleep or whatnot,
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  they would sit there and give out Ambiens.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  And there's supposed to be a protocol for prescribing somebody something,
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  like what are the side effects of this?
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  Announce to them, maybe they have a contraindication with other medications people are taking,
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  or predisposed positions that might cause a psychotic break,
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  which I took Ambien one time, and one time only.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  I remember taking it, and I woke up in the middle of the night,
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  and my room was in disarray, and I didn't know what happened.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  But my roommate was sitting over on the side of the room,
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  looking like, what the hell's wrong with you?
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  And I said, I don't know what happened, man, what happened?
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.000]  He's like, you just woke up yelling, screaming, and throwing the bed.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  You threw this through the desk, everything.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Like, you're insane. I don't know what's wrong with you.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  And come to find out that Ambien had caused some type of issue in my head.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  I don't know what it was from, but I was a straight-A student my whole schooling career,
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  and I always looked at drugs as bad.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  You hear all the stories about reefer madness, and back in the day,
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  your mom was telling you, oh, that's the gateway drug,
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  and it leads you to all this other stuff, and you're going to be dumb if you smoke this,
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  or you take this, it's going to be bad.
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  So I just kind of avoided it my whole life, never really did any research on it,
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  didn't use my scientific mind to sort of figure out what the possibilities could be from using cannabis.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  So I sort of go through my whole career playing college.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  A lot of people give NFL flack for what they give the players,
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  but college is ten times worse because you've got to keep your athletes out there making money for the school,
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.000]  and the athletes are not getting compensated.
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  So what are they doing when they can't get access to the drugs is they're going to find whatever's cheap on the street,
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  which, you know, that's what you get when you go on the street.
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  So I know when I was in college, I was taking Celebrex for joint pain, inflammation, get to the league,
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  and then I was taking Vicodin.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  Vicodin made me sick, but I had to take it because I was in pain.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  So there was no alternative for that because at the time you can't take any cannabis products because it's against the rules.
