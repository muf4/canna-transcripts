[00:00.000 --> 00:02.040]  which I usually do, like, oh yeah,
[00:02.040 --> 00:03.240]  when did that show start?
[00:04.360 --> 00:06.600]  Oh yeah, I'm in Rhode Island right now,
[00:06.600 --> 00:09.720]  so I'm like trying to figure out time zones.
[00:11.040 --> 00:11.880]  Good timing.
[00:13.640 --> 00:15.480]  So we-
[00:15.480 --> 00:17.280]  Which part of Rhode Island are you at?
[00:17.280 --> 00:19.200]  Right now, well, I'm at my brother's.
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.040]  I grew up there.
[00:20.040 --> 00:25.040]  I'm in Narragansett, but right now I am-
[00:27.760 --> 00:29.160]  I used to live in Saunderstown.
[00:29.160 --> 00:30.840]  I used to live in Saunderstown right next to the,
[00:30.840 --> 00:34.000]  you know, where the ice cream shop is
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.840]  at the top of the hill there by the Jamestown Bridge,
[00:35.840 --> 00:36.680]  and that's where I used to live.
[00:36.680 --> 00:38.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.720]  So I came to visit my parents,
[00:39.720 --> 00:42.000]  but anyway, we are live right now.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.600]  Let me pop out the chat.
[00:44.600 --> 00:45.600]  Oh, where James at?
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.480]  Hey, how's it going, everybody?
[00:48.480 --> 00:49.520]  Hey, James.
[00:52.320 --> 00:53.160]  I was just asking.
[00:53.160 --> 00:54.840]  Thank you guys for coming today.
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.040]  So my name's James Loeb, and this is my new show,
[00:58.040 --> 01:01.040]  and I have three guys here with me.
[01:01.040 --> 01:03.960]  Mr. James Bean from Seeds Here Now.
[01:03.960 --> 01:07.120]  We have Adam Dunn from the Adam Dunn Show,
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.440]  and one of the founding members of TH Seeds,
[01:10.440 --> 01:14.240]  and we also have Mr. Marlon, the ganja farmer, Asher.
[01:15.080 --> 01:16.800]  Blessing, blessing to everyone.
[01:18.000 --> 01:18.840]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:19.920 --> 01:22.120]  So I wanted to talk about seeds, weed,
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.520]  and everything good today.
[01:24.800 --> 01:27.720]  So I guess let's start with kind of the industry
[01:28.400 --> 01:31.120]  and I guess I can give you guys a little history
[01:31.120 --> 01:33.200]  on each one of these guys,
[01:33.200 --> 01:36.480]  but Marlon and I have been friends since about 2012,
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.440]  and we met in Amsterdam at the High Times Cannabis Cup
[01:42.040 --> 01:43.160]  and have been friends ever since.
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.400]  We have the Ganja Farmer Seed Company we're doing together,
[01:45.400 --> 01:47.600]  and we're gonna actually be launching
[01:47.600 --> 01:49.400]  that on Seeds Here Now.
[01:50.440 --> 01:53.360]  Adam, who I've known for a really long time,
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.800]  we have a collaboration together called Dunloud,
[01:55.800 --> 01:59.480]  and Dunloud is available on Seeds Here Now.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.680]  We have some exciting stuff to talk to you guys about
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.640]  with that today.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.920]  And then James, he's from Seeds Here Now.
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.880]  He's a Mr. Guru All Things Seeds.
[02:08.880 --> 02:11.320]  So what do you guys think about right now?
[02:12.640 --> 02:13.480]  What do we think about what?
[02:13.480 --> 02:14.400]  Nice background.
[02:17.120 --> 02:18.240]  You guys hear me okay?
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.440]  Yeah.
[02:20.440 --> 02:21.280]  Yeah.
[02:21.280 --> 02:24.040]  Yeah, it was what do they think about what?
[02:24.080 --> 02:26.480]  What do you guys think about the industry right now
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.520]  as far as COVID and how's everything going for you guys?
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.360]  Well, I can start for the genetic preservation kits.
[02:39.480 --> 02:41.240]  It seems now that people have time at their house,
[02:41.240 --> 02:46.040]  they are preferring or they are deciding to spend more time
[02:46.040 --> 02:46.880]  in their gardens.
[02:46.880 --> 02:48.600]  And so their genetic preservation kits
[02:48.600 --> 02:51.600]  or sales have been steady and good.
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.160]  I see a lot more breeders going into a lot more stuff.
[02:55.160 --> 02:56.800]  Like now they have more time on their hands.
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.800]  They're of course going into their vaults and working gear
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.160]  that they may not have had time to work or finish.
[03:02.160 --> 03:04.480]  With high times, of course, of all the gatherings
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.720]  and all the, not recreational,
[03:07.720 --> 03:11.360]  but all the big corporate stuff out of the way.
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.360]  It's less, I see my breeders less often
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.280]  and I go to less trade shows.
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.400]  There's less of that income.
[03:16.400 --> 03:17.960]  The breeders are seeing less income, of course,
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.280]  because they don't have that trade show funding,
[03:20.280 --> 03:21.600]  so to say.
[03:21.600 --> 03:22.480]  Get into less states.
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.560]  I think it's put a pause on all the legalization and laws.
[03:26.560 --> 03:27.760]  At least I hope it has.
[03:29.320 --> 03:32.280]  Kind of give everybody a way to situate.
[03:32.280 --> 03:34.080]  I've recently moved to Oklahoma.
[03:34.080 --> 03:36.320]  I know it's banging out here,
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.600]  but we've seen, like I said, steady to an increase in sales.
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.600]  And as far as COVID goes, I'm fearful of a postage thing,
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  but other than that,
[03:47.920 --> 03:49.920]  I make my guys do a thermometer check when they come in
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.600]  and we wash hands and all that stuff,
[03:51.600 --> 03:52.960]  but everything's been good.
[03:55.400 --> 03:56.240]  Nice.
[03:56.240 --> 03:57.480]  So the year's been pretty good for you, I take it.
[03:57.480 --> 03:58.680]  I think you're correct.
[04:02.450 --> 04:04.850]  Yeah, I think James hit it on the head there
[04:04.850 --> 04:07.210]  as far as like, I was gonna say,
[04:07.210 --> 04:08.210]  I think James hit it on the head
[04:08.210 --> 04:10.290]  as far as we all have a lot more time on our hands,
[04:10.290 --> 04:11.130]  that's for sure.
[04:11.850 --> 04:16.490]  And I think gardens have improved incredibly
[04:16.490 --> 04:18.650]  just because of the fact that we're not running around
[04:18.650 --> 04:21.410]  to all these trade shows and half the time coming back
[04:21.410 --> 04:23.970]  to find out that the person you left in charge
[04:23.970 --> 04:25.610]  didn't do their job, right?
[04:25.610 --> 04:30.610]  So I feel like the plants have got a lot of benefit
[04:31.090 --> 04:34.090]  out of this COVID, but unfortunately, as far as social,
[04:34.090 --> 04:36.290]  no, that's been difficult.
[04:36.290 --> 04:39.930]  And as far as to really get behind promotions
[04:39.970 --> 04:41.210]  and to get behind things,
[04:41.210 --> 04:43.250]  it seems like we're all in this weird funk
[04:43.250 --> 04:44.090]  when it comes to that.
[04:44.090 --> 04:49.090]  So I haven't seen a lot of overly exciting things happening
[04:49.170 --> 04:51.130]  when it comes to like, the fact that people
[04:51.130 --> 04:53.450]  just are kind of locked up in their own little zones,
[04:53.450 --> 04:56.450]  but I do think that the quality of the plants
[04:56.450 --> 04:58.050]  and the fact that people now have a chance
[04:58.050 --> 05:00.490]  to go through their old shit, like James was saying,
[05:00.490 --> 05:03.770]  you're gonna see a lot of stuff coming out of this,
[05:03.770 --> 05:04.610]  in my opinion.
[05:05.490 --> 05:07.530]  And I love the fact that everybody's now,
[05:07.530 --> 05:09.130]  the one thing I could say about COVID
[05:09.130 --> 05:13.330]  and this whole thing is, I think a lot of us needed time
[05:13.330 --> 05:15.250]  to fucking focus on what we're doing,
[05:15.250 --> 05:17.330]  because a lot of us are moving so fast.
[05:17.330 --> 05:20.290]  And with breeding, it's like, you can't really move fast.
[05:20.290 --> 05:21.690]  It's a slow process, you know what I mean?
[05:21.690 --> 05:26.570]  It takes a long time and things that take years for us,
[05:26.570 --> 05:28.690]  a lot of these projects, you might start in one year
[05:28.690 --> 05:30.010]  and you might not finish in five years
[05:30.010 --> 05:31.170]  till five or six years later.
[05:31.170 --> 05:34.330]  So time is on our side, I guess,
[05:34.330 --> 05:35.850]  when it comes to those things.
[05:36.850 --> 05:37.690]  Yeah.
[05:37.690 --> 05:38.530]  Yeah, totally.
[05:38.530 --> 05:39.370]  And just to add to your point,
[05:39.370 --> 05:42.130]  I think that they also just by nature,
[05:42.130 --> 05:44.650]  growers are already kind of quarantining themselves.
[05:44.650 --> 05:46.890]  I know that when I would trim or I would bring down a crop,
[05:46.890 --> 05:48.770]  there was nobody coming to my house for two weeks.
[05:48.770 --> 05:50.130]  Nobody was leaving my house for two weeks.
[05:50.130 --> 05:51.050]  We didn't have delivery guys,
[05:51.050 --> 05:53.290]  there was no door dash shit kind of stuff.
[05:53.290 --> 05:55.850]  And then we went to the local 7-Eleven even to go get drinks
[05:55.850 --> 05:56.890]  everything was brought in,
[05:56.890 --> 05:58.170]  because I didn't want anything to smell.
[05:58.170 --> 06:01.210]  And so, I think that just by nature,
[06:01.210 --> 06:03.570]  growers are usually quarantining themselves,
[06:03.570 --> 06:05.050]  are used to it.
[06:05.090 --> 06:09.330]  Yeah, I think with this time that what's going on,
[06:09.330 --> 06:13.410]  you know, a lot of people thinking wellness,
[06:13.410 --> 06:14.810]  well, that's as far as I've seen.
[06:14.810 --> 06:17.170]  A lot of people thinking a wellness box,
[06:17.170 --> 06:18.650]  a wellness package, you know?
[06:18.650 --> 06:20.890]  So that's what I've been seeing lately.
[06:20.890 --> 06:24.130]  And I think after the COVID,
[06:24.130 --> 06:27.650]  CBD products would do well too.
[06:27.650 --> 06:29.890]  Because a lot of people now have the time home
[06:29.890 --> 06:32.010]  and trying it and you know,
[06:32.010 --> 06:34.770]  so as far as the industry is going,
[06:35.490 --> 06:38.090]  I think we may have to look out for a boom
[06:38.090 --> 06:39.450]  in the industry after this,
[06:39.450 --> 06:42.930]  because of everyone having ideas at home
[06:42.930 --> 06:44.890]  and ready to do something different,
[06:44.890 --> 06:45.850]  you know, with themselves.
[06:45.850 --> 06:48.370]  So it's gonna be interesting.
[06:49.690 --> 06:53.370]  That and I know that it's already had a effect
[06:53.370 --> 06:54.810]  on the traditional market, so to say,
[06:54.810 --> 06:58.050]  like traditional market prices are in the threes I've heard.
[06:58.050 --> 07:00.450]  Some people, you know, high threes.
[07:00.450 --> 07:02.210]  That's something that hasn't been seen a long time.
[07:02.330 --> 07:05.410]  And so, you know, it's obviously more.
[07:06.650 --> 07:10.570]  Yeah, I would say that stuff is going in the five.
[07:11.970 --> 07:15.850]  The exotic market is going, you know, $5,000 a pound.
[07:15.850 --> 07:19.290]  Seeing pictures on Instagram and people talking about stuff
[07:19.290 --> 07:21.330]  that's going for $10,000 a pound.
[07:21.330 --> 07:23.570]  I just, you know, that's the high end,
[07:24.450 --> 07:28.170]  like the exotic market that people are going crazy for.
[07:28.170 --> 07:29.930]  You know, there's those elite strains
[07:29.930 --> 07:32.090]  and, you know, a lot of it's coming,
[07:32.090 --> 07:34.410]  the California-based variety genetics,
[07:34.410 --> 07:37.370]  I see that as going for really high dollars.
[07:37.370 --> 07:40.530]  You know, and I just wanna touch back on with Marlon.
[07:40.530 --> 07:42.850]  Him and I were working in Trinidad
[07:42.850 --> 07:45.570]  and in St. Vincent a year ago,
[07:45.570 --> 07:47.890]  and, you know, all the way through the first of the year.
[07:47.890 --> 07:50.890]  And then with COVID, you know, that's really put a,
[07:50.890 --> 07:54.210]  you know, a big, huge stop in what we were doing.
[07:55.650 --> 07:56.890]  You know, what do you think about
[07:56.890 --> 07:58.850]  when that's gonna come back online, Marlon?
[07:58.850 --> 08:03.850]  And, you know, how do you feel about that?
[08:03.890 --> 08:08.730]  Actually, I had a call from over there, you know,
[08:08.730 --> 08:12.850]  and they were saying that a few people now
[08:12.850 --> 08:17.330]  are being licensed and that they think we should try
[08:17.330 --> 08:19.970]  and do conference call with the minister
[08:19.970 --> 08:21.530]  because we do have his number.
[08:22.850 --> 08:27.290]  They suggested that we get in touch with the minister
[08:27.290 --> 08:29.090]  as soon as possible.
[08:29.090 --> 08:30.210]  It's a good thing you say that
[08:30.210 --> 08:33.170]  because I just remember that while you're talking there.
[08:33.170 --> 08:34.450]  You know what I'm saying?
[08:34.450 --> 08:37.050]  And what is going on down there is that
[08:38.770 --> 08:41.610]  once we go there, everything's good there,
[08:41.610 --> 08:45.090]  but it's to leave and get there is the problem.
[08:45.090 --> 08:49.450]  So, you know, we could travel there right now,
[08:49.450 --> 08:51.490]  but we can't.
[08:51.490 --> 08:55.930]  The problem is we have to land in a neighboring island
[08:55.930 --> 09:00.930]  to go there, like from Trinidad to St. Vincent, you know?
[09:01.290 --> 09:06.290]  And these borders are still closed and COVID numbers rising.
[09:07.330 --> 09:10.690]  So it's gonna be a little while before we get there,
[09:10.690 --> 09:14.450]  but they do suggest that we try
[09:14.450 --> 09:16.890]  and get in contact with the minister.
[09:16.890 --> 09:19.810]  And James, we're gonna have a meeting soon, you know,
[09:19.810 --> 09:22.170]  so probably in LA.
[09:22.170 --> 09:24.530]  So we'll try and do that,
[09:24.530 --> 09:27.170]  get that covered when we sit down, you know?
[09:28.970 --> 09:29.810]  Yeah, excellent.
[09:29.810 --> 09:30.650]  Yeah, so Marlon and I have
[09:30.650 --> 09:33.210]  the Ganja Farmer Seed Company together.
[09:33.210 --> 09:35.330]  We're about to launch in California
[09:35.330 --> 09:37.210]  and through seeds here now.
[09:37.210 --> 09:41.330]  And the goal was to be in Spain and the Caribbean this year,
[09:41.330 --> 09:45.250]  but it looks like we're gonna be pushing for 2021 for that.
[09:46.130 --> 09:48.130]  We have a bunch of varieties,
[09:48.130 --> 09:51.170]  some equatorial fun stuff that we've been working with,
[09:51.170 --> 09:54.130]  and also some of the modern trendy stuff.
[09:54.730 --> 09:57.250]  We've got some gelato crosses and OG.
[09:57.250 --> 10:00.730]  You know, Marlon and I kind of bonded over OG Kush
[10:00.730 --> 10:02.370]  many years ago, and it's still...
[10:04.770 --> 10:07.490]  So what are your guys' favorite strains right now?
[10:09.210 --> 10:10.690]  Marlon, we wanna start with you.
[10:12.050 --> 10:17.050]  Well, right now I kind of like the GMO, you know?
[10:17.890 --> 10:20.010]  That's just my go-to strain these days
[10:20.010 --> 10:24.410]  because it's kind of where I like to be at
[10:24.410 --> 10:29.410]  as far as something that I would like to smoke personally.
[10:29.410 --> 10:31.130]  So for me, it's a GMO.
[10:33.130 --> 10:36.170]  Yeah, we were doing dabs like not that long ago.
[10:36.170 --> 10:37.450]  And I remember you went outside
[10:37.450 --> 10:39.490]  and had to smoke a joint of some GMO afterwards
[10:39.490 --> 10:41.650]  because the dabs were too strong.
[10:41.650 --> 10:42.490]  Yeah.
[10:44.210 --> 10:46.290]  Don't be like me, you know?
[10:46.290 --> 10:48.290]  Because it's really strong, you know?
[10:48.290 --> 10:49.210]  And I like that.
[10:51.010 --> 10:51.850]  Nice.
[10:51.850 --> 10:55.450]  James, what do you think about the current favorites?
[10:55.450 --> 10:58.250]  What's your favorite genetics right now
[10:58.250 --> 11:00.610]  that people have available?
[11:00.610 --> 11:03.410]  Just a real quick shout out to fucking OG Kush.
[11:03.410 --> 11:06.730]  Like that thing has brought so many people together
[11:06.730 --> 11:08.170]  around the world, and there are people
[11:08.170 --> 11:09.050]  you wouldn't think you'd meet,
[11:09.050 --> 11:09.970]  or people that you didn't think
[11:09.970 --> 11:11.410]  would have the same interests as you,
[11:11.410 --> 11:13.330]  and yet you bond over fucking weed, you know what I mean?
[11:13.330 --> 11:15.450]  Like, shout out to OG Kush, first of all.
[11:15.450 --> 11:16.450]  Yeah, we love this.
[11:17.450 --> 11:19.930]  Yeah, I mean, I might not be...
[11:22.450 --> 11:24.570]  Yeah, well, shout out to Josh D and the boys there
[11:24.570 --> 11:26.850]  for making that happen back in the day, right?
[11:26.850 --> 11:27.690]  Yeah, for sure.
[11:29.050 --> 11:29.890]  But I've been...
[11:29.890 --> 11:31.210]  And on that note...
[11:31.210 --> 11:32.050]  Go ahead.
[11:33.930 --> 11:35.250]  Yeah.
[11:35.250 --> 11:36.250]  Oh, no, I was gonna say, on that note,
[11:36.250 --> 11:39.090]  I've been smoking a lot of triangle OG lately.
[11:39.090 --> 11:42.770]  That's been my go-to, but that's just
[11:42.770 --> 11:44.730]  because I have a bunch of it, right?
[11:46.450 --> 11:47.290]  Yeah.
[11:49.370 --> 11:50.210]  Thanks.
[11:52.330 --> 11:54.650]  James, what have you been smoking on?
[11:54.650 --> 11:55.690]  Oklahoma weed.
[11:56.970 --> 11:58.930]  Actually, I haven't gotten any Oklahoma weed yet.
[11:58.930 --> 12:00.290]  I'm still waiting.
[12:00.290 --> 12:03.050]  There's a Spintree, but I haven't walked in on it.
[12:03.050 --> 12:04.050]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[12:04.050 --> 12:05.930]  I got my Smoke-La-Homa shirt on.
[12:05.930 --> 12:07.810]  Smoke-La-Homa, right there.
[12:07.810 --> 12:08.730]  Got the shirt on.
[12:09.810 --> 12:10.650]  Oh, nice.
[12:10.650 --> 12:12.170]  It's Smoke-La-Homa.
[12:13.410 --> 12:15.210]  Represent, represent.
[12:15.850 --> 12:17.330]  Spintree's a telephone pole.
[12:19.850 --> 12:21.570]  But besides that, it's been nice.
[12:21.570 --> 12:23.890]  I haven't had any smoke yet.
[12:23.890 --> 12:25.450]  I've yet to meet up with Keith and Grace,
[12:25.450 --> 12:27.890]  calling the guys up there, and Rob.
[12:27.890 --> 12:29.250]  I'm sure they'll have some flowers for me,
[12:29.250 --> 12:31.010]  but I've been blessed enough to have
[12:31.010 --> 12:32.970]  some exotic jars lying around.
[12:32.970 --> 12:35.090]  I've had the OMFG and the Pop Scotty,
[12:35.090 --> 12:37.090]  and those have just been killing it for me.
[12:37.090 --> 12:40.690]  The Pop Scotty's got that flavor, that appeal,
[12:40.690 --> 12:42.930]  that when you pop the jar, you just like,
[12:42.930 --> 12:44.450]  wanna just bury your nose in it.
[12:44.730 --> 12:46.490]  And then the Jigglers that he gave me as well,
[12:46.490 --> 12:48.850]  it's also just great colorage and great,
[12:48.850 --> 12:50.330]  great bag of fuel, so to say,
[12:50.330 --> 12:52.450]  but then it also just, it's definitely a knockout weed.
[12:52.450 --> 12:54.930]  It's, if you plan on doing something later,
[12:54.930 --> 12:56.130]  don't do something, don't smoke,
[12:56.130 --> 12:56.970]  do Jigglers.
[12:56.970 --> 12:58.810]  And that's coming from a seasoned smoker,
[12:58.810 --> 13:03.170]  so it's definitely, those have been my go-to's.
[13:03.170 --> 13:04.610]  I think I'll have to try that.
[13:04.610 --> 13:06.210]  It's a good name, too.
[13:06.210 --> 13:07.050]  It was good, man.
[13:07.050 --> 13:07.890]  It was really good.
[13:07.890 --> 13:08.930]  It was nice, Jigglers.
[13:10.450 --> 13:12.610]  But it doesn't sound like a good one for,
[13:12.650 --> 13:14.450]  it doesn't sound like a good one
[13:14.450 --> 13:15.650]  for spitting bars though, Marlon.
[13:15.650 --> 13:16.970]  I don't know, something called gibberish,
[13:16.970 --> 13:19.050]  you might not wanna be getting to on that one
[13:19.050 --> 13:20.490]  before you start singing, so.
[13:20.490 --> 13:21.330]  Jigglers.
[13:21.330 --> 13:22.850]  Yeah, sometimes.
[13:22.850 --> 13:23.690]  Go ahead.
[13:23.690 --> 13:25.210]  Oh, I thought it was gibberish.
[13:25.210 --> 13:26.290]  Gibberish is a good name, too, though.
[13:26.290 --> 13:27.130]  I like that.
[13:29.130 --> 13:29.970]  I was right.
[13:31.250 --> 13:32.090]  Jigglers.
[13:33.170 --> 13:34.010]  Yeah, so.
[13:34.010 --> 13:36.410]  I'm gonna write it down.
[13:36.410 --> 13:37.570]  You guys seen the Pluto?
[13:37.570 --> 13:40.770]  I think that's one of the bigger ones in the Bay Area.
[13:40.810 --> 13:42.770]  I think it peaked kind of earlier in the year.
[13:42.770 --> 13:44.010]  That's one of my favorites.
[13:44.010 --> 13:46.250]  Sorry, say the name again.
[13:46.250 --> 13:47.090]  Pluto?
[13:47.090 --> 13:48.330]  Pluto.
[13:48.330 --> 13:50.650]  And gibberish, yeah.
[13:50.650 --> 13:52.290]  That's a great name for a strange.
[13:54.290 --> 13:55.450]  See, we're all on it.
[13:56.450 --> 13:57.330]  Everyone's on it now.
[13:57.330 --> 13:58.730]  We're all writing it down.
[13:58.730 --> 14:00.770]  I just want 10%, that's all I ask.
[14:00.770 --> 14:01.650]  10%.
[14:01.650 --> 14:02.690]  Yeah, so Pluto.
[14:02.690 --> 14:04.730]  And I think Pluto is a perfect example
[14:04.730 --> 14:09.090]  of kind of the new, more trendy, modern style stuff
[14:09.130 --> 14:11.050]  that has come into fruition,
[14:11.050 --> 14:12.490]  where we've gone back to purple
[14:12.490 --> 14:15.570]  and everybody wanted this purple color in their exotics.
[14:16.490 --> 14:18.930]  It's almost a stamp that exotic doesn't have.
[14:21.050 --> 14:22.730]  What do you guys think about that?
[14:26.140 --> 14:27.380]  James?
[14:27.380 --> 14:28.980]  Isn't it, isn't it, is it?
[14:28.980 --> 14:29.820]  Okay, go ahead.
[14:29.820 --> 14:30.660]  So, I'll start.
[14:30.660 --> 14:33.700]  So, the purple for me, just plain flat out,
[14:33.700 --> 14:35.060]  I believe is medicine weed.
[14:35.060 --> 14:37.060]  Like, it helps Matt Farmer.
[14:37.060 --> 14:38.540]  He's got a list of ailments,
[14:38.540 --> 14:40.140]  and it seems that he's tried everything,
[14:40.540 --> 14:41.380]  and it helps him.
[14:41.380 --> 14:42.660]  And then when you look at Phylos, you know,
[14:42.660 --> 14:44.140]  uh-oh, bad name, bad name.
[14:44.140 --> 14:47.060]  But when you go look at the Phylos galaxy for what it's worth,
[14:47.060 --> 14:48.860]  the purples stand out like Pluto.
[14:48.860 --> 14:50.340]  They're way out there, you know what I mean?
[14:50.340 --> 14:53.740]  They're not, you know, the Kim's cluster,
[14:53.740 --> 14:56.060]  the Haze's cluster, the Afghani's cluster,
[14:56.060 --> 15:01.060]  but like, the purples and lavender and whatnot,
[15:01.140 --> 15:03.500]  all like Pluto, they're way the hell out there.
[15:03.500 --> 15:06.020]  And so, I think there's something to that as well.
[15:06.020 --> 15:07.340]  So, I believe that they're heavy medical strains.
[15:07.340 --> 15:08.660]  So, it's kind of nice that they see that,
[15:08.660 --> 15:11.460]  and bringing it in to today's modern bag appeal.
[15:11.460 --> 15:13.540]  Because yeah, I mean, green weed was cool last year.
[15:13.540 --> 15:14.580]  Now they want something purple.
[15:14.580 --> 15:15.740]  Next year, they'll want something red,
[15:15.740 --> 15:17.660]  or, you know, black beers, you know?
[15:18.820 --> 15:23.820]  But if you get a purple strain with the bag appeal
[15:24.220 --> 15:27.420]  like the GDP had back in the days,
[15:27.420 --> 15:28.940]  well, I guess, you know,
[15:28.940 --> 15:31.820]  purple strain will be something to reckon with.
[15:31.820 --> 15:36.260]  But the Pluto for me, you know,
[15:36.260 --> 15:38.300]  it's nice and everything,
[15:38.940 --> 15:41.260]  but it doesn't have that, you know,
[15:41.260 --> 15:43.340]  full effect that I,
[15:43.340 --> 15:45.780]  the punch that I like when I'm smoking, you know?
[15:46.940 --> 15:49.620]  So, as far as that purple strain go,
[15:49.620 --> 15:54.100]  I think, I don't think I'll be such a fan of the Pluto.
[15:54.100 --> 15:54.940]  You know?
[15:56.260 --> 15:57.860]  That's personally speaking.
[16:00.500 --> 16:01.340]  Yeah, I tried.
[16:01.340 --> 16:06.340]  I will try it myself, but purple in general,
[16:06.620 --> 16:10.180]  I think is, it's funny because you,
[16:10.180 --> 16:12.100]  there's been a lot of bunk purple strains
[16:12.100 --> 16:13.060]  out there over the years,
[16:13.060 --> 16:15.660]  and that's kind of like thrown people off where,
[16:15.660 --> 16:18.060]  you know, at the same time,
[16:18.900 --> 16:21.220]  how many of us as growers have had, you know,
[16:21.220 --> 16:23.460]  people respond when you show them something
[16:23.460 --> 16:26.540]  that's really got purple, not from genetics,
[16:26.540 --> 16:28.180]  but just from cold, for instance, right?
[16:28.180 --> 16:29.860]  And all of a sudden you're like,
[16:29.860 --> 16:33.060]  what, you want to pay me more because it's purple?
[16:33.060 --> 16:33.900]  Okay, I guess so.
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.340]  But let me pause you, Dan.
[16:35.340 --> 16:36.180]  Let me pause you.
[16:36.180 --> 16:37.020]  When I said genetic?
[16:37.020 --> 16:38.860]  What if you said, you know,
[16:38.860 --> 16:41.420]  purple strains in the past were bunk?
[16:41.420 --> 16:43.260]  What if they just had more CBD?
[16:43.260 --> 16:45.020]  Like I'm saying, they're more on the medicinal side.
[16:45.020 --> 16:47.140]  Back then we weren't testing CBD or THC,
[16:47.140 --> 16:48.780]  but what if that's why they were bunk?
[16:48.780 --> 16:49.620]  Because they just didn't have,
[16:49.620 --> 16:51.740]  they had like 10 or 15% CBD in them.
[16:51.740 --> 16:52.580]  Yeah, I agree.
[16:54.740 --> 16:55.740]  Right, I agree.
[16:55.740 --> 16:59.620]  And then, and so I've seen over the years,
[16:59.620 --> 17:00.780]  like I remember back in the day
[17:00.780 --> 17:03.900]  when like SSSC catalogs came out and stuff,
[17:03.900 --> 17:06.060]  they had a lot of their strains were,
[17:06.060 --> 17:08.140]  a lot of the purple strains were huge yielders,
[17:08.140 --> 17:09.700]  amazing yielders, and they grew great,
[17:09.700 --> 17:12.580]  but they just didn't have that high punch,
[17:12.580 --> 17:13.420]  like you were saying,
[17:13.420 --> 17:15.580]  but they definitely worked,
[17:16.820 --> 17:18.740]  and as James was saying, medicinally.
[17:18.740 --> 17:21.820]  And I think purple strains always have their place,
[17:21.820 --> 17:24.620]  but I also, what I'm kind of waiting for
[17:24.620 --> 17:26.220]  is to get back to those electric,
[17:26.220 --> 17:29.260]  I love those electric green kind of strains
[17:29.260 --> 17:30.420]  that are hard to find these days
[17:30.420 --> 17:31.740]  where you just don't see them very often.
[17:31.900 --> 17:33.940]  Everything's kind of like muted out,
[17:33.940 --> 17:37.900]  but purple for sure is,
[17:37.900 --> 17:40.980]  it's always a winner in the bag of BLS for sure.
[17:42.220 --> 17:43.060]  It can be.
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.700]  More stuff like triangle cushion,
[17:46.700 --> 17:49.020]  some of those electric colored strains.
[17:49.020 --> 17:51.300]  I mean, we had this Maui Wowie
[17:51.300 --> 17:52.780]  that we used to get back in the day
[17:52.780 --> 17:55.420]  and it was velvety and bright green,
[17:57.140 --> 17:58.500]  and you just don't see a lot of stuff.
[17:58.500 --> 18:00.660]  I mean, I would really love to see stuff
[18:00.660 --> 18:05.660]  like cat piss and some of those type of flavor profiles
[18:05.900 --> 18:07.100]  come back.
[18:07.100 --> 18:08.620]  I think we're missing some of that stuff
[18:08.620 --> 18:11.660]  that smells up the whole room.
[18:12.700 --> 18:16.340]  And I keep talking about the shows,
[18:16.340 --> 18:20.620]  but yeah, flavor profile too.
[18:20.620 --> 18:24.660]  I have the one that I have recently that fits that one,
[18:24.660 --> 18:27.060]  which I got back from my buddy Andy
[18:27.060 --> 18:30.540]  was an old Saga Mata strain,
[18:31.420 --> 18:32.260]  which was a slider,
[18:32.260 --> 18:37.260]  which was a Northern Light 2 cross.
[18:37.380 --> 18:41.980]  And it's, I mean, it is electric green
[18:41.980 --> 18:44.100]  and it literally has almost a hazy smell to it.
[18:44.100 --> 18:45.980]  People get really, like every time I show somebody,
[18:45.980 --> 18:46.820]  they go, is that a haze?
[18:46.820 --> 18:48.060]  And it's like, no, it's an afghan,
[18:48.060 --> 18:52.620]  but it's definitely got that pungent cat piss
[18:52.620 --> 18:54.500]  sort of high end note to it.
[18:54.500 --> 18:56.180]  It's not cat pissy on the bottom side,
[18:56.180 --> 18:59.860]  but on the top end it has that little pissy top end
[19:00.140 --> 19:04.740]  is kind of a hazy, almost a characteristic.
[19:04.740 --> 19:05.580]  It's awesome.
[19:05.580 --> 19:06.420]  I like it.
[19:06.420 --> 19:07.660]  It's a nightmare to grow though.
[19:07.660 --> 19:10.180]  The thing grows like all over the place
[19:10.180 --> 19:12.660]  and you have to string it up with tons of support.
[19:12.660 --> 19:14.700]  But besides that, it's an amazing strain.
[19:16.340 --> 19:20.180]  Let me ask you guys something.
[19:20.180 --> 19:24.780]  What do you guys think about where weed
[19:24.780 --> 19:28.020]  is going to be in the future in terms of structure
[19:28.020 --> 19:33.020]  and in terms of flavors and with all the new,
[19:33.740 --> 19:36.100]  you know, stuff that's going on with weed,
[19:36.100 --> 19:39.700]  all the turps flavor and people spraying and all that.
[19:39.700 --> 19:41.860]  What do you guys think about that?
[19:41.860 --> 19:45.940]  Where do you think it's going to go in the near future?
[19:46.860 --> 19:47.700]  So I'll give you my-
[19:47.700 --> 19:51.660]  When you say spraying, are you talking about after?
[19:51.660 --> 19:53.500]  But yeah, after the weeds grow,
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.260]  they turp it up and stuff, you know?
[19:55.260 --> 19:56.100]  Go ahead.
[19:56.100 --> 19:57.900]  They're trying to do all kinds of different stuff
[19:58.740 --> 19:59.580]  with the herbs.
[19:59.580 --> 20:04.020]  So my opinion on it,
[20:04.020 --> 20:06.260]  and I think it ties into what James Loud was saying,
[20:06.260 --> 20:08.860]  is that we're kind of, you know,
[20:08.860 --> 20:10.140]  one of my favorite plants to grow
[20:10.140 --> 20:11.740]  is this old Thai plant I had.
[20:11.740 --> 20:13.820]  And it was just, it smelled like rotten shoes,
[20:13.820 --> 20:16.460]  like dead body and like rotting corpse.
[20:16.460 --> 20:17.500]  It was just kind of nasty.
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.460]  Like you hit it and then you'd be like,
[20:18.460 --> 20:19.300]  oh man, that's bad.
[20:19.300 --> 20:21.060]  And then you'd go back to the plant and smell it again
[20:21.060 --> 20:24.340]  just to make sure that it was that nasty that you smell.
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.020]  But I don't think that I want to dab
[20:26.020 --> 20:27.860]  something that's called rotten toe jam.
[20:27.860 --> 20:28.700]  You know what I mean?
[20:28.700 --> 20:30.420]  Like it may be awesome to smoke and flower,
[20:30.420 --> 20:33.020]  but to dab it or to have a concentrate of it
[20:33.020 --> 20:34.220]  or to pull those turps
[20:34.220 --> 20:37.820]  in an even louder representation of them, so to say,
[20:37.820 --> 20:39.580]  that's maybe that's not tasty.
[20:39.580 --> 20:40.420]  You know what I mean?
[20:40.420 --> 20:41.900]  And I see the market right now is a lot of desserts.
[20:41.900 --> 20:43.580]  It's a lot of sweet things.
[20:43.580 --> 20:44.620]  It's a lot of candies.
[20:44.620 --> 20:45.460]  It's a lot of fruits.
[20:45.460 --> 20:46.860]  It's a lot of, you know what I mean?
[20:46.860 --> 20:49.460]  It's kind of like, not to compare it, I guess,
[20:49.460 --> 20:50.300]  because I wasn't there,
[20:50.300 --> 20:52.580]  but I know that the Dutch, when they had the skunk,
[20:52.580 --> 20:54.460]  they went towards the sweet side of the plant
[20:54.460 --> 20:55.780]  instead of the rotten side.
[20:56.540 --> 20:57.380]  And I think that, you know,
[20:57.380 --> 20:59.100]  maybe the US industry is seeing a little bit of that
[20:59.100 --> 21:01.260]  because I know we sell more sweet seeds
[21:01.260 --> 21:02.500]  than we do rotten seeds.
[21:04.780 --> 21:06.980]  What about rotten toe jam times gibberish?
[21:06.980 --> 21:08.740]  What about rotten toe jam times gibberish?
[21:08.740 --> 21:09.780]  Would you go for that?
[21:09.780 --> 21:10.620]  I wouldn't want to dab that.
[21:10.620 --> 21:12.900]  If you gave me some strawberry cake, I'd be like, yeah,
[21:12.900 --> 21:14.740]  let me give you some strawberry cake.
[21:16.700 --> 21:17.540]  Yeah, for sure.
[21:17.540 --> 21:19.900]  I mean, I see a lot of the rename game going on
[21:19.900 --> 21:22.100]  in the metric market in California.
[21:22.100 --> 21:25.860]  I mean, I see people just renaming older varieties
[21:25.860 --> 21:27.460]  as new stuff all the time.
[21:27.460 --> 21:30.300]  It's like, it's kind of the name of the game,
[21:30.300 --> 21:33.180]  but as far as the future, Marlon,
[21:33.180 --> 21:34.300]  I think that's a great question.
[21:34.300 --> 21:35.700]  I mean, I feel like breeding
[21:35.700 --> 21:37.140]  is just getting better and better.
[21:37.140 --> 21:39.700]  We're getting more technical.
[21:39.700 --> 21:41.740]  We're getting way smarter about what we're doing.
[21:41.740 --> 21:44.340]  And these projects that are taking a lot of time,
[21:44.340 --> 21:47.140]  I feel like they're going to come to fruition
[21:47.140 --> 21:48.020]  in the near future.
[21:48.020 --> 21:51.820]  I feel like the hype train is just,
[21:52.580 --> 21:53.420]  I don't know if it's ever going to end,
[21:53.420 --> 21:55.500]  but I would like it to end because I feel like
[21:55.500 --> 21:58.900]  so many people are still just breeding for those F1s,
[21:58.900 --> 22:01.100]  those complex polyhybrids.
[22:01.100 --> 22:03.340]  And those complex polyhybrids,
[22:03.340 --> 22:06.500]  as far as from a seed perspective, is not a great thing.
[22:06.500 --> 22:09.540]  And we're the only market in the whole world,
[22:09.540 --> 22:12.180]  as far as agriculture is concerned,
[22:12.180 --> 22:13.620]  that has unstable genetics
[22:13.620 --> 22:15.140]  that are being released to the public.
[22:15.140 --> 22:18.020]  You look at tomatoes, you look at asparagus,
[22:18.020 --> 22:21.100]  you look at any of those seed vegetables,
[22:21.100 --> 22:22.780]  and they're all stable genetics.
[22:22.780 --> 22:26.780]  And I feel like the industry has to go that way.
[22:26.780 --> 22:28.620]  But along the way, I think that we'll be able
[22:28.620 --> 22:32.340]  to do some fun things, find some new novel genetics,
[22:32.340 --> 22:37.140]  improve structure along with taste and flavor profile.
[22:37.140 --> 22:38.700]  I don't want to just say terpene profile
[22:38.700 --> 22:40.620]  because some of the flavors that you're tasting
[22:40.620 --> 22:42.140]  aren't just terpenes.
[22:42.140 --> 22:44.780]  But I think breeding is going to improve.
[22:46.060 --> 22:48.620]  Now we're able to do analytics and driven.
[22:48.660 --> 22:50.980]  Yeah, and not to cut you off, James,
[22:50.980 --> 22:52.300]  but are you talking CRISPR?
[22:52.300 --> 22:53.220]  I mean, is that what we're talking
[22:53.220 --> 22:55.740]  in order to get this new stable plan?
[22:55.740 --> 22:58.020]  Are we talking CRISPR machine?
[22:58.020 --> 22:59.140]  No, you know what?
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.500]  The thing is, is I get a lot of shit
[23:00.500 --> 23:04.460]  because I think that CRISPR is a tool
[23:04.460 --> 23:08.860]  that should be not necessarily used to breed with,
[23:08.860 --> 23:11.580]  but we should be experimenting with different things.
[23:11.580 --> 23:14.100]  I have no problem with science,
[23:14.100 --> 23:16.260]  but what I'm talking about is analytic driven breeding.
[23:16.260 --> 23:20.700]  Right now, using data, we can do a lot of this stuff.
[23:22.220 --> 23:23.660]  We can isolate different things
[23:23.660 --> 23:26.780]  and we can breed towards different goals using data.
[23:26.780 --> 23:31.100]  Whereas before, for the last forever,
[23:31.100 --> 23:34.580]  we've got a taste and smell effect.
[23:34.580 --> 23:36.060]  And now we can use data points
[23:36.060 --> 23:37.580]  and we can breed towards those things.
[23:37.580 --> 23:40.220]  And I think that's going to change the breeding.
[23:40.220 --> 23:42.500]  I feel like there's a lot of people
[23:42.500 --> 23:44.220]  with passion that are involved.
[23:44.220 --> 23:47.740]  They want to keep the plant an amazing thing
[23:47.740 --> 23:49.380]  that's good quality medicine
[23:49.380 --> 23:51.220]  and they're not trying to hoard the information.
[23:51.220 --> 23:53.700]  So I got a breeding book coming out
[23:53.700 --> 23:55.380]  and that's going to have a lot of the data
[23:55.380 --> 23:57.860]  that should be out next year for those people tuning in
[23:57.860 --> 24:00.820]  that are curious about the book.
[24:00.820 --> 24:02.980]  People actually ask about it all the time.
[24:02.980 --> 24:04.340]  So that's good to give.
[24:04.340 --> 24:06.380]  We'll give them the quarterly update.
[24:07.660 --> 24:08.900]  Yeah, yeah, weekly update.
[24:11.820 --> 24:13.380]  So yeah, and then I think I'm going to have
[24:13.380 --> 24:14.660]  a little bit of the book on
[24:14.660 --> 24:16.980]  in some of the coming up episodes.
[24:16.980 --> 24:19.940]  Each week I want to discuss one of the aspects
[24:19.940 --> 24:21.700]  of the book with the group.
[24:22.660 --> 24:25.500]  So I guess we can kind of lead into that with,
[24:25.500 --> 24:28.180]  the next question is, how do you guys germinate seeds?
[24:28.180 --> 24:29.740]  Let's start with Adam.
[24:29.740 --> 24:32.180]  I feel like he has the most experience.
[24:32.180 --> 24:35.620]  He's been germinating seeds since what,
[24:35.620 --> 24:37.580]  late 80s, early 90s?
[24:37.580 --> 24:42.580]  Yeah, I think that, well, one of the things I realized,
[24:42.620 --> 24:45.140]  one of the things I realized early on was
[24:45.140 --> 24:50.140]  that the main mistakes were human error, right?
[24:50.180 --> 24:53.300]  Like you would put them into a paper towel
[24:53.300 --> 24:55.140]  and then you would cover it with a dish
[24:55.140 --> 24:56.380]  or something like that along those lines
[24:56.380 --> 24:58.620]  or put it into a plastic bag or any,
[24:58.620 --> 25:01.100]  many different ways that people do it to just soak them.
[25:01.100 --> 25:03.380]  But the problem was, is the timing was always fucked.
[25:03.380 --> 25:05.500]  Like if I didn't, if I left them too long,
[25:05.500 --> 25:07.060]  it kind of like would damage them
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.940]  trying to take them off the tissue paper
[25:08.940 --> 25:11.660]  or I buried them the wrong, you know, put them in
[25:11.660 --> 25:13.020]  and they would kind of go the wrong way.
[25:13.020 --> 25:15.740]  So I realized after a while, like, you know,
[25:15.740 --> 25:17.180]  whatever medium you're going to be working in,
[25:17.180 --> 25:18.820]  if you're going to be growing in rockwool, for instance,
[25:18.820 --> 25:20.180]  then you should be sprouting them in rockwool.
[25:20.180 --> 25:21.380]  If you're going to be growing them in soil,
[25:21.380 --> 25:23.500]  you should be sprouting them in soil, in my opinion.
[25:23.500 --> 25:24.660]  If you're growing them in cocoa,
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.300]  you should be starting them in cocoa
[25:26.300 --> 25:29.380]  because then the plant is adjusted right out of the gate.
[25:29.380 --> 25:31.020]  Whereas the minute you try to transfer
[25:31.020 --> 25:33.500]  like a rockwool block into soil,
[25:34.020 --> 25:36.420]  there's that sort of lag period there
[25:36.420 --> 25:39.020]  where they don't quite grab maybe quite as quick
[25:39.020 --> 25:41.020]  as they would if they were going from the same medium
[25:41.020 --> 25:41.860]  to the same medium.
[25:41.860 --> 25:44.660]  So I always, plus if you're buying seeds,
[25:44.660 --> 25:46.420]  it's like, that's when you really want to,
[25:46.420 --> 25:47.820]  like, that's why people put them in the paper towel
[25:47.820 --> 25:49.140]  because they really want to see what happened.
[25:49.140 --> 25:51.140]  Like, they want to know that it sprouted
[25:51.140 --> 25:53.140]  because sometimes at that point,
[25:53.140 --> 25:54.620]  it could be old pack of seeds.
[25:54.620 --> 25:56.220]  You know, you've paid a hundred bucks for them.
[25:56.220 --> 25:59.260]  If none of them even cracked, then you have an issue.
[25:59.260 --> 26:01.180]  And you call James and say, hey, James,
[26:01.220 --> 26:02.060]  why did this seed not pop?
[26:02.060 --> 26:03.420]  But if you're making your own seeds
[26:03.420 --> 26:05.260]  and you have thousands to work with,
[26:05.260 --> 26:06.300]  I feel like it's always better
[26:06.300 --> 26:08.300]  just to go straight into the medium,
[26:08.300 --> 26:10.260]  let it run its course.
[26:10.260 --> 26:12.660]  You can kind of gauge everything a little bit better.
[26:12.660 --> 26:14.500]  It gives you more time to be flexible too
[26:14.500 --> 26:17.660]  because once it's sprouted, you still have, you know,
[26:17.660 --> 26:19.380]  depending on the size of the container
[26:19.380 --> 26:20.220]  that you put them in.
[26:20.220 --> 26:22.780]  And I just put them in as small of containers as I can
[26:22.780 --> 26:26.380]  without them being, you know, ridiculously small, of course.
[26:26.380 --> 26:28.220]  But like, you know,
[26:28.260 --> 26:32.060]  a normal 32 or a 50 tray, something along those lines.
[26:32.060 --> 26:36.020]  And then you can still do your numbers at that point.
[26:36.020 --> 26:38.740]  And you can also, instead of,
[26:38.740 --> 26:40.900]  because also I think the biggest problem people do is
[26:40.900 --> 26:43.700]  they'll put things in that maybe you can see
[26:43.700 --> 26:45.420]  right out of the gate that it's not even worth putting in.
[26:45.420 --> 26:47.380]  You should like, just, you know,
[26:47.380 --> 26:50.900]  eliminate at least the weakest ones out of the gate.
[26:50.900 --> 26:52.820]  But that's just my style.
[26:53.900 --> 26:55.540]  Medium-sized containers,
[26:55.620 --> 26:56.740]  that's just my style.
[26:57.860 --> 26:59.940]  Medium to medium, same medium every time.
[27:01.380 --> 27:03.860]  James, being you have a lot of experience
[27:05.020 --> 27:07.020]  and you want people, you know,
[27:07.020 --> 27:08.660]  you try to set people up for success.
[27:08.660 --> 27:12.660]  What do you recommend as far as germination, you know,
[27:12.660 --> 27:14.860]  coming from your perspective?
[27:14.860 --> 27:16.220]  So my answer is real easy.
[27:16.220 --> 27:18.260]  This is the way this whole game works.
[27:18.260 --> 27:20.420]  You guys can make them and tell people what to do with them,
[27:20.420 --> 27:21.260]  but you can't sell them.
[27:21.260 --> 27:23.460]  I can sell them, I just can't tell you what to do with them.
[27:23.460 --> 27:26.020]  So I sell genetic preservation kits.
[27:26.020 --> 27:27.780]  I suggest that you watch the Adam Dunn show,
[27:27.780 --> 27:30.380]  you watch this podcast, watch Future Cannabis Project,
[27:30.380 --> 27:32.940]  you check out YouTube, check out the forums,
[27:32.940 --> 27:34.220]  email your favorite breeder.
[27:34.220 --> 27:37.460]  But as far as I know, they're genetic preservation kits, so.
[27:38.780 --> 27:39.620]  Okay, perfect.
[27:40.460 --> 27:41.300]  Glad to hear it.
[27:41.300 --> 27:44.020]  And then Marlon, your time in Trinidad,
[27:45.220 --> 27:48.100]  what do you recommend as far as germinating seeds?
[27:48.100 --> 27:49.340]  What's your experience?
[27:49.340 --> 27:51.300]  You want to give us a little bit of background?
[27:51.340 --> 27:54.020]  Well, Trinidad is kind of hot, you know,
[27:54.020 --> 27:59.020]  and we have rain and sun is our two climate, you know?
[27:59.140 --> 28:02.660]  So I wanted to, I remember James had showed me
[28:02.660 --> 28:05.860]  how to store some seed in the refrigerator
[28:05.860 --> 28:08.100]  between some rice, you know?
[28:08.100 --> 28:11.780]  And I realized when I took it out of the refrigerator
[28:11.780 --> 28:15.780]  and, you know, I put it in my little container
[28:15.780 --> 28:20.500]  and I realized the seed germinate a lot faster
[28:20.540 --> 28:23.580]  than if I just set it on some, you know,
[28:23.580 --> 28:26.780]  some tissue and try to germinate it that way.
[28:26.780 --> 28:30.100]  So I realized that probably the coldness
[28:30.100 --> 28:34.380]  of the refrigerator, you know, had it in that stage
[28:34.380 --> 28:37.100]  where as I took it out and it was thawing out,
[28:37.100 --> 28:41.180]  you know, kind of signal the seed to, you know,
[28:41.180 --> 28:44.180]  springtime, let's germinate, you know?
[28:44.180 --> 28:47.260]  So my thing, I've been doing that ever since,
[28:47.260 --> 28:50.180]  you know, and it's been working, you know?
[28:50.860 --> 28:54.060]  So I like to put them in the refrigerator
[28:54.060 --> 28:58.860]  for at least 24 hours and then I take them out
[28:58.860 --> 29:01.420]  and I put them in my little container
[29:01.420 --> 29:05.060]  and I like to germinate in soil too, you know?
[29:06.180 --> 29:08.220]  Cause that's, you know?
[29:09.260 --> 29:10.100]  But that's just me.
[29:10.100 --> 29:13.460]  So as far as how, yeah, no, I think that's great.
[29:13.460 --> 29:15.900]  And so as far as how I germinate seeds,
[29:15.900 --> 29:19.300]  it really depends on the environment.
[29:19.300 --> 29:20.140]  What's up, Peter?
[29:22.260 --> 29:24.900]  Okay, so as far as how I germinate seeds,
[29:24.900 --> 29:26.460]  it really depends on the environment
[29:26.460 --> 29:28.380]  and how many seeds I'm germinating.
[29:28.380 --> 29:29.820]  If you're doing it at scale,
[29:29.820 --> 29:33.260]  where you're doing 10,000 seeds or 20,000 seeds,
[29:33.260 --> 29:35.060]  I've done it by hand and it's a nightmare.
[29:35.060 --> 29:37.300]  I think the best option for that is a needle seeder
[29:37.300 --> 29:39.380]  going into whatever medium, like Adam said,
[29:39.380 --> 29:40.940]  whatever medium you're growing in,
[29:40.940 --> 29:42.420]  you should be germinating in.
[29:42.420 --> 29:45.220]  But I typically like to do a seed soak
[29:45.220 --> 29:48.620]  with hydrogen peroxide, which is like a five to one,
[29:49.540 --> 29:54.540]  like a water with H2O2, which is hydrogen peroxide.
[29:54.580 --> 29:57.420]  And then, so that'd be five parts water,
[29:57.420 --> 29:59.700]  one part hydrogen peroxide.
[29:59.700 --> 30:01.540]  You can do a bleach soak
[30:01.540 --> 30:04.140]  that I think would be like a 5% solution.
[30:04.140 --> 30:07.900]  And what that does is it sterilizes the surface of the seed.
[30:07.900 --> 30:09.140]  And then after that,
[30:09.140 --> 30:12.740]  you can put them in the medium that you're gonna use.
[30:12.740 --> 30:15.500]  Or what I've really been experimenting with this year
[30:15.500 --> 30:17.060]  outdoors is direct sow.
[30:17.100 --> 30:19.980]  And direct sow is where you plant directly in the field.
[30:19.980 --> 30:22.660]  I think there's huge benefits to it
[30:22.660 --> 30:24.420]  because you're skipping steps.
[30:24.420 --> 30:28.820]  So your labor costs are gonna be less, especially at scale.
[30:28.820 --> 30:30.780]  You're doing less damage to the plant
[30:30.780 --> 30:33.620]  if you're in a environment that's conducive
[30:33.620 --> 30:35.500]  to direct sowing.
[30:35.500 --> 30:37.700]  And especially with something like auto flowers
[30:37.700 --> 30:41.060]  that I've been working with for the last couple of years,
[30:41.060 --> 30:43.140]  auto flowers, really, the more you move them,
[30:43.140 --> 30:45.100]  the less damage you can do to them.
[30:45.140 --> 30:47.860]  And if you have a chance of them getting root bound,
[30:47.860 --> 30:49.020]  you'll really screw them up.
[30:49.020 --> 30:51.860]  You'll screw up your harvest and your yields,
[30:51.860 --> 30:54.820]  especially they become root bound easily
[30:54.820 --> 30:57.180]  because they have so much vigorous growth,
[30:57.180 --> 30:58.940]  especially in the early stages.
[30:59.940 --> 31:03.820]  So that's my two cents on germinating seeds.
[31:03.820 --> 31:05.860]  My book is gonna actually have each step.
[31:05.860 --> 31:06.980]  There's so many different steps
[31:06.980 --> 31:08.100]  and so many different methods.
[31:08.100 --> 31:10.300]  And all of the methods are included
[31:10.300 --> 31:11.700]  in the germination chapter.
[31:12.260 --> 31:13.100]  So-
[31:13.100 --> 31:16.300]  So actually James, just quickly.
[31:16.300 --> 31:17.140]  That's okay.
[31:17.140 --> 31:20.540]  Can I just jump in from the peanut gallery
[31:20.540 --> 31:23.500]  in the YouTube chat?
[31:23.500 --> 31:26.220]  And as you said, there are many different ways to do it.
[31:26.220 --> 31:27.060]  Huncho Grown said,
[31:27.060 --> 31:29.340]  you are literally killing the microbes on the seed
[31:29.340 --> 31:32.060]  that help it grow, do not use bleach or peroxide.
[31:32.060 --> 31:34.100]  So can you guys talk about kind of the balance
[31:34.100 --> 31:38.060]  between what the peroxide does and the microbes?
[31:39.060 --> 31:42.700]  So, we could get him to talk about it, I guess.
[31:42.700 --> 31:45.220]  But as far as my feeling on that is,
[31:45.220 --> 31:47.980]  is that I get a higher germination rate
[31:47.980 --> 31:49.260]  with the hydrogen peroxide.
[31:49.260 --> 31:52.620]  Now, everybody has their own way of doing it,
[31:52.620 --> 31:54.380]  but I've seen my germination rates
[31:54.380 --> 31:57.460]  are like 99 to 100% at scale.
[31:59.340 --> 32:01.180]  And there's some people that soak,
[32:01.180 --> 32:02.460]  there's some people that don't soak,
[32:02.460 --> 32:04.020]  we can get good results.
[32:04.020 --> 32:05.700]  That's just my two cents on it.
[32:05.740 --> 32:07.140]  I think there's a company out of Arizona
[32:07.140 --> 32:08.540]  that works with Arizona State
[32:08.540 --> 32:11.300]  that's actually encasing their seeds
[32:11.300 --> 32:14.860]  in beneficial bacteria and other things.
[32:14.860 --> 32:18.460]  And they're selling their seeds for a high dollar price
[32:18.460 --> 32:22.900]  because it increases the germination rate and growth.
[32:22.900 --> 32:25.980]  But I found that sterilizing my seeds is beneficial.
[32:25.980 --> 32:30.980]  So if Huncho wants to put any data up
[32:31.260 --> 32:32.860]  and talk about how to do it,
[32:32.900 --> 32:36.420]  if he wants to put any data up and send some links,
[32:36.420 --> 32:39.780]  I'd love to see him and take him into consideration
[32:39.780 --> 32:43.700]  for my book because we're at the very tail end of my book.
[32:43.700 --> 32:46.300]  So if he has some good info, I'd love to include it.
[32:47.140 --> 32:47.980]  Yes.
[32:47.980 --> 32:50.340]  And I think this is just exactly why
[32:50.340 --> 32:51.820]  we don't speak to germination techniques
[32:51.820 --> 32:53.100]  because there's so many different ways
[32:53.100 --> 32:54.540]  and my way is not the right way
[32:54.540 --> 32:55.700]  and your way is not the wrong way.
[32:55.700 --> 32:58.300]  And so if you tried something with your souvenirs,
[32:58.300 --> 33:00.820]  then who am I to say that that's not the right way
[33:00.820 --> 33:02.620]  and give you different direction.
[33:03.380 --> 33:05.740]  So it's definitely kind of like growing.
[33:05.740 --> 33:08.380]  Like you find what works for you and that's the way.
[33:09.500 --> 33:10.340]  Right.
[33:10.340 --> 33:11.740]  And in the chat, they're also-
[33:11.740 --> 33:12.860]  I think it also depends on-
[33:12.860 --> 33:14.220]  Confirming what you're saying, James.
[33:14.220 --> 33:17.540]  Like Strong Style Organics says,
[33:17.540 --> 33:20.420]  we soak microgreen seeds in hydrogen peroxide.
[33:20.420 --> 33:21.540]  It's fine.
[33:21.540 --> 33:24.140]  Super Spooker said the seeds contain the enzymes
[33:24.140 --> 33:26.660]  within Strong Style Organics said
[33:26.660 --> 33:28.740]  it protects against mold too.
[33:28.740 --> 33:31.340]  And then Huncho Grone in terms of his own method said
[33:31.340 --> 33:34.460]  he uses pure water or aloe vera as a rooting agent.
[33:36.780 --> 33:37.740]  Interesting.
[33:37.740 --> 33:41.060]  Yeah, I think it prevents against dampening off as well
[33:41.060 --> 33:44.540]  but dampening off can be created by overwatering.
[33:44.540 --> 33:49.540]  And so, yeah, I mean, I think there's no one right way
[33:50.260 --> 33:51.380]  to do it for sure.
[33:51.380 --> 33:53.180]  That's a hundred percent true.
[33:53.180 --> 33:58.180]  And, you know, at scale, if you talk to large companies-
[33:58.180 --> 33:59.020]  James.
[34:00.740 --> 34:02.380]  What's that, Adam?
[34:02.380 --> 34:04.100]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I think it also goes back to the-
[34:04.100 --> 34:05.460]  Well, I was gonna say, I think it also goes back
[34:05.460 --> 34:07.060]  to the medium question too, right?
[34:07.060 --> 34:08.540]  If you're growing on rock wool,
[34:08.540 --> 34:10.580]  then you want a sterility, you know what I mean?
[34:10.580 --> 34:11.900]  You're starting with a sterile product
[34:11.900 --> 34:14.420]  so it would benefit itself.
[34:14.420 --> 34:16.020]  And if you're gonna grow completely organic,
[34:16.020 --> 34:18.180]  I would imagine, you know, you just want the plant
[34:18.180 --> 34:22.060]  to work with its own microbes from the beginning
[34:22.060 --> 34:25.900]  because that is, you know, you don't wanna start the plant
[34:25.900 --> 34:27.340]  from the froth again, you know?
[34:27.500 --> 34:30.180]  You wanna give it a chance to start naturally,
[34:30.180 --> 34:31.060]  which makes sense.
[34:31.060 --> 34:35.140]  So again, it is a thousand ways to skin a cat, right?
[34:35.140 --> 34:36.660]  Come on, we can-
[34:39.220 --> 34:40.820]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great question.
[34:40.820 --> 34:42.660]  And, you know, I love the debate about it
[34:42.660 --> 34:45.300]  because hearing all these different opinions,
[34:45.300 --> 34:47.100]  it's like, I'm trying to include a lot of this stuff
[34:47.100 --> 34:49.660]  in my book that's not just, you know,
[34:49.660 --> 34:51.500]  cause I'm very specific on what I do,
[34:51.500 --> 34:53.700]  but I feel like it's important to share the way
[34:53.700 --> 34:55.340]  that some of my friends do this stuff.
[34:55.380 --> 34:58.300]  And, you know, it's also, there's a couple of things
[34:58.300 --> 35:01.140]  on what not to do when germinating seeds.
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.780]  I think, you know, there's just so many
[35:03.780 --> 35:05.420]  different approaches to it.
[35:05.420 --> 35:08.540]  But now, the next thing I wanna talk about
[35:08.540 --> 35:11.140]  is the big clone versus seed debate.
[35:11.140 --> 35:14.820]  And someone, I think on one of the shows I did with Peter
[35:14.820 --> 35:16.940]  was like, well, why should I buy your seeds
[35:16.940 --> 35:18.260]  when clones seem to be better?
[35:18.260 --> 35:20.420]  And I agree.
[35:20.420 --> 35:24.900]  Clones, in my opinion, are a preferred method
[35:24.900 --> 35:27.900]  as far as genetic phenotype.
[35:27.900 --> 35:30.660]  Now, if we get into the fact that, you know,
[35:30.660 --> 35:32.620]  we're talking about, you want a pheno hunt
[35:32.620 --> 35:33.740]  and you're doing different stuff,
[35:33.740 --> 35:35.180]  it all comes down to goals.
[35:36.380 --> 35:38.460]  Do you wanna touch on that first, Adam?
[35:42.060 --> 35:42.900]  Sure.
[35:42.900 --> 35:46.700]  Well, I mean, cloning of course is important
[35:46.700 --> 35:49.700]  and it's something everybody as a grower needs to learn
[35:49.700 --> 35:50.980]  how to do and be comfortable with
[35:50.980 --> 35:53.500]  because of preservation, right?
[35:53.500 --> 35:56.180]  But it also can be a nightmare
[35:56.860 --> 35:58.420]  because, I mean, people wanna hang on to stuff
[35:58.420 --> 36:00.660]  because it's elite genetics
[36:00.660 --> 36:03.460]  or they paid money for it, whatever reason.
[36:03.460 --> 36:06.100]  And a lot of times they're just creating their own problems
[36:06.100 --> 36:08.420]  because of, I mean, how many plants now
[36:09.340 --> 36:11.660]  have hop-latent viroid, you know?
[36:11.660 --> 36:14.060]  I mean, there's so many strains out there
[36:14.060 --> 36:16.100]  that have been around for 20 plus years
[36:16.100 --> 36:18.060]  and the chances of them surviving 20 years
[36:18.060 --> 36:20.460]  without picking up some sort of virus along the way
[36:20.460 --> 36:22.980]  and infecting your garden is almost, you know,
[36:22.980 --> 36:23.980]  especially here in Colorado,
[36:23.980 --> 36:27.300]  there's like, you know, massive die off of strains here
[36:27.300 --> 36:30.420]  because people just have been overcrowding places
[36:30.420 --> 36:33.260]  and just not understanding that they've got an infected plant
[36:33.260 --> 36:35.060]  in their midst, you know?
[36:35.060 --> 36:38.900]  So I feel like as a production thing,
[36:38.900 --> 36:41.660]  yes, of course you need to clone your own moms
[36:41.660 --> 36:42.500]  and do your own thing,
[36:42.500 --> 36:46.100]  but when it comes to like starting your new garden,
[36:46.100 --> 36:47.500]  it's a terrible idea.
[36:47.500 --> 36:49.740]  I think anybody who's starting a fresh garden
[36:49.740 --> 36:52.100]  should never start with clones
[36:52.100 --> 36:54.140]  unless it's their own clones
[36:54.140 --> 36:56.020]  that they've been carrying from their last garden,
[36:56.020 --> 36:59.220]  let's say, but never like,
[36:59.220 --> 37:01.980]  hey, I want to start with that, I believe.
[37:01.980 --> 37:05.300]  And the other difference is when you grow from clone,
[37:05.300 --> 37:07.140]  say we're all growing the same strain,
[37:07.140 --> 37:09.860]  well, there's only gonna be variable differences
[37:09.860 --> 37:11.860]  between our plants because of the fact
[37:11.860 --> 37:13.060]  that we grow different.
[37:13.060 --> 37:14.980]  But when you grow from seed,
[37:14.980 --> 37:16.260]  the world is your oyster, right?
[37:16.260 --> 37:17.100]  You never know.
[37:17.100 --> 37:20.100]  Yeah, you could just be popping that amazing new plant.
[37:20.700 --> 37:25.700]  So I feel like clone is only...
[37:26.020 --> 37:26.860]  Wait around.
[37:32.060 --> 37:32.980]  That was my rant.
[37:34.220 --> 37:35.420]  Yeah, that was my rant.
[37:36.460 --> 37:38.660]  So for me, it's an open and shut case.
[37:38.660 --> 37:39.980]  I mean, it's taproot.
[37:40.860 --> 37:44.780]  I mean, it's taproot and uniquely yours.
[37:44.780 --> 37:46.740]  So, and you're only gonna get that from a seed.
[37:46.740 --> 37:47.700]  I mean, you're not gonna get,
[37:47.700 --> 37:48.940]  you're gonna get from a clone,
[37:48.940 --> 37:50.580]  you're gonna get the branch of a branch of a branch,
[37:50.620 --> 37:51.700]  which is gonna give you the shallowest,
[37:51.700 --> 37:53.020]  fibrous root system.
[37:53.020 --> 37:54.700]  But with a seed, you're gonna get taproot,
[37:54.700 --> 37:56.100]  you're gonna go all the way down.
[37:56.100 --> 37:56.940]  You're also gonna get something
[37:56.940 --> 37:58.980]  that's uniquely yours to you.
[37:58.980 --> 38:00.460]  Everybody can copy your business model,
[38:00.460 --> 38:02.580]  they can copy your advertising, copy everything,
[38:02.580 --> 38:04.980]  but they can't copy the strains on your shelf.
[38:04.980 --> 38:06.500]  And you won't have what I have
[38:06.500 --> 38:09.100]  unless I give it to you, unless you steal it.
[38:09.100 --> 38:10.900]  And so that's what's gonna keep people coming in
[38:10.900 --> 38:12.420]  is the flower on your shelf.
[38:12.420 --> 38:14.140]  And the only way you're gonna get something unique
[38:14.140 --> 38:15.540]  is to pop it from seed.
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.180]  Clones are fun, you bring them home from the store,
[38:17.180 --> 38:18.820]  you throw them in the,
[38:18.820 --> 38:20.460]  throw them hopefully in quarantine somewhere,
[38:20.780 --> 38:21.620]  put some dirt on it,
[38:21.620 --> 38:23.860]  and hey, I planted something.
[38:25.060 --> 38:26.420]  It could be fun for you, but a seed,
[38:26.420 --> 38:28.860]  watching that germinate and go through the stages
[38:28.860 --> 38:30.780]  and cropping it up at one point in time,
[38:30.780 --> 38:31.620]  you don't know if you need to,
[38:31.620 --> 38:33.100]  and that's the one that wins.
[38:33.100 --> 38:36.380]  It's a much better experience, I would think.
[38:37.300 --> 38:40.140]  But it's, I mean, I think if you do your own clones,
[38:40.140 --> 38:43.060]  like if you have clones from a plant that you started,
[38:43.060 --> 38:45.140]  I think that's, of course,
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.820]  you find something you like, you keep it,
[38:46.820 --> 38:49.860]  you make that your house plant,
[38:50.300 --> 38:51.900]  and you've got tons of clones of it.
[38:51.900 --> 38:54.740]  But if you buy a clone from a store,
[38:54.740 --> 38:56.580]  how many other people have that same cut?
[38:56.580 --> 38:57.420]  100?
[38:57.420 --> 38:58.740]  And so when it's time to market that,
[38:58.740 --> 38:59.980]  now the market's flooded,
[38:59.980 --> 39:02.700]  and you have to beat 100 other people at growing it.
[39:02.700 --> 39:04.700]  So start from seed.
[39:04.700 --> 39:05.540]  Exactly.
[39:06.980 --> 39:10.260]  So Marlon, if you wanted to kind of talk about
[39:10.260 --> 39:13.380]  the Caribbean and clones versus seeds,
[39:15.020 --> 39:18.260]  how is the clone versus seed debate going down there?
[39:18.300 --> 39:22.220]  Do people prefer clones or they prefer mostly seeds?
[39:22.220 --> 39:25.060]  Well, a lot of the farmers in the Caribbean
[39:25.060 --> 39:29.300]  and Trinidad too are traditional farmers, you know?
[39:29.300 --> 39:32.700]  And of course they know how to clone, they make clones,
[39:32.700 --> 39:37.700]  but they are more based on storing their seed
[39:39.420 --> 39:40.500]  for their genetics.
[39:40.500 --> 39:44.580]  So every time they pop a seed, it's the strain they want,
[39:44.580 --> 39:46.820]  but with a different flair, you know?
[39:46.860 --> 39:47.900]  They may have a little more
[39:47.900 --> 39:49.380]  or something a little differently.
[39:49.380 --> 39:54.380]  So it's all about, it's survival in the Caribbean
[39:54.740 --> 39:57.780]  because you have something that is lucrative
[39:57.780 --> 40:02.020]  and could be a good product on the market.
[40:02.020 --> 40:05.740]  So a lot of them, for me, clone is,
[40:07.260 --> 40:11.140]  you know, it's just an insight
[40:11.140 --> 40:14.420]  on what you could get with seeds, you know?
[40:15.380 --> 40:18.620]  Because the clones are, you can't get a clone
[40:18.620 --> 40:20.060]  if you didn't have a seed before.
[40:20.060 --> 40:22.340]  So it's just showing you that, you know,
[40:22.340 --> 40:26.100]  this is what could come out of having your own seed,
[40:26.100 --> 40:26.940]  you know?
[40:26.940 --> 40:28.420]  You could have your seed, your own plant,
[40:28.420 --> 40:30.540]  and then you can make clones out of it.
[40:30.540 --> 40:35.540]  So, you know, for me, I rather the seeds all day.
[40:36.140 --> 40:38.140]  That's why we ganja farm a seed company.
[40:40.700 --> 40:43.940]  I think as far as it goes with seeds versus clones,
[40:44.460 --> 40:47.460]  I think in, you know, you have to look at the situation.
[40:47.460 --> 40:49.860]  If you want to grow OG Kush and you're a home grower
[40:49.860 --> 40:52.740]  and you have access to good clones of OG Kush,
[40:52.740 --> 40:54.180]  there's nothing wrong with getting those.
[40:54.180 --> 40:56.820]  Because if you want to, you're very specific
[40:56.820 --> 40:59.540]  about the type of OG Kush you want to be,
[40:59.540 --> 41:00.380]  you're only going to get that from-
[41:00.380 --> 41:01.220]  What's the chance you're going to get
[41:01.220 --> 41:02.260]  the real OG Kush though?
[41:02.260 --> 41:04.740]  What's the chance that that guy's got the real OG Kush?
[41:05.620 --> 41:07.500]  I feel like in California,
[41:07.500 --> 41:09.500]  the clones available in the market,
[41:09.500 --> 41:11.780]  there's good OG Kush clones available.
[41:11.780 --> 41:13.700]  And if you know somebody that has it, even better,
[41:14.460 --> 41:15.860]  I feel like it's out there.
[41:15.860 --> 41:16.780]  Those things are out there.
[41:16.780 --> 41:18.300]  If you want the Gushers,
[41:18.300 --> 41:20.340]  there's companies like Finest.
[41:20.340 --> 41:22.180]  They have some amazing genetics
[41:22.180 --> 41:24.420]  that are tissue cultured clones.
[41:25.660 --> 41:27.820]  And they've had their share of problems over the years,
[41:27.820 --> 41:30.020]  but they sell amazing quality genetics.
[41:30.020 --> 41:32.380]  And there's a ton of nurseries
[41:32.380 --> 41:34.460]  that are selling good genetics in California.
[41:34.460 --> 41:36.500]  But again, that's the argument.
[41:36.500 --> 41:37.660]  Like if you want to go from clone
[41:37.660 --> 41:40.140]  because you're looking for that one specific thing
[41:40.140 --> 41:43.300]  or you don't want a lot of phenotypical variation,
[41:43.940 --> 41:45.420]  if you're growing a hundred plants
[41:45.420 --> 41:47.180]  and you're trying to monocrop it
[41:47.180 --> 41:48.660]  because you're doing it for cash, I get it.
[41:48.660 --> 41:50.100]  You want a clone.
[41:50.100 --> 41:52.340]  If you want a pheno hunt and find something special,
[41:52.340 --> 41:54.180]  you're looking for that unicorn,
[41:54.180 --> 41:57.540]  you might find that next winner.
[41:57.540 --> 41:58.980]  That's totally possible.
[42:00.540 --> 42:03.820]  I think that as far as for ag,
[42:03.820 --> 42:06.980]  there's seeds is the solution at scale.
[42:06.980 --> 42:09.380]  Hands down, as far as growing seeds,
[42:09.380 --> 42:12.100]  if you're going to plant five acres right now,
[42:12.100 --> 42:13.220]  seeds is the way to go.
[42:14.140 --> 42:16.740]  It's more efficient.
[42:18.580 --> 42:21.940]  As far as if you're talking about phenotypical variation,
[42:21.940 --> 42:24.260]  a lot of fields are planted for biomass,
[42:24.260 --> 42:26.620]  but even the ones that aren't planted for biomass,
[42:26.620 --> 42:29.580]  seeds are so much more vigorous that you get better yields.
[42:31.020 --> 42:34.980]  I feel like you can discuss both sides and argue both sides.
[42:34.980 --> 42:37.660]  But what's that?
[42:38.660 --> 42:41.820]  I think one of the main things people got to realize
[42:41.820 --> 42:45.300]  is all agriculture is monocultured, right?
[42:45.300 --> 42:46.700]  And most of it is.
[42:46.700 --> 42:47.980]  And those are the ones that are failing.
[42:47.980 --> 42:49.700]  Those are the ones that are going to fail in the future
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.380]  because of it, you know what I mean?
[42:51.380 --> 42:54.100]  Because the whole thing is diversity in all gardens.
[42:54.100 --> 42:56.540]  It doesn't matter whether it's a vegetable garden
[42:56.540 --> 42:58.180]  or a cannabis garden.
[42:58.180 --> 43:01.140]  You want diversity because if you get hit with something
[43:01.140 --> 43:03.300]  and you have one strain in your room
[43:03.300 --> 43:05.820]  and that strain is susceptible to that,
[43:05.820 --> 43:07.180]  then you can lose your entire crop.
[43:07.700 --> 43:10.420]  And it happens to everybody at once along the line, right?
[43:10.420 --> 43:11.660]  And then they realize like,
[43:11.660 --> 43:15.220]  shit, I need a powdery mildew resistant plant
[43:15.220 --> 43:16.500]  because I got hit with powdery mildew
[43:16.500 --> 43:17.740]  and every single plant in my room
[43:17.740 --> 43:19.300]  had got powdery mildew, right?
[43:19.300 --> 43:21.700]  But if you had a seed crop, you'd be like,
[43:21.700 --> 43:24.900]  well, for some reason, those three plants over there
[43:24.900 --> 43:26.500]  have zero powdery mildew on them.
[43:26.500 --> 43:28.260]  And maybe those three plants are the ones
[43:28.260 --> 43:30.140]  that keep you in business, you know what I mean?
[43:30.140 --> 43:33.140]  So I feel like people got to realize the risk they take
[43:33.140 --> 43:34.180]  when they grow with cologne.
[43:34.180 --> 43:36.260]  It's a higher risk along the way.
[43:36.260 --> 43:38.340]  And I've never seen a plant get better by cloning.
[43:38.340 --> 43:39.700]  I've only seen plants get worse.
[43:39.700 --> 43:42.940]  So I don't know if you want to go in that direction or not.
[43:42.940 --> 43:44.340]  Well, I think that's the whole point of breeding
[43:44.340 --> 43:46.820]  is to improve the existing strain.
[43:46.820 --> 43:48.900]  And by cloning, of course, you're not gonna,
[43:48.900 --> 43:51.060]  you're cloning, so you're not gonna improve the strain.
[43:51.060 --> 43:53.300]  To where I've been at like some of my breeders booths
[43:53.300 --> 43:54.500]  and people will bring them back strains.
[43:54.500 --> 43:56.300]  They're like, man, this is far out.
[43:56.300 --> 43:58.020]  I'm looking at this, looking at what it grew, you know?
[43:58.020 --> 43:59.300]  And it was better than what the breeder had
[43:59.300 --> 44:01.460]  because he had improved the strain.
[44:01.460 --> 44:03.260]  And so I think that that's a, you know,
[44:03.260 --> 44:04.900]  that's a shout out to the breeder.
[44:05.780 --> 44:08.500]  Yeah, and I'd like to just touch on that.
[44:08.500 --> 44:11.140]  That I think a lot of these seed breeders,
[44:11.140 --> 44:13.100]  you know, whether you're talking about,
[44:14.380 --> 44:17.220]  I can name any group of seed breeders
[44:17.220 --> 44:18.380]  that you sell on your site.
[44:18.380 --> 44:21.500]  I think a lot of times the ones
[44:21.500 --> 44:24.100]  that have the real fucking quality genetics out of them
[44:24.100 --> 44:26.620]  are actually the people that buy the seeds and pheno hunt them.
[44:26.620 --> 44:28.100]  You know, there's some of the guys
[44:28.100 --> 44:29.700]  that do their own pheno hunting,
[44:29.700 --> 44:31.300]  but I think that's the most important part.
[44:31.300 --> 44:33.260]  And we can kind of lead into the next step on that
[44:33.260 --> 44:37.860]  is pheno hunting is more important than breeding.
[44:37.860 --> 44:40.500]  And I think a lot of breeders are confused on that.
[44:40.500 --> 44:42.540]  Not all of them, but you know,
[44:42.540 --> 44:44.620]  I think the pheno hunting is the part
[44:44.620 --> 44:47.300]  where the actual breeding work is done.
[44:47.300 --> 44:49.820]  Anybody can take pollen and make a seed,
[44:49.820 --> 44:51.540]  but it takes a good pheno hunter,
[44:51.540 --> 44:53.660]  someone who knows what they're looking at
[44:53.660 --> 44:57.540]  to actually make quality genetics and do good selections
[44:57.540 --> 44:59.980]  so that they keep on improving on the genetics.
[45:00.460 --> 45:03.260]  You know, I think Adam is one of the guys,
[45:03.260 --> 45:05.860]  he's done a lot of breeding over the years
[45:05.860 --> 45:07.220]  and had some good stuff.
[45:08.180 --> 45:09.740]  What's your take on that, Adam?
[45:11.860 --> 45:15.780]  Yeah, it's, you know, I think over the years,
[45:15.780 --> 45:18.100]  like when I was in Amsterdam starting,
[45:18.100 --> 45:20.220]  the one thing we had, the one advantage we had
[45:20.220 --> 45:21.820]  was that we could grow,
[45:21.820 --> 45:23.940]  and it wasn't even comparable to nowadays,
[45:23.940 --> 45:25.420]  but we could grow some numbers, right?
[45:25.420 --> 45:27.180]  Like, so we could grow a hundred of these
[45:27.180 --> 45:28.940]  or a couple hundred of those.
[45:28.940 --> 45:31.820]  I mean, nowadays you can finally put down 10,000 seeds
[45:31.820 --> 45:34.380]  and do some proper, you know, proper line work
[45:34.380 --> 45:35.740]  and really do some proper breeding.
[45:35.740 --> 45:38.420]  But in general, it's all about the numbers, right?
[45:38.420 --> 45:41.300]  And then when you're doing, so as a breeder,
[45:41.300 --> 45:44.180]  once you've done the first round,
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.060]  you've got, that's only the beginning of the work, right?
[45:46.060 --> 45:48.060]  You have to go through so many rounds
[45:49.780 --> 45:51.580]  to get to whittle it down.
[45:51.580 --> 45:54.180]  And I think for the, it's a lot,
[45:54.180 --> 45:57.780]  what I've always enjoyed is seeing different growers
[45:57.820 --> 46:01.620]  with different abilities, take your seeds,
[46:01.620 --> 46:02.940]  do the selections themselves,
[46:02.940 --> 46:05.380]  come back with what they believe is, you know,
[46:05.380 --> 46:06.460]  the right ones.
[46:06.460 --> 46:08.740]  And it's, again, it's all down
[46:08.740 --> 46:10.500]  to their personalities too sometimes.
[46:10.500 --> 46:12.700]  So you're like, well, I don't know this one, you know,
[46:12.700 --> 46:15.300]  occasionally you'll get things nailing it for you,
[46:15.300 --> 46:17.300]  but really it's just the number game.
[46:17.300 --> 46:21.140]  And so the idea of having more people
[46:21.140 --> 46:24.980]  phenohunt for you is always advantageous to a breeder
[46:24.980 --> 46:27.180]  because you can get lost in the sauce
[46:27.580 --> 46:28.420]  if you're trying to do it yourself
[46:28.420 --> 46:31.580]  and you're trying to do a phenoselection
[46:31.580 --> 46:33.660]  at the same time as you're doing your breeding,
[46:33.660 --> 46:36.940]  because, you know, they're totally different.
[46:36.940 --> 46:38.220]  They're two different things.
[46:38.220 --> 46:41.100]  And the phenohunt, I believe, well, that's the fun part.
[46:41.100 --> 46:43.260]  And that's the part we don't get enough of as a breeder,
[46:43.260 --> 46:44.100]  most of the time.
[46:44.100 --> 46:46.820]  So usually the growers are lucky in that department
[46:46.820 --> 46:48.260]  where they get to do the,
[46:48.260 --> 46:50.300]  they get to see the benefits that came out
[46:50.300 --> 46:51.740]  of those crosses, but.
[46:54.210 --> 46:56.410]  James, do you want to add anything to that?
[46:57.330 --> 46:58.170]  Next.
[47:02.040 --> 47:02.880]  He's muted.
[47:02.880 --> 47:03.800]  Hold on, James.
[47:05.280 --> 47:06.680]  Sorry.
[47:06.680 --> 47:07.760]  There you go.
[47:07.760 --> 47:08.600]  All right.
[47:08.600 --> 47:09.440]  Sorry about that.
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.000]  I was going to say, so shout out to the old breeders,
[47:11.000 --> 47:12.520]  that the guys who are at, you know, like I said,
[47:12.520 --> 47:14.440]  we walk on the shores of giants.
[47:14.440 --> 47:16.520]  We wouldn't be here if the guys back in the day
[47:16.520 --> 47:18.240]  wouldn't have taken the risk that they did.
[47:18.240 --> 47:21.720]  That being said, the risk that they did were like a tent,
[47:21.720 --> 47:24.320]  two tents, a garage, a basement.
[47:24.320 --> 47:25.160]  You know what I mean?
[47:25.600 --> 47:28.640]  You know, like female hens of maybe 50, 100,
[47:28.640 --> 47:30.760]  maybe if we're lucky, maybe 200,
[47:30.760 --> 47:32.280]  because that's the space that they had.
[47:32.280 --> 47:33.320]  And they did great with it.
[47:33.320 --> 47:34.360]  But now when you're talking to people
[47:34.360 --> 47:37.280]  and making runs of 10,000, 5,000,
[47:37.280 --> 47:39.720]  like it's no more Wi-Fi number 44,
[47:39.720 --> 47:42.880]  it's Wi-Fi number 4,451.
[47:42.880 --> 47:44.400]  And that's a bad bitch.
[47:44.400 --> 47:46.120]  And so those numbers just,
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.080]  just the ability to run those numbers,
[47:49.080 --> 47:50.440]  whoever can do that, it's going to be a hit.
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.360]  Because I've heard it said by some of my breeders,
[47:54.360 --> 47:56.960]  in a cross, whatever you're looking for is there.
[47:56.960 --> 47:57.800]  You just have to find it.
[47:57.800 --> 47:59.680]  But it's going to be in that mix.
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.160]  And so you don't have to keep continuing the line
[48:01.160 --> 48:03.720]  or you don't have to keep messing with shit sometimes.
[48:03.720 --> 48:05.280]  If you need this one to just be a little different,
[48:05.280 --> 48:06.120]  you just have to keep feeding on it
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.920]  and you'll find what you're looking for.
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.280]  Don't give up on the first 10 or 20 or something
[48:10.280 --> 48:11.760]  just because it's not there for you.
[48:11.760 --> 48:13.320]  But that being said,
[48:13.320 --> 48:15.040]  I know a lot of the breeders have worked it in.
[48:15.040 --> 48:17.520]  And so the lines are becoming more stable
[48:17.520 --> 48:21.120]  and there's less of the,
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.680]  at least there's less unstable genetics in the market,
[48:25.680 --> 48:28.440]  I think, than there had been.
[48:28.440 --> 48:31.640]  But I guess I'd have to retract that.
[48:31.640 --> 48:32.480]  That's why I said it.
[48:32.480 --> 48:33.320]  Because I don't know.
[48:33.320 --> 48:35.240]  I think there's also a lot of unstable genetics
[48:35.240 --> 48:36.080]  in the market now.
[48:36.080 --> 48:38.000]  But the guys who've been doing it for a while,
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.440]  that's where you want to stick with.
[48:40.440 --> 48:42.840]  Because we're all talking about germinating and clones
[48:42.840 --> 48:43.880]  and all that shit too.
[48:43.880 --> 48:46.000]  We also want to make sure that when we're germinating
[48:46.000 --> 48:46.840]  or if we're germinating,
[48:46.840 --> 48:48.840]  because the preservation kits,
[48:48.840 --> 48:52.640]  but that you're using good stock to start with.
[48:52.640 --> 48:54.560]  Like don't save a nickel or a dime here
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.000]  because it's definitely cost you a thousand
[48:56.000 --> 48:56.840]  to an Indian.
[48:58.200 --> 49:00.600]  Know the gear that you're using
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.240]  and know that it's certified or that it's coming from a guy
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.520]  and that that's what you want to look with.
[49:06.520 --> 49:09.760]  There's a lot of guys who are just throwing shit together
[49:09.760 --> 49:12.440]  because it's a cool name and they haven't feel on it,
[49:12.440 --> 49:14.400]  they haven't ran it through, they haven't tested it
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.880]  and they're selling it and it's a good price.
[49:16.880 --> 49:18.720]  But that doesn't mean I want to devote three months
[49:19.600 --> 49:21.440]  to testing it and have it come out on the fifth week.
[49:21.440 --> 49:23.360]  That's going to ruin my fucking summer.
[49:23.360 --> 49:24.200]  You know?
[49:24.200 --> 49:26.760]  And so it's best to buy stable stuff.
[49:27.840 --> 49:29.680]  I think there's an exception to that though,
[49:29.680 --> 49:34.680]  that it deserves bringing up is Canerado
[49:34.720 --> 49:37.840]  and what Canerado has done kind of for the industry.
[49:37.840 --> 49:40.680]  He's copied the European business model
[49:40.680 --> 49:43.720]  where he's taking feminized seeds
[49:43.720 --> 49:46.880]  and he's taking a really good parent
[49:46.880 --> 49:48.920]  and he's working with really elite genetics.
[49:48.920 --> 49:51.680]  He's not always testing his stuff before he releases them
[49:51.680 --> 49:53.760]  but he's using amazing quality stuff.
[49:53.760 --> 49:56.360]  You know, it's very different from my business model.
[49:56.360 --> 49:57.720]  He's very successful with it
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.360]  and he has access to some of the most elite genetics
[50:00.360 --> 50:03.360]  and that's why his business model works really well for him.
[50:04.360 --> 50:06.360]  What's your opinion on that, James?
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.080]  So I can't speak to breeders and whether they test or not.
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.440]  I have, most of my guys always test their stuff.
[50:15.440 --> 50:17.360]  Like I said, usually when I get a seed drop
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.200]  I'll get a jar with it
[50:18.200 --> 50:20.400]  and that usually lets me know the breeders ran it through,
[50:20.400 --> 50:23.320]  he's tested it and his gear is ready to release.
[50:23.320 --> 50:25.720]  So I can't speak to the guy's breeding tactics
[50:25.720 --> 50:26.920]  or what he does or does not test.
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.040]  I know I've seen pictures in Canerado's gear
[50:29.040 --> 50:30.480]  from a return standpoint
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.160]  or from a customer service standpoint.
[50:32.160 --> 50:33.600]  We don't see a lot of returns on his gear.
[50:33.600 --> 50:36.840]  So, you know, not everything works the first time around
[50:36.840 --> 50:40.000]  and just because two things might sound good together,
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.200]  I'm sure a true breeder will tell you that doesn't mean
[50:42.200 --> 50:44.080]  that they always work good together.
[50:44.080 --> 50:46.000]  And so sometimes you have to thin those out
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.800]  but from a customer service standpoint,
[50:47.800 --> 50:51.280]  I can't see that I've seen any higher return rates
[50:51.280 --> 50:52.920]  on Canerado gear.
[50:52.920 --> 50:54.320]  So I don't know that I can agree with
[50:54.320 --> 50:55.680]  if he's not testing your stuff
[50:55.680 --> 50:58.200]  but he does have a lot of strains from time to time.
[50:58.200 --> 51:00.040]  But it seems to work.
[51:00.040 --> 51:03.480]  Yeah, I think, and maybe I'm wrong in the fact
[51:03.480 --> 51:04.480]  that he doesn't test his stuff.
[51:04.480 --> 51:05.640]  He may test everything.
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.920]  I just, he knows what to work with
[51:07.920 --> 51:12.360]  and kind of how stuff works on a level most guys don't.
[51:12.360 --> 51:13.200]  I have a lot of respect for everything he does.
[51:13.640 --> 51:15.040]  He's also feminizing gear.
[51:15.040 --> 51:16.920]  So it's like feminized.
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.920]  So that's what he's successful.
[51:18.920 --> 51:19.760]  And he puts out a lot.
[51:19.760 --> 51:20.600]  That's the thing.
[51:20.600 --> 51:21.720]  So it's.
[51:21.720 --> 51:22.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[51:22.560 --> 51:23.400]  Yeah.
[51:25.200 --> 51:26.840]  I've always been a little, you know,
[51:26.840 --> 51:29.640]  whenever I see 30 or 40 strains come out at once,
[51:29.640 --> 51:32.280]  I'm always, that's in the back of my head going like.
[51:34.360 --> 51:35.200]  Yeah, Canerado.
[51:35.200 --> 51:37.800]  But if we talk about these guys that now have,
[51:37.800 --> 51:40.200]  I think, but if we talk about now
[51:40.200 --> 51:43.160]  how these guys have access to 2000 plants,
[51:44.000 --> 51:44.840]  that can happen.
[51:44.840 --> 51:47.360]  Yeah, because of the space they're growing out now.
[51:47.360 --> 51:51.360]  I think the spaces that they're growing in now,
[51:51.360 --> 51:53.640]  it's really, you know, it's like acres.
[51:53.640 --> 51:57.200]  So they could, it could be possible
[51:57.200 --> 52:00.880]  that they bringing out 40 strain out of this one hunt,
[52:00.880 --> 52:01.720]  you know?
[52:03.400 --> 52:05.480]  Yeah, or even more.
[52:05.480 --> 52:06.320]  I mean.
[52:06.320 --> 52:09.000]  Yeah, or because they're getting mass
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.640]  that they're growing out of now.
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.480]  Yeah.
[52:12.480 --> 52:13.320]  A lot of people.
[52:13.320 --> 52:14.160]  And I'm with.
[52:15.680 --> 52:18.040]  And for the guys who doing the phenol hunting,
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.400]  it's a lot of fun, you know, I've tried.
[52:20.400 --> 52:21.960]  I've done it a lot.
[52:21.960 --> 52:24.960]  And I know, you know, the excitement
[52:24.960 --> 52:28.320]  and fight you strain in there, you know?
[52:28.320 --> 52:31.840]  So a lot of people may not understand,
[52:31.840 --> 52:35.920]  but this is something necessary for the industry, you know?
[52:38.520 --> 52:39.360]  As far as strains.
[52:39.480 --> 52:42.480]  Yeah, I mean, different too, Marlon.
[52:42.480 --> 52:45.760]  I think kind of with what we're doing in St. Vincent
[52:45.760 --> 52:48.680]  and potentially Trinidad in the near future,
[52:48.680 --> 52:51.720]  where we can, you know, do geoclimatize seeds
[52:51.720 --> 52:55.400]  for specific regions and really stabilize genetics
[52:55.400 --> 52:57.640]  and get stable genetics out to people.
[52:57.640 --> 52:59.760]  And by stable, I'm not talking about,
[53:00.960 --> 53:04.720]  I'm talking about stable as far as inbred lion,
[53:04.720 --> 53:07.480]  not as far as hermaphrodism.
[53:07.520 --> 53:09.960]  Hermaphrodism is actually a trait.
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.080]  Intersexual traits can be in or out of plants.
[53:13.080 --> 53:15.880]  Well, what I wanna do is a less phenotypical variation
[53:15.880 --> 53:19.280]  for farmers that are growing in equatorial regions
[53:19.280 --> 53:22.880]  and tropical regions like Trinidad and the Caribbean
[53:22.880 --> 53:24.480]  and St. Vincent.
[53:24.480 --> 53:26.760]  I think we can bring some unique stuff down there
[53:26.760 --> 53:30.240]  and geoclimatize and geo-acclimated
[53:30.240 --> 53:32.520]  and optimized seeds are the future, I think,
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.360]  especially for regions like that,
[53:34.360 --> 53:35.520]  where they're high humidity
[53:35.520 --> 53:38.400]  and they require a specific variety.
[53:39.640 --> 53:42.120]  So Marlon, do you wanna talk a little bit about our trips
[53:42.120 --> 53:44.960]  to St. Vincent and the land race varieties
[53:44.960 --> 53:46.200]  that we found over there?
[53:47.080 --> 53:47.920]  Oh, sure.
[53:48.800 --> 53:50.560]  The thing about going to St. Vincent,
[53:50.560 --> 53:53.280]  it was kind of, you know,
[53:54.280 --> 53:57.240]  strange to see that the majority of farmers
[53:57.240 --> 53:59.240]  were actually growing hemp, you know?
[53:59.240 --> 54:01.800]  So it was definitely a need for, you know,
[54:01.800 --> 54:03.760]  some good breeding down there.
[54:03.800 --> 54:06.880]  And as far as the land race strain,
[54:06.880 --> 54:10.040]  there was this authentic land race strain
[54:10.040 --> 54:13.400]  that we used to get it from St. Vincent back in the days.
[54:13.400 --> 54:18.400]  And the minister of agriculture assured us
[54:19.080 --> 54:20.520]  that this strain still exists,
[54:20.520 --> 54:24.280]  but we had to take a boat and find,
[54:24.280 --> 54:26.560]  there's a little island off of St. Vincent
[54:26.560 --> 54:28.120]  that it still grows at.
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.160]  So we definitely be going down there
[54:30.160 --> 54:33.920]  and, you know, trying to enhance the genetics down there.
[54:33.920 --> 54:36.560]  In Trinidad, you know,
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.000]  there is a definite need for genetic enhancement
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  because a lot of the farmers don't really understand
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.880]  that you can grow a plant looking like marijuana,
[54:47.880 --> 54:50.400]  but if it goes to a lab and get tested,
[54:50.400 --> 54:53.360]  it's, you know, more CBD than THC.
[54:53.360 --> 54:55.760]  So you can't call it marijuana.
[54:56.600 --> 54:57.440]  So this is what-
[54:57.440 --> 55:01.760]  Yeah, a lot of it's been bred out.
[55:01.760 --> 55:04.160]  I think a lot of the stuff we were looking at,
[55:04.160 --> 55:06.640]  you know, I think maybe started in a good place,
[55:06.640 --> 55:09.840]  making seeds and not doing great selections over years
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.080]  has reinforced the wrong quality
[55:13.080 --> 55:15.120]  in the stuff that we were smoking.
[55:15.120 --> 55:16.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:17.520 --> 55:18.360]  So hopefully-
[55:18.360 --> 55:20.360]  So one thing I always,
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.080]  one thing I was always thinking though is,
[55:24.080 --> 55:27.240]  do you not think though, like back in the day,
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  a lot of Caribbean land races would be CBD heavy anyway
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.560]  because of the medicinal quality
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.400]  and the fact that people are genuinely using it as medicine
[55:37.400 --> 55:42.400]  and it's not so much of a high THC buzz?
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.000]  Well, personally, before they use it for medical,
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.280]  they were using it for, you know, spiritual sacrament
[55:51.280 --> 55:53.880]  as a, you know, so it was about,
[55:53.880 --> 55:56.440]  what about the THC that they get in from it?
[55:57.240 --> 56:02.200]  They only learned about the medical part of it recently
[56:02.200 --> 56:05.040]  or a little further back, you know,
[56:05.040 --> 56:07.520]  probably in the nineties, you know?
[56:07.520 --> 56:10.840]  So it was always for-
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.640]  I'm thinking more like drinking a tea
[56:14.640 --> 56:17.520]  or more in those lines where people aren't so,
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.680]  it's like, it's just more in the society,
[56:20.680 --> 56:21.520]  you know what I mean?
[56:21.520 --> 56:23.200]  Like in Jamaica and things,
[56:23.200 --> 56:24.640]  there's a lot of strains coming out of Jamaica
[56:24.640 --> 56:27.480]  that were high CBD, you know,
[56:27.480 --> 56:30.760]  just because people selected it naturally
[56:30.760 --> 56:32.640]  and it wasn't even a,
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.600]  it wasn't like a bred out thing for the high THC,
[56:35.600 --> 56:38.480]  they just were breeding it for whatever worked.
[56:38.480 --> 56:39.320]  Yeah.
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.560]  Yeah, people smoke a lot there.
[56:41.560 --> 56:44.120]  The guys that smoke are heavy smokers,
[56:44.120 --> 56:45.840]  they smoke a lot of joints.
[56:45.840 --> 56:47.760]  You know, I think that one of the most interesting things
[56:47.760 --> 56:52.240]  I saw in St. Vincent was when you would buy weed
[56:52.240 --> 56:53.640]  off the streets,
[56:53.640 --> 56:55.880]  some of the guys would be selling it wrapped in the paper.
[56:55.880 --> 56:57.680]  So all you'd have to do is roll it up
[56:57.680 --> 57:00.040]  however you wanted to roll it up and smoke it.
[57:00.040 --> 57:03.320]  You know, we went to a house that had,
[57:03.320 --> 57:05.400]  I don't know, maybe six or seven different varieties
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.760]  over there and they were all more strong
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.280]  on the CBD side than on the THC, you know?
[57:13.280 --> 57:15.680]  And some of them have more or less THC,
[57:15.680 --> 57:17.880]  but I'd love to see analysis
[57:17.880 --> 57:19.440]  to see the other molecules in there.
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.360]  Cause I feel like besides just THC and CBD,
[57:24.040 --> 57:25.720]  there was some interesting effects.
[57:26.960 --> 57:29.840]  Well, I had a little bit of that.
[57:31.640 --> 57:34.200]  A lot of the farmers, you know,
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.440]  don't really understand that, you know,
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.000]  how to look at the plant and know that it's CBD
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.840]  or it's going to turn to CBN or it's going to turn,
[57:44.840 --> 57:45.880]  you know what I'm saying?
[57:45.880 --> 57:49.320]  Or they had no way of testing the CBD.
[57:49.320 --> 57:51.680]  So they were just growing a plant for the smell.
[57:51.720 --> 57:55.080]  And you know, sometimes the CBD plants smell real nice,
[57:55.080 --> 57:57.880]  you know, so they were growing plants for smell
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.080]  and trying to, the reason why they smoke so much, James,
[58:02.080 --> 58:04.320]  is because of the low THC percentage.
[58:04.320 --> 58:07.760]  So they smoke, smoke, smoke until they feel the high.
[58:07.760 --> 58:08.600]  You see what I'm saying?
[58:08.600 --> 58:09.600]  Yeah.
[58:09.600 --> 58:14.600]  And that point now, the CBD, they're hungry.
[58:15.320 --> 58:19.160]  And you know me, cause that played a part
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.960]  too much of that now.
[58:20.960 --> 58:25.400]  So it's interesting to see what,
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.720]  cause everyone we gave a THC spliff,
[58:29.760 --> 58:31.760]  if they didn't force, they were like,
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.760]  my God, you know what I'm saying?
[58:34.760 --> 58:36.240]  So.
[58:36.240 --> 58:37.320]  Yeah.
[58:37.320 --> 58:38.840]  It's interesting to see how it works.
[58:38.840 --> 58:41.680]  Yeah, it's like they smoke all day, but not like that.
[58:41.680 --> 58:44.520]  No, they can't smoke that all day, no time.
[58:44.520 --> 58:47.760]  You know, so as a stranger,
[58:47.800 --> 58:50.400]  I'm interested to see the smoking habits
[58:50.400 --> 58:52.360]  of the Caribbean people.
[58:54.120 --> 58:56.560]  Yeah, definitely different down there.
[58:56.560 --> 58:59.440]  I don't see them getting into dabs anytime soon.
[58:59.440 --> 59:00.280]  No, no, no.
[59:00.280 --> 59:01.640]  They run from that.
[59:01.640 --> 59:03.920]  They probably think that's a drug they do.
[59:08.920 --> 59:13.920]  But I know some people down there trying it, you know,
[59:14.880 --> 59:16.160]  trying to extract.
[59:16.160 --> 59:18.240]  First time I saw a dab, I got that was like something,
[59:18.240 --> 59:19.400]  I thought it was like cracker or something.
[59:19.400 --> 59:20.240]  I was like, what is that?
[59:20.240 --> 59:22.800]  You got this torch and you're doing what with it now?
[59:22.800 --> 59:24.120]  Like, what is this?
[59:24.120 --> 59:25.320]  No, I'm not down with that.
[59:25.320 --> 59:26.840]  He was like, no, no, it's good, it's good.
[59:26.840 --> 59:28.200]  I was like, I don't know.
[59:28.200 --> 59:30.480]  I don't know, it's not for me.
[59:30.480 --> 59:33.880]  Hey, Jay, weren't we the heroin addicts in Amsterdam, bro?
[59:33.880 --> 59:38.040]  When people first, what these guys doing, that's heroin?
[59:40.840 --> 59:42.680]  So we're freaking out in 2000,
[59:42.680 --> 59:43.920]  which isn't even that long ago.
[59:43.920 --> 59:45.320]  That was eight years ago.
[59:45.360 --> 59:47.360]  We're coming up on eight years.
[59:47.360 --> 59:51.160]  You know, I had dabs over there.
[59:51.160 --> 59:53.240]  I had different varieties, all kinds of stuff.
[59:53.240 --> 59:54.960]  I think I blew Franco's mind.
[59:54.960 --> 59:59.960]  That's how Franco from Greenhouse Seeds and Arian and I met.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.200]  You know, Franco saw this stuff and he's like blown away.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.360]  You know, there was some people
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.520]  that had brought over extract,
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.760]  but I feel like I was the first person
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.080]  to really bring over all the varieties of extract
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.240]  that you can get when Shatter first started coming out.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.400]  And we had, you know, sauce and stuff like that.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.240]  We didn't even call it sauce back then,
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.160]  but we had all these different extracts and yeah,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.280]  the torch people were looking at us like crazy,
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.080]  shaking their heads, like, what are these guys doing?
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.920]  Thinking we're doing some hard drugs.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.240]  Yeah, interesting times how far it's come since then.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.320]  For sure.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.400]  Like it used to be like the events,
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.920]  I remember used to mimic old rave scenes
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.720]  because you'd have, you know, chicks would fall out.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.960]  Five or six people would fall out from dabs.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.120]  The ambulance would come in
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.720]  and put the fluid on his personal stretcher
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.280]  and wheel him out of the event.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.120]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:47.960]  So it was just, you know,
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.920]  it used to go with some of the old events
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.840]  at the Cow Palace in San Francisco.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.160]  It was just, they put us in the back corner
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.080]  and it was so smoky.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.120]  They just, they'd come by our booth and give him a dab.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.560]  And it was just, one of my salesperson doesn't even smoke
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.640]  and she got secondhand high, she had to go home.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.040]  So, you know, it was crazy.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.520]  Two minutes before I go on the stage to perform
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.280]  and my DJ is stretched out on a pool table.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.600]  Because he took, we had to.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.800]  Literally.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.000]  Yeah, we had to get a fill in for him, man.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.760]  Because he slept, hey bro.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.120]  Yeah, so yeah, that's a great story though.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.360]  Yeah, we smoked those dabs down below your milk bag
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.000]  and your guy, I don't think he'd ever done a dab before.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.840]  Yeah, but smoking.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.560]  Your DJ and man, I thought you guys were hella pissed at us.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]  You know, we gave him a dab
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.160]  and he literally had both his arms out,
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.000]  his eyes closed.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.760]  He was still smoking, but there was no way
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.520]  he was getting on stage to mix any records.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.240]  Yeah, we've been friends since.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.240]  I thought, you know, it was going one of two ways back then.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.200]  That was good fun, man.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.680]  Yeah, we've ruined a lot of shows in our years.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.520]  That's for sure.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.000]  It's been one of the classics, right?
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.600]  We just, you're watching the show
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.720]  and everyone's like, wow, they were really bad.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.480]  And you're like, yeah, it's my fault, sorry.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.560]  Sorry about that.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.400]  They would've cared.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.560]  I was about to say, I hate to be the guy that did that.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.880]  I knocked out the guy, he can't do his job.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:24.840]  I always hide it back because it's coming back to Marley
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.560]  sooner or later, bro.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.200]  But you take some good times, man,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.560]  and turn it into a disaster because of them.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.760]  Man, dabs, bro, they get you, don't they?
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.680]  Oh man, yeah, it's like, it's funny
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.640]  because I really know my limits now
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.480]  with smoking extracts in general.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.400]  I'm more of a Puffco sort of guy.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.080]  I'll still take dabs now and then,
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.040]  but man, just a little bit too much
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.760]  and you can be out for the count.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.440]  I mean, I think I have a thing with edibles.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.720]  Like I really like Delta 8.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.840]  I don't know if you guys are familiar with Delta 8,
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.080]  but that's my new, my new jam is the Delta 8 edibles,
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.040]  especially for sleep.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.800]  I feel like I get really constant sleep.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.600]  I have this aura ring that I wear
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.200]  and this thing monitors my sleep
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.560]  kind of like how the Fitbits do it,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.400]  but I feel like a little better
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.400]  and my resting heart rate drops really low.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.280]  Whereas if I smoke before I go to bed
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.560]  or I eat a traditional edible,
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.040]  I can't sleep or I don't sleep that well.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.400]  What do you guys think about Delta 8?
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.840]  Delta 8 as far as edibles, if you guys have had them before.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.640]  I haven't had them before,
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.440]  but edibles are a whole different animal
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.400]  just because you can sit down and puff hard
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.560]  does not mean you can handle edibles.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.080]  Like they will knock you out
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.080]  if you're not familiar with them.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.560]  Like a little one or, you know, the classic story,
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.080]  you know, I took, ate half the brownie
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.960]  and I didn't feel anything.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.000]  So I ate the other half and then fuck,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.040]  first one you hit and then I knew I was fucked.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.280]  You know, like, edibles are a different animal.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.720]  I enjoy them, I like popcorn.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.320]  I got pretty loaded a couple of indirects years ago
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.680]  and it's gotten hard to sell.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.400]  But yeah, edibles are a different animal for sure.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.680]  Yeah, popcorn is actually a good one
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.040]  just because it's kind of like you can kind of regulate it
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.120]  and you're going slow at it, kind of coming in slow.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.720]  But certain edibles, the most intense one I ever had
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.920]  was that caught me off guard was in LA 2009
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.480]  at the after show from the THC convention
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.840]  that they put on that Brian put on.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.520]  And I was at this, we were there, went to this party,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.600]  they had no alcohol, they just had a dab bar set up
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.920]  and this is 2009 and they just had like,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.280]  they had that medicated milk shots.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.200]  They were about this big, they were tiny, right?
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.600]  So a girl comes over, I take one,
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.240]  I go, give me another one, right?
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.840]  Do another one.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.280]  And literally two tiny shots and within 15 minutes
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.800]  I like started to slur.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.960]  My mom was looking at me and she's like,
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.800]  what's wrong with you?
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.640]  And I started to like, I thought I had a stroke.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.480]  I was like, I get like, wow.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.040]  I just like, yeah, it was crazy how strong it was.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.080]  And yeah, I think that kind of edibles
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.160]  are either too good or not at all.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.960]  There's just no in between, you know what I mean?
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.360]  Like there's this, they're very hard to nail that one.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.320]  The micro is better than the corner of the gummy, you know?
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.400]  I feel like that the micro,
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.040]  I think that's the future with edibles too
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.520]  is that where you get the bag of treats
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.200]  is Americans just want to be fat, right?
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.760]  So, you know, it's part of the whole thing
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.400]  is like a whole bag of candy during the movie.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.200]  I don't want to eat just a half a gummy
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.840]  or half a gummy bear just in Ted.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.240]  Marlon, what's your opinion on edibles?
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.240]  Well, I've actually got, you know, a phobia.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.480]  I must say I'm kind of scared of the edibles.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.000]  They put me down.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  And also I got a crazy story that I took some,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.040]  these four gummies, I guess, four of them.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  And one of my young sisters
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.080]  throw them on my table and she ate it.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.880]  Oh my gosh.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.920]  That was one of the most scariest time I had in my life.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.440]  And she spread out and all peed on herself.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.640]  So since then I don't mess too much with the gummies.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.080]  I became, that's telling people,
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.480]  oh, don't do much of that.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.520]  You're going to this, you're going to that.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.560]  You know, so for me, I eat one piece
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.400]  and I try to not eat too much.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.680]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.640]  But I'm kind of scared of the gummies.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.480]  We've all had a lot of good people do it, you know?
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.240]  People do dabs, but they won't do gummies.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.240]  You know, I used to make-
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.600]  When you eat it, something different about eating it
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.320]  than smoking it.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.120]  I would not lie to you.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:01.960]  It's different.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:03.880]  It's really different.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:07.600]  I used to make, the last 20 years I've been making edibles,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.240]  I'd say since maybe even longer, since 96, 97,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.520]  I used to make a lot of edibles.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.560]  And I was friends with Trey Kuhl
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.120]  from Green Day back in the day.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.680]  And he was going on tour in Europe.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.800]  And this is maybe 2007 or something like that.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.600]  And he said he wanted really, really strong gummies
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.960]  and he didn't want them to smell like weed.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.920]  And so I was super nervous because, you know,
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.760]  he's a big time celebrity guy.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.560]  And so I was making these edibles and I'm like,
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.920]  fuck, I got to add more.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.440]  And we don't have the quality extracts to put in
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.840]  like we do today.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.880]  So I was using butter that I boiled in water first
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.360]  and then added a rock with some cheesecloth
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.840]  and a bunch of trim.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.160]  And so, you know, you don't really know how strong it is.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.520]  And I had people trimming in my living room
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.480]  as I'm making the brownies, I'm tasting them,
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.680]  and I'm tasting them, and I'm tasting them.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.520]  And all of a sudden I start feeling a little funky
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.560]  and I go to the back to go to the bathroom
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.560]  and like wash my face.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.680]  And I realized I'm really fucking high
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.160]  and my heart starts beating really hard and I'm tripping.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.800]  And I'm like, well, fuck, I hope they're strong enough.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.160]  So I go out and I taste them one more time
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.000]  because I was nervous about it.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.200]  And next thing you know, I'm curled up in a ball
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.720]  in the back room in my bed.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.440]  And my wife is at work at the time.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.000]  And so I call her and I'm like, fuck, fuck,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.720]  I'm really sweating and my heart's beating.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720]  I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  I need you to take me to the hospital.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.600]  And, you know, she starts yelling at me.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.040]  Like, you need to man the fuck up
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.040]  and you have people trimming in the front room.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.360]  I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.560]  You know, and I'm like, fuck,
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.440]  I'm making neighbors know that I'm high.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.320]  And she hangs the phone up on me, you know?
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.600]  And it's like, I feel like there's those kinds
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.280]  of crazy stories surrounding dabs and edibles,
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.480]  especially for cannabis.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.080]  Yeah, and edibles are those ones where it's,
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.360]  especially because none of us knew the dosage.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.520]  Like you were saying, we're always just like eyeballing
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.400]  this and that and it's depending on the quality
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400]  of whatever you're working with.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:19.200]  But yeah, we used to have, you know,
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.840]  many a time when you just,
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.800]  you knew you handed somebody an edible
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.640]  and you're just like, it was a bad mistake.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.480]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.440]  It was like, oh, that was the wrong.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.400]  Because people think it's weak.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.240]  That's the problem.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.600]  You get people like always believing
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.680]  it's the low end of the thing,
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.280]  but it's actually the top end
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.160]  because it bypasses the liver.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  So it's like, it's one of those things where it goes,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.640]  it crushes you after, you know?
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.320]  And you can really,
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.840]  and it's the next day that really affects me.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.880]  Like I'll eat edibles,
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.520]  not enough to get really high that day,
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.400]  but the next day I'll still feel it.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.440]  I'll wake up in the morning and I'll be like,
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.400]  what the fuck?
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.240]  And then I'll be like, yes.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.320]  Two in the morning, I ate an edible at two in the morning
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.160]  like an idiot, you know?
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.480]  Like what was I thinking?
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.200]  Like, what was I thinking at that point in time?
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.400]  Like, am I going to get high from this?
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.240]  No, I'm going to sleep really good
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.240]  and I'm going to feel real groggy the next day, you know?
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.960]  So yeah, edibles are still good though.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.880]  It's amazing how,
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.680]  what's that?
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.240]  So that's what I love about Delta 8s
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.040]  and that's why you guys all got to try Delta 8 edibles.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.400]  Delta 8 gummies are amazing.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.040]  And I feel like I don't have that hangover the next day.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.680]  And I probably between 20 and 40 milligrams.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.160]  I think some of my friends eat as low as 10 milligrams.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.400]  It's not as strong as like the traditional Delta 9,
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.600]  but I feel like Delta 8 gives me that kind of a strong,
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.240]  strong high behind the eyes a little bit.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.760]  But I wake up refreshed the next day.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.280]  Whereas like, if I eat an edible, man,
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.800]  I feel like shit the next day.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.320]  I feel like it can be just as bad
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.320]  or worse than a hangover in some ways.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.720]  Worse, yeah.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.200]  And sometimes it's not just one day.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.200]  It's like multiple days now that I'm getting older, you know?
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.120]  Worse, man.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.840]  I have bad experience with the edibles.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:09.840]  I think it's-
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.560]  What's weird with edibles is the next day
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.720]  it's all behind my shoulders.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.520]  It's like, I have this weird tension
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.120]  behind like my shoulders.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:19.960]  It's strange.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.280]  It's like, you know, like,
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.120]  definitely.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.440]  I'm gonna make a good edible that people could eat
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.040]  without having fear of being too high.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.080]  And I'm gonna make a good, put it out there.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.000]  You'll see.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.520]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.640]  Yeah.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.400]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of potential
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.360]  for that in the future because of the,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:48.720]  you know, the way we all feel.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.840]  And, you know, we're not alone.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.960]  It's like, I feel like most people feel like that.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.000]  And, you know, unfortunately I feel like
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.160]  a lot of people coming into the,
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.320]  into the, you know, trying marijuana for the first time,
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.560]  cannabis for the first time,
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.400]  they go and they don't wanna smoke
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.720]  so they get edibles from some dispensary.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.440]  Then they have a shit experience with it.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.960]  And then they're like, oh, fuck marijuana,
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.640]  fuck pot, fuck all that stuff.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.880]  It's terrible.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.400]  Yeah, they don't want any part of it.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.000]  And they really, they really skip the enjoyable part,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.480]  unfortunately, and just get stuck with a shit experience.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.640]  No, that's true.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.400]  I've heard of people like rent a hotel room
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.080]  for their first time experiencing it.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.000]  But yeah, I mean, if they get an edible
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.720]  and get too loaded, then they're done.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.760]  Yeah, I think there was some cop in California
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.960]  that stole marijuana from edibles from the other,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.840]  and then calling 911, you know, on themselves.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.200]  And, you know, I think, you know, that's just,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.800]  you know, edibles are potent and it's just,
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.040]  it's still interesting.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.600]  I don't get that high anymore, man.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.960]  Like I just don't get that high.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.800]  It sucks.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880]  Yeah, I mean, we're all too old, man.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.120]  We are gonna do a 5280 challenge
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.600]  on the Adam Dunn show soon.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.800]  We're gonna consume 5280 milligrams between three of us
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.440]  and we're gonna do it in a kind of game show fashion.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.320]  So we don't know who's gonna get the most of it.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.520]  So it's gonna be, yeah, it should be good.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.200]  We're gonna put it together soon.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.440]  Keep an eye out for that.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.840]  That's gonna be crazy.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.160]  They're probably only gonna be like 800 milligrams.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.000]  It's a mile.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.400]  It changes the numbers.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.400]  I wouldn't wanna be that man.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.000]  Oh no, no, we're gonna make sure.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.840]  We're gonna make sure.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:37.840]  We're gonna have it done proper.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.480]  We're having D money's gonna make us the bar.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.240]  So it's gonna be literally one,
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.400]  one 5,280 milligram bar.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.320]  The mile high, that's the real mile high bar
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.920]  right there proper.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.760]  So.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.120]  Mile high bar.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.320]  I don't think I can eat it by myself.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.360]  So it'd be a three way split, you know.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.820]  Nice.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.500]  No, who's gonna get the majority by the game show.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.500]  By the game show, you know who's gonna get it.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.420]  Yeah, I can just do it as a sort of easy.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.340]  Well, yeah, I'll make sure I rig it.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.220]  So I don't, I don't wanna, yeah.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.060]  I'll have it all rigged.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.420]  Yeah, you're not the one, huh?
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.900]  Yeah, I mean, even the CBD
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.380]  I think you fucked up a little bit.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.380]  That's a lot.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.900]  That's way too much for anybody that I know.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.140]  I mean, I've seen people eat 500 milligrams.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.260]  At a certain point.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.020]  5,000 milligrams, that's a lot.
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.820]  Yeah, I mean, the thing is that at a certain point
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.380]  you just sort of, you tap out, right?
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.620]  You know, it's just like.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.500]  I think your body goes through so much.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.660]  I actually think that there's edibles
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:51.860]  for like recreational people.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.300]  Then I think there's edibles for people
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.940]  that are like kicking pain pills.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:58.300]  I know that my VP, he was, you know, maybe on, you know.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.220]  Like, so the first time I had this one surgery
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.780]  and they gave me oxys.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:04.220]  And I had oxys for two weeks.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.340]  And then like that next, as soon as I was out of them
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.300]  I was just like the worst person in the world.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.620]  Felt like shit, life was hell.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.860]  It was worse, it was a horrible thing.
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.700]  I was just like, God, I don't ever want to do that again.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.500]  And I had another surgery
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.580]  and they wanted to give me oxys again.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.100]  I was like, fuck no, like you can keep those things.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.300]  And so I had my friend made me like 500 milligram gummies.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.780]  And then I would just, you know, once they're, you know
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.180]  on a regulated dosage where you can titrate your doses
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.940]  and then, you know, you take two 500 milligrams
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:31.180]  of gummies in the morning, two at noon,
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.060]  two in the evening.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.740]  And instead of taking your pain pills
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:35.940]  you can take an old gummy or an edible or something.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.540]  That's, you know, now you're not taking it for enjoyment
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.500]  or to get high or to get low.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500]  You're taking it because you don't want to smoke
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.100]  or you can't smoke or you don't like to smoke
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.500]  but you still want to get the benefits of weed.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.540]  So, you know, there's also two different markets
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.580]  to always look at it.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.060]  Totally, but 500 milligrams for me
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.260]  and 500 milligrams for you might be a different test.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.140]  That's the only real problem.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.700]  Right, but once you figure it out though
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.060]  then you can titrate your dosage and take down, you know
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:02.780]  one and a half gummies works for you
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.740]  and you just take one and a half gummies every day.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.140]  Totally, no, I think, and that's a beautiful thing
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:10.060]  is learning how to dose yourself.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.620]  You know, I think there's a lot of potential future.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:19.740]  So as far as Marlon, you want to talk a little bit
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.660]  about the music industry and during COVID, you know
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.420]  and how it's been affected.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.140]  I know you haven't done any shows
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.020]  and pretty much the industry has been hurting
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.300]  unlike the cannabis industry
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.060]  which I feel like is thriving.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.380]  The music industry has been suffering.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.700]  And, you know, I saw that you were on
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.300]  with Scott Scorch last week.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.860]  You guys were on the beach doing some music.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.300]  You want to talk about the industry a little bit?
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.980]  Well, as far as the music industry go,
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.260]  I don't really know when it would resume
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.260]  and get to a space of being normal, you know.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.980]  Shows has dwindled.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.020]  There isn't, you know, any lucrative income
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.980]  from music right now, you know, just
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.780]  if you got your royalties coming in,
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.260]  that's just about it, you know.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:12.260]  Live streams is what people are trying to perfect right now
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.660]  and get it to a point where the artist
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:19.020]  may get an income from it, you know.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.980]  As far as recording music, it's always good
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:22.940]  to go to the studio.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.420]  I try to make music whenever I get the chance.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.620]  On the beach with Scott Scorch,
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.180]  that was actually a business venture that I was on
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:38.580]  and some new music that is going to be recorded in LA.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:42.340]  I'm actually moving to LA like probably next month
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.820]  or month after, trying to find an apartment there right now.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.900]  So as far as music go, you know,
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.820]  despite it's not having any shows,
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.340]  I think music would not be, you know,
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.260]  it won't, it will dwindle, but it won't die
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:00.860]  because even though people stuck at home,
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.700]  they need some form of entertainment
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:04.140]  and when they're not watching TV,
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.180]  they're listening to music, you know.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.180]  So I guess always keep making music so that you would,
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:15.820]  you know, eventually get back to a space
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.860]  where you could actually make money for it
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.180]  from making that music.
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:21.940]  So a lot of the artists nowadays that I know,
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:25.980]  they trying to do videos and keep visual
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.420]  and keep themselves in the visual limelight
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:34.580]  and making new songs, you know, to always be heard.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.580]  So as far as music going and the music industries go,
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:42.180]  hopefully next year we'll see a liberation
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.900]  to what is going on now, you know.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.100]  Yeah.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.420]  Yeah, I hope things get better.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.140]  I think I've been really fortunate to watch
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.500]  a bunch of my favorite musicians like yourself,
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.660]  you know, performing this year on video
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.540]  and, you know, not making any money doing it
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.980]  or doing fundraisers.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.140]  Like I think you did a fundraiser not too long ago
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.980]  that was really good.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.140]  But like Kyle from Slightly Stupid, you know,
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.060]  he did one on Facebook and Instagram.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.620]  My friend, Michael Brom, who's Jason Mraz's drummer,
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:19.180]  he's also a guitar player in the Michael Brom Band.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.300]  And he plays with the Waite Band.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:25.780]  And he does a weekly show on Wednesdays, you know,
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:28.780]  and I think a lot of musicians have been struggling.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.340]  You know, Adam and I, we love comedy shows.
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.580]  And unfortunately there's no stage shows right now.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.300]  We got to see Eric Andre not too long ago.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.100]  I guess it was February, Adam?
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:42.940]  Hmm.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.060]  And that show was, you know,
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.740]  that was the show before his live show.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.940]  And I thought it was, the show was amazing.
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.420]  Like Adam and I both had a great time at the show.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:56.940]  And then I saw the live on Netflix.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:01.220]  It's the, yeah, Legalize Everything, right?
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.140]  That was the name of it.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:02.980]  So that's the tour.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:03.820]  Yeah, Legalize Everything.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.500]  It's up now.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.780]  On Netflix.
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.980]  It's a good, it was a great show.
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:09.820]  Yeah, on Netflix.
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:10.660]  It was a great show, right?
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.140]  Wasn't it?
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.740]  Yeah, it was an amazing show.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.860]  I feel like our live show that we saw before,
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.700]  the one that's on Netflix was even better though.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.340]  And sometimes that happens
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:21.860]  and it was all the same context.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:22.700]  It was.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.740]  Good stuff.
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.580]  Yeah.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.340]  But they definitely, it was definitely,
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:31.860]  and the mushrooms helped.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.700]  So there you go.
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.980]  They always, mushrooms always help.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.820]  Always help.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:36.980]  Yeah.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:37.820]  That's always help.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.100]  Mushrooms always help.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.900]  Legalize 2020, mushrooms.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:43.300]  Yeah.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:44.980]  Yeah.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.340]  We go to have a couple of time
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.180]  and then there was mushrooms.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.020]  Ha ha ha.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:50.900]  Yeah.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.740]  It's all over.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.060]  The show is all over, right?
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.740]  I like that.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.420]  Yeah, so what are your legalizations?
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.940]  Marlon, you wanna start off with the,
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.900]  talking about the legalization of mushrooms
[01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.100]  and how you feel about it
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.020]  and anything you'd like to add?
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.860]  Gee, you know how much I love mushrooms.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.660]  So you, and that's a good.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.740]  You know I like to be on my mushroom.
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.940]  Well, as far as the legalization of mushroom goes,
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.380]  I think it's a good thing.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:21.260]  I think, you know, that, you know, people,
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:23.020]  I think everybody should try mushroom.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.260]  That's just my opinion.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.060]  Now, what I'm saying is that, you know,
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.620]  I applaud the move to, you know,
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.460]  legalize the mushroom because
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.620]  my experience with it, you know,
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:41.820]  has only been enlightening and positive for me.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.380]  So of course I would want everybody
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:46.500]  to be able to experience this, you know?
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.340]  Definitely that.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:52.420]  I'm all for legalization of the mushroom.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.260]  Yeah.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.540]  James, what's your, on mushrooms and,
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.460]  you know, your experience with mushrooms?
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.100]  Well, very good experience.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.580]  Everybody's going to have that one bad experience
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.340]  with, you know, kayaking or something
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.940]  and you think you have crocodiles around you.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.060]  You just need to ride that shit out.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:14.900]  You know what I mean?
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.180]  But once you deal with that,
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.900]  then everything else is usually better.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.420]  I definitely see, I'm from Oregon.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.420]  So Oregon's all over that shit
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.980]  as far as got some bills in the works.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.740]  But it's also another natural, you know,
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:33.740]  plant product given to us to use, you know?
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:38.780]  It's not, it's not manipulated
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.500]  or chemicals added to it.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.140]  It's a natural item that I definitely think
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.620]  everybody should definitely experience
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.100]  once or twice or 10 times.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.900]  Everybody likes you.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.940]  And follow my guy, Microtech.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.700]  Shout out to Microtech, the breeder.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.300]  Puts out excellent gear.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.940]  He's also, he's a great,
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.100]  I got a great room if you look at his Instagram,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:00.940]  at Microtech.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:02.380]  Yeah.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.180]  Nice, Adam?
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:10.580]  Being in Denver, kind of a center for everything mushrooms?
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:11.700]  Yeah, what can you say?
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.780]  Denver got cool again, basically.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.540]  Once again, Denver jumped ahead
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.660]  and actually, you know, passed that.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.020]  Friends of ours were involved with that.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:26.340]  And it was, so it's like, it's inevitable
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.140]  that this psychedelic wave is gonna take over America
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.060]  and it's gonna happen quick, pretty quick
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:34.340]  because I think cannabis really paved the way for this
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:38.260]  because all the people that worked on that campaign here
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.620]  were all cannabis people that said like,
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.060]  fuck, if we can do it with cannabis,
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.500]  we can do this with mushrooms too.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.580]  And all psychedelics for that matter.
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.060]  And I think it's the time, it's perfect timing
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.860]  because right now, like look at all the people that are,
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:54.500]  you know, don't have healthcare.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:58.860]  They're in a situation of high stress right now
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.540]  because of this whole bullshit COVID
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.460]  and all this other stuff.
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:07.140]  Psychedelics are literally gonna be the bridge
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:11.780]  that is gonna make a huge, huge fucking splash,
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.420]  especially when it comes to PTSD.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.820]  And all, I mean, right now people are getting PTSD
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.220]  from what's happening around them
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.340]  and they don't even know it.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.340]  And so there's gonna be a huge awakening
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.060]  and it's gonna be great to watch
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.100]  because we all know it's gonna happen
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.940]  and the rest of the country doesn't have a clue.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.220]  And all of a sudden this is gonna,
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.020]  you think cannabis surprised people?
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.620]  Fuck, psychedelics are gonna just literally
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.660]  blow people's minds, right?
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.500]  It's like, wow.
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.300]  They're gonna be like.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.540]  I think the world would be a happier place.
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.500]  What have I been missing?
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.020]  You know, and microdosing is,
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.540]  I think microdosing is the key
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:50.020]  because everybody, we all macrodose, right?
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:52.860]  We're all part of that like whole generation of people
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.540]  that are just looking for the hit every time, right?
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.620]  We want it to work.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.540]  And like, when it came to alcohol, we loved our IPAs.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.620]  When it came to beer, we don't want that.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.340]  We want something strong.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.060]  When it comes to weed, we want the best weed.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.980]  When it comes to dabs, we want it to,
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.540]  we take it to the next level.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.660]  So we're always like that.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.140]  That's just inevitable, especially in America,
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.980]  more than anybody.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.580]  But I think with psychedelics,
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.380]  the fact that people can take small, tiny microdoses
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.540]  and not get those effects that they're scared of.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:27.420]  And then all of a sudden see other benefits, that's huge.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.620]  And then on top of that,
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.700]  mushrooms are way more diverse than cannabis
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.220]  when it comes to like what they can do.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.740]  I mean, they can do everything.
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.740]  They can literally regulate every aspect
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:46.620]  of what we need to cure right now, which is health.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:50.140]  And also there's tons of practical uses for mushrooms too,
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.300]  which is like endless, you know?
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.900]  So all of a sudden you're like, wait a minute,
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:57.620]  you know how many products we can do with hemp, right?
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:58.780]  But when it comes to,
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.780]  if you combine hemp and mushrooms together
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.180]  and put them into like a powerhouse sort of thing
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.580]  and let a bunch of scientists go to work on it,
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:08.460]  it's gonna be amazing, you know?
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.420]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:12.900]  That's all I can say.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:16.740]  Yeah, I think that-
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.580]  You get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.620]  You get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.940]  You get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.820]  And that was-
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.660]  Yeah, funny, I think that mushrooms-
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:26.500]  Right, pretty much.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.660]  If you schedule it, it's just, you know,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.060]  it's probably gonna get descheduled
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.900]  before cannabis, unfortunately,
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.460]  which I think is kind of sad that-
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:39.020]  Because cannabis is so badly written.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.300]  Cannabis is so heavily written into every part of the bill
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.580]  and we've enforced it so heavily everywhere else
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.940]  in the world, but yeah.
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.500]  Where mushrooms isn't as punishable
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:49.300]  or isn't as scaled or like even like
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.540]  the federal system, when they give you bookings,
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.660]  it's everything that equals so much,
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.620]  you know, tons of weed or so many pounds of weed.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.060]  And that's the pounds of weed is the judgment scale
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.180]  as far as how many months you get in federal prison.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.940]  And so, I mean, everything is tied to cannabis.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.820]  And so to untie the fucking knot that they put it in
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.380]  is gonna be a bitch, but yeah,
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.060]  mushrooms should slide underneath there and get punished
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.380]  because they don't regulate as hard, you know?
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.140]  Yes. Totally.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.700]  So I think we still have some time for some questions.
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.340]  Peter, you wanna ask some questions from the chat?
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.900]  If there's any questions, that'd be great.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:26.100]  Yeah. So if people are gonna start posting questions,
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.340]  I had taken some a while ago.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:33.300]  Chris Butler asked a long time ago,
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.140]  can you ask what could cause plants
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.340]  to get nanners besides genetics?
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.340]  Lots of shit like this.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.780]  On that one, I would say that what causes,
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:47.940]  you know, things like light leaks,
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.820]  you know, we can argue that all day.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.460]  Some people go in and out of their rooms,
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:54.140]  but you know, it really comes down to genetics
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.700]  at the end of the day, like strong genetics.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.260]  You can go in and out of your room,
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.580]  but if you have stuff that's more susceptible to it,
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.780]  you know, there's levels to that stuff
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.580]  and you can breathe it in or you can breathe it out.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:09.980]  And, you know, I mean, I won a cannabis cup
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.820]  with stuff that had bananas popping off it in 2012
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:16.940]  with the loud scout that we had entered had a bunch.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.820]  I mean, there's probably 20 in the entry of 40 grams.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:24.300]  There was at least 20 little male flowers
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.540]  that I actually had to pull off before we entered it in.
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:29.340]  So it's not always a bad thing.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.140]  I think seeds are a bad thing,
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.380]  but a little bit of those is not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.540]  And if you look at long-term,
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.820]  those things can be bred out with good breeding and genetics.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.140]  Anyone else wanna touch on that?
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:46.500]  Yeah, also you'd like, you're like, yeah, 100% agree.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.220]  Like it all comes down to genetics.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:50.420]  You can't get banners without a plant
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.780]  that's gonna produce those manners
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:53.100]  because some plants just don't do it.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:53.940]  You know what I mean?
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.780]  So-
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.180]  Can I stress that plant out?
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:58.620]  Can't they stress the shit out of that plant
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:01.140]  with getting overfeeding it and force it?
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:04.180]  Like there's very few plants that you can't make-
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.340]  It's still in the trunks.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:10.100]  Well, no, there's, I don't know.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:11.820]  I mean, I have stuff that will never go home
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.340]  because it just doesn't do it
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.020]  no matter how much you fucking interrupt it,
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.300]  light cycles, mess around with it.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.220]  And you have other plants that are just highly susceptible.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.860]  So I think it literally all comes back to genetics.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.660]  And there's really no,
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:26.020]  there's many things that can cause those manners,
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:29.540]  but if you wanna trace it back,
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:32.940]  you're gonna say it's a genetic trait of the plant.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.180]  And some, I mean, there's been a lot of plants
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.300]  over the years that have been like,
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.860]  even sour, sour diesel throws manners.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.700]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.860]  There's plants out there that are obviously worth keeping.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.740]  You know what I mean?
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.780]  Cookies does, cookies for sure.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.780]  I mean, look at, there's,
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.820]  but there's also types of manners you gotta watch out for.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.780]  Some are not fertile at all.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:55.980]  Some of them don't do shit.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.060]  So you don't have to worry about it.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.780]  You never get a seed in a plant, you know?
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.300]  So other ones are highly potent
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.500]  and you wanna get rid of those things
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.980]  probably out of your garden, so.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.820]  And they fuck up your whole room.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.780]  Yeah.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.260]  I remember that's one of my first grows.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.100]  I didn't realize that.
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.020]  If one plant harmed on you,
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.300]  that you'd wish that plant would harm.
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.180]  I didn't realize that if one plant harmed,
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:16.380]  everything in the fucking room got seeds.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:19.140]  And so it was like, oh, yeah, you got everything.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.660]  As I was trimming out later.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.300]  Yeah, and I think, you know,
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.780]  as far as from a breeding perspective,
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.700]  that doesn't mean you shouldn't,
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.300]  you just have to know how to breed with it.
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.340]  So if you have something that has, you know,
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.260]  a tendency to have intersexual traits expressed,
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.980]  that's something that you would actually wanna use
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.780]  as a receiver and not as a donor.
[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.420]  You know, I think using it as a donor
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.980]  means you can increase the amount of intersexual traits,
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.860]  whereas using it as a receiver,
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.020]  you can actually start to breed that out
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:49.540]  through the selection process.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:51.380]  You know, wedding cake is a perfect example.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.220]  It's like cherry pie.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.340]  Cherry pie notoriously grows seeds.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.340]  It's like cherry pie.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.180]  Yeah.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.540]  Cherry pie notoriously grows seeds.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:02.780]  Yeah, so for cherry pie, if you use it as a receiver,
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:03.620]  you're good.
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:05.100]  Whereas if you use it as a donor,
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:06.700]  you're probably gonna have issues with it.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.140]  And there's so many things like that,
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:10.500]  if you understand how the genetics work,
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.020]  and every plant's different.
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:13.900]  So if you understand how your plant works
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.060]  that you're working with, you know,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.900]  it goes a lot better than to just start creating seeds
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.500]  from stuff you've never worked with before,
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.500]  it's real difficult.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:23.900]  Oh, a thousand percent.
[01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.790]  And that's why when some guys tell me
[01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:31.110]  that so-and-so doesn't test his gear,
[01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:32.790]  they'll complain about, you know,
[01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:33.710]  not gonna drop my names,
[01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:35.470]  but somebody who's got like 200 strains out,
[01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.350]  and they say, so-and-so doesn't test his gear.
[01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:39.990]  But his gear, like it's so solid,
[01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:41.310]  and he's been doing it for so long,
[01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:42.390]  using the same stuff.
[01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:44.830]  It's like, it's kind of like when you put Brad Pitt
[01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:46.150]  and Angelina Jolie together,
[01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:47.990]  you kind of know what you're gonna get out of the thing.
[01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.830]  You know what I mean?
[01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:49.830]  Like every now and then,
[01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:52.150]  you're gonna have someone to the law,
[01:31:52.150 --> 01:31:54.030]  but other than that, you're pretty much guaranteed
[01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.950]  to have the same kind of thing.
[01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:58.110]  And so some breeders know by working with their plants,
[01:31:58.110 --> 01:31:59.950]  they know what they're gonna do.
[01:31:59.950 --> 01:32:02.150]  It's a terrible example, terrible example.
[01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:02.990]  I know.
[01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.070]  Okay, so we-
[01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.910]  I-
[01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:11.230]  Go ahead, Merle.
[01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:14.350]  I think, adding a little to it,
[01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.270]  I think first they have to know
[01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.990]  if they want to use it as a donor or receiver
[01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:22.670]  before they decide, you know,
[01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.350]  which way they wanna go with the plant.
[01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:27.030]  Cause actually, if it's receiving,
[01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:29.710]  it will just take the traits from whatever plant
[01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:31.150]  is your donor,
[01:32:31.150 --> 01:32:35.230]  and still remain with whatever traits,
[01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:39.550]  you know, it was genetically, you know,
[01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:41.670]  and if it's a donor,
[01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:44.030]  it's just given just what traits
[01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:46.870]  you're getting from this plant to that plant.
[01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.830]  So it's not really taking away,
[01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.310]  taking any, you know,
[01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:54.150]  genetic defaults with it.
[01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:59.910]  So, I guess they should decide with which-
[01:32:59.910 --> 01:33:00.750]  But would you not still have-
[01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:01.830]  Which way they want to-
[01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:02.670]  Which is,
[01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:09.190]  if you took it, say, a cherry pie was your receiver
[01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:12.310]  on that situation, and it had hermaphroditic traits,
[01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:14.030]  that would still pass on though, wouldn't it?
[01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:16.550]  I mean, I don't see how that would not change that
[01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.790]  on the next generation.
[01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:21.870]  So with the next generation,
[01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:22.710]  Yeah, cause-
[01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:24.670]  It passes on for sure, 100%.
[01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:27.350]  But the thing is, is you can start doing the selection process
[01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:29.150]  and you're gonna have better results
[01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:30.830]  using certain strains as receivers
[01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:32.270]  and certain strains as donors.
[01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:34.750]  And the ones that have the intersexual traits,
[01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:36.430]  if you don't use them as a receiver,
[01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:38.830]  you're less intersexual traits in the progeny
[01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:43.830]  than you would if you were to use it as a receiver.
[01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:46.790]  Okay, all right, I wasn't sure on that one.
[01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:49.990]  Yeah, at least that's my experience.
[01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:52.750]  If you have a different, I'd love to hear about it,
[01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.870]  but I've seen that, you know,
[01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.590]  I think wedding cake is the perfect example
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.350]  of something like that,
[01:33:58.350 --> 01:34:02.510]  that works great as a receiver and not so great as a donor.
[01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:03.630]  But it's a great strain.
[01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:07.830]  It's one of the more popular strains in California,
[01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:10.830]  at least it was, and it's still on the hype too.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.780]  So Peter-
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.700]  And that makes sense because I've never like revert,
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.900]  I never revert.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.500]  Okay.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.620]  What was that, Adam?
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.700]  You never reverse?
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.700]  A wedding cake, yeah,
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.300]  cause I have actually used it in a few crosses,
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.780]  but I've never like used it as a reverse male.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.380]  I've only used it as a receiver.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.820]  So, and I never had any issues
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.100]  and everybody said they had problems with it
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:38.220]  and I was like, I don't know,
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.380]  never seemed to have a problem,
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:44.510]  but that might make sense right there.
[01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:47.550]  Yeah, I mean, certain things get passed on
[01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:49.750]  more on the receiver than on the donor.
[01:34:51.150 --> 01:34:53.830]  You know, I feel like the donor
[01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:56.830]  is gonna pass on the flower time.
[01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.070]  That's one of the known things.
[01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.390]  So, you know, as far as like,
[01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:02.470]  if you're trying to shorten the flower time,
[01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:06.150]  you wanna put a donor with a shorter flowering time on
[01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:07.590]  rather than a longer flowering time.
[01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:09.990]  Those are just apparent, you know,
[01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:12.430]  and it's not on the entire progeny out,
[01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:16.430]  but it's something that could be more broadly selected for
[01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:17.470]  by doing it that way.
[01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.870]  Okay, so.
[01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:22.190]  So Peter, you got a question?
[01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.030]  Yeah, so.
[01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.470]  And shirts too, I used to.
[01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.310]  Go ahead.
[01:35:27.630 --> 01:35:28.470]  Go ahead.
[01:35:31.230 --> 01:35:33.710]  So Benjamin had two questions.
[01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.630]  How does James and Adam fix traits in lines
[01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.230]  without gaining inbreeding depression?
[01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:43.230]  And then what is James view on searching large populations
[01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:45.550]  for the recombinants and how important is it
[01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:47.350]  for the future of cannabis breeding?
[01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:53.570]  Well, so repeat the question.
[01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:57.170]  You're kind of buzzing in and out on my phone on the line.
[01:35:57.170 --> 01:36:00.050]  So the first one was,
[01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:02.650]  how does James and Adam fix traits in lines
[01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:05.730]  without gaining inbreeding depression?
[01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:08.650]  And then the second one is views on searching
[01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:12.290]  large populations for the quote recombinants
[01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:15.330]  and how important is it for the future of cannabis breeding?
[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:21.010]  Well, so let's talk about genetic depressions first.
[01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:24.250]  I feel like that's something as you're breeding lines,
[01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:26.850]  there's a couple of different approaches you can take
[01:36:26.850 --> 01:36:28.690]  to increase the atrocious.
[01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:31.490]  So, you know, I think one way you can do is
[01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:33.930]  you can start with two lines that are very similar
[01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:37.650]  using the same parents, breeding towards similar goals.
[01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.690]  And then you breed those stability, you know,
[01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:42.930]  it's seven to however many generations
[01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.210]  it takes you to get there.
[01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:47.170]  And then you can cross those back into each other
[01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.530]  to increase atrocious.
[01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:50.330]  Atrocious is hybrid vigor.
[01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:53.090]  Now the other approach to do it with an inbred line
[01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:55.850]  and what the inbred line is doing for those of you
[01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:58.290]  that aren't aware is by crossing the plant back
[01:36:58.290 --> 01:37:00.410]  in through several generations,
[01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:04.850]  you are creating less phenotypical variation.
[01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:06.010]  It's zygosity.
[01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:08.250]  So heterozygosity, homozygosity,
[01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:10.810]  you're breeding for homozygosity
[01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:14.050]  and that would be less phenotypical variation.
[01:37:14.050 --> 01:37:19.050]  And so when you're talking about large scale ag or whatever,
[01:37:19.290 --> 01:37:21.570]  if you want to breed scale stable lines,
[01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:26.330]  you want that inbred line that has less phenotypical
[01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:29.450]  variation so you can control your crop better.
[01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:31.610]  Now, the other approach to doing that is,
[01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:34.290]  is breeding your stable line and then crossing that back
[01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:36.050]  with the original F1.
[01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:38.810]  And what that does by crossing it back to the F1
[01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:42.490]  is it increases heterosis with less phenotypical variation.
[01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:44.730]  There still will be some phenotypical variation
[01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:47.330]  in my experience, but I feel like there will be less
[01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:50.130]  phenotypical variation and you have the heterosis,
[01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:53.370]  which is the hybrid vigor that everybody's looking for.
[01:37:53.370 --> 01:37:54.570]  You know, and that's one of the problems
[01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:58.890]  with these real stable lines is the lack
[01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.730]  of hybrid vigor.
[01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:03.330]  And so, yeah.
[01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:04.170]  And as far as-
[01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:05.490]  It's almost like doing purebred.
[01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:07.730]  It's like, I was gonna say,
[01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:10.010]  it's a little bit like purebred line of dogs, right?
[01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.050]  Like you want it, but you don't really want it.
[01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.890]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:16.890]  So at the end of the day, a lot of times people
[01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:20.090]  are seeking this completely stable line,
[01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:21.890]  but unless you're doing ag and you're growing
[01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:25.010]  10,000 plants at a time and you really have to meet quotas
[01:38:25.010 --> 01:38:26.570]  and things like that, you probably don't want it.
[01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:29.370]  That's what, in my opinion, that is kind of my
[01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.650]  sort of opinion on most of the breeding projects
[01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:32.650]  that are out there.
[01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:35.690]  So at the end of the day, yes, it's a,
[01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:36.690]  you nailed it, obviously.
[01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:39.650]  I'm not gonna add too much more to your description
[01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:44.650]  because the idea of IDLs to be stable like that,
[01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:46.610]  you have to go through the same,
[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:49.730]  you have to go through the exact process
[01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:51.490]  that James was describing and you have to go
[01:38:51.490 --> 01:38:52.930]  six, seven generations.
[01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:54.410]  And there's really no way around that.
[01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:56.210]  You can't work around it.
[01:38:56.850 --> 01:38:58.690]  So that's my two cents.
[01:38:59.530 --> 01:39:01.530]  Yeah, and they say seven generations.
[01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:03.770]  And the thing is, is breeding seven generations
[01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:07.610]  is that that's the starting point for your inbred line
[01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:12.170]  to where it can be stable as far as hetero or homozygosity.
[01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:15.210]  But as far as like, if you're not using analytics,
[01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:17.250]  it can be several generations more than that.
[01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.250]  It's not, you know, and I feel like, you know,
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:22.730]  us doing it by hand for all these years,
[01:39:22.730 --> 01:39:25.570]  a lot of, you know, great breeders have had problems
[01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:28.570]  with their stuff in F5, F6, and F7.
[01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:31.170]  The problems are just expressing in those generations,
[01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:34.250]  but it was actually in that third or fourth generation
[01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:36.210]  where they need to go back to the drawing board
[01:39:36.210 --> 01:39:39.010]  on that generation and start breeding from that point.
[01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:42.330]  But now with analytics, we can do a lot of stuff differently.
[01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:46.010]  And the other thing that I wanna mention is,
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:48.330]  so if you're making feminized seeds in your cell,
[01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:52.170]  so S1s, S2s, and what that cell thing does
[01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:55.090]  is it erases 50% of the alleles.
[01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:57.570]  And so you're breeding, you're putting something on itself.
[01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:00.450]  You're using the genetics on one parent on itself.
[01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:02.170]  You're erasing 50% of the alleles.
[01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:05.050]  So using that process, you can get towards the goals
[01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:05.970]  that you're looking for.
[01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:07.650]  And if you're using something
[01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:10.850]  that has very little intersexual traits,
[01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:12.890]  it's preferred because if you have two plants
[01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:13.810]  that have intersexual traits,
[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:15.210]  you're putting them on each other,
[01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:16.370]  you're gonna have more problems.
[01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:18.090]  So you wanna have something that has
[01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:19.930]  lower intersexual traits if you're stocking.
[01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:23.490]  I think that's really important to talk about.
[01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:29.970]  So kind of some questions and comments
[01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.210]  that I'll bucket together.
[01:40:31.210 --> 01:40:36.210]  Jeremy Moon said, can Adam specify as intersex free plants?
[01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:41.170]  And then Benjamin said, most likely intersex is polygenic
[01:40:41.170 --> 01:40:44.650]  and is not a simple single allele.
[01:40:44.650 --> 01:40:47.650]  And then Doc Husaming said,
[01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:49.930]  feminized plants are engineered intersex.
[01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:53.530]  So is there an epigenetic susceptibility being bred in?
[01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:57.730]  And then Shredder said, is there a PCR test for intersex?
[01:40:59.090 --> 01:41:01.250]  So some intersex conversation.
[01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:08.690]  As far as testing, I don't believe there is quite yet.
[01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:10.050]  Depends on who you talk to,
[01:41:10.050 --> 01:41:12.130]  but I don't believe there is right now.
[01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:16.130]  I think, but there was one question before all this
[01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:18.250]  that we can kind of dive into too
[01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:20.090]  about like larger populations
[01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:22.610]  and why you would wanna breed for
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:25.970]  and what you'd be looking for as far as larger populations.
[01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:30.130]  And using 20,000 as an example,
[01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:33.930]  my friend Short Brooks uses extremely large populations
[01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:36.850]  for his, and it's also Adam's friend
[01:41:36.850 --> 01:41:38.170]  and Marlon's friend as well.
[01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:40.130]  And I think James knows Short as well.
[01:41:40.130 --> 01:41:44.010]  But Short uses extremely large populations
[01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:47.690]  to do his phenoselections and phenohunting.
[01:41:47.690 --> 01:41:51.330]  And what he's looking for is those outliers that are unique.
[01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:54.730]  He's looking for stuff that's really different
[01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:56.450]  when he's using large scale.
[01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:59.770]  You don't necessarily need to use that large of a progeny,
[01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:04.570]  20,000, 10,000, you can use something smaller
[01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:06.730]  if you're doing some sort of inbred line.
[01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:07.690]  If you're going towards that,
[01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:09.770]  you can use something significantly smaller.
[01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:11.290]  But if you're looking for those outliers,
[01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:13.610]  the larger population, the better odds you have
[01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:15.850]  of finding those unique outliers,
[01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:18.810]  that those unicorns per se,
[01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:23.410]  I think that's why you'd wanna use a larger population.
[01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:28.610]  So as far as intersex traits,
[01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:31.490]  you wanna touch on any of those questions, Adam,
[01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:33.290]  or anybody else?
[01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:44.330]  Yeah, for me, it's been,
[01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:48.130]  the struggle has been pretty much to keep the lines
[01:42:48.130 --> 01:42:49.890]  that I brought over from Europe,
[01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:54.290]  even keeping them kind of going.
[01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:55.250]  And it's been like,
[01:42:58.530 --> 01:43:01.610]  most of the work that I've seen come,
[01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:06.610]  it's just too many polyhybrids that are closely related,
[01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:09.690]  and you end up with kind of bottle decking.
[01:43:09.690 --> 01:43:12.930]  And so for the most part, I've just been,
[01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:19.090]  yeah, keeping all the lines apart as far as I can.
[01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:24.290]  And trying to keep my P1s that I work with.
[01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:29.250]  What's that?
[01:43:30.210 --> 01:43:31.890]  Are there specific strains that you work with
[01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:33.210]  that you wanna share
[01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:35.410]  that are extremely stable in your opinion?
[01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:42.570]  As far as what I've got right now here
[01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:45.970]  that I could bring from Europe, yeah.
[01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:47.330]  Or that you've worked with?
[01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:49.050]  The bubble gum that I have,
[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:51.610]  I mean, the bubble gum is probably the long,
[01:43:51.610 --> 01:43:56.610]  is the only IBL that I can really account to
[01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:58.490]  on my own sort of work.
[01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:02.050]  The rest of it's all been kind of hanging on
[01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:03.490]  to what I've got more or less.
[01:44:03.490 --> 01:44:06.450]  But the bubble gum is what I got to work with
[01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:09.570]  in the beginning, starting in Europe.
[01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:11.090]  And then when I got it back,
[01:44:13.690 --> 01:44:16.450]  there was a lot of still instabilities,
[01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:17.930]  and I could actually work on that one
[01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:21.010]  for five generations on that.
[01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:23.730]  And then that actually, to this point,
[01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:27.530]  I think is the one that I can work independently with
[01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:30.730]  and get the most stable results from.
[01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:36.090]  So real quick, could you just touch on the Indiana bubble gum
[01:44:36.090 --> 01:44:37.130]  and the kind of origins of it?
[01:44:37.130 --> 01:44:39.650]  Because I know there's a lot of questions
[01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:42.810]  surrounding the actual origins of Indiana bubble gum
[01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:43.650]  in your story.
[01:44:43.650 --> 01:44:45.890]  And I feel like you're such a big part of that story.
[01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:47.890]  It'd be great to kind of talk about it on the show.
[01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:50.130]  So I think if Adam does that,
[01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:52.730]  I think you need to tell us the 7-8 Sour story.
[01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:56.130]  Oh, the 7-8 Sour, sure.
[01:44:56.130 --> 01:44:57.570]  I'll talk about that all day.
[01:44:57.570 --> 01:44:58.410]  7-8 Sour-
[01:44:58.410 --> 01:45:00.250]  Here's a service for protection.
[01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:04.690]  If you want to talk about 7-8 Sour, it's a great story.
[01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:07.890]  You know, it was the original BX of the Sour Diesel.
[01:45:07.890 --> 01:45:09.850]  I think there's several companies now
[01:45:09.850 --> 01:45:14.330]  that have the BX Sour, BX2s, BX3s.
[01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:19.330]  But what happened was the original was Sour Diesel
[01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:21.010]  and Spicy Jack.
[01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:23.650]  And those were accidentally crossed together
[01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:24.890]  to make the original Loud.
[01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:27.330]  And the original Loud was a really popular strain
[01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:33.290]  in Oakland and San Francisco, you know, 12 plus years ago.
[01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:37.050]  And so we got the idea that we could breed
[01:45:37.050 --> 01:45:38.130]  towards the Sour.
[01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:41.050]  And my partner and I were like,
[01:45:41.050 --> 01:45:43.850]  he was convinced that we could get a Sour Diesel
[01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:49.130]  by basically BXing, cubing the Sour with the Spicy Jack.
[01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:53.570]  The problem with that is, is that Spicy Jack,
[01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:57.090]  although it's not super strong in the terpenoline limonene,
[01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:59.290]  like the traditional Jack Herrera,
[01:46:00.610 --> 01:46:03.730]  everything in the progeny had a lot of that lemon in it.
[01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:06.530]  So each time we back-crossed it, you know,
[01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:08.570]  it was originally, the original back-crossed
[01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:11.570]  so was three-fourths, you know,
[01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:14.130]  three-fourths of the genetics of the Sour.
[01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:16.130]  So it was, each time we crossed it,
[01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:18.210]  seven-eighths was the next one.
[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:19.970]  And then, you know, we were going to do the next one
[01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:23.530]  would be the 15-16ths breeding towards the Sour.
[01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:26.730]  But the project was really abandoned on that 15-16ths
[01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:30.130]  when the majority of the progeny still had the lemon
[01:46:30.130 --> 01:46:32.330]  and it wasn't where we were looking to go
[01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.970]  with the Sour Diesel, you know, as far as in a seed form.
[01:46:35.970 --> 01:46:37.210]  You know, we did some other stuff
[01:46:37.210 --> 01:46:40.730]  with some European genetics,
[01:46:40.730 --> 01:46:43.010]  working with some guys out there
[01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:45.730]  for making Sour Diesel, you know, in seed form.
[01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:47.770]  And, you know, I'm not too happy about any of that.
[01:46:47.770 --> 01:46:49.570]  We can talk about that on another episode,
[01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:52.130]  but, you know, the renaming of strains,
[01:46:52.130 --> 01:46:54.630]  people saying they have a Sour Diesel seed,
[01:46:56.530 --> 01:46:57.850]  nobody has a Sour Diesel seed.
[01:46:57.850 --> 01:47:00.250]  And, you know, Mojave and I talked about that last week.
[01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:03.130]  There are no Sour Diesel seeds because there was one
[01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:05.130]  and then, you know, Sour Diesel is bred into other stuff.
[01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:08.610]  I'd much prefer if breeders would rename their stuff,
[01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:10.430]  if they're going to cross it with something else,
[01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:12.430]  even if they feel like it's a good representation
[01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:14.470]  of that strain, it shouldn't be called Sour Diesel.
[01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:16.950]  It shouldn't be called Girl Scout Cookies.
[01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:19.390]  You know, those are clone only varieties.
[01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:22.870]  So I'll let Adam talk a little bit about the bubble gum.
[01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:24.510]  Unless you have questions, James.
[01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:27.390]  Not at all.
[01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:28.710]  I think that's awesome.
[01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:29.790]  And I definitely agree with you.
[01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:33.110]  I think the whole renaming of, or, you know,
[01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:36.670]  mislabeling or misrepresentation of genetics is bad
[01:47:36.670 --> 01:47:37.790]  and shouldn't be put up with, you know,
[01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:40.150]  it's like, it needs to be, you know,
[01:47:40.150 --> 01:47:42.270]  so-and-so's Girl Scout Cookie or something.
[01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:44.270]  If they want to do it or use that nameplate,
[01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:46.830]  then you can at least put your breed in it before,
[01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:49.670]  but it's hard to just put out like a Sour Diesel,
[01:47:49.670 --> 01:47:51.470]  Sour Diesel, because yeah, it doesn't exist, you know,
[01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:54.710]  but, you know, I wish they would put their brand
[01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:55.550]  ahead of it.
[01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:59.950]  Yeah, it's been, I mean, yeah, I mean, the name game,
[01:47:59.950 --> 01:48:01.830]  we know that goes in circles, of course,
[01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:03.910]  because it's like, there's always going to be a new guy
[01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.950]  that jumps on the market and it just starts taking
[01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:08.350]  people's names and running with it.
[01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:11.870]  Bubblegum was, yeah, the whole backstory on that,
[01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:14.590]  as far as the Indiana part of it,
[01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:19.470]  it's interesting because it was a situation
[01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:24.350]  where I put out information,
[01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:26.590]  thinking I was putting out the right information.
[01:48:26.590 --> 01:48:31.590]  It became sort of, you know, that was the lineage
[01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:37.190]  starting point, and then I found out 20 plus years later,
[01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:39.590]  I'd have to say at least, it was probably what,
[01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:42.310]  24 years later or something, that it all came together.
[01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:43.150]  Like, what?
[01:48:43.150 --> 01:48:44.790]  And you said, what?
[01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:47.030]  And so all it was, was, so Victor,
[01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:53.950]  so Victor, who ran the gray area,
[01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:56.950]  is the guy who gave me the seeds to do my first
[01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:59.270]  initial selection for Bubblegum from, right?
[01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:02.950]  And he brought 135 seeds from America to Amsterdam.
[01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:04.630]  And he lived with me at my apartment.
[01:49:04.630 --> 01:49:07.510]  And at that time I worked at Sensi Seeds,
[01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:08.950]  so I really didn't need seeds,
[01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:12.350]  and I wasn't interested in seeds he brought
[01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:14.870]  because I thought, you know, I worked at Sensi,
[01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:16.150]  there was no point.
[01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:19.150]  And at one point we grew out the seeds
[01:49:19.150 --> 01:49:22.710]  and I was doing the pre-selection,
[01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:27.710]  and he had told me that he got these from a guy in Indiana,
[01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:32.750]  or he was from Indiana, but he lived in New England, right?
[01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:35.710]  And so I was like, okay, so I wrote that into the story
[01:49:35.710 --> 01:49:37.470]  as we put out the seeds, like, okay,
[01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:40.830]  from Indiana to New England, et cetera.
[01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:45.830]  And like I said, like 22 years later,
[01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:50.350]  I'm talking to Victor about it,
[01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:51.870]  and he's telling me like,
[01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:55.710]  because he had left town, right, Victor,
[01:49:55.710 --> 01:50:00.110]  the backstory to this is that Victor left Amsterdam
[01:50:00.110 --> 01:50:02.550]  before the bubblegum even, I mean, it was popular,
[01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:04.790]  but it hadn't become out in seed form yet,
[01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:06.190]  and he had left town,
[01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:09.150]  and I hadn't seen him for that 20 year gap.
[01:50:09.150 --> 01:50:10.790]  And then when I was talking to him,
[01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:13.310]  he tells me that the bubblegum seeds
[01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:15.310]  come from a guy from Illinois.
[01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:16.670]  And I was like, oh shit,
[01:50:16.670 --> 01:50:19.310]  so I've been telling people Indiana this whole time.
[01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:22.190]  And Indiana bubblegum became popular
[01:50:23.190 --> 01:50:25.910]  after I put out the bubblegum.
[01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:28.110]  So it was one of those situations where I know,
[01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:29.430]  and I know the group,
[01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:32.990]  they grew a strain called Naked Lady,
[01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:37.710]  and it was also popular in Indiana at that time.
[01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:39.630]  They also put out the bubblegum,
[01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:42.270]  and it became popular.
[01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:45.630]  And then if you grow it now, like, it's amazing.
[01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:50.630]  I've gotten Indiana bubblegum cut,
[01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:54.750]  and it's identical, you know what I mean?
[01:50:54.750 --> 01:50:58.390]  It's like, it's one of those cut and dry sort of situations
[01:50:58.390 --> 01:51:00.190]  where you're like, wow, this is the same thing.
[01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:03.430]  But I'll leave it,
[01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:05.350]  I'll leave Indiana bubblegum the way it is,
[01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:06.430]  because it is where it is.
[01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:07.950]  But to be quite honest,
[01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:09.310]  it's actually from Illinois originally.
[01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:10.710]  So there you go, that's the backstory,
[01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:12.110]  that's the secret backstory.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.120]  Sorry, James, you were muted.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.800]  Hold on, let me unmute your phone.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.000]  Oh, no, I'm unmuted.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:24.840]  I just wanted to think,
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.840]  isn't there another twist to that story?
[01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:30.670]  As far as which part?
[01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:34.070]  As far as it might be from Seattle?
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.720]  No, no, well, no.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.320]  Where'd you get that part?
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.320]  No, no, that's another story of another thing.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.960]  The Gordon's you're talking about,
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.400]  that's a Gordon story.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.640]  That's a different story.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.680]  That's a deeper chapter of another story.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:01.320]  Related though, highly related though, highly related.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.480]  No, no, don't.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.080]  Oh, wait, sorry.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.600]  Hi there, James, hold on a second.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.600]  You should be able to unmute yourself on the phone
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.000]  if you just tap the button.
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.740]  I can, I'm gonna try to do it.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.820]  Everyone's gone.
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:28.860]  Let's see.
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.380]  I'm gonna try and get high.
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:33.380]  James is on.
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:35.620]  No, he's on.
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.900]  He's not muted.
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:38.780]  There we go, now, there we go.
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.060]  Perfect.
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.660]  Okay, guys, we're gonna wrap it up for the evening
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.500]  and I really appreciate it for the evening.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.940]  But for the day, I guess it's evening over in Amsterdam
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:50.900]  and Spain for all our friends over there
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:53.700]  and all around the world.
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:56.460]  Let's see, next week we got TGAC's reunion,
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:59.260]  which I think is gonna be a lot of fun and interesting.
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:00.460]  We got a-
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:01.300]  So who's on that?
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.140]  Who's on that?
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.740]  Wow.
[01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:05.940]  That's gonna be on this show next week at 11.
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.980]  So tune in for that.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:07.820]  So we got everybody.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:11.340]  We got Jill, we got Sonny, we got Odi, we got Pat,
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:15.300]  and we got Jinx coming on and it should be a lot of fun.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:17.580]  So tune in next week if you're interested for that.
[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:19.420]  Marlon, I really wanna thank you for coming on.
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.660]  Adam and James, good times.
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:22.500]  Thanks, Adam.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:24.460]  Always a pleasure.
[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:25.300]  Thanks, guys.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.780]  You guys have a blessed evening.
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:29.620]  And Jessica.
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.540]  Thanks, Peter.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.220]  That's a tight shot right there.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:35.460]  And at six o'clock Pacific time tonight,
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:39.780]  we have Ivan Ruiz and then Chris,
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:42.500]  who's the chief science officer of Front Range.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:47.500]  And then Saul, who is an IPM expert talking IPM,
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:54.740]  molecular pathology, tissue culture, HPLVD,
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:56.700]  greenhouses, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:00.220]  So James, thank you.
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:03.220]  And with that, we will kill the live stream.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.860]  And thanks everyone for watching.
