[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  Mad at me for not saying yesterday.
[00:03.460 --> 00:05.000]  So all right.
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.040]  We are live. Welcome, everyone.
[00:07.040 --> 00:08.760]  Take it away, Brian.
[00:08.760 --> 00:10.260]  Yeah. Good morning, Living Soil nerds.
[00:10.260 --> 00:11.840]  Happy Thursday to you.
[00:11.840 --> 00:14.920]  Quick shout out to Layton and Peter, as always on Thursdays.
[00:14.920 --> 00:18.140]  Just appreciate everybody's time and effort.
[00:18.140 --> 00:20.300]  All right. So sticky lungs and I,
[00:21.340 --> 00:25.520]  we go back and, you know, because of kind of the way it did start the show.
[00:25.680 --> 00:27.900]  I've never had an issue with this guy whatsoever.
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.560]  I feel like he's always coming with everybody in the industry with respect.
[00:32.020 --> 00:33.800]  Nothing but love the entire time.
[00:33.800 --> 00:36.680]  Unless somebody puts shade on him or something like that.
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.520]  And I feel like especially maybe as a southerner, we take that shit
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.140]  more personal than others.
[00:41.140 --> 00:44.440]  But our pride in the way that we carry ourselves is really all we have,
[00:44.440 --> 00:46.100]  especially back in the day.
[00:46.100 --> 00:49.360]  That was how you kind of had your business card, if you words,
[00:49.360 --> 00:51.320]  because other people had to vouch for you.
[00:51.320 --> 00:53.480]  And if you didn't have that, you weren't going to be anything,
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.280]  especially as a white boy in Atlanta.
[00:55.300 --> 00:57.380]  It was really hard to get shit done over there
[00:57.380 --> 00:59.960]  until you started to have some kind of now they call clouds
[00:59.960 --> 01:04.180]  or some kind of character to you that people would represent and vouch for.
[01:04.560 --> 01:08.260]  So I feel like you guys are in for a treat today because sticking
[01:08.260 --> 01:11.840]  I kind of in some ways grew up in a lot of that same environment.
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.900]  We saw a lot of the same things.
[01:13.900 --> 01:16.640]  There's a special place, even in Atlanta, that nobody,
[01:16.820 --> 01:19.400]  especially back in the day, wanted to go to called Cabbage Town.
[01:19.980 --> 01:22.860]  So to share a lot of these stories today, I hope that you guys see
[01:23.860 --> 01:27.040]  that it's fantastic that we have platforms, YouTube, Instagram,
[01:27.040 --> 01:28.960]  where we can share all of this stuff.
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.420]  And you guys don't have to take any kind of risk, really.
[01:31.920 --> 01:35.260]  So hats off to everybody that did this a long time ago.
[01:35.260 --> 01:37.840]  And I feel like we're going to kind of go down memory lane here
[01:37.840 --> 01:40.100]  a little bit with Sticky Lungs.
[01:40.100 --> 01:44.020]  He's I know I probably say this a lot, but you are definitely, again,
[01:44.020 --> 01:46.680]  one of the quiet OG's of the industry.
[01:47.100 --> 01:49.980]  There's going to be a lot of stories and stuff that I feel like
[01:49.980 --> 01:52.820]  and the people that you know and the way that you kind of shape
[01:52.820 --> 01:55.200]  certain things in this street quietly.
[01:55.200 --> 01:57.480]  I consider you a cannabis sommelier.
[01:57.480 --> 02:01.520]  I feel like you are somebody that just understands genetics at another level.
[02:02.660 --> 02:06.080]  You know, proof of that is that you started the Home Growers Cup.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.200]  We're going to get into that, obviously, deeper.
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.160]  But I wanted the audience to know that, you know, behind the scenes, man,
[02:12.160 --> 02:17.580]  you are really, in my opinion, one of the top sommelier type individuals
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.180]  that not only understands breeding, understands genetics.
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.560]  And I'm excited to be able to share all of that knowledge with our audience today,
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.480]  man, because it's something that I feel like the true and tried genetics
[02:28.820 --> 02:31.940]  and the not watered down
[02:31.940 --> 02:35.900]  beans that I feel like a lot of people right now are kind of maybe running after
[02:35.900 --> 02:39.540]  or their buddy tells them that it's great and they don't really do their own research.
[02:39.540 --> 02:42.660]  And that's something that I love about you, man, is because you you always speak
[02:42.660 --> 02:46.120]  your mind. So again, I appreciate everything that you did.
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.420]  I appreciate what you what you did this morning for me.
[02:49.880 --> 02:53.540]  And let's kick it off with kind of talking about where I personally felt
[02:53.540 --> 02:55.960]  like we started to learn things back in the day was overgrow.
[02:57.460 --> 02:59.560]  Absolutely. Overgrow.
[03:01.260 --> 03:05.720]  Around 2000 is when I joined overgrowth and I think I was 16,
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.940]  so I lied about my age and all that stuff just to get the approval to get online.
[03:11.280 --> 03:14.780]  I was at my parents house as a 16 year old, just overgrowing all day,
[03:14.780 --> 03:16.480]  and they'd pop up in my room. What are you doing?
[03:16.780 --> 03:20.400]  I'd have to delete my browser history every 30 minutes, it seemed like.
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.240]  So they didn't know that I was smoking weed or growing weed or whatever it was
[03:24.240 --> 03:25.160]  I was doing at the time.
[03:26.160 --> 03:30.280]  But you could ask questions on overgrow and get the most ridiculous
[03:30.660 --> 03:33.880]  answers from people who were just like not trying to help you.
[03:34.460 --> 03:38.040]  And then somebody might call you aside and be like, hey, this is how you do it.
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.640]  So I was lucky enough to kind of meet some influential people on overgrow.
[03:44.420 --> 03:47.620]  And unbeknownst to me, I had no clue.
[03:47.620 --> 03:50.620]  So cool. And Jill, Miss Jill were pretty big on overgrow.
[03:50.620 --> 03:51.880]  I just saw their pictures.
[03:53.120 --> 03:57.880]  So I think when I was like 18, I sent Miss Jill a message or maybe 19.
[03:59.180 --> 04:01.640]  And said, I like that orange velvet you have.
[04:01.940 --> 04:02.980]  Are there any seeds of it?
[04:02.980 --> 04:04.520]  You know, I didn't know it was a clone only.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.260]  I didn't know what clone only's were at the time.
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.400]  So she says, no, it's clone only.
[04:09.400 --> 04:11.360]  But where are you in the United States?
[04:11.360 --> 04:13.000]  I said, I'm in Georgia.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.880]  And that kind of tipped it off for her because I think so.
[04:16.880 --> 04:19.640]  Spend a lot of time in the South.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.580]  But let's see.
[04:21.580 --> 04:25.340]  She tells me when I get to Oregon, because I told her I was moving to Oregon.
[04:25.840 --> 04:28.120]  She says, when you get to Oregon, hit us up.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.060]  So about eight months pass.
[04:30.060 --> 04:34.400]  I drop them a line and then I meet up with these people on overgrow.
[04:34.820 --> 04:37.020]  You know that I didn't know.
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.160]  Were big seed breeders or influential people in the cannabis industry
[04:41.160 --> 04:43.340]  in the Pacific Northwest or anything.
[04:43.340 --> 04:44.600]  I just saw they had some heady weed.
[04:44.600 --> 04:46.560]  I wanted to get on that train.
[04:48.540 --> 04:54.240]  So I ended up meeting up with Subcool in like 2005, early 2006
[04:54.900 --> 05:00.020]  and Miss Jill and went up to their place in Oregon.
[05:00.380 --> 05:03.180]  And it's kind of a funny story.
[05:03.580 --> 05:05.980]  When I met Sub, we didn't know what each other looked like.
[05:06.260 --> 05:09.000]  So I just told him I was a skinny white dude with long hair.
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.260]  And he sees me parked next to him, he just gives me the nod, like get in the car.
[05:13.300 --> 05:15.240]  So I got in the car.
[05:15.240 --> 05:18.980]  And he's like, well, Jill wanted me to blindfold you,
[05:18.980 --> 05:22.140]  but I don't think that's necessary.
[05:22.780 --> 05:26.340]  So I went to Sub's house for a while, and that's when I was introduced
[05:26.340 --> 05:30.020]  to back to back to back bubble hash bowls,
[05:30.020 --> 05:32.780]  which was a complete delicacy for me at the time.
[05:34.960 --> 05:38.400]  Around 2006, not many people had good bubble hash back then.
[05:39.620 --> 05:43.200]  I don't think people realize, buddy, how hard it was to get anything good
[05:43.200 --> 05:46.300]  growing up in Georgia, especially at the time when we were teenagers
[05:46.300 --> 05:50.100]  and maybe early adults consistently outside of Atlanta.
[05:50.740 --> 05:52.580]  Well, that was that was the game, right?
[05:52.580 --> 05:55.940]  Is if you could find your plug in Atlanta, you could run the streets. But
[05:58.240 --> 06:00.240]  luckily, I was I was good enough
[06:00.640 --> 06:05.520]  as far as my business acumen to find this one guy on the campus
[06:05.540 --> 06:07.280]  who had really good weed.
[06:07.280 --> 06:10.220]  And I could tell right away when I started smoking, there was a difference.
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.180]  Not all weed was created equally.
[06:14.220 --> 06:16.360]  But I found this one guy named Bernie.
[06:16.360 --> 06:18.220]  Shout out, Bernie. I know you're not listening.
[06:20.400 --> 06:23.200]  But he had the best weed
[06:23.600 --> 06:26.300]  in southern Georgia from what I knew.
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.840]  So he moved back to Atlanta and I kept in contact with him.
[06:32.040 --> 06:35.300]  Just kind of did my thing slowly, slowly until I moved out to Oregon.
[06:35.320 --> 06:38.420]  Like I said, met up with Subcool and Jill.
[06:39.460 --> 06:42.560]  They gave me some clones, I gave them some clones.
[06:43.260 --> 06:45.500]  He taught me some things about organics,
[06:46.500 --> 06:49.860]  you know, amongst other things. But.
[06:49.860 --> 06:52.800]  Yeah, it was really hard to get good weed back in the South consistently.
[06:52.800 --> 06:56.940]  When you found that plug, you stayed in contact with that gentleman
[06:56.940 --> 07:00.120]  or that woman or whoever it was as best as you could.
[07:00.740 --> 07:04.080]  Yeah, I almost feel like, you know, you would definitely try to have
[07:04.080 --> 07:07.920]  your octopus kind of style where you'd have different tentacles.
[07:07.920 --> 07:10.440]  But at the end of the day, you would hope that you'd have at least one or two
[07:10.440 --> 07:12.920]  that were feeding your family.
[07:12.920 --> 07:14.760]  And I feel like especially back then, a lot of those people
[07:14.760 --> 07:17.520]  on the other side of things, like if they knew that you were coming correct,
[07:17.520 --> 07:20.420]  not trying to rip them off, hopefully it would reciprocate
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.720]  and they would bring that back.
[07:21.720 --> 07:25.160]  And then there would be that bond that I feel like is really lost today, too.
[07:25.160 --> 07:28.100]  When two grown men are feeding each other's family,
[07:28.500 --> 07:31.820]  two grown men are feeding each other's families, especially in the South.
[07:32.580 --> 07:34.940]  It was really hard to just get any kind of connection
[07:34.940 --> 07:37.660]  where you would have, at least in my peer group, I guess,
[07:38.180 --> 07:39.940]  where you could get anything consistent.
[07:39.940 --> 07:43.220]  So you'd have fantastic stuff, maybe a couple of months, somebody get in trouble.
[07:43.500 --> 07:47.340]  Now you have to go back to this other guy and he's got like the bricks.
[07:47.620 --> 07:49.780]  So nobody wants really to fuck with you.
[07:49.780 --> 07:52.140]  And now you're kind of sitting here with a cute pea of nothing.
[07:52.740 --> 07:55.180]  In my opinion, you know, I mean, it's really hard to get rid of
[07:55.580 --> 07:58.340]  really bad weed even back then.
[07:58.340 --> 08:01.860]  And to be honest, after 9-11 happened when I was living in Valdosta, Georgia,
[08:01.860 --> 08:04.180]  it took about a year for us to get anything
[08:05.020 --> 08:09.060]  other than just seeds and stems, really headaches.
[08:09.740 --> 08:12.780]  Yeah, I remember some kids, believe it or not, trying to smoke
[08:12.780 --> 08:16.780]  some banana peels during the drought of 2001, 2002.
[08:19.500 --> 08:21.900]  Yeah, so that it was pretty brutal back then.
[08:22.700 --> 08:24.620]  I remember that shit.
[08:24.620 --> 08:27.180]  You remember the banana peels?
[08:27.260 --> 08:29.300]  Or just the drought?
[08:29.900 --> 08:33.660]  Yeah, and peanut butter banana peels was this thing is like,
[08:33.660 --> 08:35.780]  what is wrong with you people?
[08:35.780 --> 08:37.540]  I never gave into that.
[08:37.540 --> 08:39.500]  But yeah, and the sticks.
[08:41.300 --> 08:44.500]  Yeah, sticks and seeds and headache, headache fucking central.
[08:45.380 --> 08:49.020]  Yeah, it was it was tough going back then in the day, for sure.
[08:49.460 --> 08:50.980]  We had a similar thing in New England.
[08:51.540 --> 08:56.580]  You get it all, we'd get some good stuff and then that was it.
[08:56.580 --> 08:59.420]  And then we were scraping our friggin pipes and our bongs off.
[08:59.420 --> 09:01.300]  We're going to win along after that went away.
[09:03.300 --> 09:06.820]  I know on several occasions I bought weed back from people I sold it to.
[09:09.700 --> 09:13.260]  I was like, we were kind of talking about this yesterday, too,
[09:13.260 --> 09:17.460]  on the East Coast, there's I-95 and that runs all the way from Florida to New York.
[09:17.780 --> 09:20.820]  And if you grew up on the East Coast, I feel like if you ever did
[09:21.180 --> 09:25.100]  anything cowboy-esque, you know all about that highway.
[09:25.660 --> 09:28.340]  And one of the main things that seemed to travel across that highway
[09:28.340 --> 09:30.180]  was something that a lot of us found.
[09:30.180 --> 09:32.740]  And once you did find when you're talking about trying to keep it,
[09:33.020 --> 09:35.420]  was this thing known as Krippi, Krippi with a K.
[09:36.060 --> 09:38.820]  So let's kind of talk about that, because that's something that I felt like
[09:38.820 --> 09:42.660]  on the East Coast took over by storm because it was the first time
[09:42.660 --> 09:45.940]  I've ever really seen whoever was really pumping that stuff out
[09:45.940 --> 09:50.060]  where it was consistent for years on end, not somebody on the East Coast
[09:50.060 --> 09:52.180]  that maybe had a plug somewhere else and was able to.
[09:52.660 --> 09:56.340]  It seemed like, you know, six months at best for for Atlanta
[09:56.340 --> 09:59.860]  and somebody else would have to pop up with not as good quality.
[09:59.860 --> 10:00.580]  It always seemed like.
[10:01.860 --> 10:04.940]  Yeah, and the whole Krippi thing, I think, from my understanding,
[10:04.940 --> 10:10.100]  started in around Florida, and it was just a term for the good weed
[10:10.100 --> 10:13.140]  after it became a name strain.
[10:13.140 --> 10:14.620]  So it was a name strain first.
[10:14.620 --> 10:18.500]  It became a term for good weed, and then it became like a bastardized term
[10:18.500 --> 10:20.180]  just for good weed.
[10:20.180 --> 10:26.020]  And that's probably about the time I encountered it was 2000, 2001.
[10:26.580 --> 10:30.740]  I went to Florida Fernandina Beach and met some kids down there.
[10:30.740 --> 10:32.660]  And I said, Hey, man, you know, we're getting any green.
[10:32.660 --> 10:33.820]  And he goes, Oh, some reefer.
[10:35.140 --> 10:37.500]  And I just kind of looked at him like, yeah, some reefer.
[10:37.940 --> 10:41.580]  And he goes, this guy will come through in about 30 minutes with some weed.
[10:41.580 --> 10:43.660]  And this this dude came through some weed.
[10:43.740 --> 10:44.980]  He said some Krippi.
[10:44.980 --> 10:46.340]  It's got some seeds in it, though.
[10:46.340 --> 10:47.660]  So it was only 80 a quarter.
[10:47.660 --> 10:48.740]  I was like, I'll buy it.
[10:48.740 --> 10:52.620]  I like seeds because I've been sprouting seeds ever since my first bag of weed.
[10:52.620 --> 10:54.620]  I got the head seeds in it.
[10:54.620 --> 10:58.980]  I was like, you mean I don't have to go meet this shady individual downtown?
[10:58.980 --> 11:01.020]  I can just grow this weed in my backyard.
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.420]  I'm going to try that.
[11:03.420 --> 11:08.100]  So I got this Krippi, brought it back from Fernandina Beach,
[11:08.580 --> 11:11.100]  planted it in my parents' backyard.
[11:11.100 --> 11:14.060]  They were pretty busy with their business, so they didn't really know that.
[11:14.060 --> 11:16.500]  Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Stepdad.
[11:17.180 --> 11:21.100]  That's where I made my bones, though, is in my backyard watching plants die.
[11:25.910 --> 11:27.430]  Sorry, I was muted.
[11:27.430 --> 11:28.470]  Oh, man.
[11:28.470 --> 11:32.030]  And I don't think a lot of people realize the risk that you're taking,
[11:32.590 --> 11:35.870]  like especially not even telling your parents of what could have happened,
[11:36.630 --> 11:38.510]  especially in Georgia, man.
[11:38.510 --> 11:41.910]  Yeah. A lot of people were getting arrested, especially at my high school,
[11:41.950 --> 11:45.110]  just even for seeds and stems if they couldn't find the real bag.
[11:45.950 --> 11:48.870]  You were still getting, you know, minor possession,
[11:48.870 --> 11:50.870]  all that kind of stuff. So
[11:51.910 --> 11:54.870]  Krippi, I felt like was just a way for a lot of us
[11:54.870 --> 11:57.750]  once we were able to have that connect, kind of start to make a little
[11:58.350 --> 12:00.190]  profit for ourselves.
[12:00.190 --> 12:03.470]  That was kind of one of the main ones that seemed like you could.
[12:03.590 --> 12:07.910]  I was growing up in Val, or going to Valdosta State University at the time,
[12:08.190 --> 12:10.990]  and it seemed like you could drop down even to just to Jacksonville.
[12:10.990 --> 12:13.630]  You didn't have to drive to Miami and get that.
[12:13.630 --> 12:17.350]  So that really seemed to just kind of take over Florida and then seem like
[12:18.350 --> 12:21.830]  hopefully some of us were continuing to help it into Georgia
[12:22.310 --> 12:26.270]  because when I was younger, that was the best smoke that I felt consistently
[12:26.270 --> 12:28.830]  that we could get with real numbers behind it.
[12:30.710 --> 12:34.790]  Yeah, I mean, to speak of that, I only got what they call skunkweed
[12:34.830 --> 12:37.110]  three or four times at my age, I'm 37.
[12:37.590 --> 12:41.030]  So I guess people that are a few years older than me are a lot more experienced
[12:41.030 --> 12:45.470]  with it. But I remember distinctly getting skunkweed on three occasions
[12:46.150 --> 12:49.310]  and it still stands out in my mind to this day as some funky, funky.
[12:52.110 --> 12:55.110]  Yeah, again, like with that, someone, yeah, kind of thing.
[12:55.190 --> 12:56.790]  I'm sorry, Leighton. Go ahead.
[12:56.790 --> 12:58.830]  I was just going to share a story on skunk.
[12:58.830 --> 13:01.190]  Yeah, that's that was the stuff that we get involved.
[13:01.750 --> 13:05.470]  And you had to do, you know, crazy stuff to keep it from stinking.
[13:05.470 --> 13:08.030]  I mean, you just no matter how many times you bagged it,
[13:08.910 --> 13:10.510]  it would it would stink.
[13:10.510 --> 13:14.550]  And so you had to be like, keep it outside and in a coffee can
[13:14.990 --> 13:17.790]  buried in leaves so that your parents wouldn't find it.
[13:18.670 --> 13:20.070]  It was wonderful.
[13:20.070 --> 13:21.150]  But it was a problem.
[13:21.150 --> 13:23.310]  It was a real problem to keep around.
[13:23.750 --> 13:27.390]  I remember talking with Kevin Jodrey about it's like, you know,
[13:27.390 --> 13:31.110]  most of those strains got taken
[13:32.110 --> 13:35.670]  or, you know, they got raided because you could smell it
[13:35.670 --> 13:39.750]  for for hundreds of feet away from where the plant was or carrying it.
[13:40.190 --> 13:42.230]  You know, and, you know, it was it was bad.
[13:42.230 --> 13:45.590]  And the cops were really brutal in Massachusetts at the time.
[13:46.030 --> 13:48.870]  So it was like you didn't you loved it, but you didn't want it
[13:48.870 --> 13:50.950]  because it was just too dangerous to have.
[13:52.070 --> 13:54.790]  So there's my share of my story on skunk.
[13:54.790 --> 13:57.630]  We loved it, but but it was just too dangerous to keep around.
[13:59.030 --> 14:01.110]  I had to change my hat when you started talking about that.
[14:01.590 --> 14:04.270]  Oh, yeah. Get that.
[14:04.270 --> 14:05.710]  So let's kind of get into subculture.
[14:05.710 --> 14:09.630]  I know a lot of people for a variety of reasons know that gentleman's name.
[14:10.030 --> 14:12.350]  Definitely one of the pioneers in giving out education.
[14:12.910 --> 14:14.950]  Definitely one of the pioneers of putting out seeds
[14:14.950 --> 14:17.990]  that I felt like a lot of people were rocking with.
[14:17.990 --> 14:21.990]  And then his, you know, super soil recipes and that kind of stuff.
[14:21.990 --> 14:25.070]  I felt like, you know, that's why he's considered almost an old guard
[14:25.070 --> 14:26.990]  with some of the other low and fellows, Dr.
[14:26.990 --> 14:29.590]  Lane Ingham, or at least in my my
[14:30.630 --> 14:33.870]  learning aspect, where these guys were really learning stuff
[14:33.870 --> 14:36.990]  and teaching stuff back in the day and teaching that you can kind of,
[14:37.070 --> 14:40.150]  quote unquote, cook your soil instead of just buying bag soil
[14:40.150 --> 14:41.910]  and mix it in yourself.
[14:41.910 --> 14:44.830]  For me, at least that was some cool taught me all of that stuff.
[14:44.830 --> 14:49.750]  And then kind of progressed to learning more about the book, The Rev.
[14:50.350 --> 14:52.710]  Forget the name. What's the name of that book?
[14:52.710 --> 14:53.350]  Is remember that?
[14:54.430 --> 14:55.830]  The Rev. The Rev.
[14:55.830 --> 14:58.710]  He taught about doing like nutritional spikes and that kind of stuff,
[14:58.710 --> 15:01.790]  and it just wasn't a living soil, but it seemed like things kept improving.
[15:01.790 --> 15:05.270]  So I definitely feel like some cool is a kind of a pioneer on that.
[15:05.510 --> 15:08.910]  And I wanted to kind of since you understand genetics so well,
[15:09.470 --> 15:12.910]  I wanted to get deeper into some of those that are kind of like his bread
[15:12.910 --> 15:16.910]  and butter and his legacy now moving forward.
[15:16.910 --> 15:21.830]  Yeah. Yeah. As far as the strains I know from him, it was all the earlier stuff
[15:21.830 --> 15:28.230]  like anything after the deep purple, I think is what his cork
[15:28.230 --> 15:31.750]  back cross was, which was a result of the lavender I gave him.
[15:32.750 --> 15:34.630]  To the space queen, back to the lavender,
[15:34.630 --> 15:37.070]  we thought it was purple at the time. That's my fault.
[15:38.110 --> 15:43.310]  But I think Jill has since, you know, realized it's probably lavender.
[15:43.670 --> 15:47.910]  But anyways, anything after that, I really am not that familiar with.
[15:47.910 --> 15:52.270]  But the OG stuff of his, the Jack, the Rippers, the Vortex,
[15:53.430 --> 15:57.670]  even the 3D, that one had particularly sandy.
[15:58.790 --> 16:03.270]  Resin qualities, I would I wish I still had that cut that he selected off of his
[16:03.630 --> 16:05.230]  you know, minimal seed sprout.
[16:05.230 --> 16:08.390]  I'm sure somebody out there has a better one because he used to sprout like five
[16:08.390 --> 16:13.870]  seeds in an attempt to replicate what the home grower might find.
[16:15.830 --> 16:18.590]  I always thought that was kind of a guy's just to keep his numbers down.
[16:19.150 --> 16:22.270]  But fair enough, you do what you do while you're breeding and while you're growing.
[16:22.910 --> 16:24.710]  Pitch it how you must.
[16:24.710 --> 16:29.510]  But the Jack, the Ripper, I think he had four cuts he passed around Oregon
[16:29.790 --> 16:33.990]  and they were all different names, pink lemonade, something else, something else.
[16:35.110 --> 16:38.070]  I found one phenotype of Jack, the Ripper,
[16:38.070 --> 16:41.110]  which was Jack's cleaner time space queen, for those who don't know.
[16:43.110 --> 16:47.750]  It finished in about 70 days, had perfect triangle buds.
[16:47.790 --> 16:50.190]  Let's see his camera like that.
[16:50.190 --> 16:54.030]  And it was really, really hazy in the Pacific Northwest.
[16:54.030 --> 16:56.710]  It did well one year in 2006,
[16:57.270 --> 17:01.110]  and we took pictures of it and he used that to sell a lot of seeds,
[17:01.110 --> 17:03.350]  I believe a big, big bush, Jack the Ripper.
[17:04.350 --> 17:09.430]  But the next two years we ran that same clone and it got half as big.
[17:09.470 --> 17:11.750]  Oh, six must have just been a beast of a year
[17:12.470 --> 17:15.910]  on the West Coast, from what I remember.
[17:16.790 --> 17:21.190]  Let's see what you got mentioned that space queen and then emphasis on tiny bomb.
[17:21.630 --> 17:24.070]  They were talking about how that's kind of like.
[17:24.070 --> 17:26.790]  Yeah, so. Yeah, like
[17:27.830 --> 17:31.190]  I don't think a lot of people who know sub cool stuff nowadays
[17:31.190 --> 17:34.270]  realize that he had three viable seeds
[17:34.710 --> 17:38.270]  from a pack of 10 or 11 of Vic High Space Queen.
[17:39.030 --> 17:41.030]  And for those who don't know Vic High.
[17:42.630 --> 17:44.390]  Do some googling.
[17:44.390 --> 17:49.350]  This is probably the guy that made sub cool, who he is, in my opinion,
[17:49.910 --> 17:52.430]  besides all of his efforts on his own.
[17:52.430 --> 17:58.670]  But Vic High soil recipe plus two cups of blood meal is sub cool recipe.
[18:01.070 --> 18:01.870]  But let's see.
[18:01.870 --> 18:03.670]  So anyway, get back to the three phenos.
[18:03.670 --> 18:06.310]  He had two phenos of a female.
[18:07.030 --> 18:08.990]  He called them B and C.
[18:08.990 --> 18:11.270]  And I think it was.
[18:13.190 --> 18:14.990]  I think it was the B one.
[18:14.990 --> 18:16.910]  I can't remember what of them was tiny bomb.
[18:16.910 --> 18:18.990]  It was significantly smaller than the other one,
[18:19.550 --> 18:23.110]  but it had this potent quality to it that was obviously knockout.
[18:23.150 --> 18:25.150]  You know, you smoke the one.
[18:25.150 --> 18:27.470]  You're like, wow, this is really great mango type weed.
[18:27.470 --> 18:31.670]  And then you smoke the other one and you're like, whoa, this is something serious.
[18:32.790 --> 18:37.110]  The space queen from Vic High, if anybody's got those seeds or F2s
[18:37.110 --> 18:39.910]  of the space, Jill, that sub cool and Jill made.
[18:41.070 --> 18:44.950]  Let me know, I want those.
[18:45.470 --> 18:48.270]  And then the other one, I felt like, at least here in Colorado,
[18:48.270 --> 18:50.910]  was tried and true for a long time was the vortex.
[18:51.830 --> 18:54.030]  That was one of those that we always can.
[18:54.030 --> 18:57.350]  If you had a little pyramid, those that one was at the top of the list
[18:57.350 --> 19:00.310]  by consistently, you know, paying the mortgage and that kind of stuff.
[19:01.510 --> 19:05.230]  Yeah, I had a vortex that I sprouted as well from seeds.
[19:05.270 --> 19:08.030]  Let's see seeds that I got from sub.
[19:08.030 --> 19:12.070]  And the funny thing is, he thought that I got a clone from him
[19:12.350 --> 19:16.430]  of his vortex when I sprouted the seeds from his seed stock.
[19:16.430 --> 19:18.790]  So it's kind of weird that he wouldn't just be like, oh, sweet.
[19:18.790 --> 19:21.550]  You got some more phenos out of my seed stock.
[19:21.550 --> 19:23.190]  He was just like, no, you got that clone from me.
[19:24.830 --> 19:27.150]  So I determined I would just give it out to everybody.
[19:27.150 --> 19:30.430]  I could just kind of spite him back in the day when we had our little falling out.
[19:31.150 --> 19:35.870]  But it was a great vortex, man, that Apollo 13 really came through.
[19:36.590 --> 19:40.750]  The the calyxes were really big on it when he grew it outdoors.
[19:41.070 --> 19:45.350]  I think my cousin described it as making him pleasantly uncomfortable.
[19:48.430 --> 19:51.430]  And I feel like that's how a lot of people like to feel
[19:51.430 --> 19:55.270]  when they want to get to that level on the couch kind of thing and just veg out.
[19:55.950 --> 19:59.350]  Yeah, this is like this is where I need to be being this high sitting here.
[20:01.310 --> 20:03.750]  So another, you know, sub cools
[20:04.350 --> 20:07.510]  wife for a while was Miss Jill.
[20:08.390 --> 20:12.910]  And I feel like she had genetics on her own right that she was working on.
[20:13.830 --> 20:17.590]  One of those that stood out when we were kind of talking before
[20:17.590 --> 20:21.830]  is that orange velvet, and you felt like it might be misrepresented.
[20:21.830 --> 20:24.590]  So I was hoping that, you know, we could dive deeper into that
[20:24.590 --> 20:27.110]  with explaining how you were telling me about the Melvin.
[20:28.750 --> 20:31.110]  Yeah, so from my understanding,
[20:31.990 --> 20:36.270]  Miss Jill got that clone from her father's friend,
[20:36.470 --> 20:38.510]  I believe, or a friend of her father's.
[20:39.510 --> 20:42.990]  But it was originally a airline clone named Melvin.
[20:44.150 --> 20:46.150]  But she wanted it to be more feminine, I think,
[20:46.150 --> 20:50.230]  so she changed it to orange velvet and then crossed it with Space Queen.
[20:50.630 --> 20:55.110]  And that became the jelly bean, which for 10 years was just considered
[20:55.110 --> 20:58.550]  one of their flavorful strains that if you didn't really like to get that high,
[20:58.550 --> 21:00.790]  you grow jelly bean.
[21:00.790 --> 21:04.950]  And then for some reason, I think it's BHA, the butane honey oil.
[21:05.590 --> 21:07.230]  When it when it came about,
[21:07.230 --> 21:10.710]  jelly bean just transformed into this legendary strain because of its,
[21:11.310 --> 21:14.510]  you know, solventless or its
[21:14.510 --> 21:16.990]  extraction properties with the solvents.
[21:17.110 --> 21:22.270]  So. Jelly bean got huge in Colorado when I moved out here,
[21:22.430 --> 21:24.510]  I was like, really, jelly bean?
[21:24.550 --> 21:28.190]  I mean, it always tasted really good because it tasted like the the mother,
[21:28.350 --> 21:29.510]  the Melvin.
[21:30.310 --> 21:32.110]  But the Melvin didn't really get you high either.
[21:35.340 --> 21:38.380]  And then what do you think about some of the other genetics?
[21:38.900 --> 21:41.460]  I feel like, you know, some of her stuff really stood out
[21:42.740 --> 21:44.380]  for here in Colorado.
[21:44.380 --> 21:47.820]  And like you mentioned, the jelly bean seemed like for for a while there,
[21:48.620 --> 21:51.020]  people are loving her stuff.
[21:51.740 --> 21:54.940]  Yeah, I mean, I've I've kind of always maintained,
[21:54.940 --> 21:58.420]  you know, so cool, had his own way with words.
[21:59.020 --> 22:02.380]  But I feel like Jill was the wind beneath the sails
[22:02.380 --> 22:04.620]  of that whole movement of what they were doing.
[22:07.100 --> 22:12.060]  Yeah. So the other thing you were talking about is that Space Queen that she then
[22:12.940 --> 22:15.660]  kind of, as far as I understand, worked with or whatever,
[22:15.660 --> 22:18.620]  and then created Space Jill.
[22:18.620 --> 22:22.740]  Yeah, they used the space dude, their classic Space Queen male.
[22:23.820 --> 22:27.660]  And crossed it with the the bigger phenotype of the Space Queen,
[22:27.660 --> 22:30.540]  which was in its own right, just a great breeding mother.
[22:31.740 --> 22:34.060]  That tiny bomb was something else, I'll admit that.
[22:35.980 --> 22:38.180]  I think twice so cool got rid of the tiny bomb
[22:38.180 --> 22:41.220]  because it just didn't yield enough and twice asked for it back
[22:41.220 --> 22:44.340]  from the people he gave it to, like, you know what, I need that back in my garden.
[22:46.020 --> 22:50.900]  But the the space jails, I'm sure some people found some gold in those seeds
[22:50.900 --> 22:54.860]  because that was just an F2 of big high seeds, you know.
[22:57.060 --> 23:00.740]  And then when I've been kind of chopping up with you before,
[23:00.740 --> 23:03.340]  just kind of hanging out the house smoking or something like that,
[23:03.980 --> 23:07.540]  you introduced me to a guy that his name is Howard.
[23:07.540 --> 23:13.780]  And then his his kind of like avatars or goes by is the draw.
[23:13.780 --> 23:16.020]  Oh, I was hoping not to mess that up.
[23:16.020 --> 23:20.180]  Yeah. So let's kind of talk about him, because I feel like not a lot of people
[23:20.460 --> 23:21.580]  might not know his work.
[23:21.580 --> 23:25.060]  And that's one of the cool things I hope, especially as the Q&A
[23:25.060 --> 23:29.020]  kind of part of this, where people can kind of talk to you about the back end
[23:29.020 --> 23:32.460]  or the some of the history of the genetics, because once you start
[23:32.460 --> 23:36.140]  to understand certain stuff like that, I feel like you as a farmer,
[23:36.380 --> 23:40.380]  your IQ level has just gone up major points because now you don't waste
[23:40.380 --> 23:40.980]  a lot of time.
[23:40.980 --> 23:43.940]  And if you are lucky enough to eventually get picked up
[23:43.940 --> 23:46.180]  or on your own, create a commercial side of things,
[23:46.420 --> 23:49.700]  you're not going to waste a lot of money chasing a bunch of stuff
[23:49.700 --> 23:51.700]  that you might not really understand,
[23:51.700 --> 23:55.300]  especially when you first make that transition of why this isn't going to compute
[23:55.900 --> 23:58.900]  and make profit at this level.
[23:58.900 --> 24:03.300]  Yeah, and I think a lot of that comes down to even stuff I don't understand a lot.
[24:03.300 --> 24:07.100]  I know that like we were talking about so cool just a minute ago, his
[24:07.300 --> 24:10.060]  his theory was dank times dank equals dank.
[24:10.460 --> 24:14.180]  Well, we all know that's been proven to not be true in every situation.
[24:14.900 --> 24:17.300]  It's a good theory to start out with, and it sounds good
[24:17.300 --> 24:20.540]  if you're pitching it to somebody who doesn't know very much about seeds.
[24:20.540 --> 24:24.420]  But the the state of the seed game nowadays is
[24:24.700 --> 24:28.020]  you can waste your money before you spend it wisely, easily.
[24:29.300 --> 24:32.020]  So you need to know what you're shopping for, know what you're selling
[24:32.020 --> 24:34.300]  and what you bought, as outcasts says.
[24:35.020 --> 24:39.420]  And, you know, there's a lot of stuff out there that is just.
[24:40.860 --> 24:43.020]  But together, just thrown together, as they call it, pollen,
[24:43.660 --> 24:45.980]  pollen, chucked, whatever you want to say,
[24:45.980 --> 24:48.860]  and then there's some people doing some real work, and I feel like
[24:49.340 --> 24:53.060]  Howard draw hadn't talked to him in a decade, but I've been trying to reach out
[24:53.060 --> 24:59.140]  to him. He had those OG chocolate tie seeds that DNA had that they made chocolate with.
[25:00.020 --> 25:03.860]  So they crossed the OG chocolate tie with cantaloupe haze, I believe,
[25:03.860 --> 25:07.740]  and that's their chocolate or it might have been a Mexican sativa
[25:07.740 --> 25:10.660]  that I haven't looked on their Web page in a long time, but I think it was cantaloupe.
[25:12.300 --> 25:17.180]  But so from my understanding, half the seeds went to DNA
[25:17.180 --> 25:20.180]  and half the seeds went to draw from whoever they got them from.
[25:20.860 --> 25:24.540]  And he continued his work with them into the F2s, F3s,
[25:24.540 --> 25:27.860]  F4s, all the way to F7 is last I heard.
[25:28.580 --> 25:34.620]  Always selecting for the big, chunky, brown sugar smelling phenotype.
[25:35.180 --> 25:38.140]  I'll tell you what, man, that that weed was some of the better weed
[25:38.140 --> 25:40.420]  I've smoked in the past 20 years.
[25:40.420 --> 25:42.460]  I had two phenotypes of it.
[25:42.740 --> 25:44.460]  One was suitable for indoor growing.
[25:44.460 --> 25:46.340]  The other one looked like a beanstalk.
[25:46.340 --> 25:49.260]  It was just three feet tall with two nodes on it.
[25:49.260 --> 25:51.020]  I was like, no way am I going to keep this one.
[25:51.020 --> 25:54.540]  You know, it'll it'll make four buds and then it'll stretch through the roof.
[25:55.340 --> 25:56.780]  But I flowered it out anyway.
[25:56.780 --> 25:59.220]  I kept the clone of the shorter one.
[25:59.220 --> 26:02.740]  And when it came time to smoke and do the smoke test, that taller one.
[26:03.700 --> 26:05.700]  Was out of this world.
[26:05.700 --> 26:09.060]  I sat there and watched four episodes of some TV show on MTV
[26:09.060 --> 26:12.820]  before I realized I was wasting two hours of my time just sitting there.
[26:14.620 --> 26:17.180]  But yeah, that's the cantaloupe, right?
[26:17.540 --> 26:18.980]  The chocolate.
[26:19.140 --> 26:20.060]  Oh, the chocolate.
[26:20.060 --> 26:21.060]  Yeah, I sure do.
[26:21.060 --> 26:21.260]  Yeah.
[26:22.180 --> 26:23.660]  You've had it.
[26:23.660 --> 26:24.660]  Yeah.
[26:24.740 --> 26:25.340]  Yeah.
[26:25.340 --> 26:25.780]  Oh, yeah.
[26:25.780 --> 26:28.740]  A good friend of mine in Connecticut was growing it.
[26:28.740 --> 26:32.940]  And and it was like he he he he let it go.
[26:33.100 --> 26:34.860]  And everybody kept asking him, why?
[26:34.860 --> 26:36.020]  Why did you let that go?
[26:36.020 --> 26:38.580]  Why didn't you keep growing that that cultivar?
[26:38.580 --> 26:41.540]  Because it was just an amazing buzz.
[26:41.540 --> 26:42.860]  And the taste.
[26:42.860 --> 26:43.780]  Sweet.
[26:43.780 --> 26:44.500]  Yeah. Yeah.
[26:44.500 --> 26:46.900]  But anyway, I had I was lucky to have,
[26:47.380 --> 26:49.660]  you know, at least probably an ounce of it over time
[26:50.020 --> 26:53.580]  and was able to really enjoy get to know that that cultivar.
[26:54.460 --> 26:56.940]  But I haven't had it since.
[26:56.940 --> 26:59.220]  I know I've been trying to get in touch with this guy.
[26:59.220 --> 27:00.780]  He's got the seeds.
[27:00.780 --> 27:02.540]  He's been doing them through snow.
[27:02.540 --> 27:05.100]  Hi. You know that breeder.
[27:05.100 --> 27:05.900]  I know I don't.
[27:05.900 --> 27:09.060]  But so he's but there's someone out there that still has it.
[27:09.820 --> 27:13.180]  He's got him with the F4s, F5s, F6s.
[27:13.180 --> 27:15.900]  You know, these are these are F7s last I heard.
[27:16.540 --> 27:17.860]  Nice. Nice.
[27:17.860 --> 27:21.980]  And he's he's always selected for that same structure.
[27:22.100 --> 27:24.940]  So and I talked to him about on numerous occasions, picking his brain,
[27:24.940 --> 27:29.820]  just being like, you know, as a frugal seed buyer, as a 23, 24 year old kid,
[27:29.820 --> 27:33.620]  not really having money to buy seeds at a 200 hour pack price tag.
[27:35.420 --> 27:37.460]  I just said, you know, I really want this Fino again.
[27:37.460 --> 27:38.620]  Can I get this exact one?
[27:38.620 --> 27:42.580]  He says, I promise you, if you get these F3s or the F2.5s, whatever he had.
[27:43.500 --> 27:46.100]  He's like, you'll find it. You'll find it.
[27:46.100 --> 27:48.780]  And I've seen him on.
[27:48.980 --> 27:52.020]  Seedbank, I can't remember what Seedbank did the other day at Brian's house.
[27:53.820 --> 27:56.020]  Is it a trusted source, the Seedbank?
[27:57.140 --> 28:00.740]  I meant to ask a breeder, a friend of mine, he's represented on there, too.
[28:00.780 --> 28:04.180]  I would imagine if he's bending through them, it is.
[28:04.740 --> 28:06.060]  But I can't say for certain.
[28:06.060 --> 28:07.260]  So I'm just going to hold back.
[28:08.540 --> 28:12.260]  Yeah, you know, you are so spot on about the seed game right now.
[28:12.260 --> 28:16.060]  It's it's it's sad that so many people are taking advantage of people.
[28:16.060 --> 28:20.460]  So again, anybody listening, you really got to know your source, man.
[28:20.740 --> 28:24.860]  So important this day and age because there are so many people playing the game.
[28:26.180 --> 28:28.020]  Yep. And your history, too.
[28:28.020 --> 28:31.660]  I feel like, you know, the more that we kind of discuss with you today, Sticky,
[28:31.660 --> 28:34.860]  I think the audience will see that, like, I don't know how, man,
[28:34.860 --> 28:36.740]  but you're kind of rain man with this shit.
[28:36.740 --> 28:39.860]  And it's almost like somebody could throw out a strange name
[28:39.860 --> 28:42.260]  and you'd rattle it off in two seconds, man.
[28:42.260 --> 28:46.140]  So there's a lot of things that I feel like, you know, we want to continue
[28:46.140 --> 28:49.060]  working with and continue kind of walking down that road.
[28:49.300 --> 28:52.300]  Can we talk more about this?
[28:52.300 --> 28:54.900]  I was draw. Oh, guy, because again, yeah.
[28:54.940 --> 28:56.540]  Are there other things besides that?
[28:56.540 --> 28:57.460]  Oh, gee, chocolate.
[28:57.460 --> 28:59.740]  Because I remember there's one of my boys, Frank.
[28:59.940 --> 29:02.020]  Hope he doesn't long, long time ago.
[29:02.020 --> 29:03.620]  So we didn't care. He loses his name.
[29:03.620 --> 29:07.380]  But I basically learned that I had a chocolate from him
[29:07.580 --> 29:09.700]  that I was for a long time just calling Frank.
[29:09.700 --> 29:11.060]  Because he just gave it to me.
[29:11.060 --> 29:12.340]  I had no idea what it was.
[29:12.340 --> 29:15.180]  And then when it started to flower out, I was like, what a gift, dude.
[29:15.180 --> 29:17.100]  And then, yeah, you're sitting there smoking.
[29:17.100 --> 29:19.340]  So it was like, oh, Frank's gift. This is definitely.
[29:19.540 --> 29:23.380]  And that was just another one of those that people hadn't seen cannabis
[29:23.380 --> 29:25.780]  that looked like that before.
[29:25.780 --> 29:27.980]  It was it was big cannabis.
[29:27.980 --> 29:33.300]  I mean, big buds, big, chunky, solid buds on big, hearty plants is what it was.
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.140]  And I know there's a lot of people that are going to be like,
[29:37.140 --> 29:41.620]  and I know there's a difference in the OG chocolate tie
[29:41.660 --> 29:45.100]  and the stuff people call chocolate tie from like late 60s.
[29:47.460 --> 29:51.020]  I think the OG chocolate tie is like more of a farm to cultivar,
[29:51.460 --> 29:53.740]  you know, not like a just.
[29:54.740 --> 29:57.060]  Closer to land race, as they say, but
[29:58.100 --> 30:02.020]  I can't remember what made it what makes it the OG chocolate tie.
[30:03.260 --> 30:05.860]  But there's a difference, like I said.
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.380]  But yeah, Howard got those seeds.
[30:08.380 --> 30:11.500]  I think he had 500 of those seeds just to play with.
[30:11.500 --> 30:13.140]  So he knows it intimately.
[30:13.140 --> 30:16.980]  And I've been trying to get in touch with the dude because I want those seeds.
[30:17.620 --> 30:19.380]  I want that weed again.
[30:19.380 --> 30:21.900]  And like I said, he's selling them through Snow High.
[30:21.900 --> 30:25.260]  So if you know who Snow High is, you can track him down.
[30:26.260 --> 30:27.300]  Yeah, shout out Snow High.
[30:27.300 --> 30:29.620]  I feel like a lot of people know that dude's name.
[30:29.620 --> 30:33.540]  Yeah, he's got a lot of land race stuff or cultivars that are not so much land
[30:33.540 --> 30:37.100]  race, more farm varieties that are crossed with each other.
[30:37.100 --> 30:41.220]  I think the one I'm most interested in from him is his black mamba.
[30:41.220 --> 30:45.380]  It's a. Vietnamese black times Congolese black.
[30:46.420 --> 30:51.140]  I think it flowers like 14 to 16 weeks, and that sounds right up my alley.
[30:51.180 --> 30:55.860]  If I get back into the little tent game here, I'm going to have a little sativa tent.
[30:57.700 --> 30:59.060]  Yeah, that's something else I feel like.
[30:59.060 --> 31:02.660]  And you continue to this day, man, you continue to educate me on just
[31:03.340 --> 31:07.780]  really understanding the real value of letting the plant go to fruition
[31:07.780 --> 31:11.180]  and letting it finish out in the proper amount of time and not,
[31:12.100 --> 31:15.020]  especially at the commercial level, you know, so many people here in Colorado
[31:15.020 --> 31:17.900]  take shortcuts and just kind of
[31:19.500 --> 31:21.980]  say one thing, but behind the scenes not do the other.
[31:21.980 --> 31:23.100]  And I feel like
[31:24.540 --> 31:27.260]  you can sometimes usually tell that in the cannabis itself.
[31:27.860 --> 31:31.460]  And there's just really no shortcuts when cultivating cannabis.
[31:31.500 --> 31:35.780]  So picking out your genetics, obviously, I feel like is the chapter one.
[31:36.420 --> 31:39.100]  And then I want to kind of get it more into before we get into like
[31:39.100 --> 31:41.220]  some of the other breeders and genetics.
[31:41.580 --> 31:44.180]  I wanted people to kind of also understand your background.
[31:44.180 --> 31:47.940]  I feel like you've gone the way of kind of a lot of us
[31:47.940 --> 31:52.380]  where you kind of started farming with bottle nutrients, trying to figure that out.
[31:53.260 --> 31:58.420]  You know, such a learning curve with that, especially growing in Georgia,
[31:58.420 --> 32:02.580]  where, you know, there was no such thing as a hydro store or anything like that.
[32:03.100 --> 32:06.820]  So it was very time consuming going around from place to place,
[32:06.820 --> 32:08.740]  to place getting all this done.
[32:08.740 --> 32:10.540]  So you really had to have a passion.
[32:10.540 --> 32:15.620]  And I always like to use the word cowboy-esque-ness or cowgirl-esque-ness
[32:15.820 --> 32:19.100]  to you to be able to want to even do that in Georgia
[32:19.100 --> 32:21.380]  or on the East Coast for for whatever reason.
[32:22.660 --> 32:26.260]  Yeah, most of the time sourcing amendments in the South was
[32:26.740 --> 32:30.260]  particularly tricky, because if you went somewhere and asked for a product
[32:30.260 --> 32:32.380]  and they didn't have it, bam, you're the mark.
[32:32.580 --> 32:33.660]  They know you're growing weed.
[32:34.740 --> 32:37.740]  So I'd go to this one garden store, my parents knew their friends
[32:37.740 --> 32:41.540]  or my parents' friends owned, and I'd say, hey, do you have any fox farm,
[32:42.060 --> 32:44.420]  you know, soil or whatever?
[32:44.420 --> 32:45.940]  No, that's used for marijuana.
[32:45.940 --> 32:48.060]  We don't use marijuana nutrients.
[32:48.060 --> 32:50.540]  I said, well, you know, OK. And I left.
[32:52.020 --> 32:54.820]  Then I hear about it from my parents, you're trying to grow weed in our backyard.
[32:55.020 --> 32:56.660]  No, I was growing weed in the backyard.
[32:56.660 --> 33:00.060]  I'm trying to grow weed at my buddy's house with better soil now.
[33:03.100 --> 33:06.780]  But yeah, so, you know, when the hydro stores popped up,
[33:06.780 --> 33:11.420]  I think the first ones really were in Atlanta, Atlantis hydroponics, and
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.900]  those guys have some legal troubles a few years ago, too.
[33:17.060 --> 33:19.460]  But there was one in Savannah,
[33:20.340 --> 33:24.460]  Savannah, hydroponic and organics, that was the first one I remember frequenting.
[33:24.460 --> 33:27.620]  I ran into somebody there who.
[33:27.620 --> 33:31.300]  A guy named Chris, who made a product called Super Coco for a while,
[33:31.300 --> 33:35.940]  it's a really good mixture of cocoa and super soil type product.
[33:37.060 --> 33:40.860]  But he asked me, we were talking about some stuff and he says
[33:41.340 --> 33:46.780]  something about plush berry, a strange subcooled made like in 2007 or eight.
[33:47.820 --> 33:49.780]  And I said, yeah, I've smoked that.
[33:49.780 --> 33:53.460]  And I kind of said it in a dismissive way because I was still bitter
[33:53.460 --> 33:56.340]  about our calling out his friends.
[33:56.340 --> 33:58.380]  And he goes, well, you know, so cool.
[33:58.380 --> 33:59.340]  And I was like, yeah.
[33:59.340 --> 34:01.620]  And he's like, are you sticky lungs?
[34:01.700 --> 34:03.980]  That's the only person that ever called me out like that.
[34:04.220 --> 34:07.020]  I was like, wow. Wow.
[34:08.020 --> 34:09.900]  But yeah, that was at the hydro store.
[34:09.900 --> 34:12.980]  So you got to be careful what kind of conversations you get into in these states
[34:13.260 --> 34:16.980]  at the store, buying your amendments and your supplies, you just.
[34:18.500 --> 34:20.500]  Go and get your stuff and get out, guys.
[34:20.660 --> 34:22.660]  Yeah, it was just
[34:23.300 --> 34:26.180]  sometimes like you had mentioned, if things were out, it would be a nightmare.
[34:26.180 --> 34:30.180]  You'd really I guess that was maybe why some of us have really learned
[34:30.940 --> 34:33.420]  like to do more like chess moves where you have
[34:34.380 --> 34:38.580]  supplies out the yin yang that you need, at least for like a couple of months out
[34:38.860 --> 34:40.740]  so that you don't have to worry about those things.
[34:40.740 --> 34:44.100]  And, yeah, let's kind of get in more, you know.
[34:44.100 --> 34:48.660]  So, you know, I feel like at that time, everybody's learning about Fox Farm.
[34:48.660 --> 34:51.420]  I feel like most of us were probably using like Ocean Forest.
[34:52.020 --> 34:56.340]  There's a at least for me, then it seemed like I wanted to improve my cannabis.
[34:56.340 --> 34:59.460]  I was trying to go more of like the Aurora organics route
[35:00.060 --> 35:02.140]  outdoors to Roots Organic.
[35:02.220 --> 35:04.860]  Yeah, I think that company is called Aurora, though.
[35:05.060 --> 35:06.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Roots Organic.
[35:06.660 --> 35:08.260]  Or Innovations, I think.
[35:08.260 --> 35:10.580]  Yeah, because people get confused with.
[35:11.180 --> 35:15.780]  So the hot spot in here in Colorado hotspot is Big Tomato.
[35:16.020 --> 35:17.220]  Big Tomato.
[35:17.220 --> 35:20.940]  And I was mentioning even yesterday that when that first opened up,
[35:20.940 --> 35:25.820]  that was kind of like the barbershop, if you will, for cannabis folk.
[35:25.860 --> 35:29.540]  So we'd all hang around there and kind of try to network and see who needed what
[35:29.540 --> 35:30.300]  and that kind of stuff.
[35:30.300 --> 35:35.580]  But once you walked into that store, the Big Tomato, everything was tomatoes.
[35:35.780 --> 35:38.580]  You would talk about, you know, I don't have enough nitrogen,
[35:38.580 --> 35:39.660]  I think, with my tomatoes.
[35:39.660 --> 35:42.140]  What's the best way to improve this with my tomatoes?
[35:43.100 --> 35:46.860]  And I felt like because we still had to use this silly verbiage,
[35:48.180 --> 35:50.700]  the education was lost on me still when I would be,
[35:50.980 --> 35:54.420]  you know, you'd only have so many so many questions that you could ask per visit.
[35:54.980 --> 35:57.380]  It was a very busy place at the time.
[35:57.380 --> 36:00.740]  So I feel like just knowledge in general would just take forever
[36:00.740 --> 36:01.900]  to try to figure things out.
[36:01.900 --> 36:04.060]  Or if you had an issue driving all the way down there.
[36:04.700 --> 36:07.380]  I remember waiting like 30, 40 minutes sometimes, having to
[36:08.100 --> 36:10.900]  hopefully ask this guy a question like, hey, you remember that light
[36:10.900 --> 36:13.300]  that you sold me? I don't understand why it's not working.
[36:13.980 --> 36:16.100]  There wasn't really just
[36:16.340 --> 36:19.260]  hotlines or customer service stuff that would really
[36:19.620 --> 36:22.700]  answer those kind of questions at that time.
[36:22.700 --> 36:25.740]  Yeah, and I think the culture of, you know,
[36:26.300 --> 36:28.700]  the legality of it more so, less the culture,
[36:28.860 --> 36:32.180]  but the legality of it influences that when I moved to Oregon in 05,
[36:32.180 --> 36:34.940]  I noticed immediately that I could talk about,
[36:35.740 --> 36:38.860]  you know, I could say tomatoes if I wanted to, or I could just say
[36:38.860 --> 36:41.220]  I'm missing nitric and what do you what do you recommend?
[36:41.220 --> 36:42.820]  And they knew I was talking about cannabis.
[36:44.900 --> 36:47.220]  So I think as it gets legal in other places.
[36:49.500 --> 36:51.500]  I feel like for maybe Layton and Peter,
[36:52.060 --> 36:56.060]  California is kind of always just kind of I mean, I've always
[36:56.300 --> 36:58.580]  I feel like other states have always kind of looked up to you guys.
[36:58.580 --> 37:01.580]  I was I know when I was in high school, I was trying to find anybody
[37:01.580 --> 37:03.660]  that had connections in California
[37:03.660 --> 37:07.100]  because that was the only place that at least in Georgia, it seemed like that was
[37:07.340 --> 37:11.620]  is either the brick weed or you're getting some kind of Cali type nugs
[37:11.620 --> 37:15.260]  that you'd either have to drive to Miami to get or, you know, usually
[37:15.260 --> 37:17.860]  a bigger Florida kind of city.
[37:18.460 --> 37:20.660]  There's also this place called.
[37:20.660 --> 37:21.700]  Well, there was scad.
[37:21.700 --> 37:24.980]  You remember that in Savannah, all those kids.
[37:25.220 --> 37:28.460]  And then there was and I think it was Orlando.
[37:28.500 --> 37:30.140]  There was like this.
[37:31.220 --> 37:34.060]  You could you were going to school to be like a director in movies
[37:34.060 --> 37:35.060]  and stuff like that.
[37:35.100 --> 37:39.540]  I remember we drive down there and those kids could care less what it costs.
[37:39.620 --> 37:42.540]  Like I don't I just remember seeing like that's the first time I felt like
[37:42.540 --> 37:46.940]  I ever saw real wealth was at this little like academy
[37:46.940 --> 37:50.900]  where you see kids riding around in Ferraris and you talk about wholesale.
[37:51.260 --> 37:53.940]  Full sale. Yeah, that was the
[37:54.820 --> 37:57.540]  so shout out to Full Sail, because I know that all those kids.
[37:58.060 --> 37:59.060]  We appreciate you.
[37:59.060 --> 38:00.940]  All of us poor kids in Atlanta.
[38:00.940 --> 38:02.140]  Thank you very, very much.
[38:02.140 --> 38:05.980]  But that talk about real wealth and learning.
[38:06.140 --> 38:08.780]  I think that's cool at that time was like 50 grand.
[38:09.940 --> 38:11.660]  It's a good.
[38:11.660 --> 38:16.980]  How do you feel like a producer and movies or music?
[38:17.020 --> 38:20.540]  I have a friend that went to music and anything they interviewed.
[38:21.140 --> 38:23.700]  Yeah, the interview he had to get in the school into the school
[38:23.700 --> 38:26.580]  was with the guy who wrote Hey, yeah, the outcast.
[38:27.060 --> 38:29.220]  Some like 50, 60 year old white dude at the time.
[38:30.220 --> 38:33.300]  Well, yeah, it's a very prestigious place.
[38:33.500 --> 38:38.940]  But hey, those kids have nothing better to do than try to be a movie producer
[38:38.940 --> 38:40.740]  and smoke weed, it seemed like.
[38:40.740 --> 38:42.980]  And probably a variety of other things, especially in Miami.
[38:42.980 --> 38:46.020]  I don't know if you guys have been in Miami, but
[38:46.020 --> 38:48.020]  this is a crazy place.
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.340]  Yeah. So let's get back more in like.
[38:52.340 --> 38:54.660]  So did you guys remember they call?
[38:54.940 --> 38:57.740]  I was going to say, do you remember the term kind, right?
[38:58.020 --> 39:01.740]  That's kind of a word for the Emerald Triangle.
[39:03.020 --> 39:04.340]  Oh, yeah.
[39:04.340 --> 39:05.460]  Yeah. And you're right.
[39:05.460 --> 39:07.340]  And that was the bomb.
[39:07.340 --> 39:11.220]  I mean, that's that's the stuff that came in and seal meal bags
[39:11.220 --> 39:13.580]  and in November and December.
[39:13.580 --> 39:15.580]  And we'd have that until January.
[39:15.580 --> 39:16.860]  Then it would be gone.
[39:16.860 --> 39:18.860]  And you would see it again until the following year.
[39:18.860 --> 39:22.820]  But I mean, they had they had purple and pink calyxes
[39:22.820 --> 39:24.820]  . I mean, it was just amazing smoke.
[39:24.820 --> 39:26.820]  You know, those were the days.
[39:26.820 --> 39:28.820]  It was back in the early 80s.
[39:28.820 --> 39:30.820]  We would have that stuff.
[39:30.820 --> 39:34.100]  And, you know, when I ended up doing that conference
[39:34.100 --> 39:37.940]  and ended up going to the Emerald Triangle, I was like in awe,
[39:37.940 --> 39:40.660]  just like, oh, my God, this is where it came from.
[39:40.660 --> 39:44.580]  And then meeting Kevin and Kevin talking about railroad cars,
[39:44.580 --> 39:48.580]  if we going east, I'm like, that was the shit I was smoking.
[39:49.180 --> 39:52.540]  That was the shit I was smoking.
[39:52.540 --> 39:55.500]  That you were growing out here was fucking amazing.
[39:55.500 --> 39:56.700]  It was such a trip.
[39:56.700 --> 39:59.540]  And, you know, backing it up to the tomato story.
[40:00.540 --> 40:04.140]  Yeah, that was the code word for for weed was tomatoes.
[40:04.140 --> 40:06.540]  And I think I've told this story before.
[40:07.140 --> 40:10.460]  A good friend of mine, Chip Osborne from Osborne Organics,
[40:10.460 --> 40:13.340]  who is a heavy on the soil chemistry side.
[40:14.300 --> 40:17.260]  He and I looked at trying to figure out what is the ultimate
[40:17.700 --> 40:20.100]  nutrient balance for the cannabis plant.
[40:20.580 --> 40:23.620]  And the deeper we dove, the more we realized
[40:24.580 --> 40:27.820]  that each cultivar pulls different types of nutrients.
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.900]  So it was just a crapshoot as to what the real balances should be,
[40:32.900 --> 40:37.860]  which is why I stress testing after every run so that you can reamend
[40:38.220 --> 40:40.580]  what that cultivar stripped out of your soil.
[40:40.580 --> 40:43.300]  So you're starting at least at zero again.
[40:43.300 --> 40:47.700]  And the interesting thing we found out was the plant that was closest
[40:47.700 --> 40:52.540]  to the nutrient pig that cannabis is, is guess what?
[40:52.740 --> 40:54.580]  The fucking tomato.
[40:55.620 --> 40:58.020]  So I always tell people, like, you know,
[40:58.020 --> 41:01.140]  send your soil test off and tell them that you're growing tomatoes.
[41:01.140 --> 41:02.860]  And ironically, here we go.
[41:02.860 --> 41:07.300]  You know, it comes back full fucking circle and check your nutrient levels.
[41:07.300 --> 41:10.820]  And if you have the proper nutrition level to grow tomatoes,
[41:10.820 --> 41:12.780]  you will do well with your cannabis plant.
[41:12.780 --> 41:15.460]  So there's a little little gold nugget for the audience.
[41:18.180 --> 41:21.060]  Yeah, I feel like I feel like we're being those old dudes
[41:21.060 --> 41:24.700]  like going down memory lane to remember when everybody said it was tomatoes.
[41:25.900 --> 41:28.100]  But, you know, it was.
[41:28.660 --> 41:30.700]  I was going to say, I'm that old dude at work every day.
[41:30.700 --> 41:34.900]  So, yeah, but, you know, it's kind of fun going down memory lane
[41:34.900 --> 41:36.420]  and kind of talking about some of that stuff.
[41:38.580 --> 41:41.900]  As we progress, it seemed like, you know, we move on from the
[41:41.900 --> 41:46.220]  even the bag soil and then we're kind of I felt like at that time, you know,
[41:46.420 --> 41:51.260]  overgrow was taken off the forums or off the Internet for a while.
[41:51.860 --> 41:55.420]  I felt like all of a sudden there was other things that kind of popped up.
[41:55.940 --> 41:59.180]  But nothing ever had that real.
[41:59.740 --> 42:03.180]  Plus, like Clackamas, coots, and I remember Jeremy Silva.
[42:03.460 --> 42:06.860]  There was just a lot of people on overgrow that were really educating.
[42:06.860 --> 42:11.260]  And I I feel like maybe on some of the other forums, I just for my personal growth,
[42:11.460 --> 42:15.020]  I never saw any kind of those mentors just giving out stuff on.
[42:15.380 --> 42:17.980]  I think it was like roll it up or some of those other ones
[42:17.980 --> 42:21.460]  where there was information out on more like hydroponic stuff.
[42:21.460 --> 42:24.860]  But the living soil stuff was pretty weak except for overgrow.
[42:25.540 --> 42:28.020]  And then that's when I started to get more into YouTube
[42:28.780 --> 42:31.660]  and really started to to learn more about this.
[42:31.660 --> 42:35.420]  And I feel like, you know, sticky when we started to first connect.
[42:35.660 --> 42:37.980]  I felt like, man, you really understood,
[42:37.980 --> 42:42.500]  especially before it was the buzzwords of just hyping on like the terpenes.
[42:42.540 --> 42:45.620]  I mean, that was something like a cannabinoids, like
[42:46.220 --> 42:48.380]  really hyping on that stuff before anybody.
[42:49.420 --> 42:52.540]  It was more, especially when I first met you, I felt like people were just happy
[42:52.540 --> 42:54.740]  to show up at the party with with good bud.
[42:55.340 --> 42:58.820]  And you kept talking about like basically why that wasn't good.
[42:58.820 --> 43:00.740]  But it was just pretty bad.
[43:00.740 --> 43:03.340]  So let's kind of get into your journey
[43:03.340 --> 43:06.300]  going into more of organics and living soil for yourself.
[43:06.820 --> 43:10.700]  Yeah, I guess, like I said, I moved to Oregon in 05.
[43:11.980 --> 43:15.580]  Met some cool he was doing his super soil mix, which was organic
[43:16.660 --> 43:19.580]  pretty much all the way.
[43:19.580 --> 43:23.820]  Started shopping at a place called Constant Gardner in Springfield, Oregon,
[43:23.820 --> 43:26.300]  which is neighboring to Eugene, where I live.
[43:26.980 --> 43:29.380]  And the guy there, Scott, was real cool with me.
[43:29.380 --> 43:33.100]  He he'd front me some nutrients and stuff if I needed the nutrients.
[43:33.100 --> 43:35.660]  And I come back in pain later. Don't do that nowadays.
[43:35.660 --> 43:37.860]  I'm sure he's not going to do that for you.
[43:37.860 --> 43:39.740]  It's in the early days.
[43:39.740 --> 43:41.900]  But let's see.
[43:41.900 --> 43:48.020]  So I was using constant gardeners soil, a nutrient line called Nectar for the Gods.
[43:48.820 --> 43:53.060]  And that was maybe 80 percent organic, if you could call it that, you know.
[43:53.900 --> 43:56.140]  And I used that for like nine years.
[43:56.140 --> 43:59.180]  And then when I moved to Colorado.
[44:00.980 --> 44:04.420]  I started piling up all this soil in my backyard
[44:04.420 --> 44:10.020]  after every run, and I knew my landlord was going to have a problem with it.
[44:10.060 --> 44:12.940]  You know, me making these garden beds up against this house.
[44:13.300 --> 44:15.260]  So I said, there's got to be a different way to do this.
[44:15.420 --> 44:19.780]  Coming from my organic farming background, when I had a organic vegetable
[44:19.780 --> 44:22.820]  farm in Georgia, I thought to myself, well,
[44:23.380 --> 44:28.860]  if I don't use the chemicals that build up in this nutrient mixture,
[44:29.260 --> 44:31.580]  I could reuse the soil.
[44:31.580 --> 44:34.940]  And then I met Duke out here.
[44:34.940 --> 44:41.060]  I had known about Duke Diamond for we had talked probably online since 2006 ish.
[44:42.140 --> 44:44.700]  And then I was supposed to meet him at Bonnaroo in 06,
[44:44.700 --> 44:47.220]  and I think I walked right past him.
[44:47.220 --> 44:49.980]  And and we talked about it years later, like, was that you?
[44:49.980 --> 44:51.220]  Probably.
[44:51.380 --> 44:56.180]  And then I met him in in Longmont, and he tells me for certain you can do this.
[44:56.180 --> 44:58.020]  You just need to use organic amendments.
[44:58.020 --> 45:00.980]  And I was like, OK, so I got to go full circle for my own thing,
[45:00.980 --> 45:05.700]  which is growing cannabis like I would outdoors, but indoors.
[45:07.100 --> 45:10.260]  Essentially, so living soil is kind of where I've
[45:12.300 --> 45:15.780]  made my way to with the cannabis production, cannabis cultivation.
[45:17.340 --> 45:20.660]  You know, I feel like from what I've seen,
[45:21.220 --> 45:23.740]  people touting their hydro weed is really good.
[45:24.380 --> 45:26.700]  People touting their organic weed is really good.
[45:26.700 --> 45:30.100]  From those people, I can kind of take a cross section and say,
[45:30.700 --> 45:33.500]  I believe organic weed is better for the most part
[45:34.740 --> 45:39.340]  in most scenarios because of the terpene development.
[45:40.820 --> 45:43.740]  Now, is that to say you can't get good terpenes and hydro?
[45:43.780 --> 45:44.780]  That's not true at all.
[45:44.780 --> 45:46.780]  You can get great terpenes and hydro.
[45:46.780 --> 45:49.060]  I just feel like they have more of a robust.
[45:50.220 --> 45:52.500]  Pronunciation in organics.
[45:54.860 --> 45:59.540]  And I feel like for people that are, you know, I've been teasing like here in Denver,
[45:59.540 --> 46:03.020]  it seems like everybody starts to grow a little bit in the winter.
[46:03.820 --> 46:05.140]  Gets kind of cold here sometimes.
[46:05.140 --> 46:07.460]  So everybody wants a little extra smoke.
[46:07.460 --> 46:11.580]  And I feel like from the genetic side of things, are there certain things
[46:11.780 --> 46:15.380]  like we could even run down Duke and why his stuff really stands out of
[46:15.620 --> 46:19.380]  of certain genetics you feel like are probably more geared or breeders,
[46:19.380 --> 46:23.020]  more geared for the indoor grower, especially as we're going into crop
[46:23.020 --> 46:24.460]  Tober for most of those guys.
[46:24.460 --> 46:28.260]  And then it seems like, you know, education October or something like that,
[46:28.260 --> 46:31.020]  where more and more people want to grow indoors.
[46:33.260 --> 46:37.620]  Yeah, I mean, I've been kind of out of the seed game for a while, just shopping around.
[46:37.620 --> 46:42.220]  I tend to get I tend to get seeds for free and I don't buy them very often.
[46:42.580 --> 46:45.420]  So if I do buy a pack of seeds, it's something I'm really hyped on.
[46:46.740 --> 46:49.300]  With that being said, I think,
[46:49.300 --> 46:52.300]  you know, a lot of these breeders are using these clone only females
[46:52.300 --> 46:54.780]  as the majority of their female stock.
[46:54.780 --> 46:59.900]  Not any but not many people are using originally created strains as females.
[47:00.300 --> 47:03.860]  So it's important to me in that aspect to look towards not only the female,
[47:03.860 --> 47:06.380]  how it produces and how it runs indoors.
[47:07.100 --> 47:08.940]  Is it mildew resistant?
[47:08.940 --> 47:14.100]  Is it mite resistant or is it, you know, just short in stature?
[47:14.620 --> 47:18.460]  But what does the male impart upon that whole?
[47:18.500 --> 47:22.820]  Usually breeders will cross a male to a lot of strains, not just one.
[47:23.660 --> 47:27.980]  So with that, you can kind of say what the male imparts into those strains.
[47:28.260 --> 47:30.260]  I feel like that's a.
[47:31.940 --> 47:34.540]  Sometimes a given with some strains like
[47:35.380 --> 47:38.620]  exotic mite stuff with cookies and cream with the starfighter in it.
[47:39.820 --> 47:43.380]  You know, you can just pretty much say they're probably going to be good washers
[47:43.620 --> 47:46.740]  or hash, hash, rosin or water hash.
[47:49.460 --> 47:51.900]  But then there's some other stuff that's, you know,
[47:52.340 --> 47:55.100]  untried, basically that people just pop up with and.
[47:56.180 --> 48:00.660]  Those I'm a little less knowledgeable about because a they're untested
[48:00.660 --> 48:04.060]  until somebody grows them, and unless these breeders are
[48:04.620 --> 48:10.300]  really documenting their process of their production runs of their own seeds,
[48:11.060 --> 48:13.300]  are they even testing them to our knowledge?
[48:16.420 --> 48:18.900]  So I would say, you know, the important thing there
[48:18.900 --> 48:23.060]  is to follow your breeder on social media, follow them.
[48:23.620 --> 48:27.380]  Through the seed banks that you shop through, make sure that the seed banks
[48:27.380 --> 48:30.700]  have the right lineage written down, that's a dead giveaway
[48:30.700 --> 48:34.020]  that seed banks a bad place to shop at when they don't have the lineage correct.
[48:36.930 --> 48:40.050]  But. What were we talking about?
[48:42.930 --> 48:45.370]  Well, that's something else, man, is you're always smoking on the good.
[48:45.370 --> 48:48.250]  So we got. Oh, yeah, it's big.
[48:48.250 --> 48:50.490]  There you go. I want to give you a plug in on that.
[48:51.130 --> 48:54.290]  Is there any resource for for these lineages?
[48:54.570 --> 48:57.970]  Like, is there something out there that people can check
[48:58.490 --> 49:01.650]  to to understand where these crosses came from?
[49:02.330 --> 49:04.410]  Or is it just word of mouth?
[49:04.410 --> 49:09.570]  Well, there are there are websites in particular Seedfinder,
[49:09.570 --> 49:12.330]  which has some laughable solutions for,
[49:13.170 --> 49:15.850]  you know, what this strain is made of or whatever.
[49:16.290 --> 49:19.970]  So I find a lot of these places, Leafly and whatnot, they're all just kind of.
[49:21.170 --> 49:24.450]  Put together by some college kid, just started smoking weed, I think, so.
[49:25.010 --> 49:27.890]  I wouldn't consider those too accurate when you're talking about
[49:27.890 --> 49:32.050]  nailing down the nitty gritty of, say, what the what the genetics
[49:32.050 --> 49:33.530]  in Jack the Ripper are.
[49:33.530 --> 49:35.730]  OK, you say it's Jack's cleaner time space queen.
[49:35.730 --> 49:38.170]  The space queen was
[49:39.010 --> 49:42.010]  Romulan and Cindy nine nine, you know, so you can go down
[49:42.010 --> 49:43.890]  that rabbit hole with those two strains.
[49:43.890 --> 49:45.090]  But what was Jack's cleaner?
[49:45.090 --> 49:48.170]  Jack's cleaner was Jack Herrera times.
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.090]  I think it was called.
[49:50.690 --> 49:53.850]  Pluton Hayes times Northern Lights, five
[49:54.090 --> 49:56.930]  times some purple haze times Northern Lights five
[49:57.370 --> 49:58.650]  and then on and on and on.
[49:58.650 --> 50:01.650]  So it's like if you really want to get to it, you got to go to the breeder.
[50:01.810 --> 50:03.490]  Got it. Got it.
[50:03.490 --> 50:06.370]  Got to know your farmer, just like in food, food.
[50:07.810 --> 50:11.050]  I feel like food and cannabis are very similar in their
[50:12.330 --> 50:15.610]  congruencies as far as knowing who's cultivating it,
[50:15.610 --> 50:19.210]  what they believe in are good practices, what they believe are bad practices.
[50:20.210 --> 50:24.850]  And just seeing that transparency, you know, from any kind of farming,
[50:24.850 --> 50:29.330]  really just cannabis food, you need to be able to see what it's made of.
[50:29.330 --> 50:32.330]  And if you're a farmer that you're growing or that you're buying from,
[50:32.450 --> 50:34.650]  won't tell you what nutrients he uses.
[50:35.250 --> 50:40.340]  Probably nothing good.
[50:41.180 --> 50:43.980]  I remember a long time ago, I felt like to like
[50:44.140 --> 50:48.380]  you would hold your recipes kind of like real close to the vest on that.
[50:49.180 --> 50:52.740]  And then the cool part about living soil is you really just using mother nature,
[50:53.340 --> 50:56.260]  kind of managing mother nature, improving that soil system.
[50:56.780 --> 51:00.100]  So we can kind of share that stuff back and forth because some of these,
[51:01.260 --> 51:03.700]  you know, older heads that are farming at the commercial level
[51:03.700 --> 51:06.260]  that are at their twenty six, twenty seventh cycle.
[51:06.700 --> 51:09.540]  There's no way that if we started today, the three of us,
[51:09.700 --> 51:11.780]  that we could catch up with them, you know?
[51:11.780 --> 51:16.340]  I mean, they're on a path that I feel like is a freight train of kind of,
[51:16.900 --> 51:20.580]  you know, opening up doors for a lot of people as well.
[51:20.580 --> 51:24.220]  I mean, the fact that they're really dialing in that stuff.
[51:24.500 --> 51:27.780]  A lot of the guys that we've had on the show, you know, go check out
[51:27.780 --> 51:28.740]  a lot of those videos.
[51:28.740 --> 51:31.020]  I mean, those guys are really dropping knowledge for you,
[51:31.540 --> 51:34.420]  especially if you're just starting out and you want to get into an attempt
[51:34.740 --> 51:37.900]  and you have aspirations, you know, you're in your hell,
[51:37.900 --> 51:41.260]  your early 20s or something like that, and you're really getting into cannabis.
[51:41.260 --> 51:44.180]  Like we all I felt like we all probably did when we were 20s,
[51:44.660 --> 51:48.900]  late teens, early 20s is when I I felt like I really started smoking every day.
[51:49.660 --> 51:52.500]  And then I probably been downhill ever since.
[51:52.500 --> 51:55.500]  But I really enjoy smoking cannabis.
[51:55.500 --> 51:59.660]  And I feel like especially at night, I'm really enjoying to
[52:00.660 --> 52:03.300]  learn to minimize the amount that I've been smoking.
[52:03.300 --> 52:05.100]  I've kind of been backing off a little bit.
[52:05.100 --> 52:08.540]  And I feel like it's it's nice to always have a clear head as well.
[52:09.100 --> 52:10.660]  And I've probably been missing that.
[52:10.660 --> 52:14.020]  I know, Leighton, I think you don't you stickies over here, Bernie.
[52:15.020 --> 52:16.980]  Don't you usually kind of wait throughout the day
[52:16.980 --> 52:19.180]  and then you kind of smoke at night?
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.260]  Kind of let your mom.
[52:20.260 --> 52:21.580]  I'm the next.
[52:21.580 --> 52:25.860]  Yeah, I have too many calls, people, you know, things that I got to,
[52:26.100 --> 52:27.340]  you know, get done.
[52:27.340 --> 52:30.860]  So I've learned to just, you know, abstain during the day
[52:31.140 --> 52:33.060]  and turn loose at night.
[52:33.060 --> 52:34.900]  And I like it that way.
[52:34.900 --> 52:38.060]  You know, I just I get more shit accomplished during the day.
[52:39.580 --> 52:41.540]  You know, with a clear head.
[52:41.660 --> 52:44.860]  Not that you know, not that I have anything against people that smoke all day.
[52:44.860 --> 52:47.900]  I don't. You know, it's it's up to up to you individuals.
[52:47.900 --> 52:50.820]  I mean, there was a point in my life
[52:50.820 --> 52:54.140]  that I used to take a bong hit before I'd call my clients
[52:55.300 --> 52:57.980]  just to fucking, you know, call me the fuck.
[52:57.980 --> 52:59.180]  Yeah, yeah, totally.
[52:59.180 --> 53:03.100]  And then I'd be like in engaging, you know, with them.
[53:04.220 --> 53:05.380]  It wasn't too stoned.
[53:05.380 --> 53:07.340]  I wasn't couch locking.
[53:07.340 --> 53:09.140]  But I, you know, I had good cultivars, too.
[53:09.140 --> 53:11.940]  It wasn't like I was smoking, you know, something that would knock you out.
[53:13.140 --> 53:16.220]  You know, that was the key to day smoking, like they say, you know, Sativa
[53:16.220 --> 53:20.180]  during the day and then you can use your, you know, your heavy indica at night.
[53:21.260 --> 53:24.860]  But I've really learned to enjoy, you know, smoking, you know,
[53:26.620 --> 53:29.260]  Sativa at night because it just gets your brain going.
[53:29.300 --> 53:30.220]  It's, you know. Yeah.
[53:30.220 --> 53:32.500]  I solve so many problems at night.
[53:32.500 --> 53:33.140]  It's not funny.
[53:33.140 --> 53:35.260]  And the next day I get up and I bust a move.
[53:35.860 --> 53:38.340]  So I you know, I like the creative effects.
[53:39.140 --> 53:41.420]  That that Sativa will give you.
[53:42.380 --> 53:43.180]  Absolutely.
[53:43.180 --> 53:47.420]  I feel like those hours, maybe I cherish them maybe even more as a father.
[53:47.420 --> 53:50.060]  But like when you put the kids to bed and you got like two hours to yourself,
[53:50.060 --> 53:54.100]  kind of man, some some nights if you get in that zone, you get stoned a little bit.
[53:55.140 --> 53:57.580]  You know, behind the scenes, I've been working on my website and stuff.
[53:57.580 --> 53:59.660]  I mean, there's a ton of hours that you have to put in that.
[53:59.660 --> 54:01.140]  Make sure everything's spelled correctly.
[54:01.140 --> 54:02.860]  All those little bullshit things.
[54:02.860 --> 54:06.820]  I feel like when I wait throughout the day and I'm just kind of smoking at night.
[54:07.100 --> 54:09.060]  Man, I am more on point with it.
[54:09.060 --> 54:12.820]  I'm enjoying it instead of burning all day by the seven o'clock.
[54:12.820 --> 54:15.460]  You're kind of like wiltering down.
[54:16.420 --> 54:18.940]  So I don't I don't know where I was really going with that.
[54:18.940 --> 54:24.300]  But I feel like if you guys are burning all day long, maybe try that out.
[54:24.340 --> 54:27.100]  You know, like I've kind of shared with you guys and going through whatever
[54:27.220 --> 54:30.700]  whatever I'm learning about and with fasting and that kind of stuff.
[54:30.700 --> 54:33.900]  It does seem like if you take a break from cannabis as well.
[54:34.140 --> 54:36.740]  And I will be the first to admit that I have smoked weed
[54:37.620 --> 54:40.100]  most of my life all day, every day.
[54:40.100 --> 54:44.060]  But I do see a lot of benefits where now you're not smoking cannabis
[54:44.060 --> 54:47.380]  so that when you do smoke cannabis, man, you have those solid two hours
[54:47.380 --> 54:51.020]  where you can get some shit done and really feel accomplished before you go to bed.
[54:52.820 --> 54:54.940]  Yeah, I guess I just.
[54:54.940 --> 54:57.620]  There is one warning, and I went through this.
[54:57.860 --> 55:00.380]  I don't know if you guys remember the DARE program.
[55:01.060 --> 55:03.620]  Oh, yeah. So I had my daughter,
[55:04.020 --> 55:07.700]  my oldest daughter, come home one day and tell me I was a drug addict
[55:07.700 --> 55:11.300]  because I drank coffee and smoked cigarettes and I was horrified.
[55:11.340 --> 55:13.900]  I was like, what the hell are they teaching these kids in school?
[55:14.460 --> 55:17.020]  So I kind of like got involved and I was like, all right.
[55:17.020 --> 55:22.940]  So I understand the the, you know, that you're trying to keep kids away from drugs.
[55:22.940 --> 55:25.340]  I get that. That's you know, that's solid work.
[55:25.340 --> 55:29.340]  But to send them home with information like that is just wrong.
[55:29.940 --> 55:33.580]  And, you know, then that, you know, then all of a sudden you started hearing rumors
[55:33.580 --> 55:37.020]  about, oh, well, my daddy smokes a cigarette that smells funny.
[55:37.020 --> 55:41.580]  And then the next thing you know, DSS is getting involved with these families.
[55:41.580 --> 55:43.380]  And I was just fucking horrified.
[55:43.380 --> 55:46.940]  And then there's this one time I was I smoke out of a socket
[55:47.460 --> 55:50.460]  because I learned as a young age that you don't want to have joints
[55:50.460 --> 55:52.820]  in your ashtray or roaches in your ashtray.
[55:52.820 --> 55:56.060]  So I would just take a socket and I'd, you know, smoke out of that
[55:56.060 --> 55:58.820]  and throw it in my ashtray when I was done.
[55:58.820 --> 56:03.380]  And any time I got pulled over or hassled by cops, they'd always empty the ashtray.
[56:03.380 --> 56:05.180]  But they'd throw the socket on the ground.
[56:05.180 --> 56:08.340]  They didn't understand it was a one hitter.
[56:08.340 --> 56:11.340]  So I was packing my socket and I turn around and my daughter
[56:11.340 --> 56:14.340]  standing over my left shoulder, right shoulder.
[56:14.980 --> 56:17.700]  And my heart stopped and I was horrified.
[56:17.700 --> 56:20.780]  And that night I went and I threw everything in the dumpster.
[56:20.780 --> 56:22.020]  I'm like, fuck, fuck, weed.
[56:22.020 --> 56:25.020]  I'm not going to allow my children to be taken away from me
[56:25.300 --> 56:27.900]  for fucking smoking a plant. This is fucked up.
[56:28.540 --> 56:32.900]  And so I didn't smoke for probably God till I got divorced,
[56:32.980 --> 56:35.180]  which was back in 08.
[56:35.180 --> 56:38.180]  And, you know, going through a horrible divorce, you know,
[56:38.180 --> 56:42.620]  you're looking for any kind of way to escape the pain of, you know,
[56:42.900 --> 56:45.020]  what that's all about.
[56:45.020 --> 56:48.700]  And a buddy of mine who was, you know, a smoker back in the day,
[56:48.700 --> 56:51.940]  we used to smoke all the time together, you know, came to me and was like,
[56:51.940 --> 56:53.980]  look, dude, you need to fuck calm down.
[56:53.980 --> 56:56.380]  You need to smoke a little weed.
[56:56.380 --> 57:00.420]  And so I started smoking weed again, but I didn't get at the same high.
[57:00.420 --> 57:02.500]  I got, you know, paranoid.
[57:02.500 --> 57:06.300]  I got heart racing, all kinds of, you know, negative effects.
[57:06.300 --> 57:10.020]  So if you do quit for a long period of time, just understand that
[57:10.420 --> 57:14.020]  you're going to have to relearn how to use those muscles
[57:14.020 --> 57:19.380]  so that you're comfortable in society and among around people when you do smoke.
[57:20.100 --> 57:22.460]  And I've learned that for me anyway,
[57:23.260 --> 57:25.380]  just the right amount of scotch first
[57:26.420 --> 57:30.100]  gets rid of all of those negative effects that I would normally have.
[57:30.820 --> 57:34.700]  If I smoke it, you know, straight up during the day or in the evening without it.
[57:35.100 --> 57:39.020]  So that was that was a really good trick that if you are going to get away
[57:39.020 --> 57:42.740]  from smoking for a long period of time, just you got to ease back in it
[57:42.740 --> 57:46.420]  and you got to find the right cultivars or otherwise you're not going to enjoy it.
[57:47.500 --> 57:50.820]  So a little little words of wisdom there for you guys
[57:50.820 --> 57:54.940]  that do want to go on a fast for a period of time, a short period of time.
[57:54.940 --> 57:55.700]  It's not going to do it.
[57:55.700 --> 58:00.500]  But if you go for years, it definitely changes your your ability to metabolize.
[58:02.340 --> 58:04.300]  I believe I don't think I could do that.
[58:04.300 --> 58:06.540]  So you think you could do it for years?
[58:06.540 --> 58:09.060]  What? Quit? Quit smoking weed?
[58:09.060 --> 58:10.940]  No. Yeah.
[58:10.940 --> 58:12.740]  Well, I smoke weed.
[58:12.740 --> 58:14.820]  I could do it for my kids for sure.
[58:14.820 --> 58:16.620]  Well, I don't have anything else.
[58:16.620 --> 58:19.020]  I don't think I could give it up.
[58:19.020 --> 58:22.020]  No, man, I'm a I'm a little uneasy.
[58:22.020 --> 58:23.700]  Let's put it that way.
[58:23.700 --> 58:25.180]  I think we all are. Right.
[58:25.180 --> 58:28.220]  So this is the one thing that kind of lets us go.
[58:28.540 --> 58:30.580]  And yeah, stay mellow.
[58:30.580 --> 58:34.620]  I like I was mentioning, you know, I feel like when you're using it as well as
[58:35.860 --> 58:38.420]  I feel like when I smoke all day, sometimes it is like a crutch.
[58:38.420 --> 58:40.980]  I just want to be in a zone, maybe zone out of the day.
[58:41.740 --> 58:45.060]  Yeah. You know, horrible things happen sometimes and you want to do that.
[58:45.460 --> 58:49.060]  But it definitely seems like when you do, you know, kind of limit things,
[58:49.700 --> 58:53.380]  being able to use it as more of a tool is kind of a cool thing
[58:53.380 --> 58:55.780]  that I feel like I forgot about for a long time.
[58:55.780 --> 58:58.820]  And there's that weird transition when we were all smoking flour
[58:58.820 --> 59:00.220]  and then it went to dabs.
[59:00.220 --> 59:03.100]  And I felt like maybe for a few months there,
[59:03.140 --> 59:06.220]  I was remembering like high school high when you were getting so high
[59:06.220 --> 59:08.260]  that you're like paranoid.
[59:08.260 --> 59:09.660]  I remember my buddy in high school.
[59:09.660 --> 59:10.980]  His name was Billy Leaker.
[59:10.980 --> 59:14.300]  And we went out and smoked this little, little tiny joint right behind his house.
[59:14.300 --> 59:16.460]  And as soon as we hit that joint, man, we're all hanging out.
[59:16.460 --> 59:18.820]  We thought like the FBI was coming.
[59:18.820 --> 59:20.820]  We were running around in this treehouse and shit.
[59:21.620 --> 59:25.060]  And obviously I've never felt that that stoned ever again.
[59:25.060 --> 59:27.220]  I've been chasing that shit my whole life.
[59:27.220 --> 59:30.820]  But dabs are definitely one of those ways where you felt that euphoria.
[59:30.820 --> 59:34.620]  And now I know, Sticky, you can attest to this.
[59:34.620 --> 59:37.980]  When we hang out, dabs are just kind of like hitting a bowl, it seems like.
[59:38.820 --> 59:43.100]  So if you quit for years, I would imagine like to get back to Layton's point,
[59:43.660 --> 59:46.940]  you really need to kind of watch that stuff, because I I couldn't imagine
[59:46.940 --> 59:49.660]  if I quit for three years and then was trying to keep up with you, Sticky,
[59:49.660 --> 59:52.940]  that didn't I'd be sitting there probably in the corner like
[59:53.580 --> 59:56.540]  when we first were doing dabs, kind of being like thinking,
[59:56.700 --> 59:59.980]  think of deep thoughts about life, man, be like, man, I'm high.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:01.540]  Like, I'm like real high.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.420]  Like, that was my first experience with dabs.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.940]  Hold on to the fear.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:07.260]  Yeah.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.900]  My first dab I ever took in Colorado,
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.540]  my friend who works for a glass company around here
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.620]  had the hookup on some what was hashed from the greenest green back in the day.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.140]  And it was just butane hash, but it was tangerine haze.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.020]  And I'll never forget it.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.540]  He said, you want to come take a dab at the house?
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.100]  I went up, took a dab.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.500]  I had to leave in like three minutes.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.500]  I said, all right, buddy, I just met you, but I'm going to leave now.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.820]  He's like, you good? I'm like, I think so.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.940]  And I, you know, I left, but I was driving on these
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.380]  mountainous roads, I felt like I was just peering over the edge,
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.140]  waiting to fall off.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.460]  But it was like a two lane road.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.860]  I mean, I was on the inside lane.
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.660]  It was no big deal.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.900]  I was just super paranoid.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.020]  That was my first dab.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.100]  And after that, it's been smooth sailing.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.500]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:04.140]  So some of the stuff that we really enjoy smoking,
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.340]  you know, a person I can remember.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.860]  Oh, there must be a delay there.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.780]  Go ahead, Leighton.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.660]  Can you hear me, Sticky?
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.060]  I can hear you.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.180]  All right.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.620]  Leighton, can you hear me?
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.180]  Oh, yeah. I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.220]  Are you guys getting glitchy because you guys can't.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.820]  All right. You don't look as crisp as you did.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.700]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.580]  I can hear you.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.780]  But your screen keeps freezing.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:39.450]  I don't know if it's my Internet or what, but.
[01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.410]  All right, well, it's like
[01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:44.250]  when you talk to somebody and you're late and is no longer an age.
[01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:46.930]  I'm going to pop off and pop back on. All right.
[01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:48.690]  All right.
[01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:54.790]  Hey, yeah. So Sticky, let's get into Duke for a little bit.
[01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:57.430]  I know that a lot of people really look up to him.
[01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:01.830]  I know you you and myself definitely look up to him and have no shame
[01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:04.150]  about saying that, you know, I feel like a lot of people
[01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:08.870]  as they start to learn more about cannabis or there's a lot of ego
[01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:12.990]  that comes into that, I think they forget people that have taught them along the way.
[01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.430]  And that's something that I've always admired about you, buddy, is
[01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.110]  you're one of the first people to talk about.
[01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:20.230]  Well, that dude knew about this and this guy to learn from this guy.
[01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.910]  And I feel like Duke is one of the pioneers in teaching
[01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:26.990]  and all out of genuine kindness.
[01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.230]  I've never had him, you know, he's sat there and chopped it up for me
[01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.670]  with hours down south in Colorado.
[01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.110]  Never asked me for anything.
[01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.630]  I've you know, I guess in a way I asked him for something.
[01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.750]  He came up and did an event with us and in in Denver,
[01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.830]  right across from the Bronco Field, knowing where he lives.
[01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.230]  That was quite a trick for him.
[01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.630]  So I just feel like that guy for
[01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:54.190]  for the level of education, the level of farming that he's at,
[01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.950]  the level of respect and love that he has in the community.
[01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:59.510]  That guy is one of the most humble individuals
[01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.030]  that I have personally ever met at the level that he is at.
[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.030]  And I just want to kind of get into that, man, because
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:08.190]  I know Duke will hopefully see this here soon.
[01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.910]  And it's just something that I feel like I would love since you and I have
[01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:15.190]  this opportunity to kind of talk about not only his genetics, but
[01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:19.510]  what that guy really represents, the community, because since he's been locked up,
[01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:21.990]  there's been a lot of foolery going around.
[01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:25.830]  And I feel like there's some fool gaziness going around with some of those genetics.
[01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:27.830]  So let's talk about the tried and true.
[01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:31.230]  And let's not forget that he's one of the originals of why
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.830]  skunk was so popular, in my opinion.
[01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:40.310]  Yeah, I mean, dude has been growing weed for a long time.
[01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:45.030]  Like I said, I talked to him on Breed Bay was the website back in 2005.
[01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.270]  That's where I met him, my introduction to him.
[01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.030]  And then he said, you know, I got to go do a thing for four years and I'll be back.
[01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.950]  That's OK. I forgot about it for four years.
[01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:58.710]  And then fast forward to coming out to Colorado.
[01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:02.750]  I see that he's helped resurrect Brothers Grimm, which I was stoked about,
[01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:08.710]  because as a southerner, you don't see many of those strains, you know, Cinderella 99.
[01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:10.350]  What else did he have?
[01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.630]  He had the cafe girl, Finos, that kind of got discontinued.
[01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.910]  And then, oh, the genius, the Apollo's.
[01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:20.550]  So you didn't see those ever unless you went out west, you know,
[01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.830]  and even then those were pretty new genetics.
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.350]  You didn't.
[01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:26.910]  They weren't passed around like the train wreck
[01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.510]  and the blue dream of today and stuff like that.
[01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:36.870]  But yeah, so I know he was growing the chems and the diesels and the skunks,
[01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:38.270]  and he knows what the deal is.
[01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.710]  I know he knows what the deal is, because I smell that basic skunk number two.
[01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:45.670]  We all smelled it and everybody seems to have forgotten about it
[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.750]  and say he doesn't have the skunk and seed form.
[01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.230]  But they forgot about the basic skunk.
[01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.150]  It's definitely the closest thing I've had in 20 years.
[01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:58.830]  It's not 100 percent skunk is missing that acrid spray,
[01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:02.790]  but it's dank coffee bean and asphalt and earth.
[01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:07.110]  And yeah, a little bit of earth, but coffee being an asphalt for sure.
[01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.790]  It just needs that spray.
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:13.190]  But so with that being said, if you got some of those dead
[01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:17.790]  band seeds, the version one, that's probably the closest thing
[01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:21.670]  I would imagine from his whole lineup, even the dominion skunk.
[01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:24.510]  People didn't really find what they're looking for in that, they say.
[01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.430]  I've seen a few people come up with some good phenos,
[01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.270]  but I haven't seen them in person, so I can't really vouch for them.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.560]  But I know. Go ahead.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.520]  Well, I was just going to add to that, I feel like, especially with those skunk
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.440]  genetics, when you first started growing Duke's gear, you're kind of like,
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.240]  like, oh, shit, especially if you're growing in your basement or something like that.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.240]  Like you kind of forgot of the potency of the you know,
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:54.000]  when you're growing different genetics, there's definitely the outliers,
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  the girls that really stand out.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.080]  And for us, when we were farming Duke's gear,
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.880]  I would say probably six out of the six out of the eight or something
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.920]  of per pack that we were getting or a ten out of the twelve
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.240]  or whatever, whatever we were running of his stuff.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.280]  Really seemed to all shine.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.080]  So it allowed you to pheno hunt some true winners and hopefully try to pick
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.200]  out of maybe like four ones that really seem to be hitters.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.120]  Then narrow that down to maybe one or two and find something that's really unique.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.440]  And again, those those packs that he was selling, it wasn't like he was charging
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.960]  a ridiculous amount of money for him either.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.240]  So he's doing a ton of work for you.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.160]  If you ever checked out his genetics on the back, he would go out of his way
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:43.400]  to kind of express his versions and tips of, you know, growing this certain cultivar.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.600]  He kind of rate the resistance to mold and pest.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.160]  And he was definitely one of the first people I ever saw doing that.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.520]  And the other thing I like about him is his seeds speak for itself.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.760]  He doesn't have hype marketing.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.600]  People just know him of Duke.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.720]  You know, it's not like he's got to have these fancy boxes and go out of his way
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:07.840]  and really go out with a marketing team and come up with the way that the skunk should be.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.760]  That's why I love repping his gear, because it's so basic.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.320]  The seeds are so basic.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.160]  They speak for themselves.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.960]  As far as I know, most of his stuff is black or white or black and white
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.480]  with that little skunk having like a green nook.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.560]  It's super, super basic.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.640]  And that's what I love about it.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.480]  Yeah, I think, you know, as as a East Coaster from kind of the rural areas,
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.160]  he doesn't need anything flashy like that.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.800]  That wouldn't represent who he is.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.160]  But when you talk to the guy and you just ask him some questions
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.760]  about what you're going through with your cannabis journey,
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.880]  you're immediately aware that he's been there before,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.000]  to say it to say the least.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.700]  Yeah, like, you know, one of the things when we did have that event with him,
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.780]  shout out to everybody that was involved in that.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.780]  But, you know, he was the keynote speaker that night
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.900]  and he was kind of just cracking jokes and stuff were, you know,
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.140]  kind of clowning on the audience, being like, look, you guys have been buying
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.540]  yucca extract and cranberry juice for years.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.700]  You know, it's time to kind of start to break this stuff down and maybe not know.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.980]  Especially at that time, I felt like everybody knew how to grow,
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.500]  but a lot of them were still using brand names.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.940]  So they would, you know, rattle off these brand names,
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.700]  not necessarily even knowing what was in that product line.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.060]  And I feel like that's what I took away from Duke
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.220]  when he was talking in Denver is to do the research yourself,
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.660]  find out what's really in those products.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.380]  And you're going to be pissed off, really,
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.740]  when you find out how much money you've been paying for watered down
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.740]  cranberry juice, watered down simple basic nutrients
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.180]  over paying for humics and fulvics at that time.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.580]  There's just a lot of things that I feel like as we continue to learn,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.580]  we can with our money as a community,
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.220]  stop buying certain things that have been ripping the community off
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:00.100]  and continue to put that money into.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.660]  I like to go to like here, at least in Colorado, whole foods and sprouts
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.220]  and finding certain nutrients or natural grocers.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.380]  I mean, there's a variety of of stores here in Denver locally
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.980]  that you could get most of the nutrients that you need
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.340]  without having to ship all that stuff or like we had mentioned
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.020]  at the beginning of the show,
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.700]  taking a full day of driving around to a variety of different places,
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:25.780]  parking your car way in the back, even though all you really had
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:29.700]  was some silly little oyster shell flower or something kind of
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.180]  kind of mundane anyway.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.900]  But that paranoia was still always there.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:37.020]  And I feel like that is something that a lot of people never feel
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.940]  with the paranoia of really moving real weight
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.900]  with someone that you don't know and getting the
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.580]  lack of a better term and the bubble guts when you're
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:48.780]  dealing with the big dogs.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.140]  So, yeah.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:53.060]  Yeah, probably a little too much information.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.620]  No, it's all good.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.380]  Like I told you, Brian, my first trying to move my first pack in in Oregon.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.220]  And I had them in some laundry baskets,
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.820]  so I brought this laundry basket into this guy's house
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.940]  who I didn't really know very well.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.260]  And he's like, here you go.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.140]  And I hand him the laundry basket to check out.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.860]  And he pulls out one bag of weed.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.340]  He pulls out another bag of weed.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.740]  And he pulls out a handgun and he goes, is this yours?
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.860]  I was like, oh, shit. Yeah.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.980]  So. Learning curve for sure with dealing with people you don't know.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.980]  You know, bless that we all made it out of there
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.100]  because I never know ever again.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.820]  No. And, you know,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.220]  there's a whole generation of kids who will never know here in a helicopter
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:44.260]  the way we hear helicopters.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.780]  I never got to that level, but I definitely was paranoid driving.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.700]  Like I had mentioned on I-95, man, that was that was the highway
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.420]  that would pay the bills and we would dress up.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.180]  I think I mentioned this before, like we'd go out of our way and order
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.740]  the the Church of Latter-Day Saints, the Mormon plaques
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:05.700]  and dress with the pressed Mormon shirt, literally take it to the dry cleaner,
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.980]  get it pressed, pants pressed, look the part.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.580]  I definitely would, you know, shave the beard.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.540]  No, no smoking, that kind of stuff.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.780]  And that was the way that you would have to live your life.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.340]  Or I guess we kind of chose to live our life with that kind of way.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.740]  But in Georgia, it's really hard to make money, especially
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.780]  where Sticky and I kind of grew up for a while in our lives.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.620]  Statesboro isn't exactly.
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.300]  There's not a lot of jobs other than like trivial type jobs.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.300]  So I don't know if that's what forces some of us to kind of figure out
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.020]  that I'm just not going to I'm not going to work at Burger King or I just never had.
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.140]  I never felt like that was what I wanted to do.
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.260]  And I definitely would take risk to not have to do something.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.540]  No doubt. Statesboro.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.860]  I mean, we love Statesboro, but let's be honest, man, that's a
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:58.140]  especially with some cities around America.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:02.860]  That is a very small town feel place where everybody knows everybody's business.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.660]  And it's yeah, you're still taking a lot of risk doing that
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.100]  because eventually the wrong person, it seems like a buddy's girlfriend
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.420]  finds out what you're doing and then you're in talk about total paranoia
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.100]  because if they break up, you already know what's probably coming.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.420]  And that's yeah, it was real nerve wracking for me in college
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.500]  growing up in the borough, as we call it, you know,
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.500]  the Allman Brothers recorded a song called the Statesboro Blues.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.820]  And that's my hometown.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.020]  So that's a blind Willie McTell, but.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.340]  You know, I was always the weed guy in my class of people.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.380]  I was always the guy who had the good weed.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.420]  There was other guys who get weed from, but they wouldn't answer
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.060]  their phones as quickly.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.940]  They wouldn't deliver it to you.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:51.260]  It wasn't going to be as good as mine.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.100]  But bear in mind, you were going to pay 60 and eight for sure.
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.420]  So it was just always kind of like that thing.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.780]  And when I got tired of just
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:05.300]  fronting the bill of the the risk,
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.900]  essentially going to Atlanta, driving down 75 and 16.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.220]  I mean, that was that was nerve wracking for me all the time.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:17.180]  Every day I'd go up to Atlanta or every week and go to Atlanta once or twice a week.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:23.860]  So did you always have specific friends who were always like,
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.100]  sorry, man, I don't have 60 bucks this week
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.780]  and you'd have to like keep a ledger of like who owes you money?
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.620]  It was always the same.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.340]  It was friends who you're so annoyed with because you're like,
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.300]  do you know what kind of risk I take to give you like amazing weed
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.980]  at a good price on a weekly basis?
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.380]  And then all you can do is like go into debt to me.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.700]  Yep, I had a buddy like that, and I'm sure I've been that buddy to other people.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.580]  So I guess that's just how it goes.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.140]  Well, to Peter's point, too, I feel like some of those dudes
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:56.180]  would show up the next time and still not have it.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.980]  Oh, yeah. No, I was second from 100 percent.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.380]  Oh, no. Second from two front.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.700]  No, that's a that's a that's a fool me once.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:09.300]  Shame on you.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:14.540]  You sound like, yeah, every time somebody says that makes me think of George Bush
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.780]  when he fumbled that, you know?
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.300]  Oh, yeah. And that Jake also can't get fooled again.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.060]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.980]  But yeah. So, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.420]  Go go into it, man.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.180]  I was just going to say, it seems like I always had to be the weed guy.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.300]  I was always forced to go to Atlanta and get that weed or else it wasn't going
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.020]  to happen. Nobody else I grew up with was doing that shit.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.180]  Well, there wasn't a lot of people taking the risk, and that's what I meant.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.580]  Like, especially, you know, Statesboro, you people find out real quick
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.100]  when you have the good stuff of.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.420]  Oh, yeah. And I'm 37 years old.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.060]  I haven't lived there in 10 years.
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.940]  Almost people still know me as that guy who grew weed out on his farm.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.860]  It was a vegetable farm, but I grew weed on the inside of the house.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.540]  Probably made more money doing that, but it was just to pay the bills.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.980]  Just like a little bit.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.900]  Grow vegetables, you know,
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:11.500]  the cool part of Statesboro for me, too, was there's just
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:14.900]  there's one little block where all the college bars were.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.140]  And so as long as you kind of got to know a few of those people,
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:25.380]  a couple of the bouncers, you would kind of run amok on that little block area.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.500]  Was it like I don't even know anymore?
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.260]  I was like five bars.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.860]  Yeah, I was going to say like six or seven bars.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.740]  It felt like.
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.420]  And the weird thing was, is they were all in that same spot.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.060]  But if you went to like the hot spot that everybody wasn't out on Monday,
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.260]  even though it was right down the street, there'd be nobody at that bar.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.660]  So a really small town where you could just hustle basically.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.380]  I felt like learned to hustle.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.100]  And then when I. Yeah.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.900]  Yeah. I mean, it made a lot of mistakes.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.100]  Shout out to.
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.980]  Shout out to this dude named Jeremy Paulette that got me for a couple
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:01.460]  QPs running down there that he told me he had to go to his car
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.500]  and literally never came back.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.700]  I was calling that boy like I was a broken hearted teenage girl, man.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.300]  I got to call that motherfucker like 56 times.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.500]  Never saw him.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.660]  Never saw him again, man.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:13.820]  So shout out to you.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.860]  Bye, Mr. Paulette.
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.940]  At least you didn't drive to Carrollton from Statesboro to do that same thing.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.100]  Yes. From Statesboro to Atlanta.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.660]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.780]  But you never forget those people's names, you know.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.260]  Here it is.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.580]  I haven't thought about that dude in 25 years, but I still remember his fucking name.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:32.940]  Yeah, I know.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:36.780]  So a lot of that stuff I felt like was learning curve and you just accepted it.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.740]  Like, damn, I got to twenty five hundred bucks like.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.900]  Oh, man. Yeah, those.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.780]  Those like like in the movies, you know, like I'll be right back.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.620]  Oh, OK. We went to high school together.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:51.260]  So it wasn't like I my guard was not up whatsoever.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:57.690]  And he played me like a fiddle, bro.
[01:16:57.690 --> 01:17:02.210]  Yeah, there was a lesson someone taught me many, many years ago, and that is
[01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:06.970]  if you walk up to somebody on the street, stranger and you punch him in the face,
[01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:11.570]  they will always remember you, but you will never remember that.
[01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:13.930]  That's that's what he did.
[01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:18.730]  He punched you fucking square in the face and ran away with your, you know, your half pound.
[01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:21.450]  Yeah, man.
[01:17:22.330 --> 01:17:24.410]  But, hey, you know, that's part of it.
[01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:27.490]  I love the guys that I looked up to.
[01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:30.530]  They laughed at me and was like, hey, you just paying your taxes.
[01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:32.570]  You know, those are our taxes.
[01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:34.730]  You got to learn.
[01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:36.730]  I don't want to forget either.
[01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:39.250]  There's something that I feel like, you know, you're really well known for.
[01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.610]  We're going to share some stories within this as the homegrowers cup.
[01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:47.970]  And I feel like, you know, you kind of in a way have made a few of those guys.
[01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:51.410]  I hope that way it continues when we don't have all these ridiculous things
[01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:52.610]  with covid and that kind of stuff.
[01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:54.530]  We can have a large party again.
[01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:58.010]  But man, that was really taken off in twenty eighteen.
[01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.050]  I felt like you kind of created a spark, man.
[01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:05.730]  And then for Genome Alchemy to emerge the winner as a living soil farmer,
[01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.850]  making his own genetics.
[01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.210]  I feel like you kind of also helped him.
[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:13.530]  You know, you gave him a little catalyst for him for himself to kind of
[01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:18.210]  I wouldn't I don't know if I would use the word legend, but he's becoming a legend
[01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:21.890]  around here, people, more and more people wanting to farm his genetics.
[01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.570]  And I feel like as the years progress, a lot of that is kudos to you, man.
[01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:30.930]  He was able to cultivate cannabis with, I feel like a quality peer group.
[01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:35.930]  You went out of your way to get quality judges to, you know,
[01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:40.330]  really take the time you told us every single day for us to wake up
[01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:41.890]  and and smoke the cannabis.
[01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:45.250]  And you gave us enough time where we were actually able to have like
[01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.010]  I think it was felt like maybe even a month.
[01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:50.450]  Yeah, it was a day of strain, basically.
[01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:51.890]  Day of strain. Yeah.
[01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:54.650]  And so I've you just went out of your way, man,
[01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:58.970]  even with the I guess we will, even with the high, high times,
[01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:01.690]  cups and stuff nowadays, that's all bullshit, man.
[01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:05.250]  That shit isn't judged the same way that that I feel like you went
[01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:08.770]  and your crew at that time went through to really make this something
[01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:11.250]  that was peers judging peers.
[01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:15.090]  And from that point on the next year, you had
[01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:17.810]  AJ from Growing Organic.
[01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:21.370]  He was also working at Build a Soil with Jeremy Silva, another guy
[01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:24.250]  that I feel like on his own right, obviously doing his own stuff.
[01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:27.290]  But there are there's a reason why that type of gentleman
[01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:30.570]  wanted to enter your contest is because everybody here in Denver
[01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:34.490]  knew that it was prestigious, knew that you were going out of your way
[01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:39.850]  to make it as best as you could appear reviewed cannabis cup.
[01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.250]  So I wanted to kind of get into that.
[01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:45.290]  I wanted to kind of talk about why you went out of your way to do that.
[01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:49.010]  And again, I'm probably one of the biggest fans of that.
[01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:52.330]  So I hope that we get to see that again in the next coming years.
[01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.970]  I do, too, man.
[01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:57.330]  I enjoyed doing the Home Growers Cup.
[01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:00.490]  There was not a lot of reward financially for it.
[01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:04.290]  So I'll just say that right out front for anybody who thinks I was doing it for money.
[01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:06.170]  Got the wrong idea, buddy.
[01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.370]  I lost money the first run and made a few hundred the second run.
[01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:14.890]  So thanks to our sponsors, first of all, Build a Soil, Root Wise Organics
[01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:16.530]  or Soil Dynamics.
[01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.330]  I'm sorry. I always say that.
[01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:21.130]  But, you know, those guys were in it for the long haul.
[01:20:21.130 --> 01:20:23.130]  I'm sure if we had another one, they'd be there for us.
[01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:27.650]  But yeah, the Home Growers Cup started out as a joke between me and some guy on Facebook.
[01:20:27.650 --> 01:20:32.490]  He said his I think his blue dream was better than my Scooby Snacks or something like that.
[01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:33.930]  And I said, OK, buddy, whatever.
[01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:34.850]  I kind of blew him off.
[01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:38.170]  I said, well, let's you know, you come down from the mountains in Colorado.
[01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:39.610]  We'll meet in Denver.
[01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:41.050]  You put two hundred dollars up.
[01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:42.930]  I'll put two hundred dollars up.
[01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:46.250]  The winner of our peer reviewed weed gets that four hundred dollars.
[01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:49.130]  And then we know whose weed is better.
[01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:51.530]  You know, simple, simple, simple, simple.
[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.450]  And we'd have a little party to do it, too.
[01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.290]  Well, he never showed up, but we had the party anyway.
[01:20:56.690 --> 01:21:03.650]  And we I think we had 18 or 20 entries the first year in 2018.
[01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.370]  Yeah, just a bunch of people I'd never heard of.
[01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.970]  Genome Alchemy being one of them.
[01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:17.090]  And it turns out the first year we didn't have enough samples for me to even sample the entries.
[01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:23.010]  So I just kind of saw them on intake and then passed them out to the judges.
[01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:30.490]  The second year, we actually had enough sample or enough of the entries to sample at the show.
[01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:34.050]  So people got to smoke what was entered at the show.
[01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:39.130]  Or the the reveal or whatever you want to call it, the party.
[01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:43.130]  But yeah, it was a great time both years.
[01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:48.050]  I think we learned a lot from doing that event about organizing events.
[01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:49.410]  I'm not an event organizer.
[01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:50.970]  I'm not organized at all.
[01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:54.570]  I'll give a shout out to my boy Zach Bonacci.
[01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:55.650]  I hope he's watching.
[01:21:56.050 --> 01:22:04.010]  He was a big hand in that from the graphics to the computer stuff to the let's say negotiating with the venue.
[01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:09.570]  They wanted to take 50 percent of our sponsorship if they got a sponsor for us.
[01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.130]  And he said, oh, yeah, that's cool.
[01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:11.530]  That's cool.
[01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:12.610]  I said, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:12.930 --> 01:22:13.690]  That's not cool.
[01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:14.970]  That's not cool at all.
[01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:17.890]  But that's always a joke to me and him.
[01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:24.290]  So, yeah, hopefully we can do this sooner or later with covid restrictions and whatnot in place.
[01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:30.970]  Yeah, and so you went out of your way, you know, you gave you gave us 30 days to judge the stuff.
[01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:40.410]  You had people from all over the country, a few people that I know kind of, you know, went out of their way to come and pick up their judges kits and all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:48.810]  There was a story we could, I guess, regret, but we decided we are going to share this story because it's kind of funny and it happened.
[01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:49.770]  So, hey, whatever.
[01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:54.650]  But there's a few people in this story that are silly, man.
[01:22:54.650 --> 01:22:58.370]  And so what's his name?
[01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:02.730]  Brothers Grimm is over there getting his photos taken.
[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:04.250]  Give a background.
[01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:05.450]  We have a we have a draw.
[01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:06.130]  Oh, yeah, buddy.
[01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:06.930]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:08.850]  You should tell me it's your thing.
[01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:11.490]  I was just there to kind of like co-sign that this shit happens.
[01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:12.850]  OK, OK.
[01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:14.890]  So we have the drop off one day.
[01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:23.730]  All the contestants come and they bring their weed in their jars and we split it up and put it in the several jars for the judges.
[01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:25.090]  Well, 30 minutes elapses.
[01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:26.610]  All the contestants have cleared out.
[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:28.290]  The judges start showing up.
[01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:35.730]  You know, so Grimm shows up, he's got his cowboy hat on, he's doing his doing his urban cowboy thing.
[01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:36.810]  Shout out, soul.
[01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:38.610]  You out there listening?
[01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:40.090]  Hey, my boy.
[01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:45.090]  But he's doing his cowboy thing with our photographer.
[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:52.810]  And they're doing that in the corner, you know, take his pictures for the the judges like profiles.
[01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:58.490]  And then we see this guy come in, this older gentleman, he keeps asking everybody who they are.
[01:23:58.690 --> 01:23:59.370]  Are you?
[01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:00.490]  He doesn't ask who they are.
[01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:02.410]  He asked if they're a specific person.
[01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.410]  He asked if they're terpene.
[01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:05.770]  Are you terpene?
[01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:07.010]  I said, no, I'm sticky lungs.
[01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:08.010]  I organize this event.
[01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:08.570]  Who are you?
[01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.090]  I'm JJ Top Dog Seeds.
[01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:13.690]  So it's OK, that's kind of weird.
[01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:15.730]  You're asking me if I'm terpene, but whatever.
[01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:20.530]  And I continually hear him ask everybody who comes in if they're terpene or not.
[01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:23.450]  And then terpene shows up, who is actually a judge.
[01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:27.010]  He was the first person to reach out to me, by the way, about being a judge.
[01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:29.370]  So I said, yeah, sure, you can be a judge.
[01:24:29.610 --> 01:24:31.050]  I didn't know who this guy was at all.
[01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:33.970]  I didn't know he had a longstanding feud with Top Dog.
[01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.690]  Well, I asked Top Dog to be a judge as well.
[01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.770]  They both. Agreed.
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:45.450]  So terpene and Top Dog are introduced to each other and then.
[01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:48.210]  Hair starts flying, basically.
[01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:51.730]  I'll let let's see, what do you see from your perspective, Brian?
[01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:53.450]  I saw are you terpene?
[01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:55.370]  Whack and a punch being thrown.
[01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.170]  Not really landing very cleanly, though.
[01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:04.010]  Let's be clear about the punch, too, because it was kind of a bitch move.
[01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.290]  He the terpene introduced himself to another gentleman.
[01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:11.810]  He put out his hand and he said, hello, I'm terpene.
[01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:15.610]  And then JJ from across the room beelined it, said you're terpene.
[01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:18.770]  And then punched him in the back of the head, to be honest with you.
[01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:20.850]  That's what pretty weak.
[01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:22.970]  And then chaos ensued.
[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:24.970]  And it was kind of funny to see.
[01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:26.810]  You know, I'll kind of let you take it from there.
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:29.210]  But yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:32.250]  So from that point on.
[01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:35.330]  So telling everybody to stop, hey, you guys, chill out over there.
[01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:36.810]  But he's still taking his pictures.
[01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:38.810]  So that's kind of funny part of the story.
[01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:41.210]  Yeah, that's Mr.
[01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:44.650]  So and by the way, he's not just taking pictures like he's over there like,
[01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:46.370]  oh, yeah, I'm a cowboy.
[01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:47.890]  Oh, yeah, I'm a cowboy.
[01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:49.770]  You know, like going to his work.
[01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.970]  Way to like he was working there.
[01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:54.170]  You know how these guys like tease each other.
[01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:56.130]  Like that's how I felt like he was doing his photos.
[01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:58.770]  Like it was a prom night or something.
[01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:00.690]  Yeah. While all this is going on, by the way.
[01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:04.010]  Yeah, he's working it over there in the corner with Turpgon
[01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.770]  as he takes his photos and then.
[01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:11.170]  Turpfein and JJ are squabbling around and people are getting in between them.
[01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:14.010]  I'm being pushed out of the way, saying, you know, get out of the way
[01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.770]  so I can do this to that person or whatever, and I separate them.
[01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:19.810]  I get Turpfein on the other side of the warehouse.
[01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:22.010]  JJ's on this side of the warehouse.
[01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:26.210]  I think by that time, JJ was almost in tears, if I remember correctly.
[01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:32.810]  Yeah, I have a problem saying that this whole thing seemed very beta bitch
[01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:36.690]  to to its core, so that's why it's fun sharing the story.
[01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:37.970]  Yeah, it was funny.
[01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:40.330]  I was just trying to have a party with a drop off a weed
[01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:43.890]  where the judges could come scoop it up and we could all kind of fellowship,
[01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:44.930]  if you will.
[01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:47.570]  But one person used it as an opportunity to,
[01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.410]  I guess, squash an Internet beef.
[01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:53.610]  Unbeknownst to me.
[01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:55.810]  Sucker punch somebody and then chase them around the room,
[01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:56.730]  because that's what I saw.
[01:26:56.730 --> 01:27:00.490]  And then the reason why we're telling this story is because homeboy pulled a knife.
[01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.810]  And now it was a bit of his party.
[01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:04.810]  It was a box cutter.
[01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:06.530]  But hey, whatever.
[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.370]  It's sharp object.
[01:27:08.370 --> 01:27:10.610]  I guess that's why you wear carpenter jeans there,
[01:27:10.610 --> 01:27:13.170]  so you can keep your box cutter in them at the weed party.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.220]  But I don't know.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.740]  I don't know if that's probably as fun for others, but it was crazy
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.780]  to be something or I feel like sometimes a lot of us look up
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.940]  to certain individuals.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.260]  And when you see him in real life, you that was one of those moments.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.740]  You know, just a few years ago, High Times, I called him one of the top breeders.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.620]  And anytime I've ever had any interaction with him,
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.060]  he is nothing but rude, condescending
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.300]  and just thinks of himself and only of himself, it seems like.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.540]  So shout out to you, buddy, for for doing that.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:53.500]  I have no idea why you did that, but it definitely ruined an entire day.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.820]  And I felt like you were trying to ruin the entire homegrowers cup, man.
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:01.780]  It was a selfish move to just come up there and sucker punch somebody.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.620]  And then especially at that level, bro, pull out a knife is just comical.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.340]  So that's why putting putting you on blast, man.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.060]  I have no problem saying that today.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.140]  And I felt like once Sticky said that he was going to co-sign it.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:15.900]  I know that you're going to hear this, man.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.340]  And I know you're probably going to be upset.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.940]  So you probably come sucker punch us in the back of the head one day, too.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.420]  So we're ready for that, though.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.780]  I'll take my sucker punch.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.340]  It was a ridiculous time.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.940]  Had a good time up until then.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:31.220]  Had a good time after that.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.340]  The party was cool.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.260]  He was not there.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.260]  Turfine, unfortunately, couldn't come either because I didn't know
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.860]  which one of them was going to show up and start shit.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:41.660]  So they neither one of them showed up to the party.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.380]  The real problem with that was JJ scoring.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.980]  He didn't exactly follow directions on the scoring system.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.300]  So we kind of had to do some backwards math on his
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:58.100]  on his fractions that he gave us instead of legit scores
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.100]  just to make his scores count.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.160]  Yeah, so that today on Wendy Williams.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.640]  Yeah, a nice little discussion.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.040]  But yeah, man, and I feel like, you know, we clown on Rick, too.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:16.680]  And I have no problem clowning on him as well, because you got to pay our boy.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.640]  It's yeah, he does.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.600]  You're the you're the baby of cash money records.
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.200]  And you don't pay your employees.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.240]  So what was it, Rick Ross?
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.240]  Can please all producers get paid?
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.880]  All breeders need to get paid.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.000]  And we will scream that from the mountaintops, man,
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.440]  because you pretend like you have no idea what we're talking about,
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.160]  especially when we call you out at some of those indo expos.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.720]  You just turn your head and put your head down and try to talk to other individuals.
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.280]  So I guess today, man, we put some people on blast, but it feels good
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.040]  to eventually talk like this, man, because it's really hard.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.360]  I feel like when you grew up in a certain way, usually when people do stuff,
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:58.960]  it was handled in a certain way.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.000]  And as you get older, I feel like as your emotional IQ.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.280]  Yeah, I can't handle it.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.880]  Yeah, you just can't handle it in the same ways.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:07.800]  No, you can't.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.240]  You know, and we're in we're in a gray market area type thing
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.720]  where you can't really take legal repercussions against people.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.120]  There's a lot of shadiness that goes on in this industry.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.840]  I just advise everyone who's buying seeds
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.120]  or buying weed from a dispensary with a certain breeder or so and so.
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:26.920]  Just do your.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.840]  Do your due diligence on who you're supporting.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.280]  Yeah, I love Stardogs.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.080]  It's a great strain.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.480]  I'll never buy any Stardog seeds.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.000]  Let's see.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.880]  You know, there's there's a lot of things that go on in this industry,
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.000]  people have no clue about, and if we didn't mention them on today's show
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.920]  or, you know, in smaller groups, people wouldn't know about them ever.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.880]  It would go unseen, unheard of,
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.480]  and people would still be flying as high as they think they are.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.960]  When they're really scumbags, so it's kind of my take on it.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.880]  Yeah, and I feel like we could we could probably Wendy Williams it up
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.920]  with other stuff, but we just kind of wanted to highlight a few of those
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:13.560]  because I don't feel like enough people know about those things.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.000]  And hopefully after this show, you know, the right people do find out and
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.720]  hopefully, you know, we influence that and we put some people on blast.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:25.040]  I feel like maybe needed to definitely needed to be.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.080]  Yeah, and you know, like I say, I keep supporting or I keep
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.240]  emphasizing and supporting people with transparency,
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.040]  people who are doing good things, people who let you know they're doing good things,
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.320]  not people who brag about doing good things, but people you find out to do
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.160]  good things and.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.880]  Just be careful where your money goes.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.400]  Yeah, well said, man, I feel like
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.360]  maybe we can educate more people so that they support more of like the genome
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.680]  alchemies and the growing organics family individuals
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.600]  that are really putting the money where their mouth is.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.880]  I think I've told the audience this probably five times now.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.920]  If you go to genome alchemies house during the spring or summer,
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.120]  his house sticks out like you would not believe.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.600]  I mean, every square inch of that shit is growing.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.600]  Something is so beautiful to see.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.600]  And just to see a guy that's able to do that, you know, he does
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.840]  obviously have an HOA that doesn't allow that allows him to do that kind of stuff.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.400]  And then, of course, growing organic.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.160]  I mean, that's just another guy that lives and breathes it.
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.440]  We've had both of those dudes on the show,
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:31.400]  and I think they are the epitome of kind of how you carry yourself.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.120]  Those guys are can't say enough about those guys.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.960]  Like the way that they carry themselves, the respect that they give to others as well
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.720]  is second to none.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.600]  And I feel like if you're in the cannabis industry here in Denver,
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.320]  you definitely know who those two guys are.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.360]  And there's a reason why amongst all our peers here in Denver, both those dudes,
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.920]  the GMO cut and what was the other stuff?
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:56.880]  I forget what genome alchemy had his own.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.400]  Yeah, Fantasia Fantasia.
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.200]  Yeah. So, I mean, they're doing their own work.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.960]  Oh, it was a.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:09.440]  Yeah, that was Fantasia, I think was Kerpel Fantasy Times Platinum Tesla,
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:11.160]  if I remember correctly.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.480]  And that's exactly right.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.640]  And you're rain man with it, man.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.640]  But the platinum Tesla was what genome created.
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.600]  So he crossed out with the Kerpel Fantasy that he sprouted, I think,
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.680]  or a clone he got.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.480]  I can't remember.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.680]  But that was cool to see him win because out of the whole entry field,
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.520]  there was maybe five guys doing soil, I think,
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.480]  you know, some of them were doing soil with inorganic nutrients.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.280]  And then here comes genome.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.120]  I've never heard of this guy.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.640]  His test at 18.76 percent or something like that.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.640]  And we got the test results back and thought.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.120]  This one, 18 percent, one.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:55.960]  18 percent doesn't sound too high to me, but then when you see the weed,
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.120]  you're like, oh, that's a funky weed for sure.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.320]  And all the judges said the effect was, you know, through the roof.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.000]  As far as pronounced, that was one of the parameters
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.120]  that the judges were required to judge on was the effect.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.360]  You know, I got you, but I want to have it here.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.040]  You know, these kids got to get woken up.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.360]  They go into the dispensary and they're buying shit based on THC.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:26.920]  Some of the best weed I've ever smoked in my life did not have through the roof.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.840]  THC was 15, 17, 18 percent.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.400]  But the effect was amazing.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.360]  Wasn't a couch lock. It was a great,
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.720]  you know, perspective high, not a not a just wash out.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.800]  And I don't think they get it.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.920]  I don't I don't think they understand that that, you know, the higher the THC
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.560]  doesn't mean the higher the quality of the of the smoke or the cannabis.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.760]  And absolutely.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.800]  You know, that's just another big misnomer that, oh,
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.160]  you just got to buy the highest stuff.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.560]  It's a shame that these kids don't understand that they're
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.720]  they're missing out on so much.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.320]  And it does not surprise me that an 18 one.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.400]  And I'm sure that if you did, you did you actually get them tested
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.600]  like the full profile so you knew what the other cannabinoids
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.400]  that were involved in the in the profile and the turps?
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.280]  I cannot remember if the first year we had the terpenes tested.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.200]  I don't think we did. I think it was just the.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.440]  Just believe you had it on the second year.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.720]  Yeah, the second year, the good thing you did it.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.920]  Yeah, we tried to have more more features on it.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.680]  The good lab that are testing for the competition.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.880]  They're down in Colorado Springs.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:40.360]  If you guys have any testing needs of your home, grow and stuff like that.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.440]  Shoot them a message.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.560]  They'll get you taken care of.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.320]  But they what was that?
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.760]  I was going to say, so the first year, was it the 18 that won or was it
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.000]  the second year?
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.560]  The first year was 18 percent.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.880]  The second year is kind of a funny story about that, because Kevin Dirk
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.400]  from Root Wise Soil Dynamics, he got there a little early.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.480]  I think he was kind of relishing the day as a lot of us were.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.840]  So he got there a little early and was setting up with us.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.280]  And he he asked where the samples were, the entries.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.720]  And I said over here, you know, so we walked over there and
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.160]  he didn't know anything about the letters because the letters
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.320]  had been translated from the number entry or the entry numbers.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.000]  So he had no clue about any of that.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.160]  There was no way entry number 14 could have told him he was letter.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.160]  So and so, you know.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.480]  He walks over to these jars and picks up one jar and goes, this is the winner.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.480]  And I just looked at my buddy who was doing the cup with me, Zach,
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.360]  and I kind of laughed because it was indeed the winner that we knew about
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.080]  because we had done the scores prior to the day of.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.000]  And Kevin just picked it out based on his nose.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.960]  He said, I could smell that one through all the other jars.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.240]  He could locate the smell, too, which is funny.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.200]  But it was indeed the one that stood out.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:03.240]  Yeah, it really stood out.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.160]  And again, Kevin is I kind of put him up there with you, bud.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.920]  You know, I mean, there's certain people that really stand up with the knowledge.
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.800]  And well, some people just have that nose and that memory.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.280]  The nose knows, man.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.160]  Yeah, it was nervous.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.360]  Well, you got to have the memory, too, right?
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.480]  Yeah, there's a ton of people that I see them and they'll say like, yeah,
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:24.440]  this is cross with this and then they got to Google.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.360]  Oh, it was this.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.160]  But now with sticky lungs, Mr.
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.080]  Google strange.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.720]  Maybe that's what you should you should be known for, man,
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.640]  is you got to come up with a proper leafly, you know,
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.480]  like go out of your way to really build that shit out, man.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.960]  I think that's the ad revenue.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.320]  I'm taking you get me courses I can teach you, brother.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.720]  I know I got a computer now, so, hey.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:56.440]  By the way, if you guys are doing self-education, you Demi, check that out.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.960]  You can learn almost anything.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.360]  They sponsored it.
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360]  I'm just kidding.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.520]  But it's something that I feel like you guys, if you want to
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.000]  take, take certain knowledge, man, it's I can't speak enough of it.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.800]  And then they have these little sales where the that hundred and eighty
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.320]  nine dollar course every now and then it'll be like twelve ninety nine.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.360]  So, again, pennies on the dollar, that's something that we always try to preach here.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.880]  But you guys can take your cannabis or take, you know, educate yourself
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.400]  on a variety of things, learn to build websites.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.200]  I know I taught myself from you, Demi, how to build a website,
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.720]  how to build a Shopify website.
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.600]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.000]  I'm saying all this for sticky, too, because I know that
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.640]  I want you to do something like that, man.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.640]  I know that you could have your own business.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.120]  I love to see people that want to be entrepreneurs.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.120]  You do something, man.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.360]  Take a dab right now is what I'm going to do.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.080]  There you go.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.520]  You know what they say about entrepreneurs?
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.360]  You got to be a gambler because that's what it's all about.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.760]  You're betting on yourself.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.320]  But, you know, you are betting on yourself.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:03.520]  Chances are you will win.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.960]  You know, that's that's some good advice about it.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.280]  But you got to have you got to have motivation, too.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.760]  And don't expect to be friggin nine to five.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.960]  Now you work for years building that up for sure.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.280]  But I feel like it's just so rewarding, man.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.000]  Yeah. And here in Denver, you know, sticking in, I'm sure out in California
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:24.840]  where you guys are, too.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.720]  I mean, there's not a lot of people that seem like they can keep up
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.800]  with the rising housing costs and stuff.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.320]  And so I feel like you got to you got to find a skill set
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.680]  or find a little extra hustle or something that you know you can do.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.360]  So I'm just always giving out, you know, always hoping that people educate
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.040]  themselves. I feel like that's another way.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.200]  I would like to see a lot more people
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.640]  have little businesses or something like that.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.160]  But even Peter, man, with his dag of love, you know, I mean, there's just ways
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.640]  that you can find a passion project like Peter has.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.760]  And this thing has grown overwhelmingly in over a year.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:01.920]  I know you.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.760]  Except when the payment processor shut you down.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.720]  Well, that's the C game, baby.
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.560]  I don't everybody.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.160]  We're actually actually what I've been doing while you guys have been doing this
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.680]  is talking to my brother about like we're moving the website.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:16.600]  He's like, check.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.480]  I'm like logging in, checking, making sure everything looks right.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.520]  But why I came on was you were about you were dabbing.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.240]  And I thought we could have some music, some relevant music while you're.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.200]  Oh, I could dab again.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.240]  I actually just actually he's watching the show.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:38.160]  I was outside smoking some kind genetics from Hawaii.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.840]  I appreciate it.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.520]  Nice. Let me give me one second.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:50.920]  Start that dab back up.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.440]  So anytime you hang out with sticky, he shows up with the best
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.800]  looking shit you've ever seen.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.400]  And then when he shows up again, he has even better shit
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.360]  than he showed up the last time.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.520]  We got mama.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.320]  Can you hear that?
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.440]  We got mama.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.680]  Daniel, I'm down low.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.920]  Have you got the nerve to drive Papa Mike tell from your door?
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.320]  My mom, daddy, let me wreck this.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.360]  My daddy, daddy, let me wow.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.120]  Wow.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.600]  Mother, daddy, let me wreck this.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.680]  Daddy, daddy, let me wow.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.160]  Wow.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.720]  Wow.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:42.840]  No, I'm not going to look at some sweet woman's angel.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.400]  She's a mighty mean woman.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.680]  You mean this way?
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.200]  You're the mighty mean woman.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.160]  You mean this way?
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.560]  When I leave this time, pretty mom, I'm going away to stay.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:07.080]  I love the woman better than I've ever seen.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.720]  I want another one better than I've ever seen.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.400]  Treating me like I'm a king and she was a dog gone clean.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.560]  So what'd you burn there, Sticky?
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.560]  Oh, tell your brother.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.920]  Brother, tell your aunt and I and tell your uncle.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.560]  You hear me?
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.400]  Yeah. OK.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.320]  The music takes me back, though.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.400]  I know.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.680]  Hang out with your grandpa.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.520]  My grandpa wouldn't have been listening to anything like that.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:41.280]  He was not very musically inclined.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.360]  I don't think he was kind of a stick in the mud.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:47.960]  Yeah, my grandfather loved that kind of music.
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:51.720]  My grandfather on my father's side gave me my first guitar lesson.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.080]  He was pretty cool.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.480]  But yeah, I was.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:59.320]  Banana Punch number four, I believe it's called.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.680]  From a certain hash company in Denver, Colorado.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.920]  Right on, dog.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.680]  Yeah.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.120]  So do you kind of want to open it up to questions?
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.680]  And yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.400]  I'd love for people to kind of even get into the genetics side of things.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.680]  Sure.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.320]  So are you going to are you going to do the home cup again?
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.920]  Home Growers Cup, I would love to.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.840]  It kind of depends on two things.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:37.680]  I guess finding a venue that can facilitate in the size crowd we're looking to have.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:43.920]  Which is just under 150 people, I think in Denver, if you have more than that might be in Boulder County,
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:50.480]  but something along the lines of 150 people is what you can have at a party without a special permit.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.160]  So we're going to look for a place we can have a small party, but smoke friendly.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.840]  That's the challenge.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.240]  So if you got any leads, shoot them my way.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.320]  And it is a challenge because the place that used to be here, it was called Cultivated Synergy.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.600]  Because of COVID, they are no longer in business.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.760]  And they were literally like the only place that I feel like had classy events where you didn't.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:23.000]  There's other places here in Denver, but it just doesn't have that same vibe where you have like a,
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.440]  you know, you want to get all your friends and hang out at that certain venue.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:31.440]  And it was large enough to have fun and they let you definitely burn down in there.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.840]  Yeah, it's a private party.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.640]  So everybody that shows up has to be on the guest list type thing for legality purposes.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.840]  But they definitely knew what they had going and they charged a premium for it.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:50.040]  That's why we kind of, you know, besides them not being there anymore, wouldn't go there anymore.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.480]  Anyways, I don't think we can't afford to.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.200]  Yeah, they always charge us three grand before anything open.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.760]  Before you even open the doors or had staff or staff would be smoking weed in the back.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.120]  There's some good suggestions here.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.720]  Green's got us.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.560]  Love you, girl.
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:10.520]  She's talking about color up and she wants to help.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.720]  So and then there was another comment about why not do it on private property?
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.040]  If you're doing it on private property, they can't fucking touch you.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.320]  So you just need somebody that has a rent a place.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:31.480]  Yeah, we looked at a place as a hemp farm out in Longmont, Colorado, but they kind of backed out on us last minute in 2019.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:35.560]  But, you know, you can't let that kind of stuff get you down when you're planning an event.
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:39.160]  You're going to hear a lot of no's and a lot of you can't do this and you can't do that.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.160]  You just got to filter out what's legal and what you really can do.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.960]  All right, Katie Peterson, she's on it.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.520]  She's going to make a couple of calls for you.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.480]  Hey, I can vouch for that.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:57.600]  If Katie gets on it, dude, you're going to find that girl is that girl is more connected than all three of us put together.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.920]  She got everybody loves her, too.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:06.400]  I don't think anybody I've never heard anybody have anything other than kindness.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.440]  So shout out to Katie.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.760]  Shout out to Joe.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.000]  Beautiful family.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:17.280]  You know, there's there's a lot of stuff that I feel like sticky, you know, getting into those questions, that kind of stuff, man.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.680]  Is there anything that you kind of I know you were saying, like when we were chopping it up, hey, where's some of the gold nuggets?
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.920]  And you were saying like, hey, you know, I don't like to use nitrogen past a certain level.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:29.640]  I don't want to foiler certain things like that.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:35.840]  I kind of wanted to quickly let you give your gold nuggets and your gold bars and then get into that.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:46.720]  All right. I mean, I just think my main approach with cannabis and farming in particular is low and slow, much like a barbecue.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:53.160]  Or, you know, a smoker low and slow because you can't add everything you need at once.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:57.680]  If you do, it's going to be pretty nutrient rich soil.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:05.680]  You know what I mean? And cannabis doesn't require that much nutrients, in my opinion, compared to to, you know, broccoli.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:15.920]  I don't know other tomatoes or we talked about similar things, but I even think the the amount of fertilizer tomatoes can take is higher
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.000]  than what cannabis takes before it starts to burn.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.880]  So I always say low and slow, just add a little bit, go from there.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:31.160]  If it says if you're using bottled nutrients and it says use three teaspoons per gallon, use one teaspoon per gallon.
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.720]  See how good that does. You might be surprised.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.760]  It might actually do better in the long run than if you're using three teaspoons a gallon every time.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:47.280]  If you're using like organic fertilizer, do your research as far as where that stuff has come from.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.400]  Is it chicken manure? Is it quail manure?
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:48:01.200]  You know, if it's chicken manure and you're in the South and you got a bag of chicken manure, chances are it came from a broiler house where they feed the chickens arsenic.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:10.840]  And then that's in the manure and then you're feeding heavy metals to your cannabis, which uptakes heavy metals, as we know, pretty largely for a for a plant.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.880]  So do your research as far as the cleanliness of your inputs, be stringent.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:26.520]  Make sure if you need to, you send off some tests before you add a bunch of kelp mill into your soil or something like that.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:29.680]  Maybe it came from somewhere with toxins in it.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.600]  You know, you got toxins in your kelp mill and you added a bunch to it.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:33.200]  What do you do now?
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.080]  You got toxins in your soil.
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.080]  All you had to do was test it first, maybe.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:53.800]  But yeah, I say hearkening back to what we were talking about with Duke on the back of his packs of his seeds, and he always says median fertility requirements for his plants or they throw bananas or hermaphrodites or whatever you want to call them.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:07.440]  I say the same thing like medium at most low or medium cannabis, low or medium fed cannabis to me is going to smoke smoother than pumped up nutrient cannabis.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:14.880]  So I just kind of like to go easy on all that stuff, see how little I can get by without diminishing returns.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.400]  And it's been quite an experience.
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:28.920]  You know, I've ran, I guess in 2017 we were experimenting with the living soil in our basement and I went three runs without adding any potassium.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:37.640]  What three runs turned out to be too many runs for like real good buds because the potassium was missing.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.920]  I feel in that last run, the buds were lighter.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.440]  They weren't as heavy.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.040]  So yeah, low and slow, baby.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:50:03.080]  No, that's such a low and slow and don't be a moron from Layton and you almost got a full wisdom for your day that would fit on like a Chinese fortune cookie kind of thing, you know, slow and slow and grow all that.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.960]  And I love the fact that you're talking about know your sources.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.480]  I mean, so many people just randomly buy shit without even doing the homework.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:12.840]  And that's when they get in trouble.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:27.320]  And understanding that, you know, if you're going to use organic natural inputs like flower, oyster flower meal, feather meal, if you don't have good biology, it's not going to get broken down and released to the plant.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:35.760]  So, you know, that's a really big piece of this that a lot of people are missing is they throw a bunch of organic amendments at it and nothing happens.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.560]  And then like, oh, well, organics doesn't work.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.080]  And they go right back to the bottle again.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.280]  And then they follow the directions.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.760]  And like Sticky said, man, all you're doing is add more salts.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.840]  You're ruining your soil.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.000]  Plus, if you overfeed, you're making your plants susceptible to pests, infestation.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:58.320]  You're making it weak and easy to easy to get infected, whether it's fungal or insect.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.640]  So, yeah, definitely low and slow.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.680]  Dude, love those words.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.720]  There's your nugget audience.
[01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:08.350]  Can you see that?
[01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.710]  Yeah, I can see that.
[01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.110]  Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.710]  I don't.
[01:51:12.710 --> 01:51:15.750]  I find them to be a little expensive for what it is.
[01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:28.230]  Without getting into any kind of like weirdness, I just think there maybe there's some cadmium in there, I think is what it was when we did some tests one time.
[01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.750]  So.
[01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:39.790]  Not not a lot, and this is the thing with like the top one percent or five percent, I can't remember what it is, maybe let's just say it's five percent soil in America.
[01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:50.110]  There's always going to be this level of heavy metals in it, even the cleanest top top cleanest five percent of soil in America.
[01:51:50.150 --> 01:51:51.790]  There's a certain amount of heavy metals.
[01:51:52.150 --> 01:52:03.830]  And now in cannabis production, like say on the legal market, they're saying you can't have X amount of heavy metals, you know, but the cleanest soil in America doesn't even qualify for that either.
[01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:13.910]  So there's a lot of things that are kind of weird about cannabis nowadays, but you got to getting back to it, you got to know what you're putting into your soil before you put it on there.
[01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:15.710]  There's no taking it back up.
[01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:19.870]  It's like salt into a meal.
[01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:29.510]  That's why I kind of got more into vermicomposting is because I was buying dairy cow manure from a company out in California.
[01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:32.910]  And for whatever reason, the consistency wasn't there.
[01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:37.070]  And I felt like something, it seemed like something poisoned all of my plants.
[01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:41.270]  And then from that day point on, I was like, man, I'm going to do this myself.
[01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:52.630]  I want to know, you know, what I'm putting in and overpaying for compost at that time and then having it ruin one of your flips is another kick in the gut kind of thing.
[01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:54.070]  And it's really hard to recover.
[01:52:54.070 --> 01:53:04.270]  I feel like when you're first getting into this and you put months and months of time into something and one of your inputs just destroys your entire, entire grow.
[01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.670]  Yeah.
[01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:10.670]  I killed a, uh, probably a six foot plant in June in Oregon.
[01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:13.910]  I put unfinished leaf mold compost on it.
[01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:22.390]  I was probably 22 years old and, uh, it ate the stem right to the middle and just killed this beautiful 30 foot plant.
[01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:23.790]  And I was like, oh man.
[01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:26.150]  So yeah.
[01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.990]  It's crazy.
[01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.310]  Peter, you had a question.
[01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:31.150]  I saw a pop up.
[01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:34.030]  Earth juice.
[01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:36.470]  The rainbow pro mix.
[01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:39.150]  I'm actually not familiar with the rainbow pro mix.
[01:53:39.230 --> 01:53:42.430]  Uh, from what I know of earth juice, it's not bad for bottled nutrients.
[01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:45.030]  I mean, you gotta, if you gotta grow with some bottled nutrients.
[01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:49.630]  I'm pretty sure I can and con I interviewed that guy.
[01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:55.390]  So if you guys want to kind of find out more about him, if you've never used that, uh, he seemed like a really genuine person.
[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:58.910]  And, um, as far as I know, he's been doing it for like 20 something plus years.
[01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:07.030]  Uh, uh, so earth juice, as far as I know, has always been on the shelf when I would go into a hydro store, a wheat shop.
[01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:09.910]  I'm going to throw some red meat to Layton.
[01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:12.190]  All right.
[01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:13.430]  So what is this now?
[01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:18.980]  He's talking about fungi.
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:28.140]  So yeah, my garage, the fungi, if it's in a pot with sand silt and clay, then yes, it will help feed the plant.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:35.020]  But if you're throwing it into a super soil and dumping the soil or using bottled nutrients, you're wasting your money.
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:37.140]  It's not going to associate with the plant.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:38.860]  And therefore it's going to be of no benefit.
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.180]  So again, you know, don't mix bottled nudes.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.580]  Don't mix salt based fertilizer.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.820]  Bottled nudes don't mix salt based fertilizers with biology.
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:54.500]  I mean, yeah, you can, the biology will break that stuff down and make it available.
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:59.020]  But at the same regard, half of your biology is going to get burned up by the salts.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.340]  So your diversity is gone.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.940]  So what did you really accomplish?
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:09.100]  So this is, this is where, you know, Craig McAllister had a point, um, low EC.
[01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:09.540]  All right.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.220]  I've been doing some work on low EC nutrients.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:18.260]  Yes, they are salt based, but so much of, of nature is salt based.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:23.060]  When you look at these nutrients broken all the way down, even in the pharmaceutical grade nutrients.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:30.100]  But if you're going to use those, if you go really, really low EC, then yes, it will not kill the biology.
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:31.020]  And Dr.
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:40.060]  Lane would kill me for saying this, but, um, Michael Hinden had come up with a nutrient line that I'm still trying to help get developed.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.380]  That was very low EC.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:46.940]  And when I added it to my compost, I saw an increase of organisms.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:50.100]  So there is a very fine line there somewhere.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:54.580]  I just don't have all of the information as to what that actually ends up to be.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:59.860]  Um, but there is a way to do this, but again, that's not bottled nutrients.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:11.220]  These are, you know, these are pharmaceutical grade nutrients that are bought in 50 pound bags that you have to blend yourself in exactly the right portions, exactly the right way.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:12.060]  You can't switch.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.460]  You can't go from part A to part C.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:16.940]  It's got to go part A, part B, part C.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:21.020]  So there's a lot of alchemy involved in understanding this.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.580]  And Michael had been doing the work for years.
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:25.980]  Um, and again, I played with it.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:31.940]  He came here, he, he, he gave me some, um, and I mixed it up, put it on my compost pile.
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:33.420]  Two weeks later, I microscoped it.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:34.220]  Sure as shit.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:39.420]  His stuff increased not only the saprobe fungi, but the protozoa as well.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:42.100]  And I had never seen anything like that in my life.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:46.980]  And trust me, I've played with a lot of different bottled nutrients, beta testing for people.
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:57:01.180]  Um, you know, everything from fermented, uh, food waste, uh, to, you know, actual, um, you know, bottled nutrients that were salt based and they, they, they devastate the biology unless it's really, really low.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:01.540]  You see.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.460]  So there's your, there's your red meat, Peter.
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.020]  Hey, and real quick, Leighton, let's, uh, Michael Hinden is.
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.220]  When you're speaking on him, it's of modern epigenetics.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.660]  Um, so shout out to him and his, you know, he's unfortunately deceased.
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.580]  His loving wife carries this stuff on.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.460]  So please support.
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:26.820]  That's another breeder that I feel like when we were talking about as a community, we can support with our dollars.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:32.060]  Uh, please check them out when you, when you're starting to think about what you want to grow for 2022.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.260]  Yes.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.620]  Uh, she's done, continues to do amazing work.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:41.660]  Um, she and Michael started the journey many years ago.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.940]  He told his father that he did not want to be a lawyer in his dad's firm.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:47.900]  He had a cushy job that would have made him.
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:50.300]  Incredible money for the rest of his life.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:56.220]  And he chose instead to tell his father, no, I'm going to move to California and grow cannabis.
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:02.180]  And he, and she, you know, lived like animals, you know, went through all that shit.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:12.740]  Um, and then horribly he was, he was murdered a year ago, Monday and just a tragedy, but she's still doing the work.
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:14.820]  Um, I love her dearly.
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.860]  She's an honest, sweet, beautiful woman.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.460]  Never hurt a frigging anybody.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:25.100]  And so I would support her a hundred percent again, modern epigenetics.
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:31.700]  Um, she's got some great crosses and she's doing a whole bunch of new work now for, for next, uh, next
[01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:32.700]  spring's release.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.940]  So yeah, if you can support her as a community, uh, I would truly appreciate it.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.300]  And thanks for bringing that up.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:38.920]  Right.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.300]  Absolutely.
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:44.220]  And if you want to learn more about his thought process, there are a few videos that are out there.
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:48.700]  So Google that you can kind of hear his thought process on a variety of things.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.740]  Um, and I, he's another one of those.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:54.780]  I feel like, uh, from the few videos that I watched him, uh, speaks his mind.
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:57.660]  Uh, and that's something that I feel like is very rare these days.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:02.420]  And a treasure when I find people that will, uh, just speak their mind, how they feel.
[01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:05.820]  Uh, that's something that I feel like is almost a lost art nowadays.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.140]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:13.460]  And, uh, you know, he wasn't, he wasn't cocky.
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.900]  He wasn't arrogant.
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:26.900]  Um, but he would share the knowledge in, in a way that perhaps some people could think of that, that he was being arrogant, but he wasn't, he was just being honest.
[01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:29.300]  He was just like, no, dude, this, this is how it is.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.940]  This is why I know that this is the work that I did to prove that.
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:37.780]  And so, you know, again, watch those videos.
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:40.420]  Um, you'll really learn to appreciate this man.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:44.100]  And yeah, there's, there's a cut or a strain that, that they came up with.
[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:47.980]  What's called, that was just in the chat, uh, Hindi mentality.
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:54.980]  Um, that one is, is an amazingly introspective, uh, cultivar.
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:56.700]  Um, you will really enjoy it.
[01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:01.660]  Um, if you, if you go all the way through it, get it to come out the other side.
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:03.660]  So thanks.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.700]  Thanks for bringing that up, Brian.
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.260]  Appreciate it.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:06.860]  Yeah, buddy.
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:14.540]  And I'm sure that's, you know, uh, it's rough for you, but we're going to do what we can to, uh, make sure that his legacy lives on.
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:24.420]  So you guys want to get in again into some of those questions, Peter packing beans or
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:28.020]  yeah, probably.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:29.420]  All right, bud.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:30.180]  Kill a lot.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:30.860]  Good man.
[02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:32.380]  Post them up on you.
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:34.060]  Who's posting up on Instagram.
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:37.740]  Get, get her, you know, get her some, uh, some more business.
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:39.780]  Yeah.
[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:53.740]  I love, I love people that have, yeah, I'd love people to hit me back and show me pictures of, of, you know, the, the work that, that, you know, he's done and that they've grown out and have, you know, such great, um, you know, compliments
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.260]  about, about the end result of the plan.
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:59.060]  And yeah, but Brianna does rock, man.
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:00.220]  She's a frigging angel.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:07.180]  Um, are there any questions out there, Peter, or should we just, or audience, you guys start throwing questions.
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.260]  I don't know.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:11.380]  Tell us where you're from.
[02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:13.740]  So sticky lungs can see.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:17.660]  He went to the post office.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:18.020]  All right.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:18.900]  Ask sticky.
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.260]  What his favorite strains?
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:20.900]  Sorry.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:21.620]  I'm back.
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:28.060]  Well, actually, so we have a, uh, this is, uh, Chris Guerrero in trim jail.
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:38.900]  Where was his, uh, some humble sour diesel multitasking.
[02:01:44.490 --> 02:01:45.010]  I remember.
[02:01:45.010 --> 02:01:46.530]  What is your favorite cultivar to grow?
[02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:48.770]  Oh, to grow.
[02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:50.530]  Hmm.
[02:01:51.010 --> 02:01:52.210]  Probably that Scooby snack.
[02:01:53.490 --> 02:02:00.210]  That's when I've grown the most recently for the longest, uh, I'd say overall.
[02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:03.450]  Hey, that's a tough question.
[02:02:04.570 --> 02:02:06.930]  I've grown a lot of clone on these and they're all fickle.
[02:02:06.930 --> 02:02:09.330]  It seems they all have their detractions.
[02:02:09.970 --> 02:02:16.210]  Uh, I guess my favorite one to grow would be train wreck the Arcada cut because it's my favorite strain.
[02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:17.650]  So,
[02:02:22.930 --> 02:02:30.090]  you know, and I, I saw another suggestion in, uh, in the chat about renting out a casino for a cannabis event.
[02:02:30.690 --> 02:02:32.730]  So maybe you should look into that as well.
[02:02:34.450 --> 02:02:38.290]  Running a casino, but then again, Katie's on it.
[02:02:38.290 --> 02:02:39.130]  So she'll figure it out.
[02:02:39.810 --> 02:02:44.850]  I know for a fact that you can't, you can't mix a, you can't mix a thing.
[02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:46.090]  We.
[02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:49.850]  That's why, uh, cultivated always.
[02:02:49.890 --> 02:02:51.170]  Maybe it's the hall.
[02:02:51.170 --> 02:03:00.250]  You have to, you know, it might be the hall, you know, that, you know, how casinos have a place for our venue.
[02:03:02.010 --> 02:03:02.690]  Then again, I don't know.
[02:03:02.730 --> 02:03:03.010]  Yeah.
[02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:04.490]  They're not going to let us smoke in there as well.
[02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:07.450]  I'm saying that takes away their gaming license.
[02:03:08.690 --> 02:03:13.370]  I wish there's a place in Denver called a, or up in a Blackhawk called the Ameristar.
[02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:16.450]  And if we could smoke up there, I feel like that'd be a pretty cool one.
[02:03:16.650 --> 02:03:18.930]  It's like, I'm talking to you and you're in Europe or something.
[02:03:18.930 --> 02:03:20.490]  We're on a live broadcast, Leighton.
[02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.810]  And then I got to wait.
[02:03:21.970 --> 02:03:23.930]  You know how they wait for that three-second delay.
[02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:25.010]  Yep.
[02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:26.370]  And then wait, and then wait.
[02:03:28.090 --> 02:03:28.610]  You there buddy.
[02:03:31.090 --> 02:03:45.040]  Am I, uh, am I glitching out or is, are you guys, yeah, you're or at least you're, uh, you're glitching out for me, but you guys keep glitching the fuck out.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:45.920]  I think it's my internet.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.440]  Yes.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:53.080]  Do you have a, because I feel like with the hack come over yesterday to try to fix this.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.000]  Are you hardwired in?
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:03.560]  Cause I noticed if you run the higher end cameras with the wireless or for whatever reason, uh, it doesn't seem like it works as well.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:10.280]  And when you do the ethernet with the camera and the mic and all that, it seems like it runs pretty well.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:13.960]  Uh, the camera and the mic and all that.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.800]  It seems like it runs pretty smooth now.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.760]  I feel like Peter always has a solid, solid fee.
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.320]  Do you're you're wired in, right?
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.040]  I don't even have, Oh, wow.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.080]  Well, where I live sucks.
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:29.760]  Internet sucks.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:33.560]  I'm in the garage and the wifi is right through that door.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:35.960]  So I have to like leave the door open.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:36.280]  All right.
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.280]  You look good today.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:40.760]  Sticky.
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:41.720]  Yeah.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.120]  Thank you.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.200]  You're on your face, brother.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:43.720]  Yeah.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.960]  Let the windows open.
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:46.400]  Yeah.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.000]  Let's admire.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:53.280]  Yeah.
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.120]  So Peter, do we have a questions?
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.720]  I think we were asking you that and you're away.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:04:59.240]  That's the questions.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.680]  That's the funny ones.
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:02.160]  Yeah.
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:04.120]  Throw questions in the chat.
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:08.920]  Just some, how does someone, were you guys talking about train wreck before?
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.440]  Yeah, it does have that Hermi, the late flower Hermi that happens.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:16.360]  You, I mean, you're going to get them.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:20.280]  I'd say it's not a production strain for that reason.
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:23.480]  You wouldn't want to run it in a commercial facility.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.240]  Yep.
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.080]  Sure does.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:31.360]  But, uh, can't tell me that smoke.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.520]  Isn't something special.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.200]  It also flops over really bad.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:40.640]  So that sucks about it too.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.240]  I don't know what that is.
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.280]  What's Eden blue gold fusion.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.120]  Uh, I don't know.
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:52.080]  Yeah.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.600]  Maybe they could define it a little bit better.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.240]  Is that a product or a style?
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:04.360]  What up Chad?
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:11.000]  Yeah, actually Kevin Jojery, uh, posted something yesterday, just about
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.320]  something that he grew up where he was like, this would totally not work in a
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.400]  commercial setting, you know, he's like, it's amazing.
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:17.960]  I love it.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:24.560]  But like, you know, all the, you know, it's, it's a long flowering plant, but
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:28.240]  then also like, it's something that you, you have to hand trim, like you can't
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.720]  stick it in an automated trimmer.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:33.240]  So just like all of these things that ding something for a commercial purpose.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:35.680]  Yeah.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:39.080]  I don't think you should ever have your plants in a machine.
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:40.400]  True.
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.040]  But in the commercial world, that is something that they think about.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.200]  What was the cultivar?
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:47.600]  I I'm looking it up.
[02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:53.240]  Uh, give me one second.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.060]  Yeah, this may take me.
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:01.260]  Yeah.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:04.380]  I don't know if you guys know about the tragedy that's going on up there.
[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:08.740]  I mean, those, all of those organic growers, the regenerative farmers up in
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:11.740]  Humboldt are getting their asses handed to them by the middlemen.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.660]  They're refusing to pay a fair price for the cannabis.
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:19.380]  I don't, I, I heard that Kevin didn't even grow this year because he knew it was
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:19.660]  coming.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:23.820]  So he has probably his own private plant that he didn't, uh, that you're talking
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.140]  about.
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:28.100]  Yeah.
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:29.100]  Damn.
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:29.900]  Here we go.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:30.940]  I can't imagine that guy not growing.
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:32.500]  All right.
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:34.540]  It's like saying Tom Brady wasn't throwing football.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:36.780]  Okay.
[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:43.840]  So I don't know if you guys can read that, but it's a Willie Nelson.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:45.040]  Oh five cup winner.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.040]  She did great here in Southern Humboldt.
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:51.160]  The Vietnamese nose was strong almost till the end, but the Nepalese brought out
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:53.160]  some rich, well anyway, blah, blah, blah.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:58.160]  Uh, it's plants like this that are not in the new markets.
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:03.880]  They don't turn purple, maybe 22% THC, no rap songs to push it or new celebrities
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:07.000]  to endorse her for being so heady of a high.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.160]  She has an excellent flower morphology, but still not rock hard enough for machine
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:11.720]  trim.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.200]  This one needs to be done by hand for the best presentation.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:16.800]  Uh,
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.160]  but anyway, like something that, you know, the commercial market will, if you rely
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.160]  on the commercial market, you will never see it.
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:26.720]  Yeah.
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:30.960]  Does he say who the breeder is at the bottom or he just kept that quiet?
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.040]  Uh, that's reaper man, reefer man, seeds Buddha boys got it right.
[02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.950]  I don't know.
[02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:45.350]  He, he, he, he doesn't say, he just says salute to the breeder.
[02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:49.190]  You know that those are his seeds.
[02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:49.630]  Dickie.
[02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:51.430]  Go up a little bit.
[02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:53.470]  Is it a, what F is it?
[02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:55.190]  What Philly old generation?
[02:08:57.110 --> 02:08:59.590]  Uh, he, I don't think he mentioned that.
[02:09:00.550 --> 02:09:01.270]  Oh, okay.
[02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:07.310]  Well, yeah, those are originally the, the, um, reefer man.
[02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.710]  Yeah.
[02:09:09.230 --> 02:09:11.590]  Didn't it school Willie Nelson on the top of it, Peter?
[02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:12.510]  Yeah.
[02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.910]  Yeah.
[02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:14.550]  That's free from it.
[02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:19.670]  See rain, man.
[02:09:20.150 --> 02:09:25.710]  He says, this guy says it's actually three quarters Vietnamese black or no.
[02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:26.950]  He's talking about something else.
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:28.430]  Maybe.
[02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:36.210]  Do you see that one?
[02:09:36.210 --> 02:09:36.770]  Layton?
[02:09:39.810 --> 02:09:40.210]  Layton.
[02:09:40.650 --> 02:09:44.330]  Um, yeah, he's, he's actually still working on that now.
[02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.530]  Um, he and I were texting just the other day.
[02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:47.970]  He's made some advancements.
[02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:53.850]  Um, he's not going to get published on this, but if you Google crop
[02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:59.810]  steering, uh, using water, it's been written up a number of, um, collegiate
[02:09:59.810 --> 02:10:06.210]  levels, um, where they've proven that you can use water to, um, get a plant
[02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:12.570]  to produce twice the fruit, um, and have that fruit, uh, a lot more potent.
[02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:16.490]  And so he's been working on this now for a few years.
[02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:21.410]  I think, I think when he reached out to me, he was about a year into it.
[02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:23.970]  And he came from the high tech industry.
[02:10:23.970 --> 02:10:26.490]  So he understood algorithms.
[02:10:26.490 --> 02:10:31.930]  He understood, um, three degree printing, how to make all these pieces and parts.
[02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:35.210]  And basically he's making them so that you can fix them.
[02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:38.850]  Um, you can get these parts for, for cheap for nothing.
[02:10:39.490 --> 02:10:43.850]  And, um, the work that he did originally, the reason he reached out to me was
[02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:47.370]  because of the horizontal soil system, because he was having a hard time
[02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:53.730]  finding a sensor that would actually read, truly read moisture levels in low
[02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:57.130]  tension soils, which are your super soils or your soilless mediums.
[02:10:57.770 --> 02:11:02.130]  Um, so basically I explained them just take the carrot, wrap it with clay and
[02:11:02.130 --> 02:11:06.290]  silk and put burlap around it, and it'll read any kind of low tension soil.
[02:11:06.290 --> 02:11:06.890]  Just perfect.
[02:11:07.450 --> 02:11:10.810]  Um, basically that's kind of what the horizontal soil system does.
[02:11:10.810 --> 02:11:12.170]  It mitigates the water.
[02:11:12.610 --> 02:11:15.970]  If you over water, it gives it a place to store and the horizon.
[02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:21.490]  And if you, uh, haven't watered enough, it will help wick the moisture out of that
[02:11:21.490 --> 02:11:24.210]  horizon through the eight horizon back up into the O.
[02:11:24.690 --> 02:11:27.490]  So, um, yeah, so he's still working on that project.
[02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:34.890]  Um, he was hoping to have, um, the, uh, what I want to call beta application out
[02:11:34.890 --> 02:11:37.570]  to me, um, late, late summer.
[02:11:37.570 --> 02:11:38.810]  And unfortunately it didn't happen.
[02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:43.130]  I, I don't know exactly why it didn't, but I, I am, like I said, in touch with
[02:11:43.810 --> 02:11:48.410]  and we'll be probably bringing him on at some point in the near future, uh, for him
[02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:50.210]  to demonstrate what he's been doing.
[02:11:52.450 --> 02:11:52.970]  Great guy.
[02:11:57.490 --> 02:11:57.810]  All right.
[02:11:57.810 --> 02:11:59.010]  Do we have anything else?
[02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:00.290]  Okay.
[02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.770]  Here we go.
[02:12:00.810 --> 02:12:07.530]  Then would, would a blue mat system with a Verizon, a soil system be a
[02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:09.290]  challenge to not run away?
[02:12:09.490 --> 02:12:13.450]  No, the beauty of it is, is you just take that carrot and stick it in the eight
[02:12:13.450 --> 02:12:14.130]  horizon.
[02:12:14.370 --> 02:12:19.490]  Now it's going to truly measure exactly what the overall humidity or moisture
[02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:22.770]  value is in the entire soil profile.
[02:12:22.770 --> 02:12:26.770]  That's, that's why I, you know, I put that out for people to be able to use.
[02:12:29.050 --> 02:12:31.090]  And, and sticky, you ought to try it, man.
[02:12:31.290 --> 02:12:32.130]  It fucking works.
[02:12:32.170 --> 02:12:36.530]  I, you don't know how many times I get hit up, thanking me for that system.
[02:12:37.090 --> 02:12:41.690]  Um, no, it's a horizontal soil system.
[02:12:41.890 --> 02:12:42.730]  We did a video.
[02:12:44.170 --> 02:12:46.210]  Oh, are you talking about the sectionals?
[02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:47.330]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:48.370]  The three layers.
[02:12:48.850 --> 02:12:49.130]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.130 --> 02:12:49.330]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:49.490]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:53.610]  And I get hit back all the time from people that are just, you know, ranting
[02:12:53.610 --> 02:12:58.410]  and raving about how it took all of the headaches out of watering, um, and, and
[02:12:58.410 --> 02:12:59.690]  overwatering, underwatering.
[02:13:01.290 --> 02:13:01.610]  Nice.
[02:13:01.650 --> 02:13:02.690]  I'll look into it, man.
[02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.730]  I'll look into it.
[02:13:03.850 --> 02:13:04.690]  Do I hand water?
[02:13:05.170 --> 02:13:05.490]  Yeah.
[02:13:05.490 --> 02:13:10.210]  I usually don't have that big of a grove and I like to have more control over it.
[02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:20.160]  I know that sounds kind of silly, but yeah, it's basically when, when the
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:24.640]  carrot doesn't pick up the moisture level in your low tension soil.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.960]  So it doesn't know better.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.560]  And so it just keeps throwing water at it until it floods you up again.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.040]  That's why wrap your carrots with silt and clay and burlap.
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:36.640]  And then you will not have that runaway.
[02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:40.470]  It's amazing.
[02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:42.550]  What a little drip will do overnight.
[02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:45.590]  Like you leave at 6 PM and then come back the next morning.
[02:13:45.710 --> 02:13:46.750]  Holy shit.
[02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:49.790]  I have a question.
[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:52.030]  Oh, these are good.
[02:13:52.230 --> 02:13:58.550]  It's a music question is, uh, would you say that trap music is better than
[02:13:58.550 --> 02:14:00.710]  any TI album that came after that?
[02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:04.470]  Who are you asking that to?
[02:14:04.750 --> 02:14:06.670]  I know who's the, someone from Georgia.
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:07.590]  You're from Georgia.
[02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:09.830]  Oh, say it again.
[02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:16.510]  Would I say that trap music is better or worse than any, uh, TI album that he's
[02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:19.910]  had set, like, I feel like that was kind of right before he got famous.
[02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.870]  Yeah.
[02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:25.350]  Like, uh, I feel like all the albums of when he was famous, I'm like, those
[02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:26.750]  aren't as good as his old stuff.
[02:14:27.190 --> 02:14:31.190]  It's like, yeah, my friend Ryan Morris would agree with you.
[02:14:31.190 --> 02:14:36.430]  He used to listen to TI back in like, I don't know, 2000, 2001.
[02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.110]  Yeah.
[02:14:37.110 --> 02:14:41.190]  I would definitely say that TI is in my opinion, way better than a
[02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:42.750]  variety of that stuff down there.
[02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:47.110]  You love outcast.
[02:14:47.110 --> 02:14:50.110]  I feel like that's probably the main Southern, especially from.
[02:14:50.110 --> 02:14:50.430]  Yeah.
[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:51.990]  Yep.
[02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:58.390]  Elko says she has, or he or whoever he or she has every outcast CD.
[02:14:59.630 --> 02:15:00.550]  Me too, buddy.
[02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:02.110]  Hell yeah.
[02:15:02.110 --> 02:15:05.670]  It was hard not to, uh, really get into them, especially from them being from
[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:09.590]  Georgia and then they just took off where I feel like everybody at that time was
[02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:10.510]  West coast.
[02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:11.310]  Yeah.
[02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:11.990]  It's cool too.
[02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:13.870]  Cause you, you see him around town.
[02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:16.870]  So it was like, they were real people, you know?
[02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.790]  Yeah.
[02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:19.150]  Yeah.
[02:15:19.150 --> 02:15:19.830]  They were around.
[02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:21.630]  I saw him one time at a grocery store.
[02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:23.190]  It was kind of cool.
[02:15:24.150 --> 02:15:27.550]  Didn't have the balls to really say anything, but game like the nod, like,
[02:15:27.710 --> 02:15:28.790]  I know that fuck you all.
[02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:30.110]  I'm like, yeah, I'm like, yeah.
[02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:30.470]  Yeah.
[02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:31.470]  Atlanta was cool, man.
[02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:32.390]  Especially back in the day.
[02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:36.230]  I feel like, um, maybe this is another time we could talk about the show, but
[02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:40.790]  there was this, uh, whole group that moved as one, they were called the black
[02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:43.350]  mafia family and they were legit, man.
[02:15:43.350 --> 02:15:46.310]  They were in the hottest clubs down in Atlanta.
[02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:49.670]  Uh, having, you know, probably 30 deep.
[02:15:49.670 --> 02:15:55.230]  Every single one of them had a Dom Perignon champagne, you know,
[02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:56.390]  something equivalent to that.
[02:15:56.670 --> 02:16:01.350]  And every single one of those dudes drove up to the club in like a Ferrari
[02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:02.710]  or Bentley or something like that.
[02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:05.910]  So I feel like Atlanta has a lot of cool stories like that.
[02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:09.870]  Uh, late and I was talking to Quasimodo that supposedly he knows a
[02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:10.990]  little bit about that as well.
[02:16:10.990 --> 02:16:12.630]  So maybe we could have sticky come back on.
[02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:16.110]  We could maybe talk more about like, uh, maybe the rougher stuff like
[02:16:16.110 --> 02:16:19.070]  cabbage town and then how the glitz and the glamor seemed to come.
[02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:22.470]  Uh, one of the, one of the things that I was really excited about was
[02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:26.430]  how the glitz and the glamor seemed to come, uh, once Atlanta started to pop
[02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:29.870]  off, uh, with some of the rappers, it seemed like once the rapper started
[02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:33.630]  to pop off more and more people wanted to kind of enjoy Atlanta nightlife.
[02:16:33.630 --> 02:16:37.030]  And that's when, when I was a young man, I mean, there were clubs where women
[02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:39.710]  would be swinging on these like huge swings.
[02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:42.950]  I mean, these were clubs that were like 30,000, 40,000 square feet
[02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:44.950]  packed, packed to the rim.
[02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:48.310]  And these BMF crew guys, uh, for any of you guys that ever got to
[02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:51.590]  witness that for yourselves, uh, that was the first time where I was like,
[02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:55.190]  I not only are these kind of like a gang, but these guys get it.
[02:16:55.470 --> 02:16:58.230]  I mean, every single one of them looked like the boss.
[02:16:58.270 --> 02:16:58.670]  Right.
[02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:01.670]  And where I feel like a lot of that other stuff in Atlanta, really, there's only
[02:17:01.670 --> 02:17:04.510]  like two or three dudes that would be running in little clicks that seemed
[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:07.270]  like they actually had any money where the rest of them were just running around.
[02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:10.870]  Uh, so maybe, I don't know, maybe we tell stories about that at some point
[02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:14.670]  as well, because I know Quasimodo, uh, could throw in some, um, some
[02:17:14.670 --> 02:17:16.430]  older advice on that as well.
[02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:19.070]  Well, there was, he chased the bands, man.
[02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:22.310]  He was, he was running around with all the rappers and, you know,
[02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:24.350]  some heavy fucking bands.
[02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:27.350]  Um, sorry, I'm going to mute myself.
[02:17:27.350 --> 02:17:28.550]  I was going fucking crazy.
[02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:32.030]  Gucci man.
[02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:38.760]  Gucci man was a part of, uh, some of that beef too, back in the day.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:40.960]  All right.
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:46.760]  So what happens in the horizontal system is that you have the bottom layer is
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:48.200]  made of sand and rock.
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:49.680]  So it's a sand filter.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:53.360]  It does not allow organic matter to get down in it, which is critical.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  You also use a rubber liner.
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:01.320]  That's the same height as the horizon on the outside of the pot so that you
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:04.640]  could physically see if you're overwatering, that water's going to run off.
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:11.240]  And basically in a, um, I think it's in a five gallon pot.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:15.800]  Uh, if you are, excuse me, if you're in a five gallon pot, you're going to
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.760]  if you are, excuse me, a 30 gallon pot.
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:23.400]  If you use five gallons of like a compound bucket full of, of the E horizon, it
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.560]  will store about 10 gallons of water.
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.840]  So that's quite a significant amount.
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.440]  And, um, so basically if you over water, it gets stored down in that E horizon.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:37.040]  Um, and then, and a wick backup, um, as the old horizon dries out, which
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.440]  maintains a nice, consistent, even moisture.
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.840]  Um, so you can, you can actually dry down completely and then have what I call a
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.200]  rain event where you've dumped 10 gallons of water in there and then you
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.960]  don't water for five days, 10 days.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:53.400]  So it gives you a lot of options for crop steering and playing with different
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.040]  levels of moisture or water in your system.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.680]  You got any other questions?
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:11.920]  Look in, I don't really see questions.
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.400]  Uh, just people type.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:15.800]  So goody mob also from Atlanta, right?
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:17.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:20.120]  Goody mob and outcast.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.680]  Um, I felt like that was our bread and butter, man.
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.640]  That was definitely, uh, at the height of what we were doing was listening to that.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:34.520]  I guess that was kind of original trap music, you know, talking about, uh, that
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:37.240]  Southern play a list of Cadillac funky music.
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:42.440]  I mean, that was, I feel like that was some of the first stuff, uh, that I felt
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:47.400]  like was really vibing mainstream that would talk about the, this kind of quote
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:50.120]  unquote kind of street vibe, street lifestyle.
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.160]  And I felt like outcast goody mob, uh, shared that, uh, with the world, with the
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:59.960]  hooty hoos and all the, the kind of nostalgia of living that kind of lifestyle.
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:03.000]  Uh, who do you, who was, you know, the police were coming by.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.280]  So if you were hustling on the street, you would hooty hoo.
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:10.760]  And then everybody kind of echo that echo chamber that down the streets, down the
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.920]  blocks and everybody run away, come back out when the coast was cleared.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:17.920]  Um, that was the first time I've ever heard, uh, rappers actually talk about
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.480]  some of the stuff that was going on in Atlanta at that time,
[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:24.280]  Chris DME.
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.040]  And we'll figure something out.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:34.560]  So here is a, uh, if you're making dry sift,
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:38.600]  try and cure you.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:39.480]  I would dry them.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.000]  I probably wouldn't cure them.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:41.480]  Yeah.
[02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:54.750]  Uh, greens asked, do you, do you, do you prefer dry sift?
[02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:56.790]  Or pressing?
[02:20:57.150 --> 02:20:57.830]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:20:58.990 --> 02:21:04.910]  Oh, if I'm pressing or making hash, no, I'm just in a grow facility at the moment.
[02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:08.150]  Uh, just doing my dailies for the company.
[02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.870]  You know what I mean?
[02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:13.430]  Trying to do what I can to help grow the best weed I can for this company I'm
[02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:16.390]  working for, but, uh, yeah.
[02:21:16.430 --> 02:21:17.630]  Helping them succeed.
[02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:18.910]  What is their growth style?
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.030]  What kind of style are there?
[02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:24.870]  Well, there's two, there's a living soil and hydro.
[02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:27.870]  And the hydro is like grow dance.
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:37.160]  And the living soil is, uh, so you actually have a side by side.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.720]  No, they're not side by side.
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:40.080]  They're different.
[02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:41.120]  They're different rooms.
[02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:45.780]  Yeah.
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:46.540]  That's what I mean.
[02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:51.860]  You have the option to grow synthetically and organically, and you can actually
[02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:52.340]  compare it.
[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:55.700]  Are they running the same cultivar in both styles?
[02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:57.540]  Sometimes.
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:21:58.620]  Yeah.
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:00.060]  Well, I want to get your head on.
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:01.380]  So yeah.
[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:02.340]  You can tell the difference.
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:06.780]  Uh, was that latent?
[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:11.420]  I was going to say that that would be amazing.
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:15.820]  You could actually take the flower and have it sent out and get the different
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:18.700]  levels of cannabinoid production and terpene production.
[02:22:18.940 --> 02:22:23.060]  But again, it has to be the same cultivar, but I mean, that would be an amazing
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:29.500]  piece of data to finally put the end to anybody saying that living soils do not
[02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:32.500]  grow better than synthetic because they do.
[02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:38.060]  I, in all of my experience, it's, it's, it's, there's no question that the living
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:43.460]  soil will grow, will, will allow that plant to have expression in some of the
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:48.820]  minor cannabinoids and terpenes that you cannot get expressed in a synthetic growth.
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:50.940]  But do the test.
[02:22:51.380 --> 02:22:51.900]  Be can.
[02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:53.420]  Sticky.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:22:57.340]  Why do you think they're still running that if they are running living soil and
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:59.780]  don't they also have a spot in California where they do living?
[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:00.100]  So.
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:04.700]  Yeah, I believe that's how it goes out there.
[02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:10.060]  Um, I'm not sure if the whole place out there is like that, but I know they have
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:12.620]  a lot of success with their living soil in California.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:17.420]  So how come your facility is still running synthetics in your opinion?
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:21.860]  Uh, maybe, you know, I'm not really privy to this kind of information.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:29.580]  I could only assume, but maybe the yield numbers are more consistent than say a
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.500]  living soil.
[02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:34.740]  That's the only thing I could imagine really, but I can't say it's pure
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:35.460]  speculation.
[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:42.460]  I'm just always wondering, do you know where their living soil grows in California?
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:43.900]  I do.
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:44.340]  Yeah.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:49.740]  They get, I mean, the company I work for gets a lot of shine, so they, uh, they're
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:50.420]  well known.
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:51.220]  That's for sure.
[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:54.900]  So are they here in SoCal?
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:57.300]  Yes, they are.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:57.580]  Yeah.
[02:23:57.580 --> 02:23:58.260]  They're in Oakland.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:02.020]  I'd love to go out and visit them if you can get me in.
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.800]  I could possibly do that.
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:12.240]  Um, I know there's a lot of changes going on at the moment right now within the
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:12.720]  company.
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:13.400]  So.
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:18.200]  Pull as I might've had at one time, you know, but we'll see.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:20.400]  I can definitely do what I can, Layden, for sure.
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:23.360]  Did you see this one?
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.360]  Is grounding plants real in experience?
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:32.160]  Uh, I don't have any experience with grounding plants.
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:34.320]  No, unfortunately.
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.920]  What does that entail?
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:36.480]  I wonder.
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:39.840]  I think what the human was grounding the beds.
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:40.200]  Yeah.
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:40.440]  Yeah.
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:40.640]  Yeah.
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:40.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:41.040]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:41.280]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:41.520]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:41.720]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:41.880]  Yeah.
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:42.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:42.320]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:42.480]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:42.640]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:42.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:42.960]  Yeah.
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:43.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:43.280]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:43.440]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:43.600]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:43.760]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:43.920]  Yeah.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.080]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:44.240]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:44.400]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:44.560]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:44.640]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:44.800]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:44.960]  Yeah.
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:45.120]  Yeah.
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:45.240]  Yeah.
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:45.320]  Yeah.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:51.960]  Like if you're growing indoors, um, I know for instance, like hydra, you have to, you
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:57.720]  have to put a ground because of the potential, uh, electrical, um, you know, shock that can
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:59.680]  happen if you drop a wire in there.
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:05.880]  Um, and I know like on the living bed or living, uh, soil grow that we did in
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:09.480]  Colorado, he grounded every single one of the beds as well.
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:14.480]  And I believe it was an electrical code, but, um, that's what he's kind of asking.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.000]  Uh, yeah, that's above my pay grade.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:19.960]  It'd be honest with you, buddy.
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:27.740]  All right.
[02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:29.420]  Cat eye exchange.
[02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:30.900]  What is that?
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:31.820]  Who said that?
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:34.860]  Cat eye and exchange or the, or the wire.
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:36.700]  I, yeah.
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:40.700]  Someone was asking about, okay.
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:47.220]  So greens, no cat eye and exchange capacity is the ability for any material.
[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:53.900]  Um, clay is a wonderful cat on exchange, uh, has a wonderful cat eye acidy.
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:58.340]  Uh, compost has another, as a great source for cat eye and capacity.
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:04.020]  Basically what that is, is that the substrates ability to hold on to macro
[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:08.140]  nutrients, like calcium, potassium, magnesium.
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:10.460]  That's why you always do a saturated paste test.
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:15.940]  You can see which ones of those cat ions are actually being able to hold in storage.
[02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:21.180]  Now, when you get a cat ion exchange or a CEC rate, that's basically telling you
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:25.660]  what volume of storage capacity that you have.
[02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:25.940]  Thank you.
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:26.420]  I'm all set.
[02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:27.060]  I'll put it right here.
[02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:30.860]  Um, what volume of storage capacity you have?
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:33.540]  Look at this dog.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.820]  Mid sentence getting the gourmet meal handed to me.
[02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:45.380]  Um, so yeah, so the, the cat ion exchange capacity is the ability for how much
[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:47.260]  nutrients you can actually store.
[02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:51.860]  And that's why it's always important to do a textual soil textual test because you can
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:54.500]  determine if you have low organic matter.
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:58.580]  Well, then all of that storage capacity is in clay or in a little bit in silk.
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:26:59.780]  Actually.
[02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:00.260]  Yeah.
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:02.620]  So we'll hold a little bit of cat ions as well.
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:08.140]  Um, but if you have high organic matter and low clay, now, you know that the organic
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:11.740]  matter is your primary source of nutrient holding capacity.
[02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:13.740]  So I hope I explained that well.
[02:27:19.090 --> 02:27:20.130]  You always do bro.
[02:27:27.710 --> 02:27:28.110]  All right.
[02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:30.790]  Paramagnetic basalt is a little different.
[02:27:31.310 --> 02:27:36.470]  Um, that, that gets into some of the energy stuff that we did a show on.
[02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:39.390]  A lot of people think it's woo woo.
[02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:42.150]  Personally, I think it's not, I think it's a real thing.
[02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:47.190]  Um, there is some more information that's been coming out lately about, um, what's
[02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:52.550]  called micro faults and how important they are both at a biological level, as well as
[02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:55.070]  in an advanced animal or mammal like us.
[02:27:55.630 --> 02:28:01.710]  Um, but basically that's, that's a very, very weak magnetic signal that is, that's
[02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:04.350]  coming from, um, the basalt rock dust.
[02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:09.550]  There's actually a company in Colorado, I think that's selling it in bags.
[02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:13.870]  They came to one of our conferences out in Humboldt three years ago.
[02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:17.670]  Shout out to this gentleman.
[02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:22.190]  I personally, but I never seen you before, but you're asking some well thought
[02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:22.830]  questions.
[02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:28.110]  I like when we get on the woo woo and it kind of makes people a little mad, you
[02:28:28.110 --> 02:28:28.230]  know?
[02:28:29.470 --> 02:28:30.670]  Hey dude, where are you from?
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:34.440]  And I didn't know.
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:36.160]  So people can watch on Facebook too.
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:39.640]  And Twitter.
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.200]  Seriously?
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.000]  Well, no wonder.
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:49.840]  When are we going to get that?
[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:52.400]  That needs to be like a, on the back shelf or something.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:58.040]  Well, my brother ship it from, I think it's in Rhode Island right now.
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:01.480]  But you'd have to ship it out here.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.240]  Actually he, he sold one of my guitars.
[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:13.120]  Uh, like I went back to Rhode Island and I went to the basement to my parents' house
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.280]  to like finally grab it and bring it back.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.520]  And I'm like, the fuck's my guitar.
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:20.840]  Um, that's fucked up, man.
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:22.720]  And he was like, oh, I sold it.
[02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:29.090]  So did that guy, uh, hold on.
[02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:29.890]  Let's see.
[02:29:31.410 --> 02:29:35.130]  It was a gold tone electric banjo.
[02:29:37.290 --> 02:29:39.850]  Sticky's got a few cool looking guitars at his spot.
[02:29:40.010 --> 02:29:41.530]  Josephson, Rhode Island.
[02:29:44.050 --> 02:29:48.850]  Sup Narragansett, Cranston, Warwick.
[02:29:56.920 --> 02:30:01.240]  Uh, was that the guy who asked the question before?
[02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:04.120]  Where you asked, where are you from?
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:08.200]  No, he was asking about the paramagnetic rock.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:09.720]  That's the, that's the cat.
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:10.040]  I know.
[02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:11.160]  Here we go from France.
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:11.640]  There we go.
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:14.360]  There's, there's the other Facebook viewer.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:16.920]  Nice.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:17.800]  I had no idea.
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.080]  We asked the audience to tell us where they're from, which is always fun.
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:25.440]  One audience.
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:25.880]  Yes.
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:27.440]  Well today I'm not going to flash it.
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.560]  It's it's I'm like, I'm just going to watch.
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:32.360]  It's fun for everybody with Peter.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:34.960]  Let's read the side column.
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:36.560]  Yeah.
[02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:45.920]  Peter's too high to, uh, I love all the R and D, but just blew past.
[02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:53.790]  Christoph is in Paris, North Carolina.
[02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:55.390]  So tell a horn this small.
[02:30:57.990 --> 02:31:00.270]  More Cal Grand Rapids, Maine.
[02:31:00.270 --> 02:31:01.670]  What's up, Maine.
[02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:02.710]  What will part of Maine?
[02:31:03.470 --> 02:31:08.230]  And just so Brian knows 95 does continue right on through Maine.
[02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:10.430]  Does not stop in New York.
[02:31:11.350 --> 02:31:13.390]  Oh, thank you for that.
[02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:16.790]  A lot of people North of New York who were offended by that comment.
[02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:18.390]  Canary Island.
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:22.440]  Yeah.
[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:22.840]  Doesn't it?
[02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:24.600]  I think it goes all the way to Canada actually.
[02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:24.840]  Right.
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:26.920]  I think it does.
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:30.000]  Guys at the border.
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:32.080]  Does it die at the border?
[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:32.440]  Yeah.
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:33.520]  Route 66.
[02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:37.560]  I mean, I got one.
[02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:37.920]  What's up?
[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:38.480]  Scotland.
[02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:44.510]  Miley's where's Miley's he on here today?
[02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:47.310]  Chad, I didn't know you had a grade school in Holland.
[02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.630]  Who knew?
[02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:56.920]  I, dude, I used to summer in Camden, Maine as a boy.
[02:31:57.720 --> 02:31:58.840]  I know right where you are.
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:01.200]  We'd sit up at Mount baddy looking out at your Island.
[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:03.160]  That's a good name.
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:04.360]  Mountain Mount baddy.
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:06.280]  How many did you hit in the eighties?
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:10.760]  Layton's wife cooked and cooked him a gourmet lunch while he was sitting there.
[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:11.400]  Yeah.
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:12.720]  I got some soup over there.
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:13.360]  Yeah.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:16.400]  I have lunch waiting for me in the kitchen when I go inside.
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:20.280]  Wait, maybe that's not Holland, Holland.
[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:26.660]  Nevermind.
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:29.300]  Yeah.
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:30.340]  I think it's Holland, Michigan.
[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:30.620]  Isn't it?
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:30.780]  Yeah.
[02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:32.300]  Isn't Miley from Michigan?
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:34.300]  Yeah.
[02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:35.700]  Chad, Chad, clarify.
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:37.260]  Now it all makes sense.
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:38.740]  He wants to go back home.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:42.260]  Who doesn't like chocolate cheesecake?
[02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:46.980]  That's a winning combination.
[02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:53.940]  So smiley's garden for you guys that don't know, he has his own.
[02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:56.220]  Um, I think it's called the organic takeover.
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:57.740]  Uh, you guys should check that out.
[02:32:57.740 --> 02:32:57.980]  Yeah.
[02:32:57.980 --> 02:32:58.980]  He's doing the work, man.
[02:32:58.980 --> 02:32:59.500]  For sure.
[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:03.820]  So, uh, photo Syntec, that's another good dude.
[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:05.780]  Check out his podcast as well.
[02:33:07.420 --> 02:33:11.180]  Well, as you can see, sticky there from all over the fucking place.
[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:15.060]  It's always fun to see, see that.
[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:17.060]  Yeah.
[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:24.590]  I mean, I'm not, I'm not a big fan of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the
[02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:25.470]  fucking place.
[02:33:27.470 --> 02:33:29.150]  It's always fun to see, see that.
[02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:34.020]  Evidently a lot of Holland, Michigan.
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:38.500]  Who knew?
[02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:48.180]  I could, I could, I didn't, I couldn't figure that out, but I got it.
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:52.620]  My Ohio city, my Ohio, Colorado.
[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:59.140]  Sticky has been a great guest.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:33:59.580]  Yeah.
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:00.980]  Appreciate it.
[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:02.380]  What, what did he say?
[02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:03.660]  What are you smoking on right now?
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:06.580]  Some banana turps.
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:15.320]  Just some commercial hash.
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.570]  Is your group the only group doing the Percy sauce?
[02:34:25.010 --> 02:34:28.850]  No, I think laser cat does lava, which is like that.
[02:34:30.130 --> 02:34:33.850]  Uh, you just end up calling it whatever your tech is.
[02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:35.770]  Everybody calls it whatever they want to.
[02:34:35.770 --> 02:34:43.930]  It's, it's kind of funny the way hash went from BHO to solvent list water hash, like
[02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:50.290]  back to bubble hash basically, but drying it with the freeze dryer, uh, and then
[02:34:51.090 --> 02:34:55.010]  making it look like BHO, even though it's solvent lists.
[02:34:56.890 --> 02:35:05.760]  Do you guys, do I like flour or just strictly concentrates?
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:11.560]  I live in a non-smoking apartment complex, so I just dab.
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.080]  It says Canerado good genetics.
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:27.160]  Uh, yeah, I don't know that they do have some good stuff or he does have some good
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:27.520]  stuff.
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:32.560]  I think with a lot of genetics, you're going to find it's a lottery ticket.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:36.920]  Your chances of hitting are better if you're not smoking.
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.120]  Plus he runs with JJ.
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:43.000]  Uh, some people, some people are going to like who you like.
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.240]  Some people are going to hate who you like vice versa.
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:47.840]  A hundred percent.
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:49.880]  Yeah.
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:51.320]  Was that Southern VT grower?
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:51.840]  Yep.
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:36:02.260]  Hopefully we can get a smiley's smiley's part of the thing taken off.
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:04.140]  Cause I feel like it's really well done, man.
[02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:07.500]  Um, so, so yeah, I think that's it.
[02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:10.540]  Yeah, no real smoke from dads, right?
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:12.380]  Kind of just dissipates.
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:21.930]  I feel like someone else definitely has crickets too cause I'm still hearing
[02:36:21.930 --> 02:36:24.530]  crickets in my, and my actually, no.
[02:36:24.530 --> 02:36:25.970]  Sorry, minor backup again.
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:26.250]  All right.
[02:36:27.490 --> 02:36:30.330]  Is that still my crickets that I'm hearing through my headphones?
[02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:32.050]  Yes.
[02:36:32.050 --> 02:36:32.370]  It was.
[02:36:32.370 --> 02:36:32.650]  It was.
[02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:33.130]  It was.
[02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:34.530]  It was my crickets.
[02:36:34.530 --> 02:36:35.050]  It was mine.
[02:36:35.050 --> 02:36:35.890]  It was my crickets.
[02:36:35.890 --> 02:36:36.690]  It was my crickets.
[02:36:36.690 --> 02:36:37.650]  It was my crickets.
[02:36:37.650 --> 02:36:38.530]  It was my crickets.
[02:36:38.530 --> 02:36:39.370]  headphones.
[02:36:40.490 --> 02:36:42.450]  Yes, those are your headphones.
[02:36:42.450 --> 02:36:44.290]  Can you guys hear them or just me?
[02:36:45.850 --> 02:36:47.130]  Yeah, we can hear them.
[02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:47.970]  Okay.
[02:36:47.970 --> 02:36:48.810]  What are you barking at?
[02:36:48.810 --> 02:36:50.130]  No big deal.
[02:36:50.130 --> 02:36:52.010]  Hey, do you have an opinion, Sticky,
[02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:56.010]  on it says it looks like PCS seeds or coma seeds?
[02:36:57.570 --> 02:36:58.830]  I really don't, man.
[02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:04.010]  I haven't been following the seed game very closely
[02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:08.250]  the past year or two, I guess, for a few reasons,
[02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:13.250]  but yeah, I think the people I'm excited about for seeds,
[02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:17.930]  if you guys are looking for stuff that is solid stuff
[02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:22.310]  that I could vouch for, and I guess you take my opinion
[02:37:22.310 --> 02:37:27.050]  as you will, but I like Sunleaf Seed has some good films
[02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:28.290]  that he's just released.
[02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:32.290]  He said they're really, really stable
[02:37:32.290 --> 02:37:36.050]  as far as phenotype kind of expression.
[02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:40.850]  My buddy's putting out some seeds under the name
[02:37:40.850 --> 02:37:43.290]  of Terp Fountain Genetics.
[02:37:43.290 --> 02:37:45.810]  I think a lot of people are excited
[02:37:45.810 --> 02:37:48.890]  about his release coming up.
[02:37:48.890 --> 02:37:52.970]  If you're looking for seeds that will produce viable
[02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:57.410]  hash rosin or water hash, those are good.
[02:37:58.730 --> 02:38:00.170]  That's what he specializes in.
[02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:05.170]  So you can look for alternatives to Oni nowadays.
[02:38:06.690 --> 02:38:07.870]  If you need to.
[02:38:15.570 --> 02:38:16.690]  Something happened, Sticky.
[02:38:16.690 --> 02:38:18.370]  Oh, he muted.
[02:38:18.370 --> 02:38:20.850]  I think you muted yourself.
[02:38:20.850 --> 02:38:22.490]  Oh, I think his headphones died.
[02:38:26.130 --> 02:38:26.970]  If you...
[02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:31.730]  Hold on.
[02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:35.810]  I have text visuals for moments like this.
[02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:38.730]  There we go.
[02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:40.330]  Yeah, we heard that.
[02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:42.490]  I think my battery might be dying.
[02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:43.330]  I need to text.
[02:38:48.930 --> 02:38:50.690]  And can you hear us?
[02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:54.010]  Can you hear us?
[02:38:54.010 --> 02:38:55.370]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, we can hear you.
[02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:56.690]  Oh, okay.
[02:38:56.690 --> 02:38:58.050]  He's back.
[02:38:58.050 --> 02:38:59.730]  I'm back, full effect.
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:07.220]  Maybe not.
[02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:13.500]  You're back, we can hear you.
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:15.540]  What's up, Loyal to Canvas?
[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:17.740]  Appreciate all you do for the show, brother.
[02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:26.590]  All right, well, wait, so you can or cannot hear us?
[02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:28.470]  Can anyone hear me?
[02:39:28.470 --> 02:39:29.310]  Yeah.
[02:39:29.310 --> 02:39:30.830]  I just switched to the speakers on my computer.
[02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:31.670]  Is that okay?
[02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:32.510]  Is there an echo?
[02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:33.990]  Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.
[02:39:33.990 --> 02:39:34.830]  Okay, cool.
[02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:37.190]  Well, we could wrap on that
[02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:39.390]  because you guys are standing between me
[02:39:39.390 --> 02:39:42.550]  and pizza and salad for lunch.
[02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:43.710]  Hey, shout outs to Lucky Dog.
[02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:46.110]  Which is getting cold in this kitchen right now.
[02:39:49.170 --> 02:39:50.010]  Bodhi.
[02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:54.950]  Hey, don't forget Mr. Fondango.
[02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:57.830]  I haven't done my Clem Fandango in a while.
[02:39:59.910 --> 02:40:01.910]  Mr. Toad, don't forget about him.
[02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:04.350]  What was the name of his seed company again?
[02:40:04.350 --> 02:40:05.190]  Boneyard.
[02:40:06.270 --> 02:40:07.110]  Boneyard.
[02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.950]  I got it right over there.
[02:40:07.950 --> 02:40:09.430]  Shout out to Mr. Toad.
[02:40:09.430 --> 02:40:10.270]  Stand up, guy.
[02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:12.550]  When the website's back up, hopefully tomorrow.
[02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:15.030]  Oh yeah.
[02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:18.350]  Well, thank you, Sticky,
[02:40:18.350 --> 02:40:21.470]  or as my children call you, Mr. Sir Sticky.
[02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:25.070]  We appreciate you gracing us with your presence.
[02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.910]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:27.830]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:28.790]  Thank you, Sticky.
[02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.910]  No problem.
[02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:34.230]  And so at, what's,
[02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:37.670]  it's like almost one at 6 p.m. Pacific time tonight,
[02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:41.590]  we got Joda Erb in Clubhouse.
[02:40:42.470 --> 02:40:44.630]  I think talking KNF this week.
[02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:47.350]  So anyone who wants to jump into Clubhouse
[02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:48.870]  and be a part of the conversation,
[02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:53.590]  why not just dial it in to channel two

[02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:09.830]  Does Chad have anything on Saturday?
[02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:13.350]  Not this Saturday, but we may stick some stuff in there.
[02:41:13.390 --> 02:41:18.390]  So nothing's currently planned that I can remember.
