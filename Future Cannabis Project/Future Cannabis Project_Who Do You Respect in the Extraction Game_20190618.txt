[00:01.020 --> 00:08.020]  Besides yourselves, as you look at other people doing extraction, do you respect, even if
[00:08.020 --> 00:11.620]  it's something like I wouldn't smoke that myself because I like...
[00:11.620 --> 00:14.660]  Oh, I do test.
[00:14.660 --> 00:17.140]  Some of the best extractors are in Cali.
[00:17.140 --> 00:20.660]  There is a lot of them that I respect.
[00:20.660 --> 00:25.020]  Give me some people you respect and what you respect about what they're doing.
[00:25.020 --> 00:37.020]  The organic, the two twins, there is a bunch of them because by using butane, they have
[00:37.020 --> 00:40.700]  the ability to capture the more volatile terpene.
[00:40.700 --> 00:46.340]  And they produce products that are amazing, that have no residue.
[00:46.340 --> 00:52.620]  It's like it's the ultimate tool to capture the most volatile terpene and to separate
[00:52.940 --> 00:55.700]  every compound that the plant is giving you.
[00:55.700 --> 01:01.340]  And I come from the perfume industry, so I have a lot of respect for it.
[01:01.340 --> 01:03.380]  It's not because I'm stuck in my niche.
[01:03.380 --> 01:09.740]  There is already so much for me to learn just about ashish that is like there is...
[01:09.740 --> 01:17.060]  Despite the fascination and attraction that I have for extraction, there is no way I can
[01:17.060 --> 01:19.300]  dedicate time to it.
[01:19.300 --> 01:20.300]  You know what I mean?
[01:20.340 --> 01:24.340]  It's another monster altogether.
[01:30.900 --> 01:37.260]  I mean, like Frenchy said, most of the best hash in Cali probably doesn't even hit the
[01:37.260 --> 01:39.580]  dispensary.
[01:39.580 --> 01:41.020]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41.020 --> 01:46.940]  It's ridiculous that you can't make hash on your farm.
[01:46.980 --> 01:54.460]  It's ridiculous that they won't let you get some bubble bags and do it kind of old school.
[01:54.460 --> 01:59.100]  So a lot of those, I feel like a lot of those hash makers have been left behind.
[01:59.100 --> 02:02.100]  We have lost many.
[02:02.100 --> 02:09.060]  But it's kind of cool for them because they don't have to worry about taxes, laws.
[02:09.060 --> 02:14.740]  And it's so small scale that I don't think they're really bothering anybody.
[02:14.740 --> 02:16.540]  They're all in the black market.
[02:17.140 --> 02:19.140]  I mean, I think they do.
[02:19.140 --> 02:24.660]  Without those constraints, I would love to not have to worry about yield and cultivation
[02:24.660 --> 02:26.740]  tax and all that stuff.
[02:26.740 --> 02:36.380]  So when you're making hash and all the new laws, all the packaging laws.
[02:36.380 --> 02:44.100]  Yesterday I was sitting, I re-stickered 6,000 units because the R&D test didn't match the
[02:44.140 --> 02:47.660]  compliance test for potency.
[02:47.660 --> 02:48.660]  Everyone's just like, oops.
[02:48.660 --> 02:52.540]  And I'm like, cool, that's what I spent my day doing.
[02:52.540 --> 02:57.340]  I mean, as a hash maker, I don't think I should be re-stickering stuff.
[02:57.340 --> 02:59.980]  There's no, for small companies, there's no option.
[02:59.980 --> 03:02.460]  Like you, you got to go in and get it done.
[03:02.460 --> 03:03.700]  You got orders to do.
[03:03.700 --> 03:08.980]  So yeah, I mean, it's yeah.
[03:09.020 --> 03:13.540]  I mean, when the Golden State Warriors are playing, you try to get people to work.
[03:13.540 --> 03:24.420]  So I mean, as hash makers, there's so many talented ones like that are not in the market.
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.420]  And I really feel.
[03:25.420 --> 03:30.420]  Maybe what methodologies have come on the scene in the past two or three years that
[03:30.420 --> 03:32.420]  you're like, that's pretty cool.
[03:32.420 --> 03:33.700]  That's like an innovative.
[03:33.700 --> 03:38.740]  I think what's really beautiful is seeing all the hash makers have their own little
[03:38.740 --> 03:39.740]  niche.
[03:39.740 --> 03:47.940]  Like they're all like some people like rosin, some people like, you know, rosin that's buttery.
[03:47.940 --> 03:50.220]  Some people like broken rosin.
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.900]  Everyone's kind of expressing themselves in all these manners.
[03:52.900 --> 03:57.420]  And I think that's super cool that they have that mastery over the plant.
[03:57.420 --> 04:02.460]  I come from a completely different school of thought where I'm like, if the farmer is
[04:02.460 --> 04:04.460]  good, the hash will be good.
[04:04.460 --> 04:07.460]  Yeah, but the rosin is the same.
[04:07.460 --> 04:11.460]  If they harvest early, you don't have rosin in your head.
[04:11.460 --> 04:13.460]  Yeah, but for me, I like full spectrum.
[04:13.460 --> 04:15.460]  Like I like full spectrum hash.
[04:15.460 --> 04:20.460]  I like smoking full spectrum hash.
[04:20.460 --> 04:22.460]  I feel like the high is a little different.
[04:22.460 --> 04:25.460]  Well, doing hash, you're pretty limited.
[04:25.460 --> 04:30.460]  Opening is to be to have that whole new play field with CBD.
[04:30.460 --> 04:36.460]  And then because we have ICBD, we can play around with ICBC, with ITHCV.
[04:36.460 --> 04:43.460]  We can play around with a lot of main, the main cannabinoid of the specific train.
[04:43.460 --> 04:45.460]  But it's like it's pretty limited.
[04:45.460 --> 04:53.460]  But at the same time, like I was telling you, it's like when you make hash in the resin,
[04:53.460 --> 05:01.460]  in the body of the end product, there is a matrix that created all those cannabinoids
[05:01.460 --> 05:02.460]  and all those terpene.
[05:02.460 --> 05:07.460]  Like in a wine, you need the skin to make the wine.
[05:07.460 --> 05:14.460]  You can extract alcohol from the seeds and from the juice, but you cannot make wine if
[05:14.460 --> 05:20.460]  you don't have that matrix that created the juice and the sugar.
[05:20.460 --> 05:28.460]  So when we go into the world of extraction, they have an expansion and a domain of diversity
[05:28.460 --> 05:34.460]  that is fucking unreal that we don't have when you make traditional hash.
[05:34.460 --> 05:42.460]  So it's like it's all under the concentrate umbrella, but we are closer to the entourage
[05:42.460 --> 05:47.460]  effect and the main gift of the plant.
[05:47.460 --> 05:53.460]  But our play field is much more limited than even guy making rosin because...
[05:53.460 --> 05:56.460]  He can still clean stuff up.
[05:56.460 --> 05:58.460]  You know, he's still...
[05:58.460 --> 06:03.460]  It's like you take the juice from the fruit when you do rosin, you extract.
[06:03.460 --> 06:10.460]  But you just with mechanical separation, you can do some crazy stuff that we didn't think
[06:10.460 --> 06:13.460]  we could have not even two years ago.
[06:14.460 --> 06:20.460]  To see every different new type of consistency, the way hash is moving in the US, I mean,
[06:20.460 --> 06:27.460]  it's like it's at the forefront at experimenting in all of those little things.
