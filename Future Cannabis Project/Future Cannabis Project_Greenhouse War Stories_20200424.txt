[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  How you doing?
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  I'm doing great.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.000]  Just waiting on the new baby.
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  Awesome.
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  Okay, cool.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.000]  Right on.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  Yeah, a couple of days maybe I'll have a new son popping up.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  Nice.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  That's awesome.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Home birth or what?
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  No, we're going to go to the hospital.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Okay.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.640]  We have local consultants and stuff we work with, but the hospital to me is a good spot
[00:25.640 --> 00:27.000]  in case anything happens.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.880]  No, it is.
[00:28.880 --> 00:33.720]  It's just with all these new fucking rules and stuff, it's a little bit more challenging
[00:33.720 --> 00:37.040]  to like hang out and stuff sometimes from what I've heard.
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.720]  Yeah, what they do at like the clinic locally is they segregate the maternity section so
[00:43.720 --> 00:48.120]  that only maternity enters in and it's cleaner than a hospital.
[00:48.120 --> 00:49.120]  You know what I mean?
[00:49.120 --> 00:50.120]  Like sterile stuff.
[00:50.120 --> 00:51.120]  Right.
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.000]  And then the same thing will happen with when we go with the birth where she and I'll go
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.240]  in, they'll screen me first to make sure I'm not contaminated.
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.440]  And then I basically sequestered at the hospital for the duration of the baby stay there.
[01:04.440 --> 01:06.120]  You can't leave and come back.
[01:06.120 --> 01:07.120]  So I got my own little bag.
[01:07.120 --> 01:09.120]  I got some books packed.
[01:09.120 --> 01:10.640]  Oh, nice.
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  That's good.
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  I didn't know you could do that.
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.880]  I've heard other things where the dad can stay a little bit and then they got to bounce
[01:15.880 --> 01:16.880]  or whatever.
[01:16.880 --> 01:17.880]  That's killer.
[01:17.880 --> 01:18.880]  You get to stay.
[01:18.880 --> 01:19.880]  Yeah.
[01:19.880 --> 01:20.880]  I think they even give me a bed to sleep in.
[01:21.120 --> 01:24.120]  So I brought some gear.
[01:24.120 --> 01:25.120]  Just no smoke.
[01:25.120 --> 01:26.120]  I don't think they're going to let me blink.
[01:26.120 --> 01:33.120]  I'll be like, hey, I brought my essential stuff.
[01:33.120 --> 01:37.120]  Yeah, this shit's deemed essential, man.
[01:37.120 --> 01:38.960]  It's a miracle.
[01:38.960 --> 01:39.960]  Some edibles.
[01:39.960 --> 01:40.960]  Can make some edibles.
[01:40.960 --> 01:41.960]  All right.
[01:41.960 --> 01:42.960]  Well, why don't we kick it off?
[01:42.960 --> 01:49.300]  So for everybody who's watching, let me just quickly cut to that screen.
[01:49.300 --> 01:50.680]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.920]  That's who we're talking with.
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.120]  Scott's going to be coming back after he gets his laptop charger.
[01:58.120 --> 02:00.120]  So we could go anywhere.
[02:00.120 --> 02:05.240]  I mean, we can start in a direction, but I'm hoping that people who are watching will start
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.120]  lobbying questions in.
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.640]  You guys all have domain expertise across cultivation.
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.840]  And I mean, I loosely titled it something related to greenhouses.
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.120]  But I mean, Scott thinks about soil all day.
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.560]  Kevin thinks cultivation.
[02:21.560 --> 02:23.640]  And Eric thinks greenhouses as a generality.
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.080]  So why don't we start?
[02:27.080 --> 02:34.720]  I mean, Eric, talk about one of the things we talked about briefly the other day, which
[02:34.720 --> 02:40.880]  going from some of the smaller greenhouses you've been consulting with to kind of you're
[02:40.880 --> 02:46.400]  now doing a project down in Salinas, which is a much larger project.
[02:46.400 --> 02:52.000]  Can you talk about kind of some of the nuanced differences of scaling up?
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.560]  Yeah, sure.
[02:56.040 --> 02:58.240]  Yeah, it's an interesting project for sure.
[02:58.240 --> 03:02.720]  I mean, I've been involved in dealing with a lot of these bigger greenhouses when I was
[03:02.720 --> 03:06.040]  doing procurement and doing the designing and equipment.
[03:06.040 --> 03:12.000]  But now we've come to a whole new level where I'm involved in the production side of
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.440]  things, the actual operations of the greenhouse.
[03:14.440 --> 03:17.280]  And there's just a lot of moving parts.
[03:17.280 --> 03:23.000]  I was really surprised to see or I'm fascinated by how many moving parts there really are
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.480]  with these big greenhouses.
[03:24.480 --> 03:29.240]  And on the corporate side of things, whether it's a single investor or a big corporate
[03:29.240 --> 03:33.640]  group or whatever, this corporate stuff is really, really slow.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.200]  There's nothing that's fast about corporate cannabis.
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.520]  You know, like on the smaller scale, we want something done.
[03:40.520 --> 03:41.960]  We get it done that day or the week.
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.120]  Well, Kevin, I think we're picking up someone in the background of your is that.
[03:51.760 --> 03:53.560]  Anybody, I don't think so.
[03:53.760 --> 04:02.240]  There's a lot of things that we talk about in order to, you know, get stuff done, basically.
[04:07.110 --> 04:14.670]  Got it. So, I mean, I think and by the way, like you can jump in.
[04:14.670 --> 04:20.270]  I mean, I'm sort of lobbying questions and as like, yeah, an incultivator, but like,
[04:20.470 --> 04:23.990]  we'll kind of go around like, what would you want to pick Eric's brain about, about
[04:23.990 --> 04:26.230]  what he's working on and what he's seeing out there?
[04:26.230 --> 04:28.750]  And then we'll kind of rotate over to you and over to Scott.
[04:28.750 --> 04:36.190]  So. Well, I think that, you know, I mean, Eric's somebody that like when I purchased
[04:36.190 --> 04:41.870]  the greenhouse and it's no disrespect to the company, but I actually purchased the
[04:41.870 --> 04:46.990]  house because I was purchasing Eric as part of the company, because what I wanted was
[04:46.990 --> 04:52.350]  I wanted troubleshooting support and I wanted someone who was conscientious about
[04:52.350 --> 04:58.710]  trying to cut costs and keep profitability high and not make tremendous problems for
[04:58.710 --> 05:04.110]  the operator. And I think that that's the component that's taken place when you make
[05:04.110 --> 05:08.910]  these transitions from small to big is that you're I always used to say the same
[05:08.910 --> 05:11.110]  thing. Most people learn how to grow in a closet.
[05:11.270 --> 05:15.870]  And when they built a big operation, they just made that closet module bigger.
[05:16.790 --> 05:22.550]  And when you're talking about these large operations, the investor groups had to sink
[05:22.550 --> 05:25.350]  in, say, some of these ops, you know, 40, 50 million dollars.
[05:25.910 --> 05:29.430]  So when you've when you've got 40 million dollars of someone else's money that you're
[05:29.430 --> 05:34.630]  responsible for, they always move slowly because they can't make mistakes and come
[05:34.630 --> 05:40.950]  back from it. It damages their reputations, but it creates a situation where they have
[05:40.950 --> 05:45.070]  to get people that are competent at running operations that are acre level and above
[05:45.390 --> 05:49.230]  undercover. And that's extremely rare for the old cannabis industry.
[05:49.230 --> 05:52.790]  There was nobody running operations that big, period.
[05:53.350 --> 05:57.510]  And so that's where these problems are, is that when I get brought into jobs, a lot of
[05:57.510 --> 06:01.750]  times it's just take a look at the project and we realize that the people that they
[06:01.750 --> 06:05.950]  brought in were competent for, you know, 5000 square feet, but they're most definitely
[06:05.950 --> 06:08.350]  not competent for 300000 square feet.
[06:09.830 --> 06:14.870]  And that's that's that's a that's a real problem in the industry, and that's why you're
[06:14.870 --> 06:16.790]  seeing so many of these big ops fail.
[06:16.790 --> 06:18.270]  It isn't because anybody's stupid.
[06:18.790 --> 06:26.070]  It's that the approach to it isn't appropriate where the individuals who are running the
[06:26.070 --> 06:30.550]  facility have to have acre level operational experience.
[06:30.830 --> 06:35.590]  And then the individuals that integrate how you grow cannabis in terms of what the market
[06:35.590 --> 06:39.790]  wants and how do we position it price wise and how do we position it in its sale points.
[06:40.470 --> 06:44.630]  There's this disconnect between the three groups, the commercial operator who's used to
[06:44.630 --> 06:49.190]  running tomato, who knows how to run a facility, knows how to run injections, knows how
[06:49.190 --> 06:53.350]  to maintain your your diff so that you're not having environmental fluctuations.
[06:53.830 --> 06:59.550]  The person who knows her and a cat that has the money, that process is not quick like it
[06:59.550 --> 07:02.150]  used to be for us when we were in self more self-control.
[07:03.430 --> 07:07.310]  And so when I go into these operations, too, I trip out because you think it's going to
[07:07.310 --> 07:12.310]  be a quick decision, but it's a long, laborious, dragged out process.
[07:12.950 --> 07:15.950]  And there's only so many guys like, you know, we use Erica as an example because I
[07:15.950 --> 07:19.590]  respect the shit. There's only so many of them in the industry where they have
[07:19.590 --> 07:23.350]  commercial level knowledge, but they understand cannabis as a product.
[07:24.350 --> 07:27.750]  So I say, yeah, that's what I run into all the time.
[07:31.510 --> 07:35.990]  Go ahead. Is that. Yeah, Kevin's exactly right.
[07:35.990 --> 07:40.150]  And that that's exactly what I'm seeing a lot is that, yeah, there's people that know
[07:40.150 --> 07:44.110]  the shit out of cannabis, but moving at big scale and keeping it efficient.
[07:44.630 --> 07:48.630]  A lot of times the cost of production really goes up because people bring a lot of the.
[07:48.870 --> 07:52.420]  What I think we lost.
[07:54.940 --> 07:57.540]  Hold on, Eric, you there.
[07:58.660 --> 08:00.900]  Only if I can hear me.
[08:01.540 --> 08:06.140]  Yeah. So you cut out at the cost of production, the cost of production goes up.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.340]  So can you start back there?
[08:08.300 --> 08:12.940]  Yeah. The cost of production really goes up as people start to try to bring in the
[08:12.980 --> 08:17.580]  original nutrients or programs that they had before, because now you're working at
[08:17.620 --> 08:20.660]  a lot bigger commercial ag level and you need.
[08:22.500 --> 08:31.540]  Eric, you you cut out again.
[08:34.340 --> 08:36.780]  Well, let me let me see about switching.
[08:37.020 --> 08:42.740]  Can you hear me now? I'm going to stop the video and see if that makes it easier on
[08:42.740 --> 08:45.460]  the system there. Yeah, that's better.
[08:45.500 --> 08:48.300]  OK, so. So, yeah, maybe you start at the top again.
[08:48.420 --> 08:53.300]  OK, so, yeah, basically what's happening is, is there's only a fraction of big
[08:53.300 --> 08:58.100]  greenhouse guys that want to get into cannabis and a lot of them that have gotten
[08:58.100 --> 09:02.180]  into cannabis aren't really interested in hanging out with the cannabis people, if
[09:02.180 --> 09:06.900]  that makes sense. And so we had a big disconnect where big ag tried to come in
[09:06.900 --> 09:10.260]  that didn't know cannabis lost their ass because they didn't know the cannabis
[09:10.260 --> 09:14.300]  aspect. And then you have the cannabis people that didn't have the big ag guys
[09:14.340 --> 09:18.340]  to help them along. And there's only a small fraction of big ag guys that even
[09:18.340 --> 09:22.700]  want to be involved in cannabis and make friends, I guess, with the cannabis people,
[09:22.700 --> 09:25.660]  so to speak. And so it's really a culture thing.
[09:25.700 --> 09:27.300]  It's always been a culture thing.
[09:27.300 --> 09:31.780]  But now on this big level, there's also the culture of cannabis people getting
[09:31.780 --> 09:36.780]  together with the big ag people and everybody getting along and having the same
[09:36.780 --> 09:43.580]  goals. And, you know, this this big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big
[09:43.820 --> 09:46.740]  this go forward approach, we're going to win type of thing.
[09:46.740 --> 09:51.380]  It's really turns into an ego battle of these guys know this, these guys know that
[09:51.380 --> 09:55.220]  and nobody really actually vibes together on these jobs.
[09:55.220 --> 09:59.260]  And so when you finally get the vibes right and you have these big ag guys that
[09:59.260 --> 10:02.820]  really love cannabis and really love what they're doing and are really interested in
[10:02.820 --> 10:07.020]  what you have to say a lot of times, whether you're right or wrong, they're open to
[10:07.020 --> 10:08.060]  the conversation.
[10:09.460 --> 10:12.260]  You get so many more things done and those are the ones that are going to make it,
[10:12.260 --> 10:15.780]  unfortunately, like Kevin was saying, there's not a lot of those.
[10:16.100 --> 10:18.340]  I can't believe it.
[10:18.340 --> 10:22.020]  I'm starting to really pay attention to this more and I'm kind of shocked at how
[10:22.020 --> 10:27.660]  many people are running big stuff but aren't doing it from the experience of the
[10:27.660 --> 10:29.980]  ag and running big greenhouses.
[10:29.980 --> 10:33.580]  It's it's it's it's kind of surprising.
[10:33.580 --> 10:36.940]  But at the same time, if you look at all the pot stocks and the way Canada was going
[10:36.940 --> 10:41.460]  and these big, massive greenhouses, how popular extractions are and things like
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.700]  that, a lot of these people are getting by.
[10:43.700 --> 10:46.940]  But I mean, they're bleeding out pretty good.
[10:46.940 --> 10:51.380]  And so, you know, we're starting to see a lot of, you know, especially up in Canada,
[10:51.380 --> 10:54.220]  the bankruptcies and different things moving to outdoor.
[10:54.540 --> 10:58.460]  You know, it's like all of a sudden everybody's going to be a big outdoor grower.
[10:58.460 --> 11:03.180]  And it's like, fuck, that's what we started with, you know, and it's kind of coming
[11:03.180 --> 11:04.140]  full circle now.
[11:04.140 --> 11:09.620]  So, I mean, it's really important to get these things dialed in and work with the
[11:09.620 --> 11:12.620]  right people and knowing who the right people are.
[11:12.620 --> 11:13.460]  That's the other thing.
[11:13.460 --> 11:14.660]  It's just like the consumers.
[11:14.660 --> 11:16.460]  They don't all know what good quality is.
[11:16.700 --> 11:20.820]  And a lot of the people that are involved in this don't know who the good people are
[11:20.820 --> 11:25.180]  either because there's so many people on LinkedIn and all over the place that come
[11:25.180 --> 11:26.380]  off like professionals.
[11:26.380 --> 11:29.580]  But it's really hard to vet people these days.
[11:29.580 --> 11:34.220]  I mean, I've been lucky enough to have been around the community and knowing Kevin and
[11:34.220 --> 11:35.900]  Scott and all these different people.
[11:35.900 --> 11:39.780]  And so, we actually do pull from each other from time to time.
[11:39.780 --> 11:43.460]  You know, a lot of us will reach out to each other and say, you know, I got this
[11:43.460 --> 11:44.180]  situation.
[11:44.180 --> 11:46.420]  Who's the best person to talk to about this?
[11:46.740 --> 11:48.180]  And it could be irrigation.
[11:48.180 --> 11:49.380]  It could be genetics.
[11:49.380 --> 11:52.300]  It could be, you know, pinpointing one or two things.
[11:52.300 --> 11:57.660]  But we try to source and deal with the best of the best in those particular categories
[11:57.860 --> 12:00.100]  in order to make a lot of these big things work.
[12:01.100 --> 12:02.100]  No, totally.
[12:02.100 --> 12:08.100]  I don't do consulting as a business, so to speak, because I have my own businesses.
[12:08.100 --> 12:13.100]  What I do, though, is I get brought in by people that ask and say, hey, can you come
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.340]  in and take a look at this?
[12:14.340 --> 12:18.220]  And then I try to figure out where I see the evident problems.
[12:18.220 --> 12:21.100]  And then I try to get the people together to see where there's friction.
[12:21.100 --> 12:28.100]  And then I can try to figure out from my, you know, pool of professionals that I know
[12:28.500 --> 12:32.820]  in the industry who might be someone that we could bring in, who might be looking for
[12:32.820 --> 12:34.300]  a new career opportunity.
[12:34.940 --> 12:38.060]  And it's to create a success.
[12:38.740 --> 12:42.740]  And the thing is that when you're building an industry, everyone at first was so hyper
[12:42.740 --> 12:45.420]  competitive that each person was going to be the top of the food chain.
[12:45.420 --> 12:46.540]  Everybody went huge.
[12:46.580 --> 12:48.060]  They were going to take over the industry.
[12:48.140 --> 12:51.900]  They all got the shit kicked out of them, which just makes me fucking overjoyed.
[12:52.460 --> 12:56.740]  Because what it does is it allows there to be a pace of development that lets
[12:56.740 --> 13:01.180]  stratification for all operators to fit in where these mega operations, they need to
[13:01.180 --> 13:04.420]  succeed. They need to satisfy the low cost markets.
[13:04.420 --> 13:07.020]  They need to satisfy globalism.
[13:07.300 --> 13:12.700]  And then it creates the awareness of what small scale is because you have a comparison.
[13:13.540 --> 13:18.260]  And a lot of it is just trying to source through the industry that we know from being in
[13:18.260 --> 13:21.820]  the industry and just saying, hey, this is the right person for the job.
[13:22.220 --> 13:27.100]  I know my limitations and I'm not afraid to admit them because that's not where I'm
[13:27.100 --> 13:30.340]  trying to make my my win in the things that I'm good at.
[13:30.340 --> 13:31.900]  I try to be very good at them.
[13:32.380 --> 13:38.340]  And what I've seen so much is that everyone lied through their fucking teeth and no one
[13:38.340 --> 13:40.660]  told the truth about their limitations.
[13:40.660 --> 13:47.700]  And so these investors are coming in to do business and they get lied to by operators
[13:47.700 --> 13:51.780]  and you go into these places and you're like, who the hell designed this shit?
[13:52.700 --> 13:57.020]  And you realize that the direction was steered from the initial wrong.
[13:57.860 --> 14:01.100]  And what it does is it makes all of us look stupid.
[14:01.420 --> 14:05.660]  And that's the problem is that it diminishes us as cannabis operators because we all look
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.700]  like we're charlatans.
[14:07.020 --> 14:11.660]  So instead of telling somebody that you're a fucking virologist when really you know how
[14:11.660 --> 14:16.300]  to use a pump sprayer, it would it would help because then you can actually hire a
[14:16.300 --> 14:20.700]  virologist and you can guide the investment and you can guide the project.
[14:20.700 --> 14:25.020]  And in the success of it, you develop your reputation, you develop your success.
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.820]  But that's not what happened.
[14:27.180 --> 14:30.260]  Man, like this is a train wreck and it'll clear itself up.
[14:30.260 --> 14:32.740]  But some of the stuff I've seen is just crazy.
[14:33.340 --> 14:37.140]  And it's the teething of a new industry.
[14:37.300 --> 14:40.860]  You know, whatever we did prior is irrelevant to a couple of years ago.
[14:40.900 --> 14:42.700]  It really is this point forward.
[14:43.180 --> 14:48.220]  And it requires all of us to be a little bit more honest about what we're good at, what
[14:48.220 --> 14:53.420]  we're not good at. And don't be ashamed to reach out for assistance and don't be afraid
[14:53.420 --> 14:54.980]  to say, look, I know what I'm talking about.
[14:54.980 --> 14:55.900]  And that's just what it is.
[14:56.860 --> 15:00.220]  Can each of you just give us a couple of more kind of.
[15:01.900 --> 15:07.740]  So just quickly, can each of you give a couple of kind of like bad news, there's things
[15:07.900 --> 15:12.100]  witness houses that you've seen fairly frequently.
[15:13.540 --> 15:17.340]  Oh, hell yeah. Yeah, actually, Kevin's
[15:18.820 --> 15:23.060]  photo was exactly right in the sense that who's designing these things.
[15:23.060 --> 15:28.500]  And that's one of my starting points for the war stories is like, who thought this up,
[15:28.500 --> 15:31.140]  who designed it and who said OK to all these things?
[15:31.140 --> 15:34.820]  Because nine times out of 10, when you get in there with the cultivator or somebody that
[15:34.820 --> 15:40.220]  knows what's up, the greenhouse facility isn't designed for working smarter, not harder,
[15:40.220 --> 15:45.820]  basically. And what it is, is a lot of the greenhouse companies design them, the builders
[15:45.820 --> 15:48.060]  that build them, sell them and design them.
[15:48.300 --> 15:52.660]  And what I found is, is sometimes these guys will sprinkle in a little bit of everything
[15:52.660 --> 15:55.900]  that they've done at one of these jobs to make this one masterpiece.
[15:55.900 --> 16:00.260]  It's got a little a little bell and whistle of all these different little tricks.
[16:00.540 --> 16:04.420]  And at the end of the day, we didn't need all those bells and whistles or little tricks
[16:04.420 --> 16:07.180]  or maybe we need the whole trick and not part of the trick, you know.
[16:07.180 --> 16:10.900]  And and we get into these situations where the workflow isn't right.
[16:10.900 --> 16:12.340]  And you go, who the fuck thought of this?
[16:12.340 --> 16:16.540]  And then it's like, well, we went with this, you know, company that's been designing
[16:16.540 --> 16:19.900]  greenhouses for 40 years, but they've never grown anything one time.
[16:19.900 --> 16:25.180]  And all their knowledge for growing comes from the people that have grown in them before,
[16:25.180 --> 16:27.740]  you know, the other vegetable growers and things like that.
[16:27.740 --> 16:32.580]  It's not the cannabis growers in specific regions and states that, you know, have these
[16:32.580 --> 16:36.420]  certain climates that everybody's only grown primarily in the summertime.
[16:36.780 --> 16:38.620]  You know, it's just a whole different deal.
[16:38.620 --> 16:43.660]  And that's where I kind of get up, you know, a lot of calls or situations in is like the
[16:43.660 --> 16:46.180]  designing and the spending of the money.
[16:46.180 --> 16:47.700]  It's like that's the easy part.
[16:47.700 --> 16:49.780]  And then they got to have somebody actually go grow it.
[16:49.980 --> 16:54.900]  And none of these guys in these big, scalable facilities were designed by who's running
[16:54.900 --> 16:59.220]  it. Like I haven't ran into one yet that is designed by the guy that's running it.
[16:59.220 --> 17:05.660]  That guy's usually gone before the fucking shovels even, you know, the start the job.
[17:05.900 --> 17:11.380]  And how many times is a cultivator asked to operate something or use nutrients that they
[17:11.380 --> 17:13.300]  weren't involved in any of those decisions?
[17:13.300 --> 17:15.700]  Like this guy here, by the way, I just got in.
[17:15.700 --> 17:22.820]  Sorry. But a lot of times we get brought into a facility and a bunch of boardroom members
[17:22.820 --> 17:27.980]  decided facility layout, nutrient considerations, whether they're doing cocoa buckets,
[17:27.980 --> 17:32.620]  what have you. And then they throw a cultivator in there and say, all right, here's what we
[17:32.620 --> 17:33.620]  got for you. Go.
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.780]  Yeah, that's the worst.
[17:37.300 --> 17:42.620]  That's that's probably 80 percent of the cultivator, though, the cultivator is going to
[17:42.620 --> 17:47.660]  say, listen, you're you're putting me over a fucking barrel and I'm going to look like I'm
[17:47.660 --> 17:49.460]  an idiot if I do this.
[17:49.700 --> 17:54.020]  And you have to be able to have faith in yourself to say I need to leave the job.
[17:54.540 --> 17:59.180]  And the problem is, is that you see the potential so greatly, at least from my experiences
[17:59.180 --> 18:03.220]  with when I talk to the operators that are running these projects that were created by
[18:03.460 --> 18:09.300]  five or six people before them, like the chain of failure isn't just one person made a
[18:09.300 --> 18:10.660]  mistake and everyone else pays.
[18:11.100 --> 18:14.540]  You're talking multiple CEOs that got canned because they couldn't.
[18:14.740 --> 18:17.020]  The investors canned the management group.
[18:17.540 --> 18:20.540]  Everyone that the management group brought in got canned.
[18:20.700 --> 18:24.660]  And a lot of times they can the guys that was smart because they were argumentative,
[18:24.660 --> 18:26.740]  because they disagreed with the approach.
[18:27.500 --> 18:31.260]  And so the people that had intelligence got weeded out.
[18:31.500 --> 18:34.860]  People that were basically able to tell a good story remained.
[18:35.260 --> 18:37.660]  They design a system that's don't fuck up.
[18:38.220 --> 18:41.260]  And then the cultivator that's supposed to be there to run it gets screwed.
[18:41.260 --> 18:42.260]  But that's in life.
[18:42.460 --> 18:47.300]  When you're in a situation that doesn't pay off for you, it's best if you leave and find
[18:47.300 --> 18:52.220]  another operation. Or what happens is you struggle, you fail, you emotionally get wiped
[18:52.220 --> 18:56.140]  out because you want to succeed and then you're attached to that operation.
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.220]  And that's part of it, too.
[18:58.420 --> 19:03.300]  My thing with cultivators is you need to vet the owners, the operators, the designers as
[19:03.300 --> 19:05.460]  much as you do you.
[19:05.580 --> 19:10.020]  It's both. You have to look at each other or otherwise there's no way you can do these
[19:10.020 --> 19:16.260]  projects. It's not so simple, but it's the way that it's been laid out.
[19:17.500 --> 19:21.220]  And I think that for cultivators, I get hit up constantly saying, hey, I'm in this
[19:21.220 --> 19:22.740]  position and I think it sucks.
[19:22.740 --> 19:24.020]  And they said, what do you think I should do?
[19:24.020 --> 19:25.900]  And I tell them, tell them, fuck off and get another job.
[19:26.420 --> 19:30.180]  Because if they're going to if they're going to break your balls over every detail that
[19:30.180 --> 19:34.300]  they want you to execute, that doesn't make any sense because it's the motion that they
[19:34.300 --> 19:35.260]  set in play.
[19:36.140 --> 19:38.820]  That's ego and you can't win there.
[19:38.860 --> 19:41.660]  So cultivators with egos that won't listen can't win.
[19:42.140 --> 19:45.820]  CEOs, investment groups with egos can't win.
[19:45.820 --> 19:51.180]  So that's the part that's getting cleaned out right now to where eventually as we go
[19:51.180 --> 19:55.580]  forward, you'll have cannabis operators that have success in operation being involved
[19:55.580 --> 19:59.220]  with the design, just like a good builder is involved with the architect.
[19:59.580 --> 20:03.300]  The architect creates a project, but the builder who builds it is part of the
[20:03.300 --> 20:05.700]  integration. So he can say, look, I see problems.
[20:06.300 --> 20:09.340]  And that's the thing is I see people making changes constantly.
[20:09.380 --> 20:12.580]  I don't see anything built and then ran as built.
[20:12.980 --> 20:15.740]  It gets completely modified over and over and over.
[20:15.740 --> 20:18.980]  By the time you come in, you just like you don't understand what anybody's doing.
[20:19.500 --> 20:20.900]  And salespeople are good, man.
[20:20.900 --> 20:25.460]  They're going off on you go to LinkedIn, anything you post, God help you.
[20:25.460 --> 20:30.100]  But anything you post, every reply is someone trying to sell you a product to go along
[20:30.100 --> 20:31.380]  with that thing you're doing.
[20:31.860 --> 20:34.860]  And so the thing is, you're getting bombarded nonstop with stuff.
[20:35.660 --> 20:38.260]  How do you even know what anyone's using?
[20:38.260 --> 20:39.580]  How do you know where there's success?
[20:39.580 --> 20:40.820]  We don't have a database.
[20:40.820 --> 20:42.140]  You don't have a blacklist.
[20:42.700 --> 20:44.220]  You know, it's tough.
[20:45.500 --> 20:50.540]  So, by the way, just quickly, Scott, the guy who ran the
[20:50.540 --> 20:55.580]  carpentry facility into the ground is now the CEO of said company.
[20:58.180 --> 20:59.500]  I just that's amazing.
[21:00.300 --> 21:01.300]  That's amazing.
[21:01.940 --> 21:02.940]  That's amazing.
[21:03.140 --> 21:04.420]  I got in the wrong business.
[21:06.060 --> 21:07.060]  I know.
[21:07.780 --> 21:08.940]  How are they still in business?
[21:08.940 --> 21:09.940]  That's what's remarkable.
[21:10.180 --> 21:11.180]  That gives me hope.
[21:11.180 --> 21:12.180]  But to go back to a.
[21:12.180 --> 21:13.660]  They're not really still in business.
[21:13.660 --> 21:14.660]  But anyway, go ahead.
[21:14.660 --> 21:15.660]  Yeah.
[21:15.660 --> 21:20.620]  But to go back to a point that Kevin made that I think was really spot on is, you know,
[21:20.620 --> 21:25.420]  a lot of times we come into a facility under, you know, unfortunate circumstances trying
[21:25.420 --> 21:26.220]  to make them better.
[21:26.220 --> 21:32.860]  And a really common pattern we see is there's an investment group that built what they
[21:32.860 --> 21:37.900]  believe to be a state of the art facility that's actually maybe, you know, some range
[21:37.900 --> 21:40.620]  of a pile of shit to moderately successful.
[21:41.340 --> 21:46.540]  And they don't want to admit that they built a bad facility or they don't want to
[21:46.540 --> 21:50.060]  admit that they made a wrong decision or maybe they don't want to admit that one of
[21:50.060 --> 21:52.220]  these sales people lied to them.
[21:52.220 --> 21:55.820]  So there's a lot of that ego factor that really leads to prolonged failure.
[21:57.140 --> 22:00.660]  And a lot of times these facilities, like Kevin said, they might, you know, they might
[22:00.660 --> 22:04.340]  have a cultivator that ran a four lighter and eight lighter and they try and put.
[22:04.780 --> 22:06.260]  What we just lost you.
[22:08.260 --> 22:10.180]  You there, Scott.
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.620]  For the job.
[22:14.100 --> 22:16.100]  And there seems to be like these remarkably.
[22:16.100 --> 22:21.540]  Scott, Scott, can you take it back to somebody who ran a four lighter, an eight lighter
[22:21.540 --> 22:22.980]  and then whatever you said after that?
[22:24.700 --> 22:30.300]  In essence, what I was saying is the common patterns are you have investment groups that
[22:30.300 --> 22:33.220]  maybe don't want to admit that they made bad decisions along the way that they built
[22:33.220 --> 22:37.420]  bad decisions along the way that's leading to their failure or they don't want to admit
[22:37.420 --> 22:43.380]  that they have the wrong cultivator in position and they just get really, really married
[22:43.380 --> 22:46.100]  to those things and just write them off into the ground.
[22:46.140 --> 22:51.900]  And I would say, you know, probably the top three reasons for failure of a facility that
[22:51.900 --> 22:55.140]  we see are investment group that doesn't want to admit that they built the wrong
[22:55.140 --> 22:59.020]  building investment group that doesn't want to admit they've got the wrong cultivator
[22:59.180 --> 23:02.980]  or a cultivator that doesn't want to admit that he doesn't have the skills and doesn't
[23:02.980 --> 23:04.820]  seek the help needed to be successful.
[23:06.500 --> 23:07.380]  Straight up.
[23:07.780 --> 23:09.700]  Yeah, I'd say those are the numbers.
[23:10.060 --> 23:11.540]  Yeah. So a couple.
[23:12.140 --> 23:16.020]  No, no, no. I was just going to say a couple of specificity questions between the three
[23:16.020 --> 23:22.540]  of you. What percentage of the greenhouses you're going into are retrofit versus new
[23:22.540 --> 23:27.140]  state of the art? And then when you're talking about the new buildings that they build the
[23:27.140 --> 23:32.620]  wrong way, what are some common things that they do that like examples of things they
[23:32.620 --> 23:34.620]  did wrong, even though it's a brand new building?
[23:37.340 --> 23:39.420]  I think I see earlier on.
[23:41.900 --> 23:43.260]  They go, you know, Scott.
[23:44.700 --> 23:45.700]  Oh, sorry.
[23:47.180 --> 23:50.020]  You know, earlier on when I wasn't here, I was listening to what you guys were saying.
[23:50.020 --> 23:55.580]  And, you know, at the infancy of the market, to be fair, there was a you know, there's
[23:55.580 --> 23:57.580]  50 percent snakes and 50 percent.
[23:57.580 --> 24:01.420]  We just don't know. Like Kevin was saying earlier, we haven't gone this big before.
[24:01.420 --> 24:07.820]  And so there's a lot of guessing or hoping or, you know, somebody convincing you this
[24:07.820 --> 24:12.700]  is the path. And it turns out not to be appropriate at scale and it doesn't work
[24:12.700 --> 24:17.260]  properly. And.
[24:19.420 --> 24:25.180]  Yeah, well, for me, I end up in a lot of new greenhouses, but it's almost 50 50
[24:25.180 --> 24:28.060]  sometimes because there's a lot of retrofits that do go on.
[24:28.060 --> 24:33.100]  But at the end of the day, a lot of the new stuff is even basic hoops, new PVC.
[24:33.420 --> 24:38.060]  You know, I mean, it's not always big, massive, fancy greenhouses because people are
[24:38.060 --> 24:43.980]  scaling up to ten thousand square feet or more with PVC hoops and trying to do AG exempt
[24:43.980 --> 24:47.660]  stuff. And they're getting all new plastics and new way of doing things.
[24:47.660 --> 24:53.580]  And so scaling up isn't always a fancy, you know, state of the art new greenhouse these
[24:53.580 --> 24:56.780]  days. It's a mixed bag, so to speak.
[24:56.780 --> 25:00.300]  And so while there's a lot of new, there's still a lot of retrofits going on.
[25:00.300 --> 25:05.340]  And some of the common mistakes are just things that for workflow, for contamination
[25:05.340 --> 25:09.580]  purposes. You know, one of the things that we deal with a lot and I don't want to speak
[25:09.580 --> 25:14.540]  for both Kevin and Scott, but I know we all deal with it is the cross contamination and
[25:14.540 --> 25:18.060]  setting up a workflow so that people aren't going backwards.
[25:18.460 --> 25:22.380]  And it's really easy to have a facility that causes people to go from clone rooms to
[25:22.380 --> 25:26.780]  flowering rooms or pass by the same doors or the same areas sometimes.
[25:26.780 --> 25:30.140]  And they don't realize that some of that stuff needs to be separated.
[25:30.140 --> 25:34.220]  And some of these massive facilities, you know, we try to create people that only work
[25:34.220 --> 25:37.180]  in the veg zones. They don't go over to flowering the propagation.
[25:37.180 --> 25:41.900]  People stay in the propagation when, you know, tours don't necessarily start out in the
[25:41.900 --> 25:44.380]  flowering rooms and then end up in the cloning rooms.
[25:44.380 --> 25:48.620]  I mean, which is most common, very common because I get a lot I get toured around a
[25:48.620 --> 25:52.860]  lot and it's, you know, people are starting to get the hang of it a little bit.
[25:52.860 --> 25:56.620]  But when it comes to the design, you know, it makes sense on paper.
[25:56.620 --> 26:00.300]  If I was somebody that just was looking at something cool on paper, I would say, yeah,
[26:00.300 --> 26:05.020]  that's beautiful. But if you don't take into the considerations that we're thinking about
[26:05.020 --> 26:08.620]  or the fallout that we've seen for some of these reasons, then you'd look at these
[26:08.620 --> 26:10.220]  drawings and go, this is crazy.
[26:10.220 --> 26:12.060]  This is like, no way.
[26:13.100 --> 26:15.340]  And so, you know, I don't know.
[26:15.340 --> 26:16.380]  What do you think, Kevin?
[26:17.260 --> 26:25.340]  I don't I don't think I think for me, I see new facilities, both small ag exempt poops
[26:25.340 --> 26:31.740]  going in and they I think they have less problems with those in terms of integrating how you
[26:31.740 --> 26:33.740]  use it because they're more comfortable with it.
[26:34.300 --> 26:39.260]  The newer facilities that I get to tour, they're, you know, state of the art that word gets
[26:39.260 --> 26:41.500]  thrown around. But I mean, these things are impressive.
[26:41.500 --> 26:46.060]  It's just that they're way too sophisticated for an average operator to understand.
[26:46.460 --> 26:51.660]  And when they laid it out, they didn't lay out the understanding that it's not normal
[26:51.660 --> 26:54.460]  agriculture. So you can't use chemical spray models.
[26:55.340 --> 27:00.940]  So if I chemically treat, I can I can control most all pathogen problems.
[27:00.940 --> 27:05.980]  But cannabis is so regulated that it creates this situation where you have to be hyper
[27:05.980 --> 27:10.140]  clean to the degree that like when I show up at jobs and I'm like, you know, like, are
[27:10.140 --> 27:10.940]  you going to dress me?
[27:10.940 --> 27:12.460]  And they go, no, no, we know who you are.
[27:12.460 --> 27:14.220]  And I'm like, I'm a fucking vector.
[27:14.780 --> 27:16.140]  It doesn't matter who I am.
[27:16.780 --> 27:18.700]  Like, where's my contamination shit?
[27:19.660 --> 27:23.660]  And I think that people are not aware of the fact that, you know, like the aphid right
[27:23.660 --> 27:25.260]  now, that's our special guest of the day.
[27:26.380 --> 27:29.340]  The multiplication rate of that thing is unbelievable.
[27:29.980 --> 27:34.380]  And in the aphid family, even though we're working with a different type of aphid, root
[27:34.380 --> 27:37.740]  aphids changed French wine forever.
[27:37.740 --> 27:39.020]  It wiped out an industry.
[27:39.100 --> 27:43.980]  They had to go to American root stock, which they didn't want to do because they had to
[27:43.980 --> 27:47.660]  admit that the pathogen came from America like 1870.
[27:48.220 --> 27:51.660]  So it comes over, smashes the whole French industry.
[27:51.660 --> 27:55.980]  They have to go to American root stock because they had resistant varieties.
[27:55.980 --> 28:00.540]  It changed an entire industry because no one could deal with the problem.
[28:00.540 --> 28:06.460]  And it still is that issue where you still can't use specific grapes in specific regions
[28:06.460 --> 28:11.740]  because the moisture level in the soil just allows them to flourish and the plants are
[28:11.740 --> 28:12.860]  non-resistant.
[28:12.860 --> 28:19.820]  So we bring in this aphid issue and it is deadly in an operation if you're not having
[28:19.820 --> 28:21.420]  a containment that's incredible.
[28:22.060 --> 28:27.420]  And I don't think anybody really designed the operations to have that level of sterility.
[28:27.420 --> 28:33.020]  I think one of the cleanest ops I know is the is it's an indoor, but it's a Wonder
[28:33.100 --> 28:38.140]  Brex op down in Long Beach where you have to go through basically blow tubes to go in.
[28:38.140 --> 28:43.340]  So it's almost like you're going into a virology lab, but that's the only way you're going
[28:43.340 --> 28:44.380]  to be able to run it.
[28:44.380 --> 28:49.900]  And I think that that's the change is that on these massive mega operations, we have
[28:49.900 --> 28:55.100]  to have to rethink the whole workflow containment, who goes where, who's allowed to be where
[28:55.900 --> 28:59.660]  and how you absolutely keep yourself protected.
[28:59.660 --> 29:03.580]  Because once you get an infestation and canopy that dense, there's nothing you can do.
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.940]  You can't bring in any kind of predation that's going to outcompete the reproduction rate
[29:08.940 --> 29:11.900]  of any of these predatory problems for us.
[29:13.900 --> 29:17.660]  So actually, and I think they drink some of the shit that we're allowed to use.
[29:17.660 --> 29:23.340]  Like, I mean, these fucking aphids like thrive on some of the shit we use to try to get rid
[29:23.340 --> 29:24.220]  of them.
[29:24.220 --> 29:28.860]  I mean, I don't know what it is, but I don't want to name any names of some of these products,
[29:28.860 --> 29:32.380]  but there's only a few of them you can use in the late flower.
[29:32.380 --> 29:37.340]  And I mean, it's at the point where I think the aphids, like I said, just drink that shit.
[29:37.340 --> 29:43.020]  Some of them die, but they multiply so fucking fast that it just, it blows the doors off.
[29:43.980 --> 29:45.900]  Anything it starts at the nursery.
[29:45.900 --> 29:46.540]  And that's the thing.
[29:47.900 --> 29:48.460]  Exactly.
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.740]  I was just going to say that.
[29:49.740 --> 29:52.780]  You start at the fucking nursery, you move it downstream.
[29:52.780 --> 29:53.580]  You screw.
[29:53.580 --> 29:54.080]  Yeah.
[29:55.040 --> 29:55.540]  Yeah.
[29:56.160 --> 30:01.040]  Actually, I mean, quickly that gets to, so you sent me a picture.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.960]  There's a special guest, but yeah.
[30:06.960 --> 30:10.240]  Do you want to talk about kind of just in case you brought him?
[30:15.920 --> 30:20.800]  So just quickly, do you want to talk about some of the stuff you've seen and operations
[30:20.800 --> 30:25.040]  you've consulted on and kind of some standard operating procedures and best practices for
[30:25.040 --> 30:30.000]  bringing things in from the outside, which typically is, you know, clones and cuttings?
[30:31.920 --> 30:34.640]  Yeah. I mean, you know, there has to be a quarantine
[30:35.360 --> 30:38.800]  a portion of the facility when you're bringing stuff in for intake,
[30:38.800 --> 30:41.360]  and then you got to be able to look stuff over pretty good.
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.520]  And, and whether you're using, you know, I just posted a little story of a little
[30:47.520 --> 30:54.240]  microscope thing that isn't a fancy microscope like Scott use, but it cooks up to your computer,
[30:54.240 --> 30:59.680]  or you can use like a jewelers type of a microscope, handheld deal that you go around.
[30:59.680 --> 31:04.320]  And a lot of the PCAs and regular ag use these things and you just look at the leaves.
[31:04.320 --> 31:09.040]  And so, you know, there's just a lot of looking at these clones when you're bringing them in,
[31:09.040 --> 31:13.040]  because, you know, every nursery has a little something.
[31:13.040 --> 31:14.160]  It's just at scale.
[31:14.160 --> 31:16.560]  There's just no getting around some of that stuff.
[31:16.640 --> 31:21.760]  And so no matter how hard they try, you have to try just as hard and not, you know,
[31:22.800 --> 31:25.680]  kind of waver on thinking that things are clean when they're not.
[31:26.720 --> 31:30.480]  Because you can look at 30 different leaves all around all these trays,
[31:30.480 --> 31:33.440]  and it takes, you know, one leaf to finally find something.
[31:33.440 --> 31:35.200]  And most people give up on five.
[31:36.480 --> 31:41.360]  And so, you know, it's a tremendous amount of looking at things, paying attention to that stuff.
[31:41.360 --> 31:47.200]  And it's not necessarily my, you know, my original deal, but I've just been seeing a lot
[31:47.200 --> 31:47.760]  of it lately.
[31:47.760 --> 31:52.560]  And so communicating with a lot of the farms and people that I work with, even up in Humboldt,
[31:52.560 --> 31:54.640]  it's not just in, you know, a valley type of thing.
[31:54.640 --> 31:56.720]  It happens to be all over.
[31:56.720 --> 32:02.480]  Like I'm talking, and if you talk to people, you know, at least when I talk to them one on one,
[32:02.480 --> 32:05.920]  you know, people are say straight up, yeah, I'm fucking having problems.
[32:05.920 --> 32:10.640]  This situation this year, some people blame it on the big rains we had two years ago that
[32:10.640 --> 32:14.480]  all of a sudden, you know, brought in all the aphids after the drought, you know, there's all
[32:14.480 --> 32:16.560]  these folklore going around or whatever.
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.080]  But nevertheless, they're here and they multiply fast.
[32:20.080 --> 32:25.200]  And it doesn't matter where you are in cannabis, this state, that state, up north, down south,
[32:25.200 --> 32:25.760]  or whatever.
[32:25.760 --> 32:28.000]  It's a problem for a lot of people.
[32:28.000 --> 32:34.000]  And it comes back also to the viroid, you know, it's, you know, the viroid for the plants,
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.560]  whatever you want to call it, the dudding is a huge problem too.
[32:38.560 --> 32:40.800]  And I think that's a big vector for bugs.
[32:40.800 --> 32:42.160]  It's a generational thing.
[32:42.160 --> 32:43.920]  It's been transferred around.
[32:43.920 --> 32:48.640]  And a lot of the people that found this viroid don't want to say or say bugs don't transmit
[32:48.640 --> 32:49.760]  this shit.
[32:49.760 --> 32:54.320]  But there's a few people that I really believe in online and stuff that I follow, and they're
[32:54.320 --> 32:55.280]  deep into bugs.
[32:55.280 --> 32:56.880]  And they say that it does.
[32:56.880 --> 33:00.800]  And I kind of agree with them because it's another vector.
[33:00.800 --> 33:04.720]  The thing that people have to realize with quarantine too, right, is you're not just
[33:04.720 --> 33:06.240]  quarantining shit you can see.
[33:06.960 --> 33:09.280]  So that I like, I'll give a plug to the company.
[33:09.280 --> 33:09.840]  I like that.
[33:09.840 --> 33:14.480]  I mean, I wish they gave me the microscope, but I love my little dynalite because it plugs
[33:14.480 --> 33:17.520]  into my pad and it gives me a big screen to look at.
[33:17.520 --> 33:20.320]  And it's really efficient, but that doesn't let me look at viral issues.
[33:20.320 --> 33:26.240]  And so the problem that people would bring new plants in is it's not just pathogens that
[33:26.240 --> 33:28.480]  are going to multiply in that form, but it's in viroid.
[33:29.360 --> 33:35.280]  And once you bring that plant into the facility, anything you cut a touch and transfer sap,
[33:35.920 --> 33:37.360]  you can transfer that.
[33:37.360 --> 33:39.680]  And now you start to move it into your populations.
[33:40.560 --> 33:47.120]  And by the time you realize what you've done, you've reduced your overall TURP levels, potency
[33:47.120 --> 33:50.720]  levels, resistance, anything that has to do with sugar transport.
[33:51.440 --> 33:55.440]  And so I think that what people don't do is they get new plants and they need to send
[33:55.440 --> 33:57.520]  out tissue sample of those plants to a lab.
[33:57.520 --> 34:01.120]  It's about 150 bucks and you can get a virus analysis.
[34:01.840 --> 34:06.800]  And then you do your diligence on searching the plant for things that you can visibly
[34:06.800 --> 34:07.040]  see.
[34:07.840 --> 34:11.040]  And then you let the lab search it for things that you can't see.
[34:11.040 --> 34:13.760]  And now you know you have a plant that's pretty decent.
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.560]  And if it's priceless, then you send it off to a lab and get it meristem cultured, let
[34:18.560 --> 34:20.960]  them scrub it, let them return it to you clean.
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.520]  If it doesn't have any virus issues, it doesn't need to be meristem scrubbed.
[34:25.520 --> 34:27.120]  So you can save yourself the five grand.
[34:27.920 --> 34:29.280]  But you got to make that decision.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.280]  I ask people all the time when I go to these jobs, I said, who picked the library?
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.440]  Why are you growing these plants?
[34:35.440 --> 34:37.600]  And they go, because this is what was here before.
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.560]  And I said, what's the basis of the choice?
[34:42.560 --> 34:43.840]  And no one can answer it.
[34:43.840 --> 34:45.280]  The investors can't answer it.
[34:45.280 --> 34:46.560]  The growers can't answer it.
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.600]  And so you look at these things and you're just like, wait a second, there has to be
[34:51.600 --> 34:58.720]  a really clear idea of what you're trying to do with your production destination, where
[34:58.720 --> 35:00.800]  the products are going to go, what you're going to use.
[35:01.360 --> 35:05.440]  And instead of trying to make these phenomenal collections of 8000 different types of
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.560]  varieties, you get core varieties you can work with that, you know, that you can understand
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.000]  that there are problems that they have inherently with resistance.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.760]  And then you can simplify it and then you can expand what you work with.
[35:17.760 --> 35:20.400]  But people take on so much complexity.
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.200]  They don't look at the problem clearly enough.
[35:23.200 --> 35:27.920]  And then when it moves out of that quarantine into the nursery, then it spreads into all
[35:27.920 --> 35:28.720]  the bays.
[35:28.720 --> 35:30.960]  So it's not even isolated in one bay.
[35:30.960 --> 35:32.480]  It's in all the bays.
[35:32.480 --> 35:34.080]  And now there's nothing you can do.
[35:34.880 --> 35:39.600]  It's just nonstop trying to sterilize the space, bring new material in.
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.280]  But I'm telling you, these things can hide in a fucking molecule.
[35:43.280 --> 35:46.800]  And when they pop out, they pop out with like 8000 children.
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.760]  Brusset mites were considered deadly, but the aphid makes all of these things look
[35:51.760 --> 35:53.040]  really, really simple.
[35:55.600 --> 35:56.800]  It's true, man.
[35:57.040 --> 36:01.840]  And the virus, the protocols now with some of this stuff are insane.
[36:01.840 --> 36:05.600]  And that's something that people can also, you know, a lot of times these nurseries are
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.600]  kind of transparent on how they do things.
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.200]  And so you might be able to pick up nowadays on how well they're doing on containing their
[36:13.200 --> 36:16.000]  virus, because this shit is no joke.
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.640]  And so there's nurseries I know and things, their protocols are insane.
[36:20.640 --> 36:23.280]  And I mean, each mom has its own set of scissors.
[36:23.280 --> 36:25.040]  They don't transfer scissors for it.
[36:25.760 --> 36:26.880]  Yeah, it doesn't move.
[36:26.880 --> 36:28.320]  You don't take it with you anywhere.
[36:28.320 --> 36:34.880]  It stays in a cup of bleach right there near that plant or that specific area of the plant.
[36:34.880 --> 36:37.040]  So each plant has its own scissors.
[36:37.680 --> 36:41.840]  The de-leafing when you're moving around and de-leafing because you're making wounds there.
[36:41.840 --> 36:43.280]  I mean, it's just kind of crazy.
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.520]  I mean, it's kind of coincidental that we're dealing with the, you know, I know the dudding
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.760]  has been around for a while, but now with this coronavirus and the HPL virus or whatever,
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.360]  everybody's getting real fucking, you know, sanitary.
[36:58.320 --> 37:00.240]  Talking about drinking Clorox and shit.
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.720]  The thing is that if you're running these nursery operations and you get this infestation
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.160]  and you release it into any of these operations, the lawsuits are going to bury you alive.
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.000]  And the thing that I noticed is that, you know, every investment group has some attorneys on
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.040]  the team.
[37:21.040 --> 37:25.040]  So lawsuits aren't hard to file when your business partner is a lawyer.
[37:25.920 --> 37:31.520]  And it really starts to create issues where the nurseries, and even if it's in-house nursery,
[37:31.520 --> 37:34.400]  if it's your in-house nursery, you have to treat it like you're going to get sued
[37:35.120 --> 37:37.280]  because you're going to end up killing your own business.
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.240]  But for, you know, offshoot nurseries that provide to the public,
[37:40.960 --> 37:46.000]  the diligence they have to put together to make sure they're protected because there'll be no
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.560]  forgiveness for the mistake because the margins are so small that you can't make it up.
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.880]  Years past, we could make mistakes because we were all in the learning curve.
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.080]  And we all had a different level of ability to what we could do because lack of legalization
[38:00.080 --> 38:04.400]  changed our ability to actually put together stable infrastructure.
[38:04.400 --> 38:09.440]  But now that all that's in play, man, it puts you in a hell of vulnerable situation.
[38:09.440 --> 38:14.720]  And I think that's where the rise of the labs are coming in, where the technology to get around
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.520]  these issues with orchid, to get around it with banana, to get around it with strawberry,
[38:19.520 --> 38:22.640]  they had to go that route because they couldn't control it any other way.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.400]  They're going to transfer it in our direction.
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.720]  And I just think that that's important for nursery operators to understand that
[38:29.280 --> 38:35.520]  the technology that's coming out to deal with these issues is expensive and it's not simple to
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.080]  do. And you have to make sure you're clear that that's going to be the future that's coming.
[38:40.080 --> 38:44.640]  So if you make the decision to be a nursery operator, you develop partnerships with these
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.720]  groups or you become your own laboratory based system.
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.240]  But I think a lot of the conventional agricultural practices we had
[38:52.880 --> 38:56.320]  and how we function prior are going to change dramatically, just like socially with the
[38:56.320 --> 38:59.760]  coronavirus. I mean, this shit just changed the world in a day.
[39:03.360 --> 39:13.280]  So just quickly, Scott, we have a bunch of living soil, JADAM, K&F enthusiasts watching right now.
[39:13.360 --> 39:19.680]  And I know you run a lot of, you do a lot of experimentation.
[39:19.680 --> 39:23.760]  And so can you talk about maybe, like, I love that you, I don't know if you still have your
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.800]  home grow, but like, it seems like you were always experimenting there to, you know, prove
[39:28.800 --> 39:34.000]  or disprove things. So can you talk about some things that you've been experimenting and what
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.840]  you've learned, whether it's related to pests or plant growth, but generally the kind of ecosystem
[39:41.840 --> 39:45.600]  of microbes, plant roots and plants and soil and all that stuff?
[39:48.800 --> 39:51.600]  Yeah, I guess, deep, I guess, I guess to clarify.
[39:52.560 --> 39:58.560]  Yeah, my wife, Sarah and I, we use our personal home grow to really just go bananas on.
[39:58.560 --> 40:02.320]  And that's one of the reasons why I rarely show it is because I don't think the mindset of the
[40:02.320 --> 40:07.120]  average viewer from the internet can really wrap their head around what we're doing.
[40:07.120 --> 40:10.800]  They just see that there's mold in my garden and they say, I don't know shit, but they don't
[40:10.800 --> 40:16.000]  understand that we're purposely putting in there so that we can get repetitions on how to defeat
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.680]  it so that I can confidently go into a facility and fix things. And so, yeah, so the last run
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.200]  that we did, we were, you know, I purposely let them get moldy so we could clear it out.
[40:25.200 --> 40:31.760]  The run before that, I took in some spider mite infested clones and duped it out with those. And
[40:31.760 --> 40:39.600]  then, and so that's what we do because, you know, my job is fixing problems and I come from a sports
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.040]  background. So if you're going to be asked to hit home runs in the world series, you better do some
[40:43.040 --> 40:50.000]  batting practice. So the stuff that we've seen has pretty much completely removed any fear of a
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.360]  problem from us, just because we've seen such horrific problems and navigated people out of
[40:55.360 --> 41:01.280]  them using living soil techniques. To kind of tie in what Kevin was saying earlier is we come into
[41:01.280 --> 41:07.120]  these facilities that have a dysfunctional attachment to genetics. And there's a lot of
[41:07.120 --> 41:13.200]  times we come in with a new cultivator to renovate a property and the property owners insist that
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.800]  they maintain genetics. So we've had a lot of experience taking clones that were contaminated
[41:18.800 --> 41:24.720]  with things like mycobutanol and AVID and all the things that you're not at all supposed to use, but
[41:24.720 --> 41:29.760]  during the times of problem they did use. And so what we've kind of found over the last handful
[41:29.760 --> 41:36.080]  of years is that if you have a good soil that has adequate mineral density and mineral balance,
[41:36.160 --> 41:51.150]  and you have high... Sorry, Scott, you cut out without... Sorry, can you take it back to when you have good soil?
[41:52.670 --> 42:00.590]  Mineral density. So yeah, so what we found is if you have good mineral density in your soil and you
[42:00.590 --> 42:06.350]  have high populations of good soil food web organisms, all the things that tissue culture
[42:06.350 --> 42:15.070]  claims, nature also has a strategy for. And so if you have really high biological populations,
[42:15.870 --> 42:21.870]  if there is a virus in the plant, the plant has the ability to kind of quarantine it to a branch
[42:21.870 --> 42:28.270]  and it'll form like this really weird callus, almost like it has a scar tissue.
[42:29.070 --> 42:37.970]  Scott, we lost you again after scar tissue.
[42:39.650 --> 42:46.370]  Scott, can you pick it up with scar tissue again? Yeah, sorry.
[42:50.040 --> 42:57.880]  If you can hear me, Scott, we cannot hear you. So we'll wait for you to come back.
[42:58.440 --> 43:05.400]  What he's saying though... Sorry, sorry. So Scott, bring it back to the scar tissue again.
[43:06.840 --> 43:10.840]  Sorry about that. We're out here in the mountains and it's a little dodgy. Sorry, we gotta
[43:12.440 --> 43:21.080]  repoint the satellite dish. So what I'm trying to say is that, you know, a lot of the
[43:21.080 --> 43:27.960]  things that tissue culture claims that is the benefit, good living soil biology and good
[43:27.960 --> 43:33.320]  mineral density can also provide those same benefits. There was one particular farm that
[43:34.120 --> 43:39.960]  had plants that were, you know, coated in systemic fungicides. They were treated with Avid, things
[43:39.960 --> 43:46.760]  like that. And we actually put them into a good living soil system, veged them out. We hacked out
[43:46.920 --> 43:53.000]  the, that first biomass that came out and threw it away. That next round of biomass that came out,
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.800]  we cloned, ran through propagation and into the flowering and all that flower tested clean. So
[43:59.800 --> 44:06.200]  in about a, you know, six week period, we were able to clean some plants up, get them ready for
[44:06.200 --> 44:10.200]  production. And the flower tested clean, which actually kind of blew the mind of the lab.
[44:11.320 --> 44:15.080]  All the labs said that there was no way that was going to work. We didn't know, we were just
[44:15.080 --> 44:21.560]  tinkering. And so I think there's a lot of untapped potential out there that people have no
[44:21.560 --> 44:28.520]  real idea exist because, you know, the people that did that study, they definitely don't tell
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.120]  anybody about it. And that was back in, I was in like mid 2017 when we did that. And, you know,
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.440]  that farm is definitely not that information. Cause that's a tremendous advantage in the market.
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.040]  If you can clean up problems in a few weeks, you're not going to share that with your neighbor,
[44:42.840 --> 44:49.000]  you know, but, um, we, we did that with, with, with, with, with the years ago,
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  with before, before the dark art said that they found the virus, Rick Crumb was a virologist.
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.400]  I don't know if you know, Rick, but crumb and a couple of guys from, uh, I would say UCLA
[44:59.400 --> 45:05.640]  brought us plants and Alan Atkinson. And I had a conversation about using, uh, biologically
[45:05.640 --> 45:11.000]  driven methodologies to increase natural resistance and would it work against the virus?
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.680]  And so next thing I know, I guess some virus plants with me and I was able to do the tests
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.080]  and we were able to get the plant back to functionality to where it had no change because
[45:21.080 --> 45:26.600]  we had already had labs on it prior. So I knew what it did when it was clean. And then we saw
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.400]  what it did when it was affected. And then we saw what it did after the cleansing, but it didn't
[45:31.400 --> 45:37.240]  remove the virus. It just brought it to a level that was workable. So we kind of, we, we used an
[45:37.240 --> 45:42.440]  analogy of, it was kind of like the way magic Johnson was able to get HIV to a level that it
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.960]  was almost non-detectable and non-invasive in his life. It doesn't change the fact that he still
[45:47.960 --> 45:54.760]  holds it in his body. And so TC doesn't change the fact that good biologically driven methods
[45:54.760 --> 46:00.600]  of production are to me are the best way to get a plant's resistance high. And I think that it
[46:00.600 --> 46:09.000]  helps shed and scrub issues, but TC is, is by far the only, you're not going to get that virus
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.040]  problem, any virus out of the plant completely. You'll just get it to a workable level. And what
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.680]  we found was when we took those plants and then put them into any other environment, other than
[46:18.680 --> 46:24.120]  that biologically driven one back into like a chemical situation, the biofactors that allowed
[46:24.120 --> 46:28.520]  that to function weren't present. And we don't know which ones they were because the, you know,
[46:28.520 --> 46:34.760]  it's too complex. It's a combination, not a single thing. And the stress would then, if the
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.280]  plant got overheated, if it had too much salinity, you would see it start to exhibit these viral
[46:40.280 --> 46:45.080]  traits. And I didn't get a chance to do the, any work with them after that point, but I would love
[46:45.080 --> 46:50.760]  to have seen the change in a viroid issue within the plant, meaning how much obstruction was in
[46:50.760 --> 46:57.800]  the vascular bundles relative to what was there prior. So I'm someone who is like, my farm is
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.040]  biologically driven and I don't seem to have any issues up top and I'm grateful for that,
[47:02.040 --> 47:07.400]  but I do a lot of containment where I don't let anybody go up the hill. I don't have any neighbors
[47:07.400 --> 47:13.000]  and I make sure that my mineral density is as high as I can drive it so that the plant has as much
[47:13.000 --> 47:21.000]  natural response as possible. But I still think that, you know, science in preservation of things
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.600]  that are damaged and to protect the nursery operations, the tool to hold and clean,
[47:27.720 --> 47:29.480]  I don't see us ever going away from it.
[47:31.880 --> 47:37.080]  Yeah. And I definitely advocate tissue culture. I wasn't necessarily saying it's definitely a
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.880]  tool that needs to be implemented and can provide great benefit. I was just necessarily saying that
[47:41.880 --> 47:46.280]  like nature has a lot of strategies for these things. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.080]  And I fully agree because you and I've had this conversation many times about
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.240]  once the bottom end is right, the plant seems to work out the problem pretty well.
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.680]  Once we have the correct nutrient balance, the plant isn't exhibiting stress symptoms that bring
[48:02.680 --> 48:09.320]  insects on. Once our epidural layers are adequately built, we don't seem to have probing insects
[48:09.320 --> 48:15.160]  penetrating and causing the problems. But the thing is that I know that it's a secret you
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.680]  want to keep for the for yourself because it's a market advantage. But the situation is that
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.920]  you're you're I mean, that's why I try to give information out all the time. It's that
[48:25.720 --> 48:31.720]  we're in the beginning of building an industry and that if if more of us survive, the better.
[48:32.600 --> 48:38.840]  And what that'll do is it allow a much better unity as an industry. You have the ability to
[48:38.840 --> 48:44.760]  have success. Success builds finances. Finances build lobby. Lobby builds influence. And that's
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.000]  what we don't have. We don't have any of these things. And so a lot of this information, that's
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.160]  why, you know, these type of little symposium we're on today is killer because it's all unfiltered
[48:55.160 --> 48:59.640]  shit. But you get it in a real opinion. And I think they know that that's the part that has to
[48:59.640 --> 49:05.240]  get shared is that the big picture has to be shown and then the details that has to be worked out
[49:05.240 --> 49:16.770]  individually. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. If we can only yeah. If only everybody would get together.
[49:17.650 --> 49:23.250]  Get along. No, no. But it's it's it's it's a process. We're getting along right now, you know,
[49:23.250 --> 49:28.930]  so we we've all all of us have had common interest on projects that we wanted to see succeed and
[49:28.930 --> 49:33.970]  we try to do the best we can. And I think that's what the the public has to see.
[49:33.970 --> 49:39.650]  Meaning the grower public is that so much of this stuff is complicated. And a lot of times
[49:39.650 --> 49:44.210]  the only way you're going to succeed is if you share the information. The larger corporations,
[49:44.210 --> 49:48.610]  they all believe they have proprietary IP. Each one lets me know, you know, we have all this
[49:48.610 --> 49:59.650]  top secret shit. And I'm like, it's a fucking injector. It's not that. Yeah. Yeah. No hybrid
[49:59.650 --> 50:05.330]  state of the art. All these, you know, we're about to show the world, you know, it's crazy.
[50:06.130 --> 50:11.970]  Yeah. I'm like, you ain't going to show anybody shit. I see a paint sprayer in there.
[50:15.090 --> 50:22.690]  I see. Eric, can you because we touched on that, the paint sprayer. And I know, Scott,
[50:22.690 --> 50:29.170]  down in Carpinteria, before everything happened, we were researching kind of atomizers and things
[50:29.170 --> 50:36.130]  like that. So can you talk about kind of what you're seeing for people spraying in greenhouses?
[50:37.010 --> 50:41.970]  Yeah, I mean, most people are, you know, using a paint sprayer for the most part. The cannabis
[50:41.970 --> 50:46.130]  community loves paint sprayers, and maybe they weren't good for minerals. That would be something
[50:46.130 --> 50:51.250]  Scott could, you know, talk about. But as far as a lot of these oils and the sulfurs and things
[50:51.250 --> 50:56.530]  that people are using need a great amount of agitation in order to be thoroughly applied
[50:56.530 --> 51:01.810]  properly and not leave residue and residues create phyto toxicity. And technically, you're
[51:01.810 --> 51:07.330]  supposed to be spraying early, early in the morning before the sun comes up, not in the evening time
[51:07.330 --> 51:13.810]  to let that stuff necessarily soak in. And so what ends up happening with paint sprayers is that
[51:13.810 --> 51:18.530]  they don't agitate a lot of these products that are allowed in cannabis, because there's not a lot
[51:18.530 --> 51:23.250]  of them used. And a lot of them do need a great amount of agitation. And if they separate, that's
[51:23.250 --> 51:28.130]  what causes those residues, leaves the phyto and then isn't effective for whatever you're trying to
[51:28.130 --> 51:36.770]  treat. And we run into that a lot. And so I mean, having agricultural spray tanks of any kind,
[51:36.770 --> 51:41.410]  they can be small, they can be large, but they have to have an agitation system on the inside
[51:41.410 --> 51:46.450]  in order to make all this stuff really work, how it's designed to work. And then Scott's
[51:46.450 --> 51:51.730]  researched more into droplet size. I mean, he kind of gets crazy on it, but you know, that's my
[51:51.730 --> 51:57.330]  point. Well, because what my kind of experience, like the first time I was introduced to a paint
[51:57.330 --> 52:02.850]  sprayer was in 2016, which was really one of my first big commercial projects. And at that time,
[52:02.850 --> 52:09.650]  I was like, this is amazing, you know, and it seemed to really solve a lot of problems. I like
[52:09.650 --> 52:14.930]  that it was really lightweight. Personally, I think those like over the shoulder atomizers is
[52:14.930 --> 52:19.970]  by far the worst piece of equipment that ever was designed. It leaks all over employees and nobody
[52:19.970 --> 52:24.930]  wants to use it. And if an employee or a cultivator doesn't enjoy using a piece of equipment, they're
[52:24.930 --> 52:30.850]  not going to use it. And so we went to farm after farm after farm, seeing the same systemic issues.
[52:30.850 --> 52:35.410]  They had those little atomizers with the jug that leaks all over employees. Nobody likes that.
[52:35.410 --> 52:40.050]  They can't articulate them into the plants. So they just kind of walk through the building and
[52:40.050 --> 52:45.490]  just kind of blow in the air and kind of pretend to do their job. And then, or then you end up with
[52:45.490 --> 52:50.530]  a paint sprayer. So the benefits of a paint sprayer is it has, you know, a lightweight hose
[52:50.530 --> 52:55.330]  with a lightweight nozzle that's easy to articulate. It has a high air pressure, so it'll
[52:55.330 --> 53:01.090]  move the plants. So that's really nice. You can, you can articulate the plant into the correct
[53:01.090 --> 53:09.090]  position with the spray gun itself. The real hindrance of the paint sprayer is the context.
[53:09.090 --> 53:15.330]  A paint sprayer is designed to typically spray water-based or oil-based paints. So they have
[53:15.330 --> 53:20.610]  different homogenization requirements. They're also spraying a product onto a vertical surface.
[53:20.610 --> 53:26.930]  And so gravity is homogenizing the product for you. None of those apply to a plant. And then the
[53:26.930 --> 53:33.810]  other issue is that the nozzle is not designed for the type of atomization that pesticides need,
[53:33.810 --> 53:39.410]  because again, it's spraying paint. It's not trying to kill pests with pesticides. And so then the
[53:39.410 --> 53:45.970]  other concern is droplet size. So if you're a conventional farmer and you have a pest issue,
[53:46.530 --> 53:51.730]  you typically contact your Ag Extension office. The Ag Extension sends a representative out.
[53:51.730 --> 53:56.530]  They correctly identify the pest. They recommend a pesticide for you to use.
[53:57.570 --> 54:02.290]  There comes along specifications for droplet size that are necessary for that particular
[54:02.290 --> 54:09.010]  compound to kill that particular pest. And they give you these little cards that have water-sensitive
[54:09.010 --> 54:14.290]  like ink on it or something so that you spray it. And it's almost like a little grid that shows you
[54:14.290 --> 54:19.490]  that, yeah, I am hitting the correct spray. So what people need to really wrap their mind around is
[54:20.530 --> 54:27.010]  if you're trying to kill a russet mite, just for whatever, we'll just say a russet mite is 100
[54:27.010 --> 54:33.890]  microns across or something. And if you're shooting a droplet size that's five times the size of that
[54:34.610 --> 54:42.290]  insect, well, you also have gaps that are the same size as the droplet. So you have two issues.
[54:42.290 --> 54:47.970]  You're hitting a pest with a water droplet that has no pesticide. You're hitting a plant with only
[54:47.970 --> 54:53.970]  pesticide. And then you're missing the insect altogether. And so I went to farm after farm
[54:53.970 --> 55:00.370]  after farm all through 2016, 2017, 2018. People are using pest sprayers. They can't get on top of
[55:00.370 --> 55:07.250]  pests. And then I can't remember what year it was, but in the first, I think really the first
[55:07.250 --> 55:13.810]  regenerative conference up there in Portland, Susan Wainwright, the bug lady was there and she
[55:13.810 --> 55:19.170]  talked about this phenomenon. I think that was the first time I really had it explained in that way,
[55:19.170 --> 55:24.530]  where I really had an aha movement. I think why it hasn't settled on the cannabis industry is
[55:24.530 --> 55:28.450]  because Susan usually talks to you like a scolding teacher. And I don't think people,
[55:29.250 --> 55:34.610]  you know, follow sometimes because her tone's a little disrespectful. But what she's trying to say
[55:34.610 --> 55:40.050]  is helpful in that you need to have a proper nozzle that atomizes properly, that has small
[55:40.050 --> 55:46.530]  enough droplets so that you're actually hitting the pest with a homogenized solution that will
[55:46.530 --> 55:52.690]  actually kill the targeted pests. And so, yeah, paint sprayers are great for spraying nutrients.
[55:53.490 --> 55:58.770]  You'll, you know, you'll never get on top of pests. And Eric was consulting on a project just recently
[55:58.770 --> 56:02.610]  where they're spraying and spraying and spraying and spraying and spraying. And, you know, he
[56:02.610 --> 56:08.290]  suggested they use the commercial sprayers. You know, the crew has an objection for one reason or
[56:08.290 --> 56:12.370]  another for the sprayers on why they don't want to use them. But what's important is that nozzle
[56:12.370 --> 56:20.370]  is designed to homogenize and atomize pesticides for the issue of dealing with pests. And we're in
[56:20.370 --> 56:26.690]  a, we're in a real pickle right now in cannabis in that there hasn't been a lot of focus on our needs.
[56:26.690 --> 56:31.250]  So, you know, you have like the big dram sprayers, they have these giant plastic tanks. Well, those
[56:31.330 --> 56:36.610]  cause issues with microbial issues sometimes. It's not, in my opinion, the best suited for
[56:36.610 --> 56:42.850]  cannabis and we need new equipment. We need a piece of equipment that is designed for
[56:42.850 --> 56:47.570]  the regulated cannabis market that has the characteristics of an agricultural sprayer.
[56:48.370 --> 56:53.170]  And it just, it doesn't fit yet. It is not here yet. I think you're muted, Kevin.
[56:54.850 --> 56:59.330]  Am I coming through? Yeah, there you go. Yeah, there you go. The electrostatic technology is nice,
[56:59.970 --> 57:06.450]  but you see it in a little wonky small form or extremely complicated big form.
[57:07.330 --> 57:12.050]  It doesn't allow smaller, you know, the smaller operator to use some of the technology. And I
[57:12.050 --> 57:16.370]  think that's why you see so much of the paint sprayer tech is because it's readily available.
[57:17.170 --> 57:21.890]  And I agree, they're not making the products that we need for our industry because
[57:22.850 --> 57:29.250]  it's plants, but it's different in that you can't use so many of the other tools prior.
[57:29.970 --> 57:35.890]  And I think that cannabis by nature, the fact that it's epidural layer and the surface of that
[57:35.890 --> 57:45.890]  is so convoluted and unique in its composition that it allows you to have a lot of hiding places,
[57:45.890 --> 57:50.930]  tough to get up in the canopies, tough to cover and spray correctly. And when the canopy starts
[57:50.930 --> 57:56.130]  to become huge, like some of these operations, you're basically just trying to outrun it.
[57:56.130 --> 58:01.810]  You know, we got that's why you see these shorter day cycles where there's a limit on how long
[58:01.810 --> 58:06.530]  they're going to flower these rooms. And I think a lot of that that limit is based off of how long
[58:06.530 --> 58:11.730]  they can outrun the problem before it becomes so problematic. They can't get any value at a plant.
[58:11.730 --> 58:17.010]  I mean, I see a lot of big ops that don't sell flower. They only sell concentrate.
[58:17.970 --> 58:19.410]  Because problems go to production.
[58:20.050 --> 58:26.370]  Yep. They cleanse it there. And it's, I know we all laugh because it's just so fucking real.
[58:29.410 --> 58:35.330]  The cannabis plants, it's its own little world. And we've been saying that for a while,
[58:36.050 --> 58:40.850]  but it doesn't mean that you can't take tech from other industry combine and dial it in,
[58:40.850 --> 58:46.290]  but it just has to be done. And we haven't seen that yet. And the thing about agitation,
[58:46.930 --> 58:52.770]  that Eric was talking about, it's huge because I remember a lecture you gave Scott, I was at
[58:52.770 --> 58:58.450]  where you were talking about nematode distribution and how, when you check the nematodes in the beds,
[58:58.450 --> 59:03.650]  you saw them all over the place in terms of number. And you realize that it was due to the fact that
[59:03.650 --> 59:08.370]  the tanks weren't agitated when they did the application. And what you were getting was no
[59:08.370 --> 59:13.650]  nematodes in some portions and then all the nematodes and others. And it was, it just
[59:13.650 --> 59:19.170]  highlights that same situation where everything has to be mixed continuously, or you're spraying
[59:19.170 --> 59:25.010]  liquid, which does nothing, or you're spraying something that's phytotoxicity, which damages the
[59:25.010 --> 59:30.690]  plant, opens it up to other pathogenic entry. And now you have a whole nother set of problems.
[59:32.130 --> 59:37.970]  Exactly. Yeah. Whatever scale you're at, the difference between the ends is what really
[59:37.970 --> 59:43.410]  kills you. And so, you know, what, what Eric experienced at this one particular facility that
[59:43.410 --> 59:49.650]  he stopped by is that literally changing to the, to the appropriate agricultural sprayer within what,
[59:49.650 --> 59:54.530]  a couple weeks or something, there was noticeable. Yeah. I mean, within a couple weeks, so
[59:54.530 --> 01:00:01.010]  phytotoxicity went down. So that's, you know, that's, that's injury due to sunlight and being
[01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:05.490]  intensified through a chemical or compound. So you have half the building that's getting an
[01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:10.930]  excessively concentrated solution. You got half the building that's getting water. None of it's
[01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:15.490]  getting on top of the pest. And then now because of the paint sprayer handle, you're also now when
[01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:21.090]  you are spraying, you're also missing the pest altogether because the droplet size is too big.
[01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:25.650]  Too big. It's like, it's like, I guess a good example would be like shotgun shells. So like
[01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:30.850]  shotgun shells come in a single slug, they come in like a six shot and then they come in like a 40
[01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:36.690]  shot. So if you shoot that up against the wall, the single slug leaves big gap around it, you know,
[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:42.530]  and so a six shot is going to make six holes, but there's big gaps around it. And so as you go down
[01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:49.170]  in BB size, you cover more ground and you know, that's, what's really missing. So us personally,
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:55.170]  for our clients, we've been just kind of adapting spray guns from, from, you know, agricultural
[01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.530]  areas to other pieces of equipment that they like to use right now. It's a big Frankenstein time
[01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:05.650]  right now. Yeah. Scott went, we went to the world ag expo together and Scott stopped by every booth
[01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:14.050]  that had anything to do with spray nozzles things. And I mean, it was insane, but actually we learned
[01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:19.410]  a lot, you know, like if you ask him what, what works for pump and sludge, they look at you like
[01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:28.290]  you're crazy. And that's, so that's yeah. Good. No, I was just going to say, so at the, at the
[01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:33.010]  expo, like what, what, what were your learnings there? Because I know like, for example, are you
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:39.810]  still are you still a blue mat enthusiast? I love blue mats. Yeah. So for example, like you're the
[01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:44.130]  one who introduced everyone to blue mats and you were the champion, I mean, for everybody I know,
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:50.610]  nice carpentry area, but like, so, you know, and you saw them and you're like, oh my God,
[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:57.650]  these serve a specific purpose. And so what did you see, you know, your dorky nozzle research?
[01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.490]  Like what, what, what do you see? What'd you learn? What, what do you think you could apply
[01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:08.450]  to this industry? Well, I think, you know, the, the overall message is that the current context
[01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:14.610]  of agriculture is not suited really to what I'm doing. It's, it's suited to using really
[01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:19.570]  highly soluble chemicals in water. So every piece of equipment is suited to
[01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:26.050]  very water soluble, salt chemicals, nothing. And so when I would go around to the different spray
[01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:29.650]  people and what Eric was talking about, the sludge is like, okay, if I want to do something,
[01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:34.450]  that's got a little bit of texture to it, a little bit of organic, something I have to define it to
[01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:39.970]  the chemical people as sludge, you know, because most of the chemicals just become a water solution.
[01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:45.970]  They're so water soluble. It looks like water. So all the nozzles, all the screens, all the filters,
[01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:51.970]  all the pumps, all the, everything is suited to essentially spraying water. And so I would say,
[01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:55.970]  well, what if I wanted to spray a sludge to see if they had any sort of reaction? And they
[01:02:55.970 --> 01:03:01.650]  look at me like the hell, what? You know? And I'm like, well, I'm spraying organic products and it
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:05.250]  has a little bit of a texture to it. So I just use the word sludge to see what you, he's like,
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:09.970]  well, nobody wants to spray sludge. I'm like, exactly. Okay. So what's the biggest orifice
[01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:15.810]  thing you have? And they would pull out, okay, well, if we're, you know, dealing with really
[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.850]  crummy well water that has silt in it or something, this is what we would use. And
[01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:27.410]  none of that stuff is anywhere near close to what it would be desirable for spraying compost tea,
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:34.530]  for example. And, you know, Sarah and I had to come up with techniques because nothing is really
[01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:39.170]  all that suited to spraying tea at scale. So we had to figure out other techniques to avoid having
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:43.730]  to spray tea at scale. Like we had to come up with new strategies to solve the problems that
[01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:50.370]  didn't involve tea because it was too complicated. You know, and, you know, I keep kicking around,
[01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:55.970]  you know, building some spec equipment, but I don't want to do everything. I want to do my
[01:03:55.970 --> 01:04:00.130]  role. You know, I want to do analytics. I want to do math. I don't want to be an equipment supplier.
[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:04.290]  I don't want to make shit. I want to be a manufacturer. It's expensive to design that
[01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:10.690]  shit. Like I did some blow mold design on something. I had this little idea years ago,
[01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:14.050]  and I was like, if you want to burn money quick, get into R&D.
[01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:20.850]  Yeah, exactly. But we have a need though. And that's the thing. It's like right now,
[01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:25.650]  people are failing with paint sprayers or, you know, I say DRAM, they're the biggest one. There's
[01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:29.970]  things I like about it. There's a lot I don't like about their equipment. But again, you know,
[01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:35.490]  the real issue that I think we've experienced as cannabis people is, you know, we've done,
[01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:41.090]  we've used damn near everybody's product. And we've seen it. We've tried to help a farm be
[01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:45.650]  successful damn near every product. And, you know, after the project's over, I'll reach out
[01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:49.650]  to the manufacturer. I'm like, hey, you know, we were just at this farm for a week. These are the
[01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:54.130]  issues that they're having. This is what we're quantifying. This is the problems we're seeing,
[01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:59.170]  you know, and they respond like, who the hell are you? You know, it's like, well, I'm a person that
[01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:03.490]  tries to get people successful with your product. And these are the things that I regularly see.
[01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:10.290]  And so far, the only people, the only people really that have been receptive to our feedback
[01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:16.610]  has been Grassroots Fabric Pots and Sustainable Village, which is who sells the blue mats. No
[01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:22.210]  other agricultural. I think Tyler's actually watching right now. Yeah. What's up, Tyler?
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:28.050]  But Grassroots has been great. They listen to the market and they make changes and, you know,
[01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:31.890]  Sustainable Village, those are the people that sells blue mats out in Colorado. They do the same
[01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:37.330]  thing. I've had a running dialogue with Steve from Blue Mats for five, six years now, and they
[01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:42.610]  make updates based on what we're seeing in the field. And, you know, there's this resistance
[01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:46.610]  or this like culture, like was being said way at the beginning is, you know, there's this
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:53.570]  clashing of cultures and clashing of we're on this team or you're on the weed team. And so far,
[01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:59.970]  zero tea brewer manufacturers have been receptive to our feedback. Zero spray manufacturers have
[01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:06.050]  been receptive to our feedback. And, you know, at some point somebody will fill those niches. But
[01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:13.170]  can you talk about some iterative product development, blue mat based on the feedback?
[01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:17.730]  Like, what did you say? That was a great screen grab.
[01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:27.170]  Well, the yeah, there's been a lot of evolution with the blue mats. You know,
[01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:31.810]  the original systems used a lot of carrots, which is the sensor part that functions it.
[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:37.330]  And it uses a lot of the distribution drippers. The downside of those is a horrendous cost,
[01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:42.530]  because all those little bits are the most expensive. And the more carrots you put into a
[01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:48.610]  building, the more opportunities for failure you had. And we experienced that, you know,
[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:55.090]  the first real big facility we installed them in was like 65,000 square feet. And that was before
[01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:59.890]  all the blue soak hose was really kind of dialed in and working well. So I stuck to the old tried
[01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:05.490]  and true. And it was far too many carrots in a facility. And it to be honest, it didn't go well.
[01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:11.170]  You know, I would have liked to see it gone better. And unfortunately, that cultivator,
[01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:15.090]  you know, doesn't say the nicest things about the blue mat system still to this day. And
[01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:24.210]  but, you know, working with, you know, the Steve and, and James and Michael, Michael's been really
[01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:29.250]  big over there, it's sustainable village, and, you know, evolving how we install the systems.
[01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:34.210]  And I feel like right now where we're at, like, you know, the blue silk manifold system is working
[01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:39.570]  really well. And there's three or four different variations that are going out right now. You know,
[01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:45.250]  my personal is a little bit different than what they sell. But, you know, now, instead of being,
[01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:52.290]  you know, $10,000 for a 4000 square foot building, you're down to like two to 3000. So now it's kind
[01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:59.650]  of doable. But on the same thing, like, you know, over at, you know, one of the farms, both Kevin,
[01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:04.050]  I, you know, Kevin introduced this to they put it in, you know, they put it on half the building
[01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:09.090]  to prove concept. And so it was, I would say a pretty good trial, because it was the, you know,
[01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.090]  one side had it and one side didn't, they all got the same treatment and the side with the blue mats
[01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:18.930]  had 28% more flour. You know, that's pretty markable return on investment for a couple grand.
[01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:27.330]  But still, it's, you know, it's, you know, we just, it's, it's really hard to convince these
[01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:32.050]  facilities to make the decisions that will help them. Ultimately, that's, that's one of our biggest
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:38.050]  obstacles is, you know, a lot of times so many other bad things have happened that now when it's
[01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:42.770]  time to make a call that will really, really help you, it's hard to pull the trigger. Well, they've
[01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:47.810]  run the runways gone runways, that they've, they've, you know, the amount of money they've
[01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:54.930]  paid to fuck around already is, is excessive. And so by the time we get called in, the shits hit
[01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:59.890]  the fan more than once. And that's part of the problem that we run into is that, you know, we're
[01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:05.170]  not always called in at the design phase, we're not always called in, when things are, you know,
[01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:10.290]  about to kick off, there's a few of them in, you know, here and there, but they're few and far
[01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:15.490]  between. And so what ends up happening is that the shit hits the fan so many times the runway of
[01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:20.450]  money is gone. If they don't make it this next six months or whatever, it's over with. And so
[01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:26.770]  can they afford or make the changes that are necessary at this point? And do they trust us
[01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:33.490]  because they got PTSD? Right? Well, the thing too, is that, you know, you don't you don't,
[01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:38.050]  you don't want to spend any money. If I have to hear one more motherfucking, tell me they want to
[01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:47.250]  pick my mind. I want to pick your brain. They don't want to spend any money on the on the
[01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:54.690]  initial, but they will beg you to come in and pull this shit out of a trench. Yeah. And I'm just like,
[01:09:54.690 --> 01:10:02.130]  it's so much cheaper to not make the mistake. But there's an arrogance. And I, like I said,
[01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:08.370]  I kind of like it. I like that the arrogance gets beat back because it, it lets there be a more
[01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:13.250]  normality of the operators that are coming in. If everyone was so smart from the onset, there'll be
[01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:20.930]  no room for the small operator. Exactly. And that's, that's how I see myself still as a small
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:25.970]  operator. And that's where I want to be as a farmer. I never want to do large canopy for my
[01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:32.450]  own production because it's not in line with what I do. But it doesn't change the fact that I know
[01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:37.330]  that we have a need for the larger operators. It's just that there's a humility period that's
[01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:43.650]  taken place. And now you'll, you'll be able to come into these operations as they move them and
[01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:49.090]  say, Hey, look, this is a strategy. Let's work. Let's figure out, you know, how do we move forward
[01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:54.290]  correctly without putting ourselves into a fucking graveyard? And that's really when I get brought in
[01:10:54.290 --> 01:11:00.370]  a lot is like, you guys are ready to die. I don't think you're going to recover the money. And then,
[01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:04.610]  and then the, no one has any faith. I, like I said, I always look for the guy that's got the
[01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:09.410]  huge bags under his eyes and fucking retreating hairline because he's the guy with the money.
[01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:21.570]  I mean, he took it. It was bad, man. He was bad. And they just want to be told the truth by someone
[01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:25.730]  and everyone who's involved in these big operations doesn't want to lose the jobs.
[01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:30.610]  Nobody wants to miss out on the big payday when it sells, everyone thinks it's going to get sold
[01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:35.890]  for a fucking billion dollars and everyone's going to dance in the money bucket. And it's, it's a job,
[01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:43.810]  you know, it's farming and it's just so weird. It's surreal to see it in person.
[01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:48.930]  Yeah. One of the things we see is, you know, one of the things that,
[01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:53.170]  you know, I would like to see, and I honestly just, I'm being transparent. I don't know how
[01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:59.570]  we get there. Like, but, but, you know, the Instagram is really making a lot of people's
[01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:05.570]  lives harder because so much of it is not even real. Like, you know, there's a, like there's a,
[01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:12.290]  like there was a project, you know, like, ah, man, just so pause, but like this whole, this whole
[01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:16.370]  thing with dark heart, like I have some really intimate knowledge about how this started and
[01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:21.490]  what the timeline was. And I just, I don't feel comfortable speaking about it publicly. Cause I'm
[01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:26.610]  still, you know, a small fry. I'm not trying to go after nobody. And, you know, every time we speak,
[01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:30.610]  we have to think about what potential clients might be thinking and they don't want to be outed.
[01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:34.370]  And so, you know, we get all the work we get because people know I ain't going to say shit.
[01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:42.210]  And, but like, there's, we could eliminate a lot of problems if more people would be a little bit
[01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:47.250]  transparent about things that didn't work. And, you know, I can't ask people to share secrets of
[01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:53.090]  things that are working, but like, you know, I don't know how many times we go to a new startup
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:57.570]  project and they'll pull up something from the gram, you know, and they'll ask me about it.
[01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.490]  And I'd be like, I have intimate of that intimate knowledge of that project. It didn't work.
[01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:04.690]  They don't do that anymore. And they'd be like, but the picture's still up. I'm like, I'm telling
[01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:08.770]  you, they don't do that anymore. They did it once. It didn't work. They don't do it anymore.
[01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.010]  And then they respond with, well, I contacted the manufacturer and I'm getting a quote. And I'm like,
[01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:17.010]  well, that didn't work. And they're like, yeah, well, we're thinking it's going to,
[01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:19.570]  you know, increase canopy. And I'm like, that didn't work. And they're like,
[01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:23.410]  but it's going to make more widgets. And I'm like, the people that you're copying
[01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:28.930]  only did it one time. It didn't work, you know? And I don't know how we get there because nobody
[01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:33.570]  wants to admit failures and no, you know, people are so worried about their brand being damaged.
[01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:41.410]  They don't put nothing on the gram and then, but we can all move faster so much better and
[01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:46.770]  move forward in such a better, more effective economical way. If there was a little bit more
[01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:53.650]  transparency and humility and, you know, it's not my place to share these failures. You know,
[01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:59.970]  it's not my place to share failures with the world. And so a lot of times I'm really in a
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:05.890]  extremely handcuffed position, you know, sitting at a, at a, at a project management meeting or
[01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:11.490]  something. It's like, I can't even necessarily say all the details of how bad it went sometime.
[01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.610]  Cause that would be inappropriate. You know? And it's like, I don't know how we get there, but
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:20.450]  we, we got to find a way to stop perpetuating the things that never worked once, you know?
[01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.930]  Well, and that's where all the designing comes in. And these people that want to create the
[01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:28.930]  futuristic, a sprinkle of this, a sprinkle of that, a little of this, you know, I bought the
[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:35.330]  best of this. How can anything go wrong? And a lot of times, you know, I mean, you can use
[01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:39.890]  some of the events for an example, like even the Emerald cup, you know, there's some fairly
[01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:46.370]  red, you know, not very fancy greenhouses to create some of the best pot you ever seen,
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:51.330]  you know? And so in a lot of ways, you know, I always teach people in the, in the Oaksterdam
[01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:55.410]  greenhouse class, you know, when they're talking about investors and proof of concept and things
[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:59.970]  like that, get a little hoop house, you know, get a little backyard hoop house, pull some tarps.
[01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:03.490]  And I guarantee you in two months, you're going to learn a lot. Even if you blow it, you're going
[01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:07.970]  to learn a lot. But the proof of concept that people are willing to shell out and do right now
[01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:13.170]  is the whole facility. It's not, they don't even do proof of concept. They just go all in.
[01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:17.090]  Well, cause every, everybody wants those early margins and they quote Kevin Jodry about the
[01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:20.530]  early margins. You know what I mean? It's like, we got to get the early margins before the market
[01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:24.770]  dips. And it's like, you've had six straight crop loss. What margins are you grabbing? We need to,
[01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:32.530]  we need to, we need to reduce, we need to reduce down to something that, that can be executed
[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:37.170]  correctly and start there. And that's, you know, maybe a little bit of hope for the small guys out
[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:43.010]  there. Like I'm telling you, these big facilities are blowing it on a mega scale and just focus on
[01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:47.730]  executing well at whatever scale you can. And that's like, I just had a phone call yesterday,
[01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:52.290]  Eric and I, as a project we're both working on, it's like, they want to do the full extent of
[01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:57.730]  the permit, 10%. And you know, Eric and I both give the same advice. Like how about you take
[01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:02.130]  that budget and do whatever that is a hundred percent? You know, what, what do you mean?
[01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:06.450]  You're going to partially fertilize with crappy salts. Like, what are you even talking about?
[01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:11.970]  Like put some good soil in one greenhouse, let the other five wait, execute one well,
[01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:14.610]  you know, get something, you know what I mean? Like.
[01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:19.490]  These huge facilities. Yeah. You have enough room to, to try something in one,
[01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:23.730]  whether it's even a small greenhouse, if you got three beds, do something different in one.
[01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:29.250]  Don't do it to the whole project because these radical changes don't always work and they're
[01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:33.570]  costly. And sometimes when we come up with something, we got to make a radical change.
[01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:37.810]  That's going to do the job or do the trick, but then we've already, you know, the run again,
[01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:43.010]  the runway is gone. Like people are willing to blow the runway on a lot. And that's part of the
[01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:49.330]  problem. It's the excitement. It is. It's how you hook. It's how you hook the money is you show them
[01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:54.530]  you're going to get paid big, quick. Right. And the problem is that that's how they set the
[01:16:54.530 --> 01:17:00.690]  project up to begin with. Instead of saying, look, this is our seven year plan. These are the numbers
[01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:05.250]  we're going to run through a course of time. Here's our, here's our first year, which we need
[01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:11.970]  to succeed in. So let's succeed. That'll give faith and trust, faith and trust can multiply.
[01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:16.530]  Instead it's, we promise these people, we're going to blow this up. Someone tell me, he goes,
[01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:21.250]  I got my plan to play Kev. He goes, I'm going to, I have to nail four pounds of light
[01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:29.970]  to make it work. And I said, the whole facility, I said, homie, I said, you're putting yourself in
[01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:35.650]  a really tough position. And he's like, yeah, but I, I ran a plant, you gave me. And when I,
[01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:40.610]  when I extrapolated the data from that plant, it could give me that through a whole fucking
[01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:47.250]  facility. And I said, that's not quite the risk that I was trying to push you into too.
[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:54.050]  You have to be able to, to have that honesty in the beginning with the money and what it does,
[01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:58.610]  it gives you a buffer. And so whenever you're, that's what I try to give advice to people when
[01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:02.690]  they're speaking about investment or they're trying to gather someone to fund the operation
[01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:07.730]  is fucking be honest, sit down and lay out the facts. And if they accept your business plan,
[01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:13.250]  accept it. And if they don't, they don't, you're not going to get to do the med men shit and look
[01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:20.770]  at Mowglan, they're fucking going after his house. Exactly. So he's not out of the clear either. So
[01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:25.490]  he's got himself some problems because of what occurred and I don't know them. I've never met
[01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:30.290]  them. And so it's nothing personal, but it's, it's, it's something that other people copied
[01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:35.250]  and said, we're going to copy that model. And the problem is it doesn't work at all for anybody
[01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:39.810]  who's trying to do legitimate cannabis production. If you desire us to be a cannabis producer and
[01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:44.690]  you intend to do this for time, it's not some get rich quick screen because you jumped out of
[01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:49.970]  fucking pet rocks and, and mink coats, you know, you got two chillers in your basement, any of
[01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:55.170]  these little fat ass things, it's the same thing. It's, it's, it's gotta be legitimate work and it's
[01:18:55.170 --> 01:19:01.170]  gotta be legitimate progress. And you just have to be able to start at a level that you can actually
[01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:08.850]  achieve. And I see some of these operations and I'm just like, holy shit. How do you possibly
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:15.890]  light up something this big without any prior experience? Yep. And then, and then,
[01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:20.450]  yeah. And then dysfunctionally stick into the calendar when it's not working. They don't want
[01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:25.810]  to stop the conveyor belt to fix the core issues, you know, they don't want to stop and go, this
[01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:29.810]  isn't working. You know, there's always someone saying, we got to stick to timeline. We got to
[01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:35.890]  stick to timeline. And it's like, let's just pause and take a deep breath. You know, I've heard Eric
[01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:40.770]  say that a lot of time, give really practical advice. Like let's just stop the bleeding. Let's
[01:19:40.770 --> 01:19:46.930]  take a deep breath. Let's focus on what is working and let's multiply that. Like, you know, there's,
[01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:50.690]  you know, you, you just got quoted on a phone call I had yesterday about a farm that's been
[01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:55.810]  having some problems. They want to increase and is like, do you want to multiply your problems?
[01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:59.250]  Why are you doing that right now? Like, why would you expand something that's
[01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:05.010]  not being lucrative? Why? Yeah. I mean, do you want to expand problems? Like,
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:09.170]  yeah. And the critical point that you brought up a minute ago is the data that's being created. So
[01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:15.410]  if people are creating data off one plant, you know, like, you know, that data point says I got
[01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:20.530]  a plant from Kevin Jodery. Right. You know what I mean? And that particular plant I got from this
[01:20:20.610 --> 01:20:27.490]  guy at this level can scale up to this and people in the investment side need data in order to,
[01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:34.370]  you know, really be hooked. And so we got people creating data on one light, one plant, one homie
[01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:40.530]  or whatever. And it turns into this portfolio of how we can hit it and crush it. And then the poor
[01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:45.890]  person sitting there, go ahead. I got four pounds per light to perform. And well, it's just like,
[01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:52.770]  fuck, dude, that kind of backfired on you. Well, that's 800 lights. Yeah. Yeah. Like,
[01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:58.290]  come on. I can't sleep at night even thinking about it. I mean, I will say that's the one
[01:20:58.290 --> 01:21:03.490]  beauty of metric and track and trace is that there's no fooling that shit. And it's like you.
[01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:08.450]  So there's a big asterisk about, you know, we run in this a lot because you're starting to see a lot
[01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:13.170]  of salt guys getting into living soils because the returns on Rosin and extract and they're not
[01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:18.050]  motivated to do it. They just want that extra 30, 40 percent of resident. And they always want
[01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:21.810]  well, how many can you get per light? How many can you get per light? And it's like,
[01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:27.010]  what are you basing that off of? Buck down nugs that fully trimmed? Is that bag bag without shape?
[01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:31.730]  Is that bagged as per metric? Like what's that? What's that three even mean? What's that for even
[01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:36.610]  mean? Yeah. Yeah. Where is that guidepost? And what is it? You know, because I don't know,
[01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:41.570]  man, I've seen a whole lot of metric reports. I've been in some hydro facilities that claim
[01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:47.330]  three and a half, four, and then they shoot you the metric printout. And it's more like one and
[01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:51.410]  three quarter to two and an eighth type thing, you know, which ain't bad if you can consistently do
[01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:55.330]  that without failing to a light's great consistently without failing. But like,
[01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:59.490]  you know, you can't be saying I did three a light counting stems, you know?
[01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:06.690]  No. And the thing is, I'm glad that you're getting biomass, but if nobody wants to buy the product,
[01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:14.770]  smoke it, who cares? I'm like, it's the same thing with trends where, you know, every, every,
[01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:19.650]  every large operation group, I had a guy talked to, he said, you know, I have 800 unique cultivars.
[01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:23.650]  And I said, No, you won't have like 20, right, multiplied by fucking 40.
[01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:32.050]  That's really what you got. And he was like, I said, it's, it's, it's, let's just be reasonable.
[01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:38.610]  And let's admit what we have. And start to try to work on, you know, your direction, what is it
[01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:43.730]  you're trying to achieve? And if some of these giant operations with the economy of scale,
[01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:49.490]  they need to take the lower price market, they want to produce it cheap, but sell it for hot
[01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:56.130]  level prices. And it doesn't work. And the poor guys on the small end, they have to get premium
[01:22:56.130 --> 01:23:01.250]  pricing because they don't have the scale. Yeah. And so you can't you can't be small and
[01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:06.530]  capitulate. And it's tough because you're you're over a table financially. And the bigger guys just
[01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:10.850]  got to realize that there's nothing wrong with with allowing people to get you know, with your
[01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:17.250]  numbers, you can achieve, you're selling it at the store for $27, you'll make money, and your brand
[01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:24.930]  will survive. And you'll gather market share. And you didn't build an $80 million facility in this
[01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:30.530]  form to grow craft exquisite cannabis. They're not the same animal. And there's no shame in it.
[01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:35.410]  But no one wants to admit little guys want to say that they're big. I got 8000 square feet. I'm big.
[01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:39.970]  And guys that got 400,000 square feet want to say to craft. Right?
[01:23:43.090 --> 01:23:46.530]  Just admit it. It's okay. I'm fucking five, seven. I'm short.
[01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:56.850]  I'm pretty. Yeah, I've never been pretty either. It's, it's what it is. And that way you can work
[01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:04.450]  and it just works. And that's, that's where we're having to come into is that
[01:24:04.450 --> 01:24:09.650]  a lot of the stuff that you know, you're putting out is is like, you know, you and Eric, both you
[01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:13.890]  give enough information out to give people concepts and ideas to go move forward where
[01:24:13.890 --> 01:24:18.930]  they start to realize, hey, I'm using these tools, I'm not having an effect. What am I doing wrong?
[01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:24.050]  Maybe I need to research. And so the educational process happens, but it's amazing how fast it
[01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:30.370]  happens with owner operators versus investment teams. The investment team is you got to get this
[01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:35.810]  fucking meeting together, and then you got to zoom six guys. And, and there's one guy who doesn't
[01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:40.450]  want to listen. And he's the only guy that makes the fucking decision. So you got to get this dude
[01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:45.330]  to come into your world and understand that you're actually trying to fucking help them.
[01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:51.650]  And I watched this and I it's such an education. So I'm like, how the fuck did they build all these
[01:24:51.650 --> 01:24:57.490]  industries in the world if all of them were built like this? Did they basically just fuck up until
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:03.890]  they solved it? Is that how all projects are done? Maybe it's an education in reality that I never
[01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:09.410]  expected. I never thought back out of your way. So no, I mean, do you just want more room? Oops,
[01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:14.130]  sorry. I was hitting the mute, but yeah, 100% man, that's one of the things, you know, no
[01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:18.450]  disrespect to this, some of the money guys, but like, that's one of the things that I always crack
[01:25:18.450 --> 01:25:24.210]  up. Like, is if this is how you make decisions, how did you get the money to build this facility?
[01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:28.130]  Well, I think there was more universities, there was more things, there were studies,
[01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:32.370]  there was more, there was more to it. And this just came out of nowhere. Like we just pulled
[01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:35.890]  this shit out of the woods. And here you go. I mean, look at the way things are going.
[01:25:36.850 --> 01:25:43.250]  It wasn't long ago that we were worried about, you know, getting in trouble. And now it's essential
[01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:53.490]  business. Yeah, I mean, holy fuck. Yeah, that was a quick transition. I know. Jesus, that was it.
[01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:57.010]  That was a hard pill for my family to swallow. I'm working and they're not they've been judging
[01:25:57.010 --> 01:26:05.810]  for a decade. Trap kid. It's like, Oh, I'm never gonna make any. Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:14.930]  Yeah. So just quickly a random, I want to get into some of the business stuff and kind of like
[01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:18.930]  cultivate, like I think Kevin stuff you're seeing in the market trends and stuff. But
[01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:28.290]  Scott, you had a post where you were talking about extracts. Are you moving more towards
[01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:34.050]  extracts versus compost teas? And then can you talk a little bit about extracts versus teas and
[01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:41.490]  kind of for sure, your mindset? For sure. So I think really, you know, kind of the confusion
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:45.650]  that's happened is, you know, there's Dr. Laningham who's who came up with all these methods. And,
[01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:49.890]  you know, she's kind of known for saying tea, saying tea, saying tea, compost,
[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:57.330]  tea, compost, tea, compost tea. And what happens is people then go just do any version of what
[01:26:57.330 --> 01:27:06.450]  they define as tea. So there's a extreme variation between what Dr. Laningham defines as compost tea
[01:27:06.450 --> 01:27:13.490]  and what the market does across the board. I can't think of anything that's more varied in any
[01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:20.130]  thing I've ever done in my entire life. And so the two major obstacles with compost tea is
[01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:26.130]  you're doing, you're doing animal husbandry, you're growing animals, and you're growing
[01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:31.730]  life in a tank. And, and you either are or are not quantifying those organisms.
[01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:39.810]  Most of the people that possess a microscope, just kind of look through, which isn't bad,
[01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:44.770]  but there's a lot that you can't see if you're just looking through. In the early years, there
[01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:50.290]  was a lot of really bad information as far as organism identification. So I feel like an entire
[01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:56.290]  community went chasing after the wrong goal because of a couple key people. I think that's
[01:27:56.290 --> 01:28:01.010]  starting to get sorted out a little bit now that Dr. Laningham's courses are far more accessible.
[01:28:01.890 --> 01:28:10.850]  But essentially what we ran into in the workplace is, you know, really the first few jobs I got
[01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:16.610]  were to teach people how to brew tea. And what that would look like is I would go to the facility,
[01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:21.650]  we would set up a recipe, I would verify with the microscope that it was what it needed to be.
[01:28:21.650 --> 01:28:26.050]  And then we would replicate it over multiple days. So I could leave them with a compost tea recipe.
[01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:31.090]  Through that first year, it became really apparent the problems with that, because what ends up
[01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:36.530]  happening is the climate changes, the temperature changes, the conditions change for that life. And
[01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:43.170]  I don't think, you know, the market at wide really understands how varied those results of compost
[01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:48.290]  tea brewing can be. And when we start to communicate to people these obstacles, and we
[01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:55.810]  say you need to be checking, and it kind of turns into this like class warfare emotions, like people
[01:28:55.810 --> 01:29:01.810]  get offended, like I'm saying, you're not qualified to do this. But I mean, technically, that's what's
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:06.930]  happening. And if you want to brew tea, you should become proficient at identifying organisms to
[01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:11.250]  actually quantify them, because you're either brewing life or you're either brewing disease.
[01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.730]  And we went from facility to facility and facility, and we just kept tracking
[01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:23.010]  the issues with people brewing tea. Around that same time, like from like 2014 to 2016,
[01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:30.610]  I think Dr. Lane really started switching more to the extract model. And so the benefits of tea is
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:35.330]  you excite organisms and they produce glues, and they stick to surfaces. That's great if you're
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:39.650]  covering leaves. If you're trying to penetrate to roots, they never get to the roots, they stick to
[01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:47.490]  the soil surface. So Dr. Lane was seeing a benefit to adding compost extract to the soil versus
[01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:53.250]  compost tea because the compost extract, you're dislodging organisms into water, and then those
[01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:58.770]  organisms will travel as far as the water does. And so you actually get to the desired result
[01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:05.490]  quicker using a compost extract versus a compost tea. Now the downside of the compost extract is
[01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:12.610]  you use more compost. But the upside is there's almost no volatility. There's almost no detriment
[01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:17.730]  that could come with it as long as your compost doesn't have detrimental aspects to it. And so
[01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:21.970]  at the small scale, you can brew some compost tea. But as we started to get bigger and bigger and
[01:30:21.970 --> 01:30:28.210]  bigger, we ran into remarkable obstacles at scale. I don't necessarily say this publicly because then
[01:30:28.210 --> 01:30:33.490]  I get nasty emails and things from people that manufacture tea equipment. But the larger the
[01:30:33.490 --> 01:30:39.090]  tank you go, the worse it gets. The last thing that you want, in my opinion, is a 500,000 gallon
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:44.530]  tea brew. And I apologize to the people, but that's the math of it. And so there's a lot of
[01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:48.370]  obstacles to brewing tea because you're trying to do it on a timeline. Like you're trying to
[01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:54.690]  you're trying to reproduce rabbits on a perfect time scale that fits into the commercial space.
[01:30:54.690 --> 01:31:00.210]  And it doesn't work. It doesn't work. And so if you start a tea brew that has a 24-hour life cycle,
[01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:05.810]  and you come in next morning, but then you discover an irrigation leak and you get occupied
[01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:10.530]  for four hours. Well, now that tea that may have would have been healthy is now full of disease and
[01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:17.250]  problematic. And then you put that onto your plants. So there's a lot of issues with tea at scale.
[01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:23.650]  Compost extract is far lower volatility. Again, we start moving up in scale. We're not working
[01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:28.690]  with technically trained people. We're working with agricultural employees sometimes. And so
[01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:36.290]  it's far easier to explain to a non-trained employee how to do a compost extract.
[01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:40.370]  I thought the fascinating part that you guys discovered was how the difference in high
[01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:43.650]  elevation and low elevation, lack of oxygen and those kind of things.
[01:31:43.650 --> 01:31:48.210]  Total nightmare. Yeah, it's a total nightmare. And that, you know, like I said, 2015, 2016,
[01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:53.490]  that was really the first jobs we got was teaching people how to brew tea because that's really all
[01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:57.090]  they knew from Dr. Lane. They knew that we were involved with Dr. Lane. They wanted to get in.
[01:31:57.090 --> 01:32:03.970]  And so now what my wife and I do is, you know, we show up with a couple of 55 gallon drums and a
[01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:10.930]  pump and a sump pump and 130 foot hose. And I mean, you know, the wife and I can apply compost
[01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:17.650]  extract to 30,000 square feet in a workday. Yeah. We just we just and it's and it's no volatility.
[01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:23.410]  It cleans out. You can rinse out the thing because what we also started working running into is you
[01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:28.130]  run into OSHA now, if you're trying to do a regulated facility, you got an OSHA person making
[01:32:28.130 --> 01:32:34.210]  sure you conform. You cannot have an employee climb up on a ladder to get into a 250 gallon
[01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:38.930]  tank in a regulated facility. And it's just not going to fly. And so now you've got to build a
[01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:43.810]  platform and it just you're multiplying problems to do something that we don't necessarily advocate.
[01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:52.050]  And, you know, for for Sarah and I, the real like profound aha moment that will by far go down
[01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:56.690]  is one of the most profound experiences I've had in any workplaces. We were trying to brew
[01:32:56.690 --> 01:33:02.610]  tea at a facility that hired us to treat two that were about 15 miles apart. And we were racing back
[01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:09.170]  and forth to set tea brews at both facilities. And we came to the one facility, it was getting dark,
[01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:14.210]  it was outside, we were running out of time. And at that time, we were using like 200, 300 gallon
[01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:19.250]  tanks. We'd put compost tea bags in there. We'd aerate it for 20, 30 minutes, we'd swap them out.
[01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:24.130]  We do that a couple times until we hit the targeted values. And we just didn't have enough
[01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:29.730]  time to do that. And so Sarah was like, well, I'll just hand extract the amount of compost into a
[01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:33.970]  five gallon bucket, we'll pour it into the top of the tea brewer and top it off and go home and get
[01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:41.730]  dinner. And the funny part about it was she did it faster than me. And she got better extraction
[01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:47.890]  rates because the hand extraction rate was more efficient than the aerated in the 300 gallon tank.
[01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:55.250]  And that we haven't looked back since people don't want to hear it. They're not impressed by that we
[01:33:55.250 --> 01:34:01.090]  there's a lot of jobs that don't hire us because they want these wizardy tea brewers. But, you know,
[01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:05.330]  proofs in the pudding, we haven't turned back since, you know, and it's far easier for me to
[01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:10.850]  show up to a facility with two blue barrels, blessed out the extract, wash it out, turn it
[01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:16.610]  upside down and get in. And, you know, that's, you know, previously, I used to advocate like 55
[01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:20.610]  gallon brewers and we were using these stainless steel ones and we'd have our facilities get them.
[01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:26.690]  Yeah, I'm a big guy that you remember when it fell on the employee. Yeah. So that tank fell on one of
[01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:32.690]  the employees because she saw me and I, I would always try to be really careful to not fill it up
[01:34:32.690 --> 01:34:37.890]  with water and move it. But I screwed up and I needed it to go like 30 feet to the left. And I'd
[01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:43.090]  already filled it up and I was just kind of end of day tired, stressed. And so I picked I was kind of
[01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:48.850]  dragging this tank down this concrete thing to the next row. Well, the non-English speaking
[01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:53.650]  agricultural employee that had to execute that task after I left did that same thing. And she
[01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:59.570]  pulled a 55 gallon stainless steel brewer on top of her. And that was the end of that game. I was,
[01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:05.970]  I was like, that's not going down at all. And so, you know, a lot of these workplace scenarios of
[01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:10.370]  practicality, like I think that's where Eric and I really are very similar in that we always want
[01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:15.730]  to find the most practical, low cost, easy solution. And, you know, people that make and
[01:35:15.730 --> 01:35:19.650]  sell brewers don't want to hear it. People that want to buy brewers don't want to hear it, but
[01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:25.730]  I'm telling you, we get remarkable results using small barrels. And most employees want to clock
[01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:31.570]  in and clock out. It's, you know, as much as everybody wants to be in cannabis and wants that
[01:35:31.570 --> 01:35:37.970]  job in it or whatever, a lot of people turn it into the clock in and clock out. And if you don't
[01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:46.050]  make it easy and somewhat desirable, it just becomes, you know, it becomes the next guy's job
[01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:51.090]  and the new guy, the next, and it just moves on. And so a lot of these jobs, you know, we're not
[01:35:51.090 --> 01:35:56.210]  saying everything's easy, there's work involved, but you have to make it safe, first of all. And
[01:35:56.210 --> 01:36:01.250]  if it's not safe, that's an issue. And secondly, if it's not something that people are like feeling
[01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:07.010]  passionate about, it drives down morale. Because you're working with a big team of people and
[01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:13.090]  all it takes is one, you know, seedling or one, you know, cell to start to have that,
[01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:18.850]  you know, uninspired attitude and it drags the whole bunch down. And a lot of these corporate
[01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:23.250]  facilities don't give a fuck about, you know, they're not there to make friends. So I mean,
[01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:27.010]  you can, they see that shit and you're gone quick. So I mean, at the end of the day,
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:33.170]  you know, making these facilities smooth and enticing for employees is important because
[01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:38.050]  again, once you start getting to that clock in, clock out, passion drives down and we're not
[01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:43.410]  actually leveling up at that point. Well, what kind of evolved us to the barrels is we were
[01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:49.410]  working on a large ag project. We don't just do cannabis, we do anything. And we did a farm that
[01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:57.170]  was 6,000 acres of corn and soy. And we had like six 250 gallon tea brewers that were in IBC totes,
[01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:01.570]  which kind of solves the problem at scale, but I have objections to as well. But nonetheless,
[01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:07.170]  we were running those. And so Sarah and I developed the SOP and determine how many minutes,
[01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:12.530]  how much compost, how much time, what process yields the appropriate result. And then we turn
[01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:17.970]  that over to employees. And as soon as the employees take over that job, we start having
[01:37:17.970 --> 01:37:22.770]  problems with the numbers on the extract. We start getting undesirable aspects to it. The quality
[01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:27.250]  goes down because they're not able to clean it. They're not super motivated to climb in that thing
[01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:31.650]  and scrub it like we do. So you start to lose repeatability. And so that's really where the
[01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:38.370]  55 gallon barrel excels is that it's small, it's compact, it's consistent. It keeps it even,
[01:37:38.370 --> 01:37:43.970]  it keeps it in small enough batches to go from space to space to space. And it's repeatable and
[01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:49.170]  it's easy to clean out. And we see this in other areas like Frenchie Cannoli doesn't make hash in
[01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:55.250]  a 400 gallon barrel. He makes it in the same damn size that the little washing machines are because
[01:37:55.250 --> 01:38:00.770]  you get better extraction rates and you get more consistency. And so we just tried to replicate
[01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:06.850]  that model. And like Eric says, is produce a standard operating procedure that's not painful
[01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:13.170]  to an employee that doesn't add undue process or headache or reasons to get yelled at or
[01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:19.410]  any of that thing. And the 55 gallon drum solves all those problems. It keeps the extract into a
[01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:25.570]  small container so you don't magnify variation. You get really consistent dispensing of organisms
[01:38:25.570 --> 01:38:30.370]  across the property from corner to corner. And most employees can rinse it out with a hose and
[01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:37.010]  turn it upside down and clean it properly, which is the actual goal. And that is one of the major
[01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:42.290]  components that's missing from the commercially produced tea brewers that is becoming very
[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:47.570]  apparent in the regulated market. And we've worked with some facilities in Vegas, which has a
[01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:54.930]  remarkably difficult microbial things to navigate. And we tracked several facilities over the course
[01:38:54.930 --> 01:39:01.890]  of a year and saw microbial issues popping up with certain types of tea brewers in process. And again,
[01:39:02.690 --> 01:39:08.770]  you know, we moved away from a lot of types of equipment and, you know, as unsexy it is and as
[01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:14.130]  disappointing as it is, we by far get the best results using a couple of blue barrels and a
[01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:21.090]  hundred dollar pump from Home Depot. Yeah. Like if you if you listen to Dr. Ingham, so much of
[01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:26.610]  compost tea was really designed to do the glue binding was to bind the particles so that you
[01:39:26.610 --> 01:39:34.370]  start to have the ability to take soil that had inadequate tilth and increase it. And we started
[01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:39.890]  using it as these inoculants. And the thing was that as you start to learn, you're not qualified
[01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:44.370]  on the microscope. So you have no idea what you're brewing and you end up seeing pathogenic
[01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:51.090]  problems resulting from your work because you're kind of using voodoo science. And I think the
[01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:56.290]  compost extract is excellent because it's you're able to take what you want to take and put it in.
[01:39:56.290 --> 01:40:03.250]  But I think the compost tea designed for, you know, building ground that isn't ready for cultivation
[01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:08.530]  and preparing it, laying the cover crops in, binding the soil, gluing it together. I think
[01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:15.250]  that's the purpose of it more than the way we use it. Sure. Because I was I was a brewer, too. And
[01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:20.530]  I got to a size in brew tank where I was probably like 250. But it got to the size where it was.
[01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:25.650]  I got to climb up in the damn thing to clean it. It becomes a nightmare. You can't flip it. It
[01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:31.970]  starts to become too big to service. Yeah. And I didn't want to centralize monster tank to feed
[01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:35.970]  through because I'm like, you start leaving residue in the lines. You're starting to have
[01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:41.970]  pathogenic contamination because it has to be clean. And you start to realize you're doing the
[01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:45.410]  same thing. You're starting in a closet and you're trying to multiply it out to acreage.
[01:40:46.210 --> 01:40:52.930]  Yeah. And yeah. And also, too, it's it you know, what we do now is also a, you know,
[01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:58.770]  millions of square feet of evolution. And compost tea is a remarkably powerful tool.
[01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:03.810]  You know, one of our counterparts, Nick Tomasini, goes by Humankind Organ. He uses a lot of compost
[01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:09.650]  tea. And, you know, if you properly brew tea and you get it onto the plants, I mean, next morning,
[01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:14.850]  there's a new branch. It's some wild. I mean, if you do it right and you hit the numbers that Dr.
[01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:21.970]  Lane defines, it's pure witchcraft. But a lot of times the compost tea is a fourth quarter decision,
[01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:27.090]  not the way Nick uses it, but like to combat disease or whatever. So you're throwing a hail
[01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:31.010]  Mary at fourth quarter. And, you know, what my wife and I have done have gone was like,
[01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:35.730]  how do we circle back to the very beginning to circumvent problems, to not need a fourth
[01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:42.450]  quarter decision? And that strategy is getting back to a compost extract, starting at the beginning,
[01:41:42.450 --> 01:41:47.890]  starting with organisms that are distributed evenly from corner to corner, start with a tank
[01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:53.330]  that doesn't also bring disease and then monitor that process effectively and appropriately. So,
[01:41:53.970 --> 01:41:59.410]  you know, you can't you can avoid or excuse me, you can take a compost tea and you can knock out
[01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:04.050]  powdery mildew. We've done it before. We used to do it back in the earlier years, but it was just,
[01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:08.290]  it was too complicated as a business strategy. So we stopped doing it, but you can come up to
[01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:13.970]  a facility and stop a whole bunch of nightmares with a really good tea. But we can also go back
[01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:20.290]  to propagation, start fresh, start with a good extract, use the microscope to quantify your
[01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:25.970]  trajectory as you go from start to finish. And you can avoid getting mold by making watering changes,
[01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:30.450]  by making feed changes, by, you know, in a lot of cases, making environmental changes.
[01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:37.570]  So we, you know, what came with regulation for us is, you know, prior in the in the black markets,
[01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:42.050]  it was a by all means necessary approach. You could spray mycobutanol in the last week if you
[01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:47.010]  really felt like that's what you were going to do. And because we can't do these, we have to get back
[01:42:47.010 --> 01:42:53.330]  to the beginning of the root cause, identify what the actual issue is and avoid hitting that island
[01:42:53.330 --> 01:43:07.960]  all together. So just to completely change it up in our home stretch, Kevin, what genetics are you
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:14.440]  seeing trending? Like, let's get into kind of what people are growing this year and what's trending
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:20.200]  up, what's trending down and then prices. And I think, Eric, you know, you've been in the price
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:27.480]  game for a while. And, you know, are we going to see stable prices in the, you know, light depth
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.080]  season and the fall harvest? Are we going to, are prices going up? Are they going down? What cultivars
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:41.720]  are people growing? What's the hot stuff? Hot stuff is always the what's the trendy, but trendy
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:47.320]  internet driven. But it has a commonality in the sense that it's got something gas in it,
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:54.440]  something that's got a battery cake, something that has some type of citrus or flavor from like
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.920]  cherry pie. So you have Skittle, which dries orange, that's in your runs. You have any of
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:06.520]  your gelatos and then any of the cakes, then they go ice cream cake, they throw the cherry pie back
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:14.040]  in it. Anything that's OG driven. It's just that the people are seeking OG that used to be more OG.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.720]  So they want to go back to the foundations of OG where they don't have such a
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:25.880]  changed profile. And I think that when people talk about trends, you got to understand that
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:31.400]  if you're a greenhouse operator, an indoor operator, you can control your swing between
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.640]  day and night. Your diurnal temperature change is much smaller than an outdoor grower.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:44.760]  If you use grape as an example, when you start to have a small swing, it produces a lighter,
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:51.400]  more delicate flavor. The greater swing produces a more robust flavor. And so when people take
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:57.640]  varieties that have a robust, full flavor that they're used to, and they transfer them into
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:02.040]  situations where they get less of a day night swing, they turn down the volume.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.320]  And conversely, if someone takes something that has delicate flavors and they put them in the
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:14.360]  outdoor environment, it harshens it. And so you have to be able to determine like,
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:18.920]  what are you doing as a producer and what works in your environment that's going to give the
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:25.160]  customer what they seek? What's their expectation? And you're trying to give someone something that
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.840]  is going to catch what's currently in vogue, which is something that has flavor and has power.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:36.840]  We're power addicted. Low number stuff just doesn't move. Things that are trendy most
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:43.720]  definitely move. The education on small batch craft cannabis is an educational process because
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:49.320]  the average consumer isn't aware of it. So you have to take a look at what's trending,
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:56.440]  but what is on the ass end of a trend? And if you go to a dispensary and you see 17 gelatos,
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:01.640]  you might not want to grow gelato because you're going to have to compete with 17 other people on
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:09.560]  the shelf. And so what big companies don't do is they don't run past day 65, 63. There's like a
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.960]  little sweet spot. So that takes them right out of GMO type stuff. GMO meaning that beautiful
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.600]  cookie cut, right? It's just really rich, but it'll pull 34. I mean, it's hot,
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:28.680]  but it needs to go a deep cycle. Stuff like that is where the craft cultivators have to work.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:35.240]  You have to go to things that give you a natural advantage because the market won't be big enough
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:41.240]  to overpopulate because larger companies won't produce those varieties. So you have to go into
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:46.360]  storefronts. You got to identify, because that's where this is all moving, is storefronts. So you
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:53.480]  got to go take a look and say, what's on the shelves? What seems to be not in stock frequently?
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:57.320]  And then what you do is you don't have to look for that exact product. You have to understand
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:03.320]  what it is that people are getting from that product. And once you have that, now you can
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:08.280]  create something that's a substitute for that product. And it allowed the bud tenders, the
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.040]  salespeople to be able to move it. So as long as it fits the distributor needs where it's above a
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:18.440]  certain numeric, I'd say, and this doesn't have to be about real and perceptions and all the other
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:23.640]  shit. If it's not above 25, this shit's sitting in a box. So it's got to have numerics that are
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:30.520]  adequate to move through distribution. And it has to be on a level that's not so overproduced
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:35.640]  that you'll be able to have velocity of return on your product. But the bottom line is cannabis
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.560]  doesn't break up into so many divisions. It's still breaking up into fuel, earth, fruit,
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:45.080]  and floral. And the subsets that follow within that are true. And each one of those divisions
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:52.920]  hit specific markets differently. And for you as the producer, you have to be aware of what
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:58.600]  distributor you're using and what stores they sell to so that you can understand where your
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:04.040]  product's going to end up. So that if you're dropping OG into San Francisco, it's not going
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.000]  to move to the tech crowd because that's not what they desire as an effect. Maybe in coronavirus
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.400]  time because they're in the house. But prior, they needed things that were more cerebral,
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:18.360]  uplifting, more in the fruits and florals. If you're moving it to old school groups,
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.480]  they're not looking for fruit. They need something that's got a heavier sit down,
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.760]  something that reminds them of the past, those earth groups. So the trending part about it is
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.800]  that everyone looks like, what's the big picture? But you as the grower have to identify who moves
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:37.320]  your product as your distributor. Where does your distributor move that product to? And all these
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.440]  questions can be answered. No one's trying to keep it secret from each other because the
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:45.720]  distributor, the storefront, the producer does not want to lose money. So you just have to be
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.520]  able to be proactive on this. And that's what people think. They just, I got some clones. I
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.320]  grew it. Now I'm trying to get rid of it because that's how we always grew pot. That is not the
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:49:01.720]  way you grow pot right now. You form your reliance on your distributor because you need him. Without
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.840]  him, you can't move the grass. He needs you to have product that moves. You can sit down and say,
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:11.960]  where are you short? Where do you see supply issues? Where's a rover production? And then you
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.200]  can actually start to make the decisions. The tough part about trendy shit is trying to go
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.840]  through the nurseries to get the material because you have so many nurseries popping up and none of
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.520]  this shit's necessarily genomically marked. So you don't have a goddamn idea what you're picking up
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:30.440]  and you get things that are this, but they're not really that they're a, they're an S one of it.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.880]  Quality's not present. So there's no list of nurseries right now that have the things that
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:42.520]  you need. And that information has to be present unless you hold all your own stock and you produce
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:48.200]  it yourself and you're developing a stability, which is fine. It's just that it doesn't let you
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.280]  get trendy markets, which is higher price points because there's less of it. And there's more
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.600]  marketing that's built in through the internet. So I think, you know, for the, for the larger
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:02.600]  producers recognize that your facilities produce a product that has a lighter, more delicate flavor
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:09.000]  period. It just holds true. The stress from that switch makes the plant produce differently
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.840]  in terms of flavonoid and terpene production. So accentuate that fact. Most people like
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:21.800]  biled wine, not robust wine. So the crowds that want the robust, let them get it from the craft
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.320]  producers because their situation will accentuate it. Larger producers go after the varieties as
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.000]  they sift and smoke and say, Ooh, this is delicate and light. Doesn't make me choke.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.680]  Doesn't make me cough. Very, very refined. Go that route and identify which, which is the hot
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:43.080]  items in the market. And then try to figure out why are people buying it repetitively?
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:47.400]  Trendy shit only sells once if it's really just trendy. If it sells over and over again,
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.360]  it's satisfying something. And I try to identify what that is. I smoke and I go,
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:56.040]  wait, what am I getting out of this shit? And sometimes I go, I'm not getting a damn thing
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:00.840]  out of it. I'm just getting the best marketing ever seen where they're able to push this product.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:07.000]  So fucking well that they convince you, you need to buy it. But if it's genuine, you'll buy it
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.640]  again. And that's what you're trying to see. What are the things that are hot? Why are they moving?
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:16.680]  Someone talks about, you know, we don't like new strains and it's the, it's the heritage
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:20.760]  strains. I'm like, well, fucking white ruts won the Emerald cup. The judges of the Emerald cup
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:26.600]  aren't a bunch of new people. They're old smokers. That variety satisfied their needs to the degree
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:33.080]  that they liked it. And then you look at Josh D he's not small. He took the original OG cut
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:36.760]  or he had moved it ended well. I think he did an ice cream cake that moved well.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:42.680]  So using his production methodologies, using varieties that have a current applicability,
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:48.840]  he was able to also win an Emerald cup for his division. And so it shows that some of these
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:54.680]  things can shine in the right environments and that the people don't swing so radically in what
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:52:00.200]  they want. You don't have to chase the new, new perpetually because what takes place is you don't
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:05.000]  have an ability to optimize your production. So you never get comfortable with the cultivator
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.720]  where you're able to understand what was the optimization to make it primo. So when, when
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.600]  people chase trends, I'm like, look, 20% of your canopy, let it be the trend. You know, another
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:20.040]  60% of your canopy, let it be the stuff that's, that's your, your goodie. And then have another,
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.040]  you know, 20% of the canopy has insurance where the shit comes off no matter if it's
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.320]  grasshoppers and hail hit it. Cause you need something to pay the bill. And I think that,
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:36.360]  you know, the way you, you, you stratify your, your crop portfolio is about insurance, stability,
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:43.000]  burgeoning trends. Is that, that was solid. Yeah. That was, that was awesome. Yeah. Cause
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.800]  the daytime smokers are the main consumers that are going to the dispensaries throughout the day.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:52.600]  Aren't, you know, trying to get annihilated all the time. You know, most of us, the seasoned
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:57.000]  veterans, I guess you could say we're, you know, going for that annihilator shit first, you know,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:07.400]  fall day, the new recreational market is fine with blue dream. And blue dream, blue dream cannot be
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:14.360]  bound. That's the problem that if blue dream sold all the weight that it did, does that mean that
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.080]  everyone who smoked it was stupid? You mean they didn't, they didn't like what they liked?
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.560]  The people that smoke it aren't on Instagram. That's all.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.840]  Yeah. Yeah. And blue dream done right is good. Blue dream got turned into really bunk where
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:36.760]  people started pulling it early and just pushing the shit out of it. But long cycle blue dream is
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:45.560]  really a nice variety and done right. It's it's, it's good. And so those things fit certain markets.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:49.720]  That's if you look at blue dream, blue dream, Seattle and San Francisco,
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:55.400]  two tech hubs, number one fucking product in those groups, because they don't want to get
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:00.520]  wiped out. They need enough mental acuity to continue stealing all America's money.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:09.320]  And they need to get enough. They need to know. That says enough right there.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:09.880]  Yeah.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:16.760]  How about this? What was in the Mason jar that you were smelling earlier?
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:25.640]  Oh, that's a that's a black lime reserve F2 from the old aficionado release. And then we went into
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:30.760]  it and I went looking for something that had really no gas in it more in line with Jackson's
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.680]  black lime than the black lime reserve because the reserve was that heavy chem that Leo and Ellie put
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:45.400]  into that mix. And rest in peace, Ellie. The it's just really clear and light in terms of the smoke
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:50.440]  and just gives me this uplifting buzz. So it's kind of fun to smoke sometimes when I when I want
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:57.480]  to get high, but I don't want to have to wrestle with the high. I'll burn it, but it's just really,
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:03.320]  really limey and clean and just it's really good grass, man. That's a good selection. I didn't
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:08.040]  select it. A friend of mine did, but he's got a really developed palate and pulled out a large
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.000]  breeding project. He said, hey, I got the cut you're looking for. I'll hook you up.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:18.040]  And then, Eric, what when you say you smoke the knock you out shit starting when you wake up,
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:24.120]  what are you smoking? Well, I mean, I'm I'm always an OG leaning towards, you know,
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.760]  living in Grass Valley for almost 20 years now. There's been a lot of OG. We went from
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:37.560]  AFG to OG overnight around here. And the OG just I don't know, it just sits well with me,
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:44.040]  but I can't always find or get the traditional OG that we started out with. So I'm kind of onto that
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:52.360]  variations of things of different OG Finos or cuts or whatever renames they are. But, you know,
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.040]  I'm always happy when I can get linked up with people that have some, you know, Kim D or I'm
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.400]  happy with gelato and some of the, you know, like when I'm up north, I try to search out some of the
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.520]  stuff that won the Emerald Cup, you know, because you can't find it further south. A lot of the
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:16.440]  local dispensaries up in Humboldt have the if not the variety of those farms. And so, you know,
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:22.520]  I personally am a big fan of all the craft farms, you know, from here to, you know, any of them
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:27.560]  anywhere, but from here north of where I'm at. So I can't find that stuff.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:34.680]  Give some love to some of those farms. Kevin, since you're based in Humboldt,
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:39.160]  you want to give some love to some farms? Yeah, there's a lot of good farms. Ridgeline,
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:44.520]  I know Gelman that won the Emerald Cup. I want to say, you know, if you look at companies like
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:50.680]  Redwood Roots, their distributors, almost all the groups that are running under their banner
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:59.640]  are local good farms. Moon, Moon, Moon Gazer, the Jacob and Carla from the farm over in Trinity,
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:06.440]  just stunning farmers. Briceland, you have a lot of really nice farmers,
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:13.240]  in the sense that their relationship with cannabis is developed. And so what they're
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.000]  really trying to do is give you the best possible product where they take it to the
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:24.200]  moment of ripeness. Like there's a level of care. It's really impressive. And it's something that I
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:31.400]  look up to as a farmer, because these people, that's all they do is farm that grass. And I have
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:37.720]  a variety of things I'm involved in as a farmer. But I most definitely looked at these people for
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:45.240]  inspiration on terms of the finest details of care. And it just reflects, but it's all over
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:51.160]  the place. It's not just us here. Everywhere I travel to craft farmers or craft farmers,
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:56.920]  whether they're from New England, Michigan, the whole Pacific Northwest, it's all the same. It's
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:03.560]  people and it doesn't have to be old or young. It's this desire to do a better job and drive a
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:10.360]  higher level product. And it's a beautiful thing to see. And at the same time, it's kind of heavy
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:15.240]  because they're not capitalized. They can't gain funding. It's hard to tell an investor that
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.080]  you're here to do the best job. He's like, I just need to get fucking paid. And they're like, well,
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:24.520]  I can, I only make this much money. They don't see the value. So they can't gather the funding.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:32.440]  They need to have liquidity to stay alive during the process. And so you see them breaking down.
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.960]  It's brutal. The best farmers in the country. Nothing can go wrong.
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:42.680]  No, no mistakes made. And they look old, man. I thought I look old. I'm like, holy shit,
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:49.480]  they're catching up. And it's that struggle of trying to hold your ethics on. I want to produce
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:54.360]  the best grass that I can grow and I want to give it to the customer. So the customer gets that
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:59:00.760]  experience. And it's incredible to be able to source those farms. And so that's why I shouted
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:07.560]  out to the Roots guys, because yeah, Topes moving the brands forward. There's Humboldt brand,
[01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:12.040]  Humboldt brand, Reuben and the boys are trying to get the Humboldt products out into the public.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:16.120]  And I'm sure there's groups in other counties that I'm not familiar with that are also the
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:22.200]  purveyors of farm products and putting it out. It's just the bottom line is the farms don't get
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:27.720]  enough of recognition. What happens is you see a video and it shows some farms, but it never lets
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:33.640]  the farmer sit down and kind of talk to you a little bit and connects to the public about what
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:40.200]  we're trying to deliver. And then the farmer can then portray the picture. The consumer can say,
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:46.520]  you know what? I like things like that. I like stone fruit herb, meaning peach flavors,
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:52.360]  apricot flavors, cherry flavors. I like those things. These guys focus on that. It seems to do
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:58.120]  well. That's where I'm going to go make my decision. None of this information is accessible
[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:02.920]  by the public. And it's just miserable because the public is getting fucked because they don't
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:09.000]  get to get the good grass they want for the exquisite experience. And as these farmers
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.240]  disappear, so much of that desire to produce anything over 60 days disappears.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:19.000]  Yeah. And that's the thing. There's a lot of good people on the bench right now,
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.320]  still from the changeover of Prop 64, whether in a banned county or just aren't able to pull
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:29.800]  a license together yet and some of the things like that. So, I mean, there's still a lot more to come
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:35.400]  as soon as some of those things get worked out. A lot of missing people are going to come back and
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:40.520]  a lot of people that maybe had to take a break, whatever the case is, because, yeah, I mean,
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:47.480]  I think there's a lot of room for craft for a long time coming because like we said earlier,
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.480]  some of the bigger facilities, some of the consumers, there's a lot of education that
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.760]  needs to go to the consumer too, because a lot of that craft stuff stays in these crafty areas as
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.960]  well. The consumers that know craft don't let that shit get out very far. And like you were saying,
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:07.640]  I got to second that big ups to the Redwood Roots family because they really get it out there and
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:13.160]  work with a lot of great farms. And I've always kind of thought they were a cool group of people.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:20.600]  So just quickly focusing on the California market and kind of the economy right now and
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:26.280]  coronavirus and all that. Eric, you're current, I mean, if I understand correctly, you're consulting
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:35.880]  with a large Salinas project, right? Yeah. So which implies that there's a large investment
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:41.560]  and they're putting money in, they're doubling down in this market. So what are you all seeing?
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:50.360]  Like, is this year, are we going to see year over year growth and acres harvested and total weight
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.080]  in the California? Like is stuff still growing? Are investments being made? Are people pulling
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:00.920]  back? What are your predictions for 2020 given that it's a complete knuckleball of the year?
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:07.240]  Well, I think people are going for it if they can, because the prices have gone up. I mean,
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.000]  we saw a little bit of a drought last year. So the idea is to capitalize on the chances that
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  that drought could exist again, starting now until maybe even July, depending on how the
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.080]  weather goes is going to dictate a lot of that stuff too, because with the colder springs,
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.160]  it's harder to get planted. And even though people get planted, a lot of people don't have
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:32.840]  adequate heating systems to primarily keep the soil and the water warm. So they're irrigating
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.480]  with colder water until the temperatures warm up and things like that. And so really last year,
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:42.840]  as much as prices were going up, it was hard to get everything to market and have debt season,
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:47.640]  be a true debt season, like it normally was in July, because a good amount of people didn't
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.040]  get planted right away. Part of it was the licensing too, if your license was coming out
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:57.240]  of that temporary zone or whatever. And so there was just a lot of calamities going on at one time,
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:02.280]  but depending on the weather going forward this year, because even more sophisticated greenhouses
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:07.400]  are bigger, not even that sophisticated, don't have a root zone heating. They just have up above
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.560]  heating. And nine times out of 10, when I go to places, they'll tell me the angle of the sun.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:16.120]  And when I ask them what the temperature of the soil is, they don't know. And if it's below 55
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:22.680]  degrees, we're growing popcorn and it isn't the angle of the sun. So, you know, we kind of have
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.920]  to see it's hard to make those projections, but if everything goes right, weather-wise coming into
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:32.120]  spring right now, and people get planted and we get the yields in July is what it's supposed to be,
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:37.080]  then, you know, I think, you know, everybody's got a good chance. But if we start to see cold
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:42.680]  spring continuing areas, we're going to see less product coming out that's viable and not everybody
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.240]  can bounce to biomass anymore, unless you're vertically integrated and you're making your
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:51.960]  own oil and freezing your own product right there. Not everybody's running around going,
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:56.280]  where's the biomass? Where's the biomass? And the people that are hunting biomass are really
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.480]  strict about what they want anymore. It's not just biomass. It's got to be high THC, non-detect,
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:08.200]  an intense screening process goes on and things like that. And so, you know, it's always changing
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:14.760]  in the art of the pivot is really the name of the game. The art of the pivot. You're right.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:21.320]  Well, the beard bros did a thing with the TG genetics on his propagating purpose. And
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:26.520]  that was the name of the podcast, but it couldn't be more poignant because that's, you know, I met
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:31.160]  with the beard bros the other night and it's all strategy and how are we going to pivot through
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:35.800]  this one? Whether it's an upcoming job that we're trying to pitch or, you know, work on,
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.480]  or if it's just the long-term game, how, what, what's next and how do we see what's coming,
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:45.960]  you know, without having to revert to news articles and things like that. It's really
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.680]  the boots on the ground and talking to people. And, you know, luckily some of us like, you know,
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:56.120]  Scott and Kevin and, and some of these other guys are able to get onto farms or talk with farmers
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.200]  and kind of get the real aspect, but we're not out here writing articles and letting everybody know,
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:04.920]  you know, it's not a billboard that you can drive by or a ticker tape or something like that. It
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:10.040]  really is, you know, like farming, you're talking to people and you're trying to look at mother
[02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:14.280]  nature and you're looking at the other aspects and trying to put this puzzle together and see,
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:19.800]  you know, where it's going to go. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm missing the, the golden tarp days and
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.320]  wondering if we're ever going to have any events, are we going to be able to get together and share
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:29.880]  a joint in a couple of years? I mean, what's happening? Before 20, we, we, we, we went over
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:35.320]  to my Pedro's house. We all had our own weed and we all stood six fucking foot apart and we all
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.600]  laughed and we were like, Hey, we're hanging out, but we're, we're all distanced apart.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:46.680]  Yeah. We're not sharing joints. We're not sharing hugs. It's a fucking whole thing.
[02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:51.880]  And you got, you got, there was, you know, this isn't, this isn't done yet. This,
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.360]  this stuff is just beginning this type of viral contamination issues for us socially.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:06:03.960]  And so it changes dramatically about people's connection to others and how they use cannabis
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:07.720]  and how they get information. So everyone's on the internet right now. That's why, that's why
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:13.000]  the signals jam because everybody's on the net. The problem is there's so much bullshit info
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:20.920]  and it fucking blows my mind. And people are so quick to attack other people that anybody that
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:27.640]  has a question gets beat down by people that can type quickly. So nobody, nobody has any fucking
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:35.240]  clue what's going on. And the problem is, is that you have no, no, no way to know. And so I'm,
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:41.320]  you know, I'm just grateful that I've been in the game for a long enough time that it lets me see
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:47.080]  what's taken place by just virtue of being here. And I try to share the information I can,
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:52.200]  that's not on a disclosure agreement. So a disclosure agreement, I can't tell you any of
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:57.560]  that shit, but the stuff that I uncover myself, I can share because I know that the information
[02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:03.640]  isn't going to make you take me out. You're going to have to go execute. But I want to see people do
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:09.480]  well because I I've always had this dream of a, of a unified industry where we could all grow
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:14.360]  cannabis all over the place. And you got to see the diversity, you got to see the complexity,
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:21.640]  you got to see the unity. And in my mid fifties, you know, that's still my goal. So it's, it's,
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:25.320]  it's, it's a really good thing that, you know, you put this together, Pete, to get a bunch of
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:34.920]  us together to talk to the public. I'd love to pick your brain. I monetize that, you know, it's,
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.280]  it's 300 bucks for an hour on the phone. And I tell you so much shit that you don't know what
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:45.480]  the fuck to do with it after I'm done. I give you every fucking option you pick.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:58.200]  Well, let's wrap on that. And I, we still have a hundred and 70 something people tuned in.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:00.760]  Thanks for listening.
[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:04.760]  And the next time we talk, Kevin, you're going to have a bouncing baby boy or girl?
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:05.960]  A little boy.
[02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:07.720]  Another boy.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:08.120]  Nice.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.840]  Boy. Yeah. A little boy do sometime this week. Excited. We went to the hospital yesterday
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:18.120]  and he was pushing his feet up through his, like his mom's skin almost. And I could count his
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:18.760]  little toes.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:21.080]  That's awesome.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.520]  Yeah, that was great. It was great. So, you know, even with the coronavirus shit, there's still
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:30.840]  life. And even with the complete chaos in cannabis, there's still, there's still love for
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:35.480]  cannabis and cannabis cultivation and, and all the operators that within it. And so, you know,
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:39.320]  man, keep your fucking chin up. Be like Smith. Hard enough.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.760]  All right, everybody. Thank you very much. And tune in next time.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.320]  Thanks, Peter.
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.600]  Thank you. Right on.
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.880]  Good talking to you, Kev.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:51.000]  Right on. You too, guys. Good seeing you.
