[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  your shows. Yeah.
[00:04.320 --> 00:08.240]  Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Welcome, everyone. We're here to
[00:08.240 --> 00:11.960]  talk land races today with Jamal and Grasshopper. And I'm just
[00:11.960 --> 00:17.020]  here to run the board and let these guys talk about what they
[00:17.020 --> 00:20.640]  know. I'm gonna sit back and listen and maybe have some
[00:20.640 --> 00:23.640]  questions with along with the rest of you all later. So take
[00:23.640 --> 00:25.000]  it away, man. It's nice meeting you.
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.800]  Nice to meet you. Hello, everybody. My name is Jamal. I've
[00:29.800 --> 00:36.480]  been on the James Loud show before. I'm actually the the
[00:36.480 --> 00:41.680]  founding member of East Bay seed collective. We are a seed
[00:41.680 --> 00:44.840]  collective that focuses on land race genetics, heirloom
[00:44.840 --> 00:50.720]  genetics, elite cuts, and we share and breed with them as a
[00:50.720 --> 00:57.240]  group. We enjoy watching future cannabis project, we listen to
[00:57.240 --> 01:02.120]  these and talk about them as a group all the time. One of our
[01:03.920 --> 01:07.960]  one of the things that I saw that's kind of been missing is
[01:07.960 --> 01:12.440]  the conversation on African land race genetics. And so that was
[01:12.440 --> 01:18.200]  the impetus behind this conversation. And yeah, I hope
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.360]  that you guys enjoy it. My one of the guests that we have on is
[01:23.360 --> 01:26.000]  my good friend grasshopper, who's part of our seed
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.880]  collective. He brings a lot of wealth and experience to the
[01:30.880 --> 01:34.320]  table and has some very interesting stories that we're
[01:34.320 --> 01:39.480]  going to share today and you know, talk about African
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.720]  genetics. Good morning, grasshopper. How are you doing?
[01:44.240 --> 01:47.000]  Doing great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greetings.
[01:47.960 --> 01:52.800]  Yeah, greetings. So I guess the first thing I wanted to talk
[01:52.800 --> 02:01.680]  about is, um, let's jump in with the, uh, let's, I mean, let's
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.640]  just jump in with the, with the why, why African genetics? I
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.840]  mean, they're not super common. Why do you breed with them,
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.400]  grasshopper?
[02:12.400 --> 02:15.680]  I breed with them because they, you know, they, they, they
[02:17.680 --> 02:25.850]  experience that they bring and it's just a different
[02:25.850 --> 02:30.650]  meditation. It's just a wonderful thing. And there's a
[02:30.650 --> 02:35.930]  lot of cool things about them. And I breed with them mainly,
[02:35.970 --> 02:37.330]  mainly for preservation.
[02:38.330 --> 02:49.490]  For sure. Um, so I've grown your axis by, by Cisguy. Um,
[02:49.490 --> 02:59.410]  Cisguy is a, is a, is a, is a, is a, is a, is a, is a, is a
[02:59.410 --> 03:09.210]  I've grown your axis by Cisguy. Um, and I actually hadn't really
[03:09.210 --> 03:12.930]  heard much of what's of Cisguy. Can you, would you be willing to
[03:12.930 --> 03:13.810]  elaborate on that one?
[03:15.130 --> 03:19.850]  Sure. I could, I could, um, tell you guys the story, how I
[03:19.850 --> 03:26.170]  understand it. Um, Cisguy, there was a group of people that was
[03:26.170 --> 03:30.770]  called the Bantu people or the Bantustan in South Africa region.
[03:30.810 --> 03:35.690]  And, um, during the time of apartheid, they were denied
[03:35.730 --> 03:42.250]  citizenship, um, to, to be a part of a South African country
[03:42.250 --> 03:46.650]  itself. So they had to, they, they were pushed out into like
[03:46.730 --> 03:51.610]  these, what you would refer to as more the South, Southeast part
[03:51.610 --> 03:57.170]  of South Africa. And these people included, uh, the people
[03:57.170 --> 04:00.170]  that we know from Transkei today, the people we know from
[04:00.170 --> 04:06.370]  Cisguy today, and those people are, are the Xhosa speaking
[04:06.370 --> 04:12.650]  people. And they are members of the Bantu, Bantustan. And the
[04:12.650 --> 04:18.690]  other member of the Bantustan was the, uh, Zulus. And, um, so
[04:18.730 --> 04:21.770]  they were denied citizenship and then they had to move a
[04:21.770 --> 04:24.490]  little bit more to the Southeast. And, and then the
[04:24.490 --> 04:29.970]  Zulus, they kind of, um, they kind of occupied the area around
[04:29.970 --> 04:34.650]  Swazulu, that we know as Swazulu. And then, um, Transkei
[04:34.690 --> 04:40.290]  and Cisguy, the Xhosa people, they kind of, kind of settled
[04:40.290 --> 04:46.090]  on, on each side of a bay kind of river, or I think it's a
[04:46.090 --> 04:49.530]  river. And this side is Transkei and the other side is
[04:49.530 --> 04:53.010]  Cisguy. That's basically what it means. And that's how those
[04:53.010 --> 04:55.970]  streams were preserved. Because if you notice the Durban's are
[04:55.970 --> 04:59.450]  hard to come by. But if you go to South Africa, you can easily
[04:59.450 --> 05:02.450]  come across Cisguy because, you know, when these people were
[05:02.450 --> 05:06.010]  pushed out, they took that with them, you know, and then you had
[05:06.010 --> 05:11.530]  the crackdown on the herb in the, you know, in the 30s, 40s,
[05:11.530 --> 05:15.330]  50s, 60s in South Africa under the Bota government and stuff
[05:15.330 --> 05:19.570]  like that. So that's why those things are available today. And
[05:19.570 --> 05:22.730]  that's one of the reasons I choose to try to source them
[05:22.730 --> 05:27.650]  from the source and preserve them because, you know, if you
[05:27.650 --> 05:32.650]  notice the Durban's are harder to come by. A lot of the other
[05:32.650 --> 05:35.610]  streams, some Lesotho's, and a lot of other streams that
[05:35.610 --> 05:39.050]  existed in South Africa kind of got pushed out. So we, we kind
[05:39.050 --> 05:42.730]  of have to, you know, be grateful for those people and
[05:42.730 --> 05:45.210]  those tribes that took those herbs with them when they were
[05:45.210 --> 05:47.770]  pushed out of South Africa. And that's why they're available
[05:47.770 --> 05:52.730]  today and they're the more common ones. You know, yeah,
[05:52.730 --> 05:55.690]  that's what I have to say about the Cisguy. And, and it's more
[05:55.690 --> 05:58.450]  South Africa, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's south of the
[05:58.450 --> 06:01.570]  equator. So they tend to be a little bit earlier, earlier
[06:01.570 --> 06:05.930]  finishing plant than if you go up into the center of Africa
[06:05.930 --> 06:08.330]  where it strikes, where the equator kind of runs down the
[06:08.330 --> 06:11.770]  middle of the Congo, then you get those 16, 18, 24 acres and
[06:11.770 --> 06:14.690]  stuff. But as soon as you move away from the equator, you go
[06:14.690 --> 06:17.690]  South Africa, you find that those streams finish in like
[06:17.690 --> 06:22.090]  14, some 12 acres, you know, that's, that's, they're kind of
[06:22.090 --> 06:25.690]  south of the equator and, you know, and farther away you go
[06:25.690 --> 06:29.650]  from the equator, the more you get, you know, into a more
[06:29.650 --> 06:32.650]  tropical vibe. And some of those places even have their winter
[06:32.650 --> 06:33.170]  and snow.
[06:35.490 --> 06:38.690]  I noticed that the ones you were all talking about were in South
[06:38.690 --> 06:42.330]  Africa. Is there a concentration of cannabis in South Africa, or
[06:42.330 --> 06:45.970]  is it just, is it pretty evenly spread throughout Africa?
[06:46.450 --> 06:49.770]  Mainly from, from, are you talking about South Africa
[06:49.770 --> 06:50.250]  itself?
[06:50.970 --> 06:53.530]  I was just saying it seemed like the strains that you were
[06:53.530 --> 06:59.290]  talking about are all over majority in South Africa. I was
[06:59.290 --> 07:02.970]  just curious if it's, if there's cannabis spread out throughout
[07:02.970 --> 07:05.290]  Africa, if there are specific locations that are more
[07:05.290 --> 07:06.010]  concentrated.
[07:07.690 --> 07:10.850]  Throughout the entire continent, and depending on what part of
[07:10.850 --> 07:14.210]  the continent you're at, you're going to hit those long
[07:14.210 --> 07:17.570]  flowering sativas that's very similar to the Colombian. They
[07:17.570 --> 07:22.450]  go, you know, 18, 16, 18, 20, 24 weeks, depending on what part
[07:22.450 --> 07:25.970]  of Africa you're getting them from, you know, because it's,
[07:26.010 --> 07:30.370]  you know, the equator kind of strikes through Colombia, through
[07:30.370 --> 07:35.890]  the Congo, and then it kind of strikes into, into some parts of
[07:35.890 --> 07:38.850]  Asia, like around Thailand and stuff. So you're gonna find that
[07:38.850 --> 07:42.210]  a lot of strains that sit right on the equator, where it's just
[07:42.210 --> 07:45.290]  a, where it's just a four to three year change of about 10
[07:45.290 --> 07:48.930]  minutes or so. Those are the ones that are taking, you know,
[07:48.930 --> 07:50.570]  those 20 weeks and stuff like that.
[07:51.530 --> 07:54.330]  Excuse me, Grasshopper, we have a couple requests, if you can
[07:54.330 --> 07:57.170]  turn your audio up a little bit so people can hear you.
[08:04.590 --> 08:06.950]  In the chats, let me let me know if that's better.
[08:06.950 --> 08:11.270]  Okay, well, so so throughout Africa, there's there's plenty
[08:11.270 --> 08:12.950]  of cannabis is basically what you're saying.
[08:13.270 --> 08:19.310]  Yeah, there's plenty, there's plenty. And, you know, from South
[08:19.310 --> 08:22.350]  Africa, all the way up to Morocco, you know, I mean, I
[08:22.350 --> 08:27.390]  consider Morocco to be like, you know, Africa as well. So you
[08:27.390 --> 08:30.110]  know, yeah, you could find different, you know, depending
[08:30.110 --> 08:33.270]  on the, on the region and the longitude latitude, then it'll
[08:33.270 --> 08:37.910]  You know, you find different flower period. But most part,
[08:39.350 --> 08:42.550]  across Africa, you know, most of the strains have
[08:45.150 --> 08:50.390]  Turkey, China, earthy flavor. That's what I discovered through
[08:50.390 --> 08:51.190]  most of the strains.
[08:54.830 --> 08:57.310]  Yeah, you're cutting out a little bit, but I'm just gonna
[08:57.310 --> 09:00.310]  say, you know, I'm just gonna say, you know, I'm not gonna
[09:01.110 --> 09:05.150]  Yeah, you're cutting out a little bit. But yeah, yeah, we
[09:05.150 --> 09:06.310]  can hear you. Um,
[09:08.470 --> 09:12.430]  yeah, definitely the earthy. Some like interesting carrot
[09:12.430 --> 09:14.390]  stuff I've heard you talk about before.
[09:14.990 --> 09:17.990]  Actually, you know, with that kind of Jack Herro kind of turf
[09:17.990 --> 09:21.790]  a little bit sweeter. And yeah, they're, they're pretty good.
[09:21.990 --> 09:24.310]  They're pretty good. And they're interesting. They
[09:26.190 --> 09:28.950]  Yeah, I love making hybrids from them and what they bring to the
[09:28.950 --> 09:29.510]  table.
[09:34.790 --> 09:39.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Maybe if you could speak into the mic
[09:39.550 --> 09:43.110]  into your into the iPad a little bit closer, that would be that'd
[09:43.110 --> 09:45.870]  be great grasshopper just so people can hear you even more.
[09:46.950 --> 09:48.870]  Yeah, I mean, I'll show right here is some
[09:50.230 --> 09:52.190]  see on the screen. This is some
[09:53.030 --> 09:58.550]  access by Cisco. And, you know, when I grew this, I thought it
[09:58.550 --> 10:02.870]  was going to be a little bit more like a wilder sitiva than
[10:02.870 --> 10:07.950]  it was. It was it was really workable. And, you know, the
[10:07.950 --> 10:12.550]  buds have have a nice substance to them, which is nice because I
[10:12.550 --> 10:16.230]  mean, often when you're growing like sativas, they get, they're
[10:16.230 --> 10:20.990]  so loose and larfy that they kind of don't have a lot of
[10:21.510 --> 10:25.390]  don't have a good substance to them. And like kind of like,
[10:25.470 --> 10:29.590]  like this kind of stuff where it's like really loose, like a
[10:29.590 --> 10:34.510]  really kind of airy and the Congolese is nice. And that or I
[10:34.510 --> 10:41.830]  guess it's the Congolese by the access by Cisco and access is
[10:41.950 --> 10:47.190]  Congolese by 88 g 13. Which is something that grasshopper
[10:47.230 --> 10:52.110]  recommended for me and gifted me a pack of seeds. Do you want to
[10:52.110 --> 10:54.830]  talk about that one a little bit? I mean, it's it seems like
[10:54.830 --> 11:00.870]  a pretty cool plant. I, you know, keep expecting it to be
[11:00.990 --> 11:06.230]  way more wild and thin leafed, but it seems it seems like a
[11:06.310 --> 11:08.150]  pretty average hybrid so far.
[11:11.950 --> 11:15.070]  Yeah, that's the reason I kind of hybridize them to make them,
[11:15.310 --> 11:18.950]  you know, attractive and a little bit easier to work with,
[11:19.350 --> 11:24.870]  you know, and they put together a little bit better as well. You
[11:24.870 --> 11:30.270]  know, what I did there was I was doing a preservation of
[11:35.110 --> 11:41.110]  source those for me, I tried to get my, you know, my, my, my
[11:41.110 --> 11:47.270]  seeds directly from the source. So in the process of preserving
[11:47.270 --> 11:52.710]  those and increasing the numbers on them, I would add certain
[11:52.710 --> 11:57.590]  plants to the to the population, or to the to the whole breeding
[11:57.590 --> 12:04.510]  operation. And what I added then was the access, which is, you
[12:04.510 --> 12:08.630]  know, you've already said it is the 88 g 13 by a black Congolese
[12:08.990 --> 12:18.320]  from Bowie. And there is a lot of hash plant influences in
[12:18.320 --> 12:21.480]  those crosses. You know, and that's the reason I feel like
[12:21.480 --> 12:24.440]  they're easier to work with. Because if you know, it kind of
[12:24.440 --> 12:26.480]  brings them and give them a little more structure, a little
[12:26.480 --> 12:29.880]  more body, and kind of shortens the flower time a little bit.
[12:30.760 --> 12:38.720]  But um, yeah, yeah, it wasn't a targeted breeding, it was part
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.600]  of open pollination preservation type. Yeah.
[12:46.990 --> 12:52.190]  Yeah, definitely. I'm really excited to, to flower them this
[12:52.190 --> 12:57.390]  year and see what they have. Elka, do you do any, any work
[12:57.390 --> 12:59.310]  with African varieties?
[13:02.070 --> 13:07.150]  I have something that supposedly has some Durban in it, but I'm
[13:07.150 --> 13:10.590]  not I'm not quite sure it does pop out a lot of licorice
[13:10.590 --> 13:13.230]  type of flavors. And I hear that that's something that is
[13:13.230 --> 13:18.750]  common in the Durban. And it does pop out some, some more
[13:18.790 --> 13:21.390]  sativa, I guess you'd call leaning phenos, but they're
[13:21.390 --> 13:25.070]  they're quick flowering. So it's a hybrid. So who knows, it
[13:25.070 --> 13:27.630]  supposedly has it in there. So that's the most that I have
[13:27.910 --> 13:30.230]  experience with it. So I'm really enjoying this
[13:30.230 --> 13:31.790]  conversation. This guy is awesome.
[13:32.350 --> 13:38.230]  For sure. Um, um, would you mind elaborating on the whole thing
[13:38.350 --> 13:42.550]  with Durban grasshopper? Because I know, like, you know, the
[13:42.550 --> 13:48.870]  whole difference between Durban poison and Durban. I mean, yeah.
[13:49.470 --> 13:52.510]  Yes, and yeah, I could talk about my knowledge or what I
[13:52.510 --> 14:00.110]  know on Durban and poison. I've worked with both of them, the
[14:00.110 --> 14:04.230]  pure Durban and the poison, which in the poison is pretty
[14:04.230 --> 14:10.470]  common. You can find Durban poison crosses all over. And I
[14:10.470 --> 14:14.350]  must say one thing with the land races is you could outcross them
[14:14.350 --> 14:16.750]  three, four times and you're going to still find those third,
[14:17.750 --> 14:23.190]  you know, very prevalent in the infraginate. But when it comes
[14:23.190 --> 14:28.430]  to the pure Durban, I prefer working with the pure Durban as
[14:28.430 --> 14:30.710]  opposed to the poison. I've worked with the poison in the
[14:30.710 --> 14:36.630]  past. It's just sometimes I don't understand what type of
[14:36.630 --> 14:40.110]  breeding or how does this, what was the process in the
[14:40.110 --> 14:44.310]  preservation of or, or the creation of the poison because
[14:44.310 --> 14:48.030]  it ended up to be this small little plant that doesn't hold
[14:48.030 --> 14:52.790]  up itself and doesn't yield much and does not do much. And, and
[14:52.790 --> 14:56.950]  the turf seems to be more, it seems like the super silver
[14:56.950 --> 15:01.230]  hairs that they added to the pure Durban to create the poison
[15:01.510 --> 15:05.990]  kind of brought some different influences into it. And for the
[15:05.990 --> 15:10.950]  most part, that is what we know. And, you know, it's the poison
[15:10.950 --> 15:17.750]  that most people work with. But I've been working with Ed
[15:17.750 --> 15:24.830]  Rosenthal's 82 pure Durban. And, you know, working with that and
[15:24.830 --> 15:28.550]  growing that and have worked with the poison in the past and
[15:28.550 --> 15:33.790]  grow the, grew the poison. It's, it's a different, it's a, the
[15:33.790 --> 15:36.990]  turps are very similar, but the structure of the plants are
[15:36.990 --> 15:40.430]  different. You know, you have a more stativa structure growing
[15:40.430 --> 15:46.190]  plant. Flowers a little bit longer, about 14 weeks and tends
[15:46.190 --> 15:51.630]  to, tends to have more of the anise phenol and the licorice
[15:51.670 --> 15:57.310]  phenol that is that most people look for in the Durban. What I
[15:57.310 --> 16:01.910]  find with the poison is more licorice than anise. You know,
[16:01.910 --> 16:05.110]  so I feel like, you know, a lot of people talk about the poison
[16:05.110 --> 16:08.430]  being anise, but it's more on the licorice side. The anise
[16:08.430 --> 16:13.670]  side is, I see it in the progeny of the pure Durban. I can see
[16:13.670 --> 16:18.790]  those. And there's always been that confusion about, you know,
[16:18.830 --> 16:22.550]  Durban poison is from South Africa. And, you know, I think
[16:22.550 --> 16:26.470]  James and a lot of other people on this same show have said the
[16:26.470 --> 16:31.750]  same thing that poison is from Europe, you know. And there's
[16:31.750 --> 16:39.950]  some suspicion that it was the 82 line from, from Ed Rosenthal
[16:40.150 --> 16:44.390]  that they took to Europe to create the poison, you know,
[16:44.390 --> 16:50.270]  Dutch passion and sensi and whoever had the poison. So I'm
[16:50.270 --> 16:53.870]  happy to be working with the original thing, start from it.
[16:53.870 --> 16:56.830]  And it's pretty interesting. I've done a lot of hybrids with
[16:56.830 --> 17:01.470]  them. And, and that's what I would have to say about that
[17:01.470 --> 17:02.070]  one, Jamal.
[17:02.310 --> 17:08.630]  And we don't know what the, what was added to it to make it
[17:09.590 --> 17:10.310]  poison.
[17:10.830 --> 17:14.070]  I mean, what they're saying is super silver haze. I mean, there
[17:14.070 --> 17:17.550]  was one time I read it was something called way back on
[17:17.550 --> 17:24.470]  like, like, like one of those forum things, but I don't see
[17:24.470 --> 17:28.030]  super silver haze in it. If they did, they were probably
[17:28.350 --> 17:34.470]  selecting the little bit of breeding. I see AC does a lot of
[17:34.470 --> 17:37.110]  that type of breeding where it's like, you know, they get a
[17:38.070 --> 17:42.150]  sativa, but it flowers like a indica and it tastes like a
[17:42.150 --> 17:44.790]  indica and the only thing sativa about it is a little small.
[17:45.710 --> 17:49.030]  You know, that's why most people are becoming accustomed to us
[17:49.190 --> 17:54.190]  as being sativas because that is what kind of is being pushed in
[17:54.190 --> 17:57.750]  the industry, as opposed to these huge plants that you could
[17:57.750 --> 18:01.510]  put into flower and about take a clone and put it into flower and
[18:01.510 --> 18:04.550]  end up to be a five foot plant with, you know, a quarter pound
[18:04.830 --> 18:09.110]  herb on it. It's a difference. You do that to one of these
[18:09.150 --> 18:13.830]  hybrids that we know as poison or as poisonous. Those things
[18:13.830 --> 18:17.910]  barely give you a few, you know, a few eights, a couple of eights,
[18:18.110 --> 18:22.150]  something like that. So that's the difference between for me
[18:22.150 --> 18:27.870]  between the poison and, and you know, and the, and the, and the
[18:27.870 --> 18:31.070]  Durban itself. I enjoy the Durban. I try to stay away from
[18:31.070 --> 18:36.430]  the poison. It doesn't have that sweeter licorice kind of
[18:36.430 --> 18:40.270]  vibe that I mean, the sweeter anise is more licorice with some
[18:40.270 --> 18:44.510]  deep earth and, and it passes on in the progeny for, I don't
[18:44.510 --> 18:48.510]  know, you would out cross it two or three times and poison is
[18:48.510 --> 18:52.790]  already an out cross. Yeah, you're still getting it. Out
[18:52.790 --> 18:55.710]  cross that again, you're still getting it. You know, that's one
[18:55.710 --> 19:01.910]  thing with these, with these sativas that they, you know,
[19:01.910 --> 19:04.150]  they don't have multiple genetics controlling the
[19:04.150 --> 19:07.350]  characteristics of the plant. It's just like mostly one or two
[19:07.350 --> 19:10.350]  genetics that controls all the characteristics of the plant. So
[19:10.350 --> 19:13.230]  it's kind of hard to beat those out of the line. You know, they
[19:13.230 --> 19:18.470]  are coming in hard and strong for generations. So, you know,
[19:18.470 --> 19:21.710]  that's the only thing with, with those is that, you know,
[19:21.710 --> 19:24.430]  breeding land races, you're going to have the influences of
[19:24.470 --> 19:28.670]  land race for the future. Crossing or more so if you're,
[19:29.270 --> 19:32.630]  you know, doing any type of hybrid.
[19:34.750 --> 19:37.870]  Yeah. And I mean, like, you were, you were, I guess, the
[19:37.870 --> 19:41.430]  first one to like, really explain to me how, you know, if
[19:41.430 --> 19:44.670]  you are going to be breeding with land race stuff that you
[19:44.670 --> 19:48.430]  want to pick something that is workable, you know, because
[19:48.710 --> 19:52.790]  where you're, you know, you want to start from a good place with
[19:52.790 --> 19:55.910]  your first cross. And so like, that's I appreciate how you were,
[19:56.230 --> 19:59.790]  you know, encouraging me to start in specific directions.
[20:00.270 --> 20:07.430]  Because it all depends on what your end results are, you know,
[20:07.430 --> 20:10.670]  because this is where you when you start breeding with new
[20:10.670 --> 20:13.910]  sativas and stuff, this is where you could really see what a male
[20:13.910 --> 20:18.110]  bring to the table from a sativa side, or if you're doing a
[20:18.110 --> 20:22.710]  hybrid where it's the opposite where you have indica male going
[20:22.710 --> 20:25.670]  on to a sativa. This is where you really see the difference.
[20:25.670 --> 20:28.910]  And this is where, you know, it helps me to really understand
[20:28.910 --> 20:37.670]  what, what is it that males contribute to, you know, and so
[20:37.670 --> 20:40.950]  that that's really important right there for me as far as
[20:41.230 --> 20:45.590]  where what direction am I going? If I'm going for if I'm going
[20:45.590 --> 20:49.550]  for some hybrids that I know is going to be grown indoor, they're
[20:49.550 --> 20:52.710]  going to be grown in California, and I need them to
[20:52.910 --> 20:56.990]  finish before the winter comes in, finish by late October,
[20:56.990 --> 21:04.510]  maybe early November, then I choosing a sativa or a land
[21:04.510 --> 21:09.190]  raised male, sativa male would not be your best option because
[21:09.190 --> 21:12.990]  that male brings flower time, it brings structure, it brings,
[21:13.270 --> 21:15.870]  you know, color, it brings a lot of different things to the
[21:15.870 --> 21:21.390]  progeny that that you might still have to take that and
[21:21.430 --> 21:24.670]  outcross it to make it appealing for someone to grow in their
[21:24.670 --> 21:27.950]  in their indoor facility. When if you're doing it in the
[21:27.950 --> 21:33.430]  opposite direction where you select a sativa female, and you
[21:33.430 --> 21:37.070]  have an indica male, you already know that indica male is going
[21:37.070 --> 21:40.590]  to bring shorter structure plant to the progeny, it's going to
[21:40.590 --> 21:45.390]  bring shorter flower time, it's going to bring all the stuff
[21:45.390 --> 21:50.630]  that you are looking after for an indoor situation or for a
[21:50.630 --> 21:54.270]  Northern California situation. So you know, I do them back and
[21:54.270 --> 21:58.590]  forth both ways because my intention is also to breed
[21:58.630 --> 22:03.030]  strains for the tropical region, and breeding hybrids for the
[22:03.030 --> 22:06.550]  tropical region, that's where I take the sativa males, because
[22:06.550 --> 22:10.110]  then I keep a kind of sativa structure a little bit earlier
[22:10.110 --> 22:14.910]  finishing flower to the edge, and I don't have kind of
[22:14.910 --> 22:17.310]  buds because you know, they kind of stay, the flowers stay
[22:17.310 --> 22:20.070]  is a little bit more loose, they could cope with the humidity
[22:20.070 --> 22:24.110]  from the tropics and stuff like that. So depending on where
[22:24.110 --> 22:27.750]  you're trying to go, if you're trying to make high land-based
[22:27.750 --> 22:33.670]  hybrids for Northern California or for the north of the equator
[22:33.670 --> 22:38.790]  and stuff like that, places that has four seasons, my advice is
[22:38.790 --> 22:42.870]  to use an indica male on to the sativa female. If you're doing
[22:42.910 --> 22:48.790]  it in the opposite direction, you know, and like for instance,
[22:49.750 --> 22:59.070]  the axis by Siskai, you know, that was a Siskai male. And you
[22:59.070 --> 23:04.350]  could see the, it's still not a wild, wild crazy sativa, but it's
[23:04.390 --> 23:08.630]  on the sativa side. Yep. You know, and then you could take
[23:08.630 --> 23:12.910]  the Hawaiians that I put a chem dog male on. And when you, you
[23:12.910 --> 23:15.390]  know, you look at those plants, you would think like, where's
[23:15.390 --> 23:20.230]  the sativa in them? It transformed them totally. You
[23:20.230 --> 23:25.310]  know what I mean? So the male really have a crazy influence on
[23:25.310 --> 23:28.870]  the direction you're trying to take when it comes to creating a
[23:29.070 --> 23:30.190]  land-based hybrid.
[23:31.710 --> 23:35.150]  Yeah, most definitely. And I mean, just from looking at your
[23:35.310 --> 23:38.150]  your work and the work that you shared with me and talked to me
[23:38.150 --> 23:42.190]  about and explain to me why you're using, you know, said
[23:42.190 --> 23:44.950]  genetics for this side of the other side, it was really
[23:44.950 --> 23:50.790]  eye-opening. It was really eye-opening for me, because it
[23:50.790 --> 23:58.030]  was just very matter of fact. And I mean, I'm, you know, like
[23:58.070 --> 24:01.510]  just how you were talking about, you know, using your chem crosses
[24:01.510 --> 24:05.510]  for, you know, getting good numbers, you know, getting high
[24:05.510 --> 24:09.590]  THC numbers, and then you would use a different male for, you
[24:09.590 --> 24:14.910]  know, a cis guy male for in the tropics. I thought that was, was
[24:14.910 --> 24:20.510]  really concise and clear. Because very often people,
[24:20.870 --> 24:25.990]  people's reasoning for using a specific male isn't as clear.
[24:27.030 --> 24:33.030]  And, you know, when I work with your genetics, you know, exactly
[24:33.030 --> 24:36.190]  like what you're saying, you know, like the crosses, the chem
[24:36.190 --> 24:41.750]  crosses, all were really dense. And, you know, nice big, nookie
[24:41.750 --> 24:53.070]  nugs, the cis guy crosses right here. More, not super dense, but
[24:53.070 --> 24:56.910]  it's not really loose. And I just wanted to address a
[24:56.910 --> 24:59.430]  question somebody said kind of like, you know, who cares if
[24:59.470 --> 25:03.150]  it's loose or dense? You know, when you grind it up, and I
[25:03.150 --> 25:06.110]  completely agree with that. But you know, the more when you grow
[25:06.310 --> 25:12.390]  more true sativas, they're really loose for a reason. And
[25:12.390 --> 25:16.510]  the reason why they're so loose is because of the humidity in
[25:16.510 --> 25:18.870]  the environment, the humidity when they're growing the
[25:18.870 --> 25:24.430]  humidity when the flower is cured. So I live in California,
[25:24.430 --> 25:30.070]  I've grown some, let's say 16 to 20 week varieties. And
[25:30.070 --> 25:34.510]  they're so loose that by the time they dry up and cure
[25:34.510 --> 25:39.990]  properly, it basically almost turns into like a powder. Like
[25:39.990 --> 25:43.510]  it doesn't preserve that well, because the bugs are so loose.
[25:43.790 --> 25:48.350]  And that also kind of makes sense why people in those
[25:48.350 --> 25:51.990]  places where they're grown, kind of like jumble it all together.
[25:51.990 --> 25:55.190]  And so it's kind of like smashed together into like, one
[25:55.190 --> 25:59.390]  big kind of ball because the pieces are so loose, that if you
[25:59.390 --> 26:01.870]  have them by themselves, they would kind of like flake off
[26:01.870 --> 26:06.430]  into nothing. So I just wanted to address that question
[26:06.430 --> 26:10.870]  regarding, you know, the density of bugs, because it is nice to
[26:10.870 --> 26:14.670]  have something that has some some sustainability to it.
[26:15.670 --> 26:21.510]  And I mean, for me, the reason I, you know, like I said, I'm
[26:22.950 --> 26:27.310]  in California as well. And, you know, when you're trying to make
[26:27.310 --> 26:33.030]  an attractive hybrid for for people to use out here, you have
[26:33.030 --> 26:37.910]  to make it as you know, you're kind of like, kind of give them
[26:37.910 --> 26:41.430]  some of the influences of the sativa in a hybrid, but at the
[26:41.430 --> 26:47.470]  same time, make it appealing to grow, make it, you know, have
[26:47.470 --> 26:52.110]  some little kind of bug appeal, or something that makes people
[26:52.110 --> 26:57.550]  attracted to it, you know. So a lot of people beat up on the
[26:57.590 --> 27:00.950]  loose sativas and stuff, which I have no problem with. But you
[27:00.950 --> 27:04.350]  know, I tend to kind of like kind of add a little attribution
[27:04.350 --> 27:07.150]  here and there to them to kind of make them a little bit nicer.
[27:07.510 --> 27:11.110]  So that, you know, they can work for some people, you don't want
[27:11.110 --> 27:13.630]  that people to have a bad experience, because most people
[27:13.630 --> 27:16.710]  think they want these sativas. But if I show them a pure siski,
[27:16.950 --> 27:18.870]  they're gonna be like, what is this swaggish?
[27:21.510 --> 27:27.910]  But keep that good energy that they have that clear up bright,
[27:27.910 --> 27:31.990]  high and kind of like, add a little things to them to make
[27:31.990 --> 27:34.390]  them more appealing, like shorter, the flowering time,
[27:34.550 --> 27:38.870]  tighten up the buds a little bit, you know, so those are
[27:39.590 --> 27:44.150]  my focus. I mean, I keep them in the original form as well,
[27:44.190 --> 27:47.110]  preserving them and keeping these stuck around because
[27:47.150 --> 27:51.030]  they're pretty unique in their original state as well. It's
[27:51.030 --> 27:55.670]  just that if you want them to beat the cold, beat the rain and
[27:55.670 --> 27:58.230]  all of that stuff, we got to add a little bit of different things
[27:58.230 --> 27:58.670]  to them.
[27:59.950 --> 28:00.550]  You know,
[28:02.350 --> 28:07.630]  yeah, your cross definitely beat the cold and beat the rain. I
[28:07.630 --> 28:11.710]  left out, you know, some some nubs for a couple extra months
[28:11.710 --> 28:16.270]  and they seem to do really well. I think they eventually rotted,
[28:16.470 --> 28:21.110]  but it was, yeah, it was a they weren't needed really well.
[28:21.710 --> 28:23.070]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[28:26.270 --> 28:29.390]  So I kind of wanted to unless there was anything I kind of
[28:29.390 --> 28:33.150]  wanted to move on to talking about the Hanalei.
[28:33.590 --> 28:40.110]  Yeah, the Hanalei reminds me of my past. Because, you know, I'm
[28:41.310 --> 28:44.910]  I'm from the Americas, and there were some sweet sativas in
[28:44.910 --> 28:48.110]  South, in South America and in Central America, there were
[28:48.110 --> 28:52.790]  some sweet sativas. And this one Hanalei based trail that a
[28:52.790 --> 28:59.470]  family of mine had gathered for me in Hawaii in 2012. And then,
[28:59.750 --> 29:04.630]  you know, he's a real, he's a real herb lover. He loves
[29:04.630 --> 29:06.990]  himself some herbs. So everywhere he goes, he brings
[29:06.990 --> 29:10.910]  seeds. And he brought these Hawaiian for me probably 10
[29:10.910 --> 29:16.430]  years ago. And then after about, after about six or seven, I mean
[29:16.430 --> 29:20.270]  them in the fridge, I decided let me open them up. And there
[29:20.270 --> 29:25.870]  were some of the sweetest. It's like for me, it's the perfect
[29:26.870 --> 29:31.870]  sativa. Yeah, that's the Hanalei. They're very
[29:31.870 --> 29:35.830]  interesting. I mean, I find pinos in there from, from some
[29:35.830 --> 29:45.110]  sweet kind of to ripe guava, a range of different herbs, but
[29:45.110 --> 29:48.270]  the plants, they're really interesting plants, really
[29:48.270 --> 29:53.510]  crystally. And it's one of those sativas that you have a lot of
[29:53.510 --> 29:58.270]  that in the house, you open it up, you leave for work, you come
[29:58.270 --> 30:05.550]  back. You're like, there's some, there's some of the Hanalei in
[30:05.550 --> 30:08.350]  this house somewhere, you could smell it in the air. It's one of
[30:08.350 --> 30:15.070]  those herbs that you know, you could smoke it in a certain area
[30:15.070 --> 30:17.870]  and go back over there and you could tell that that herb was
[30:17.870 --> 30:20.910]  running smoking there. So that's, that's the thing with
[30:20.910 --> 30:23.630]  the Hanalei, it's very interesting and it makes the
[30:23.630 --> 30:26.910]  nicest hybrids, man. It makes some of the nicest hybrids.
[30:26.910 --> 30:30.670]  Everything that I select, every time I select a female from
[30:30.670 --> 30:34.270]  those Hanalei and make hybrids with them, I've done them back
[30:34.270 --> 30:39.150]  and forth. I've made Hanalei's females, hybrids with the females
[30:39.150 --> 30:44.270]  and I've made Hanalei's hybrids with the males. And they're all
[30:44.270 --> 30:48.910]  interesting. The whole line does really well. And I've made
[30:48.910 --> 30:52.510]  the whole line does really well on either side, whether you're
[30:52.510 --> 30:56.350]  hybridizing the males or you're hybridizing the females. They
[30:56.350 --> 31:02.830]  work really well. And, and what I like about it is that it's
[31:02.830 --> 31:07.790]  one step removed from making something really nice that can
[31:07.790 --> 31:12.350]  adapt to the indoor situation. It's not that earthy,
[31:12.350 --> 31:17.310]  terpinaline. You know, it's more appealing, it's more fruity,
[31:17.550 --> 31:22.350]  more of those types of terps. And like just about one step
[31:22.350 --> 31:26.830]  removed, like every time I hybridize it with an Indica male,
[31:28.190 --> 31:33.230]  it creates this fragrance that you use really well and has some
[31:33.230 --> 31:40.030]  kind of maple syrup, or pungent with, yeah, with fruit and
[31:40.670 --> 31:42.750]  really interesting, really, really interesting. It's
[31:42.750 --> 31:45.710]  somebody nicer. I remember you asked me a question once,
[31:47.310 --> 31:55.630]  what does the Hanalei, what sativa reminds me of home? And
[31:56.270 --> 32:00.270]  the Hanalei is the one that does that. Is there anything
[32:00.270 --> 32:02.270]  specific you want me to talk about the Hanalei?
[32:02.270 --> 32:06.830]  I mean, I mean, what you were saying was, was, was spot on. I
[32:06.830 --> 32:11.150]  mean, I, like, I remember you told me like the leaves. So what
[32:11.150 --> 32:16.110]  I, what I observed was that you were like, you know, the leaves
[32:16.110 --> 32:19.630]  are going to get thin and from the clone, or from the seedling,
[32:19.630 --> 32:23.310]  the leaves were fairly fat. But as soon as I took the cutting,
[32:23.950 --> 32:29.950]  the leaves thinned out to like a nice sativa hybrid. And the
[32:29.950 --> 32:32.510]  other thing that you told me was like, you know, the stem rub is
[32:32.510 --> 32:36.750]  going to be exactly like what the buds will be. And, you know,
[32:36.830 --> 32:41.230]  pretty easily, I found a plant that, you know, really had this,
[32:41.870 --> 32:47.310]  like, to me, it smelled almost like a tropical fruit mixed with,
[32:49.070 --> 32:53.310]  with like, perfume and some island sweet skunk smell in
[32:53.310 --> 32:59.070]  there. And even like when you would like, rub the stem, it was
[32:59.070 --> 33:03.310]  like tacky and like sticky, just from rubbing the stem with the
[33:03.310 --> 33:07.870]  plants that were in veg. And, you know, once they, you know,
[33:07.870 --> 33:10.750]  rooted, the clones have rooted, they've really started to like
[33:10.750 --> 33:14.910]  take off have that nice sativa growth pattern, you know, like
[33:14.910 --> 33:20.510]  the fast growth and the nice sativa stretch. So yeah, I mean,
[33:20.510 --> 33:24.270]  I'm really excited to find the right male and, you know,
[33:24.270 --> 33:27.070]  looking through the females, basically, everything you said
[33:27.070 --> 33:31.630]  was was spot on with them. And shoot, like, I remember when I
[33:31.630 --> 33:34.510]  first met you, that's the bud that you gave me with some of
[33:34.510 --> 33:38.030]  that. And I remember, you know, smoking that and just being
[33:38.030 --> 33:45.070]  like, shit, like, this is potent. Yeah, it's really, yeah,
[33:45.070 --> 33:48.190]  you're gonna get the broom, you can't just sit down, you gotta
[33:48.190 --> 33:50.190]  get the broom, you're gonna get something, you're gonna start
[33:50.190 --> 33:53.710]  dancing, something's gotta happen. You can't just sit down
[33:53.710 --> 33:59.550]  on that one, it gets, gets you moving. And yeah, you were
[33:59.870 --> 34:02.830]  what you're saying is one of the most appealing things about it
[34:02.830 --> 34:08.110]  was that, you know, even in the veg state, you can do a stem
[34:08.110 --> 34:11.790]  rub. And you could be like, dang, what is that? You know,
[34:11.790 --> 34:15.310]  you're not just getting that hashy, woody, you know, you're
[34:15.310 --> 34:18.990]  actually getting some real fruit coming out of those stem
[34:18.990 --> 34:23.150]  rub, like, like literally, and that's, those are the plants
[34:23.150 --> 34:26.910]  that I like to breed with plants that if I could rub it in veg
[34:26.910 --> 34:29.950]  and it smells like the flower when it's in flowers, like, oh
[34:29.950 --> 34:33.790]  my god, these are amazing plants. And that's one of the
[34:34.510 --> 34:38.510]  great things about the Hanalei line is that, you know, you
[34:38.510 --> 34:42.110]  could do stem rubs and you could almost get what that flower is
[34:42.110 --> 34:47.950]  gonna smell like just from a stem rub. You know, yeah, I had,
[34:47.950 --> 34:52.830]  I gave out a few cuts of it in the past. And, you know, my
[34:52.830 --> 34:56.430]  friends, they hybridized it and then they never kept the
[34:56.430 --> 35:00.990]  clones. So, you know, I still keep clones from the original,
[35:02.510 --> 35:05.950]  the original, a couple of clones from the original B1
[35:05.950 --> 35:10.990]  generation. And yeah, we're keeping clones. So, you know, I
[35:10.990 --> 35:15.790]  got some clones 20 years old, 18 years old, Cheritai's about
[35:15.790 --> 35:23.230]  13 years old. My mango is about 17 years old, OG Kush, 19 years,
[35:23.310 --> 35:27.070]  Ercol, 19 years, you know, just holding on to those old cuts.
[35:27.070 --> 35:30.510]  I got my own little library going over the past, you know,
[35:30.510 --> 35:34.910]  and then I've added those Hanalei's to it. And I got two
[35:34.910 --> 35:38.910]  different phenotypes of the Hanalei that I breed with. The
[35:38.910 --> 35:42.030]  one that you had smoked when you first met me and then the
[35:42.030 --> 35:45.550]  ripe guava phenotype is the line that you're working with.
[35:45.550 --> 35:49.870]  So what do you, what do you think the, like, what does the
[35:49.870 --> 35:51.710]  Hanalei add to the progeny?
[35:51.710 --> 35:59.070]  Man, I, Hanalei chem, depending, depending on which
[35:59.070 --> 36:06.510]  Hanalei chem B1, Super Lemon Haze. There's some stuff that
[36:06.510 --> 36:10.350]  comes out of there that is just, it reminds me of Super Lemon
[36:10.350 --> 36:13.550]  Haze. Then there's some little more chem leaning one. It's
[36:13.550 --> 36:19.230]  just, yeah, those, those, those, those lines got some, some
[36:19.230 --> 36:22.270]  decent genetic coding and they're passing it on
[36:22.270 --> 36:26.030]  differently in different phenotypes of the, of the
[36:26.030 --> 36:30.990]  progeny. So really interesting.
[36:31.790 --> 36:37.870]  So like, like, do you find that you kind of have like some that
[36:37.870 --> 36:42.830]  are on, so let's say it was the chem male, it was the chem male
[36:42.830 --> 36:46.030]  onto the Hanalei. So you find that like, basically you have
[36:46.030 --> 36:49.070]  like two camps, like some that are a little bit more chem
[36:49.070 --> 36:51.390]  leaning and some that are a little bit more Hanalei leaning
[36:51.390 --> 36:52.510]  or they're kind of like.
[36:53.150 --> 36:57.710]  Yeah, you have some that are, and then you have these, you
[36:57.710 --> 37:03.230]  know, it seems like the Hanalei allows the males, the Hanalei
[37:03.230 --> 37:06.270]  female allows the males to kind of strike in the middle as
[37:06.270 --> 37:10.350]  opposed to just being all, you know, it's like when I breed a
[37:11.150 --> 37:16.430]  or I'm making a hybrid from other land races, the land
[37:16.430 --> 37:20.030]  races, they tend to go right over the head of most of these
[37:20.910 --> 37:26.910]  modern hybrids. But with the Hawaiian or with the Hanalei,
[37:26.910 --> 37:30.910]  it seems to allow things to strike more in the middle, as
[37:30.910 --> 37:34.190]  opposed to you having a progeny that all of this entire
[37:34.190 --> 37:37.150]  progeny is just Hawaiian dominant. It's just Hawaiian
[37:37.230 --> 37:40.590]  looking plants all across the board. No, the female kind of
[37:40.590 --> 37:46.430]  allows the male to have some level of influences in the
[37:46.430 --> 37:50.270]  progeny, like you would see, you know, you would find some
[37:50.270 --> 37:53.150]  that is pretty chem leaning and you find some that is really,
[37:54.030 --> 37:57.870]  really Hanalei leaning. And then there's this group that's
[37:57.870 --> 38:00.990]  just in the middle there that kind of like fuses together
[38:00.990 --> 38:05.710]  into all of these brown sugar, lemon and maple syrup and
[38:05.710 --> 38:10.430]  menthol and, you know, and very pungent and pronounced as
[38:10.430 --> 38:15.470]  well. So it's one of those things. I mean, I've made other
[38:15.470 --> 38:19.950]  sativa hybrids where, like I said, you know, we were talking
[38:19.950 --> 38:23.790]  earlier that the Siskai and a lot of the African stuff and
[38:23.790 --> 38:26.510]  like, especially the Durban, you could outcross, outcross,
[38:26.510 --> 38:29.310]  outcross and you could still find it, you know what I'm
[38:29.310 --> 38:33.310]  saying? And it's dominant in the progeny, majority of your
[38:33.310 --> 38:38.030]  plants, sometimes up to 90, 95% is showing Durban when you hit
[38:38.030 --> 38:40.830]  it with a Durban, you know, you're getting that terpenele,
[38:40.830 --> 38:45.790]  you're getting all of that, but the Hanalei kind of allows
[38:45.790 --> 38:48.670]  things to kind of express differently as opposed to be
[38:48.670 --> 38:53.790]  just land-based dominant across the board, you know, and that's
[38:53.790 --> 38:57.870]  what I like with breeding the Hanalei and why I do a lot of
[38:57.870 --> 39:00.590]  work with it is because it brings a lot of interesting
[39:00.670 --> 39:05.390]  things. But for the most part, you're going to find that
[39:05.390 --> 39:08.910]  there's some Hanalei influence as far as the terps goes, but
[39:08.910 --> 39:14.430]  it varies all across, you know, because in the P1, in the P1, I
[39:14.430 --> 39:20.430]  found guava, carrot, mango, all these different kind of great
[39:20.430 --> 39:23.230]  terpenes. So, you know, you could see that, you know,
[39:23.230 --> 39:26.510]  within the genetic code of these plants, there are these
[39:26.510 --> 39:30.510]  things stored inside, you know, when you hybridize them,
[39:31.070 --> 39:34.590]  you know, you get a little bit of different things fusing
[39:34.590 --> 39:36.910]  together in different directions, and it's pretty
[39:36.910 --> 39:37.230]  unique.
[39:40.390 --> 39:48.470]  Yeah, I mean, I'm super excited to run them this year, and
[39:50.310 --> 39:54.230]  yeah, I'm looking for, what I'm looking for is a male that
[39:54.230 --> 40:02.950]  will kind of stretch out all of the more Indica popular,
[40:02.950 --> 40:07.990]  popular cuts that I'm working with just to put like a popular
[40:07.990 --> 40:09.270]  cut on a bigger frame.
[40:09.830 --> 40:14.870]  Yeah, cut down the bench time and you know, with that, like I
[40:14.870 --> 40:18.630]  said, those Hanalei are one step removed from making some super
[40:18.630 --> 40:22.390]  indoor hybrid. And you know, one step removed, you take it and
[40:23.190 --> 40:28.710]  you hit it onto an Indica, then you have a nice balance of both
[40:28.710 --> 40:33.430]  with an Asativa structure that finish faster than normal within
[40:33.430 --> 40:36.470]  like 10 weeks. Most of the Hanalei hybrid that I made with
[40:36.470 --> 40:40.630]  the chem, they're finishing at about 9-10 weeks, maybe 11, you
[40:40.630 --> 40:43.750]  know, depending on the phenome. But you know, you'll find that
[40:45.030 --> 40:50.390]  a lot of those things is what happens when you hybridize
[40:51.110 --> 40:53.830]  it changes a lot of those attributes.
[40:54.870 --> 40:59.590]  For sure. Super interesting. Super interesting.
[41:03.190 --> 41:06.470]  Do you want to keep on talking about Hanalei? I'd love to move
[41:06.470 --> 41:07.590]  on if you're if you're ready.
[41:12.710 --> 41:14.950]  Yeah, I want to talk about the purple unicorn.
[41:15.910 --> 41:19.430]  Purple unicorn? Yeah, I want to talk about the purple unicorn
[41:19.430 --> 41:23.830]  male just to, I guess, I'll just to give everybody a little
[41:23.830 --> 41:27.990]  background. Grasshopper has been working with the purple unicorn
[41:27.990 --> 41:34.470]  male. I've done the I've been testing some purple unicorn by
[41:34.470 --> 41:41.190]  Hanalei plants. And my thinking was, I wanted to just to look
[41:41.190 --> 41:45.350]  for the Hanalei leaning phenos. Purple unicorn is famous for
[41:45.350 --> 41:51.670]  breeding truly purple. So all of the solid purple plants, so
[41:51.670 --> 41:54.870]  these plants are all being grown outdoors currently, all the
[41:54.870 --> 41:59.350]  super purple plants I culled. The most purple ones were
[41:59.350 --> 42:01.190]  actually the males, it was really interesting to see a
[42:01.190 --> 42:05.350]  bunch of males that were like solid purple, like from stem,
[42:05.990 --> 42:09.430]  all the leaf, everything solid purple, culled all of those. So
[42:09.430 --> 42:12.630]  I had all the green ones, figured those would be all the
[42:12.630 --> 42:16.790]  Hanalei leaning ones. As the Hanalei leaning ones began to
[42:16.790 --> 42:20.710]  flower, I noticed that all of them have purple coming from the
[42:20.710 --> 42:26.230]  buds. So essentially, what it appears that all of these
[42:26.230 --> 42:31.350]  phenos are express purple, at least when it's cold. It's just
[42:31.350 --> 42:36.710]  if it is it extremely dark purple, or is it a purple bud?
[42:36.870 --> 42:41.830]  So yeah, I'm extremely intrigued by the purple unicorn crosses. I
[42:41.830 --> 42:45.910]  think even like the purple you hit to like the runs could be a
[42:45.910 --> 42:51.670]  pretty interesting one. But yeah, that purple unicorn male.
[42:54.230 --> 42:58.310]  Yeah, got it. Yeah, the purple unicorn, actually, you know,
[42:58.310 --> 43:03.350]  the purple unicorn is Bodhi, you know, and it's a homozygote
[43:03.510 --> 43:07.350]  and it's homozygous for that purple trait. I mean, he locked
[43:07.350 --> 43:11.270]  that in really good. And it's a purple unicorn F5, you know,
[43:11.270 --> 43:16.470]  that I got from one of my employees one day. And I
[43:16.470 --> 43:19.190]  recommended it to him and he got it. And I told him like,
[43:19.190 --> 43:23.430]  you know, select a couple males out there for me. He brought me
[43:23.430 --> 43:28.550]  a couple and then I chose one. And I, you know, it's a really
[43:28.550 --> 43:31.590]  interesting male. I've never seen a male that from the get
[43:31.670 --> 43:36.230]  go just, you know, it's all purple, purple male flowers,
[43:36.230 --> 43:39.110]  purple. The only thing that is not purple that comes out of
[43:39.110 --> 43:42.710]  there is the pollen. But everything else is purple, the
[43:42.710 --> 43:48.790]  entire plant. So I went ahead and did that last summer with,
[43:50.550 --> 43:55.590]  I had put some Florida OG, some of the purple unicorn on the
[43:55.590 --> 44:01.910]  Florida OG, I put it on some Urkels, Cherry Pie, Purple
[44:01.910 --> 44:07.030]  Unicorn Brunch, Purple Unicorn Jealousy. I don't know, a whole
[44:07.030 --> 44:09.990]  bunch of other stuff, some stuff that I made that was called
[44:09.990 --> 44:14.470]  One Dime, Gelato 41 by Kim Dime, put some of that on there as
[44:14.470 --> 44:22.310]  well. Some Hanalei's. The Hanalei actually, you know, not
[44:22.310 --> 44:25.670]  to get off the purple unicorn topic, but the Hanalei actually
[44:25.670 --> 44:29.350]  colors up too at the end. You know, get purple and, you know,
[44:30.950 --> 44:33.990]  yeah, but not to get off the purple unicorn. But I think the
[44:33.990 --> 44:36.310]  purple unicorn is going to be an interesting one. I got a
[44:36.310 --> 44:40.710]  purple unicorn. I'm actually testing those myself right now.
[44:40.710 --> 44:45.830]  Purple Unicorn by Cherry Pie. I got like 15 of those going.
[44:45.830 --> 44:52.070]  Purple Unicorn by Urkel. Purple Unicorn Corn by Larry's
[44:52.070 --> 44:59.750]  Bread, which is, you know, Mendel Perks OGKB and Gelato 33
[44:59.750 --> 45:04.710]  by Purple Unicorn. Those plants are amazing. I mean, so far from
[45:04.710 --> 45:09.270]  what I'm seeing, really amazing plants. Everything should color
[45:09.270 --> 45:16.550]  up really well. And thanks to Bodhi for, you know, locking that
[45:16.550 --> 45:21.430]  trait in the way he did. It was an amazing, I think it was a
[45:21.430 --> 45:25.590]  good choice for me as far as trying to make a Urkel or put
[45:25.590 --> 45:29.190]  it onto a Urkel and, you know, even onto the Cherry Pie. You
[45:29.190 --> 45:32.070]  know, the Cherry Pie that I have is pretty unique. It gets more
[45:32.070 --> 45:35.750]  colorful than the Urkel. You know, it's made from the Urkel.
[45:36.310 --> 45:39.510]  But yeah, and the Cherry Pie that I have is a little bit
[45:39.510 --> 45:43.430]  different than most people have been working with. I see Cherry
[45:43.430 --> 45:47.910]  Pie out there and what is that? But yeah.
[45:48.390 --> 45:49.990]  Do you want to elaborate on your Cherry Pie?
[45:53.030 --> 45:59.350]  2008, I had a friend in San Francisco and there were three
[45:59.350 --> 46:03.990]  different phenos of Cherry Pie circulating. And he gave me
[46:03.990 --> 46:09.190]  cuts of the three phenos. I lived in San Francisco for a
[46:09.190 --> 46:11.910]  long time. I worked for a lot of those dispensers there. So I
[46:11.910 --> 46:14.550]  had a lot of cool people and cool friends and I was kind of
[46:14.550 --> 46:19.990]  connected over that side. 2008, 2009, he gave me three
[46:19.990 --> 46:24.630]  phenos and I grew them all out and for a couple times and
[46:24.630 --> 46:29.510]  then selected the one I loved the most, which is, it was a
[46:29.510 --> 46:32.710]  little bit shorter plant, a little bit looser bud, but
[46:32.710 --> 46:37.670]  colored up really good. And, you know, finishes really early.
[46:37.670 --> 46:43.110]  You know, seven weeks, candy, terp, like crazy. You leave it
[46:43.110 --> 46:46.710]  to go longer, eight, into eight and over eight weeks, then it
[46:46.710 --> 46:50.150]  started getting deeper, dark, varnished, licoricey, more
[46:50.710 --> 46:57.830]  black, you know. I've seen, and the Cherry Pie, the reason I
[46:57.830 --> 47:00.790]  kept it around is because I remember crossing it into New
[47:00.790 --> 47:07.990]  York City Diesel and did some sour BX on it and man, it's a
[47:07.990 --> 47:12.550]  breed so true for Cherry, dominant across the board. So,
[47:12.630 --> 47:15.990]  you know, that's one reason I keep the pie around for so
[47:15.990 --> 47:18.630]  long. If I want Cherry, it's like, you're going to get it
[47:18.630 --> 47:21.830]  out of that. It's no, it's what made it, it doesn't matter what
[47:21.830 --> 47:24.710]  you put on it. You know, I mean, I just, you look at the
[47:24.710 --> 47:29.030]  Cherry Dogs, I mean, where's the chem in it? You know, the
[47:29.030 --> 47:32.950]  whole progeny just colors up and get, become strong and just
[47:33.990 --> 47:39.030]  has Cherry Terps with very little chem and, you know.
[47:39.510 --> 47:43.830]  Were all of those plants Cherry growers or were they a little
[47:43.830 --> 47:44.310]  bit bigger?
[47:45.030 --> 47:46.310]  Which one is that?
[47:46.310 --> 47:47.350]  The Cherry Dog.
[47:48.310 --> 47:51.750]  The Cherry Dog? Well, I mean, some of them stayed smaller,
[47:51.750 --> 47:55.030]  you know, the Cherry Pie has Urkel in it and it's like, I'm
[47:55.030 --> 47:58.390]  sure it's an F1. So, you know, every time, every once in a
[47:58.390 --> 48:01.670]  while, maybe, you know, I don't know, about 10% of the
[48:01.670 --> 48:04.310]  progeny, you're going to find small aquatic plants that are
[48:04.310 --> 48:09.110]  more Urkel leaning, you know, and then, you know, those plants
[48:09.110 --> 48:12.070]  are interesting as well, but I, you know, if I get those
[48:12.070 --> 48:15.910]  plants, if I use those plants, it just takes me an extra step
[48:15.910 --> 48:18.550]  because I'm trying to breed something that grows and veg
[48:18.550 --> 48:24.470]  well and stuff like that. So, I tend to use the little more
[48:24.470 --> 48:26.230]  chem structure plant.
[48:28.230 --> 48:32.310]  Okay, but even the bigger chem structured plants still, the
[48:32.310 --> 48:33.750]  buds come out Cherry Pie.
[48:34.390 --> 48:37.830]  Cherry all across the board and those are even more unique
[48:37.830 --> 48:43.750]  because those have like a kind of candy pink kind of wedding
[48:43.750 --> 48:47.670]  cake kind of something like that, very creamy and pink
[48:47.670 --> 48:53.030]  bubblegummy kind of and it's very unique the way how the
[48:53.030 --> 48:56.870]  smoke hit the palette of the Cherry Pie crosses and stuff.
[48:56.870 --> 48:59.910]  It's a very, very unique one. I've never found anything and
[48:59.910 --> 49:03.750]  it's just like the Cherry Pie, you could, you could touch the
[49:03.750 --> 49:06.550]  trichromes on it and it melts like right away and turns into
[49:06.550 --> 49:09.430]  this oil on your finger and I think that's one of the reasons
[49:09.430 --> 49:13.430]  for the way that the Cherry Pie smoke and the Cherry Pie
[49:13.430 --> 49:19.350]  hybrid, they also have that soft powdery kind of like white
[49:19.350 --> 49:25.430]  cloudy, nice mouth coating, but not very heavy and sharp type
[49:25.430 --> 49:32.470]  smoke. I recall from the Cherry Pie that it was, it hit very
[49:32.470 --> 49:35.910]  quickly and was potent to like where like we couldn't even
[49:35.910 --> 49:38.710]  like, you know, we didn't even finish our half joints. We just
[49:38.710 --> 49:41.750]  kind of like, I like forgot about my joint. But the chem
[49:41.750 --> 49:45.670]  brought to it because, chem brought that to it because the
[49:45.670 --> 49:48.150]  Cherry Pie only tests normal. I can't get it more than like
[49:48.150 --> 49:53.190]  18, 19% of the morning, you know, 18% and it's usually
[49:53.190 --> 49:58.150]  Cherry Pie by itself. It's a light kind of delayed mild over
[49:58.150 --> 50:01.590]  it, you know, it's very functional, it's very tasty,
[50:01.670 --> 50:03.830]  it's kind of lighter, but you know, hitting the chem
[50:03.830 --> 50:05.910]  dogs on it, yeah, I'm sure it's up in the 20s.
[50:07.430 --> 50:11.430]  Nice, very nice. Are there any other interesting projects you'd
[50:11.430 --> 50:13.190]  like to share with us that you're working on right now?
[50:13.830 --> 50:21.510]  Oh man, right now I'm doing an Urkel back cross, Purple Unicorn
[50:21.510 --> 50:29.910]  Urkel back into Urkel. And then Purple Unicorn back into Urkel
[50:29.910 --> 50:39.030]  and then also I am doing a repopulation of the Agobe. I
[50:39.030 --> 50:46.630]  only had like 100 seeds of those Agobe there, 1987. I got,
[50:46.630 --> 50:49.510]  yeah, I have my friends that had that in 1987, didn't know
[50:49.510 --> 50:53.910]  they have it. Popped it a few years ago and two of the seeds
[50:53.910 --> 50:57.190]  grew out of it and, you know, they end up cloning him who was
[50:57.190 --> 51:01.110]  a male and a female and repopulated it and it's one of
[51:01.110 --> 51:04.790]  the nicer plants that I've ever grew when it comes to Indica.
[51:04.790 --> 51:08.710]  I mean, I've done a lot of Afgani and Mazari and I was like,
[51:08.710 --> 51:12.230]  oh, this is not where I'm trying to be. But dealing with
[51:12.230 --> 51:16.070]  the Agobe and working with the Agobe, I've been an interesting
[51:16.070 --> 51:21.510]  one. So I'm doing Florida OG, I'm putting that on, I'm putting
[51:21.510 --> 51:24.950]  some Agobe on that and selecting. I've grown, I've
[51:25.030 --> 51:29.030]  grew the Agobe for a period of time. I would pop 10 seeds here
[51:29.030 --> 51:31.510]  and there just to kind of like get an understanding of the
[51:31.510 --> 51:36.390]  progeny and what's in there. And now that I saw what's in the
[51:36.390 --> 51:40.310]  progeny, then I went back and popped some more seeds and then
[51:40.310 --> 51:43.190]  now I know what I'm looking for as far as a male goes.
[51:43.190 --> 51:46.950]  And where exactly is the Agobe Desert?
[51:49.270 --> 51:53.350]  The Agobe Desert is, you know, it's China. It's like, it's a
[51:53.350 --> 51:58.150]  space between China and the Himalayas and India and that
[51:58.150 --> 52:01.270]  whole era right there with, you know, the steps. People talk
[52:01.270 --> 52:04.230]  about the steps. People talk about the Silk Route, the Silk
[52:04.230 --> 52:09.590]  Road, all of these type of things. The Agobe Desert had a
[52:09.590 --> 52:12.870]  few cities. The Silk Road passed through the Agobe Desert
[52:13.510 --> 52:16.310]  and there was a few cities around there like Turpan and
[52:16.310 --> 52:18.790]  different cities around there that people would trade and,
[52:19.430 --> 52:23.670]  you know, and also there's a documentary out on, you know,
[52:23.670 --> 52:29.270]  some of the oldest herbs found in a tomb with some guy in his
[52:29.270 --> 52:32.790]  tomb in the Agobe Desert and it was well preserved. And, you
[52:32.790 --> 52:37.670]  know, so it's one of the older regions for that type of
[52:37.670 --> 52:39.030]  cannabis, you know.
[52:41.030 --> 52:44.790]  Is there anything that you could compare the Agobe to that
[52:44.790 --> 52:47.430]  you, that like maybe people have smoked?
[52:47.670 --> 52:52.550]  Man, it's, it's, how do I compare it to?
[52:55.030 --> 52:59.670]  I would say it's an Afghani type plant. You know, the Agobe
[52:59.670 --> 53:05.430]  and those places is more north of Afghani. But because of the
[53:05.430 --> 53:11.590]  way it flowers early, you know what I mean, we put it in in
[53:11.590 --> 53:15.750]  April and we get huge three, four pound plant in Tartan seed
[53:16.550 --> 53:20.470]  in April, late April and it finishes the end of September,
[53:21.270 --> 53:24.870]  you know, and it does well in the cold nights and it's, you
[53:24.870 --> 53:29.190]  know, even indoors, it's one of the faster onset than anything
[53:29.190 --> 53:32.470]  else I've worked with over here. I mean, it goes into
[53:32.470 --> 53:37.350]  flowering, it goes in and goes in fast and hard, you know. So
[53:37.350 --> 53:41.350]  for me, it's, you know, I think it's a better line than most of
[53:41.430 --> 53:47.190]  the Afghanis that I've worked with. The Tartan is more from
[53:47.190 --> 53:51.670]  like sulfur, acrid. I don't even know how to explain those
[53:51.670 --> 53:57.190]  things, but pretty unique plant. Very crystalline and yeah,
[53:57.190 --> 53:58.470]  all, all, all stuff.
[53:59.510 --> 54:02.710]  Do you know this person down here, Jamal? This person that's
[54:02.710 --> 54:05.590]  popped up down here at the bottom? Are you expecting them?
[54:05.590 --> 54:07.030]  Sorry to interrupt you, Grasshopper.
[54:07.670 --> 54:11.990]  I can't see that there is one other person, Sankofa. Yeah.
[54:11.990 --> 54:14.790]  Okay. So I wanted to check before I put them on because you
[54:14.790 --> 54:20.790]  never know. Welcome Sankofa. Oh, he's not there anymore. That's
[54:20.790 --> 54:21.510]  it. Okay.
[54:21.510 --> 54:30.550]  Yeah. Yeah. I think he'll jump in in a second. I was curious,
[54:31.110 --> 54:35.750]  Elka, you said that there was, I mean, I saw maybe that there
[54:35.750 --> 54:39.270]  were a few questions in the, in the comments.
[54:39.270 --> 54:42.310]  Yes. One of them is from Cheddar Bob. He's asked this one
[54:42.310 --> 54:45.830]  several times. Does, does Grasshopper or yourself know
[54:45.830 --> 54:49.190]  anything about Tibetan land race because of like the origins
[54:49.190 --> 54:51.590]  of cannabis and everything they say that it was from that
[54:51.590 --> 54:55.910]  plateau and everything. So I was wondering if either of you all
[54:55.910 --> 55:01.190]  know about any of that type of thing, since you're kind of all
[55:01.190 --> 55:03.750]  over the place, you're talking about South Africa and it's a
[55:04.710 --> 55:05.910]  very interesting conversation.
[55:06.790 --> 55:11.590]  For me, for me, it's, I don't know much about that region,
[55:11.590 --> 55:14.550]  but it seems like from the documents and from the research
[55:14.550 --> 55:18.310]  that I've done, it seems like it's one of the, one of the
[55:18.310 --> 55:22.390]  areas that has the earliest documentation of the plant
[55:22.390 --> 55:28.790]  itself. As much as I can say, you know, as far as, you know,
[55:28.790 --> 55:31.670]  the history is there for it. It's one of the older, some of
[55:31.670 --> 55:34.710]  the oldest documents we could find on cannabis is in that
[55:34.710 --> 55:40.710]  area. You know, as much as I can really say on it, I don't
[55:40.710 --> 55:44.150]  really know much about it. I've grown a couple of strings from
[55:44.150 --> 55:49.030]  that area. And yeah, Cheddar Bob.
[55:51.430 --> 55:55.670]  Yeah. I'd like to welcome Sankofa to our conversation.
[55:57.670 --> 55:58.630]  Oh, we just lost him.
[55:59.590 --> 56:01.350]  Of course, that's how it always goes.
[56:03.350 --> 56:06.870]  It's part of these live streams. So I'm looking for questions
[56:06.870 --> 56:08.870]  over here. I'll interrupt again when I find it.
[56:09.830 --> 56:13.510]  Yeah. I mean, I've, I've grown. So the first land race that I
[56:13.510 --> 56:18.870]  grew was from Indian land race exchange, big up those guys. And
[56:18.870 --> 56:26.230]  it was the Wailing Valley and that's from India. So I guess
[56:26.390 --> 56:29.830]  that's probably the closest to Tibet that I've anything that
[56:29.830 --> 56:34.390]  I've ever grown. My experience with the Wailing Valley was
[56:34.390 --> 56:40.310]  that it was one very difficult to sprout the seeds, extremely
[56:40.310 --> 56:43.430]  difficult. So, I mean, I don't know, I guess I'll go on a
[56:43.430 --> 56:48.230]  little tangent for people who do want to sprout land race or
[56:48.230 --> 56:51.750]  wild genetics. The one thing I would really recommend is to
[56:51.750 --> 56:56.390]  get a seed cracker because the wild seeds have a much, often
[56:56.390 --> 57:01.110]  have a much tougher shell than the more domesticated stuff. I
[57:01.110 --> 57:04.550]  had to have a couple shipments of the seeds sent to me because,
[57:04.550 --> 57:06.710]  because they wouldn't pop. And I think they would have popped if
[57:06.710 --> 57:10.470]  I would have cracked them. Another thing that I noticed was
[57:10.470 --> 57:15.270]  that the plants very quickly acclimatized to my environment.
[57:15.830 --> 57:21.750]  Perhaps I was selecting incorrectly, but the plants
[57:21.750 --> 57:27.670]  definitely after the second or third generation had turned into
[57:27.670 --> 57:32.070]  something that was pretty different from what I had first
[57:32.070 --> 57:40.310]  popped. And it wasn't really what I was looking for. That
[57:40.310 --> 57:44.070]  being said, the structure was on point. The powder mildew
[57:44.070 --> 57:48.550]  resistance was on point. The plants did not need that much
[57:48.550 --> 57:53.270]  water, which was really huge. And what I noticed was that the
[57:53.270 --> 57:59.110]  Wailing Valley males were quite passive with their breeding. So
[57:59.110 --> 58:01.750]  when you would breed with them, you would usually get whatever
[58:02.310 --> 58:08.470]  the female was. So that's as close as I've grown to anything
[58:08.870 --> 58:11.830]  from the Tibetan region was an Indian.
[58:11.830 --> 58:16.150]  Yeah, that's true. A lot of folks that think they want them
[58:16.150 --> 58:18.550]  until they get them and then they understand, it's like,
[58:18.550 --> 58:23.750]  whoa, this is not what I expected.
[58:24.790 --> 58:30.550]  And you know, they're also not, they're not evolved to grow in
[58:30.550 --> 58:35.510]  these environments very often. These plants have evolved to grow
[58:35.590 --> 58:40.630]  into specific environments. And when you bring a plant that's,
[58:41.750 --> 58:45.670]  what is it, longitudinally different from where you're
[58:45.670 --> 58:48.790]  growing it outdoors, it's different. It has a different
[58:48.790 --> 58:54.310]  humidity level, has just different pests and pathogens.
[58:58.230 --> 59:00.950]  Even the spectrum of the light that you get over here is
[59:00.950 --> 59:02.070]  different than the equator.
[59:02.230 --> 59:08.550]  Yeah, most definitely. I mean, that was kind of like when you
[59:08.550 --> 59:13.590]  were explaining these genetics that were from South Africa and
[59:13.590 --> 59:17.190]  then explaining how far South Africa was from the equator,
[59:17.190 --> 59:23.510]  then it starts to make more sense why these strains do do
[59:23.510 --> 59:28.230]  better over, do do well over here. And they are a little bit
[59:28.230 --> 59:31.990]  more workable than the stuff that is closer to the equator,
[59:32.790 --> 59:34.150]  where they can be more workable.
[59:36.310 --> 59:38.950]  Well, man, I really wish that we could get St. Kofa on. He,
[59:39.510 --> 59:42.470]  you know, I love his feed. It's super interesting. I wonder what
[59:42.470 --> 59:43.030]  happened with him.
[59:43.590 --> 59:47.830]  Uncle Kofa is my virgin. You know, he worked with a lot of my
[59:47.830 --> 59:51.110]  lines and stuff. He's a cool guy.
[59:51.830 --> 59:54.870]  You know anything about the Columbian? I heard a lot about
[59:54.870 --> 59:57.670]  that Columbian from my mentors. That's what they were searching
[59:57.670 --> 01:00:00.870]  for in Neville's hazes is that old Columbian that they used to
[01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:04.710]  get before. I also heard that that Columbian was grown
[01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:08.310]  perennially, like they would just top chop the top off of it
[01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:11.750]  and let it kind of regrow and revege. And that's how it was so
[01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:15.030]  consistently good for a while and made that gold. That's in
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.430]  one of the old high times that I have is them talking about
[01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:18.230]  that guy.
[01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.950]  Actually, I can speak on that from my personal experience.
[01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:29.750]  This year I grew a Burmese and it is still alive now. So that
[01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.950]  plant has been outside throughout the whole winter. I
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.230]  think if I had it in the greenhouse, it would do be doing
[01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.230]  better, but it's still flowering. It's still growing.
[01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:43.190]  It's still growing. It's still growing. It's still growing.
[01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:48.230]  It would do be doing better, but it's still flowering. It
[01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:52.790]  started flowering, I think in October or November or so.
[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:58.870]  So yeah, I mean, I guess in May, so two more months from now,
[01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:01.990]  if I can keep it alive, it will start reveging. And I guess
[01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.310]  that would be considered a perennial cannabis plant. I
[01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:09.030]  honestly didn't believe that those existed, but you know, I
[01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:11.910]  guess with those extreme sativas, you know, they just
[01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.710]  keep flowering. And to me, the most interesting part was like,
[01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:19.190]  if you have an indica plant or let's say like a common hybrid,
[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:22.950]  you put it outside, it starts flowering. It's pretty much
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:27.190]  finished. If you let it go after a certain point, it just
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:30.870]  kind of starts to like rot and like die and just kind of like
[01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:34.550]  cannibalize itself. But for some reason with these extreme
[01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:38.630]  sativas, it doesn't do that. They just keep flowering. They
[01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:42.470]  just keep, keep flowering. Do you have any experience with
[01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.830]  that grasshopper? Have you noticed that?
[01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:50.070]  Man, I know them to be annuals. I have no experience with trying
[01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:55.190]  to make them into perennials. But you know, my experience as
[01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:00.470]  far as Colombian goes, I used to float up on the beach and
[01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:05.910]  fish on kegs, you know, with everything else that comes from
[01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:10.070]  Colombia, you know. You know, you would wake up in the
[01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.870]  morning and go to the beach and you would think like
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:18.310]  asparagnum or some kind of sea moss or something on the beach
[01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:23.270]  is all kind of it. Like the beach is laden with it as far
[01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.710]  as your eyes can see. You would think that it's seagrass or
[01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:30.470]  something. And then every now and then you would find like
[01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:34.230]  one of those packages that didn't really get torn up, tore
[01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:37.430]  up by the reeds or something. And then we would get some
[01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:41.590]  seeds out of those. And then we would grow those. And those
[01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:49.190]  were amazing, really great plants. Very sativa. The
[01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:53.750]  Colombians, because Colombia sits more in the equator, kind
[01:02:53.750 --> 01:03:00.470]  of tends to be longer flowering plants. And as far as them,
[01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:09.830]  you know, being a perennial is, I'm not sure after, say for
[01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:13.430]  instance, harvest your bud, how long the vegging your plant is
[01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:16.390]  going to do. Because on the equator, you know, the
[01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:20.470]  photo-periodism and the time losses is about two to ten
[01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:23.510]  minutes depending on where you're at. And then you come up
[01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:26.470]  into Central America, you're looking at two hours, Mexico
[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.910]  three hours, the United States, you know, you're looking at
[01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:34.870]  the United States on the point at this huge swing of daylight
[01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:42.390]  period. Where down there, I'm not sure that would be, I mean,
[01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:46.950]  it's not common practice. It's really not common practice. So
[01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:50.230]  I wasn't, I wouldn't see it being very lucrative if it's not
[01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:53.750]  a common practice. You know, why is it these farmers in
[01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:57.270]  Colombia, Central America and South America, they, you know,
[01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:02.230]  they sow seeds every year during the rainy season, you
[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:07.030]  know, and then harvest in the dry season. As far as the clock
[01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:10.630]  swinging back like it does over here, like if you harvest a
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:14.710]  plant in the late fall and then you kind of, we go down to
[01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:19.510]  about ten hours of daylight and that plant stays into veg, you
[01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:23.590]  know. And then when you get back into spring, May, April, May,
[01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:26.630]  then you jump above 14 hours and then that plant start to
[01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:34.150]  re-veg again. So that's usually the issues with the plants that
[01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.350]  are down there, the photoperiodism and the amount of
[01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:41.110]  light that they need to trigger into flower is different than
[01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.590]  as soon as you start moving away from the equator, it gets
[01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:47.030]  different as far as the amount of light that they need to go
[01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:51.990]  into flower. Yes, yes. That's exactly what they were
[01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:55.830]  describing is that they had, this was done in Colombia and
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.310]  it seemed like that they were doing it for consistency
[01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:02.150]  purposes. So they didn't have to keep going through and picking
[01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:05.830]  out through seeds like removing males and it was kind of like a
[01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.790]  laziness kind of thing. After you've been doing it for so many
[01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.150]  years, farmers kind of find ways to cut corners. I could see
[01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.950]  what you're saying about how it's probably not the best
[01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:18.870]  practice, but you know, I've never lived near the equator
[01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.790]  like that. So who knows how well that would, you seem like
[01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:25.750]  you're a lot closer to that kind of thing than I'll ever be.
[01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.950]  So that's really cool hearing your perspective on that old
[01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:32.630]  article they were talking about. So, yeah. I mean, from my
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:36.310]  experience with the natives, the natives, like, you know,
[01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.710]  you know, nobody really talks about the Maya people and their
[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:44.790]  history with cannabis, but it's deep, you know, all of these
[01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:49.990]  Maya folks and most of the native folks throughout the
[01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:53.590]  whole world kind of use the plant. I mean, you look at the
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:56.070]  Hadza people in Africa right now, they're still living off
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:59.510]  the land, still, you know, hunter-gatherers and finding
[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.630]  wild cannabis and they gather and smoke because it makes
[01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:05.910]  their whole hunting skills sharpen and all this stuff. So,
[01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.830]  you know, and like the Maya folks, you know, and a lot of
[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:15.670]  the native people, I mean, that's where my first, you know,
[01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:18.630]  introduction to the whole plant came about was through the
[01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:22.150]  natives. I mean, you know, those were the people who seemed to
[01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.910]  had it around, all the people who came and who were brought
[01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.990]  didn't bring shit with them, but you know what I'm saying?
[01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.590]  They didn't have a lot of corn and tomatoes, but, you know,
[01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.230]  most of the plants, you know, it seems like it's the native
[01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:41.670]  people that really held on to it. And, you know, from, you
[01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:46.230]  know, they would go in, go into the jungle, cut what we
[01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:51.910]  refer to as an acre and then let it dry. You go back and
[01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:56.870]  you burn it, light it on fire before the rain and burn it.
[01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.910]  And after it burns and then the rain comes down and then the
[01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:03.830]  next year, at the beginning of the next rainy season, that's
[01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:07.590]  when you go back over there with a bag full of seeds, maybe
[01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:13.270]  a half a seed in a bag and a stick and you just walk in one
[01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:17.430]  step, put a hole, poke a hole in the ground, drop three seeds
[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:20.390]  and you walk an entire line across and across and across
[01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.270]  that acre. And when it starts raining, that shit starts
[01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:28.150]  coming up like, you know, the whole ground is just this lime
[01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:33.190]  green cover with all the inclusive plants. And the rainy
[01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:36.470]  season kind of beat down some, the strong ones survive. And
[01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:40.950]  after that, you know, you're going through and selecting
[01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:44.390]  males, pulling out all your males, pulling out your males
[01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:50.070]  as they're growing into flower. And, you know, by the time the
[01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.870]  middle of flower is coming around, it's coming into the
[01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:55.670]  dry season. So that's when you got to start hauling water from
[01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:59.670]  the river on your head all day from sunrise to sunset, just
[01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:03.750]  hauling water, hauling water. So that's been kind of my
[01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.070]  experience. And then it would be a harvest and you would do
[01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.110]  that twice a year because, you know, down there, it's not a
[01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.430]  autumn and fall and winter and spring. It's, you know, it's
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:17.110]  wet and dry, you know, and you have too wet and too dry for
[01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:21.430]  the year. So, you know, you're planting every wet and you're
[01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.870]  harvesting the dry. And the better ones is usually the ones
[01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:31.110]  you plant in June, July and harvesting what we call
[01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:32.630]  Christmas buds.
[01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:39.350]  So you had told me your story before and I found it super
[01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:47.030]  fascinating. My question was like, was the way that, in like
[01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:50.470]  the Caribbean or, you know, tropics where you're from, do
[01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:55.510]  people grow cannabis and their regular vegetables in the same
[01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:58.390]  fashion or is this more specific just to cannabis?
[01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:03.270]  No, we are in the same way for vegetables. I mean, most people
[01:09:03.270 --> 01:09:07.990]  have their little garden and stuff and, you know, it is kind
[01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:11.590]  of grown the same way, you know, it's kind of let nature take
[01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:12.070]  its course.
[01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:17.590]  So there's two seasons as well for like your other vegetables
[01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:18.470]  that you'd be planting.
[01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:25.350]  With those places, it's, you know, people are not all hooked
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.830]  on the well and where they are, but, you know, these things
[01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:32.470]  cost money. Well and pumps and generators, the hot water across
[01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:36.150]  a few acres is just not there. So people kind of go with
[01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:39.750]  nature, you know, this is the time for planting because now,
[01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:43.510]  you know, the heavens is showering the earth. So here we
[01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:47.590]  go, planting season. You know what I mean? If you, you know,
[01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:50.710]  all year around you can plant, but you got to have water, you
[01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:54.230]  know, so, you know, we think of it within the concepts of the
[01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:56.950]  confines of the United States where there's so much
[01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.670]  accessibility to so much different technology and
[01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:03.190]  different equipment and people kind of have to afford those
[01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:05.750]  things. But down there, people depend on the heavens, man, for
[01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:06.390]  their blessings.
[01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:11.830]  Right, right. And like, do people even use fertilizer? I
[01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:14.630]  mean, my understanding is people would use like chicken a
[01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:17.750]  little bit, but like, is fertilizer even used in the
[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:18.470]  tropics?
[01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.190]  I mean, that's about it. That's about it. Most of the stuff
[01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:23.830]  don't get fertilized unless you're dealing with conventional
[01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:26.630]  type farming where you're doing oranges and bananas and stuff.
[01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:31.750]  Those are getting, you know, pesticides and fungicides and
[01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:34.550]  fertilizer and everything that was conventional. But, you
[01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.910]  know, normally, you know, people don't fertilize. I mean,
[01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:41.590]  you have some chicken poop, you know, and rabbits here and
[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:45.110]  there and stuff, but people normally don't fertilize. The
[01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:51.270]  soil is rich and, you know, and the microbiology of the earth
[01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:55.190]  kind of does the thing. I mean, you know, the lightning comes,
[01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:58.230]  it's tropical. There's a lot of thunderstorms every now and
[01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:01.030]  then, raining for a couple of minutes and then sunshine in an
[01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:05.750]  hour and it's hot and, you know, and, you know, that's kind of
[01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:10.950]  like how the plant, they extract all of this stuff from the air,
[01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:14.310]  the carbon, the nitrogen, all the different components and
[01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:18.870]  elements that is suspended in the air. The rain comes, the
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.710]  lightning strikes, it gives them an electric charge and it
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:26.950]  fuses water molecule to the carbon molecule and the nitrogen
[01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.230]  molecule and it rains it back down to the plant. And in that
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:32.950]  source and in that way, it's immediately available to be
[01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:37.750]  uptaken by the plant. So, there's, you know, nitrogen is
[01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:41.190]  something like 60% of the year we breed or some shit like that.
[01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:45.030]  There's some high number, you know, and the plant also have a
[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.230]  way through rainfall, through lightning, through vapors, through
[01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:52.550]  ionization and raining back down to the plant and the earth and
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:56.790]  becomes available fertilizer in that sense. And also, you have
[01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.910]  the biome of the earth breaking down all the organic material
[01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.750]  and kind of like making that into available plant food. It's
[01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:07.190]  an amazing thing. I mean, that's why I think the tropics are so
[01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:11.030]  green because of these lightning charges and electrons. And, you
[01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.310]  know, if you go to a place where it's like, yeah, it's not so
[01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.750]  much rain, but yeah, rain and water is good for plants. But
[01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.510]  also, you know, the rain and the lightning and stuff makes
[01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:24.470]  things fuse together in the air and come to the earth and the
[01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:28.310]  plant can take on a different element. So, nature takes care
[01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:34.550]  of itself for the most part. When we do our home gardening
[01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:38.950]  and stuff, we never do fertilizer. It's just not even
[01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:43.590]  chicken poop. I mean, my son, now he's into making fertilizers
[01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:48.310]  and making stuff like that because the plant, they move a
[01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:51.510]  little bit better. Things do a little bit better if you add a
[01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:54.790]  little bit of things to them. They move a little bit faster.
[01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.190]  They look a little bit healthier. But for the most part,
[01:12:57.190 --> 01:13:01.590]  nature takes care of it. Do you find that there's a difference
[01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:08.150]  in flavor? As far as? As far as like with, let's say, like
[01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:11.830]  outdoor cannabis here as opposed to like where you're
[01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:18.470]  from, like with the much less inputs. I mean, as far as
[01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:23.190]  flavor, yeah, I mean, there's differences. I mean, there's a
[01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:27.350]  tackiness to it that you don't see here. A lot of stuff after
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:31.830]  it dries, it turns into powder. But down there after it dries,
[01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:37.990]  it gets even more gooey and kind of sticky. It kind of takes
[01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:42.150]  out the water. I mean, the trichromes on them, if you have
[01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:51.670]  a properly grown trichrome, like for instance, you can have it out and it gets crispy, but if you grab it and squeeze it together, it comes
[01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:55.350]  up back out together. Those were the difference that I
[01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:58.950]  noticed. They're not dry.
[01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:07.590]  You're cutting out a little bit, but Sancofa is back.
[01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:13.750]  Yes, Sancofa is back. How you doing? I'm good guys. How's everybody doing?
[01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.870]  We're well, man. We're having a great conversation.
[01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:22.950]  Glad that you could join us. Yes, yes, yes. Give thanks.
[01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:27.910]  So where was I there? So yeah, you were talking about
[01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:34.070]  growing in the tropics. I mean, I guess, you know, like my main
[01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:38.150]  question was, I know for here, people who grow
[01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:41.830]  cannabis have very specific things that they use for their plants
[01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:45.110]  that they commonly don't use for the rest of their plants.
[01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:50.470]  I try to treat my whole garden the same, so whether it's my tomatoes, my cannabis,
[01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:53.590]  my blueberries, try to give them all a similar amount of
[01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:58.390]  love. And I assume that in the tropics, the same way that people who grew
[01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:01.270]  cannabis is how they grew the rest of their
[01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:04.710]  food, because it is, you know, it is just a plant.
[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.990]  So that was, you know, something I was really curious.
[01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:15.350]  I learned about fertilizer when I got here 20, 30 years ago.
[01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:19.750]  Yeah, fertilizer, okay. Because, you know,
[01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:23.110]  that if people would have six, seven, eight hundred plants on a
[01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:28.390]  inside, green from start to finish, not an issue.
[01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:33.750]  You know, I mean, you're hiking six, seven hours into the
[01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:37.910]  mountains to get there. You're not taking fertilizer,
[01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.110]  you're taking a pound of rice.
[01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:49.190]  You know what I'm saying? So yeah, please go ahead.
[01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:52.790]  So yeah, Sankofa, I'd love for you to jump in.
[01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:57.670]  Yeah, I think in reference to the tropics,
[01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:03.670]  you know, the soil is so rich. And, you know, just because of all the
[01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:09.030]  rainfall and the lushness and leaves falling and just the natural compost,
[01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:13.110]  you know, process happening, you really don't need to fertilize.
[01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:18.550]  Like Grasshopper said, you know, just rain and everything is green and
[01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:24.070]  healthy from start to finish. So it's really, it's way more of a
[01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:29.190]  not simple, but it's straightforward. Whereas out here,
[01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:34.710]  people are, you know, they have a recipe, they have a mix, different things that
[01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:38.150]  they, you know, utilize to give the plant
[01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:43.910]  certain nutrients and macro and micro. And I'm not an expert in all that, but
[01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:47.030]  overall, I really think organic is the best process.
[01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:55.270]  You know, using some seaweeds and some fermented plant juice and things
[01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:58.150]  like that, you know, kind of basic, some dry
[01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:02.070]  amendments, you know, used to use guano and stuff, but
[01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:06.550]  it's not really the most, the best fertilizer as far as like for the
[01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:09.670]  environment. So, you know, it's a lot of dry ferts like
[01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:14.310]  BioLive. I forget the name of the company, but
[01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:17.510]  BioLive is a great kind of all-purpose one.
[01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:21.590]  And yeah, man, just keep it as simple as possible
[01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:25.190]  as far as like feeding the plants, just because,
[01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:29.030]  you know, we're going to consume the plant too. So we don't want to put in a
[01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.310]  bunch of like stuff that we wouldn't want to consume
[01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:35.990]  otherwise. And that's just my perception on the
[01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:41.510]  whole thing, you know what I mean? I completely concur with you. BioLive
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:45.190]  is from down to earth and I've used that for
[01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:50.790]  20 years. I mean, it works for, it works really well. I used to work at
[01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:53.510]  a hydro store and actually some people would use BioLive
[01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:58.150]  only for their whole garden. And people often said they couldn't really tell the
[01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:01.430]  difference between that and if they used, you know, BioLive and a bloom
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:05.990]  enhancer. Yeah, I love BioLive. I would
[01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:09.750]  recommend it to anybody for everything in their garden. It's an
[01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.470]  amazing product. And what's so cool about it is that there's microalgal
[01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:18.390]  fungi in the product. So like it helps, you know, break stuff down.
[01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:23.750]  That's really cool that I kind of figured out who Grasshopper was
[01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:27.910]  through meeting, kind of meeting you on Instagram, Sankofa,
[01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:32.310]  you know, and checking out the gear. And honestly, you were the first person I'd
[01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:35.030]  seen that was working with African
[01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:39.910]  genetics, you know, pushing it forward. It was
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:44.150]  really inspiring to me because like similar to food, people
[01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:47.750]  connect to their culture and other cultures, you know, through food. And I
[01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:51.110]  figured how, you know, same thing for cannabis.
[01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:54.550]  And, you know, as a person who is African American,
[01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:59.270]  it just really inspired me to see other people who were growing African genetics
[01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:01.430]  and, you know, talking about these things. And
[01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:04.710]  it's really humbling because, you know, when
[01:19:04.710 --> 01:19:08.150]  you hear somebody talk about a strain from a specific area,
[01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:11.030]  and you don't know anything about it, the first thing you want to do is kind of
[01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:13.430]  look where this, where is this on the map, you know, what's up with these
[01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:17.590]  different people? Look at all these things. And, you know,
[01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:22.150]  we're really lucky in that at this point in time, we do have access to
[01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:26.230]  all this stuff. You can kind of find whatever on the internet if you look.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:32.790]  So yeah, like from Sankofa last year I grew was a sour
[01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:39.190]  by, what was that? Angola, which do you recall which one that
[01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:42.150]  was? Which one, which one was that? Was it the African
[01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:49.190]  sour haze? Or which one was it? It was, it was, I think it was African sour
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.270]  by, it was like Angola Durban
[01:19:53.270 --> 01:20:02.370]  male. The Angola, the Angola Columbian? Gosh, I'm a little embarrassed that I'm
[01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:07.170]  forgetting right now, but it's all good. But yeah, I mean it was,
[01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:10.770]  what I thought was really unique about it was it had
[01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:14.690]  mad vigor to the point of where I had to cut the plant back
[01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:18.130]  so that it would stay equal to my other plants.
[01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:24.610]  Never had that before. And the buds, you know, came out, grew like sour, grew
[01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:28.210]  nice and big, but they had like another little thing
[01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:31.010]  on the end of it, you know, that was like a little bit of
[01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:35.810]  like earthiness, a little bit of like this more subtle chirps to it, not just,
[01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:41.010]  you know, straight gas over the top. And it yielded really fat, which
[01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:44.690]  is great. Nice.
[01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:52.290]  I mean that sounds like the, the Angola Columbian male, you know,
[01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:57.490]  because I only hit the, is the Durban sour Ghana.
[01:20:57.490 --> 01:21:01.330]  That's what it was, Durban sour Ghana. Right, that was the mom,
[01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:06.610]  right? But then I hit that either by Super Silver Cough and then by Angola
[01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:11.490]  Red Columbian black male. So I don't know which one of those you
[01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:16.930]  did, but if it was the Angola Columbian, that one grew really, really fast,
[01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:21.410]  super vigorous, and very wide and tall, you know, like
[01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:25.090]  when I did that pollination, I did it inside and
[01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:28.130]  the females from that line were like the biggest,
[01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:33.250]  fastest that I've ever seen, I ever grown. It was very, it was like a huge Christmas
[01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:38.290]  tree. It was just as wide as it was tall. So those are some really,
[01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:43.970]  some really sativa, tropical landrace type of vibes. And that was from
[01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:48.610]  White Buffalo Seed Collective, and they do some really good work with
[01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:54.930]  the landrace sativa as well. Awesome. Yeah, man.
[01:21:54.930 --> 01:22:01.410]  What else are you working on right now? Right now I've been working
[01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:05.090]  grasshoppers, cherry pie cookies, you know, I'm
[01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:09.730]  bringing that to an F3. I just kind of wanted to keep
[01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:13.170]  some of that older purple that we've had here in the Bay Area.
[01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:16.450]  You know, I'm in the Bay Area in California, and
[01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:20.290]  when I was younger, purple, like purple indica,
[01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:23.890]  granddaddy, and things like that were, you know, the really
[01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:30.050]  choice and preference smoke for anybody, you know, within the culture here, the
[01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:34.530]  cannabis culture. And it seemed like we kind of lost that,
[01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:38.370]  like I don't see that around. I see a lot of strains that have color
[01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:42.530]  and are really nice, but they just don't have that same
[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:47.330]  flavor and that smoking experience that we used to have with the,
[01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:51.730]  you know, those purples back in like the mid-2000s.
[01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:55.970]  And so anyway, cherry pie was one of those ones that
[01:22:55.970 --> 01:23:01.890]  that grasshopper has had, and every time, you know, it's kind of an older cut, so it
[01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:06.450]  doesn't really get grown, you know, a lot of it. If it does come
[01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:09.810]  around, it's just a little bit, but when it does, it's just a really,
[01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:13.250]  really nice smoke, man. It's like dessert weed, and
[01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:17.010]  it's a good smoke to enjoy with other people, just because it tastes so good.
[01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:20.050]  It's just good for conversations. But anyway,
[01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:26.050]  the cherry pie cookie line is really, you know, has all the cherry
[01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:28.850]  pie traits that I like, and I know that the cookie
[01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:35.010]  and the cherry pie have some common lineage, you know. Grasshopper might be
[01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:40.370]  able to chime in specifically on that if he's still around,
[01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:44.930]  but I know he used the sequoia cookies male
[01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:51.250]  initially and onto his cherry pie cut, and he could probably go into detail
[01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.370]  more about the history behind the cut and how he
[01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:59.250]  got it if he wants to. But anyway, it's just a really nice
[01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:04.130]  cherry pie line, and I brought it to an F2, and I popped
[01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:09.090]  about like 25 more, you know, to bring it to the F3, and
[01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:12.610]  I'm pretty, I'm happy with it. Everything, it really passed the cherry onto
[01:24:12.610 --> 01:24:18.930]  everything. Even the outcrosses really have the turps from the cherry pie, so
[01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:23.090]  yeah, I'm just happy to have it in seed form just to keep it around,
[01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:26.770]  you know, personal, and I know that other people will really enjoy
[01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:30.610]  those type of turps and those type of vibes too. So maybe Grasshopper could
[01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:36.700]  chime in if he wants to about the strain too, though.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:42.700]  I kind of hit on that earlier, but yeah, I had that three phenos that I
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:49.420]  selected one from. Hey Grasshopper, can you speak more into your microphone?
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:53.020]  Sure, Peter, thank you. Can you hear me better there?
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:25:00.300]  Yep. Yeah, that cherry pie that I have, a lot of talk about a herm issue with
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.980]  cherry pie, and that's something I've never seen
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:08.460]  on the cut that I have. I've seen the other cuts that are
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:13.500]  circulating. Fortunately, I was able to
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:20.140]  select from three different cuts, and the other ones were pretty nice as well.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:23.340]  You know, a little bit taller, a little more dense, a little more gas,
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:27.660]  and that's the one I see circulating today.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:30.860]  There's a couple other people that's working with this shorter,
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.380]  more purple, more cherry one. I think Apicianados,
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.140]  and a couple other people is working with the same one they refer to it as
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:44.540]  the Bay Area cut of cherry pie. But yeah, no harm issues.
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:50.220]  Had the cut for about 14 years or so, and keep it around because it breathes
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:54.620]  through. True for cherry turks. David Homer's
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:59.820]  iGot for that trick. You know, I would jump in and like,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.260]  you know, I'm seeing in the comments people are kind of like, eh, cherry pie
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.540]  is hype. I've seen these plants, and they're
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.420]  really good plants. And the reason why certain things are
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:17.660]  hype is because they're good. I'm not one to grow
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:24.380]  cookies, but you know, the things that made cookies are good plants.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:28.300]  And you know, even though they're super popular, maybe more popular than they
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:32.460]  need to be, I think it's kind of disregarding them
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:36.860]  to be like, oh, you know, cherry pie is not a good
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.180]  strain. Because obviously it is a good strain.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.780]  And also all this is, you know, totally
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.940]  subjective. And then the other thing is, I would encourage,
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:50.700]  I mean, obviously people are free to say whatever the hell they want in the chat,
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.380]  but like, you know, let's talk about genetics. And
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.420]  there's so much stuff we hear about politics. And I mean, we can
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:01.260]  do a political episode about cannabis, but like this one
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:07.100]  is about heirloom genetics. And it, you know, kind of drowns out the
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.900]  good question. So if anybody did have a question,
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.500]  and I missed it, I greatly apologize. But yeah,
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:18.140]  please put it up. Please put it up again. Thank you for making an effort to
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.500]  reboot the chat. Chat, you guys have gone off the rails
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.700]  today. It'd be nice if you could get back on topic and just table.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:31.100]  Don't feel the need to be the last, the one to get the last word in
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.180]  with whoever you're bickering with in the chat.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:37.820]  If everybody could mutually disarm and disengage, that would be fantastic and
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.900]  appreciated. Yeah, and I'll say another thing is,
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:46.460]  you know, I'll stay in my own political beliefs. I believe that everybody should
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:51.740]  have the right to grow cannabis outside at their house. I think
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.940]  that that should be a right. I don't think that people should have to be able
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.500]  to invest in lights and all of those things.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:02.940]  This is a plant. And, you know, part of the reason why I'm a breeder and that I
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:07.500]  breed outdoor is because I truly believe that.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:12.780]  I've grown indoors for, you know, I started growing cannabis in 2001.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:18.220]  And I've grown indoors and for many, many years. And honestly, I do have guilt for
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.420]  the amount of power that I've used, the amount of power that we've been using in
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.900]  this community. And so, you know, as just a quick
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:32.380]  political statement, I would state that everybody should grow cannabis outdoors,
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.020]  regardless of where you are. Cannabis is a plant. All plants deserve to be grown
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:42.860]  outdoors. And so that's my political rant for the
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.540]  day. And, you know, regardless of anything,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:49.980]  we should grow cannabis outside. That's important.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:59.020]  So back to our conversation on breeding. As far as like, I remember, Sankofa,
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.980]  you were talking to me about the Durban's that you're working with. And you were
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.020]  saying how like you were saying something about the high,
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:08.140]  which I thought was really interesting. You said it was like this really
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:12.860]  even high. I'm not sure exactly, but do you recall the conversation on that?
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:16.860]  Yeah, I do. I do. I do.
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.620]  And I agree with you about growing cannabis outside. You know,
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:25.340]  that's where you really see it show it, everything that it has
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:28.700]  in the genetics, its full potential. You know, we don't really get to experience
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:33.660]  that inside. But the Durban,
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:39.980]  so the Durban was from Cannabiogen. And shoot, this is probably like eight or
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:45.420]  nine years ago. And I grew it outside. And, you know,
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:50.700]  when I harvested it and I smoked it compared to the other stuff I had in my
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.340]  garden, it really didn't stand out initially,
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:57.260]  you know, so I kind of just put it to the side because the high
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:30:00.540]  really wasn't, you know, it was just kind of herbal
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.060]  and had a little sweetness, but kind of grassy.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:08.140]  So I put it aside. But coming back to it some months later,
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:14.540]  it had this really unique, crisp type of high that was
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:20.780]  all in your head and, you know, it had no physical effects.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:24.540]  But I noticed that I would just be super active and
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.300]  like cleaning the house and washing dishes and
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.700]  the thoughts are racing, but, you know, not like a super racy experience, very
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:38.620]  chill and grounded and relaxed, but just a very different type of
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.980]  experience. And a lot of people, they may not have
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:47.100]  cared for that because it's so cerebral that you could miss it if
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.540]  you're not, you know, paying attention like, wow,
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:54.380]  this I'm doing a bunch of stuff that I usually just think about doing
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.980]  and I'm doing all this stuff. I'm working the house, I'm cleaning the yard.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:01.820]  Like, oh man, it must be that Durban. And then every time you smoke it, you get
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.340]  that same type of vibe. And yeah, that Durban
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:08.860]  really stood out and was the only sativa that I've had
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:14.700]  that specific type of experience when I smoked it, you know, compared to like
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:20.860]  agana sativa, which I have a lot of. That was my first breed. I used a male
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:27.100]  agana male from Cannabiogen again and that has more of a
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:32.540]  kind of a trippy high where, you know, it can be overwhelming. It kind of comes
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.540]  in waves and it's a little psychedelic, like
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.140]  visuals start to pop, colors look more vibrant and,
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:44.140]  you know, if you're sitting like in nature, everything kind of just opens up
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:48.220]  almost like, you know, coming into a psychedelic type of experience.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:51.980]  And those are really cool and really fun.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.500]  A little bit longer flowering sativa, but
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.500]  really nice and more woody, woodsy type of terps.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.140]  If you're familiar with African sativas, a lot of times they'll have like
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:08.300]  these woodsy type of smoke, you know, very earthy,
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:13.500]  not sweet, not really sour. At least from my experience, there's a
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:19.020]  lot of like woodsy, you know, hardwood, cognac, dark
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:23.180]  type of vibes when you smoke them.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:27.340]  But yeah, man, those African sativas are really special.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:32.300]  The Durban is an earlier flowering one and it finished really nice out here.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.060]  The Ghana one, the hybrids I have with the Ghana, they
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:43.100]  typically finish like in mid-November, you know, and they're all, everything
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:48.140]  from those, in my opinion, the sativa really made the highs more interesting.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:51.900]  And just, it was just, it was my personal,
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:57.740]  you know, my personal pursuit of that type of high and it wasn't really
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:01.260]  available here in the Bay Area. Like, you know, we had
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:05.260]  Blue Dream and OGs and all these different cool
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.700]  hybrids and really nice strains, but I was just seeking something
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:13.340]  different. And I had smoked the Durban a long time
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.380]  ago, back when we used to buy weed from the
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.500]  club and, you know, we would all go in, we were
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.660]  young, so everybody's like, okay, everybody
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:26.940]  put 10, 15 in and let's get whatever or even five up and let's get the gram,
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.540]  five, five, five. But they were out of purple that day and
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:35.580]  so my bredrin got me some Durban Poison and it was just really a different type
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:39.740]  of high and I remember that smoke, you know,
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:44.300]  and that's what kind of got me interested in growing sativas
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:48.460]  was from having that initial smoke. And this wasn't the Durban Poison that I
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:52.780]  see today that's kind of short and really fast finishing with like heavy
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:55.740]  terpeneline, you know, it's hard to get away from that
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:00.620]  terp, but really, really fast, like seven week type of strain. It wasn't
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:04.220]  that one, this was a more like licoricey
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:10.300]  anise, like a cup of coffee, you know, very strong head high. But yeah man, I
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.340]  don't want to rant too, talk too much, but those African
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:16.700]  sativas, you know, they're real special for me and
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.460]  they would do really well in hybrids, like outcrosses, you know,
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.700]  you get some really interesting phenyl. So, you know.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:28.140]  No, I appreciate it. This is what it's about where you're,
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.500]  yeah, that's great.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.820]  Oh, may I say one more thing though? Please. Back to,
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:40.060]  because I know we moved forward on the cherry pie, but I'm just gonna say,
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:44.300]  you know, if you think cherry pie is hype,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.900]  you haven't had the real cherry pie, in my opinion.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.820]  And like, when I grow cherry pie or any of the cherry crosses, sour cherry,
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:57.660]  you know, which is from grasshoppers, like a cherry by sourd,
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:02.700]  NYCD, which is a really nice, I grow that. My family members, they
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:06.780]  be sweating me for the cherry pie. That's the first thing to sell, always.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:10.380]  And it's just a really nice smoke and it doesn't really
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:14.300]  get you blasted or, you know, if you're looking for a real punchy,
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:18.700]  cush type of high, that's not it. And I think that the cherry pie is like a
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:23.500]  purple and a durban, if I'm not mistaken. But it's just a
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.980]  really nice, classy smoke. And I mean, I got people who sweat me for that cherry
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:31.660]  pie. So I know that it's something special and
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.100]  it's not my favorite smoke, but when I have it,
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:40.060]  it's gone faster than a lot of other things because it's just so tasty.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:43.740]  It's just so nice. And until you try it, I don't want to hear
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:47.740]  anything about anything about hype. I've seen a lot of hype,
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:51.340]  and I'm not going to speak on hype, but I know
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.860]  from my experience, like I'm a smoker first. I'm not a breeder
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.980]  first trying to make a business. For me, it's about
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:02.060]  having good quality herb, being able to share with your family members.
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.380]  Growing it outside is ideal. That's natural. The sun is going to do it for
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.820]  you. But at the end of the day, if you need to
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.580]  sell the bag, that cherry pie is going to move. You
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:16.300]  know what I mean? And people are going to be happy about it.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:20.300]  So that's really what it's all about, is making people happy. It might not be your
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:25.260]  flavor per se, but when you need some money,
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.740]  it's nice to be able to know that you're going to be able to
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:35.180]  take care of yourself. And it's nice to have some flavors around,
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:37.820]  man. So don't be mad if you haven't had the real
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.820]  cherry pie like we got cherry pie. And I'm not even trying to say we
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:45.180]  got cherry pie because it's not like that. You can have the same cherry pie.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:49.420]  It's available. So that's all I'm saying. I'm not going
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.980]  to speak to, I don't want to cause any drama.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:56.140]  Not for the drama, but I think it's a really special strain.
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:02.300]  And I'm not a cookie lover either, but when cookies first came out out here,
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.220]  it was not the cookies that I see today. It was extremely potent.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:12.140]  It was very dense, heavy buds. An eighth would look like a gram, damn near.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:16.300]  And a pound would look like a half a pound.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:20.780]  You'd really be like, is this correct? Because it was just a different level.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:23.820]  And I know a lot of S1s are going around now.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:30.460]  And you know, but that original cut, I had grew one from Purple City Genetics.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:34.140]  Got the cut just from a club in Berkeley back in the day and just threw it in the
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.500]  yard. It was some of the most potent herb. And
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:43.820]  people from the Caribbean were like, yo, that weed there, it's strong, strong,
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.460]  strong. It's like really, really, really good herb.
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:51.740]  So, you know, don't always believe the hype. A lot of times stuff gets watered
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.980]  down after years and years. But originally, some of these things,
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.300]  if you could get it closer to the source, man, there's some special herb.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.540]  And that's why they've kind of stayed around and everybody's working with them.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:09.180]  Whether you like it or not, it could be an accidental pollination,
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:15.340]  but it's stuck around for over a decade. So, you know, not everybody can say that
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:20.380]  about different strains. And it's a lot of BS floating around.
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:24.860]  But when you get that real bag, you understand why everybody keeps messing
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.660]  with it. So that's all I'm going to say about that.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:35.340]  I completely agree. I mean, we're probably the last ones to talk about how great
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:38.540]  cookie strains are, but I mean, you know, they're good.
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:47.500]  I guess, so we're at 20 minutes left. So we'll maybe like round it up with one
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:56.780]  last question for everybody. And my question is just, because we're talking about land
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:39:02.620]  race genetics and we're talking about African genetics, but I mean, the main purpose is
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:08.780]  smoking it and effect. So my question is just, you know, what is your favorite effect
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:14.140]  from cannabis? Like what is one of your favorite things to smoke? And what is the effect from that?
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.500]  And like, why do you enjoy that? And I'll go first, just so you guys can think about
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:22.460]  whatever it is. So this last year I've been growing, I grew some blueberry and some flow
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:31.820]  from DJ Short. And I really liked the effect of it. And the effect was
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:38.540]  almost so like with some weed, like with indica is it's kind of like a muffling
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:44.940]  of like, like it's like strong kind of heavy kind of muffles. And sometimes when you have a sativa,
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:51.660]  it's kind of like a lightening of the mood. But what I found with like these blueberries is it's
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:59.420]  kind of like helps put you in a specific mood and a specific way of like, for me, it was a specific
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:04.460]  way of an internal monologue. So like when I'm talking to myself after smoking this blueberry,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:10.620]  I have a certain way of talking to myself. And kind of what I had called this specific cut was
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:17.660]  like the teacher, because when I would smoke this plant, the way that I would talk to myself was if
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:24.380]  I was teaching myself something. So I was kind to myself, I was, you know, saying, Hey, Jamal,
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:28.860]  you know, don't do it this way, do it this way. And like, you know, kind of the way that I was
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:35.500]  treating myself. And I really valued that. Because, you know, like, there's all these
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:40.060]  different things that we talk about when it goes into cannabis. But like, the most important thing
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:47.420]  is how it makes you feel and to really be able to at certain points, slow down enough and acknowledge
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:53.100]  that because I mean, for me, I'll smoke and then go to work. I'll smoke and then go do whatever
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:59.100]  else I'm going to do. And it's, you know, it's rare that we get a chance to smoke, sit down and
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:06.540]  observe how we feel and how the cannabis makes us feel. And so I would just encourage everybody,
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:13.100]  you know, sometimes smoke and, you know, see how it makes you feel, see how it's helping you. Is it
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:20.940]  helping you? So yeah, you know, blueberry is supposed to be great for anxiety and, you know,
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:27.180]  for certain people's body chemistries. And I would just, you know, really encourage people to look
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:31.420]  into different varieties. So you know, if anybody wants to jump in with, you know, what they like
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:45.900]  to smoke and why. I can go next. Well, for me is that I appreciated all of it. I mean,
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:52.140]  it's a great experience. I look at the plant as a whole, the plant. Yeah, I know you have
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:42:02.220]  a lot of different plants. I don't know if you've ever heard of it.
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:06.380]  Oh, you're cutting out so bad on this, man. I really want to hear what you have to say,
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:10.060]  because of how it started out, but you're like, I can't hear you at all.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.980]  You hear me now? Yeah, right now you're good. I'm struggling.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:19.020]  Yeah. I just love it all. I'm not prejudiced towards the plant. I'll try to say.
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:29.980]  I just love it. I even grew Ruderalis and tried to Ruderalis. It's a great experience. Don't
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:36.540]  short yourself. Go ahead and enjoy the plant for what it is, whether it's Sativa, Zindica,
[01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:42.940]  Hybrids, Ruderalis, whatever. Enjoy. It's a great experience, you know, and then you can really
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:50.060]  speak on it. For me, I enjoyed all of it. Some days I just don't want to be sedated by some
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:55.580]  chem dogs. Some days, you know, I want to chill with the kids and be happy and laughy and chatty
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:43:01.660]  and just not out of it. So there's different stuff that it brings to the table, all of these different
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.860]  genetics. And I think they're worth embracing from the Ruderalis all the way to the Sativas.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:15.020]  I think everyone should try to have that experience for themselves. It's a beautiful thing.
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:24.540]  So, you know, I have nothing specific to say about who I love this one or I love that one. No,
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:29.980]  I use some cookies. There's some great cookies. I use some Ruderalis. They're great as well.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:36.620]  Everything has its place in time and depending on what your needs are at that time. Wouldn't
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:41.340]  it be good to have a huge menu as opposed to just, you know, a bunch of hybrid that
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:48.700]  kind of sedates as opposed to make you more sedated and stuff. But not much to say on it.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:55.340]  Embrace it all. Love it all. Love it as a plant for what it is. Doesn't matter what type of plant
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:44:10.860]  it is. Just love the plant. Thank you. I'm up. I don't know how to follow that. That's just,
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:19.100]  that's like, just love the plant, you know, because he's right. You know, it has its different
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:27.420]  applications. You don't want to smoke OG and have to go out and do a bunch of activities necessarily,
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:34.940]  you know, or maybe that's what you like to do, you know. But personally, I like the more light,
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:41.980]  upbeat type of smoking experiences because I like to stay active and, you know,
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:53.500]  still be able to talk and function around family and, you know. So, I really don't,
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:01.500]  I don't have a specific favorite, you know. I really like, I like the hazes, you know,
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:06.220]  and some of the hybrids with the land race have kind of been
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:12.780]  more of the things that I've favored as far as growing and smoking, you know what I mean. And
[01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.820]  like the, something that Grasshopper did that really stood out to me
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:31.580]  was the Vibranium, which was purple Urkel by Durban Poison Ghana. And there was one female,
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:37.660]  and I don't remember the number of it. I don't, there wasn't a cut that was kept of it, but
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:44.060]  it smoked like the purple, but it had this really luminous high, like from the land race sativa.
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:51.740]  And it was just really, really exceptional and unique and kind of gave me, it gave the flavor of
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:59.580]  the sweet purple and also the high from the sativa. So, I kind of like, you know, playing
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:06.860]  with stuff like that and, you know, but like I said, when they're gone, if you didn't keep a cut,
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:14.140]  it's gone. So, it's really just about popping more seeds and, you know, experiencing all these
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:20.460]  different flavors for yourself. And, you know, if you do keep a male and you have some nice females,
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:25.820]  you can make some seeds and you could start to, you know, do your own little exploring and
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:32.540]  selecting and figure out what works best for you and for your environment, you know, as things
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.740]  begin to free up more and you're able to do things outside, you know, you find what works
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:43.660]  good for your environment and you just go from there, you know. So, I really think that the
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:52.060]  cannabis plant, it's just such a wide spectrum of, you know, types of plants from the ruderalis
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:58.380]  indicus to the sativas and everything in between. So, there's really a lot of exploring that we
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:04.700]  have to do. And I think that as this community grows, which I think with the internet, it's
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:12.780]  really taken off, at least from my experience, going from just a local connections to people
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.820]  who are all over the world. I think that, you know, that this plant is going to really
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:22.780]  reach everywhere and you're going to be able to experience all of the beautiful things. But
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:28.140]  I think when you do it yourself, you really get the most out of it and you can feel like,
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:35.500]  you know, nobody smoked this one because you made those seeds. And if it's really nice to you,
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:44.700]  it makes it that much of an enjoyable experience. Thank you. That's what I'm gonna say about that.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:46.940]  Alka, do you want to jump in?
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:54.860]  Yes, absolutely. I think that the audience here knows that I'm jiving with what you guys are
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:02.540]  talking about here. Absolutely. And really, it's a set and setting thing for me. It depends on when
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:09.580]  you're asking me what my favorite thing is, you know. So, I like the uppity weed during the day.
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:15.900]  So, it's like what you guys were talking about being able to function and, you know, it's not
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:22.300]  a good look walking around out there in public on chem dog, like stumbling into shit. You know,
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:29.900]  that's the, you know, especially where I am. It's not good to do. So, I really like what Jamal said
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:38.380]  about, I was really trying to hold on. I should have brought a piece of paper and wrote it down.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:43.820]  But when you were talking about how the introspection, there you go, is I never
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:47.500]  really thought about it like that. But yeah, I like weed that makes me talk to myself.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:53.660]  I never really like put it like in that way. But yeah, I really enjoy that about some of these
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:49:00.780]  more exotic stuff that you guys are talking about here today. It tends to do that to you a lot more
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:06.940]  than just a knockout indica. So, like that stuff doesn't make you think for the most part. But
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:12.940]  these things that you guys were talking about today is, I call it thinking man's weed or woman's
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:17.820]  weed, thinking person's weed. It's like there's somebody that likes to be in their head. Not
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:23.740]  everybody wants to be in their head. It's a dark, scary place. So, sativas aren't always for them.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:29.260]  So, it's good that there's the OGs and the chems and all of that stuff out there for people that
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:35.180]  just need to forget. You know, they need that anandamide rush. So, yeah, I really enjoyed this
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:40.700]  conversation. It was a lot of fun listening to. Wasn't so fun over in the chat today, but it was
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:46.620]  fun listening to you guys for sure. It's awesome hearing the perspectives from all over. And yeah,
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:51.260]  I was really jiving with what you guys were saying and the plants you're digging. So, fun.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:58.620]  Awesome. Thank you. So, yeah. Is there anything else that anybody would like to add before we
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:11.180]  kind of wrap this up for the day? Tie a bow in it? All right. So, first off, I just wanted to
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:19.740]  really thank all of the guests for coming on. I sincerely appreciate it. I want to thank all
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:27.260]  of the listeners for watching. I appreciate it. I would encourage the chat next time to be a little
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:36.860]  bit more angered or more pointed toward our subject, but whatever. And then most importantly,
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:43.340]  I just appreciate, I just wanted to just set out and just say I appreciate this channel
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:49.980]  as being part of a seed collective. We get tons of information from this channel that's really
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:57.980]  inspiring. And it really brings a lot of hope to this community. These are hard times for our
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:05.420]  community. There are a lot of people, including myself, who have spent their careers growing
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.420]  cannabis. There are a lot of people, I know probably some of these other people on here,
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:14.540]  that's how they make their living is through cannabis. And as things change,
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:21.340]  you know, our community is changing and it's important that we do, you know, make steps
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:27.740]  towards building a new type of community. And, you know, Future Cannabis Project is a great
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:33.420]  example of that. My seed collective is also a great example of that. And I would just encourage
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.820]  everybody, you know, if you're in a place where cannabis is legal, or if you're in a place where
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:45.740]  cannabis isn't legal, to work with other people and to start communicating because this is the
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:53.820]  future. And, you know, corporations are coming in, but they don't have the culture. And that is the
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:58.380]  one thing that we do have is that we are from this. This is who we are. You know, it doesn't
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:05.020]  matter if cannabis is legal, not legal, whatever. I have a feeling most of these guests, these people
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:09.420]  we're still going to do what we do, because this is who we are. And this is our plant.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:15.180]  And, you know, I just want to, you know, just make it known that this is our plant. This is
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:21.500]  not their plant. And no matter what they do, this is our sacred plan that we need to treat it as
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:27.500]  such and that we need to treat each other as such, which is to show respect to each other, to
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:32.140]  lend a hand to each other the same way that Sankofa and Grasshopper and Elka have done for me.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:37.740]  I was nervous that I'd come on here and I'd be here by myself. But no, I have the people from
[01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:45.420]  my community that have my back and I have their back. And, you know, that is of utmost importance
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:51.340]  because people in the corporate community, you better damn near know that they got each other's
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:59.340]  backs and we need to have each other's backs. That's what this is about. And, you know, I'm
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:03.740]  going to keep having some more shows. We're going to dive into some really interesting topics.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:10.860]  And, you know, I just want everybody to, you know, to lead these conversations, feeling uplifted,
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:15.660]  feeling that, you know, that they are part of a specific cannabis community, that they are part
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:20.540]  of this and that we are lucky because, you know, there are a lot of places where you can't do this
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:25.820]  stuff. You can't be a breeder. You can't talk about cannabis. You can't, you know, breed seeds
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:30.380]  or find somebody on Instagram and just get the seeds from them and start growing. So we are
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:36.060]  lucky that we get a chance to do this. And, you know, maybe it was its destiny that this is what
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:40.940]  we are meant to do. And, you know, I will make sure that I will shepherd this plant. And I want
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:45.740]  to make sure that, you know, the other people here do that and that you are inspired to grow
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:53.740]  land-raised and you are inspired to grow seeds and to, you know, and to just be an inspired person
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:58.860]  in this world. Because, I mean, shit, seeing in the chat, people are arguing about war. And I have
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:05.420]  plenty of my own feelings about these things. But you know what? We talk about cannabis because it's
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:09.900]  something that brings us together and it's something that we believe in. And so, you know,
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:17.180]  I just want to say I appreciate everybody here for being part of, you know, my first show. If you
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:23.260]  guys weren't here, it would not be what it was. And, you know, I hope everybody has an epic Saturday.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:29.660]  Thank you. Thank you. You did great. I had no clue that you were nervous. So,
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:35.660]  that's it. And to derect, I'm so sorry about that. It was so hard for me to, like, scroll
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:39.820]  through all of that stuff and, like, pick out an actual question. So, if you're quick,
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.940]  ask it again real fast and we'll have these guys address it. Because that's what they
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:51.660]  spent their time here for today, is that kind of thing. So, yeah. So, ask it again and I'll
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:58.860]  try to address it. But yeah, what Jamal was saying is absolutely, we're here to share information.
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:05.180]  And, you know, if you're into that, all of that, then I hear you. I'm not going to kick you out
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:10.700]  for it. I'm only going to kick you out if you're abusing people. But it's, you know, it really
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:17.180]  jumbled it up for guys like D or she, guys or gals like Derect, that were here to get some
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:21.660]  questions answered from some people that have seen a lot of plants. And, you know, that's why
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:26.540]  I'm spending my time here. And I imagine that's why these guys are too. So, thank you, Jamal.
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:31.180]  You really put a nice panel together today. And I'm happy to be a part of the first one. So,
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:31.660]  thank you.
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:33.740]  Jamal House Thank you. Heck, yeah. You're totally welcome.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:41.740]  I just wanted just to do a quick plug. Sankofa is on Instagram. And, you know, check him out,
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:47.100]  Sankofa Herbalist. He has some really awesome gear, you know, check him out. He has a great
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:54.940]  feed. And if you're interested in, you know, me and or Drophopper's work, it's on dogga.love
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:59.100]  under ILEASE feeds, which is a high speed company that we're working together on.
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:03.820]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani And I do want to acknowledge that the chat
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:10.380]  did pull it together in the end. I do want to say I appreciate that you guys put the—you
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:16.380]  put down your catfighting sticks and—and sort of got back on top of it. But I want to say,
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:22.220]  I mean, to the chat, it's like when someone comes here into our—I mean, I view it as all of our
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:27.980]  home, especially for the first time, and all they see is catfighting in the chat, like, it's a
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:35.820]  bummer. So I hope that everybody who starts responding, like matching aggression with
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:41.100]  aggression in the chat, just remember, it's like, the people trying to speak are getting
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.020]  totally distracted by that. And I'm glad you guys pulled it together because the end of the
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:49.100]  conversation when people were—or the very beginning of the very end, when people were
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:58.460]  actually talking topic-related, it was great. And I thank you guys and—and I appreciate it. And—and
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:02.780]  I assure you that it's not every chat that goes off the rails.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:08.540]  But Walka, this is baptism by fire. Great game today.
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:14.220]  No worries. There was one last question. How would you define Rudy Alice characteristics
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:22.540]  other than day neutral? Honestly, I can't. I don't want to speak on Rudy Alice. It's not
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:26.140]  a subject that I know anything about. Yeah, I figured that that was directed
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:30.220]  towards Grasshopper because he's the only person here that brought up the Rudy Alice today. So
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:34.940]  I thought that maybe he—that direction—that was sent his direction. So.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:41.660]  What was the question? What are other characteristics in Rudy Alice besides just
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:49.340]  being day neutral? Day neutral is—I mean, there was—I think it had to do with place and time.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:52.220]  It wasn't the most attractive plant for me. I gave it a shot.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:59.500]  Oh, they were asking what are other things that are—that you found unique to that other than it
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:05.180]  being day neutral? Other than it being day neutral, the CBD aspect of it.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:16.220]  Okay. It's just—it's on steroids, huh? It was one of the—one of the only source for CBD back
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:22.700]  then that I knew about. Everybody was going around and stuff. And later we get the plant out
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:28.220]  and do more testing on sativa and olanrate to find a lot of—but it had the noise in it as well.
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:37.820]  But back then it was the CBD issue that everybody was kind of—or the difference was the THC.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:44.060]  Yeah. Thanks, though. But thanks, everyone. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Jamal.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.700]  Thanks, Uncle. Thanks, everybody.
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:54.140]  So just because everyone's riveted, Jemma's team's up by one with 12.7 seconds left.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:02.460]  And the other team, I think, has free throws. The likelihood that this girl will make both shots
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:07.980]  would be—but anyway, they're up by one with 12.7 seconds left.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:12.540]  Jemma's like Dikembe Mutombo in the middle swatting balls away.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:13.260]  Proud dad.
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.820]  She's number 13 right there.
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:18.060]  Go get her, Jemma.
[01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:22.940]  Everyone have a good—and I think we have Chad coming up, right?
[01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.300]  Had to share it.
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:30.060]  Awesome. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:35.180]  Thank you. We all appreciate what you guys brought. We look forward to the next one.
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:35.980]  All right.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:38.540]  All right. Peace, everybody.
