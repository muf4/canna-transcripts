[00:00.570 --> 00:07.810]  Happy New Year Living Soil Nerds 2023. Life is flying by I think for a lot of us and you
[00:07.810 --> 00:12.610]  know as the show keeps going on we're trying to reach out and find guests that you might
[00:12.610 --> 00:19.010]  not have necessarily heard from or even know about. Last week or two weeks ago we spoke
[00:19.010 --> 00:24.330]  with Ryan, you know buddies with another friend of ours TJ, just gentlemen that are working
[00:24.330 --> 00:31.330]  hard creating medicine at a very small craft type level and moving forward into that kind
[00:31.330 --> 00:35.690]  of stuff understanding that I hope that you guys see that you know this is attainable
[00:35.690 --> 00:41.050]  for a lot of people that just want to do this at their home. Another gentleman that I've
[00:41.050 --> 00:48.250]  had, you know MJ I don't know how to really express how I feel about you other than to
[00:48.250 --> 00:53.090]  say like you're somebody that like I feel like everybody respects. You're out there
[00:53.090 --> 00:57.930]  just being who you are man. This is a hat that he literally gave me off his head at
[00:57.930 --> 01:03.010]  an expo. So MJ there's just something about you buddy that I know everybody in Denver
[01:03.010 --> 01:09.050]  feels that way. I mean I guess you know for kind of express that over a podcast is difficult
[01:09.050 --> 01:14.170]  but there's a reason why so many people respect this gentleman and what he's brought to the
[01:14.170 --> 01:19.370]  community. He created this Brothers Grow Too, that's his Instagram. I think he's even gotten
[01:19.370 --> 01:24.010]  deleted a few times so that's you know that is what it is but you know the original was
[01:24.010 --> 01:28.930]  just Brothers Grow Too, keeping it simple and just trying to you know for the most part
[01:28.930 --> 01:33.530]  get out there that there's a lot of people out there growing cannabis. You know not necessarily
[01:33.530 --> 01:39.050]  just just one type of individual, male, female, whatever color you are. There's just a lot
[01:39.050 --> 01:42.570]  of people out there that are farming cannabis. It's just nobody really wanted to talk about
[01:42.570 --> 01:47.650]  it especially during that time. You know MJ goes back, this gentleman is somebody that
[01:47.650 --> 01:51.730]  I've known for a long long time, seen him at all the different expos throughout the
[01:51.730 --> 01:57.490]  years, coming to even we had like a monthly Denver Normal event that he would be at. So
[01:57.490 --> 02:01.970]  that takes a lot of time and effort and he was just always giving back to the community.
[02:01.970 --> 02:07.810]  To be honest he didn't want to really ever you know be in the forefront I guess Marco
[02:07.810 --> 02:14.290]  and I'm sure a lot of people can relate with that but he is a wizard when it comes to medicine.
[02:14.290 --> 02:19.570]  We're going to talk about farming medicinal plants, farming medicinal mushrooms is at
[02:19.570 --> 02:24.210]  the forefront obviously of this show today. We want to kick off 2023 where we're not only
[02:24.210 --> 02:28.810]  taking care of ourselves and all that, taking care of our minds. I think a lot more individuals
[02:28.810 --> 02:32.930]  could benefit from just kind of chilling out on a Sunday and maybe tripping with one of
[02:32.930 --> 02:36.770]  their friends or tripping with their wife or lady however you know just tripping with
[02:36.770 --> 02:41.130]  another individual so you guys feel safe about it. But yeah there's something eye-opening
[02:41.210 --> 02:45.210]  to that and you know I reached out to one of the best here in Denver and I want to give
[02:45.210 --> 02:51.850]  it to Marco but I'm excited for this one buddy because if Instagram was like a street type
[02:51.850 --> 02:57.770]  thing you know this dude would be at the top of the list man and he deserves you know for
[02:57.770 --> 03:01.530]  the community to know that just because you don't have a big Instagram doesn't really mean shit.
[03:01.530 --> 03:06.570]  It just kind of feels that way nowadays. Yeah no doubt. Happy New Year everybody. Appreciate
[03:06.570 --> 03:10.810]  y'all joining us again. I know it's been a little bit what was two weeks ago we had
[03:10.810 --> 03:16.890]  brother Ryan on. Yeah I'm excited about this one Ryan. You know in my you know hiatus off
[03:16.890 --> 03:22.970]  of IG here you've been holding the weight picking up the good guests here. MJ somebody
[03:22.970 --> 03:27.290]  that hey man I don't know a lot about you bro but I'm excited to know what you know
[03:27.290 --> 03:31.490]  and you know like they say a friend of my friend is my friend you know what I mean.
[03:32.450 --> 03:37.890]  Shout out to you for being here. Thank you and just tell the people a little bit about
[03:37.890 --> 03:41.650]  yourself what you want them to know man and we'll get on into this thing.
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.880]  All right so can you unmute him?
[03:50.870 --> 03:57.030]  There. All right you're good to go buddy. Man first of all I want to say Happy New Year to you
[03:57.030 --> 04:05.750]  all. The rubber ducky isopods family. Brian let me start with you man. I met you years ago.
[04:05.750 --> 04:12.710]  The first time I one of the first times I ever went to a cannabis expo show you were one of
[04:12.710 --> 04:19.030]  the first faces I saw. Your energy bro. I said I gotta I gotta match his energy. He's good people
[04:19.030 --> 04:26.390]  and ever since then man we've had a a friendship of growing of learning. So we had some happies.
[04:26.390 --> 04:32.310]  We had some down times some sad times but all in all we've been consistent. We're still here
[04:32.310 --> 04:36.310]  regardless if we have one or a hundred thousand followers we're still here. So
[04:36.870 --> 04:39.430]  shout outs to you guys for having me. I appreciate you guys.
[04:42.550 --> 04:46.550]  Yeah well you know it used to take a it used to take a long time to build the network.
[04:46.550 --> 04:51.270]  You know you'd have to show up to the events because social media might have been there
[04:51.270 --> 04:55.510]  but everybody wasn't really on it like they are you know these last few years.
[04:55.510 --> 05:00.150]  So to really build that network would either be hanging out at the grow stores kind of like the
[05:00.150 --> 05:04.950]  barbershop back in the day trying to meet individuals and find people that were you
[05:04.950 --> 05:09.670]  know in a way looking for you. This is just like a way that you were able to kind of put up your
[05:09.670 --> 05:14.550]  beacon as like hey I'm around. Then as things started to progress in Denver and things started
[05:14.550 --> 05:19.270]  to be a lot less like in the shadows I mean things were still legal in a way back then.
[05:19.990 --> 05:24.390]  But you still had to be very very careful and a lot of us you know obviously like to partake
[05:24.390 --> 05:28.870]  pretty hard. So smoking in certain venues you would get kicked out of you could get fined if
[05:28.870 --> 05:33.670]  you were throwing that event. So there's this place called Cultivated Synergy that was at the heart
[05:33.670 --> 05:38.790]  you know that was the beacon at least at that time for individuals that wanted to come and
[05:38.790 --> 05:44.550]  smoke cannabis and learn about that kind of stuff. And you know MJ Space was there each and every
[05:44.550 --> 05:49.350]  month and I think that goes a long way into saying like when somebody actually gives a shit about the
[05:49.350 --> 05:54.390]  community they actually show up for the community. And that was kind of the stuff that we were
[05:54.390 --> 05:58.950]  working towards back in the day. Unfortunately that kind of fizzled out when that one gentleman
[05:58.950 --> 06:06.310]  I forget his name Jordan's friend got hit by a drunk driver. And so once we lost the lawyers
[06:07.030 --> 06:11.350]  because he did everything pro bono. So once we lost the lawyer it was kind of hard to
[06:11.350 --> 06:16.470]  actually have that anymore. But MJ was a huge part of that and I want more people to realize that
[06:16.470 --> 06:21.030]  because all that stuff's kind of faded away man all that work and all those things nobody talks
[06:21.030 --> 06:25.990]  about that nobody really you know it's hard to even reminisce about a year or two past. It's just
[06:25.990 --> 06:32.870]  like people are staying focused. So MJ is an OG of OG's here in the Denver community and the real
[06:32.870 --> 06:38.390]  secret to his success is part of what we're going to talk about today. This gentleman has tenacity
[06:39.190 --> 06:45.590]  in spades and there's just something to that when you know you could talk to an individual
[06:45.590 --> 06:51.190]  for an hour or two and they kind of make an impact on your life. And you know that was the reason why
[06:51.190 --> 06:55.350]  I accepted his hat and all that. Like normally I would told him no but there's just something about
[06:55.350 --> 07:00.150]  this you know his little style movement. And now we're going to actually get into the mushrooms
[07:00.150 --> 07:05.830]  and I think that's where a lot of us for 2023 could probably find a lot of self-healing. Again
[07:05.830 --> 07:10.710]  the the laws and the restrictions have kind of like come down here in Denver just like they did
[07:10.710 --> 07:15.670]  back in the day when I was first hanging out with MJ with Cannabis. So now we're I'm able to have
[07:15.670 --> 07:20.470]  him come on the show where he feels a little more comfortable talking about medicinal mushrooms.
[07:21.430 --> 07:29.190]  Exactly. So are y'all legalized medicinal mushrooms or they just chilled out a little bit on the law?
[07:29.990 --> 07:36.550]  I think it's more chilled out decriminalized as you say. Yeah it's more decriminalized. It's still in the gray
[07:36.550 --> 07:40.630]  area like when you know we were first kicking it man with Cannabis. So you kind of got to be a
[07:40.630 --> 07:45.830]  little careful. Don't be stupid. But at the same time it's not there's no real prison sentence.
[07:45.830 --> 07:50.550]  They ain't all on your ass over it. Right I mean you got to be pretty silly to go to prison over it.
[07:51.990 --> 07:58.790]  Exactly. And go ahead. No MJ I was just going to say there might be a bit of a delay so I'll just
[07:58.790 --> 08:03.270]  kind of like speak and wait. But I want to get into let the community they hear from us each and
[08:03.270 --> 08:07.750]  every week buddy. But I really want to get your voice out there and what you've been doing man
[08:07.750 --> 08:13.350]  because that medicinal stuff is next level. And the fact that you're you know an underground
[08:13.350 --> 08:18.070]  legend with it. I want more individuals to hear exactly what you have to say.
[08:19.670 --> 08:24.470]  Not a problem Brian. Once again like I said Happy New Year to everybody that's listening. I appreciate
[08:24.470 --> 08:30.790]  you guys for having me. I want to start by saying this all kind of you know started around me
[08:31.510 --> 08:39.190]  having PTSD from being in the military from 1988 to 1992. Went to two Gulf Wars came back
[08:39.830 --> 08:46.230]  head a little screwed up thoughts off waking up at night. The medicine that they give you. I can't
[08:46.230 --> 08:51.750]  afford all this Brian. I can't afford all that. So I got to figure out a different way for me to heal
[08:51.750 --> 08:56.630]  without going to the VA and sitting in line waiting for all that. So I decided you know what
[08:57.270 --> 09:02.150]  we've been doing cannabis for a while and it's going to fizzle out. That's what my thought was.
[09:03.030 --> 09:06.950]  And I said you know what let's do something different. So in 2019
[09:08.310 --> 09:13.190]  I started thinking about doing some mushrooms and I tried it and one of my buddies was like dude
[09:14.070 --> 09:20.390]  you can already grow. So why don't you try growing some mushrooms. First time I ever tried it was
[09:20.390 --> 09:27.670]  actually a pretty successful event I should say. I wasn't big headed about it. I was still humble.
[09:28.310 --> 09:35.030]  And in fact that first harvest I got and I'm going to tell you about it. I actually donated all of it
[09:35.030 --> 09:41.830]  but two grams to the veterans at the VA center off of Koufax here in Denver. So it wasn't for me to
[09:41.830 --> 09:45.990]  go and you know make profit off or anything like that. I just wanted to get the word out there
[09:45.990 --> 09:52.150]  and say hey this is something that's going to help you guys whether you're a veteran whether
[09:52.150 --> 10:00.310]  you've had some other PTSD ailments or anything that's come across your life in your past or
[10:00.310 --> 10:06.470]  anything like that. This is medicine that works and I can't put it all into scientific form but
[10:06.470 --> 10:17.750]  I know that if I take a dose of you know some mushrooms that I know that immediately the next
[10:17.750 --> 10:26.390]  that same day when I lay down I don't have to worry about those dreams waking up sweating
[10:27.190 --> 10:33.510]  and all that living in the past from the military or whatever it is that caused it I should say.
[10:33.510 --> 10:38.790]  So I don't have to worry about that. My whole goal at that time was okay instead of you know
[10:38.790 --> 10:42.230]  giving it to the friends give it to the people that really need it not to the people that are
[10:42.230 --> 10:47.430]  like dude I tripped hard last week. I know you did but this person that's laying in bed down
[10:47.430 --> 10:53.270]  at the VA hospital really needs it. So when he gets up out of bed he can you know go on with
[10:53.270 --> 11:02.550]  his normal day and feel you know so uplifted so energized and anxiety free and no negative thoughts.
[11:03.750 --> 11:13.910]  So going forward from 2019 before COVID now at the point like I said still staying in my own lane.
[11:14.870 --> 11:21.670]  I'm really thinking about opening it up my own little franchise and I just want to help out
[11:21.670 --> 11:28.470]  whoever needs the help. You got to stop thinking about who didn't help us back in the days you
[11:28.470 --> 11:32.790]  know I'm talking about y'all know what I'm talking about we didn't all get the support we needed.
[11:32.790 --> 11:37.990]  Oh okay throw that out the window let's move on support yourself get out there and do your
[11:37.990 --> 11:42.950]  own thing stop worrying and waiting for everybody else to jump on board you do your own thing and
[11:42.950 --> 11:47.430]  don't worry about none of that. Don't worry about what everybody else is doing you do what you do.
[11:47.430 --> 11:54.870]  So going forward now we're working into candies we have hard candy we've tried with the veterans
[11:54.870 --> 11:59.670]  they like that because a lot of them can't you know swallow or they have no teeth or whatever
[11:59.670 --> 12:05.270]  it is so they suck on some hard candy and they get the same great feeling the next day like
[12:06.390 --> 12:12.390]  ah well like it's it's like a reset it's really like a reset in the brain and I don't know how
[12:12.390 --> 12:18.630]  else to say it say it but in my own words when I'm on it I feel like I can conquer the world bro.
[12:20.550 --> 12:26.630]  So lately that's all I've been doing I'm just reading shout outs to Paul Stamets and all the
[12:26.630 --> 12:34.790]  other microbiologists out there doing their thing in the fungi world and I don't know if we talked
[12:34.790 --> 12:42.950]  about any of this back in the day Brian if we did it was just very you know limited. Yeah I remember
[12:44.390 --> 12:49.350]  like I remember going to the Denver Normal I'm not I'm not 100 sure you were there but we went
[12:49.350 --> 12:54.390]  to this like campground I was like Denver Normal camp out something like that it was like three
[12:54.470 --> 13:01.190]  hours away we all tripped that evening we were playing like glow bowling like all the balls like
[13:01.190 --> 13:06.150]  glue like glowed at night so I just remember tripping hard and like remembering and then
[13:06.150 --> 13:11.510]  people found out that I could juggle and so like everybody was just kind of having fun realizing
[13:11.510 --> 13:18.390]  that and those little mushroom trip memories I think a lot of us would feel the same way it's
[13:18.390 --> 13:22.950]  weird how like life's obviously going by but when you trip with people even people you've known for
[13:23.030 --> 13:27.910]  years there's something about that memory that sticks out and I can almost like you know close
[13:27.910 --> 13:34.070]  my eyes and relive that moment excuse me tripping extremely hard and just playing this like bowling
[13:34.070 --> 13:38.070]  game with everybody just giggling like you know we were like eight year old school girls and
[13:38.070 --> 13:42.950]  everybody's just having so much fun with it and that's the real joy that comes from mushrooms
[13:42.950 --> 13:47.990]  in my opinion people just kind of gets I think it gets a bad rap because some people feel like it's
[13:47.990 --> 13:52.230]  the same thing as acid or something you know you can and again you have to come in it with a with
[13:52.230 --> 13:58.470]  a strong mindset of what's going to happen to you but yeah man I think mushrooms are a positive
[13:58.470 --> 14:02.390]  thing and then if you're really wanting to take your mind to the next level then maybe acids and
[14:02.390 --> 14:07.670]  DMT and other things would make sense but mushrooms for the most part as long as you don't get crazy
[14:07.670 --> 14:12.710]  with the you know take maybe a little bit or a tenth of a gram or whatever it is that you want
[14:12.710 --> 14:17.990]  to start out with but yeah there's there's benefits and even micro dosing which I think
[14:17.990 --> 14:22.310]  the mainstream media and and more individuals starting to find out in the last few years
[14:23.350 --> 14:29.350]  that is very true what about um like strains then so obviously there's different mushrooms I know
[14:29.350 --> 14:38.630]  one or two you know PE, penis envy like does the does the type of mushroom determine the trip at
[14:38.630 --> 14:44.310]  all or does just your environment and who you're with determine the trip and then how would what
[14:44.310 --> 14:49.190]  would you recommend starting out like a dosage because if some dudes you know eat half the bag
[14:49.190 --> 14:53.590]  you got a bag you eat half the buddy half like what do you know what's the correct way to get
[14:53.590 --> 15:01.110]  into it just like you said in the cannabis game uh they have various amounts of strains however
[15:01.110 --> 15:07.350]  in the mushrooms I found out that there aren't like you know four or five hundred strains out
[15:07.350 --> 15:13.030]  there that I've seen or known about but I can't attest for like you've you know everyone's heard
[15:13.030 --> 15:23.350]  of golden teacher um we can go like Cambodian Ecuador um and those are all kubinz I should say
[15:23.350 --> 15:30.790]  and then uh we have some stronger ones that I should say that are the I call ape albino penis
[15:30.790 --> 15:40.470]  envy version one uncut those have about two times more psilocybin than the other strains of mushrooms
[15:40.470 --> 15:48.150]  we have so if you're gonna go I would say as a beginner like I was a beginner um I did um
[15:48.790 --> 15:55.830]  point three point three of a gram and it pretty much opened my eyes I got to see all the colors
[15:55.830 --> 16:02.150]  and uh it was beautiful I was energized I walked the lake a couple times but and there's some people
[16:02.150 --> 16:07.510]  that want to say you know what that's fine I don't want to be giggly I'm ready to go let's get there
[16:07.510 --> 16:13.910]  so you know we used to do two gram Tuesdays at the house like at six o'clock like whoa like I'm
[16:13.910 --> 16:20.710]  seeing the carpet move uh I see my buddies he's got glasses on he took his glasses off like his
[16:20.710 --> 16:27.270]  eye he blinked his eye kind of like fell down the side of his face like how do you look at
[16:27.270 --> 16:33.270]  your buddy again so yeah you probably want to start off something slow point three point three
[16:33.270 --> 16:38.550]  I'm gonna say it one more time point three less than half a gram try it for your first time and
[16:38.550 --> 16:42.950]  then after that you can move on up and see how you feel but I would start with something small
[16:42.950 --> 16:48.390]  relatively small so you can you can gauge up to it and remember just because your body might be
[16:48.390 --> 16:54.150]  able to handle it your mind may not be able to handle the things that you see and and I should
[16:54.150 --> 17:00.470]  say some of the feelings that go on yeah and um and that's probably going to happen to you at some
[17:00.470 --> 17:05.990]  point so you can remind yourself of uh this is just me tripping uh and this is going to end at
[17:05.990 --> 17:10.630]  some point and that's why most people also say like you know have a friend there that's experienced
[17:10.630 --> 17:17.590]  with you um you know if you're not doing like a heroic dose then I think both of you can trip
[17:17.590 --> 17:22.230]  safely if the other person's done it before and then they just kind of like look out for you if
[17:22.230 --> 17:27.030]  you're doing other drug like acid and stuff um then that's why they're called trip sitters is
[17:27.030 --> 17:31.910]  there's usually somebody that's sober to make sure that people don't kind of like lose but I've
[17:31.910 --> 17:37.590]  never truly I've never seen anybody do that on mushrooms uh where they completely like lost it
[17:37.590 --> 17:41.990]  I've seen people maybe get to that edge and then everybody in the group's kind of like hey let's go
[17:41.990 --> 17:46.630]  outside you know let's you know I almost think that's the biggest thing if you're starting to
[17:46.630 --> 17:50.950]  have an issue tripping it might be just because you're inside there's something about that like
[17:50.950 --> 17:55.190]  you just want to go out even if it's fucking freezing outside uh you know sometimes you just
[17:55.190 --> 17:59.590]  want to be outside tripping um and there's there's really something to that that's why in the summer
[17:59.590 --> 18:05.670]  and the fall I really try to do that at least once a month oh definitely and like you said um
[18:05.670 --> 18:10.710]  when you get into that you're in your own club you know you're on your own little four walls in
[18:10.710 --> 18:14.950]  your own house you're used to that you know what I mean and I think what it is like you said
[18:14.950 --> 18:21.110]  your mind wants to see other things and explore other things and I would say 100% if you're going
[18:21.110 --> 18:26.470]  to be doing some mushrooms definitely want to be outside enjoying the beauty we're in Colorado y'all
[18:26.470 --> 18:32.950]  why aren't we enjoying red rocks on a Sunday after they get done doing yoga while we you know we could
[18:32.950 --> 18:39.270]  just sit up there and enjoy nature you got to get out outside of the walls you can't just enjoy what
[18:39.270 --> 18:43.430]  you have inside all the time especially if we're talking about mushrooms bro you want to see all
[18:43.430 --> 18:50.630]  them beautiful colors that you normally don't see uh on a normal uh you know day-to-day basis
[18:50.630 --> 18:56.150]  so I would say get outside and do something go walk the lake get your exercise on you never know
[18:56.150 --> 19:01.750]  what happened after that but you're exactly right Brian I would definitely say uh outside
[19:05.120 --> 19:09.120]  Marco what is your I guess I haven't really talked to you too deeply about this like what is your
[19:09.120 --> 19:16.560]  experience with this stuff um well mushrooms I've tried three times distinctly remember all three
[19:16.560 --> 19:22.000]  um and they were good times um it just so happened at one of the times I think I told you this
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.640]  story when we were um at the at the cannabis event it was a great night we were having a good
[19:28.640 --> 19:35.040]  time but then some drama came our way and we ended up getting into some shit like wow you know on
[19:35.040 --> 19:41.680]  mushrooms was like the worst thing ever you know what I mean so um I've I've been leery of them
[19:41.680 --> 19:46.880]  because I just didn't know enough about how much of a dose to take you know what I mean
[19:46.880 --> 19:52.480]  um and I've had you know I've tried them with Nikki um a couple years back shout out Garrett
[19:52.480 --> 19:58.240]  Gardens um so uh blessed me with a little bit to try so we just chilled with a small amount he had
[19:58.240 --> 20:04.400]  these chocolate bars so we each ate a chocolate bar that was the first time kind of experiencing
[20:04.400 --> 20:09.840]  it you know as an adult not you know a kid running around acting a fool but just as an adult and I
[20:09.840 --> 20:16.240]  thought it was great I did get the kind of the urge that damn this is kind of like that it's
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.360]  kind of like alcohol like if you drink too much you can't really stop it until it stops itself I
[20:21.360 --> 20:26.320]  kind of felt like you know possibly I could run into a little bit of that if I try too much at
[20:26.320 --> 20:32.160]  one time so I really want to I definitely want to get you know into it more um but I want to kind
[20:32.160 --> 20:36.640]  of that's why I'm talking to people like you MJ to kind of drop some of those bombs on on us and
[20:36.640 --> 20:40.880]  let us know because I think one of the biggest things like you say man you have to keep telling
[20:40.880 --> 20:45.760]  yourself hey bro I just did this I'm gonna be all right relax you know enjoy it you know I think
[20:45.840 --> 20:53.440]  the mental is what I noticed a lot about it yeah and there's there's like these little loops that
[20:53.440 --> 20:59.280]  you can get in sometimes um that or at least your friends can get into um and you kind of got to get
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.480]  them out of that like an example that always stuck with me was uh we had a friend that wanted to do
[21:04.480 --> 21:10.480]  heroic dose we were doing that and then uh he started to puke and then he said this isn't fun
[21:10.480 --> 21:15.680]  and then he goes this isn't fun guy and then because of the fun guy like mushrooms he just
[21:15.680 --> 21:20.960]  kept saying that shit like eventually so annoying that he kept you know so you almost have to like
[21:20.960 --> 21:25.600]  get back to him let him let him go a little bit and then bring him back and be like all right man
[21:25.600 --> 21:28.800]  we all hear what you're saying let's move on to something let's go outside you know because if
[21:28.800 --> 21:33.600]  somebody gets laser focused on stuff like that especially when they start saying the same shit
[21:33.600 --> 21:37.760]  I've seen that kind of be like an issue for for individuals because it seems like they're not
[21:37.760 --> 21:42.080]  handling it as well or that's the way I've kind of perceived it so I would just take him outside
[21:42.080 --> 21:47.280]  or something so if they're focused on that like this is not fun guy this is not fun guy and then
[21:47.280 --> 21:52.320]  he's getting like deeper into the giggles and then it's getting into the like the you know there's a
[21:52.320 --> 21:56.720]  there's a bell curve with that you know what I mean especially with the heroic doses where it's
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.480]  it's fun fun fun fun um but if you get to the edge and just kind of like lean over too far
[22:03.200 --> 22:09.920]  um people that haven't done that that amount before I have seen that temporarily be a problem
[22:09.920 --> 22:15.120]  where with it with like acid and that kind of stuff I myself have felt that before where I
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.280]  like Marco had mentioned like I was like man how do we turn this shit off and they're like turn it
[22:19.280 --> 22:25.520]  off you still got like another like nine hours it's like oh my god uh so that that part is a
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.240]  little too much so I think mushrooms is the perfect like you know especially if you respect
[22:30.320 --> 22:34.160]  mother nature and you want to get in we're going to get into obviously into cultivating these
[22:34.160 --> 22:39.840]  on uh on another level so that they're healthy um you know back in the day MJ a lot of us would
[22:39.840 --> 22:45.680]  just be trying to find individuals that knew where cow pastures were and then supposedly
[22:45.680 --> 22:51.840]  picking the ones with purple that's what our group did and uh making them and uh to be honest
[22:51.840 --> 22:56.640]  they tasted horrific they would hurt your stomach um and so that's what I've heard from other
[22:56.640 --> 23:00.560]  individuals that are able to make it at the level that you're at uh that's a lot of that
[23:00.560 --> 23:05.120]  maybe stomach issue stuff can kind of go away from from that understanding uh the
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.120]  the different cultivars and that kind of thing do you have any experience with that
[23:14.840 --> 23:22.040]  uh are you referring to um like kind of feeling nauseous whatnot uh in the intake of
[23:23.000 --> 23:30.680]  of your mushroom trip yeah I would I would I feel like almost something maybe like uh
[23:31.560 --> 23:37.320]  less than half but maybe close to 25 or more it seems like anytime I've tripped with somebody
[23:37.320 --> 23:43.000]  somebody there is feeling kind of kind of bad at first and so you know you got to help them out or
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.400]  whatever uh we've tried lemon tech some other things like that but then of course that makes
[23:47.400 --> 23:52.040]  it more powerful uh so there's a catch-22 with that kind of thing if it's messing up the stomach
[23:52.040 --> 23:56.600]  but they've never done it before then you do the lemon tech it's kind of like you know giving them
[23:56.600 --> 24:06.090]  shots of jaeger before they've even drank a couple beers you're exactly right and I will say
[24:07.930 --> 24:14.090]  lemon tech that since you brought that up it's immediately within 15-20 minutes it's gonna be
[24:14.090 --> 24:19.290]  a blast NASA bro you're going straight to the moon on this lemon tech but it's not gonna last
[24:19.370 --> 24:25.210]  forever uh and the good thing about it the the lemon or this what is the citric acid in the
[24:25.210 --> 24:31.130]  limit or whatnot is uh kind of eating up I should say some of the mushrooms so you don't really get
[24:31.130 --> 24:39.770]  as nauseous um I've read on some of the biology or the um uh like what is the the mycologist I
[24:39.770 --> 24:49.530]  should say they take the psilocybin out of out of the equation of the mushroom they take one
[24:49.530 --> 24:58.810]  part of it out and they leave the end and it doesn't make you sick one is money is your body
[24:58.810 --> 25:06.010]  and your mind I guess it uh could can handle without feeling that nauseousness so I should
[25:06.010 --> 25:12.250]  say one thing uh to do that is I would say you always hear they say take it on the empty stomach
[25:12.250 --> 25:17.450]  or you know if you eat if you eat something and then take them then it's going to take longer
[25:17.450 --> 25:22.170]  here's what I said if you don't feel like your stomach needs to be you know feeling uncomfortable
[25:22.170 --> 25:28.330]  while you're trying to go to the moon then I would say order and eat like four or five crackers
[25:28.890 --> 25:33.530]  wait about a half hour then take them you don't have to worry about your stomach growling and
[25:33.530 --> 25:39.370]  you know that uncomfortable feeling like oh man my stomach hurts and I am high as a kite like I
[25:39.370 --> 25:43.850]  don't know what's going on my stomach I don't want to have them too I want to be able to focus on
[25:45.370 --> 25:50.650]  my healing I should say or or your high or whatever you call it without having my stomach hurt
[25:50.650 --> 25:56.250]  so I would say drink a glass of water and take two two or three crackers and then wait a half
[25:56.250 --> 26:03.050]  hour and then go on your trip. What do you so is mushroom something that you will build up a
[26:03.050 --> 26:08.890]  tolerance to MJ like or is that is it like every time you take it it's just going to be a whole new
[26:08.890 --> 26:16.840]  experience? I would say it's a little bit different from cannabis where you can kind of
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.040]  kind of get used to the same you know what I mean whatever strain it is you're doing but I would say
[26:22.840 --> 26:26.440]  in the mushrooms oh man there's um
[26:27.160 --> 26:36.680]  excuse me I would say or excuse me can you back to say that again repeat that because I
[26:36.680 --> 26:43.320]  well yeah I'm just curious if you know like with cannabis you you it you gain a tolerance you know
[26:43.320 --> 26:47.960]  what I mean if you do use every day you need a little bit more it's usually how it is but is
[26:47.960 --> 26:56.680]  is is mushrooms do they work that way as well? In a sense yes they do um with the tolerance
[26:57.240 --> 27:03.400]  with the tolerance I should say you can't do them every day unless you're doing a microdose
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.200]  and you could take mushroom you can microdose every day but if you're going to trip it has to be
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.920]  you have to give your body a break in between and yes it you can build a tolerance if you always
[27:14.920 --> 27:21.960]  take the same amount um it would seem like your tolerance would be you know the same but there
[27:21.960 --> 27:28.840]  are different strains in these I'll give you a I'll give you a example I got some hillbillies that
[27:28.840 --> 27:37.320]  are a hillbilly strain that's as big literally as big apple and I know if I take a half a gram of
[27:37.320 --> 27:45.240]  that I'm good but if I take a half a gram of penis envy I'm off I'm off the roof bro I'm done for the
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.240]  day calling my boss like immediately telling him I ain't gonna make it tomorrow. Oh oh you're already
[27:51.240 --> 27:59.240]  calling for tomorrow? Yeah like if if I take you know you were talking about the tolerance I say
[27:59.240 --> 28:05.080]  okay I just want a little trip I'll I'll take you know I'll take something that I know Ecuador
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.560]  Cambodian or anything like that but if I mess around and take like penis envy a half a gram
[28:09.560 --> 28:13.240]  then I'm definitely gonna call my boss and be like hey you know man I gotta come tomorrow
[28:13.240 --> 28:19.800]  because I know I'm gonna be up for about eight to ten hours on a half a gram. Oh wow all right
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.200]  all right so then there's I mean just with that point alone man there's got to be benefits with
[28:24.200 --> 28:30.200]  the like you said the microdosing will just kind of stay in alert and active you know and it sounds
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.080]  kind of like it's like cannabis you got to know kind of your strains how it works with your body
[28:35.080 --> 28:41.480]  and and you know when to take it and how much right? You're exactly right got to know how much
[28:41.480 --> 28:46.920]  to take and you know more importantly when to take it when I say when I'm not talking about a time of
[28:46.920 --> 28:51.400]  day I'm talking about in your head if you got some things that you've been thinking about something
[28:51.400 --> 28:57.480]  that's you know heavy on you that's definitely not a time to be taking no mushrooms because I'm
[28:57.480 --> 29:04.440]  gonna tell you what's gonna happen it's gonna be like uh Brian uh uh skateboarding down down uh
[29:04.440 --> 29:10.760]  Broadway downhill or something like that you're gonna it's not gonna be a good site and I'll do
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.200]  a quick example about uh when you have something on your mind I ain't gonna say anybody's name but
[29:16.200 --> 29:23.480]  I had a two gram Tuesday at my house a couple years back and I asked the couple people that
[29:23.480 --> 29:29.240]  were there hey are we all good up here in the head and everybody was like yeah except one person he's
[29:29.240 --> 29:37.000]  like yeah but I was like well maybe we should he's all be okay so long story short we trip two gram
[29:37.000 --> 29:44.840]  Tuesdays two three hours in he goes to the bathroom and he's in there which feels like two hours you
[29:44.840 --> 29:50.280]  know Brian you know that it feels like you lost uh time when you're on them but I had his brother
[29:50.280 --> 29:55.480]  go in there and check on him he came out and laughed I went in there this dude had all his
[29:55.480 --> 30:01.160]  clothes off sitting on my counter with his hand like this just just sitting there and I was like
[30:01.160 --> 30:06.200]  Josh you all right buddy he was like man I knew I should have just like you said I knew I shouldn't
[30:06.200 --> 30:12.520]  have took it now I'm all head messed up in the head so uh called his brother back you know he
[30:12.520 --> 30:17.800]  got got him dressed or whatever and then more importantly cleaned my damn counter why you got
[30:17.800 --> 30:20.520]  your ass just sitting on my counter like you shouldn't or something you know what I mean
[30:21.160 --> 30:26.600]  so they he took him all the way to Erie made sure he was good and uh he came back the rest of us
[30:26.600 --> 30:32.120]  tripped to like four or five in the morning and then from there you know go to work get do the
[30:32.120 --> 30:38.360]  whole thing over again and wait for another Tuesday is that about where y'all are uh
[30:39.160 --> 30:43.080]  well at once a week is good for a trip I mean no more than that pretty much
[30:43.640 --> 30:50.280]  that's for a heavy one I don't know about Brian and everybody else but for me and you know at my
[30:50.280 --> 30:56.840]  place where we're at now it's called the safe house so I have a assortment of a few people that
[30:56.840 --> 31:02.120]  are trusted that come over and I would say probably on Friday and they know we can't do them every day
[31:02.120 --> 31:06.920]  so they try and gauge the day as they're like okay what if we do them Wednesday take a break Thursday
[31:06.920 --> 31:14.360]  and boom Friday and Sunday right on I was like let's do it you know so um I would say for a
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.040]  normal if you want to trip do it on a Friday and I would say do it around you know three don't wait
[31:20.040 --> 31:23.560]  to six because you're going to be up to like four in the morning I'm just letting you know right now
[31:24.440 --> 31:29.960]  I think someone mentioned earlier that you can't turn this mushroom off when it's gone it's gone
[31:30.920 --> 31:35.160]  when the little pink elephant flies by you saw that yeah and it's gonna keep flying by
[31:39.190 --> 31:45.030]  uh another cool part about mushrooms is that they don't pop up on tests so if you if you're a nine
[31:45.030 --> 31:50.950]  to five individual and you want to mess around with this like you said on Friday if somehow you
[31:50.950 --> 31:57.670]  got a test on Monday uh you know the test doesn't it doesn't work that way so you would be able to
[31:57.670 --> 32:02.550]  pass if you tried this or something where if you you know even with cannabis I guess with some
[32:02.550 --> 32:06.870]  companies still to this day you could potentially lose your job a lot of people obviously don't
[32:06.870 --> 32:11.910]  want to try things to relax them but stress will kill you quicker than I think anything in life
[32:12.550 --> 32:19.350]  and mushrooms is a gift I guess is my opinion but it seems like it's that knowledge has been
[32:19.350 --> 32:25.430]  suppressed for so long and now that the the information is out there I think that some of
[32:25.430 --> 32:31.110]  the scare tactics uh some of that stuff still out there to kind of like hopefully not get the public
[32:31.110 --> 32:37.190]  where so many individuals are um you know take it two grams I mean that's a that's a nice little
[32:38.150 --> 32:42.550]  jump off the off the you know high dive and then you can continue to go up and
[32:42.550 --> 32:48.310]  uh I think I believe it was Terrence McKenna that coined the phrase herope dose uh and when he's
[32:48.310 --> 32:53.590]  talking about that that is one of those like go out into the forest that you would have heard
[32:53.590 --> 32:59.590]  about when your kid come back as a man type thing um that's seven grams uh you're gonna take that
[33:00.550 --> 33:04.950]  it's usually gonna probably take you about 30 minutes some individuals takes about an hour to
[33:04.950 --> 33:13.430]  get even seven grams down um and then once that starts to take hold again it's it's an experience
[33:13.430 --> 33:19.270]  but there's something to that and there's sometimes with mushrooms a lot of times with DMT
[33:19.270 --> 33:23.510]  where you can kind of see the same stuff that a lot of people have talked about before
[33:23.510 --> 33:29.590]  and for me that was the aha eye eye opening moment it was all right well obviously we all
[33:29.590 --> 33:36.230]  kind of mentally go somewhere else but yet a lot of us if we kind of are venturing into the deeper
[33:36.230 --> 33:41.670]  aspects doing a heroic dose are seeing some of the same things some of the same entities
[33:41.670 --> 33:46.630]  I was wondering um MJ if you if you've kind of ever experienced any of that stuff because a lot
[33:46.630 --> 33:54.230]  of it to me has always been benevolent where it just felt it felt okay now I can say and attest
[33:54.230 --> 34:02.230]  that my first two grand Tuesday I felt like I was in a new a whole new dimension like it was really
[34:02.230 --> 34:10.150]  hard to explain where my mind and my body was at even though I knew I was at home um I kind of felt
[34:10.150 --> 34:14.710]  like I was in a whole nother dimension like seeing the carpet move that's all normal to me
[34:15.670 --> 34:22.230]  seeing the wall slide and do all that that's all normal but it something was about that first time
[34:22.230 --> 34:27.590]  where you said it felt like I was in a whole dimension but I think that was just for me to
[34:27.590 --> 34:33.350]  explore and get my mind there to get my mind to that level but now I should say if I do two grams
[34:33.350 --> 34:40.070]  today I don't think I'm going to be in that dimension so I don't know if I need to take more
[34:40.790 --> 34:47.110]  um or kind of tinker with where I'm at right now and be okay with where I'm at it's like do you
[34:47.110 --> 34:51.750]  know your level you need to be at or are you trying to be on the level my boy Brian's at you
[34:51.750 --> 34:56.310]  know Brian's gonna go jump off the roof I might jump out the window but I might not jump all the
[34:56.310 --> 35:02.710]  way off the roof yet depending on how much I take but you know what I mean so have you ever taken
[35:02.710 --> 35:11.510]  more than two grams not yet but I plan on doing more than two grams I say what's today see here
[35:11.510 --> 35:16.070]  I'm already thinking about what day I could this could go down Martin Luther King day is
[35:17.430 --> 35:24.870]  Monday yeah this weekend bro what's up I might I might be texting you I gotta drive out for things
[35:24.870 --> 35:29.990]  but uh I also kind of want to talk about the medicinal aspects to it like there's something
[35:29.990 --> 35:34.950]  too when you have a nice healthy trip and then you're done with that it feels like you kind of
[35:34.950 --> 35:40.550]  like took a my best analogy for this has always been like you took a shower but that shower was
[35:40.550 --> 35:46.150]  on the inside and so you feel a little cleansed from that like it's it's it's something it's kind
[35:46.150 --> 35:50.070]  of like eye opening to you you're thinking about other things than the normal stuff you're thinking
[35:50.070 --> 35:55.430]  about before you trip that day or you know in the days before and then it seems like uh that kind of
[35:55.430 --> 36:00.230]  thinking lasts for a few days um and then of course kind of kind of withers away and then you
[36:00.230 --> 36:05.430]  you know you choose to do it again and it kind of continues to pique your interest so much so that it
[36:05.430 --> 36:09.270]  seems like a muscle like it seems like you can build your mind if you will the same way as your
[36:09.270 --> 36:16.870]  biceps uh by beginning to push those levels maybe you know you get to like three grams MJ uh with
[36:16.870 --> 36:21.430]  good close friends and kind of see where you're at maybe now you do three gram Thursdays you know
[36:21.430 --> 36:27.750]  you're moving it up wow three grand Thursdays have you done a hero dose
[36:29.350 --> 36:35.030]  i've done that twice in my life and it is uh you grip you would grip the chairs i mean you got to
[36:35.030 --> 36:40.630]  really that that's no joke but it's like a roller coaster ride right like you're going up to the top
[36:40.630 --> 36:46.070]  of this thing ready to you know but i also think that there's a lot of like mental to that so if
[36:46.070 --> 36:49.990]  you're in a good mood man you're having fun you're with a really close friend or somebody you love
[36:50.630 --> 36:55.750]  and you trust each other uh walking outside it's pretty hard to have a bad trip even if you're
[36:55.750 --> 37:01.270]  tripping that hard you might have to remind yourself that like you know holy shit it's just
[37:01.270 --> 37:05.190]  the two of us that are seeing this kind of stuff but yeah even in a park you know you're gonna come
[37:05.190 --> 37:10.630]  across people sometimes um there's a there's an old homie that i used to have i think you remember
[37:10.630 --> 37:17.190]  him mj ben conti uh and we we would love to do like three four grams and then walk down uh 16th
[37:17.190 --> 37:24.550]  street mall and kind of feel the energy from the lifestyle that that comes across with that and
[37:24.550 --> 37:28.790]  sometimes it would be very positive energy sometimes it'd be very negative energy sometimes
[37:28.790 --> 37:32.710]  dudes would come up and like try to fight us because we would walk down certain alleys and
[37:32.710 --> 37:36.390]  i'm sure mj knows what i you know there's a there's a lot you can do in denver and there's
[37:36.390 --> 37:40.230]  a lot of places you can walk down and choose to walk down and so we would choose to walk down
[37:40.230 --> 37:45.670]  certain areas and i'll never forget where this one guy i felt like was gonna try to i don't know
[37:45.750 --> 37:52.710]  buck up to us or rob us or something but once he saw our eyes he goes whoa what are you guys on
[37:53.190 --> 37:58.710]  and the energy and everything like everything changed i could i remember seeing it visually
[37:58.710 --> 38:03.750]  like it was almost like his hate or whatever he had towards us that went away man and then he was
[38:03.750 --> 38:09.830]  like he knew y'all were fucked up funny uncle or something yeah but that's what i think mushrooms
[38:09.830 --> 38:16.070]  might you know more individuals if they were able to just see that life is you know even if we were
[38:16.070 --> 38:21.030]  sober and we're walking through the woods i mean if you really let yourself let your mind go it's
[38:21.030 --> 38:26.310]  pretty trippy that all that shit's popping off in the woods anyway so then when you're able to take
[38:26.310 --> 38:31.670]  it to the next level and have a you know an aid to kind of take your mind to that next level
[38:32.470 --> 38:36.950]  mushrooms is something that i'm i couldn't be more of a proponent for i think more individuals
[38:36.950 --> 38:41.030]  should try this especially if you're used to just relaxing with maybe like depressants
[38:41.590 --> 38:47.990]  um this is this is kind of a nice change of pace and i promise you that you'll feel good days
[38:47.990 --> 38:52.950]  afterwards too which is you know like on monday i was joking right before we came on here georgia
[38:52.950 --> 38:59.270]  went back to back i haven't kind of felt a hangover in in probably two years or so um but
[38:59.270 --> 39:04.710]  it reminded me of why i don't drink you know because it's just if you feel horrible uh where
[39:04.710 --> 39:10.470]  i've never felt that way with mushrooms the next day i usually feel uh fantastic or i feel like my
[39:10.470 --> 39:16.630]  mind's on some kind of little like unclogging this and then you know it eventually starts to
[39:16.630 --> 39:22.950]  feel better uh and there's something to that man i think man uh is meant to hang out with dogs and i
[39:22.950 --> 39:27.270]  think man is also meant to do mushrooms for whatever reason seems like it really stimulates
[39:27.670 --> 39:33.110]  uh the brain i can add one thing that you were mentioning about the
[39:35.510 --> 39:41.190]  the effects or whatnot that you get from it um you know i got you guys can both tell me
[39:41.750 --> 39:48.950]  you know how what what is your anxiety like when you go somewhere um you're gonna go and meet
[39:48.950 --> 39:53.510]  someone in some club or somewhere you've never been how's your anxiety kick in do you sit in
[39:53.510 --> 40:00.310]  the car and wait 48 minutes and look around like i do like some jackass like dude just walk in there
[40:00.310 --> 40:06.710]  but that anxiety kicks in and i know that that's one of the just one of the little elements or
[40:06.710 --> 40:17.990]  whatnot that's uh it helps um anxiety depression ptsd um um some lady told me it helped her with
[40:17.990 --> 40:21.910]  her fibromyalgia i don't know anything about that but i can tell you if it worked hey i'm gonna add
[40:21.910 --> 40:30.310]  her to the list too but uh just you know creativity uh a few of my friends are um uh you know they
[40:30.310 --> 40:35.190]  write they rap and write or whatnot the only time they tell me the most of the time when they do
[40:35.190 --> 40:40.950]  their best writing is when they're um when they're on mushrooms micro-dosed you know what i mean of
[40:40.950 --> 40:45.910]  course not they're not partying and hanging out and doing two grams and they sure ain't doing no
[40:45.910 --> 40:50.470]  superman shit like like you brian no seven grams what the hell is wrong with you bro
[40:51.270 --> 40:59.270]  well no no no to be fair i worked up to that like that took years to to do that um yeah i wouldn't
[41:00.150 --> 41:05.190]  maybe i should be clear like if you've never done mushrooms please don't do seven grams i mean that's
[41:05.190 --> 41:11.430]  that's not a good idea for anybody um okay so that's not a good jumping off point yeah man
[41:11.430 --> 41:16.070]  that's uh that's like a marathon for your mind right so if you've never if you've never even
[41:16.070 --> 41:20.310]  jogged outside the house before then yeah that's not that's not where it's at that's why i think
[41:20.310 --> 41:24.870]  he was getting to the point of like you know under a gram that might it probably depends on
[41:24.870 --> 41:29.830]  your weight i believe there's charts now even that you can you can see like for that kind of stuff
[41:29.830 --> 41:35.270]  uh but if you want to maybe you want to do a little bit uh you know that that monday or
[41:35.270 --> 41:41.510]  wednesday or whatever kind of like let your body uh i don't know just kind of it's a different
[41:41.510 --> 41:45.670]  feeling i guess is the best way to describe that right so then you kind of feel it and then by
[41:45.670 --> 41:50.070]  friday when you really want to do that and kind of have more of a full experience maybe do a half
[41:50.070 --> 41:55.430]  a gram or a gram depending on where you're at um and then you're going to at least the first
[41:55.430 --> 41:59.510]  couple times you're gonna more than likely kind of see some stuff you'll notice that things are
[41:59.510 --> 42:05.030]  brighter um i've always liked to say that the background in life seems to come to the forefront
[42:05.030 --> 42:10.710]  so that the trees and stuff you're just amazed you know the trees exist and you're kind of like
[42:10.710 --> 42:15.990]  walking around and i know it kind of sounds silly but if you are walking around you let your mind go
[42:16.470 --> 42:22.790]  uh this place is unbelievably cool and matt and mushrooms are i think called magic mushrooms for a
[42:22.790 --> 42:28.710]  reason uh because you can kind of let your mind if you if you choose to let it wander and then
[42:28.710 --> 42:34.150]  you know the aid of each gram as you as you go up uh seems to kind of like open up more of those
[42:34.150 --> 42:40.790]  doors so you get to pick and i highly recommend that you don't do anything over a gram until you
[42:40.790 --> 42:47.830]  kind of gotten a nice base done it a couple times are the caps and the stems equal and you know
[42:47.830 --> 42:57.190]  potency or whatever i'll say yes and i can definitely attest to let's say if i just showed
[42:57.190 --> 43:02.310]  you like my thumb and you know if you've seen some mushrooms grow you know that there's a couple on
[43:02.310 --> 43:07.030]  the side or whatnot the little bitty one on the side i can tell you this right now that that big
[43:07.110 --> 43:11.990]  mushroom that's like five inches long and that little bitty one that's a almost a quarter or a
[43:11.990 --> 43:15.510]  quarter of an inch both of those have the same amount of everything in them
[43:18.720 --> 43:23.120]  okay so sticking with the weight is key then sticking using that weight as your guy
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.200]  weight is key weight is key and like ryan i want to say that again do not take no seven grams we're
[43:29.200 --> 43:34.320]  not doing all that we're telling we're telling you about opening up your mind like your third eye if
[43:34.320 --> 43:39.760]  you're going to do what i believe brian's talking about and there's actually what is the name of it
[43:39.760 --> 43:45.520]  there's a special name for that where you go out into the woods and they do that i would definitely
[43:45.520 --> 43:52.880]  say if you want to have see some things that good that up feeling because we tried it this weekend i
[43:52.880 --> 44:00.240]  wrote down a few things and said man i'm driving the next day i woke up drove home drove to work
[44:00.240 --> 44:06.880]  and i was like i could not think of one negative thing at all not and i couldn't even think of
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.560]  anything in the past it was like it cleared my mind from all that and that whole day i was good
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.360]  until like you said as soon as you go use the bathroom it's over with about a half hour after
[44:17.360 --> 44:23.920]  that depending on how much you take it's gonna be a whole long day as long as it felt for you to be
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.920]  you know me eyes like that the next day is gonna be like oh i'm tired like i need to go lay down
[44:30.640 --> 44:34.800]  so you mean you're just physically drained because people don't really i mean your brain
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.840]  creates energy like when it's working it creates heat and energy so i imagine you're that's part
[44:39.840 --> 44:46.000]  of what drains you right just the way that brain is working exactly and it doesn't help when you
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.080]  you take uh 10 people to meow wolf and you sit there and look at all this stuff for hours your
[44:52.160 --> 45:01.280]  brain is totally exhausted it's like my brain needs a break turn it off definitely i attest to
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.080]  saying start off small if you're gonna do something it's definitely going to change your
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.680]  mind if what we're talking about to to you all today that are listening i appreciate y'all once
[45:13.680 --> 45:21.200]  again for tuning in if you don't learn anything else about what we're talking about right now
[45:21.760 --> 45:29.120]  go ahead and try this for your your time try it please try it and you write down how you feel and
[45:29.120 --> 45:34.400]  how it made you feel the next day you can go back and listen to this podcast again and be like you
[45:34.400 --> 45:39.200]  know what they were right like man i felt great the next day you know what i mean i felt great
[45:39.200 --> 45:44.000]  i was able you know what i mean good move forward like i felt like i could conquer the world on this
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.640]  like it was i felt like superman like dude you can't tell me nothing i can do our mushrooms like
[45:48.640 --> 45:56.160]  please like it built my it built my tolerance it built my uh uh what is it uh my positivity
[45:56.160 --> 46:03.200]  my positivity however you said i just felt like giddy happy and just totally energized bro you
[46:03.200 --> 46:08.800]  can't tell me i can't i can't do what i'll fly this plane from here to la bro on some shrooms
[46:09.520 --> 46:16.240]  and my mind saying i can do it but my body's like bro what are you doing get my point yeah
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.320]  definitely man the mind is very powerful you know what i mean somebody in the chat just said
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.600]  you know blind people can see color you know on some studies off of drones and shit like that so
[46:26.240 --> 46:34.240]  um definitely man the mind is very powerful now let me ask you a question sir the last time you
[46:34.240 --> 46:41.600]  took some did you take uh did you take them in mushroom form did you take them in a pill did you
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.560]  take them in candy chocolate how was how did you ingest i adjusted in the chocolate bar the last
[46:48.560 --> 46:54.960]  time it was like a little hershey bar with the squares and um okay i had like half a square
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.640]  starting out and but i'll tell you and then i went to a square and i was kind of where i'm
[47:00.640 --> 47:07.280]  at i think i still have them in the freezer um but i didn't notice it lasting i think i noticed
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.720]  it lasting about six hours and it cut off like a light switch when it did go off it was weird that
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.800]  was the cool thing about it i was like damn it wasn't like drinking because i was like oh shit
[47:16.800 --> 47:22.720]  when's this going in and which is why i don't drink very very little either bro but um yeah
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.200]  and then all of a sudden you're just watching you know tv or whatever and it just cuts off and like
[47:27.200 --> 47:32.080]  you said brian you did kind of feel it was like you felt like lifted like you know helium was in
[47:32.080 --> 47:39.040]  you kind of just liked you know i did get that feeling out of it you know you can um sometimes
[47:39.040 --> 47:45.040]  you can almost feel like uh in your spine like in the back of your your neck uh on your head
[47:45.040 --> 47:51.280]  like when you're truly tripping it's like i don't know there's like um it's not it's not goosebumps
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.240]  but it kind of feels it's a different energy it almost feels like an energy uh that's kind of
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.760]  going through your spine i've never i've never had that like every single time when i've done that
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.600]  i have seemed to have that happen more often than than not uh when you do kind of get into the
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.160]  heavier doses so i don't know if that's kind of like your body's resonating i've heard from
[48:12.160 --> 48:19.680]  individuals that it you know your body reacts by uh increasing your temperature um so that kind of
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.280]  affects certain things and that's why some people claim that it's dangerous uh but i've never i've
[48:25.280 --> 48:31.520]  never seen anybody like i was saying like if you respect it um it's it's more of an eye opening
[48:31.520 --> 48:38.880]  self-reflecting uh internal shower cleansing um tool and that's why i think uh you know we wanted
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.840]  to kick off 2023 uh with having mj on here first because uh i didn't want you to back out because
[48:45.840 --> 48:52.240]  you're the homie dude and i'm so happy that you you're on here man and i i wish that we were able
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.200]  to show like the love that the community has for you uh just in the way that you were for you know
[48:57.200 --> 49:02.080]  meeting up at all the expos like people are just so happy to see you myself included uh and then
[49:02.080 --> 49:07.520]  and then i would imagine now kind of moving forward man um these mushrooms and the way that
[49:07.520 --> 49:12.160]  you're uh you've i know that you've gone through a lot of stuff since then we've even hung out so
[49:12.720 --> 49:20.080]  uh the the medicinal aspects for for men going through things um i think i can't you know talk
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.880]  about enough for individuals because you're allowed to kind of go internal uh a lot of guys
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.240]  don't you know the shit that they're dealing with they don't want to necessarily share that kind of
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.360]  stuff uh and mushrooms is another way that you can go internal especially on the lower doses you
[49:33.360 --> 49:36.880]  it's not like you don't have control of your thoughts or something like that i want that to
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.120]  be clear like you're it's not like you're drunk you don't really know what's going on it's more
[49:41.120 --> 49:49.360]  just um you might see some stuff like like or i guess the carpet is probably the classic example
[49:49.360 --> 49:56.240]  right mj so yeah and then the couch maybe kind of swaying and the walls are moving a little bit and
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.760]  just remind yourself that you know that that's what you want it to do right so that that part
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.280]  is kind of um i wouldn't use the word scary but it's just kind of different and then once you've
[50:07.280 --> 50:13.680]  had that feeling of tripping before uh most people really enjoy it and like marco would even mention
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.720]  he's done it a handful of times uh but he remembers them vividly and that's how i felt like i started
[50:18.720 --> 50:23.840]  off the show and there's there's certain times where you just remember things that it's almost
[50:23.840 --> 50:29.680]  like your mind can took a fantastic snapshot of that uh when you were tripping so you can kind of
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.080]  go back to that remember those memories and i don't know what that's all about uh but there's
[50:34.080 --> 50:39.280]  something kind of cool with being able to to kind of remember that almost like on a photographic
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.560]  memory uh that that evening when you're tripping that hard i did read you know when you do these
[50:44.560 --> 50:49.200]  mushrooms they actually build your synapses in your brain like they make new connections and
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.720]  things like that so definitely that makes a lot of sense um i agree man i think the key would be
[50:54.720 --> 50:58.880]  like like you said start with a buddy start with someone that's experienced like because
[50:59.920 --> 51:04.800]  just doing it the few times i did i realized it's very powerful you know what i mean and i'm the
[51:04.800 --> 51:09.280]  kind of guy i don't want to be like out of control you know what i mean necessarily unless it's just
[51:09.280 --> 51:14.320]  chill you know what i mean i don't you know i want to be like sloppy drunk or can't defend myself
[51:14.640 --> 51:20.400]  type shit so i think that is key to um be with somebody you trust and it knows kind of what what
[51:20.400 --> 51:24.560]  to expect so they tell you man just chill that's how it's supposed to be or the carpet wait till
[51:24.560 --> 51:29.200]  the carpet moves that's gonna be cool you know or what you know that kind of thing so yeah good
[51:29.200 --> 51:37.280]  stuff man and i can tell you this a couple people have asked me um you know on the lines what should
[51:37.280 --> 51:44.800]  i expect like they like you said you know marco once you tried or whatnot like it's the light
[51:44.800 --> 51:51.920]  switch like boom i'm done it's over with um i think i think that the newcomers are the people
[51:51.920 --> 51:56.880]  that haven't tried them lately or haven't tried them for their first time their thing is what you
[51:56.880 --> 52:05.040]  know what am i expecting and i my only way to to make this you know uh impress this impression in
[52:05.040 --> 52:10.560]  your mind is to say look don't sit here and wait for it to happen just sit there and do your normal
[52:10.560 --> 52:16.880]  stuff so when we to my house we usually plan uno we got the big cards of uno we're all just sitting
[52:16.880 --> 52:23.360]  around playing uno you know we all have everything written down who took what at what time so i'll
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.960]  always know who took what and you know can kind of gauge who's doing what but yeah you don't do
[52:28.960 --> 52:33.200]  anything extra you don't sit there and wait for it to go here it is no you'll know when it hits
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.200]  your stomach and your stomach feels like you drank a cold water in the morning feels a little
[52:37.200 --> 52:41.840]  uneasy and then you know a few minutes after that's like oh wow this is what you're talking about
[52:42.640 --> 52:49.760]  yeah yeah i think that's a bar right there man because do just do go throughout your day don't
[52:49.760 --> 52:54.400]  sit there and wait on it that's key right there that's why i threw that bar up there you know if
[52:54.400 --> 52:58.480]  you got something planned i would imagine just start doing this shit and then just let the let
[52:58.560 --> 53:04.000]  the shrooms come to you right but we should put a caveat on on that because if you start
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.720]  tripping and you're in public that's probably going to give you anxiety like that that's
[53:09.280 --> 53:13.360]  that's almost another thing of what you try to work up to like i remember back in the day we
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.360]  would trip pretty hard and then try to go play poker at this little uh place where you used to
[53:17.360 --> 53:22.560]  play at and try to out think people and all that stuff and it took a while to build up to that to
[53:22.560 --> 53:29.440]  even be tripping that hard in public so um there's a lot of like little variables with this
[53:29.440 --> 53:34.800]  just to make sure that you're doing it doing it right doing it safe and if you do have anxiety
[53:34.800 --> 53:39.440]  i feel like that might enhance it especially the first time you're doing it where if you're out in
[53:39.440 --> 53:43.680]  the woods you're not going to have that issue so your experience is going to be dramatically
[53:43.680 --> 53:48.560]  different especially if you're more of like an introvert just go out go out in the woods with
[53:48.560 --> 53:54.320]  a friend that's interesting you said that brian because i was wondering like if it could be used
[53:54.320 --> 54:02.160]  to like dial into a task and so for you to say poker so aside from kind of the overall anxiety
[54:02.160 --> 54:06.960]  of everybody were you able to kind of dial in anything with it and get some like say man i can
[54:06.960 --> 54:13.680]  use this or was it just gonna be just too much with the anxiety and stuff man i'm gonna probably
[54:13.760 --> 54:19.200]  overshare this but i hope that people see that this shit is weird right so when i'm in public
[54:19.200 --> 54:24.720]  i can't pee in public like i have a problem with that shit and i discovered one time when i was
[54:24.720 --> 54:28.640]  tripping uh that if i say one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.920]  for whatever reason i'm able to do that and i discovered that tripping and ever since then
[54:33.920 --> 54:39.200]  whatever used to block my mind from being able to do that now if i do that little extra one two
[54:39.200 --> 54:43.760]  three one two three uh i'm able to do that so like when i go to the mall i can go to the you
[54:43.760 --> 54:47.760]  know go into the restroom beforehand i would always just wait i always have like this weird
[54:47.760 --> 54:53.920]  phobia i think when i was a little kid and so it like i know that's like probably an overshare but
[54:53.920 --> 54:58.800]  it it was something that mushroom somehow fixed and it was a problem for me because you know there
[54:58.800 --> 55:05.520]  be times where i would prefer to like go pee behind a building then go and pee you know in a public
[55:05.520 --> 55:10.720]  restroom um so that fixed that phobia or whatever the fuck it was so if you have some weird little
[55:10.720 --> 55:15.520]  thing like that i think you'd be able to find a way to fix it um that obviously normally i would
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.240]  never fucking share with anybody um but i'm sharing that with you because it was one of these things
[55:20.240 --> 55:24.240]  that i worked my whole life even in college bars the whole thing man when you're sitting there
[55:24.240 --> 55:28.960]  getting hammered drunk there's always just some fucking weird problem that i had until i was so
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.640]  you would just piss out but you could piss easily behind the building or whatever 100 but if and
[55:34.640 --> 55:38.480]  especially in the troughs like in colleges where you're sitting next to me we're all
[55:38.480 --> 55:42.640]  i don't know man it just always gave me uh the willies you know yeah the troughs are always a
[55:42.640 --> 55:49.680]  little weird you know man i can feel you on that i can i'm gonna add in something you just said there
[55:49.680 --> 55:57.440]  brian when you said it just does something for you where you can block that out and i'm gonna
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.040]  because i don't i don't like using the um the restrooms in public you know at all
[56:04.320 --> 56:09.360]  all if i don't have to so uh on a two gram tuesday that first time i was telling you about
[56:09.360 --> 56:14.240]  we did two gram tuesday dude i live across the street from seven on jewel and kipling okay
[56:15.440 --> 56:24.000]  why tell me why we walked to 7-eleven bought like 18 worth of junk food and all kind of bullshit
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.840]  tell me why i went and used the bathroom we dropped one dropped the deuce and came right
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.360]  on out like nothing happened what was i thinking about and i told my friend he was like what are
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.800]  you doing he's like you would never told me that one he says two you would never go in that bathroom
[56:38.800 --> 56:42.960]  you would wait i was like you're right i don't know what it is so going back to what brian said
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.400]  i don't know what it is man but if like i said it feels like i'm superman when i'm on it i ain't got
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.680]  to worry about uh anything um i feel like i said i can feel like i can conquer the world with them
[56:53.920 --> 56:59.920]  like you have to experience this people and some of the people that are listening how many grams
[56:59.920 --> 57:04.720]  have y'all done that that made y'all feel that great or what did you see what are some of the
[57:04.720 --> 57:11.840]  things you saw and what are the benefits that some of you guys had i mean marco and brian
[57:11.840 --> 57:17.840]  definitely have some stories to tell and you know i have a few to tell myself um but um so
[57:18.240 --> 57:25.200]  if you could you know sorry to cut you off mj i was just thinking um you know you know cannabis
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.080]  people gotta get that point out before you forget and shit um but um i was just thinking if you go
[57:30.080 --> 57:36.080]  into the the trip with a task you know hey man i know i'm uh you know whatever it may be like i
[57:36.080 --> 57:41.600]  don't like to do xyz kind of go into that with your mind already thinking about that and maybe
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.240]  that is something that you know you can work through an issue with i'm still wondering how
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.120]  you got to one two three like you know what i'm saying how that clicked for you but that's it who
[57:51.120 --> 57:57.040]  knows right yeah i don't that's what i'm saying man it was like whatever was blocking it that's
[57:57.040 --> 58:02.960]  what i started to do and it started to work and i use that shit to this day like if i'm traveling
[58:02.960 --> 58:08.800]  with my kids and they gotta pee every 15 minutes it feels like you know i hate going into public
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.920]  stuff just because it's i don't know maybe you think about it too much yeah i mean people are
[58:13.920 --> 58:18.640]  people as like a whole are gross you know and you're you're probably gross to your whatever
[58:18.640 --> 58:24.160]  your level of comfort is in your own home but in public areas and stuff it's just it's just gross
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.680]  i think to a lot of people uh so yeah there's a lot of phobias and stuff i think that come from a
[58:29.680 --> 58:34.160]  variety of things stress i think is probably the biggest thing that i would think most people would
[58:34.160 --> 58:40.480]  benefit from uh being able to trip and kind of let go of their mind um and and learning maybe
[58:40.480 --> 58:45.760]  relearning how to do that kind of just realizing that you know i'm out in the woods for a couple of
[58:45.760 --> 58:50.240]  you know like like marco said six hours hey buddy that's a good trip you know sometimes they only
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.720]  last like two three hours it's gonna again there's too many variables for that to really
[58:54.720 --> 58:59.920]  uh depends how big you are you know marco's a huge dude so if you give three grams to like your
[59:00.560 --> 59:06.240]  tiny girlfriend uh that's gonna dramatically change the whole experience so you gotta really
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.560]  do your homework before you do this and then once you got it dialed in it's kind of the same thing
[59:10.560 --> 59:16.320]  you know you know uh you you know what you can kind of handle and then once you experience that
[59:16.320 --> 59:21.040]  for some individuals they like to kind of push it a little bit um and like i had mentioned like just
[59:21.040 --> 59:24.800]  because you did a heroic dose that doesn't mean that you're going to start doing that every weekend
[59:24.800 --> 59:29.200]  i think sometimes when you push kind of go through the veil a little bit uh you come back and you're
[59:29.200 --> 59:34.240]  like all right i'm cool with that for a little while um and that's fine too and and i felt that
[59:34.240 --> 59:39.360]  way because there's there's just some things that i don't know i don't know if my mind was ready to
[59:39.360 --> 59:45.280]  handle it and this this was a while ago uh when i was doing that much but but you kind of just need
[59:45.280 --> 59:50.800]  to know where your mind is at you know and what you're open to um and that's only you internally
[59:50.800 --> 59:55.440]  are only going to know that so that's why you start off super super slow so you don't accidentally
[59:55.440 --> 01:00:03.120]  scare yourself like you said earlier it's definitely um it's not like drinking like
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.960]  you know it's waiting for it to happen you could just you know what i mean it's not definitely like
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.440]  cannabis where you can just like i take one more hit and i'm cool i'm you know i know where my
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.080]  level is going to be it's a little bit different if you don't start off small you just say you know
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.440]  what i'm gonna try two grams because he said two gram tuesday don't do that please build your
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.920]  tolerance up i would say start off with something small maybe i don't know if you guys can see this
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.240]  or if i can show this but i would start off with maybe you know 0.3. 0.3 that's where i'm at
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.240]  is that where you're at you know you sold me on the 0.3 the next the next go is 0.3
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.920]  because i'm going to do that i'm going to weigh and go go with that weight and kind of work it up
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.560]  like you know what you guys said because i like things that are predictable you know you you know
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.000]  you smoke your whatever that's predictable you know i don't want to be like not knowing i at
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.360]  least like to know kind of all right here's where i'm going let's go you know then i'm cool
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.000]  definitely like you said i would definitely try to do it going in with a task it worked for you
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.160]  brian and in your situation with the one two three what who's to say it won't work for you marco and
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.080]  something that you want to try or you with you and your girlfriend because i don't like hiking or
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.760]  you know touching animals or whatever it is that you don't like maybe there's an experience waiting
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:24.640]  for everybody that we just don't know about now driving is how's the the driving is it's
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.000]  how's the how about driving is that i'm sure that's very uh unrecommended or what are you
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.800]  what y'all's experience on that yeah i don't i wouldn't say drive on that ever really ever
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.200]  because you're gonna it's kind of the same way with being drunk i got it i'm cool you know but
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.880]  when you get somewhere where it's not like like if you're out of if you're at the place where
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.400]  everybody's tripping and for whatever reason you're going home and it's just you and your buddy
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.880]  and you happen to go to like a waffle house or whatever the hell it is back in the day right auto
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:03.120]  house all these little 24-hour breakfast places you walk in there you're gonna everything's gonna
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.000]  re-kick in it's like holy shit we are fucked up compared to everybody else and and you're not
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.040]  gonna remember that when you're driving so that and i i also would think that if you got pulled over
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.560]  you would be your heart would be pumping so fast your eyeballs are gonna be as big as saucers
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.960]  um that you're gonna get yourself in some major fucking trouble you know without probably even
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:31.040]  realizing it telling the cop oh man i'm seeing colors and a lot of people reacting in a different
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:38.320]  way um so yeah i would think that yeah you get pulled over and bust out laughing in the cop's
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.920]  face that's not gonna go too well definitely not you know he's at the car and roll you know knock
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.680]  knock roll the window down you roll over and look at him laughing he's like yeah they're done
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.800]  whatever they're doing they're done when you roll that one down he sees your eyeballs he's gonna step
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.880]  back like oh yeah these dudes right here whoa where are y'all doing and where y'all coming from
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:08.320]  there you go great advice but like i said if you do get put don't drink don't do none of this stuff
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:14.800]  don't you're supposed to enjoy this at home or outside in the nature and you tell him up if
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.560]  if you had to
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.680]  go ahead bry i'm sorry mj it was uh it was delayed i was just saying like i wanted to get the point
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.080]  across like it's obviously easy to get an uber or something there's no reason to chance that same
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.720]  thing with drinking um it's it's you're under the influence and especially when you're first
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.520]  starting out um you know you're you're newer to it so you're gonna think you're okay and like i
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.920]  had mentioned if you ever think you're all right just or if you if you're out and about just walk
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.240]  in a place where everybody's sober or you know decently sober and see you're you're still feeling
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.760]  that you're still even even after hours and hours have gone by i promise you you're still under the
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.800]  influence of that stuff um and eventually you'll get to where you could probably decently drive
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.920]  safe but again if you got if you got pulled over with the saucers i would came back yeah you wouldn't
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:11.280]  want to even risk getting pulled over ain't even you know not even about like nothing to get a
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.560]  crime with the crime is being a dumb motherfucker and killing somebody or accidentally hitting
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.040]  somebody or you know so that's what we're that's the point we're trying to make here uh for the
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.560]  for the smart guys in the chat yeah this is uh this is something this is a planned out drug if
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.720]  you if that's the way you're viewing it right this is a planned out at home you know what i mean
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.480]  yeah you're you're you're gonna you're gonna think seeing some things through when you for your night
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.920]  for this it's not like all of a sudden hey i just uh did a bunch of mushrooms um and if you if you
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.640]  choose if you like if you're drunk and you do mushrooms i've seen that before or it doesn't
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:54.240]  really even affect them that much but they're puking or they have the the other way um so you
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:05:00.240]  kind of need a clear mind in my opinion like mj brought up a clear stomach um i would do it on an
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:05.280]  empty stomach i've seen people where they're eating like cereal and stuff beforehand that's
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:11.840]  you know they got the milk from the dairy is horrific for that even just a bowl of milk so
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.000]  really think things through when you're when you're doing this and uh if you're into intermittent
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.880]  fasting or something that'd probably be fantastic to be able to to fast out like 16 hours so you're
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.720]  getting into the autophagy level and then take those mushrooms uh they're going to help you
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:32.800]  with that microbial level um it might be you know it might it might there might be some issues you
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.120]  know kind of going through the system a couple times but i promise you that things are improving
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.040]  and it's definitely worth going through that because then you're going to feel so much better
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.360]  and then like probably mj i would love to get into more of the growing aspects of about feeling
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:53.440]  better thinking the same thing because you you kind of again you have this you have a weird
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.880]  energy man like there's such a positive energy like if everybody's on like whatever 100 you just
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:05.760]  hover at 125 bro and everybody realizes that and it's it's just contagious so moving into now that
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.480]  you're creating this medicine you know especially back in the day when we talk about living soil and
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.600]  at those little events and all that kind of stuff a lot of people were having problems and now moving
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.160]  in now that denver's more like relaxed the rules and all that kind of stuff people are still having
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.360]  problems but now it's in the you know the the world that you seem to be just dialed in at so
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.600]  we'd love to hear some we call them gold bars on the show man where you just kind of give some
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:36.240]  people some gold nuggets to minimize the the stress or the overall um you know roller coaster
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.080]  of trying to grow mushrooms because there is a pretty big learning curve with this you can
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:48.640]  fuck it up very easily uh especially when you're first getting into it that's true i i can attest
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:55.600]  to that um and i first thing i wanted to say uh and then i'll lead back into that is uh when you
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.200]  do get your your mushrooms make sure they're from a reliable source don't get them from the middle
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.320]  man you want to know somebody that's growing them for one so you know what you're looking for and i
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.520]  all mushrooms are good it's like 80 of the mushrooms found outside are not good for you
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:17.280]  so i would say uh just because they turn green and blue uh when they're bruised when you touch them
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.840]  they bruise uh very easily uh when they're fresh uh i would say uh watch out where you get them
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:31.600]  from now not go to a reliable source um and uh ask them you know ask them questions like you would
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.000]  if you're going to a cannabis store uh you know what were they grown in you know what's the process
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.280]  if they can't tell you what the process is maybe they're the middleman and they're just trying to
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:46.880]  make a quick buck but you're gonna need to get with someone that's gonna want to uh invite you
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.240]  you know what i mean like i met brian uh years ago and as soon as i met him i was like that's
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.640]  coming to my house and that didn't happen we talked about that but find out where you make
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.680]  sure you got a reliable source where you're getting shrooms from now that's legal you're
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.200]  not going to get them at no dispensary or nothing like that um so make sure you know where you're
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.880]  getting them from get them from uh someone that you trust um and then uh go moving forward if
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:19.840]  there's something that you want to do um don't you need to stop listening to me say the negative
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.560]  about oh you have to have this and you have to that no you don't have to never have none of that
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.360]  i don't have a budget to do none of this but i started with a hundred dollars and it kind of
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:39.440]  worked out um i was able to uh i found a good uh source of spores um that deliver to colorado or
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.200]  i should say they only don't deliver to three states currently right now
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.080]  georgia's one of them california somewhere in california and i think it's idaho or something
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.880]  like that they don't deliver to or something uh but i would get a get somewhere where you can get
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.760]  some spores and then once you get some spores i should say the spore is actually the mushroom
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.480]  it comes usually in a couple different ways a vial but the most ways times you get it is going
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:12.480]  to be in a syringe you get your spore in a syringe and then from that at least you have a beginning
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:18.400]  and then from there you're going to need something to inject the spore into which is usually like a
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.560]  spawn bag which is like berries or something you can spend money on that or you can do the route
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:32.400]  that i did and just go and get you some uh corn from walmart for two damn dollars two pounds get
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:40.080]  three of them boil it for an hour i boiled my corn put it in some big mason jars like you see
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:51.920]  that's in there i let them dry then i injected two to three ccs into this jar with my corn okay
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:00.160]  let me jump in right there so when you do that corn you let it dry air dry all the way out till
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:08.160]  it's dry or what do you mean by that meaning after i boil for an hour i got a big pot that i use like
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:17.200]  you boil gumbo or something in i'd let it take it off the heat and then pour all the corn into like
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.480]  a strainer like a spaghetti strainer or something big where all the water can fly out of it and then
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:29.920]  i just every five or ten minutes i'll go and like shake it up so all the uh all the excess
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.320]  moisture comes out of it and then i'll just let it sit literally for an hour until i don't get
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.280]  when i shake it i don't get no more moisture and then after that i put it in the mason jar
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.600]  all the way up to about you know two inches from the top and then i'll put the top on it with the lid
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:53.440]  so the lid will go this way it's never sealed need some air to get in here so you can let that
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:01.120]  excess moisture out so i would say i'd let it sit in there for like two days i'll shake it every few
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.640]  days you know every day i'd shake it up just you know to make sure the moisture is gone of course
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.960]  i might have a little condensation in there i'm just making sure that there's moisture inside the
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:17.280]  kernel once that's done and after two days now i can inject that into my inject the syringe
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:24.480]  into this jar of corn that you just made for an hour okay you only spent like six dollars on this
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.880]  versus going to buy some bags for 30 bucks now i'm trying to save you a few dollars because we
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:36.800]  ain't got all got the money to do all that um so after i inject this jar i'm gonna wait like
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.760]  two weeks it's gonna start turning white which is what we want we want the mycelium to grow
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.760]  and take over the whole thing of corn it's gonna that jar sealed at that point after you
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:56.880]  inject and then you go sealed it's the same way same way okay same way i have it same way i
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:03.680]  injected it put the cap back on it and i just i kept it tight like that this is you know not real
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.160]  tight but just tight enough because the lid is the other way it's never going to create a seal
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.000]  so i'll still be able to get a little you know something will be able to seep out if it can
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.520]  gotcha um at 30 days maybe 30 days this whole jar turn white okay so here's the important part if
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:28.960]  this jar doesn't turn white there ain't no magic in the mushroom dog so from there once this turns
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:37.120]  white now all we have to do is add like brian was talking about earlier some kind of substrate
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.520]  where there'd be some cow manure horse manure or whatnot i use what what is called substrate
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:50.080]  which is sterilized dirt i can make it but i prefer to buy the bag because i want to make
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:13:01.840]  sure it's guaranteed they're 100 sterile so i'll add my jar of corn to this bag of
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.000]  substrate which is sterilized dirt and i'll seal the bag okay and i'll just put that in the shelf
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.120]  where it's dark somewhere okay so all what i'm doing now is i'm gonna mix that bag up because
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:22.960]  i want the spawn or the corn that we use that's in that jar to mix with the substrate which is
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:29.920]  sterile dirt we're going to mix those two together and now together the whole bag is going to turn
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:37.360]  white if the bag doesn't turn white there's no magic in the mushroom dog so once the bag turns
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.240]  white the only thing we need to do to make mushrooms grow there's two important key uh
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.480]  things for them to grow one is air oxygen and the next thing is light we don't need to get no big
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.400]  fancy grow light or anything we just need to get a nice bulb that we can plug in somewhere and have
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.960]  light shining and preferably a blue spectrum because that's the best spectrum to grow mushrooms
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:11.360]  in okay once we are done with that we've mixed our bag and our spawn they've turned white we took them
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.680]  out of our drawer or wherever it was dark now we took them into the light and where there's air
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:24.720]  movement or whatnot all you have to do now is open the bag air is going to mix in with the
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:31.920]  you know the spawn and the uh the corn and mushrooms will start to appear but before
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.600]  they appear you're going to see a pin which this is like a top of a pin they're very very small
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.880]  once the pins appear then you know that the mushroom is going to come in after that
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.800]  and all you have to do is make sure the sides of the bags have condensation so you can use
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:57.760]  a spray bottle a couple sprays two times a day we got mushrooms going buddy that fast it's that easy
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.800]  and more importantly let me say this you have to be very sterile so i'm always i always have
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.920]  two pair of gloves on i wash my hands i took a shower before i even started doing any of this
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.880]  and i only wear the same clothes i do when i when i inoculate and mess with mushrooms i wear the
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.840]  same clothes every time only i'm trying to reduce all my contamination i don't want my bag to turn
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.880]  green because if it does i have to throw it away that is not good you say it again if you do all
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:32.240]  this and you're waiting for your bag to turn white and it turns green it's contaminated throw it away
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:39.120]  dog we don't need that throw it in your compost thank you thank you throw it in your compost
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:46.480]  good description man that makes a lot of sense man i've grown um pink oysters some king oysters
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:54.640]  before similar but i like to see what the um with these magic ones they like the um the earth the
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:01.680]  soil in there um can they grow like on a you know a grain type substrate as well as long as
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:07.600]  it's sterilized or do you like you like that bag with that soil type mix in there i'd like the bag
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:16.960]  soil mix uh more like because it's more sterile than anything uh however uh when i'm just using
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.440]  my spawn bags i prefer i'm gonna i'm gonna save some money somewhere so if i'm gonna spend 30
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.440]  dollars on this bag you can believe i'm gonna spend a few dollars on everything else i need to
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.320]  do which is only one other thing so when i told you about the corn i'm gonna throw i'm gonna blow
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:38.640]  your mind about this everybody knows uncle ben's rice right the 90 minute rice bag oh yeah oh yeah
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:47.440]  the boiling bag yeah inoculate that bag so you can put a piece of uh that mic i forgot what the
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:53.760]  micro spore tape or whatever it is and you can inject that white bag i mean excuse me you can
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:05.280]  inject a uncle ben's 90 90 second bag of rice is that that easy bro i like saving that money that's
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.160]  key definitely yeah because a lot of people are not going to spend a thousand dollars for a hood
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.840]  and i like the mason jar tech i mean that saves you right there because if not you got to buy
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:21.600]  those bags with the micro patch you know what i'm yeah the ones you're saying yeah exactly how much
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:30.560]  are mason jars 15 right using your whole damn life all the time well what about like bird seed
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.440]  tech i used to see people using that do you think is that like saying back in the day now you know
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.120]  the mushroom cultivation has gotten to this point this is what you should do so just focus on this
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:45.840]  if you're new or is there still a variety of ways that are that people should grow this
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.960]  there are still a variety of ways you can grow this but let's look at it this way
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.000]  i'm on a budget like everybody else should be all that going to taco bell and lunch y'all
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.040]  should be bringing a lunch to work with y'all let me just say that but yeah i'm on a budget so
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:09.440]  i'm gonna spend i'll go and get 10 bags of uncle ben's rice do that versus going to spend 30 on
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.240]  one bag and it go bad or something
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:22.480]  these are like og little hacks here exactly and that's kind of why you know some of the way i
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.120]  guess some of us grew up you know that is the way that you would learn stuff is that people would
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.280]  have it so dialed in this is how you do it this is how you grow it this is how you sell it this
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.200]  is how you never have it on you i mean there's so many different ways that people could teach you
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:41.680]  stuff and then once it's tried and true it sounds like mj that you're able to have this skill set
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.960]  obviously for life and as you continue to improve on it you know you're gonna obviously get better
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.320]  and better flips is there something to i know you were saying the bruised aspects and i remember
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.680]  like when i go to like underground atlanta and shit and trying to meet people that were
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.840]  trying to meet somebody like you to be honest um they all right what what you want white boy what's
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.080]  up white boy and i'd be like i want the stuff with the with the purple rings and you go down
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.800]  there and individuals had that kind of stuff sometimes it would be like a little bit of a
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.120]  bluish color sometimes it wouldn't necessarily be a ring it would be more of just like it seemed
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.560]  like it was through the stock through the the cap is is any of that is there any truth to the fact
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:25.440]  that that's where the the medicine aspects was so if you're eating more of the the bruise you're
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.800]  gonna trip harder or is that just people in the hood trying to trying to you know sell sell it the
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.720]  way that they wanted to sell it bro it's just like back at the cannabis game and whatever the top
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:43.440]  strain is and you were going to go get some weed from somebody guess what he had that strength but
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.400]  he you know he wasn't true to the game about it you know what i mean he was just like he knew you
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.880]  needed oh i got some just so he can make a buck but that if you didn't have it you should just
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:58.880]  say it i didn't have it is my point but uh yes i think they were just doing that as a selling
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.840]  point brian they was just trying to be so they were just bruising it because i was i was done
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.760]  telling them what i wanted instead of saying hey what y'all got i was over here being like what's
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:12.080]  up you know purple stems that's what we're up to oh yeah we got it yeah we got it here it is right
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:17.680]  here check it out got that whatever you want somebody's got it hold on i'll be right back
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:24.400]  okay yeah you're right right um i used to hear all the time man the cap the cap is good for for
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.320]  you know that you can see in the and in the uh the stem is more for body because it's connected
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:37.760]  to the dirt and i was like huh it has the same amount of psilocybin it does in the cap than it
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:46.160]  does in the stem so and i'm probably saying something that you probably didn't understand
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.440]  psilocybin psilocybin there's two components mainly in a mushroom psilocybin and psilocin
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:00.960]  psilocybin is when you ingest it that's the psilocybin part of it the psilocin part of it
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:07.520]  is the part that has been uh extra you know or digested or whatnot that is the part that
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:13.840]  is responsible for those oh man did you see the carpet move that's that part of it so yeah i would
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:21.520]  say um it's a selling point they was trying to get you on dog next time tell them hey if it don't
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:28.080]  look like this i don't want it i'm sure they won't come up with it well i was i was very naive back
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.680]  then you know what i mean i and that's why i was saying there are certain people in my life
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.080]  there's one dude named gone so the dude named roderick uh they were looking out for me because
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:42.240]  they saw me trying to achieve something but i was uh didn't didn't have the right blueprint
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.240]  and i was riding around with stupid stuff you know i was just being really stupid so
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.320]  i think there's a lot to learn from that and now here we are you know obviously
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:57.360]  probably two decades later and we're able to have a podcast about uh a mushrooms you know and taking
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.400]  it to the next level uh of where it's actually like a medicinal thing for not only yourself
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.480]  but hopefully for your family especially people that uh are addicted to certain aspects uh cannabis
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.200]  and mushrooms seem to be able to alleviate some of that stuff uh for some individuals
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.560]  more for some than others you're exactly right with that i say the mix with both
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:28.400]  uh mushrooms and cannabis is powerful bro and i'm sure you can both attest that uh once you're on
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.080]  mushrooms it's like they they compliment anything bro i can drink it's like i don't even drink
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:39.280]  i could sit on a beer probably for four hours before they like damn dog you gonna finish that
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:48.080]  or what's up bro but yeah once you're you're there you're there on it it's not no um what is it i
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:53.200]  should say where it's not really a turn back so once you're you're cruising i would say just keep
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:59.840]  cruising don't don't turn back don't listen to other people be around people that are happy
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.600]  don't be around the people that are creating stress with you when you're going to be doing
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.800]  the mushrooms or whatnot because it's not going to be a good experience for you
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.600]  so what are like what are the numbers like on on that man like as far as just you know
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.560]  market-wise we talk a lot about um you know entrepreneurship and everything and obviously
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:26.320]  you can't get that at a dispensary um and is it better for you you know i see a lot of people
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:31.600]  going to chocolates and candies is that a better option or people want more of the raw
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.960]  i have a mix of a couple different uh family members and a couple veterans and whatnot that
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:46.240]  they like the mushrooms but they don't like the taste man it tastes like 10 burnt sunflower seeds
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.680]  and eight aspirin even chewed up at one time i ain't playing i'm telling you they do not taste
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:57.360]  good am i lying brian you know what i'm talking about marco that's good that's why lemon tech was
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.080]  was developed in my opinion because yeah that that was no one wants to to taste that
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:11.960]  hard to get down even in a chocolate form that long yeah you need chocolate like i am going by
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:18.920]  the the fancy brookside stuff that has the acai berries and shit and that because it really masked
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:26.120]  it really masked the taste but uh you know in the hood back in the day they would just take half a
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:31.240]  half a gram or full gram they would put them in ice cube trays with the chocolate and then they
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.800]  would wrap them in tinfoil and then you would see them at the bars and you know all the dudes just
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.560]  be passing them out to all the college kids and they were getting 25 sometimes getting more
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:47.000]  depending on how like goofy the person was but yeah they were getting at least 25 per thing and
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.280]  you would just see them in their freezer you know just stacking these trays up so you know in the
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:57.320]  gray market man when you see opportunity there's a lot to this and you can you can grow mushrooms in
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.800]  an apartment like if you're trying to get yourself out of an apartment into a home this might be
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:07.960]  another opportunity for people that uh don't mind a little risk calculated risk in life um you know
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.080]  there's always risk to reward and that kind of stuff but uh i think the tide has turned from
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:19.320]  this also for the most part i think law enforcement sees it as uh something less than you know there's
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:24.040]  a lot of other things like meth fentanyl things that they're they're worried about so this is
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:30.440]  more of just like kind of riding that wave of a new market that will open up see that candy there
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.120]  brian you meant y'all mentioned candy it's a better taste so i've been in the lab man i made
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:43.400]  some hard candy right made some hard candies with thc and mushrooms in them one time
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:51.640]  see and that's that's some hood stuff like you're not going to necessarily find that because
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.240]  as far as i understand there's nowhere that where that could exist where you could have thc and uh
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:03.000]  psilocybin in a product together legally and buy it legally and you can see the mushrooms
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.840]  the red ones and the purple ones so you got to find an og and they don't come out of the
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.280]  woodwork so that's why this this show was fun for me man it's kind of going down memory lane for me
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.800]  all those years we were hanging out great memory lane you like the new wave candy man like when i
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.720]  was a kid we had the candy man he'd the one house brothers go to willie wonka style baby
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:37.720]  willie wonka style bro you mentioned uh marco about the um the prop not doing the uh
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:50.800]  about the what is that something i can speak on no what'd you say again yeah you just uh froze on us
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.840]  oh they're trying to i think i lost you try it try it again we just couldn't hear you kind of
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:12.280]  froze up for a sec all right can you hear me now yes sir hey real quick since we're having a bit of
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:19.400]  an issue uh they're saying if you could like can i talk about that wait one second if you could um
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.200]  if you could kind of just fix your mic and just keep it where it's at i guess it's kind of getting
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:33.050]  a lot of you know static um and then we didn't hear what you said because you froze sorry about
[01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:38.170]  that i was going to ask because marco had mentioned about the numbers on it like meaning numbers like
[01:27:38.890 --> 01:27:45.530]  profitability or how much is it going to cost you in the streets or yeah street numbers so when people
[01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:54.470]  are out there looking they don't get ripped off like what is you know what i mean um it's safe to
[01:27:54.470 --> 01:28:04.470]  say you're gonna probably spend somewhere between 50 and 100 dollars an eighth 3.5 grams
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:15.160]  and i would say that really hasn't changed in a long long time man that's what it was in college
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.880]  that's what i remember it was like we got our eighth and me and my buddy uh homie alex quick
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:30.440]  shout out alex from virginia beach um you know and uh we split that bad boy to 50 bucks
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:36.360]  whoa see now it's gonna change that's you know that's standard uh it's not like we're gonna go
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.760]  to dispensary you know i mean hey man sell me an eighth you can go across the street and get one
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.840]  yourself you know it's different than the mushroom game and it seems like to me
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.160]  one of my buddies uh shout out mike chambers down at uh one of the grocery stores he's a
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:01.080]  he's a fun guy guy i should say he went to class and went to school and did all that but he told
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:07.000]  me he said bro when you get into this there once you meet one person that's looking for him i
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.720]  guarantee there's eight to ten more of his his or her friends that are looking for that same thing so
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.960]  just be careful i was like yeah man i'm just it's nothing about none of that street shit for me it's
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:22.360]  all about i need to help somebody not feel the way i felt that's where it's at for me
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:29.880]  i can worry about getting paid later on with you know you know other stuff uh maybe i can get
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.600]  picked up with a company i can show them some things that'd be great but my whole goal is just
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.360]  to show somebody else how i feel like man i used to feel like shit my girl tell you all today man
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.280]  what's wrong with you i'd be like i don't know babe but you know we go through this and that
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.160]  it's just mostly i just need to be on some strong but i can't do it all the time though you know
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:59.000]  what i mean so uh it's it's a great break um it's a great restart to the brain man i cannot say it
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.200]  enough like i cannot say it enough that is a restart to the brain it gets you going meaning
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:12.440]  like you feel so good and you don't even know why like why am i smiling why am i smiling i'm doing
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:17.800]  the dishes what is there to smile about i'm doing dishes but it's just something about it like
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:23.720]  it just brings it out of you but yeah uh going back to what you said marco uh that's about the
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:29.880]  going price you said from back in college now there are some strains that will put you at like
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:34.120]  you know four or five hundred dollars an ounce 28 grams
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:44.120]  crazy i'll tell you one of them is hawaiian shout out to uh shout out to uh uh uh my boy
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:50.520]  robbie a nurse's an ex he told me about the hawaiian they a normal dose of these hawaiian
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:31:01.160]  strain of mushrooms is 0.2 and a high dose is 0.8 so we're talking about less than a gram and
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:09.160]  you're done so i would definitely say uh the pricing depending on what you get if you you get
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:17.960]  with someone that knows uh you know the different species of mushrooms and you know the everybody
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:25.160]  knows the cabenzies but not everybody knows the kaisans you know or the next uh version of uh
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:31.560]  shirians or whatnot not everybody knows all the other ones that they just know like you said uh
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.600]  they know penis envy they definitely know golden teacher but they don't know hawaii
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:43.640]  or some of the other strains where you can take only less than less than a gram less
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:51.400]  than a gram full dose less than a gram that's pretty wild man so is that like because it seems
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:57.320]  like the spores are kind of your reset it costs kind of each time are you able to keep these
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:03.560]  strains like we do you know with cannabis or does it kind of like you have to rely on that guy that's
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:09.800]  got that sterile you know laboratory environment to get your spores from well because they're kind
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.520]  of cost efficient now uh you can go two ways like you said if you want to keep buying them that's
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:22.280]  cool they're gonna cost you somewhere between 20 and like 30 40 bucks um a syringe which is like 10
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:30.520]  cc's or you can buy that that one time and do those extract instructions i told you and i'm gonna say
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:38.280]  them real quick get you some corn or some rice with that needle shoot it up wait for that bag to
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:44.440]  turn white add some sterile substrate to it and then once that turns white and then the mushrooms
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:50.280]  start to grow and here's the important part when you ask me about the spores okay once the mushroom
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:57.560]  grows before the cap opens cut it cut the mushroom out cut one of those mushrooms out okay and once
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:03.160]  again you didn't washed you didn't wash washed your tail you got in the shower you didn't put two
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.320]  pairs of gloves on and you didn't put alcohol and rubbed it down in between so i'm sterile
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:13.320]  sterile when i'm doing this i'll take that one mushroom and i'll cut the top the cap part off of
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:19.480]  it okay i'm gonna take the cap off from the stem and i'm just taking the cap and i'm going to get
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:27.480]  a little piece of aluminum i'm gonna put the cap on to that piece of aluminum okay now i'm gonna
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:33.960]  take that cap and that aluminum and i'm gonna put it in like um one of the little containers
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:40.520]  sandwich containers or whatnot that you can close the top on airtight yes airtight and i'm
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:45.960]  gonna put it in one of them cabinets 24 hours later i'm gonna go and open that and guess what
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:57.000]  happened the spore that is on the bottom of the cap fell onto the aluminum foil and you're probably
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  like what the hell does that mean there's your spore right there so all you have to do now is
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.520]  get you some good water and uh scratch scratch the spore that you have on that aluminum foil
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:14.600]  very softly put a couple drops of water and get a syringe and suck it back into the syringe
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:21.480]  and now you have that spore again bro we ain't buying shit else boom i like that man i was hoping
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:27.320]  it was that simple because that that's how it needs to be save your own spores man try to keep
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.640]  you know we're all about saving that money man being self-sufficient so that's dope once you get
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.160]  it you can keep those strains going is that is that i bet that's kind of easy to mess up so i'd
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:42.520]  imagine you want to kind of hedge your bets and do several little of these little containers and try
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.960]  to spore them out kind of to make sure you're getting uh you know most bang for your buck
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:53.640]  what do you think about that i would say keep a couple spores every time you grow some mushrooms
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.840]  you need to be cutting because you're going to cut them anyway when they're done
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.360]  you might as well save one for the next round you always have to can't hear you i can't hear you at
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:06.120]  all you got to get that mic right back in front of your face mj we're not being able to hear you at
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:14.040]  all i would say you should be able to get two or three different strains you should always be able
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.920]  to have something for the next round without having to buy so i'm going to say this let's
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.000]  say everything crashed in i don't have a job or anything but i need to start some more shrooms
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.840]  i don't have no money to buy none and i sure don't know nobody where i can go and get a syringe from
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:36.280]  so i'm going to keep this mushroom i'm going to cut it because it's ready and i'm going to
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:43.240]  cut the top of it off from the stem very carefully with a exacto knife or something that's sterile
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:50.040]  okay once i cut that put it back on that aluminum foil and cover it airtight for 24 hours when i
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.760]  come back out and lift that cap the spores on the bottom now i have another spore so yeah i would say
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:04.680]  keep three four strains you're gonna try this the kits to grow these men have marco let me let me
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.920]  say this how many companies are going to tell you the easy way they want you to buy all that
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:18.520]  shit man and you're my your mic hold that mic close almost how's that there you go all right
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:24.280]  so i got you so what kind of time okay let's say you do you know something happened the person lost
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:31.880]  their income what's what's that time from flip all right boom start today 30 days boom okay and then
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.480]  now what kind of what is it for drying there's nothing like cannabis right you just want to air
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:42.920]  dry dry and then you're done yeah i'd air dry 24 hours um 24 hours uh just you know out on the
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:50.840]  counter somewhere somewhere preferably where it's dark 24 hours and they're done i wouldn't use it
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.160]  i wouldn't use a dehydrator um everybody has a dumb moment maybe we didn't press the right settings
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:03.880]  and eight hours later it's dust now do you now here's my thing i remember distinctly uh college
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:09.480]  days they were very crispy you know we were breaking it was crispy you know as now do you
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.360]  want them more like a marshmallow you know now that people are kind of sore so that we're going
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:20.680]  for a couple people a lot of people like them different ways i know um one of my buddies he
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:29.160]  likes them anyway and you know like my girlfriend she'll only eat them with like uh you know a mango
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.720]  slice or something like that but i don't like the mushy i'd prefer than you know i want to chew it
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.640]  up like a cracker and be done and get it out like i want to chew it up and be done with it if i'm
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:44.200]  going to chew a real one uh the crunchy ones are better for me but i can let me say this the fresh
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:50.360]  mushrooms are stronger than the dry ones but they don't last as long and they taste better
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.600]  okay that makes sense so now you got to watch your weight too with your what your moisture
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.920]  i would imagine because there's a big difference from kind of moist to kind of crispy you know i
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:11.640]  know you said that right 90 90 percent water loss so that 10 gram mushroom you pull when it's dry
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:18.120]  it's only gonna be one gram oh okay that was great that's a that's a bar right there 10 to 1
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:26.760]  10 to 1 and you already know it's 10 to 1 wet to dry so if you only want to eat one gram marco
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.640]  and you say i want to eat the fresh ones now you got to eat 10 grams of mushrooms
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.760]  that's like a salad from wendy's bro you ain't gonna do that yeah
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.400]  hey and marco it seems like the fresh ones are the uh the ones that that mess up people's stomachs
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:52.280]  the most yes okay you're having more volume and you're having a way higher chance of having to
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.160]  you know go to the bathroom when everybody else is having fun because imagine remember how your
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:03.640]  stomach felt when you did that what one gram now you ate 10 grams that's a salad that's rough
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.920]  rough on the body man now you're tripping and thinking about what your stomach's doing
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.680]  now you're yeah you're tripping with a messed up stomach that's that's going in reverse
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.600]  oh man in the bathroom just watching the shower curtain move and shit like this is not a good
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:28.680]  feeling hey since you're talking about in the bathroom i would mention uh when you walk by
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:35.640]  mirrors and stuff um do not yeah and you're probably going to now that we're fucking saying
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:42.360]  this but um there there is something to looking at yourself tripping like that and i promise you
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:47.240]  if you've done it one time you don't really want to do it again for whatever reason it's just not
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.640]  something that's advised uh but again it's up to you you probably are gonna fucking do it now like
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.320]  but you're not gonna do it again is the thing because we warned you then you're gonna do it
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.320]  and then you're gonna be like they fucking warned me about that shit and then you won't do it again
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.000]  so just don't even glance at your face like just don't even look at
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.640]  ah man and that's that's another part of like sometimes going public like if people can see
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:16.360]  your eyeballs and stuff people freak the fuck out or at least they don't really say anything
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:22.840]  but their body language just like freaks the fuck out you know like it's always a yeah like a
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.520]  pullback reaction and then some of those that have been in the game for a little while like yourself
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.960]  have already known if you're gonna be out in the public man you definitely got to be wearing some
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:37.560]  glasses and number two i prefer you wearing glasses number two if you're not wearing glasses
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.280]  don't look at somebody in their face while you're talking to them kind of look over them kind of
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.600]  like over their head or over their ear or something like that because the worst experience is
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.200]  like me i'll look at you until you blink away like i'm interested in what you're saying i'm giving
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:58.200]  you my full thousand percent of of me to tell you i'm interested but you're not going to do that on
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.800]  mushrooms i guarantee you're not gonna do that when you see somebody's eye blink and just slide
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.920]  down the side of their face you don't know how to like look at them again like dude your fucking
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.840]  eyeball is gone like it just blinked you blinked your eye and it's gone like what happened
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.240]  you're not gonna want to have that feeling like you said like i don't want my stomach to feel and
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.040]  be tripping i definitely don't want to see nothing happen looking at your forehead you know wink or
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.280]  like there's an eyeball up there i don't want to have none of them feelings like that bro definitely
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:33.400]  don't so those two gram tuesdays there's a lot of laughing going on sounds like like just tripping
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.280]  it's not laughing dude it's giggling yeah it's grown men giggling
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:47.000]  grown man giggling yeah that two gram tuesday shout out to jason liker that's my dog him and

[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:57.320]  a bruh in the hood i don't know about no damn mushrooms but yeah shout out to them they always
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.960]  came through like dude let's do two grams on tuesday i was like why on a tuesday i'm off
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.080]  tomorrow tonight's my friday i was like dude we all gotta go to work you know only went at home
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.840]  texting us how y'all feeling like dude we're struggling you already know that while you sleep
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.520]  oh man two gram tuesdays i don't know if i can do that again
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:24.040]  maybe 2.5 we ain't going down we'll move up we'll progress but we definitely ain't going down
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.480]  well coach always said you either get better or you get worse but you don't stay the same
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:36.440]  ever so yeah we definitely gonna do a little bit more um would you be opposed to trying
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:46.280]  um some candy or uh in a pill form i i wouldn't be opposed i mean like i know
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:53.240]  brian he don't care how you do it you could put a worm on it and give it to him and it must
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.880]  like that worm the muscle
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.720]  no man that eating the the raw ones bothers me like i chew it up with chocolate i don't know i
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.120]  think you had frozen but i was joking like i even spent a little extra money to get the fancy
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.640]  chocolate so i don't have to taste it's it's a it's a nightmare getting it down but it's worth
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.160]  it it's worth that because it's 15 minutes especially if the candies if you did you know
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.400]  you got your dosing in there man and there's somebody can kind of get that consistency that
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:29.560]  that's i'm sure would be a winner you know that's well the way he's doing it is like you know that's
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.680]  like the the hood way you know like you go all right i want four candies all right that's gonna
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.320]  cost you 100 bucks because they're in the chocolates um and again that's a way to make
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:45.080]  you know nice little you know it's you know weird thing man there weren't a lot of people that used
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:51.080]  to sell mushrooms and there was like uh there's a bar what's that bar on colfax everybody goes to
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:58.040]  it's like a stuff uh it starts with a c i think something right you know what i'm talking about
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:04.040]  mj west colfax near downtown they got they got like uh late night bands and all that stuff you
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:08.120]  could get you can get any drug there to be honest with you but i remember back in the day that
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.040]  there'd be a lot of like a lot of mushroom people there and they always just seemed like they had
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.440]  unbelievable amount of money compared to all the other people that are trying to hustle there
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:27.400]  sir vontage yes that place if you're a if you're a tourist and you have nowhere to go go to
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:34.280]  servantes stand around for a little bit and somebody's it's like being in jamaica somebody's
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.480]  gonna come up to you and be like hey hey bro what you looking for you look like you're new here you
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:44.280]  know what are you doing yeah that place is wild but anyway those individuals man they would be
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:48.440]  flipping them a little chocolates out of the ice cube trays that's the way i've always seen it being
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:55.560]  done man cheap easy process 25 dollars boom yeah but it's still consistent it's pretty consistent
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.920]  but look i thought about something you know when you eat mushrooms the nutrients aren't unlocked
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:07.240]  until they're cooked for your stomach i feel like and then the chat just said um kaiser soze said
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:13.800]  the titan is what fucks with your stomach yes i feel like that you know not cooked fungi is what's
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:21.960]  actually motherfucking with your stomach um i think you said he said it was chitin c-h-i-t-i-n
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:28.120]  that's right uh-huh that i did believe and i have a little note on that because someone's i knew
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:34.200]  someone was gonna ask about that you give me two seconds i'm gonna find that part of it oh yeah
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.280]  there you go because i know cooking it is what breaks that kind of down and lets your stomach
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.600]  and your body absorb the nutrients so don't get raw mushrooms on your salad oh don't just do that
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:50.120]  please don't yeah just do it the og way stop trying to do all that new stuff for uh what is it
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.760]  tick tock and all that you trying to create something just go with what people say do the
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:00.120]  original thing don't try and venture out until you know what you're doing i should say don't make no
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:09.160]  mistakes like we did early in the game um oh there's a oh while you're looking for that i was
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.840]  just gonna say there's a famous place if you ever do go to the south the place i think it's on it
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.240]  might be nationwide now but it's called mellow mushroom and it's like a trippy pizza looking
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:25.560]  place but the first one was in uh in athens georgia and they used to have like a secret
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:29.720]  thing on the on the menu that you could order that and you could get like a mellow mushroom
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:35.480]  pizza and that would be that you you had ordered like a pizza that you're going to trip on so that
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.360]  was uh that was like a little secret code back in the day um so yeah these these things have been
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.720]  around for a long time i'm just glad that it can be mainstream without people kind of
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:52.200]  feeling a certain way about about talking about it in the open i found it okay so we i remember
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:57.640]  you touched bases on the lemon tech and one of the reasons why i'm bringing this up because that
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:04.360]  is under lemon tech one of the causes it reduces nausea the acid in the lemon juice is thought to
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:11.320]  break down some of the the chitin in the shrooms cell walls this is one of the main suspects for
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:18.920]  nausea experience on magic mushrooms throughout the body and they were pretty much saying if you
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:24.920]  suffer from a very badly uh from a nausea uh mushroom tea might be for you
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:34.520]  as you need not to consume any chitin c-h-i-t-i-n that is the part that the mushroom that gets you
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:40.520]  or makes you feel uneasy in the stomach and nauseated marco when we're are we saying tomato
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:47.960]  tomato like is that chitin is it the same thing yeah chitin that's right it smelled like chitin
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:54.520]  yep i used to say that way yeah yeah well however it's a tomato tomato thing but
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:48:00.120]  uh that's eye opening that that's what causes that because that's a a thing that i use to kind
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:08.760]  of like develop uh the the crustaceans exoskeletons and stuff correct yeah yeah definitely they love
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:19.960]  that well uh i got okay question now uh i'm just gonna touch base to what marco said about
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:28.200]  on the numbers who like you know we've been out of not all out of cannabis i don't pretty much
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.760]  deal with cannabis unless it's just something special i want to do personally but who is
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.800]  messing around with cannabis and why let me i'm not i take that back because that kind of sounds
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:43.400]  bad let me keep it on a high positive note why wouldn't you not be able to craft your own
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:49.320]  mushroom why are you growing weed when you can craft your own mushroom and make if you're trying
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.400]  to make money why would you be able to make a very minimum of sixty four hundred dollars a pound
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:59.480]  mushrooms let me let me just throw that out there y'all sixty four hundred with limited growers to
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:04.760]  compete with right that's why i was saying with that cervantes please uh you know i mean like if
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.440]  you can find the right place to just flip stuff people when they're especially when they're dry
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:15.160]  man 25 and shit it sure ain't there's nothing i mean yeah so look what you're getting into before
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.080]  you get into if you're just gonna trip and trip go ahead and do that but if you're trying to
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.200]  do other things know what the numbers look like know what if it's waste worth your time
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.640]  by all means grow your cannabis if you smoke cannabis because then you're paying yourself
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:35.640]  every time you grow it anyway but also grow mushrooms like fuck yeah like look at the
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:41.480]  numbers and then think about cannabis how like the market is it changes volatile you don't know
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.000]  what you get mushrooms at least you know from even from a patient standpoint everything is
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.840]  sterile you know what i mean so it's a very clean product if you really want to serve people and do
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:58.600]  good you know so something to think about very yeah i'm glad you said that as far as being sterile
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.840]  this isn't cannabis where we have to take it to the lab and have it tested before you put it on
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:09.480]  the uh the shelves for selling if your mushrooms don't turn out and look good all the time the way
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.680]  they're supposed to uh they're probably not good and you're gonna know they're not gonna even grow
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.360]  because they're gonna mold out instead of that whole bag turning white it's gonna turn green so
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:27.800]  nothing's gonna grow so uh marco's exactly right it's very very sterile uh when we come to mushrooms
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:33.480]  if you have them you know that they're coming from a reliable uh clean source because it has
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:40.040]  to be very clean uh and sterile for them to actually grow i should say i mean and that's
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.440]  that's pretty dope if you think about it because if you look at cannabis you know everybody can
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:48.840]  grow this and they can grow pretty much in anything loaded with chemicals and everything else
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:57.080]  but when you have that mushroom the the fact that it grew is the proof that it's clean
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:04.520]  that's dope that's dope i like that and then um there's some people um you know we are talking i
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:09.320]  think we're touch bases on the different ways of consume but there's some people that you guys will
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:14.600]  see this here soon but some people just like it in the pill form they don't want to have a taste
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.400]  they don't want to like you know ryan said he masses up with some of that good good chocolate
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.280]  go diva or whatnot but uh yeah some people don't like it they just want to chew it up put it in a
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.240]  pill or something you can do that if you want to put it in a pill and eat it that way uh but if not
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:35.000]  you want to be a hero tonight man go ahead and dive your ass into eating some of this
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:40.920]  does that feel a little like caps is it the capsule yeah and it's got a dose in there
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:47.880]  yeah so we stuff these these are and the reason why we did these shout out to my girlfriend tanya
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:55.560]  um the reason why we did these is because they're exactly the same amount every time i don't want to
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.120]  take this big old thing not knowing what this but i know exactly what this is what's that little one
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:06.200]  right there how much was that just pill or well how much in the pill and how much was in that
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:13.800]  little shroom you were holding so in this in the pill they're 0.30 each okay and it's mushroom
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:17.960]  let's bring it to the scale bring it to the scale let's find out
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.520]  you want to know that we're gonna find out right now but i would say just weighing this
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:33.240]  in my hand probably two grams two point five a nice cured finished mushroom right there ready
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:41.560]  for consumption dry i could drop it nothing breaks off or anything sorry about that but
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:48.840]  yeah it's nice and dry and when it comes to uh like using this as a medicine you know point
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:54.120]  especially when you're first starting out like a couple points off uh matters so when you're
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:53:01.640]  using these scales uh especially over time a lot of them aren't um accurate anymore so an old hood
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:07.160]  trick would be to use a nickel it's always five grams on point so if you're using this to to
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:14.040]  measure out drugs if you will uh your medicine um you put the nickel on there first to make sure
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.840]  it's accurate or if it's off then you obviously calculate whichever way it's off to make sure you
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:25.400]  don't overdose or underdose that damn brian's a goddamn og run talk to him with that nickel shit
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:32.760]  yeah put the nickel on it put the nickel on it definitely that reminds me of the old boys with
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:38.360]  the scale the beam the little whole mail letter holder you put the nickel on that thing that's
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.000]  back before you had that good quality because it used to be like man you can't you gotta have a
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.080]  scale to measure that you can't eyeball that good you know definitely yeah nobody wants to give
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:54.440]  anything away so you weigh that shit out in front of everybody or when you you and your homie like a
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:54:01.000]  bridge yeah exactly if you had to split a bag you say all right well you divide the bag and i pick
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:08.520]  or i divide and you pick yeah amen to that and let me say this if whoever you're giving
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:13.480]  you're getting your shrooms from if they don't give you no shrooms they ain't shit
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.680]  wait what are you saying i'm gonna say that one more time nobody understood this
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:27.800]  if the person you're getting your shrooms from don't just give them to you he ain't shit
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.400]  lean back and argue you're thinking you're like no no i what you're saying is like
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.120]  i guess he should have so many clientele like the first time you're talking to him he should
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:46.360]  just kind of let you maybe get a couple grams on him i love what you're saying say it again brian
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.480]  usually and that backs up again i guess how i my experience usually these boys that are hustling
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.680]  in this manner have the income and they they have such an income and they have such a
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:04.840]  uh inventory that they should be able to give you like a sample like you're at costco baby
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.680]  over there eating good uh walking around thank you thank you thank you for clearing that up

[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:37.080]  now that energy was uh was contagious uh i saw right there marco we were trying to uh
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:41.800]  start to to have more of like a structure for the show so london if you wanted to pop on to
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:49.160]  that intermission we were uh we just roll right on through it yeah but so uh for our audience
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:55.480]  rolling through man yeah okay well i just want the audience to know that london myself and marco
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.160]  we've been thinking about some things behind the scenes so i think you'll see some improvements as
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:04.440]  as it goes on really trying to think about you guys as well uh so we appreciate feedback good
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:09.720]  bad or whatever but yeah we want to move into 2023 where we're bringing you individuals uh you know
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:15.080]  in part i i hope uh that you appreciate that you might not not necessarily ever heard from before
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:21.160]  so um i to to me and marco you know that part of that's also important it's like yeah we we can
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:26.120]  listen to a lot of the same talking heads and sometimes that's important because uh you know
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:30.120]  they're talking heads for a reason and they you know when they speak there's a reason to listen
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:35.800]  to them uh every time uh but also on the flip side of that there's so many uh smart individuals
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:41.160]  that i would consider more in the gray underground world you know people that i you know my whole
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:45.800]  life i've kind of like felt like i always kind of bonded with uh they were just people that that we
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:51.720]  always had fun with one of the one of the best uh memories i have with mj was meeting him downtown
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:57.800]  at a concert uh there's like this b-level rapper his name was spice one uh and this was right when
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:04.680]  like dabs were coming out marco right so i somehow it like gets around spice one we get down to vip
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:11.880]  and we are smoking this dude down like everybody's just burning uh by the way right yeah
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:18.680]  hard he'd never smoked dabs before so right before he's going on stage he's picking up his
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:22.920]  computer and making sure he's going over his lyrics and he's like kind of making fun of us
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.280]  and himself that we got him so fucked up off the dabs that he was like man i'm gonna forget my
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:33.400]  lyrics man hold on a second like he kicked us out like 10 minutes beforehand so he could go over his
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.880]  stuff uh and that was something i always remember because mj was just sitting on the cross for me
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:43.560]  in this little tiny i guess that's uh where vip happens uh it's like the really tiny rooms um and
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:49.880]  just giggling again just having fun man and that was uh that was a great night and i i would imagine
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:54.760]  you remember that night but it was just fun to uh you know to see him then go on stage and kind of
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:00.040]  like fumble his words a little bit cut it short i don't know it's just funny i remember that at
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:08.120]  night that night exactly ben was there uh you were there uh jc was there uh there was like four
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:15.800]  or five of my best friends shout out to natalie simone shout out to natalie simone my best friend
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:20.600]  yeah yeah you're talking uh i know exactly who you're talking about yes you are yes my best
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:25.720]  friend my business partner i thought that so close i thought that was your lady for like the first
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:29.480]  year i knew you i don't know why everybody keeps thinking everybody's like is that your girlfriend
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:34.280]  i was like no it's my best friend like may y'all pop up at every show together why would people
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:39.880]  think that consistency you got to show up all the time but yeah man um that'd be rude that'd be me
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:49.320]  like asking marco be like who's nicky he's like hey bro you when you're this age you just assume
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:54.120]  everybody is that man's wife and respect and proceed that way and it won't be no trouble
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:01.080]  true brian that night you're talking about i'll never forget because you guys had a dab bowl
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.320]  that i still have the picture of it we have a clipper lighter inside sideways it's like a
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:13.720]  shot glass they had i was like holy shit but dude he hit that dab and i was like this dude is done
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.840]  i just sat there and kind of chuckled and more importantly dude asked me about some song he was
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:23.960]  like he remembered this song such and such and i was like i don't really listen to spice one all
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.520]  like i know all the words or anything like that so i definitely remember that day no i remember he
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.320]  was quizzing you almost like a he started to be a jerk about it you know he's like man you don't
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.800]  know such and such i was like no but ask me some pink floyd shit please ask me some of that we
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:44.440]  don't go all talk about that all night but yeah i didn't i know the disrespect to uh no disrespect
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.600]  uh to spice one but i didn't i didn't you know i didn't know it all the time and then bro we've
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.720]  been doing like nine dabs i'm fucked up i don't know nothing right now yeah that was when we first
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:58.840]  like i said we first getting into him and the reason i knew who he was was uh because of tupac
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.920]  but i guess if you hadn't really necessarily listened to all that you might not know who that
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:09.320]  was 187 he wrote one of our roommates because i was like 92 90 i got graduated high school 92
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:15.320]  so i was in college right around then we had a roommate that would say spice one was the hardest
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.280]  rapper he's harder than anybody you know do you know those guys that always just ride with a guy
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:26.200]  and spice one was his guy so that's how i ended up really you know just rocking with him a little
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:32.840]  bit but he had some good stuff man you know he was super cool to us and stuff yeah i just thought it
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:38.280]  was fun because like you know you're hanging out yeah it's like seeing somebody that go on stage
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:43.880]  it's like oh man i don't know what the computer looking at yeah what are you doing like we didn't
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:49.320]  do it on purpose or anything it just we were back there for probably a good hour hour and a half it
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:56.440]  felt like and then yeah he went on stage goodness he was he was on stage less less time than we were
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:05.000]  backstage i remember that sauce yeah the saucy sauce shout out to uh fuck man uh sasquatch yeah
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:12.280]  uh because that's who we were we were smoking a duke diamonds gear that was done by sasquatch
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:21.960]  503 before um sullivan and all that stuff even existed right and that was like the new new new
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:26.280]  nobody nobody even knew what the hell we were talking about i think that's why we were invited
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.120]  man that might have been like 16 15 what year was this
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:39.800]  this was a while ago bro 16 okay okay yeah y'all had that loud that was my
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.240]  my i know my son was only one or two years old and he's seven
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:55.560]  so oh wow so yeah it's probably like 16 2016 17 when it and it wasn't like at first we were uh
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.880]  marco we were blasting the stuff into two there's just like the straight glass tube
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:03.960]  and you'd be doing it in like the backyard people didn't know what you were doing you're usually
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:09.000]  doing it at a party somebody somebody walk outside on the back deck and like start to light a
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.240]  cigarette everybody fucking freak out i mean the the uh what was the attention to detail and safety
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:21.160]  was was not there when this shit first started super low and now it's gone to where it's like
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:27.400]  it's a true art form man it's a it's amazing to me how quickly that's happened yeah you imagine
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:37.160]  true like the deep fried turkey exactly that deep fried turkey would get on them legs
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:45.800]  i couldn't imagine back in them days now that we've all touched bases on some on some mushrooms
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:53.320]  it's 2023 now so can you imagine knowing what you know now and you doing streams back 2016
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:06:00.920]  marco what was you doing 2016 16 i just went to vegas i think
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:07.800]  okay let's move out there doing a little stint in the commercial world right
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:17.320]  nothing wrong with that yeah yeah well where we're at right now where things are going i mean
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:21.800]  everybody's in their own lane doing their own thing and that's great you know do that that we
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:28.440]  need more of that that's where it's at um and i can just say for me i mean i and brian could
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:32.600]  probably attest to this i've worked a couple dispensaries and did this and that but to me
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:41.000]  we don't see eye to eye meaning what y'all doing at the dispensary i get it i grow at the crib i'm
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.960]  not i'm not in no hurry to get mine out in 30 days to put it on the shelf i don't care if it
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.960]  grow for nine weeks i don't give a darn you know i'm saying because it's going to be quality every
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:55.640]  time quality over anything take your time doing what you're doing it's 2023 all this shit we did
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:01.480]  in the past that is great we need to really we need to really focus on what we're doing going
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:07.320]  forward and i think with mushrooms uh in your system is definitely going to help you get to that
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:14.520]  happy fluffy positive i want to dance there ain't no music on right now type of get my party on or
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:20.840]  whatnot nobody knows about that until you actually try the medicine gotta try it you can't just
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:25.160]  listen to us talk about it you actually gotta dig in and try it you watch one of these days
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:31.320]  uh marco and brian i'm gonna do something crazy i'm probably gonna leave some medicine somewhere
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:36.280]  i'm gonna just go live somewhere i'm gonna be like here i'm here this is this boom you find it
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:42.520]  send me a text or whatever and let me know you got it that's what i'm trying to do i am yeah just
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:50.840]  like a seed drop a little secret seed drop secret that's it a little we almost speaking of seeds we
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:56.120]  almost started a seed company together back in the day we sure did that's how much i love this dude
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:04.200]  bees to see sweet seed hoarders seed hoarders there you go okay okay
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:10.520]  i got it got close but then of course we shit got uh it didn't work out man but that's what i mean
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:15.640]  by like being an entrepreneur you just keep it moving usually your first ideas don't work out
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:21.080]  uh but yeah man trying to find good people and putting things together and mj has always been
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:27.000]  i think it's more we bonded over the fact that like in a way we've come from kind of some of
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.760]  the same places and i think seeing certain things kind of humbles you realizes that being able to
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:38.840]  just grow old in life uh sometimes where you've come from is is winning the lottery as well
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:44.120]  and i think that's why a lot of individuals want to get out of certain places and you know you
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:48.680]  never really understand that until you've experienced it so that's something that i think
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:53.320]  mj and myself and others probably have always kind of bonded with is that you know trying to
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:58.040]  get your family level like that's level one then you know your lifetime you're just trying to get
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:03.000]  your your kin to level two you know and hopefully they get it to level three and as you move up
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:11.400]  more individuals are wanting to be a part of that um yeah man i hope that uh i hope that you find a
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:16.280]  lot of success brother because i know we were both trying to get into the cannabis game we were doing
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:21.560]  even the education over ego events uh and you know at first people i don't know if they were
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:26.520]  even rocking with it until you know we started meeting up with the denver normal crews and stuff
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:34.920]  um so yeah that memory lane but at the same time i think um you know seeing you start thriving and
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:42.840]  uh knowing it's um you know i don't know what the best way like i knew i knew it would come i guess
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.480]  like you're just too positive of an individual man like like and as i've gotten older we've
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:52.360]  talked on the show with marco i'm a true believer now in karma so like whatever you're putting into
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:57.080]  the world each and every day that shit's adding up and whether that takes years to you know
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.960]  eventually come to fruition i guess that's been on you and however you've carried yourself in life
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.080]  but eventually like if you carry yourself like my boy mj i think that things are going to come your
[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:11.800]  way in a very positive manner and you're going to start to see for yourself and i think that's where
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:17.000]  a lot of that comes from and when i first met you i didn't even have that in my life and now here i
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.920]  am all these years later buddy catching up with you and i feel like i got that man where i got
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.480]  that piece i feel like i have abundance i'm trying to just move and take care of my family
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:32.600]  and educate people over egos all day and like i said i'd say from the first day we met at i don't
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:39.720]  know which indo expo it was we took a picture and after that you came by the house showed you
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:45.000]  the grow this and that you know i was like come on in man i trust you come on in let's do what we
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.800]  do so you're thrived like you said we both come from somewhere where you know whatever we were
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.760]  doing kind of humbled us like i've seen some you know there's some other people's in the game that
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.760]  have shot straight up to the moon but are they happy and are they there are they there like
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:05.000]  in their heart are they there are they there just because they're getting they're going to get paid
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:11.240]  x amount of dollars like is your head into the game or is your pocket into the game and i think
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:17.160]  same thing you know you found your way uh we we touched uh well uh most a lot of the events we
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:23.560]  did it was talking about growing and your specialty i should say um with uh living soil so
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:30.920]  um i should say we're gonna do what we need to do to uh create for our family and probably leave a
[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.000]  legacy where somebody else one of the kids could say you know my daddy used to do this i used to
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.880]  watch him i don't know what he's doing but he did this all the time like i'm gonna if if he doesn't
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:44.360]  teach or your kids don't learn anything he's gonna learn consistency i don't know what my dad's doing
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:49.000]  but he's always in there from four to six every day i don't know what he's doing but he's there
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.920]  every day don't ask me what he's doing he's going to be doing that and i want to teach the same
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:57.640]  things like i said i want to teach the same thing with my kids like i got a shout out to my uh my
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:04.600]  son today i appreciate him little uh mike jack or michael jackson my son 19 in kansas uh out in
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:10.200]  college he's playing ball but yeah he was saying you know you all the time since i was three you've
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:15.720]  been doing you know doing what you've been doing and uh you know no one ever said hey man you want
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:19.800]  to come over here and do this and that you always kind of said you know i can't do that you know i
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.840]  got kids and this and that so i'm just gonna do what i can do but my kids has grown now man you
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:29.960]  know what i'm saying like you said we did we we've learned we've educated ourselves to get us somewhere
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:37.640]  man we need to start thinking and doing more for ourselves and start of always you know putting
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:42.440]  yourself in a predicament to help somebody else out we need to worry about ourselves first and we
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:49.800]  need to get our health together bros get in there to get your uh your physicals uh check with your

[02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:02.600]  whatever reason and now you listen you went home did your homework and wow you're a whole different
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:07.240]  person now sometimes you can't just talk to somebody you got to grab them by their hand
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.320]  and be like come on bro we're going around over here look come on get in the car we're going over
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:15.880]  here you can't just wait for them just you got to be persistent with hey man look what are you doing
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:21.480]  in 28 minutes i'm gonna be at your house i need you to ride with me all right bet and you have
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:25.960]  to go in there and you have to move them in that direction you know what i mean i don't hang out
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:33.080]  with a lot of my friends because of how they their their negativity i hear it every day from
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:39.480]  certain people that i work with you know uh but nothing big i listen to it um and then it bounces
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:46.680]  off me and i go on about my way what they say does not necessarily i i don't have to you know
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:51.960]  feed into what they got going on so stay in your own lane man stay in your own lane do what's good
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:15:01.130]  for you and mind your damn business more importantly talk to them and keep your mouth shut
[02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:07.770]  there it is that's rule number one keep your mouth shut new rule number one
[02:15:09.450 --> 02:15:13.050]  rule number two should be don't ask nobody for shit if you can't do it yourself
[02:15:14.650 --> 02:15:20.410]  yeah man you know i love that both of y'all have some positive points gold bars all the way around
[02:15:20.410 --> 02:15:27.450]  you know keep man do you you know do your thing a lot of times i'm the same way mj brian like
[02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:32.650]  if you don't see me you usually gotta come to where i'm at where where i'm doing my thing you
[02:15:32.650 --> 02:15:37.290]  know and then come out there and see me because we only got so much time in a day man i was talking
[02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:44.010]  to my my good buddy uh g w he came by the other day and um i was like you know how many times how
[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:48.490]  many hours have you spent watching me do shit you know what i mean and then i said how many hours
[02:15:48.490 --> 02:15:53.050]  have i spent watching you do shit you know i mean it's i spent a lot less time watching him do
[02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:59.210]  things so my point was hey bruh you only got so much time you know what i mean so you gotta get
[02:15:59.210 --> 02:16:03.370]  your stuff done too you know what i mean you're not getting really getting no benefit i know and
[02:16:03.370 --> 02:16:07.530]  then he said well i like listening to you talk og you know and i said well that's that's what's up
[02:16:07.530 --> 02:16:12.730]  too you know and then because see i just only look at it from that what did i get done point of view
[02:16:14.090 --> 02:16:18.170]  but i guess there is that aspect you know he learned some stuff while he was there too you
[02:16:18.170 --> 02:16:23.530]  know i mean so i guess that goes both ways so well if you're if you're learning especially from
[02:16:23.530 --> 02:16:29.210]  somebody like you then i would look at it as like a college degree like if i'm able to go to you as
[02:16:29.210 --> 02:16:34.970]  like a class then i'm spending the best amount of time as i can learning from you as quickly as i
[02:16:34.970 --> 02:16:40.810]  can so that i don't fuck up because that was both ways but you gotta do your homework too like mj was
[02:16:40.810 --> 02:16:45.930]  saying there is you gotta do your homework yeah well and that i think comes back again from like
[02:16:45.930 --> 02:16:51.850]  the old school style man you couldn't go to like an og that's trying to mentor you and you're asking
[02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:58.970]  a very basic or stupid questions you know you're definitely that's more of a guided hand than um
[02:16:58.970 --> 02:17:07.050]  you know a helping hand and then like here's another thing you you your profession you know
[02:17:07.050 --> 02:17:13.450]  when you were doing soil and you're still doing so i know um just because you're doing that and
[02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:18.410]  i'm your friend i don't think that please don't let me say this please don't think i'm gonna go
[02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:23.050]  to brian be like hey bro hook me up with some soil and he's probably gonna be like all right
[02:17:23.050 --> 02:17:26.650]  well let's get our hands dirty because that's you're gonna learn this you're not gonna just
[02:17:26.650 --> 02:17:30.650]  come to me and get it i mean i'll give it to you but i'd prefer you to learn to this so you could
[02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:35.290]  do it on your own to be you know do a spin-off and do your own thing that's where it should be not
[02:17:35.850 --> 02:17:42.250]  don't come to me and and ask hey bro i'm interested in doing this i don't care what it is that you're
[02:17:42.250 --> 02:17:47.930]  gonna do when you finish with your mushrooms that is none of my business my business is knowing that
[02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:53.610]  you are true to what you say if you say you want to learn and do this come on i'm gonna make some
[02:17:53.610 --> 02:17:58.330]  time for you my girl gonna be over here we're gonna do this whole class like we had two cooking
[02:17:58.330 --> 02:18:07.370]  classes this week where we made chocolates and hard candy pressing pills of mushrooms just so
[02:18:07.370 --> 02:18:13.370]  we can give these out to people to try that's it come back and holler at me when you're done
[02:18:13.370 --> 02:18:18.250]  when you figure this out like man you were right i feel so much better and i had to write now why i
[02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:24.650]  feel better i don't have no negative thoughts and let me flash and just say this um 83 percent of
[02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:30.170]  the veteran or the people that took this clinical test uh where they go to this clinic and they
[02:18:30.170 --> 02:18:35.050]  sleep overnight they have somebody sit there and watch them overnight 83 percent of them people
[02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:42.010]  have never had another bad thought again in one year test they did this 83 of the people
[02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:49.770]  so out of 10 people eight people never had those negative or bad dreams or thoughts or whatever
[02:18:49.770 --> 02:18:56.490]  it reset them like that so your question you should be asking yourself is what am i waiting for
[02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:03.690]  stop listening to the stereotypes you hear from oh dude i thought i was on uh you know everybody's
[02:19:03.690 --> 02:19:08.730]  gonna try and make their story better than the last story um i saw a witch or i whatever it is
[02:19:09.450 --> 02:19:15.210]  what about the people saying you know what i was depressed and now i know why i was depressed
[02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:21.210]  it makes you figure it out it makes you come in tune with yourself like oh i'm depressed because
[02:19:21.210 --> 02:19:25.210]  this triggers me this and that it's gonna help you guide your way through it and when you come
[02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:30.890]  back out of it that is gone and when something else comes that triggers you you know how to handle
[02:19:30.890 --> 02:19:38.170]  that it's that easy to me that's how i perceive it i don't know about uh how brian does it or
[02:19:38.170 --> 02:19:42.650]  marcos but for me that's how i perceive it like when i take this like i whatever was going on
[02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:50.490]  before is done but i need to make sure in my head that i'm ready to do that man i can't be thinking
[02:19:50.490 --> 02:19:54.170]  about man i get fired i've been thinking about this two weeks and then oh well let me take some
[02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:58.330]  mushrooms it'll go away no because that when the mushrooms go away i'm gonna feel like i'm fired
[02:19:58.330 --> 02:20:04.570]  it's like it's gonna go like it's not gonna go in a good direction for you so man i would say
[02:20:04.570 --> 02:20:11.290]  people do a little research point three point three point three if you want to start do point
[02:20:11.290 --> 02:20:15.610]  three and then move up from there and always just write down what you know what you're feeling and
[02:20:15.610 --> 02:20:22.330]  what you're going through um one of my adult sons uh took some and i advised him how much to take
[02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:28.810]  he took a little bit more than that he was on the couch crying literally crying to himself i just
[02:20:28.810 --> 02:20:34.730]  sat there like what is this dude doing and whatever happened i left out of the room or did something
[02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:40.010]  came back he was smiling and i asked him hey you good he's like i don't know i was just in tune
[02:20:40.010 --> 02:20:45.370]  with myself it just made me something just made me cry and now i got it out and he told me he says
[02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:50.810]  you feel like i can just i can do anything now right how i'm feeling right now i can do anything
[02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:56.330]  there's nothing i cannot do or won't try to do so people figure out what's going to work for you
[02:20:56.330 --> 02:21:02.730]  and try it you're doing everything else look why would you try a magic mushroom natural
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:12.900]  bruce uh bruce lipton talks about some of that stuff where like uh when you first get into
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:20.020]  to mushrooms um that for certain individuals like if they've always been like real tough
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:24.580]  uh that it does make those individuals cry because they're actually starting to release
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:30.900]  emotion and so for some individuals uh you know that that's the way that they you know that they
[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:35.540]  they want to their maybe their body wants to release that emotion but they've learned to
[02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:40.900]  control their emotions so then when they're obviously on a on a different state um on a
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:46.420]  different mind state uh they can't really control it as well so the body's able to heal it's pretty
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:52.020]  interesting man on there's so many individuals out there uh i would say terence mckenna is one
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:56.820]  of those if you really want to dive deeper into understanding more like the mindfulness of it
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:05.380]  that's good to know man because i mean like that's a that's a thing dude like we're crying
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:11.220]  releases things you know and i man since my brother passed away it's like i don't i can't
[02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:17.140]  even cry like i well like if i feel that emotion i like well up and then but no and i'll go back
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:21.620]  no tears like you know i mean and it's like i kind of you feel like you want that release a
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:27.300]  little bit um and maybe that maybe that is something that i need to you know kind of try out
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:33.780]  you know for that reason is it kind of just kind of maybe break down some walls of trauma because
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:39.300]  think about it it's not like you know everybody didn't go to war or go you know do you know get
[02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:44.740]  shot at or things like that although i have been shot at um but you know like people have trauma
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:49.860]  that you think you know a loved one passed i made it i mean you know i kind of got over it it's it's
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:55.060]  not that big of a deal but things still weigh on you that you might not even know about um that
[02:22:55.060 --> 02:23:01.380]  could be blocking you in life so um i definitely think man mushrooms from hearing you boys talk man
[02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:07.060]  like from y'all's experience i think that's something that could be very helpful i think
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:10.900]  it's going to be helpful and beneficial for anybody that's willing to try it whether you
[02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:15.700]  have any ailments or not you may not have any of this stuff that we're talking you might not have
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:21.940]  anxiety you may not have ptsd you may not have severe depression you may not have whatever but
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:27.620]  it's worth trying you don't have to have an ailment to try this for this to open you up and
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:35.540]  make you a whole different person reset reset that's a great that's a great point way of putting
[02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:41.060]  it as a reset like if you uh maybe you got some stuff where maybe maybe you would feel or you're
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:46.020]  secretly like yo i should probably have a therapist or something but there's no fucking way that you
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:51.460]  would ever do that i think mushrooms could be that answer for you uh it's gonna obviously probably
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:56.420]  take longer but that those internal talks that you have when you're tripping and it's uh you know
[02:23:56.420 --> 02:24:00.340]  you've kind of pushed it a little bit maybe you're at that three grams or whatever you really you
[02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:07.140]  really feel it and it can kind of change your life um it's not like this uh kumbaya moment or
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:12.580]  anything um when you first start out even though those can happen but for the most part i think
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:17.780]  it's more just the veil is lifted a little bit you get to see that there's uh i don't know there's
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:23.220]  something else tangible uh right here on this planet and if you alter your state a little bit
[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:28.580]  you're able to see some of that stuff and like i mentioned most of it is very benevolent and
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:35.700]  and uh enjoyable um the the jumping off the roof and all that stuff i i feel like those are more
[02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:41.220]  like acid stories and again those always seemed more like exaggerated you know when i was in high
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:46.180]  school people always talked about oh this dude he did like he put all this acid on his chest
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:50.580]  and then he turned into like a glass of orange juice and thought it was like everywhere i've
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:55.060]  gone i would go to other colleges you know and people would be saying that's the same fucking
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:25:00.660]  stories like that so i don't even think a lot of that stuff is even true it's just people repeat it
[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:05.620]  because they've never yeah truly experienced what acid was especially when they're young
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:12.900]  one up on everybody's story right yeah of course you know everybody's oh man he took so many hits
[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:17.780]  it's like yeah i don't know for real i don't know but i believe that i don't hear any one-up stories
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:23.300]  about how great you're gonna feel and how how much anxiety you released you're able to go to the store
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:27.300]  and move around and be around people and do all that because you're on some mushrooms you weren't
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:31.220]  able to be doing that before and those people that are severely depressed it's definitely going to
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:36.260]  ask you why are you depressed bitch what's going on let's figure this out right now and by the end
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:42.660]  of that trip you will know exactly what's going on like wow that's all i needed and then there's no
[02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:47.460]  egos when you're on mushrooms i guarantee you're not thinking about none there's no egos and
[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:53.220]  mushrooms i guarantee you it's all self-taught it's all self-love and it's all more importantly
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:26:02.820]  an escape not an escape like uh some other drugs may do this is like an escape to let you know that
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:07.780]  man like i keep telling you i feel like i can i can figure out the whole world bro i can drive
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:13.300]  i can fly a united plane right now from here to la i guarantee you i can in my head but my body's
[02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:26.160]  gonna be like bro you tripping yeah it is what happened there he muted himself he doesn't say it
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.080]  oh he froze are you there mj yes sir all right you froze there buddy
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:37.040]  you can fly there without an airplane right
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:51.120]  oh i'm in la shit this is great and it's all it in my i guess is my opinion but it it feels like
[02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:56.000]  a real medicine marco like when you respect it you're not doing it all the time you're not doing
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:02.320]  it and like going to the club you know that's that's not this experience you know that's if
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:07.120]  you want to enjoy drinks and stuff i mean that's what i feel like that atmosphere is for right
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.080]  that's why it's enjoyable club can be great but if you're doing this the atmosphere is being
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.640]  outside that's the same thing it's like being outside is the club that's where you want to be
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:23.600]  to have the best experience sounds like colorado will be the key when it warms up boom now you know
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:29.200]  dude you know i obviously know dude so shout out to shout out to everybody that's really starting
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:36.800]  to use medicine as uh as a our cannabis and uh and mushrooms as medicine definitely got to venture
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:41.360]  out into it we've been doing everybody's been doing other drugs and things like that that's
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:46.400]  great you do what you that works for you your drug of choice your doc or whatever you do that that's
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:51.760]  great but let's venture into something a little bit more natural now let's try pick up on a little
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:59.520]  one time just try it one time just see it work so big uh so quick to pick up and do other things i
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:04.400]  mean we everybody's gonna do what they're gonna do let me say that i don't want to stereotype
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:08.560]  anybody or doing it if you drink do what do you do and that's great but all i'm saying is you
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:13.200]  should be definitely trying to do some mushrooms you should definitely be trying to microdose 0.3
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:20.240]  0.3 0.3 every time try that 0.3 and see where this takes you it's going to open some doors up for you
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:26.160]  i'm not talking about maybe like a new job or anything but it might it might uh it might help
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.560]  you answer some questions you had within yourself that you couldn't get help from a therapist or
[02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:37.040]  something like that well two people that are on mushrooms is it is there much conversation there
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:43.040]  or is it just kind of whatever just enjoy just there in the moment it's how well do you know
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.040]  that person because silence can be golden but if like i've known you forever then you and i are
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:54.880]  probably going to go deep hopefully uh go go at least a little deep and then yeah that is the best
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:29:00.240]  part about being with somebody that you trust is that silence is kind of the best you don't you
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.760]  don't feel like you got to fill the air or whatever right yeah man going outside marco i think you just
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.160]  i don't know just being with your lady and like maybe letting her do like a
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.320]  0.1 or something you know like did you even feel a little bit you know she's like oh yeah
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:22.640]  the next time maybe it's a 0.2 just to kind of because that's the kind of stuff that i feel like
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:28.000]  where you get the little tickle in your spine you feel a little bit better you're it's almost
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  like your posture in a way like you just feel like a better uh human being and um there's something
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.360]  to this man i think that's why uh you know this this should be at the forefront of of your uh
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:48.480]  thinking i guess or hopefully that's what we hope for 2023 uh for everybody watching our show is
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:54.080]  you know mental health is just as important as your physical health and in my opinion once you
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:58.720]  get the mental health down a lot of the other stuff is a lot easier for you because you just
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:02.480]  feel better in general and then when your body starts to feel better because you're working out
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:08.160]  again you're getting that like double double win getting those small percentages each and every day
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:12.640]  the shit adds up quick and i think mushrooms would not only help you with the mental side of things
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:16.880]  but it's also helped me kind of relax where like if you're working out a ton it's almost like your
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:22.960]  body kind of just releases a little bit uh more than than normal um and a lot of that i mean
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:27.680]  obviously kind of people know how to work out and stuff but you know the lactic acid and all those
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:36.640]  little extra stuff seem to uh not not be as uh what's the word like it it hurts in a way like
[02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:41.200]  if you're working out really hard like that shit hurts there for a while uh and mushrooms seem to
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:50.320]  kind of help with that as well i just read total relaxation reset yeah so uh marco we're you know
[02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:54.480]  some of the things we had mentioned before do you want to maybe briefly get into some questions if
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:31:03.840]  there are some and then uh you know go about it yeah i've been watching the chat man i haven't
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:09.200]  seen a ton of questions um but y'all can get them in there if y'all if y'all ask questions go ahead
[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:14.480]  and start popping them in there um people say that growing the mushrooms is just as healing
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:19.440]  and exciting as taking them green table gardens i can see that kind of like cannabis you know
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:24.720]  what i mean it's probably even more of a nurturing aspect to the mushrooms they're beautiful
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:31.920]  it's very therapeutic uh it's very relaxing while this thing is happening everything is still
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:38.080]  there's no air moving around like plants in the cannabis dispensary or whatnot it's just everything
[02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:45.040]  is very still and everything is very sterile everything is sterile and clean like oh this is
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:50.720]  great like i can see how they said shout out to whoever is that that said that that that is
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:58.240]  definitely nurturing and it really feels great to the body to be uh i should say cultivate mushrooms
[02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:03.520]  and cannabis and i should say anything um i have some plan i don't know if you guys can see some
[02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:10.320]  of the plants i have here but i have some um some nice plants i'm just all around anything that
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:18.320]  grows in dirt or anything like that i'm into it so uh love it yeah it kind of it kind of turns
[02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:22.880]  into that man like you you know you grow your favorite cannabis or whatever and you get deeper
[02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:27.840]  into the soil and then you start breaking that down and get into the components of the soil and
[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:32.960]  then now you've gone which mushroom do you see over my shoulder is a big part of the soil fungi
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:39.440]  and then now you say well shit mushrooms grow well and this cannabis pot well let me just branch
[02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:44.640]  off and grow a different type of mushroom um increase the profit even more and for anybody
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:49.200]  that just wants to grow mushrooms period like if you grow edibles like they're like they're gonna
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:56.160]  be the best mushrooms you've ever had ever yeah ever man you can't even explain like how good when
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:00.960]  you slice up some oysters and just cook them up and eat them how good it tastes um i was really
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:04.880]  surprised you know that was one thing that shocked me because you always eat mushrooms
[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:09.680]  they all kind of look the same but when you actually taste those connoisseur ones man it
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:15.760]  takes you to another level oh and how long you've been growing those mushrooms i grew them like
[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:22.320]  three years ago for about six or eight months just to kind of do that i wanted to try it um
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:29.360]  i didn't really want to dedicate a space to the mushrooms i kind of didn't you know pursue it and
[02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:35.120]  i have you know i can do it now if i want i still got some spawn i need to use before it goes bad
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:40.560]  but um i grew them for a little while man but i just kind of took more to the cannabis plant i
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:47.200]  just want to just keep my time focused there man but if i got into the psychedelics the site you
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:51.360]  know then i'm sure i'll probably pick that back up because like anything else i'm going to want
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:57.520]  to control you know the inputs that grow what i'm putting in my body so that makes perfect sense
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:05.040]  and i think somebody asked me they asked me say mj if you had a choice i know just give me a
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:10.800]  straight yeah what would you do if you could only do one or the other which one would you do
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:16.960]  i said what do you mean like consume or grow and they'd be like if you could only do one
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:22.240]  or the other period grow or consume it which one it would be and i was like definitely can
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:29.920]  definitely the mushrooms because of it has more properties of healing uh for me this works for me
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:37.600]  now i ain't talking about everybody but let's look at it let's give it a quick flip so cannabis it
[02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:44.320]  has its properties don't get me wrong but nothing in cannabis is gonna make me feel the way i feel
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.560]  when i take mushrooms definitely cool cannabis is nice i'll be high you know our this and that but
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:54.320]  you can guarantee when i take these mushrooms i'm gonna be high for eight to ten hours
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:35:02.240]  guarantee there's no if ands and but there's no oh i ate some no i'm gonna be literally high for
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:10.080]  eight to ten hours so you gotta choose what you gotta choose which works best for you you know
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:15.440]  what i mean i mean my best friend i know what works best for him but because he's my best friend
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:23.040]  does that work best for me no what works best for me is what works you know with my body kidney
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.800]  stones and stuff like that i hate to bring all that up but i have kidney stones and all that
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:32.080]  and ever since i've been taking mushrooms and cannabis it's been dwindling down i don't have
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:38.080]  to i don't you know drop two kidney stones a month now it's one every six or eight months
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.320]  so i gotta look at it like what what is really beneficial for me and the mushrooms definitely
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:51.440]  are all day and night is that for whatever i was just gonna say brother isn't that like one of the
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:58.080]  most painful things that a man can go through is is passing kidney stones like that yes the one of
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:06.160]  the most painful things i've ever gone through in life is kidney stone a lot of people say that man
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:11.840]  i had one small tiny when i was younger and that hurt like a bitch it was but nothing like how
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:18.720]  people describe but these days like some grown-ass man on their knees kidney stone
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:26.960]  yeah down the fetal position sweating on a cold-ass floor you got the window open it's
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:32.000]  eight below outside blowing right on you and you're still sweating and then you go to the
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:38.720]  doctor and find out that you have a five uh uh uh number five uh what is a millimeter or
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:45.440]  a centimeter or one of that that's as big as the p-hole bro when that thing clogs you have a hole
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:50.480]  in that bad boy you got a big-ass stone sitting at the tip of your shit and it won't come out
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:59.200]  what the fuck do you do sorry about that y'all that's real talk though that's real life shit
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.640]  what do you do you got this marble sticking out of your shit and it won't come out
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:13.680]  question well when you get to the doctor and they wake well look when you get to the doctor and they
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:18.320]  wake you up and tell you what they did i was like dude i was in the house so it's like yeah we know
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:22.080]  they put you in the car they brought you to the hospital and here you are you're waking up
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:30.240]  and it's gone but boy when you piss again it's not a great feeling so my point is i'm gonna do
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.360]  these mushrooms i'm gonna keep continue to grow i'm gonna keep continue uh continue to educate
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:42.640]  myself and others on the benefits of medicinal mushrooms period so this doesn't happen again
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:45.840]  i don't have to worry about the marble at the tip of my shit no more you know i'm saying i can just
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:52.480]  go to the bathroom i have to worry about none of that definitely that's key bro that shit makes me
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:59.680]  hurt right now everybody's just my asshole's tight right now it's like whoa wait a minute did he say
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:06.480]  yeah he did but look i don't have no more i can't tell you last time i pissed the kidney stone
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.520]  now was that did you change your liquid intakes as well were you doing a lot of teas and things
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:18.960]  like that or was this straight with shrooms i was doing mostly just the shrooms to change it however
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:27.200]  i drank a lot of regular tea and the regular tea black tea has oxalates in it and my kidney stones
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:34.320]  are made out of calcium oxalate so every time i drink tea that intensifies it tea soda chocolate
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:40.400]  nuts and a lot of the green vegetables rice starches and things like there's like five
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:46.880]  pages of stuff that i cannot eat so i've kind of you know after you know 20 years i didn't kind of
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.680]  dwell on it down to only the things i can eat and i venture off here and there but i could say this
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:56.960]  the mushrooms that i take definitely help me with my kidney stones i don't know what the what the
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:02.320]  correlation is but since i've been taking them i've been having less kidney stones than before
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:09.600]  in my last i'm 53 years old so i don't know for the last two years i should say it's three years
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:15.360]  or so it's definitely been dwindling down one every you know six or eight months versus twice
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:21.040]  a month i got a call into work because i'm at home like like i got cramps or something like
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.520]  you know i'm saying numbers don't lie
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:31.440]  you know i had heard that that meant like if you have a bunch of kidney stones your body doesn't
[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:40.720]  absorb calcium correctly was that ever like brought up to you yes calcium oxalate so the body's just
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:47.280]  finding a way and eventually puts it because it needs to put it somewhere and then it basically
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.400]  just starts to build up these stones right is that how that works remember your kidneys your
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:58.640]  kidneys pull that calcium out of your piss and what happens is i think when they don't pull it out
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.480]  it sits in there and then it crystallizes they're not correct mj yes and when you say crystallize
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:08.640]  you're both exactly right when they both when it crystallized you know what rock candy used to look
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:13.440]  like that's what a kidney stone looks like so when when you go to the doctor i'm gonna say something
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:17.920]  when the doctor you ever go to the doctor they say do you have blood in your urine this is one of
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:23.200]  the symptoms that happens when that kidney passes through your urethra tube down there it just
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:28.800]  bounces and sticks on one side you drink water and it might move and touch on the other side
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:32.800]  and by the time it gets all the way down to your bladder dog you didn't bled out a little bit
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:42.320]  that's valuable stuff makes sense i remember seeing this show it was a while ago i was
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:48.000]  surprised this technology was existed back then they use sonic waves to like blast the kidney
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.720]  stones when they're so big that you can't pass them they were just hitting them like sound waves
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:59.120]  and pulverize them have you heard anything like that yes that definitely works however i've tried
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:07.520]  that uh i think my first operation was in 05 and they went in and did that and then
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:12.640]  uh i waited some time and then it was like eight months later i had to go back and do
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.960]  uh like a follow-up just kind of see where i was at and he was like dude you got like 80 i think it
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:26.720]  was like 78 kidney stones in the left kidney and like it was over 100 something in the right i'm
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:33.520]  like what is going on like where are they you know what's going to happen like so uh yeah it's very
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:39.760]  pulverizing and it made like a bunch more and we're able to collect more of the crystals and
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:46.160]  whatever right exactly it wasn't until the second time when i actually had them remove them so they
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:54.080]  actually go in um so i had a tube in my side so that the kidney stones could drop through the tube
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:01.040]  instead of scarring up my urethra tube or whatnot so i had the surgery they go in with the scope and
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:07.920]  the uh whatever it is to hold it open they go in and just pull them out but that's fine and dandy
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:15.920]  but until you piss it's like you grab grab some sand in your hand from a sand you know a sand pit
[02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:20.640]  and just grab it and just just let the sand just slowly just pour out of your hand you know how
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:26.640]  long that takes now imagine you trying to piss all them damn pebbles out of your shit god damn bro
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:32.080]  i'm sorry you i mean i would and look man we're laughing but it's funny to me because i'm like
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:35.840]  how did i ever get to this point and more importantly i'm going to get to that point
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:41.920]  where i'm going to tell y'all is because the mushrooms together with the cannabis in the
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:48.480]  last three years my kidney stones have went down like 80 so i only have one one little thing that
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:54.240]  goes around uh maybe once every six or eight months and that's it so i'm definitely staying
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:43:03.440]  on my mushrooms man definitely and if you got a try it shit another benefit have you i mean
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.880]  any downside at all i mean really right nothing except that next day you gotta get a little rest
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:15.200]  and get your shit back together yeah uh that's it that's the only really downside i see is that next
[02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:20.800]  day um so before i go to bed at night when i'm done tripping whatever that is i'll take a beat
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:27.200]  i'll take what is that vitamin b12 chewable boom i wake up i'm ready to rock again i'm ready to go
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:35.280]  land down the yellow hips that fire yellow bright yellow look put your glasses on
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:40.400]  before you go use the bathroom i'm just gonna startle the shit out of you remember back in
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:45.360]  the day you got a little pill with the uh detox drink and i was supposed to like because you
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:51.600]  drank all that water so i was supposed to yellow it back up that's another that's besides the little
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:56.800]  yellow piss and you know feeling a little groggy and a little tired the next day i don't see any
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:02.800]  downfalls exactly good stuff the only down the real downfall is you not taking up shit
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:12.800]  well how about this too sometimes people will get into uh their micro dosing mj and then when you
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:16.880]  start to see them and like i've even visited people at work and stuff before where it's like
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:25.120]  i can tell you are lit oh yes like micro dosing has turned into getting lit every single
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.640]  every day or every other day so i think you gotta kind of watch that too you know like it is fun
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:38.400]  it's enjoyable uh but it should be used um sparingly yeah and sparingly especially at first
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:43.600]  you know there's no like real rush to this this is something you can do for the rest of your life
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:49.440]  so there's no need to rush it you know it's a it's a journey for real naturally you can do this
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:55.840]  and like i think somebody touched on earlier real quick uh said yeah they're undetected so yeah you
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:00.960]  can go down and you know if you get a piss test or whatever like oh wow damn these mushrooms
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:09.680]  but damn that damn weed did done yeah or the the homies could do like cocaine on thursday night
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.160]  pass that shit on monday right you smoke a little joint go to work on monday morning
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:18.800]  and they act like you're over there like uh you can't handle your workload stuff right
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:22.560]  it's like man that shit was friday night like i don't even
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:28.000]  like i don't even know what i ate friday but here it is monday i'm ready to work what's up
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:38.480]  yeah well yeah let's uh you know appreciate everything michael and uh you know as things
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.880]  progress and people probably get better at this i would imagine they probably have more advanced
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:48.240]  questions for you um and like i said i think i think doing this again that's why we want to
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:54.800]  kick off the the year with this uh in my opinion this might be a way for certain men to be able to
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:46:00.240]  do this themselves grow this for themselves deal with shit on the you know internally without
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:06.240]  having to really share certain things with people uh and find like real peace you know especially
[02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.000]  when you're younger you might have done certain things taking things from people or whatever you
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.440]  did that probably put a lot of bullshit karma on your plate uh that's that's what i think is best
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:21.360]  about mushrooms is again it takes away like we've said a couple times now like the material world
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:26.720]  the things that seem to really fucking matter that goes away for a few hours and it's the the
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:31.440]  background stuff the trees looking up at the stars whatever you're doing it looking up at the sky
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:37.200]  looking down at the soil uh things that you normally don't actually even do anymore for whatever reason
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:41.200]  man when you're on mushrooms and you're kind of enjoying the moment that's the kind of stuff that
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:48.240]  you like to look at um so it just kind of i don't know maybe re re lets the brain rethink like what
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:54.080]  what's maybe some of the also the purpose of us being here is probably to explore this
[02:46:54.080 --> 02:47:00.000]  and in my opinion it's to also explore the mind while we're here to try to try to see where uh
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:06.560]  where we can go mental health is important man i think mushrooms is going to answer all the
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:12.240]  questions you could talk to a psychiatrist and your best bf whoever all day and night but no
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:18.160]  one's going to give you the truth like them damn mushrooms like i was telling you my adult son you
[02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:22.560]  sitting there crying like he was fearing he's like dude i figured i could do anything now like
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:28.480]  you back you good he's like yeah i'm good like he kind of broke it down like i feel great like
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:35.040]  there's nothing bad nowhere near me as i feel great that's all i can say so i would say everybody
[02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:43.120]  definitely needs to revisit or think about it if not educate yourself go look go on ig go and drop
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:49.600]  in somebody's uh i uh their messaging ask questions don't go off of what someone else said
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:56.000]  go off of what you know meaning go and do your research on your own and figure it out ask some
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:03.760]  questions and go from there open up your mind in 2023 people let's do this hell yeah great words
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:08.880]  man this has been a great show man i love talking i love talking to people that have that actual
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:14.160]  experience you know what i mean you can always tell when someone just has just read the book and
[02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:20.080]  they gotta spit that back out but when you have those extra tidbits you know the corn you know
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:26.160]  the mason jar with the lid upside down those are things that you only learn from experience so
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:30.400]  i mean i think this show is going to be one that i will play back i don't always
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:35.040]  watch them because i don't have time but you were dropping some bombs man and the way you made it
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.960]  seem so simple to kind of get into the mushrooms i hope some people um give it a shot if not for the
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:46.320]  um psychedelics starting out start with some food mushrooms you know what i mean yes feed your body
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:51.680]  feet you know you still don't get that fungi in you um and then you can work on the mind when you

[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:21.040]  um i've been playing plan um playing this back in my head all day like what are you saying i was
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:25.920]  like you know what let me take some mushrooms and it told me you know what just be yourself bro
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:31.200]  just go in there and talk and be yourself don't have to go out and remember all kind of extra
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:36.240]  stuff like brian touched in on just go and be yourself enjoy yourself and hopefully somebody
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:40.800]  will listen and they can spread some positivity someone else that's going to need it and brian
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.160]  you my dog man i've i've you know i've been knowing you for a while now shit i uh we
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:50.880]  retouched bases we found each other again i said like some lost kids in high school or something
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.080]  like that but i can say going forward man we got we got some things to do shit let's get it going
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:01.920]  you know i am let's go yeah actually i like uh behind the scenes you know i'm gonna we need to
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.320]  go to dinner and stuff it's great to see it's like it is like seeing like an old like college
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:10.880]  friend or somebody you hadn't seen in a really long time um and just to see how happy you are
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.240]  and stuff you know and i think uh i guess that's what i'm also learning it later in life buddy with
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:21.680]  the karma and stuff is there's this there's a huge difference between being happy and being joyful
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.960]  and it seems like people that are are focused on being joyful shit comes their way but you know
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:31.920]  they they deal with it however they deal with it and they keep it moving and nj you uh you know
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.240]  you're a beacon for that man i think uh it's something that's helped me behind the scenes
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:42.000]  when i wanted to you know we we know a lot of the same people and sometimes people uh don't hit you
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.480]  know hold themselves up to the way that you thought they would um and that fucks with you when
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:50.880]  you think you thought you figured not figured somebody out but thought you could trust somebody
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.360]  enough to do certain things so that's why i brought up like you know doing the seed hoarders
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:51:00.000]  even though it wasn't really something that we could monetize i just like the fact that we were
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:05.680]  thinking like that back in the day buddy uh because you know being an entrepreneur now is fantastic
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:10.960]  and uh back then i don't even you know i wouldn't have known even what business was how to build an
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:15.760]  e-commerce website we still had issues everybody before we started the show on all of us trying to
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:20.720]  figure out our it you know so we we're still trying to put the put this stuff together as we
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:26.160]  go because the technology is the young bucks game um and i think you you know the ones that
[02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:32.480]  obviously understand the tech part it's mjs and marcos and people like them uh that have the
[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:39.040]  knowledge that you need to really you know take a moment sit back put your time into and i know from
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:45.040]  from firsthand you know experience with mushrooms uh that that can change your life it can change
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:50.400]  the outlook on your life uh i wouldn't necessarily say it's a fast fix uh but it's definitely
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:55.280]  something that's worth putting in time and effort because you're going to get something like in 90
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:59.120]  days i always feel like that's the that's the point like if you can stick to something 90 days
[02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:03.280]  you're probably going to end up doing it and if you're just doing this like every couple of weeks
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:10.640]  i mean that's that's more than beneficial it definitely is man everybody get out there do
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:20.310]  your research let's try these mushrooms and please stay tuned all right marco you got anything
[02:52:20.310 --> 02:52:25.750]  else or uh london appreciate your time sir yeah i'm good what do you got y'all got a show tomorrow
[02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:31.910]  the chat was asking uh no uh we gotta i gotta talk with layton on that and all this kind of
[02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:38.630]  stuff but yeah behind the scenes uh we'll see oh last thing last thing i got a shirt for y'all
[02:52:39.270 --> 02:52:45.430]  sorry it was a little late but i'm gonna go pick them up shortly i got uh the og red ones yeah i
[02:52:45.430 --> 02:52:50.870]  tried to buy white black i got white black this time all right boom i'll take white and black i
[02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:56.070]  was trying to find that man i was gonna wear that one that old school red and black yeah i remember
[02:52:56.070 --> 02:53:01.030]  with education over eagles your favorite saying bro yeah man that's what i meant like today's
[02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:06.310]  memory lane dude and you know now that we can kind of just monetize things without having to
[02:53:06.310 --> 02:53:11.510]  have that monkey on your back that's why i just enjoy being able to talk like this talk with marco
[02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:16.870]  doesn't matter you know we got our boy london uh you know really building things behind the scenes
[02:53:17.430 --> 02:53:24.070]  all over so uh a lot yeah man a lot's going on uh for the future cannabis project there's so many
[02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:30.390]  people that are starting to come on to have shows uh you know legends uh london's had a variety of
[02:53:30.390 --> 02:53:35.190]  legends on the shows uh so again you know it's it's nice to be able to maybe take an hour
[02:53:35.190 --> 02:53:38.870]  especially when you're trimming that was that was where i was always trying to focus even though it
[02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:44.870]  was like self-improvement shit or if it's like uh you know cannabis improvement you know especially
[02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:49.190]  when you get into man self-improvement's hard i think for some people to try to but the karma
[02:53:49.190 --> 02:53:54.070]  aspect is the self-improvement that i really bought into i think there's something to that
[02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:59.990]  and and putting good into the the world uh it comes back you know it comes back to you in space
[02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:05.030]  and it's something that uh we should be telling everybody about because once you feel it life is
[02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:08.870]  meant to be abundant it's meant to be abundant for you and your family you just got to get on
[02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:15.350]  that vibration speaking of family shout out nephew got his own little clothing uh brand he came up
