[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  Bransman, we've got Sheila Gibson, we've got Sanders Zbzniewski, sorry, Sandra, I always
[00:06.560 --> 00:12.000]  murder your name, I apologize. Zbzniewski. Yeah, that's all right. Zbzniewski. I screw it up too sometimes.
[00:13.680 --> 00:21.120]  Great. And Sanders, a partner over at Clark Hill. Sheila is with, I believe, Aura Law, and Dave
[00:21.120 --> 00:29.120]  has a practice in Solano Beach, California. Dave and Sheila both specialize in IP law,
[00:29.120 --> 00:32.880]  specifically in the canvas industry, and Sanders more on the corporate side, but deals with IP
[00:32.880 --> 00:38.240]  issues for clients all the time. I'm an attorney as well, but not nearly as well versed in IP
[00:38.240 --> 00:43.600]  trademark and copyright laws as the panelists. So why don't we start off, Dave, why don't you
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.120]  introduce yourself here for a minute and say hello, and then we'll do the same as Sheila,
[00:49.120 --> 00:56.000]  and then go down to Sandra. All right. Thanks, Rob, for hosting this. This is terrific,
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.560]  cutting edge. I'm Dave Brathman. I'm in Solano Beach in Encinitas, California,
[01:02.560 --> 01:08.720]  which is suburbs of San Diego. And let's see if I can do this in 30 seconds or less.
[01:09.920 --> 01:17.200]  Been a lawyer for more years than I care to admit to, most of them as intellectual property,
[01:17.200 --> 01:25.040]  trademark copyright law thing, music TV film lawyer. And then in the last 12 years or so,
[01:25.040 --> 01:33.680]  I've expanded the practice into the legal cannabis space. And so we have a lot of clients
[01:34.480 --> 01:42.000]  who are trying to protect their IP and protect and monetize their IP from growers to retailers
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.480]  and everything in between. That's kind of it in a nutshell. So thanks for that. Great. Sheila?
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.480]  Hi, I'm Sheila Gibson. I am a patent and trademark attorney. And to be a patent attorney,
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.480]  you have to have a technical degree or in science or engineering. And mine is microbiology and
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.000]  molecular genetics. And prior to law school, I had a brief stint in the biotech industry doing
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.920]  gene therapy research. And since I spent 16 years in big law helping agriculture, biotech,
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.320]  medical device and clean tech companies protect their intellectual property around the world.
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.280]  And as I started to transition to cannabis, I was a partner at a national law firm, and they were
[02:29.280 --> 02:35.520]  not ready to have cannabis clients. And so in 2019, I made the decision to start my own law
[02:35.520 --> 02:42.240]  firm, Ora IP Law, which is specifically focused in cannabis. I still do help clients in other areas,
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.840]  but the main focus and the majority of my clients are cannabis, both patent and trademark clients.
[02:47.920 --> 02:54.330]  And I also do a lot of IP licensing. Great, thank you. And Sander?
[02:56.250 --> 03:01.210]  Thanks, Rob. Yeah, hi, Sander Zagzebski. I'm a corporate securities M&A lawyer.
[03:02.730 --> 03:10.330]  I recently joined Clark Hill, which is a national law firm. I left Princeton Martyr,
[03:10.330 --> 03:14.730]  which is also a national law firm and has a very significant cannabis practice. So
[03:15.130 --> 03:21.850]  it's a large portion of what I do is M&A corporate finance work for cannabis companies,
[03:21.850 --> 03:29.930]  probably 50, 60% of my practice. And intellectual property is not the focus of what I do. Again,
[03:29.930 --> 03:36.730]  most of what I do is raising money, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures,
[03:36.730 --> 03:42.490]  that sort of thing with a strong, strong focus on cannabis. But in those types of deals,
[03:43.050 --> 03:48.010]  as you can imagine, intellectual property is one of the more significant
[03:49.530 --> 03:54.090]  issues we encounter because investors care about it, companies care about it. And
[03:55.210 --> 04:02.890]  in the cannabis space, it's a little bit, it requires an approach that isn't the same
[04:02.890 --> 04:07.370]  in all respects as you would find in other industries. So it's also quite interesting.
[04:08.010 --> 04:15.530]  So thanks for having me on, Rob. Of course. So just getting started, one of the things that
[04:15.530 --> 04:19.850]  attracted me to want to do this room tonight is, cannabis as an industry, I think is far more
[04:19.850 --> 04:23.690]  complicated than most people realize. And it's not just complicated from the standpoint of
[04:23.690 --> 04:27.930]  understanding regulations and understanding the state to state or municipality to municipality
[04:27.930 --> 04:32.890]  nature of the industry, but it's also complicated from the standpoint of what you can and can't do,
[04:32.890 --> 04:40.090]  both with banking regulations and intellectual property regulations. So when I speak to people
[04:40.090 --> 04:44.330]  outside of the industry, and they say, oh, why doesn't your company market themselves or advertise
[04:44.330 --> 04:50.010]  better? And my answer is, well, we're not able to use the regular platforms. We can't use Facebook
[04:50.010 --> 04:54.810]  or Instagram to market our companies the same way you would in any other industry. Or when you look
[04:54.810 --> 04:59.210]  at EBITDA margins on the bottom line of the company, EBITDA doesn't tell the story because
[04:59.290 --> 05:05.050]  280E tax regulations kick into place afterwards. So those are never able to really give the broader
[05:05.050 --> 05:09.690]  picture. But as I've gotten further into it, and again, I've had the benefit of having Dave
[05:09.690 --> 05:13.370]  Grantham as a friend for a couple of years. And he and I used to have an ongoing Tuesday night dinner
[05:13.370 --> 05:16.330]  where every Tuesday night we'd get together with another attorney who's in the audience,
[05:16.330 --> 05:20.730]  and I'll bring up here a little bit, named Lance Rogers. And we used to just hang out and discuss
[05:20.730 --> 05:24.570]  law and really just talk about what was happening in the industry. And the thing I found fascinating
[05:24.570 --> 05:29.290]  was that Dave consistently would explain to me what could and couldn't be done with regard to
[05:29.930 --> 05:36.650]  trademarking and copywriting. And I'd already come out of a space where I'd worked with a biotech
[05:36.650 --> 05:41.290]  firm that was making biopharmaceutical cannabinoids for the industry, where we were able to patent
[05:41.290 --> 05:45.130]  because we weren't ever starting with the plant. We were actually starting with yeast as a building
[05:45.130 --> 05:48.970]  block, and we were able to do all sorts of things that the traditional part of the industry couldn't.
[05:48.970 --> 05:53.690]  And Dave and I would discuss those as just kind of threshold questions of, when will this change?
[05:54.410 --> 05:58.970]  So the nature of the kind of nerdy talk we're going to have tonight is what can and can't be
[05:58.970 --> 06:04.570]  done in the industry and what we expect to see change and how it's going to change. So Dave,
[06:04.570 --> 06:08.410]  maybe you want to kick it off and just kind of give an idea of how you migrated your practice
[06:08.410 --> 06:12.410]  from traditional trademark and copyright into the cannabis world and what that's looked like for you.
[06:12.410 --> 06:20.010]  Dave Savage Oh, thanks, Rob. Okay, that's a great place to start. So right, I started doing
[06:20.810 --> 06:26.490]  traditional intellectual property law, although unlike Sheila, I am not a registered patent
[06:26.490 --> 06:35.370]  attorney. So my practice has been for the last 35, 38 years has been primarily devoted to
[06:35.370 --> 06:46.890]  trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing, the overlay with music, TV and film. And I've
[06:46.970 --> 06:52.490]  learned enough about patents to be able to talk about them for 15 or 20 minutes.
[06:53.530 --> 06:58.250]  But ultimately, I need to refer to somebody, a client who's really serious about it,
[06:58.250 --> 07:03.450]  to somebody like Sheila, for reasons I'm sure she'll explain in a few moments. And
[07:05.130 --> 07:12.730]  I like to say I know enough about patents to be dangerous. And that's about it. But we've done a
[07:12.730 --> 07:20.410]  lot of trademark work. And about 12 years ago, thanks to our mutual friend that Rob just
[07:20.410 --> 07:25.850]  mentioned, Lance Rogers, Lance and I were having a conversation about 12 years ago when he was
[07:25.850 --> 07:34.730]  defending a dispensary operator here in San Diego who was being criminally prosecuted. And the light
[07:34.730 --> 07:42.570]  bulb went on over my head that it was only a matter of time before the industry, this was like
[07:42.570 --> 07:49.850]  19 what, 2008, 2009. It was only a matter of time, I thought, before the industry would be morphing
[07:49.850 --> 07:58.490]  from illegal underground to above ground, recognized, decriminalized, legal, whatever
[07:58.490 --> 08:04.730]  you want to call it. And that was about six years before Colorado, Washington, and Oregon
[08:05.370 --> 08:11.450]  went adult use in 2014. And I started just learning everything I could about the cannabis industry
[08:11.450 --> 08:19.290]  and figuring out how to apply what I knew about intellectual property to the wacky,
[08:19.290 --> 08:25.850]  whack-a-mole world of the cannabis industry, where you've got this complex interplay between
[08:26.170 --> 08:32.810]  not just federal law and state law, but federal law itself. So the prime example of that, and I'm
[08:32.810 --> 08:40.490]  sure Sheila will delve into this, so I don't want to steal her thunder. But we've got this thing on
[08:40.490 --> 08:47.930]  the federal level called the Patent and Trademark Office. If you walk in on the trademark side of
[08:47.930 --> 08:54.490]  the trademark office, you cannot get a trademark federally registered still in 2021. You cannot
[08:55.450 --> 09:01.450]  get a trademark registered for anything that is, touches, or contains cannabis.
[09:03.290 --> 09:11.610]  Maybe you can for hemp and CBD in some cases, but for pure cannabis, no. Or even for dispensary
[09:11.610 --> 09:18.810]  retail services, testing labs, no, no, no on the federal level. But if you walk in the patent door,
[09:19.450 --> 09:24.010]  and I'm speaking figuratively, not literally, if you walk in the patent door, yes, you can.
[09:24.730 --> 09:29.930]  So how does that make sense? Well, it comes down to some differences in the law,
[09:31.130 --> 09:36.330]  the patent law versus the trademark law. So we've got that complexity to deal with on the federal
[09:36.330 --> 09:43.850]  level. And you can also, even though you can't get a trademark registration for a product that
[09:43.850 --> 09:49.530]  touches or a service that touches cannabis or is cannabis, the copyright office, if you've got
[09:50.090 --> 09:59.770]  content, YouTube videos, explainers, promotional brochures, graphically rich logos,
[09:59.770 --> 10:05.770]  the copyright office, no problem. Pay your fee, submit your application. They don't care if you're
[10:05.770 --> 10:10.650]  in the cannabis business. And then we can also talk about, there's also lots of opportunities
[10:10.650 --> 10:15.370]  on the trade secret side. But yeah, that's what we have to do is we have to kind of walk this
[10:15.450 --> 10:20.650]  kind of tightrope between federal law and state law, and even within federal law,
[10:21.770 --> 10:27.530]  some complexities there. And then even, obviously, each of the 50 states has their own view of this.
[10:28.410 --> 10:32.650]  So I'm not sure that's a nutshell, but that's kind of it in a nutshell, Rob.
[10:33.690 --> 10:37.530]  Really helpful. And before I pass over to Sheila, for all of you that are in the audience,
[10:37.530 --> 10:41.850]  are starting to raise hands, please know that as soon as we go through kind of setting the table
[10:41.850 --> 10:45.530]  here in this discussion, we will start taking audience questions. So bear with us. We're not
[10:45.530 --> 10:49.290]  ignoring you. We're just waiting until everyone's had a chance to kind of discuss the backgrounds.
[10:49.290 --> 10:54.090]  And then as we get into the question part of this, we will certainly reach out to people in the
[10:54.090 --> 10:58.170]  audience to ask more specific questions as it pertains to cannabis. What I will say as a
[10:58.170 --> 11:04.410]  disclaimer is all of us up here, while attorneys, we are not just giving legal advice tonight. You
[11:04.410 --> 11:09.290]  certainly have to consult your own counsel and make sure that anything we are talking about
[11:09.290 --> 11:13.370]  should be taken as broadly how we're working things in the industry, but they're not meant
[11:13.370 --> 11:18.730]  for your specific circumstance. And I think that most of the people around here, in fact, all of us
[11:18.730 --> 11:23.850]  are California-based. I'm actually Colorado-barred, but everyone else, I believe, is California. So
[11:23.850 --> 11:28.410]  anything they're saying is going to be pertaining mostly to California law anyway. So please,
[11:28.410 --> 11:33.290]  if you've got additional questions, consult your own counsel and take this as a broader
[11:33.290 --> 11:37.130]  discussion about patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the cannabis industry. Sheila?
[11:39.690 --> 11:45.690]  So I entered the industry a little bit later than Dave, and my entrance was really through my patent
[11:45.690 --> 11:51.930]  work. I was doing a lot of work in the cancer immunotherapy space. And as part of that work,
[11:51.930 --> 11:58.970]  I was following a pediatric cancer patient online whose name is Sophie Ryan, and her parents,
[11:58.970 --> 12:03.290]  Tracy and Josh Ryan, were treating their infant daughter's brain tumor with cannabis.
[12:04.010 --> 12:11.210]  And so my real time, I started following her when she was about two years old, so in about 2015,
[12:11.210 --> 12:18.090]  and I was immediately called to be part of the cannabis industry. I felt I was very interested
[12:18.090 --> 12:25.290]  and really wanted to learn everything I could about cannabis medicine and figure out how I could
[12:25.370 --> 12:31.610]  become, in some way, contribute to the industry. But at the time, I still really didn't see,
[12:33.050 --> 12:38.490]  it wasn't until maybe a year or so later, maybe two years later, that it really became clear to
[12:38.490 --> 12:42.970]  me, like Dave described, that the cannabis industry was going to need help with intellectual property,
[12:42.970 --> 12:49.770]  and it wasn't going to be an easy thing to do. And so David actually is absolutely right,
[12:49.770 --> 12:56.730]  not actually, absolutely right on the patent side. What's so interesting is because for patents,
[12:56.730 --> 13:01.050]  there's no requirement that you actually make and use your invention. You just have to have
[13:01.050 --> 13:06.890]  conceived of it in your mind in a way and be able to describe it in a way that would enable others
[13:06.890 --> 13:14.090]  to make and use your invention. There is no inquiry into whether this is something that's
[13:14.090 --> 13:19.210]  federally illegal. There's, you know, in some ways, no admission, or it's not even that there's
[13:19.210 --> 13:23.530]  no admission. I think there's just, it's not part of the inquiry. Whereas on the trademark side,
[13:23.530 --> 13:29.050]  you have to show use in commerce. So you actually have to say, I have been using my trademark in
[13:29.050 --> 13:34.010]  connection with these things that are federally illegal. And that's where we run into the trouble
[13:34.010 --> 13:41.770]  and the difference that Dave was just describing. So on the patent side, it's been really interesting.
[13:41.770 --> 13:47.130]  A lot of the questions that I end up feeling typically have to do with plant patents, I think
[13:47.850 --> 13:55.050]  it is very alarming to people, this concept of being able to patent a plant. And the one thing
[13:55.050 --> 14:02.890]  that I'll just say there to kind of calm any nerves about that is you're able to patent asexually
[14:02.890 --> 14:08.730]  propagated clones. So you're talking about a single genetic line and identical clones,
[14:08.730 --> 14:13.930]  even though you don't use the sequencing to describe the plant, you actually describe it
[14:13.930 --> 14:19.450]  in the patent application, just botanically and by what you've crossed to get what you are patenting.
[14:21.210 --> 14:27.930]  To enforce it, it would go to sequencing. And so you're not, nobody has a patent on cannabis.
[14:27.930 --> 14:34.570]  They do have patents, or there are people who hold patents currently on particular clones,
[14:34.570 --> 14:42.090]  particular cultivars of cannabis. And the other thing that's so interesting that Dave is talking
[14:42.090 --> 14:48.970]  about all of these, what's interesting, and I don't even like to say interesting as a lawyer,
[14:48.970 --> 14:56.170]  because it's frustrating, but it's in some ways, for legal minds, it's that challenge that kind
[14:56.170 --> 15:01.530]  of keeps you pushing forward is all of the ways that the government just contradicts itself.
[15:01.530 --> 15:08.490]  So the United States government actually has a patent that dates back to 1998 for the use of
[15:08.490 --> 15:15.850]  cannabinoids in the treatment of diseases resulting from oxidative stress. And then if you think about
[15:15.850 --> 15:22.010]  that they have a patent that talks about the medicinal value of cannabis and yet still
[15:22.010 --> 15:28.010]  regulate it through the DEA as a Schedule I drug, no medicinal value. So these are the things,
[15:28.090 --> 15:34.890]  I think, that keep a lot of us lawyers in the industry really interested in wanting to fix and
[15:34.890 --> 15:43.210]  help. And that's really what led to my transition into the cannabis industry and my dedication and
[15:43.210 --> 15:50.890]  passion for the law in this area. That's great. Thank you. Sandra, I know you've worked with a
[15:50.890 --> 15:55.770]  lot of bigger clients and a lot of the MSOs, and I know you've done a lot of M&A work in the space
[15:55.770 --> 16:00.250]  as well. As you're going through the process, working with some of the larger clients,
[16:00.250 --> 16:05.210]  especially out-of-state clients, how are you able to fuse the issues they're having from a
[16:05.210 --> 16:10.570]  trademark and copyright perspective, crossing multiple states and crossing multiple platforms?
[16:13.530 --> 16:18.410]  Yeah, look, interesting question. And there isn't an obvious answer because basically
[16:18.810 --> 16:25.610]  it comes up primarily in the due diligence process of a transaction. So in other words,
[16:25.610 --> 16:31.370]  if you're an investor, you're an acquirer, you want to understand the target's intellectual
[16:31.370 --> 16:37.770]  property strategy, if you will, what their protection level is, what kind of value they
[16:37.770 --> 16:44.010]  associate with it, how they license, what is licensed, what is owned, that sort of thing.
[16:44.250 --> 16:52.650]  But it is another thing I would say, it's one of the panels Sheila, I think, was talking about
[16:52.650 --> 16:58.490]  some of the awkward situations with or the how the federal government sort of takes
[16:59.290 --> 17:03.690]  inconsistent positions. And one of the things we encounter a lot on the corporate side is
[17:04.650 --> 17:11.050]  we've made hardscot rodino filings, which are large, you know, large, large, large,
[17:11.290 --> 17:17.290]  you know, filings, which are large antitrust filings in connection with mergers and acquisitions.
[17:17.290 --> 17:20.810]  And you make those filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's
[17:20.810 --> 17:27.530]  Antitrust Division. And what's ironic about these are only required for very large deals. So
[17:28.250 --> 17:33.290]  if you're in the $100 million deal range, you have to start thinking about it. If you're
[17:33.290 --> 17:37.690]  above 300, you definitely have to make a filing. Roughly speaking, the numbers are a little more
[17:37.690 --> 17:44.170]  precise, but they change every year. But the irony of it is, you know, these are antitrust
[17:44.170 --> 17:49.290]  filings. And so really what they're all about is consumer protection laws. You know, at their heart,
[17:49.290 --> 17:57.770]  they're supposed to take a peek at whether you can, whether there's, whether there's,
[17:57.770 --> 18:02.890]  it's a consumer protection concept. So how ironic is it that the federal government is trying to
[18:02.890 --> 18:06.890]  protect the price of weed when weed's an illegal product, right, to the consumer?
[18:08.010 --> 18:14.170]  But that's a little bit of a tangent. In terms of IP, it's just a matter of understanding it,
[18:14.170 --> 18:20.650]  digging into it, making sure that the value that's being attributed to it exists. And it's hard
[18:20.650 --> 18:31.290]  because there is such an awkward framework. And it's unclear in certain respects, you know, whether
[18:32.010 --> 18:39.130]  the intellectual property rights that a company has are enforceable to the extent they think it's
[18:39.130 --> 18:41.530]  enforceable and are giving them the value they think they have.
[18:44.650 --> 18:49.450]  Thanks, Standard. Mark, you joined a little bit late, so I'd love to have you introduce yourself.
[18:49.450 --> 18:53.130]  You know, Mark is more on, I think, the criminal defense side, or at least traditionally has been,
[18:53.130 --> 18:59.210]  and certainly has been involved in sort of the STFU movement that he's created. So,
[18:59.210 --> 19:04.730]  Mark, why don't you introduce yourself and let us know? And I know that trademark IP and copyright
[19:04.730 --> 19:08.490]  isn't necessarily directly where you focus your practice, but obviously a lot of your
[19:08.490 --> 19:11.930]  clients have had these issues as well, so I'm sure it crosses your desk frequently.
[19:13.050 --> 19:17.530]  Thank you very much, Rob. Thanks for having me in here. And I'll do a quick little intro. I'm
[19:17.530 --> 19:21.930]  Mark Wasserman. Together with my big brother, Craig, we are known as the law firm, the Pot
[19:21.930 --> 19:26.570]  Brothers at Law. We are California attorneys handling all aspects of cannabis business,
[19:26.570 --> 19:32.330]  as well as all areas of criminal defense. We are out to normalize and break the stigma of cannabis
[19:32.330 --> 19:38.650]  users. Most importantly, we go around the country teaching people how to engage peacefully with law
[19:38.650 --> 19:46.490]  enforcement by simply using 25 words known as the script and to shut the fuck up when cops ask
[19:46.490 --> 19:51.290]  questions. We have copyrighted and trademarked the script, as well as shut the fuck up for legal
[19:51.290 --> 20:01.700]  service. Our videos have over 800 million views collectively, and we have created a worldwide
[20:01.700 --> 20:07.300]  attorney referral network and encourage all attorneys to click my bio and link up with me.
[20:07.300 --> 20:13.060]  And I'm actually here more or less, I think, as a case study almost with Dave Brampman,
[20:13.060 --> 20:19.700]  the other moderator, one of the other moderators here. And if that's okay, Dave, I know you're my
[20:19.700 --> 20:26.020]  attorney and I'm the client, but I can speak. I hold the privilege, right? You hold the privilege.
[20:27.940 --> 20:32.580]  And hello, Sheila. I haven't spoken with you in a minute. And Sheila knows a little bit about the
[20:33.300 --> 20:41.300]  IP and the things we're dealing with. But as you heard, this shut the fuck up movement and all of
[20:41.300 --> 20:48.180]  the stuff that started with me and my brother falling ass backwards on social media, Instagram
[20:48.180 --> 20:56.820]  back in 2015. And getting on this platform that blew up for us and just basically teaching people
[20:56.820 --> 21:02.340]  how to deal with cops, something I've been doing my entire career as a criminal defense attorney,
[21:02.340 --> 21:07.540]  as most criminal defense attorneys tell their clients, just shut the fuck up, please.
[21:07.540 --> 21:13.380]  And you hear it over and over again. We somehow had a megaphone put in our faces, and
[21:14.340 --> 21:18.020]  while we blasted it out there, we weren't afraid to. We weren't afraid to show that we were cannabis
[21:18.020 --> 21:24.580]  users. And then suddenly we got merchandise and people were, it was just crazy the way it went
[21:24.580 --> 21:32.740]  from attorney to influencer to celebrity. And we knew that, okay, we got to protect our intellectual
[21:32.740 --> 21:39.300]  property. We weren't quite sure how and could we? We're just telling people to shut the fuck up. I
[21:39.380 --> 21:44.500]  mean, that's the first conversation we had between me and my brother when we were thinking about,
[21:44.500 --> 21:49.700]  do we need an IP attorney? We don't want to hire an attorney. We don't want to hire an attorney.
[21:49.700 --> 21:53.300]  We don't want to spend money on that. Who's going to do it? We're going to say, shut the fuck up.
[21:53.300 --> 21:59.220]  And everybody says that. So we didn't give it much thought in the very beginning. Then after,
[21:59.860 --> 22:08.020]  it was shortly after 2015, maybe 2016, when I met Mr. Brampfman at a normal outing in Aspen.
[22:08.660 --> 22:16.020]  And we shared some nice intellectual property thoughts that he was able to clear up for me.
[22:16.020 --> 22:24.660]  And then lo and behold, me and my brother hired him and he would go on to copyright, trademark,
[22:24.660 --> 22:31.620]  get all of our intellectual property protected, the script, the 25 words, which I'll recite very
[22:32.260 --> 22:37.940]  brief, quickly. Why did you pull me over? I'm not discussing my day. Am I being detained or
[22:37.940 --> 22:44.900]  am I free to go? If detained, you say, I invoke the fifth. And then no matter what the cops say,
[22:44.900 --> 22:50.580]  do or threaten you with, you shut the fuck up. And Dave was able to go in. We got the whole,
[22:50.580 --> 22:56.260]  the script is copyrighted. Am I being detained or am I free to go is I believe copyrighted.
[22:56.260 --> 23:03.060]  And then we have trademarks for shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up Friday, STFU Nation,
[23:03.060 --> 23:11.460]  hashtag STFU. And it certainly wasn't a, you know, file this and we got it the next day.
[23:11.460 --> 23:20.020]  These took years and particularly the shut the fuck up one, which I would gladly let Dave
[23:20.020 --> 23:26.660]  talk about and explain how that process, I, it was like a two or three year process or something
[23:26.660 --> 23:34.820]  like that between trying to get it, getting rejected and then being able to utilize some
[23:34.820 --> 23:42.500]  recent case law and then lots of evidence, lots of evidence to show why it was distinguishable
[23:43.060 --> 23:49.700]  to us. So I, I'm pretty much here, like I said, to chime in a little bit because this
[23:50.500 --> 23:57.700]  remarkable trademark and copyright work that he did for us out of these foul words, which we've
[23:57.700 --> 24:04.740]  now kind of made a living on at this moment and going forward, teaching people their rights and
[24:04.740 --> 24:10.260]  yet protecting our intellectual property that we've created over the last five years. We worked
[24:10.260 --> 24:15.860]  very hard to get those million followers and all the views and everything we've done once it
[24:15.860 --> 24:20.820]  connected. So I'm Mark Wasserman, Pop Brothers at Law, and I will shut the fuck up.
[24:23.140 --> 24:28.420]  Thank you, Mark. I want to jump into something really quickly that Sheila had touched on earlier.
[24:28.420 --> 24:31.460]  And I think it's one that in the industry, people are wondering about a great deal,
[24:32.100 --> 24:38.180]  which is, you know, when are strains or when are cultivars going to be patentable? I know that I'm
[24:38.180 --> 24:42.820]  asked the question all the time, and I know that, you know, clients are trying to figure out who's
[24:42.820 --> 24:46.740]  holding back genetics, you know, what kind of genetics are out there. I know that there's been
[24:46.740 --> 24:52.260]  groups out there that have certainly made a real play to try to put everything out in the public
[24:52.260 --> 24:57.220]  domain. Other ones have been, you know, accused of making that claim only to sort of be sitting
[24:57.220 --> 25:01.620]  on genetics library that eventually, you know, they're going to try to monetize in some way.
[25:02.340 --> 25:08.340]  But, you know, I always look at what happened with heirloom varieties of different vegetables
[25:08.340 --> 25:13.220]  that Monsanto eventually crossbreeded and then, you know, made sure that they owned the underlying IP
[25:14.100 --> 25:18.500]  for those, that if anyone else ever grew their varietals, that they would be given a cease and
[25:18.500 --> 25:22.580]  desist. And I think the fear in the cannabis industry is that something substantially similar
[25:22.580 --> 25:26.420]  is going to happen, and that ultimately it's going to be owned by big business and that, you know,
[25:26.420 --> 25:31.940]  smaller cultivators are not going to have the patent protection that they need, because there's
[25:31.940 --> 25:36.660]  no way to file for it currently. And by the time that does happen, then, you know, perhaps the
[25:36.660 --> 25:41.780]  deepest pockets win. So, Shiel, do you want to speak to that? And maybe Sandra, you jump in as
[25:41.780 --> 25:48.420]  well, because I'm sure you guys are both dealing with this. Sure. So, there is, you can absolutely
[25:48.420 --> 25:56.100]  file for it already, and there are already issued or granted patents for cannabis cultivars. And so,
[25:56.100 --> 26:03.460]  there's two types of ways to patent a cultivar. One is a plant patent, and a plant patent is much,
[26:05.220 --> 26:11.460]  much, what, not the opposite of prior, much more narrow in scope, sorry, it was a long night. So,
[26:11.460 --> 26:18.260]  it's much more narrow in scope in that it only protects genetically identical clones. So, you're
[26:18.260 --> 26:24.020]  talking about a cultivar, and let me back up one step. We're talking about asexually propagated
[26:24.020 --> 26:28.500]  plants. So, we're not talking about popping a seed, and you grow something, and now you own it.
[26:28.500 --> 26:34.900]  We're talking about you've bred, you have a breeding program, you selected, and, you know,
[26:34.900 --> 26:40.420]  breeders can speak about this more than I can, but this is, you know, a very lengthy process to get to
[26:40.420 --> 26:45.060]  a cultivar that meets all the desirable characteristics and is stable enough that
[26:45.060 --> 26:50.340]  you can continue to asexually reproduce it. And so, at that point, then maybe that's something
[26:50.340 --> 26:56.340]  that you want to think about patent protection for. And patent protection makes the most sense
[26:57.060 --> 27:01.380]  for, you know, where you're going to be giving away some of your clones. If you're only the only
[27:01.380 --> 27:05.940]  person who's ever going to be growing any of your cultivars, then, you know, all you need to do is
[27:05.940 --> 27:11.460]  really make sure no one ever gets it from you. But if you're going to be licensing, you're going to
[27:11.460 --> 27:15.940]  license to growers, or you're going to be selling your clones, and you want to have some sort of
[27:15.940 --> 27:23.140]  control over what people can do with those clones, who can, you know, whether they can use them, make
[27:23.140 --> 27:28.980]  them, then that's where it makes sense to think about patent protection for plants. And so, that's
[27:28.980 --> 27:34.660]  a plant patent. In terms of, I get asked a lot about cost, you're probably looking in the five
[27:34.660 --> 27:41.380]  to eight thousand dollar range for a plant patent. Again, it's not very broad in scope.
[27:41.380 --> 27:47.540]  It's a single claim. It really is a botanical description of the plant and of what you cross to
[27:48.100 --> 27:53.140]  obtain the plant. Definitely something you want to work with somebody who's experienced in plant
[27:53.140 --> 27:58.260]  patents to obtain, because there are some missteps, in particular with respect to trademarks.
[27:58.260 --> 28:02.340]  If you use your trademark names in your plant patent, then you're going to lose your rights to
[28:02.340 --> 28:09.060]  your trademark names, because that then becomes the generic term for those cultivars. And so,
[28:09.860 --> 28:14.180]  that's a little bit about plant patents. And then there's also utility patents.
[28:14.180 --> 28:19.460]  And utility patents are much more broader in scope, and that's really where you've developed
[28:20.500 --> 28:27.060]  a plant that is substantially new and non-obvious. So, it's got some new characteristic or feature
[28:27.620 --> 28:32.420]  that you're going to be able to overcome those hurdles with respect to non-obvious over all the
[28:32.420 --> 28:38.340]  plants that already exist. And it's much more difficult to obtain, much more expensive,
[28:39.140 --> 28:46.500]  much more extensive disclosure required, and then the examination procedure is more extensive.
[28:46.500 --> 28:51.940]  But the additional benefit that you get with a utility patent, in addition to that broader
[28:51.940 --> 28:58.100]  scope of protection, is you can also prevent others from breeding with your protected plant.
[28:58.180 --> 29:04.100]  So, with a plant patent, you can prevent others from making, using, selling, and importing,
[29:04.100 --> 29:07.940]  but you can't prevent them from breeding with it if they do obtain it.
[29:07.940 --> 29:12.580]  And there was something else I was going to say about plant patents
[29:14.660 --> 29:21.380]  in terms of, oh, why do we allow this with such a simple disclosure? The reason really comes down
[29:21.380 --> 29:28.020]  to genetics. So, if you think about any two or three or four siblings from the same parents,
[29:28.020 --> 29:34.180]  each one of those siblings, even though they came from identical parents, have different DNA and are
[29:34.180 --> 29:38.500]  novel and non-obvious, if you think of them in terms of patenting people, which you can't do.
[29:38.500 --> 29:44.260]  But if you think about it in that way, it's necessarily novel and non-obvious. It's new,
[29:44.260 --> 29:49.860]  it's never existed before, and its genetics are different than anything else that exists. And so,
[29:49.860 --> 29:57.700]  that's why it is relatively easy to obtain plant patents if you think about that the scope would be
[29:57.700 --> 30:03.700]  you and not your brother, or not your sister, or not any of your extended family. It really is
[30:03.700 --> 30:10.100]  only you. And so, that's one way to think about plant patents that I think is helpful. But in
[30:10.100 --> 30:15.780]  terms of availability, it's now. It's definitely something that's available. There may be some
[30:15.780 --> 30:21.780]  outstanding questions about enforceability, but availability and enforceability, so you can get
[30:21.780 --> 30:28.740]  the plant patent now, the plant patent term is 20 years. Maybe it's questionable whether you
[30:28.740 --> 30:32.580]  can enforce it in a federal court right now, although we already have seen some patent
[30:32.580 --> 30:37.860]  litigation, not plant patent litigation. But we've seen some cannabis patent litigation that so far,
[30:37.860 --> 30:42.420]  federal courts are entertaining. That was sort of the baseline question that we had as patent
[30:42.420 --> 30:46.740]  attorneys is, would a federal court even entertain this, or would they throw this out as
[30:46.740 --> 30:52.420]  this is federally illegal? We're not even going to entertain any patent claims. And so far, there have
[30:52.420 --> 30:58.580]  been some case law, and unfortunately, the first that we all had our eye on stalled out because of
[30:58.580 --> 31:05.860]  a bankruptcy of one of the parties. But the judge did say that once the bankruptcy issue is resolved,
[31:05.860 --> 31:11.620]  they would resume the patent litigation once they had the authorization to do so. So, definitely an
[31:11.620 --> 31:17.700]  interesting area for people to be looking for, especially anybody who is a plant breeder and has
[31:17.700 --> 31:21.380]  some asexually propagated plants or has really developed something new.
[31:26.180 --> 31:30.740]  Senator, do you want to pop in there and opine? Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's,
[31:33.380 --> 31:40.580]  I'm going to be, I have a client relationship, and my former partners, one of my former partners
[31:40.580 --> 31:44.580]  involved in litigating this case for the clients. I want to be a little careful with what I say,
[31:44.580 --> 31:58.260]  but there's a case involving, this isn't patent, this is trademark and trade name issue, but
[31:59.140 --> 32:05.060]  there's a lot of value attributed to it. And there was a question, this is really more of a cautionary
[32:05.060 --> 32:12.900]  tale, but there's a question right now as to whether or not this particular name is the
[32:12.900 --> 32:24.020]  trademark and trade name of the particular company, or if it is the name of a strain of cannabis
[32:24.020 --> 32:32.740]  plants, which is generic and essentially usable by anyone who has the right to use that plant.
[32:32.740 --> 32:38.260]  So in other words, is Xerox a name for a company or is Xerox a name for
[32:40.100 --> 32:44.500]  anything that copies two pieces of paper? So like Girl Scouts Cookies or Gorilla Glue.
[32:45.460 --> 32:52.900]  Right. And it's, from my perspective as a corporate lawyer, right, the litigators
[32:52.900 --> 32:58.500]  are obviously digging into this case and finding it very interesting. And I'm reluctant to comment
[32:58.500 --> 33:03.220]  about it any further because I just can't remember how much of this has been publicly
[33:03.780 --> 33:09.860]  commented on and from the public filings and what isn't publicly available. But suffice it to say
[33:09.860 --> 33:20.500]  that from a corporate lawyer perspective, the IP stuff remains a rather significant wild card,
[33:20.500 --> 33:26.980]  because a lot of the answers to those questions are a collective shrug of the shoulders, right?
[33:26.980 --> 33:34.660]  We don't quite know yet how federal courts are going to assess patents. The stuff, Rob,
[33:34.660 --> 33:38.340]  you and I have talked at length about that very question you had about Monsanto, right?
[33:39.780 --> 33:47.780]  Is somebody else going to become the Monsanto of cannabis and try to strong arm all of the
[33:47.780 --> 33:52.260]  little cultivators into paying licensing fees because they've gone out and patented
[33:53.060 --> 33:58.260]  a bunch of strains? I think the likelihood of that happening anytime soon is relatively
[33:58.980 --> 34:07.460]  low, but that doesn't mean it's zero, right? And certainly, to the extent people have
[34:08.100 --> 34:15.300]  unique strains and to the extent people are building a lot of value and customer loyalty
[34:15.380 --> 34:22.820]  around those particular strains, then the question is, how can they protect that?
[34:23.780 --> 34:31.860]  Is it just simply naming it and having trade secret and trade dress and eventually trademark
[34:31.860 --> 34:40.580]  type protections without a patent on that with respect to the chemical compound or the botanical
[34:41.060 --> 34:48.420]  properties of it? Or are they able to get patent protection? Because from my perspective as a
[34:48.420 --> 34:54.900]  corporate lawyer, a patent protection is nice if you can make it practically relevant to you.
[34:56.020 --> 35:07.140]  If all you can do, as I think Sheila was talking about earlier, is you patent one plant,
[35:07.140 --> 35:18.020]  but that doesn't prevent you from having someone else take that plant, breeding it with something
[35:18.020 --> 35:28.020]  else and creating a new offspring that is not something that's free of your patent rights,
[35:28.020 --> 35:33.380]  well, then that patent isn't as valuable as it would be if it's something that can take care of
[35:34.100 --> 35:41.380]  anything that might be bred with that particular plant, right? And so right now, from a corporate
[35:41.380 --> 35:46.100]  perspective, long-winded way of saying there's a lot of attention paid to it because there's so
[35:46.100 --> 35:53.700]  much value that can be attributed to it down the road. Right now, though, I don't think people are
[35:54.500 --> 36:02.100]  getting very large valuations off of their patent IP in the traditional cannabis space.
[36:02.100 --> 36:07.460]  Not that they're getting zero, but I don't think they get the same type of value attributed to
[36:07.460 --> 36:16.260]  their patent portfolio as a pharmaceutical company gets on its patent portfolio. It hasn't gotten to
[36:16.260 --> 36:22.180]  that order of magnitude yet because there's a lot of question marks. So Rob, can I jump in for a sec?
[36:22.820 --> 36:26.900]  Yeah, I was going to actually have you jump in, Dave. And I was going to take it one step further
[36:26.900 --> 36:30.820]  and say we've discussed this a lot from the standpoint of trademark and who's got a better
[36:30.820 --> 36:34.660]  claim to a name. And we've talked about from the standpoint of Harvest versus Harvest,
[36:35.220 --> 36:40.340]  the other ones that have been settled. Can you jump in and talk about what the order is as far
[36:40.340 --> 36:45.780]  as when you do a name search and what you advise clients or how you look at it from the standpoint
[36:45.780 --> 36:54.100]  of who's got a better claim to a name, even on the trademark side? So right on the trademark side,
[36:54.100 --> 37:00.420]  yeah. I mean, whether it's for the cannabis industry or whether it's for any industry,
[37:00.420 --> 37:08.260]  really one of the preliminary things, if not the first step, is if somebody is developing a new
[37:08.260 --> 37:12.580]  trademark, thinking about introducing a new trademark with a new product or a service,
[37:12.580 --> 37:17.220]  hopefully they come to us first sooner rather than later before they've invested too much in
[37:17.220 --> 37:21.460]  the trademark. And we can do a clearance search and see what the availability is.
[37:23.140 --> 37:31.220]  And oftentimes I try, whether it's in the cannabis industry or not, but particularly in the cannabis
[37:31.220 --> 37:36.660]  industry, because operators in the cannabis industry seem to be particularly terrible.
[37:37.460 --> 37:44.100]  Forgive me if any of you are operators out there. I'm saying this because I'm trying to make things
[37:44.660 --> 37:54.020]  interesting, sometimes controversial, but I'll just say entrepreneurs and business people in
[37:54.020 --> 37:59.300]  the cannabis industry tend to be particularly terrible about naming things for reasons I'll
[37:59.300 --> 38:06.180]  explain in a second. And so what I try to do is when a client comes to see me for the first time,
[38:06.820 --> 38:12.180]  I beg them not to tell me what their trademark is. I don't want to know what their trademark is.
[38:12.740 --> 38:18.580]  I want to be able to lay out the rules of the road for what in the eyes of the trademark office
[38:18.580 --> 38:24.100]  and the eyes of the court makes a good trademark. You can rate all trademarks on a scale of zero to
[38:24.100 --> 38:29.380]  10. Zero is the worst, 10 is the best. So what are the rules? How do you get closer to a 10 in
[38:29.380 --> 38:35.220]  the eyes of the trademark office and the eyes of the court? And there are a number of rules of the
[38:35.220 --> 38:41.700]  road, things to do and things not to do when naming. And the reason I take a shot at my
[38:41.700 --> 38:50.660]  clients in the cannabis industry is because they have a propensity for picking names that are
[38:50.660 --> 39:00.260]  common like Harvest, Emerald, Verde, Green, Canna, something like that.
[39:00.260 --> 39:00.900]  Mary.
[39:01.860 --> 39:08.660]  Mary. Or, I mean, we literally have seven clients who have Humboldt in their trademark.
[39:09.860 --> 39:14.820]  It's like the post office. It's like the most wanted wall at the post office. We have to put
[39:14.820 --> 39:19.860]  pictures of our clients and their trademarks up on the wall in the office so we can keep them
[39:19.860 --> 39:26.340]  straight. So if we're having trouble keeping straight all the Humboldt, all the Trinity
[39:26.980 --> 39:32.580]  clients, imagine what the public is having, is trying to do distinguishing all these products.
[39:33.140 --> 39:38.820]  So really, yeah, there are some rules of the road. Try to be as unique as possible.
[39:39.460 --> 39:45.300]  My classic example, and because I'm pretty sure most of the people on this call, if they're not
[39:45.300 --> 39:50.100]  lawyers, they're pretty smart business people, they'll get this. On the zero to 10 scale,
[39:50.820 --> 39:58.580]  when naming something, Apple as a trademark for computers and small electronic devices,
[39:59.140 --> 40:06.100]  even though it's a dictionary word, it's a 10 when it's used for computers and small
[40:06.100 --> 40:12.500]  electronic devices, because in that context, it's totally unique. But the same word, Apple,
[40:12.500 --> 40:18.900]  if I was starting a line of Apple, if I was creating a line of Apple sauce or Apple juice,
[40:18.900 --> 40:25.540]  would be a zero. So trademarks are very context specific. And so this is,
[40:28.340 --> 40:33.060]  I'm curious if Sheila has the same, grapples with the same issues that I do all the time, which is
[40:33.060 --> 40:40.500]  trying to counsel clients on picking a good name before they get too far down the road, or maybe
[40:40.500 --> 40:45.220]  having to change horses if they're six or 12 months in and come to us after the effect. But
[40:45.380 --> 40:50.260]  it's a challenge. It's particularly a challenge in the cannabis industry because of
[40:50.900 --> 40:56.020]  how much everybody wants to use all the common prefixes and suffixes.
[40:57.460 --> 41:00.660]  Yeah. I've actually got a buddy in the audience right now who had to change his company name,
[41:00.660 --> 41:06.180]  I think three times. And maybe I'll bring Mike up a little bit later to discuss it. But
[41:06.180 --> 41:09.220]  I know it's certainly difficult for him to go through that process.
[41:10.020 --> 41:16.580]  So one of these humble guys should rename themselves Apple Cannabis. Is that what we're
[41:16.580 --> 41:23.540]  hearing? That might be pretty cool. Apple is such a strong trademark. I wouldn't be surprised if
[41:23.540 --> 41:32.820]  they think they own Apple for cannabis too. I once wrote an article, use an I and go to jail,
[41:33.460 --> 41:41.300]  you know, in terms of iPhone, iPod, iPad, because Apple will go after any small electronic company
[41:41.300 --> 41:48.500]  that uses I as a prefix for a small handheld electronic device. They're pretty aggressive.
[41:48.500 --> 41:54.180]  But they'll also go after anyone who uses any piece of fruit. So I've seen them go after
[41:54.180 --> 41:58.500]  a company in the UK. They lost that one, but who tried to use a pear.
[41:59.460 --> 42:04.820]  Wow. That's aggressive. That's aggressive.
[42:05.780 --> 42:10.820]  But I think it's important that people that are listening here and listening on YouTube right now
[42:11.460 --> 42:16.020]  are aware that one of the most important decisions you make is naming a cannabis company. And
[42:16.660 --> 42:24.500]  to your point, Dave, I see the obvious Mary this green that humbled this so frequently that when
[42:24.500 --> 42:28.340]  people come to me and say, I've got this great name for a new company, and they lay out what it
[42:28.420 --> 42:32.740]  is, my first reaction is, you know, there's 20 other companies that sound just like that. Like,
[42:32.740 --> 42:36.260]  why don't you go back to the drawing board and come up with something that may not evoke the
[42:36.260 --> 42:39.780]  emotion that you think it's going to, but it actually ends up being unique and ends up being
[42:39.780 --> 42:44.900]  really exciting. Because, you know, once you explain what the name means or why it came to
[42:44.900 --> 42:50.180]  you or what the story behind it is, some of the best named companies in our industry don't have
[42:50.180 --> 42:54.500]  anything that associates with the cannabis at all. You know, I went through it when I named,
[42:54.500 --> 42:58.420]  you know, our private equity firm to a Tara, you know, that's named after a lizard and people said,
[42:58.420 --> 43:02.260]  okay, well, you know, why would you do that for the cannabis industry? And our answer was that
[43:02.260 --> 43:07.540]  it's the only living dinosaur that's been around for 60 million years that has survived, you know,
[43:07.540 --> 43:13.140]  during every single period of change in the world. So if you're going to navigate a really difficult
[43:13.140 --> 43:16.740]  industry, then you want to be a survivor. And that's where we camped the two Atari name.
[43:17.300 --> 43:22.580]  When I named Linnea, I named it because Carl Linnaeus was the father of all genus and species
[43:23.060 --> 43:29.780]  for plants for plant botany. He wrote the book. And what people don't often know is that cannabis
[43:29.780 --> 43:35.140]  sativa L the L stands for Linnaeus. So, you know, when you think about doing something that's not
[43:35.140 --> 43:39.860]  obvious, the other reasons my partners are twins and they run a private equity firm or a family
[43:39.860 --> 43:44.580]  office in Boston, that's called twin focus. And the flower that was named after Carl Linnaeus is
[43:44.580 --> 43:49.300]  called the Linnaeus borealis, AKA the twin flower. So when we came up with that name, that was,
[43:49.300 --> 43:52.580]  that wasn't something we just came up with overnight. We put a lot of thought and a lot
[43:52.580 --> 43:57.380]  of time into, you know, why Linnea and how are we going to change the name enough that still
[43:57.380 --> 44:01.620]  makes people that understand botany think about Linnaeus without actually, you know, using their
[44:01.620 --> 44:07.700]  name. So two great stories. I mean, perfect, really well thought out, really well thought
[44:07.700 --> 44:12.900]  out, well reasoned. And they aren't ones that are obvious to the person, you know, most people in
[44:12.900 --> 44:17.060]  the cannabis industry. I can't tell you how many people in the cannabis industry, but have absolutely
[44:17.060 --> 44:22.740]  no idea that, that cannabis sativa L, the L actually stands for Linnaeus. It's, you know,
[44:23.380 --> 44:26.900]  when I tell people, it's like, I had no idea. It's, you know, I was just think cannabis sativa.
[44:27.700 --> 44:32.740]  So, you know, perhaps Mark, you want to jump in here. I mean, I'm sure you advise your clients
[44:32.740 --> 44:37.220]  all the time as well. The other thing of this, I know you're more criminal in nature, but any
[44:37.220 --> 44:45.060]  stories on, on kind of, you know, advising clients on their naming choices? No, we, when we, we mostly
[44:45.060 --> 44:49.540]  deal with that in our consultations, because people come to us and they want to get into the
[44:49.540 --> 44:54.660]  cannabis business space and we go over licensing and all that good stuff. And they always want to
[44:54.660 --> 44:58.900]  tell them, I want to be a brand. I want to have my brand and how do I do this? And how do I do that?
[44:59.540 --> 45:08.020]  And I want to name my brand this net and, you know, a lot, well, geez, I going back 10 years
[45:08.580 --> 45:14.500]  when we were representing, you know, cooperatives and collectives, and you had guys doing this
[45:14.500 --> 45:21.540]  Vader extracts this and all these names related associated with Disney characters and Disney
[45:21.540 --> 45:26.020]  things. And I think there are some lawsuits that were, you know, that have come in and are still
[45:26.020 --> 45:33.220]  going on, but we just, you know, told everybody that we ever came in contact with like, that's,
[45:33.220 --> 45:37.620]  that's going to come to an end. Eventually you're going to have to change things eventually when
[45:37.620 --> 45:42.740]  things go legal. And I think way back then, nobody, yeah, it's never going legal. So who cares?
[45:42.740 --> 45:49.300]  You know, nobody who really got deep into it thought it was going to go, you know, where,
[45:49.300 --> 45:55.860]  where, where it is now. And so to that end, we just, we saw a lot of different people come through
[45:55.860 --> 46:02.180]  and still who like to use some type of exotic names and, and in the cannabis space, it's just
[46:02.180 --> 46:08.020]  even much, much, much more restrictive because of the, the nature of keeping away things,
[46:08.020 --> 46:12.500]  things away from kids and making it less attractive to kids. And so people have all
[46:12.500 --> 46:16.420]  these ideas with animals that they want to use and different things like that.
[46:16.420 --> 46:22.980]  And so as general advice, we're going to advise not to do those things, but to always
[46:22.980 --> 46:27.220]  call Dave Brantman and make sure you check out everything you need to know about the
[46:27.220 --> 46:33.940]  intellectual property surrounding your cannabis business, because it is flooded with it in many
[46:33.940 --> 46:36.820]  different areas. And I'm Mark Wasserman, I'm shutting the fuck up.
[46:39.620 --> 46:44.980]  So I know we've talked to, or at least touched on patents around plants, but, you know, I see in the
[46:44.980 --> 46:48.580]  audience, a few extractors I know pretty well, and I'm going to bring a Dr. Mark up here in a
[46:48.580 --> 46:53.620]  minute. Cause I know he's got a question, but from the standpoint of, you know, composition of matter
[46:53.620 --> 46:58.900]  patents or process patents, I would think in the extraction industry, there's so much is happening
[46:58.900 --> 47:04.980]  from a scientific perspective that is unique and novel that a certain point, you know, I think some
[47:04.980 --> 47:09.380]  of these guys should be rewarded for trying to figure out ways to get extraction done that
[47:09.380 --> 47:13.460]  they've never, no one else has thought of, you know? And so I know that I'm looking at Colin,
[47:13.460 --> 47:18.580]  I'm looking at Dr. Mark down there. I think Brad Milshaker just joined the group as well. So,
[47:18.580 --> 47:24.340]  you know, we've got three really well-known extractors in the audience. Dave or Sandra or
[47:24.340 --> 47:28.100]  Sheila, you know, do you want to jump in and sort of discuss things that are getting much more
[47:28.100 --> 47:32.260]  scientific in nature than just plant botany and plant physiology, and even the really technical
[47:32.260 --> 47:37.620]  aspects of being a gardener, but now getting into the next level, which is on the extraction side,
[47:37.620 --> 47:41.620]  or, you know, getting down to isolates and distillates and how you get there, as well as
[47:41.620 --> 47:46.180]  all the new products are coming out, whether it's, you know, rosins or solventless, there's so many
[47:46.180 --> 47:50.180]  new, unique things that are happening in the space and people are holding onto the IP of what they're
[47:50.180 --> 47:54.900]  doing and how they get there very, very closely, because I think at a certain point, they'd like
[47:54.900 --> 47:59.220]  to be able to protect that IP, but I just don't think it's available to them yet. Can either of
[47:59.220 --> 48:07.700]  you speak to that right now? Sure. So, I think that what's been most pressing on people's minds
[48:07.700 --> 48:15.700]  is this lawsuit that was filed in December by Canopy Growth against GW Pharma for CO2 extraction.
[48:16.580 --> 48:22.180]  And, you know, and that brings up a really interesting point, and I think it's something
[48:22.180 --> 48:28.020]  we're going to see quite a bit in the early patent litigation. I think it's frustrating to a lot of
[48:28.020 --> 48:34.580]  people because, you know, was this or is this new or was it new and non-obvious at the time that it
[48:34.580 --> 48:40.660]  was patented? And one thing you need to understand about the patent process is that the USPTO
[48:40.660 --> 48:47.700]  examiners, you know, they're technically trained and they're limited by what's in the prior art,
[48:47.700 --> 48:53.380]  so what was made publicly available. And so, when they get a cannabis application, one,
[48:53.380 --> 48:58.420]  especially these early ones, one of the difficulties is was there any prior public
[48:58.420 --> 49:03.780]  disclosure enabling disclosure? So, not just there's this thing called CO2 extraction, but
[49:04.660 --> 49:09.460]  CO2 extraction exists and here's an enabling disclosure that will teach you how to make and
[49:09.460 --> 49:16.900]  use this invention. And if the examiner can't find that in the public domain, then the examiner's
[49:16.900 --> 49:23.140]  hands are tied and they issue the patent, and we end up with patents that probably have very broad
[49:23.140 --> 49:28.340]  claim scope. And one of the interesting things about this patent in particular is it didn't
[49:28.340 --> 49:36.100]  start out as a pure CO2 extraction where you're just ending up with a CBD. It actually started out
[49:36.900 --> 49:42.500]  as it was owned by the company who manufactures, I'm going to mess up the name, but I think it's
[49:42.500 --> 49:47.700]  called Drabinol, which is a palliative care medicine. So, there you're talking about that
[49:47.700 --> 49:54.660]  also includes THC. And what the process really was was a multi-step process that had, you know,
[49:55.220 --> 49:59.460]  at least I think five or six steps, the last of which was they were converting some of the CBD
[49:59.460 --> 50:06.820]  isolate back to THC, again, because this was for pain. And what happened is when GW Pharma acquired
[50:06.900 --> 50:13.140]  that patent, or not, sorry, when Canopy acquired that patent, they filed, they changed the direction
[50:13.140 --> 50:18.420]  of a second patent that was filed. And they found out there was a, you know, broad enough disclosure
[50:18.420 --> 50:24.980]  and a lack of prior art and went for it and were able to obtain these ridiculously broad claims
[50:24.980 --> 50:32.340]  that have just two steps. And so, you know, that I kind of digressed a little bit to say, I think
[50:32.340 --> 50:36.100]  what's going to happen, there's going to be some frustration in the industry initially with these
[50:36.100 --> 50:41.140]  overly broad patents that are granted and asserted. And in this case, I really think it's
[50:41.140 --> 50:49.460]  more of a publicity stunt or maybe to become the big dog in the cannabis industry that everybody
[50:50.340 --> 50:55.220]  licenses their patents. You know, if they can get GW Pharma to license, then, you know,
[50:55.220 --> 51:00.580]  everybody's going to be afraid and license. One interesting thing about that patent in particular
[51:00.580 --> 51:07.380]  is it's set to expire in about a year. They have some additional patent term. But the one that has
[51:07.380 --> 51:15.780]  the THC conversion step at the end, it has, I think, 2,048 more days left after the expiration
[51:15.780 --> 51:20.340]  of patent term adjustment. So I think they're going to try to get people to license that one.
[51:20.340 --> 51:26.100]  But to answer your question, I absolutely think, you know, once we get past this state, you know,
[51:26.100 --> 51:30.900]  it'll be a lot like other industries where we have this baseline of what is in the art,
[51:30.900 --> 51:35.620]  what's known in the art, what's in the public domain. And the examiners will be able to search
[51:35.620 --> 51:41.700]  that. And that's when we'll see the innovation, you know, that's being patented be true innovation
[51:41.700 --> 51:46.980]  and true advancements in the technology. Because you're absolutely right, Rob, there's just so much
[51:46.980 --> 51:52.020]  technology there that is, you know, we haven't seen yet. And that's definitely being developed.
[51:52.740 --> 51:58.100]  And that people, I think, are absolutely, some of them are filing for patent protection,
[51:58.100 --> 52:03.940]  and the others are probably keeping it as trade secret. And the difference and the decision there
[52:03.940 --> 52:09.780]  is, you know, what risk do you want to take? If you patent, you're publicly disclosing what you're
[52:09.780 --> 52:15.940]  doing. So in exchange for that public disclosure, you are getting this 20-year monopoly, limited
[52:15.940 --> 52:23.380]  monopoly to, you know, the goal there being that we would advance the science behind it by teaching
[52:23.380 --> 52:28.020]  others how to make and use what you're doing. Whereas trade secret is you're keeping it in
[52:28.020 --> 52:33.700]  house, you're keeping it secret, and you don't have to register it. And you don't, you know,
[52:33.700 --> 52:38.820]  but you do have to actively protect it as a trade secret. You do have to be able to show if you're
[52:38.820 --> 52:43.940]  ever going to get any misappropriation of trade secrets that you took all of those steps.
[52:43.940 --> 52:48.740]  And the downside, you know, the upside, it could go on forever, and it's a lot less expensive than
[52:48.740 --> 52:54.740]  patents. But downside, if it is misappropriated, that's the end. It's just not secret anymore. And
[52:55.700 --> 53:00.260]  if that happens two years in, five years in, or if you're Coca-Cola and you're able to keep it
[53:00.260 --> 53:05.620]  as long as they did. But the interesting thing about Coca-Cola is they didn't just use trade
[53:05.620 --> 53:10.420]  secret. It's, I hear people talk about Coca-Cola and their success is because they have this trade
[53:10.420 --> 53:16.420]  secret. They actually had a design patent, trade dress, trade marks, you know, copyrights. They
[53:16.420 --> 53:24.340]  had every other kind of IP playing into their whole IP game. So that was a really long-winded
[53:24.340 --> 53:28.740]  answer, but it was mostly to agree with you, Rob, and I think that's absolutely where we're
[53:28.740 --> 53:36.260]  going to see the patents go. Thanks, Sheila. Hey, Rob. Yeah, Dave, go ahead. This is Mark.
[53:36.260 --> 53:41.060]  Can I comment on that particular patent? That's exactly the question I wanted to ask Sheila.
[53:42.100 --> 53:46.100]  Yeah, by all means, Mark. Jump in. And I want to go to Eddie Dee in just a second. He's been,
[53:46.900 --> 53:50.260]  his hand raised first in this whole room, so I'm trying to go in order.
[53:50.900 --> 53:55.220]  OK, go ahead. I don't want to go out of order. Go ahead, Eddie Dee, you're first, buddy.
[53:55.220 --> 53:59.860]  That's OK, because it's relevant to what we just were talking about. And please, you know,
[53:59.860 --> 54:03.140]  jump right back in, Sheila, and then Eddie will come to you next. And we'll try to cycle through
[54:03.140 --> 54:08.100]  to everyone that's got their hand raised. Yeah, I'll try to make it brief. Hi, Sheila. Thanks so
[54:08.100 --> 54:14.100]  much for breaking that down. You know, I am an expert, suitably skilled in the art. And I'll
[54:14.100 --> 54:20.180]  tell you, that claim number one is totally obvious. There's no invention there. I don't
[54:20.180 --> 54:26.900]  understand the invention. Supercritical CO2 has been used in botanical extractions forever.
[54:26.900 --> 54:32.020]  There's nothing that's surprising there at all. I don't even know why that thing was examined.
[54:33.380 --> 54:38.260]  So I don't think it would hold up in an infringement case against it, because there's
[54:38.260 --> 54:45.140]  lots of prior art. And in fact, there's a whole bunch of companies that sell CO2 extraction
[54:45.140 --> 54:50.340]  machines. So are all the clients that they sold CO2 extraction machines also infringing
[54:50.980 --> 54:57.700]  on this very broad, obvious claim one? I can read it to you, and I could read it to the rest
[54:57.700 --> 55:05.780]  of the audience if we want to go through it. But it's out there. It's US patent number 10,87632,
[55:05.780 --> 55:13.300]  known as the 632 patent. And again, I'm an expert in the field. And I can tell you that this thing
[55:13.300 --> 55:19.620]  would not hold up in an infringement case against it if it weren't cannabis, like if this were some
[55:19.620 --> 55:26.580]  other botanical. There's nothing new here. And there's no secret Coca-Cola formulation.
[55:27.220 --> 55:32.580]  There's no million-dollar invention here. I think this is just companies playing patent games
[55:33.300 --> 55:43.140]  with each other and playing with phantom value of supposedly valuable IP.
[55:45.380 --> 55:51.780]  I always look at these patents. I always go to claim number one and read the most important claim
[55:51.780 --> 55:57.620]  in the patent and find out what they really own. And you'll find out that, yeah, a lot of these
[55:57.620 --> 56:04.180]  things probably wouldn't hold up in an infringement case against it if it weren't cannabis-related.
[56:04.180 --> 56:09.220]  That's the real 800-pound gorilla in the room. Because it's cannabis-related, do these things
[56:09.220 --> 56:16.100]  actually hold up when you actually have a valid case that would stand up in an infringement case
[56:16.100 --> 56:21.380]  against it? I don't think this thing will stand up. And yeah, I think maybe this is just an
[56:21.380 --> 56:26.580]  exercise to invalidate what seems to be an obvious patent, which isn't a patent at all.
[56:28.100 --> 56:33.700]  I agree with you completely. And I actually looked through the prosecution history, so the back and
[56:33.700 --> 56:38.820]  forth between the applicant and the examiner. There was some prior art cited that was other
[56:38.820 --> 56:45.380]  botanical extraction methods. And it may just be the case. These examiners have, I think the
[56:45.380 --> 56:51.060]  statistic is three hours to completely dispose of a case start to finish. Some of these
[56:51.060 --> 56:56.580]  specifications you can't even read in three hours. So it's really just a bunch of keyword searching.
[56:56.580 --> 57:02.980]  How well did the examiner understand the invention? How good was the examiner's search?
[57:02.980 --> 57:10.420]  And did the examiner have the right references? I would expect that if this lawsuit continues,
[57:10.900 --> 57:15.940]  that patent will be invalidated. What will probably happen is they will settle short of that
[57:15.940 --> 57:20.980]  because Canopy isn't going to want to have an invalid patent even if it expires in a year,
[57:20.980 --> 57:26.660]  because it will affect the patent. It's the earlier patent, but it will affect their other
[57:26.660 --> 57:34.820]  patent. But I 100% agree with you. And the issue is this was filed almost 20 years ago. So what
[57:34.820 --> 57:38.900]  was in the public domain 20 years ago? And I think you're right. It's going to have to go to
[57:39.460 --> 57:43.380]  other botanical extraction methods that were existing and just having the right
[57:43.380 --> 57:49.380]  references in front of the judge. Absolutely. Thank you, Sheila. Thank you so much for your
[57:49.380 --> 57:54.180]  work. I've listened to you in a few different rooms now and I'm following you. So thank you
[57:54.180 --> 57:59.700]  for everything you're doing. Thanks, Rob. I'll jump back down now. Hey, Rob, I had just one quick
[57:59.700 --> 58:06.900]  comment about the Canopy lawsuit as a reference point. And Sheila and Sander may in particular
[58:06.900 --> 58:15.860]  have some insight into this, but I noticed about a month ago that GW Pharma, the defendant in that
[58:15.860 --> 58:21.540]  lawsuit, was purchased by another company called Jazz Pharma. Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
[58:21.540 --> 58:29.460]  Right. So I'm not a patent lawyer and I don't play one on TV, but it occurs to me that Jazz
[58:29.460 --> 58:34.900]  isn't too worried about the lawsuit. Yep. You're exactly right. Well,
[58:34.900 --> 58:38.820]  they certainly paid a large premium to the current share price when they purchased GW.
[58:39.380 --> 58:43.860]  I think they purchased it for a 50 or 60 percent premium on the current share price at closing.
[58:44.500 --> 58:50.020]  So anyone that was a holder of GW did relatively well in that trade as immediately.
[58:50.980 --> 58:55.860]  That's the company that brings us GHB, right? So why shouldn't they be the GW?
[58:57.300 --> 59:02.820]  They got the cornering of the G market, right? But one thing that is interesting, Dave, that you
[59:02.820 --> 59:07.860]  bring up is that both GW and Canopy, one's a Canadian company and one's a British company,
[59:08.420 --> 59:13.620]  that when we think about cannabis-based trademark and IP, things that aren't available to us in the
[59:13.620 --> 59:17.460]  United States, are we doing ourselves a great disservice as a country by not making these
[59:17.460 --> 59:21.620]  things available to our entrepreneurs because they are available in other countries that have
[59:21.620 --> 59:25.540]  a different regulatory system where they can file in their own country and then try to say that
[59:25.540 --> 59:31.220]  they've got a better claim because they got a Canadian patent granted or a European patent
[59:31.220 --> 59:35.940]  granted. So in a very similar way that a lot of the Colorado companies would probably be the
[59:35.940 --> 59:39.860]  biggest companies in cannabis today if it hadn't been for the fact that the Colorado government 10
[59:39.860 --> 59:45.940]  years ago decided you couldn't be a publicly traded company in Colorado in cannabis. So that's
[59:45.940 --> 59:51.140]  the reason we didn't see Live Well Go Public or the Clinic Go Public or Green Solutions or any of
[59:51.140 --> 59:54.420]  those other guys back then is because they had prohibitions on what they could and couldn't do,
[59:54.420 --> 59:58.900]  and it allowed the Illinois companies and some of the other domicile companies to leapfrog them
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:04.260]  even though they weren't doing nearly the same revenue. So are we artificially tying the hands
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.740]  of our own companies? And again, let's speak to that maybe a little bit later because I want to
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.260]  give everyone else that's been waiting a chance to speak, but I would like to touch on that before
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.940]  this conversation ends. Eddie, what's going on, man? How are you doing tonight?
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:22.420]  Oh, Rob, man, I'm feeling blessed. Thank you for having a room and for all the moderators on the
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:27.300]  stage, you guys have definitely made an impact in your own perspective community, so I appreciate the
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:35.540]  room and the platform you guys put together. I have a question. Okay, so I am in the process
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:42.500]  of building my personal brain, and one of my main taglines is I get high and I'll work out.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:48.740]  It's catchy, and it's actually something that I do. I smoke before workouts, and I actually smoke
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:56.420]  after workouts. What'd you say, Mark? I'm just clapping.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.500]  I do it before workouts and after workouts, so I'm building my personal brand,
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:10.420]  but at the same time, I'm also building a clothing line as well as a supplement line as well.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:19.780]  I think what I'm trying to figure out is what do I need to trademark? Do I need to trademark my logo?
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:28.980]  Do I need to trademark my clothing line, and should I trademark or try to get something in
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.980]  regards to my tagline? Because it's kind of similar to Mark, is shut the fuck up.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:38.980]  My tagline is I get high and I'll work out, so this is a wealth of knowledge on the stage,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:47.310]  so I'm excited to hear from you guys. Well, maybe I'll jump in first and then ask for
[01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:55.790]  assistance from Sheila. Don't ask a trademark lawyer if you should get a trademark. I mean,
[01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:06.270]  and I say that facetiously. I mean, we are often going to recommend that if you're interested in
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:12.270]  you know, building up your intellectual property assets, copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:22.430]  secrets, we can help you identify what you have, logo, the words for the slogan, I get high and I
[01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:31.230]  work out, the logo, if you've got a graphic logo, and then help you identify which of the 45
[01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:36.030]  different categories of goods and services that the Patent and Trademark Office divides all
[01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:44.590]  products in the world that you can think of up into, which of the 45 classes you are or will
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:51.710]  be eligible to register your trademarks in, help you do a trademark search. I mean, those are all
[01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:57.230]  the kinds of things that clients, and one of the reasons I invited Mark from the Pop Brothers on
[01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:03.710]  is not just because he's a cannabis defense lawyer, but because he's actually, he and his
[01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:09.150]  brother Craig are a perfect example of what happens when a client walks in the door and says,
[01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:17.310]  I've got something, I've got a trademark, I've got a brand name, I have an idea, I have an invention,
[01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:21.630]  how do I protect it? I mean, that's the same question I've been asked. I realized I've been
[01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:27.150]  asked that question probably 500 to a thousand times in 40 years in one version or another.
[01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:39.150]  So you got to decide whether you want to invest in the time and the energy and the dollars to try to
[01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:44.270]  build up some assets. And then somebody, you know, people, there's, there are people like Sheila and
[01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:50.750]  I out there who love doing that. And, you know, as Rob said at the beginning, we can't give
[01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:56.750]  specific legal advice, but, you know, in general, when somebody comes in, I'll say this, when
[01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:02.670]  somebody comes in with a slogan, like I get high and I work out, the first thing we're probably
[01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:09.310]  going to do is do a trademark clearance search, look at the patent and trademark office records,
[01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:17.390]  look at some unregistered sources, like particularly in your case, Weedmaps and Leafly,
[01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:28.190]  Google search, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and see if anybody else is already using that
[01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:35.070]  phrase so that you don't invest in something that either you can't get registered or is going to buy
[01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:41.950]  you a lawsuit or both. I'm not sure that helps answer your question, but I hope it helps a little
[01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:51.290]  bit. Maybe I can jump in from the corporate lawyer perspective, because one thing I would say is,
[01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:56.010]  and again, it's not legal advice, but having heard a similar, you know, similar questions
[01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.530]  throughout my career, both in the cannabis industry and actually many more times not in
[01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:07.530]  the cannabis industry. You know, I'm a California based corporate securities lawyer, and I've done
[01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:12.090]  a whole lot of work in the technology space, for example, and in the entertainment, new media space.
[01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:17.690]  And so a lot of these questions, a lot of companies that are startup in nature are really
[01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:23.050]  driven by the value of their intellectual property. And one thing I do tell people is, you know,
[01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:30.090]  certainly you need to budget funds for your corporate lawyers because, you know, we're the
[01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:35.290]  best looking, but you also need to budget, perhaps even more importantly for your intellectual
[01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:40.410]  property lawyers, because that's where the value is going to be. So when you have something as
[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:47.370]  clever as this, you definitely do want to make sure that you have intellectual property protection
[01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:53.850]  as early as it is economically feasible, because, you know, at some point, if you just start raising
[01:05:53.850 --> 01:06:02.090]  money and doing business, you're going to forget, or it's not going to be a priority until it's,
[01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:09.450]  until you've already sacrificed some of the value that you could have by seeking intellectual
[01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:14.970]  property advice early. So I don't know if that's helpful, but, you know, you certainly, you're
[01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:18.650]  asking the right question because you want to get that answer quickly before you invest a lot of
[01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:29.010]  money into something that ultimately may or may not be protectable. Thanks, Xander. Kay, how are you
[01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:33.730]  doing tonight? What's going on? Hey, I'm great. Can you hear me? I always have to check on the reception.
[01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:39.010]  We can hear you. Okay, great. I don't, I didn't mean to raise my hand. Maybe I have pocket
[01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:44.450]  hand raised, but I do have a couple questions and a couple concerns. Something, I don't want to
[01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:47.970]  completely change the subject, but something that came up this morning when we were talking in a room
[01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:55.170]  is this room is being recorded, I assume, because Peter's here, right? That is correct, yes. Okay, so
[01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:00.530]  I love that. I love that I can go back and access that information. We were just talking about ways
[01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:04.290]  that, you know, these are, these rooms are being recorded and can be monetized. At the bottom of
[01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:10.450]  the room right now, we have this cat character named Bill, and if you look at Bill's profile,
[01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:18.210]  he is a clubhouse analytic tool, and that's a really interesting thing. So I'm wondering
[01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:23.490]  what's going on with those. I mean, if you go through all his nominations, you go, you'll get
[01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:29.570]  really quick into these, you know, cyrillic looking character names of people, so it gets very bizarre.
[01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:34.530]  I don't know if anybody else has noticed that and if that's a thing, but my real question is this.
[01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.610]  I think the cannabis industry, a lot of, especially the smaller players who maybe
[01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:43.490]  haven't gotten to the point where they can actually trademark and patent anything,
[01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:52.370]  are really interested in the decentralization of everything right now, and if there's, blockchain
[01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:58.050]  is going to alleviate these problems, are we going to basically be able to open source
[01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:06.610]  our information and make it free for all, and if that does happen, will that cover people,
[01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:14.050]  and that's mostly just so that we don't get stuck with utility patent use for clones down the road,
[01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:19.410]  but can anybody speak to that? Is blockchain kind of the opposite of what you're talking about?
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:30.570]  Way over my head. The NFT system blockchain is not something I understand, so if there's
[01:08:30.570 --> 01:08:37.550]  anyone else on the panel that can answer that, please have at it. Yeah, maybe that's a discussion
[01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:43.390]  for another time or another group of people, but a lot of folks are talking about using blockchain
[01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:49.950]  in a way to basically open source everything, maybe not trademarks of people's, you know,
[01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:58.270]  personal brands, but as far as IP and clones and, you know, cultivars and everything else,
[01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:02.430]  that's been a discussion, and I'm just wondering if any of the people here have had any experience
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:09.870]  with that yet. Hey, Rob, this is Colin Palmer, I've had some experience with medicinal genomics
[01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:14.510]  and their blockchain efforts, so I'd recommend taking a look at what Kevin McKernan's doing over
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:20.430]  there. He's got a really good outfit and some really good tools, so I recommend anyone that
[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:24.990]  wants to, you know, look at genomic research to take a look at what he's doing. That's actually
[01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:29.470]  where I kind of got the idea from, but, you know, it's kind of this, you know, taking from the
[01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:35.150]  Grateful Dead model, you know, anybody can show up and record, right? It's this open source idea, so
[01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:44.750]  does that cover you enough once it's in blockchain? You know, I've been told that it gives you prior
[01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:53.630]  art, however, I don't know how, you know, valid that would be in terms of if you went to the math on it.
[01:09:55.230 --> 01:10:01.310]  I don't know enough about blockchain to really answer this question, but I've thought a lot about
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:06.910]  open source with respect to patents, and it's something, you know, that the Open Cannabis
[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:14.350]  Project was working on before kind of all the fallout with Phylos, and my thoughts on it are
[01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:21.070]  that the difference with, and maybe this will tie into blockchain, but the difference with, let's say
[01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:26.350]  software, where there's a lot of open source software, is that software has copyright
[01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:34.110]  protection that's immediately attached to it, so you have some IP protection that's already at play,
[01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:38.830]  whether you do anything else or not, and, you know, typically you would have to register it as well,
[01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:44.350]  whereas when you're talking about other things outside of something that has copyright protection,
[01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:50.910]  so an idea or a plant, for example, then you don't have that protection that immediately attaches,
[01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:57.230]  so I guess if blockchain were somehow foolproof, and there's, you know, I can see where it's more
[01:10:57.230 --> 01:11:01.630]  of a timestamp, but I don't understand it enough to know, you know, is that also going to prevent
[01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:05.630]  somebody from ever stealing it from you, which is what a patent would do, would kind of give you
[01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:13.790]  that recourse in a court of law to assert patent infringement and have some legal recourse there,
[01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:18.190]  and so I would think that with open source, you know, you lose that, and if there's not even that
[01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:22.990]  baseline copyright protection, then I don't know what you're relying on in the event that somebody
[01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:29.230]  does take and start using your invention. How does that work globally moving forward?
[01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:34.270]  Are our patents here in the United States, do they transfer all over the world?
[01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:43.790]  No, you have protection to make you sell and prevent import of your invention, but you don't
[01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:48.430]  have any, a U.S. patent doesn't give you any rights anywhere else. You would have to file in
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.830]  each of those countries, and you can claim priority to your U.S. provisional application,
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:57.870]  but to get global patent protection, you're really talking about major markets, you know,
[01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.350]  unless you have very deep pockets, and you're filing in each of those countries individually.
[01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:08.750]  Great, thank you. And Kay, that was what I was speaking about before referring to GW and Canopy,
[01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:14.190]  is, you know, you have to go through the process in every single major market, so whether it's Japan
[01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:22.110]  or China or countries in the European Union. For pharmaceuticals, oftentimes, Ireland is the place
[01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:26.910]  where most people choose to file, and that's where they use the base of operations in the EU.
[01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.750]  So, it gets complicated, and it gets really, really expensive, so oftentimes, if you're granted,
[01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:35.070]  or not even granted yet, but if you filed your patent, and it's then been published,
[01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:40.190]  and it becomes now sort of open to the world to see that you filed, other people can try to take
[01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:43.950]  that and, you know, rush past the post in other markets if you're not on top of it, and you're
[01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:47.390]  actually spending the money to go into other markets to file the same patent. And again,
[01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:52.030]  this is, you know, I know very, very little by comparison to the other people on the panel
[01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:55.390]  outside of the work that I did at a pharma company previously, but, you know, Sander,
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:13:00.270]  maybe you want to jump in and discuss that. Yeah, look, I mean, I've done a fair amount of
[01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:08.350]  research and work in kind of the blockchain industry, as well as cannabis, although,
[01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:14.590]  frankly, there's a lot more real legal work to be done in the cannabis industry, in my view,
[01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:18.590]  than the blockchain industry. But as a securities lawyer, right, the blockchain
[01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:25.070]  industry is kind of where a lot of the action has been, right, are security tokens or utility
[01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:32.910]  tokens, securities, that sort of thing. But it strikes me not having looked into it deeply, but
[01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:37.070]  you got to remember what a blockchain is to decide whether or not it's going to help you,
[01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:44.510]  right? If people use that word in a lot of different ways, but if you look at a blockchain,
[01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:52.030]  like the Bitcoin blockchain, which is, you know, a distributed, decentralized, encrypted ledger,
[01:13:52.750 --> 01:14:01.310]  using kind of public key, private key encryption, what you have is you have a decentralized
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:12.190]  electronic, essentially, spreadsheet, almost like a ledger of transactions. And what makes it very
[01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:18.030]  powerful, at least in the context of Bitcoin is just the way that it's mined, and sort of the
[01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:23.950]  algorithm used that limits its supply, and that's how Bitcoin becomes valuable. But you can do a lot
[01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:28.750]  of things with a ledger. But again, it's still just a ledger. So if what you're talking about
[01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:37.550]  is, say, intellectual property, just on its own, well, a decentralized ledger might give you access
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:46.350]  to something that is otherwise a trade secret. And, you know, having your token or your position
[01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:53.230]  on the blockchain might give you kind of physical access to it. The larger question is, is that
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:15:00.190]  ledger, is that tokenized set of rights going to be respected by a court? And in fact, how would you
[01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:07.390]  even go about getting into a court to say, for example, hey, I have rights to this particular
[01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:12.270]  strain, or I have rights to this particular name, or whatever it might be, because I purchased it
[01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:18.030]  on an exchange through, you know, I've got this digital right. Well, the question is, who on behalf
[01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:22.590]  of the digital rights holders is going to enforce that right, where it actually matters, which is
[01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:28.110]  going to be the PTO or a court of law. Now, if it's organized correctly, it can happen, right?
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:35.950]  You can see a situation where, for example, there's like a bond indenture, where you have
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:41.390]  an indenture trustee that represents the bondholders. You could have the same thing for the token
[01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:49.070]  holders. And so you could have an actual token holder trustee that goes out to enforce those
[01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:56.270]  rights in the case of infringement situations, or to defend them if it's challenged,
[01:15:56.990 --> 01:16:05.790]  or to go and to prosecute if somebody, if it's a patent situation, to go in before the PTO
[01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:17.790]  and try to comment on applications that might infringe on that patent that's held by the token
[01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:23.630]  holders, or by the trustee for the benefit of the token holders. So that sort of situation you can
[01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:29.630]  see develop, and that's probably what's being contemplated. But right now, for that to happen,
[01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:38.510]  for this to be put onto a blockchain, in my view, the blockchain has to be a better solution than
[01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:45.150]  what is currently available. Otherwise, it's not going to be adopted. And so far, I don't think
[01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:51.630]  I've seen a big groundswell to change the current system, at least on behalf of cannabis companies.
[01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:56.830]  But again, other people that are a lot smarter than I am about this are doing work. And so if it
[01:16:56.830 --> 01:17:01.230]  happens, yeah, you could see situations where the blockchain would become relevant. But I don't know
[01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:08.270]  if it would replace the current system without changing current law. Yeah, it's really interesting
[01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:12.190]  me what the possibilities that could happen with this. And this is basically following the NFT
[01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:19.150]  model of, you know, through Ethereum, these tokens being assigned to, you know, art, and how people
[01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:25.310]  can buy in shares to art, and people can buy in shares to your IP information. Or if we're just
[01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:30.590]  basically putting it out there that kush is a thing, and we all know it's a thing and hands off,
[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:35.710]  you can't use it for anything anymore, and own it. So I'm just really interested in where this
[01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:41.470]  is going. And I don't mean to upset a bunch of lawyers. Oh, no, no, no, I agree. It's not,
[01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:47.150]  it's not gonna upset lawyers, because, you know, the nice thing about lawyers, we're like fungus,
[01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:53.390]  we'll find something to do, even if you change the rules. But it's more, it's more like, no,
[01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:58.830]  the question is, the thing about crypto, which is fun, as you get into it, right, is,
[01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:07.230]  it's like that, that old version, or that old joke about teenage sex, right, where,
[01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:10.430]  you know, a lot more people are talking about it than are actually doing it. And the ones that are
[01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:15.470]  doing it have no idea what the fuck they're doing. And it's, you know, that's what blockchain is a
[01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:19.950]  similar concept where people say, oh, my God, we can put, you know, we can put this on a blockchain.
[01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:27.230]  And but blockchain technology has been around for a dozen plus years now. And a lot of the things
[01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:32.270]  that people thought would be, would be tokenized haven't. And it's not because they can't, it's
[01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:36.910]  because there isn't an actual market for it yet. So that's the question. The question is, is there
[01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:42.830]  going to be a demand for people to tokenize intellectual property rights? And if so,
[01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:49.630]  how would it happen? It very likely might happen. But and people are working on it. The real question
[01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:54.510]  is, is it going to, is it going to, is it going to solve a problem in a good enough way
[01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:59.310]  that people are going to adopt it, or try to get it adopted, and run to Congress to get the laws
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:05.070]  changed if that's necessary, to, you know, recognize these, these digital rights, you know,
[01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:12.830]  as opposed to, as opposed to, you know, rights in the, as they currently exist. Right.
[01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:17.150]  So, Dan, that was an amazing quote.
[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.790]  Yeah, I agree. That was hilarious. Which one?
[01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:25.870]  You had a couple gems. Lawyers are like fungus.
[01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:28.590]  We're like fungus. Yeah, we'll find something to do.
[01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:37.230]  Okay, I hope we can answer your question. David, I've got David Hess coming in right now,
[01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:41.950]  who's an investor in the canvas space with Trust Capital. He's been involved in the space a long
[01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:47.470]  time. Before I get to you, David, one quick housekeeping thing. You know, as Kay pointed
[01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:51.790]  out, yes, we are being recorded. Yes, this is on the future canvas project. So if you go to their
[01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:56.830]  YouTube channel, I advise people follow future canvas project, what Peter's done with that
[01:19:56.830 --> 01:20:01.630]  channel. He's got thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of content on every imaginable
[01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:06.110]  topic you can think of, just amazing amounts of traction. So our conversation that we did last
[01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.670]  week in, in this room, and I'll, and ask me anything about canvas, had about 250 people
[01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:15.070]  that were listening to it live, but then add over the week, about 6,000 additional views.
[01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:19.230]  So, you know, people are going to use this as a resource and go back and use Peter's
[01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:22.750]  YouTube channel. So if you're not familiar with it, future canvas projects,
[01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:26.670]  a terrific resource for you with that, David has what's going on, man.
[01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:36.510]  Hey, happy Sunday to you as well. Thank you. What a great, great room. I just,
[01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:45.390]  it might be a little bit of a broad question. So excuse me for that in advance. But, you know,
[01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:53.710]  as an investor in the space, we get asked all the time, you know, how to apply value to the IP.
[01:20:55.470 --> 01:21:03.150]  And I'm just wondering, you know, if some of the IP attorneys on the panel had some thoughts there,
[01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:10.590]  are there any nuances or, you know, subsectors sectors? I mean, you know, IP, you know, and value
[01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:16.670]  is relative, right? So, you know, I know it's a very, it could potentially be a very long and
[01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:22.590]  deep discussion. But if there were any few, you know, pointers, you know, that you could highlight
[01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:28.110]  something just for us to think about as investors in this space, as it relates to IP, that would be
[01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:38.510]  very helpful. I'll take first crack at that, maybe, if that's okay, Dave speaking. So general
[01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:45.470]  concept that I like to share with people, and David, you probably already know this, but I'll
[01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:54.270]  say it anyway, for anybody that this is new to on the phone. Your question is super relevant
[01:21:55.070 --> 01:22:00.030]  to all businesses, but especially the cannabis industry, where if you've ever gone to any of
[01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:05.070]  these pitch sessions, like Arcview, the valuations are out of control and don't make sense. No
[01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:08.990]  disrespect to Arcview, they're doing a wonderful job. For the most part, what they're doing is
[01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:17.470]  sometimes the pitch sessions are a little weird. But conceptually, you know, a Kia and well, let
[01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:23.230]  me back up. Somebody says, hey, my company's worth $20 million because I got a patent. Well,
[01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:33.470]  hey, a Kia and a Maserati are both automobiles, but they're not the same. So not all IP,
[01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:41.630]  not all patents, not all trademarks, not all copyrights are created equal. And I don't
[01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:49.550]  personally try to actually get down to the nitty gritty and value intellectual property
[01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:57.310]  for clients, something that they could take to an investor or take to a bank or take to a court in
[01:22:57.310 --> 01:23:04.910]  the event of a dispute. But there are companies out there, several companies, maybe many companies,
[01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:12.190]  but at least several companies, this is their business. Their business is evaluating IP purposes,
[01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:21.950]  of evaluating IP for either purposes of licensing, purchase or sale or litigation or divorce.
[01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:31.230]  And I think and some of them are getting experienced in valuing IP, cannabis IP,
[01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:39.310]  although, you know, they use traditional, they'll use traditional tools in a non-traditional
[01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:43.550]  business to try to value the IP in the cannabis context. But at the end of the day,
[01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:51.470]  you got to look at, you know, other similar IP and sales. And do you have any sales? Do you not
[01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:59.710]  have any sales? Are sales going up or sales going down? What are similar products being valued at?
[01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:07.070]  And this is what the experts do. And there are several that I know of around the country. And
[01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:12.110]  then I'm not sure that helps, but I hope it helps. I hope it helps a little bit.
[01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:17.630]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely. You brought up, you know, a smaller point that I was going to,
[01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:24.190]  to, you know, to bring up as well as where on the list of priorities, you know, does IP lie
[01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:30.110]  when doing diligence on a deal, right? You brought up revenue and traction, right? All sorts of other
[01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:36.830]  great things that we look at. You know, I mean, I was about to say you'd be shocked, but you
[01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:39.870]  wouldn't be shocked at all, right? Especially as you mentioned in cannabis evaluations.
[01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:47.950]  But let me pose this question. And I use this a lot when talking with clients about whether or
[01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:54.750]  not they should patent something or strict or stick to trade secrets or stick to trademarks
[01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:59.310]  and copyrights. If for the, for the company, I forget the name of the company. I think it's,
[01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:08.190]  maybe it's Kimberly Clark that owns the Q-tip brand of, of cotton ear swabs is the IP value
[01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:14.110]  in that company in the trademark or in the process for twisting cotton on the end of a cardboard
[01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:21.790]  stick. And if a hundred years ago, here's a fun question, David, you know, there's no right answer
[01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:26.990]  or wrong answer exactly. If a hundred years ago, I came to you and I said, Hey, I've invented this,
[01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:33.550]  this thing, this, this ear swab, I've got twisted cotton on the end of a, on the end of a cardboard
[01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:40.350]  stick. And I will, I've got a patent and a trademark on Q-tip and the process. I'll sell you
[01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:47.870]  either one, but not both for 500 bucks. Which one do you think most people would have bought a hundred
[01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:54.830]  years ago, the patent or the trademark? I would think the trademark. It's your,
[01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:59.870]  if they were smart, you're right. Interesting. Very good. The patent.
[01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:06.430]  Most people say, when I asked that question, most people say patent, but the patent process,
[01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:11.470]  but the patent ran out after 14 years, the trademark never runs out. Exactly. And people
[01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:18.350]  remember the trademark. I mean, the company that makes Q-tips owns the market for cotton ear swabs.
[01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:24.590]  Target makes them. But the patent did give them the competitive advantage to, to get the,
[01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:31.710]  the market lead. Right. But which one would you rule it out? Yeah. No, no, you can't rule it out.
[01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:38.990]  No, I agree. And to answer your question, David, I, I haven't done any investor due diligence in
[01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:44.270]  the cannabis space yet, but I've done quite a bit in the biotech space. And what I see missing in a
[01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:49.550]  lot of these deals that I don't see the due diligence happening are just even simple things
[01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:54.830]  like, do they actually own their IP? I can't tell you how many trademark clients I have. And when I
[01:26:54.830 --> 01:27:00.830]  really try to figure out who owns this trademark, it's impossible with the way these companies are
[01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:06.030]  structured. And so, you know, do they own their IP? Do they, and this is one of the things that
[01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:10.990]  Kiva had a problem with in their litigation. And they tried to hurry up and get some back licensing
[01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:16.590]  and some, oh yeah, we had, it was licensed to the person who was using it. The thing about trademarks,
[01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:21.790]  if you're not controlling your trademark, you lose it. So if you have the trademark under your
[01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:26.670]  personal name, but somebody else is using it or a different company or entity is using it,
[01:27:26.670 --> 01:27:31.310]  and there's no license in place, like these are some basic questions that I think investors should
[01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:36.990]  be looking at is chain of title. Do they have their chain of title in place? Do they have
[01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:44.910]  ownership of this IP? Did somebody create this design that they've now mass using and the designer
[01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:50.350]  is the one who still holds the copyright rather than the company who's using it? On the patent
[01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:56.030]  side, really looking at the scope of the patents that they have. Do they actually have good claim
[01:27:56.030 --> 01:28:00.910]  scope that's protecting what they're doing and able to prevent others from doing it? And then
[01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:05.790]  on the flip side, there's two types of patent analysis that you need to do. Not only what is
[01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:10.430]  their patent cover, but are they infringing any patents? Because just because you have a patent,
[01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:15.150]  you can absolutely still infringe other people's patents. It's not permission to do what you've
[01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:20.590]  patented. It just means that you can prevent others from doing what you've patented. So doing
[01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:26.830]  at least some sort of freedom to operate diligence, or at least does the person that you're
[01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:31.310]  investing in, the company that you're investing in, what is their freedom to operate story? Do
[01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:35.230]  they have one? And so these are the types of things that I've seen in the biotech industry
[01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:41.550]  that I really hope to start seeing more of in the cannabis space when we talk about valuation of IP
[01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:50.510]  and what is the IP worth. Very insightful. Thank you so much. Not a problem. And just so everyone
[01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:54.030]  in the audience knows, I did turn off the hand raising. I'm trying to be respectful of the
[01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:57.550]  moderator's time on a Sunday night. I usually try to keep these rooms to about an hour and a half.
[01:28:58.430 --> 01:29:01.710]  But as we're not paying counsel tonight, and they're all doing this gratis for us,
[01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:07.470]  I think we're going to keep it to who's on stage right now to cycle through,
[01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:11.390]  as long as the moderators are OK to stick around a little bit longer. We've hit the 90-minute mark.
[01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:14.990]  But if they're willing to stick around, I'd like to get through the other five or six people that
[01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:21.550]  are on stage, starting with Sam that's up here. And Sam, before I even let you ask your question,
[01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:25.230]  I got a question from the guys on Future Cannabis Project that came through,
[01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:33.070]  was emailed to me, that I know you work with Mario and with the Sierbinskis. Did they trademark
[01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:36.910]  Sherbert and Sierbinski Gelato and some other things like that? Do you know anything about that?
[01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:39.710]  Because I know there's someone on Future Cannabis that's been asking.
[01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:48.350]  To be honest, I'm not sure what's in the process of being filed and what's been approved. But I
[01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:53.470]  know we work with a gentleman named Luke Zierman, who he's like an IP attorney that does a lot of
[01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:57.710]  stuff, not only in the States, but also internationally. And I know all that stuff's
[01:29:57.710 --> 01:30:04.830]  either in the process or it's been accepted or filed. But I honestly don't know more than that.
[01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:09.870]  Got it. OK, well, I'll reserve that one for another time. And did you have a question
[01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:14.590]  for anyone on the panel tonight? Yeah. Thank you so much, Rob. And thank you to all the moderators
[01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:20.110]  for sharing all the knowledge. Really appreciate it. I know earlier you guys were talking about
[01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:26.350]  how with patenting strains or cultivars or whatever the prop return is, excuse me for that.
[01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:32.510]  But you're talking about essentially what I heard is you'll be able to patent specific phenotypes,
[01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:39.630]  but pretty much different phenos of certain strains or cultivars won't apply. And then if
[01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:44.510]  they use that phenotype to breed and create something with it, then that's kind of like
[01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:50.510]  free game. My question is, even if you have like and I apologize if I misunderstood that, but
[01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:54.350]  my question is, if you do have a phenotype or a strain or cultivar, whatever you want to call it,
[01:30:54.350 --> 01:31:00.190]  patented, from what I've seen in California, like, you know, every test result is different.
[01:31:00.190 --> 01:31:04.830]  And so I don't really understand how you can patent something that technically comes out like
[01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:11.230]  different every single time, if that makes sense. It makes total sense. And it's a big problem,
[01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:16.030]  particularly with cannabis that varies so wildly depending on, you know, the conditions that it's
[01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:21.470]  grown. So the issue is, so you're not actually, even though you're describing it botanically,
[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:26.510]  and it sounds like phenotype, you're talking about genotype. So you're talking, you know,
[01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:31.710]  and you're describing what you've crossed to get what you have, and you're describing it botanically,
[01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:36.350]  which is going to differ depending, but really you're talking about somebody is describing how
[01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:42.110]  they created this particular cultivar, not I have this cultivar in my possession. I don't know where
[01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:48.350]  it came from, and here's what it looks like. So you really are talking about genotype, and when
[01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:55.550]  you go to enforcement, you would then compare the genetic sequencing of what you have and what
[01:31:55.550 --> 01:32:01.310]  you're alleging that somebody stole from you. And so I hope that helps to clarify that. And the other
[01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:06.430]  thing that I'll mention about patenting, I mean, patenting plants, it's a very particular,
[01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:11.550]  at least for plant patents, utility patents is different, but for plant patents, you're really
[01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:16.350]  talking about using that in connection with some really strong licensing and some trusted partners.
[01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:22.430]  You're talking about giving your clones to somebody who is under, you know, a very well-written
[01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:28.510]  agreement to do or not do whatever you specify. And then you're also talking about trusting that
[01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:34.430]  person to not run off with your plants and do other things. And if you ever want to like look
[01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:40.350]  at some examples of how plant patents and plant patent litigation works, California strawberries
[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:46.910]  are very heavily litigated. There was an excellent breeding program at UC Davis, it's still there,
[01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:52.670]  and a few of their breeders left, and there's been ongoing litigation ever since about whether
[01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:57.230]  they took any of the patented varieties of strawberries and whether they've, you know,
[01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:04.590]  the huge California strawberries that we see here are UC Davis's patented varieties. And so
[01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:09.390]  it's definitely a thing, and it's very complicated in the fact that, and I've been asked many times,
[01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:13.470]  why don't you have to submit sequencing? And I think this goes back to the question of how do
[01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:18.510]  you change the patent rules? You're talking about going to Congress and changing laws. And so
[01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:24.670]  based on when they were written, this is how they decided to have applicants apply for patents. And
[01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:30.270]  so, yeah, you're describing them botanically, and it sounds like phenotype, but it really is about
[01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:35.390]  genotype. Yeah, without getting too deep into it, because this could be a rabbit hole we could go
[01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:40.430]  down for the rest of the night, there's also lots of questions about, you know, many strains all
[01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:44.510]  started from the same land races and started from the same underlying genetics, and a lot of those
[01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:51.150]  are in the public domain as well. So at a certain point, you know, when someone mislabeled something
[01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:55.710]  10 years ago, and like NL7 became whatever else they decided to call it, or, you know,
[01:33:55.710 --> 01:34:00.510]  granddaddy perps first came out, or the first OG kushes, you know, there's been so many other
[01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:03.950]  things that have been called other names that basically start with the same underlying genetic
[01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:08.830]  as, you know, what it is that's labeled, that how far back do you go, you know, how much of the
[01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:13.070]  public domain is there, how much of it is novel, how much of it is, you know, open source at that
[01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:17.550]  point. So there's a great deal, I think, of non-answered questions in that, that, you know, perhaps
[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:22.270]  we'll do another discussion at another time, just discuss lineage and discuss, you know, how far back
[01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:27.390]  you can go to protect a phenotype or a genotype. So thank you, Sheila, for that response.
[01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:39.160]  Mike, how are you tonight? How are you doing? I'm not sure if you might be on a call. If you are, then
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:44.200]  I would love to move to Sai, because Sai, I know you're also a patent attorney or an IP attorney,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.440]  and I know you're recently getting involved in cannabis and work with a group I've been
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.960]  working with for years, so I'm really excited to hear what your question is and what you have to
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:57.080]  say on this topic. Yeah, thank you for having me, really appreciate it. My question is actually more
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:03.480]  on the trademark side and might be mostly geared towards Dave, but I was wondering that when
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.960]  cannabis becomes federally legal, do you foresee any complications with amount of trademark
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:15.000]  applications and opposition and cancellation proceedings with the floodgates that it would be
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:26.120]  opened? Sure, I mean, it's going to be wild, but, and again, I don't mean to be a downer cow,
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:33.240]  but I've been doing this kind of work since 2000. Move away, Dave, move away.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:42.760]  I've been doing this kind of work since 2009, 2010, and every year I've got a half dozen to
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:48.520]  a dozen clients and people more than that that I run into at trade shows who tell me this is the
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:55.080]  year that cannabis is going to become legal, and I'm getting grayer. Pro tip, no, it's not.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:02.360]  Next year? What? Pro tip, no, it's not. Pro tip, it's not going to get legalized this year
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.280]  for anyone that's still saying it today. Right, before the midterms.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.680]  Yeah, doubtful.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:20.200]  So even if we get to legalization, we have a long way before we have all of the regulations and
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:25.640]  legislation in place that's going to change the trademark situation. I think it'll look,
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:31.080]  do you think, Dave, a lot like the December 2018 Farm Bill and what the trademark office did with
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:39.560]  that? Right. I can speak bluntly, right? This is a group that ... It's been a shit show.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.840]  It's been a shit show at the trademark office trying after the Farm Bill to figure out what
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.840]  we can help our clients get registered trademark wise in the hemp and CBD area.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:02.920]  They've expanded the number of trademark lawyers, trademark examiners who are lawyers at the patent
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.440]  and trademark office who now review all the cannabis and hemp and CBD applications.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:17.480]  I don't know, Sheila, if your experience is same as mine, but to put it nicely, there's been a lot
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.480]  of inconsistency. Even though they have this so-called examination guide, they don't even
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:33.080]  follow it all the time. It goes back to something I think Sandra said earlier. Whatever the problem,
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:40.840]  we'll find a way to deal with it. But it has been and will continue to be challenging for a while.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:52.920]  But I will say I haven't seen as many cannabis companies suing cannabis companies
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.560]  for trademark infringement and now a little bit of patent infringement as I have in the last two
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:05.640]  years. In the old days, everybody kind of knew each other in the industry, at least in California.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:13.800]  There was a lot of, we're all in this together. And there were 2010, 11, 12, 14, 16, there were
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:20.280]  virtually no cannabis company versus cannabis company lawsuits. There were mainstream companies
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.600]  suing cannabis companies for trademark infringement if the cannabis company was
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:33.480]  doing a parody like Hashi's instead of Hershey's or Peppermint Daddy instead of Peppermint Patty.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:40.120]  But you didn't see cannabis companies suing cannabis companies. Now, one of the consequences
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:47.640]  I think of adult use and the flood of money that's coming into the industry is more and more of the
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:54.520]  people who are operating in this space are using traditional tools, namely the litigation system,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:03.880]  to cripple the competition. So when and if the trademark office starts allowing trademark
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:13.400]  registrations with cannabis, it's going to be wild. But hopefully we can, people like Sheila and I
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:22.840]  and Sai and others who practice in this area can try to help make sense out of nonsense.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.600]  And I think the one thing I'll add, and I know Dave, you probably meant to touch on this is
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:34.600]  we can't get protection for anything plant touching, but in almost every cannabis business,
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:41.240]  you have other goods and services that are not plant touching and that are federally legal.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.280]  And so there's definitely room for trademark protection. It's not perfect. We can't go in
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:53.800]  and say I'm cultivating cannabis that contains greater than 0.3% THC, but there are definitely
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:59.720]  other aspects of your business that we can provide protection. And then trademark protection
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:04.440]  is not just for the goods and services you described, but also a reasonable zone of
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:09.160]  expansion. When you get to reasonable, what the heck is reasonable? That's what we litigate about.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:15.240]  But the hope I think that we all have as trademark attorneys in this space is that we're able to
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:23.000]  get descriptions and in classes that would cover a reason that the reasonable zone of expansion
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.680]  would be what you're actually doing when that becomes federally legal so that somebody else
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.840]  couldn't then slide in and say, OK, you're providing information and consulting services,
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:41.000]  and I'm cultivating, and we're going to use the same mark. Ideally, the trademark office and court
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.080]  would say that's a reasonable zone of expansion. And so we're not going to allow two entities to
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:53.640]  exist with the same trademark where consumers might believe that this second trademark owner
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.960]  who is cultivating might be the first trademark owner. Because the whole point of the trademark
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:02.840]  system is actually it's consumer focused. We don't want consumers to be confused about who's
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:08.840]  providing the goods and services. Yeah, and that's, I mean, we spend a lot of time, you're absolutely
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:17.000]  right, Sheila, we spend a lot of time looking at 15 or 20 other classes of goods and services
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:25.160]  that are most commonly used by cannabis companies to get trademark protection for the ancillary
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.800]  goods and services that aren't cannabis and aren't cannabis touching and start building
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:34.680]  protection that way. You mentioned one of them, consulting services, clothing is classic,
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.400]  especially because a lot of cannabis companies really view themselves as lifestyle brands
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:47.640]  and go on to jewelry and entertainment services. So get trademark protection where you can. And then
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:53.960]  the related corollary to that is, particularly in a state like California, state trademark
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.640]  protection. I mean, California is the fifth largest economy in the world and therefore, arguably,
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:06.120]  no disrespect to anybody from anywhere else, but arguably the most important marijuana or cannabis
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:12.040]  economy in the world. And- Not even arguably, clearly by far and away, nothing even close.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.600]  Thanks, Rob. I just didn't want to step on anybody's toe from Canada or anywhere else.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:26.440]  So California is a great place to get some trademark protection and many other states
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:35.480]  that have decriminalized the growing, the cultivation sale and possession also allow
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.840]  for trademark protection. And so you kind of cobble together state trademark protection for
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:46.760]  cannabis products or cannabis touching services with federal trademark protection for non-cannabis
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:54.760]  goods and services. And now you start to have an interesting portfolio that really gives you
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:00.040]  an R and an ability to make that zone of expansion argument that Sheila was just talking about.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.200]  Yeah. And Dave, that's something you and I have talked a lot about, working on your clothing,
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.680]  working on other parts of your brand. I think Berners did a really nice job of that with
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:15.800]  cookies and really using the cookies apparel side to launch that platform. And then say,
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:20.600]  hey, I've already gotten a fair amount of traction around the mark and around the copyright of
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.920]  everything that's cookies related to the apparel before you actually went into cannabis.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:29.720]  So really good advice to those of you that are trying to figure out ways to start making a move
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.520]  into into canvas before you can actually do a lot of the things you can't do now is finding other
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:42.680]  ways to brand yourself outside of just the plant touching aspect of your business. Colin Palmer,
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:48.840]  not to step on Massachusetts toes, another great cannabis market and one that I spent some time in,
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.800]  but what's going on with you tonight? And so you're not offended by it,
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:58.680]  by the California centric nature of the panel tonight. Oh, not at all, man. Big fan of California
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:05.000]  and the market out there. There's a lot of talent. It's been big inspiration over the years, for
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.400]  sure. You know, I I heard earlier, you know, you guys were talking about, you know, filing IP
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:16.440]  versus keeping things trade secrets. I've always erred on the side of trade secrets.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:24.360]  And I just was was kind of curious when you think, you know, is there a right time to start
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.480]  inching yourself into thinking about a real patent or is that still a pipe dream?
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:36.200]  No, it's definitely not a pipe dream. So there's there's nothing about cannabis that's going to
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:42.840]  prevent you, at least not yet that I've seen from obtaining patent protection. And so I think the
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:48.040]  the one risk that I would say, especially in an industry like this, where everybody is sort of
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:53.160]  hitting the ground running, you know, at the from the same starting point, you have a lot of people
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:58.280]  who are independently inventing the same things. And one concern that I have with people who are
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:04.120]  who are really focused on the trade secret route is if your competitor independently arrives at the
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:08.200]  same thing and is able to obtain a patent, and maybe it's not even identical, but they obtain a
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:16.360]  patent broad enough to cover what you're doing. The US Patent Office switched in 2013 to from first
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:22.680]  to invent. So it used to be that I could cause an interference with someone who filed before my
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:28.600]  client. And I could say, well, my client has all their records dating back to X days. And we
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.640]  submitted lab notebooks and we could prove that we invented first. And therefore we were entitled to
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:39.880]  the patent over whoever had filed first. In 2013, that changed. And now it's a first to file system.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.000]  The USPTO is no longer in the business of deciding who who who invented it first, and they don't care.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.280]  It's whoever filed it first. So that would be kind of a major concern that I have. I would
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.920]  definitely want to be weighing what are my competitors doing? Is there any chance they
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.080]  might obtain patent protection for something similar or something that's going to cause
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.720]  me to have to take a license to their patents while I'm sitting here keeping things trade
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:09.720]  secret? If that's not a real risk and you're able to maintain your trade secret protection
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.080]  and and make sure that you keep everything proprietary and things like limiting access,
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.280]  marking things confidential, making sure everybody's signing appropriate agreements
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.840]  who does have access to it, then that that can definitely work. I would just want you to be
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.840]  considering, you know, there's there's a risk either way. And so every business decision is
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.960]  going to be balancing the risks and deciding which risks that you can tolerate and which you can't.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:44.760]  Thanks so much, Sheila. Appreciate the insight. Anyone else on that topic want to jump in?
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.140]  Okay, then Sarah, how are you tonight? And do you have a question for the panel?
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:59.700]  Hi, how are you guys doing tonight? I just want to say thank you, Rob, for having me up here.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:05.140]  I hopped into this room because I'm interested in the topic. I'm a law student right now. I'm
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:12.260]  a 1L. And when I saw the panel, I really wanted to ask you guys some questions because you guys
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:18.900]  have so much obvious experience in the industry. And as a 1L, I'm still kind of deciding like what
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:25.300]  I'm going to be doing. Actually, I'm picking classes in the next week. But I'm really interested
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:31.460]  in the cannabis law class that they're offering. And I wanted to ask you guys, you know, do you
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:37.460]  recommend it for, you know, young attorneys? Like, is this a path that you would recommend somebody
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:44.180]  go down? I see that like you guys are obviously you're California, you're West Coast, you've had
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:49.220]  a lot of success in the area, it looks like just by your profiles. And I want to ask that, you know,
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:55.700]  I'm from a state that is not California, you know, a smaller state, not quite as prominent in the
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:01.700]  marijuana industry, by any means. And I'm wondering, you know, is it worth pursuing something
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:07.380]  like that? Do you guys recommend the industry? So I'm just really curious. First of all, I'll give
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:11.460]  you the tongue in cheek response, Sarah, which is, you know, we don't recommend the law.
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.300]  Right? I knew there'd be something. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:21.220]  Yeah, absolutely. I'll run after this, I promise. Look, you've got some great attorneys on this
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:26.660]  panel right now. My legal career is very short. And now I do most of my work, you know,
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:31.460]  internally for myself as an attorney, I very rarely practice on behalf of clients. So I'm the
[01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:36.100]  wrong person to ask on this. But I can certainly say that there's no shortage of specialization
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:39.780]  right now in the cannabis industry. And I think that, you know, everyone that's on this panel,
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:45.380]  whether Sheila, Dave, Sander or Mark, they've all found a way to carve out a niche in their
[01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:50.660]  practices for cannabis. So maybe one of the other people on the panel can take a stab at, you know,
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:55.620]  Sander, you certainly have migrated away from corporate law into the cannabis. And, you know,
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:00.020]  Dave has certainly migrated away, you know, from his trademark practice. But, you know,
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.820]  why don't we take a stab at that? And by the way, Sarah, real quick, where are you going to law
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:08.180]  school? I'm actually going to West Virginia. So like I said, very small state. We're definitely,
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:15.060]  you know, we're behind on a lot of things. But I also think a state like ours needs people.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:21.220]  So, you know, this is such an interesting area. I mean, guys, I'm like, like I said, I'm so excited
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.100]  you have me up here for a moment, just because I can see the talent. I see that you guys probably
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:29.940]  have some awesome answers to this. So, you know, any recommendation is cool.
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:35.540]  Well, if environmental law is too exciting for you, then cannabis is,
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:41.540]  you know, the place to be. Seriously, though, it's actually, you know,
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.820]  the interesting thing about cannabis, this is Sander talking, by the way, is
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:54.020]  it is a combination of a lot of things. It's regulatory practice. But the companies that
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:50:00.900]  are in the industry are doing all sorts of things. I am sure a cannabis lawyer, but I'm still
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:05.940]  corporate securities, M&A, private equity lawyer. And that's what I do with a strong focus on the
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:10.100]  cannabis industry. But you have cannabis regulatory lawyers, you have litigators,
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:20.260]  you have tax lawyers. You know, my former firm was the headline firm in the leading 280E tax case,
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:23.700]  which is if you follow the industry, you know, that's probably one of the most significant
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:29.780]  issues the industry faces. So when you when you you don't you don't just become a cannabis lawyer,
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:33.940]  again, unless you just want you want to be a regulatory lawyer. Usually you're going to be
[01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:38.180]  a you're going to have a focus on the cannabis industry. And like most of the panelists here,
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:44.420]  you're going to be you're going to be at your core an IP lawyer or in my case, a corporate lawyer.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.980]  So go ahead and take the class. But, you know, don't forget, don't sleep through all your other
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:54.820]  ones because they'll be relevant to. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Anybody else that like I love
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:59.060]  the advice and I really appreciate it. I'm sure there's other law school students in here, too.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:06.900]  So it's this is Dave speaking. I'll share something with you that I haven't forgotten in the last 20
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:14.020]  years since I saw Carl Perkins, who was a great rockabilly singer, songwriter, performer who wrote
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:19.620]  Blue Suede Shoes, which Elvis made famous. He was the keynote speaker at South by Southwest
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:25.860]  Music Conference 20 years ago. And the theme of his keynote and I haven't forgotten it and I say
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:32.100]  it all the time is do what you love and the money will follow. So if you if you're if this is
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:40.340]  something that you think you would love to do and make your career, then yes. But if you're thinking,
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:44.820]  well, I'm not sure, sure, you know, it could be one of 20 different things I might want to do.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:51.620]  I don't know. But, you know, maybe maybe there's something else I might want to do. I can't quite
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:59.140]  tell. I would say follow your passion. Hate to sound like a cliche, but it's it's as true for
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:05.380]  lawyers as it is for anybody. Thank you. That's great advice, too. I appreciate it.
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:09.780]  I agree with. Oh, go ahead, Mark. No, no, no. Of course not. Sheila, ladies first, please.
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:17.700]  I agree with what's been said so far. And I would add, you know, I speak to a lot of
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:26.660]  last classes back at Pepperdine and at USC. And my biggest piece of advice is make sure you're in it.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:31.700]  You understand your why, because the cannabis industry is not easy. You don't have the
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:35.460]  precedence. You don't have you know, there's there's so many times where I've called the
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:39.220]  lawyers in this space and said, you know, sometimes I feel like I'm just making this
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:43.540]  shit up. I mean, it feels crazy to not have any precedent when you're kind of going up against
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:49.300]  a federal agency and every answer you get is different and conflicting. And so you definitely
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:54.100]  have to, you know, in terms of the and I don't even want to say thrill. That sounds hard with
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:58.980]  a lot of operators in here that, you know, this is thrilling to me. But the legal maneuverability
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:05.540]  It's also very exhausting. So you definitely need to to be connected to, you know, what is your
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:10.500]  purpose? Why are you doing this? And for me, that's definitely about creating better access
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:15.700]  for patients and consumers. And I, you know, through my trademark and my patent work. But
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:21.700]  going back to what Sander said, you you still you have to have your underlying practice. And so
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:26.260]  it could be anything. I have a great example of a lawyer who's been in the business for
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:32.740]  And so it could be anything. I have a friend who is in trusts and estates, and she's been
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:39.220]  asking me questions about cannabis, because how do you value cannabis as an asset? And if there's
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:44.180]  regulations about who can hold a cannabis license, what happens when a license holder, when a license
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:50.180]  holder dies and who does it pass through? So, you know, definitely take the class. I think it'd be
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:55.460]  really interesting. And then also figure out what is the particular area of law you want to focus.
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:59.540]  And then I'm sure there's going to be an aspect of that that will touch cannabis. And you can
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:03.380]  definitely carve out a niche in that way if cannabis is something you're truly passionate about.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:08.500]  Thank you so much. I have a property class tomorrow, so I'll have to ask her that.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.260]  That's so I'm learning that. But that's so great. Thank you.
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:20.580]  This is Mark with Pot Brothers at Law. I agree with everything that the other panelists have said.
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:27.220]  And when it comes to cannabis and the areas of law that surround it,
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:34.260]  you know, there's just multitudes, obviously, in this intellectual property area, just one of them.
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:42.980]  I handle criminal defense and business. And so to have a, I guess, a cannabis class, of course,
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:50.340]  when I went to law school in 1990, whatever, there was no cannabis class. And I can only imagine what
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:56.020]  it is. I'd be curious to know. I'd like to see the whatever it is when they say,
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:59.940]  this is the cannabis class. What are they going to teach you? Because one of the things that we
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:07.620]  have to deal with is going to criminal court after our clients who have licenses and permits and are
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:13.620]  doing everything right are taken on the side of the road, detained and arrested, $250,000
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:19.380]  confiscated. And all that stuff still happens to them. And we get cases dismissed, but they still
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:24.980]  have to go through it. I mean, you got to know criminal. You know, that's another area that
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:30.260]  is deep in there. So I'm really curious to know what they actually mean when you're taking a
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:38.420]  cannabis class. But if you are truly interested in getting into the cannabis space as an attorney,
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:47.220]  then I would encourage you to pursue it because the space needs so many more good, honest,
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:55.140]  ethical attorneys, because there are horror stories about those attorneys who are just
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:56:00.420]  the exact opposite and jumping on a gravy train, taking money from people without explaining how
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:04.500]  it's done. And then they run out of money and leave them inside the side of the road.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:10.260]  So if you're somebody and it seems like you are who has a genuine interest, then it's needed.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:16.260]  And it might even be incumbent upon you to explore it as much as you can. And I'm Mark
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:20.820]  Wasserman, Pop Brothers at Law, shutting the fuck up. And real quick, sir, I'm going to jump in on
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:26.180]  that and just say that there's so many different ways to specialize in cannabis within the practice
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:30.900]  of law. But if you're looking for one that's going to really expand over the next couple of years,
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:35.220]  I think as a 2L, you're going to take con law and definitely pay attention to your con law class and
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:40.340]  specifically start paying attention to the Dormant Commerce Clause. Study Wicker v. Filburn very,
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:45.940]  very closely and get a sense of what you can expect with interstate commerce as a result of
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:52.180]  that. But until then, I would just say enjoy Burn v. Bodal and enjoy Raffles v. Wickelhaus and all
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:56.180]  the other things you're learning this year. The next couple of years are a lot more fun, we promise.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:59.460]  Hey, thank you. I really appreciate it.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.300]  Raymond, what's happening, man? How are you doing tonight?
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:07.380]  I just want to let you guys know I'm doing fantastic. Thank you, Rob, for having me.
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:12.020]  Hey, Raymond, real quick, actually, if you don't mind waiting, I did call Mike earlier,
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.900]  who's been waiting, and I think he missed his point in the queue.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.940]  Yeah, Mike, what's happening, man?
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:22.260]  My bad, man. I was in the garden watering my Rockwell cubes and everything like that.
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:25.780]  Never apologize for taking care of your own stuff.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:32.900]  Hey, so my business partner and I, we're just wondering if it's possible to put a patent on
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:39.460]  your SOPs in reference to possibly having multiple locations in reference to grows
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:42.660]  in the state of Arizona and in multiple states?
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:51.220]  So a patent on SOP would look like you're protecting the business method.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:58:00.660]  There was a big rise in business method patents during the tech boom, and there's also been a
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:05.860]  huge decline because case law has kind of made it really difficult to patent a business method.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:11.620]  It's definitely something that would be, you'd want to probably seek copyright protection,
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:16.580]  though I'll defer to Dave on that one. Have you done copyright protection for SOPs?
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:25.860]  I haven't. I've been trying as much as possible to try to squeeze SOPs into trade secret
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:34.500]  protection and encourage clients to redact what they submit to the state agencies and the local
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:43.300]  agencies. But when that fails, then yeah, copyright protection would be, I think, second best
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:53.780]  or the alternative because, again, I only know enough about patents to be dangerous, but
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.700]  my observation is exactly the same as Sheila's, which is
[01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:02.420]  it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to get a patent on a business method.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.060]  And then you're also disclosing your SOP, which is probably not what you want to do.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:07.380]  Right.
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:10.100]  Which that was my hesitance on the copyright side.
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:13.140]  What are your thoughts, Dave, about submitting it to the copyright office?
[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:21.940]  Well, there is a procedure for redacting trade secret material from a copyright submission.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:30.980]  There's a circular on that, and it can be done. So that would be the way to go on that to the
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:40.260]  extent that any of the SOPs do contain trade secrets. So there's that. And then, again, back
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:48.100]  to is there any way to make it, to mash it, or maybe not mash it's the right word, but to treat
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:55.620]  it, legitimately treat it as a trade secret. But those are the tools we got. We only have
[01:59:56.340 --> 02:00:02.180]  patents, trademark, copyrights, and trade secrets, domain names, kind of as a subset of trademarks.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:09.380]  But something, Sheila, I've been wanting to throw out there that we haven't talked about at all
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:18.740]  is on the patent side, it's one thing to obtain a patent, and there's a cost benefit analysis to
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:24.100]  obtaining a patent in each country, or in the United States, and then any other countries,
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:33.220]  as applicable. But we haven't talked about the cost of litigating a patent and enforcing a patent
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:39.700]  if somebody infringes your patent. Because as I don't know if everybody out there in the audience
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:45.460]  knows, the patent office does not enforce your patent for you if somebody rips you off. You've
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:50.900]  got to go to court to now enforce your patent. And that's got to figure into the cost benefit
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:58.660]  analysis too. And I haven't seen the American Intellectual Property Law Association estimates
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:04.820]  recently on the average cost of patent litigation, but the numbers are, the last time I looked a
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:12.100]  couple of years ago, the numbers were shocking. It's a lot. And by the way, I appreciate you guys
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:17.940]  answering that question. We had a person in the Future Canvas Project YouTube room named James
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:22.980]  Bean that was asking the same question about SOPs. So thanks for doing the twofer on that one.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:29.060]  Thanks for waiting, man. How are you? And you're going to be our last one of the night. So let's
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:34.660]  make it a great one. I will do my best, Rob. I will do my best. I'm going to go backwards
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.380]  chronologically through this conversation. I've got like four pages of notes here. First of all,
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:43.620]  as far as Mr. Wasserman said, there are a ton of horror stories. Sarah, good luck. And if you're
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:52.020]  passionate about it, godspeed. As far as the immediately subsequent conversation, like we
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:59.700]  tried to look at patenting SOPs based around HACCP modalities and found that because of the federally
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:05.300]  standardized framework, they fell under the prior art thing. So just from an operator's perspective,
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:11.860]  we did look at pursuing that and we're kind of rebuffed, quite frankly. I want to go back to
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:17.060]  one of the first things that was said while Dr. Mark was up on here about prior art and common
[02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:24.660]  practices in essential oil solvent extraction, basically, right? Be it mechanical, be it
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:35.620]  via CO2, ethanol, hydrocarbon. And my underlying question with that is, is that prior art going to
[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:41.860]  undermine some of these late to the game cannabis-specific patents? And then I do have a
[02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:47.860]  follow-up here, but I'd be curious if that is, is that really the overarching wisdom of the panelists?
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.300]  And by the way, thank you for putting on the room, Rob. Thank you for all the panelists' time,
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:59.640]  all the questions. It's been great. Yeah, I think that definitely, you know, because the standard
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:05.960]  for patentability is that it needs to be new and it also needs to be non-obvious over what's
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.400]  existing in the art already. And so if what is existing in the art are botanical extraction
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:17.640]  methods that, you know, are essentially the same, then it's obvious to try with another plant
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:25.240]  the same extraction method. So they will look at related industries or analogous industries to
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:30.360]  look for prior art. And so that's definitely something that I think should apply when you're
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:36.440]  talking about evaluating patentability of cannabis methods and processes.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.000]  Well, yeah, no, thank you for that. And Sheila, you also had a comment about
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.240]  phenotypic versus genotypic expression and lineage and how that tied into plant patents.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:55.480]  And I guess in all of my notes here, I have this, you know, note where is, in y'all's opinion,
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:02.040]  the confluence or the nexus of, you know, at its base simplicity, a three variable
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:09.720]  equation of intellectual property of genetics or plant diversity, intellectual property of
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:16.360]  extraction methodology that ties into, you know, how many CPGs can you pull out of that methodology
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.960]  and vis-a-vis output potential, which I think goes back to Sander's original point or one of
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:30.360]  his points about tokenization of cannabis output and what component IP plays in that tokenization,
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:34.840]  because you can have all the IP in the world, but if you don't have the infrastructure to output
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.080]  that product, what is that IP really worth? And I'd be curious where you guys think that
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:50.020]  nexus or confluence, you know, might emerge. Sander, do you want to take a stab at that one?
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:05:04.520]  Well, I mean, I'm not sure, right, other than to, you know, that my crystal ball is,
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:10.120]  I need to clean it. But I think that, I think the best observation, though, is to,
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:19.960]  is just to observe that it all ultimately comes down to enforcement, right? It all comes down to
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:31.400]  you have a right, but that right requires you, that just gives you the opportunity to spend more
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:41.400]  money trying to enforce it. So, and that's one of the biggest lessons or the biggest takeaways,
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:49.480]  right, is to just understand that, because as a business person, when you have limited resources,
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:58.600]  you have to figure out, you know, how to allocate those resources. And so the most,
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:06.200]  probably the most direct conversation you need to have with your intellectual property lawyer is,
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:13.320]  you know, what ultimately is this going to get me? And I don't personally think we have enough
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:18.120]  information yet to know kind of what is the best strategy. That's part of what, you know,
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:28.280]  keeps us all fully employed or partially employed as the case may be. But it's, you know, there's,
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:33.560]  there are different approaches and different strategies. And I think it's highly, highly
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:42.200]  specific to the client and the company, right? It goes on. A lot of companies couldn't care less,
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:49.160]  right? A lot of companies are, you know, they don't really put a lot of value on the IP.
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:55.640]  They think they're going to be able to always be able to grow and adapt. And so in that context,
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:02.200]  you know, you have one approach. There are other people who feel very, very specific as to
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.120]  the value of their IP, rightly or wrongly, and their willingness to spend the money.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:12.040]  And they're going to need a very tailored approach to how they go about protecting it.
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:16.120]  But that's, other than that, I don't think I can foresee the future.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:22.440]  Yeah, no, and listen, I wasn't expecting a, you know, finite answer. I guess I was just
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:26.040]  putting this out into the either as an operator who is looking at all this.
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:32.120]  I think, you know, one other thing to consider besides, you know, the value of a patent being
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:37.480]  at the ability to enforce it is there is value in the ability to license it. And maybe that
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:43.640]  generates another income or revenue stream in licensing your patent and collecting royalties
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:47.800]  on it. And one other thing that I would say, especially where you're uncertain as to what
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:51.960]  your competitors are doing, this goes back to the comment I made about trade secret,
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:56.600]  keeping your information trade secret. It's a different conversation that you're going to have
[02:07:56.600 --> 02:08:01.800]  with somebody who asserts a patent against you when you also have maybe a cross game or a patent
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.960]  that you can say you might want to take a look at my patent and see if you want to cross license
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:09.560]  and leave each other alone. So that's a lot of what you see. Well, you don't see Apple and
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:15.640]  Samsung leaving each other alone. But you see in those litigations, it's often a cross claim. So
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:20.440]  Apple is asserting their patents. Samsung is asserting their patents. And maybe that's it
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:26.600]  looks more like a negotiation than we're just going to roll over and have to pay lots of money.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.720]  So I think there are some people that I know that I've met in the industry who are obtaining
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:37.480]  patents not necessarily for the enforceability or even the licensing potential, but just to not
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:43.160]  be a sitting duck. And so I think there's definitely some benefit in that regard as well.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:51.000]  But Sheila, Sandra, remember back, I may be aging myself, but there used to be a lot of press about
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.440]  the patent trolls in the technology world. Have there been any people would think of as patent
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:07.080]  trolls in cannabis? And is that an area for concern or opportunity, depending on your perspective?
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:13.240]  Oh, I think 100% there are. I mean, I don't have any specific examples, but that's a real thing.
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:18.360]  And I don't see why cannabis would be any different, especially given that there's sort of
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:23.640]  this land grab with this no prior art. I can definitely see that there are trolls who are
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:27.880]  filing and getting these overly broad patents that they're either going to assert or they're
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:33.400]  going to sell so somebody else can assert it. Yes, Sandra, I can definitely attest to having
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.320]  seen one on a pitch event that we were an invited participant on.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:47.160]  And this is Dave speaking. A couple years ago, there was a packaging company that specialized in
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:53.720]  in, you know, kind of California compliant exit packaging that was making the circuit
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:03.400]  trying to extract deals and licenses from from different distributors and manufacturers
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:10.360]  on their patent. It went on for about six months or a year, and I haven't heard much about it lately.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.200]  But I think hearkening back to something that Sheila talked about earlier, we talked about earlier,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:26.840]  I suspect that if it doesn't get settled or maybe if it does get settled, the canopy
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:34.760]  lawsuit against GW may be the ghost of Christmas future in terms of cannabis trolling.
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:37.080]  I agree.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:45.320]  All right. I want to say, first of all, thank you to all of our panelists tonight. We have
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:51.960]  Dave Brantman from Brantman Mayfield in Salina Beach, California. We have Sander Zagzebski
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:59.480]  from Clark Hill. We have Sheila Gibson from Aura. And we have Mark Wasserman from Pop Brothers at
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:03.720]  Law. So if you need a great trademark and copyright person, Dave Brantman's your guy.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:06.920]  If you need a great and obviously everyone does more than just what I'm mentioning.
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:12.920]  Sander is a terrific mergers and acquisition and corporate attorney. So if you need some heavy
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:22.040]  hitters, Sander is your guy. On the intellectual property and patent side, Sheila Gibson's
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.720]  terrific, obviously. And if you're in trouble and you need to learn to shut the fuck up,
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.280]  then Mark Wasserman is absolutely the person you should be turning to.
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:36.840]  So thank you to all the panelists. Before I let everyone go tonight, a little bit of just
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.440]  upcoming, we do have a few more things inside the Ask Me Anything About Cannabis Club coming up.
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:46.760]  Next Sunday night for our weekly, you know, let's dig into an issue subject. It's a little
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:52.120]  lighthearted by comparison this week. We'll be doing some of the glass manufacturers and the
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:55.400]  people that really started the accessories industry and gave us some of the greatest
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:00.520]  glass we have out there today. So Dave Daly from Grav will be helping me moderate that room and
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:04.280]  bringing some buddies of his. So it'll be a really fun one and not nearly as techie as the last
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:09.160]  couple we've done. And then there's some other ones that are coming up as well that other like
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:14.360]  co-hosts or other administrators are doing as well. So look out for the stuff that Sam is doing
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:19.720]  through Blunt Talks. And we have some other talks. Matt Carnes from Greenwave Advisors is coming in
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:24.360]  to do a earnings. You know, a lot of the bigger publicly traded companies are reporting earnings
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:30.840]  this week. So Matt, who is an analyst, will be coming in to discuss that. So to everyone that's
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:35.320]  been following this club, and I'm starting to see a lot of the same names and faces week after week.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:39.960]  So it's very, you know, flattering and definitely very humbling that you guys are back every week.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:43.480]  I want to say thank you to all of you out there. And again, thank you so much to our panelists
[02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:48.600]  tonight for just such an engaging conversation. Thanks, Rhonda.
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:58.760]  All right. We'll see you next Sunday for Ask Me Anything About Cannabis.
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:01.960]  Take care. Have a great night. Over and out. You too. Bye.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:18.620]  All right. Thank you, YouTube. I, uh, while you guys were all listening, we cooked dinner. We had the smoke detector go off. Gemma took her pants off.
[02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:28.620]  About to watch some, we had a little dance party. And anywho. Yeah, next Sunday night should be fun with the glass stuff.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:38.460]  But, uh, all right. Yeah. Save the economy, grow cannabis. I agree.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:55.820]  All right. I'm gonna go watch some Moana or some other kid appropriate movie.
