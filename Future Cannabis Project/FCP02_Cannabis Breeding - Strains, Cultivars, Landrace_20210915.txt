recording set up that I can get this what's up we have a clubhouse
conversa- clubhouse conversation although I don't hear it right now so
now it's back to me supposed to technically start at and again just hold
on a minute dr. Anubis how are you today it was lovely seeing you in the show
earlier today and everybody else that was available to make it I was great
seeing you all so I'm like listening to them in my ear but base what he's saying
earlier today actually I'm bummed because they had Aladin or Aladin Khalifa
from Khalifa genetics speaking who's one of the breeders we have on Dagadat
love and but I tuned in like at the very end so and now people are just hi I love
how I've been like talking this whole time and I totally didn't have the
microphone on at all I've been like literally talking since Anubis dr.
Anubis pause the previous time so that's awesome but that's great dr.
Anubis I was super good to see you I'm really excited to have everybody here
today it'll be very very fun we have about a minute left before we get
started so do we have anything exciting news anything abruptly fun or yeah this
is the housekeeping sorry we'll let you guys listen to the exciting housekeeping
and this topic I didn't do land races but strains and cold spars does come up
later in the week awesome so we got lots of cross relevance and and lots of fun
conversation to be had about that and I think we're going to jump into that
really quick quickly it is five o'clock and we have a very exciting episode here
on the Dankauer so we are rolling and recording my beautiful wife there is in
the audience taking care of the recording section of this and I look
forward to having today's conversation of course it will be a great one because
we have an amazing panels of speaker from all over North America as well as
exciting guests and a lot of fun and interesting things going on so without
any further ado it's the Dankauer guys and we are here to get entertained
educated and stimulated while we get get deep dive talk to some experts about
horticulture of cannabis now we have everything from doctors in a PhD doctors
with PhDs in cannabis genetics to legs from the old days so I'm really excited
to have a conversation about this because I'm sure there's a lot of
passion and a lot of conversation to be had there again I'm lending your
moderator this usually goes we spend about an hour to an hour and a half
discussing a few subjects pertaining to a specific area we often open the room
up afterwards for so after the show to talk with the leading experts about
areas of their field and we invite everybody up on stage to come up have a
conversation and go this portion of the show however is recorded and can be seen
again on our YouTube that you can click on and check out on my page so you can
click on me and check out my Instagram and that will guide you to our page
where you can find our newsletter and get in touch of all sorts of fun stuff
so don't be afraid to check that out and hop in there well without any further
ado let's get started and talk with our amazing moderators and conversation
starters and speakers that we have today we're gonna follow PTR and have
everybody introduce themselves before we get the conversation started as we
usually do so Ashley Josh Damon Jameson Peter dr.
anabas and Corey in that order so Ashley go ahead and get us hey guys my name is
Ashley Hubbard I am the director of cultivation here in Michigan I've been
in the industry about seven years going on eight I worked with Anna in the same
genetics lab in college got my master's in plant genetics population genetics
excuse me and now running a fully aeroponic facility learning a lot every
day enjoy that I get to do what I do so excited for the topic hey everyone I'm
Josh Burke I've grown up in a legacy community and I've grown for at least 15
years I also worked in the industry for several years in research and
development the main focus there was working on a molecular breeding project
working towards mapping the cannabis genome to identify various trait markers
for future breeding projects currently I'm more focused on doing phenotyping
and trait tracking and curating specific cultivars as medical qualities mainly
focused on pediatrics appreciate the opportunity to be here to learn and
share thanks everyone oh shit it's my turn I really don't like doing this sort
of thing but I'm Damon most of you know me yeah not very many people in the
comments but yeah I'm Damon I guess I've been growing for quite some time I was
one of the first medically authorized people that's me
London you need to write bios for us and then you can introduce us I think
Damon you're too funny man my name is Jamison Walborn I run a fully licensed
genetics company here in Canada we cater to cultivators looking to secure unique
terpene profiles or high THC cultivars for the market and really excited to be
here with you guys and learn if you're available Peter I would love you to say
I was looking for the I was trying to get the unmute I'm Peter future cannabis
project I'm mostly here to lurk in the background we're broadcasting live to
YouTube right now so if you guys actually the speakers go to youtube.com
slash FCP 0 2 and then pop out the chat you can kind of see all the chatting and
the questions and the occasional heckling from the rowdy crowd but anyway
I'm also cooking dinner for my or two of my three kids one's a baby but uh so I
will bow out and mute myself. Awesome hey everybody I am Anna Schwabe Dr.
Anibus is what they call me here which is just fine with me because it's pretty
funny I do have a PhD in well it's plant genetics population genetics to
be specific and my PhD work focused on variation in cannabis with a genetic
background and since then I have done lots of things I've taught modern
cannabis science at CU Boulder now for this is my fifth semester I recently
moved to New Jersey to work for an aquaponics company that is currently
growing hemp and will shortly be moving into the high THC market when they start
issuing licenses and yeah and then this week I'm doing a takeover at a
conference next week I'm doing all kinds of stuff and I'm just pretty excited to
be here to talk about strains and cultivars and land rights.
Good evening my name is Warren I'm a principal managing partner of Resonate Cannabis Incorporated.
I'm also live streaming on YouTube and Twitch happy to have the dank hour
coming through on resonate radio it's a pleasure to see a bunch of familiar
faces up here as always I look forward to the discussion it's good to see
everybody hello awesome I'm your moderator conversation here at the dank hour get
growing together where we talk about cannabis now I want to just hop in and
get right started I'm gonna throw Anna to the wolves all right I'm gonna I'm
gonna get started strain or cultivar what's the lingo what is it let us have
the lowdown and I know and I love standing on this pillar so I'm gonna
get her started with the conversation there's a doctor and it was go ahead
Oh mylanta okay so let's see strains and cultivars so recently there has been
this push to stop calling different types of cannabis strains and I believe
that it came from a publication that came out and said that strain is not a
botanically recognized term that's not exactly what the paper said but
basically that's what people interpret it as and it's not true it is a
botanical term and it is accepted but what it doesn't have is a formal
taxonomic rank so taxonomy is a system of naming and in a hierarchical
fashion you know we've got at the highest level we've got genus and
species and then we can also have varieties or subspecies or cultivars
strains is not part of that formal taxonomical ranking or naming system
which is fine with cannabis because to be a cultivar I mean strains and
cultivars are conceptually equivalent they're you know crosses of two
parental lines to create something new in botany the term strain refers to
variations found within plant cultivars which is what we have in different
strains of cannabis and the definition that I always pull out is that a strain
is the designated from a modified plant produced by conventional breeding or by
biotechnological means or which result from genetic mutation so it's not
produced by biotechnological means it's not really a result of genetic mutations
but it is produced by conventional breeding and it is modified because it's
under artificial selection we put we do pheno hunting right so we are
artificially selecting for the traits that we like and then that is a strain
it's not yet a cultivar many cultivators prefer the term cultivar
even though technically most cannabis doesn't I'm asking meet the request meet
the requirements to be formally recognized as a cultivar so we can use
the term strain and it's not incorrect it's just not a it's not a formal rank
and just because you name something doesn't cultivar strain what was that
eggs as exactly that was the point I was getting at or so I think you sure you
dropped out there and came back and really quickly I'm having a little bit
of a leg out right now maybe a little bit there with us but awesome I am so
did you have more on that yeah just super quickly like the majority of
cannabis things that are out there are polyhybrid crosses we don't really know
what the what the ancestral line is or the parentage is they're unstable often
as far as the genetic lineage goes they haven't gone through the International
Code of Nomenclature for cultivated plants which is how you actually get
formally recognized your cultivars and yeah so you can kind of think of strain
as like a stepping stone on the way to cultivar but there's more hoops to jump
through to actually get to cultivar distinction or designation and I
complete awesome thank you for the awesome summary they're really a
preacher so moving forward looking at like strains and land races specifically
was a conversation that we had the joy of having today with Khalifa genetics
shout out to Aladdin from Khalifa genetics we did a 12 o'clock show and it
was awesome that will be coming up on YouTube and everything like that as well
so don't miss out on that so we're talking ancestral cannabis so it really
has is one of the longest cultivated plants there's not really like is there
a while do we have a good example a present example of a wild cannabis
strain no okay so that's I mean definitely an interesting point to look
at and when we talk about land races and stuff like so really land races are
cultivars or strains that have been cultivated over time and would be what
we would consider like a group of people have found and decided to you know
continue to breed for those traits the would those be considered the so are you
asking about what a cultivar is or what a land race is supposed to be because a
land race is something that has escaped cultivation so it goes feral but then it
becomes locally adapted to the area that it's in but not necessarily evolved
to where it's like genetically distinct from everything else it's just locally
adapted so with cannabis we have a bunch of phenotypic plasticity so it's just
locally adapting to its area and it can become like physically like
phenotypically distinct from you know cannabis that's in other places in the
world so that's pretty much all the land race is but I wasn't there to hear
what the definition that was given today was oh or it's won't bother with that
but we'll switch it over and I'm gonna jump over to Jameson I mean let's forget
about strain cultivar let's talk about breeding and genetics like what do you
look for and I've asked you this question before but we've got a lot of
us people in the audience in a great group so what do you look for in a
genetic in a specific strain or plant and and tell us a little bit about your
process of pheno hunting and maybe define start with the definition of that
a little bit because I think it's a sure so to clarify I don't I don't do a lot
of breeding I mean I did a bit of pollen chucking back in the day but you know
all of my time is taken up looking through other people's work and I think
that you know when you're pheno hunting dependent on how big a room you have
and and you know your ultimate goal is working backwards from that and so if
you're dealing with a smaller size and you know you're focused on looking for
something say you know that mechanically separates well for half you know you're
really looking for a gland structure and you know focusing on the right breeder
the right lineage and using the knowledge that the community has you
know you can really narrow down what seeds you want to be popping and you
know optimize every square foot of that phenol hunt room so you know
unfortunately in the Canadian market the THC is king so if I can find something
that will test above 28% THC and yields better than 44 grams a square foot I
put like you know I can pretty much take that to the market and then find some
some partners that you know I know are going to be interested in that and then
the challenge in my specific world is comes when you know you don't want to
let that out too much and you're only giving it to specific people and then
you need to go continually go back to the drawing board and find unique
profiles for others so they you know they can stand out in the market in
their own right so I think really understanding what you're looking for
and then working back from there my job is a lot easier than you know amazing
breeders and other fetal hunters behind me because the market is just demanding
a single thing which is THC so they'll be interesting turf profiles that I will
let go because I get COAs back and understand that you know this one though
a little bit less attractive on that turf profile is a higher THC so it's
it's not the way I would select for my personal medicine but you know I'm
selecting for a certain first goal in the market and you know I think that
that's how everybody needs to approach their female hunters you know some
people say I'm looking for something that's resistant to pests or mold and
and some people are saying I'm looking for something that's the absolute
tastiest and I don't care about yield or you know some guys are going I need
something that'll work commercially for me the numbers got to make sense so it
really comes down to you know what your goals are and then working back from
there and you know learning from your mistakes is probably the biggest thing
that the biggest takeaway that I've had I think yeah I love that platform but I
just I thought it was a great stepping stone because we kind of do this you
kind of think about the same processes when you're jumping into breeding right
like you're gonna you're gonna plant your seeds and you're gonna select the
best plant for what your outcome wants to be right like if you're going to grow
if you're gonna plant and and you want to go for high THC you're going to
select plants that have high THC and breed with those plants and same thing
happens when you're looking for a strain or phenol hunting is you're gonna
plant as much as the seeds and find the one that's the best that you're looking
for and keep that one individually so you do the same kind of thing when
you're hunting for like a breeding mother now I mean Josh I'd love to chat
a little bit like about what you would kind of do in the process of searching
for a good breeding plant or strong genetic I know you you're currently in
the process of selecting specific some specific genetics or strains to use in
breeding now Josh could you tell me a little bit about some of the things that
you might look for in a yeah so for myself currently I'm working on stuff
for the medical community so terpenes and the fact are more paramount than
just about any other trait but that said I'm like Jamison had mentioned
you're always working backwards so you need to find a you know a cultivar that
phenotype it's going to you know be able to check off the boxes that are needed
for your yield and your THC or CBD or CBG depending on what you're working for
but those terpenes definitely play a huge role and how you know that plant is
accepted by the the patient or the user so I think it's really important with
breeding to focus on like again like Jamison said the end goal like I said
for myself I'm working towards different profiles that work for different medical
benefits so you know for children a lot of time something that's a little
fruitier in taste but still maintains you know a one-to-one in the THC to CBD
can be very you know palatable and beneficial you know whereas stuff that's
you know something for myself you know like I like something a little gassier
it's not going to be some a profile that would be as useful flavor-wise but yeah
you can definitely find different traits that work for the the common goal but
when I'm breeding personally I'm finding plants that have you know good structure
along with that terpene profile you know both male and female you're one to
find things that work kind of in a similar fashion but you know maintain
those traits that you're looking for as the breeding goals. Thanks.
Awesome Josh like that was a really really key response now I'm gonna just
take a moment RJ hopped up on stage here and and he is has an opportunity
to introduce himself real quick and say hello to everybody so RJ say
hello to the world out there as we are we are also being semi-casted on to the
future cannabis project. So hello to the world I'm RJ Ellis I am an extraction and
process specialist with Canada's leading third-party extraction company I focus
on co2 ethanol and hydrocarbon extraction and then isolations and
refinements as well super happy to be here I just want to say much love to
everyone and I'm stoked for this conversation sorry for showing up late.
It is all good there RJ we appreciate you joining us you have a safe drive
home and we look forward to involving you in this conversation further now I
wanted to jump down to Damon really quick there now I know you're one of
those guys that has like a really cool library is there like are there some
tricks or things to do because we're always looking for plants that you like
plants that we want to keep as a mother but as a home grower even a smaller
cultivator it can be a little bit difficult to like you know have a plant
that's on the side of the mother plant especially doing a pheno hunt can be
even more challenging do you have any suggestions or tricks of the trade that
might help somebody in a smaller space hold a mother or even like be able to
hunt and bring that plant back? Yeah you're gonna want to keep a stable
environment and then just pretty much you can perpetually clone for some
strains it's about nine years and then you start having dead problems you know
they just become unstable and they want to flower and seed themselves keeping
mother stock you know like for myself personally I have specific genetics that
really work well with pain and in that regard like if it's a really good plant
yeah I'll keep them on but like what I'm just going through things and I've got
so many seeds to go through I just crack them off right and you know I might have
missed out on that one unicorn but I still have so many more seeds to go
through just that I've amassed throughout the years right.
Jameson hit it on the head as far as like what you're supposed to do and how
you're supposed to do it and you know it was Josh, Josh is very well versed in
breeding so like even his insight is great too. I used to be against poly poly
poly poly hybrids but I'm starting to see kind of the value in working with
those plants like so if you use like pure landrace your variation off your
F1 is gonna be really small. I've worked with guys that you know they've gotten
stability right off that F1 line now mind you this was 20 years ago before
all the poly poly poly poly hybrids came around right so it's kind of doing that
now it's really hard and tissue culture is great too like I don't know why a
lot of the bigger companies just don't do a perpetual rotation and then just
rely on their tissue culture bank that's there right because that's another way
to speed things up but for somebody like me when tissue culture came into the mix
I looked at it and I was like well are those plants in my fridge gonna go
against my plant count right and so I just kind of avoided that like what the
general rule of thumb was taproot in soil but you know with tissue culture
you have all those roots and it is in a meter it was taproot in a medium so a
tissue culture it's in the medium and I just looked at it and I was like yeah
I'll steer clear of that and continue with the perpetual rotation and just
getting seeds right varieties the spice of life and that's me
awesome great answer there now I thought it'd be great to jump over to
dr. Anubis like so we so we find a mother or we find a good breeding pair
you know like we find an amazing male and amazing female we take all this time
in hunting them together and we pair them with seeds and we make the mate
right and we save these plants in a vegetative stage separately right how
long and how many years could these plants be pretty I mean we talked about
nine years I would love to know like if the environment is being kept clean how
much of that how long can that actually last is there documented like what's the
longest time I've heard of people saying that there's been plants that have
lasted 20 years I don't know if I have 100% believed in this but my
understanding is you could also do tissue culture and clean them up quite a
bit I mean this would allow you to bring the plant back to a healthy state after
it's built up a lot of bacteria and stuff like that but even so I just love
your opinion on that yes so I have also heard stories and you know firsthand
stories of people that have had plants and veg for 19 or 20 years again I don't
know how accurate that is or you know people are kind of embellishing their
stories a little bit but it's really it's um it depends it's not like it
there's there's no rule of thumb it depends on the plant it's it's an
individual type basis some plants you can only clone you know a few times and
they just tank after that some mothers you can take you know clones off of them
for years I think it just depends on the mother and and also probably depending
on how much you cut every time if you're just chopping away at her I would
think that that would be extremely stressful and she won't last that long
but if you're if you're you know being responsible and not hacking away at her
you could potentially keep her in veg for a very long time if she has that
stamina to stay and not go not go off and and and the changes that people see
when when when they do see that you know there it's no longer honestly no
longer clonable I can't remember the word I was gonna say but uh it's because
of stress it's epigenetic changes and things like that is my theory I don't
have anything to back that up my data is sitting in my lab in Colorado still yet
to be analyzed but um yeah that's what I think and and I yeah it's just on an
individual basis you can't tell how long something's gonna last and it could
be years it might just be you know three clones and you're done I have noticed
that some cultivars could be a lot more challenging to clone and than others it
comes some can root up a lot faster so it's probably like it's definitely
there's gonna be a case-by-case base I want to jump over to Ashley now we're
kind of talking about breeding and selecting plants now you have you do a
large ceiling I imagine you plant lots of seeds what's your kind of thoughts on
the whole feminized and and photo photo period sorry feminized and non feminized
genetics like what's your thoughts on use it on breeding those as well as
using those as for pheno hunts and use them for do you find yourself leaning
always towards regular seeds that have two sex or do you find yourself leaning
towards feminized so we actually do both but we send all of our tissue out to be
analyzed for sex testing we also have teamed up with another lab called I care
of science to also dive into different genetic markers to like help us get
through ones that might have like a higher hermaphrodite propensity they did
a lot of CBD breeding but found that they could locate some of these strains
that they were given from seed they planted a bunch of outdoor seeds and
then found out what that you know they were I'm air quoting right now feminized
but they a bunch of them were males and so they dove into it so we we will pop
both but we will always rely on you know sex testing as well as if you know if
we're really curious about keeping something else we'll do further genetic
testing on it but for us we're kind of limited on really just space you know
each one of those mothers requires their own space so we did a very large pheno
hunt of over 50 different strains while we were currently growing you know our
18 that we've got and it was just you know you definitely have to fit it into
what you're able to do kind of like Jameson said with selecting them based on
size but not overdoing it all at once I know it's really exciting to pop
everything that you've got but to really take care of that mother and give
them the time that they need you know they're gonna take up they're gonna take
up your bedroom space while you're waiting for the final product so that
can be a big chunk of time so I will never pop that many seeds again it was
just a lot of record-keeping we try to take really good notes both on kind of
subjective and objective so THC results and all that and then we'll kind of give
it out to all of our crew everybody tries it I give them homework so you
know rate on a scale how you liked this and then we use everybody's data to kind
of make make our decisions on what we keep but we'll do both feminized and
regular but I haven't quite honestly seen a big variability in the quality
feminized versus regular but we will pop both at a very small amount now I'm
trying to always make sure we've got new genetics coming down the line just so
we're always having you know the best strains that we can grow with with our
facility but yeah if you know hunting is a lot of fun and just it's gonna take up
a lot of space if you're trying to do it well make sure you're record-keeping
you're never gonna have too many notes you're never gonna look at your your
notes and be like man I wasted so much time writing all this down so think
about what's really important to you watch that plant through its whole cycle
even give them a couple rounds just to make sure that you're really getting a
good end result and not just doing it based off of one cycle so again you know
just make sure you've got the space to do it because that mom's gonna take time
you know she's gonna be in your facility for a while until you can
really even let it fully finish so keep that in mind when you're popping a bunch
of seeds I love that comment Ashley that was such gold you got it like that was
an amazing point to make is that and I wanted to touch on that and unfortunately
Matt is not able to join us but he would say as he would it take it could take
like to really fine-tune and hone a genetic to like really perfection it not
even perfection because you can strive for that your entire life and never
reach it I won't ever reach it but to get it to its like best potential you
can it could take six seven runs even people that have been growing their
entire life take a few runs to get a genetic and get it really down and that
is an amazing point because you don't want to miss out on one of those plants
just because you grew it wrong you know there's there's a lot of potential
that's out there and especially when you then use it for breeding or for other
projects well it's very important so Cory I want to kind of pop down and you
throw the same kind of Ashley did you want to say something I was just saying
I'm saying that from experience I've gotten rid of a couple of phenos and I
was like fuck I shouldn't have got rid of that you know second third round
killed the mom and then realized oh wait that's one of the ones we should have
kept so definitely take your time with making sure you like it multiple multiple
yeah awesome so Cory just did a pheno hunt I think he's actually that that
might actually be the phenol that he is doing with this project out in Portugal
if you're available I would love you to chat a little bit about that and tell us
about kind of how that went for you and and what you look for and yeah I mean I
don't know how much more I can add already here I think majority of it's
been said but I mean one of the I think the most interesting things for me kind
of moving with this phenol hunt is I didn't realize that the location was the
same as California as far as latitude is concerned so you know having that
familiarity and kind of seeing those expressions you know back from my
foundation years I think was really helpful but you know again it's just
making sure that you can get through your seasons and you know kind of also
clearly defining what your you know objectives are especially when you're
coming from the large-scale you know commercial market you might be looking
you know Jameson was kind of mentioning it earlier there's it's definitely
specific cultivars or strains for each purpose I think it's really important to
take the time to understand that and really you know make that connection
with your plant and see what's gonna go on with it and take those runs I think
you know that was the one thing I was really good at but that's the the best
piece of advice ever is don't be afraid to run it several times there's no sense
in rushing it I really do believe in taking the time and that's what I've
really been focused on here and explaining no to this current project
that I'm on in Portugal there is really just you know let's take this time and
do it now you know there's you know origin it's coming in and they're like
oh let's pop these new ones let's do this let's do that and it's like hold on
you know one step at a time we have no over 30 plants that are sitting here
these are 30 individual expressions that we could be seeing out here let's make
sure we take the time and just put in the effort for it because now you know
that's the time when it's gonna pay off so it yeah that's I mean I know it's
very overarching but I think all the points that have been said in here have
already kind of nailed at home I think the long and the short of it is really
take your time and don't be afraid to do a few more runs you know for those of us
again who are in those large-scale positions you know really do not give up
your conviction to convince those you know people that make those big
decisions to take more time if you need to I think that's kind of the gem that I
want to pass on to anyone who's listening is you know do not feel ashamed
that you're asking for more time I think it's a really smart thing to do and it's
gonna make the entire operation better in the long run and I'm complete
awesome and I appreciate your great words of course so wanted to jump over
and kind of ask this we're talking a little bit about regular feminized I
mean we haven't really touched on autoflour today but I really wanted to
jump into kind of that regular feminized area and
all right there are people that hunt for genetics that look pretty on camera for
for various tasks there it just is what is I I personally pick plants that look
beautiful and I tried to keep them around on a regular basis I find that
the prettier they look better they smoke but that's just me and every person is
different so whatever that reason is I mean if you cook for cannabis if you're
if you're I think that that would be an area that needs to be explored more is
like cooking and finding flavors for cooking in that area as well I want to
jump over to dr. anabas now there's a lot of controversy and a lot of fight
between you know regular feminized seeds so what get so I mean we know the
differences but what makes a feminized seed a feminized seed and we were
talking about also sorry can you just start with kind of like feminized seeds
and what can go wrong if you're not properly hunting the plant and making
sure that it's it's it's drained correctly because in my understanding if
you hunt the right plant and make sure it's stress tested for genetic viability
and then you you know use chemical reversing like STS spray or colloidal
silver and use one of these two methods if you have a strong genetic plant that
isn't prone to hermaphrodism whatsoever and you've tested it the only way you
know that the seeds produced from that plant should produce a hermaphrodite at
a very very low tendency is if a there is hermaphroditic tendencies previous on
in the genetic that weren't noticeable on that line or because you didn't hunt
and clean up the genetic properly so is that true like how does that work
exactly and it can you like are all feminized seeds just like good or bad or
what are they so all all females the thought is is that all females have have
the attendance they have the propensity they have the ability to produce pollen
structures at what point they do this differs from plant to plant it's the
reason they do this is because the whole point of existence is to pass your genes
on to the next generation so really female plants all they want to do is
make a seed if they go through their life and through their life and they
don't get pollinated it's towards the end when they feel like the end is near
they're gonna kind of freak out and go oh my god I'm not going to be able to
reproduce and and and they will throw out some pollen structures they call them
manners bananas manners to pollinate itself make a seed so that it has
another chance next growth season to then potentially you know work
reproduce and so the point at which a plant perceives that that threat of
dying without being able to reproduce it's different for each plant some
plants you know there's a light leak or something it's like oh my god end of the
world is nigh and it will throw up some some pollen structures and it will seed
itself some plants will sit tight and sit tight and sit tight and really will
not do that until you know the last like it really is just getting too old
and it knows it's not gonna make it all it'll make a seed or two so the thought
is is that you want to try and stress the plant out you want to mess with the
light or mess with the heat or mess with the water make it think that it's dying
to see if it's going to stress if it stresses under really light conditions
that's probably not a good plant to produce feminized seed from if you push
it and push it and push it and it doesn't do that and the only way you can
get it to make a pollen structure is to do to chemically induce it that is
potentially a good plant to create some nice feed from um unfortunately there's
a lot of people around that are like oh cool seed and are growing them and now
there's a whole big mess out there but yeah I mean the best the best way to do
it is to do a stress test on a plant that you want to create some nice seed
from do the chemical process which is just it's a hormone hormone interruption
and it tricks the plant into making a male structure basically what's not male
it's still female but making those pollen structures and yeah that's how
you get them a nice seed it's basically you know fertilizing itself but not
under stressful conditions you've created the conditions to make that
happen and if anybody else wants to chime in here that's done any breeding
I happy to learn more about that that's what I understand
that's my understanding as well I might have said is that there's no true there's
no true female there's only shades of hermaphrodism like there are all plants
have the ability to go her map yeah so I was gonna say it's really important to
also remember that sex a determination is not just the sex chromosomes there's
other things that are important in in sex expression just like in people you
can have somebody who is genetically a female or genetically a male but it is
by all outward appearances is a female and sometimes what Ashley was saying
when they popped a bunch of them unquote feminized ease and a bunch of them were
male they could have had you know that hermaphroditic tendency on any one of
the other chromosomes that have that contribute or anyone on any one of the
other genes that contributes to sex expression it's not necessarily it
doesn't necessarily have to do with the presence or absence of a Y chromosome so
people have a tendency to forget that sex expression is a whole mishmash of
different things that lead that just a little introspective point I love
pointing this out when I have the opportunity is it's crazy how cannabis
has X&Y chromosomes and that's kind of like the definition of male and female
and that is exactly amplifies like human genetics I just think that's a
interesting point of introspective and how things are so well connected and as
so much further along so without being to to going too far down that rabbit hole
Damon I'd love to know like what are you looking through right now is there
breeder or a seed pack that you're really excited in checking out or going
through it what is that beautiful plant you have in your that's a gelato 33 and
it's outside and it looked like trash
bull looking plant responding well it's probably in about week three a flower
will it make it maybe right I really like my outdoor stuff I just put to look
at and it's pretty in the garden generally I take like from at least
August and September off from anything and I just kind of like have a vacation
but right now what I'm hunting through what I will say is you know how Jameson
said you have to be very selective as to who you give your shit to because you
never know so you somebody you might end up pissing somebody off and then they
give it to somebody and then they give it to somebody so yeah you have to be
really selective with who's getting your gear the other thing that I want to
mention is you have to be really selective those to whose gear you're
taking right when legalization happened there was a lot of guys just handing
things out and there is a huge spider mite outbreak because you know out of a
hundred of them 90 of them had no idea that they were dealing with mites right
so then all of a sudden everybody's got mites which was kind of funny and then
yeah just bag seed genetics that guys think are gold and you know that little
moment of instability it starts shooting answers and then you've got hermaphroditic
seeds so stuff like that thanks London no problem David I appreciate it so
Jameson like I mean if you had like other than what you're going through
right now is there something that you would be excited to open a pack of like
I'm essentially gonna go through the the moderators who kind of go into this
question it's like what are you excited about planting what are you what would
you like to have in your I'm doing a big banana runs hunt right now that's
something that I've been like I've know a couple guys who you know been lucky
enough to give me some really nice hash and that turf profile of that artificial
banana that soul fire was able to capture I think is really neat and so
you know that that's something that excites me personally always looking
through you know there's a lot of lime that I'm looking through right now sort
of lime gas combos run variations I have yet to find something a runs cross that
is smokes better than runs but I'm continuing to look and what else am I
really excited about I'm gonna do a big one marilla sift from Brandon rust I was
lucky enough to grab ten packs off that original drop so I'm gonna take my time
with those I think that there's some stuff there and then the coffee stuff is
some stuff that I'm really interested in looking through as well as some of the
Royal crosses but I got to stop talking because I give out all my secrets like
Damon said can I re-answer I you know what I really really really really want
to grow old-school critical like the the original like 12-foot critical I
miss that so much and like actual Durban poison not something that's been self
themselves and themselves but actual Durban poison those are the two I really
want to grow I mean like some of these do next you think they're even plausible
to find anymore or you got a real I know you got a rebuild them I mean there's
people there's guys in their basements who don't come on any chats and you know
are just stewards of the plant and you know there's you know a lot of small
towns and a lot of guys out there who you know this this plant is impacted so
I think that there's some crazy stuff you know still waiting in the wings and
you know it's interesting talking to the guys in charge of genetics at at
these larger cultivators and you know they get sort of the influence flavor of
the day you know heavily influenced out of California and then you know Romulan
and and and critical and things that like you you know are like somebody at
that company's reminiscing from childhood about some you know
intoxicating experience they had so I think that that's really interesting so
you know looking backwards and forwards is definitely something smart to do in
this market great great answer Ashley what are you most excited about hunting
through right now it sounds like you're working on a couple things anything you
willing to share it look yeah so we've got a probably ten different seed packs
we're waiting to pop because I'm only doing a handful at a time I learned that
lesson but we've had a lot of good luck with peanut butter brass so we actually
and that's a Michigan breeder fresh coast seeds and they we had great
success with this peanut butter definitely one of our top sellers so we
actually got a pack of white truffle from them that we just popped we also
just popped some rainbow rosé that we're getting ready to flower right now
so I am looking forward to those two but we do have a whole list of seeds that we
want to pop we're actually getting rid of probably five of our strains to bring
on five new ones see what see what we can select out of those but I'm only
doing probably two or three at a time just for my space issues but those are
the two I'm most excited about for sure will you save those ones that you move
out of rotation for a bit just in case you want to bring them back like is that
something that you'll do or will you kind of just like you're just done
they're not they're not performing like they used to it's time to move on
definitely a couple not performing one of them we just got our first round of
tests out and it was like 12% so I know people aren't really gonna buy that but
I'm really looking into diving into tissue culture to keep any of the ones
that we maybe want to bring back on haven't dove into that but looking
forward to that so we can kind of keep that genetic library should we want to
bring her out again that rainbow rosé sounds super interesting I know yeah
you know Fletcher's doing doubling down on the on the on the rainbow so I think
that's that's pretty cool I'd love to see that yeah she's in flower right now
we just kicked her in the flower last week so I'll keep updated pictures and
sharing with you guys I'll be happy to see that roll I mean I'm super excited
that one Josh you're up next brother and just a heads up after we're done this
around I am going to open up the floor to any questions you guys might have for
our speakers today I know we're focusing more on breeding cannabis but I
think we end up more having a strain and preference conversation so that's not a
big deal if you want to come up go ahead and raise your hand now but do be do have
a heads up we are recording and we'll record this episode until about a quarter
after ish maybe a little bit earlier but you're welcome to come up and ask
questions if you'd like Josh you're up next what are you excited about I know
you're running into fun stuff from Manny but tell us a little bit about what's
going on in your garden yeah so currently I am just doing a flavor run
I've got 19 different strains running my organic living soil pots I've got
flavors from mangoes to apples to a bunch of different gas and earth but
yeah as far as stuff that I'm excited to pop I have two different CBG lines that
I'm gonna be hunting through and looking for stuff to cross together to
work on just kind of bringing out that CBG with medical stuff it's you know in
the legal system it's difficult because everything is so data-driven on my
personal side it's a lot nicer because you know the data gets to be you know
half of the equation you get to you know use the data to you know build a select
you know 20 or 30 plants to look at but then you still have to go through and
you know find the ones that actually work for what you're trying to do you
know in the medical side you know we can actually go and give patients you know
different samples so they can try them and say okay you know this one works
this one doesn't you know and be able to you know kind of tailor things to people
more specifically yeah that's all sorts of flavor is great but yeah the
efficacy is also a really important factor but yeah I'm complete thanks
thank you Josh awesome and always great to hear I love hearing about the flavors
and what you guys got going on what you have going on in your garden we always
have a little chat after a production meet it's always a good time
dr. Anubis now I know you have just moved so you probably don't have as much
growing at home is there anything you're excited about what are you
excited um well so I have my son's growing cannabis at my Colorado house
and I have no idea what's going on with that I don't think he's really had time
to look after what's going on but we have some a toast genetics which a bunch
of them turned out to be male so but they weren't feminized but whatever but
definitely more than a 5050 and it was last season too but here I have we are
growing and we have a wine theme going on and it's there there CBD varieties we
have merlot and chardonnay which are growing right now and they're finally
they're finally growing and they're starting to flower which is awesome and
one of them is they kind of got mixed up and they're sort of intermixed I don't
know how we're gonna deal with this but one of them is really variegated which
is super interesting and I was just gonna say like my motivation for growing
is probably different or what kind they want to grow is way different than
everybody else's you know everyone's looking for chirping profiles and you
know THC or CBD levels whatever I want to grow the freaks I want to grow the
freaks and I want to take the DNA and I want to do like genetic tests and stuff
like that that would be amazing for me so I'm really excited that we have some
variegated we have a variegated strain because I find that really interesting
I'm fascinated with variegation right now I don't know why but uh yeah so
that's pretty exciting and then we will be growing some we don't have enough
space right now to be growing anything else we've got enough space for what
we're growing right now but we will eventually we're currently building our
third greenhouse and we have enough room for I think 12 more greenhouses
they just haven't been built yet COVID has kind of slowed down the investor
money coming in so it's kind of slowed everything down but yeah I have picked
out a whole bunch of different genetics that we could potentially grow and I
guess you guys will be updated as things start moving along but yeah I'm excited
to hear all about that Peter are you are you available I know you're making
dinner for the family but are you available to kind of what's going on in
your garden I would love to hear it if you are there if not we'll give you a
moment we'll give you some time I was actually midstream peeing but I'm done
now but I'm I pop a lot of stuff at home and then I kind of move it to other
places so right now I have a bunch of ABC which is Australian bastard cannabis
kind of Anna's point about the freaks just kind of growing stuff that's just
interesting and we had a cat piss conversation Brian some stuff that's
kind of in the cat pissy family to see see what I find and I kind of want to
start in on some like people were talking about the lines and I feel like
a lot of breeders have bred with kind of black lime reserve kind of as one of the
you know parents and so Jackson who's mean gene from Mendocino he also has
sky Jaro and I want to kind of explore that it's that's kind of next on the on
the agenda sounds like you have a fun fun rest of your year plan for you
that's for sure I've been really interested to see the
beauty of being in SoCal is you can grow up though hell yeah yeah I got I actually
heat my greenhouse in Canada with the heat that comes out of my indoor I have
my like a very interesting thing I wish I could be down there in Cali where it's
nice and warm Cory you're up next brother what are you planting what are
you excited about
man a few for me commercially I'm kind of going down more of the terpene kind
of area so I'm trying to take a look at things that have something called
is a bolo or is something that has found like a camomile this is kind of
like a sweet floral type of aroma the other kind of thing why I'm kind of doing
it is it also said to have some skin healing properties so it's kind of a
project that we're working on for that stuff and then there's also terpene
lean so one of my favorites ever is a chocolate I think is one that I can kind
of relate to anybody who's looking for a strain name on that but same thing
like a nutmeg cumin type of taste of what I'm looking for and then like my
medical garden at home I'm really really really excited about the McSlurry that I
have which is a Mac frost with the slurry cane and just hoping to get to
get a good profile out of that because it looks real good so I'm hoping the
bark as good as it as it bites almost here the bite as good as it barks so
we'll see how it goes I'm done Corey chocolate is awesome I love that shit I
have yeah I have some old school like still in the old school packaging I'm
really taking my time with those seats heaven
especially for trip Italy the cherry West by Jackson at pre-born is like
second and on straighter penalty
Corey's got to run that next you know he's gonna so I got it like unfortunately
RJ I know you're not growing anything but I mean it's that time here it's
hitting September so I mean you're not looking there might be some early
Canadian kind of genetics that are being taken down and be extracted now there
might be some auto flower kind of stuff is there something that you're excited
to try or taste or is there something that you've extracted recently that gets
you going and gets too excited to talk about just I want to like I want to have
the conversation but I can't exactly you know what you know what I'm getting I
get you there has been some stuff that I've extracted recently that I'm pretty
excited about unfortunately I cannot talk about it but yet we're nearing
cropped over so there's going to be the plentiful Canada's around especially in
the Canadian market so gonna be fun
honestly I'm just I'm excited for gas I just want better grown flower than I'm
currently getting so with the most recent
evolution I guess that my company that I work for just bought a grow company so
now we have a lemon source or a house source of flower that's gonna be great
so hopefully hopefully yeah hopefully the fall is looking much more terp rich
and dank than the summer was very very excited and I mean like I'm just you
know you're in the Okanagan Valley and we've had a ton of fires this year and
and you know there's definitely some large outdoor grows but it's definitely
going to be a challenge for them a so you're gonna have to work your ass well
luckily being in the legal world we don't get much outdoor that's local so
the material that we're dealing with hasn't really been too scarred or marred
by the smoke but also you know we've only had a little bit come down so far
so we'll see I think a lot of a lot of material will go straight to extraction
and then we'll probably go to distill it and isolate because of the smoke
content which will be very interesting will be interesting for us to try to
remediate as well not too sure how that's gonna go if it's even possible so
maybe I'm excited for that maybe I'm excited to see you know how we can step
up our refinement game I try anything that you refine and work on because I
know you're gonna take the utmost care and put it out Cory on stage has even
tried to product and can speak well of it so we're just gonna make things real
easy today instead of like closing down the room and opening up another room
we're just gonna open up the stage right here I'm gonna invite everybody up I'm
gonna do this magic thing say thank you to the world and appreciate it so we're
gonna end the recording period but we're gonna keep the room open so anybody that
wants to hop on stage and welcome to do so without having to worry about it so
come on up I'm gonna throw a bunch of invites out there and we're just gonna
let loose chill out and hang out with our experts on the show today any
questions you have any comments or anything too I mean I'd love to know a
well I well I've got the opportunity here I mean RJ is there a flavor that
you really want to see coming up or that you've been looking for that hasn't
really been available yet because I know you're at your it's mostly the old
school like I want the old hazes I want the old Kong girl you know like that
kind of stuff that's that's kind of where I'm at I love I love the old
genetics I feel like the new flavors are great for a lot of gas and we're
seeing some you know cool fruity kind of gas and that's dope but I don't know my
my heart lies with the old hazes I want that like you know super upper like
cocaine kind of feeling you know like that just forgot your car keys man I
have to go back and check like did I lock my door and then I go inside and I
hear something out back and people through the blinds all paranoid and shit
and I start laughing at myself but I'm so fucking high and like I love that
and again this is the casual conversation after the conversation is
now 603 we have turned off the recording button don't worry about it come up on
stage and hang out guys we're just gonna have a conversation and invite everybody
up to speak and join in and I have any questions got some amazing people on the
stage right now that would it's a privilege to even be speaking with them
at this point I'm not gonna lie Ashley Josh Damon
James and Peter dr. anabas Corey RJ I mean like I have as a chef of 15 years
and somebody that's just jumped into the cannabis space myself it's an honor to
get to be up here and hold conversation and so I look forward to every show we
get to have in the future just night but it's not gonna get you
because it's on camera but you can come up I'd noticed a question there on
YouTube I just want to take a look there and people were wondering if dr. anabas
could give her definition of the cultivar I know I have my own definition
but Emma's will likely be considerably more detailed oh man I put my computer
away so a cultivar like I said at the very beginning a cultivar and a strain
are conceptually the same except that a cultivar to be formally recognized as a
cultivar it actually has to go through some specific hoops through the
international international cultivar no in clature society no that's not what
the name of it is but in order to be a cultivar it has to be unique first of
all so there has to be something that you can show is different about this new
thing then from anything else that's out there which is of course is very
difficult to do in cannabis because there aren't that many cultivars okay so
it's the International Code of nomenclature for cultivated plants that
determines the the fulfillment of the requirements and then you can register
the formal name so the actual like things it has to be selected for a
particular character or combination of characteristics it has to be distinct
uniform and stable in these characteristics and when propagated by
appropriate means it has to retain those characteristics and for most intents and
purposes a lot of cannabis doesn't do that it's not genetically stable you can
clone it and come up with different things sometimes it's not necessarily
you know I mean there's so many there's so many out different types out there
that showing distinctness could potentially be difficult and especially
since we have you know they change depending on where they're grown so you
could say you know it's a distinct form and you've been growing it in Oregon and
then somebody grows it in Florida and it doesn't grow the same well that's not
uniform or distinct so cultivar actually has like some pretty specific things
pretty specific like milestones that it has to reach in order to be considered a
cultivar and strain is just like a stepping stone to get there you can the
way I think of it is like puppies like you can breed too much together and
you'll get a variety of different puppies you pick one of those puppies
and you're like yeah this is the one I want and I'm gonna call it Charlie
that's not automatically a new breed that's just Charlie right in order to
make Charlie a new breed of dog you actually have to breed Charlie with
potentially one of the parents and then start selecting out the ones that
continue to look like Charlie until you get a line of dogs that when you breed
them together they always come out looking like Charlie and that would be
the equivalent of what a cultivar is or a variety or yeah cultivar variety so
you're saying so so Anna you're saying that if that the that my shih tzu
Habonese cross is not a have a shit it hasn't been inbred and enough to be
considered a cultivar is it's not considered you could absolutely call it
a have a shit whether or not it's recognized as a breed by the AKC is
probably a different story so it's really about yeah I mean you can have a
shit named Charlie and Charlie exists Charlie is a thing it is a cross between
a shih tzu and a whatever the thing he said is it's a thing it's not a not a
thing it's just not a recognized breed you could make it into a recognized
breed by doing some more work but as of yet your your have a shit is not a
recognized cultivar
awesome I have a great question here for you all from the YouTube first Matthew
SoCal asked could you please ask what they use to determine from the data and
individual phenotypes efficacy for example how did the doctor come to
conclusion she should she should not have called a phenotype for medical
purposes specifically returning to like efficacy for medical Josh you look like
you wanted to jump in yeah I can step in a little bit I think it's like I
mentioned earlier using data can only give you so much of the picture currently
in the legal market in Canada unfortunately we're only getting to the
point where we can actually kind of set up trials with actual patients and like
that's still very much in its infancy so currently we have to use profiles that
are target profiles that we you know presume have medical benefit from
previous data and like it also mentioned when we you know in our own medical
grows we can be a lot more specific to the actual patient and you know find a
line that you know or you know epilepsy or pain you know like you're looking
for different profiles but you can take several samples to someone and say you
know which one of these works best for your pain you know this the strain is
supposed to be good for it and you know out of the data I've been able to
identify that you know these are the the ones that will be most easily cultivated
do any of these work for you you know if at that point they say no none of
these work you know you can still go through and you know find something that
you know as far as the data is concerned wouldn't be viable if you find something
for example with extremely low yield there's historically many many cultivars
that are absolutely amazing that have a really terrible yield but you know at
the end of the day when you're trying to find something that's medically relevant
the yield isn't always you know that deciding factor so you know with the
data you can find you know different traits within the cannabis you know
using trait markers we can identify you know various things that contribute to
yield or you know over time we'll be able to use genetic mapping to you know
in in unison with you know actual trials with patients and then take that
data in court like you know analyze it with the genetic data to try and
identify markers that are specifically responsible for the various like
benefits that we're getting from the cannabis but that's you know that's still
a ways into the future so currently using data is more of a in the legal
system you're you know looking for the best target that you can go for but
unfortunately we're just not at the point where we can through the legal
market hand out you know a bunch of different samples of the same strain
phenotypes try and identify the the most efficacious phenotype so you know using
the data we we try and find the best possible option
I'm just so little dated now that we're still kind of like running all the tests
and everything like that to figure it all out a I mean it's it's definitely
complex I wanted to just take a moment and and say welcome to new people that
have joined us welcome to hop up on stage is the show after the show where
you get to hang out with the experts on stage and come up and join the
conversation I just wanted to say welcome oh ye Drew Moen and Steve do any
of you have a question comment or rebuttal to anything going on in the
conversation at this point in time if you'd like to jump in now go ahead and
do so otherwise welcome to the stage it's always great to see you guys I know
a few of you have been here regularly Johnny as well if you have a question
comment or rebuttal go ahead and hop in and join the conversation we appreciate
dope we have a quiet group today that is for sure I'm gonna it well we have
someone coming up Kelly welcome to this stage how are you doing
hello how are you how's everyone doing this evening wonderful wonderful welcome
to the stage did you have any questions comments or anything you'd like to put
up to our experts today or just come up and have I have a really crazy question
even coming from me it just I'm taking notes here so I'm just looking through
my notes but as you all are talking about yields data in talking about
location in terms of breeders and cultivars very strange question but does
the location of the actual person itself such as me does that modify the effect
that cannabinoids might have based upon where I am physically I know it's a very
strange question do I need to clarify a bit you mean like if you were at a gore
concert versus like I don't know a Neil Diamond concert well that would be more
vibrational I think in this sense I think I'm asking more of like in terms
of if I'm in California or Detroit or Kansas City you know does that matter
physically from a human standpoint because we are affected environmentally
as our plants I'm just curious as my physical location here in Kansas City
versus Antarctica are you know are there gonna be differences in the effects
based upon my physical location does that clarify a bit are you mentally in
the same state depends on the day well that depends on the answer then there
Kelly so I think if you're in the same state
oh it could also if there's something that physiologically has changed you
like for example when you go and stay a few weeks in Denver Colorado and you
happen to be a mile high your number of blood cells is going to change you'll
make more blood cells to carry more oxygen because there's less oxygen in
the air so yeah if there's something about the physical place that you're in
if you're in Antarctica and you're freezing your ass off because you don't
have you know I mean yeah if it's changing physically physiologically
even your diet so you might eat a hamburger one day and then a salad the
next day you can smoke the same thing it could potentially have a different
effect on you I don't know that any like some people might be able to tell the
difference many people probably wouldn't but yeah different you know if you're
tired versus well rested your diet and your medication anything that's you know
going on in your body it changes can definitely have an effect how much
you'll notice that difference in effect is is you know subjective I guess I
think the vibes of your environment will likely have a greater impact on you know
the high that you're gonna receive if I remember being a teenager and thinking
you know I can just keep smoking weed and I don't get high anymore and then
you have that you know you know surprise visit from your parents and
all of a sudden you blasted. Yeah this is also like a terroir related question as
well because I don't I'm not sure if that was also kind of related to it if
it was separate or not. Interestingly enough my question was answered on that
in I had one other question and I forgot what it was so please go ahead
and continue I'm Kelly and I'm complete for the moment until I find out what I
have a question I had thanks. Kelly I have the opportunity to be in a few
rooms with your amazing amazing questions and I look forward to the next
one trust me I really do I really enjoy them I think the aspect of point of like
is it gonna chemically affect the way your body takes it it's very interesting
and that your location could be it's just as much of effect as like your
state of mind but I think they're both play into each other a lot I just like
to welcome Sam to stage welcome to this stage Sam how are we doing today this is
the show after the show where we chill out and chat if I was correct last time
you're in the garden party I think we got into a pretty deep discussion about
cultivar about plants and using them to brew whiskey or bourbon is it Mike you
are correct I started to order the barrels oh cool so they said you want
to take a boy and tell it tell everybody kind of like what your your idea that
the project is that you're working on because I think it's super cool and I
think I love the opportunity so I'm gonna take that same process of kind of
aging cannabis and ever clear but then apply some whiskey barrels to that
situation and then just age it for probably the same amount of time as
probably gets well I'm thinking I'm gonna go all the way to 12 years so
it'll be a long project but starts off with just this first batch and I'll do a
couple batches every now and then I'm excited to hear that developing growth
because it's it's quite interesting and it's a huge project it takes a lot of
time that I think it needs to be kind of explored I would love to if I had the
time finances and everything around it so I look forward to following along
with that tomorrow tomorrow welcome to the stage you were with us earlier today
welcome back did you have any questions comments or anything for moderators or
for anybody on stage hi this is tomorrow again yeah I decided to come
back in because it was such great information earlier this morning I'm in
North Carolina so we have a pilot program for growing CBD here and I just
wondered if anybody had any insights on good genetics or a good genetic practice
like for like the eastern North Carolina area you guys have access to
better genetics than we do here in Canada especially in the brown just the
way the regulations are set up it's a minimum of two years to register a new
hemp cultivar and right now save for one maybe two they are all bred for
fiber or seed so food or fiber there are a number of companies working to get
cultivars in but it's an arduous process through the Canadian it's the
CFIA if I if I I believe I'm correct but Damon might correct me here but but yeah
so I think you'd look to cultivators in California and in states around you and
even if they're not in the same state as long as they know what conditions and
where you're at they're gonna be able to direct you towards certain cultivars
that will grow well in your region and you know just understand are you in a
humid environment or you know a hot environment and how long is their summer
and you know be cognizant of that but but you know look for somebody who knows
what they're talking about and you know trust in them tomorrow I would like to
recommend Oregon CBD they are a really good company and it is run by you know
people who know what they're doing they put a lot of time and effort they do a
lot of genetic work like actual like DNA and and they have on-site lab and all
kinds of stuff so that's where I would start high-grade hemp is also an awesome
company we order things to them and they're a good price and stellar
customer service and then there was another there so I have a whole bunch of
stuff that I've been collecting because I also am looking for suppliers for
seeds but I would start there there's because it's kind of the end of the
season there a lot of people are like sold out of their seeds or or they or
the yeah they're sold out they don't have a large inventory let me open up
this document and see if I can't pull up some other names real quick so I I so I
don't know in your state what the requirements are in New Jersey we they
have to be pre-approved by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture in
order to supply seeds so we kind of cross-referenced seeds men who have
already been approved to vet for our for our supply Fortuna has a pretty good
selection front-range bioscience has had some interesting stuff but I'm not sure
how stable that company is right now I had friends that were working for them
who are not no longer they're no longer with the company I think they're kind of
petering out Davis hemp farms has some really interesting things blue forest
farms is another one and high alpine genetics has some good stuff and some of
them are gonna be really expensive like you're looking at like five dollars a
seed which is just crazy some of them are very reasonable between like 30 30
and 50 cents per seed and of course the price goes down the more volume of seeds
that you buy so I hope that helps a little bit oh that was awesome I thank
you so much yeah here in North Carolina we don't really have a a program yet but
they're doing like a pilot program and so they're letting like farmers and
processors sign up you know to work with the program and to see if it'll be
a viable crop for North Carolina so it's not like a lot of you know helpful
information so everything you guys have given has been great and I thank you for
it yeah so these seed companies have submitted
coas for each of their seed types and they have been compliant some of them
are not located in New Jersey though but I feel like New Jersey is kind of
wet too wet and warm so maybe similar climate but yeah it definitely is going
to take some some trial and error to figure out what works in your area but a
good rule of thumb to stay compliant is don't try to push past 8% for most
types 8% CBD is where you're going to hit almost always you're going to hit
that compliance line and if you try to get more than that you're going to go
over so that might be a good piece of information it brings to the table to
anybody who's trying to grow and be compliant in your area awesome well it
has been a great conversation so far we had do we have any more questions for
our moderators I mean like I was interested because I actually had a
friend of mine I was planning on doing a candidate and if you do have a question
go ahead and flash your mic and I will let you speak or bring you up there was
trying to start a indoor cannabis it wasn't cannabis I was cannabis because
it's all cannabis but it was doing a hemp and he was doing smokeable hemp in
Canada and the laws pertaining around growing hemp for smoking and cannabis
like as far as I'm aware you're not allowed to is does anybody have a little
bit more insight on that one maybe maybe more exact under but I'm from what
I'm able to read and understand is that in Canada at least at this point in time
you're not allowed to produce under a hemp license smokeable hemp you have to
be cannabis licensed but you can't produce hemp with a cannabis license I
think is how it goes does it does anybody have a clear answer they're
different licenses they're different regulatory bodies and yeah if hemp is
produced in Canada in the sense that we're all imagining in the way that
we're imagining hemp being produced and in big fields it it cannot be sold to a
processor who then has a license to sell on to the Canadian market as
smokeable flower at this point in time that makes sense to me I think it's kind
of I mean in hemp was never meant to be grown for you know medicinal and
pharmaceutical purposes if that's not what the USDA does and I'm sure that
the Canadian setup is similar but yeah the US is a mess and it's supposed to be
industrial hemp but unfortunately that that that legal line is that 0.3% so as
long as you stay under that you're in this you're in the hemp world you can
grow it for whatever you want as long as you stay under that 0.3% but yeah it
gets really it gets really messy and nobody's regulating CBD I mean the FDA
has one eye on it but really what are they gonna do because here it's the USDA
that regulates hemp it's FDA that regulates CBD and it's the DEA that
enforces the THC so if you go if you're in the hemp world and you're you're doing
it for CBD until it's out of the plant it's USDA once you take that CBD out of
the plant then it's FDA if you hit that 0.3% threshold now you're in DEA
territory so it's a total mess and it sounds like the Canadian industry makes
a lot more sense to me yeah I mean like the processing I think the whole hemp
cannabis debate and I'll say it right now I like I know there are markers in
cannabis for hemp varietals and stuff like that but they are like it's all
cannabis it's just a different form in my mind and by by creating these very
legal distinct separations of everything we just create so much more headache in
the long run in my personal opinion now it's getting to be about an hour and a
half we've had our speaker go through brought up a lot of amazing people I
had a lot of great conversations I'm gonna wind the room down and close it up
at this point in time does anybody have anything or questions comments or
anything they would like to say before we close up
okey-dokey well I appreciate each and every one you Josh Damon
James Peter dr. cannabis RJ oh he drew Steve Kelly Sam tomorrow Petro Lamar
Christopher Dave a Andrew Ellis Brennan Andrew Jody my wife Adele who is down
there in the beautiful audience so make sure to say hello to her Dalton Johnny
Arthur and Adrian I appreciate all of you thanks so much for coming to the
show thank you future cannabis project for helping us get the word out there
and joining us today and sharing it on YouTube we appreciate you guys and thank
you I want to I want to shout out Christopher down in the audience he's
been he's been in the audience it's pretty much every show start to finish

things bro Christopher I actually try and I try and drag him up all the time
he actually runs a Facebook community and is a great community leader and I
love having him and I always invite him in and to come up but he's always a
little bit busy I think he's a little bit nervous because he's French first as
he's in Quebec but I love to have him up and enjoying the conversation he is like
I've seen pictures of him with Frenchie cannoli and like
sorry about that everybody wonderful always you know how it is so we're gonna
just collect that person right there and we're gonna do this magical little
remove and report Rocha we appreciate you have a wonderful day they're into do

Thank You Chad Westport it's the the joy of having a working audio interface that
can connect to go analog to digital it's an inside joke there we last night

stepchild of cannabinoids and and terpenes or the like sibling unwanted
sibling step sibling so we're pulling some speakers together but I would love
for some of you who are in the chat who I know are on clubhouse Thursday night
