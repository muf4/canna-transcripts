[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  I wasn't in this game two years ago.
[00:01.960 --> 00:03.800]  I've been, I'm an underground grower, you know,
[00:03.800 --> 00:07.360]  and have been in the traditional market for over 45 years.
[00:07.360 --> 00:11.320]  And coming out and meeting like guys like Colin and Cam
[00:11.320 --> 00:13.400]  over the last couple of years has really helped me
[00:13.400 --> 00:16.120]  understand where the market's morphed into.
[00:16.120 --> 00:19.400]  And what I really appreciate about what you're doing is,
[00:19.400 --> 00:21.240]  and what I believe is critical at this point
[00:21.240 --> 00:24.760]  is we need to be preaching out and teaching out
[00:25.680 --> 00:27.000]  correct information.
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.280]  There's so much bad information out there.
[00:29.320 --> 00:30.680]  Absolutely.
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.080]  You know, that's what I'm seeing.
[00:32.080 --> 00:34.040]  People hurting themselves on oils
[00:34.040 --> 00:36.320]  that they don't understand that that's an internal
[00:36.320 --> 00:38.760]  and you're not supposed to smoke the damn thing, you know?
[00:38.760 --> 00:43.000]  And like my practice, I'm holistic, wild, craft, organic.
[00:44.240 --> 00:46.760]  My working with Cam, he's where I am
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.920]  as far as our methodologies with plants grow.
[00:48.920 --> 00:50.200]  And just so you understand,
[00:50.200 --> 00:53.440]  I've been smoking this plant since 1970.
[00:53.440 --> 00:55.720]  And for me, this has been my lifeline
[00:55.720 --> 00:57.840]  because I never really was into alcohol
[00:57.880 --> 01:00.120]  and I've done all the other drugs in the 70s.
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.560]  I'm a 70s era vet.
[01:01.560 --> 01:04.600]  I'm a old airborne combat engineer,
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.560]  and Green Brave, anyway, different world, different life.
[01:09.560 --> 01:11.160]  But stepping out of that time period
[01:11.160 --> 01:14.600]  is what helped me embrace a plant
[01:14.600 --> 01:17.400]  and learn to grow the plant was the fact
[01:17.400 --> 01:19.760]  that I could A, grow my own medicine,
[01:19.760 --> 01:22.560]  B, knew exactly where it came from,
[01:22.560 --> 01:24.880]  you know, knew that it was, that I'm the guy,
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.040]  you don't know what's going on at that whole thing.
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.920]  So that's a lot of where I am with it right now
[01:30.920 --> 01:32.200]  is trying to teach people,
[01:32.200 --> 01:34.440]  I wanna teach people how to grow their own plant.
[01:34.440 --> 01:36.200]  And if they can't grow their own plant,
[01:36.200 --> 01:39.880]  have access to stuff like what I do and what Cam does
[01:39.880 --> 01:42.760]  and what Colin is a proponent for.
[01:42.760 --> 01:44.200]  And what you are a proponent for
[01:44.200 --> 01:47.280]  is high quality, fresh medicine
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.520]  that comes from a reputable source that we know is clean.
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.160]  And that, you know, the end result is,
[01:53.160 --> 01:55.400]  is I get that it's an intoxicant,
[01:55.440 --> 01:58.440]  but we use this as a medicinal purpose
[01:58.440 --> 02:00.560]  to keep ourselves balanced and regulated.
[02:00.560 --> 02:02.840]  And some of the things I put in that text
[02:02.840 --> 02:03.680]  I put the other day,
[02:03.680 --> 02:05.560]  because it's part of my journey is,
[02:05.560 --> 02:07.000]  this has kept me, you know,
[02:09.680 --> 02:11.800]  I'm a trained killer sister,
[02:11.800 --> 02:15.480]  and it's taken me 50 years to get out of that mindset.
[02:16.680 --> 02:20.400]  Okay, and I approach the plant keeps me,
[02:20.400 --> 02:22.720]  I was never afraid of ever killing myself.
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.640]  My biggest fear was always that I would do something
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.680]  in a short moment of losing my grasp on things
[02:29.680 --> 02:32.440]  and hurt somebody or worse kill somebody
[02:32.440 --> 02:35.040]  and then spend my whole damn life in a six by nine.
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.640]  And that's always been my biggest, biggest, biggest concern
[02:39.640 --> 02:41.600]  of why I've isolated myself.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.280]  And, you know, I'm in rural Northern Humboldt County.
[02:44.280 --> 02:47.600]  You know, I'm not down in LA, I'm not in San Diego.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.440]  Hell, I'm not even,
[02:48.440 --> 02:51.000]  I'm four hours North of Santa Rosa where Cam is.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.600]  He lasts like four hours tops in these cities, I've seen it.
[02:54.600 --> 02:56.480]  He can last like four hours tops.
[02:56.480 --> 02:58.000]  And I don't blame you one bit.
[02:59.680 --> 03:01.200]  Yeah, it's hard.
[03:04.120 --> 03:08.960]  And why I love Colin so much is I understand his choice
[03:08.960 --> 03:10.120]  of being out in nature,
[03:10.120 --> 03:11.760]  because that's how I healed myself
[03:11.760 --> 03:13.280]  was having my hands in the dirt,
[03:13.280 --> 03:15.800]  my feet barefoot on the ground
[03:15.800 --> 03:17.920]  and working mother ganja with my hands
[03:17.920 --> 03:18.960]  and learning to love her
[03:18.960 --> 03:20.960]  and appreciate her for what she really is.
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.320]  And why I address it with people,
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.960]  this is a sacred, sacred plant.
[03:25.960 --> 03:28.880]  This is not some kind of,
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.000]  it's been demonized for only about 80 frippin' years
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.400]  is the part that pisses me off.
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.840]  I'm generationally a seven,
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.720]  you know, I was a young man in the seventies.
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.200]  So I saw this plant being demonized in nine,
[03:40.200 --> 03:42.240]  you know, people don't get it.
[03:42.240 --> 03:45.720]  The law only goes back to last fricking schedule one thing.
[03:45.720 --> 03:47.080]  That's 1970.
[03:47.080 --> 03:49.040]  That's only 50 frippin' years ago.
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.560]  That's not like that was long ago.
[03:51.160 --> 03:53.280]  When you talk about a plant that's been used on this planet
[03:53.280 --> 03:56.480]  for a conservatively six to 7,000 years.
[03:56.480 --> 03:57.320]  Conservative.
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.040]  You know, I'm seeing all kinds of crazy documentation now.
[04:01.040 --> 04:02.240]  I read an article the other day
[04:02.240 --> 04:04.320]  where they were going back into biblical times
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.400]  and finding the plant on altars
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.600]  that goes back before Christ was born.
[04:08.600 --> 04:11.000]  You know, so there's all these things that,
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.640]  and me personally, I'm gonna get way off on a tangent here,
[04:13.640 --> 04:15.160]  but I believe the anointed one
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.520]  was anointed with holy cannabis oil.
[04:17.520 --> 04:19.120]  And that's how I look at it.
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.040]  I believe that myself as well.
[04:21.040 --> 04:23.040]  So, and I'm glad you brought that up
[04:23.040 --> 04:25.560]  because one of the things that I do preach all the time
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.800]  is the fact that this plant was here
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.720]  way before any one of us that is alive today
[04:33.720 --> 04:37.120]  and will continue to be even after we're gone.
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.360]  There's nothing that we can do about that,
[04:40.360 --> 04:43.200]  but actually embrace it in our humanity
[04:43.200 --> 04:46.040]  and be able to make this world a better place,
[04:46.040 --> 04:50.400]  not only as in the person, as medicine that you use,
[04:50.400 --> 04:53.680]  but also as an eco-friendly crop
[04:53.680 --> 04:56.360]  that can potentially save our environment
[04:56.360 --> 04:59.320]  and give us all a better quality of life.
[04:59.320 --> 05:01.360]  You don't have to consume it.
[05:01.360 --> 05:03.640]  You don't have, it's not about consumption.
[05:03.640 --> 05:08.200]  It's about the potential and how it can actually,
[05:08.200 --> 05:10.080]  in essence, I know it may sound out there,
[05:10.080 --> 05:11.240]  but save the world.
[05:11.240 --> 05:13.840]  There's so many industries that right now,
[05:13.840 --> 05:17.360]  if they use the fiber for the plant,
[05:17.360 --> 05:21.000]  that it would take it to a next level
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.880]  and at the same time help the rest of the world.
[05:25.880 --> 05:29.160]  So, we should not take this lightly.
[05:29.160 --> 05:31.320]  That's usually how I preach it.
[05:32.240 --> 05:33.400]  There's so much work.
[05:33.400 --> 05:34.240]  Amen.
[05:34.240 --> 05:36.480]  Yeah, I think it's kind of,
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.440]  and I guess part of what I've realized
[05:38.440 --> 05:40.280]  is I would have been about,
[05:40.280 --> 05:44.560]  I got out of the traditional market after my military time
[05:44.560 --> 05:46.800]  and I just, I focused on just underground.
[05:46.800 --> 05:49.520]  I mean, I was literally pre-2000, you couldn't find me.
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.480]  I was in a four by five little box in Willets, California.
[05:53.480 --> 05:56.280]  You know, and if anybody's ever been to Willets before,
[05:56.280 --> 05:59.160]  that is a weed community that nothing else
[05:59.160 --> 06:02.440]  really pushes that little town anymore other than the plant.
[06:02.440 --> 06:05.720]  And that's kind of, again, that whole community.
[06:05.720 --> 06:07.920]  So, you know, I am a Longvale boy, man.
[06:07.920 --> 06:10.160]  You know, I was raised in Yucca.
[06:11.040 --> 06:13.600]  I am a NorCal through and through, you know.
[06:13.600 --> 06:15.280]  I've left and traveled the world.
[06:15.280 --> 06:18.720]  I've come back to this area and retired here
[06:18.720 --> 06:21.760]  and been in this craft for decades and decades now.
[06:21.760 --> 06:24.160]  And it's like watching where it's morphed
[06:24.160 --> 06:27.120]  from back when I first got into it
[06:27.120 --> 06:30.600]  to where it's transitioned about 10 or 15 years ago
[06:30.600 --> 06:32.600]  when I, you know, I love these youngsters that go,
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.160]  oh, I've been in it since it was legal.
[06:34.160 --> 06:36.160]  It's like, you haven't done shit.
[06:36.160 --> 06:38.440]  You know, you got into a game after we forged
[06:38.440 --> 06:41.120]  with our blood, sweat, and tears, jail time.
[06:41.120 --> 06:44.000]  Personally, I've been thrown in the, locked up for,
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.400]  you know, they took five years of my life
[06:45.400 --> 06:48.240]  back in the mid 80s, guys, you know, over this plant.
[06:48.240 --> 06:49.600]  Three quarters of an ounce.
[06:49.600 --> 06:51.480]  That's the crazy part of this.
[06:51.480 --> 06:55.880]  In 33 states, that's a ticketable or misdemeanor offense.
[06:55.880 --> 06:58.080]  And they threw me in fricking prison over it, you know.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.480]  And it's like, I look at it now
[06:59.480 --> 07:01.000]  where how it's shifted so much.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.440]  It's like, there's so, me, it's the love of the plant,
[07:05.440 --> 07:09.080]  what it does, how it helps us all,
[07:09.080 --> 07:10.760]  regardless of how you use it.
[07:10.760 --> 07:13.480]  Don't, you don't have to use, do it the way I do it.
[07:13.480 --> 07:14.840]  Do it the way that it works for you.
[07:14.840 --> 07:16.160]  I have friends that I've worked with
[07:16.160 --> 07:18.680]  from childhood epilepsy to a buddy I'm helping
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.680]  with Crohn's disease right now.
[07:20.680 --> 07:22.680]  And I assure you, my partner with Crohn's
[07:22.680 --> 07:25.200]  is not using the plant to get high.
[07:25.200 --> 07:27.160]  He's juicing the fricking green leaves,
[07:27.160 --> 07:28.440]  making smoothies out of them.
[07:28.440 --> 07:31.160]  He's drinking it internally because of the,
[07:31.160 --> 07:35.400]  all the, the high medicinal value that the whole plant has,
[07:36.240 --> 07:37.640]  that's again, that's where this thing,
[07:37.640 --> 07:39.480]  what I realized a couple of years ago,
[07:39.480 --> 07:42.600]  cause I wish Dr. Sue was here and maybe we'd get Ethan
[07:42.600 --> 07:45.360]  in on one of these conversations in the future.
[07:45.360 --> 07:48.760]  But this is a point where that we've taken old hippie,
[07:48.760 --> 07:51.240]  you know, a whole bunch of old slacker hippies,
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.880]  come hang out with me for a summer and do 3,000 hours
[07:53.880 --> 07:55.640]  in the hot sun on the side of a mountainside.
[07:55.640 --> 07:57.840]  I'll show you what lazy is, you know,
[07:57.840 --> 08:00.160]  and I'm in my mid sixties now, you know,
[08:00.160 --> 08:02.640]  it's like, this is, this is not a,
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.760]  it's not a lazy man's game, you know.
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.120]  The ones that are, this is their true,
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.320]  true craft professional cannabis growers
[08:09.320 --> 08:12.400]  and the animal triangle, what Cam preaches,
[08:12.400 --> 08:15.160]  what I preach, what we do as a craft,
[08:15.160 --> 08:17.240]  it comes out in our flower quality.
[08:17.240 --> 08:19.080]  And that's what I tell, I mean, again,
[08:19.080 --> 08:20.800]  I'm going to shut up and let,
[08:20.800 --> 08:23.040]  Colin could speak firsthand, brother, you, you know,
[08:23.040 --> 08:24.800]  you've smoked my flowers before, Cam,
[08:24.800 --> 08:25.840]  you've smoked my flowers before.
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.840]  Oh yeah, they're wonderful.
[08:27.840 --> 08:30.320]  Well, we also need to get rid of this differentiation
[08:30.320 --> 08:32.800]  between recreational and medicinal.
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.000]  It's all therapeutic and it's been used for, you know,
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.280]  all of human history as a food and fiber and fuel
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.760]  and a medicine and, and a way to become spiritual
[08:44.760 --> 08:45.600]  in our own way.
[08:45.600 --> 08:46.880]  And it's only been, like you said,
[08:46.880 --> 08:49.320]  the last 80 years that we've been without this
[08:49.320 --> 08:50.240]  and an interesting thing,
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.920]  and I'm not saying causation correlation,
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.320]  but we have had forever that it's only
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.960]  in the last several decades that we're starting
[08:57.960 --> 08:59.440]  to see these autoimmune diseases.
[08:59.440 --> 09:00.840]  We're starting to see allergies.
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.520]  We're starting to see these things
[09:03.240 --> 09:04.800]  where our bodies attack themselves.
[09:04.800 --> 09:06.720]  And we don't really have a written record
[09:06.720 --> 09:08.440]  of something like that previously,
[09:08.440 --> 09:11.680]  but we've also had cannabinoids in our diet
[09:11.680 --> 09:13.040]  for all of human history.
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.120]  And I can hear my dad saying, well, I never touched it.
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.360]  My grandfather never touched it.
[09:17.360 --> 09:20.840]  And I was like, no, but your livestock ate feral hemp.
[09:20.840 --> 09:23.200]  If your livestock's eating feral hemp
[09:23.200 --> 09:25.280]  and your chickens are eating the seeds
[09:25.280 --> 09:26.800]  and your goats are eating it,
[09:26.800 --> 09:28.960]  you're getting cannabinoids through your milk,
[09:28.960 --> 09:30.960]  through your dairy, through your meat,
[09:30.960 --> 09:33.960]  from that and acidic cannabinoids in the raw form
[09:33.960 --> 09:37.320]  are very effective at much smaller doses
[09:37.320 --> 09:39.200]  to find that homeostasis in our body.
[09:39.200 --> 09:41.000]  And so I think we're having to relearn
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  what we've forgotten throughout all of human history.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.080]  And you were talking about finding biblical evidence.
[09:48.360 --> 09:51.800]  Then what was it, Exodus 30, 23,
[09:51.800 --> 09:54.040]  it talks about the holy anointing oil.
[09:54.040 --> 09:56.640]  Well, there was a mistranslation in the early text
[09:56.640 --> 09:58.240]  of the Bible in a scepter agent
[09:58.240 --> 10:02.920]  where they changed calamus to cannabosin or vice versa.
[10:02.920 --> 10:05.520]  And there is references all throughout the Bible
[10:05.520 --> 10:06.360]  to cannabis.
[10:06.360 --> 10:07.600]  All through it.
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.120]  By how much cannabis,
[10:09.120 --> 10:10.800]  how many shekels it costs to put it
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.360]  in the holy anointing oil.
[10:12.360 --> 10:14.680]  And so if you're seeing ancient things
[10:14.680 --> 10:17.040]  about Jesus bringing sight to the blind
[10:17.040 --> 10:20.400]  or he's healing leprosy or he's casting out demons,
[10:20.400 --> 10:22.680]  well, if you have ocular pressure,
[10:22.680 --> 10:24.520]  you're gonna be blind with glaucoma.
[10:24.520 --> 10:26.560]  And if you're anointed with cannabis oil,
[10:26.560 --> 10:28.280]  reducing the ocular pressure,
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.800]  you get sight to the blind.
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.520]  Leprosy, which covered all kinds of skin conditions,
[10:32.520 --> 10:35.320]  but if you put a topical ointment of acidic cannabinoids,
[10:35.320 --> 10:37.720]  even decarboxylated cannabinoids
[10:37.720 --> 10:39.640]  on any kind of dermatitis
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.200]  or some sort of skin condition,
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.640]  it heals fairly quickly.
[10:43.640 --> 10:45.040]  So healing leprosy.
[10:45.040 --> 10:47.920]  Children or people with epilepsy having seizures
[10:47.920 --> 10:51.240]  could absolutely look like being possessed by a demon.
[10:51.240 --> 10:53.200]  Give them raw acidic cannabinoid,
[10:53.200 --> 10:55.080]  whole plant, wonderful goodness,
[10:55.080 --> 10:56.840]  and then you'll see a reduction in seizures
[10:56.840 --> 10:58.440]  or casting out demons.
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.120]  Now I'm not saying that's exactly what it is,
[11:00.120 --> 11:01.800]  but you gotta look at all the evidence
[11:01.800 --> 11:04.200]  and where we've come from and all the altars
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.480]  where they were burning seeds.
[11:05.480 --> 11:08.640]  They were burning this as part of a spirituality.
[11:08.640 --> 11:11.440]  But we've only had 80 years of misinformation,
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.560]  disinformation, propaganda, and bullshit.
[11:14.560 --> 11:15.400]  And we've got-
[11:15.400 --> 11:17.080]  In 80 years, dude.
[11:17.080 --> 11:18.640]  In 80 years.
[11:18.640 --> 11:20.040]  Yeah, in only 80 years.
[11:20.040 --> 11:21.080]  That's what people don't get.
[11:21.080 --> 11:24.000]  It's like, this is only since the early 1930s
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.080]  this has all changed.
[11:25.080 --> 11:27.680]  This hasn't even been in a hundred year time period.
[11:29.040 --> 11:34.040]  And again, I get it, I just don't understand it.
[11:35.240 --> 11:37.360]  The get it part is it's all about greed
[11:37.360 --> 11:40.120]  and it's all about corruption and control.
[11:40.120 --> 11:41.480]  And what we've realized now,
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.040]  what Cam hit it totally on the head,
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.160]  and Joanne and Collin, you guys know this too,
[11:47.160 --> 11:50.680]  we're talking about a plant that is food, medicine,
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.640]  fiber, fuel, rubber, concrete, all these things,
[11:55.640 --> 11:57.960]  all these industries that it spills into now,
[11:57.960 --> 11:59.560]  it's why they, it's greed.
[11:59.560 --> 12:01.080]  They wanna keep it demonized
[12:01.080 --> 12:03.720]  so that people stay away from it.
[12:03.720 --> 12:06.120]  I'm glad to see that we got industrial hemp
[12:06.120 --> 12:08.680]  out of that loop and put back into a textile
[12:08.680 --> 12:10.560]  that it could be used as.
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.440]  And again, breeders that wanna breed that thread
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.480]  and go into CBD specific strains for research
[12:17.480 --> 12:20.360]  and development and for medical applications to do that.
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.720]  I'm totally glad to see that that happens
[12:24.720 --> 12:26.800]  and keeps going that way.
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.400]  For me and for Cam and you guys too,
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.800]  cause you guys use the plant and I know what Collin,
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.480]  what his thread is and how, what he preaches and follows.
[12:36.480 --> 12:38.840]  And I believe it in Collin's mission
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.760]  so much it's beyond words.
[12:40.760 --> 12:42.560]  I believe in Collin's mission so much
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.720]  that I drove down 750 miles one way two years ago
[12:46.720 --> 12:48.800]  and brought my flowers down for his birthday
[12:48.800 --> 12:50.600]  just to go hang out with him.
[12:51.520 --> 12:53.760]  And that's what my connection to him is.
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.840]  And him, like a lot of people don't know,
[12:56.840 --> 12:58.920]  he literally knows where I live.
[12:59.960 --> 13:01.320]  Just when I told him where I live,
[13:01.320 --> 13:03.760]  he's got all my, that's where I wanna retire to.
[13:04.960 --> 13:08.040]  That's kind of how we are drawn together.
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.640]  And I know Collin's backstory and he knows mine.
[13:10.640 --> 13:13.000]  And again, we shared a similar path
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.280]  of how we went through the military.
[13:15.280 --> 13:17.720]  And sister, I don't know yours,
[13:17.720 --> 13:21.200]  but I have two daughters that are fricking veterans,
[13:21.200 --> 13:23.120]  and I already know what women endure
[13:23.120 --> 13:24.200]  going through the military.
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.360]  And I applaud you so much for what you endured
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.800]  to get to where you are and to be able to use
[13:30.800 --> 13:33.600]  your platform now as a military veteran
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.520]  to help bring in other female veterans into this mix.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.960]  And just as a whole to get it beyond,
[13:42.960 --> 13:46.400]  this isn't a we thing, this isn't a me thing or I thing,
[13:46.400 --> 13:48.800]  this is a we thing where we can touch a lot of people.
[13:48.800 --> 13:49.640]  And-
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.640]  Yeah, this is a community thing.
[13:50.640 --> 13:51.920]  Thank you.
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.000]  It kills me.
[13:55.080 --> 13:59.920]  Just briefly, I've been blown up twice,
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.040]  fragged once, I've jumped out of airplanes.
[14:03.040 --> 14:05.160]  I got bad shoulders, bad knees, but anyway,
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.160]  long story short, the regime was 750 milligram bicarbons
[14:11.040 --> 14:14.600]  on a 90 count with unlimited supply
[14:14.640 --> 14:17.280]  and go home and lay on the fricking floor.
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.680]  That was the recourse of Western medicine.
[14:19.680 --> 14:22.320]  And I just wasn't gonna buy that, you know,
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.040]  and I don't take synthetics.
[14:25.040 --> 14:27.800]  You know, I drink coffee, I smoke my fine herb
[14:27.800 --> 14:30.200]  that I produce myself, and that's about it.
[14:30.200 --> 14:33.000]  I take occasionally if my joints are really killing me,
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  I might take a little olive or something
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.040]  for just to sit till I get to sleep.
[14:37.040 --> 14:39.160]  But other than that, I really don't take
[14:39.160 --> 14:42.200]  a whole lot of plethora of things that they want.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.800]  The VA has issued, you know,
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.120]  I'm 100% pink card carrying member and I'm not retired.
[14:48.120 --> 14:49.760]  You know, I'm 100% disabled.
[14:49.760 --> 14:52.240]  I'm not, you know, I didn't make 20 years of this.
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.440]  I did my first tour and they damn near killed me
[14:54.440 --> 14:56.120]  in my first two or three times, you know,
[14:56.120 --> 14:57.640]  and that was it for me.
[14:57.640 --> 15:00.520]  You know, it's like I got out and it's like,
[15:00.520 --> 15:02.280]  and have been where you guys are now,
[15:02.280 --> 15:05.320]  we're not acknowledgement within the VA system,
[15:05.320 --> 15:06.400]  getting off point here a little bit,
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.880]  but it still rounds back to this
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.720]  because I meet young men and women
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.160]  that are you guys age range now
[15:11.160 --> 15:13.160]  where they're getting the same kind of treatment
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.560]  I was getting back in the 80s and 90s
[15:15.560 --> 15:18.000]  when all I really wanted, I blew shit up for a living.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.240]  All I wanted was hearing aids.
[15:20.240 --> 15:22.040]  You know, that's all I ever asked for was hearing aids.
[15:22.040 --> 15:23.400]  And now they own me 100%
[15:23.400 --> 15:26.280]  because they wouldn't give me hearing aids 30 years ago.
[15:26.280 --> 15:28.280]  Okay, that's just how,
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.040]  but I hear the same stories from young men and women,
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.040]  like the ones that are getting out today
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.600]  that they don't know they're,
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.600]  we're all damaged and I tell anybody over about the age of 18
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.920]  you get out on your own, everybody has PTS, everybody.
[15:43.920 --> 15:46.720]  You know, even if you live silver spoon in your life
[15:46.720 --> 15:49.360]  and you were coddled till your 21st birthday,
[15:49.360 --> 15:50.680]  as soon as you walked out the door,
[15:50.680 --> 15:52.760]  somebody punched you in your teeth.
[15:52.760 --> 15:54.920]  That's just the fact of life.
[15:54.920 --> 15:57.360]  That's just how it is, you know?
[16:00.240 --> 16:02.880]  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Joanne.
[16:02.880 --> 16:05.320]  Can you please cut in on any of it?
[16:05.320 --> 16:06.160]  Thank you.
[16:06.160 --> 16:10.040]  Well, I, so what I wanted to say with respect to my mission
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.000]  and what I'm doing is just,
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.480]  I want this information that we're having these discussions,
[16:15.480 --> 16:19.600]  I want the people to be able to hear this information
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.040]  because, you know, you guys have been doing this for decades.
[16:23.040 --> 16:25.280]  There's people before you that have been doing it as well.
[16:25.280 --> 16:26.640]  This is nothing new.
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.240]  This information has been here, like we said,
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.600]  you mentioned biblical times, potentially back then,
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.080]  this was utilized to help people.
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.280]  So as far as me, yes, as a military service member,
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.160]  I had my issues, almost lost my life as well.
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.160]  And cannabis saved me after I got out where I was lost
[16:53.440 --> 16:58.240]  with PTSD, anxiety, from an accident
[16:58.240 --> 17:00.440]  that I suffered a concussion,
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.040]  lost the English language for almost 20 minutes,
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.160]  then got out and was in a dark cloud in my head
[17:11.240 --> 17:13.040]  that I didn't know what to do.
[17:13.040 --> 17:15.360]  Fortunately and randomly met somebody
[17:15.360 --> 17:19.080]  who introduced me to cannabis for medicinal purposes,
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.160]  which honestly it was meant to be because I'm pretty sure
[17:23.160 --> 17:26.920]  based on my background, you know, growing up Christianity,
[17:26.920 --> 17:30.160]  you know, and being drilled that cannabis is a drug
[17:30.200 --> 17:33.800]  and X, Y, Z, you already know the narrative there.
[17:34.800 --> 17:37.840]  If it was introduced as something like we're doing it
[17:37.840 --> 17:42.600]  for fun, likely I may have not gone that route.
[17:42.600 --> 17:44.520]  But I met a grower like you guys
[17:44.520 --> 17:47.320]  who takes this very seriously that understand
[17:47.320 --> 17:49.880]  that whether you do this, you know,
[17:49.880 --> 17:51.960]  when you sit on the couch just,
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.960]  or because you are looking to cure your cancer,
[17:57.880 --> 18:01.720]  get through chemo or something like that, it's medicinal.
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.200]  Because at the end of the day,
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.560]  we're doing it to feel better,
[18:06.560 --> 18:09.240]  to get to a better mental state or physical
[18:09.240 --> 18:11.800]  or emotional for that matter.
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.520]  So in that introduction, I felt so much better,
[18:16.520 --> 18:21.520]  like almost immediately mentally after three years
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.080]  of being in that cloud.
[18:24.080 --> 18:28.800]  And I decided that I would make this my mission,
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.080]  you know, to battle the misinformation
[18:33.080 --> 18:35.920]  because then I started doing my own research
[18:35.920 --> 18:37.640]  and one thing led to the next.
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.240]  And then, you know, the whole,
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.160]  if we're talking and touching back
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.680]  on what Doc was saying here, greed and just business,
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.840]  you know, people wanting to destroy other industries.
[18:51.880 --> 18:53.680]  Obviously cannabis is something
[18:53.680 --> 18:55.360]  that people can grow at home.
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.560]  If you have land, you can grow cannabis
[18:57.560 --> 18:59.440]  and help a lot of people.
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.280]  So I feel like people back in the day, you know,
[19:04.280 --> 19:08.040]  we have the paper industry, we have the plastics industry,
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.280]  we have all these other industries
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.880]  that wanted to make money and this crop is cheaper
[19:14.880 --> 19:18.840]  and to grow and it grows faster.
[19:18.880 --> 19:22.880]  It was just a greed, you know, in capitalism
[19:22.880 --> 19:26.560]  that created that narrative that cannabis was bad.
[19:26.560 --> 19:28.440]  Obviously, you know, we cannot deny
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.720]  there was some racist undertone as well
[19:31.720 --> 19:33.560]  in denying all of that.
[19:33.560 --> 19:37.920]  So it's about, we're in the era of information.
[19:37.920 --> 19:42.920]  So I think with all the technology that we have right now
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.280]  and all the true anecdotes of real people
[19:47.280 --> 19:49.920]  like yourselves, like myself, that we can say,
[19:49.920 --> 19:53.080]  hey, I am alive and this happened to me
[19:53.080 --> 19:58.080]  and I have all this evidence and I am not the only one.
[19:58.160 --> 20:01.320]  So that's like what we're doing with Veterans Walk and Talk
[20:01.320 --> 20:04.040]  with Cannabis Synergy, obviously you guys.
[20:04.040 --> 20:07.440]  And I think the fact that we can come together
[20:07.440 --> 20:09.000]  to have these conversations
[20:09.000 --> 20:12.360]  and then share it with our respective communities,
[20:12.360 --> 20:15.160]  I feel like because we're not lying, you know,
[20:15.200 --> 20:18.240]  this is actually the fact,
[20:18.240 --> 20:21.640]  I think that it's gonna spread.
[20:21.640 --> 20:24.960]  So I'm very hopeful for the near future
[20:24.960 --> 20:27.880]  that we can continue to have this conversations,
[20:27.880 --> 20:30.400]  get more people involved, you know,
[20:32.400 --> 20:34.560]  in all the areas, whether it's science,
[20:34.560 --> 20:39.560]  whether it's entertainment, education, business,
[20:39.640 --> 20:42.600]  cannabis pretty much touches on everything.
[20:42.720 --> 20:45.080]  And we have so much opportunity
[20:45.080 --> 20:46.920]  and I'm glad that we're seizing it.
[20:46.920 --> 20:49.080]  So thank you for having me here.
[20:49.080 --> 20:52.760]  Doc, can you give your like returning from war
[20:52.760 --> 20:56.760]  and kind of setting up, you know, in Humboldt
[20:56.760 --> 20:59.080]  and, you know, growing medicine.
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.560]  If that's what you want, yeah, I mean,
[21:00.560 --> 21:03.120]  if that's what you want, Peter, I'll start from wherever you are.
[21:03.120 --> 21:05.200]  Yeah, I'd like to hear your story
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.440]  and your focus on creating medicine for yourself
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.680]  and by creating medicine for yourself.
[21:10.720 --> 21:15.080]  And by extension, medicine that then helped other people.
[21:15.080 --> 21:18.520]  Well, that's as it's turning out, that's what I'm finding.
[21:18.520 --> 21:22.600]  So as breeding, like, you know, what have you noticed?
[21:22.600 --> 21:26.440]  Like, oh, I created this plant and it really helped me with X
[21:26.440 --> 21:29.040]  and I noticed that it had these terpenes or whatever,
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.200]  like get into that stuff.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.880]  All right, all right.
[21:32.880 --> 21:35.120]  Are you talking about like right now or what?
[21:35.120 --> 21:37.120]  No, no, no, like in the beginning
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.960]  and then kind of your journey of like discovering
[21:42.960 --> 21:45.560]  that if I breed in this direction,
[21:45.560 --> 21:50.800]  like it helps me more with PTSD or pain or sleep or whatever.
[21:50.800 --> 21:56.120]  And you came back from what it was Vietnam, I assume, right?
[21:56.120 --> 21:57.560]  Well, I'm the end of Vietnam.
[21:57.560 --> 22:01.000]  I'm the very tail end of it.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.360]  I'm considered a Cold War Green Beret,
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.200]  what they call a Cold War commando.
[22:05.240 --> 22:09.280]  I'm an unknown variable and have been up until about 2013.
[22:09.280 --> 22:12.240]  I was an unknown variable in the military system.
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.480]  Most military, quite honestly, 99.9% doesn't even know what we did
[22:16.480 --> 22:20.880]  because it's such that behind the fricking scenes.
[22:20.880 --> 22:23.640]  Yeah, so long story short, I did extractions.
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.920]  And then from extractions, I moved over to Europe
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.600]  where I was doing work in Northern Africa,
[22:28.600 --> 22:30.720]  working in all across Europe,
[22:30.760 --> 22:35.320]  fighting what we consider the Red Menace,
[22:35.320 --> 22:37.760]  the Communist Bloc, that whole part of it.
[22:37.760 --> 22:39.400]  I did two different times.
[22:39.400 --> 22:40.680]  And when I returned from that,
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.200]  I basically got kicked out in Fort Dix, New Jersey
[22:45.200 --> 22:50.360]  as a 22-year-old, not quite 23-year-old,
[22:50.360 --> 22:53.320]  completely messed up young man that didn't have a clue
[22:53.320 --> 22:55.480]  because everything that I believed to be true
[22:55.480 --> 22:58.440]  and fighting for truth, justice in the American way.
[22:58.480 --> 23:02.840]  When I got overseas, realized that it was a bunch of bullshit
[23:02.840 --> 23:04.320]  after a few years of time.
[23:04.320 --> 23:07.240]  It was really hard for me to get beyond.
[23:07.240 --> 23:09.360]  I was real angry when I came back,
[23:09.360 --> 23:13.400]  and why I isolated myself so much because it was so,
[23:13.400 --> 23:14.560]  it was bullshit.
[23:14.560 --> 23:16.200]  I knew it was bullshit.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.040]  I saw it, it crushed me.
[23:19.040 --> 23:21.080]  It really crushed me on a spiritual level
[23:21.080 --> 23:22.600]  and an emotional level.
[23:22.600 --> 23:26.440]  And then to lose brothers in arms behind the scenes.
[23:26.480 --> 23:30.120]  There's a thing in 79 called Eagle Claw, Desert One,
[23:30.120 --> 23:35.120]  was the attempt to remove the Iranian hostages,
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.600]  ours, people out of that building.
[23:38.600 --> 23:40.200]  We were the group that went in,
[23:40.200 --> 23:42.240]  the very first joint task force ever
[23:42.240 --> 23:43.760]  for the United States military,
[23:43.760 --> 23:46.640]  the very, very first one, JTF-179.
[23:46.640 --> 23:50.400]  You know, it was what spun the 160th SOAR off of that,
[23:50.400 --> 23:54.680]  the 75th Rangers, Marine Recon, all kinds of crazy shit.
[23:54.680 --> 23:56.680]  Stuff that happens within the Navy now
[23:56.680 --> 23:59.360]  that was more from that original mission
[23:59.360 --> 24:01.320]  where nobody even knew about it.
[24:01.320 --> 24:04.520]  You know, we crashed in the desert
[24:04.520 --> 24:06.680]  and lost a half a dozen brothers.
[24:06.680 --> 24:09.880]  And I personally was on a team that was on the ground
[24:09.880 --> 24:14.120]  and we had packed in stealthily from fricking Pakistan.
[24:14.120 --> 24:16.040]  You know, it's like to get where we were
[24:16.040 --> 24:18.520]  to be outside of Tehran and then shit blow up
[24:18.520 --> 24:20.880]  and be told that we were on our own
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.440]  and nobody knew we were there
[24:22.480 --> 24:25.280]  and basically get your own fucking ass out.
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.520]  It's a tough thing to swallow, you know, to be left.
[24:29.520 --> 24:31.920]  And we were left in any way.
[24:35.940 --> 24:37.300]  Breathe, brother, breathe.
[24:44.380 --> 24:46.020]  I've never said that to anybody.
[24:47.540 --> 24:49.140]  You have any weed on hand, Doc?
[24:50.020 --> 24:51.220]  Of course.
[24:51.220 --> 24:53.700]  I've always got weed on hand.
[24:53.700 --> 24:55.660]  I've always have weed, you know?
[24:55.660 --> 24:56.500]  Okay.
[24:57.380 --> 24:58.700]  All right, you're with family.
[24:58.700 --> 24:59.740]  We're on our 60s now.
[24:59.980 --> 25:01.980]  We're all in our mid 60s now.
[25:01.980 --> 25:03.860]  And I just realized that I have a brother
[25:03.860 --> 25:06.180]  that's down in Santa Cruz that he put,
[25:06.180 --> 25:08.740]  he was the one side of the team that the six of us,
[25:08.740 --> 25:09.820]  there was seven of us, you know,
[25:09.820 --> 25:11.580]  there was only seven of us on the ground
[25:11.580 --> 25:18.410]  and we basically were just denied by our country.
[25:29.370 --> 25:30.530]  You're a survivor.
[25:31.930 --> 25:33.050]  You're still here.
[25:34.570 --> 25:36.690]  And you guys are dealing with it too.
[25:36.690 --> 25:38.210]  You know, you guys, there's nothing's changed.
[25:38.210 --> 25:39.490]  You guys come back and you're denied
[25:39.490 --> 25:41.010]  like we were denied in the 80s.
[25:41.410 --> 25:44.930]  It's like I got out in 82,
[25:44.930 --> 25:49.290]  after a stupid six years and got out in 82
[25:49.290 --> 25:52.730]  and I went in 88 just to get my ears
[25:52.730 --> 25:54.090]  because I couldn't hear anything, you know?
[25:54.090 --> 25:56.130]  And like denied, denied, denied.
[25:56.130 --> 25:57.530]  And I see that happening again.
[25:57.530 --> 26:01.450]  And what Peter basically asked me is what happened?
[26:01.450 --> 26:04.810]  It's like, you know, I said, fuck this
[26:04.810 --> 26:06.730]  and unplugged and moved off into the middle
[26:06.730 --> 26:08.250]  of nowhere by myself.
[26:09.490 --> 26:10.450]  Okay.
[26:10.890 --> 26:14.450]  And I was getting flour from people,
[26:14.450 --> 26:16.570]  you know, getting flour from people.
[26:16.570 --> 26:18.770]  It was okay, but it was seedy weed, you know?
[26:18.770 --> 26:19.610]  And I was just starting,
[26:19.610 --> 26:21.170]  there weren't any books back then, you know?
[26:21.170 --> 26:22.690]  We were just starting to figure out things,
[26:22.690 --> 26:24.490]  you know, and separating males from females
[26:24.490 --> 26:26.490]  and all, you know, I'm self-taught, you know?
[26:26.490 --> 26:29.050]  But now I have a breeding,
[26:29.050 --> 26:32.010]  cannabis breeding company that represents my flour line,
[26:32.010 --> 26:34.730]  you know, and my lawyers tell me I'm one of a handful
[26:34.730 --> 26:37.290]  of guys that do what I do in the world, you know?
[26:37.330 --> 26:42.010]  And I have been pheno hunting specifically
[26:42.010 --> 26:45.290]  for over 35 years now, or excuse me,
[26:45.290 --> 26:48.490]  chemo-var specific hunting for over 35 years
[26:48.490 --> 26:51.010]  on pheno specific types of cannabis.
[26:51.010 --> 26:54.290]  And it goes back to when, what Peter said,
[26:54.290 --> 26:56.610]  how, you know, I smoked my first joint in 70
[26:56.610 --> 27:00.770]  and started growing my first plant in about 72, you know?
[27:00.770 --> 27:01.970]  And it was trial and error.
[27:01.970 --> 27:03.770]  And back then it was, you know,
[27:03.810 --> 27:06.810]  Acapulco gold and Colombian red
[27:06.810 --> 27:10.610]  and highland silver tie coming over from overseas
[27:10.610 --> 27:12.250]  and things like that.
[27:12.250 --> 27:16.610]  And Mexican brown weed coming from down South, you know?
[27:16.610 --> 27:18.130]  So there was this influx.
[27:18.130 --> 27:20.290]  And then where I'm at specifically
[27:20.290 --> 27:22.650]  just happens to be the heart of the Emerald Triangle,
[27:22.650 --> 27:25.650]  you know, where I grew up and where I found my sanity
[27:25.650 --> 27:28.170]  and what I consider my home and my sanctuary, you know?
[27:28.170 --> 27:32.890]  And it's like that moment in time when I was,
[27:33.010 --> 27:35.210]  actually was in, right after I got out of prison
[27:35.210 --> 27:37.850]  and I was the only one that was able to take care
[27:37.850 --> 27:39.930]  of my mother who was going through breast cancer.
[27:39.930 --> 27:44.130]  And I became her primary caregiver for about 16 months.
[27:44.130 --> 27:47.250]  And that was me taking her back to chemotherapy every day
[27:47.250 --> 27:50.210]  and dealing with her double mastectomy,
[27:50.210 --> 27:52.770]  taking my mother that I loved dearly and taking her in
[27:52.770 --> 27:54.970]  and, you know, getting this luck coming back at the end
[27:54.970 --> 27:57.130]  after chemo and having to deal with her being sick.
[27:57.130 --> 28:01.010]  And anyway, this old man back then was a young man.
[28:01.050 --> 28:04.330]  I decided to take old school hippie therapy.
[28:04.330 --> 28:06.770]  And, you know, we worked where she ate
[28:06.770 --> 28:09.370]  about a quarter of a brownie, you know?
[28:09.370 --> 28:12.490]  And it helped me get her through her being sick part
[28:12.490 --> 28:14.490]  and keeping her appetite up.
[28:14.490 --> 28:17.330]  And, you know, a quarter of a brownie when she went in
[28:17.330 --> 28:19.650]  and a quarter when she came out, about a half a brownie.
[28:19.650 --> 28:21.610]  Anyway, this was just how I started getting
[28:21.610 --> 28:24.010]  into the medical application of this thing.
[28:24.010 --> 28:27.050]  And then for me, for my own damage was,
[28:28.050 --> 28:30.090]  I didn't even really know what it was,
[28:30.090 --> 28:31.490]  to answer Peter's question.
[28:31.490 --> 28:33.450]  I didn't even know what it was, quite honest, you guys.
[28:33.450 --> 28:36.930]  It was, I just knew that, and you guys get it.
[28:41.530 --> 28:42.370]  Right?
[28:42.370 --> 28:45.730]  That decompression that you get from when you,
[28:45.730 --> 28:49.650]  that you don't get from alcohol and you don't get from pills
[28:49.650 --> 28:51.690]  and you don't get from other synthetics
[28:51.690 --> 28:55.650]  and you don't get from speed or heroin or fricking coke.
[28:56.250 --> 28:57.930]  It only comes through this plant.
[28:57.930 --> 28:59.730]  Or even meditating.
[28:59.730 --> 29:01.930]  It's decompression is what I call it now.
[29:01.930 --> 29:05.490]  And I've seen this, and I've seen this with other men
[29:05.490 --> 29:06.530]  and women in the military.
[29:06.530 --> 29:08.730]  It's like, go be with them.
[29:08.730 --> 29:10.450]  And literally a buddy of mine,
[29:10.450 --> 29:11.970]  it's like take a hit off a joint.
[29:11.970 --> 29:16.970]  And literally in a combat bat, 30s, good guy,
[29:17.010 --> 29:21.250]  lot of tough situations in his military career,
[29:21.250 --> 29:23.890]  turned into alcohol and painkillers and was hating him,
[29:23.890 --> 29:25.650]  hating his life, hating his world.
[29:25.650 --> 29:27.890]  Literally a guy my age, a buddy of his,
[29:27.890 --> 29:30.610]  his big brother said, dude, you need to smoke a joint.
[29:30.610 --> 29:33.530]  Well, long story short, now he's using the plant,
[29:33.530 --> 29:35.810]  using the sacred plant for his daily,
[29:35.810 --> 29:38.570]  working on it every day to get better and better.
[29:38.570 --> 29:41.890]  That being said, him to me, smoking one of my joints,
[29:41.890 --> 29:45.850]  walking on Collinsdale, homeboy started crying.
[29:46.690 --> 29:48.450]  You know, laughing and crying.
[29:48.450 --> 29:49.850]  He said, you know, I haven't cried and laughed
[29:49.850 --> 29:52.210]  in over three fricking years, man.
[29:52.210 --> 29:54.490]  That was to me, one more verification
[29:54.490 --> 29:58.850]  that this is medicine, that this is a holistic tool
[29:58.850 --> 30:01.610]  that we can use a natural, and like calling
[30:01.610 --> 30:04.330]  what I love about natural plant medicine,
[30:04.330 --> 30:07.770]  you know, pick it yourself, grow it yourself,
[30:07.770 --> 30:11.010]  raise it yourself, you know, make it, do it yourself.
[30:11.010 --> 30:12.530]  Then you know where it comes from.
[30:12.530 --> 30:15.290]  You know, and I get, not everybody can do that.
[30:15.290 --> 30:18.370]  Joanne, what you said, sister, I a hundred percent agree with
[30:18.370 --> 30:20.810]  I can teach people how to grow in a coffee can
[30:20.810 --> 30:23.210]  if they really want to know and get them an ounce
[30:23.210 --> 30:26.370]  of fine, fine flour off of a coffee can.
[30:27.970 --> 30:32.970]  You know, and I have a little two by four sun area
[30:33.010 --> 30:35.170]  in my back, you can do it.
[30:35.170 --> 30:36.970]  You know, there's bonsai.
[30:36.970 --> 30:39.850]  What I breed specifically now is I breed
[30:39.850 --> 30:42.730]  short structured plants designed for mom and pops
[30:42.730 --> 30:45.810]  to be cultivated in two to three gallon pots
[30:45.810 --> 30:48.890]  and yielding three to eight ounces,
[30:48.930 --> 30:51.370]  depending on what your skill level is.
[30:51.370 --> 30:54.570]  So for a mom and pop to have, you know, like we're here,
[30:54.570 --> 30:58.370]  anyone over 21, six plants, you know, mom and pop
[30:58.370 --> 31:01.290]  with skills, 12 plants, that's a lot of freaking flour
[31:01.290 --> 31:02.690]  if you know what the hell you're doing,
[31:02.690 --> 31:03.970]  or you don't even have to know what you're doing,
[31:03.970 --> 31:06.530]  just be willing to learn how to do it, you know,
[31:06.530 --> 31:09.490]  and hit and miss what I teach now and have for years
[31:09.490 --> 31:11.690]  is how to grow your own, you know.
[31:11.690 --> 31:14.690]  Me with what Cam and I are working on specifically
[31:14.690 --> 31:17.130]  is to get my flowers out and he does
[31:17.130 --> 31:18.530]  such beautiful work anyway.
[31:19.170 --> 31:20.810]  I'm so honored to even have an opportunity
[31:20.810 --> 31:22.610]  that he and I are getting to partner together.
[31:22.610 --> 31:24.170]  Just, you know, it's like,
[31:25.730 --> 31:30.010]  if I, well, I have picked a business partner,
[31:30.010 --> 31:32.410]  it's Cam Hatton and I'm thankful for it, you know,
[31:32.410 --> 31:33.970]  and that's how I look at this, you know.
[31:33.970 --> 31:35.330]  It's like if I was gonna pick somebody,
[31:35.330 --> 31:37.170]  it'd be Cam, him and his wife, you know,
[31:37.170 --> 31:41.130]  what they do for their business model is so clean
[31:41.130 --> 31:43.330]  and so pure and from a point of love.
[31:43.330 --> 31:45.290]  And it's like, you know, just, you know,
[31:45.290 --> 31:48.170]  we really try, and we're not out there, you know,
[31:48.810 --> 31:49.650]  and that's part of people that don't know
[31:49.650 --> 31:52.530]  who High Tide Distro is and they don't know who I am.
[31:52.530 --> 31:55.730]  Yeah, I just sent flowers to,
[31:55.730 --> 31:57.250]  we lost a brother down South.
[31:57.250 --> 31:58.890]  I just sent flowers to their group
[31:58.890 --> 32:02.890]  so they would have something to use for their healing.
[32:02.890 --> 32:06.090]  You know, it's like he and I, this thing we're doing,
[32:06.090 --> 32:08.090]  we're making agreements and he's aligning
[32:08.090 --> 32:10.130]  with other veterans, nonprofits,
[32:10.130 --> 32:13.450]  where we're gonna be giving flower away every damn month,
[32:13.450 --> 32:14.610]  you know, and we're not talking about
[32:14.610 --> 32:16.250]  giving away quarter bags, honey.
[32:16.250 --> 32:18.130]  We're gonna be giving away pounds of fricking flower.
[32:18.970 --> 32:19.810]  Why?
[32:19.810 --> 32:21.330]  Because we're gonna try and grow thousands and thousands
[32:21.330 --> 32:25.330]  of pounds of flower next year to put into this thread, okay?
[32:25.330 --> 32:28.010]  That's what we're working on right now, you know?
[32:28.010 --> 32:32.290]  And I love him so much and I have such tremendous love
[32:32.290 --> 32:34.650]  for his calling and sister, I'm so thankful for you
[32:34.650 --> 32:36.890]  to be in on this thing today with us.
[32:36.890 --> 32:39.370]  You know, I'm so honored that you're part
[32:39.370 --> 32:42.810]  of our conversation and I'm getting off point here,
[32:42.810 --> 32:47.810]  but my cultivating flowers specifically was about 16, 17,
[32:48.250 --> 32:53.050]  years ago, I got in 03, and again,
[32:53.050 --> 32:54.410]  this is before a lot of people,
[32:54.410 --> 32:56.610]  like before you were in this craft,
[32:56.610 --> 32:58.690]  you know, 17 years ago, most likely, you know,
[32:58.690 --> 33:03.690]  it's like in 2001, September the 11th happened,
[33:04.090 --> 33:07.770]  everybody shut down and internalized the market.
[33:07.770 --> 33:10.730]  It's a luxury based item, the market crashed.
[33:10.730 --> 33:13.530]  You know, I watched my flower go from five
[33:13.530 --> 33:17.530]  to $6,000 a pound a copy to under $3,000 a pound
[33:17.970 --> 33:22.330]  and it was still the three to 3,300 hours a year
[33:22.330 --> 33:25.690]  it wants to take to make the damn thing get done full sun.
[33:25.690 --> 33:28.290]  This is before light depth, you know,
[33:28.290 --> 33:31.690]  this is before greenhouses, full sun, outdoor,
[33:31.690 --> 33:33.930]  just the way mother nature and God almighty
[33:33.930 --> 33:36.410]  intended it to be, you know, 20 footers,
[33:36.410 --> 33:40.850]  16 foot wide, 20 feet tall, that kind of crazy stuff, right?
[33:40.850 --> 33:45.330]  That's how I, anyway, my old lamp art and I,
[33:45.330 --> 33:48.210]  between 03 and 05, the market tumbled,
[33:48.210 --> 33:51.490]  tumbled bad from 33,000 or so,
[33:51.490 --> 33:53.610]  where I believe is a fair marketable price
[33:53.610 --> 33:54.810]  where a farmer can make a living
[33:54.810 --> 33:56.930]  is about $3,000 a pound wholesale.
[33:56.930 --> 33:58.490]  That's a reasonable rate.
[33:58.490 --> 34:01.690]  There was a lot of money left at a $3,000 price point,
[34:01.690 --> 34:04.010]  a lot of money left for a retailer to make a killing
[34:04.010 --> 34:06.170]  when they're charging brothers and sisters,
[34:06.170 --> 34:09.890]  25, 30, 35, 40, $50 a gram.
[34:09.890 --> 34:13.970]  I know my flowers on the East Coast on both ends of it
[34:13.970 --> 34:18.010]  and they get 35 to $50 a gram for my frippin' flowers.
[34:18.010 --> 34:19.490]  It's ridiculous, okay?
[34:19.490 --> 34:20.850]  I'm getting way off on another tangent.
[34:20.850 --> 34:25.130]  My point is this portion of breeding specifically,
[34:25.130 --> 34:27.450]  you guys, this is what I've been working on
[34:27.450 --> 34:31.370]  for me specifically for two decades.
[34:31.370 --> 34:36.370]  In 03 to 06, I got what's getting out of the market.
[34:36.410 --> 34:38.850]  Well, we grew so much weed,
[34:38.850 --> 34:41.150]  it took me three years to get rid of it, guys.
[34:42.150 --> 34:44.830]  And I just couldn't do it anymore
[34:44.830 --> 34:45.670]  because it was the same,
[34:45.670 --> 34:48.630]  I was working 12 months out of the year.
[34:48.630 --> 34:52.670]  I got my old school, and people don't even know this,
[34:52.670 --> 34:56.710]  my old plant was from a buddy of mine called Old Dave.
[34:56.710 --> 34:59.750]  Old Dave, who has been gone for over 10 years,
[34:59.750 --> 35:03.150]  is the original creator of the Razzleberry Kush.
[35:05.550 --> 35:08.870]  And Dave has been gone for a decade
[35:08.870 --> 35:10.310]  and that one of my mentors,
[35:10.310 --> 35:13.790]  well, long story short, my Skunk OG plant
[35:13.790 --> 35:16.190]  that would just lay your ass out, it still does,
[35:16.190 --> 35:19.190]  it puts you on a couch in about 20 minutes.
[35:19.190 --> 35:22.230]  My friend, a very dear friend of mine
[35:22.230 --> 35:25.590]  that's a Blue Dream, the creator of Blue Dream,
[35:25.590 --> 35:29.470]  she gifted me a plant, a female,
[35:29.470 --> 35:31.190]  and I took it as something to do
[35:31.190 --> 35:32.910]  because I wasn't growing and she said,
[35:32.910 --> 35:35.050]  you need something to do here, smoke this.
[35:35.050 --> 35:37.710]  Blue Dream's a beautiful, cerebral smoke.
[35:37.710 --> 35:40.110]  It's really good for clearing your head,
[35:40.110 --> 35:42.750]  finding your balance, it doesn't put you on the couch.
[35:42.750 --> 35:45.470]  I don't know all the CBD, THC,
[35:45.470 --> 35:47.590]  but I do know what the effects are.
[35:47.590 --> 35:52.350]  Okay, so her plant with my Old Dave plant,
[35:52.350 --> 35:55.710]  which I call my OG Skunk, okay,
[35:55.710 --> 35:59.110]  what was called Mendo Skunk, Cam probably gets it
[35:59.110 --> 36:00.390]  because he's old enough to get it.
[36:00.390 --> 36:03.430]  He knows what the Mendocino Peace Plant was all about.
[36:03.430 --> 36:06.750]  You know, the Mendo Skunk, that's one of my legacies.
[36:07.270 --> 36:10.550]  I'm a creator of, team of creators on a lot of strains
[36:10.550 --> 36:13.710]  that are unknown breeders,
[36:13.710 --> 36:16.590]  the Green Mountain Growers Group before you guys,
[36:16.590 --> 36:18.350]  even before Cam was born.
[36:18.350 --> 36:22.230]  It's like these, as my 40 year old son says to me,
[36:22.230 --> 36:23.550]  you mean before me, dad?
[36:23.550 --> 36:26.070]  And it's like, yes, I'm before you.
[36:26.070 --> 36:30.830]  So that being said, that plant, that combination
[36:30.830 --> 36:34.870]  and 13, 14 years of breeding is what's releasing now
[36:34.870 --> 36:37.510]  is my, what I call my Blue Skunk Strain.
[36:37.510 --> 36:42.150]  And that is a very much created for post-traumatic stress
[36:42.150 --> 36:44.910]  for, with physical damage.
[36:44.910 --> 36:47.430]  This is something you can smoke that clears your head.
[36:47.430 --> 36:49.750]  You can smoke it or vape it, clears your head,
[36:49.750 --> 36:51.150]  clears your consciousness.
[36:51.150 --> 36:53.470]  And in about 20 minutes later, all of a sudden you go,
[36:53.470 --> 36:55.350]  oh, my shoulder doesn't hurt anymore, man.
[36:55.350 --> 36:57.230]  And my back isn't aching anymore.
[36:58.710 --> 37:00.590]  Now this is just me.
[37:00.590 --> 37:02.310]  What's happened in the last two years
[37:02.310 --> 37:04.790]  is me taking that plant and getting it out
[37:05.670 --> 37:08.310]  to people across our state and across the country
[37:08.310 --> 37:11.430]  and getting the same results back from veteran brothers
[37:11.430 --> 37:15.150]  and sisters going, I'm getting the same results.
[37:15.150 --> 37:18.390]  And now I've been the last, since the end of last year,
[37:18.390 --> 37:21.030]  since the Emerald Cup, now Breeders Best
[37:21.030 --> 37:22.310]  is my breeding company.
[37:22.310 --> 37:25.070]  They're helping me with patenting and branding.
[37:25.070 --> 37:29.910]  And that puts me in the same rooms with Ethan Russo,
[37:29.910 --> 37:33.470]  the neurologist cannabis guy in the fricking country.
[37:33.670 --> 37:36.230]  It puts me in the same room with Sue Sisley,
[37:36.230 --> 37:38.670]  the woman that's leading the fight
[37:38.670 --> 37:40.790]  for post-traumatic stress therapy,
[37:40.790 --> 37:42.270]  cannabis therapy for veterans.
[37:42.270 --> 37:47.270]  She's the one suing the VA on our behalf right now.
[37:47.350 --> 37:50.830]  And them to me, they wanna be where I'm at.
[37:50.830 --> 37:53.990]  That's what I got over in the earlier part of the year
[37:53.990 --> 37:56.510]  was Sue coming and searching me out with Dale
[37:56.510 --> 37:58.070]  so they could sit down with me.
[37:58.070 --> 37:59.550]  Cause they know that they're hearing
[37:59.550 --> 38:01.190]  about what my flowers are doing.
[38:01.230 --> 38:03.470]  And that's what I'm trying to get
[38:03.470 --> 38:05.670]  from this obscurity that I'm in,
[38:05.670 --> 38:07.350]  this unknown variable I'm in.
[38:07.350 --> 38:08.910]  And I don't even care about me.
[38:08.910 --> 38:10.270]  It is not about money to me.
[38:10.270 --> 38:11.790]  This is about helping men and women
[38:11.790 --> 38:13.710]  and helping brothers and sisters in the arms,
[38:13.710 --> 38:18.710]  specifically military veterans, first responders,
[38:19.390 --> 38:22.710]  anybody in crisis, that's what my threat is.
[38:22.710 --> 38:25.110]  And I'm not, again, I get it.
[38:25.110 --> 38:26.550]  Yes, it's recreational.
[38:26.550 --> 38:28.790]  Yes, you can, but that's not my threat.
[38:28.830 --> 38:31.470]  My agreement with my breeding company is
[38:31.470 --> 38:34.910]  I can stay conservatively, stay 70% or more
[38:34.910 --> 38:36.550]  in the medical field.
[38:36.550 --> 38:38.670]  Only 20 to 30% of my flowers
[38:38.670 --> 38:40.630]  will ever hit the recreational market
[38:40.630 --> 38:42.870]  and very, very on a limited scale.
[38:42.870 --> 38:44.470]  I wanna keep it in that thread.
[38:44.470 --> 38:46.430]  I don't want it to go that way.
[38:47.670 --> 38:50.990]  Personally for me, it's about the quality of the flower.
[38:50.990 --> 38:53.110]  It's about that initial intake.
[38:53.110 --> 38:56.270]  It's like something again, where Cam and I are very,
[38:57.070 --> 38:58.950]  we age weed for so long,
[38:58.950 --> 39:02.830]  people can't even get how long we cure our flowers.
[39:02.830 --> 39:04.150]  They don't even understand it.
[39:04.150 --> 39:05.230]  I'm pulling out stuff.
[39:05.230 --> 39:06.070]  It's-
[39:07.790 --> 39:09.830]  Exactly, well, you can sister,
[39:09.830 --> 39:12.310]  but again, you understand it.
[39:12.310 --> 39:15.070]  And that's what I welcome and hope.
[39:15.070 --> 39:17.070]  I wanna see you teaching this out.
[39:17.070 --> 39:20.590]  I know Colin teaches this out about how to look at plants.
[39:22.070 --> 39:23.670]  How do we bridge that gap?
[39:23.670 --> 39:25.270]  How do we get it out where,
[39:25.270 --> 39:27.230]  well, I'm hoping this is a first step.
[39:27.230 --> 39:29.790]  Now that you and I are in the same realm,
[39:29.790 --> 39:32.110]  it's like we have, you have access,
[39:32.110 --> 39:35.630]  sister, you have access to a grower in Humboldt County now.
[39:35.630 --> 39:37.590]  I can't wait to go over there.
[39:37.590 --> 39:39.190]  No.
[39:39.190 --> 39:43.230]  Because I feel like this is all in alignment.
[39:43.230 --> 39:46.710]  I feel like we're all in alignment in our mission.
[39:46.710 --> 39:51.430]  And obviously coming together would just give it more power
[39:51.430 --> 39:56.430]  and reach more people that we're trying to help.
[39:56.430 --> 39:57.550]  This is like you said,
[39:57.550 --> 40:01.550]  not for any personal agenda or anything like that.
[40:01.550 --> 40:05.470]  Like I said earlier, we can't take this lightly.
[40:05.470 --> 40:08.710]  Like if we have this information
[40:08.710 --> 40:11.190]  that can help so many people
[40:11.190 --> 40:15.430]  that you guys are putting into work intentionally
[40:15.430 --> 40:17.870]  to solve all of our problems.
[40:17.870 --> 40:21.630]  I mean, even if we just talk to veterans,
[40:21.630 --> 40:26.510]  like we are doing such a service to our community,
[40:26.510 --> 40:29.870]  to our people that we know what it is.
[40:29.870 --> 40:32.910]  In so many levels, you know, you don't have,
[40:32.910 --> 40:37.070]  you didn't, for a person like in the military,
[40:37.070 --> 40:39.670]  I know people that didn't get blown up,
[40:39.670 --> 40:43.190]  didn't get blown by aircraft jet blast
[40:43.190 --> 40:45.070]  like I did, for instance,
[40:45.070 --> 40:47.230]  but they went through other stuff
[40:47.310 --> 40:50.990]  that is traumatic, like it's trauma, you know?
[40:50.990 --> 40:54.510]  And whether it's a physical trauma.
[40:54.510 --> 40:56.230]  Absolutely, and like you said.
[40:56.230 --> 40:59.550]  Every person, I believe it's everybody.
[40:59.550 --> 41:02.070]  Even if you were a desk jockey somewhere, man,
[41:02.070 --> 41:04.310]  or you were just looking at the screen.
[41:05.670 --> 41:08.910]  Okay, I'm only saying this because I have female,
[41:08.910 --> 41:10.830]  I have daughters that are veterans.
[41:10.830 --> 41:13.870]  I just know what kind of harassment there was.
[41:13.870 --> 41:16.950]  I just understand that kind of nonsense.
[41:17.830 --> 41:19.190]  Again, I always tell my girls,
[41:19.190 --> 41:22.070]  you gotta whip your ass about the time they were about 16.
[41:22.070 --> 41:23.990]  You know, it's like, you wanna smart off to me, man,
[41:23.990 --> 41:26.230]  I'll pop you right in your jaws.
[41:26.230 --> 41:29.030]  And that's how, it's important, sister.
[41:29.030 --> 41:31.790]  It is, and I mean, no offense, Joanne,
[41:31.790 --> 41:34.790]  I call girls sister and boys brother.
[41:34.790 --> 41:37.910]  No, brother, I'm your sister, come on now.
[41:37.910 --> 41:39.910]  That none of us can see.
[41:40.790 --> 41:42.630]  So, I am your sister.
[41:42.630 --> 41:43.710]  I wanna get it out there.
[41:43.710 --> 41:45.750]  You know, we need to get this out there as a community.
[41:46.030 --> 41:48.030]  You're doing it, I know Cam's doing it,
[41:48.030 --> 41:49.950]  Colin's doing it every damn week, man.
[41:49.950 --> 41:53.710]  I see what Walk and Talk does all across the country,
[41:53.710 --> 41:55.310]  the tremendous things that he's doing,
[41:55.310 --> 41:58.070]  just reaching brothers and sisters in crisis
[41:58.070 --> 41:59.870]  and literally in the trenches.
[41:59.870 --> 42:02.350]  That's the part that I love about what Colin does so much.
[42:02.350 --> 42:04.830]  It isn't talking the talk, he is literally out there,
[42:04.830 --> 42:05.950]  seriously walking.
[42:05.950 --> 42:07.070]  Walking the walk.
[42:07.070 --> 42:09.150]  Yeah, I'm walking right behind him.
[42:09.950 --> 42:12.790]  He's definitely leading a lot of this.
[42:13.310 --> 42:14.350]  So.
[42:14.350 --> 42:17.830]  So, just quickly, Doc, I think you touched
[42:17.830 --> 42:19.950]  on a couple of things that I think are critical.
[42:19.950 --> 42:23.950]  I mean, one, you were kind of like learning on the fly
[42:23.950 --> 42:26.510]  about something you didn't even know about.
[42:26.510 --> 42:30.150]  Like, you know, I mean, I think you had an intuitive sense
[42:30.150 --> 42:33.870]  that this was a medicine, but then you started, you know,
[42:33.870 --> 42:37.030]  breeding with intent in certain directions towards,
[42:37.030 --> 42:40.270]  you know, easing your physical pain, your mental pain,
[42:40.270 --> 42:43.790]  you know, different chemotypes that maybe you started
[42:43.790 --> 42:47.390]  to realize, oh my God, like this super knock you out
[42:47.390 --> 42:51.750]  on the couch is great for X, but it's horrible for Y,
[42:51.750 --> 42:54.510]  and I'm gonna breed something else that's great for Y,
[42:54.510 --> 42:56.630]  but maybe not good for X.
[42:58.110 --> 42:59.950]  It's what I'm doing now, Peter.
[42:59.950 --> 43:01.750]  It's, I mean, it's my focus now.
[43:01.750 --> 43:03.590]  You know, I have more science behind it now,
[43:03.590 --> 43:05.550]  and I can actually, you know, I can go in and look
[43:05.550 --> 43:08.030]  at the structural makeup of it and go, okay,
[43:08.070 --> 43:12.670]  I'm looking for CBG or CBDV now,
[43:12.670 --> 43:16.070]  which is really what I'm frippin' looking for, okay?
[43:16.070 --> 43:17.590]  Honestly, what I'm looking for.
[43:17.590 --> 43:19.630]  So that's where this has gotten me.
[43:19.630 --> 43:23.310]  But back in the day, you didn't have that vocabulary
[43:23.310 --> 43:28.310]  of CBD, CBG, CBN, like whatever.
[43:28.350 --> 43:31.830]  And so it's kind of, it's interesting.
[43:31.830 --> 43:35.110]  Once you start to gain that vocabulary and meet people
[43:35.110 --> 43:39.510]  like Ethan Russo or Sue Sisley, and I feel like now
[43:39.510 --> 43:43.390]  we're fast forwarded in a moment where you're armed
[43:43.390 --> 43:47.870]  with kind of a team of scientists behind you
[43:47.870 --> 43:50.750]  who can articulate what you're,
[43:50.750 --> 43:53.110]  all of you are seeing anecdotally.
[43:53.110 --> 43:55.910]  I think that's the big thing here is, you know,
[43:55.910 --> 43:58.630]  pharmaceutical medicine is kind of top down.
[43:58.630 --> 44:02.190]  A company spends a billion dollars to get something approved
[44:02.190 --> 44:04.830]  for a specific disease or condition,
[44:05.510 --> 44:07.390]  whereas cannabis is kind of bottom up where you have,
[44:07.390 --> 44:11.310]  you know, thousands or tens of thousands of caregivers
[44:11.310 --> 44:15.750]  noticing things with themselves and their friends
[44:15.750 --> 44:19.390]  and initially not having a way to verbally articulate it.
[44:19.390 --> 44:22.190]  But I think now kind of the vocabulary is coming
[44:22.190 --> 44:27.190]  and can you and Cam just quickly touch on what happens
[44:29.150 --> 44:33.750]  when you cure flour for a longer period of time
[44:33.750 --> 44:36.670]  in terms of medicinal effects?
[44:36.670 --> 44:38.670]  Okay, sure.
[44:40.910 --> 44:43.190]  This is again, this goes back to what Peter
[44:43.190 --> 44:44.030]  just was talking about.
[44:44.030 --> 44:46.710]  This goes back to what, and something that I practice
[44:46.710 --> 44:49.030]  and I know Cam practices and most of us here
[44:49.030 --> 44:52.430]  in the triangle practice is craft, okay?
[44:52.430 --> 44:55.110]  What I realized a couple of years ago,
[44:55.110 --> 44:57.270]  and this is what we need to do as a community.
[44:57.270 --> 44:59.110]  And another thing we need to embrace sister
[44:59.110 --> 45:01.230]  and something that you can do and Colin can do
[45:01.230 --> 45:05.070]  is we can teach out that white dabs
[45:05.070 --> 45:09.430]  are not necessarily anything other than immature flowers.
[45:09.430 --> 45:10.990]  Okay?
[45:10.990 --> 45:15.990]  The rich full spectrum plants are amber in color,
[45:16.110 --> 45:18.830]  those that gold, browns, rich.
[45:20.070 --> 45:23.870]  And what I realized was, and I was talking to a mutual friend
[45:23.870 --> 45:25.270]  of Colin's in mind, because I asked him,
[45:25.270 --> 45:26.390]  what the hell, man?
[45:26.390 --> 45:28.470]  You know, where do I need to be if I'm gonna go
[45:28.470 --> 45:30.070]  into that market with my flowers?
[45:30.110 --> 45:31.870]  He wants full spectrum.
[45:31.870 --> 45:35.070]  And he's literally told me this word for word.
[45:35.070 --> 45:39.110]  And Colin, it was Blaze brother.
[45:39.110 --> 45:41.510]  I was talking to Blaze on the phone and he told me this.
[45:41.510 --> 45:44.870]  And he said that growers are harvesting anywhere
[45:44.870 --> 45:48.070]  from two, three, and even four weeks early
[45:48.070 --> 45:51.670]  to keep the pistils white and the trichomes white
[45:51.670 --> 45:54.190]  and creamy so that when they crush it and smash it
[45:54.190 --> 45:57.350]  and turn it into whatever the hell they're turning it into,
[45:57.350 --> 45:58.870]  it stays white and creamy.
[45:58.870 --> 46:01.550]  And hence the visual impression is, oh my God,
[46:01.550 --> 46:03.950]  it's so white and clean, it must be the best.
[46:03.950 --> 46:06.430]  That's like the farthest thing from the truth
[46:06.430 --> 46:10.430]  of the matter really is because when you get into like RSOs
[46:10.430 --> 46:14.150]  and FSOs and full spectrum concentrates,
[46:14.150 --> 46:17.670]  they're gold and rich and full and amber colors.
[46:17.670 --> 46:21.150]  And what Peter was alluding to,
[46:21.150 --> 46:23.710]  I believe is what he was alluding to is when I'm
[46:23.710 --> 46:27.590]  in the field watching that, I'm literally, okay,
[46:27.590 --> 46:31.630]  I'm taking 48 years of experience when I'm looking
[46:31.630 --> 46:33.630]  at my flowers in the field per se,
[46:33.630 --> 46:37.470]  but I have a lighted microscope and a jeweler's loop
[46:37.470 --> 46:39.790]  in my fricking pocket, man.
[46:39.790 --> 46:43.510]  I only leave so much to sheer instinct.
[46:43.510 --> 46:46.030]  I'm go back and even when I'm sure it's ripe,
[46:46.030 --> 46:48.950]  I still go back in and oscilloscope everything.
[46:48.950 --> 46:50.950]  I pop my little lighted microscope in there
[46:50.950 --> 46:52.990]  and look at the trichome heads and see,
[46:53.110 --> 46:56.590]  you know, am I 60 and me, okay, my rule of thumb,
[46:56.590 --> 47:01.590]  60 to 65%, 70% clear, 20 or so milky, 10% red and burn off.
[47:03.350 --> 47:06.150]  That's me as optimum, Cam.
[47:06.150 --> 47:09.070]  That's about identical to what we do as well.
[47:10.150 --> 47:13.430]  You know, so that, what Peter was talking about,
[47:13.430 --> 47:16.390]  full spectrum, you know, how do we know when it's optimum?
[47:16.390 --> 47:18.030]  That's what we go on.
[47:18.030 --> 47:22.190]  Most of the concentrate people that I've talked to,
[47:23.430 --> 47:24.630]  and I've talked to a couple of guys
[47:24.630 --> 47:25.910]  who are really good at their craft.
[47:25.910 --> 47:28.030]  You know, they have huge followings online.
[47:28.030 --> 47:30.630]  They produce lots and lots of material
[47:30.630 --> 47:31.470]  and they're really good at it.
[47:31.470 --> 47:33.550]  And that's what they're telling me is that clear stuff,
[47:33.550 --> 47:36.390]  that's the commercial stuff is being harvested
[47:36.390 --> 47:37.910]  way, way early.
[47:37.910 --> 47:40.030]  I think what we can do as a community
[47:40.030 --> 47:42.230]  and sister your platform and Colin,
[47:42.230 --> 47:44.670]  your platform brother is teach out that
[47:44.670 --> 47:46.670]  what full spectrum really looks like.
[47:46.670 --> 47:49.630]  You know, this is full spectrum, full term.
[47:49.630 --> 47:51.070]  Look how golden amber it is.
[47:51.070 --> 47:53.750]  Look how beautiful this patina is on this.
[47:53.750 --> 47:56.510]  You know, I have a sister that just sent me some of hers
[47:56.510 --> 47:58.430]  from the middle of the country over for me to look,
[47:58.430 --> 48:00.950]  take a look at, and it's brown as it can be.
[48:00.950 --> 48:02.790]  And it is just delicious.
[48:02.790 --> 48:05.030]  You know, it smokes like heaven.
[48:05.030 --> 48:08.750]  It is immediately just washes right over you, you know?
[48:08.750 --> 48:13.670]  And again, another warrior veteran female badass grower
[48:13.670 --> 48:15.790]  that I know that's a rock star, you know?
[48:15.790 --> 48:18.150]  And Sierra is just a fricking killing it, man.
[48:18.150 --> 48:19.630]  You know, and I love what she does.
[48:19.630 --> 48:21.990]  And that's just, that's again, her,
[48:21.990 --> 48:24.510]  what she teaches out and what I teach out and Cam
[48:24.510 --> 48:27.510]  and I'm assuming you are sister and brother,
[48:27.510 --> 48:29.630]  Colin, I assume you are as well, you know,
[48:29.630 --> 48:33.510]  about whole plant medicine and really what,
[48:33.510 --> 48:37.110]  where it is for me personally is that's my main thread
[48:37.110 --> 48:41.790]  of trying to grow full term, full spectrum
[48:41.790 --> 48:44.550]  that has is rich in everything across the board,
[48:44.550 --> 48:46.030]  maybe high in some areas,
[48:46.030 --> 48:47.830]  but rich in everything across the board,
[48:47.830 --> 48:50.350]  because that what I believe is the closest way
[48:50.350 --> 48:53.190]  to heal ourselves naturally with it.
[48:53.190 --> 48:55.950]  And Joanne, you said something
[48:55.950 --> 48:57.510]  and Cam said something both about it,
[48:57.510 --> 48:59.710]  about the, you know, we have cannabinoid receptors
[48:59.710 --> 49:01.110]  in our bodies, you know, it's like,
[49:01.110 --> 49:03.510]  we're wired for this stuff to think
[49:03.510 --> 49:05.190]  that it's not supposed to be in our system.
[49:05.190 --> 49:06.830]  It's just quite honestly ridiculous
[49:06.830 --> 49:10.710]  in today's scientific community, medical community,
[49:10.710 --> 49:13.750]  you know, back in, Peter, you said it earlier,
[49:13.750 --> 49:15.790]  you know, back in the seventies and eighties, man,
[49:15.790 --> 49:18.630]  we were outlaw, you know, we were underground.
[49:18.630 --> 49:20.150]  Nobody knew who the hell we were.
[49:20.150 --> 49:21.670]  We only knew who each other were.
[49:21.670 --> 49:23.270]  We didn't put our names on stuff.
[49:23.270 --> 49:25.950]  We didn't advertise what we were growing.
[49:25.950 --> 49:27.670]  You know, you advertise what you were growing
[49:27.670 --> 49:29.030]  and you went to prison, you know,
[49:29.030 --> 49:30.510]  and that's just the truth of the matter.
[49:30.510 --> 49:31.910]  You know, it's even happens now.
[49:31.910 --> 49:33.950]  There's still red states in our union
[49:33.950 --> 49:35.630]  that if they advertise what they're doing,
[49:35.630 --> 49:37.110]  they go to prison over it.
[49:38.110 --> 49:38.950]  You know, and it's like,
[49:38.950 --> 49:42.150]  we're fortunate to be in the state of California.
[49:42.230 --> 49:46.430]  Why would, like right now,
[49:46.430 --> 49:49.790]  why do you think people are using the white stuff
[49:49.790 --> 49:54.510]  as opposed to letting it get the right color ratio
[49:54.510 --> 49:56.630]  that you were speaking about?
[49:56.630 --> 50:00.750]  Because I feel like the lighter color
[50:00.750 --> 50:02.670]  is what I predominantly see,
[50:02.670 --> 50:06.710]  especially like in the legal markets actually.
[50:06.710 --> 50:09.590]  Again, that is the commercial legal market.
[50:09.910 --> 50:12.150]  It's not crap what craft people do.
[50:13.830 --> 50:16.630]  It's harvested earlier and to answer his question,
[50:16.630 --> 50:18.430]  and you said it too already, Joy,
[50:18.430 --> 50:20.150]  you already said it sister, greed.
[50:21.110 --> 50:21.950]  Greed.
[50:21.950 --> 50:22.790]  And also lack of education too.
[50:22.790 --> 50:25.190]  You can do it quicker.
[50:25.190 --> 50:27.870]  You can turn more volume over in the same 12 months.
[50:27.870 --> 50:30.510]  You know, the same 12 months that Cam and I would work in
[50:30.510 --> 50:33.030]  where we would try and do maybe three or four harvests
[50:33.030 --> 50:36.150]  just using the sun and maybe a little light augmentation,
[50:36.150 --> 50:39.630]  doing a light dip outside and what we do,
[50:39.630 --> 50:41.830]  okay, three or four times maybe in a year.
[50:41.830 --> 50:44.550]  Commercially, every six weeks,
[50:44.550 --> 50:47.070]  they're trying to get six, seven harvests in a year
[50:47.070 --> 50:48.990]  because again, it's about greed
[50:48.990 --> 50:51.270]  and not about the quality of the flower.
[50:51.270 --> 50:55.030]  And sadly, I believe, now I'm not 100% sure
[50:55.030 --> 50:58.590]  and I'm only going on by guys that practice the craft.
[50:58.590 --> 50:59.670]  I'm a flower guy.
[50:59.670 --> 51:01.510]  I'm not an extraction whiz.
[51:02.230 --> 51:04.470]  The guy that I have connections to
[51:04.470 --> 51:08.270]  is a great extraction guy that I ask information from
[51:08.270 --> 51:10.110]  and that's what he's telling me is,
[51:11.430 --> 51:15.550]  quicker harvest, quicker return, less time in the ground,
[51:15.550 --> 51:16.950]  more, more, more, more, more,
[51:16.950 --> 51:19.390]  cheaper, cheaper, cheaper, cheaper.
[51:19.390 --> 51:20.550]  And we have that.
[51:20.550 --> 51:21.710]  I mean, we really have that.
[51:21.710 --> 51:24.470]  We have that market that they're $10 a gram,
[51:24.470 --> 51:26.310]  they don't give a damn what it is.
[51:26.310 --> 51:27.950]  They just wanna get high.
[51:27.950 --> 51:29.350]  That's not my thread.
[51:29.390 --> 51:30.870]  That's not really Cam's thread.
[51:30.870 --> 51:33.310]  I don't think it's you guys having to do a thread either.
[51:33.310 --> 51:35.070]  I get that that's out there,
[51:35.070 --> 51:36.510]  but I believe what you said,
[51:36.510 --> 51:39.190]  what we need to do is we need to teach
[51:39.190 --> 51:42.030]  that that's not necessarily the best.
[51:42.030 --> 51:42.870]  That it's-
[51:42.870 --> 51:44.550]  Well, and we can also say best,
[51:44.550 --> 51:46.350]  but we can also say different
[51:46.350 --> 51:49.150]  because when we look at the differences of those,
[51:49.150 --> 51:50.910]  you also have the people who insist
[51:50.910 --> 51:54.390]  that you have to have flower that's over 20% THC.
[51:54.390 --> 51:56.550]  And all of the research and all of us know
[51:56.550 --> 51:58.510]  that use cannabis on a regular basis.
[51:58.550 --> 52:03.550]  That some of the greatest strains are seven to 15% THC.
[52:03.870 --> 52:05.950]  And so we're having to educate people
[52:05.950 --> 52:09.910]  that more THC is not the end all be all of the product.
[52:09.910 --> 52:11.830]  And so this comes back
[52:11.830 --> 52:14.110]  to where you were talking about full spectrum.
[52:14.110 --> 52:16.510]  We have to define these terms for ourselves
[52:16.510 --> 52:19.310]  before other people define them
[52:19.310 --> 52:22.030]  that have no business talking about it
[52:22.030 --> 52:23.550]  because they don't have the experience in it.
[52:23.550 --> 52:26.670]  So are we talking full spectrum of an industrial hemp?
[52:26.710 --> 52:29.950]  Are we talking full spectrum of an indoor grown clone
[52:29.950 --> 52:31.630]  that's harvested at a specific time?
[52:31.630 --> 52:33.550]  Are we talking about the full spectrum
[52:33.550 --> 52:35.030]  of a beautiful cannabis plant
[52:35.030 --> 52:37.750]  that was grown in full sun and full soil
[52:37.750 --> 52:40.910]  and allowed to go to the full term of its life expectancy,
[52:40.910 --> 52:42.390]  being buffeted by the wind
[52:42.390 --> 52:45.350]  and being predated on by bugs and deer
[52:45.350 --> 52:47.750]  so that they respond and produce more cannabinoids
[52:47.750 --> 52:48.990]  and more terpenes.
[52:48.990 --> 52:50.550]  There's all different levels.
[52:50.550 --> 52:52.270]  And so we have to start coming up
[52:52.270 --> 52:54.670]  with standardized definitions of these.
[52:54.670 --> 52:57.110]  So people can understand what we're talking about.
[52:57.110 --> 52:58.910]  And when you spend all that time outdoors
[52:58.910 --> 53:00.350]  making these beautiful plants
[53:00.350 --> 53:03.870]  that the most robust broad spectrum that you can,
[53:03.870 --> 53:06.950]  the better that you take care of them post-harvest
[53:06.950 --> 53:10.350]  that once you harvest them, that's the halfway mark.
[53:10.350 --> 53:12.550]  Now you've got to start working on curing
[53:12.550 --> 53:15.470]  and making sure that you stabilize all those cannabinoids
[53:15.470 --> 53:16.310]  and all those terpenes
[53:16.310 --> 53:19.390]  that you allow them to develop to their full potential
[53:19.390 --> 53:21.190]  while degrading the things in the plant
[53:21.190 --> 53:22.990]  that we don't want like the chlorophyll
[53:23.150 --> 53:26.350]  So Doc and I both do super long, slow cures
[53:26.350 --> 53:29.910]  where we leave the flower untrimmed on the stick for months
[53:29.910 --> 53:32.630]  in a dark space that is climate controlled,
[53:32.630 --> 53:35.070]  humidity, temperature, airflow.
[53:35.070 --> 53:36.990]  And I don't like to trim them first.
[53:36.990 --> 53:38.910]  I want all of those small sugar leaves
[53:38.910 --> 53:42.030]  to cover the trichomes and protect them like a cocoon
[53:42.030 --> 53:43.350]  and let them develop.
[53:43.350 --> 53:47.670]  And it's like a fine wine or a fine tequila.
[53:47.670 --> 53:49.070]  Talking about the colors,
[53:49.070 --> 53:51.550]  a Blanco tequila is a fine wine
[53:51.630 --> 53:54.390]  a Blanco tequila is an unaged tequila.
[53:54.390 --> 53:58.150]  It's raw, it's fresh, it's young, it's hoven.
[53:58.150 --> 54:01.150]  But as you age the tequila, just like the cannabis,
[54:01.150 --> 54:03.390]  it's going to develop more rich colors
[54:03.390 --> 54:06.470]  and you're going to get a reposado or a Nejo style.
[54:06.470 --> 54:09.430]  And the more that you allow the cannabis to cure,
[54:09.430 --> 54:11.310]  the more it's going to develop into new things.
[54:11.310 --> 54:14.710]  We're even discovering a new thing called hashashin,
[54:14.710 --> 54:18.430]  which is prevalent in a lot of handmade temple ball,
[54:18.430 --> 54:19.950]  hashes or sharas.
[54:19.950 --> 54:23.830]  When you seal that hash in, it still ages and converts.
[54:23.830 --> 54:26.750]  I have flower, I'm still smoking my pre-rolls
[54:26.750 --> 54:28.670]  from three years ago that are developed
[54:28.670 --> 54:32.470]  and they've just become so much more robust.
[54:32.470 --> 54:34.470]  But all of these parts of the plant,
[54:34.470 --> 54:36.310]  there's better things for better people.
[54:36.310 --> 54:40.990]  Somebody might need that blonde rosin
[54:40.990 --> 54:44.270]  that's got a lot of THCA or CBDA or CBGA,
[54:44.270 --> 54:46.270]  the precursor acidic cannabinoids.
[54:46.270 --> 54:48.070]  And then a lot of other people are going to need
[54:48.070 --> 54:51.270]  a more robust profile that has a lot more things in it.
[54:51.270 --> 54:52.870]  Because our endocannabinoid systems
[54:52.870 --> 54:54.510]  are extremely individual.
[54:54.510 --> 54:58.110]  There's what works for one of us won't work for another.
[54:58.110 --> 55:00.670]  And so we just need to make sure
[55:00.670 --> 55:02.790]  that everything that's going into the market
[55:02.790 --> 55:07.150]  is clean and tested and won't cause harm.
[55:09.710 --> 55:11.510]  So yeah, as someone who spends a lot of time
[55:11.510 --> 55:13.270]  testing different things that can heal,
[55:13.270 --> 55:16.310]  because I'm a self-rehabilitated veteran,
[55:16.310 --> 55:18.950]  I wear that badge of honor proudly.
[55:18.950 --> 55:22.910]  And with cannabis in particular,
[55:22.910 --> 55:25.550]  and I don't want to get too into the weeds with it,
[55:25.550 --> 55:27.710]  but you guys are hitting it on the head
[55:27.710 --> 55:29.670]  in such an important topic.
[55:29.670 --> 55:32.910]  Because for me, for four years,
[55:32.910 --> 55:36.670]  I have been trying craft cannabis to dispensary cannabis
[55:36.670 --> 55:38.510]  and everything in between.
[55:38.510 --> 55:40.950]  And I can tell you wholeheartedly now
[55:40.950 --> 55:44.390]  that the past month, every time I dab
[55:44.390 --> 55:47.590]  or take a bong load of a high THC cannabis,
[55:47.590 --> 55:50.670]  every issue I have is worse.
[55:50.670 --> 55:55.670]  My pain, my depression, my anger, my sadness,
[55:55.870 --> 55:57.150]  all is compounded.
[55:57.150 --> 55:59.270]  And through my own personal research,
[55:59.270 --> 56:01.630]  which I like to do on my own,
[56:01.630 --> 56:05.910]  I have come to find that people with a proclivity
[56:05.910 --> 56:09.230]  to traumatic brain injury in their past,
[56:09.230 --> 56:12.990]  with PTSD, with brain injuries specifically,
[56:13.030 --> 56:16.390]  the dopamine levels affected by THC
[56:16.390 --> 56:21.390]  can ultimately hinder your own body's ability to make this.
[56:22.270 --> 56:25.350]  So what you're doing is you're spiking in and out.
[56:25.350 --> 56:26.790]  And when you take that bong load,
[56:26.790 --> 56:28.950]  you may feel a little bit of relief at first,
[56:28.950 --> 56:30.990]  but four or five hours later,
[56:30.990 --> 56:34.270]  your body is not producing the same levels of dopamine.
[56:34.270 --> 56:35.390]  So then you're crashing.
[56:35.390 --> 56:37.110]  And this was happening to me.
[56:37.110 --> 56:38.670]  And that's why I'm off THC.
[56:38.670 --> 56:41.030]  And I'm specifically just taking oils
[56:41.030 --> 56:45.310]  like Fiddleose Greens, THCA, acidic THC now.
[56:45.310 --> 56:49.310]  And it has like overnight, I felt better, overnight.
[56:49.310 --> 56:52.030]  And so it is scary to me.
[56:52.030 --> 56:54.070]  And the problem with that is,
[56:54.070 --> 56:57.190]  and I come from the cannabis compassionate world,
[56:57.190 --> 57:02.190]  is that I have over 200 active members
[57:02.350 --> 57:04.390]  of Veterans Walk and Talk throughout the nation
[57:04.390 --> 57:09.390]  who for one reason or another need cannabis to survive.
[57:09.390 --> 57:11.910]  And when you are facing them
[57:11.910 --> 57:13.390]  and they're coming to your hikes,
[57:13.390 --> 57:16.550]  and I have to try to provide for them
[57:16.550 --> 57:19.790]  on a weekly basis when we're really active.
[57:19.790 --> 57:21.590]  And all three of you have hiked with us
[57:21.590 --> 57:24.550]  and all three of you have donated to Veterans Walk and Talk.
[57:24.550 --> 57:27.430]  And so you know the need is great.
[57:27.430 --> 57:32.430]  What has happened now between the beauty and the elegance
[57:33.030 --> 57:35.230]  of what Doc Ray and Cam do,
[57:36.150 --> 57:39.150]  between that and dispensaries,
[57:39.150 --> 57:42.550]  it has gotten completely convoluted with greed.
[57:42.550 --> 57:47.550]  And what happens is you get 39% cannabinoids on the label
[57:49.430 --> 57:52.390]  when that means nothing to the average consumer.
[57:52.390 --> 57:55.670]  And then you get up people like myself
[57:56.510 --> 57:59.710]  who take the time to try every last product
[57:59.710 --> 58:01.150]  that they can possibly find.
[58:01.150 --> 58:03.670]  Because if you're putting it out in the cannabis space,
[58:03.670 --> 58:04.830]  I wanna know about it.
[58:05.790 --> 58:08.030]  And I can tell you firsthand,
[58:08.030 --> 58:13.030]  the medicinal side of cannabis has been completely convoluted
[58:13.110 --> 58:14.870]  by the recreational side.
[58:14.870 --> 58:19.070]  It has set us back decades to be honest.
[58:20.510 --> 58:22.990]  There's so much inequality,
[58:22.990 --> 58:26.270]  there's so much back and forth bullshit
[58:26.270 --> 58:30.310]  with the research and the denying of the research
[58:30.310 --> 58:31.750]  that goes on in cannabis.
[58:31.790 --> 58:33.270]  And we know this plant works
[58:33.270 --> 58:36.470]  and we know it needs to be made accessible.
[58:36.470 --> 58:40.070]  So you guys being the pioneers of this
[58:40.070 --> 58:44.350]  and empowering people to grow on their own is imperative
[58:45.510 --> 58:47.030]  because the need is so great.
[58:47.030 --> 58:50.230]  I can't turn away high THC products if I'm getting them.
[58:50.230 --> 58:52.830]  I can't be like this won't help my people.
[58:53.910 --> 58:55.150]  I'm just not at that point
[58:55.150 --> 58:59.350]  because cannabis is the great unifier
[58:59.350 --> 59:03.070]  and it is also in many ways for what I do
[59:03.070 --> 59:04.950]  for Veterans Walk and Talk,
[59:04.950 --> 59:08.350]  it is the healing basic basis of what we do,
[59:08.350 --> 59:12.470]  but it's also in a lot of ways, it's bait.
[59:12.470 --> 59:15.990]  And it's a way to get veterans to learn
[59:15.990 --> 59:19.470]  that this is something that they can try,
[59:19.470 --> 59:22.070]  but also get them to the group and the community
[59:22.070 --> 59:26.190]  because as I've said many times, cannabis is community.
[59:26.190 --> 59:30.950]  And whether you're consuming it properly or not,
[59:30.950 --> 59:33.150]  you're getting medicinal value from it.
[59:33.150 --> 59:36.590]  All cannabis use is medicinal, all cannabis use is medicinal,
[59:36.590 --> 59:38.990]  all cannabis use is medicinal.
[59:38.990 --> 59:42.550]  So it's like saying basketball isn't medicinal.
[59:42.550 --> 59:44.230]  Yes, it's a recreational sport.
[59:44.230 --> 59:45.670]  You have fun when you play it.
[59:45.670 --> 59:48.470]  It doesn't mean it's not a good thing for your body.
[59:48.470 --> 59:52.710]  So what I tell veterans and you guys,
[59:52.710 --> 59:55.790]  thank you for all your praise about Veterans Walk and Talk.
[59:56.590 --> 59:59.430]  I have seen firsthand all three of you,
[59:59.430 --> 01:00:02.070]  Cam you hiked with us in Malibu, I think it was,
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:05.150]  or you came and sponsored an event in Malibu we did
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.710]  and Doc you hiked Bridge to Nowhere
[01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.870]  and Joanne and I have been working hand in hand together
[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.990]  for many months now and have big plans.
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:17.870]  I have never seen anything like it.
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:23.310]  It brings people to a place of comfort within themselves.
[01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:27.710]  It brings people to a place where they can face
[01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:32.190]  like Doc did and say things that whether or not
[01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.630]  we are sitting around in a table,
[01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.990]  physically smoking together,
[01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:38.030]  cannabis is what brought us all to this place right now
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.310]  and empowered Doc to share that for the very first time.
[01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.390]  And those are the types of,
[01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:46.830]  that's as powerful as it gets with cannabis.
[01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:49.750]  My role in cannabis is compassion.
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.070]  I want to advocate for the plant
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.630]  the way the plant advocates for me.
[01:00:55.630 --> 01:01:00.630]  And which is why I'm so honored to be on a panel
[01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.270]  with you guys who are,
[01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:05.750]  cause I know Cam and Doc specifically
[01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:07.710]  and you guys can touch on this later,
[01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:11.070]  but getting an heirloom of province,
[01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:14.230]  the origin established in Humboldt
[01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.750]  is something that I'm very passionate about.
[01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.750]  And I know you guys are talking about it
[01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.790]  you guys have talked about this with me before.
[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:26.070]  And with Veterans Walk and Talk in particular,
[01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:31.470]  it's gotten to the point where if you're a veteran
[01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.670]  and you're not taking control of your own health,
[01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:36.870]  then you're gonna fall under the VA.
[01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:41.870]  And the VA for me, I am a 100% disabled combat veteran.
[01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.390]  I broke my moral code for this country.
[01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.710]  I hurt people for this country.
[01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:51.910]  I watched my brothers get hurt for this country.
[01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:56.710]  And the fact that we have to come back
[01:01:56.710 --> 01:02:00.350]  and take our own health into our hands
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.230]  is terrifying for many and hard.
[01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:09.230]  I'm having a baby with my beautiful girlfriend, Cookie,
[01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:12.070]  who is a Navy veteran and worked with NATO
[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.350]  and served as proudly as anybody.
[01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.630]  We are both covered by the VA.
[01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.790]  We are both unwilling to have our baby there.
[01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.870]  So we pay for private insurance,
[01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:25.190]  even though it would be completely covered
[01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:26.470]  under the VA system.
[01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:30.190]  If that doesn't tell you everything you know about the VA,
[01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:31.390]  I don't know what does.
[01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:35.550]  Because literally, I mean, we're spending,
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:37.590]  yes, am I spending disability money
[01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.030]  that's coming from the VA to get service outside of the VA?
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.310]  Yeah, I am.
[01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.110]  I'm using their money so I can get better care
[01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:46.870]  that they don't offer.
[01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:48.390]  That is so wrong.
[01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.030]  It is wrong on every level.
[01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:54.270]  The VA's motto is defining excellence.
[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.270]  They have done nothing of the sort.
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:02.430]  I lived at the VA for 11 months on the campus grounds
[01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:04.190]  when I got back from Afghanistan.
[01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:08.990]  I tried, I tried to do it their way.
[01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:11.910]  I gave it as honest an effort
[01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.270]  as anybody that I have ever met.
[01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.470]  In fact, I barely rarely meet people
[01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:19.870]  that lived at the VA for more than six months.
[01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.310]  11 months is like unheard of.
[01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.950]  My 11 month tenure at the VA ended with me in a padded cell.
[01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.910]  At 11 months, after all the healing I did,
[01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:32.070]  all the effort, one argument with my roommate
[01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:35.390]  and I'm in a padded cell being shot without a van.
[01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:38.550]  All of that out the window, gone, out on the street.
[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.510]  My stuff waiting for me when I got back to the dormitory,
[01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:46.070]  on the street, I was escorted by VA police officers.
[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.150]  This was after being on a board of directors
[01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:51.070]  for the VA domiciliary in West LA VA.
[01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.590]  I mean, I gave it an honest effort.
[01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.990]  I took methadone.
[01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:57.230]  I took, well, Butrin.
[01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:58.990]  I took everything that they would throw at me
[01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:00.550]  just so I could be in my father's life
[01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:03.230]  and be a good veteran.
[01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:04.430]  And none of it worked.
[01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:08.830]  Cannabis, cannabis, coming to it like I did
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.510]  is what saved my life.
[01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:13.870]  So Veterans Walk and Talk's mission is simple.
[01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:17.510]  We walk, we talk, we talk about whatever comes to our minds.
[01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:20.190]  Cannabis usually being at the forefront of that.
[01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:25.190]  Now, mushrooms have been an amazing healing component
[01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:26.790]  for veterans.
[01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.870]  We use it almost on every hike now.
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.710]  There are several veterans that are partaking
[01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:36.990]  in some form of mushroom therapy
[01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:39.310]  or at least learning about it.
[01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.590]  Veterans Walk and Talk has grown to be much more
[01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:45.310]  than just a group of hiking individuals, as you all know.
[01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:48.070]  Like we advocate, we grow,
[01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:52.230]  we are just social justice warriors.
[01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.430]  We are at the forefront of knocking down
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:58.150]  the fascist regime that's taking over our country.
[01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:00.790]  We are just doing all the good work.
[01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:02.870]  So I hope I didn't rant too much,
[01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.510]  but that's my piece for this.
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:06.750]  And I'm just very grateful you guys are touching
[01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.750]  on everything you're saying.
[01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.030]  So thank you.
[01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:11.510]  I think that's critically important.
[01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:16.030]  Like I want each of you to kind of give concrete
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:18.110]  and you just did it kind of,
[01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:20.270]  here's my personal journey.
[01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:24.830]  And like, I think one thing you just mentioned
[01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:29.830]  was kind of, you come back to the US
[01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.910]  and you're kind of pushed into the VA system
[01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:37.150]  and the current state of the VA system.
[01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.430]  I'd like you guys to touch a little more on that.
[01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:43.830]  And is it changing?
[01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.990]  Is it stuck in some time warp
[01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:50.710]  that you just don't have any hope medium term for?
[01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.110]  And then for each of you,
[01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:57.110]  it's kind of like you took control of your own destiny.
[01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:00.550]  And one thing Colin, you just mentioned was like,
[01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:06.910]  someone goes into a dispensary and buys the designer
[01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:11.510]  cultivar du jour and they smoke it
[01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.630]  and they have a paranoid freak out.
[01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.870]  And maybe they never want to touch it again.
[01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:19.950]  And you're like, oh my God, that was an opportunity lost
[01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:23.110]  because had that person tried something
[01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:27.950]  that is right for them, they'd start healing
[01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.670]  and they'd find something that helps.
[01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:35.670]  And instead they had this anxiety ridden experience
[01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:38.990]  which you seem to have.
[01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:41.590]  So can each of you kind of, and Colin,
[01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:42.950]  you just did a little bit,
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:45.230]  but if you want to expand on it or Joanne,
[01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:49.630]  you want to talk kind of like what you started with,
[01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.270]  what you noticed, what you realized works with you.
[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.750]  And then that's your personal experience.
[01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.470]  And then each of you has experience with at least 10, 20,
[01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:02.030]  30, 50 friends who are veterans and kind of just be specific
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:06.430]  talk about my friend, Billy, like he,
[01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:09.150]  this was his journey and this is what we learned
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.110]  on his behalf along the way.
[01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.710]  Yeah, I mean, I-
[01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:17.870]  Cause these anecdotal stories, I mean,
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.790]  these are real stories of real people and what works,
[01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:21.710]  what doesn't work.
[01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.790]  And it's important for people to,
[01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.990]  or basically for us to document wins and losses.
[01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.910]  Right.
[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.550]  I will start if that's okay,
[01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.870]  because I've been doing veterans walk and talk
[01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:35.990]  since late 2016 for four years.
[01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.390]  For the first few years,
[01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.870]  I was still struggling with a lot of issues
[01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.710]  and finding my way in many ways.
[01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.790]  And then veterans walk and talk and myself,
[01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:49.190]  we really made a name for ourselves by driving to the VA
[01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.310]  and saying, I don't give a fuck what you think
[01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.150]  about cannabis.
[01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:54.430]  I'm picking your people up and taking them hiking
[01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.590]  and I'm going to get them high.
[01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:56.590]  And if you kick them out,
[01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:59.710]  I will be at the door waiting for them to give them a house.
[01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.550]  If you make them-
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:03.910]  And this was at the West LA VA?
[01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.310]  West LA VA, the Chatsworth VA,
[01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.510]  I picked up veterans and also at several,
[01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:11.630]  the VA outsources like crazy.
[01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:16.630]  So several, you call them shelters in downtown LA
[01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:20.110]  that I would pick up homeless veterans
[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:21.630]  and take them hiking, yes.
[01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:25.910]  And they, I can tell you, with a few exceptions,
[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.710]  I've lost to suicide, some of them.
[01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:34.110]  I've lost to further homelessness and drug addiction,
[01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:37.430]  which anybody in this profession,
[01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:40.870]  it's just, you can't, there's 22 veterans a day dying,
[01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:42.270]  you're going to lose some.
[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.470]  And that's why we put ourselves out there.
[01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:48.430]  But the ones that continued to hike
[01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:52.670]  and continued to garner what cannabis had to offer,
[01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:54.190]  I am still in touch with them.
[01:08:54.190 --> 01:08:57.550]  They're usually back at home with their families.
[01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:00.510]  They are working in the cannabis space now,
[01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:03.070]  lifted up by it in many ways,
[01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:05.670]  whether it be security or cultivating the plant,
[01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:08.830]  growing it on farms where they can seclude themselves,
[01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:10.710]  but they don't actually have to buy the land
[01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:14.430]  as Doc Ray was afforded to do and did many, many years ago.
[01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.470]  And it's what I want to do as well.
[01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:21.470]  So the healing, like I have 200 members
[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:25.150]  of Veterans Walk and Talk.
[01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:28.390]  If I were to put out an email questionnaire to them saying,
[01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:31.070]  what healed you better, the VA or cannabis,
[01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:33.230]  the results, I don't even need to do it.
[01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:34.910]  I know what the results are.
[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:37.910]  The VA has dropped the ball.
[01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:42.910]  Now it's seems a little bit like it's getting better.
[01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:47.230]  You can talk about cannabis and maybe I'd love to hear Joanne
[01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:49.390]  talk about what she discusses
[01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:53.470]  with your medical professional, because I keep it very,
[01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.710]  I use plant medicine, plant medicine, plant medicine.
[01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:59.430]  That's what I discuss, but I have a permanent disability.
[01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.510]  So I don't have to, I don't have to,
[01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:03.350]  I could say whatever I want to them basically,
[01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:04.550]  as long as I'm not hurting people
[01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:06.190]  with the money they're giving me.
[01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.310]  But for others, it's terrifying to bring up cannabis use.
[01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:13.550]  It's terrifying to talk about mushroom use.
[01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:19.590]  We're having a baby, cannabis, it's nausea, come on.
[01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:23.190]  I mean, morning sickness, it's night and day.
[01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.790]  If you take some cannabis, you don't throw up.
[01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:28.270]  You don't take cannabis, you throw up.
[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:30.510]  I just, I don't need more evidence than that.
[01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:34.350]  And that's, so the VA dropping the ball,
[01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:37.110]  an excellent book is the ex-VA secretary,
[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:38.790]  David Shulkin's book,
[01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:40.670]  It Shouldn't Be This Hard to Serve Your Country.
[01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.670]  He lays it out as well as anybody,
[01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:48.030]  just explaining how he tried to fix it from the internal
[01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:50.430]  and how it's just, it's America,
[01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.670]  we got to just admit that some things didn't work
[01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:56.150]  and we have to revamp them from the ground up, basically.
[01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:58.270]  And I'd love to hear from Joanne more.
[01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.670]  What, just before Joanne starts, can you talk about,
[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.350]  I mean, you're showing up unannounced at a VA facility
[01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:09.910]  and pulling people to go hang out and smoke weed.
[01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:14.790]  Like, were there bureaucratic administrators at the VA
[01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:16.030]  who were supportive,
[01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.190]  others who thought you were doing the devil's work?
[01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:22.230]  Like, did they bring the MPs in
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.390]  to escort you off the facility?
[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:29.390]  Like, what were some of the interactions with the VA staff?
[01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:32.630]  Yeah, thank you very much for asking that question.
[01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:34.070]  I really appreciate that.
[01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:40.070]  Yeah, I ran into the craziest of scenarios,
[01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.510]  picking a veterans up at the VA,
[01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.630]  which is a large reason why I can't do it anymore.
[01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:50.630]  And what was happening was my members were being searched
[01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:54.390]  at a higher rate in their rooms.
[01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:59.750]  The VWAT members were being harassed.
[01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:02.070]  They were being denied certain things.
[01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:06.550]  They were being given unfair curfews that,
[01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.070]  you have to understand the places
[01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.550]  that I was picking veterans up,
[01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.470]  they have to qualify for.
[01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:17.510]  For instance, when I lived at the domiciliary
[01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:19.550]  in the West LA VA,
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.910]  I lived on both the substance abuse track
[01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:24.550]  and the combat trauma treatment track.
[01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.150]  I was a homeless drug addicted veteran,
[01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:30.470]  but you have to interview for a spot.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.750]  You have to qualify.
[01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:36.070]  You have to show that you have the initiative to heal
[01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:37.550]  or whatever the hell that means.
[01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.870]  And they turn people away.
[01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:43.110]  And so if you admit to cannabis use,
[01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.590]  you will just simply not get a bed.
[01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:50.350]  And so, yeah, they were being searched and fucked with.
[01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:54.950]  And I had to take into consideration
[01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.670]  that I am not a medical professional.
[01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:57.630]  I'm not a doctor.
[01:12:57.630 --> 01:12:59.030]  I'm not a licensed counselor.
[01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:02.630]  I don't have the protections that the VA has in place.
[01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:06.670]  So what I was running into was my most severe cases,
[01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.870]  my most severe brothers and sisters
[01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:10.750]  who I was picking up at the VA,
[01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.510]  I had to listen to what they were saying,
[01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:15.950]  but I also had to take into consideration
[01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:19.950]  that they were there for sometimes paranoid schizophrenia,
[01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.870]  for sometimes delusional thoughts.
[01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:26.070]  These are, and again, I had delusional thoughts.
[01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:27.510]  I still have delusional thoughts,
[01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:31.670]  but I shouldn't be hospitalized over them.
[01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:32.710]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.110]  So when these veterans were telling me
[01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.270]  that their heat was being turned off in their room,
[01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:40.710]  which they were paying for out of their own disability,
[01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:43.750]  or that the water, and I have video,
[01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:47.830]  the water is brown running out of their bathtub constantly,
[01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:51.310]  and they're the only room on the floor that has this issue,
[01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:53.110]  you have to wonder, is it related?
[01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.430]  Is it related to the fact that these veterans
[01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.790]  aren't falling into line
[01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:59.190]  with what the VA is prescribing them?
[01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.590]  And again, these are veterans
[01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.430]  who didn't live in a treatment program like I did.
[01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:06.630]  I would never have been able to walk with veterans,
[01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:09.270]  walk and talk living in the treatment program I lived in.
[01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.190]  Not a chance.
[01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.830]  I would have been kicked out immediately.
[01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:16.470]  The veterans I was picking up were paying to rent a place
[01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:19.710]  on the VA grounds that was leased to them.
[01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:24.030]  So the VA would lease the building on the VA grounds
[01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:25.910]  to a company like Salvation Army
[01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:28.350]  or the Disabled American Veterans Association
[01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:29.870]  or IAVA or any of these,
[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.150]  and then they would in turn rent it back to the VA.
[01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:36.390]  And then, and so you don't even know,
[01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:37.950]  you're in one building one second,
[01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:39.270]  you're in a private institution,
[01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:40.670]  you're in another building the next second,
[01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:42.150]  you're falling under VA rule.
[01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:46.870]  So there's really just no clear cut.
[01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:50.470]  Like for me, why is it that veterans
[01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:53.390]  aren't given this alternative six months
[01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:55.390]  into before leaving the military?
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.470]  Why is veterans walk and talk not,
[01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:00.750]  hey, you're leaving the military in six months.
[01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:04.110]  In order to qualify for the medical marijuana,
[01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:06.310]  the cannabis that we wanna give you,
[01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:09.470]  you have to go or we suggest you go
[01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.590]  walk with veterans walk and talk.
[01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:14.750]  You're in a wheelchair, you're a paralyzed veteran.
[01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:17.470]  So we will suggest that you instead
[01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.750]  go do veterans art and talk, go paint.
[01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.910]  If you do this, you will be given cannabis while you do it.
[01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:27.070]  Then slowly you will be released as you go.
[01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.910]  But just giving veterans cannabis,
[01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:34.390]  veterans more medicine, that's not gonna work.
[01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:38.670]  Alternative therapies, a new lease on life
[01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:40.430]  is what cannabis gives you.
[01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:43.630]  And we need to shepherd that in every way.
[01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:47.830]  And there's no reason why alcoholism,
[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.950]  drug addiction, depression, PTSD,
[01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:53.070]  there's no reason why all these things
[01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:56.230]  we have to knock out before we come to cannabis.
[01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:58.310]  Cannabis should be the first thing.
[01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.390]  And then we tackle these things.
[01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:03.670]  So that's what veterans walk and talk stigma
[01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:05.750]  is trying to break the stigma of.
[01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:09.590]  I'm denied, I can't see my son that lives in North Carolina.
[01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:13.110]  I have two step sons and a daughter on the way
[01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.590]  and a son in North Carolina.
[01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:16.510]  My son in North Carolina, I have not seen
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.870]  and it'll be a year in November because of my choices,
[01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.390]  because I won't take prescriptions,
[01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:25.350]  because I won't stop talking about cannabis and mushrooms.
[01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:26.630]  I don't get to see him.
[01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:27.950]  I barely get to Skype with him.
[01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.150]  If I bring up mushrooms or cannabis on a Skype,
[01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.910]  it's cut immediately.
[01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:36.710]  So these are sacrifices that we have to make
[01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:39.430]  because we know the truth of it.
[01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.190]  And once you know the truth of cannabis,
[01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.630]  you can't help but sing it from the mountaintops.
[01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:49.030]  So just quickly, the neighbor is either cutting a tree down
[01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:52.430]  or doing something, but this is what you were talking about
[01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:54.270]  from David Shulkin.
[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:55.110]  Let me just-
[01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.950]  Thank you.
[01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.870]  Yeah, that's a brilliant book.
[01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:02.190]  And then Joanne, you wanna jump in
[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.870]  and kind of tell your,
[01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:06.390]  I think it's basically your story of,
[01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:12.270]  figuring out that this works for you
[01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:14.990]  and then specifically what works, what doesn't work
[01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:19.350]  as some cannabis and form factors of taking it,
[01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:22.790]  maybe don't work or are less effective or adverse
[01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:26.790]  in the same way Colin was talking about
[01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:28.950]  where it's like, I had anxiety.
[01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:32.310]  So can you kind of talk about your journey of discovery
[01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:34.510]  and then any friends who you have,
[01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:38.910]  where you can talk about kind of their experience as well?
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:43.910]  Yeah, I'll absolutely share my experience.
[01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:49.430]  I was in the aviation community here with the Navy
[01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:52.470]  stationed in Lamoore, California,
[01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:56.910]  working with F-18 aircraft.
[01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:58.950]  During my first deployment,
[01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.270]  working on the flight deck,
[01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:04.110]  I was actually blown by jet aircraft,
[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:09.310]  jet blast from the aircraft.
[01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:13.230]  And long story short,
[01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:16.350]  it was a horrible accident.
[01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:19.870]  I had a concussion from it
[01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:24.870]  and couldn't speak English for about 20 minutes.
[01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:31.910]  And long story short,
[01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:35.950]  that created a whole bunch of problems,
[01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:39.710]  from the main one that I could experience
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.070]  and could put my finger on throughout that time
[01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:46.950]  was besides the headaches and the back pain.
[01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:51.950]  It was, I couldn't sleep for more than like
[01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:55.870]  two consecutive hours or every night.
[01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:58.990]  So I was waking up every hour, every two hours.
[01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:03.510]  And that happened, needless to say,
[01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:05.190]  I still had time to serve.
[01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:08.590]  I did nine months of physical therapy
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:12.510]  and went back on deployment.
[01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:18.030]  And then in that deployment was where I realized
[01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:20.390]  that my sleeping became a problem
[01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:24.310]  because we were working 12 hours
[01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:27.670]  and I still was up like 20 hours
[01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:29.390]  because I wasn't sleeping.
[01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:35.590]  And that problem, I literally was let out of the military
[01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:39.670]  because after that, I wasn't the same person anymore.
[01:19:39.670 --> 01:19:41.910]  So I didn't even want to be there,
[01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:46.910]  but coming out, that's when all the issues
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.110]  became more exacerbated
[01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:53.190]  because now I'm alone in my thoughts.
[01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:57.950]  And so I fell into the hands of the VA.
[01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:00.710]  I was not, unlike some of you guys,
[01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:04.590]  I had not experimented with cannabis even before that.
[01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:08.510]  Very, in college, I did do it every a few times,
[01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:12.150]  but it wasn't like a thing I had never heard
[01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:15.190]  of medicinal cannabis or using it.
[01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:18.830]  I thought that I had heard of maybe glaucoma
[01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:20.230]  that you can use it for.
[01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:22.750]  And I thought it was maybe a joke.
[01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:27.350]  That's how disconnected I was at that point
[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:28.870]  in my life with it.
[01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:32.350]  And then I met a person who was a grower
[01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:37.350]  and he was working towards, at that point, it was 2014,
[01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:43.270]  he was working on a legal cannabis grow.
[01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:48.390]  And I'm like, what does that even mean?
[01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.550]  But even before we got to that point,
[01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.350]  he introduced me to cannabis.
[01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:55.990]  It was actually RSO.
[01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:59.470]  He gave me a little syringe looking thing
[01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.070]  and told me take a grain of rice.
[01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.510]  And I did it.
[01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:08.150]  And I'm telling you right now, that changed everything.
[01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:13.110]  I am talking about, for three years,
[01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:15.270]  I could not tell you who I was.
[01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.070]  I cannot, I had no clue.
[01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:24.030]  And starting that regimen or that becoming a routine
[01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:26.150]  before I went to sleep,
[01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:32.990]  pretty much cannabis was able to help me sleep
[01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:35.470]  and that solves so many other problems.
[01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.990]  The pain with the backaches, trying to sleep
[01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:42.110]  and all that situation.
[01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:46.350]  Literally within a month, I was already the person
[01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:50.910]  that I remember being before all these problems began.
[01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:53.750]  And I just made it my mission
[01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:57.110]  to make sure I spread this message however I could.
[01:21:57.110 --> 01:22:00.790]  I quit my job and became completely involved,
[01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:04.230]  not only in trying to figure out what worked for me,
[01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:07.990]  because I did, I know Doc brought it up earlier.
[01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:11.390]  There were some of the things,
[01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:14.430]  then I started experimenting with the smoking.
[01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:19.430]  I quit cigarettes and focused on cannabis
[01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:23.070]  and never had to pick that back up again.
[01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.670]  And doing it with the edibles,
[01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:30.830]  with just trying to find out where I was.
[01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:33.030]  I'm a flower person, I love flower
[01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:37.310]  and that's what helps me the most to not only be functional,
[01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:42.310]  but also to manage pain, to manage the anxiety
[01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:45.390]  that arose from not sleeping for years.
[01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:49.830]  And just even my eating habits,
[01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.150]  I mean, it was just a situation.
[01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:56.710]  So I became so serious about it that I have a journal
[01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:59.310]  where I keep the names of the strains
[01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:02.790]  if I'm able to identify that strain
[01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:07.790]  and how I felt documented, more of that for creativity,
[01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:10.470]  more of that for no pain,
[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:14.430]  more of that to be able to sleep through the night.
[01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:18.830]  And then documenting to the ones who felt paranoid
[01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:23.830]  or felt, you know, droggy or whatever the case may be.
[01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:29.830]  And from there, it's been, like I said, a game changer.
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:35.190]  I know individuals in my circle who have,
[01:23:35.190 --> 01:23:39.470]  I have a friend, Dave, he actually makes a bomb at home
[01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:41.590]  from the plants that he grows.
[01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:45.790]  And I know people in my family,
[01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:48.670]  my aunt in the Dominican Republic,
[01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.030]  she's using the bomb right now, she's diabetic,
[01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:55.070]  she suffers from diabetes, she's had it forever.
[01:23:55.070 --> 01:24:00.070]  She has a wound in her foot that she got that, it's gnarly.
[01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:03.990]  She's had it for 10 years because of the diabetes,
[01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:05.750]  she's not able to heal.
[01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:10.950]  And with Dave's bomb, she already has,
[01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:14.630]  unless I am telling you in less than six months,
[01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:17.670]  she's experienced, she already has a scab on it,
[01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:22.670]  which means that her skin is completely being regenerated.
[01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:26.790]  With the diabetes, her diabetes status is there,
[01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:30.790]  the cannabis bomb has been able to,
[01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:33.750]  I mean, I can show you the before and after.
[01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:37.630]  Her whole foot was in the verge
[01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:41.230]  of being completely engulfed in this wound
[01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:42.670]  because since it didn't heal,
[01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:45.310]  it continued to get infections and things like that.
[01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:50.590]  With the cannabis, she sent me in WhatsApp
[01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:54.950]  this message this long, thanking me so much.
[01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:57.830]  I mean, my aunt is like in her 80s,
[01:24:57.830 --> 01:25:02.830]  so the fact that this thing was hindering her life
[01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:06.510]  for a decade and with cannabis,
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:11.110]  what medication was not able to do in years,
[01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:14.830]  a decade, in six months,
[01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:18.630]  she's already has like a normal healing process with hers.
[01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:20.430]  And she's not smoking it,
[01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:24.710]  she's not doing bong rips or anything like that.
[01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:28.030]  She is literally using it as a topical.
[01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:32.150]  And that's like one of the most compelling stories
[01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:36.350]  I have besides the fact that cannabis prevented me
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:37.470]  from committing suicide.
[01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:41.950]  I was literally on the floor with a gun in my hands,
[01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:46.950]  contemplating that when I met that guy that same week
[01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:50.190]  and he introduced me to cannabis
[01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:53.350]  and here we are five years later.
[01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:56.430]  And I wouldn't change it any other way,
[01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:58.470]  it was perfect timing for me.
[01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:01.150]  It became a complete journey from there
[01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:05.150]  and here I am five years later having this conversation,
[01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:10.150]  which I think is crucial for people to listen to
[01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:15.870]  and other people, because you guys are just some people
[01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:19.270]  like in your area, in the Humboldt County area,
[01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:23.150]  Lord knows how many growers have so much information.
[01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.870]  It's crazy.
[01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.830]  It's crazy.
[01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:29.430]  You know, we have to give people like,
[01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.510]  we have to give these people a platform
[01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:34.510]  so they can get this information out there.
[01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:38.350]  And I made that my mission to be able to contribute
[01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:40.630]  to that in that sense.
[01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:42.070]  So I'm very passionate about it,
[01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:45.150]  very thankful to the plant, to people that grow it,
[01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:47.590]  like you guys, to people like Colin,
[01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:52.590]  who create communities and then infuse the message
[01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:57.910]  of wellness and just being able to be stable.
[01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:00.590]  And the fact that it's okay to feel some kind of way,
[01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.150]  but here, you know, these are alternatives
[01:27:03.150 --> 01:27:05.270]  because I cannot take pills.
[01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:07.550]  You know, I, because of the headaches
[01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:09.390]  that I get from the concussion,
[01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:15.270]  they give me 800 milligrams of ibuprofen pills
[01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:16.390]  that I got to take.
[01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:18.630]  These pills are like this big.
[01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:23.630]  I can't even, it's, I can't do it, you know?
[01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:28.950]  So I sometimes had to like get creative
[01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:32.310]  trying to mix it with something else,
[01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:37.310]  but still like with cannabis, it's natural.
[01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.270]  It doesn't hurt my liver, you know,
[01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:44.270]  because with big pharma medicine,
[01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:48.110]  it usually creates an underlying issue
[01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:51.590]  if you use it for long periods of time.
[01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:55.550]  So I prefer the alternative
[01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:57.390]  that's something that's not gonna harm me.
[01:27:57.390 --> 01:28:00.030]  So I don't have to worry about side effects
[01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:02.350]  or long-term effects,
[01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:05.230]  and then being detrimental to myself,
[01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:09.190]  which will eventually create another problem.
[01:28:09.190 --> 01:28:11.430]  So like I said, I'm super thankful to be here.
[01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:14.630]  I know the power of the plant
[01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.910]  is not even just for medical purposes.
[01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:20.710]  It's for pretty much anything,
[01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:23.110]  but creating glass or steel.
[01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:27.830]  Other than that, we can use this eco-friendly product
[01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:30.670]  or crop to help the world.
[01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:32.670]  So thank you for having me here.
[01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:35.830]  I think it's really critical right now too
[01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:39.310]  that the conversation that we all four are having
[01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:42.190]  is this, we know this information,
[01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:45.310]  and I think Joanne specifically is,
[01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:48.630]  how do we take what we all know to be the truth
[01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:50.430]  is how do we get it beyond this point?
[01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:53.790]  How do we get it to reach the masses?
[01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:55.830]  How do we saturate more?
[01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.270]  And I don't know, is it,
[01:28:58.590 --> 01:29:01.110]  maybe it is Pavlo's dog,
[01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:02.910]  repeat it over and over and over again,
[01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.350]  and eventually it sticks.
[01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:08.550]  I've been preaching it for 40 years
[01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:10.030]  and not sure that it's,
[01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:11.310]  maybe it's sticking now
[01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:14.310]  as it just generationally moves so much,
[01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:17.550]  where so many people with this quasi-legal thing
[01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:19.870]  that we're in are stepping forward
[01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:22.590]  because the states say it's okay.
[01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:25.030]  You know, if we can get this federal ship to come,
[01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:26.710]  hopefully in the next 24 months,
[01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.910]  get this federal ship to come with the D-class
[01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:32.470]  on schedule one, where as it rightfully should be,
[01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:34.390]  that it does have true medical value.
[01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:35.230]  As a matter of fact,
[01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:38.950]  it's at the top of the pharmacopoeia of medical value.
[01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:40.630]  That's where we need to move this to
[01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:41.750]  where we can get it to open,
[01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:45.110]  where the ones that are still standing on the sidelines
[01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:47.550]  watching, and you alluded to it earlier,
[01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:49.470]  of fear, you know,
[01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:51.630]  fear of repercussion of the unknown.
[01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.230]  It's here too.
[01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:56.950]  I'm kind of on the tip of the spear here for cannabis
[01:29:56.950 --> 01:30:00.110]  because I have outed myself and put my face on videos
[01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:02.470]  and stuff, and a lot of my grower friends,
[01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:03.630]  as you said, sisters,
[01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:07.670]  the truth is about 80% of the best genetics in the world
[01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:10.990]  are within about a 50 mile radius of where I live.
[01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:15.510]  And I know the bulk of them, you know,
[01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.150]  it's like there are a lot of them with what,
[01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:18.790]  what Dale and I are doing two years ago,
[01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:21.590]  they wouldn't even come to a meeting that when he met me up
[01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:24.470]  here in the Redwoods, they wouldn't come to it.
[01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:27.750]  And this earlier this year in January on the radio,
[01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.670]  I had him on the radio with me at K on KMUD
[01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:33.310]  and the people there that wouldn't engage with me last year
[01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:36.190]  about the topic of patent protections,
[01:30:36.190 --> 01:30:37.910]  what I'm doing, patent protection.
[01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:40.070]  So people can't rip me off anymore.
[01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:42.190]  That's my primary.
[01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:44.110]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:44.950]  It is.
[01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:46.510]  And that's mostly so,
[01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:48.470]  that's just the one side of it is branding
[01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:50.710]  and aligning with cam so that,
[01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:54.350]  so high tie distro can help get veterans choice cannabis
[01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:56.190]  across the country.
[01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:59.710]  You know, we're going to blow California up,
[01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.390]  but just when it's the time is right,
[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:02.670]  move it across the country.
[01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:04.990]  You know, that's the big goal right now,
[01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:08.230]  I think, is we all get the same kind of,
[01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:12.390]  the same phraseology, the same verbiage,
[01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:14.750]  we're all saying the same thing, you know,
[01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:17.550]  and I'm hoping maybe this conversation we can,
[01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.110]  with the other leaders within our respective groups,
[01:31:20.110 --> 01:31:21.950]  we can get where we're all using like,
[01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:23.990]  you know, let's quit saying strain, you know,
[01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:27.070]  let's pick up the correct phraseology of chemo bar
[01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:32.070]  or cultivar and to make ourselves,
[01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:33.750]  and I know this sounds terrible,
[01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:36.310]  but to make ourselves look more professional, you know,
[01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:38.710]  I mean, honest to God, I cleaned up today
[01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:40.550]  so I didn't look so shaggy, you know,
[01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:43.310]  and that's kind of, I know, Cam, you know,
[01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:45.870]  we already look like rough, rowdy, rough
[01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:47.350]  next to a lot of people anyway,
[01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:50.630]  just because we look like wild old fuzzy guys, you know,
[01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:55.190]  and we need people that can help us translate across
[01:31:55.190 --> 01:31:57.550]  where that, you know, we're talking about chemo bars
[01:31:57.550 --> 01:32:00.830]  and cultivars and even me personally in the last 24 months,
[01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:03.990]  having access to, Peter led to that earlier,
[01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:06.430]  I have access to the medical professionals now
[01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:08.630]  where I can get the correct phraseology
[01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:13.190]  and I understand CBD and CBG and CBN
[01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:16.230]  and things that I didn't know how to say that
[01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:19.070]  three years ago, you know, I got what it did
[01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.830]  and I could tell you, you know, if you smoke this, man,
[01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:22.270]  I promise you in about 20 minutes,
[01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:25.150]  you're gonna be relaxed and like the Raselberry Cush,
[01:32:25.150 --> 01:32:28.590]  you know, and you alluded to it just briefly on that one,
[01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:32.230]  that is a true heirloom one-to-one cultivar.
[01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:37.030]  It is a full spectrum CBD THC rich
[01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:41.430]  and it is literally about 15% THC.
[01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:43.870]  Most shops won't even wanna look at that,
[01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:48.550]  but what it also is, is it's 15 fricking percent CBD, man.
[01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:50.710]  And you smoke that puppy and in 20 minutes,
[01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:53.990]  your ass is taking a nap and I don't care who you are,
[01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:56.870]  how tough you think you are, how big you are.
[01:32:56.870 --> 01:33:01.270]  I'm six four and 200 in my prime 260, I'm about 210 now,
[01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:04.390]  but I'm six four and 210 and I'm big butt taking a nap
[01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:07.070]  in about 30 minutes on a nice joint.
[01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:09.230]  You know, that's how good it is.
[01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:10.390]  Yeah, it's so good.
[01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:12.390]  I love that strain so much too.
[01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:16.150]  Right, and it's just, again, it's nothing to,
[01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.710]  you know, the shops, oh my God, it's not 20%.
[01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:20.030]  Well, it's not supposed to be.
[01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:23.630]  It's a medical cultivar specifically designed,
[01:33:23.630 --> 01:33:27.150]  it was specifically designed to help with sleep, okay?
[01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:29.990]  Doc, have you had the terpenes tested on that strain yet?
[01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:31.670]  Do you know the terpene levels?
[01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:34.070]  It's coming, Colin.
[01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.910]  It's just, you know.
[01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:35.790]  I'm excited for that.
[01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:37.630]  Brother, you know, I'm an old man.
[01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:38.470]  You know, I'm retired.
[01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:41.390]  I'm doing it by myself until a year ago.
[01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:43.910]  I was just, you know, I was just growing bad-ass weed
[01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:46.430]  and only a few people knew who I was, you know?
[01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:48.870]  It's an unknown variable.
[01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:51.990]  That kind of, it has like that camphor menthol,
[01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:54.910]  like almost like licorice end note
[01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:57.150]  that I'm just anxious to find out the terpenes
[01:33:57.150 --> 01:33:58.150]  that make that up, man.
[01:33:58.150 --> 01:33:59.430]  It's so good.
[01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:01.230]  Yeah, I can wing it and kind of tell you
[01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:03.350]  just by the profiles what I think is in it,
[01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:06.030]  but I just literally, so you guys get it.
[01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:09.470]  Literally, Joanne, this is how slow I am.
[01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:11.630]  I literally, yesterday, just set up,
[01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:13.230]  Cam, you'll appreciate this, brother.
[01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.430]  Set up my account with SC Labs
[01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:17.270]  and started having shit tested.
[01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:18.310]  Nice.
[01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:20.230]  And I love it because I wouldn't do it before.
[01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:22.670]  Now they actually come to your damn location
[01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:24.470]  and pick your stuff up so I don't have to drive.
[01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:25.550]  So I'm thankful, sister.
[01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:28.430]  You know, it's like, again, I don't want to really,
[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.670]  I mean, I do.
[01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.870]  My goal is really, my goal,
[01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:34.270]  so I want to shift it to the hands
[01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:36.310]  of my young brothers and sisters
[01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:39.110]  that want to learn the craft the way I do it.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:41.150]  Why I'm thankful to have Cam.
[01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:43.110]  We're working on is aligning together
[01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.950]  where I can teach this out on mass scale
[01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:47.950]  so we can get it out there
[01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:50.230]  and let people have access to good information,
[01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:52.790]  but also for me to call him,
[01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:55.830]  calling Cam and I are building that damn retreat.
[01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:58.110]  Okay, we're building that out, man.
[01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.750]  You guys, no more talk.
[01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.070]  I'm done with the talk, man.
[01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.310]  It's time to put your money
[01:35:02.310 --> 01:35:04.350]  where your fucking mouth is, man.
[01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:05.270]  And Cam and I,
[01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:10.030]  and walk it, sister, and walk it.
[01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.990]  And that's what Cam and I,
[01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:12.590]  literally part of our conversation
[01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:13.750]  is we want to build it up
[01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:17.230]  because he needs to ramp up his supply.
[01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:19.150]  He can't keep up with demand.
[01:35:19.150 --> 01:35:20.990]  I can't get mine out.
[01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.830]  You know, it's like-
[01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:22.670]  You're hitting it on the head, Doc.
[01:35:22.670 --> 01:35:24.230]  It's like, we got to do it ourselves
[01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:25.510]  or no one's going to do it for us.
[01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:28.990]  Veterans Walk and Talk has held three retreats so far.
[01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:31.830]  And honestly, everyone has been successful,
[01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:34.830]  but everyone has been also a huge risk
[01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:38.310]  because I am taking combat veterans out into the desert,
[01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:40.870]  out into the woods with no insurance,
[01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:42.830]  no medical professionals,
[01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:46.190]  just the knowledge that I know I can help them
[01:35:46.190 --> 01:35:47.390]  and doing it.
[01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:50.270]  And so it does, it takes people like yourself
[01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:52.750]  to just put plan, put it into action
[01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:55.390]  because no one is going to do it for us, period.
[01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:58.790]  We have an alignment we didn't have a year ago too, Colin.
[01:35:58.790 --> 01:36:00.950]  You know, now we have Dale Hunt in our corner.
[01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:03.550]  Then Dale, again, you guys haven't been around Dale yet,
[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:04.390]  just a little bit.
[01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:05.590]  He's like a brother to me.
[01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:06.830]  I love him so much.
[01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:10.590]  He's like, he's the premier plant patent guy
[01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:12.430]  in the frippin' country, for crying out loud.
[01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:15.430]  And oh yeah, he's a plant lawyer too, oops.
[01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:18.150]  Yeah, but he happens to have a Navy son that has PTS
[01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:20.430]  and he loves my flowers.
[01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:21.270]  Right.
[01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:23.590]  Well, it takes people like you guys and lawyers,
[01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:27.430]  honestly, and politicians to change the nomenclature
[01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:31.070]  of cannabis from gram dabs to anandamide.
[01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:35.470]  From taking this can put you in homeostasis.
[01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:37.710]  Why does no one talk about homeostasis?
[01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:40.230]  Why does nobody talk about the fact that bong loads
[01:36:40.230 --> 01:36:42.190]  and dabs can spike you in and out?
[01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:44.190]  And yes, while you're spiking,
[01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:45.870]  here's your homeostasis level.
[01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:47.510]  You feel good while you're in that level,
[01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:49.190]  but you spike in and out.
[01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:52.550]  Whereas if you take it like intuitively,
[01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:55.070]  you can actually stay within that level
[01:36:55.110 --> 01:36:58.430]  and continually produce anandamide and stay in homeostasis.
[01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:00.630]  This is what we need to be talking about.
[01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:02.230]  This is what we've been doing.
[01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.950]  I know you have.
[01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.390]  I didn't set out to start a distribution company.
[01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:09.030]  I was making pot ice cream in the Virgin Islands
[01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:11.790]  25 years ago, because it made me feel good.
[01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:14.550]  And I just kept carrying on with the plant.
[01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:17.070]  And we've been, my wife and I, Shannon,
[01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:20.990]  we've been growing under the 215 model
[01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:23.550]  in Northern California for over 10 years now.
[01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:27.070]  And we started growing CBD strains eight years ago.
[01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:29.790]  We were one of the very first farms in the United States
[01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:30.990]  to grow CBD strains.
[01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:33.950]  We got our original seeds from Lawrence Ringo.
[01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:35.830]  And we started working with labs,
[01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:38.550]  trying to figure out what we had and what it was,
[01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:41.870]  and trying to learn from all the people like Martin Lee
[01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:45.350]  and Project CBD and Dr. Ethan Russo,
[01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:46.470]  and learning all of this.
[01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:48.390]  And when I started growing CBD strains,
[01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:50.190]  when I'd take it into a dispensary, I said,
[01:37:50.190 --> 01:37:53.030]  hey, I grew this great flower outdoors,
[01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:54.670]  but it doesn't really have much THC
[01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:56.230]  and it won't get you high.
[01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:58.590]  And nobody understood what I was talking about.
[01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:01.350]  And so we had to educate ourselves
[01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.710]  to be able to educate the purchasers.
[01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.750]  When then we had to go and educate the customers
[01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:08.670]  so that they knew what was happening.
[01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:12.430]  And so that just led us down a path of self-education
[01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:14.550]  to where we started doing free trainings.
[01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:15.750]  And in the last 10 years,
[01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:18.390]  I've been a member of over a thousand dispensaries.
[01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:21.590]  We offer free cannabis education to anybody who will listen.
[01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:24.630]  It'll be a group of one or a hundred or however many.
[01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:25.670]  And then in the meantime,
[01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:28.510]  we want this information to be out there for free,
[01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:31.070]  just like we want the plant to be out there for everybody.
[01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:32.350]  We're building community.
[01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:34.230]  We're at this time and place in history
[01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:38.190]  where we get to create the universe that we need
[01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:39.630]  and that we should have.
[01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:42.270]  And it's for all of us who have been in the legal market
[01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:44.550]  trying to survive up till now,
[01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:47.350]  we are just now getting through the survival phase
[01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:51.430]  where we can start helping and institutionalize compassion,
[01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:53.510]  institutionalize community,
[01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:56.390]  create community over competition
[01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:58.750]  to we're all out there linking arm and arm,
[01:38:58.750 --> 01:39:01.350]  telling the government, let Sue Sisley do her research.
[01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:04.030]  Let Dr. Ethan Russo use quality cannabis.
[01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:05.230]  And we don't have to use this shit
[01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:07.270]  from the University of Mississippi.
[01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:08.750]  But there's a lot of us out there
[01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.910]  and I can't tell you how excited I am
[01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:13.830]  when I teach classes on acidic cannabinoids.
[01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:15.270]  I can go into a dispensary now
[01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:17.990]  and I don't have to explain what decarboxylation is.
[01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:19.950]  I don't have to explain to the majority of people
[01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:21.950]  what the endocannabinoid system is.
[01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:23.510]  Now we can get to the fine tune things
[01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:25.430]  where you were talking about the dopamine
[01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:27.390]  and serotonin levels in somebody.
[01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:31.190]  We know that a good level of CBD combined with THC
[01:39:31.190 --> 01:39:33.070]  and the other cannabinoids and terpenes
[01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:35.470]  helps balance out serotonin, dopamine
[01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.790]  and other neurotransmitters so you don't spike,
[01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:39.310]  so you don't crash.
[01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:42.030]  And a lot of the problems that people are having
[01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:44.950]  are because their endocannabinoid system is out of whack.
[01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:48.230]  And, but we're making a lot of great improvements
[01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:50.070]  on the education level in the country.
[01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:51.830]  And it's just all of us getting out there
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:55.230]  and telling our stories and talking to everybody.
[01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:58.550]  Now, my dad's a 100% disabled Vietnam vet.
[01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:00.230]  He was blown up in country.
[01:40:00.230 --> 01:40:02.870]  He was a Marine Corps infantry officer
[01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:06.310]  and turned the right side of his body into chewed bubblegum.
[01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:09.070]  And he spent a year in a body cast in Japan
[01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:10.630]  before he came home.
[01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:14.990]  And I grew up with him medicating with alcohol and pills.
[01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:17.030]  And, you know, he was a great dad.
[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:19.430]  He was my scout leader, but he was always in pain
[01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:20.590]  and he was always suffering.
[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:23.630]  And be damned if you tell him about post-traumatic stress,
[01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:25.390]  that's, you know, that doesn't happen
[01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:28.230]  to Marine Corps infantry officers, damn it.
[01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:30.390]  But, you know, I learned at a young age,
[01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:32.190]  don't sneak into the house.
[01:40:32.190 --> 01:40:34.990]  If I've been out late, come in loud and proud.
[01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:36.790]  Otherwise you're gonna wind up on your back
[01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:38.710]  after you get right inside the door.
[01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:39.830]  Don't sneak around.
[01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:42.630]  But I grew up with disabled vets
[01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:44.990]  and watching all of them self-medicate.
[01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:47.430]  And then myself, I self-medicated.
[01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:49.510]  I grew up in a very conservative Christian family
[01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.430]  where, you know, dope was for losers.
[01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:55.510]  You don't touch that shit, but we drank ourselves silly.
[01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:58.390]  And when I got out of the Marine Corps myself,
[01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:00.270]  I was studying for law enforcement
[01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:01.910]  and I was burning out fast.
[01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:03.550]  I was drinking myself to death.
[01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:05.510]  I was working in bars so I could fight
[01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:06.790]  without going to jail.
[01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:10.390]  And the very first time, the day I got out of the Marine Corps
[01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:12.790]  I smoked my first joint.
[01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:15.070]  And just like Doc says, I was able to just go,
[01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:19.870]  I don't have to be on point.
[01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:22.630]  I don't have to have my back against a wall
[01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:24.190]  looking at the door all the time.
[01:41:24.190 --> 01:41:27.630]  I don't have to be on alert and always, you know,
[01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:28.630]  hyper vigilant.
[01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:31.510]  I can take a deep breath and I can slow down
[01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:33.870]  and I can unclench my fists.
[01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:36.670]  And yeah, this plant's amazing.
[01:41:36.670 --> 01:41:39.990]  And I can't get enough of learning about it.
[01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.830]  We wanna share it.
[01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:42.950]  This is what Doc and I are talking about.
[01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:45.150]  I started talking about the distro company.
[01:41:45.150 --> 01:41:48.030]  We started creating our own distro company
[01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:50.750]  because nobody could talk about cannabinoids
[01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:55.750]  and CBD, CBDA, whole plant medicine like we could.
[01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:59.150]  And so we started representing ourself
[01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:01.710]  and offering free education with everything we do.
[01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:05.190]  We'll offer free classes to anybody who will listen.
[01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:07.870]  And we started finding other small family farms
[01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:09.470]  and product makers and brands
[01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:11.110]  that are running into the same problem.
[01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:14.950]  Small craft family run heritage legacy.
[01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:27.450]  What we wanna do is be that personalized.
[01:42:27.450 --> 01:42:31.930]  We wanna tell Doc's story and have Doc show up
[01:42:31.930 --> 01:42:33.930]  and explain what he does.
[01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:35.810]  We wanna make sure that the people who have done this
[01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:37.530]  for decades and generations have a voice
[01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:40.010]  and we create the community that we need.
[01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.570]  I can talk forever about that.
[01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:44.610]  Well said, Ken.
[01:42:44.610 --> 01:42:45.970]  There's a lot of people though.
[01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:49.810]  There are a lot of, I'm just one of thousands here.
[01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:52.050]  And John, you nodded and you get it
[01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:53.690]  within a 50 mile radius of me.
[01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:55.770]  There are hundreds if hundreds,
[01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:58.610]  if not thousands of small craft mom and pops
[01:42:58.610 --> 01:43:00.010]  that have true one of a kinds
[01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:01.970]  that people don't even know about.
[01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:04.010]  If you're not in their circle
[01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.130]  and get access to the 10 pounds
[01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:08.090]  that they create every frippin year,
[01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:09.130]  because that's who I am.
[01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:10.570]  I don't grow 100 pounds of weed.
[01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:12.370]  I grow five pounds of weed.
[01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:16.370]  I grow five pounds of different strains for myself.
[01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:18.890]  That's what I've morphed into with this
[01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:20.930]  is getting into a position now.
[01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:23.250]  And again, what Cam and I are doing
[01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:26.090]  is like we tried to contract people to do it this year
[01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.930]  and they couldn't do it.
[01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.690]  So again, I'm a first through the door motherfucker man
[01:43:30.690 --> 01:43:32.570]  and that's who I am.
[01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:35.170]  I've been kicking indoors for a long time
[01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:36.930]  and I'm kicking indoors with probably
[01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:38.490]  the toughest cat in this state
[01:43:38.490 --> 01:43:40.610]  as far as distribution that I'm aware of
[01:43:40.610 --> 01:43:43.930]  who is also a door kicking old guy too.
[01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:45.250]  And we went along with people
[01:43:45.250 --> 01:43:46.810]  that wanna get this thing out there
[01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:49.290]  and we're gonna make it happen ourselves.
[01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:51.170]  Because I get what Colin was saying earlier.
[01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:53.130]  He's like, we have to do it ourselves
[01:43:53.130 --> 01:43:56.130]  because again, walk the walk.
[01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:56.970]  So get out there.
[01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:59.530]  We tried to contract people to make it happen
[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:00.610]  and we couldn't get it done.
[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:02.810]  So we're gonna build it ourselves.
[01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:04.370]  And that's just basically,
[01:44:04.810 --> 01:44:07.650]  and our alignment is that's what again,
[01:44:07.650 --> 01:44:10.490]  I think with you, everything is coming together
[01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:12.850]  for a point here where we all are intertwined
[01:44:12.850 --> 01:44:14.770]  with each other now, where we know each other,
[01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:18.410]  where you need access, you reach out.
[01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:20.330]  We need to get to your market.
[01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:22.010]  We're gonna reach out to you.
[01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:25.130]  These kinds of things where we can all expand
[01:44:25.130 --> 01:44:27.650]  what we're doing for the greater good.
[01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:28.970]  You hit it on the head, doc.
[01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:31.890]  It's about access, access, access, access.
[01:44:32.010 --> 01:44:33.690]  Access, access, access.
[01:44:33.690 --> 01:44:37.090]  If I give somebody your pineapple berry kush
[01:44:37.090 --> 01:44:38.850]  and it helps a veteran,
[01:44:38.850 --> 01:44:41.850]  I need to ensure that they can access it
[01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:43.010]  whenever they need it
[01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:45.810]  because they don't need it just every now and then.
[01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:46.650]  And so you're right on.
[01:44:46.650 --> 01:44:47.490]  It kills me.
[01:44:47.490 --> 01:44:48.330]  It kills me, Colin.
[01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:50.690]  70% of Californians don't have access
[01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:51.890]  to cannabis within an hour.
[01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:54.450]  My five pounds or 10 pounds, it just goes away.
[01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:56.330]  It's goes so quickly as I wanna get it
[01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:58.970]  into the hands of people like where,
[01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:00.090]  I don't mind being part of it,
[01:45:00.090 --> 01:45:01.410]  I'm too old to do it myself.
[01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:02.770]  I need young men and women
[01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:04.050]  that wanna get their hands dirty
[01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:06.010]  and wanna learn how to cultivate cannabis
[01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:08.530]  to come up to the middle of nowhere
[01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:11.130]  in the wild woods and the mountainside with me
[01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.530]  and the other bearded guy.
[01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:15.850]  And me more than anybody,
[01:45:16.730 --> 01:45:18.290]  we're building a thing together,
[01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:20.050]  but it's like I get what he's doing
[01:45:20.050 --> 01:45:22.090]  where he's at in Sonoma
[01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:25.250]  to where we're looking at up in Northern Mendo
[01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:26.850]  and Southern Humboldt,
[01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:28.650]  that's a three hour gap.
[01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:30.450]  It's like I have people that are vet,
[01:45:30.450 --> 01:45:32.090]  again, other veteran growers
[01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:33.090]  that are gonna,
[01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:35.090]  I've already told me that are good at their craft
[01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:36.490]  that wanna learn underneath me
[01:45:36.490 --> 01:45:38.130]  that are willing to come from where they are
[01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:41.130]  around the world to come be a part of this deal.
[01:45:41.130 --> 01:45:43.250]  And we wanna share this information for free.
[01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:45.370]  We wanna make sure that everybody has access.
[01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:47.650]  We wanna be educating people,
[01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:50.010]  especially veterans to come into the industry
[01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.850]  and have a level of education.
[01:45:51.850 --> 01:45:53.690]  We wanna make sure everybody has access
[01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:55.010]  to continuous medicine.
[01:45:55.930 --> 01:45:58.890]  There's no better place for veterans.
[01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:01.290]  There's no better business that I can suggest
[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:03.610]  to veterans to go work in than in cannabis.
[01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:04.530]  Yeah, it's the best.
[01:46:04.530 --> 01:46:05.370]  Absolutely.
[01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:06.210]  Right now.
[01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:12.450]  Because even the act of growing is therapeutic.
[01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:14.010]  Yes.
[01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:17.050]  Oh, getting your hands in the soil and touching it,
[01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:18.690]  getting connected to the ground
[01:46:18.690 --> 01:46:20.410]  and putting your hands in the soil,
[01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:23.130]  that plant will tell you everything she needs.
[01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:25.170]  She will be on her tippy toes smiling
[01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:26.610]  when everything's going well.
[01:46:26.610 --> 01:46:28.530]  She may be looking or drooping a little bit
[01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:31.130]  when she needs some water or love or attention.
[01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:33.530]  But that connection and that love with that plant
[01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.810]  is just, it's very important.
[01:46:36.810 --> 01:46:38.810]  And I think everybody should grow it.
[01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:41.170]  Cannabis is an amazing phenomenal
[01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:44.770]  from the bottom up medicine and it grows on trees.
[01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:47.090]  So why can't we make sure everybody grows it?
[01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:48.850]  If somebody, your friend can't grow it,
[01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:50.890]  give them some of what you've grown.
[01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:52.970]  This needs to be community from the ground up.
[01:46:52.970 --> 01:46:54.250]  Everybody should have access.
[01:46:54.250 --> 01:46:55.810]  Everybody should be able to grow it.
[01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:57.410]  Everybody should be able to sell it
[01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:59.530]  as long as it's tested and clean.
[01:46:59.530 --> 01:47:02.810]  But this needs to be, none of this trickle down bullshit.
[01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:04.410]  This is from the ground up.
[01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:06.170]  This is what's gonna elevate the community
[01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:07.410]  from one end to the other.
[01:47:07.410 --> 01:47:09.410]  This is something that everybody can do.
[01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:11.210]  Amen.
[01:47:11.210 --> 01:47:14.090]  And it comes back to like, what does a farmer look like?
[01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:15.690]  What does a scientist look like?
[01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:18.170]  What does a veteran look like in this day and age?
[01:47:18.170 --> 01:47:19.290]  It can be anyone.
[01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:22.210]  And if you can empower yourself in these amazing,
[01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:26.010]  amazing ways to heal, not just yourself, but your community.
[01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:28.450]  And I hear a lot of whispers
[01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:31.610]  and I wanna pose the question to the group is,
[01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:34.570]  and I know you guys have tried to do many things like this,
[01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:37.210]  dock and camp, but something I'm hearing kicked around
[01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:39.330]  right now through the Veterans Cannabis Coalition
[01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:42.290]  is an HGA, a Home Growers Association,
[01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:45.770]  where you are empowering people to grow in their closets,
[01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:47.090]  grow in their backyards.
[01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:51.690]  And then they are able to gift that certain amount
[01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.010]  of cannabis away so that there is never not a need.
[01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:58.330]  I know this is difficult, but it is a start.
[01:47:58.330 --> 01:47:59.330]  What do you guys think?
[01:47:59.330 --> 01:48:00.170]  There's small-
[01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:01.010]  It's going on.
[01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:03.810]  It's already, especially here in Sonoma County,
[01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:06.530]  we have several cultivation groups that are people
[01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:09.890]  who got pushed out from 2015 into 64,
[01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:11.490]  and they all rally and share tips.
[01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:13.690]  They meet every Tuesday in Sebastopol
[01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:16.890]  and they grow six big ones and it's free information.
[01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.450]  And we're trying to create that community
[01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:20.090]  where we can share the information where,
[01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:21.930]  this is this group that you can access
[01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:23.690]  all their resources online for free,
[01:48:23.690 --> 01:48:26.450]  even if you're in San Diego or you're up in Humboldt,
[01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:28.410]  you can access this group.
[01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:30.210]  And we're trying to do the pay it forward,
[01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:32.690]  my knowledge for you sharing the knowledge
[01:48:32.690 --> 01:48:34.210]  to them sharing knowledge.
[01:48:34.210 --> 01:48:35.610]  So all of these little groups are there
[01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:36.930]  and we're just now getting to the point
[01:48:36.930 --> 01:48:40.290]  where we can stick our heads up and see who we have.
[01:48:40.290 --> 01:48:41.570]  In fact, here in Sonoma County,
[01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:44.170]  we just founded the very first cannabis Grange Hall
[01:48:44.170 --> 01:48:45.050]  in the United States.
[01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:47.570]  And this is a traditional agricultural group.
[01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:50.450]  We have two lobbyists in Sacramento
[01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:52.050]  and a national lobbyist.
[01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:54.050]  We're all in the infancy stages of these.
[01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:55.930]  We need to get the Granges going
[01:48:55.930 --> 01:48:57.810]  in every single county and system.
[01:48:57.810 --> 01:49:00.330]  These are community halls where you can share information
[01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:02.810]  and have classes and hold events
[01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:06.090]  that we can do outside of any traditional market
[01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:08.890]  where it's designed for community and farming.
[01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:13.010]  And then finding everything downstream where this can go.
[01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:15.490]  But we're just now getting out of the shell shock
[01:49:15.490 --> 01:49:19.330]  survival mode from 64 and we're still battling every day.
[01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:22.730]  And I know we can say it's greed in the industry,
[01:49:22.730 --> 01:49:26.210]  but speaking, I do cultivation, manufacturing
[01:49:26.210 --> 01:49:29.890]  and distribution and we get fucked every step of the way.
[01:49:29.890 --> 01:49:32.090]  It's, this is the most difficult thing
[01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:33.570]  I've ever done in my life.
[01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:35.290]  And every day it's demoralizing.
[01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:38.010]  In fact, I use a great Marine Corps motto
[01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:40.370]  with all of our crew, embrace the suck.
[01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:44.690]  Embrace the suck, love it, wrap your arms around it.
[01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:46.290]  And every time they fuck you, you say,
[01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:48.450]  thank you, sir, may I have another?
[01:49:48.450 --> 01:49:50.050]  And we're gonna beat them at their own game.
[01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:52.690]  We're winning in every district where there is no delivery,
[01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:55.010]  no cannabis allowed, but we have to show up.
[01:49:55.010 --> 01:49:56.850]  We have to be at board of supervisors meetings.
[01:49:56.850 --> 01:49:58.530]  We have to be at city council meetings.
[01:49:58.530 --> 01:50:00.330]  You gotta show up to Sacramento.
[01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:02.810]  You gotta tell, you know, old aunt Bessie,
[01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:05.450]  who is a staunch anti-cannabis person,
[01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:07.330]  explain it time after time.
[01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:10.290]  Oh, my dad, he never touched cannabis his entire life.
[01:50:10.290 --> 01:50:13.570]  He was very anti and I just had to go home last month
[01:50:13.570 --> 01:50:17.770]  and help him get his leg amputated above the knee.
[01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:20.490]  He has been anti-cannabis his whole life
[01:50:20.490 --> 01:50:23.290]  and he refuses to go to the VA
[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:25.050]  from the treatment he got there.
[01:50:25.050 --> 01:50:28.970]  And he was in pain and he was having issues with opioids
[01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:31.290]  and life was miserable for him.
[01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:33.690]  And he finally, after 20 years of us debating
[01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:35.490]  on the efficacy of cannabis,
[01:50:35.490 --> 01:50:38.090]  he allowed me to give him some cannabis to try.
[01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:41.690]  And it was the first night he slept in years, he said.
[01:50:41.690 --> 01:50:44.730]  And so if we can convince that old man
[01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:47.930]  that cannabis isn't the devil's weed,
[01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:49.970]  and then we can convince other people.
[01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:52.570]  We just have to meet them at their level of understanding
[01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:54.730]  and give them enough digestible information
[01:50:54.730 --> 01:50:57.010]  and share the resources where we get it from.
[01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:58.330]  Don't come out and say,
[01:50:58.330 --> 01:50:59.770]  cannabis is gonna heal the world
[01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:00.850]  and see it does everything.
[01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:04.810]  No, cannabis slows your body down so it heals itself.
[01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:07.410]  And this is how we know what it does.
[01:51:07.410 --> 01:51:10.570]  And just break it down into simple conversational things.
[01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:13.850]  We do more sharing our stories every day to people we meet
[01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:16.130]  than a lot of other outlets.
[01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:18.330]  So we just need to make sure that we're creating
[01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:21.490]  other people to go out there and share their stories.
[01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:24.250]  We just need to create good stories that can be shared.
[01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:27.370]  The bottom line is our country through Jim Crow,
[01:51:27.370 --> 01:51:29.650]  through segregation, through the war on drugs,
[01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:33.050]  through everything, did a really, really good job
[01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:35.010]  of putting cannabis down.
[01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:39.050]  Like a good job to the point where people like your friend
[01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:42.770]  of 20 years, it's ingrained that it's bad.
[01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:44.690]  It's bad, it's bad, it's bad.
[01:51:44.690 --> 01:51:48.290]  We need to do an even better job than they ever did
[01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:50.490]  of unifying, creating communities
[01:51:50.490 --> 01:51:52.970]  and speaking our truths, like you're saying.
[01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:54.650]  Couldn't have said it better, Cam.
[01:51:55.570 --> 01:51:59.930]  Just quickly, it seems like we've been talking
[01:51:59.930 --> 01:52:03.370]  about kind of the grassroots and momentum from the bottom.
[01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:08.370]  And I view it as like an iceberg kind of,
[01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:10.610]  it's moving in a direction
[01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:15.050]  and whether it's moving too slowly is a moot point
[01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:16.130]  because it's happening.
[01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:18.330]  Like you guys are gonna touch more veterans
[01:52:18.330 --> 01:52:21.610]  and we'll touch more and more and more people will try it
[01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:23.810]  and then become evangelists.
[01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:27.730]  But let's talk about the other side, which is the top down.
[01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:30.090]  We touched on the VA.
[01:52:30.090 --> 01:52:34.010]  Can you guys offer some tactical ideas and not just the VA?
[01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:36.330]  I mean, think about each of you are in different branches
[01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:37.730]  of the military.
[01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:39.810]  So how do you put pressure on them?
[01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:43.450]  Is there like one individual who's blocking progress?
[01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:47.290]  Is it, for example, like if in a county, the sheriff is-
[01:52:47.290 --> 01:52:48.850]  Mitch McConnell.
[01:52:48.850 --> 01:52:51.850]  Mitch McConnell is blocking progress.
[01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:54.530]  That's who's blocking progress.
[01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:56.730]  Because he loves hemp and not cannabis.
[01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:02.170]  The bill is sitting there.
[01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:04.330]  Again, where's the holdup at?
[01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:05.410]  Is it sitting right there?
[01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:08.410]  They're trying to vote on it right now to turn it in
[01:53:09.210 --> 01:53:12.170]  to decriminalize it, to take it off the regulation
[01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:13.290]  and it's getting voted on.
[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:15.050]  They just said they're voting on it sometime
[01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:17.130]  in the next couple of weeks, I believe,
[01:53:17.130 --> 01:53:19.450]  but it's gotta get past McConnell's desk.
[01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:21.010]  That's the truth of the matter.
[01:53:21.010 --> 01:53:24.090]  And I only said that to say this.
[01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:26.970]  It is small grassroots and how do we do it?
[01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:28.650]  You change your politicians.
[01:53:28.650 --> 01:53:31.530]  If they're not pro cannabis, you vote their ass out
[01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:34.730]  and you put a pro cannabis person into that seat.
[01:53:34.730 --> 01:53:37.890]  And that's what I'm getting at, which is,
[01:53:38.370 --> 01:53:41.090]  if in a county, the sheriff loves doing raids
[01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:43.490]  on cannabis farmers, well, that guy comes up
[01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:45.490]  for reelection every once in a while.
[01:53:45.490 --> 01:53:49.210]  So thinking of all these different groups
[01:53:49.210 --> 01:53:52.410]  that we need to change, the VA is one.
[01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:55.930]  So my question is like, is the VA a monolith
[01:53:55.930 --> 01:54:00.530]  where like the West LA VA just has to go by the orders
[01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:05.050]  of the national VA or is each local VA
[01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:09.090]  its own kind of silo of decision-making
[01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:10.930]  where they could be a little more tolerant
[01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:12.450]  or a little less tolerant?
[01:54:14.050 --> 01:54:16.530]  I will address that personally.
[01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:20.050]  Specifically that it depends on where
[01:54:20.050 --> 01:54:24.090]  the specific community-based outreach program is at.
[01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:29.090]  Here where we're at is the CBOC and Eureka specifically,
[01:54:29.370 --> 01:54:32.410]  like my physicians there, my primary care people,
[01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:35.570]  they all know I use the plan, I don't take synthetics.
[01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:37.770]  You go to another state where they don't have
[01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:40.930]  the same kind of compassion laws or depth of understanding
[01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:43.810]  like we do because this is a Humboldt County
[01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:47.050]  fricking facility, that's a lot of what it is.
[01:54:47.050 --> 01:54:49.250]  It's right down to the personal level
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:53.130]  of how the doctor interprets how the bill is written
[01:54:53.130 --> 01:54:55.930]  and how the regulations are written within the VA.
[01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:58.450]  But again, depending on where you're at,
[01:54:58.450 --> 01:55:01.530]  it's up to personal interpretation of your fricking position
[01:55:01.530 --> 01:55:03.290]  but my personal primary care,
[01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:05.090]  literally the last time I was in there,
[01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:07.770]  he's asking me about what I'm cultivating.
[01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:12.010]  And this is all happening in just the last few years.
[01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:15.050]  I'm gonna say it's not immediately
[01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:17.530]  but I'm gonna say in places where they're not
[01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:20.450]  in the middle of the mecca for cannabis
[01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:22.930]  in Northern California, then obviously
[01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:25.170]  you're not gonna get the same kind of pro approach
[01:55:25.170 --> 01:55:26.810]  someplace else.
[01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:30.630]  I believe in places where compassion laws are in place,
[01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:33.150]  where the doctors can talk about cannabis
[01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:36.390]  with the veterans, it's tough because if you're rated
[01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:38.590]  and you're not 100% secured in your rating,
[01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:39.870]  they can mess with your rating
[01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:41.750]  and take your money away from you.
[01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:44.310]  That's a serious consideration for a lot of people.
[01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:46.870]  Colin's not in that boat, I'm not in that boat.
[01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:50.350]  It's like we're beyond those points where we are with it
[01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:53.030]  but there was a point where it would have affected me too.
[01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:55.390]  It's like, I have to be careful.
[01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:58.830]  We all have to be aware of what the laws are around us,
[01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:01.790]  not expose ourselves to any kind of risk.
[01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:05.110]  If you're not 100% sure, don't expose yourself.
[01:56:05.110 --> 01:56:07.470]  I believe we have enough legal people around us now,
[01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:10.950]  civilian legal people and veteran lawyers
[01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:13.150]  that to get advice from where it isn't gonna cost you
[01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:16.390]  250 or $1,000 an hour to find out if it's safe for you
[01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:18.230]  to talk to somebody in your state.
[01:56:18.230 --> 01:56:19.790]  That's part of the other things we need to start
[01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:21.750]  to be working on, I believe as a group.
[01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:24.710]  Okay, so these are things that I think
[01:56:24.710 --> 01:56:29.190]  on a broader national level that we need to be,
[01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:32.270]  because California, again, we're all West Coast, man.
[01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:33.990]  We're living this bubble out here.
[01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:39.670]  Whatever, 24 years of medical cannabis now, it's in 96.
[01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:43.350]  It's just that so much has changed
[01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:45.230]  where we've been in this thing for so long
[01:56:45.230 --> 01:56:47.630]  where our doctors are way more lenient.
[01:56:47.630 --> 01:56:49.510]  In the North, I don't know about the Southern half
[01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:51.550]  of the state, but you get North San Francisco
[01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:54.430]  and coming up, cannabis is a way of life
[01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:56.550]  in the Northern half of the state.
[01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:58.550]  I mean, it's just how it is.
[01:56:58.550 --> 01:57:01.790]  I believe all our doctors are understanding of it,
[01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:04.150]  maybe not completely receptive to it,
[01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:05.790]  but at least sympathetic of it.
[01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:10.430]  I know Colin's experience with LA and stuff,
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:13.070]  is again, a different portion of the state
[01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:15.470]  and just a different mindset of the doctor.
[01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:18.030]  So it's gonna go down to what each individual doctor is
[01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.830]  within your VA.
[01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:23.590]  Best advice, don't say anything about your cannabis use
[01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:25.910]  until you're 100% sure you can,
[01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:28.030]  unless you live in a community like where I live at,
[01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:30.790]  or you know your doctors are 100% pro cannabis
[01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:32.790]  and they're not gonna put it in your records.
[01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:34.830]  If you put it in your records, you're screwed right now.
[01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:38.110]  And again, it boils down to, we gotta get Mitch McConnell
[01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:40.950]  to either out of the office or change his mindset
[01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:43.590]  and get this bill changed on schedule one.
[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:47.030]  The schedule one, that's no medical value is bullshit
[01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:49.070]  and we all know it's bullshit.
[01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:50.910]  And we need our medical professionals,
[01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:53.270]  our scientists, our legislators.
[01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:55.110]  And again, if they aren't pro cannabis,
[01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:59.070]  then vote them out and put somebody in who is pro cannabis.
[01:57:59.070 --> 01:58:02.110]  Because this is, again, I hate to be this way,
[01:58:02.110 --> 01:58:05.110]  but this is about control and greed and corruption.
[01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:07.150]  And that is the truth of the matter.
[01:58:07.150 --> 01:58:11.390]  It's everything, keeping the masses under control,
[01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:13.910]  incarceration, it all ties into it.
[01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:18.030]  How many non-violent first offenders
[01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:20.510]  are in federal prison over cannabis?
[01:58:21.110 --> 01:58:22.790]  It's just freaking ridiculous.
[01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:24.430]  There's people that instill,
[01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:27.150]  was it the last prisoner project
[01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:29.150]  that is Steve D'Angelo's project?
[01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:31.070]  Is it what that one is, right?
[01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:33.230]  It's ridiculous over joints.
[01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:35.990]  It's like 25 years for a freaking joint?
[01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:37.030]  Are you out of your fucking mind?
[01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:38.390]  What the wrong is in this country?
[01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:40.710]  How does this, how do we do this?
[01:58:40.710 --> 01:58:43.910]  It's like, I'm getting kind of off point here a little bit,
[01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:45.830]  but this really is what it boils down to
[01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:47.950]  is we have to vote with our conscience.
[01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:50.310]  We have to, even if you don't tell people you smoke,
[01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:52.590]  and you use that plant,
[01:58:52.590 --> 01:58:54.310]  you need to talk to your politicians
[01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:57.550]  and vote for those people who are that way.
[01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:59.870]  And if they're not, don't vote for them.
[01:58:59.870 --> 01:59:00.710]  You know, it's like here,
[01:59:00.710 --> 01:59:02.750]  the Trinity County Sheriff last year,
[01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:06.990]  mom and pops with 30 to 40, $50,000 worth of paid permits
[01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:08.550]  with their papers in their hands,
[01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:11.270]  having federal agents kick their gates in and go,
[01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:13.310]  we don't care what your damn papers say,
[01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:15.430]  we're here to knock your plants down.
[01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:16.870]  That's bullshit, man.
[01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:18.430]  Well, that's an elected official.
[01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:20.950]  That's an elected sheriff at Trinity County.
[01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:22.590]  Vote that son of a bitch out
[01:59:22.590 --> 01:59:25.510]  and put somebody in who is pro cannabis.
[01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:26.790]  That's how it works here.
[01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:28.710]  That's how it works here.
[01:59:28.710 --> 01:59:32.950]  Our county sheriff is 100% behind mom and pops,
[01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:35.790]  100% behind what we do here.
[01:59:35.790 --> 01:59:37.110]  They won't accept the funds.
[01:59:37.110 --> 01:59:38.590]  They don't allow it to happen here.
[01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:40.870]  It's a long time coming.
[01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:43.910]  You know, been handcuffed, been pepper sprayed before.
[01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.750]  Wasn't that way 20 years ago?
[01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:48.390]  You know, when the laws first changed in the late 90s,
[01:59:49.190 --> 01:59:50.390]  it wasn't that way.
[01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:56.110]  So there we're talking about kind of elected officials
[01:59:56.110 --> 01:59:57.470]  and voting them in and out.
[01:59:57.470 --> 02:00:01.110]  Like, I'm gonna take the concrete example
[02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:05.310]  of the West LA VA where it's not elected doctors,
[02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:07.510]  it's not elected administrators.
[02:00:08.430 --> 02:00:12.430]  Colin, would it be possible to create, you know,
[02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:16.390]  if veterans in different municipalities created lists,
[02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:18.990]  like, could we create lists of the doctors
[02:00:18.990 --> 02:00:21.270]  who are kind of on staff at the VAs
[02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:23.830]  and then have some sort of constant
[02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:25.550]  trying to outreach to them
[02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:29.550]  and invite them to local events and see if they'll,
[02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:32.310]  you know, cause it just takes one domino to be like,
[02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:35.070]  I'll come to that event and like meet and listen
[02:00:35.070 --> 02:00:38.990]  and talk about medical and cannabis and I'm a VA doctor.
[02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:41.390]  And then he goes back and tells like
[02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:43.790]  one of the other VA doctors at West LA,
[02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:45.070]  like I was at this thing
[02:00:45.070 --> 02:00:46.790]  and it was actually pretty interesting.
[02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:50.110]  And, you know, you're just moving mindsets
[02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:52.070]  a little bit at a time.
[02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:54.750]  Yeah, we try and that's, you know,
[02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:58.590]  exactly what we strive to do at Veterans Walk and Talk
[02:00:58.590 --> 02:01:02.870]  with no nonprofit flag, with no business license
[02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:05.350]  so that we can just subvert from the inside.
[02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:09.270]  You can't go to a VA in Southern California or Oklahoma
[02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:11.470]  and not find Veterans Walk and Talk literature.
[02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:12.870]  We drop it off routinely.
[02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:14.630]  I have people who do it for me.
[02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:18.110]  But the fact of the matter is like what Doc said
[02:01:18.110 --> 02:01:21.550]  is that as long as Veterans are too afraid to talk
[02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:24.630]  to their medical professionals about cannabis,
[02:01:24.630 --> 02:01:27.590]  there are gonna be no chances for medical professionals
[02:01:27.590 --> 02:01:29.870]  to leave the grounds to learn about cannabis
[02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:32.190]  because their jobs are at stake as well.
[02:01:32.190 --> 02:01:36.550]  The flip side of that is UCLA, I know for a fact,
[02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:39.230]  has partnered with the West LA VA
[02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:43.070]  to do more research on cannabis.
[02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:48.070]  They have the Canna Club at USC and UCLA.
[02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:53.270]  I have personally been to UCLA run operations,
[02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:56.710]  several of them, cannabis operations.
[02:01:56.710 --> 02:02:01.710]  And I can tell you wholeheartedly that they're lacking.
[02:02:04.190 --> 02:02:06.550]  I've been, one of them was up to par.
[02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:09.070]  The other one is just embarrassing.
[02:02:09.070 --> 02:02:12.750]  So, but you're right on the money.
[02:02:13.710 --> 02:02:18.470]  The VA works based on results.
[02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:22.790]  So as long as they are showing some kind of result
[02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:26.230]  in a field, that field will continue to get funded,
[02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:30.110]  which is why they make us interview for a bed
[02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:33.670]  and that we have to actually qualify for
[02:02:33.670 --> 02:02:36.510]  because then our position is more likely
[02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:41.430]  to fruit them a positive outcome.
[02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:44.270]  And therefore they will get more funding.
[02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:48.990]  So yeah, it's from the top up.
[02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:50.470]  That's where it has to be.
[02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:52.270]  When you have, like I said, again,
[02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:55.270]  people like Shulkin writing books, entire books
[02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:57.150]  about how they tried to change the VA
[02:02:57.150 --> 02:02:58.990]  and couldn't do it from the top down.
[02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:02.590]  You know that a subversive movement has to take part.
[02:03:02.590 --> 02:03:04.750]  And with Mitch McConnell and the MORE Act
[02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:07.030]  and all that stuff, the VA,
[02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:10.350]  it's all lumped into the same thing.
[02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:13.950]  The fact of the matter is that Americans are incapable
[02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:16.270]  of admitting that we got something wrong
[02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:20.630]  to the point where they are terrified
[02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:23.510]  of having to admit that these people were behind bars
[02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:24.470]  for the wrong reasons.
[02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:27.310]  They are terrified of having to pay reparations
[02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:29.150]  to these people once they are out.
[02:03:29.150 --> 02:03:31.710]  They are terrified of generational conflict
[02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:35.070]  that they will have to face because of families uprooted
[02:03:35.070 --> 02:03:37.750]  over single plants, single joints,
[02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:39.710]  quarter ounces of cannabis.
[02:03:39.710 --> 02:03:42.630]  These are mistakes that America made.
[02:03:42.630 --> 02:03:45.750]  They're mistakes that they did to their own people.
[02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:48.270]  They are mistakes that they need to be accounted for,
[02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:50.550]  just like they were accounted for Vietnam
[02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:51.550]  and they accounted for,
[02:03:51.550 --> 02:03:53.150]  they need to account for Afghanistan
[02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:55.990]  and the fact that they keep us there just to make money.
[02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:59.790]  So these are all top down issues.
[02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:02.790]  And until we vote the people out
[02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:06.270]  who are afraid to admit that they've made mistakes,
[02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:08.510]  the mistakes will continue to happen
[02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:11.710]  because there's no accountability.
[02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:16.710]  It's okay for us to say the VA needs to be reworked.
[02:04:17.110 --> 02:04:20.750]  It's even okay, especially from a combat infantry veteran
[02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:22.750]  who killed people for this country.
[02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:24.590]  It's okay for us to say
[02:04:24.590 --> 02:04:27.030]  that the constitution needs to be rewritten.
[02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.990]  That's okay.
[02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:29.830]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:32.070]  There's nothing wrong with looking into our roots
[02:04:32.070 --> 02:04:34.230]  and finding what worked and finding what didn't
[02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:36.550]  and taking it and making it better.
[02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:38.230]  America is scared to do that.
[02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:42.390]  Our health institutions, particularly the VA,
[02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.350]  they're terrified to empower veterans
[02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:45.870]  in a health and wellness manner
[02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:48.230]  because they know for every veteran empowered,
[02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:49.790]  every veteran healed,
[02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:51.990]  they are butterfly affecting 10 more.
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.520]  And that's all.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.440]  Sorry.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.080]  My mushrooms kicked in.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.400]  So I'm just like, yeah, baby, let's talk about the VA.
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.400]  And if you're wondering what Guy Mushrooms looks like,
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:10.640]  it's like this.
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:14.160]  No, it's not.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.000]  It's like this.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:15.840]  He's silly.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:20.400]  I think what we're doing here
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.560]  is kind of part of what we're talking about,
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.280]  which is we can, you know,
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:26.840]  this conversation will reach veterans
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:31.840]  who will be impacted by watching this conversation.
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:36.320]  And then we'll also reach bureaucrats and decision makers
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:37.600]  who will be impacted.
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.760]  And I'd like to put, you know,
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:42.240]  more and more pressure on that front
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:43.880]  and be really tactical.
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:46.160]  And it's good to hear, like, for example,
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:48.320]  it's interesting that you hand out literature.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.880]  Like, do you notice that administrators are coming
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:54.760]  and like throwing the pamphlets out?
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:58.320]  Or are they, like, has there been a transition
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:02.360]  where they're allowing it and they're cool with it
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:04.440]  and they're actually happy you're doing it
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.280]  versus like three years ago
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:10.400]  when maybe they threw it out as soon as they saw it?
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:14.560]  Yeah, but it's all hush hush still, even now.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:17.520]  I mean, I have to take the cannabis leaves off my logos
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.600]  to do this and stuff like that.
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:22.880]  Every now and then, like Oklahoma, to be honest,
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:27.320]  as progressive as we want to pretend we are in California,
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:29.280]  and as far as cannabis goes,
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:31.680]  Oklahoma's doing a great job of shepherding it.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:33.600]  The best in the country right now.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:35.440]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:36.760]  It's the best, yeah.
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:39.880]  And so in Oklahoma, they have no problem at the VA
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:42.240]  putting my logo up and literature up.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:43.560]  That's not been an issue.
[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:48.280]  But here in West LA, because cannabis use is still,
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:51.320]  it's still a disqualifying factor
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:54.520]  to get mental health treatment.
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:57.240]  So they won't, you know, they don't wanna,
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.400]  they call it like, you know,
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.240]  you have to clean yourself completely
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:03.080]  before we will let you get here,
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.800]  which is just absolutely impossible for most people.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:09.520]  And it's also why most people in the rehab centers
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:13.360]  at the VA look like me and are white guys
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.280]  who they think will do well.
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:17.680]  And they're not actually giving the help
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:19.440]  to the people who actually need it
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:22.480]  because of drug use and racism.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:25.680]  So that's all, we could do two hours on that as well.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.520]  I saw veterans die.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:30.640]  I saw them die at the VA in my arms.
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.840]  That my brothers, who I didn't fight with,
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:36.280]  they were Vietnam vets, older African American gentlemen
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.840]  die on the steps of the fucking,
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:41.080]  the home that I lived in
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.520]  because they weren't allowed access.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:45.000]  We would trace their body.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.800]  We would put flowers out there for them
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.360]  because we had no, we didn't,
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.360]  they were there one day and they were gone the next,
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:51.200]  just like that.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:54.400]  It's what's wrong.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.040]  It's part of, and Colin, you say,
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.120]  we have to own our mistakes
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:59.840]  and we don't do it as a country.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.160]  And it's a part of what we're in this mess
[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:04.240]  that we're in right now.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:06.640]  Currently, it breaks my fucking heart.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.600]  I think it breaks all of our hearts collectively
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:13.520]  of what we see with our brothers and sisters
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.320]  that have signed a blank check at some point in their lives
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:19.640]  saying up until and including my life,
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.640]  I'll do whatever it takes to defend our country.
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.080]  And we don't honor what it's supposed to be.
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.560]  And that's not this.
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.880]  You're not supposed to be on the streets.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.920]  There's not supposed to not have access.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:36.560]  I'm a big believer of how we treat the least amongst us.
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.240]  That's my God, that's how my God looks.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:42.720]  And that's how I approach this thing
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.960]  with who I've tried to be around
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:47.680]  and who I try to share with.
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:49.880]  And I didn't quite honestly understand it
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:51.400]  until the last couple of years
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.280]  that the outpouring of the lack of access to what I do
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:58.440]  and what brothers and sisters that I have in my community
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.040]  here, this small little bubble,
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.240]  this utopian cannabis bubble that we live in here
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:07.840]  and the triangle that, you know, it's here.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:11.400]  We need to get it beyond them being scared
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.040]  and afraid that they're gonna have it taken away from them,
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:15.640]  which is their ultimate fear.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:17.280]  You know, it's my ultimate fear
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:19.400]  is to have what I've worked my life on taken away.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.520]  And so I'd rather be at a corporate cannabis company
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.160]  than fricking Monsanto or Dow Chemical
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:30.480]  or Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch, you know,
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.200]  that's gonna jump in as soon as the federal thing changes,
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:34.600]  they're all gonna jump in.
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:35.680]  You're absolutely right, Doc.
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:38.360]  And so many veterans still, like Joanne,
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.720]  I was just gonna throw it to you
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:42.800]  because we talked about this last time I saw you.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:45.080]  We still receive medicine from the VA
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:47.560]  in order to just keep them off your fucking backs.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:52.280]  It's a weird time right now.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:53.440]  You know, there's just a lot.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.200]  And I realized that earlier this year
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.400]  as people were asking questions
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.040]  about what the rules were for like,
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:01.280]  I didn't realize it,
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:03.360]  but I'm the guy they're getting references for
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:07.360]  for the city of Arcata for the edibles guidelines
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:08.960]  of what milligram dosages are.
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.400]  They're asking me, you know?
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:13.720]  And I was like, isn't somebody smarter than me?
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:14.840]  You know, that whole thing.
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.880]  And they're like, well, you know, you've been,
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.360]  I was like, all right, this is what I recommend.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:20.920]  And I'm again, very conservative
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:24.320]  because I believe personally as a caregiver,
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:27.360]  because that's my primary focus for the last 23 years
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.640]  as a caregiver of the Sacred Plant
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.080]  is to always under-prescribe
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.000]  so the experience is an uplifting and enjoyable one
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.520]  and they can always add more,
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.560]  but it's hard to take this away if you over-
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:39.640]  Well said.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.840]  So then they were asking the right person then
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:44.000]  about the milligrams.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Well, I really, yeah, well, that's what they said.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.440]  You can control it if you start, you know,
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.960]  if you start smaller.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:54.000]  If you go all the way,
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.520]  then you gotta do-
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:56.720]  The consensus was that, Joanne.
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:58.360]  That really is the consensus, hon.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:59.800]  That really is it.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.120]  You know, we can add more, you know,
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.600]  and that really, because I have friends that are like,
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.840]  oh man, two and a half milligrams, that ain't shit.
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.560]  You know, it's like, I get that it isn't shit,
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.880]  but someone that's never, ever, ever, ever, ever
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:13.600]  ate this before, two and a half milligrams
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:16.080]  of a certain kind of compound in this plant
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:18.040]  could be almost too much for them.
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:18.880]  Right.
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:20.960]  And me, old school was, you know, my friends,
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:23.560]  because I've shepherded a lot of people
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  into the plant over the decades.
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:28.200]  My friends that would be around us that didn't partake,
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:30.800]  you know, a dear sister, I love her very much.
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:34.720]  You know, like family is like very important to me.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:36.880]  It's like giving her, you know, everybody,
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.360]  all my buddies, you know, and their friends,
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.440]  and even the wives that were doing, you know,
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.160]  a whole fricking brownie, you know, and everybody.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:44.120]  Can I have a brownie?
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.040]  I was like, you know, break it in half,
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:47.320]  and me again, one more time here.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:48.760]  I'm gonna break it in a quarter here.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.880]  You start with this and you come back to me in an hour.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:53.760]  And if you stop, then if you want more,
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:55.560]  I'll give you more, and of course an hour later,
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:56.400]  can I have more?
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.640]  I was like, of course, you know,
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.000]  but I wanna make sure that you're okay
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.800]  and comfortable with the transition
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.040]  from being where you are awake.
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:06.560]  If people don't realize how special
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.040]  and how clearing this plant is to your mind,
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.000]  we do as damaged, again, we as veterans,
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.760]  because we're all damaged on some level,
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:16.560]  when we do embrace this plant,
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:18.440]  at least how I perceive it is,
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.680]  there's this clearing, which you get it from it,
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.280]  Joanne, Colin, what you get from it,
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.240]  now that you're dialing in
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.480]  that you don't want THC heavy plants, man,
[02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:28.800]  that, you know, you can not find-
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:29.640]  Just for now.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.480]  Just for now.
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:31.320]  It works for you.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.040]  One more time.
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:34.880]  I said just for now.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.080]  I was just saying just for now.
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.800]  I will definitely get back to THC at some point,
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.960]  but I just know I need a break.
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:42.400]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.480]  And again, here's what Cam does specifically,
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:47.640]  again, why we're partnering together,
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.680]  is he's been embracing non-high THC strains,
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:53.800]  let me rephrase that,
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:56.800]  he's been embracing full spectrum,
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.640]  correct heritage craft, balanced strains,
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:04.040]  the way mother nature intended them to be.
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:08.040]  That's what I see where we create this market
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:11.440]  or this niche or this veterans community awareness
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.720]  that we have of,
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.160]  this is how we approach this
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:17.440]  with our fellow brothers and sisters in arms, man,
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.680]  we don't care if you want to sit on the couch
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:22.640]  and rip bong hits all afternoon
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:23.680]  and not get off the couch,
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:24.720]  that's your prerogative,
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:26.320]  but we're going to show you how to do this
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.640]  conservatively and correctly the first time
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.720]  until you get your feet on the ground.
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.000]  It's like anything you do the first time,
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.360]  you know, it's like you referenced tequila,
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:36.520]  I'm not a tequila guy,
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.440]  but I know there's a full thing of that kind of a run,
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:40.280]  you know?
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.400]  That meant a lot of things to me.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.520]  You know, it's like,
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:47.200]  and as Colin is reaching out into now like psilocybin
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:48.960]  and other things that are out there,
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.760]  you know, like fricking peyote,
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.440]  which is one of my personal favorites,
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:53.480]  you know, it's like,
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:55.800]  and I did do a lot of mushrooms
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:58.560]  and eat a lot of LSD back in the late seventies
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.080]  and early eighties when,
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.280]  you know, trying to process,
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.800]  so I didn't get that,
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.680]  you know, I didn't get that that's what we were doing,
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:06.360]  that we were decompressing back then
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.120]  when I was a young man in my twenties,
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:10.040]  you know, I didn't get that that's what we were doing,
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:13.080]  that we were trying to cast off all this,
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:13.920]  Colin referenced,
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.760]  cast off all this shit we just got finished done
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.800]  in the previous 72 hours to get that off of us,
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.160]  you know, and it doesn't get off of you at all,
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.040]  you know, it follows you through your life.
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:24.320]  How we process it now,
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:26.040]  what I'm realizing,
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:28.120]  I thought my self isolation was my sanity,
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:31.000]  I believe the plant is my sanity now
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.920]  and teaching people that you don't have to self isolate,
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:36.600]  that you can grasp this plant
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:39.280]  and it can be a lifeline to you.
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:40.480]  Maybe it's not,
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.680]  maybe it's not,
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:45.800]  but at least venture out beyond opioids and alcohol
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.520]  and self seclusion
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.600]  and embrace veterans walk and talk
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.360]  and get around other brothers and,
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.640]  it did this old man that hadn't been around
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:55.240]  other brothers and sisters in arms
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:56.840]  for years and years and years,
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:58.400]  two years ago,
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.960]  for that redheaded son of mine's birthday
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:04.240]  to come down and embrace him and be around.
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:05.560]  That's right, it was two years ago
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.920]  and he hasn't stopped talking since.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.520]  Just been out there just talking about cannabis
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:13.000]  left and right, you can't get away from doc now.
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:15.680]  It's too important, Colin.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.680]  I know, I'm joking.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:19.080]  It breaks my heart, brother.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:20.480]  It breaks my heart, man.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:21.320]  Mine too.
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:22.160]  It really does.
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.360]  It kills me to think that,
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:24.640]  and I got it,
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:26.400]  how I understood it is I realized that what,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:27.640]  Joanne, you led to it too.
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:29.760]  It's like, you can't,
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:31.760]  people don't have access, you know?
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:33.520]  It's like, and I've been literally in tears,
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  the 22 a day,
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.840]  now they're saying 17 brothers and sisters a day,
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.000]  22 a day, whatever the figure is,
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.320]  one too many.
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:42.600]  One a day is too many, yeah.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.080]  Exactly, you know,
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.560]  I got this plant running out my frippin' ears
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.200]  and we can't get this out to people.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:49.720]  Why can this not happen?
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:50.800]  Why can this not happen?
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.600]  And we're making it happen.
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:56.160]  I hope, I hope we are.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.000]  I hope that's.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:01.600]  I wanna touch on one last topic
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:03.280]  and it's kind of, you know,
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:08.680]  there's so much division in society right now
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.560]  and people who get really upset about certain things
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.640]  and I kind of,
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.200]  I wanna point out some commonalities
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:21.080]  and kind of bridging communities
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:24.000]  and, you know, Doc, you,
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.280]  I'm gonna bring up two docs.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:30.360]  Doc Ray, who earlier in this conversation
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.720]  talked about when he kind of realized that,
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:35.480]  you know, the military and the country
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.400]  doesn't care about you who served it
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:42.240]  and Doc Rivers, who said a couple days ago,
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:44.000]  you know, we keep loving this country
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  and this country doesn't love us back.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.240]  There's huge commonality there
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:52.880]  and I think people who get upset about,
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.800]  you know, Black Lives Matter and say all lives matter,
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.080]  I think any black person would say, of course,
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:01.640]  we just hope you realize our lives matter as much,
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.000]  not even more than, but as much as everybody else's.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.920]  That seems like a simple ask
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:10.920]  and just the concept of fairness in society
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:14.920]  and, you know, you're all military veterans.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:19.920]  Do any of you get offended when a pro football player
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.280]  takes a knee at a stadium to try to raise awareness
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:30.280]  for just kind of unfairness in society
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:34.040]  as a slap in the face to military veterans like you?
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:35.840]  Not at all.
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.240]  No, no.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.640]  Joanne, I wanna hear from Joanne on this one.
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:40.840]  Go ahead.
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.840]  I mean, from a veteran, a US military veteran perspective,
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.200]  no, because that is the reason why we serve.
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:53.760]  Collin and I were talking about it yesterday.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.320]  We cannot go out to foreign lands
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:02.560]  claiming that we are fighting for the freedom of our people
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:05.360]  and come back here and deny the freedom.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.720]  That is ridiculous.
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:12.720]  Obviously, freedom of speech, freedom of being a person,
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:16.040]  having your own beliefs.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.840]  We claim that we accept everyone here for their values.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:21.880]  Obviously we don't.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.400]  When we think that, number one,
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.360]  I'm sick and tired of people using veterans
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:35.400]  as a pawn to justify their beliefs or whatever they think.
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:40.800]  Number one, we are just a diversified group of people
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:42.800]  and have different opinions.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:45.920]  And some may agree with that and some may disagree with that.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:50.920]  So you can't just lump us all in one group
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  because it doesn't work like that.
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.880]  Yes, we do join the military.
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:01.320]  We have that in common and we fight alongside each other
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:05.960]  despite our differences, despite our mindset,
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.920]  despite what we look like and make shit happen.
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.760]  Do good things, do bad things, whatever the case may be.
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.120]  But in there, we're all doing that.
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:19.880]  And even in the military,
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:21.560]  there are people that are racist
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:24.280]  and still have to work alongside a black person
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.000]  and get the job done.
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:29.320]  And same situation.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:31.880]  But ultimately, no, I'm not offended.
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:36.880]  I think that is exactly why I went to war twice.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:39.840]  For people to be able to do that here.
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:43.680]  So no, to answer the question, it does not offend me.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:46.040]  I think it's the way it should be.
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:51.400]  So it's somebody that's not breaking a law
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.320]  or hurting anybody,
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:58.480]  but actually standing up for something they believe
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:00.920]  and something that does need to be addressed.
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:03.440]  Obviously, look at the circumstances we're in.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:05.800]  So if that wasn't predicting that,
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:10.800]  hey, putting a shedding light on a situation in America
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:15.960]  that it's about time we get over that hump clearly.
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.360]  So not at all.
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:19.880]  I think it was necessary.
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:22.760]  And I think it's still necessary for people to stand up
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:26.160]  for what they believe in or for stuff
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:30.440]  that's violating human rights in America.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.560]  So no, it's not offending.
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.600]  I'm proud as hell.
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:39.280]  So I wanna hear from the three white males
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:43.360]  in this conversation who all served our country,
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:48.120]  your thoughts on someone taking a knee
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:51.360]  to try to raise awareness for social justice.
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:52.520]  Are you offended?
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:57.760]  Because people watching this are white males
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.760]  who think it's horrific and not patriotic.
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:05.800]  So talk to those people.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:08.240]  I mean, I'm happy to talk about this.
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.160]  I am not offended.
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:14.040]  I think that it is, thank you for unmuting my mic.
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:16.560]  I think that is heroic.
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:20.240]  I think that it is something to be revered in this country
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:22.880]  when you stand up to something that is wrong,
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:25.000]  that should be celebrated.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.520]  I am reading a book right now
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:29.200]  that has got my absolute mind.
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.200]  It's called How Fascism Works,
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.880]  and I can't recommend it enough.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:34.760]  It is very informative.
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:36.400]  And what this lays out
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:39.400]  and what has happened throughout history
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.200]  is this mythic past of patriotism
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:43.720]  that everyone holds onto.
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:48.040]  And this patriarchal society that everything is,
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:48.880]  war is good.
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:50.640]  If you go to war, be proud about it,
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:51.920]  no matter what you did,
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:53.760]  no matter if you did bad things,
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:55.080]  don't talk about those things,
[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:56.760]  only talk about the good things.
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:59.280]  Your beautiful wife at home should be proud
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:02.080]  to be making kids and be taking care of those kids
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.640]  while you're off fighting this war
[02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:06.960]  that nobody seriously really even understands.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:10.680]  And what it goes back to for me is admitting mistakes
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.200]  because it's okay to make mistakes.
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:15.440]  That's what life is.
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:18.880]  To be human is to err,
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:20.480]  to err is to be human, right?
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:21.320]  Shakespeare.
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.920]  So making mistakes is okay,
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:29.880]  but admitting them is just where we get off
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.400]  and we won't admit our mistakes.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:34.760]  And so we built up this mythic past of America
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:38.440]  as being this great land of opportunity,
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:40.880]  the heartland, the heartland, the heartland,
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:43.960]  the people that feed us, the farmers,
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:45.560]  the people, they should be revered,
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.840]  their opinions, everything, it should be preserved.
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.360]  Pride should be preserved.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.840]  That is all systematic racism.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:54.760]  And if you don't admit that you are fooling yourself.
[02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:58.440]  The fact of the matter is people like Colin Kaepernick
[02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:01.520]  taking a knee takes more bravery
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.960]  than a lot of people understand.
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:05.240]  That is not easy.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:08.800]  It is almost impossible in this day and age.
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:11.160]  And look at what it's caused.
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:14.680]  It's one man, one man, and look at what it's caused.
[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:16.960]  For good or bad, people are still talking about it.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.720]  And that's what's important.
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:21.040]  For me, I see,
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:26.640]  I can't have a conversation with people
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:29.400]  who start off by saying this country isn't racist.
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.120]  This country was built on racism.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:34.520]  This country sends people to war based on racism.
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:36.280]  I can't speak for everybody here,
[02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:39.600]  but for me, I came to the army at my absolute lowest point.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.920]  I had no other alternative.
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:43.120]  That's such a common story.
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:44.400]  Why is that the case?
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:48.840]  Why are our most downtrodden and hurt people?
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:51.240]  Why are the people who are impoverished in this country,
[02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:53.320]  the ones serving it the most?
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:55.120]  These are all things that need to change.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:57.880]  And until we admit it, it won't.
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:01.320]  So absolutely, I don't, right now,
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:03.400]  I am having a baby in November
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.880]  where I would be on every frontline of these protests,
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.280]  every single one.
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:11.480]  And I can't, everybody out there protesting, don't stop.
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:12.720]  But you have been though.
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:15.840]  So we've been to protests together.
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:17.080]  That's true, we have.
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:18.840]  And I would be there out there every,
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:22.920]  I wanna, I mean, like I feel this call to action now,
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.240]  but it's almost too like, it's too great.
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:28.000]  Like, I want something to put my hands on,
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.800]  just like I can get and grasp, you know?
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:33.080]  Like if racism was right in front of me,
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:34.920]  I could just choke it until it was gone.
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:36.720]  But it doesn't work like that,
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.880]  which is why these books are,
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.000]  you don't understand like the level of effort
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.760]  that goes into dividing us.
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:45.840]  It is crazy.
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:49.560]  And cannabis is the great unifier.
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.720]  And-
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.440]  Brought it back around to that shirt.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:54.280]  I love that.
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:57.120]  My shirt, my favorite shirt, my favorite shirt.
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:57.960]  Good.
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:00.480]  And what I think people don't realize
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:03.400]  is this isn't about taking away from somebody
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.320]  or a group or a class of people.
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:07.880]  This is about raising everybody up.
[02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:10.080]  This is about looking all of our brothers and sisters
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:13.240]  in the eye and having that contact and that love.
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:15.880]  And if you listen to the people that are spewing the hate,
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.800]  they're angry at people who they've never met
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.840]  on the word of somebody that is a known liar
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:25.160]  or is out there to misrepresent.
[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:27.320]  I've been very blessed to be able to travel
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:28.600]  all over the world.
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.880]  And every place I've been,
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.960]  I haven't been to shithole countries.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:36.440]  I've met beautiful people everywhere I've been.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:39.040]  And I can't tell you how I think,
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.280]  I think travel will solve a lot of that.
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:43.960]  But the powers that be are trying to divide us
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:45.360]  so we don't unite.
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:50.280]  And we just need to look at each other and listen.
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:52.440]  This is my time right now to listen to people
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:54.360]  and hear what's happening and see,
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:55.880]  is I'm at that weird transition
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.360]  where I still think I'm 18,
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.480]  but I think I'm about to get an AARP letter.
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:02.680]  But everybody keeps talking about our kids,
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:04.200]  how they're lazy, they're shiftless,
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:06.160]  they just do play video games.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:08.200]  No, we need to listen to them.
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:09.400]  We need to be mentors.
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.360]  We need to support them.
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:12.240]  We need to show them that there's more community
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:14.360]  than anger and vitriol.
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:17.640]  We need to show the younger kids that it's okay to listen
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:20.480]  and to love another person that you disagree with.
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:24.240]  And I'm hoping you need great trauma to heal.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.240]  And I think we're gonna have to rip the bandaid off,
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:28.720]  rip the scab off, re-break the bone
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.400]  and let it heal properly.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.920]  Add a little cannabis bomb in it, it'll fix it.
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:33.760]  There you go.
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:34.680]  Well said.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:36.120]  There you go.
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:36.960]  Well said.
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.560]  And that's all about admitting that we were wrong.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:42.440]  Let's just admit we were wrong about so many things.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.720]  I mean, we're not even like,
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:46.280]  we were talking about this, Joanne, yesterday
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:49.880]  in our podcast, like growing up as a American man,
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:51.760]  learning in the education system,
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:54.960]  schools where I was taught segregation,
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:56.640]  like not about it.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:58.840]  I was taught that it's how you should live.
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:02.240]  Cliques are a word for segregation.
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:04.920]  These things are taught to us in our institutions
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:06.960]  that we're supposed to trust.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:11.160]  There's so many, America is a beautiful, beautiful country.
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:12.840]  It has potential.
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:15.920]  It's also was the first of its kind in many ways
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:19.200]  and an experiment that is just over 200 years old.
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:21.960]  So it's okay to admit we made mistakes.
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:22.840]  We're that young.
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:25.600]  We barely know what we're doing.
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:28.360]  Can we just admit that and then move forward?
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.960]  Like you said, let it scab over,
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:32.560]  put some CBD balm on it and move forward.
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:37.120]  Period.
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:37.960]  Period.
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.840]  So for me, the contrast is,
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:48.280]  and that for me was really important because I,
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.080]  there are a lot of impressionable people who watch this
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:57.680]  and I want them to hear from real veterans
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:27:59.520]  that you're not offended.
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:05.040]  And the people who are offended didn't serve in the military
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:08.360]  so I'm like, well, the people who served in the military
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:09.200]  weren't offended.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:10.440]  That is the point.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:12.160]  Nobody brought this up, Peter.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:14.280]  Well, that's what I said about the people
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.320]  that use the military as a pawn,
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:20.400]  like a scheme to mask their agenda
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:22.840]  and lumping us all in one category
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:26.480]  as if we all think collectively as one thing.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.680]  So for me, the most egregious thing
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:37.680]  was discovering that the NFL had their pay to play patriotism
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:43.800]  where they were collecting money from the armed services
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:48.240]  for all the dramatic national anthem,
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:51.760]  like military jets flying overhead.
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.760]  That makes you wanna throw up.
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:57.760]  The Atlanta Falcons.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.960]  Yep, go ahead.
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.360]  And so it's interesting to see what people get upset about
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:06.200]  and then they-
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:07.600]  Oh, fuck that shit.
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:11.360]  You said it though, Peter,
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:14.240]  but you said again, and Colin, you alluded to it too,
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:16.120]  is that false patriotism,
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:19.120]  the ones that are upset, they aren't veterans.
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:21.080]  Again, generationally,
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:22.560]  because I'm hearing it from you guys,
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:25.760]  generationally, man, I give a damn what color you were.
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:29.280]  Quite honestly, my teammate was black.
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:30.520]  I love him so much.
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:33.040]  We were partners.
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:35.360]  We were intertwined at the hips, man.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:37.040]  We depended on each other.
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:39.280]  And I don't care, man.
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:40.920]  It's just the bottom line of it.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:43.200]  And it breaks my heart
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:47.040]  because I raised my children to be colorblind also.
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:49.520]  And it just really breaks my freaking heart
[02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:51.560]  because I personally had thought this was something
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.400]  we had worked through.
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.800]  And what I realized is we haven't worked through shit
[02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.080]  in over a half a century.
[02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:59.440]  And I grew up in that time period in the 60s
[02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:02.360]  and saw a lot of this turmoil and unrest.
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:05.920]  And the thing that kills me, and I'm sick and tired of it,
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:08.880]  and maybe as a veteran community, we address it.
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:12.040]  These posers, man, these things that show up
[02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:14.240]  with their indignance, with their flags
[02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:16.920]  and their body armor and all their crap
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:18.680]  trying to say that they represent us
[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:20.280]  and they don't represent us.
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.160]  How do we come in and play a part in this thing?
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.560]  I'm not sure how to address that one, Peter,
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:28.640]  but I do know this part of it.
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:31.680]  There is that part of it that I just,
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:34.120]  it's like, I don't see it.
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:35.920]  Cam saying he doesn't see it.
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:37.440]  Colin saying he doesn't see it.
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:38.880]  Joanne saying she doesn't see it.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:42.960]  We're generationally, we're talking 44 decades
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:45.920]  of freaking military covering it all.
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:48.520]  And we as a community don't necessarily embrace it.
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:51.040]  I'm not saying that there's not that fringe
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:54.040]  that does see it, but we have worked integrated
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:56.520]  for freaking decades and we as a team
[02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:58.360]  approach things as a team.
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:30:59.880]  We don't see black and white.
[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:01.640]  We don't see yellow and brown.
[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:06.560]  We see green or we see blue or we see OD.
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:08.400]  And that's how we function.
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:12.040]  And we all depended on each other to keep each other alive.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:14.680]  So when they coming out this false patriotism thing
[02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:18.280]  at the football games and all that nonsense,
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:20.680]  it's just a bunch of nonsense, man.
[02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:24.800]  And I don't know, you helping voice the veteran community,
[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:26.720]  us getting out, it's like the true ones of us
[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:28.840]  that have signed the blank check,
[02:31:28.840 --> 02:31:31.360]  the ones that has really signed that piece of paper
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.560]  and did the time, we're not the ones
[02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:36.440]  that are up in arms about this thing, man.
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:39.040]  It's ones that aren't really part of it.
[02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:41.240]  It's ones that aren't part of our veteran community,
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:44.840]  the distractors, the naysayers,
[02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:48.040]  whatever you want to call them, man, the instigators,
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:49.640]  whoever they are that think they're trying
[02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:52.040]  to get personal gain on something that isn't,
[02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:56.240]  and Joanne said, trying to get what they want
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:59.320]  off of our blood, sweat and tears and our backs, man.
[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:01.440]  It's like, that's part, I don't think we as a community,
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:03.960]  well, again, we as a community don't get addressed
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:05.480]  99% of the time, why?
[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:08.400]  Because only 3% of us on the whole freaking country
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:10.160]  ever served this country.
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.080]  And then it's even more integrated when you get
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:14.560]  into families that are military families like me,
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:16.280]  I have four grown children
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:20.160]  and all four of them have served, okay?
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:23.360]  I have three that are active right now, okay?
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:26.120]  This is part of, again, we are a military community.
[02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:28.680]  I have a baby brother that is a Marine Corps.
[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:30.680]  My old man was in the Air Force.
[02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:34.000]  We are a military family, okay?
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.240]  That weighs that 3% by a lot when it's one or two families
[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:40.960]  where their whole family served, you know?
[02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:44.600]  And as we've seen generationally since Vietnam,
[02:32:47.930 --> 02:32:50.570]  people that come from underprivileged backgrounds
[02:32:50.570 --> 02:32:53.290]  find it as a way out to get out
[02:32:53.290 --> 02:32:54.970]  and get where they wanna go.
[02:32:54.970 --> 02:32:59.850]  That don't have a slot at an Ivy League college, you know?
[02:32:59.850 --> 02:33:01.130]  I was a military family.
[02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:04.290]  We worked poor, we worked hard, you know?
[02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:07.370]  There wasn't no silver spoons here, that whole thing.
[02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:12.010]  It's like, the military was a way to get away from it.
[02:33:12.170 --> 02:33:14.050]  Get you to where you wanted to go.
[02:33:14.050 --> 02:33:16.410]  What happened with me, generationally, I shifted.
[02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:18.690]  I instilled it in my kids
[02:33:18.690 --> 02:33:20.250]  because I knew they were gonna do it.
[02:33:20.250 --> 02:33:22.610]  Instilled it in them to get what they wanted out of it.
[02:33:22.610 --> 02:33:26.450]  They've all selected careers within the branches
[02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:30.530]  that they thought would best serve them after the fact, okay?
[02:33:30.530 --> 02:33:32.090]  And I'm off topic on this thing,
[02:33:32.090 --> 02:33:36.050]  but to assume that we as a veteran community get offended
[02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:40.090]  because someone takes a knee during a sporting's event,
[02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:42.890]  for crying out loud, it's a fricking game.
[02:33:42.890 --> 02:33:45.090]  Okay, first off, let's get-
[02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:47.770]  That's what I've always laughed at,
[02:33:47.770 --> 02:33:52.770]  is how did sports events become these patriotic,
[02:33:53.890 --> 02:33:56.690]  you know, like national anthem at the beginning
[02:33:56.690 --> 02:34:01.290]  of every professional and college sports game?
[02:34:01.290 --> 02:34:03.010]  It's because the Department of Defense
[02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:05.770]  has an entertainment budget, period.
[02:34:05.770 --> 02:34:07.210]  As long as the Department of Defense
[02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:10.090]  has an entertainment budget and a recruiting budget,
[02:34:10.090 --> 02:34:13.010]  there you're gonna get false patriotism.
[02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:14.810]  The fact of the matter is the Department of Defense
[02:34:14.810 --> 02:34:17.330]  pays the NFL in order to put flags out
[02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:20.370]  and put guys who look revered and do all that stuff
[02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:21.810]  so that their recruiting numbers
[02:34:21.810 --> 02:34:25.730]  in the worst parts of our country will be beefed up
[02:34:25.730 --> 02:34:29.130]  because football and people of color
[02:34:29.130 --> 02:34:31.330]  and all these things are severely affected
[02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:33.090]  by so much of the poverty
[02:34:33.090 --> 02:34:35.130]  and so much of the systematic racism.
[02:34:35.130 --> 02:34:38.170]  At the top of our country right now,
[02:34:38.170 --> 02:34:41.330]  whether or not you wanna put out everything else
[02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:45.650]  that that man, as our president, has done,
[02:34:45.650 --> 02:34:50.330]  that man wouldn't last two seconds on a line, two seconds.
[02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:52.330]  Now, for me, that means a lot.
[02:34:53.170 --> 02:34:54.850]  Put that man on an aircraft carrier
[02:34:54.850 --> 02:34:56.730]  and watch what happens if he's blown
[02:34:56.730 --> 02:34:58.410]  by a fricking aircraft jet.
[02:34:58.410 --> 02:35:00.050]  See what happens to that man.
[02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:01.890]  I'm pretty sure he's not gonna get back
[02:35:01.890 --> 02:35:03.570]  and go to work like I did.
[02:35:03.970 --> 02:35:07.770]  He's not, and he's gonna be milking that forever.
[02:35:07.770 --> 02:35:10.490]  And here's the thing with that is like,
[02:35:11.490 --> 02:35:16.490]  I joined the infantry in 2007, late 2007, 2008.
[02:35:18.930 --> 02:35:23.170]  I had to go through rigorous psychological
[02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:28.170]  and psychiatric testing before I was able to join.
[02:35:28.170 --> 02:35:30.050]  I had to take an IQ score.
[02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:32.090]  I had to take the ASVAB.
[02:35:32.130 --> 02:35:35.170]  I had to, because I admitted to using cannabis,
[02:35:35.170 --> 02:35:37.130]  I joined the military at 26 years old
[02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:40.250]  because I admitted to using cannabis more than 50 times
[02:35:40.250 --> 02:35:43.450]  prior to joining, I was made to see a psychiatrist.
[02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:46.290]  These are all things I had to go through
[02:35:46.290 --> 02:35:51.090]  in order to go to war and be in a lethal instrument
[02:35:51.090 --> 02:35:52.570]  of this country.
[02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:56.690]  Why is it that anyone with the money
[02:35:56.690 --> 02:35:59.090]  to put their name out there can climb
[02:35:59.090 --> 02:36:01.530]  to the very top of that pillar
[02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:04.490]  and be in charge of everyone?
[02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:09.490]  That is so backwards and wrong in so many ways.
[02:36:11.170 --> 02:36:14.170]  Again, we just have to come to an understanding
[02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:16.810]  that some things we've tried have not worked.
[02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:18.610]  And I think we will grow from there.
[02:36:20.210 --> 02:36:22.410]  Hopefully so, hopefully we'll see that.
[02:36:22.410 --> 02:36:23.890]  And I'm not speaking for everybody,
[02:36:23.890 --> 02:36:25.890]  but I hope that we see a shift
[02:36:25.890 --> 02:36:27.330]  that we haven't seen quite honestly.
[02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:30.530]  I'm gonna go back a little bit for some of you guys
[02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:33.490]  when Clarence Thomas was going on to the Supreme Court
[02:36:33.490 --> 02:36:38.490]  and Anita Hill, we've seen this swell of females
[02:36:38.850 --> 02:36:42.370]  and people of color and unrepresented
[02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:45.530]  move into the political spectrum
[02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:47.810]  that wasn't there previously.
[02:36:49.250 --> 02:36:50.410]  Then that was 91.
[02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:52.170]  It's like, that's how far back this goes
[02:36:52.170 --> 02:36:54.210]  since the last time we've seen this kind of grassroots
[02:36:54.210 --> 02:36:55.610]  movement within our politics.
[02:36:55.650 --> 02:36:59.250]  And I'm so thankful to see so many women coming.
[02:36:59.250 --> 02:37:01.450]  Quite honestly, it pisses me off
[02:37:01.450 --> 02:37:02.930]  being a crotchety old white guy
[02:37:02.930 --> 02:37:05.170]  to get looped in with all these other jackasses
[02:37:05.170 --> 02:37:06.570]  that are crotchety old white guys,
[02:37:06.570 --> 02:37:08.770]  because I am not one of those motherfuckers.
[02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:10.490]  No, I'll tell you something.
[02:37:10.490 --> 02:37:14.010]  We are all aware that not everybody is like that.
[02:37:15.010 --> 02:37:16.450]  I'm thankful for it, sister,
[02:37:16.450 --> 02:37:20.130]  because I'm thankful for that.
[02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:21.570]  Not everybody is like that.
[02:37:21.570 --> 02:37:23.970]  And quite frankly, even in the military
[02:37:23.970 --> 02:37:27.850]  where I experienced individuals
[02:37:27.850 --> 02:37:31.930]  who came from a background where perhaps growing up,
[02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:34.330]  the only perception of a black person they had
[02:37:34.330 --> 02:37:36.170]  was what they saw on TV.
[02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:40.770]  And then coming into contact and seeing like, whoa,
[02:37:40.770 --> 02:37:43.450]  and admitting like I was completely,
[02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:46.810]  like I never thought a black person
[02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:49.690]  would be able to do this or act a certain way.
[02:37:50.010 --> 02:37:52.890]  So even in that happened in the military,
[02:37:52.890 --> 02:37:56.410]  and quite frankly, witnessing that gave me,
[02:37:56.410 --> 02:37:59.450]  number one, an even more greater understanding
[02:37:59.450 --> 02:38:01.770]  of the fabric of America
[02:38:01.770 --> 02:38:06.770]  and the limited exposure that people have.
[02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:11.290]  And at the same time, people can come to their senses
[02:38:11.290 --> 02:38:13.650]  once coming, like you said,
[02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:15.850]  I think it was Kim that said earlier,
[02:38:15.850 --> 02:38:19.130]  traveling just completely changes your perception
[02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:22.610]  or your perspective, because exposure matters.
[02:38:22.610 --> 02:38:25.890]  And also even on TV, like representation matters.
[02:38:25.890 --> 02:38:30.890]  So if you have this race portrayed as a way on TV,
[02:38:32.370 --> 02:38:34.490]  and that's the only access
[02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:37.130]  that these people have to view in that,
[02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:40.010]  clearly it creates some systemic issues
[02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:43.330]  in the fabric of America.
[02:38:43.330 --> 02:38:46.490]  And I think the fact that all this stuff is arising
[02:38:46.490 --> 02:38:50.810]  and we are all, even no matter which spectrum,
[02:38:50.810 --> 02:38:53.690]  which side of the spectrum you end up,
[02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:55.130]  as far as your beliefs,
[02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:58.010]  we all know there's a fucking problem.
[02:38:58.010 --> 02:39:01.690]  And I feel like we're all actively working
[02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:05.450]  towards making the necessary corrections.
[02:39:06.330 --> 02:39:09.210]  We all know there's a problem and what's created,
[02:39:09.210 --> 02:39:13.250]  like Colin said, we can't put an actual face to it
[02:39:13.250 --> 02:39:15.170]  so we can punch it.
[02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:18.330]  But we just gotta continue to move forward.
[02:39:18.330 --> 02:39:20.090]  We have to continue to admit
[02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:22.210]  that there's a problem, awareness,
[02:39:22.210 --> 02:39:25.810]  and then what can we do personally?
[02:39:25.810 --> 02:39:30.170]  How far can we reach to cause an impact and a change?
[02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:33.210]  And the fact that we have these conversations,
[02:39:33.210 --> 02:39:35.090]  Colin and I get together weekly
[02:39:35.090 --> 02:39:39.610]  and have discussions that we know are not being had.
[02:39:39.610 --> 02:39:43.130]  So if we have the eyes on ourselves,
[02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:45.610]  we should go ahead and discuss them.
[02:39:45.610 --> 02:39:50.490]  And right now, because most of us are just enclosed,
[02:39:50.490 --> 02:39:55.490]  not everybody, we're not so caught up in life.
[02:39:56.010 --> 02:39:58.610]  Now we're home with this whole coronavirus shit.
[02:39:58.610 --> 02:40:03.610]  It has literally, it's had us glued to a box
[02:40:04.250 --> 02:40:06.410]  for the most part, whether it's your small screen
[02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:08.490]  or the bigger one.
[02:40:08.490 --> 02:40:12.050]  And now we can't turn away.
[02:40:12.050 --> 02:40:15.770]  So now we all have to actually do something,
[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:20.010]  which honestly, guys, it excites me
[02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:21.250]  that the fact like, okay,
[02:40:21.250 --> 02:40:24.290]  so now you really don't got much going on.
[02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:26.330]  What are you gonna do to make the change?
[02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:31.210]  Because now you know that something has to change.
[02:40:31.210 --> 02:40:36.010]  And I'm super proud of at least the circle around me.
[02:40:36.010 --> 02:40:38.290]  And obviously by extension with you guys
[02:40:38.290 --> 02:40:43.090]  that we are all towards elevating everybody,
[02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:46.730]  elevating, we are aware that a group of people,
[02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:49.970]  black people, we've not been elevated by this country.
[02:40:49.970 --> 02:40:54.130]  So it's about time that we equal the playing field
[02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:55.530]  and we are human too.
[02:40:55.530 --> 02:41:00.530]  And we've contributed as a collective to a lot,
[02:41:01.570 --> 02:41:06.050]  just as much of not, speaking from my culture,
[02:41:06.490 --> 02:41:09.130]  we've contributed more than enough
[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:10.730]  to have a seat at the table.
[02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:11.570]  And that's definitely.
[02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:12.570]  Amen, sister.
[02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:13.930]  Amen.
[02:41:13.930 --> 02:41:17.250]  Honestly, because cannabis, bringing it full circle,
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:21.450]  Joanne, cannabis, as you've said, as we've talked about,
[02:41:21.450 --> 02:41:24.490]  is a matriarchal industry.
[02:41:24.490 --> 02:41:28.850]  It is, the plant that we smoke is a female plant.
[02:41:28.850 --> 02:41:31.690]  It is a matriarchal community.
[02:41:31.690 --> 02:41:36.690]  And America is as father first as it gets.
[02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:42.530]  So that threatens the fabric, as you said, of America,
[02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:46.330]  but it needs to be threatened and it needs to be sowed.
[02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:51.010]  The matriarchy and the minority led empowerment
[02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:55.090]  that cannabis provides is one of the most exciting things
[02:41:55.090 --> 02:41:56.650]  about being in this community.
[02:41:57.650 --> 02:42:02.650]  Yeah, I think we can, cannabis definitely can be an industry
[02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:07.410]  that we can pioneer this movement,
[02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:12.410]  continue to show that we all can work together,
[02:42:12.850 --> 02:42:16.850]  that through medicine, through wellness,
[02:42:16.850 --> 02:42:20.490]  we can create cultural change from the root,
[02:42:20.490 --> 02:42:22.250]  from the seed.
[02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:26.330]  If you really, I always like to take it back
[02:42:27.010 --> 02:42:29.450]  whether it's in business, as far as the industry goes,
[02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:34.370]  or as far as medicine go, like we are just planting seeds,
[02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:38.690]  whether it's education, the scientific aspect of it,
[02:42:38.690 --> 02:42:42.890]  the cultural aspect of it, the social aspect of it,
[02:42:42.890 --> 02:42:46.770]  we're planting seeds in literally
[02:42:46.770 --> 02:42:49.530]  and figuratively speaking.
[02:42:49.530 --> 02:42:52.090]  And we just gotta be patient
[02:42:52.090 --> 02:42:54.330]  and continue to do the good work.
[02:42:54.850 --> 02:42:58.130]  And the plants will sprout and eventually
[02:42:58.130 --> 02:43:03.130]  we will be causing a radical change, positive change
[02:43:03.130 --> 02:43:06.890]  for not only for America, but at a global scale.
[02:43:06.890 --> 02:43:10.370]  That's how much I do believe
[02:43:10.370 --> 02:43:12.610]  in not only what we're all doing here,
[02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:16.010]  but like the plant itself and where we can take this.
[02:43:16.010 --> 02:43:16.850]  So-
[02:43:16.850 --> 02:43:17.690]  Amen sister, amen.
[02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:18.530]  Amen.
[02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:21.770]  Farming and agriculture and cultivation,
[02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:25.650]  monocropping and monoculture is never sustainable.
[02:43:25.650 --> 02:43:27.530]  You need a bit of everything.
[02:43:27.530 --> 02:43:29.690]  You need a broad spectrum of everything,
[02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:32.810]  flowers and vegetables and trees and fruits
[02:43:32.810 --> 02:43:34.090]  and all kinds of-
[02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:34.930]  Congas animals.
[02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:37.490]  We can't have a monoculture in our culture as well
[02:43:37.490 --> 02:43:38.770]  or our communities.
[02:43:38.770 --> 02:43:43.770]  Exactly, thank you for beautifully coming in there,
[02:43:44.490 --> 02:43:45.570]  making it come together.
[02:43:45.570 --> 02:43:47.130]  So that's exactly what I meant.
[02:43:48.090 --> 02:43:53.010]  Well, why don't we, that's a good mic drop moment.
[02:43:53.010 --> 02:43:54.530]  Why don't we end there
[02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:57.410]  and we can always regroup at a later date.
[02:43:57.410 --> 02:44:00.690]  We can get ready for part two whenever that may be.
[02:44:00.690 --> 02:44:01.650]  I can't wait.
[02:44:01.650 --> 02:44:03.490]  Guys, it was such a pleasure.
[02:44:03.490 --> 02:44:05.890]  There was an amazing conversation.
[02:44:05.890 --> 02:44:06.730]  Totally.
[02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:07.570]  Guys-
[02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:08.410]  Bye y'all as well.
[02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:09.650]  Keep doing the work.
[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:12.250]  I look forward to working together,
[02:44:13.570 --> 02:44:15.570]  whether it's coming back and regrouping
[02:44:15.810 --> 02:44:18.490]  or just getting the word out there.
[02:44:18.490 --> 02:44:19.690]  So thank you so much.
[02:44:19.690 --> 02:44:20.530]  Thanks Colin.
[02:44:20.530 --> 02:44:22.410]  We need to talk a little bit more, thank you.
[02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:25.090]  Because all of this is happening at the same time.
[02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:27.490]  And this is the third conversation like this
[02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:28.890]  I've had this week.
[02:44:28.890 --> 02:44:31.210]  The universe is putting us all in each other's paths
[02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:33.210]  and we're all asking the same questions.
[02:44:33.210 --> 02:44:34.810]  How do we get this knowledge out there?
[02:44:34.810 --> 02:44:36.010]  How do we make it change?
[02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:38.770]  What can we do in my neighborhood, in my family,
[02:44:38.770 --> 02:44:40.450]  my town, my state?
[02:44:40.450 --> 02:44:42.050]  And we're all here together.
[02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:44.050]  And so let's keep this going between us too
[02:44:44.090 --> 02:44:47.410]  on how we can help each other to move this forward as well.
[02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:50.170]  Because we have a good reach
[02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:53.250]  and this is what it's gonna take to get us to move forward
[02:44:53.250 --> 02:44:55.010]  is conversations like this.
[02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:58.250]  And we all each have a piece of this puzzle.
[02:44:58.250 --> 02:45:00.050]  And so how are we gonna all put them together
[02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:01.930]  and how many more people are out there
[02:45:01.930 --> 02:45:04.130]  that have pieces that we've been looking for?
[02:45:04.130 --> 02:45:06.610]  So we just need to keep this out there
[02:45:06.610 --> 02:45:08.770]  and raise your hand saying, I'm here to help.
[02:45:08.770 --> 02:45:09.610]  So-
[02:45:09.610 --> 02:45:10.570]  Absolutely.
[02:45:10.570 --> 02:45:11.890]  Thank you all, I appreciate it.
[02:45:11.890 --> 02:45:13.090]  Thank you.
[02:45:13.090 --> 02:45:14.170]  No, thank you guys.
[02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:15.130]  Unbelievably fun.
[02:45:15.130 --> 02:45:16.170]  Thank you.
[02:45:16.170 --> 02:45:17.090]  Thanks everyone.
