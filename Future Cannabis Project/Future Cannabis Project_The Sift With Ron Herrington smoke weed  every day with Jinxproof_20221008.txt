[00:30.520 --> 00:35.000]  The new sift I got to get a little like background sound there
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.520]  But we are here with Ron and me and the dab cam and it's not jinx. I'm sorry
[00:44.160 --> 00:52.020]  We just find how you doing Ron doing good doing good it's a little those technology glitches that we got to get ironed out
[00:53.400 --> 00:56.460]  Which is fine. So unfortunately won't have jinx with you today
[00:56.460 --> 01:00.660]  But we we take the opportunity to stop in I'm gonna have a dab
[01:01.220 --> 01:03.820]  Ron's gonna tell it we're gonna try out the new dab cam
[01:04.100 --> 01:11.900]  Ron's gonna tell you a little bit about what he's got coming up for the show what the general idea is of the sift and
[01:13.380 --> 01:16.480]  We'll be back in a couple weeks with jinx next week. We got Doc Ray
[01:17.260 --> 01:19.460]  But yeah, there's a ton of fun stuff going on there
[01:19.460 --> 01:23.060]  So Ron, why don't you tell them a little bit about what the what the idea is?
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.820]  What the goal is and what exactly is going to be the sift?
[01:26.460 --> 01:33.340]  Yeah, what we'll do is we'll get into some some details. We can give some tricks on how how we do our reversals
[01:33.740 --> 01:35.420]  we can
[01:35.420 --> 01:40.100]  Talk to people find out what they say think is hot and new coming up for
[01:40.740 --> 01:46.100]  2023 and maybe maybe beyond where they think genetics is going to be to talk about
[01:46.500 --> 01:51.020]  Stability and ways ways that we do our sift and our breeding and selecting
[01:52.240 --> 01:54.240]  to find that those those
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.200]  Exotic strains boy that that looks pretty good. Nice cold dab going there, huh?
[02:00.120 --> 02:03.680]  yeah, I got a little bit of peanut butter breath from I
[02:04.320 --> 02:09.080]  Think it's all brands cannabis and it's all nations brand cannabis
[02:10.120 --> 02:15.180]  their peanut butter breath is pretty nice and I'm gonna do a little bit of that with a cold start and a little bit of
[02:15.180 --> 02:16.880]  my
[02:16.880 --> 02:20.600]  Leave this is the Ken Harm roof red rosin
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.880]  Across ice cream cake, it's pretty nice. Very good flavor profile. Very very fun and that camera looks great
[02:26.880 --> 02:31.480]  Hey, that looks thick. Oh, I want to see it get it bubbling
[02:31.480 --> 02:37.600]  I want to see some some heat to that and and see that's spreading out. So there's a little warmth left in there
[02:45.380 --> 02:47.380]  That looks pretty good
[02:49.100 --> 02:53.620]  No salad makes see if I get the angle so we're gonna be doing an interview style show essentially
[02:53.620 --> 02:59.500]  We're gonna try and cover all of these facts while interviewing amazing human beings in the cannabis spacecraft
[02:59.780 --> 03:03.140]  Yep. Yep, the the humus beings can can
[03:03.740 --> 03:11.280]  Can send in questions maybe at the end you can stack them up and and we can let people know some of the
[03:11.620 --> 03:14.420]  the the tricks of the trade and and how we
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.820]  Sift out and and find out we get the stuff that no one else has
[03:19.180 --> 03:22.580]  And better at best best of all we're going to be and this is like
[03:23.100 --> 03:29.220]  Getting hardcore back to future cannabis project roots because we're gonna be doing breeder like you're a breeder
[03:29.740 --> 03:33.660]  We're gonna be talking about breeding right? So we got doc ray as the next breeder
[03:33.660 --> 03:38.540]  Jinx proof was supposed to be today, but unfortunately we had some technical difficulties today, you know
[03:39.100 --> 03:41.340]  Who else do you have who else are the amazing breeders?
[03:42.420 --> 03:44.420]  We've got a we've got a PhD
[03:44.420 --> 03:49.700]  Scientist that does the new school jinx is an old-school guy. He's gonna do old school today
[03:50.420 --> 03:56.060]  But in a few weeks, we'll be doing talking to a PhD professor that does CRISPR and genetic
[03:56.740 --> 04:00.180]  Marker assisted breeding and stuff like that. So we'll be given
[04:00.820 --> 04:04.500]  Viewpoints from different angles. Well, that's a really cool looking
[04:05.300 --> 04:07.300]  Dab cam look at that
[04:09.380 --> 04:11.380]  Look at that go it's swirling around
[04:12.100 --> 04:15.420]  Look at that go it's swirling around that's crazy
[04:16.420 --> 04:18.900]  So it should be really nice cool
[04:19.060 --> 04:26.340]  yeah, we'll try to give every bit of the the tricks of the trades that we can to help the home breeders be better breeders and
[04:27.140 --> 04:28.980]  can maybe
[04:28.980 --> 04:32.900]  Not just scramble eggs, but they can make some serious omelets, you know
[04:33.900 --> 04:39.960]  With what's going on? Look at the little beads go around. That's interesting. I love it. It's the auto spinner from
[04:40.560 --> 04:46.400]  True quartz. Yeah, I have like the little dobs in there and it makes them go round. It's pretty pretty awesome
[04:46.800 --> 04:52.800]  Yeah, it is and it just stirs it all up and then makes a nice bill. The next stab is gonna be really good, too
[04:56.860 --> 05:01.740]  Yeah, this is good. So what we will dig into it. We'll have Kevin Jodry
[05:02.020 --> 05:06.540]  Well said he would be on and we'll have him and we'll have PhD
[05:06.540 --> 05:11.340]  so we'll have new school old school and in between and and we'll be able to
[05:12.220 --> 05:17.460]  Give some tricks on how we do we do our pairing how how we
[05:18.100 --> 05:23.460]  Get stuff stable how many times we back cross or if we just do straight line breeding
[05:23.500 --> 05:25.940]  They'll be we'll get lost in the weeds
[05:25.940 --> 05:31.900]  I hope a few times for the people who who really are curious and wanting to learn I
[05:32.780 --> 05:39.140]  Love I it's it's for when you kind of brought up the show is the kind of it's it's about having that
[05:39.380 --> 05:44.460]  Community and just just like get you guys in on the conversation of the breeders. Like what are they talking about?
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.500]  What are they working on?
[05:45.500 --> 05:50.380]  Because right now we've had we're at this kind of I was I was writing the description
[05:50.940 --> 05:53.260]  For some shows that I have coming up
[05:53.940 --> 05:56.300]  And I realize right now we have
[05:57.100 --> 05:58.380]  legalization
[05:58.380 --> 06:01.180]  Right. We've just gotten into legalization
[06:01.180 --> 06:05.380]  So I have the opportunity to be able to share plants and be able to get any of these new things
[06:05.380 --> 06:10.260]  We have an a medical ish system ACMP our system that
[06:10.660 --> 06:14.940]  That allows people to you know have enough plants to be able to breed in play
[06:15.500 --> 06:22.060]  And we have the full legal system and we actually have an approachable legal system now that we have new things like this direct sales
[06:22.100 --> 06:26.060]  and micro licensing and and and and easier cost
[06:26.860 --> 06:30.420]  Easier more cost-effective licensing that are reachable unlike ever before
[06:30.980 --> 06:34.820]  So we're looking right now in Canada and in BC specifically
[06:35.500 --> 06:39.700]  Kind of a renaissance of cannabis, right? Like we're developing
[06:40.820 --> 06:47.060]  Terroir strains we're developing the whole culture of cannabis here in BC Canada and the breeders are
[06:49.900 --> 06:56.100]  The key point of that what's happening in the genetics what's happening and what we're smoking is a key portion of that and I thought
[06:56.100 --> 06:59.460]  It'd be so awesome to be able to have you such a passionate
[07:00.140 --> 07:07.260]  Cannabis advocate in and and breeder and all these other breeders around to deep talk and talk about these things
[07:07.420 --> 07:10.400]  Because it's it really is the new face. It's very cool
[07:10.660 --> 07:15.140]  Yeah, definitely and and I'm definitely coming at it from a humble attitude
[07:15.300 --> 07:21.740]  I've had access to genetics that that most people wouldn't have access to and I was also
[07:22.620 --> 07:28.500]  blessed and lucky enough to hang on to some of that stuff and so a lot of people they
[07:29.100 --> 07:36.460]  They can't get what what some of the few things that we have and there's every genetic guy has gotten got genetics
[07:36.460 --> 07:38.460]  That we're like chefs, right?
[07:38.860 --> 07:44.540]  Chefs, you know, they have their secret recipes and all of that and we have some of our go-to strains
[07:44.540 --> 07:52.020]  I call them foundation strains that I go to because I know what what traits they'll pass off and and what what things they'll leave
[07:52.020 --> 07:56.340]  Alone and so we do that and and every every breeder out there
[07:56.340 --> 08:02.100]  That's worse. Their salt will have tricks that you can pick up on and you can pass back and forth. So so I
[08:03.100 --> 08:09.180]  Obviously, I'm an old-school guy, but I do respect the new school the the the crisper and the other things
[08:09.180 --> 08:11.980]  I don't know if I'm in a hurry to smoke
[08:12.780 --> 08:19.020]  Frankenweed, you know if it was genetic genetically modified but by sifting we are genetically modifying it
[08:19.020 --> 08:24.740]  Anyway, we're just using our intellect to go places, but we're not we're not going to be
[08:25.340 --> 08:28.100]  Cutting and pasting any genes in there
[08:28.700 --> 08:32.740]  The new way that they can do it. So I'm interested to looking
[08:33.300 --> 08:37.500]  Looking forward to what Felipe will have to give this guy is dope. He is great
[08:37.500 --> 08:43.220]  The everybody will just love that show the the new school and old school, too
[08:43.220 --> 08:47.460]  So I'm looking forward to seeing seeing what what comes out of these talks
[08:50.460 --> 08:52.740]  it's like you can bring people into a
[08:53.660 --> 08:59.620]  To a discussion that we have one-on-one when we go to a show like when I was at grow up or different things
[08:59.620 --> 09:03.220]  and you talk to a breeder, you know, you're talking the same lingo and
[09:03.940 --> 09:10.780]  It's it's nice to to let people in on that conversation to find out where and how we do what we do
[09:11.100 --> 09:16.580]  And you know, it's and it's what's really cool about it. Is is that there's there's actually
[09:17.300 --> 09:22.340]  It's a very niche thing but there is there's there's this amazing
[09:23.060 --> 09:25.060]  community of
[09:25.060 --> 09:31.620]  super passionate breeders out there like and we have a huge volume of them that follow us and that are part of our
[09:32.020 --> 09:36.500]  Community and and we have a lot of passionate home breeders a lot of people that just do it for the fun
[09:37.060 --> 09:41.060]  Right and and there's nothing and and and I love it and I love that community
[09:41.060 --> 09:44.900]  I love that group of people and and we do need a place to community
[09:44.900 --> 09:47.860]  We do need to sit down and have a chat like like let's talk about real
[09:47.860 --> 09:53.620]  It's through the stuff and let's get into and talk about what's happening new or maybe what's what's the old-school method?
[09:54.180 --> 10:00.660]  And what are the challenges that you guys are facing because like we said Renaissance we are going through a new phase
[10:00.660 --> 10:05.060]  And yeah, we didn't come up with it. We didn't invent it. You know as breeders
[10:05.060 --> 10:08.820]  We're just we're building where someone else left off
[10:10.900 --> 10:13.140]  So, you know it's like we will come in
[10:13.220 --> 10:18.260]  We'll get a strain that that someone hasn't messed with it with a long time and then something that's brand new
[10:18.420 --> 10:22.100]  And we'll cross them together and it'll make something that's never been on earth
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.660]  Right, so I do a lot of medical
[10:25.220 --> 10:26.340]  medical
[10:26.340 --> 10:32.100]  Pheno hunts and stuff and and doing that and I know there's people that that are more recreational
[10:32.100 --> 10:39.780]  I'm very medical and how I look I look for things that are calming that are maybe someone could use for a migraine
[10:39.780 --> 10:41.780]  I have one that i'm working on
[10:41.780 --> 10:48.340]  But other breeders have different different takes, you know, and so they go more for structure more for flavor more for that
[10:48.340 --> 10:54.100]  So it'll be nice to get into all of that and then to pass some information around where people can
[10:54.580 --> 10:58.340]  Can maybe use some of our methods to improve their their chops and breeding?
[11:00.500 --> 11:02.100]  And
[11:02.100 --> 11:08.100]  Break down some of those walls communicate and so that's what we're going to be doing here every two every Saturday at
[11:08.260 --> 11:14.580]  Every two every Saturday at 9 or 10 a.m. Depending on how early we can convince these breeders to get up
[11:17.060 --> 11:18.820]  Which will be a lot of fun
[11:18.820 --> 11:23.700]  Uh, so we got we we've talked about the breeders that are coming up at general plan and we just want to let everybody know
[11:23.700 --> 11:28.180]  Like sorry, uh, we don't have our first breeder here today. We have rebooked jinx
[11:28.660 --> 11:34.420]  And then what's what's we we do have a a super secret end show that we've been working on
[11:34.900 --> 11:37.540]  Um, so what's what's the end show because we do have a special
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.060]  finale of the season before christmas that we're going to drop on december 3rd and that everybody should should
[11:45.220 --> 11:48.340]  They should a watch every one of the episodes going up. They're only going to be an hour
[11:48.340 --> 11:52.020]  They're going to be every saturday at about 9 to 10 a.m. Sometime in there. They're going to start
[11:52.500 --> 11:55.380]  um, and you're going to come in and they're going to watch them and then and then
[11:56.020 --> 12:01.780]  So you're going to get to see all these fantastic breeders and then what happens on december 3rd the season finale there
[12:02.180 --> 12:07.780]  Well, then then everybody will will have everybody together with the brady bunch episode where we'll have uh,
[12:08.260 --> 12:14.740]  Five six seven people all on the same screen at one time and we can talk back and forth amongst ourselves
[12:14.740 --> 12:19.540]  You know people can say hey, what about the nine pound hammer? You know, how did you do that?
[12:19.860 --> 12:23.860]  What's the parents involved in that and tell us, you know, or just some, you know
[12:23.940 --> 12:28.820]  Cutting it up talking amongst ourselves and then that week too. It'll be nice
[12:28.900 --> 12:33.780]  What maybe we can uh squeeze into some some giveaway stuff or some prizes and stuff
[12:33.860 --> 12:36.820]  I just talked to remo the other day and he said oh, yeah
[12:36.820 --> 12:41.400]  Yeah, i'll send all kinds of prize boxes and stuff. So people are definitely
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.980]  A game for giving us stuff to give out during the thing
[12:45.060 --> 12:49.220]  Everybody loves loves a breeder because that's where they get the new the new treasure
[12:50.420 --> 12:52.420]  You should tell them to call me back
[12:52.980 --> 12:54.980]  While you're talking to them next time
[12:54.980 --> 12:56.980]  Okay
[12:57.860 --> 13:03.140]  I'll get it right now. You do it give him a yeah just bugger. No, I it's I I like bugged him a little while ago
[13:03.220 --> 13:06.580]  I got it. I gotta call him back again. Just do it. Yeah, but regardless bug him
[13:06.580 --> 13:11.620]  Anyways, just be like hey london london's following you. Yeah. Well, he's kind of like us our wives
[13:11.780 --> 13:16.180]  Uh do a little bit of our talking so maybe if you call her you'll get you'll get what you need
[13:16.740 --> 13:22.020]  Oh, I can send things you got stuff like I make I make I make bread
[13:22.340 --> 13:28.740]  I got things and stuff that I can do that's magical. But yes, um, so we will have a lot of fun things
[13:28.820 --> 13:30.820]  We'll probably do some giveaways on the late
[13:30.900 --> 13:34.660]  Uh the later end of that show i'm sure a lot of the breeders will a lot to get on
[13:34.900 --> 13:37.460]  We got pretty much most of the breeders are
[13:38.420 --> 13:39.620]  um
[13:39.620 --> 13:44.260]  On dagga dot garden already, but we do have one. That's pretty cool big name
[13:44.260 --> 13:49.780]  We have simon from serious seeds coming right? I don't think we mentioned that. Yeah, I talked I talked to him
[13:49.780 --> 13:53.140]  He's old school. Definitely. He's a guy. I really really respect
[13:53.620 --> 13:58.660]  He's he's uh been involved in some of the the foundation strains. He's got
[13:59.220 --> 14:06.340]  A freezer at home with with genetics that I sure wish I have but he probably wished he would i'm sending a couple of old
[14:06.900 --> 14:11.700]  Uh hay strains that he doesn't have back to him so he can have it in his collection
[14:11.860 --> 14:14.020]  But yeah, it'll be great to talk to simon
[14:14.420 --> 14:21.300]  He he's got a unique take on breeding like if you if you've checked on his his website you can get seeds
[14:21.620 --> 14:25.300]  But he only has I don't know 13 varieties. He doesn't have like a lot
[14:25.300 --> 14:29.460]  Some of these guys have like 13 varieties a week, you know, and
[14:32.180 --> 14:35.380]  He spends the time he spends the time to like
[14:36.020 --> 14:40.740]  Line breed these things out to the bitter end when you pa when you pop a 10 pack, you know
[14:40.740 --> 14:46.980]  you're gonna get the you know, nine or what he wanted you to have and and that's that that is a pretty amazing feat to
[14:47.300 --> 14:48.900]  get so
[14:48.900 --> 14:54.580]  It'll be great people will like hearing from him. He's an old school guy lives in the netherlands and uh,
[14:55.140 --> 14:57.700]  He'll be wonderful to talk to sweet gentlemen, too
[15:00.420 --> 15:03.540]  That is awesome and it is it is going to be one hell of a show
[15:03.540 --> 15:06.580]  We've been working on this like non-stop for the last little while
[15:07.300 --> 15:13.780]  Yeah, everybody's so busy so busy it's hard to like because you're we launched a show at harvest time
[15:14.260 --> 15:18.020]  Yeah, yeah, that's what kind of dumb. What the heck were we thinking?
[15:18.900 --> 15:22.580]  You know like a little bit not not the smartest thing but not a big deal either
[15:22.660 --> 15:25.460]  We're we're gonna we're gonna have some amazing people out there
[15:25.540 --> 15:29.940]  So tell me a little bit because what we'll do is i'll do another dab shot cam because that was cool
[15:30.020 --> 15:32.260]  And I want to do it again. It looked really pretty
[15:32.580 --> 15:35.300]  um, and then we'll and then we'll close out the show
[15:36.260 --> 15:37.540]  and uh
[15:37.540 --> 15:40.820]  And do a thing. Okay, so and I need to we got it
[15:40.900 --> 15:46.500]  We got a really cool piece of artwork coming for that. We'll make t-shirts at some point something fun like that. Um, but
[15:47.220 --> 15:52.900]  Tell me ron a little bit about um, because a lot of these episodes are going to be about you
[15:53.540 --> 15:57.780]  Right are not about you at all. They're not going to be they're going to be you interviewing someone else
[15:58.020 --> 16:02.340]  They're going to be totally aside from you. So let's take a moment and and talk about you
[16:02.820 --> 16:06.840]  Uh, so give me your give me the give me the ron harrington
[16:07.860 --> 16:09.220]  you know
[16:09.220 --> 16:15.620]  Not epic not too too epically long, but you know regular ron harrington story. Okay, I I breed
[16:16.340 --> 16:21.380]  About 30 lines at any one time 30 to 50 lines at any one time
[16:21.860 --> 16:25.540]  So i'm I have uh tested strains that I know
[16:26.340 --> 16:32.900]  Uh what i've been using and I know what traits they'll pass and like I got some that'll pass off cbg
[16:33.540 --> 16:41.060]  Other ones that'll make stuff shorter. I got stuff that'll strengthen stems different things. So I take these and breed them for for uh,
[16:42.100 --> 16:49.380]  mold and mildew resistance for structure and for everything so using these old strains that I know of i'm able to take new strains
[16:49.860 --> 16:51.860]  and cross them in a in a
[16:51.860 --> 16:53.860]  uh
[16:54.420 --> 16:56.420]  Like an r1 i'll reverse
[16:56.820 --> 17:01.540]  My strain or reverse their strain and put it on one of mine and then i'll grow out that
[17:01.780 --> 17:06.580]  Uh, and then i'll self it and then i'll grow out a fairly large population to see what I get
[17:07.060 --> 17:14.900]  and i'm able to uh sift certain traits in and out of different things that i'm breeding so by doing so many strains
[17:15.460 --> 17:16.820]  i'm able to
[17:16.820 --> 17:23.620]  To cover a lot of ground. It's like it's like if you got one year in prison versus 100 years in prison
[17:24.100 --> 17:26.980]  But you could do them concurrently or in order, right?
[17:27.060 --> 17:30.900]  So if you could do your 100 years in prison all and during the same year
[17:31.220 --> 17:36.980]  And so that's what when I do my breeding i'm breeding. Let's say 30 lines right now. I have 30 lines going
[17:37.540 --> 17:43.320]  They're all gonna get hit with feminized pollen from a particular two particular directions
[17:43.560 --> 17:45.560]  And then i'm able to grow those out
[17:46.200 --> 17:50.600]  and see what I get so so mainly that's the that's my story my
[17:51.480 --> 17:57.260]  Take on how I grow it and I usually try to stick with growing out a population of 140 to 300
[17:57.800 --> 18:03.400]  And usually in that amount depending on how stable it is what i'm working with i'm able to find everything I need
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.560]  And then I can truncate it and line breed it to where I want to go
[18:08.680 --> 18:11.980]  So that's me in a nut cam. All right a nutshell
[18:12.940 --> 18:19.180]  I'm i'm looking at your flower power that has to be that has to be that has to be the first
[18:19.740 --> 18:22.140]  ron harrington signature saying
[18:23.420 --> 18:25.420]  Is in your butt cam?
[18:25.980 --> 18:27.980]  In my in your butt cam the bud cam
[18:29.980 --> 18:32.460]  I've got a story about that, but you wouldn't want to hear
[18:33.820 --> 18:35.820]  No, maybe we'll skip the story
[18:37.100 --> 18:41.100]  You gotta hear this this is one of those things i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll
[18:41.500 --> 18:46.220]  I'll calm it down. But a friend of mine is a doctor who does
[18:47.480 --> 18:48.860]  colonoscopies
[18:48.860 --> 18:49.820]  and
[18:49.820 --> 18:51.580]  My wife is going. Oh
[18:51.580 --> 18:56.960]  But but he does colonoscopies and uh, it turns out that he was able to do my colonoscopy
[18:57.980 --> 19:04.940]  And when he did, uh, that that was that was a butt cam. So anyway, uh, I I would joke with him all the time
[19:05.260 --> 19:07.260]  Your friend did your colonoscopy?
[19:07.580 --> 19:11.660]  I feel like I don't know if I could be friends with the guy that does my colonoscopy. Yeah
[19:12.300 --> 19:13.260]  that
[19:13.260 --> 19:19.980]  Friends with you know, yeah, he was a friend at least I knew you know, he wasn't going to be doing any funny business
[19:20.060 --> 19:27.980]  so, you know, I I don't particularly enjoy the the the the colonoscopy but I had to have one is when I got w50 and
[19:28.060 --> 19:28.940]  now
[19:28.940 --> 19:33.820]  I'll wait a lot more. So anyway, why are we talking about that? There's much better things to talk about
[19:34.380 --> 19:39.740]  We're trying to give people good heads up on the type of segues that may happen during these shows
[19:40.300 --> 19:46.540]  Yeah, no, no, no, no butt cam, but we're gonna get a flower power cam a little dab cam with the little
[19:47.260 --> 19:50.620]  Whirly gig little cherries flying around in there. That's pretty cool
[19:51.180 --> 19:54.780]  Yeah, man, and I got the lens on there. So the angle's really good
[19:54.780 --> 19:57.820]  I just got to get it to actually like keep up with the camera
[19:59.500 --> 20:04.300]  Yeah, you gotta yeah, I got it
[20:04.700 --> 20:11.180]  Yeah, you you gotta yeah, there you go, it's like a little it's a little dab blender that you got going on there
[20:13.420 --> 20:16.780]  That's pretty uh, that's uh, whoever invented that should have patented it
[20:18.140 --> 20:21.980]  Yeah, there isn't they have a whole bunch of different styles that they do
[20:23.180 --> 20:24.540]  um
[20:24.540 --> 20:27.980]  I don't know if you could patent it man. It might be too simple
[20:28.620 --> 20:35.840]  It's like a glass bead that doesn't burn you could simple the method you could patent the methodology of building a specific
[20:36.220 --> 20:38.720]  Part of these tools, but I don't think you could individually
[20:39.580 --> 20:41.580]  patent like a marble
[20:41.820 --> 20:48.140]  Yeah, I wonder if they the balls spin around the opposite direction on the other side of the equator
[20:52.580 --> 20:56.740]  Because you you know what, you know when you flush the toilet, you know, it's an angle
[20:56.820 --> 21:02.180]  It's an angle thing because the holes are angled in it so it'll go whatever angle way you point the angle
[21:02.180 --> 21:03.860]  It's got nothing to do
[21:03.860 --> 21:05.860]  Okay, like it's not gravity
[21:06.580 --> 21:08.580]  gravity, uh spinning those
[21:14.910 --> 21:16.910]  But fun very fun so we got it we got it
[21:16.910 --> 21:20.030]  We got a show coming up where we're going to be doing tastings and stuff like that
[21:20.110 --> 21:25.870]  So we're gonna have lots of hashes and rosins and stuff like that. We'll have some new glass to check out
[21:25.950 --> 21:30.430]  So we'll have like the cams and and new fun stuff. It's a lot of exciting things
[21:30.910 --> 21:33.470]  Coming up on future cannabis project. Well, thanks ron
[21:34.030 --> 21:39.550]  It's unfortunate, but we weren't able to do the og show that we were planning, but we will be back
[21:40.670 --> 21:42.670]  next saturday
[21:42.670 --> 21:44.830]  And when we get the the wives
[21:45.470 --> 21:49.390]  In charge of the technology then then we're going to be able to get hooked up
[21:49.950 --> 21:54.430]  Fuck. Yeah, and next week we do next saturday. We do have doc ray
[21:54.990 --> 21:56.190]  Yep
[21:56.190 --> 22:01.150]  And he's a veteran focused farmer that's been doing it for a while and he's been featured on
[22:01.630 --> 22:04.510]  In places such as you know on burner's youtube channel
[22:04.990 --> 22:08.670]  Um with cookies and stuff like that. He's he's got some really cool stuff
[22:09.310 --> 22:15.630]  Um, so be back next week to see that episode and and and i'm sure you guys will have a great conversation about that
[22:16.110 --> 22:18.110]  uh, and i'm looking forward to uh
[22:18.910 --> 22:20.910]  Seeing you next week. Ciao brother
[22:21.790 --> 22:24.670]  I'll head to trim head back to trim jail
[22:25.310 --> 22:30.270]  Head back to trim jail. Yeah, I did I did trim jail for a little bit and now i'm I did hang jail
[22:30.430 --> 22:36.990]  And now I did like a partial harvest and then i'll probably do another harvest in two weeks after the stuff is done drying
[22:37.870 --> 22:39.870]  Great. Yeah, it goes well look
[23:07.820 --> 23:10.940]  There you go, okay, we're good then, huh?
[23:12.300 --> 23:14.540]  Yeah, yeah, we were that was good
[23:15.340 --> 23:18.940]  I hope that doesn't happen in the future. I hope our people show up
[23:21.660 --> 23:27.520]  It'll be fine we'll figure it out we can we can go an hour and chat me and you regardless
[23:27.980 --> 23:29.980]  Yeah, that probably happens the way
[23:30.940 --> 23:34.700]  It does here and there and and it can so it's not not a big deal
[23:34.780 --> 23:41.180]  You either yeah, the best thing you can do is just go on and do like a short episode or or do something
[23:41.740 --> 23:46.780]  Instead of absolutely nothing because people like get a little bit disappointed when you just go. Oh, never mind
[23:47.420 --> 23:54.220]  Yeah, you're gonna hop on do a chat do something and say something. Yeah, well we can get people we can get some people
[23:54.380 --> 24:00.220]  uh, uh lined up that if if we need to bring somebody in at the last minute, there'll be somebody that we can
[24:00.620 --> 24:04.140]  Can have like a backup dude. Yep. Like a backup guy
[24:04.940 --> 24:09.260]  I got a dude that I can that i'll put on my backup line and and we'll pull them out
