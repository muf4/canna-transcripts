[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  C-Tuesdays and T-Thursdays.
[00:03.600 --> 00:05.720]  And it's a real joke.
[00:05.720 --> 00:07.880]  Come out and take people's tractors,
[00:07.880 --> 00:10.120]  all the civil asset stuff.
[00:10.120 --> 00:11.920]  The civil asset forfeiture?
[00:11.920 --> 00:13.720]  Yeah.
[00:13.720 --> 00:16.000]  I think you're taking somebody's livelihood,
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.640]  and then you go and take their tractors or their generators.
[00:18.640 --> 00:21.080]  And that's just chicken shit.
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.580]  Right.
[00:21.580 --> 00:22.080]  All right.
[00:22.080 --> 00:23.480]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:23.480 --> 00:23.980]  Right.
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.400]  So all right, give me one second.
[00:25.400 --> 00:28.080]  Let me cue up the conversation.
[00:28.080 --> 00:34.600]  So we are now live on YouTube, and we're talking raids.
[00:34.600 --> 00:40.200]  And we have legacy growers from, let's see,
[00:40.200 --> 00:45.000]  we got Mendocino, Humboldt. What's Anza?
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.280]  That's San Bernardino County?
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.920]  No, Riverside County.
[00:48.920 --> 00:49.720]  Oh, Riverside.
[00:49.720 --> 00:50.560]  Right, right, right.
[00:50.560 --> 00:55.640]  And then Bam will be on in a minute, who's in Santa Cruz.
[00:55.640 --> 00:56.920]  That's me, Peter.
[00:56.920 --> 00:59.280]  And let's get started.
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.720]  So yeah, I mean, the kind of inspiration for this
[01:04.720 --> 01:09.320]  was Bam's monologue, because that, oh, here he comes.
[01:09.320 --> 01:09.920]  Outstanding.
[01:09.920 --> 01:12.240]  He is joining the conversation.
[01:12.240 --> 01:17.280]  So everybody give us one second so our full lineup can be here.
[01:17.280 --> 01:19.080]  Can you hear me?
[01:19.080 --> 01:19.600]  Big up.
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.280]  I can hear you.
[01:20.280 --> 01:21.280]  Can you hear me?
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.400]  I can hear you.
[01:23.400 --> 01:24.600]  Sorry for the wait.
[01:24.680 --> 01:26.720]  I just got home.
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.920]  No worries.
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.920]  I got to put Gemma to sleep in a couple minutes.
[01:31.920 --> 01:35.200]  So why don't I, let me pass it off to you to set the table
[01:35.200 --> 01:37.960]  and just kind of talk about what happened in Santa Cruz.
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.320]  And then we can open it up and go around the horn.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.880]  And we got a full Boston lineup tonight.
[01:46.880 --> 01:48.120]  Big up, big up.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.160]  Three of us.
[01:50.160 --> 01:53.680]  So Bam, take it away.
[01:53.920 --> 01:56.200]  So what happened a couple of days ago?
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.880]  And is that something new, or is that
[01:57.880 --> 02:00.560]  something that's kind of frequently been happening?
[02:00.560 --> 02:01.360]  Sure, yeah.
[02:01.360 --> 02:03.520]  So this has kind of been a pattern that's
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.640]  been going on in Santa Cruz County for a little while.
[02:07.640 --> 02:10.880]  A couple of days ago, the raids started up again.
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.400]  It's a continuation of what took place last year.
[02:16.400 --> 02:20.400]  I really feel that the Santa Cruz County Planning
[02:20.400 --> 02:22.200]  Department and Board of Supervisors
[02:22.200 --> 02:24.120]  have been really disingenuous.
[02:24.120 --> 02:27.920]  They have given a lot of people false hope
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.480]  about the prospect of licensing and spent
[02:31.480 --> 02:35.240]  an insane amount of time gathering community feedback
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.080]  through different mechanisms, such as the C4, which
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.960]  was like a community group that tried
[02:39.960 --> 02:43.880]  to take into account a lot of what people's concerns are,
[02:43.880 --> 02:48.120]  which I commend them for actually taking that step
[02:48.120 --> 02:51.640]  because I do think that community concerns are
[02:51.640 --> 02:52.280]  important.
[02:52.280 --> 02:56.680]  I'm not anti-regulation as a whole.
[02:56.680 --> 02:59.120]  I think regulation plays an important part.
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.760]  The problem becomes when regulation
[03:01.760 --> 03:10.480]  is used as a tool of power and monopolization
[03:10.480 --> 03:14.600]  of economic opportunity for a handful of people
[03:14.600 --> 03:17.360]  at the expense of many.
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.120]  So over the years, Santa Cruz County
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.160]  is, well, we used to be one of the more progressive counties
[03:25.160 --> 03:26.360]  when it came to cannabis.
[03:26.360 --> 03:28.400]  So that's why many people had actually
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.120]  chosen this as a place to homestead because under Prop
[03:32.120 --> 03:35.640]  215, they were more lenient.
[03:35.640 --> 03:38.720]  Don't forget that this is also one of the birthplaces
[03:38.720 --> 03:39.960]  of Prop 215.
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.840]  The WAM cases and the tone that was set by that
[03:44.920 --> 03:50.120]  was actually what I would argue was
[03:50.120 --> 03:57.360]  half the battle of legalization or normalization or regulation
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.120]  in California as we know it.
[04:01.120 --> 04:02.720]  Over the years, Santa Cruz County
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.840]  has done things like they had this program where they said,
[04:07.840 --> 04:11.720]  all right, everybody who is planning
[04:11.720 --> 04:15.160]  to get licensed at some point needs to register,
[04:15.160 --> 04:18.480]  pay a $500 fee, and then start paying
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.520]  a cap on our medical gross.
[04:24.520 --> 04:28.920]  The deal was that if you did register, when they finally
[04:28.920 --> 04:31.840]  got their act together and passed legislation, which
[04:31.840 --> 04:33.760]  kept getting planted down the line,
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.320]  that you would be eligible for a license.
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.160]  And whoever had it registered at that point
[04:41.160 --> 04:43.040]  wasn't going to be eligible.
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.560]  So they collected a lot of money and a lot of data
[04:47.560 --> 04:52.560]  during that time frame and kept telling us
[04:52.560 --> 04:54.720]  that legislation was coming, legislation was coming,
[04:54.720 --> 04:56.400]  legislation was coming.
[04:56.400 --> 04:59.760]  Legislation never arrived that was
[04:59.760 --> 05:02.720]  going to enable the vast majority of growers
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.360]  in the county to homestead.
[05:06.600 --> 05:13.200]  What took place was they made real estate barons
[05:13.200 --> 05:17.960]  in areas that were not traditionally the cultivation
[05:17.960 --> 05:19.880]  centers of the county.
[05:19.880 --> 05:23.040]  And I would argue not even the most ideal places
[05:23.040 --> 05:25.320]  for cannabis to be cultivated.
[05:25.320 --> 05:30.560]  In Watsonville and in the commercial ag sector.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.120]  So that's fine and dandy when you're
[05:32.120 --> 05:34.040]  dealing with artichokes and berries
[05:34.040 --> 05:40.160]  and the other ag industry that exists down in California.
[05:40.160 --> 05:43.800]  But it doesn't take into account the communities
[05:43.800 --> 05:46.800]  that have resided in the mountains for a really long
[05:46.800 --> 05:55.120]  time and have been a part of the California's cannabis history.
[05:55.120 --> 05:58.800]  So after dragging their feet and making us pay the fine,
[05:58.800 --> 06:01.920]  fines, the fees, the $500 fee, the registration,
[06:02.720 --> 06:07.760]  and then many of us paid our taxes while operating
[06:07.760 --> 06:10.560]  under the collective model, which was,
[06:10.560 --> 06:12.800]  which I found to be a sort of a scam because here we are,
[06:12.800 --> 06:16.480]  here they are collecting money from us,
[06:16.480 --> 06:19.360]  but not issuing a permit or license.
[06:19.360 --> 06:23.280]  So that seemed really disingenuous.
[06:23.280 --> 06:25.880]  Then afterwards, they passed a lot of legislation
[06:25.880 --> 06:29.720]  that kind of ignored the C4 committee recommendations
[06:29.720 --> 06:33.560]  and made it really impossible to get a license.
[06:33.560 --> 06:34.880]  Ridiculous.
[06:34.880 --> 06:40.080]  And I want to be clear that like some of these hurdles
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.480]  aren't necessarily from any one particular agency.
[06:45.480 --> 06:47.920]  The hurdles become an amalgamation
[06:47.920 --> 06:50.840]  of many different overlapping agencies.
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.240]  It seems like there's too many hands in the pot.
[06:55.240 --> 06:59.520]  And it seems to be something that is especially focused
[06:59.520 --> 07:01.840]  on targeting the cannabis industry,
[07:01.840 --> 07:06.040]  because I got tired of running in circles,
[07:06.040 --> 07:08.120]  trying to figure out how I'm going to get licensed.
[07:08.120 --> 07:12.600]  And when I started doing the map on what it was going to cost,
[07:12.600 --> 07:15.200]  you know, it started to add up.
[07:15.200 --> 07:17.160]  I don't know anybody in this county who's got a license
[07:17.160 --> 07:19.960]  in hand that hasn't spent more than $80,000
[07:19.960 --> 07:23.320]  or even more than that, 80,000 is on the low end.
[07:23.320 --> 07:29.480]  And I'm personally not trying to be some 10-acre grow
[07:29.480 --> 07:33.760]  that has hundreds of employees
[07:33.760 --> 07:37.640]  that can afford those kind of figures.
[07:37.640 --> 07:40.040]  I think that there are many farmers in the hills
[07:40.040 --> 07:43.080]  who just want to stick to being homesteaders.
[07:43.080 --> 07:45.920]  I have a small farm.
[07:45.920 --> 07:47.280]  I want to be able to run it.
[07:47.280 --> 07:48.560]  I want to be able to pay taxes.
[07:48.560 --> 07:51.800]  I want to continue to set standards for health and safety.
[07:51.800 --> 07:53.640]  I want to continue to be organic
[07:53.640 --> 07:57.040]  and pass all the required testing.
[07:57.040 --> 07:59.600]  But after being shut out of the market
[07:59.600 --> 08:03.760]  because of all the changes, first it was MRSA,
[08:03.760 --> 08:07.400]  then it was Prop 64.
[08:07.400 --> 08:10.120]  And then even after Prop 64 passed,
[08:10.120 --> 08:12.240]  Santa Cruz County didn't get their act together
[08:12.240 --> 08:15.120]  for licensing for almost a year and a half later.
[08:15.120 --> 08:19.640]  So for many of us who were working in this space,
[08:19.640 --> 08:23.560]  that was basically drying up our source of funding.
[08:23.560 --> 08:26.080]  So let's take us out of the game,
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.200]  not have an income for a year and a half to two years,
[08:30.200 --> 08:34.720]  and then suddenly have to come up with insane sums of money.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.120]  They're counting chickens before they're hatched
[08:38.120 --> 08:42.120]  based on projections, overly inflated projections
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.800]  that are often cited by law enforcement.
[08:44.800 --> 08:47.200]  You know, you hear some law enforcement,
[08:47.200 --> 08:48.360]  they find 100 pounds.
[08:48.360 --> 08:51.600]  Suddenly it's a million dollars worth of product.
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.520]  And I think that that's how they are.
[08:54.520 --> 08:57.400]  Those are the same figures that they are using
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.320]  to calculate what their fair share would be.
[09:02.320 --> 09:04.680]  That's not necessarily the ground reality.
[09:04.680 --> 09:08.720]  And I think that it's really important
[09:08.720 --> 09:10.880]  that that is one of the messages
[09:10.880 --> 09:14.480]  that I want non-candidates people to understand
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.040]  and understand how unfair the odds have been stacked
[09:20.720 --> 09:22.920]  against this particular industry.
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.360]  Could you imagine if being a nurse or being a doctor,
[09:27.360 --> 09:30.080]  while it requires an extensive amount of studying,
[09:31.720 --> 09:34.360]  could you imagine if the permits,
[09:34.360 --> 09:37.160]  the permitting process or the licensure process
[09:37.160 --> 09:41.760]  for other professions was as onerous and tedious,
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.200]  nothing would get done.
[09:44.160 --> 09:47.280]  And it's not an efficient outcome.
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.280]  So then the county passed this legislation
[09:53.840 --> 09:55.880]  which they said was kind of aimed,
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.600]  or was portrayed as being friendly.
[10:01.600 --> 10:04.040]  You know, it was supposed to be a mechanism
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.040]  where if they suspected that you were out of compliance,
[10:09.080 --> 10:11.560]  you would get a notice in the mail
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.600]  and you had seven days to respond to that complaint,
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.920]  and which you could defend yourself and say,
[10:21.920 --> 10:25.880]  you know, you're a medical collective or whatever.
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.680]  But there was a process where they could eventually abate,
[10:30.680 --> 10:34.760]  but you were given a chance to explain, react.
[10:34.760 --> 10:39.440]  And it was framed as bad actors would be fined
[10:39.440 --> 10:41.960]  for failure to comply and failure
[10:41.960 --> 10:45.280]  to respond to such notices.
[10:46.440 --> 10:47.840]  So it sounded pretty fair.
[10:47.840 --> 10:51.160]  It was like, okay, if we do our best
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.840]  and we try to be good actors
[10:54.840 --> 10:56.920]  while we go through this licensing thing,
[10:56.920 --> 10:58.440]  I have emails from the county that says
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.360]  that 500 square foot medical gardens are still tolerated.
[11:05.280 --> 11:07.400]  That's not, the enforcement arm is not,
[11:07.400 --> 11:09.480]  they didn't practice what they preached.
[11:10.560 --> 11:12.600]  In one hand, they told us that we need to be registered,
[11:12.600 --> 11:15.080]  we need to be in the process, we need to be applying.
[11:15.080 --> 11:18.600]  Then while we were in the process of applying
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.080]  and registering, suddenly they weren't accepting applications
[11:22.080 --> 11:23.840]  they weren't processing things.
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.040]  I have documented emails that go back and forth
[11:27.040 --> 11:28.400]  where on one hand I'm being told
[11:28.400 --> 11:30.080]  to bring them my application,
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.680]  and I have to beg, borrow money to come up with
[11:32.680 --> 11:35.760]  so that I could actually get the fees together.
[11:35.800 --> 11:37.560]  And then when I go down to the office,
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.640]  they're like, oh, we're not processing applications.
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.920]  So this isn't an example of a bunch of outlaws
[11:43.920 --> 11:47.360]  in the mountains trying to dodge regulations.
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.000]  A bunch of individuals who are really trying
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.120]  and have been trying for a number of years
[11:53.360 --> 11:58.360]  to work with their system and be in compliance.
[11:58.840 --> 12:03.320]  And after following all the recommendations
[12:03.320 --> 12:06.960]  and being told that they were gonna tolerate five scripts,
[12:06.960 --> 12:09.200]  100 square foot per script and patient,
[12:10.080 --> 12:13.280]  the same legislation also had a fine mechanism.
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.320]  And the fine mechanism, they basically said $2,500
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.480]  on the first offense for each of the three various charges
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.560]  that they could give you.
[12:21.560 --> 12:24.920]  One was for cultivation, one was for manufacturing
[12:24.920 --> 12:26.760]  and one was for distribution.
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.840]  So, and that's just from the cannabis licensing office.
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.360]  That's not all the code enforcement and red tag money
[12:34.360 --> 12:36.680]  that they had been trying to seek.
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.480]  So what they did was they basically showed up
[12:40.480 --> 12:41.440]  at a bunch of properties.
[12:41.440 --> 12:43.200]  A lot of the warrants are being challenged
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.480]  because they were nonsense.
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.880]  They were using outdated Google imagery from Prop 215.
[12:48.880 --> 12:53.360]  And in one of the warrants that were served
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.600]  on my property last year,
[12:55.600 --> 12:57.280]  they showed a picture of my greenhouse
[12:57.280 --> 12:58.760]  and all you saw was empty pots.
[12:58.760 --> 13:00.480]  And they found an old newspaper article
[13:01.120 --> 13:03.200]  for when I was working on the highest grade
[13:03.200 --> 13:06.280]  where I talk about licensing my extraction technology.
[13:06.280 --> 13:08.000]  For some reason that met the litmus test
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.440]  for saying that I'm commercially cultivating,
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.000]  even though at the end of Prop 64,
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.720]  we had shut down our lab and we had shut down our operations
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.040]  which at the time was operating in compliance.
[13:20.040 --> 13:22.000]  So then they came out to everybody's properties
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.520]  and nobody got a letter.
[13:23.520 --> 13:26.200]  I don't know a single person that got one of these letters
[13:26.200 --> 13:28.960]  that was supposed to be the seven day notice letters
[13:28.960 --> 13:30.480]  where you had a chance to respond.
[13:30.480 --> 13:32.400]  They show up with warrants in some cases
[13:32.400 --> 13:34.360]  and other cases no warrants
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.360]  and just start chopping and citing.
[13:38.360 --> 13:39.840]  And everybody that I know got hit
[13:39.840 --> 13:42.280]  with like a $7,500 fine
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.680]  because they were charging you with all of the above.
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.680]  And the police were acting like judge, jury and executioner.
[13:50.680 --> 13:55.680]  And so there's this pattern of abuse and willful neglect
[13:57.680 --> 13:59.520]  of like the same protocols and procedures
[13:59.520 --> 14:03.600]  that they are saying is the law,
[14:03.600 --> 14:06.080]  but only picking and choosing the selective parts
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.680]  of the law that work for them in terms of raising capital.
[14:10.680 --> 14:14.680]  And that happened last year
[14:14.680 --> 14:16.480]  and a bunch of us started to fight it.
[14:16.480 --> 14:17.720]  And we were like, okay,
[14:18.200 --> 14:19.280]  that happened last year
[14:19.280 --> 14:21.160]  and a bunch of us started to fight it.
[14:21.160 --> 14:22.880]  Some people foolishly settled
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.320]  and I'll say foolishly settled because they were scared
[14:26.320 --> 14:27.160]  and I don't blend them.
[14:27.160 --> 14:28.120]  I understand the fear.
[14:28.120 --> 14:30.400]  I've lived through the experience
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.920]  of having these jackasses come on your property
[14:32.920 --> 14:34.600]  and they treat you like dogs
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.120]  and they ransack and rummage through everything
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.960]  that you have and they destroy all your hard work.
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.520]  I have like over 10 to 15 years worth of seeds
[14:43.520 --> 14:46.320]  that I've been collecting and working on that they stole.
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.560]  And so there was a bunch of ways that we could fight back.
[14:52.560 --> 14:54.920]  First, there was, and they're operating
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.200]  in this weird nexus of administrative law,
[14:58.200 --> 15:00.600]  civil law and criminal law.
[15:00.600 --> 15:04.880]  And they all have their own set of rules
[15:04.880 --> 15:08.000]  and you have your own set of rights.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.480]  And in my opinion, administrative law
[15:10.480 --> 15:12.680]  is where we have the least amount of rights
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.680]  because it's almost like a kangaroo court.
[15:17.680 --> 15:22.680]  The same people that are trying to come after you
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.000]  and find you wind up being the people
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.960]  who are holding these tribunals.
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.280]  It's not an independent tribunal.
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.400]  So a lot of us have challenged it
[15:34.400 --> 15:35.840]  and there are ways that you can force it
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.480]  out of administrative into civil.
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.440]  And some of us have done that.
[15:41.440 --> 15:44.920]  And my case is still pending.
[15:44.920 --> 15:47.440]  And a couple other people that I know
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.160]  still have pending cases.
[15:49.160 --> 15:54.080]  But this year, what they did was they upped the ante
[15:54.080 --> 15:56.800]  on all of the fines and fees.
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.800]  And so aside from the $2,500 per charge
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.680]  administrative citation fee,
[16:05.680 --> 16:09.800]  now they're also tacking on like $10 per gram of product,
[16:09.800 --> 16:13.360]  whether it's flour, concentrate and $100 per plant.
[16:14.440 --> 16:16.160]  So it just becomes more and more
[16:16.160 --> 16:20.640]  of an extraction method for finances.
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.680]  The email that was sent out by Ben Rice's law office
[16:24.680 --> 16:26.920]  was saying that in one case,
[16:26.920 --> 16:30.520]  a grower had almost a million dollars in fines.
[16:32.240 --> 16:34.400]  And so they're spending all this money on enforcement
[16:34.400 --> 16:37.320]  trying to collect money from people that don't have money.
[16:37.320 --> 16:40.480]  So on the books, they can report the issue
[16:41.400 --> 16:43.160]  multimillion dollars worth of fines.
[16:43.160 --> 16:45.480]  I'd like to see how many people are actually
[16:45.480 --> 16:47.640]  going to cough up that sum of money
[16:47.640 --> 16:49.280]  and where they're gonna get it from
[16:49.280 --> 16:51.520]  becomes a whole other question.
[16:51.520 --> 16:54.160]  So this year, the tactics have changed a little bit more.
[16:54.160 --> 16:57.400]  Aside from raising all the fees
[16:57.400 --> 17:01.880]  that they are able to leverage in terms of citations,
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.320]  they've also edited all the rules
[17:03.320 --> 17:07.520]  about the appeals process
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.000]  and just turned it into a bigger kangaroo court.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.200]  Now they get to decide what is evidence
[17:14.200 --> 17:15.720]  and what isn't evidence.
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.720]  And they've narrowed the scope
[17:21.360 --> 17:23.640]  of what constitutes an appeal.
[17:23.640 --> 17:26.680]  It becomes this situation
[17:26.680 --> 17:28.880]  where you have to reach into your pockets
[17:28.880 --> 17:31.200]  deeper than ever to defend
[17:31.200 --> 17:33.640]  because in order to acquire justice,
[17:33.640 --> 17:36.560]  you need to spend a ton of money and lobby.
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.560]  And that becomes an injustice when you're running around
[17:41.960 --> 17:44.320]  and crippling people financially.
[17:44.320 --> 17:47.440]  And they've been doing so for a number of years
[17:47.440 --> 17:48.840]  and add to it.
[17:48.840 --> 17:53.040]  So in one of the cases that I know that took place
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.240]  the other day, they showed up on the property
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.080]  after going to serving warrants at other properties,
[17:59.080 --> 18:00.960]  and they knew that there was some guy
[18:00.960 --> 18:03.840]  who they claimed had a lot of infrastructure
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.920]  on this property.
[18:04.920 --> 18:07.240]  That was basically the evidence.
[18:07.240 --> 18:09.520]  He had a lot of infrastructure on this property.
[18:09.520 --> 18:11.920]  So they knew that he was cultivating
[18:11.920 --> 18:14.240]  and he had two options.
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.320]  One, he could self abate with them right now
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.640]  and let them onto his property
[18:18.640 --> 18:20.880]  and let them cut down all his plants,
[18:20.880 --> 18:24.000]  or they were just gonna go and get one of these
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.440]  kangaroo judges to sign off on these nonsensical
[18:27.440 --> 18:29.960]  search warrants and then come back
[18:29.960 --> 18:34.960]  and issue thousands and thousands of dollars in fines.
[18:36.120 --> 18:39.160]  So that was one of the stories that took place.
[18:39.160 --> 18:40.840]  That's why I was really being adamant
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.640]  about people not contemplating searches.
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.040]  So what, if they tell you that they're coming back,
[18:48.040 --> 18:49.720]  it's gonna take them like three to five days
[18:49.720 --> 18:52.520]  to get that search warrant, if it's even granted.
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.800]  And in that time, if you are out of compliance,
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.280]  use it wisely and get into compliance,
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.320]  but don't roll over and keep empowering them
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.320]  because every time they get to cut down a bunch of plants,
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.120]  they get to spend a bunch of tax dollars
[19:10.120 --> 19:12.840]  on their hazard pay or overtime hours
[19:12.840 --> 19:14.880]  or whatever fees they're getting
[19:14.880 --> 19:17.040]  to come out onto your property,
[19:17.040 --> 19:19.000]  which is just adding to their bottom line.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.640]  And then they get to tell the story that,
[19:20.640 --> 19:23.680]  oh, we eradicated this, that, and the third
[19:23.680 --> 19:26.880]  and looked at all these bad actors.
[19:26.880 --> 19:29.720]  And based on the conversations with the people
[19:29.720 --> 19:31.920]  that I have spoken to that have been rated,
[19:33.320 --> 19:35.920]  they're not going anywhere and it's gonna get worse.
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.680]  And that's what I was warning people about last year,
[19:38.680 --> 19:40.200]  based on other conversations.
[19:40.200 --> 19:41.640]  A lot of the people that I know that settled
[19:41.640 --> 19:43.840]  with the county were told the same thing.
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.280]  Yeah, expect a visit next year.
[19:45.280 --> 19:46.560]  This is just gonna get worse.
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.560]  We're gonna turn up.
[19:47.560 --> 19:48.440]  They didn't call it worse,
[19:48.440 --> 19:49.680]  because for them it's better,
[19:49.680 --> 19:51.320]  but they said that we're going to be active
[19:51.320 --> 19:53.080]  and we're gonna be coming back.
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.320]  And that was the same message
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.000]  that was being sent out the other day,
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.400]  that like, this is just the start.
[19:58.400 --> 20:00.920]  And if you read a lot of the headlines
[20:00.920 --> 20:03.480]  and hear what comes out of their mouth,
[20:03.480 --> 20:04.760]  they're trying to say that,
[20:04.760 --> 20:06.920]  they're trying to blame a lot of their like,
[20:06.920 --> 20:09.600]  lack of a windfall financially
[20:09.600 --> 20:13.760]  on traditional market actors who are not licensed.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.240]  Well, it's kind of a catch-22.
[20:15.240 --> 20:17.040]  If you're not gonna license anybody,
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.040]  you think that 40 old growers in the hill
[20:22.040 --> 20:26.160]  are gonna suddenly line up to get 15, $20 an hour jobs,
[20:26.160 --> 20:29.120]  working for some cannabis factory.
[20:30.120 --> 20:32.280]  That just doesn't happen.
[20:34.040 --> 20:37.320]  And so what I would like to see
[20:37.320 --> 20:42.320]  is a real concerted effort at the local level.
[20:42.320 --> 20:45.320]  And I wanna see a lot more grassroots organization
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.240]  amongst growers so that we can really work
[20:47.240 --> 20:52.000]  to achieve the change that we would like to see.
[20:52.960 --> 20:55.160]  And I think a lot of that is gonna begin with us first,
[20:55.160 --> 21:00.160]  just compiling a database and start to analyze the tools
[21:01.760 --> 21:04.720]  and the constructs of power that they are leveraging.
[21:04.720 --> 21:07.280]  Because if you look across the state,
[21:07.280 --> 21:10.400]  if I wanna talk to county growers from different counties,
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.280]  everybody has a different experience.
[21:12.280 --> 21:13.560]  Some people are mad at the state,
[21:13.560 --> 21:17.000]  some people are mad at the county.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.560]  People are being frustrated at different points.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.480]  And the stories aren't the same.
[21:23.520 --> 21:27.440]  What one county is using as a means of stonewalling
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.280]  and preventing any progress for growers
[21:30.280 --> 21:33.440]  isn't the same tool that is being deployed
[21:34.280 --> 21:35.280]  in other counties.
[21:35.280 --> 21:38.560]  And some people are mad at Prop 64.
[21:38.560 --> 21:39.960]  I don't like Prop 64,
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.520]  but the state's regulations have yet to stand in my way.
[21:44.800 --> 21:48.720]  And from my experience dealing with the Ag Department
[21:48.720 --> 21:49.800]  and with hemp licensing,
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.200]  which was the route that I went to in the meantime,
[21:53.120 --> 21:54.960]  it was pretty straightforward
[21:54.960 --> 21:59.560]  and it wasn't too onerous financially.
[21:59.560 --> 22:02.400]  I would like to see that sort of same type of policies
[22:02.400 --> 22:03.640]  being applied to cannabis
[22:03.640 --> 22:05.480]  and see cannabis treated as a crop
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.960]  rather than something special.
[22:10.960 --> 22:15.360]  It's a crop and it should be treated as such
[22:15.360 --> 22:20.360]  so that more economic opportunity can be had.
[22:20.400 --> 22:22.200]  And it really pisses me off when they say that,
[22:22.200 --> 22:26.160]  oh, this is gonna be great for the economy.
[22:26.160 --> 22:27.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.720]  So let's take away a thousand,
[22:28.720 --> 22:30.720]  a hundred thousand dollar a year jobs
[22:30.720 --> 22:35.560]  and replace them with $2,015, $20 an hour jobs.
[22:37.280 --> 22:39.160]  How is that good for the economy?
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.720]  And I think that one of the things that bugs me too
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.800]  is that a lot of business owners
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.080]  who have for a long time benefited
[22:46.080 --> 22:50.600]  from the presence of grower populations remain silent.
[22:50.600 --> 22:53.160]  They're scared to rock the boat.
[22:53.160 --> 22:56.320]  They're scared to, and the ones that I've pressed about it,
[22:56.320 --> 22:59.840]  like, hey, your business is down huge
[22:59.840 --> 23:02.080]  because of the action of the county.
[23:04.080 --> 23:07.400]  They admit that they're scared to rock the boat.
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.120]  And the few times that they have broached the subject
[23:10.120 --> 23:13.640]  with the politicians is politicians just tell them
[23:14.640 --> 23:17.720]  to hold on, it's gonna get better, it's gonna change.
[23:17.720 --> 23:21.120]  But bad policy that continues to be enforced
[23:21.120 --> 23:22.680]  isn't what do they think?
[23:22.680 --> 23:26.080]  They're gonna keep fighting all like the mountain growers
[23:26.080 --> 23:27.320]  out of existence.
[23:27.320 --> 23:29.480]  And then suddenly everybody's gonna be lining up
[23:29.480 --> 23:34.160]  for $90, eights of commercial craft.
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.400]  Like, I don't see that.
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.760]  I don't see that happening.
[23:40.080 --> 23:41.400]  I don't wanna see that happen.
[23:41.400 --> 23:43.080]  So that's part of my bias.
[23:44.640 --> 23:47.720]  I would like to, and I'm not one of those people
[23:47.720 --> 23:49.800]  that thinks that those people can't exist.
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.800]  You got Budweiser's and you got microboobs.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.800]  And I think that we should be encouraging choice
[24:01.800 --> 24:05.200]  and options and opportunities, not limiting them,
[24:05.200 --> 24:10.200]  not artificially creating oligarchs and monopolies
[24:11.200 --> 24:15.440]  by onerous regulations and huge hurdles.
[24:19.520 --> 24:21.120]  Yeah, that's.
[24:21.120 --> 24:21.960]  All right.
[24:23.280 --> 24:25.920]  Setting the table in Santa Cruz.
[24:25.920 --> 24:28.000]  Why don't we just go around?
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.640]  Dan, you wanna kind of talk about what you've been seeing
[24:30.640 --> 24:33.240]  in Humboldt this season and any thoughts you have
[24:33.240 --> 24:34.080]  and while you're doing it.
[24:34.080 --> 24:36.160]  So I also muted everybody.
[24:36.160 --> 24:38.120]  So when you wanna talk, just unmute yourself.
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.960]  I'm gonna go put Gemma to sleep.
[24:40.880 --> 24:44.280]  She definitely has not followed my instructions
[24:44.280 --> 24:46.200]  of brushing her teeth and getting ready for bed.
[24:46.200 --> 24:50.840]  But Dan, I'm gonna unmute you, take it away
[24:50.840 --> 24:52.680]  and I'll be back in five.
[24:55.960 --> 24:57.560]  Yeah, hey, what's up everybody?
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.320]  Yeah, sorry to hear about that, Bam.
[25:01.320 --> 25:03.080]  You know, that really sucks.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.160]  I know that you are a person who as a grower
[25:07.160 --> 25:10.280]  and someone in cannabis has really incredible intentions
[25:10.280 --> 25:12.760]  and you are the exact type of person
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.040]  who should be able to be able to obtain licensing,
[25:17.800 --> 25:20.520]  for the benefit of consumers and really everything.
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.560]  Humboldt is a really unique place in that
[25:23.560 --> 25:27.120]  there's so much history and so much culture there.
[25:29.120 --> 25:32.200]  The economic impacts that a place like Santa Cruz
[25:32.200 --> 25:34.920]  has probably felt from growers in the hills,
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.880]  you know, being shut off and having an enforcement.
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.600]  In Humboldt, if that really truly ever happened,
[25:43.600 --> 25:45.480]  there'd be nothing left.
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.560]  And, you know, the politics there is also bullshit.
[25:49.560 --> 25:53.040]  I mean, there's never gonna be anything that's perfect
[25:53.040 --> 25:55.600]  but cannabis is for the people.
[25:55.600 --> 25:58.360]  And when you basically take that control away from us
[25:58.360 --> 26:01.320]  and you put in government regulations,
[26:01.320 --> 26:03.240]  who's creating those regulations?
[26:03.560 --> 26:05.000]  Are you reaching out to the people
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  who are the producers and the consumers?
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.600]  Are you reaching out to the experts
[26:08.600 --> 26:10.040]  or are you getting some slick talk
[26:10.040 --> 26:13.720]  from the fancy consultants and more fucking rich people?
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.400]  So, you know, my experience with legal weed is
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.440]  I thought Prop 64 was a horribly written law.
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.720]  I think in 2010, Prop 19 was even worse.
[26:28.640 --> 26:31.040]  And I would never have encouraged that passing.
[26:31.040 --> 26:33.760]  You know, the 215, it's like,
[26:33.760 --> 26:35.320]  you look at it from both sides.
[26:35.320 --> 26:37.400]  I mean, it was great for opportunity
[26:37.400 --> 26:40.880]  but there was still so much that was really undecided.
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.080]  And, you know, you could talk to judges and legislators
[26:45.080 --> 26:46.960]  in different areas and get different opinions
[26:46.960 --> 26:48.680]  from different attorneys.
[26:48.680 --> 26:52.040]  But anyway, I'm super lit.
[26:52.040 --> 26:54.640]  So excuse me if I'm rambling a little bit, but yeah.
[26:54.640 --> 26:56.080]  Humboldt has so much of a culture
[26:56.080 --> 26:58.400]  and I just knew that I had to find a way
[26:58.400 --> 27:00.040]  to get a license for myself
[27:00.040 --> 27:02.920]  because I really don't know how I would survive
[27:02.920 --> 27:06.440]  if I couldn't do really the only thing that I've ever done.
[27:06.440 --> 27:07.920]  And I fucking worked hard for it.
[27:07.920 --> 27:11.440]  You know, it's like, if you wanna have a career
[27:11.440 --> 27:13.160]  as a doctor or something like that,
[27:13.160 --> 27:14.920]  you gotta take school pretty serious.
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.080]  You gotta do good in school.
[27:16.080 --> 27:17.920]  You gotta get to college, you know,
[27:17.920 --> 27:19.560]  fucking master's degrees.
[27:19.560 --> 27:20.840]  That's a lot of commitment.
[27:20.840 --> 27:23.640]  You know, as a grower, if you put that into it
[27:23.640 --> 27:27.160]  and you're threatened with that having taken away from you,
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.160]  you know, it's devastating to think about.
[27:30.160 --> 27:33.960]  And, you know, my licensing challenges,
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.160]  I could go on and on for days.
[27:36.160 --> 27:37.600]  It's all been very unfortunate,
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.640]  but I've been able to just fight and fight
[27:39.640 --> 27:40.920]  and push through.
[27:40.920 --> 27:43.480]  Humboldt, what they did, it's just unspeakable
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.120]  because anyone who's been up there, you know,
[27:46.120 --> 27:48.920]  in the last seven years, you know,
[27:48.920 --> 27:52.600]  it was really the peak and the epicenter of cultivation
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.600]  in Northern California.
[27:54.600 --> 27:58.200]  And what they started doing
[27:58.200 --> 28:02.320]  is handing out abatement notices, you know, the other year.
[28:02.320 --> 28:03.800]  And, you know, it was bullshit.
[28:03.800 --> 28:07.200]  They were threatening people with $10,000 per day fines.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.720]  You know, it's just, the problem is
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.200]  they didn't like the transplants and the Green Rush people
[28:12.200 --> 28:14.960]  who came up and were fucking butchering up properties
[28:14.960 --> 28:17.480]  and doing a lot of dozer work and growing a ton of weed
[28:17.480 --> 28:19.280]  and sending it out of state.
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.760]  And I understand that, you know,
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.240]  but there's also this rich heritage
[28:23.240 --> 28:25.160]  of actual mom and pop growers
[28:25.160 --> 28:28.360]  and people who fucking are multi-generational families
[28:28.360 --> 28:29.880]  who's, you know, homesteaded
[28:29.880 --> 28:32.280]  and raised their families on that land.
[28:32.280 --> 28:34.440]  And those people are getting threatened, you know,
[28:34.440 --> 28:37.880]  $10,000 a day by the county.
[28:37.880 --> 28:39.040]  And so what it ended up doing,
[28:39.040 --> 28:40.480]  I mean, there's people who resisted it
[28:40.480 --> 28:42.360]  and there's people who fought with it.
[28:43.880 --> 28:45.560]  But, you know, just like I think
[28:45.560 --> 28:47.360]  what we're seeing all over the state,
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.640]  all over the country, and eventually all over the world
[28:49.640 --> 28:52.720]  is the people who are gonna be able to obtain these licenses
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.400]  are the people with the most power,
[28:54.400 --> 28:56.640]  political connections and the most money.
[28:56.640 --> 28:59.880]  And that's just fucking how it is and it's bullshit.
[29:01.240 --> 29:05.120]  And my whole thing is, if you can't beat them,
[29:05.120 --> 29:07.520]  learn to be better than them, you know?
[29:07.520 --> 29:10.880]  And so I really devoted a lot of my life to that.
[29:10.880 --> 29:11.920]  It's been fucking hard.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.280]  It's taken me less, you know,
[29:14.280 --> 29:16.880]  it's taken me away from my connections to the plant
[29:16.880 --> 29:18.960]  and the work that I was trying to do with genetics
[29:18.960 --> 29:21.080]  and made me focus more of my time
[29:21.080 --> 29:23.000]  on just learning a bunch of bullshit.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.800]  I hate all the compliance, you know?
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.560]  It's something that, you know, even today,
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.160]  you know, it's like, it's going,
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.160]  but I just, it's like, I'll get an email,
[29:33.160 --> 29:35.920]  CDFA, this, that, and the other, and it has to happen.
[29:35.920 --> 29:37.040]  It's already there and it's done,
[29:37.040 --> 29:38.880]  but it just stops me in my tracks, man.
[29:38.880 --> 29:43.240]  It's the one Achilles heel that, you know,
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.880]  that I hate the most about everything that we're doing.
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.400]  And so, you know, Humboldt,
[29:48.400 --> 29:50.440]  people filed lawsuits against the county.
[29:52.080 --> 29:54.880]  And there were certain interpretations and language
[29:54.880 --> 29:56.960]  that the county had made and previously changed.
[29:56.960 --> 29:59.160]  It's just basically all a bunch of bullshit.
[29:59.160 --> 30:01.280]  You know, I try to stay out of politics
[30:01.280 --> 30:02.800]  because it's all so upsetting to me
[30:02.800 --> 30:05.000]  because none of it really just seems fair.
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.680]  And, you know, who's going to be the one
[30:06.680 --> 30:08.360]  to decide what's fair anyway.
[30:11.480 --> 30:13.880]  And then, you know, there's a new sheriff
[30:13.880 --> 30:16.080]  in the last several years in Humboldt.
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.760]  And, you know, I think they did realize
[30:17.760 --> 30:19.720]  the economic impact it would have
[30:20.040 --> 30:21.280]  from shutting all these people down
[30:21.280 --> 30:23.000]  and all the pushback and the lawsuits
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.120]  and the fact that they were probably
[30:24.120 --> 30:25.400]  going to lose these lawsuits
[30:25.400 --> 30:27.440]  and have continued fucking lawsuits.
[30:27.440 --> 30:29.200]  And, you know, they said something
[30:29.200 --> 30:31.280]  about not targeting people that have
[30:31.280 --> 30:33.280]  under a certain square footage.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.360]  And I mean, they don't have the fucking resources,
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.200]  even with all the money they get from licensing,
[30:37.200 --> 30:39.920]  they don't have the resources to go out in the hills,
[30:39.920 --> 30:42.720]  you know, and stop everybody.
[30:42.720 --> 30:45.520]  But what Humboldt County did, which is really fucked up,
[30:45.520 --> 30:46.480]  is a couple of years ago,
[30:46.480 --> 30:49.600]  they contracted a private satellite company.
[30:50.480 --> 30:52.040]  And they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
[30:52.040 --> 30:53.600]  on taxpayer money.
[30:53.600 --> 30:56.120]  And they hired this company to just, you know,
[30:56.120 --> 30:59.320]  basically give live reporting on what they're seeing,
[30:59.320 --> 31:00.720]  you know, and that's how they were able
[31:00.720 --> 31:01.960]  to enforce these abatements.
[31:01.960 --> 31:03.560]  Sorry if I was getting off track.
[31:04.680 --> 31:06.680]  So what they did was they're getting live reports.
[31:06.680 --> 31:09.120]  And when they see that you have evidence of plants,
[31:09.120 --> 31:11.160]  even greenhouses in some cases,
[31:11.160 --> 31:13.080]  they'd send out these abatement notices,
[31:13.080 --> 31:15.000]  you shut down $10,000 a day.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.360]  And, you know, for a couple of years,
[31:17.360 --> 31:18.640]  it was really impactful.
[31:19.560 --> 31:23.240]  I mean, it really kind of changed the, you know,
[31:23.240 --> 31:25.280]  it just changed the county.
[31:25.280 --> 31:27.360]  A lot of people couldn't afford to live there.
[31:27.360 --> 31:28.760]  A lot of people had to leave.
[31:28.760 --> 31:30.560]  A lot of people sold their properties.
[31:30.560 --> 31:32.840]  And guess who came in and guess who took over
[31:32.840 --> 31:34.160]  a lot of those properties?
[31:34.160 --> 31:36.800]  Established motherfuckers with a lot of money,
[31:36.800 --> 31:38.760]  people who already own a ton of land
[31:38.760 --> 31:41.760]  and can establish more licenses.
[31:41.760 --> 31:46.200]  And so, you know, it's all just unfortunate.
[31:46.200 --> 31:47.600]  There's even people,
[31:47.600 --> 31:50.120]  and this is the one thing, it's like,
[31:50.120 --> 31:52.240]  the county doesn't want bad PR.
[31:52.240 --> 31:53.560]  And they were targeting people
[31:53.560 --> 31:55.240]  with these hoop houses and greenhouses.
[31:55.240 --> 31:57.200]  And people are like, look, here's evidence.
[31:57.200 --> 31:59.480]  I'm fucking growing vegetables in here.
[31:59.480 --> 32:00.680]  There's no fucking weed here.
[32:00.680 --> 32:02.440]  There hasn't been any in a long time.
[32:02.440 --> 32:04.120]  I'm growing food that I eat
[32:04.120 --> 32:08.120]  and you're threatening me with $10,000 a day, you know?
[32:08.120 --> 32:10.440]  So what they do is, you know,
[32:10.440 --> 32:12.880]  they keep people who don't have a lot of means
[32:12.880 --> 32:15.440]  living in fear and uncertainty.
[32:15.480 --> 32:18.840]  And I wish there was a more fair way.
[32:18.840 --> 32:20.160]  I mean, I always say some shit.
[32:20.160 --> 32:22.080]  I'm not especially religious,
[32:22.080 --> 32:23.080]  but what I would say is like,
[32:23.080 --> 32:26.840]  say there was some religious power of the universe.
[32:26.840 --> 32:30.600]  Who would decide who gets to grow cannabis and who doesn't?
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.720]  A lot of people want to grow cannabis for a lot of reasons.
[32:33.720 --> 32:35.800]  Who's able to like dive into your soul
[32:35.800 --> 32:37.200]  and pick the people who are worthy
[32:37.200 --> 32:39.960]  because of their intentions and their values.
[32:39.960 --> 32:43.840]  That's the perfect scenario, but that doesn't exist.
[32:43.840 --> 32:48.840]  And, you know, I think that cannabis policies,
[32:49.480 --> 32:54.480]  politics, you know, legislation, even culture,
[32:55.280 --> 32:57.960]  all of that shit isn't really headed in the direction
[32:57.960 --> 32:59.880]  that I would have liked to see it go,
[32:59.880 --> 33:01.480]  you know, when we have Legal Weed.
[33:01.480 --> 33:03.920]  Legal Weed is an opportunity to teach people
[33:03.920 --> 33:06.560]  what was so special about it, you know?
[33:06.560 --> 33:08.800]  Why we all wanted to be involved with it.
[33:08.800 --> 33:11.920]  Instead, it's all just fucking a lot of cheesy bullshit.
[33:12.800 --> 33:16.680]  But, you know, like I said, it's really about,
[33:19.440 --> 33:22.160]  you know, just continuing to fucking do our thing
[33:22.160 --> 33:25.840]  and fight through it and have these types of discussions.
[33:28.860 --> 33:30.180]  And I'm gonna pass the mic.
[33:31.580 --> 33:34.740]  I wanna respond to some of the things that you said.
[33:34.740 --> 33:35.580]  Go for it.
[33:37.940 --> 33:42.940]  That religious, whatever exists, it's us, dude.
[33:43.220 --> 33:45.100]  It's us.
[33:45.100 --> 33:46.620]  We need to set the pace.
[33:46.620 --> 33:48.020]  We need to set the tone.
[33:48.020 --> 33:51.380]  We need to start engaging in conversation
[33:51.380 --> 33:53.940]  and we need to make the conversation not just about weed.
[33:53.940 --> 33:56.460]  We need to like normalize our culture
[34:01.020 --> 34:04.420]  and take part in the narrative.
[34:05.740 --> 34:07.500]  I would like to see,
[34:09.020 --> 34:11.780]  and a lot of times when I say we, I'm talking about me,
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.340]  but I can't do it by myself.
[34:13.340 --> 34:14.740]  So I say we.
[34:14.740 --> 34:19.740]  So it's whoever I can co-opt on this mission
[34:22.060 --> 34:27.020]  to make the change that we all want and want to see.
[34:28.940 --> 34:32.860]  It's easy for them to use the examples of bad actors.
[34:32.860 --> 34:35.980]  And I don't think any of us can say
[34:35.980 --> 34:38.300]  that we've never done anything
[34:38.300 --> 34:40.140]  and haven't been bad actors.
[34:40.580 --> 34:42.180]  I'll be the first to say it.
[34:42.180 --> 34:44.420]  Yeah, I fucked up in the way,
[34:45.340 --> 34:46.620]  in the course of trying to learn
[34:46.620 --> 34:48.180]  how to do things the right way.
[34:49.420 --> 34:54.220]  But that being said, we can learn from those mistakes
[34:54.220 --> 34:58.820]  and we can start making regulation actually make sense.
[34:58.820 --> 35:02.980]  I feel like a lot of the way that regulation is rolled out
[35:02.980 --> 35:05.540]  should be driven by fears and irrational fears
[35:05.580 --> 35:10.220]  that don't necessarily promote great outcomes.
[35:10.220 --> 35:15.220]  And maybe if we could form a voice for ourselves
[35:17.540 --> 35:20.980]  that could be loud enough and resonate
[35:20.980 --> 35:22.540]  so that politicians are hearing it
[35:22.540 --> 35:26.060]  from people who have nothing to do with cannabis,
[35:26.060 --> 35:28.580]  just outside of our space,
[35:29.980 --> 35:34.380]  then we can start changing minds
[35:34.380 --> 35:38.620]  and opening doors and then we can start trading.
[35:38.620 --> 35:43.380]  We can start trading our political base and value
[35:43.380 --> 35:45.340]  for their political base and value
[35:45.340 --> 35:48.420]  and building the consensus towards the outcomes
[35:48.420 --> 35:51.260]  that we would like to seek.
[35:54.480 --> 35:55.320]  So.
[36:00.360 --> 36:03.080]  Jackson, let me move on to you
[36:03.080 --> 36:07.640]  and set you up with Pharmacy Bros who,
[36:07.640 --> 36:09.120]  they're in Mendocino, right?
[36:13.630 --> 36:15.790]  Wait, hold on, I'm unmuting you.
[36:15.790 --> 36:16.630]  There we go.
[36:16.630 --> 36:17.990]  I just unmuted you.
[36:17.990 --> 36:19.150]  So.
[36:19.150 --> 36:21.710]  Pharmacy Factory, or Pharmacy Bros,
[36:21.710 --> 36:23.230]  that's different guys, okay.
[36:23.230 --> 36:26.190]  Yeah, but anyway, they said Mendo Code Enforcement
[36:26.190 --> 36:27.870]  is on a vengeance right now.
[36:30.550 --> 36:32.150]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[36:32.190 --> 36:37.070]  I know that basically like at our county level
[36:37.070 --> 36:41.310]  that they basically don't have the infrastructure
[36:42.710 --> 36:47.710]  to even handle their permitting activities.
[36:47.830 --> 36:51.790]  So I don't know about the enforcement going on,
[36:51.790 --> 36:55.830]  but if they're taking time to enforce stuff
[36:55.830 --> 36:58.230]  and they can't even get through their paperwork
[36:58.230 --> 37:01.510]  from 2017 for permitting people,
[37:01.830 --> 37:04.390]  it seems kind of irrational.
[37:04.390 --> 37:06.830]  I haven't heard about that personally really,
[37:06.830 --> 37:10.470]  but I don't know, it's weird because here there was,
[37:11.670 --> 37:13.550]  there was that gray area from 2015.
[37:13.550 --> 37:16.190]  I feel like there wasn't really a lot of enforcement
[37:16.190 --> 37:18.390]  all the way through for a long time.
[37:18.390 --> 37:19.790]  I mean, of course there was at first
[37:19.790 --> 37:22.870]  and there was here and there, but not a whole lot.
[37:22.870 --> 37:27.870]  And once everything got legalized, more people got busted.
[37:29.190 --> 37:30.310]  So that's kind of funny
[37:30.310 --> 37:32.990]  because it took away the gray area, you know?
[37:32.990 --> 37:34.590]  So I don't really know about the state
[37:34.590 --> 37:35.630]  of where everything stands.
[37:35.630 --> 37:37.070]  I just know like my buddy went in.
[37:37.070 --> 37:40.910]  I mean, I have my permit for a nursery here
[37:40.910 --> 37:43.150]  basically just to produce seeds.
[37:45.670 --> 37:47.550]  But I mean, a buddy of mine went in and was like,
[37:47.550 --> 37:48.830]  yeah, checking on his status.
[37:48.830 --> 37:51.390]  And they're like, hey, yeah, we don't really know.
[37:51.390 --> 37:54.910]  We haven't even got through our stack of stuff in 2017,
[37:54.910 --> 37:58.510]  2018, so we don't know what to tell you.
[37:58.510 --> 38:01.390]  And they kept losing everybody's paperwork
[38:01.390 --> 38:03.270]  and they had it in the department of ag
[38:03.270 --> 38:05.390]  and then they switched it to building and planning.
[38:05.390 --> 38:08.070]  And then there was two or three people who resigned
[38:08.070 --> 38:11.150]  from the position of handling the whole thing.
[38:12.590 --> 38:15.470]  So it's kind of crazy to go from,
[38:16.750 --> 38:18.710]  it's kind of like what Bamboo's saying.
[38:18.710 --> 38:20.190]  If that's what's going on up here,
[38:20.190 --> 38:21.870]  it's crazy because people don't even really
[38:21.870 --> 38:25.790]  have the opportunity to handle their business
[38:25.790 --> 38:27.110]  how they're trying.
[38:27.110 --> 38:29.350]  And then you got people jumping on you.
[38:29.350 --> 38:31.510]  So, yeah, I don't know the details of that.
[38:31.510 --> 38:33.830]  I'm interested in that if anybody knows some of that info,
[38:33.830 --> 38:36.110]  if they could chime in and look it up right now
[38:36.110 --> 38:40.310]  or whatever, but yeah, I mean, it's kind of a trip
[38:40.310 --> 38:44.590]  because I see people being able to grow weed
[38:44.590 --> 38:49.590]  as kind of an equalizer in the classes.
[38:49.990 --> 38:53.550]  I mean, basically like people who are lower class
[38:53.550 --> 38:57.910]  being able to achieve being semi-middle class.
[38:59.630 --> 39:04.270]  And then with the way the regulations are and everything,
[39:04.270 --> 39:06.350]  like Bam's saying, it's kind of like you already have
[39:06.350 --> 39:09.710]  to be borderline, top of middle class anyway
[39:09.710 --> 39:12.030]  to be able to maintain any of that anyway.
[39:12.030 --> 39:17.030]  And I don't see that being a positive outcome
[39:17.150 --> 39:19.870]  for society in general.
[39:19.870 --> 39:22.110]  I mean, you got, if you have people who are able
[39:22.110 --> 39:27.110]  to uplift their position in the economy,
[39:27.110 --> 39:30.710]  then the whole economy is raised by that.
[39:30.710 --> 39:32.310]  Like you were saying with businesses,
[39:32.310 --> 39:36.150]  you make more money, the businesses all make more money.
[39:36.150 --> 39:38.910]  Everybody in the hills makes less money
[39:38.910 --> 39:40.430]  than all of a sudden there's less.
[39:40.430 --> 39:43.030]  I mean, you look at a place like Garberville,
[39:44.230 --> 39:46.830]  when I was a kid, it was, it's a little town,
[39:46.830 --> 39:47.670]  it's all good.
[39:47.670 --> 39:48.670]  There's a couple, there's some businesses
[39:48.670 --> 39:51.550]  that have been there that are like legacy businesses
[39:52.470 --> 39:53.750]  that they've been around and they're nice
[39:53.750 --> 39:54.590]  and they're still there.
[39:54.590 --> 39:59.590]  But I mean, as far as when things loosened up a little bit,
[40:00.830 --> 40:03.830]  you started to see the economy really was doing
[40:03.830 --> 40:05.230]  really well up here.
[40:05.230 --> 40:10.230]  And I know that that bleeds over into the greater economy
[40:10.510 --> 40:11.550]  in the state.
[40:11.550 --> 40:16.110]  I mean, you see it, it's like trickle out economics
[40:16.110 --> 40:18.030]  instead of down, because we all know that doesn't work,
[40:18.030 --> 40:23.030]  but it really was, I feel like injecting a lot of,
[40:26.710 --> 40:29.510]  just money and opportunity and everything
[40:29.510 --> 40:33.150]  into the greater society.
[40:33.150 --> 40:36.230]  And then now it's all kind of constricted
[40:38.230 --> 40:39.990]  by taking that gray area away.
[40:39.990 --> 40:41.910]  And I mean, of course, there's some things
[40:41.910 --> 40:42.870]  that are good about it.
[40:42.870 --> 40:45.750]  People being let out of jail,
[40:45.750 --> 40:47.550]  people getting their records cleaned
[40:48.070 --> 40:49.070]  and all that kind of stuff.
[40:49.070 --> 40:53.030]  But it seems like it would, I mean, to me,
[40:53.030 --> 40:55.070]  what I kind of thought about the whole thing
[40:55.070 --> 40:57.630]  before it happened was if you just make everything
[40:58.750 --> 41:03.190]  be like not punishable by jail time anymore,
[41:03.190 --> 41:05.870]  it kind of would have fixed everything.
[41:05.870 --> 41:07.590]  And then if you want to sell stuff in a store,
[41:07.590 --> 41:09.110]  it's got to be clean.
[41:09.110 --> 41:12.990]  And if you're going to grow, you can't violate EPA standards
[41:12.990 --> 41:14.790]  and be an environmental hazard.
[41:14.790 --> 41:16.710]  And it could be pretty streamlined,
[41:16.710 --> 41:18.870]  but instead they have to write this huge book
[41:18.870 --> 41:19.790]  of regulations.
[41:19.790 --> 41:21.830]  You have to do all these certain things.
[41:21.830 --> 41:24.870]  I mean, with any business, there's a lot of stuff.
[41:24.870 --> 41:26.830]  There's a lot of hoops you got to jump through and stuff,
[41:26.830 --> 41:30.750]  but it was something that was already kind of established
[41:30.750 --> 41:32.990]  and you don't have a whole lot of people
[41:32.990 --> 41:36.990]  rushing to the ER poisoned by bad weed every day.
[41:36.990 --> 41:39.630]  You don't have a whole lot of problems with it
[41:39.630 --> 41:44.430]  that aren't related to the illegality of it in general.
[41:44.430 --> 41:47.950]  And a lot of the dangers that come with it
[41:47.950 --> 41:52.310]  come with the fact that it is completely illegal
[41:52.310 --> 41:56.670]  and bootleg black market culture.
[41:56.670 --> 41:59.510]  And just making everything loosen up a little bit,
[41:59.510 --> 42:01.070]  I think kind of would have solved everything.
[42:01.070 --> 42:04.510]  But here we are now with it actually being tightened up.
[42:04.510 --> 42:07.750]  And one thing's for sure, I mean,
[42:07.750 --> 42:09.350]  there's you got a long track record.
[42:09.350 --> 42:10.870]  You're not getting rid of weed
[42:10.870 --> 42:12.830]  and you're not getting rid of business.
[42:12.830 --> 42:17.750]  So it would have been better to just kind of integrate it in.
[42:17.750 --> 42:21.070]  And instead it seems like it's just,
[42:21.070 --> 42:22.790]  they've kind of caused further divides.
[42:22.790 --> 42:25.590]  So, you know, the current state
[42:25.590 --> 42:27.790]  of how everything is here locally right now,
[42:27.790 --> 42:29.070]  like I said, I don't know what's happening
[42:29.070 --> 42:30.350]  with a specific, you know,
[42:30.350 --> 42:32.790]  with specific grades or anything like that.
[42:33.830 --> 42:36.310]  And I have the good fortune of being in an area
[42:36.310 --> 42:40.990]  with flat land, no creek, no culverts, house with septic.
[42:40.990 --> 42:43.350]  Everything was done to code for the most part.
[42:44.510 --> 42:45.910]  Little bit of stuff that's not,
[42:45.910 --> 42:48.510]  can all be fixed with building and planning,
[42:50.190 --> 42:51.550]  slight adjustments.
[42:51.550 --> 42:56.510]  And, but I mean, I can't imagine just in general
[42:56.510 --> 42:58.150]  in these counties up here,
[42:58.150 --> 43:02.190]  just the amount of flat land without a creek,
[43:02.190 --> 43:06.270]  or without, you know, all these different things.
[43:06.270 --> 43:09.150]  It's, there's probably not a lot of people who can do it.
[43:09.150 --> 43:10.670]  And I do know friends in the Hills
[43:11.350 --> 43:12.550]  who have told me, you know,
[43:12.550 --> 43:14.550]  like I talked to them two years ago
[43:14.550 --> 43:17.270]  and they were a hundred grand in on their permitting.
[43:17.270 --> 43:19.030]  Me, it was like, I had to build a fence.
[43:19.030 --> 43:21.630]  I pretty much did everything from the start
[43:21.630 --> 43:23.070]  and finished it off with some help
[43:23.070 --> 43:25.790]  from my buddy Craig Mountain at Rizal.
[43:27.110 --> 43:29.910]  And, you know, they kind of watch out
[43:29.910 --> 43:32.030]  for my water board certification
[43:32.030 --> 43:35.110]  and keep an eye out for notices I have coming in now
[43:35.110 --> 43:37.670]  and stuff because it's really hard
[43:37.670 --> 43:39.870]  to be able to handle all your stuff.
[43:39.870 --> 43:42.510]  And handle the new stuff.
[43:42.510 --> 43:47.510]  I mean, anybody who already has grown cannabis,
[43:48.150 --> 43:51.790]  you know that it takes a lot of hands-on time
[43:51.790 --> 43:53.070]  just to handle your stuff.
[43:53.070 --> 43:54.270]  You're usually pretty taxed.
[43:54.270 --> 43:56.070]  I mean, when I'm really working,
[43:56.070 --> 43:58.710]  it's an easy 12 hour work days, you know?
[43:58.710 --> 44:02.550]  And when I used to have a little garden,
[44:02.550 --> 44:05.910]  I could get by by only having 12 hour work days
[44:05.910 --> 44:07.870]  in the spring and the fall.
[44:07.910 --> 44:12.910]  But, you know, now in order to handle all your extra stuff,
[44:13.990 --> 44:16.910]  you need to put in a lot more time.
[44:16.910 --> 44:21.150]  It becomes a full-time with overtime job,
[44:21.150 --> 44:23.790]  even though you're self-employed all the time.
[44:23.790 --> 44:28.790]  And, you know, I just like, however it worked out,
[44:30.230 --> 44:32.270]  I have the really good fortune of being able to do it.
[44:32.270 --> 44:34.550]  I just don't see that many people who can do it.
[44:34.550 --> 44:37.270]  And my big issue is that a lot of these people
[44:37.710 --> 44:39.670]  who really built everything,
[44:39.670 --> 44:44.670]  the people who made it possible for me to know this stuff
[44:44.830 --> 44:46.470]  and to be able to do it,
[44:46.470 --> 44:49.070]  I didn't invent any of this culture.
[44:49.070 --> 44:52.070]  I came into it and it was already here.
[44:52.070 --> 44:53.190]  It was already established.
[44:53.190 --> 44:55.630]  We worked out some kinks
[44:55.630 --> 44:57.950]  and got some stuff to be different.
[44:57.950 --> 45:00.990]  But those people who are really the pioneers
[45:00.990 --> 45:05.070]  who really deserve to be able to shine now,
[45:05.070 --> 45:07.950]  for the most part, they are left in the dust.
[45:07.950 --> 45:09.310]  And a lot of them don't,
[45:10.470 --> 45:14.390]  they don't have the ability to keep up with all this stuff.
[45:14.390 --> 45:17.110]  A lot of those people come from the generation of people
[45:17.110 --> 45:22.110]  who moved up here in the 70s, 60s, early 80s.
[45:23.870 --> 45:25.950]  And a lot of them are elderly.
[45:25.950 --> 45:28.510]  And a lot of them have at this point conditions
[45:28.510 --> 45:30.510]  that originally they were growing there before.
[45:30.510 --> 45:32.710]  You can imagine someone in Humboldt
[45:32.710 --> 45:36.350]  who now is not allowed to grow.
[45:40.510 --> 45:42.190]  Dan was saying some of the stuff
[45:42.190 --> 45:44.470]  is not necessarily people who are really growing.
[45:44.470 --> 45:45.310]  Some of these people,
[45:45.310 --> 45:47.270]  they have a hoop house for their veggies
[45:47.270 --> 45:48.830]  and they have their little bit of plants.
[45:48.830 --> 45:49.870]  And all of a sudden they're like,
[45:49.870 --> 45:51.390]  well, we're gonna get our land taken away.
[45:51.390 --> 45:53.510]  We can't grow anything at all.
[45:53.510 --> 45:57.630]  And so now you've got people who have all these needs
[45:57.630 --> 45:59.790]  for having weed who really can't do it.
[45:59.790 --> 46:03.910]  And a lot of them also were supplementing their lifestyle
[46:03.910 --> 46:06.790]  with a little bit of weed and it got cut off.
[46:06.790 --> 46:10.870]  And it's, you know, bureaucracy does stuff
[46:10.870 --> 46:13.270]  with these broad strokes where there's not really
[46:13.270 --> 46:18.070]  a lot of nuance for them to be able to dissect stuff
[46:18.070 --> 46:20.150]  properly to know who's who and what's what
[46:20.150 --> 46:21.150]  and what's going on.
[46:21.150 --> 46:24.270]  And I can understand if people wanna block the creek
[46:24.270 --> 46:28.310]  and pour toxic shit in the creek and kill all everything
[46:28.310 --> 46:29.150]  and mess everything.
[46:29.510 --> 46:32.550]  That stuff is all criminal outside of weed.
[46:32.550 --> 46:37.550]  I feel like everything that is criminal related to weed,
[46:38.190 --> 46:40.630]  it should just only be the things that are criminal
[46:40.630 --> 46:41.630]  in and of themselves.
[46:41.630 --> 46:43.430]  Like weed shouldn't really have a part in that
[46:43.430 --> 46:45.190]  because in and of itself,
[46:45.190 --> 46:49.230]  cannabis is generally helpful, not harmful.
[46:49.230 --> 46:53.990]  And so I just think everything's kind of,
[46:53.990 --> 46:56.390]  they kind of turned it into this big quagmire
[46:56.550 --> 47:01.550]  trying to be too uptight about the wrong things.
[47:03.070 --> 47:06.470]  And I mean, I know it's all complicated to figure out,
[47:06.470 --> 47:10.390]  but at this point it just seems like they dropped the ball
[47:10.390 --> 47:11.870]  and it looked like they were dropping the ball
[47:11.870 --> 47:13.630]  as soon as they were putting everything together.
[47:13.630 --> 47:16.350]  And it was real easy to see, but like Bamboo said,
[47:16.350 --> 47:18.230]  you don't have people working on it
[47:18.230 --> 47:20.790]  who are the appropriate people.
[47:20.790 --> 47:24.790]  It'd be like if you were gonna try to revolutionize
[47:25.790 --> 47:30.790]  the internet and you went and hired a bunch of carpenters.
[47:30.830 --> 47:31.870]  It's like, this is not,
[47:31.870 --> 47:33.710]  you guys don't understand what you're doing.
[47:33.710 --> 47:37.230]  Are you saying Lori Ajax doesn't know what she's doing?
[47:38.470 --> 47:40.590]  Man, I don't even know.
[47:40.590 --> 47:42.750]  I don't follow stuff closely enough
[47:42.750 --> 47:44.990]  to even know who everybody is and everything.
[47:47.510 --> 47:49.950]  I keep notes on plants, you know what I mean?
[47:50.110 --> 47:55.110]  And so I just see these issues
[47:55.270 --> 47:57.030]  and they're all really simple,
[47:57.030 --> 48:00.750]  but I think that everybody's eyes get so big
[48:00.750 --> 48:02.270]  when they look like Bam was saying,
[48:02.270 --> 48:04.310]  they get a hundred pounds and they say it's a million
[48:04.310 --> 48:06.830]  dollars, like they think there's so much money,
[48:06.830 --> 48:09.790]  but they're not considering the fact that while some people
[48:09.790 --> 48:11.550]  are making huge profits,
[48:11.550 --> 48:15.350]  the majority of people basically are breaking even.
[48:15.350 --> 48:17.190]  I mean, in a normal business,
[48:17.190 --> 48:21.030]  if all your bills cover you breaking even,
[48:21.030 --> 48:26.030]  if you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year
[48:26.830 --> 48:31.830]  and your bills divided by that are coming up to 12,
[48:31.830 --> 48:36.830]  then you're not really making anything.
[48:37.150 --> 48:38.950]  And that's how it is for most people.
[48:38.950 --> 48:43.630]  And then they go ahead and slap all these fees
[48:43.630 --> 48:45.270]  to do all this different stuff on it.
[48:45.270 --> 48:50.270]  And I just feel like they didn't need to make everything
[48:50.670 --> 48:53.630]  so complicated and that they've kind of fucked everything up
[48:53.630 --> 48:57.790]  by doing too much and having it not be
[48:57.790 --> 48:59.310]  really practically minded.
[48:59.310 --> 49:04.310]  So that's the state of where everything is right now,
[49:04.710 --> 49:05.830]  as far as I can see it.
[49:05.830 --> 49:10.830]  And it's some bullshit and hopefully it can be straightened
[49:11.470 --> 49:13.710]  out, but it's just unfortunate because most people
[49:13.710 --> 49:18.710]  who are interested in weed are not interested in politics,
[49:19.230 --> 49:20.390]  even at a local level.
[49:20.390 --> 49:24.910]  And a lot of people who are involved
[49:24.910 --> 49:27.350]  in growing weed historically,
[49:27.350 --> 49:31.230]  a lot of the reason is because they were able to get away
[49:31.230 --> 49:34.150]  from everything and just do that.
[49:34.150 --> 49:39.150]  And although I know that that to square mainstream society
[49:40.150 --> 49:44.070]  seems like it's a little off, in reality,
[49:44.070 --> 49:45.910]  I don't really see anything wrong with it.
[49:45.910 --> 49:50.910]  And I feel like it's another case of this weird classism
[49:54.190 --> 49:55.910]  that exists where it's like, okay,
[49:55.910 --> 49:59.110]  it's almost like weed growers are,
[49:59.110 --> 50:04.110]  because for so long it's like persecuted as criminals.
[50:04.150 --> 50:06.630]  And why were they persecuted as criminals?
[50:06.670 --> 50:09.190]  Well, because weed is bad, obviously, right?
[50:09.190 --> 50:13.670]  It's this evil substance and it's gonna freak out your kids
[50:13.670 --> 50:17.390]  and turn society against itself and be crazy and horrible.
[50:17.390 --> 50:21.350]  And well, now we know that it's just a basic medicine
[50:21.350 --> 50:23.910]  and it's a basic drug.
[50:23.910 --> 50:28.910]  And so you would think that once that distinction is made,
[50:29.910 --> 50:32.950]  that these other things would go away, but they don't.
[50:32.950 --> 50:35.910]  And what I've always said about it is it's really
[50:35.950 --> 50:39.030]  interesting when you have something that's terrible
[50:39.030 --> 50:43.350]  and evil and dangerous, but then if you have the right
[50:43.350 --> 50:47.790]  piece of paper with it, it becomes completely innocuous
[50:47.790 --> 50:50.830]  and helpful and profitable for everybody.
[50:50.830 --> 50:52.470]  And now they want the money.
[50:52.470 --> 50:54.030]  They didn't want the money, it was dirty,
[50:54.030 --> 50:55.430]  but now it's great.
[50:55.430 --> 51:00.430]  And the whole thing just stinks of political fuckery
[51:00.670 --> 51:02.550]  and backwards classism.
[51:02.550 --> 51:04.990]  So that's my take on it.
[51:08.750 --> 51:13.070]  So Jesse has a life in Riverside County,
[51:15.270 --> 51:17.230]  which I think is within viewing distance
[51:17.230 --> 51:18.750]  of Desert Hot Springs.
[51:20.830 --> 51:22.910]  And let me wait, let me unmute you.
[51:25.390 --> 51:26.510]  Hold on.
[51:29.110 --> 51:30.830]  Or can you unmute yourself?
[51:34.740 --> 51:35.580]  There we go.
[51:36.460 --> 51:39.580]  I gotta keep my phone up there so it gets better service.
[51:41.540 --> 51:45.580]  Yeah, Coachella Valley is about a stone's throw away,
[51:46.740 --> 51:51.580]  but it's same old, same old as every county is going
[51:51.580 --> 51:54.100]  through the same process in California.
[51:54.100 --> 51:59.020]  You're realizing that the whole Prop 64 framework
[51:59.020 --> 52:04.020]  is corrupt from, I'm not gonna go get all into it,
[52:04.860 --> 52:09.860]  but each county is going through its own issues,
[52:10.300 --> 52:12.860]  but we're kind of fighting the same giant here.
[52:13.860 --> 52:18.460]  And it's unions and it's certain people
[52:18.460 --> 52:20.940]  that wanna control this plant.
[52:21.900 --> 52:26.900]  And really it's screwing the rest of California.
[52:28.260 --> 52:33.260]  As a whole, we have one of the probably best places
[52:33.540 --> 52:35.620]  in North America to produce cannabis.
[52:35.620 --> 52:37.740]  And then we've got so many different microclimates
[52:37.740 --> 52:38.740]  and regions.
[52:40.620 --> 52:43.340]  The only thing that keeps me in this industry right now
[52:43.340 --> 52:45.780]  is the excitement to one day,
[52:45.780 --> 52:47.860]  hopefully I can plant these trees
[52:47.860 --> 52:50.380]  that I might be able to sit under the shade of them,
[52:50.380 --> 52:53.940]  but I don't see it happening anytime soon
[52:53.940 --> 52:57.100]  with the way all these politicians,
[52:57.100 --> 53:00.300]  they come into this thinking that the money's,
[53:00.300 --> 53:02.660]  the risk and reward's still there.
[53:03.260 --> 53:05.020]  And the money isn't there anymore.
[53:05.020 --> 53:08.020]  And you got another group of people that,
[53:08.020 --> 53:11.780]  these consultants that they don't understand agriculture.
[53:13.340 --> 53:17.460]  Like you said, you got carpenters trying to wire
[53:17.460 --> 53:19.100]  the internet together.
[53:19.100 --> 53:20.020]  It's not working.
[53:22.740 --> 53:25.420]  Riverside County, it's a joke.
[53:25.420 --> 53:27.820]  I mean, we got probably one of the best
[53:27.820 --> 53:30.620]  appellations for cannabis.
[53:30.660 --> 53:33.020]  I mean, I'll argue in all of North America,
[53:33.020 --> 53:35.100]  but definitely in Southern California.
[53:36.980 --> 53:38.900]  This microclimate down here is,
[53:40.940 --> 53:43.140]  we grow avocados in certain regions.
[53:43.140 --> 53:48.140]  We grow agave in certain regions for a reason.
[53:48.380 --> 53:51.380]  We don't put oranges up in Boston
[53:55.060 --> 53:56.260]  because they don't grow.
[53:58.140 --> 53:59.900]  There's so much greed in the industry right now.
[54:00.220 --> 54:03.100]  Nobody's even seeing straight that this is just a plant
[54:03.100 --> 54:04.900]  and it is agriculture.
[54:04.900 --> 54:08.460]  A lot of it's culture, but in the end, it's agriculture.
[54:08.460 --> 54:13.020]  So rather than California in a whole working together,
[54:13.020 --> 54:15.500]  you got all these counties working against each other.
[54:15.500 --> 54:19.540]  You're turning everybody against each other.
[54:19.540 --> 54:23.100]  And it's kind of sad to see what's happening.
[54:23.100 --> 54:26.980]  The greed in this state has gotten out of control.
[54:26.980 --> 54:28.700]  We're supposed to legalize this plant
[54:28.700 --> 54:31.220]  so we can all enjoy the benefits of it,
[54:31.220 --> 54:32.780]  whether it's fiber.
[54:32.780 --> 54:35.340]  What they're doing with hemp now is just mind blowing.
[54:35.340 --> 54:37.660]  Like I finally, in Riverside County,
[54:37.660 --> 54:39.380]  we can't even grow outdoors.
[54:39.380 --> 54:43.780]  You know, they made the decision that they're gonna issue,
[54:43.780 --> 54:45.900]  you know, 50 permits total.
[54:45.900 --> 54:48.420]  That's not just, you know, 50 cultivation,
[54:48.420 --> 54:53.420]  that's 50 retail, but any cultivation is gonna be indoors.
[54:53.860 --> 54:57.780]  You know, when you realize you're sitting on the gold mine
[54:57.940 --> 55:01.220]  of Tawar in the cannabis industry,
[55:01.220 --> 55:04.740]  but yet your county is forcing you into a process
[55:04.740 --> 55:07.260]  of cultivating cannabis indoors.
[55:07.260 --> 55:10.020]  And like, to me, it's just like, wow,
[55:10.020 --> 55:11.820]  these are the people who are in charge.
[55:11.820 --> 55:14.740]  You know, no wonder we're in the situation that we're in.
[55:15.620 --> 55:18.220]  So, but as far as, you know, enforcement,
[55:18.220 --> 55:20.020]  it's the same old bullshit.
[55:20.020 --> 55:23.140]  You know, they're coming out, stealing people's livelihood
[55:23.140 --> 55:25.100]  and not on top of stealing, you know,
[55:25.100 --> 55:26.860]  what puts their food on the table,
[55:26.900 --> 55:28.500]  they're taking people's tractors,
[55:28.500 --> 55:31.060]  they're taking people's generators,
[55:31.060 --> 55:34.620]  you know, things that we grade our own roads.
[55:34.620 --> 55:37.100]  You know, county doesn't come out here and grade my road.
[55:37.100 --> 55:39.860]  You know, I'd grade it for them so they can come on down,
[55:39.860 --> 55:43.580]  bust everybody and raid all these black market,
[55:43.580 --> 55:45.940]  you know, Asian guys that are just trying to put food
[55:45.940 --> 55:48.180]  on their table, you know, or brought over here
[55:48.180 --> 55:50.060]  because they were trying to fight communism.
[55:50.060 --> 55:52.140]  And then you stick them in this position.
[55:52.140 --> 55:52.980]  I think it's funny.
[55:52.980 --> 55:55.500]  I hope these people break the state's back.
[55:55.540 --> 55:58.220]  As far as, you know, they're not gonna be able to do.
[55:58.220 --> 55:59.980]  I got so many growth around me.
[56:01.220 --> 56:03.660]  Go on Google Earth and look at ends in the region
[56:03.660 --> 56:05.420]  and it's just mind blowing.
[56:05.420 --> 56:09.500]  You know, they don't have the tax paying dollars to fund it.
[56:09.500 --> 56:13.380]  It's earlier, you know, they can't even file their paperwork
[56:13.380 --> 56:16.380]  let alone, you know, keep up with the situation
[56:16.380 --> 56:17.980]  they've made up here.
[56:17.980 --> 56:20.140]  So I would eventually like to see something
[56:20.140 --> 56:24.300]  that kind of was looking like how hemp was gonna roll out.
[56:24.300 --> 56:29.020]  But, you know, the state, I mean, I don't mind
[56:29.020 --> 56:30.140]  what the state's done with it,
[56:30.140 --> 56:33.340]  but what the counties are trying to do with it,
[56:33.340 --> 56:35.940]  they're going back to using, you know, zoning
[56:35.940 --> 56:40.940]  as a way of, you know, a catalatory way
[56:41.100 --> 56:44.460]  of just leaving us small farmers out of the game.
[56:44.460 --> 56:45.780]  And it's not right.
[56:45.780 --> 56:49.260]  You know, in the end, people need to wake up.
[56:50.220 --> 56:53.820]  So it's getting the county to realize,
[56:54.340 --> 56:57.060]  hey, there's $2 billion probably coming out
[56:57.060 --> 56:58.620]  of this region right now,
[56:58.620 --> 57:01.540]  regardless if it's licensed or not.
[57:01.540 --> 57:04.620]  I mean, the money's there, but it's, you know,
[57:04.620 --> 57:07.300]  it's going elsewhere because people don't want to invest
[57:07.300 --> 57:08.140]  in the community.
[57:08.140 --> 57:10.460]  They're scared they're gonna get, you know,
[57:10.460 --> 57:15.460]  the sheriffs are gonna come out and cut their hoop houses up
[57:15.820 --> 57:17.340]  and steal their tractors.
[57:17.340 --> 57:21.540]  And so, you know, people don't, it's sad what's happening.
[57:21.580 --> 57:25.340]  You know, I hope, I wish some of these sheriff departments
[57:25.340 --> 57:27.940]  would realize that they're just being used as puppets.
[57:27.940 --> 57:29.100]  You know, they're really just,
[57:29.100 --> 57:31.940]  all they are is portfolio protection
[57:31.940 --> 57:34.660]  for, you know, these big Canadian companies, you know,
[57:34.660 --> 57:37.420]  that are coming in with all the Wall Street money
[57:37.420 --> 57:39.540]  and they're screwing your own state,
[57:39.540 --> 57:42.060]  screwing your own county, you know,
[57:42.060 --> 57:43.940]  get it together and realize this.
[57:45.420 --> 57:48.540]  I mean, for us, we got a long battle.
[57:48.540 --> 57:51.420]  I mean, we got some big companies down in Coachella
[57:52.300 --> 57:54.060]  and luckily they're kind of losing their asses finally,
[57:54.060 --> 57:58.180]  but we're not like-minded like Humboldt or Santa Cruz
[57:58.180 --> 57:59.780]  or some of these other regions, you know,
[57:59.780 --> 58:01.380]  it's a melting pot down here.
[58:01.380 --> 58:05.020]  And some people are sitting in good positions
[58:05.020 --> 58:06.860]  and then there's people like me that are like,
[58:06.860 --> 58:11.540]  tried to go legit and tried to go through this process.
[58:11.540 --> 58:14.660]  And, you know, now I'm just sitting here again with hemp,
[58:14.660 --> 58:16.940]  like, how am I gonna go back through?
[58:17.780 --> 58:19.180]  You know, it's always money with them.
[58:19.620 --> 58:23.860]  You know, they don't care about developing these regions,
[58:23.860 --> 58:26.180]  these appellations, these places that, you know,
[58:26.180 --> 58:28.180]  could potentially make a lot of money.
[58:28.180 --> 58:30.060]  They just want it up front, you know,
[58:30.060 --> 58:34.980]  and it's frustrating, very frustrating process.
[58:36.100 --> 58:39.940]  So, we'll work through it, right, California?
[58:41.860 --> 58:42.940]  A couple of months ago,
[58:42.940 --> 58:47.140]  you had sent me some videos of the helicopters.
[58:47.140 --> 58:50.220]  So, what's been going on on that front?
[58:50.220 --> 58:52.940]  Well, they can't afford to fly the helicopters anymore,
[58:52.940 --> 58:56.060]  county-wise, you know, they pissed through their budget
[58:56.060 --> 58:58.300]  when they were doing all their marijuana Mondays.
[58:58.300 --> 59:00.980]  And, you know, unless, you know,
[59:00.980 --> 59:04.860]  the Riverside County Sheriff's Association
[59:04.860 --> 59:06.380]  is gonna start coughing up some money.
[59:06.380 --> 59:09.220]  I don't see where they're gonna be able to keep up
[59:09.220 --> 59:11.500]  this whack-a-mole stuff, you know,
[59:11.500 --> 59:14.740]  because all they do is hit one farm and another one's up,
[59:14.740 --> 59:16.540]  you know, and they're dealing with different people
[59:16.940 --> 59:18.140]  than up North, you know,
[59:18.140 --> 59:21.900]  we have a whole new culture within this Valley.
[59:21.900 --> 59:26.900]  And, you know, you gotta respect, you know,
[59:27.460 --> 59:30.420]  the fact that, you know, these people, they got balls,
[59:30.420 --> 59:31.340]  you know, they don't care.
[59:31.340 --> 59:33.500]  I mean, the county, I mean, literally they,
[59:34.700 --> 59:37.140]  I think it was like 12 different agencies
[59:37.140 --> 59:42.140]  that came back and something like 600 different personnel.
[59:43.140 --> 59:48.140]  I mean, it was a pretty big raid back in June 5th of 2019.
[59:50.180 --> 59:54.260]  I think they cleaned up about 70 tons total,
[59:55.940 --> 59:57.500]  but these people are still going at it.
[59:57.500 --> 59:59.100]  I mean, they're not, they didn't go anywhere
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.820]  and they're not gonna go anywhere, God bless them, you know.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.500]  And so the county's gotta figure out what it's gonna do.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.060]  How do we work with what we have here
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.540]  and not work against them anymore?
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.660]  I try to go to these board of supervisors meeting
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.940]  and try to tell, you know,
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:17.780]  don't you know what an appellation is?
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.740]  Like our Chuck Washington, our supervisor,
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.900]  the guy lives in Temecula, he lives in a wine region.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.500]  You know, when you just think like,
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.180]  oh, okay, there's a bunch of cannabis
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.020]  being grown up there.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.460]  It's not because the land's cheap anymore.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.820]  It's because the plant grows really good there.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.620]  So, but it's hard to get,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.420]  and I got other people in their ears
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.660]  telling them a different thing.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.780]  So it's frustrating down here,
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.300]  at least up North, you guys got it going.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.460]  And there is, you know, there is hope.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.980]  Down here, sometimes it feels like, you know,
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.340]  it's just every year it's another door slammed in your face
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.620]  and it's like, okay, well, you know how, you know.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.700]  And when you're trying to do things right, you know,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.660]  but your neighbor's growing, you know,
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.900]  three, $4 million worth of cannabis
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.940]  and living out in a fifth wheel,
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.540]  you know, it's like, man, it's a slap in the face, really,
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.700]  you know, because some people care and some people don't.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.820]  But in the end, it's just a plant, you know,
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.380]  that is plant that we are lied to about.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.660]  You know, we were told that it's a dangerous plant
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.420]  and it's not a dangerous plant.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.460]  You know, it's dangerous to patents
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.220]  and it's dangerous to corporations
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.180]  who wanna sell you things that this plant,
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.020]  you know, can provide for us in a sustainable manner.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.900]  But, you know, you've got these corporations
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.620]  that don't wanna lose profit
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:47.180]  and they got these patents on everything that this plant,
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.020]  you know, eventually we'll get it,
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.820]  but it's gonna take time.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.460]  I hope one day I can sit under that tree,
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.780]  enjoy some of the shade.
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:02:00.740]  All right, well, Omar, I'm gonna throw it to you
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:07.260]  to give kind of a legal policy perspective.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.620]  And one of the things I wanna talk about is,
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:14.620]  it seems my question is like for each of you feeling pain,
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.860]  it seems like more of your issues
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.780]  or talk about the distinction
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:25.380]  between like state policy and regulations
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.660]  and then how much of the pain points
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:28.860]  for everyone are related.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:33.460]  So just like local interpretation of everything
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:35.380]  and local autonomy.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.260]  So, and then actually Todd McCormick
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.860]  spent peppering the message boards.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.340]  So Todd, I'm gonna shoot you an email to jump on,
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.020]  but all right, Omar, take it away.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.620]  Well, I think Proposition 64,
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.820]  you know, did not really think through
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.740]  what would happen with local land use decisions,
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:01.100]  which is basically a rush to impose bans
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.620]  all over California.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.580]  And we had a rush of cultivation bans
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.500]  and then they were followed by, you know,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.900]  bans of every type of license.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.900]  And so what that really did is everybody has noted
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.860]  is it advantaged those who have the political connections
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.660]  and the pool at the local level.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.700]  It was also a recipe for what the FBI has, you know,
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.700]  called a lot of graft and that's like local payoffs.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.300]  And there's been a lot of bus happening recently
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.980]  and, you know, a lot of oversight happening
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.900]  at the federal level with local politicians getting payoffs
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.980]  in order to give out the local permits.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.540]  It didn't have to be that way.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.460]  I remember in 2016,
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.100]  when there were numerous proposals for initiatives
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.860]  so that we could have legalization after, you know,
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.540]  California tried in 2010 with Prop 19,
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.460]  which as Dan said, you know, was not that great.
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.020]  It was, I think the Richard Lee Monopoly Act
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.020]  and I'm glad it didn't pass.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.220]  But, you know, what we got in 2016
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.700]  might've been even worse, which was, you know,
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.660]  something that was a Frankensteinian monster
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.100]  written by what back then was the Olson firm
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.460]  that was hired by the billionaire guy, Sean.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.300]  What's his name?
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.900]  Sean, somebody help me out here.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.980]  Whatever, Sean.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.060]  Napster, Sean.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.900]  Yeah, Napster.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.740]  Parker.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.260]  That's right, Sean Parker.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:35.060]  And so, you know, they ended up writing this monstrosity
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.300]  that basically like enshrined into a statute
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.140]  because it was initiative that could not easily be changed.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.340]  This super convoluted system,
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.060]  and they put in the distributor
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.580]  as this quasi tax collector.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.980]  And now they're realizing the error of their ways.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.820]  And the governor's office has announced
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.980]  that rather than have three primary cannabis agencies,
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.860]  you know, Cal Cannabis Cultivation Licensing
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.420]  for cultivation and processing,
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.860]  and then the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.740]  within the Department of Public Health
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.740]  for manufacturers and extractors and infusers
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:19.580]  and packaging and labeling licensees.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.260]  And then there's totally new agency,
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.100]  the Bureau of Cannabis Control
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.380]  within the Department of Consumer Affairs
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:30.220]  for distributors and retailers
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.220]  and event organizers and testing laboratories.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.740]  You know, it doesn't really make sense
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.380]  for them all to be spread out over different agencies.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.500]  Although I can understand why many growers
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.460]  wanted to be under CDFA.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.300]  It's less burdensome and onerous
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.860]  than the other agencies, it turns out.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:51.860]  But, you know, that's not the way it had to be.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:55.220]  And Prop 64, you know,
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.380]  which is a sideways step in the right direction,
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.580]  it was diagonal, it wasn't direct legalization.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.060]  I think the first thing you gotta do is realize
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.460]  that we're not dealing with legalization.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:11.460]  We're dealing with, you know, partial reformist act
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.620]  and we still need to have legalization.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.620]  And that's what needs to happen
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.700]  in order to terraform a more hospitable legal environment.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.860]  I'm hearing everybody talk about how difficult it is
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.860]  to succeed in this fucked up legal environment.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.380]  And I completely agree.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.900]  You know, I don't really wanna go back to the olden days.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.260]  I know many people were making lots of money
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.540]  in the olden days.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:39.700]  I for sure was as a freedom defense attorney
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.500]  because my clients would always come up
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.940]  with the money to pay me.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.140]  And I had numerous clients tell me money is no object.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.100]  You know, I'll pay anything.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.020]  I've never had a civil client tell me money is no object.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.300]  Money is the object when, you know,
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.020]  you're dealing with your cannabis business
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.740]  and you're trying to make money, obviously.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.300]  You know, you're not gonna tell a lawyer,
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.820]  here's a blank check, spend what you will.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.780]  But when you're like dealing with your freedom,
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.420]  I had numerous clients over the years
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.380]  who would give me a blank check
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.060]  and I wouldn't charge them a penny more.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.820]  I'd just be like, my fee is my fee.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.540]  I always give it 100%.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.780]  Doesn't matter what you pay me.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.140]  Cause you know, this is what I charge for this kind of case.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.420]  You know, the whole point of that, I think,
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.660]  was really to, you know, I guess underscore
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.900]  how we still need to have full-blown legalization.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.660]  And right now what we're dealing with
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.660]  is probably better than the olden days
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.340]  when you had to worry about search warrants at 7 a.m.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.580]  and asshole cops brutalizing your family members
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.740]  at gunpoint with their assault weapons
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.580]  and, you know, doing those kinds of raids.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.980]  People don't have to worry about that.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:46.100]  Now they have to worry about a code enforcement notice
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.500]  of inspection.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.460]  No, no, we still love that.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.580]  We still love that.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.220]  Oh, you're still living that in San Francisco?
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.620]  Yeah, we're still living that.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.740]  Maybe I'm not getting the butt of a rifle in my face,
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:00.740]  but 10 to 12 cops show up in the middle of the day.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.860]  I'm relaxing with my family on the couch
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:07.260]  and I got to go outside and they are holding AR-15s.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.540]  And they are in bulletproof vests.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.380]  Yeah.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.140]  So it's a show of paramilitary force, which is terrifying.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.420]  I didn't want to interrupt you.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:19.940]  You know what?
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.340]  I'm not scared of those guns.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.380]  Go ahead, put one in my head.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.540]  Like I'm not scared.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.980]  You know what's scary?
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.020]  Is the impunity which they operate with
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.420]  and the total disregard for basic constitutional rights.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.100]  Their modus operanda is what's scary.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:42.100]  And the fact that they are authorized and paid.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.060]  I fully agree with you.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.380]  I recently worked on a case
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.300]  where the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.580]  was like doing highway robbery,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.700]  pulling people over on Highway 101 near Cloverdale
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.380]  and just taking their weed, taking their money.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.260]  You know, the case ended up in federal court
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.620]  and there was like a settlement
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.500]  and all the details are now confidential.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.380]  So I can't talk about it in detail
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.980]  about all the incredibly disturbing stuff
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.940]  that came to light about how the police were doing it.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.460]  But I'm sure that's rampant.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.180]  And I've heard many stories over the years
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.260]  in Mendocino and Humboldt County
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:20.500]  and those responsible have not been held accountable yet.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.220]  You know, I fully agree with you that, you know,
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.060]  this war on drugs and that whole mentality
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.540]  that's very punitive,
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.460]  they're not allowing what we used to have
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.500]  with Senate Bill 420, which was laissez-faire capitalism.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.340]  No regulations, you know,
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.180]  may the person with the best product win.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.540]  And usually, you know, that was pretty nice.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.180]  The one thing that is different now
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.340]  is all the testing regulations,
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.180]  which although burdensome and arbitrary,
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.340]  for example, there's no testing for glyphosate,
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:56.340]  you know, so Roundup can't trigger a negative test.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.540]  You know, they test for other things,
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.980]  you know, like EGLE 20 and things that,
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.420]  you know, maybe are harmful.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:07.380]  So, you know, looking for like the silver lining
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.780]  in the cloud, what I would say is like,
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.580]  there's a lot fewer felony criminal prosecutions,
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.700]  even though you may see the same paramilitary,
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.500]  you know, armed response with a bunch of like
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.140]  jackbooted thugs, you know,
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.380]  showing up at family homes and threatening people.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:26.740]  And, you know, that's why it's amazing
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.780]  because people are finally standing up.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.260]  I was just at the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors meeting
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.860]  and they're talking about having independent oversight
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.180]  of the Sheriff's Department.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.740]  And the Sheriff doesn't like it one bit
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.860]  that now there's gotta be somebody
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.420]  who has oversight power over the Sheriff
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.380]  and can demand that they turn over all investigation,
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.740]  all information whenever there's excessive force,
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.900]  whenever there's a civil rights violation
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.420]  that results in a case being filed.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.460]  And so I think that people are, you know,
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.900]  this is an unprecedented time to fight back
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.220]  and to push back.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.940]  And so I'm glad that everybody here
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.540]  is having the conversation.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.220]  You know, like I think the first step in taking action
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.260]  is being outraged by the injustices.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.220]  And so to hear about everything that's happening,
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.300]  you know, rightly so, it should activate us
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.860]  and should make us mad
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.540]  and should make all our listeners, you know,
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.700]  take action because, you know,
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.420]  we're living the drug war again.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.860]  It's happening again.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.340]  It feels just like it.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:31.380]  And, you know, now they're really like, you know,
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.540]  I guess like if you're rich enough to buy
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.900]  a get out of jail free card,
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.420]  you get to engage in this activity.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.620]  But if you're not,
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.740]  then you're subject to these draconian penalties.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.460]  Something I had posted for my fellow panelists
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.820]  is this opinion from the US Supreme Court
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.020]  that would be relevant to anybody facing
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.140]  one of these code enforcement actions.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.100]  And it's basically a case saying that the eighth amendment
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.340]  rights to not have excessive fines
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.860]  applies to the states.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.300]  And before it was uncertain
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.740]  whether it only applied to the federal government
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.700]  or it applied to the states or, you know,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.660]  the County of Santa Cruz or the County of Sonoma
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.540]  or whatever.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.020]  And now it's pretty clear that it applies there,
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.660]  you know, eighth amendment right
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.860]  against excessive fines applies to the states.
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.540]  And it's something that should be brought up
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.100]  in every code enforcement hearing
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.300]  because these fines are excessive and ridiculous.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.740]  $10,000 per day in Sonoma County,
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.580]  men do the same, humble the same.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.180]  I think Santa Cruz is the same.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:36.180]  And that case is up there, I think posted in the chat.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.900]  Thank you.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:41.940]  Yeah, and I threw that onto the YouTube chat too,
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.260]  but it seems like in any County or jurisdiction,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.060]  it's kind of like the district attorney's office
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:53.060]  and the sheriff's department that are collaborating
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:57.540]  on just their interpretation of law.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.820]  So that's why I find it interesting what you said about,
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.220]  like there may be oversight of the sheriff.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.260]  What count was that in Sonoma?
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.340]  Yeah, in Sonoma County.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.220]  Now there's like a big movement
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.060]  and the same in Alameda County.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:16.140]  You know, I think the reason that the government officials
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.500]  prefer code enforcement to the criminal courts
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.140]  for their enforcement activities
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.300]  is because there's no panoply of constitutional protections
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:30.060]  and these code enforcement kangaroo proceedings.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.260]  In the criminal courts, you have a right to counsel,
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.020]  a public defender, right to a speedy trial,
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.340]  right to the trial being decided by a jury of your peers,
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.140]  and they need unanimous jurors.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.940]  12 out of 12 have to vote guilty.
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.460]  If a single juror votes, this is bullshit,
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.220]  I'm not voting guilty, then the whole case is over.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.620]  And so I think for that reason,
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.540]  and also the proof beyond reasonable doubt,
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.500]  which is the highest standard in law,
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.740]  that applies in the criminal courts.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.420]  When you go to kangaroo court,
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.980]  as I call these code enforcement proceedings,
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.780]  you have a problem that Amit noted,
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.940]  which is that the prosecutor and the judge
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.420]  are the same person.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.860]  And the judge rarely, if ever,
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.300]  finds that the prosecution made a mistake
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.460]  because why would they criticize
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:17.940]  their own previous decisions?
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.180]  And they also have a lowered burden of proof.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.620]  There's no right to a jury trial.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.380]  You don't have a right to cross-examine
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.460]  and confront the witnesses.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.900]  They get away with all this pseudo evidence
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.900]  in these kangaroo courts.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.460]  And that's what happens in code enforcement proceedings.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.980]  And they could be tremendously unfair.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.340]  If you do get a code enforcement proceeding,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.460]  I think what Amit said makes sense,
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.460]  which is fight it.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.580]  And many times people are able to eventually negotiate,
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.780]  perhaps a lower amount.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.820]  Sometimes the county can be very threatening
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.660]  and they could say,
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.060]  oh, we're gonna start piling it on
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:58.900]  and we're gonna start looking
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.700]  at all these other code violations.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.340]  And depending upon the individual person's
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.980]  potential exposure, if there's a further investigation
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.380]  and now there's a can of worms
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.700]  or numerous can of worms to get opened
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.420]  as a consequence of fighting,
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:15.260]  maybe it's not so prudent to fight
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.700]  and maybe it's better to settle early.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.900]  But those are just individualized considerations
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.300]  based on each person's situation.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.380]  I think in general, it makes sense to fight it
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.180]  if you're in a defensible situation.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.620]  And while we have a-
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:35.100]  I think it's really important to fight it.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.340]  And I don't take what you just said for granted.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:43.140]  Right, everybody has their considerations.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.140]  And depending on how real they want to make it
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.060]  and how badly they want to beat you,
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.180]  they will fight dirty.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.740]  But this is why I'm saying all the more we need to fight
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:01.020]  because this kind of power is the antithesis
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.700]  of what the idea of America was supposed to be about,
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.100]  what we were raised.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.700]  I don't care whether you're on the right or the left,
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.420]  that is wrong.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:17.420]  And I think that's something that resonates with everybody.
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.180]  So I think it's really important that we start
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.140]  to connect the dots between all these different types
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:26.140]  of cases and organize to sort of form that wall.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.060]  So when there are a few of us that are vulnerable
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.100]  to some of the exposures and the anti
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.460]  that they want to stay up,
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.140]  at least we have a community that will show up.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.100]  And maybe I'm a dreamer, man,
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.580]  but I really believe if we passed a court full of citizens
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.940]  who were passionate about holding up justice,
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.780]  like there comes a breaking point and a tipping point.
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.740]  That makes a huge difference.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:55.900]  No, it makes it.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.620]  By offering the end.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.300]  Yeah, every case I defended, I would tell my client,
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.140]  like the more supporters you can get there, the better.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:06.340]  And sometimes there were supporters who would show up
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.660]  and because they had their own case
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.340]  and they were looking for support.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.460]  And eventually I think it was extremely effective.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:16.500]  The judges would always notice that people would show up
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.500]  in support of the others.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.060]  And I think when you're talking about people fighting
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.220]  their code enforcement actions,
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.660]  I think you have a right for it to be public
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.140]  and that for the public to attend
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.820]  the code enforcement hearing.
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:30.620]  And people can show up and bear witness
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.860]  and bearing witness can be extremely powerful.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.260]  It keeps everybody honest.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.660]  It makes them realize that it's not just,
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.340]  combat between two opposing parties,
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:43.980]  usually like the code enforcement officer
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.980]  versus the party that's now contesting
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.500]  the enforcement action.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.980]  And it's gonna be decided by this neutral judge
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.500]  who happens to be the code enforcement officer.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.340]  So I think in that or some other code enforcement officer,
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.180]  maybe, but usually it's somebody on the same team.
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.660]  Or another lawyer that works in the county.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.820]  Yeah, it could be.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:08.380]  Yeah, somebody on the same team.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.220]  Somebody who gets paid by the same,
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.580]  they get the paycheck from the same place, the county.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.420]  That's right.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.060]  And so that, I think it's a good way to keep them honest.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.140]  I think the better way to keep them honest
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:25.140]  is really to reach out to the supervisors and push back.
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.500]  And for these supervisors,
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.540]  now there's an incredible level of engagement
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.180]  that I'm seeing thanks to all the protests
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.260]  and thanks to the freedom that people have
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.980]  because now they're staying at home
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.860]  with the shelter in place order.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.460]  You many are unemployed.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.140]  And so for the first time in their life,
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.620]  they have time to pay attention to politics
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.500]  and to participate in public life.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.020]  And so I would encourage you to do that.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.940]  And nothing scares a politician more than thinking
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.460]  there's competition on the horizon.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.020]  That when their time comes for re-election,
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.220]  there's this very intelligent, articulate person
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.020]  who is asking the right questions
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.380]  and pointing out the holes in the decisions
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.140]  made by these public officials.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:17.660]  So I would encourage all of you to run, even you Dan.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.380]  So Todd McCormick, you've been talking about Prop 64
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.500]  and that's actually kind of why I asked everyone
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.100]  like how much of their personal pain they feel like
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.020]  is at a local level versus at the Prop 64 level.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:42.140]  So first, can you put your nuts on the table
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.260]  and talk about your qualifications
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.380]  as someone to talk about the importance
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:50.740]  of nobody going to jail?
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.980]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:54.740]  I started working with Jack Herr in 1994.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:58.500]  I was a co-proponent of the 1995 Cannabis Hemp
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.340]  and we added health initiative.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.540]  I helped with 215 and its wording.
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.140]  I was good friends with Dennis and Anna Boyce
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.220]  and all of those people.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.340]  I started the first Cannabis Compassion Club
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.540]  in San Diego in 1995, redistributing medicine,
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.780]  much of which was grown up in Mendocino County
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.540]  on Spirock Road with Richard Davis to people who needed it.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.260]  I became one of the first people the feds came after
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.540]  after we passed 215.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.020]  I fought them for three years.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.620]  They denied me a medical necessity defense
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.900]  and I went to prison for five years.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.900]  I got out, I started Select Strains Nursery
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:41.380]  I got raided again in 2006 by LAPD
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.780]  and I got three years probation.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:47.060]  I got raided again in 2009 by LAPD
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.580]  for cultivating in my backyard.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.140]  I got three years probation.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.780]  I moved up to the Bay Area
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.100]  and I was good friends with the guys at Oaksterdam.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.740]  When they got raided, I got raided again.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.900]  And I have this thing, I will never cooperate.
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.580]  I would rather go to prison.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.180]  And I was prosecuted for five years.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.660]  And Tony Serra was my attorney and it sucked.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.700]  And I've been through this a lot of times.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.220]  I really think Prop 64 is flawed.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.340]  I'll say that up front.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.420]  I think all of cannabis probation is fucked.
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:19.380]  That's a polite way to put it at least.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.020]  But the reason I looked at 64 in a positive way
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.140]  is because of two things.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.500]  There's the 10th Amendment
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.700]  and then there's section 903 of the Controlled Substances Act
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.580]  which is basically a two sentence paragraph
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.780]  that was written in so that section,
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:38.340]  the CSA that is, couldn't be challenged
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.380]  by the 10th Amendment and deemed unconstitutional.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:44.860]  Because at the time they passed that really horrible law
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.580]  in the early 70s, going after some drugs
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.540]  like psychedelics and cannabis
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.300]  and leaving tobacco and alcohol
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.180]  and other pharmaceuticals just fine.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:57.060]  They didn't expect the democracy to come along
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.220]  and there to be a disruption
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:01.020]  in the way they controlled everything.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.220]  And we have really disrupted this whole situation for them
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.220]  by direct democracy and changing these laws.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.100]  Unfortunately, when we passed 215
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:13.020]  and I was getting faxes
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.220]  and I was there trying to help with the verbiage.
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:16.700]  I was good friends with Dennis.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:20.820]  I've always been, but it didn't legalize anything.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.940]  It provided in the end a medical necessity defense.
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.100]  Once they shot your dog and once they cut down your crops
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.660]  and once they came and arrested you
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.260]  and once you posted bail and once you got an attorney
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.020]  only then could you go into the judge and say,
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.620]  hey, please, please take it easy on me.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.820]  I have cancer.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.740]  And sometimes like with me in federal court
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.660]  they could just tell you, yo, beat feet.
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.700]  We're not gonna hear any of those motions.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.580]  We're gonna deny you all of that.
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.380]  And we're gonna make an example out of you
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.420]  and you're gonna go to prison for half a decade.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:51.300]  And that's what happened to me and many others and it sucked.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.140]  And now with Prop 64,
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.620]  the 10th Amendment in section 903 kicks in
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.340]  and now the feds can't come in from doing to so many of you
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.260]  what they did to me, which was railroad me into prison
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.020]  because any of your lawyers could raise
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.540]  a 10th Amendment defense and they'd be screwed.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.780]  And now they're on this really weird place
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.660]  where all cultivation charges under 64
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.940]  are no longer felonies because under 215
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:20.660]  we were charged with felony cultivation the whole time.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:23.020]  Even though I was medical, even though I had doctors,
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.620]  didn't care, felony cultivation charges
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:26.660]  and it sucked.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.700]  I mean, I loved being Tony Serra's client
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.900]  because he's a legend,
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.820]  but going through prosecution for five years
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.740]  and getting prepped for trial three times drains you.
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.660]  I don't care what anybody will say, it's hard.
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.980]  And now they're not able to arrest people,
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.300]  but the disruption is really horrible
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.220]  what they're doing with civil matters
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.980]  because if they don't arrest you,
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.020]  you can't defend yourself in criminal court.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.820]  You can't use 215, which still exists.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.140]  It didn't go anywhere.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.620]  We can still raise a medical necessity defense
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:59.980]  and the Patrick Kelly decision that happened in 2010
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:03.700]  that Omar could talk about actually crushed the limits
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.100]  that were set by SB 420
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:09.660]  and said that basically any reasonable amount of cannabis
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.180]  could be grown because really the judgment
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.660]  comes down to the jury.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.980]  But what they're doing now is circumventing the jury
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.180]  by charging people civilly and stealing from them.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.140]  But they used to steal from us before,
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:27.140]  don't take me wrong, but they also stole our bodies.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.100]  They took us, they've put us in prison
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:30.900]  and they locked us away from our loved ones
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.700]  and we lost everything we ever worked for.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.380]  But now we're in a different situation
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.660]  of having to fight them.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:42.020]  But when I hear people talking about Prop 64
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.220]  not being a good step in the right direction,
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.420]  I think a lot of them don't realize the protections
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.260]  it afforded them under federal law
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.580]  because this is really the biggest threat to us.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.180]  And when the feds come in, it's no joke.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:58.580]  And 64 put up a big wall between us and the feds
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.940]  and that's the 10th Amendment and section 903
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.500]  and you can all can look it up.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.820]  And there are things we need to do now,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.860]  which is listening to all this,
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.700]  I feel like, shit, it's 20 years ago, it's just different,
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.500]  but it hasn't changed.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.060]  We're still getting our asses handed to us.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:16.460]  We're still having to beg for the freedom
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.900]  to grow some plants, but at the same time,
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.460]  I'll make the comment that puppies are legal,
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.220]  but you can't put a puppy mill
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.980]  anywhere you wanna put a puppy mill
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:27.740]  because they'll come in and raid that shit
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.580]  and it is what it is.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.620]  So there's always gonna be controls
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.180]  and even the simplest of things like puppies,
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.980]  but how can we work and become part of the system
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:41.420]  to change it in a way that doesn't fuck us out of tractors
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.900]  and our property?
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.060]  And one of the guys was talking about these growers
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:46.740]  coming in and poisoning the streams
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:49.300]  and poisoning the animals and how screwed up it is.
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:53.380]  And it hits home with me because I used to live up there
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.340]  in 1994 in Mendocino County on Spirock Road.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:59.220]  And I used to go into the Eel River and stuff
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.300]  and we all cared about the trees
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.620]  and we were environmentalists
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.020]  and we would never do the things that are being done
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.500]  by a lot of people that have moved up into the area
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  and have given the rest of us who gave a shit a bad name,
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.260]  and are doing environmental crimes
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.380]  that then are connected to cannabis
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.020]  and really don't belong connected to cannabis
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.140]  to a lot of us who's been growing cannabis
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.740]  for a very long time.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:25.820]  And for me, I feel like the message is
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.620]  we gotta keep fighting,
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.140]  but what we have to know that every step we take
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.940]  is a positive step in the right direction
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:36.340]  because we can never give up this battle
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.620]  because it's obviously not,
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.460]  freedom isn't gonna be won easily.
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.300]  It's not gonna come in like a lottery ticket,
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:45.300]  like initiative, if that makes sense.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.100]  We're not gonna get the perfect initiative.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.580]  They're not gonna wake up one day and go,
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.980]  we wronged you.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:54.740]  And unfortunately this is gonna take a long time,
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.180]  but what I see here is that
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.220]  we gotta kind of pool our resources
[01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.620]  and go back to being a community
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.060]  and realize that realistically,
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.500]  we have to fight together.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.220]  And instead of being so splintered apart,
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.700]  we really got to figure out how it is
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:15.180]  we can overcome this in the whole state of California.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:20.410]  Didn't mean to be winded, but that's what I was thinking.
[01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:21.810]  I love it.
[01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:23.930]  Omar, do you wanna add some color
[01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:26.210]  to some of the stuff he was talking about?
[01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:28.890]  Sure, I love the idea of getting a new initiative
[01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:29.730]  on the ballot.
[01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:32.090]  2022 might be the right time,
[01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:35.890]  depending on how COVID goes out
[01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:38.570]  because it's really impacted signature gathering.
[01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:41.490]  Normally signature gathering happen at crowded places
[01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:43.890]  and at events and without that,
[01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:45.650]  it's just really difficult.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:48.650]  It's just really difficult for signatures
[01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:49.530]  to get on the ballot.
[01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:54.090]  I was part of the decriminalized California
[01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:58.210]  psilocybin and psilocin mushroom decrim initiative
[01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.410]  that was looking really good.
[01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:03.610]  And then COVID happened and really complicated that effort
[01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:07.210]  because the difficulty of doing signature gathering
[01:28:10.450 --> 01:28:14.130]  it's just no longer a viable way to do it.
[01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:17.850]  So I think that's impacted the change,
[01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:21.330]  but now is a good time for people to start getting together
[01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:25.330]  and thinking, I've spoken at two different events today
[01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:29.210]  and it's what I keep hearing from everybody
[01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.690]  who's involved in the regulated industry
[01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:35.490]  is that it's not workable and it's not realistic
[01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:37.690]  and they can't wait for it to change.
[01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.650]  And what I keep hearing from people
[01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:42.370]  who have been excluded from the regulated market
[01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:44.250]  is that they wanna pay taxes,
[01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.850]  but they don't wanna have this ultra regulated,
[01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:51.610]  unworkable system that is not used for anything else.
[01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:55.290]  Like for example, metric is that used for pharmaceuticals
[01:28:55.290 --> 01:29:00.050]  or for alcohol, even though those are potentially deadly
[01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:03.530]  if they're consumed and somebody can go to a dispensary
[01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:06.530]  and ingest every single product in that dispensary
[01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:07.810]  and they will not die.
[01:29:07.810 --> 01:29:09.930]  But if somebody were to go inside a liquor store
[01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:14.170]  and ingest like a shelf of product,
[01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:16.290]  that could be absolutely fatal,
[01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:18.410]  but none of that is subjected to metric.
[01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:21.130]  And what about pharmaceuticals?
[01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:25.730]  They don't have those same level of like RFID tagging.
[01:29:25.730 --> 01:29:28.250]  And so why is cannabis producing all of this?
[01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:32.810]  It's ultimately waste that ends up in a landfill.
[01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:35.570]  It's plastic and it's just like metals
[01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:38.170]  and it's not really necessary.
[01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:40.090]  You're basically taking a benign plant
[01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.490]  and you're like packaging it in plastic
[01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.410]  and then you're putting it in child resistant madness.
[01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:50.130]  And it's so excessive compared to like
[01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:52.530]  truly dangerous substances like alcohol.
[01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:55.530]  So I guess to put a fine point on it,
[01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:59.050]  people I think need to be fed up enough
[01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:02.490]  with the current system to just say, we gotta change it.
[01:30:02.490 --> 01:30:06.130]  What I saw in 2016, where those who had the capital
[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:08.970]  to change it, didn't wanna create their own future.
[01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.010]  They basically were saving their money
[01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:13.450]  for whatever somebody else came up with.
[01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:17.610]  And then they were gonna try to ride that wave.
[01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:20.450]  Well, unfortunately the person who come up with the idea
[01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:24.130]  was Sean Parker and he just paid like a Sacramento firm
[01:30:24.130 --> 01:30:27.930]  that was not an activist or knew anything about cannabis.
[01:30:27.930 --> 01:30:30.090]  They knew lots about regulation.
[01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:33.930]  And so they came up with this 60 plus page monstrosity.
[01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.970]  And all of that has now blossomed
[01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:39.570]  like some sort of festering mushroom
[01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:44.370]  into 600 pages, which I've compiled in like my book
[01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:48.490]  just to show like how massive these laws and regulations are
[01:30:48.490 --> 01:30:51.490]  and that's only the state laws and regulations
[01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:54.770]  that doesn't contain the local ordinances.
[01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:58.210]  We have 58 counties, 482 cities.
[01:30:58.210 --> 01:31:01.210]  And so we have a patchwork of local ordinances
[01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:03.330]  with a dual licensing system.
[01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:07.490]  I think any initiative has to get rid of this myth
[01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:09.370]  of local control.
[01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:11.770]  There shouldn't be local bans on cannabis.
[01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:14.650]  There could be local regulations on cannabis
[01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:16.730]  just like with strip clubs.
[01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:18.490]  They can't ban strip clubs.
[01:31:18.490 --> 01:31:20.250]  They can regulate them,
[01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:24.490]  but they cannot constitutionally ban strip clubs
[01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:25.970]  anywhere in California.
[01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:28.450]  They can just impose onerous regulations
[01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:29.810]  that make it more attractive
[01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:32.210]  to go to a less onerous jurisdiction.
[01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:34.770]  But technically they're not bannable.
[01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:37.490]  And so I think something like that
[01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:39.610]  where anybody anywhere in the state
[01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:42.250]  can open up a cannabis business
[01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:44.890]  is what's needed in the next initiative.
[01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:46.930]  And then something that also advantages
[01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:50.650]  the small scale growers and all the craft cultivators
[01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:54.170]  by allowing like super streamlined licensing,
[01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:58.010]  plus the most important thing, direct to consumer sales.
[01:31:58.010 --> 01:32:01.890]  Imagine if every grower could sell direct to consumers
[01:32:01.890 --> 01:32:05.050]  and they didn't have to deal with a distributor
[01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:07.770]  and they didn't have to deal with retailers
[01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:11.570]  and they could just build their own loyal fan base
[01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:14.530]  of loyal consumers like the olden days
[01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:16.370]  without all these like mandatory,
[01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:18.330]  without the headache of middlemen.
[01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:20.330]  You know, the reason people have like their distributors
[01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:22.010]  or their brokers back in the olden days
[01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:24.810]  was because of the dangers of prohibition.
[01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:26.610]  Now that that shit's gone,
[01:32:26.610 --> 01:32:30.210]  why shouldn't cultivators have direct consumer access?
[01:32:30.210 --> 01:32:33.210]  And so I think that would really transform
[01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:36.730]  and revolutionize the California cannabis landscape
[01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:39.010]  and would make it finally attractive
[01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:43.610]  for the people in the duty free legacy market
[01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:46.010]  to jump into the regulated market.
[01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:49.490]  It's gonna happen soon with federal legalization.
[01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.650]  And so, you know, we should probably think
[01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:53.170]  about changing California law.
[01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:54.330]  What do you think, Todd?
[01:32:54.330 --> 01:32:56.970]  Well, I wanna ask you about that because you know,
[01:32:56.970 --> 01:33:00.410]  I wrote a piece about the second amendment and the CSA.
[01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:02.210]  And the problem is, is of course,
[01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:03.610]  according to the federal government,
[01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.730]  which the second amendment, everybody is federal.
[01:33:05.730 --> 01:33:07.770]  It's, you know, not friendly.
[01:33:07.770 --> 01:33:10.730]  Their attitude is, is if you touch a controlled substance,
[01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:12.170]  a schedule one controlled substance,
[01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:14.010]  your second amendment evaporates.
[01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:17.330]  You can't even have the right to possess ammunition.
[01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.730]  Even the ninth circuit, which is traditionally like,
[01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:22.130]  you know, very expansive in its interpretation
[01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:24.730]  of the scope of rights, you know,
[01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:27.290]  agreed with that very restricted.
[01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:28.250]  Unbelievably.
[01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:30.810]  Well, it sucks because people that have purchased
[01:33:30.810 --> 01:33:34.930]  legal handguns or legal rifles in some urban places
[01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:37.370]  where I've seen friends live, they need guns, man.
[01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:39.970]  There are bears and all sorts of shit and I get it.
[01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:42.930]  And, but unfortunately when the cops come and raid them,
[01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:45.050]  they get illegal possession of a firearm
[01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:47.450]  and they give the enhancements as how many rounds
[01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:49.930]  and various guns they find and it sucks.
[01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:53.610]  So this conflict that exists is really
[01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:56.330]  with the hemp farmers now was kind of moved out
[01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:59.610]  because they actually just removed hemp from the CSA
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:01.490]  and left behind all parts of the plant
[01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:03.930]  with more than three tenths of a percent THC,
[01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:06.490]  which arguably I was talking to Robert Clark,
[01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:08.730]  the author of Marijuana Botany about this.
[01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:11.010]  And we were talking about seeds becoming legal
[01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:14.370]  with the farm bill because seeds contain zero cannabinoids.
[01:34:14.370 --> 01:34:16.810]  And he said, well, arguably cuttings
[01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:19.170]  could be considered also hemp
[01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:22.650]  because they don't have measurable amounts of THC
[01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:24.650]  until they really get into flowering.
[01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:27.810]  So realistically they wouldn't test hot,
[01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:29.810]  just like hemp doesn't test hot
[01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:32.970]  until it hits that three tenths of a percentage threshold.
[01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:36.250]  And I feel that with cannabis and the-
[01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.610]  Well, that work around it is not as simple
[01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:41.970]  because they require that it be like state licensed.
[01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:44.690]  And so the state regulations have rules
[01:34:44.690 --> 01:34:47.270]  for testing of the flowering pops.
[01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:50.690]  So it's, but when does-
[01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:51.530]  For hemp.
[01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:53.130]  So if these guys get busted,
[01:34:53.130 --> 01:34:55.290]  obviously in August and their plants,
[01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:56.690]  week six or whatever,
[01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:58.490]  yeah, there's gonna be lots of THC.
[01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:59.690]  But if they come in early,
[01:34:59.690 --> 01:35:01.530]  like they have to so many people,
[01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:05.330]  how can they not prove that that is not hemp?
[01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:06.170]  Good point.
[01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:07.730]  The hemp reasonable doubt is an issue
[01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:10.290]  that's gonna be brought up in court more and more often.
[01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.650]  And unless the person gives an admission
[01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:14.410]  that this is THC cannabis,
[01:35:14.410 --> 01:35:15.530]  they could say this is hemp.
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:17.370]  And how is the prosecution-
[01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:19.850]  A person isn't a laboratory, man.
[01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:21.450]  You could point at a clone all you want.
[01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:23.770]  I know, but an admission is always admissible.
[01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.810]  But, oh, okay.
[01:35:25.810 --> 01:35:28.010]  All right, well, it's to me though,
[01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:29.330]  it's part of the situation.
[01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:30.690]  A person's on a laboratory,
[01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:32.850]  but their admission could be used against them.
[01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:34.650]  So just zip it.
[01:35:34.650 --> 01:35:37.150]  If somebody were to say, this is all hemp,
[01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:42.150]  then it's upon the crime lab to show it's not hemp.
[01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:45.130]  And their presumptive test is overly sensitive.
[01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:48.650]  It cannot distinguish between hemp and cannabis.
[01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:50.930]  They're gonna have to send it out for further testing.
[01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:52.210]  Exactly, and my point is,
[01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:53.970]  if they come and they cut up your vegetables,
[01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:56.490]  they're criminally liable for what they destroy.
[01:35:56.490 --> 01:35:59.410]  So if they come and they turn up these guys,
[01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:00.830]  because one of the arguments was,
[01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:03.330]  people are literally growing vegetables in hoop houses
[01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:04.730]  and getting raided anyway,
[01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:06.890]  because these idiots don't know from the helicopter
[01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:07.890]  what's in the hoop.
[01:36:07.890 --> 01:36:10.530]  And the reality is, is that once they come down,
[01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:11.850]  if they take this stuff
[01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:14.250]  and it doesn't have measurable amounts of THC,
[01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:17.050]  then they have unlawfully destroyed your property.
[01:36:17.050 --> 01:36:19.690]  It could, if you're growing lawfully,
[01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:21.130]  according to the local ordinance.
[01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:24.530]  Many places now have moratorium on help cultivation.
[01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.970]  So you can't really use the hemp defense
[01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:30.170]  and say like Mendocino County, which has a hemp moratorium.
[01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:34.250]  Or in Sonoma County, they used to have one that got repealed
[01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:37.210]  because the Farm Bureau saw such potential in hemp
[01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:40.250]  and all the struggling dairy farmers are going towards hemp.
[01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.770]  So there's many promising aspects of hemp.
[01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:46.210]  Like many of my clients are now registering intent
[01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:49.850]  to use federal trademark applications for hemp,
[01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:53.210]  and that will help them claim that namespace,
[01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:58.210]  the brand that they're registering with USPTO for hemp.
[01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:01.050]  And that will help them kind of like plant a flag
[01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:03.530]  that can be used later for the cannabis brand
[01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:04.970]  once it becomes legal.
[01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:07.910]  And so, the hemp angle is interesting
[01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:09.690]  and there's many opportunities.
[01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:12.770]  I went to Toronto last year
[01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:14.770]  and there were many hemp companies
[01:37:14.770 --> 01:37:18.090]  that were talking about trying to get distribution channels
[01:37:18.090 --> 01:37:19.970]  for their hemp products on the,
[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:22.370]  trying to anticipate that once cannabis
[01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.970]  becomes federally legal,
[01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:27.850]  then the same distribution channels can be used
[01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:31.650]  to get their products into the CVS or the-
[01:37:32.690 --> 01:37:34.810]  Now that's what I always think about.
[01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:37.250]  Any brand that adds a CBD line,
[01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:40.570]  it's basically we're building national distribution
[01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:43.490]  so that we're in place.
[01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:45.290]  That's right.
[01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:48.210]  Omar, just quickly, Cascadian Grown asked,
[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:51.490]  can we ask Omar of electronic signature gathering
[01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:53.970]  is possible for a new proposition?
[01:37:53.970 --> 01:37:57.810]  Yes, with a change of the legislature.
[01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:00.430]  So, it is possible,
[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:03.970]  but we're gonna need some legislative changes happening.
[01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:06.570]  I know that there was an effort in Ohio
[01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:08.410]  where somebody was trying to get
[01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:10.770]  a marijuana initiative on the ballot
[01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:14.810]  and the federal judge ordered the local officials
[01:38:14.810 --> 01:38:16.890]  to allow signature gathering.
[01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.410]  And then it was appealed
[01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:20.530]  and then the appellate court recently said,
[01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:21.890]  no, they don't really have to allow
[01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:23.690]  electronic signature gathering.
[01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:27.610]  So, I think the best solution is to contact our legislators
[01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:32.410]  and allow electronic signature gathering for initiatives,
[01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:36.610]  which will enable us to have a cannabis initiative
[01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:40.130]  and allow us to update our current cannabis system.
[01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:44.970]  The problem with Prop 64 is that it's kind of locked in.
[01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:48.490]  Any changes have to happen
[01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:51.090]  either with a new initiative altogether
[01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:54.530]  or the legislature can make changes to Prop 64,
[01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:58.370]  but only in furtherance of the purposes of Prop 64.
[01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:00.650]  And let us remember what the name was.
[01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:03.690]  It was the Controlled Tax and Regulate Initiative.
[01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:05.450]  So, it was all about controlling
[01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:09.410]  what they deemed to be a very dangerous substance.
[01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:13.810]  And it's, I think, a relic of a past era.
[01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:15.370]  It clearly doesn't work.
[01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:18.130]  That's why the governor's office is trying to do
[01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:20.290]  what they call unification,
[01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:23.050]  which ultimately is gonna be like simplification
[01:39:23.050 --> 01:39:25.050]  just because like the Byzantine system
[01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:27.650]  they came up with is unworkable
[01:39:27.650 --> 01:39:30.330]  and really presents barriers to entry
[01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:34.090]  to what I call the high quality manufacturers
[01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:35.610]  or the high quality growers.
[01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.010]  But I don't wanna talk no more
[01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:41.250]  because everybody here has so many interesting things
[01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:44.570]  to say it's better for me to be quiet and learn.
[01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:45.730]  Dare I say this though,
[01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:48.290]  that the control has always really been,
[01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:49.730]  they don't give a crap about us.
[01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:52.850]  They don't care about our wealth and health and wellbeing.
[01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:54.290]  We could drink ourselves
[01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:56.170]  till we are just a puddle of nothing.
[01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:57.090]  They don't care about us,
[01:39:57.090 --> 01:39:59.570]  but it's about controlling the commerce
[01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:00.970]  and the money that people make
[01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:03.890]  and coming in and attacking people and stealing their,
[01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:06.130]  they're literally property attractor,
[01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:08.690]  it's economically devastating.
[01:40:08.690 --> 01:40:10.890]  And what are you left to do?
[01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:12.770]  I mean, the only upside I see
[01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:15.770]  is that we're not being marched down to prison
[01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:18.370]  and having to go get a lawyer and go from,
[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:19.610]  and they still take your property.
[01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:20.970]  I mean, back in the 90s,
[01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:23.410]  I had friends who wrote, Spectra Forfeiture
[01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:25.530]  because they were stealing our stuff.
[01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:27.210]  Man, they stole like everything
[01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:28.450]  when they raided me in 97.
[01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:31.130]  Man, they walked through my house with like a looter
[01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:33.210]  and they took only the expensive shit.
[01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:34.730]  Like they left crappy cameras
[01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:37.890]  and they left the crappy TV and it was unbelievable.
[01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:39.850]  And, but now-
[01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:43.010]  Even though the search warrants said, take it off.
[01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:44.570]  Yeah, they didn't want anything crappy.
[01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:47.810]  They like anything that was below their level of takeage
[01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:51.010]  was unbelievable, but it's devastating
[01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:52.330]  any way you go through it.
[01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:53.890]  At least the upside now is that,
[01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:55.690]  you guys aren't getting torn away from your families
[01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:57.570]  and sitting in a prison.
[01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:59.370]  And that just gives me hope
[01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:00.850]  that there's a way we can organize
[01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:02.290]  and continue to fight back.
[01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:06.250]  Because realistically we have to.
[01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:07.090]  Good point.
[01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:08.650]  Now that people are not getting cleaned out
[01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:10.930]  and they don't have to come up with 10 grand for bail
[01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.610]  and 20 grand for a lawyer,
[01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:14.730]  they got a lot more discretionary income
[01:41:14.730 --> 01:41:18.370]  that can be used to like fund a change in the laws.
[01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:19.210]  But can I say this?
[01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:21.170]  So part of the problem is that a lot of the lawyers
[01:41:21.170 --> 01:41:23.370]  I've spoken to, you're a criminal.
[01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:26.170]  I mean, a lot of you guys are not really well-versed
[01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.450]  in civil forfeiture.
[01:41:27.450 --> 01:41:31.370]  And the problem is, is these cases are civil litigation
[01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:33.570]  because they go after them for fines.
[01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:37.010]  They go after their property and they lose their property.
[01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:39.090]  And that's everything to these people.
[01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:42.530]  And it's taking literally your home, your everything.
[01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:44.650]  And how do we fight that when they're not-
[01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:46.250]  Even if you got to pay it, you're right.
[01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:47.090]  Good point.
[01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:48.850]  I have friends who do asset forfeiture.
[01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:51.490]  And even if you have all the paperwork to prove
[01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:55.250]  that you can get your ceased assets returned to you,
[01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:57.810]  the lawyer still wants 30% for their time
[01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.970]  because these are time consuming cases.
[01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:02.610]  And so the cost, like when you're righteous,
[01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:04.530]  when it's a righteous case and you can prove
[01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:06.250]  you should get the money back,
[01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.690]  you only get two thirds back
[01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:10.490]  because you got to give a lawyer a third.
[01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:11.970]  Is there a conversion?
[01:42:11.970 --> 01:42:13.610]  Is there a way to convert a case?
[01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:14.890]  I know it sounds weird,
[01:42:14.890 --> 01:42:17.890]  but is there a way to convert a case from civil to criminal?
[01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:20.770]  Because a part of the problems the farmers I speak to have
[01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:24.570]  is that they cannot defend their case on criminal-
[01:42:24.570 --> 01:42:26.050]  Like I had cancer.
[01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:29.330]  I have a right to this because they're not being attacked.
[01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:32.650]  It's their property being taxed.
[01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:33.490]  That's right.
[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:38.850]  You cannot convert a case to criminal.
[01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:42.250]  The only person who can file a criminal complaint
[01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.290]  is the district attorney.
[01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:45.490]  That's their exclusive power.
[01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:48.730]  And so you can refer cases to the DA for prosecution,
[01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:53.730]  but even if you did, it doesn't extinguish the other action.
[01:42:53.730 --> 01:42:55.410]  It's just another case.
[01:42:55.410 --> 01:42:57.010]  If there's not illegal commerce,
[01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:59.050]  how does a tractor break the law?
[01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:03.730]  Well, I mean, those are like the issues that you litigate
[01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:06.930]  when you contest the forfeiture, right?
[01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:08.330]  If there's no illegal commerce,
[01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:12.810]  like what is the predicate illegality for the seizure?
[01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:16.890]  And that's why these asset forfeiture lawyers
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:21.210]  end up specializing in it because it's like maritime law.
[01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:25.250]  The asset forfeiture law comes from the law of pirate ships
[01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.970]  where they would seize a pirate ship
[01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:29.330]  and they would consider the pirate ship
[01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:31.210]  the property of the king.
[01:43:31.210 --> 01:43:33.970]  And so it's all this ancient maritime law
[01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:36.010]  that's really a specialty.
[01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:38.210]  And I don't do it because I don't like
[01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:39.370]  committing malpractice.
[01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:40.530]  I know there's many lawyers
[01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:42.250]  who just don't have any inhibitions
[01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:43.930]  and they'll take on anything
[01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:46.450]  and fuck up all sorts of cases,
[01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:49.650]  but that's not my style, I guess.
[01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:54.370]  But you make a good point that this asset forfeiture,
[01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:55.930]  there's not many lawyers who practice it.
[01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:59.010]  I would say David Michael, Brenda Grantland
[01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:02.650]  and Carolyn Hagan are like the Bay Area lawyers
[01:44:02.650 --> 01:44:03.890]  who are good at it,
[01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:05.050]  but there's not many lawyers
[01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:07.970]  who really know their asset forfeiture.
[01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:10.210]  And then code compliance is a clusterfuck.
[01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:14.450]  Most lawyers don't wanna do it because it's not,
[01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:17.250]  you're not arguing in front of a jury,
[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.730]  like when you're defending somebody's liberty,
[01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:22.690]  you're basically like arguing in front of like
[01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:24.290]  the kangaroo court for somebody
[01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:25.410]  who's just rolling their eyes
[01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:27.810]  and they're like, oh, can I go home now?
[01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:29.570]  Is this over now?
[01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:32.570]  And it's not the most compelling type
[01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:34.730]  of legal practice for many.
[01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:37.730]  And so that's why the people end up
[01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.610]  usually having to learn how to do it on their own,
[01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:41.170]  which is extremely empowering.
[01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:43.530]  It just underlines the fact
[01:44:43.530 --> 01:44:45.330]  that it's all about the money control.
[01:44:45.330 --> 01:44:48.970]  It's all because a tractor can't break the law.
[01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:50.570]  So to take somebody's tractor,
[01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:52.890]  an inanimate object and charge it with a crime,
[01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:56.650]  so to speak, and use that as predicate to take it away
[01:44:56.650 --> 01:44:59.770]  is really, to me, it's, you know,
[01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:00.610]  but America is a flawed system.
[01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:03.050]  It's like the king taking the pirate ship
[01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:07.970]  and taking the swords and taking every instrument
[01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:09.490]  used by the pirates.
[01:45:09.490 --> 01:45:11.050]  Right, it's wrong, right?
[01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:13.050]  Yes, and they're the pirates.
[01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:14.650]  And I mean, you know, like,
[01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:18.050]  we do need the lawyers that we know.
[01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:19.970]  A lot of my activist friends that are lawyers,
[01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:21.490]  you've been a great one.
[01:45:21.810 --> 01:45:23.410]  Omar, I've admired you for many years, you know,
[01:45:23.410 --> 01:45:26.610]  and David Michael was my attorney 20 plus years ago.
[01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:28.810]  Oh yeah, there you are, he's still doing it.
[01:45:28.810 --> 01:45:31.570]  Yeah, back when Pier 5 was actually at Pier 5.
[01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:34.250]  That's right, oh my God.
[01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:36.210]  And he's a great guy, you know,
[01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:38.810]  but it's messed up that now that his specialty
[01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:40.170]  has gone from criminal defense
[01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:43.090]  to having to basically defend the right
[01:45:43.090 --> 01:45:45.610]  of inanimate objects of people to own them,
[01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:48.130]  you know, if there's no criminal law broken,
[01:45:48.130 --> 01:45:50.970]  which is really the odd part about all of this.
[01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:54.410]  I've sat here wondering how can we craft another initiative
[01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:56.890]  or how can you deal with this on a bigger level?
[01:45:56.890 --> 01:45:59.210]  Because we had this problem in 96.
[01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:00.050]  I mean,
[01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:01.170]  To really legalize it, you know,
[01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:04.570]  my idea would be like repeal all cannabis crimes.
[01:46:04.570 --> 01:46:07.890]  And then basically, you know, there's many ways to do it.
[01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:12.810]  You could just allow people to like buy a tax stamp, right?
[01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:14.970]  And with all the modern technology,
[01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:17.410]  you can like buy a tax stamp that you put on the cannabis
[01:46:17.410 --> 01:46:19.290]  and now that cannabis is legal.
[01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:20.690]  And that would bring in all the people
[01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:23.130]  from the duty free market.
[01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:24.690]  And, you know, they would be happy
[01:46:24.690 --> 01:46:27.170]  to like buy their tax stamp online anonymously
[01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:28.250]  and slap it on their bag.
[01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:31.570]  And if they get busted, hey, I paid my tax stamp.
[01:46:31.570 --> 01:46:33.850]  Leave me alone, get out of my face, you know?
[01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:36.930]  And I hate it still though, it seems so prohibitionesque.
[01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:40.250]  I mean, but it is, you know,
[01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:43.690]  we've been oppressed for so long that anything feels better
[01:46:43.690 --> 01:46:47.810]  than, you know, getting our dog shot and getting locked up.
[01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:50.010]  You know, and it's been a long hard road.
[01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.850]  And, you know, my heart goes out to everybody
[01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:54.170]  going through what they're going through now,
[01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:56.170]  but it's so much better than what it was like
[01:46:56.170 --> 01:46:58.730]  when the feds came in and really came in
[01:46:58.730 --> 01:47:01.730]  and everything was taken and everything was killed
[01:47:01.730 --> 01:47:05.690]  and like nothing, you didn't go home to your property, man.
[01:47:05.690 --> 01:47:08.370]  It wasn't yours to visit again.
[01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:11.210]  So we've come a long way and we still got to keep fighting.
[01:47:11.210 --> 01:47:12.330]  There's no two questions.
[01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:13.650]  I mean, you know, but.
[01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:17.090]  Well, you know what you're talking about now?
[01:47:17.410 --> 01:47:18.410]  It's making me think like, yeah,
[01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:20.810]  this cannabis tax stamp sounds silly
[01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:23.130]  when you think about it in terms of cannabis freedom.
[01:47:23.130 --> 01:47:25.050]  What about like a cannabis testing stamp?
[01:47:25.050 --> 01:47:27.730]  Like, hey, it doesn't have any contaminants
[01:47:27.730 --> 01:47:29.370]  and that's all you need to sell it.
[01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:31.570]  Me and Jack, you know, we're really close
[01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:32.570]  and we used to fight a lot
[01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:34.050]  because if you're really close to Jack,
[01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:35.170]  you always fought with Jack.
[01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:36.010]  It was- Of course.
[01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:36.930]  You always fought with Jack.
[01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:38.210]  He's a contrarian.
[01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:42.290]  Yeah, he wanted a $10 tax on every ounce.
[01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:45.170]  And I was like, bro, that's 160 bucks on a pound of weed.
[01:47:45.170 --> 01:47:47.450]  Like, you know, organic dried tomatoes
[01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:49.930]  is like 10 bucks a pound on a bad day.
[01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:51.810]  What happens to the day cannabis,
[01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:54.290]  organic dried cannabis is 10 bucks a pound.
[01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:56.810]  And then I got to pay $160 tax
[01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:58.530]  because you thought that was cheap.
[01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:00.730]  And he was just like, oh, it'll never be that cheap.
[01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:02.490]  And I was like, really?
[01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:03.850]  When everyone can grow it?
[01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:04.690]  Really?
[01:48:04.690 --> 01:48:06.250]  When tomatoes are in everyone's backyard,
[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:09.410]  it's not going to be like, whatever, here's free bud.
[01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:10.450]  Get real, dude.
[01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.530]  I don't see how that's not going to change.
[01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:15.130]  It should always be based on what the market value is.
[01:48:15.970 --> 01:48:17.170]  But I think the market value is ridiculous.
[01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:18.810]  I'm writing an article now about,
[01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:21.330]  I think the greed in the industry is killing the industry
[01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:23.410]  because you stop and think about it.
[01:48:23.410 --> 01:48:24.810]  You go into one of these weed shops,
[01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:27.810]  it's 50 bucks an eighth plus for a good bud.
[01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:30.610]  I mean, go back to 1994 on a dead lot.
[01:48:30.610 --> 01:48:31.450]  Guess what?
[01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:32.410]  50 bucks an eighth.
[01:48:32.410 --> 01:48:35.690]  It was more than 400 if they didn't like you,
[01:48:35.690 --> 01:48:37.490]  but it was the same price.
[01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:40.610]  And now these asses are operating legally.
[01:48:40.610 --> 01:48:43.650]  And it's like, why are we paying the same amount of money?
[01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.490]  Yeah.
[01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:47.210]  We're never going to see the, whatever you want.
[01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:48.170]  It's a taxation.
[01:48:48.170 --> 01:48:49.890]  It's not the prohibition premium.
[01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.850]  The prohibition premium has been replaced
[01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:54.370]  by the state and local taxation.
[01:48:54.370 --> 01:48:55.650]  Well, it's not worth it.
[01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:57.650]  And I mean, when are we going to get to a point
[01:48:57.650 --> 01:49:00.890]  where the illicit market or legacy market,
[01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:03.090]  or whatever you want to call us, market,
[01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:07.130]  isn't going to go away until the price is changed,
[01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:09.650]  until the legal producers sell cannabis
[01:49:09.650 --> 01:49:11.970]  for two or three times the cost of production.
[01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:14.450]  And you can go down there and buy it like you buy,
[01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:17.290]  organic dried tomatoes for eight bucks a pound.
[01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:19.810]  Cannabis is never going to come down in price.
[01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:23.330]  And there's always going to be this burden placed on people
[01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:25.050]  that are growing it because they're like,
[01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:26.450]  hey, you know what?
[01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:27.770]  You're being greedy.
[01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:29.090]  We're going to come after your money.
[01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:30.450]  We're going to take your shit.
[01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:31.850]  Because that's all it's about.
[01:49:31.850 --> 01:49:35.090]  And we're not going to lose that until the profit's gone.
[01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:37.290]  And I hate to say it, but it's totally true.
[01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:41.450]  But how many growers right now are actually pricing
[01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:43.410]  two or three times cost of production?
[01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:45.170]  No one.
[01:49:45.170 --> 01:49:46.010]  Not many.
[01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.850]  No.
[01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:48.570]  Not in the regulated market.
[01:49:48.570 --> 01:49:50.650]  I think in the duty-free market,
[01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.650]  it's a different ballgame.
[01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:55.690]  I mean, what I do like to see these days
[01:49:55.690 --> 01:50:00.610]  is the genius cannabis investment company,
[01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:06.970]  the Bilzerian, Ignite brand, the MedMen comeuppance.
[01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:11.210]  It's a lot of karma is finally coming through
[01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:12.050]  for all these producers.
[01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:15.810]  So actually the journalist who wrote that whole series
[01:50:15.810 --> 01:50:17.770]  of articles on the Genius Fund,
[01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:20.090]  I talked to her and she wants to come on
[01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:24.370]  and talk about that story and bring on possibly
[01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:27.050]  some of the former employees.
[01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.890]  Oh, love it.
[01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:28.730]  I want to see it.
[01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:30.330]  I'll bring my popcorn.
[01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:32.970]  So-
[01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:34.730]  I think the company's rightly named
[01:50:34.730 --> 01:50:37.050]  considering it's burning up so fast.
[01:50:37.050 --> 01:50:39.890]  Yes, they were truly geniuses.
[01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:44.330]  So Todd, when Tony Serra was representing you
[01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:46.970]  on court days, did he ever turn to you and say,
[01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:48.690]  I just took a lot of LSD?
[01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:50.850]  Unfortunately, no.
[01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:55.850]  I got to say that I really enjoyed the last five years
[01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:59.650]  I got prosecuted because I was with Tony every time.
[01:50:59.650 --> 01:51:02.410]  And I felt like it was like,
[01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:04.170]  like I had a little diamonds of life.
[01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:08.010]  He's such a incredibly sincere and talented
[01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:09.410]  and considerate person.
[01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:11.410]  And it just was nice to be in his shadow.
[01:51:11.410 --> 01:51:13.370]  And like, I, after five years in prison,
[01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:14.570]  I don't want to sound like an ass,
[01:51:14.570 --> 01:51:17.810]  but I wasn't really worried about going to jail
[01:51:17.810 --> 01:51:19.890]  for a little while in California for growing weed.
[01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:21.650]  So it was like, whatever trial.
[01:51:21.650 --> 01:51:22.610]  Yeah, I don't want to hear it.
[01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:26.490]  You know, like, you know, so I don't know.
[01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:27.450]  Tony's awesome.
[01:51:27.450 --> 01:51:30.090]  If ever you get in trouble and Tony could be your attorney,
[01:51:30.090 --> 01:51:32.170]  if he'll take your case, do it.
[01:51:32.170 --> 01:51:33.290]  It's a good time.
[01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:37.210]  He's taking cases now.
[01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:38.890]  I'm doing a case with him.
[01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:40.050]  Yeah.
[01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:44.810]  So a while ago, somebody said a lot of talk.
[01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:46.530]  What's the solution?
[01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:52.450]  So can you guys talk about what you would like to see change?
[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:57.250]  So Jackson in Mendocino.
[01:51:57.250 --> 01:51:59.810]  I also heard people say, I want to hear more from Jackson.
[01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:00.650]  Yes.
[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.860]  For me, a solution.
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:08.820]  Jeez, man, let's just pick one guy
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.300]  and he'll just fix it all.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.460]  This'll be real easy.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:21.460]  That's a pretty nuanced conversation, I think.
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:28.500]  I don't really know what the solution would be.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.780]  I just see it from the big picture perspective
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:37.860]  of looking at it like this is all the remnants
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.340]  of the drug war, which in the first place
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.220]  was never a logical thing to start.
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:51.380]  And now we have the realization, I think,
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.140]  by most of the world that there's been a lot
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:57.700]  of crazy classism, racial injustice,
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:00.660]  and the drug war is kind of, to me,
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.980]  like the pinnacle of all that.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:08.700]  And I don't know how to fix it,
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.980]  but I know that if you look at it from that perspective
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:12.380]  and you realize that the whole thing
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.540]  was totally bullshit from the start,
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:19.540]  the fact that they make us buy into this new concept
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:24.580]  of how everything is, it seems, like I said before,
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:25.780]  it seems pretty fucked.
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:33.140]  All the fees and everything, like Todd was saying,
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.820]  Todd raised a lot of good points.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:38.540]  But I mean, you look at it like,
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.220]  okay, people who wanna produce weed,
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:43.340]  like I myself, I don't believe that at the quality
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:47.100]  of weed that my friends, I have friends who buy weed
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.620]  for me, they grow weed, but they wanna smoke my weed.
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:51.700]  They don't wanna smoke their weed.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.420]  They grow a lot of weed, I don't grow as much weed.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.700]  If I grow more than a few hundred pounds a year,
[01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:01.140]  maybe that only costs me a few thousand dollars,
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.340]  it takes me all my time to be able to do that.
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:08.260]  That's all my focus.
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:10.340]  Now, if I'm gonna sell that for two or three times
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:14.460]  what it costs me to do that, and if I grow organic
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.820]  and I own my own property, it's only costing me
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:21.180]  this little amount, then I'm gonna get two
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:25.500]  or three times that, I don't see how that is gonna keep me
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.300]  even buying food and gas.
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:33.020]  So, there's a lot of nuance to the way
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.740]  the whole thing works and adding those fees on there
[01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:36.700]  is crazy.
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:41.180]  And there is a $10 tax on an ounce at this point
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:42.060]  and all this shit.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:47.060]  And it seems like there doesn't need to be
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:49.620]  any additional taxes or anything on there.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:57.100]  The fact that the weed economy feeds California so much
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.660]  seems like it would be good enough that everybody's adding
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:04.900]  in tons of money and then paying income and sales taxes,
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:06.780]  all these other fees and all this other bullshit.
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.900]  I think that needs to go away.
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.100]  And I think that would help a lot.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.860]  And then other than that, like I said,
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.820]  as far as the regulations, things shouldn't be illegal
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:19.300]  just because they're related to weed.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:21.660]  That's part of the drug war policy
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:25.060]  that is like a remnant of stigma
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:26.980]  that doesn't seem to make any sense.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:32.060]  And so, I think the fact that weed is getting lumped
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:39.380]  into this category with things that are dangerous
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:44.380]  and the only real danger there that is coming from weed
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:49.660]  in and of itself is really, like they say,
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:52.500]  the only thing dangerous about weed is getting busted.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.220]  And at this point beyond getting busted,
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.940]  like Todd said, it's not a felony anymore.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:00.820]  You're not gonna go to jail for going weed.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.660]  That's great.
[01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:04.020]  That's a good thing that came with 64.
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:09.060]  But as far as all this other stuff,
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.500]  it seems like it's just hanging around
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.580]  and it needs to be streamlined.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:15.700]  And I don't know exactly how to make that happen,
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:19.100]  but I do know that when you look at the way
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:23.300]  the government views things, they're thinking,
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:27.340]  okay, there's a funny thing that happens.
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:28.460]  The government looks at it
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:30.580]  as how much money goes to the government
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.460]  and that'll help the people.
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.820]  But that is another strange version
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:37.060]  of trickle-down economics.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:41.780]  In reality, you should be able to look and recognize
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:45.460]  that if the people have money, then the people have money.
[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:50.300]  A good economy is based on everybody making more money.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:53.700]  So if you enable everyone to make more money,
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.860]  then everybody else makes more money.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:00.860]  I went to New York in 2009, right after that big crash,
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:09.300]  and we rode in a taxi with a guy and we said,
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.460]  yeah, it's pretty dead out here.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:14.100]  And he goes, yeah, well, there's not a lot of money.
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.180]  And we were in the mountains.
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:17.900]  We didn't really understand what it was like there.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:22.900]  And he said, you know what happens is I drive this cab
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:27.900]  and I get fares because people have money to pay me.
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.380]  When people don't pay me,
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:35.740]  then I don't go to buy as much new clothes at the shop.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.100]  And those people don't make as much money
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:41.140]  so they don't go to the restaurant.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:43.100]  And the people who are on the restaurant
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.940]  don't make as much money so they don't come get a cab.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:50.100]  And all of us just continually get broker and broker.
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.820]  And that's kind of the problem that's happening
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:54.700]  with everything that's going on.
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:59.700]  And I've said before, it's not intentional,
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:03.700]  but it's a form of economic assassination.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:08.380]  It's something that world powers would do
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:12.300]  to undermine the economy of foreign nations
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.940]  so that they can gain control.
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.820]  And they're doing it to us
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:22.820]  without even doing it intentionally as far as I can tell.
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:26.380]  And so a lot of it to me,
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:29.300]  it's at this point is the economics of it.
[01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:34.300]  And that's kind of the best I can really say about it
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.060]  is that that kind of stuff needs to be straightened out.
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:42.060]  And they're not concepts that are only endemic
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.780]  to the weed space.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:48.420]  It kind of relates to everything.
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:53.420]  And it's a global problem with economic colonialization.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:59.980]  And it's happening to us in a weird roundabout way.
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:02.940]  And I think it's undermining everything.
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:05.540]  And at this point, people can see how important it is
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:06.500]  to our economy.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:09.500]  People can see that, okay, we're calling this essential
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.740]  and in the lockdown, this is obviously something
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:13.500]  that's accepted.
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:17.060]  And it's still getting the stigma
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.780]  of being this dangerous toxin that we need to keep
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.340]  out of the hands of everybody.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.580]  And as Omar was saying earlier,
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:34.300]  you have a liquor store and how is the liquor packaged?
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:39.100]  It's in a glass bottle with a tamper evident lid.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:42.940]  And I feel like if we had jars with tamper evident lids
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:45.780]  on them so you know that they haven't been opened before,
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.620]  that's all good.
[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:48.220]  But instead, what are we doing?
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.900]  What's the worldwide problem?
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.540]  One of the big worldwide problems, plastic pollution.
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:54.020]  We're feeding into that.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:59.020]  So we're undermining the economy while at the same time,
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:02.020]  undermining the environment.
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:05.180]  And these are our big problems, local and global.
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:09.460]  And they're being exasperated by these stupid policies
[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:14.460]  that are put in place by this bullshit bureaucracy.
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:19.620]  And I don't see it as being sustainable.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:23.580]  And it's a bummer because you're basically taking something
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:28.580]  that could be the savior of a lot of situations.
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:32.500]  And you're turning it into something that is just
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:38.460]  either neutral or in some ways it's harmful
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:42.260]  because there was already something that was operating
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:47.260]  on a higher level being dumbed down to this bullshit.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:51.020]  And typically when things become mainstreamed,
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:55.620]  they lose some of their luster and their value.
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:58.860]  And this was something that could have really been elevated
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.140]  and it's getting fucked up.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:07.140]  So those are the things that I can see
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.700]  that could be influenced in a positive way
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:12.940]  that might make a change.
[02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:17.260]  And maybe at a different time,
[02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:18.580]  I'd have other thoughts about it
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:22.340]  that might be more useful or articulate.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:25.060]  But at this point, those are the things that I can see
[02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:29.820]  right off that are just sticking out like a big red flag
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:34.220]  where it's like, you guys being the bureaucracy
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:37.300]  and the government are just fucking everything up.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:42.140]  And if there was a way to remedy those things,
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.060]  it would be a lot better.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:48.260]  And also giving people access to be able to take part,
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:50.340]  you have people already doing this.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:53.860]  And I know people who have been doing it forever.
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:59.500]  It's like Todd mentioned the greenhouses
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.860]  and how, oh, if it was hemp
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:03.140]  and then you could fight it in court.
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:08.140]  Well, what happened was they were very clever.
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:10.020]  There's a point where you go,
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.820]  okay, it's gonna take all of this money
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:13.340]  because we need real enforcement,
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:18.060]  choppers, feet on the ground, all of this different stuff,
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:20.060]  paying overtime to all of these guys,
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:24.100]  which some of those guys make 600 grand a year.
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:26.740]  These are guys who make a $70,000 salary
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:29.820]  and now they're making over a half million in overtime
[02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:31.860]  fighting plants.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:34.780]  These are some brave lawyers fighting plants.
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:38.980]  So the reality is though that there is no case.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:42.460]  You get a letter and it's the county
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.460]  and the county owns your property.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:46.780]  You pay them your property taxes.
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:50.180]  So when you receive a letter that says $10,000 a day
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.740]  and you don't cut down your crop
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.620]  and your property is worth $200,000
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:58.420]  and you continue to grow your crop for 20 days longer
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:01.260]  than they told you and they check their satellites,
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:02.580]  then they can just take your property.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:04.300]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:06.700]  It's not a matter of fighting the case.
[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:09.540]  And in some cases, that can happen
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:12.580]  because you have one little structure
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:15.620]  that caused them to send you those letters.
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:20.620]  So there's a lot of different ways
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:25.660]  that things are fucked up.
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:29.740]  And that is one way right there
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:34.460]  because of how 64 reads that the smaller the jurisdiction is
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:38.540]  the more authority they have over stuff.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:40.540]  And it seems like it's cool because it's like,
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:44.140]  okay, so Mendocino can say, hey, you can grow all you want.
[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:47.100]  Well, the state says you can have six plants.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.500]  So everybody assumes, okay, well, you can have six plants.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.420]  That means you can grow six monster plants.
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:52.540]  If you're really talented,
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:54.900]  you can grow 15 or 20 pounds off a plant.
[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:57.020]  You can grow a whole ton of weed,
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:03:59.140]  not a literal ton, but a lot.
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:03.100]  And in Mendocino County, they said, no, it's six plants
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:05.820]  or a 10 by 10, whichever is less.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:09.020]  So it hasn't played out to be great
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.300]  the way that that's written.
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:15.300]  And I agree with Todd that you need to make steps forward.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:20.580]  And I'm sure there are some places where maybe 64
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:23.940]  made things better for growers growing.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:26.820]  But the thing I can see about it that's good.
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:29.100]  And I agree with him on is that it made it
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:33.460]  so that it's not this, you're not going to jail.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:37.060]  And that's amazing because going to jail for that is fucked.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.900]  I mean, if you made a movie about this whole thing
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:41.660]  and it was 50 years and everything was truly legal,
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.900]  it'd be like watching fucking Braveheart or something.
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.820]  And somebody's fucking, somebody's taking your property
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:48.820]  and all this different shit.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.660]  It's craziness.
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:55.660]  But it's just that in some areas like up here,
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.820]  if you did just go ahead and say, okay,
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:02.860]  I'm only going to grow 25 monster plants.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:04.260]  They let you do that.
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:06.740]  And the cops would show up to your house and they'd say,
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:09.220]  hey, you have 35, you need to cut down 10.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.380]  We'll be back to check.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.500]  And then they'd never come back.
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:13.540]  And if they did come back, oh, you have 25.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.660]  Okay, you're good.
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:17.580]  And so it was on a functional level,
[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:20.340]  it was legal under 215.
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:23.060]  And I understand that you couldn't grow 5,000 plants
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:26.620]  and have a stack of scripts and say that that was the same,
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:30.060]  but you were able to be able to get by.
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:32.260]  And there was a lot of people who were really
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:37.860]  the original people up here who are outdate me
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.020]  by 30 or 40 years.
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:41.860]  And they were able to get by doing that.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:45.540]  And now those same people get letters
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:48.540]  that say they can only grow a few plants.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:52.780]  And it's not like they can just go ahead
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:54.460]  and reroute their energy and say,
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:57.340]  oh, I'm just going to go get a degree right now.
[02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:00.500]  Dude's 73, got rheumatoid arthritis.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.260]  And now is told that his property
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:03.660]  is going to get taken away from him.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.980]  So on that level, in those cases,
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:07.940]  it's not a whole lot different than getting busted
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:09.620]  and having them take your property.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:12.820]  So those are some issues and it's a nuanced conversation.
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:17.820]  And I don't have, I don't like to make broad arguments
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:23.540]  like 64 is way worse, 215 was fucked or anything like that.
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.900]  It's just, there's these certain points
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.420]  that I feel like can be discussed.
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:31.420]  And those are my opinions on the subject.
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:33.340]  Can I mention this?
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:35.300]  I think it's funny you say that,
[02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:37.780]  because I feel like from my perspective,
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:39.940]  it's always been effed up.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:43.500]  It's just different various degrees of effed up,
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.820]  if that makes sense.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:50.620]  And believe it or not, when we were hanging out with Dennis
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:52.940]  and arguing with Dennis over things,
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.340]  I had a compassion club
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.260]  where I was actually distributing cannabis.
[02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:58.740]  And I was actually doing a podcast
[02:06:58.740 --> 02:06:59.820]  with people who were sick
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:03.060]  and 215 didn't actually legalize that activity.
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:05.020]  And Dennis had Market Street at the time.
[02:07:05.020 --> 02:07:08.860]  And I was just like, why wouldn't you write this in?
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:11.380]  Why wouldn't you actually legalize our activities?
[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.580]  This is really gonna kill us.
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:15.660]  And he was afraid it wouldn't pass
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.140]  because he didn't have confidence
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:20.060]  that it would pass with real legalization.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:23.980]  And it was funny because Jack used to scream at him
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:25.980]  that because it didn't go far enough
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.020]  basically low level prosecutions,
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:33.700]  the racism that was systemic with cannabis prohibition,
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.580]  cops have been using a pocket full of weed
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:38.700]  to bust people forever since the 20th century
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:40.740]  allowed it in the 30s.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:45.300]  And he felt that people wouldn't fight for real legalization
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.580]  or their real freedom,
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.020]  whatever you define that as,
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:50.100]  because they would get comfortable with the medical laws.
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:52.340]  And it was weird, because it kind of happened.
[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:55.860]  And even now, I feel like the transition
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:57.820]  it's still uncomfortable.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:58.660]  You know what I mean?
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:01.540]  But when I started the San Diego Compassion Club, man,
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.420]  I started that shit in March of 95.
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:05.860]  I got rated in July.
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:07.380]  I mean, they didn't play.
[02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:12.380]  And it's hard now, don't get me wrong,
[02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:14.380]  but it was crazy then.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:17.100]  And things changed for me.
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:19.620]  I mean, I was up there in 94, 95
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:23.740]  before we passed the initiative in November of 96.
[02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.700]  And it was a bit of a different vibe
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:28.420]  in the Emerald Triangle, in my opinion.
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:31.260]  And unfortunately, I think a lot of people moved up
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:34.740]  into that area just for the sake of making money
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:36.100]  and didn't care about the environment,
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:37.180]  didn't care about the streams,
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:38.220]  didn't care about the Eel River,
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:39.460]  didn't care about any of the things
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.500]  that seemed important to a lot of us
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.460]  and really desecrated the place
[02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.620]  and gave the rest of us that were already up there
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:47.540]  growing weed, trying to do it organically,
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:49.140]  trying to do it right.
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:51.260]  It gave us in a way a bad name.
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.660]  And it's weird that we get lumped in together
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:55.380]  and I kind of hate it
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:57.420]  because I've always identified with the place
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:00.220]  and it's always how, I mean, I'm not religious,
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.900]  but man, when you're in the forest
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.780]  and you see these old growth trees,
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:06.380]  it feels real spiritual, you know what I'm saying?
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:08.380]  And to see people, I don't know,
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:12.220]  just coming up there and raping the place over cannabis
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.740]  really upsets me.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:15.300]  And I don't know how to fix it all.
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.460]  And while you were talking,
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:18.940]  I was thinking even with federal prohibition,
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:21.580]  even if they were to remove cannabis from the CSA,
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:23.340]  which is probably gonna happen,
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.540]  it's not gonna change local enforcement
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:27.220]  because local enforcement is still gonna come in
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:28.660]  and be able to beat decks.
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:30.100]  And it means that realistically,
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:32.820]  we'll probably all end up moving somewhere
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:37.820]  where they allow us to be free to grow cannabis.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:41.260]  And because local jurisdictions
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:42.460]  are still gonna be problematic.
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:45.900]  Think about this, Jack Daniels is still distilled
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:48.580]  in an area that still prohibits the consumption
[02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.220]  of the whiskey that they make.
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.460]  The only person legally allowed to drink the whiskey
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.220]  at the Jack Daniels distillery
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:57.380]  is the dude whose job it is to taste the whiskey.
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:02.300]  So we may always wind up with some really whack local rules.
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:05.460]  And that's just America in a weird way.
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.220]  And I don't know how to fix that.
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:08.100]  And Jack Daniels,
[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.580]  even though they're in a prohibited place,
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:12.820]  won't move because of the environmental conditions
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:14.980]  in that 1600 acre estate
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:17.780]  that they've been making whiskey at forever in a day.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:20.420]  So I really think that this is gonna be
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:23.820]  an interesting industry moving forward.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:27.620]  And who knows though, how it could change.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:31.020]  I mean, if you can lobby at a local level, that's one thing,
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:33.700]  but there has to be a way to attack this
[02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:36.060]  on another initiative basis
[02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:37.820]  so that we're taxed appropriately
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.540]  instead of getting hit with this frigging syntax
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.060]  over and over and over again
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:44.860]  for a product that literally grows on trees.
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:47.460]  And I think we all should be pressuring
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:49.100]  the big legal companies
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.260]  to get off their ridiculous price structure
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.380]  because there should be access of cannabis to people
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:57.940]  and expensive cannabis only prohibits access,
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:10:59.220]  at least in my opinion.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:03.340]  So if it's really about people and patients,
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:07.460]  then I don't think the prices should be so inflated,
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:10.460]  in my opinion, but I've always thought that.
[02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:12.540]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.700]  I was just gonna say,
[02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:18.300]  if they switched it and step up a little bit,
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:21.900]  I mean, right now it's amounting to some people
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.860]  because of all the different fees and taxes,
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:27.300]  it's like you could drop the price
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:29.740]  by probably almost 40% instantly
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.780]  if they just got out of your pockets.
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:37.260]  So that would be helpful right there.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:42.260]  And then I also see it as far as access goes,
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:47.020]  if I need medicine,
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:52.500]  then USP works.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:56.500]  If I want boutique Napa Valley shit,
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:58.580]  then I want boutique Napa Valley shit.
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:00.660]  And I think there's room for everybody.
[02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:02.980]  And I think it's pretty easy to produce medicine
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:05.420]  to a price point where somebody could get their medicine
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:06.740]  for a few dollars a day.
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:10.660]  But that's definitely not the level of stuff
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:13.780]  that I wanna do because I'm a horticulturist
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:15.660]  and not an agriculturist.
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.420]  And I wanna be able to produce something
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.420]  on this certain level and I really cannot do it.
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:22.020]  I know the difference between when I was trying
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:24.260]  to grow a lot of weed and when I tried to grow
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:26.660]  a little bit less or a lot less.
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:29.020]  And it's the difference between,
[02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:32.740]  okay, I wanna smoke my weed or I gotta find somebody
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:35.580]  who doesn't grow this much weed so I can smoke their weed.
[02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:39.780]  And that's, you want the weed from like,
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:41.100]  the best weed I've ever smoked
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:42.820]  is when a lady gets a grow room
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:45.900]  and she grows her one pound every two months.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:50.340]  And she can't sell that weed for $150 a pound.
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:53.820]  But the guy who's planting 60 acres of auto flowers,
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.940]  he can do that no problem and it'll work
[02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:58.580]  because it's a whole different thing.
[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:02.740]  And I think there's room for everybody to be able to do both.
[02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:06.820]  And I think that there should be both.
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:09.700]  And I think that at this point in the way everything is
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:13.380]  with legalization, you should be able to go buy
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:16.620]  a paper bag full of weed for $4.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.620]  But I don't have a problem also with somebody selling a gram
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:21.500]  for whatever they think that that would be worth
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:23.260]  of that particular thing.
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:26.060]  It's like when people were, in the medical days,
[02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:28.420]  people would be like, I need this cut for medicine.
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:31.780]  And I'd be like, that cut kind of,
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:33.700]  it's not gonna help with your anxiety.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:35.300]  It causes a lot of anxiety.
[02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:36.900]  I think maybe you just want this cut
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:38.380]  because it's a high dollar cut.
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:41.580]  Or, like there's a difference, there's a divide there.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:46.060]  So I think that everything can be honored
[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:48.340]  and the differences of what it is,
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.060]  but I do agree with you.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:54.700]  I think people should be able to have access
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:56.940]  and stuff should be close to free.
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:14:00.060]  I mean, I always, over the years,
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:02.260]  like I make seeds and I grow weed.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:05.700]  And I can tell you that seeds wise,
[02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:08.540]  I've given, it's always a lot more free seeds.
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:13.980]  And weed wise, it's always a lot of free weed
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:17.860]  because it's my favorite part of it.
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:19.140]  Like when I started growing weed,
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:21.660]  my favorite thing was to be able to show up.
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:23.020]  I had a buddy back in the day
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:25.740]  who he'd give you a big like untrimmed branch of weed
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:26.780]  and go, this is war.
[02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.380]  And the next time you saw him, you'd have to go,
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:29.420]  oh yeah, here you go.
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:32.820]  And you hit him back with another big one ounce branch
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:33.660]  or something.
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:34.620]  And that was the fun of it.
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:39.020]  And I always, when it was still loose,
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:41.300]  that was one of my problems too with 64
[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.180]  was just the restrictions.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:44.700]  When it was still really loose,
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.780]  I could come to the shows and I could bring
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:51.740]  a half pound or something.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.540]  And I just hand everybody a big stick of weed.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:56.580]  And then all of a sudden it was like,
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:01.460]  oh, is the cannabis controller,
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:03.220]  is there undercover standing out here?
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:05.580]  I can't really hand anything out.
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:07.740]  If I'm working here, I can't give anything out.
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:09.220]  And there was those restrictions.
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:12.540]  And I'm not saying that the trade-off isn't worth it
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:15.100]  for people to be able to clean their record
[02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:16.460]  and get out of jail and everything.
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:18.140]  It's like I said, it's nuanced.
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:22.940]  It's not just all ones and zeros.
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:26.060]  So there's those issues that I see
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:28.380]  that have been dealt with,
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.420]  and there's the ones that are bad.
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:33.380]  And I still think that patient to patient,
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:36.940]  farmer to patient, things could be loose
[02:15:36.940 --> 02:15:41.660]  just because it's such an innocuous item.
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:42.620]  You know what I mean?
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:45.300]  Nobody can walk up and give you a quarter pound
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.740]  and fuck up your life.
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:50.500]  It's not like they're handing you some meth
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.340]  and you don't know what it is or something.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:57.340]  So that's just my take on some of those things.
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:00.260]  Some fentanyl.
[02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:01.980]  Yeah, you know?
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:06.980]  So I wanna throw it to Dan and get his take.
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:09.780]  And then Jackson, you're gonna...
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:13.020]  So there are like 250 people still watching right now
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:18.020]  and I'm impressed because it's 11.20 at night.
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:21.060]  But you're gonna give this learning moment.
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.580]  But let me go to Dan first.
[02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:34.550]  Wait, you're muted.
[02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:37.790]  All right.
[02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:38.910]  Yeah, anyway, I was saying
[02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:41.750]  I've been really enjoying listening to everybody.
[02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:43.550]  The thing that's really unfortunate
[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:45.870]  is that to make these changes
[02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:47.470]  and get something done about this,
[02:16:47.470 --> 02:16:50.230]  it's all about, it's all money.
[02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:51.510]  And so Todd, as you mentioned,
[02:16:51.510 --> 02:16:53.110]  like getting the big corporations
[02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:54.870]  to do something towards this,
[02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:57.710]  they all have really well-paid lobbyists
[02:16:57.710 --> 02:17:00.390]  that help get all these different amendments
[02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:04.030]  and addendums to legislation drafted.
[02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:06.350]  And there's so much at stake for everybody,
[02:17:06.350 --> 02:17:07.270]  even on their level,
[02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:10.030]  because the law is written in such a complicated way
[02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:12.790]  that even these massive corporations
[02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:14.270]  that seem like they're doing so well
[02:17:14.270 --> 02:17:17.030]  or generating so many millions of dollars,
[02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:19.950]  they're the ones that are really creating the real Babylon
[02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:21.590]  because they're already so big
[02:17:21.590 --> 02:17:24.830]  that to keep up with what they've created,
[02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:26.870]  even on their level,
[02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:29.470]  they're still fighting for survival as well.
[02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:32.390]  And then in terms of the people in this discussion
[02:17:32.390 --> 02:17:34.830]  who I consider kind of cannabis purists
[02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:38.910]  of people who likely didn't start doing this
[02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:41.670]  because they wanted to make money doing it,
[02:17:41.670 --> 02:17:44.430]  but because they had something special
[02:17:44.430 --> 02:17:45.670]  that connected them to the plant
[02:17:45.670 --> 02:17:47.710]  and a freedom that the plant kind of creates.
[02:17:47.710 --> 02:17:49.790]  It's like, and the type of folks
[02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:50.670]  who probably would go on
[02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:53.550]  and watch this multi-hour conversation on YouTube.
[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:56.710]  I mean, people who are cannabis purists like that
[02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:59.590]  are a very small percentage of consumers.
[02:17:59.590 --> 02:18:02.070]  What I always thought was cool about cannabis
[02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:04.470]  was the opportunity to educate
[02:18:04.470 --> 02:18:07.310]  because I think all this stuff is so fascinating.
[02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:09.310]  And I know that all of you do.
[02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:12.550]  And so that's what I've always liked to do is engage
[02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:15.150]  your everyday consumer who does wanna go to a dispensary
[02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:18.110]  in LA and just buy the cheapest product that they can find.
[02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:19.350]  And they don't care what it's called
[02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:20.190]  or where it came from.
[02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:22.030]  They just wanna get high.
[02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:24.030]  When someone who has a lot of insight
[02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:26.870]  can engage in those types of folks,
[02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:29.390]  that's something that I think helps a lot.
[02:18:29.390 --> 02:18:32.350]  And it's something really important.
[02:18:32.350 --> 02:18:35.790]  And that's what sucks about the Prop 64.
[02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:37.270]  It's taken a lot of that.
[02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:40.750]  It's not personal anymore.
[02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:42.270]  Like Jackson was saying at the events,
[02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:44.270]  you used to get to meet consumers
[02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:46.550]  and being able to offer products direct to consumers
[02:18:46.550 --> 02:18:48.790]  to meet other farmers and try their products.
[02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:51.550]  I mean, to me, that's the highest value cannabis
[02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:55.230]  on the planet when you can experience a person
[02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:57.470]  and the energy and the work and craft
[02:18:57.470 --> 02:18:59.910]  that went into creating what they've made.
[02:18:59.910 --> 02:19:03.510]  And you can feel it when it expresses it.
[02:19:03.510 --> 02:19:08.150]  And so it's kind of like, yeah.
[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:10.750]  If the question was, what's a perfect scenario?
[02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:12.910]  There's not gonna be one
[02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:15.350]  because there's so many different types of people
[02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:18.550]  and there's so many different types of interests
[02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:20.830]  and intentions and why everyone's coming into it.
[02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:23.910]  Yeah, I mean, it's a super loaded question,
[02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:25.950]  but in terms of making change,
[02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:29.270]  I'm down to hop on that bandwagon anytime
[02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:30.710]  that someone can get it together.
[02:19:30.710 --> 02:19:34.270]  But that needs a lot of energy and a lot of leadership.
[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:36.590]  And most importantly, it's just money.
[02:19:36.590 --> 02:19:38.670]  And people who are cannabis purists are too busy
[02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:40.510]  trying to enjoy their quality of life
[02:19:40.510 --> 02:19:42.750]  and grow cannabis and share cannabis
[02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:47.310]  than engaging in that type of shit.
[02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:48.470]  But either way-
[02:19:48.470 --> 02:19:51.470]  I'll say something to that.
[02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:54.870]  Being someone that for so long
[02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:57.310]  was trying to make a difference,
[02:19:57.310 --> 02:20:00.390]  not realizing how, but trying so many different paths,
[02:20:00.390 --> 02:20:04.070]  initiatives, cannabis clubs, documentaries,
[02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:06.750]  just being proactive, growing, giving away pot.
[02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:09.110]  You don't know what to do that's gonna really work
[02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:10.110]  in that sense.
[02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.950]  But,
[02:20:10.990 --> 02:20:12.910]  it's about not giving up, I guess,
[02:20:12.910 --> 02:20:15.270]  because we've really come a long way
[02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:16.990]  in the last 30 years of this struggle
[02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:19.230]  since the early 90s till now.
[02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:22.150]  This is a rainbow of change,
[02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:24.990]  and I can only imagine it's gonna get better
[02:20:24.990 --> 02:20:27.710]  as we go forward and more people understand
[02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:29.630]  their own endocannabinoid system better
[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:32.670]  and realize the absurdity of cannabis prohibition
[02:20:32.670 --> 02:20:34.030]  is just not logical.
[02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:36.030]  And I think that's what we need to do.
[02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:37.790]  And I think that's what we need to do.
[02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:39.350]  And I think that's what we need to do.
[02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:43.150]  Cannabis prohibition is just not logical on any level.
[02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:45.710]  It's just ridiculous that they're doing this to us.
[02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:48.310]  But I don't think we're gonna be free
[02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:51.230]  until really the price structure of cannabis changes
[02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:53.030]  and they stop coming after us
[02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:56.510]  because they're jealous of us potentially making money
[02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:58.350]  like we're growing on trees.
[02:20:58.350 --> 02:21:00.390]  And that's just, I think, reality
[02:21:00.390 --> 02:21:01.670]  because they control commerce
[02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:03.750]  in every other part of our life
[02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:05.390]  and they're not gonna give it up.
[02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:08.830]  They kept going after the moonshiners after prohibition ended
[02:21:08.830 --> 02:21:10.470]  because they were taxing them.
[02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:15.710]  So I don't know how in a way it's ever gonna change
[02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:17.710]  unless we change society on a bigger level
[02:21:17.710 --> 02:21:20.950]  because cannabis is always gonna be worth something,
[02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:22.790]  at least if you grow it well.
[02:21:24.750 --> 02:21:27.870]  Well, I think so many cannabis entrepreneurs
[02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:30.550]  are like very intelligent, sophisticated,
[02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:35.190]  articulate human beings who have shied away historically
[02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:37.830]  thus far from running for public office.
[02:21:37.870 --> 02:21:40.270]  I think that needs to change.
[02:21:40.270 --> 02:21:44.350]  Actually, if you can run a functional cannabis business
[02:21:44.350 --> 02:21:47.830]  with all of the crazy taxation and 280E
[02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:50.510]  and the massive regulations,
[02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:53.070]  having a guaranteed cushy government job
[02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:55.310]  is pretty easy by comparison.
[02:21:55.310 --> 02:21:59.190]  All you gotta do is read your agenda in minutes
[02:21:59.190 --> 02:22:01.230]  for your next public hearing.
[02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:03.310]  And in some counties,
[02:22:03.310 --> 02:22:05.630]  the compensation is pretty off the hook.
[02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:09.550]  And so I would say, some of the listeners,
[02:22:09.550 --> 02:22:12.270]  if we have 200 plus people here,
[02:22:12.270 --> 02:22:13.670]  as well as the panelists,
[02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:16.350]  really do consider running for public office.
[02:22:16.350 --> 02:22:18.750]  And even if you don't win the election,
[02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:20.910]  just by asking the tough questions
[02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:24.950]  and by taking positions that other politicians
[02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:26.550]  are not willing to take,
[02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:29.230]  you're gonna force them to take a stand
[02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:31.030]  just by talking about it.
[02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:33.430]  And so that's what I think is gonna take
[02:22:33.430 --> 02:22:36.510]  to change this really onerous,
[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:39.070]  burdensome cannabis industry.
[02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:41.910]  Eventually people are just gonna say like,
[02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:46.910]  look, what does it cost really to get a new initiative?
[02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:52.550]  And it's not like tens of millions of dollars
[02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:54.550]  as sometimes people try to scare you.
[02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:58.510]  It's not hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[02:22:58.510 --> 02:23:02.950]  but it's not an insurmountable feat
[02:23:03.470 --> 02:23:05.310]  in a state of 40 million people
[02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:07.190]  where we have a cannabis industry
[02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:09.830]  with thousands of operators.
[02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:16.190]  Well, it's like Cody Bass in Lake Tahoe.
[02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:18.790]  I mean, his whole reason for running for office
[02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:20.950]  was because he was just getting fucked
[02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:22.270]  over and over and over.
[02:23:22.270 --> 02:23:25.030]  And it was like, I'm just gonna run for office.
[02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.870]  And he won.
[02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:29.270]  And then once he won, he stopped getting fucked over.
[02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:31.550]  Now he runs the-
[02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:32.390]  It's amazing.
[02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:35.030]  He helps run the show in South Lake Tahoe.
[02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:37.390]  And so I think that's like a good example
[02:23:37.390 --> 02:23:42.390]  of how just running for office can make a huge change.
[02:23:43.710 --> 02:23:44.550]  And who's another-
[02:23:44.550 --> 02:23:46.950]  So by the way, Jackson, I think if you run
[02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:49.750]  for any office in Mendocino,
[02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:52.150]  we could probably rally the troops to like,
[02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:54.550]  you could run for sheriff.
[02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:56.510]  And I mean, think about the guy you're running-
[02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:57.790]  You can't run for sheriff.
[02:23:57.790 --> 02:24:00.470]  Yeah, you gotta have like specialized like post training.
[02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:02.190]  Like I studied it for somebody
[02:24:02.190 --> 02:24:03.910]  who wanted to run for sheriff.
[02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:04.750]  A cannabis-
[02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:06.150]  Well, he could quickly squeeze that in.
[02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:08.470]  How long would it take to get that training done?
[02:24:08.470 --> 02:24:12.910]  It takes like, to get enough peace officer standard
[02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.830]  and training credits to be a police officer.
[02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:17.350]  It's like, I think 150 credit hours.
[02:24:17.350 --> 02:24:18.470]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:19.750]  You have to go to police academy.
[02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:21.510]  Then you gotta be a pig for a few years.
[02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:22.670]  Pardon my French.
[02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:25.350]  And then you'd be eligible.
[02:24:25.350 --> 02:24:29.190]  But you know what you can run for would be like supervisor.
[02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:30.590]  Where do you live in Mendo?
[02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:34.230]  Yeah, he's in Mendo.
[02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:35.110]  Mendo, yeah.
[02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:37.070]  So he could run for supervisor.
[02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:39.310]  I mean, if you don't want something that's like so heavy,
[02:24:39.310 --> 02:24:41.310]  you could run for like school board.
[02:24:41.310 --> 02:24:42.630]  That's pretty easy.
[02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:45.510]  There's like water boards that are local.
[02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:47.750]  There's fire protection districts.
[02:24:47.750 --> 02:24:49.910]  There's like numerous ways to get involved.
[02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:52.830]  I have clients who are like volunteer firefighters.
[02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:54.710]  And that's like a pretty cool, you know,
[02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:57.670]  community gig that you could do.
[02:24:58.630 --> 02:25:01.670]  And you know, once you're a volunteer firefighter,
[02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:04.710]  all sorts of doors open because cops think
[02:25:04.710 --> 02:25:08.270]  that firefighters are public safety professionals,
[02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:10.830]  which they are, and they treat them like their own.
[02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:17.910]  So that's the Trojan horse to get in the cops good graces.
[02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:22.350]  Well, when you're saving lives, you're just a hero.
[02:25:22.350 --> 02:25:26.270]  It's interesting, because like three of us are from Boston
[02:25:26.270 --> 02:25:29.030]  and you guys are kind of like, I'm in my mid forties
[02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:31.670]  and you guys are kind of the same age.
[02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:36.670]  And like in the nineties, my reason for selling weed
[02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:41.550]  was because I smoked it, all my friends smoked it.
[02:25:41.550 --> 02:25:42.790]  I had no problem with it.
[02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:45.390]  And I was just like, I approached it rationally
[02:25:45.390 --> 02:25:49.910]  where it was like, it's nonsense that we're all paying
[02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:53.350]  high prices to people we don't know to get weed.
[02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:54.670]  And then I started selling it.
[02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:58.350]  And then I took pride in like sourcing.
[02:25:58.670 --> 02:26:00.550]  And it was like coming from Vermont.
[02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:05.550]  It was coming from like Humboldt, BC,
[02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:08.750]  and then introducing my friends to stuff
[02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:11.590]  where they were all psyched to smoke it.
[02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:14.590]  And that's kind of like, and I forget who was talking
[02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:16.950]  earlier about what made me think about this,
[02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:20.950]  but like this shit could be so cool.
[02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:22.750]  I think like the farmer's markets
[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:26.310]  are what I miss the most right now, like Emerald Exchange.
[02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:28.430]  So that's the time.
[02:26:28.430 --> 02:26:31.990]  There was talk of having like a temporary retail permit
[02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:35.990]  with a few times a year that people
[02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:40.190]  who are licensed cultivators could have basically
[02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:41.790]  what you're talking about, a farmer's market
[02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:43.670]  and temporary retail sales.
[02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:45.190]  I would love to see that.
[02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:47.150]  And that doesn't take a whole initiative.
[02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:48.870]  That could just be a simple change of law
[02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:51.310]  for the next legislative session.
[02:26:51.310 --> 02:26:53.590]  That was proposed and went pretty far along.
[02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:56.550]  And then the United Cannabis Business Association
[02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:58.910]  was afraid of having all these like crazy
[02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:59.750]  farmer's markets in LA.
[02:26:59.750 --> 02:27:01.550]  That's Jerry Killough.
[02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:03.150]  Yeah, I know Jerry.
[02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:06.910]  That's bullshit because it's basically a retailer fearing,
[02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:11.910]  it'd be like if Ralph's feared the farmer's markets in LA.
[02:27:14.270 --> 02:27:15.110]  That's right.
[02:27:16.150 --> 02:27:18.350]  Like there's no reason to fear it.
[02:27:18.350 --> 02:27:19.870]  And if it's only four times a year,
[02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:24.790]  it's not really gonna present like an ongoing threat
[02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:26.670]  from an economic perspective,
[02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:30.470]  but that would really like allow farmers to get out there
[02:27:30.470 --> 02:27:34.310]  and to develop their own cult following.
[02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:36.590]  I think the problem would be like,
[02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:39.270]  back in the Emerald Cup days,
[02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:42.070]  like people would literally bring pounds and pounds
[02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:44.910]  to the Emerald Cup that would constantly get resupplied
[02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:48.710]  and they were able to sell poundage at the cup.
[02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:51.670]  And it would always amaze me because,
[02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:53.630]  the fairgrounds in Sonoma County,
[02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:57.110]  which normally were like a complete prohibition zone,
[02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:58.950]  like the rest of Sonoma County,
[02:27:58.950 --> 02:28:03.510]  would temporarily turn into a temporary autonomous zone
[02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:06.790]  where cannabis was freely traded with no taxation
[02:28:06.790 --> 02:28:10.470]  and basically laissez-faire commerce.
[02:28:10.470 --> 02:28:12.750]  And those were definitely the days.
[02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:15.630]  And what products were the most successful?
[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:19.750]  Well, there was such a multiplicity of products
[02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:22.550]  that there's a lot of innovation,
[02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:24.990]  and I remember when people would have like,
[02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:26.430]  all sorts of cool products.
[02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:30.950]  And I think it would far surpass what you see now
[02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:34.630]  in dispensaries with kind of these homogenized brands
[02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:38.550]  and a lot of the CPG people are saying,
[02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:41.550]  make something that is standardized, repeatable,
[02:28:41.550 --> 02:28:43.110]  same consumer experience,
[02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:45.870]  time after time after time, beat McDonald's.
[02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:48.790]  And that works, but there's a different model,
[02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:53.510]  which I think is based on ultra premium craft cannabis
[02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:56.710]  and where every vintage is different.
[02:28:56.710 --> 02:29:00.310]  And I think somebody talked about,
[02:29:00.310 --> 02:29:03.030]  it was Todd talking about Jack Daniels.
[02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:06.070]  They're in a dry county, but they don't wanna move
[02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:09.350]  because of the unique environmental qualities
[02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:12.270]  that are expressed in the product.
[02:29:12.270 --> 02:29:14.550]  And I think that's the quintessence
[02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:17.550]  of Terrar based appellations.
[02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:21.550]  And so, cannabis is unique
[02:29:21.550 --> 02:29:24.710]  because now in our fucked up Prop 64
[02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:26.710]  derived regulatory system,
[02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:30.430]  Justin Calvino got high with Janine Coleman
[02:29:30.430 --> 02:29:32.670]  and a bunch of other OGs,
[02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:35.910]  and they got an idea of having cannabis appellations,
[02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:37.030]  which have taken root
[02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:41.510]  and are now part of California legislation.
[02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:45.270]  And I posted a link to the latest regulations
[02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:46.550]  for cannabis appellations.
[02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:49.870]  I think Jesse was talking about appellations as well,
[02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:53.590]  where he is, and that's gonna be an incredible opportunity,
[02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:55.670]  like looking at the long-term.
[02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:59.750]  Even if there's an initiative to legalize cannabis,
[02:29:59.750 --> 02:30:01.110]  the one thing that can be salvaged
[02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:02.790]  from the current regulatory regime
[02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:06.190]  is this idea of having appellations
[02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:08.270]  that are grounded in Terrar
[02:30:08.270 --> 02:30:10.550]  and that will be compatible
[02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:16.550]  part of the international law.
[02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:17.390]  And so now-
[02:30:17.390 --> 02:30:19.030]  Is this Frenchy approved?
[02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:21.230]  Yeah, Frenchy likes it because-
[02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:24.510]  Definition of how the French define something.
[02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:26.750]  He's like, use a different name.
[02:30:28.310 --> 02:30:31.590]  Yes, well, I think now there was a conscious effort
[02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:33.910]  to use appellations of origin
[02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:36.470]  in the international,
[02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:41.310]  I guess, trademark law sense of the term
[02:30:41.310 --> 02:30:44.230]  because appellations of origin is a concept
[02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:47.590]  in the World Intellectual Property Organization.
[02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:51.310]  And we have like appellations of origin for wines,
[02:30:51.310 --> 02:30:55.070]  like Beaujolais and for all the fancy wines
[02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:58.390]  that you can think of, as well as cheese,
[02:30:58.390 --> 02:31:00.870]  as well as honey, as well as all sorts of products,
[02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:05.870]  tequila, and because of that,
[02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:10.310]  I think it was brilliant for the idea to be proposed
[02:31:10.310 --> 02:31:12.510]  for having cannabis appellations.
[02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:16.110]  And will it really build value?
[02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:18.990]  It depends on the appellations that are established.
[02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:23.030]  If somebody establishes a two buck truck appellation,
[02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:26.150]  will that mean it's synonymous with quality?
[02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:29.950]  I think it really depends.
[02:31:29.950 --> 02:31:32.990]  And there's a lot of criticism
[02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:36.270]  of the current appellations regulations
[02:31:36.270 --> 02:31:40.270]  because they have really high barrier to entry,
[02:31:40.270 --> 02:31:43.830]  high fees, $20,000 to propose an appellation,
[02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:47.790]  which I think is not fair for many struggling cultivators.
[02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:50.310]  I mean, we're talking about people who,
[02:31:50.310 --> 02:31:54.710]  what really sets them apart is that they create products
[02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:57.790]  that are just unparalleled in quality.
[02:31:57.830 --> 02:32:02.630]  And the stuff that is mass produced
[02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:04.550]  does not come close in quality
[02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:07.950]  to like some of this artisan cannabis that's out there
[02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:11.990]  that to me is really what is appealing about cannabis.
[02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:14.310]  I'm not interested in mass produced cannabis
[02:32:14.310 --> 02:32:18.430]  because usually the quality is, well, disgusting.
[02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:21.870]  And I guess I'm kind of a pot snob
[02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:24.510]  after having lived in Northern California for quite a while
[02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:27.470]  and being exposed to all the talent that's out here.
[02:32:28.430 --> 02:32:32.470]  But I really do think that there's incredible possibilities
[02:32:32.470 --> 02:32:33.830]  just like with craft beer
[02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:37.710]  and how craft beer overtook mass produced beer.
[02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:42.710]  I believe that craft cannabis will overtake cannabis 1.0,
[02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:45.150]  which is basically all these fools
[02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:47.670]  who don't know anything about cultivating cannabis,
[02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:50.310]  but do know how to get money out of investors.
[02:32:50.310 --> 02:32:53.790]  And they were giving like huge amounts of money to play with.
[02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:56.310]  Reading about the, what was it called?
[02:32:56.310 --> 02:32:58.550]  Genius, sub genius, what was that?
[02:32:58.550 --> 02:33:01.350]  Sub genius fund, this genius fund,
[02:33:02.350 --> 02:33:04.430]  how much money they were given to play with
[02:33:04.430 --> 02:33:07.430]  and like how quickly they were spending the money.
[02:33:08.470 --> 02:33:12.510]  I have clients who would make that money go so far,
[02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:17.510]  they would build like a 50 year runway with $50 million,
[02:33:17.590 --> 02:33:19.510]  not like blow it all in like,
[02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:21.790]  and run out of money in a matter of years.
[02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:25.470]  And so I just think it's ludicrous,
[02:33:25.470 --> 02:33:28.870]  how investors were burned by fast talking.
[02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:31.910]  And I guess it's inevitable
[02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:35.190]  when people don't really understand the system,
[02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:38.310]  there's gonna be a lot of imposters and impersonators.
[02:33:38.310 --> 02:33:40.950]  But what I see now is the dinosaurs
[02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:43.430]  are gonna start dying off
[02:33:43.430 --> 02:33:46.270]  and they already have started just collapsing
[02:33:46.270 --> 02:33:48.110]  under their own weight.
[02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:51.110]  And the more agile craft operators
[02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:53.310]  who haven't really taken on debt
[02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:57.030]  and who are basically trying to keep everything in house,
[02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:01.870]  they have the agility to take over this next wave.
[02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:05.710]  So COVID-19 in a way did help the cannabis industry
[02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:08.070]  because now it's considered essential.
[02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:10.030]  Think about how many industries
[02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:12.430]  were allowed to keep on operating.
[02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:15.310]  And it seems like throughout the United States,
[02:34:15.310 --> 02:34:18.350]  wherever there's a licensed cannabis industry,
[02:34:18.350 --> 02:34:21.030]  at the state level, it was deemed essential.
[02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:24.630]  So that's gonna weigh heavily
[02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:27.190]  when in speeding up legalization
[02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:30.190]  and making opportunities available
[02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:33.990]  that people have been dreaming about for decades.
[02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:36.350]  Can I say something about the Appalachians?
[02:34:36.350 --> 02:34:37.190]  Yeah.
[02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:39.350]  The thing about the Appalachians
[02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:41.670]  is it could have such an incredible value
[02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:44.470]  to save these craft and legacy farmers
[02:34:44.470 --> 02:34:45.390]  like you're talking about.
[02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:47.950]  My concern about it is that,
[02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:50.550]  is it gonna be inclusive enough
[02:34:51.070 --> 02:34:53.270]  or is it gonna be just as complex
[02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:54.790]  as the current regulations
[02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:57.230]  that already prevented a lot of those people
[02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:58.630]  from participating?
[02:34:58.630 --> 02:35:01.950]  Because there's a lot to be said.
[02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:04.550]  There's a big discussion about Appalachians.
[02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:07.190]  There's a lot of research that needs to be done.
[02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:09.470]  The value you mentioned is long-term.
[02:35:09.470 --> 02:35:13.430]  It's not gonna be today's California consumer
[02:35:13.430 --> 02:35:17.270]  who is gonna understand and equate the value
[02:35:17.270 --> 02:35:18.790]  with those Appalachians.
[02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:21.590]  Pot snobby people who only want the best of the best
[02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:24.750]  and something that you can't get anywhere else.
[02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:26.870]  But that's a really minority group.
[02:35:26.870 --> 02:35:28.710]  The value for that is gonna come eventually
[02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:30.590]  when we have interstate commerce
[02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:33.150]  and some high-end rollers in New York City
[02:35:33.150 --> 02:35:34.870]  or people who really just love herb
[02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:36.270]  and they want the best of the best
[02:35:36.270 --> 02:35:37.790]  that you're ever gonna find
[02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:41.150]  with the dedication and diversity into the organics
[02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:44.790]  where you said like commercially produced weed is disgusting.
[02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:47.550]  It is and it isn't.
[02:35:47.630 --> 02:35:49.550]  Those people are very intelligent
[02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:51.350]  at learning how to balance minerals
[02:35:51.350 --> 02:35:56.350]  and apply intelligent and eventually mechanized,
[02:35:57.150 --> 02:36:00.270]  automated, large-scale cultivation
[02:36:00.270 --> 02:36:02.230]  and quality will get better.
[02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:03.670]  It'll keep getting better.
[02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:04.510]  But-
[02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:05.470]  Gradually, agreed.
[02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:07.470]  Each of those Appalachians though,
[02:36:07.470 --> 02:36:10.550]  besides the unique balance between
[02:36:10.550 --> 02:36:13.630]  its distance coastal versus inlet inland
[02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:17.470]  and its elevation and all those details
[02:36:18.350 --> 02:36:21.310]  that make those certain regions have that special taste,
[02:36:21.310 --> 02:36:23.630]  it's also the energy and the story
[02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:25.030]  of where it came from too.
[02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:27.190]  And so like I'm looking forward to down the line
[02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:30.190]  when someone in London is gonna think that
[02:36:31.430 --> 02:36:34.430]  a quarter ounce of Jackson's weed is priceless.
[02:36:34.430 --> 02:36:35.630]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:36.470]  But-
[02:36:36.470 --> 02:36:37.310]  Absolutely.
[02:36:37.310 --> 02:36:41.030]  My concern is that it could be just exclusive
[02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:44.990]  as 64 has been and without reaching out
[02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:47.750]  to those everyday smaller mom and pop farmers
[02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:49.870]  and not just the people who are parts
[02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:53.230]  of the organizations drafting the rules.
[02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:55.070]  That's the concern that I have.
[02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:59.030]  By exclusive do you mean now you have to pay your state
[02:36:59.030 --> 02:37:01.830]  and local permitting and licensing fees?
[02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:04.510]  You gotta pay for the organic stamp.
[02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:07.750]  You gotta pay for the Appalachian stamp.
[02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:09.510]  By exclusive I mean like this,
[02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:13.150]  if it's gonna be inclusive,
[02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:15.110]  that's when you go to all of the farmers
[02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:18.670]  and you don't forget about this guy who only grows
[02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:21.590]  a hundred or 150 pounds and never really needed much
[02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:23.190]  but get their point of view
[02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:25.990]  because maybe they've been on the mountain for 35 years
[02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:27.790]  and they can tell you a little bit
[02:37:27.790 --> 02:37:31.230]  of what they get out on their ridgetop
[02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:33.590]  versus the people who are gonna have the money
[02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:35.110]  to pay for it.
[02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:38.550]  I just wanna see those small farmers included
[02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:40.790]  because the way that those laws are being drafted
[02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:42.550]  and I don't understand all the details.
[02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:45.710]  But the talking points to me that are concerning
[02:37:45.710 --> 02:37:48.030]  is that you have to get everybody
[02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:50.150]  in that Appalachian participating.
[02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:53.310]  Like there's a way that you could.
[02:37:53.310 --> 02:37:55.670]  Not really, let me break it down for you.
[02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:58.630]  You need three or more licensed operators
[02:37:58.630 --> 02:38:00.150]  who have different businesses.
[02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:03.390]  So it can't be all owned by the same corporation
[02:38:03.390 --> 02:38:05.390]  but it's three or more licensees.
[02:38:05.390 --> 02:38:10.150]  And then they have to propose a specific geographical area
[02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:12.190]  and then a name for the Appalachian.
[02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:14.950]  There has to be a historical tie to that name
[02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:16.430]  and that place.
[02:38:16.430 --> 02:38:18.310]  And then they also have to,
[02:38:18.310 --> 02:38:21.870]  there's a new proposal that's currently pending
[02:38:21.870 --> 02:38:23.350]  with the California legislature
[02:38:23.350 --> 02:38:28.350]  which says the Appalachian of origin can only be approved
[02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:33.110]  if it requires planting in the ground and flowering areas
[02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:37.070]  and excludes the practices of using artificial lighting
[02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:40.070]  and structures in flowering areas.
[02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:42.990]  So basically they want outdoor in the ground
[02:38:42.990 --> 02:38:45.590]  because they want the cannabis, the product
[02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:48.110]  to be an expression of the place
[02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:51.030]  so that even if it's grown exact same way
[02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:53.350]  with the exact same genetics,
[02:38:53.350 --> 02:38:54.550]  somewhere else on earth,
[02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:56.030]  it's not gonna turn out the same
[02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:58.670]  because there's all these environmental factors.
[02:38:58.670 --> 02:39:01.990]  And if you basically screen off the cannabis
[02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:03.710]  from the environment,
[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:07.110]  then there's no more expression of environment.
[02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:11.070]  And so the idea of terroir is that the product itself
[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:14.870]  is an expression of all the particular characteristics,
[02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:18.350]  the wind, the light, the mineral content,
[02:39:18.350 --> 02:39:21.310]  the soil, the microbiome.
[02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:26.390]  And so that's part of the petition
[02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:27.950]  to establish a new Appalachian
[02:39:27.950 --> 02:39:31.870]  which currently is supposed to cost $20,000.
[02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:35.310]  And so you have to explain how the product
[02:39:35.310 --> 02:39:37.230]  is an expression of the place.
[02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:39.990]  And there's gotta be a causal link
[02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:44.990]  between the various factors within that geographical area
[02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:49.030]  and the products that are grown there.
[02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:54.030]  And you also have to show that there's a cultivar,
[02:39:54.470 --> 02:39:59.470]  a practice or a standard in addition to a geographical area.
[02:39:59.590 --> 02:40:01.230]  That's the main of it.
[02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:05.950]  Main part of like the proposed regulations for Appalachians
[02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:08.790]  they're not requiring like minimum,
[02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:10.830]  you gotta have half a million dollars in the bank
[02:40:10.830 --> 02:40:13.870]  in order to propose an Appalachian.
[02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:16.550]  You basically have to pay the $20,000 Appalachian fee
[02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:18.270]  which I think is way too high.
[02:40:18.270 --> 02:40:21.870]  And many of us spoke asking for that to be lowered
[02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:25.590]  and instead to have other ways to fund the program
[02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:30.630]  in the future that lowers the initial barriers to entry.
[02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:36.550]  So Omar on a bigger picture level, Cascadian Grown
[02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:39.150]  asked, does Omar know anything about the feasibility
[02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:42.710]  of forming a cannabis union or something similar
[02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:44.830]  that would allow greater communication
[02:40:44.830 --> 02:40:47.510]  and pooling of resources to further the community
[02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:51.790]  which is kind of what Bam you were talking about yesterday.
[02:40:51.790 --> 02:40:54.870]  Yeah, I mean, right now we have at the county level
[02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:57.910]  all these growers alliances, like for example
[02:40:57.910 --> 02:41:00.150]  Trinity County Cultivation Alliance
[02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:01.830]  and Humboldt County Growers Alliance
[02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:03.870]  and the Minnesota Cannabis Association
[02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:06.390]  and Sonoma County Growers Alliance
[02:41:06.390 --> 02:41:08.430]  and numerous groups throughout the state.
[02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:12.230]  There's many sometimes competing groups
[02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:15.310]  in the same jurisdiction, but there's already groups
[02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:17.430]  that exist at the local level.
[02:41:17.430 --> 02:41:20.070]  And the reason they're so localized
[02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:23.630]  is because the politics is local.
[02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:26.230]  There's that saying all politics is local
[02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:29.350]  and that's why it's atomized right now.
[02:41:29.390 --> 02:41:31.270]  We do have some trade associations
[02:41:31.270 --> 02:41:34.390]  like California Cannabis Industry Association.
[02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:37.470]  I think I'm a member, but I can't really tell you
[02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:39.830]  what their policy initiatives are.
[02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:42.390]  There's also California Normal that's fighting
[02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:44.910]  against all the criminalization that is happening
[02:41:44.910 --> 02:41:47.870]  with trying to impose like per plant
[02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:52.630]  or $10,000 per day fines at the state level.
[02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:56.350]  So people are starting to organize,
[02:41:56.390 --> 02:41:59.750]  but there could be better organization.
[02:41:59.750 --> 02:42:02.350]  And as far as the small growers,
[02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:07.350]  we do have like what international cannabis farmers,
[02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:08.550]  ICFA, what's that?
[02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:09.390]  What's that one?
[02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.910]  Well, there's-
[02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:14.270]  International Cannabis Farmers Association,
[02:42:14.270 --> 02:42:15.870]  Kristen Rivadol.
[02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:16.710]  That's right.
[02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:20.150]  So there's like a lot of groups that are pretty iry
[02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:22.630]  that are all thinking about these projects,
[02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:27.830]  but I don't think right now there's like a savior group
[02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:30.270]  or a savior person.
[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:34.870]  And ultimately we are the ones we've been waiting for.
[02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:35.710]  Can I say this?
[02:42:35.710 --> 02:42:38.310]  You know, part of the problem is that we've been miserable
[02:42:38.310 --> 02:42:41.030]  about raising money to actually be proactive
[02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.990]  in changing the laws.
[02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:43.750]  And it breaks my heart in a way,
[02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:46.070]  or it should be outrageous to see these companies
[02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:48.910]  pissing through hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:50.870]  to start up cannabis companies,
[02:42:51.470 --> 02:42:53.870]  but they would never give a damn dollar
[02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:56.750]  to help us push what would have been good law
[02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:59.150]  at any point, at any time.
[02:42:59.150 --> 02:43:01.870]  They've only jumped on board when it became safe.
[02:43:01.870 --> 02:43:03.270]  And now the John Boehners,
[02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:06.310]  the guys that used to stand there crying and locking us up
[02:43:06.310 --> 02:43:08.990]  and sending away on 10 year mandatory minimums
[02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:11.510]  is now investing heavily in the cannabis.
[02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:13.550]  And I think it's really messed up.
[02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:16.910]  And I mean, you know, there has to be some type of way
[02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:19.910]  that we can kind of fight back or, you know,
[02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:21.030]  organize, I guess.
[02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:22.310]  I mean, Tim Leary used to say,
[02:43:22.310 --> 02:43:23.830]  turn on, tune in and drop out.
[02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:25.750]  But I always thought it should be turn on,
[02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:27.590]  tune in and take over.
[02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:29.790]  You know, it's just, that's what you're really preaching,
[02:43:29.790 --> 02:43:30.630]  Omar.
[02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:32.150]  It's just, how do we take over?
[02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:34.390]  And, you know, the taxation issue is huge.
[02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:36.470]  I mean, what everybody's really asking for
[02:43:36.470 --> 02:43:39.150]  is the ability to get into the business,
[02:43:39.150 --> 02:43:41.710]  just, you know, like you get into any business,
[02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:43.470]  as long as you're not breaking other laws,
[02:43:43.470 --> 02:43:45.910]  be it environmental or what have you,
[02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:48.390]  then you should be allowed to get into the business of,
[02:43:48.390 --> 02:43:50.590]  and you should have direct to consumer
[02:43:50.590 --> 02:43:52.670]  and you should pay income on your taxes,
[02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:55.830]  but there shouldn't be all these sin taxes that make it,
[02:43:55.830 --> 02:44:00.510]  you know, and, you know, there is no real answer to this
[02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:01.790]  that you can just point to and say,
[02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:03.390]  hey, this is gonna fix everything.
[02:44:03.390 --> 02:44:05.030]  But, you know, in a lot of ways,
[02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:08.510]  I'm really glad Sean Parker threw the money down and did.
[02:44:11.700 --> 02:44:13.500]  What we lost Todd.
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:18.620]  Go ahead, Jackson.
[02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:20.660]  I was just gonna say that with,
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:22.100]  as far as the big money, you know,
[02:44:22.100 --> 02:44:23.820]  guys who have the hundreds of millions.
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:25.620]  We need so much more.
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:26.940]  All right.
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:27.780]  Go ahead.
[02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:30.260]  I was just saying, you cut out for a second.
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:32.700]  So I just was, I was just jumping in.
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:33.860]  I was just saying with the guys
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:36.060]  who got the hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:39.420]  you know, it seems like there's probably,
[02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:40.260]  I don't think that it's true.
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:44.020]  And just to be clear, you were not one of those guys.
[02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:45.940]  Me?
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:47.060]  No.
[02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:47.900]  I can't tell you.
[02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:49.140]  Yes, you.
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:52.540]  I can't speak on my hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:54.580]  That's the advice.
[02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:57.820]  And you are blowing through it right now.
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:01.100]  My trustafarian roots won't allow me
[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:03.340]  to discuss matters in this format,
[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:07.300]  but DM me, you know, and I know this guy in Nigeria
[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:09.540]  and he's got this money that's locked up
[02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:11.220]  and, you know, we can get it out.
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.740]  I just need your, I'll give you my PayPal.
[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:16.540]  I just need a couple of passwords and we'll go.
[02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:20.060]  But in the meantime, I think that the people
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:23.020]  who have the hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:45:23.020 --> 02:45:26.540]  I think that for them, they're gonna see,
[02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:29.020]  I mean, in any business, you know,
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:31.420]  if there's a way to get rid of your competition,
[02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:34.020]  it's gonna be viewed as an advantage.
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:37.820]  And I think that if you have hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:39.780]  you would really like to see the laws
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:40.820]  written the way they are,
[02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:44.420]  because what happens is you can continue to function
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:47.900]  and add a loss for a long time until everyone else fails.
[02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:51.540]  And then you go ahead and pull out the real money
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:55.260]  and change the laws so then you can make the money tax-free.
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:45:57.500]  But if you can go ahead and have five or 10 years
[02:45:57.500 --> 02:45:58.620]  when you can operate,
[02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:01.580]  just going ahead and tossing it in, tossing it in,
[02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:04.380]  that's what I was talking about as economic assassination.
[02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:06.540]  You know, that's how they're basically able
[02:46:06.540 --> 02:46:11.340]  to kill all the competition and lock it down
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:13.220]  and then, you know, take over.
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:16.940]  And that happens in, you know, in small ways
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.500]  when people are just, you know, selling drugs on drug blocks
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:24.940]  and it happens with nations who are trying to take the,
[02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:26.100]  take over the economies
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:29.380]  and economically colonize other nations.
[02:46:29.380 --> 02:46:32.220]  But I think that unfortunately,
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:34.540]  those people with the biggest coffers,
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:37.700]  they're gonna be going ahead and, you know,
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:41.340]  trying to promote the things the way that they are,
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:43.140]  because they can kind of kill everybody off
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:44.740]  in the meantime, you know?
[02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:46.860]  You know, a great example of that is med men
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:48.860]  fighting against home growing in states
[02:46:48.860 --> 02:46:50.580]  like New York and Florida.
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:52.780]  And Massachusetts, I think, right?
[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:53.620]  Yeah.
[02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:55.140]  And I mean, New York, yeah.
[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:56.020]  It's horrible.
[02:46:56.020 --> 02:46:57.420]  I mean, and this is, you know,
[02:46:57.420 --> 02:46:59.300]  one of the reasons I supported 64
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:01.940]  is because it allowed the six plant adult home grow.
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:05.500]  And as a medical patient, you legalize my activities.
[02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:08.380]  Then if you bust me criminally, I can fight over that,
[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:10.340]  you know, but I'm not a commercial grower.
[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:13.900]  I grow as a hobbyist and I, you know,
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:15.820]  they're not gonna bust a guy in a basement
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:18.180]  as much as they're gonna bust people with,
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:20.780]  you know, visible cannabis growing, you know,
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:24.980]  and that's the biggest difference I think than it all is.
[02:47:24.980 --> 02:47:26.900]  But these bigger companies that are lobbying
[02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:29.300]  against really fundamental human rights,
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:31.380]  the fundamental human right to grow a plant
[02:47:31.380 --> 02:47:33.140]  should be something that's not overlooked
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:35.900]  in this conversation at all, you know?
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:39.420]  Because unfortunately, prior to us passing 64,
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:42.380]  us as even patients, we're still felons
[02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:45.540]  for growing a flower that was medically beneficial to us.
[02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:48.020]  Only now is it actually lawfully legal
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:50.380]  for me to possess the plants behind me.
[02:47:50.380 --> 02:47:52.580]  And that's a big change.
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:55.140]  And, you know, everything else sucks,
[02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:56.740]  but if you're just a simple home grower
[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:58.700]  making your own medicine, it's great
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:00.820]  because now I don't fear prosecution.
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:02.300]  Well, that was bullshit
[02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:03.740]  because they prosecuted me from, you know,
[02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:06.220]  2013 until 64 passed.
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:07.740]  And then the only reason they dropped it
[02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:09.380]  was because they didn't want to pursue
[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:12.220]  misdemeanor cultivation charges
[02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:13.540]  because they had to go back
[02:48:13.540 --> 02:48:16.260]  and everything went from felony to misdemeanor.
[02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:19.740]  And when Prop 64 passed, a lot of people I met in prison
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:21.580]  got their sentences recomputed
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:24.820]  because they had prior felony, you know, for cannabis
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:26.700]  that now were now misdemeanors.
[02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:29.220]  And suddenly those felonies, once recomputed,
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:31.380]  meant they were getting their sentences shortened
[02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:34.660]  and they got out of prison literally earlier by a lot
[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:39.660]  because now the things that were stacking up their time
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:42.180]  were no longer felonies anymore.
[02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:43.420]  And that's pretty huge.
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:47.460]  And I think we're a long way off until, you know,
[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:51.140]  we have actually, you know, our rights back on any level,
[02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:54.500]  but there has to be so many different angles
[02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:55.900]  of this fought right now.
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:58.500]  Federal, obviously, gun rights would be nice.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:00.380]  I mean, why shouldn't we be allowed to have them
[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:02.820]  if the winemaker down the street can have them?
[02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:04.740]  That should be something we're all arguing
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:07.100]  because that's hugely part of America.
[02:49:07.100 --> 02:49:10.220]  And I don't see the NRA standing up to defend us.
[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:12.020]  I mean, they're a little screwed right now, but-
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:17.020]  No guns, but your physical address is publicly searchable.
[02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:21.140]  Right, they doxed us all and that's cool, right?
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:22.300]  And I mean, to me,
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:24.420]  there's so many fundamental problems in this,
[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:28.140]  but, you know, how can we become, you know,
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:29.820]  powerful enough within the system
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.220]  so that we can change the system
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:32.620]  has been the fundamental question
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:34.260]  that I've been sitting here getting stoned
[02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:36.540]  and asking myself ever since I met Jack Kerrer.
[02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:38.820]  And he sat there basically convincing me
[02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:41.060]  that we could change the world, you know?
[02:49:41.060 --> 02:49:43.060]  And I hope that we all have that same vibe
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:45.220]  because we've come a long way, but we can't give up.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:46.540]  Clearly we can't give up.
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:51.860]  I think the mistake made by companies
[02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:53.900]  that had a lot of money was assuming
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:56.340]  that they were the only company that had a lot of money
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:59.540]  because I think, Jackson, you were talking about that,
[02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:02.700]  but I think the strategy each of those companies had
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:05.380]  assumed that there weren't a hundred other companies
[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:07.940]  also with a hundred million dollars
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:10.340]  who were gonna pay slotting fees
[02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:15.340]  and, you know, forego profit now for future,
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:19.420]  like for market share and future profit.
[02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:21.500]  And so they fucked it for themselves.
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:23.740]  And then like all the small mom and pops,
[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:26.180]  they basically fucked it for everyone.
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:30.420]  So like, it wasn't one company that was brilliant
[02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:32.460]  to be like, we'll just get really big
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:34.220]  and dominate market share.
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:36.940]  It was like a hundred of them.
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:38.700]  Yeah, well, as soon as they find out, they're like,
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:40.500]  oh, this is gonna be a hundred billion dollars
[02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:41.900]  in a couple of years, you know?
[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:45.220]  And, you know, then they might've, you know,
[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:46.940]  it looked like this great thing.
[02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:49.540]  And then I'm sure that, like you said,
[02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:50.820]  at this point they're probably like,
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:53.620]  oh, geez, there's everybody had the same idea.
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:58.340]  And it's a simple concept, you know?
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:02.580]  Like I remember at one point diesel was cheap
[02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:04.940]  and everybody bought diesel trucks
[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:06.340]  and then the price of diesel went up
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:07.940]  and everybody had a fucking diesel truck
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:10.340]  and it costs more than gasoline for a while.
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:12.740]  It was like, ah, this wasn't a good play, you know?
[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:15.860]  But, you know, it's the same thing, it happens.
[02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:18.820]  I remember I went to Reggae on the River when I was a kid
[02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:21.100]  and I had an extra ticket and it was like,
[02:51:21.100 --> 02:51:23.380]  tickets were $50 and you could sell a ticket
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:26.500]  for like $300 because there was no tickets.
[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:28.100]  And the next year I went
[02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:31.260]  and everybody had bought like 10 extra tickets, you know?
[02:51:31.260 --> 02:51:32.540]  And you couldn't get rid of them.
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:34.740]  And all these people lost like $500
[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:35.940]  with a pocket full of tickets
[02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:38.380]  and wound up having to hand them out, you know?
[02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:39.580]  And I remember my buddy,
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:44.300]  I remember my buddy trading his extra ticket
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:46.940]  he had brought to scalp to have some extra lot money
[02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:50.140]  and sold it for a stack of stickers
[02:51:50.140 --> 02:51:51.340]  that were a steal your face
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:52.700]  with a cookie monster in the middle
[02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:54.420]  that said steal your cookies.
[02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:56.500]  And it was hilarious because we were like,
[02:51:56.500 --> 02:51:57.860]  yeah, this is gonna be a big come up
[02:51:57.860 --> 02:52:00.660]  to have these spare tickets, but it's not, you know?
[02:52:00.660 --> 02:52:03.260]  And that's when everyone has the same idea at once
[02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:04.700]  it doesn't necessarily work.
[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:07.620]  That's not how supply and demand really functions.
[02:52:07.620 --> 02:52:09.340]  And it's not so much in this case
[02:52:09.340 --> 02:52:11.140]  a question of supply and demand,
[02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:15.820]  but it is in a sense, but not just on the actual product,
[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:17.500]  but on market space, you know?
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:19.300]  So it's funny, man.
[02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:22.740]  All right, so Jackson, you're in chart
[02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:26.500]  for the 250 people still watching at midnight.
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.500]  You guys, oh, geez.
[02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:30.220]  Yeah, go to bed.
[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:33.300]  But that's actually, I want to just,
[02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:36.860]  can people like type in where they're watching from?
[02:52:36.860 --> 02:52:39.540]  Cause we're on the West Coast time zone
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:40.620]  and it's already midnight.
[02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:42.900]  So I'm like, are you people in Boston?
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:44.620]  Are you in South Africa?
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:49.620]  You want to talk about that?
[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:54.620]  I can, yeah, I mean, I just,
[02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:57.980]  So give us our learning moment for the day.
[02:52:57.980 --> 02:53:00.540]  All right, one little, one little teachable thing here.
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:04.340]  So over the years, you know, we started,
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:05.820]  I think I kind of break it down all in this,
[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:08.620]  but you know, usually like when we started growing
[02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:10.500]  everything was kind of in small pots
[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:11.660]  and you kind of had to like,
[02:53:11.660 --> 02:53:12.700]  you know, you had to like,
[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:14.340]  everything was kind of in small pots
[02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.100]  and you kind of taught like, keep them wet.
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:17.140]  You can't over water.
[02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:18.660]  That's why you use good dirt.
[02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:21.060]  If you have bad dirt, it's too dense.
[02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:22.100]  Maybe you got to watch out,
[02:53:22.100 --> 02:53:23.700]  but you just use good dirt to start.
[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:25.900]  It drains well and keep it soaking wet.
[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:28.740]  And I remember guys over the years
[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:30.820]  who would just take a dripper and stick it in there
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:33.180]  and it would come from gravity feed from their spring.
[02:53:33.180 --> 02:53:35.340]  And they would literally just have water going all the time,
[02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:38.780]  just put a pile of some food on top and let it drip through.
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:41.020]  And, and everything was always fine.
[02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:43.940]  And then we started to grow,
[02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:45.900]  you're allowed to grow six plants
[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:47.780]  and then you're allowed to grow 25 plants
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:49.180]  and people try to stick to it.
[02:53:49.180 --> 02:53:52.020]  And you figure, oh, wow, okay.
[02:53:52.020 --> 02:53:54.540]  I put them in a, now I tried putting them in a,
[02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:57.340]  I put them in a, you know, a 65 gallon pot.
[02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:58.340]  And then they outgrew that.
[02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:00.700]  So you try a hundred, you try 200, you go 300.
[02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:02.860]  Some people use 600 gallon pots now, you know,
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:06.340]  they make fabric pots, grassroots fabric pots
[02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:09.700]  that are killer, killer fabric pot company
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:13.020]  by not sponsored by them, but they're, you know,
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:14.860]  I recommend their pots are cool,
[02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:18.700]  but you get these huge pots or you grow in the ground
[02:54:18.700 --> 02:54:21.780]  or whatever it is, but you get this huge volume of dirt.
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:26.780]  And once they get really, once you get really deep soil
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:29.180]  and it's far from the outside, you know,
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:32.980]  like when we used to do a little bit of mushroom growing,
[02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:33.820]  they would tell us, you know,
[02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:36.700]  don't make your container bigger than about 12 inches across
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:37.700]  and 12 inches deep,
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:40.060]  because when you get further than that,
[02:54:40.060 --> 02:54:41.540]  this is the inside you tend to,
[02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:46.020]  your meat, your substrate tends to get anaerobic, you know,
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:47.620]  and you lose the oxygen in there
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:49.580]  and you start to get different decay and stuff,
[02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:53.100]  which, you know, is similar if you have soil
[02:54:53.100 --> 02:54:54.020]  that's really wet.
[02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:57.620]  And so we started to notice there was this thing
[02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:59.220]  that would happen where we'd look at the plants
[02:54:59.220 --> 02:55:02.180]  and we'd be like, damn, it seems like the beds
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:04.620]  of the plants are so big and it's so hot out.
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:07.140]  Like the plants aren't getting water at the bottom anymore
[02:55:07.580 --> 02:55:08.420]  and the food's not reaching there
[02:55:08.420 --> 02:55:09.700]  because we're getting the deficiencies
[02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:12.740]  at the top of the plant and the top there's food
[02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:13.860]  and there's a lot and it's wet,
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:15.340]  but what's it like down below?
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:17.940]  And, you know, sometimes somebody would like pop off a board
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:20.740]  off their beds or dig down in their pot
[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:23.220]  to see what was going on and all this different stuff.
[02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:28.220]  And then I had a thing maybe four, five years ago
[02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:31.660]  or something when pretty much no one had heard
[02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:34.620]  about root aphids and then I had root aphids in my pots
[02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:37.940]  and it was, and then I noticed, you know, my pots,
[02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:40.940]  I had 65 gallon pots and I had 300 gallon pots
[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:43.060]  and the 300 gallon pots all had root aphids
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:43.940]  all over the place.
[02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:45.900]  And the plant started to look a little weird
[02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:48.060]  and the top of the plant kind of starts to yellow.
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:49.820]  The leaves curl down a little bit.
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:52.220]  When they flower, that flower develops a little slower.
[02:55:52.220 --> 02:55:53.500]  It usually winds up really killer
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:55.180]  because it's technically it's underfed.
[02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:56.340]  It's not getting the nutrients.
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:59.500]  And a lot of times that's good, tasty weed,
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.420]  like in Jamaica, what they call ital weed
[02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:03.220]  when you plant it and you don't feed it.
[02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:06.980]  And so we were kind of like, well, what,
[02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:08.060]  so what's the deal here?
[02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:11.060]  Is it underwatered, overwatered, underfed, overfed?
[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:13.300]  Is it accumulating salt at the bottom?
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:14.420]  What the hell's going on?
[02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:16.900]  You know, and I would see it at different people's places.
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:19.700]  And a lot of the time it would be like one plant.
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:21.500]  So you'd be like, I don't know, you know, whatever.
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:22.500]  And we'll figure it out.
[02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:23.660]  But everything else is killing it.
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:26.660]  So you don't want to change your program that much.
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:27.940]  And the plants are still huge.
[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:28.860]  It's just this little tip.
[02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:31.020]  You're like, this should be the biggest buds,
[02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:32.820]  but they're not, they're a little bit more lean
[02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:35.180]  and they're not really what they should be.
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:39.540]  So at a certain point,
[02:56:42.020 --> 02:56:44.700]  because I had the 65s going and I had the 300s going,
[02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:47.260]  I actually hit up Bamboo,
[02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:51.620]  because Bamboo, you know, he's a smart dude.
[02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:53.180]  He's experienced with a lot of stuff
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:54.860]  and he's well-educated.
[02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:57.860]  He has a better education than me
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:00.460]  and a lot of experience to go along with it.
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:04.700]  He goes to Davis and does classes on breeding
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:06.860]  and talks to a lot of people
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:11.500]  and sells beneficials and all this kind of stuff.
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:13.180]  So I hit him up and I go,
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:14.300]  what's the deal with these things?
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:16.060]  And he goes, well, you want to do nematodes.
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:18.700]  And then he goes, you know, it's usually a sign
[02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:20.980]  if they're out of control that you're overwatering.
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:24.100]  And before this, I had already kind of known a little bit
[02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:26.180]  about the overwatering causing the yellowing,
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:28.300]  but you get the root aphids and it's exasperated.
[02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:31.980]  It's just much, much higher levels of the same symptoms
[02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:33.700]  when you get root aphids.
[02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:34.540]  And then I thought,
[02:57:34.540 --> 02:57:37.140]  oh, it's the root aphids causing these symptoms.
[02:57:37.140 --> 02:57:40.580]  So I noticed that my 65s that dried out on a regular basis,
[02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:42.060]  I couldn't find any root aphids in them,
[02:57:42.060 --> 02:57:44.540]  but the root aphids came in bags
[02:57:44.540 --> 02:57:47.500]  of this particular soil that I bought.
[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:52.460]  And I had used that soil for five and a half inch pots.
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:56.140]  And so all my starts had come from the same infected soil.
[02:57:56.140 --> 02:57:59.020]  So I was having a hard time going, okay,
[02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:01.500]  the 65s they don't exist in,
[02:58:01.500 --> 02:58:04.260]  and the 300s, they're just rampant.
[02:58:04.260 --> 02:58:06.220]  So what's the difference here?
[02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:08.740]  And luckily I had that little bit of control to look at.
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:12.500]  So I realized that, you know,
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:13.860]  because Bamboo was the one who mentioned,
[02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:15.580]  he goes, you know, it's usually overwatering
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:16.860]  if they're really out of control.
[02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:18.140]  And I was like, okay.
[02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:21.660]  So I try all this stuff,
[02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:23.460]  but then I just realized that then I see
[02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:24.860]  that it's definitely the watering thing.
[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:26.540]  So I back off on the water.
[02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:28.980]  Well, the root aphids basically disappear
[02:58:28.980 --> 02:58:31.020]  and these symptoms disappear.
[02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:35.380]  And so I'm throwing this in there
[02:58:35.380 --> 02:58:37.660]  because this is a little bit of bonus information
[02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:40.260]  because people don't really know this about root aphids.
[02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:42.020]  Root aphids don't really hang around
[02:58:42.020 --> 02:58:43.580]  in soil that drains well.
[02:58:43.580 --> 02:58:45.260]  Like that's how it works in vineyards
[02:58:45.260 --> 02:58:48.020]  and things where they can be a huge problem.
[02:58:48.020 --> 02:58:49.420]  If the soil is different,
[02:58:49.420 --> 02:58:51.300]  then they just kind of peter out
[02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:53.780]  and they don't keep a population.
[02:58:54.140 --> 02:58:58.060]  And they eventually eradicate themselves.
[02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:01.300]  So anyway, the post was basically just saying,
[02:59:01.300 --> 02:59:03.260]  hey, you can buy this $40 water meter.
[02:59:03.260 --> 02:59:05.020]  You stick it down to the bottom of your pot
[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:06.660]  and you can tell if that's the reason
[02:59:06.660 --> 02:59:08.980]  because you could be getting the same symptom
[02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:12.180]  from it being too dry as well at the bottom of your pots.
[02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:15.100]  And people who really have their shit together
[02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:16.940]  a lot of times will elevate their pots
[02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:20.300]  and put them up on like some big rock, like some gravel,
[02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:22.140]  so they can drain extra well.
[02:59:22.140 --> 02:59:24.020]  And that will help with that size pot
[02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:27.660]  so that instead of it being up against something
[02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:29.820]  that's wet all the time, there's air underneath them.
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:32.140]  And the kind of thing about fabric pots
[02:59:32.140 --> 02:59:33.220]  is they cause air pruning.
[02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:36.340]  So your roots hit the side and then they branch extra.
[02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:39.100]  And if you have a regular pot made out of plastic
[02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:41.380]  and you go to like in a seven gallon or something,
[02:59:41.380 --> 02:59:42.500]  you go to pick it up,
[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:44.780]  you'll notice there's not a lot of roots around the stock.
[02:59:44.780 --> 02:59:47.100]  The roots have circled around the outside,
[02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:51.060]  but in a fabric pot or an air pot or a root builder pot,
[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:54.940]  what happens is they reach the outside and then they branch.
[02:59:54.940 --> 02:59:59.340]  And so by actually putting them up on some rock,
[02:59:59.340 --> 03:00:01.100]  then you gain that same benefit
[03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:02.700]  at the very bottom a little bit more
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:04.180]  because they root prune.
[03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:05.940]  What happens is they hit the air
[03:00:05.940 --> 03:00:09.660]  and it sends them a signal that don't go any further,
[03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:11.740]  branch out and they bush off the same way
[03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:12.900]  as if you're at the top of plant
[03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:14.540]  for people who are familiar with what happens
[03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:16.180]  when you top your plants.
[03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:20.540]  So anyway, the post was just telling people like,
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.700]  hey, if it looks like this, get a water meter,
[03:00:23.700 --> 03:00:26.340]  a moisture meter, because it's likely you're over watering.
[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:31.300]  And then sometimes you discover like you'll have plants
[03:00:31.300 --> 03:00:34.340]  and you'll notice like one leaf will droop
[03:00:34.340 --> 03:00:36.620]  and then another leaf will droop.
[03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:38.260]  And you'll be like, the whole plant looks beautiful,
[03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:40.580]  but there's like five leaves that are drooping.
[03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:42.580]  And it'll come and go
[03:00:42.580 --> 03:00:44.780]  and you can't figure out what's going on.
[03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:47.460]  And a lot of times what'll happen is you have,
[03:00:47.460 --> 03:00:51.220]  in the roots you have dry spots that are in there
[03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:53.500]  and you can't tell you take the moisture meter
[03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:54.820]  and you probe it around and you go,
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:00:57.100]  okay, I'm giving it enough water,
[03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:59.220]  but right over here in this little area,
[03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:00.580]  it's not getting enough water.
[03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:05.580]  So you need to kind of make a little recessed area
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:08.620]  and let the water go there extra to even it out.
[03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:10.220]  Then you'll notice it goes away.
[03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:12.900]  So anyway, just watering,
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:15.060]  it's funny because you can be super experienced
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:16.100]  working in one way,
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:18.980]  but then you go to try and grow these monster plants
[03:01:18.980 --> 03:01:23.140]  or you hook up drip and you're used to hand watering
[03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:25.540]  or you change emitters or you don't realize it,
[03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:28.820]  but where your emitter goes in the line, there's a leak.
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:31.900]  So you're getting triple the water and you don't know it
[03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:34.260]  because you haven't been inspecting it all the time
[03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:36.980]  because you just figure your stuff works.
[03:01:36.980 --> 03:01:40.020]  So it was just a heads up to people
[03:01:40.020 --> 03:01:44.540]  that watering winds up being really,
[03:01:44.540 --> 03:01:47.820]  although it seems like the simplest part
[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:50.100]  of growing something, give it water.
[03:01:50.100 --> 03:01:52.140]  The water levels are huge
[03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:56.140]  and people who monitor it really scientifically,
[03:01:56.140 --> 03:01:58.380]  they let it swing.
[03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:00.220]  They go, okay, we take the moisture up to 80,
[03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:02.380]  we let it drop to 20.
[03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:03.740]  In veg, you do it different.
[03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:05.300]  And in bloom, you do it different.
[03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:07.540]  And I'm not somebody who does everything monitored
[03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:09.060]  really carefully like that,
[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:11.700]  but I do like to monitor it well enough
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:14.860]  that I'm not taking a big hit.
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:18.340]  I don't grow under Govetas with least space.
[03:02:18.340 --> 03:02:19.820]  So it doesn't really matter to me
[03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:22.660]  if my plant gets this slightly different yield,
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:25.060]  but what I can't have is just a failure
[03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:30.900]  where the plant is just all messed up.
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:34.340]  So that's what the post was.
[03:02:36.740 --> 03:02:38.300]  That's a good summary.
[03:02:38.300 --> 03:02:43.300]  So this is, you had posted something about tobacco, right?
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:46.660]  Yeah.
[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:50.580]  And so actually I think Steve Raisner dropped off,
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:53.700]  but these are from seeds he gave me.
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:03:01.780]  And so I have like this little one and like this one.
[03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:09.870]  And I love, so what I love about these things
[03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:13.150]  is at night they get totally erect
[03:03:13.150 --> 03:03:16.790]  and they just like all the leaves shoot straight up.
[03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:18.550]  And then in the daytime,
[03:03:18.550 --> 03:03:23.430]  they all just droop and get super lazy like lounging,
[03:03:24.990 --> 03:03:26.830]  which is kind of interesting.
[03:03:30.110 --> 03:03:33.910]  Yeah, I've noticed what's trippy is that
[03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:38.670]  I have mine in an area where they're shaded
[03:03:38.670 --> 03:03:40.190]  for part of the day.
[03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:44.150]  And then it's like they adjust
[03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:49.150]  their level of water uptake and transpiration.
[03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:53.790]  So it's like you put them in the,
[03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:57.350]  I have them in the shade and then they're like really happy.
[03:03:57.350 --> 03:04:00.950]  And then the sun hits them and then they start to wilt.
[03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:02.790]  But then if I put them out where they get the sun
[03:04:02.790 --> 03:04:04.910]  really early in the morning,
[03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:07.190]  then it's like they can stay more level
[03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:09.390]  and they know it's like they're ready for it.
[03:04:09.390 --> 03:04:14.070]  And so then they just look normal all of the time.
[03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:16.270]  And that was something that I didn't really realize.
[03:04:16.270 --> 03:04:18.070]  And it happened kind of with all the different plants
[03:04:18.070 --> 03:04:19.870]  that I had that were in the shade.
[03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:22.270]  And then the sun hit them when it was already intense,
[03:04:22.270 --> 03:04:24.630]  which was kind of like pulling up,
[03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:27.670]  almost like pulling a plant out of a greenhouse.
[03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:28.590]  When it's hot out,
[03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:31.230]  they wanna freak out a little bit and stuff.
[03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:36.830]  Can I add to the overwatering thing?
[03:04:36.830 --> 03:04:40.070]  So yeah, really good point to make.
[03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:42.990]  Overwatering is probably the most common mistake
[03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:46.110]  made by growers from expert to beginner.
[03:04:47.270 --> 03:04:48.470]  It's just really easy to do.
[03:04:48.470 --> 03:04:50.710]  And for outdoor growers,
[03:04:50.710 --> 03:04:53.190]  when I have like new people on a farm that I'm running
[03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:56.870]  and I'm trying to take people with very little experience
[03:04:56.870 --> 03:05:00.270]  and try to cram all my experience into them,
[03:05:00.270 --> 03:05:03.350]  it's really, you just take everything, you simplify it.
[03:05:03.350 --> 03:05:05.750]  In the springtime, it's colder out,
[03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:07.870]  your plants have smaller root systems,
[03:05:07.870 --> 03:05:09.470]  they need a lot less water.
[03:05:10.390 --> 03:05:12.590]  As they grow, they need more.
[03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:14.670]  But the biggest indicator that I always tell people,
[03:05:14.670 --> 03:05:17.350]  because what Jackson's talking about where you see that,
[03:05:17.350 --> 03:05:20.310]  I've seen gardens where people have 10 pound plants
[03:05:20.310 --> 03:05:23.390]  and it's just one half of the plant or one little branch.
[03:05:23.390 --> 03:05:26.150]  And if they don't catch it early and start treating it
[03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:28.630]  with the right type of like a nematode
[03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:33.630]  or other like inoculants, you can lose those plants.
[03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:34.670]  And you see it pretty commonly.
[03:05:34.670 --> 03:05:36.150]  So the indicator that I always tell people
[03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:37.430]  when I'm teaching them is,
[03:05:37.430 --> 03:05:39.190]  under watering and over watering
[03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:41.390]  both have the same signs in the leaves.
[03:05:41.390 --> 03:05:43.310]  If your leaves are droops, right?
[03:05:43.310 --> 03:05:44.470]  And so the only difference,
[03:05:44.470 --> 03:05:46.830]  it's really common sense and really basic is,
[03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:49.270]  if your leaves are over watered
[03:05:49.270 --> 03:05:51.150]  and you feel right there in the leaf stem,
[03:05:51.150 --> 03:05:53.390]  you're gonna feel that it's rigid
[03:05:53.390 --> 03:05:55.070]  and that it's filled with water inside.
[03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:56.350]  It's nice and stiff.
[03:05:56.350 --> 03:05:58.070]  And if your plants are under watered,
[03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:59.470]  your leaves are still drooping
[03:05:59.470 --> 03:06:01.110]  and this is gonna be all fucking weak
[03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:02.830]  because there's no fucking water in there
[03:06:02.830 --> 03:06:04.630]  and you can feel it pretty easily.
[03:06:05.470 --> 03:06:06.310]  So that's kind of like a beginner's tip
[03:06:06.310 --> 03:06:09.190]  to seeing if you've over watered or under watered.
[03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:10.510]  They have the same look,
[03:06:10.510 --> 03:06:11.750]  but it's just as simple as seeing
[03:06:11.750 --> 03:06:14.310]  if there's moisture inside the stem.
[03:06:14.310 --> 03:06:16.470]  And another thing that I think helps guide people
[03:06:16.470 --> 03:06:19.510]  in learning how not to over water
[03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:22.870]  is if you under water and you're vigilant
[03:06:22.870 --> 03:06:25.950]  and you pay good attention to detail in your plants,
[03:06:25.950 --> 03:06:27.470]  you can just add more water.
[03:06:27.470 --> 03:06:28.710]  This is fine.
[03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:31.670]  If you over water, you have to fucking let it dry out
[03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:33.350]  before you can do anything about it.
[03:06:33.350 --> 03:06:36.430]  So it's better to under water than over water
[03:06:36.430 --> 03:06:38.510]  if you had to make one of those mistakes
[03:06:38.510 --> 03:06:40.310]  and a good grower is gonna be vigilant,
[03:06:40.310 --> 03:06:41.710]  pay a lot of attention to detail,
[03:06:41.710 --> 03:06:43.430]  catch it before it becomes a problem,
[03:06:43.430 --> 03:06:45.190]  simply add more water.
[03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:47.030]  If you continue to over water,
[03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:50.750]  it will lead to potential pest problems like the root aphids
[03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:52.950]  but everything else from viruses
[03:06:52.950 --> 03:06:55.470]  and really anything that can harm a plant
[03:06:55.470 --> 03:06:58.750]  from pH fluctuations and lack of nutrient uptake.
[03:06:58.750 --> 03:07:02.230]  So yeah, over watering, big common mistake.
[03:07:02.230 --> 03:07:05.390]  And it's just as simple as just knowing what to look for.
[03:07:10.960 --> 03:07:12.800]  Jackson or Jesse.
[03:07:17.200 --> 03:07:18.440]  What's going on with Jesse, man?
[03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:21.120]  I've been talking to a whole bunch now.
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:22.800]  Jesse or Bamboo or somebody, man.
[03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:25.360]  I wanna step on everything.
[03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:27.720]  Anybody here?
[03:07:28.760 --> 03:07:30.760]  Bam's unquiet.
[03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:31.600]  Is he still there?
[03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:33.640]  He's probably sleeping.
[03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:34.920]  Oh my God.
[03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:37.760]  There he is.
[03:07:45.090 --> 03:07:47.530]  I have to contribute something.
[03:07:47.530 --> 03:07:49.970]  I guess I take it back to like, where do we go from now?
[03:07:49.970 --> 03:07:51.090]  What can we do?
[03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:54.770]  And I think it's really important
[03:07:54.770 --> 03:07:57.490]  that we just really start documenting collectively
[03:07:58.850 --> 03:08:03.450]  all the hurdles that we face
[03:08:03.450 --> 03:08:05.970]  so that as we move forward
[03:08:05.970 --> 03:08:10.290]  and step into the era of drafting future legislation,
[03:08:10.330 --> 03:08:13.890]  even if it's 2024 or 2022,
[03:08:14.890 --> 03:08:16.290]  even if it's that far down the line,
[03:08:16.290 --> 03:08:18.010]  I wanna like go into it prepared.
[03:08:18.010 --> 03:08:20.850]  And I really like to hear,
[03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:23.930]  I think I need to start being more active
[03:08:23.930 --> 03:08:28.250]  about collecting feedback and data from people
[03:08:28.250 --> 03:08:31.370]  so that it's one thing to say that thing
[03:08:32.490 --> 03:08:36.530]  just to legalize it or make it easy.
[03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:41.530]  But in my experience dealing with like Santa Cruz County
[03:08:41.970 --> 03:08:46.970]  is a lot of power is in the undefined areas.
[03:08:49.130 --> 03:08:53.170]  They use the gray areas in ways that aren't to our advantage.
[03:08:53.170 --> 03:08:56.970]  And so I think that if we focus on identifying
[03:08:57.810 --> 03:09:02.810]  all the tools of control that are being deployed,
[03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:06.450]  we can actually come up with a 600 page
[03:09:07.370 --> 03:09:11.730]  manual or manuscript like they do for their regulations,
[03:09:11.730 --> 03:09:14.610]  but basically handcuffing their ability
[03:09:14.610 --> 03:09:17.010]  to stand in the way of the intent of the law.
[03:09:18.490 --> 03:09:23.490]  And so I think that's where we need to begin.
[03:09:24.370 --> 03:09:27.810]  And I think that my vision would be,
[03:09:27.810 --> 03:09:30.650]  yeah, maybe between now and 2022,
[03:09:30.650 --> 03:09:35.650]  we focus on local area initiatives and programs
[03:09:36.130 --> 03:09:41.130]  so that everybody can sort of address their local problems.
[03:09:41.410 --> 03:09:46.410]  But in that process, really gel at the local level
[03:09:46.970 --> 03:09:51.650]  and the grassroots level and form a build a consensus there.
[03:09:51.650 --> 03:09:53.530]  And with those smaller victories,
[03:09:53.530 --> 03:09:57.450]  then add up to like the bigger victory in 2024
[03:09:57.450 --> 03:10:01.370]  to pass a referendum statewide.
[03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:04.810]  I think it's ambitious for us to think
[03:10:04.930 --> 03:10:07.770]  that that's gonna happen in 2022.
[03:10:09.610 --> 03:10:12.050]  I think we talked to a lot of the veterans
[03:10:12.050 --> 03:10:14.210]  who work with CCHI,
[03:10:14.210 --> 03:10:17.170]  which has been on the ballot multiple times at this point.
[03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:24.330]  I think you can see that there's wisdom there
[03:10:24.330 --> 03:10:28.410]  and we can learn from and adapt and move forward.
[03:10:28.410 --> 03:10:31.850]  So as much as I wanna see change happen tomorrow,
[03:10:32.490 --> 03:10:37.490]  I want it to be tangible and achievable change.
[03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:42.050]  And if that means thinking longer term,
[03:10:42.050 --> 03:10:43.890]  I think that's a good place to start.
[03:10:46.010 --> 03:10:50.650]  Someone asked if your genetic library is intact.
[03:10:52.650 --> 03:10:55.490]  In the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department's
[03:10:55.490 --> 03:10:56.530]  evidence room.
[03:10:56.530 --> 03:10:57.930]  Right, that's what I was gonna say.
[03:10:57.930 --> 03:10:59.330]  No, no, it is not.
[03:11:00.330 --> 03:11:01.170]  No, it is.
[03:11:03.170 --> 03:11:05.570]  After they seized it, I spoke to the evidence officer
[03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:07.890]  and made clear that it's important
[03:11:07.890 --> 03:11:10.610]  and it's documented on the evidence.
[03:11:10.610 --> 03:11:13.770]  Is it in ideal storage conditions?
[03:11:13.770 --> 03:11:14.610]  I doubt it.
[03:11:15.650 --> 03:11:18.210]  But to set my first rodeo
[03:11:18.210 --> 03:11:20.210]  when I've got seats back in the past,
[03:11:22.010 --> 03:11:23.050]  they were viable.
[03:11:23.050 --> 03:11:28.050]  So I'd like to believe that years and years of work
[03:11:28.650 --> 03:11:30.690]  is still intact.
[03:11:30.690 --> 03:11:32.610]  And the beautiful thing about like,
[03:11:32.610 --> 03:11:34.130]  when you have a love affair with seeds
[03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:37.170]  is like the more I just like keep organizing the property
[03:11:37.170 --> 03:11:38.570]  and cleaning up stuff,
[03:11:38.570 --> 03:11:43.570]  I keep finding old gems and old stashes of seeds.
[03:11:44.250 --> 03:11:48.730]  So yeah, but no, they definitely have my treasure chest.
[03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:51.290]  There's no things in the world.
[03:11:51.290 --> 03:11:55.530]  Dan, can you talk about some of your breeding?
[03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:06.630]  Oh, wait, sorry, you're on mute if you didn't know that.
[03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:10.550]  All right, yeah.
[03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:12.670]  Yeah, the thing that I think was always
[03:12:12.670 --> 03:12:16.070]  one of my favorite parts about cannabis was the uniqueness
[03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:17.590]  and just what you see just, you know,
[03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:19.070]  once I first started smoking,
[03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:21.910]  just seeing that there were different types and varieties
[03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:23.630]  and colors and smells.
[03:12:25.150 --> 03:12:28.150]  So I spent a good amount of time over the last 10 years
[03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:29.830]  just working on breeding programs
[03:12:30.310 --> 03:12:33.550]  and trying to, you know, just gain the experience
[03:12:33.550 --> 03:12:36.990]  to know what's in the stuff that I'm working with.
[03:12:36.990 --> 03:12:39.150]  It's been a challenge, you know,
[03:12:39.150 --> 03:12:41.470]  because that's my main motivation is
[03:12:41.470 --> 03:12:42.950]  I'd like to do that full time,
[03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:46.630]  just like be around plants, make plant selections,
[03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:48.590]  go through and really catalog, you know,
[03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:50.710]  everything that I've ever been interested in growing
[03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:51.950]  and create new things.
[03:12:53.630 --> 03:12:56.710]  But, you know, at the same time, you know,
[03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:58.670]  I have a farm and I grow weed
[03:12:58.670 --> 03:13:00.790]  and going through the licensing,
[03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:03.790]  obtaining a nursery license has been, you know, complicated.
[03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:06.310]  So we initially intended that we were gonna do it.
[03:13:06.310 --> 03:13:10.190]  And then, you know, it just became too complicated
[03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:13.830]  to allocate, you know, time for all the different licensing.
[03:13:13.830 --> 03:13:16.710]  So, you know, I'm always breeding
[03:13:16.710 --> 03:13:19.430]  and always making the seeds, but not the way that I want,
[03:13:19.430 --> 03:13:21.150]  you know, and it's tough for me
[03:13:21.150 --> 03:13:22.950]  because when this all first started
[03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:25.430]  towards the end of 2015, you know,
[03:13:25.430 --> 03:13:29.030]  I had moved down South and I took a consulting gig
[03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:31.310]  for a pretty big company at the time.
[03:13:31.310 --> 03:13:34.750]  And it was kind of like everything I've ever dreamed of
[03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:37.710]  as a grower in terms of budget, scale.
[03:13:37.710 --> 03:13:41.270]  By down South, you mean Southern California?
[03:13:41.270 --> 03:13:42.790]  You know, mid coast, you know,
[03:13:42.790 --> 03:13:46.310]  so I was in Monterey County for a little while.
[03:13:46.310 --> 03:13:50.310]  And I had this opportunity where if I basically stuck to it
[03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:52.470]  and committed to it real hard,
[03:13:52.470 --> 03:13:55.190]  I would eventually probably have a dream breeding facility.
[03:13:55.950 --> 03:13:57.670]  Like beyond anything that I'd ever dreamed of,
[03:13:57.670 --> 03:14:02.350]  just, you know, but at the same time, you know,
[03:14:02.350 --> 03:14:05.030]  I prefer to live in less populated areas.
[03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:07.670]  And I like being up in the mountains
[03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:08.990]  and away from so many people.
[03:14:08.990 --> 03:14:10.790]  So it just wasn't the right fit.
[03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:14.150]  And so, yeah, so breeding is really important to me.
[03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:17.270]  It's what I like the most about cannabis
[03:14:17.270 --> 03:14:20.110]  and just trying to balance and make the right time for it.
[03:14:20.110 --> 03:14:25.110]  And, you know, yeah, find my right path for it.
[03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:27.030]  But yeah, of course, you know,
[03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:30.150]  so we're always making selections with friends and partners
[03:14:30.150 --> 03:14:33.390]  and, you know, home grows and stuff like that.
[03:14:33.390 --> 03:14:35.830]  So what's cool about this year is I'm reworking
[03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:37.870]  a bunch of lines that I haven't gotten to dig into
[03:14:37.870 --> 03:14:41.550]  for a while and reselecting from some F3s and F4s
[03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:44.870]  and trying to isolate a few things
[03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:46.670]  that I've been trying to bring out
[03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:49.790]  and just having good seed stock to work in.
[03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:52.550]  The thing is, because I'm limited,
[03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:53.790]  what now I'm always looking to do
[03:14:53.790 --> 03:14:56.550]  is find the right partners to do selection runs
[03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:58.990]  and, you know, find devoted licensed growers
[03:14:58.990 --> 03:15:01.830]  who actually wanna go through my plant populations.
[03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:03.190]  And it's cool because, you know,
[03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:05.630]  I see stuff, you know, popping up all over, you know,
[03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:08.990]  there's licensed grows in Florida that have my genetics
[03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:11.470]  and, you know, I see just random stuff popping up,
[03:15:11.470 --> 03:15:13.510]  people doing selection runs.
[03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:17.230]  So, you know, I'm sure Jackson and I could go on
[03:15:17.230 --> 03:15:21.150]  for a while about breeding and bamboo as well.
[03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:24.950]  But yeah, man, it's cool.
[03:15:31.250 --> 03:15:32.410]  Jackson.
[03:15:36.610 --> 03:15:37.850]  Sorry, dude, I was muted.
[03:15:40.410 --> 03:15:42.050]  What are we talking about here?
[03:15:43.290 --> 03:15:44.330]  What's going on?
[03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:45.170]  What's the score?
[03:15:46.810 --> 03:15:48.090]  Seven, three.
[03:15:50.210 --> 03:15:54.330]  It's breeding and kind of, well, Dan, I mean,
[03:15:54.330 --> 03:15:57.890]  what are you exploring?
[03:15:59.130 --> 03:16:00.330]  Genetics?
[03:16:00.330 --> 03:16:01.770]  Yeah, like.
[03:16:01.770 --> 03:16:03.890]  So I'm going through, you know,
[03:16:03.890 --> 03:16:06.170]  there was a few years where I really got to do
[03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:07.130]  some crazy shit.
[03:16:07.130 --> 03:16:08.490]  It was towards the end of 2015.
[03:16:08.490 --> 03:16:11.610]  And first of all, can you define like,
[03:16:11.610 --> 03:16:13.770]  as a reasonable man, like,
[03:16:14.650 --> 03:16:17.090]  what's the minimum size you would need
[03:16:17.090 --> 03:16:20.410]  to like be really happy breeding?
[03:16:20.410 --> 03:16:24.130]  Like an acre, half an acre, an acre, two acres,
[03:16:24.130 --> 03:16:27.570]  four acres, 75 acres.
[03:16:27.570 --> 03:16:29.250]  I wouldn't need anything like that.
[03:16:29.250 --> 03:16:30.770]  You know, I wouldn't need that type of space.
[03:16:30.770 --> 03:16:32.930]  It's more to isolate.
[03:16:32.930 --> 03:16:35.970]  Like really, if you're breeding something
[03:16:35.970 --> 03:16:38.410]  and you're trying to find the best of the selections,
[03:16:38.410 --> 03:16:41.250]  you really wanna be able to grow several thousand plants.
[03:16:41.250 --> 03:16:43.530]  But I mean, you don't need a ton of space
[03:16:43.530 --> 03:16:45.210]  to grow several thousand plants
[03:16:45.210 --> 03:16:48.690]  and really get a good understanding to characterize them,
[03:16:48.690 --> 03:16:52.330]  you know, and see patterns and what's in the genetics.
[03:16:52.330 --> 03:16:54.330]  But really in my scale of breeding,
[03:16:54.330 --> 03:16:58.370]  if I can pop, you know, 50 seeds of something
[03:16:58.370 --> 03:17:00.250]  would be the minimum that I can at least know
[03:17:00.250 --> 03:17:01.770]  I'll get a good selection of something
[03:17:01.770 --> 03:17:02.650]  that I've already worked.
[03:17:02.650 --> 03:17:04.530]  But what I'd like to do is start at least,
[03:17:04.530 --> 03:17:07.730]  you know, 100 or 200 to go through.
[03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:10.250]  And so that's what I do when I do these breeding runs.
[03:17:10.250 --> 03:17:12.010]  Like right now I'll go through, you know,
[03:17:12.010 --> 03:17:15.530]  our golden grams, our old headband, OG sour lines.
[03:17:15.530 --> 03:17:17.290]  You know, shit, I have such a history
[03:17:17.290 --> 03:17:19.770]  with what those lines are based off of
[03:17:19.770 --> 03:17:20.650]  and what's in there.
[03:17:20.650 --> 03:17:23.050]  And so there's so many things that I have like that
[03:17:23.050 --> 03:17:25.370]  where all I wanna do is find the time in life
[03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:27.490]  and the place in life to pop a few hundred of these
[03:17:27.490 --> 03:17:29.250]  and get back to it and reselect it.
[03:17:30.530 --> 03:17:32.810]  So that's what I'm doing is just trying to find the space
[03:17:32.810 --> 03:17:35.410]  to one or two or three projects at a time
[03:17:35.410 --> 03:17:37.130]  and with different friends and partners,
[03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:41.090]  just always be going through old stock, selecting stuff
[03:17:41.090 --> 03:17:43.810]  and really just, you know, on top of all that,
[03:17:43.810 --> 03:17:46.090]  finding the right production plants.
[03:17:46.090 --> 03:17:49.610]  And the last thing I would say in my interest
[03:17:49.610 --> 03:17:52.450]  is I was always kind of a hater on change
[03:17:52.850 --> 03:17:54.890]  just because I liked the way things were.
[03:17:54.890 --> 03:17:57.170]  So I was kind of late to say,
[03:17:57.170 --> 03:18:00.650]  okay, feminized seeds are pretty cool.
[03:18:00.650 --> 03:18:03.250]  Even auto femmes, I'm not a fan of auto femmes,
[03:18:03.250 --> 03:18:04.930]  but I understand the market for them.
[03:18:04.930 --> 03:18:07.450]  But I wanna explore finding the right, you know,
[03:18:07.450 --> 03:18:10.090]  selections for production out of my genetics
[03:18:10.090 --> 03:18:14.490]  and then, you know, get into making the feminized versions
[03:18:14.490 --> 03:18:17.490]  of those and seeing what can actually be consistent
[03:18:17.490 --> 03:18:19.330]  and continue to breed consistent.
[03:18:19.330 --> 03:18:22.170]  So that eventually, you know, I still wanna always make
[03:18:22.850 --> 03:18:24.370]  and offer regular seeds, but I wanna get to the point
[03:18:24.370 --> 03:18:26.410]  where I say, well, this is this variety.
[03:18:26.410 --> 03:18:29.850]  And when you grow this, you know, whatever version,
[03:18:29.850 --> 03:18:32.970]  you know, of the in cross of the selfing generations,
[03:18:32.970 --> 03:18:35.090]  these are the consistent characteristics.
[03:18:35.090 --> 03:18:35.970]  This is what's in it.
[03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:37.290]  There's nothing else in it.
[03:18:37.290 --> 03:18:42.290]  And then just repopulate, you know, from those moms.
[03:18:42.690 --> 03:18:44.690]  So that's a goal to like get to that point
[03:18:44.690 --> 03:18:48.730]  where every variety we have, instead of reselecting,
[03:18:48.730 --> 03:18:51.530]  you know, or even keeping a ton of ton of males around
[03:18:51.890 --> 03:18:55.850]  in the future, we can just repopulate the same moms,
[03:18:55.850 --> 03:18:58.930]  you know, whatever, and know it's consistent.
[03:19:02.820 --> 03:19:05.180]  Jackson, do you support that strategy?
[03:19:06.100 --> 03:19:07.060]  Yeah, man.
[03:19:07.980 --> 03:19:11.340]  And you know, Dan's one of those dudes who does the,
[03:19:12.860 --> 03:19:14.740]  he does cool breeding.
[03:19:14.740 --> 03:19:19.340]  Like his stuff is like really, you know,
[03:19:20.140 --> 03:19:24.300]  you can plant a big garden at his stuff
[03:19:24.300 --> 03:19:29.100]  that you'll get really some monster plants with some good,
[03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:30.780]  you know, most of the stuff is pretty much
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:32.980]  on the gas side of the spectrum.
[03:19:32.980 --> 03:19:36.340]  And cause he's into that stuff, all that OG sour stuff.
[03:19:36.340 --> 03:19:41.340]  And super, super bomb, you know, big, reliable plants
[03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:47.020]  they throw down and he breeds big, big, big plants
[03:19:47.060 --> 03:19:49.460]  and big wheat that's really dank, you know?
[03:19:49.460 --> 03:19:52.620]  So his strategies are working, you know?
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:55.260]  Yeah, so we're growing some of your stuff this year.
[03:19:56.100 --> 03:19:56.980]  Oh, nice.
[03:19:56.980 --> 03:19:57.900]  What do you got?
[03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:01.220]  We got the Ghost Sky Jaro Popton.
[03:20:01.220 --> 03:20:05.180]  And yep, we've got a couple of those in a hundred gallon pots
[03:20:05.180 --> 03:20:09.340]  and like kind of like our heady tester OG seed plant garden
[03:20:09.340 --> 03:20:11.060]  that we do every year.
[03:20:11.060 --> 03:20:12.060]  Cool.
[03:20:12.060 --> 03:20:13.580]  Yeah, I'll be stoked to see how those stack up
[03:20:13.580 --> 03:20:15.860]  next to the OG sour stuff you got.
[03:20:15.860 --> 03:20:20.860]  In a sense it's OG sour with Hindu and Black Afri thrown.
[03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:25.060]  Nice.
[03:20:25.060 --> 03:20:27.260]  Yeah, I feel like I'm getting to know your turps
[03:20:27.260 --> 03:20:29.860]  just a little bit, you know, and it's cool.
[03:20:29.860 --> 03:20:31.180]  I'm looking forward to kind of blending
[03:20:31.180 --> 03:20:32.380]  some of them together.
[03:20:33.620 --> 03:20:35.620]  Yeah, they should match up good.
[03:20:35.620 --> 03:20:37.700]  I mean, those should be a good one.
[03:20:41.890 --> 03:20:46.890]  Dan, can you talk about like as a commercial cultivator
[03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:51.690]  you can't do stuff in like five pound batches, right?
[03:20:51.690 --> 03:20:53.010]  So like-
[03:20:53.010 --> 03:20:55.850]  You could, I mean, you could do anything you want.
[03:20:55.850 --> 03:20:59.850]  It's just, it's like everything about legal weed
[03:20:59.850 --> 03:21:01.290]  is you're learning as you go
[03:21:01.290 --> 03:21:03.570]  and you're trying not to fuck up too much, right?
[03:21:03.570 --> 03:21:07.450]  And the thing is that everyone, you know, is, I don't know.
[03:21:07.450 --> 03:21:09.050]  There's a lot of amazing people,
[03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:11.570]  but there's a lot of people who are also like,
[03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:13.730]  we'll fuck you over, it's legal weed.
[03:21:13.730 --> 03:21:16.130]  You know, legal weed has been way more shiesty
[03:21:16.130 --> 03:21:18.650]  than illegal weed in my terms,
[03:21:18.650 --> 03:21:22.570]  because in illegal weed, if you had a good reputation,
[03:21:22.570 --> 03:21:24.410]  it's because you're probably a good person.
[03:21:24.410 --> 03:21:27.810]  In legal weed, you know, people don't give a fuck about that.
[03:21:29.490 --> 03:21:33.970]  But what was the question again?
[03:21:33.970 --> 03:21:35.890]  So the question was kind of like,
[03:21:37.170 --> 03:21:42.170]  to do all, if you amortize costs across batches, like-
[03:21:42.370 --> 03:21:44.250]  Oh yeah, small batch.
[03:21:44.250 --> 03:21:46.170]  To do a small batch of something,
[03:21:46.170 --> 03:21:48.530]  I have to pay like testing fees for it
[03:21:48.530 --> 03:21:51.170]  and it's like only like 10 pounds.
[03:21:51.170 --> 03:21:54.570]  Right, yeah, so I mean, it's kind of like this.
[03:21:54.570 --> 03:21:56.330]  If the price of weed is decent
[03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:58.650]  and you're wholesaling a lot, you know,
[03:22:00.010 --> 03:22:02.450]  you know, it's not going to affect you.
[03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:03.450]  It's kind of like,
[03:22:05.530 --> 03:22:08.010]  selling branded product is really complicated
[03:22:08.010 --> 03:22:11.570]  and really expensive if you're just a cultivator,
[03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:14.690]  because it's a lot of money to have licenses
[03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:16.250]  for manufacturing, processing,
[03:22:16.250 --> 03:22:19.290]  and really controlling anything that has to do with
[03:22:21.650 --> 03:22:23.690]  your chain of market and your supply chain.
[03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:25.570]  That's the shit, that's the hard part, you know,
[03:22:25.570 --> 03:22:27.650]  for people like Jackson and me, like,
[03:22:27.650 --> 03:22:30.090]  you know, we know we've been working hard,
[03:22:30.090 --> 03:22:32.530]  you know, we have this weed, we want to share it.
[03:22:32.530 --> 03:22:37.450]  And, you know, it's almost easier to wholesale it
[03:22:37.450 --> 03:22:39.330]  than pay for all the costs of the packaging.
[03:22:39.330 --> 03:22:40.170]  And so that's the thing,
[03:22:40.170 --> 03:22:42.530]  there's just a lot of metrics that you got to consider.
[03:22:42.530 --> 03:22:44.530]  Like, are you selling your weed in bags?
[03:22:44.530 --> 03:22:46.570]  Are you selling it in jars?
[03:22:46.570 --> 03:22:48.210]  Do you have a third party manufacturer
[03:22:48.210 --> 03:22:50.170]  that you have to hire to do all that shit?
[03:22:50.170 --> 03:22:51.770]  How are they charging you?
[03:22:51.770 --> 03:22:55.130]  You know, and what's that final cost going to be
[03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:56.370]  when it comes to market,
[03:22:56.370 --> 03:22:58.050]  when you add up all your trimming?
[03:22:58.050 --> 03:23:00.650]  And so it's just like endless numbers.
[03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:02.570]  But at the end of the day, you know,
[03:23:02.570 --> 03:23:05.250]  at this point, the lab fees, they're expensive,
[03:23:05.250 --> 03:23:09.130]  but they're not as outrageous as they were before.
[03:23:09.130 --> 03:23:11.490]  And so it really just depends on how bad you want
[03:23:11.490 --> 03:23:13.090]  to get a small batch to market.
[03:23:14.290 --> 03:23:15.890]  In the beginning, they're saying, you know,
[03:23:15.890 --> 03:23:20.130]  the minimum or the max batch size is 50 pound lots.
[03:23:20.130 --> 03:23:21.690]  And so everybody's saying, all right, cool,
[03:23:21.690 --> 03:23:22.970]  well, we'll do this to save money
[03:23:22.970 --> 03:23:24.410]  and get it out in 50 pound lots.
[03:23:24.410 --> 03:23:27.130]  But then you need to get all that shit packaged.
[03:23:27.130 --> 03:23:30.570]  You might not want to put 50 pounds of one variety
[03:23:30.570 --> 03:23:32.290]  into a bunch of eighth jars,
[03:23:32.290 --> 03:23:35.250]  if it might sit, you know, on a distributor shelves
[03:23:35.250 --> 03:23:36.170]  and not get sold.
[03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:38.810]  And it's just, you know, are those jars airtight?
[03:23:39.490 --> 03:23:41.210]  There's just a lot to it.
[03:23:42.610 --> 03:23:47.610]  So Cascadian Grown just asked kind of a more articulate
[03:23:47.970 --> 03:23:49.610]  version of what I was trying to ask,
[03:23:49.610 --> 03:23:53.250]  but how much does Rebel have to grow of a strain
[03:23:53.250 --> 03:23:56.530]  to justify the cost of labels and taking it to market?
[03:23:57.970 --> 03:24:00.770]  That's, it's tricky because to me, you know,
[03:24:00.770 --> 03:24:02.810]  there's me and then there's the other people
[03:24:02.810 --> 03:24:05.770]  that I work with who like help me build this dream
[03:24:05.770 --> 03:24:06.610]  that I have.
[03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:09.810]  So to me, I'm just like, I want people to smoke our weed.
[03:24:09.810 --> 03:24:11.010]  We work so hard for it.
[03:24:11.010 --> 03:24:12.890]  Look how good this weed is, right?
[03:24:12.890 --> 03:24:15.170]  To them, it's like, there's a lot to it
[03:24:15.170 --> 03:24:19.450]  if we only have, you know, a small batch of something,
[03:24:19.450 --> 03:24:21.890]  whether it's worth, you know, packaging it up.
[03:24:21.890 --> 03:24:24.530]  And that's just everything that you're doing in life
[03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:26.210]  or in business is just about evolving
[03:24:26.210 --> 03:24:27.170]  and learning as you go.
[03:24:27.170 --> 03:24:30.330]  So, you know, our intention is to, you know,
[03:24:30.330 --> 03:24:33.490]  have the right production plants that we can put stock in
[03:24:33.490 --> 03:24:35.650]  and then add more varieties to the market.
[03:24:35.650 --> 03:24:37.450]  So this year we'll have a good, you know,
[03:24:37.450 --> 03:24:40.490]  six or seven varieties that we have enough of.
[03:24:42.170 --> 03:24:44.570]  And then we just kind of always lead with our heavy hitters
[03:24:44.570 --> 03:24:46.810]  that are just really, really proven.
[03:24:49.370 --> 03:24:51.570]  But I think the question was like,
[03:24:52.530 --> 03:24:55.810]  if you put a one pound batch into the market,
[03:24:55.810 --> 03:24:59.210]  you'd be like, just the testing alone costs me more
[03:24:59.210 --> 03:25:02.450]  than I'll make in the one pound if I package it all.
[03:25:02.490 --> 03:25:07.050]  And so kind of what's the inflection point
[03:25:07.050 --> 03:25:12.050]  or break even point in terms of pounds of a varietal
[03:25:14.370 --> 03:25:17.330]  that you can say, I would actually put this on the market?
[03:25:18.370 --> 03:25:23.130]  I mean, you know, a 10 to 20 pound batch
[03:25:23.130 --> 03:25:27.930]  is a good, you know, a good number.
[03:25:27.930 --> 03:25:29.370]  Cause it's like, you don't want to risk it
[03:25:29.370 --> 03:25:31.610]  sitting there too long or someone fucking up
[03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:33.050]  and not selling it properly.
[03:25:34.490 --> 03:25:37.970]  And in the lab tests are really not that much money.
[03:25:38.850 --> 03:25:41.770]  So, I mean, if you did one pound, yeah, one or two pounds,
[03:25:41.770 --> 03:25:43.770]  you're spending a bunch of money on lab testing
[03:25:43.770 --> 03:25:45.050]  for no reason.
[03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:47.650]  But I think it breaks down.
[03:25:47.650 --> 03:25:49.490]  I mean, if you get a 50 pound lot done,
[03:25:49.490 --> 03:25:52.890]  you're only paying somewhere between like 16 and $25
[03:25:52.890 --> 03:25:55.130]  a pound for lab testing on a 50 pound lot.
[03:25:57.090 --> 03:25:59.930]  And yeah.
[03:26:02.010 --> 03:26:06.930]  So I just lost the question.
[03:26:06.930 --> 03:26:08.090]  Yeah, man, I'm sorry.
[03:26:08.090 --> 03:26:10.570]  I'm a little, you know, I'm-
[03:26:10.570 --> 03:26:12.370]  You answered that question.
[03:26:12.370 --> 03:26:14.650]  I'm on the next question and I lost it
[03:26:14.650 --> 03:26:16.410]  cause the chat's scrolling by.
[03:26:16.410 --> 03:26:20.810]  So Phillip Pala asks, what do you as breeders
[03:26:20.810 --> 03:26:24.130]  think about their genetics popping up here in Europe?
[03:26:24.130 --> 03:26:27.730]  Are there some legit European seed banks you support?
[03:26:27.730 --> 03:26:31.610]  So Jackson, that would probably be directed at you.
[03:26:31.610 --> 03:26:34.290]  Like, is your shit sold in Europe?
[03:26:34.290 --> 03:26:39.290]  And then if so, like, is it all legit
[03:26:39.970 --> 03:26:44.050]  and companies you support and work with?
[03:26:46.410 --> 03:26:48.610]  There's no companies.
[03:26:50.690 --> 03:26:55.690]  Yeah, I mean, you can't get my stuff there from me
[03:26:56.250 --> 03:26:57.090]  that I know of.
[03:26:57.450 --> 03:27:01.050]  Of course, there's always people who have picked stuff up
[03:27:01.050 --> 03:27:04.250]  in the past who can resell it,
[03:27:04.250 --> 03:27:07.490]  but I don't have anything there.
[03:27:09.010 --> 03:27:14.010]  I have a buddy, I'm trying to remember what his company is.
[03:27:16.570 --> 03:27:18.490]  I can't remember it right now.
[03:27:18.490 --> 03:27:21.330]  It sucks, but he did some stuff,
[03:27:21.330 --> 03:27:23.290]  made his own crosses with some of my stuff
[03:27:23.290 --> 03:27:24.850]  and he released them out there.
[03:27:25.570 --> 03:27:30.570]  He's a guy from London and there's people there
[03:27:33.810 --> 03:27:37.290]  who have got stuff of mine and made their own stuff
[03:27:37.290 --> 03:27:41.890]  out of it, but yeah, I don't sell seeds in Europe
[03:27:41.890 --> 03:27:42.730]  or anything.
[03:27:44.330 --> 03:27:45.170]  Got it.
[03:27:46.850 --> 03:27:50.530]  All right, well, how about on that, we wrap it up
[03:27:50.530 --> 03:27:52.330]  cause I'm sure everybody wants to.
[03:27:52.610 --> 03:27:54.090]  I certainly wanna go to bed,
[03:27:55.810 --> 03:27:59.450]  but I appreciate the like 250 people
[03:27:59.450 --> 03:28:00.890]  who are still tuned in.
[03:28:02.130 --> 03:28:04.930]  Jesse, are you still alive?
[03:28:04.930 --> 03:28:07.930]  Oh my God, I see Jesse, I see his head.
[03:28:09.530 --> 03:28:13.900]  Jesse's trying to find the unmute button.
[03:28:15.660 --> 03:28:20.660]  Bam, Dan, Red Sox.
[03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:22.580]  I'm trying to make my daughter's name
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:24.700]  Red Sox, I'm trying to make my daughter
[03:28:24.700 --> 03:28:29.700]  into a Boston sports team lover in an LA market.
[03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:34.540]  Jackson, thanks for.
[03:28:34.540 --> 03:28:36.540]  Just tell her to remember her boots
[03:28:36.540 --> 03:28:38.180]  and where the company is.
[03:28:38.180 --> 03:28:40.620]  I mean, like it just, it's important to me.
[03:28:42.220 --> 03:28:45.820]  Just if you care about me, you will not like the Lakers,
[03:28:45.820 --> 03:28:47.180]  you'll like the Celtics.
[03:28:49.220 --> 03:28:52.020]  I would be very sad if you were a Lakers fan.
[03:28:53.340 --> 03:28:56.420]  You gotta throw on all the old Celtics games.
[03:28:56.420 --> 03:29:00.140]  Right, this is Larry Bird, 80s.
[03:29:02.020 --> 03:29:03.300]  When I was growing up.
[03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:07.620]  All right, well, with that, I'm gonna kill the live stream.
[03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:09.260]  So thank you everyone.
