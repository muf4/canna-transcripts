[00:13.240 --> 00:19.780]  Hey everybody, we are back with another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:19.780 --> 00:24.080]  Thank you for joining us this evening and we appreciate you hanging in there. We
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.520]  were getting the mics to sound just right because we've got some quality
[00:27.520 --> 00:33.040]  content tonight. The title kind of says it all. We are talking with Kiss Organics.
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.640]  We have Tad Hussey and Brandon Hudson and we're gonna be using a little bit of
[00:38.640 --> 00:43.520]  applied science to some of these common organic practices we all love to talk
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.600]  and hear about. First though, I want to introduce these people. So up top we have
[00:49.600 --> 00:54.520]  Tad Hussey. Tad, you are owner operator of Kiss Organics. How are you doing tonight?
[00:54.520 --> 01:03.280]  Oh, on mute. Sorry, you're on mute. There we go. I made it. Super excited to be here.
[01:03.280 --> 01:07.080]  Thanks for having us on, Tad. Really appreciate it. Yeah, my pleasure and
[01:07.080 --> 01:11.280]  Brandon too. Thanks. You're actually joining us from the same location
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.100]  tonight, just separate room. Flew in from the East Coast. Yeah, yeah. So super
[01:17.100 --> 01:22.400]  excited. Yeah, oh man. Good to have you guys here. And you know, before
[01:22.400 --> 01:26.360]  we get into some of the, you know, the kind of the concepts and the deeper
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.960]  meaning of it all, I want to just kind of let everybody know a little bit about
[01:30.960 --> 01:38.920]  your backgrounds. You guys have very awesome pasts and a lot of experience. So
[01:38.920 --> 01:42.920]  real quickly, you know, for maybe, you know, the people listening that might not
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.280]  have gone to the website or seen your podcasts, can you maybe tell us a
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.920]  little bit about your background and we'll start with you, Tad?
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.920]  Absolutely. Can I go back to high school when apparently we went to school
[01:54.920 --> 02:03.680]  together? We were on the same Little League team. Yeah, it's so crazy. I was
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.440]  so impressed that you remember that. Yeah, so I grew up with my parents
[02:08.440 --> 02:12.840]  owning a plant nursery. So I've been around plants pretty much my entire
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.400]  life. After college, I came back with a master's degree and got really
[02:17.400 --> 02:24.160]  involved in starting a urban farm and feed store, organic hydro shop, and soil
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.800]  nutrient company, amendment company. So that's really where it all started. And
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.920]  since then, we've really worked hard on taking a science-based approach to
[02:33.920 --> 02:37.640]  everything that we do, where we gather the data, do the research, and really work
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.000]  because when I first got into this industry, it was all new to me.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.800]  And I'd walked into my first hydro shop and I saw all of these bottles on the
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.080]  shelf, you know, and some of them had, you know, caricatures of women or like these
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.560]  monster plants. And I had grown up in nursery my whole life. I'd never seen
[02:56.560 --> 03:01.600]  anything like this. And so for me, something that I'm really passionate
[03:01.600 --> 03:04.960]  about is sort of debunking a lot of this stuff and figuring out like looking it
[03:04.960 --> 03:07.560]  in the label and looking at the ingredients and really figuring out what
[03:07.560 --> 03:10.560]  we need to actually grow cannabis. Because the first time I wanted to grow,
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.960]  I found it very daunting. The only advice I could get was on forums or from
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.960]  the guy at the hydro shop. So that's where it all started. And then since then,
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.520]  I started a podcast called Cannabis Cultivation Science, where I've had some
[03:25.520 --> 03:30.360]  amazing guests. I'm so fortunate to have had some really awesome people come on
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.560]  sharing cannabis research to sort of bridging the gap between the research
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.880]  side, horticulture, and actual cannabis growers. So that's my background. And
[03:41.880 --> 03:46.200]  yeah, really excited to be here. Yeah, thank you. And it's, you know, again, it's
[03:46.200 --> 03:50.240]  so important, those podcasts, I listen to them. And everybody, these links will be
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.560]  in the show notes as well. But you break it down, you make it possible for people
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.800]  like myself to understand. And I enjoy that. Not every research paper is meant
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.440]  to be understood by the layman. But it's great to have the thirst for that science
[04:06.440 --> 04:10.080]  and to know it exists and needs to be applied. So I appreciate how you break it
[04:10.080 --> 04:11.360]  down in that podcast.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.360]  Oh, thanks, man. Yeah.
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.080]  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. My pleasure. And Brandon, you've actually been a guest on
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.600]  the podcast as well. But you have your own amazing background here. Just a couple
[04:23.600 --> 04:25.400]  years of growing experience I've heard.
[04:25.960 --> 04:32.560]  Yeah, one or two. I've been at it for a second. Yeah. So I've got 37 years of me
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.040]  growing. Personally, you know, I grew up in East Tennessee with hippie parents, and
[04:37.040 --> 04:42.600]  they were growing, you know, outdoors, my uncles and that kind of stuff. But I, you
[04:42.640 --> 04:50.240]  know, I've been growing for 37 years. I've tried every kind of, you know, I started
[04:50.240 --> 04:57.440]  off, you know, doing native soil and pots, like doing all kinds of, you know, funny
[04:57.440 --> 05:04.600]  stuff now. But all the hydro stuff, deep water, coliseums, ebb and flow. So I've just
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.880]  been at it for a really long time. I love this plant. I'm very passionate about it. I
[05:09.880 --> 05:16.720]  ran a commercial hemp farm in South Carolina for five years. That was really nice to
[05:16.720 --> 05:22.880]  just be able to grow indoor and in greenhouses and in the field on scale. And to be
[05:22.880 --> 05:29.200]  able to have that, you know, five years of that just run after run after run. I
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.560]  couldn't, you know, 20,000 cuts at a time, 40,000 cuttings at a time, like getting it.
[05:34.960 --> 05:41.720]  And so that was really nice. And then I got the opportunity to work with Tad. And now
[05:41.720 --> 05:47.160]  I'm one of the soil nerds at KISS. And it's the coolest gig in the world, you know,
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.360]  because I get to talk to growers and I get to talk to people and I get to help growers.
[05:52.560 --> 06:00.160]  And as a farmer on scale myself, I know how desperate you are sometimes for some help.
[06:00.160 --> 06:08.880]  And it feels so good to be able to help some people and, you know, bring real, actionable
[06:08.880 --> 06:13.960]  data is what I think of when I think of KISS. And that's what I think that Tad has been
[06:13.960 --> 06:18.920]  providing and continues to provide. And I'm really proud to be on the team. And, you
[06:18.920 --> 06:25.000]  know, we want to work off of metrics, you know, 10, 15 years ago, you know, how do you
[06:25.120 --> 06:33.480]  put together a concise, organic trial? It's all it was all trial and error. Now, because
[06:33.480 --> 06:39.960]  of, you know, prohibition, easing its grip, and the fact that we can do research, we've
[06:39.960 --> 06:44.440]  got now we're armed with data, so we should use it, you know, and so it's, it's really
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.400]  exciting. It's a really exciting time. As the as the old head, I'm really excited to
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.840]  see just the door opening.
[06:52.840 --> 06:57.600]  Indeed, man, and it's great to have you two together. I think someone already said it
[06:57.600 --> 07:02.840]  here. We got the dream team with us tonight. So it's gonna be a fun one. Yes.
[07:02.840 --> 07:05.600]  Right on. Thank you, bro.
[07:05.600 --> 07:11.880]  Dropping in to say hello. I love it. So one of the things you know, that we automatically
[07:11.880 --> 07:15.920]  or I just heard here is first of all, we're talking kind of about large outdoor, we're
[07:15.920 --> 07:22.520]  talking about scale. Now, a lot of cannabis growers like myself are not at scale. Some
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.880]  of us may be indoor, some of us may be in a four by four tent. Do the same rules apply
[07:27.880 --> 07:31.920]  to scale as they apply to an indoor garden?
[07:31.920 --> 07:39.640]  No, not at all. And even indoor and outdoor are totally different. But here's, here's
[07:39.640 --> 07:45.560]  my thing about it. There are absolutely things that you can do in an indoor tent that you
[07:45.560 --> 07:51.000]  would never consider doing on scale. But we can still take like best practices, and
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.320]  we can take the research that's being done and what people are doing on scale and still
[07:54.320 --> 07:59.920]  apply it to our tent. So I think that's the really the key thing because I see and that's
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.240]  one of the things that we want to talk about with you today, Chad is there's a lot of information
[08:03.240 --> 08:08.000]  out there. There's almost too much information at this point in time. And there's a lot of
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.440]  things that I'm seeing where people are showing some really nice looking plants and tents.
[08:13.440 --> 08:18.480]  A lot of those concepts, though, will not translate to growing on scale. It's too many
[08:18.480 --> 08:25.000]  touches on the plant. It's it's too high of a cost. It's just some of it's not even really
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.800]  that that like backed by researcher data, but you know, we see influencers doing it.
[08:30.800 --> 08:34.480]  And so we think we need to buy these things. And one of the things that I would like to
[08:34.480 --> 08:37.640]  talk about today is just how can you save money as a grower? What things do you really
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.640]  need in your garden? What things do you just, you know, if you want to play around with
[08:41.640 --> 08:46.600]  great but aren't necessarily things that you need to grow a really awesome, healthy
[08:46.600 --> 08:53.840]  plant? Yeah. And just to jump in on that, you know, we're watching the cannabis industry
[08:53.840 --> 08:59.840]  nationwide. It's not even done yet. And it's there's a lot of casualties right now. You
[08:59.840 --> 09:04.840]  know, there's a lot of people losing farms. And, you know, so when you're looking at the
[09:04.840 --> 09:11.320]  big box versions of cannabis and looking at that war of attrition model that they're you
[09:11.320 --> 09:17.320]  know, they can afford to take a loss for 10 years and all the small guys will disappear.
[09:17.320 --> 09:22.720]  So if you want to be here when the when the dust settles, you've got to keep your overhead
[09:22.720 --> 09:29.160]  low. Your your margins are everything. You know, even 10 years ago, margins, you could
[09:29.160 --> 09:33.960]  you could put anything you wanted into cannabis because you could get you know, you get three,
[09:33.960 --> 09:41.680]  four, six K a pound all day long. Those days are gone. And so you have to be tight. And
[09:41.680 --> 09:46.520]  you know, it's fun to experiment. That's one of my favorite things about small four by
[09:46.520 --> 09:50.760]  fours and stuff like that. You can go for it because it's not going to cost you an arm
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.480]  and a leg. But when you get to scale, if you're trying to, you know, like Tad said, those
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.000]  touches every touch is money, you know, like that one of the things I love about the kiss
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.760]  SOP with the soil, and I don't want to turn it into an ad, but just organic moving soil.
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.520]  Let me say that one of the things I love about that is that the SOP is actually so much more
[10:10.520 --> 10:15.640]  simple. There's so many few fewer touches, you know, if you preload your soil with full
[10:15.640 --> 10:22.240]  nutrients for around, that's it. You know, and now you can go defoliate, you can go scout
[10:22.240 --> 10:27.480]  and scope and do the things that, you know, as a high level grower, you should be doing.
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.360]  Absolutely. You know, just, and even, you know, there's like that indoor large scale
[10:34.360 --> 10:39.120]  too. I tend to, you know, cause I'm a small scale home grower. That's always where my
[10:39.120 --> 10:44.320]  brain tends to go. And then there's outdoor, but even the indoor, just the placement of
[10:44.320 --> 10:48.920]  the water faucet, how far do you have to walk to get water to all of these plants? Those
[10:48.920 --> 10:54.640]  little things along to what Tad was saying is just touches. Some things just don't work
[10:54.680 --> 10:55.400]  Relay.
[10:55.960 --> 11:01.040]  Right. Right. And you start getting on scale. Like your workflow has to make sense. Like,
[11:01.040 --> 11:07.600]  you know, like I had a 3000 square foot head house, a thousand moms I could do up to
[11:07.600 --> 11:14.280]  60,000 cuttings. I had a 7,200 square foot greenhouse, you know, that's the canopy. And
[11:14.720 --> 11:22.320]  so indoor on scale, greenhouse on scale, outdoor on scale. But like Tad said, those,
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.760]  those, those best practices, you can go back to a four by four, but you can't necessarily
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.480]  necessarily go from the four by four. Cause it's just not going to be cost effective.
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.160]  I always joke whenever I hear that I'm like, you ever see a 20,000 square foot facility
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.240]  with Clippy fans?
[11:39.560 --> 11:42.360]  There's one out there. I bet you. I bet you.
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.520]  I feel like we've seen it all at this point. Cause unfortunately people do, you know, you
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.600]  hire a head grower who's only grown in their basement and they might be a really great
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.920]  grower running general hydro on 20 plants. And they may have been doing that for 10 years,
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.120]  but what do you do that first time the nutrient line changes their formulation or a problem
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.520]  crops up that they hadn't, you know, they hadn't had to deal with in the past. And it
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.360]  really, it makes a big difference. Yeah.
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.800]  It makes a big difference. Yeah. I mean, scale is mind blowing for most people. It just
[12:15.000 --> 12:15.600]  sinks them.
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.960]  You know, you go from my level of just, I practice good cultural practices. I don't
[12:21.960 --> 12:28.080]  necessarily need to be proactive in an indoor scale environment. You absolutely have to
[12:28.080 --> 12:33.280]  be proactive. So we can get away with that, but that's where we're kind of getting away
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.520]  from what I wanted to get to here is, you know, I love buzzwords. Everybody loves
[12:38.520 --> 12:43.480]  buzzwords. So, and it's actually a real term. It's not a buzzword, but biomimicry.
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.000]  Biomimicry is something that we hear a lot about, and that can actually mean a lot of
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.240]  things. And I kind of want to give you guys free reigns to explore biomimicry and maybe
[12:53.240 --> 12:58.560]  some places where it would and wouldn't work, why it may or may not. But I always, you
[12:58.560 --> 13:02.280]  know, when I see, and this, again, this is just me, I am not the smart person on the
[13:02.280 --> 13:08.560]  episode, people. So listen to them. I'm the jokester. Every, every time I see like cover
[13:08.560 --> 13:16.560]  crops and like a three gallon plant, I'm like, okay, that's just cute. But I, I'm not
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.920]  sure that does so much, but to the point that's kind of biomimicry outdoors, I like
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.120]  cover crops. So let me turn that over to you guys and maybe what does that mean? Or
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.920]  what are some of the misconceptions you've seen out there?
[13:29.760 --> 13:37.280]  Can I just say, I just want to say there's, there's all these different factors, cover
[13:37.280 --> 13:43.800]  cropping, companion planting, layering. There's all these different aspects of
[13:43.800 --> 13:49.920]  biomimicry. First and foremost, and I'd love to get into every one of them, but first
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.920]  and foremost, there's nothing natural about agriculture. It's not, there's no monocrops
[13:56.920 --> 14:01.280]  free of pests and pathogens out in nature. It just doesn't happen. It doesn't occur. And
[14:01.280 --> 14:07.720]  that's what we're doing inside. And so my thing is I'm not trying to mimic nature. I'm
[14:07.920 --> 14:14.200]  providing a perfect or as close to perfect maxed out environment that I possibly can.
[14:14.200 --> 14:21.400]  And that's PPFD, that's CO2, that's air exchange, that's fertigation, water, that's
[14:21.400 --> 14:27.480]  everything. And so we're trying to turn it to 11, you know, if nature's 10 or, you know,
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.720]  or maybe a six, if you get hit with fusarium, you know, or whatever, but in, you know,
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.320]  we're trying to do better than that. And so just, I like to preface any of my
[14:37.320 --> 14:42.560]  conversations with about biomimicry in just terms of like, even if there's a concept you
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.920]  like, turn it up, maximize it, you know, based off the data. Ted?
[14:48.040 --> 14:54.920]  Yeah, I mean, it sounds great. It really does. Like I love, we're organic folks ourselves. You
[14:54.920 --> 15:00.960]  know, I try to eat all organic food that I can. I don't use any conventional pesticides,
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.320]  herbicides, things like that in my garden. That's really important to me. You know, I
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.400]  love getting out in nature and going hiking, big fans of nature. I'm an environmentalist,
[15:10.400 --> 15:15.920]  all those things. But like Brandon mentioned, you know, what we're doing is not natural.
[15:15.920 --> 15:19.760]  Agriculture, you know, selecting one crop and calling everything else a weed is not what
[15:19.760 --> 15:23.680]  nature does. And nature also doesn't harvest that one plant and pull it out of the
[15:23.680 --> 15:27.760]  environment. Like you have an ecosystem in nature. That ecosystem is not designed to
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.160]  maximize the health and growth of one single crop. It's for the maximize the health and
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.800]  growth of the entire ecosystem, you know. And so when we grow a plant, we're removing,
[15:38.240 --> 15:44.720]  we're removing, you know, nutrients, we're removing biomass from that ecosystem. And so
[15:44.960 --> 15:53.440]  that ecosystem and those need to be replaced. And so as much as I love this idea of biomimicry
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.280]  and diversity, I think those things are all very important. I think we just need to take
[15:57.280 --> 16:00.880]  a more critical eye into how we look at them. And you mentioned, you know, cover crops.
[16:01.680 --> 16:07.680]  Brandon mentioned, you know, layering or some of those things. I think, I think you just have to
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.080]  look a little more critically at what those concepts are and why we're doing those. And if
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.640]  the benefits outweigh some of the negative aspects of them, and then make a determination
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.400]  on whether or not you want your garden. And we can absolutely talk about, you know, one of those
[16:20.400 --> 16:27.760]  topics in depth, but. Economic threshold. That's, that's the. They look great on Instagram. I mean,
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.840]  I love seeing those pictures on social media with the clover or some of those, I mean, the
[16:31.840 --> 16:37.360]  dichondria, it looks phenomenal. But I don't know if that's necessarily what we would call best
[16:37.360 --> 16:43.600]  practice. You can still absolutely do it. But I think there's some challenges.
[16:44.240 --> 16:49.040]  And it sounds like one of those things too, where it may not necessarily be detrimental,
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.920]  but it might not have the full effect that we are anticipating. And you had mentioned clover,
[16:55.920 --> 17:00.720]  and this is something that I've actually mentioned to you before, you know, a lot of people hear
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.560]  clover, they think, you know, atmospheric nitrogen, it fixates nitrogen, it puts it in your
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.880]  soil, great, I'm going to throw some clover, and I don't need to give my plant any nitrogen.
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.600]  Like, is that close to the truth or far from the truth?
[17:16.720 --> 17:23.280]  It's a little both. So yes, clover in relationship with rhizobia will fix atmospheric nitrogen.
[17:23.280 --> 17:29.360]  That's absolutely true. It's been proven by science. Now, interestingly enough, in I believe
[17:29.360 --> 17:35.360]  North Dakota, Dr. Abby wick did some research with a bunch of crops in the soil. But what they
[17:35.360 --> 17:40.000]  found was that nitrogen wasn't being released to the successive crop. So that when they grew
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.040]  clover, clover as a cover crop, they were not getting it for their next crop of corn or whatever
[17:45.040 --> 17:50.560]  their their main staple crop was after that. The nitrogen was actually fixed somehow in the
[17:50.560 --> 17:55.760]  colloidal layers of the clay and they haven't, they don't know it's essentially what you told me
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.840]  in the interview is they don't really know what's going on, but they're not getting that release.
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.040]  And that's one of the things with clover too, is we don't know. Well, it requires that microbial
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.680]  relationship. And then we don't know when it's being released to the plant. So one of the things
[18:09.680 --> 18:15.680]  that Brandon is does with KISS and you know, other agronomists is you look at how much nitrogen do
[18:15.680 --> 18:21.040]  you want for that, that cycle, whether it's a full cycle with veg and flower or just through flower,
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.600]  and we have target numbers that we can look at a soil test and say, okay, you know, if we have
[18:25.600 --> 18:35.840]  about 125 pounds per acre of nitrates, pounds per acre of PPM, Brandon, I'm blanking right now.
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.200]  PPM. Okay, so double the number. For your pounds per acre. And so,
[18:43.280 --> 18:47.120]  yeah, yeah. That's a good starting place for nitrates. We know where the plant will finish,
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.680]  for cultivars. Yeah. So we have targets when you throw clover into the mix,
[18:52.400 --> 18:57.680]  that just becomes a little bit more challenging. Assuming that we're getting some nitrogen release.
[18:58.400 --> 19:05.760]  Okay. My thing about clover is, and cover cropping indoors, my big thing is that one,
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.680]  you know, like Tad said, take a critical eye. So what are your advantages of a cover crop? Outdoor,
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.880]  it's great for moisture retention in management. It's great to prevent erosion. You get some
[19:18.880 --> 19:26.880]  atmospheric nitrogen, maybe, you do, but not, we don't control that, you know, in the way that we
[19:26.880 --> 19:35.440]  like to think we do. So move that inside. If you've got erosion inside, growing's not your thing.
[19:35.440 --> 19:42.560]  Try music, try art, but if you've got erosion inside, something's wrong. There's other better
[19:42.560 --> 19:49.920]  ways to deliver, you know, like blue mats. I'd do that over cover cropping any day. And I've got
[19:49.920 --> 19:55.520]  friends that swear by cover cropping. They love it. And that's great. It's an individual decision.
[19:55.520 --> 20:02.720]  And for me, when somebody consults with me, my comment about it is always, if you do this,
[20:04.240 --> 20:10.320]  one, that's another crop you have to manage. It's that much many more touches.
[20:11.040 --> 20:17.760]  What is the benefit? Do you see an actual bump in your harvest? Do you see an increase in quality?
[20:17.760 --> 20:25.920]  Do you see that? If you don't, there's no reason to do it. And then when and if you get a pest or
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.800]  a pathogen with a cover crop or mulch, you're in serious trouble indoors. Like really, you're not
[20:32.800 --> 20:36.720]  going to get thrips out if you've got mulch and clover. You're not going to get it.
[20:37.680 --> 20:41.280]  I think clover, I think of thrips and that's what a lot of people associate with it. There's
[20:41.280 --> 20:44.800]  better cover crops than clover. I don't want to say that all people that are cover cropping
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.280]  are using clover because that's not fair. There are some-
[20:47.280 --> 20:49.040]  That was me. That was this guy.
[20:52.880 --> 20:59.760]  Regardless of the cover crop, you're potentially setting yourself up for an IPM disaster.
[20:59.840 --> 21:07.520]  As somebody who has fought russets on scale, got them out of 12,000 square feet,
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.320]  somebody that's fought two-spotted spider mites, aphids, thrips, every fungal pathogen you can
[21:16.320 --> 21:23.920]  imagine, it's simply not worth the risk to me. I'm not letting it in the door. On scale, it makes
[21:23.920 --> 21:31.680]  zero sense to me. If it's something that you want to do outdoor, I salute you. I think it's
[21:31.680 --> 21:37.600]  phenomenal. I think it makes a lot of sense outdoors. Indoors, I think you're setting
[21:37.600 --> 21:44.240]  yourself up for some really bad heartache. That's my resistance to it. It's a personal decision.
[21:44.240 --> 21:50.880]  Right. To be fair, the other side or the argument there is that it helps keep the soil moist. In a
[21:50.880 --> 21:57.200]  living soil system, you need to keep it moist. How do you then make up for that?
[21:57.200 --> 22:06.080]  Blue mats. You'll get an increase in harvest. I don't work for blue mats. I'm not going to say.
[22:08.080 --> 22:13.920]  We've done side by sides. Dr. Ben Higgins, chief research scientist for KISS and Goldleaf,
[22:13.920 --> 22:20.400]  has done side by sides. They got a statistically relevant bump with their harvest from just by
[22:21.120 --> 22:28.880]  automating their water. Watering is the number one cause of crop failure in protected agriculture,
[22:28.880 --> 22:34.800]  whether it's greenhouse or indoor. The most trained person is who should be on the hose,
[22:34.800 --> 22:47.200]  and they rarely are. It's usually a sweat job. Managing your water by automating it on scale,
[22:47.840 --> 22:54.960]  if you're hand watering, you're not going to be here. I've hand watered that whole greenhouse,
[22:55.680 --> 23:00.720]  hand watered it for years. Horrible, horrible. The margins on what you're paying somebody to
[23:00.720 --> 23:06.880]  do that, to stand on a hose for eight, 10 hours a day, it doesn't make sense. Then blue mats,
[23:07.760 --> 23:14.720]  with the tensiometer, you can dial in the perfect millibar setting for your beds.
[23:15.200 --> 23:21.200]  You can keep... That's why we like the raised beds. You don't want a tall, thin profile,
[23:21.200 --> 23:27.600]  because then all your water is going to settle to the bottom. A short, a 12-inch side with 10
[23:27.600 --> 23:33.840]  inches of soil, that's really easy to manage. Part of it's just starting off in the right pot.
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.200]  You want a scotch glass and not a beer stein, because you can't manage the moisture in that.
[23:41.760 --> 23:47.120]  It's too much. You've got capillary and gravity. People forget about there's two factors
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.800]  with water. That, we could segue into the perched water tables and...
[23:54.960 --> 23:59.920]  I want to comment on the watering thing. If someone were to say to me,
[23:59.920 --> 24:03.680]  hey, I'm really bad at watering. By using cover crops, I'm able to
[24:04.640 --> 24:11.200]  keep my soil moist and manage my water better. I could go for that. I could get behind that.
[24:12.720 --> 24:18.960]  The biggest reason for me not to, besides having another crop to manage, is pests and pathogens.
[24:20.080 --> 24:27.120]  As your cannabis plant shades out that cover crop, there's going to be more detritus,
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.880]  more dead organic matter in that pot that's going to be more susceptible to any pathogens that may
[24:32.880 --> 24:38.480]  be coming in, fungal pathogens. Some of which could transfer to your cannabis plant.
[24:38.480 --> 24:39.200]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani, Channel 10
[24:39.200 --> 24:42.880]  Creating a microclimate between that cover crop and the bottom of your canopy.
[24:44.240 --> 24:52.000]  We all know that we need that air movement to keep from—we're always looking for fungally
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.520]  resistant plants, but that's not necessarily what you want. There might be a cultivar that's
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.680]  on your list. You want to set up a safe environment for it as possible.
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.640]  Dr. Tim Jackson You said watering too. You want the most
[25:10.640 --> 25:16.240]  experienced person on there. There sometimes can be a learning curve when you're switching from one
[25:16.240 --> 25:25.680]  system to the next. I recently had done that. I saw some pretty awesome results. One of the things
[25:25.760 --> 25:32.560]  that I did see from the Kiss Organics, I used the biochar as opposed to the other soils,
[25:32.560 --> 25:38.640]  was the fine root hair growth. I was really surprised at the end when I turned everything
[25:38.640 --> 25:46.640]  and tore it apart, how many just little root hairs there were comparatively. Now, is that because I
[25:46.640 --> 25:54.640]  was getting better water infiltration in that soil or was that just kind of the special sauce in the
[25:54.640 --> 25:57.040]  mix there? Dr. Tim Jackson
[25:57.040 --> 26:02.720]  Were they all the same cultivar? Dr. Tim Jackson
[26:02.720 --> 26:05.600]  Yes. Actually, these were clones that were started out in there.
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.840]  Dr. Tim Jackson Okay. It probably would be the
[26:09.840 --> 26:14.800]  physical properties of the soil might have been slightly different, would be my guess, or the
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.160]  nutrient levels were slightly different to where the plant was able to produce more feeder roots,
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.520]  because it's really those feeder roots, those tiny root hairs, that's what really manages
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.560]  nutrient uptake. It's not these big structural roots that you see pushing through. Those roots
[26:30.560 --> 26:34.960]  are really just there. They're branches on the tree to support the leaves, which would be your
[26:34.960 --> 26:42.320]  feeder roots. When you're watering, since we're talking about root hairs, root hairs are really
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.040]  the most important thing. Watering, this was something my botany teacher told me that blew
[26:47.040 --> 26:52.000]  my mind the first time I heard it. He goes, the symptoms for overwatering and underwatering are
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.680]  exactly the same. I was like, no, because when I think of underwater, I think of like a crispy
[26:57.680 --> 27:01.920]  plant, but I see overwatering, I think of like a droopy plant. He's like, you're doing the exact
[27:01.920 --> 27:05.840]  same thing in the soil. You're killing your root hairs. When you have root hair death,
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.080]  the plant can't uptake nutrients, it can't uptake everything that it needs to be healthy. That's
[27:12.160 --> 27:15.840]  why you're seeing what you're seeing. Symptomatically, they can display
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.240]  exactly alike. I thought that was really interesting.
[27:21.040 --> 27:27.760]  When I think of really good root production, I think on the nutrient side, I think adequate
[27:27.760 --> 27:34.480]  phosphorus right from the rip. You've got available phosphorus. A lot of people think that that's
[27:34.480 --> 27:38.800]  driving their flower. It's great for flower set, but you really need it for your roots right out
[27:38.800 --> 27:47.520]  of the gate. I think you probably answered the question in the beginning. When I think
[27:47.520 --> 27:54.480]  healthy roots, I think you've got your irrigation dialed in. You've got your air to water ratio
[27:55.120 --> 28:01.840]  dialed in. If you don't, like Ted said, either way, too dry or too wet, you're going to see issues.
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.160]  You're causing the root. Go ahead. One thing to mention is I saw you were holding Jeff's book,
[28:08.720 --> 28:12.480]  and you'd interviewed him recently on the team of bacteria. There you go.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.520]  That process is really interesting as well and could potentially relate to having more root
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.840]  growth. If there's more of the endophytic bacteria in a particular soil over another,
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.080]  that could be a factor. Again, that's just speculation. I don't know.
[28:29.040 --> 28:31.920]  Tedd Johnson And I need to dive into it. It arrived today.
[28:32.960 --> 28:37.600]  I took it out, and I'm like, I've got to work this into the show somehow. Maybe I can look smart if
[28:37.600 --> 28:41.920]  I'm just open right. Oh, hi there. Jeff Leighton Sorry. I was reading.
[28:41.920 --> 28:49.840]  Tedd Johnson Yes. Actually, I have read a few books. One of the things from my soil science
[28:49.840 --> 28:56.480]  classes that we learned a lot about is we learned a lot about horizon layers, horizontal soil. Now,
[28:57.040 --> 29:02.080]  the best example of this is when you see the side of a cliff or you picture the dinosaur bones,
[29:02.080 --> 29:07.200]  and you see the different colors and the different layers. To me, that makes sense. But that's a whole
[29:07.200 --> 29:15.200]  lot of space. One of the things that comes up or has come up with using that sort of system in
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.240]  smaller containers, and by smaller, I mean maybe even up to like a 20 gallon. I don't know if
[29:20.240 --> 29:27.760]  there's a size where all of a sudden it makes more benefits versus less. But perched water table,
[29:27.760 --> 29:33.280]  that's something that comes up frequently. What does that mean? What are we talking about when
[29:33.280 --> 29:40.400]  we hear horizontal soils and perched water tables? What does that really mean for everybody out there?
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.160]  If that's even a question. Jeff Leighton
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.040]  I know Brandon really wants to talk about it. No, we're just looking at each other.
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.240]  Jason Tucker
[29:48.240 --> 29:49.520]  Yeah, who wants to tap in?
[29:49.520 --> 29:49.760]  Jeff Leighton
[29:49.760 --> 29:51.520]  Go ahead. All right. We'll go, Brandon.
[29:51.520 --> 29:51.600]  Brandon Taylor
[29:51.600 --> 29:59.040]  I'll jump on it. I'll jump on it. My mom is, hey, Pam, Brandon, how are you?
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.080]  My mom is a professional. She's retired, but she's a professional horticulturalist.
[30:04.800 --> 30:12.560]  I have a twin brother, Jason. What's up, Jason? We used to help my mom plant stuff up. You'd have
[30:12.560 --> 30:17.680]  an assembly line. My brother would take a pot, tear off a piece of newspaper so nothing would
[30:17.680 --> 30:20.960]  fall through the bottom of the terracotta. It was back when all you could get was terracotta. There
[30:20.960 --> 30:27.040]  weren't plastic pots. Then I would put gravel in the bottom of it and then hand it to my mom.
[30:27.040 --> 30:35.920]  She'd pot it and put some soil in. Then we thought intuitively that that was a great idea.
[30:36.560 --> 30:42.640]  Because if you have something more porous on the bottom, intuitively you would think that you would
[30:43.440 --> 30:48.560]  decrease the opportunity for root rot and fungal pathogens, root pathogens, that kind of stuff.
[30:48.560 --> 30:56.560]  That's the point of having that drainage layer at the bottom. What we've been able to demonstrate
[30:57.520 --> 31:05.840]  repeatedly is that regardless of whether the lower substrate is more or less porous,
[31:05.840 --> 31:09.840]  it doesn't matter. You could have sand on top and clay on the bottom, clay on top,
[31:09.840 --> 31:15.840]  sand on the bottom, reverse. It doesn't matter. When you pour water in, it doesn't do what you
[31:15.840 --> 31:21.200]  expect. Again, it's what I said earlier. You've got gravity and capillary action. Water is a
[31:21.200 --> 31:26.880]  polar molecule. It's why we've got life. It's because it's a polar molecule and has a very
[31:26.880 --> 31:36.560]  strong affinity for any solid surface. Gravity of water is going to take a long time to build up to
[31:36.560 --> 31:43.840]  where it's heavy enough to drag that next water molecule down. What we see happening is anytime
[31:43.840 --> 31:49.760]  you have two surfaces coming together, you get a perched water table. It's really easy to demonstrate.
[31:49.760 --> 31:56.800]  You can put some glass panes together and put whatever substrates you want in, drop water in
[31:56.800 --> 32:04.640]  from the top, and it happens every single time. It goes against my intuitive thought process.
[32:05.440 --> 32:11.600]  I was blown away. I was like, no, no way. Then when they showed me the science, I was like,
[32:11.600 --> 32:16.560]  holy crap, look at that. They're like, yeah, the capillary action is forcing it to spread out on
[32:16.560 --> 32:22.480]  that layer and you get a perched water table. That type of layering, all you're doing is turning
[32:22.480 --> 32:30.320]  your 30-gallon pot into a 15-gallon pot. Just use a 15-gallon pot if that's what you want to do
[32:31.440 --> 32:37.520]  and get really good at your watering. That's why people do it, because they overwater. That's the
[32:37.520 --> 32:42.400]  tendency. Go to anybody's house, how do they kill their house plants? Bromeliads, aeroids, whatever.
[32:42.800 --> 32:48.960]  It's all, they overwater them. House plants grow so slowly, they want to touch it every day.
[32:48.960 --> 32:55.840]  Leave it alone. When I'm teaching people to water, I make them do pot lifts. If it's beds,
[32:55.840 --> 33:02.960]  I make them put their hands in the soil. Unless you're working with a tensiometer
[33:02.960 --> 33:09.520]  and something like a blue mat system, you have to use your physical senses to determine that.
[33:09.600 --> 33:19.200]  With the layering and the drainage layers and that kind of stuff, the science just proves
[33:19.200 --> 33:24.560]  again and again and again that that doesn't. I can send you 10 white papers right now that
[33:24.560 --> 33:31.920]  will, I can send you a bunch of experiments that you can watch yourself. I'm always telling people,
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.280]  if you can prove it, I'd love to see it, because I've got all this data and all these reports that
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.240]  prove otherwise. Then the other thing about horizontal,
[33:43.520 --> 33:47.440]  where people are, and I know that this is not everybody's biomimicry process,
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.000]  but there are people who layer different nutrients or different substrate layers.
[33:54.240 --> 34:01.920]  One, if you go, how deep do roots go in soil, native soil? They're not getting down to the
[34:01.920 --> 34:08.640]  dinosaur level. They're not getting down there. Maybe three feet, unless you've got,
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.240]  there's certain crops with good soil, 16, 20, 30 feet. Yeah. But that's an exception. We all
[34:14.240 --> 34:26.240]  know that's an exception. Roots don't grow in layers. Plants don't need nitrogen on Tuesday
[34:26.320 --> 34:33.520]  and phosphorus on Wednesday. They need it all. They need sufficiency at all times. Otherwise,
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.520]  you have to start talking limiting factors within your nutrients and whatever's not available is
[34:37.520 --> 34:44.560]  what's going to pump the brakes on your plant. For me, I provide a cohesive environment
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.520]  with our soil. It's a uniform environment, but all the phosphorus, all the nitrate to get out the
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.280]  gate, all those nutrients are there. The biology's there. That's what the plant wants.
[34:57.280 --> 35:04.800]  Why would I hide, like what was it, the Rev's book with the spikes? Why would I put a concentrated
[35:04.800 --> 35:14.000]  spike over here when my plant's over here? We're again, trying to do better than nature. We're
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.240]  spoon feeding, we're babying these plants. We want to treat them really well. I'm not going to hold
[35:20.240 --> 35:26.240]  anything back from my plants. I'm not going to force my roots to go look for phosphorus. I'm
[35:27.440 --> 35:34.400]  a no-till guy. I do minimal tillage. I scratch my nutrients in. I don't want to dig down to the
[35:34.400 --> 35:43.120]  bottom of my beds and disturb the tilts of the soil. I definitely have some questions off of
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.400]  that, but Tad, I imagine you're probably going to answer a few of them in what you wanted to say.
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.720]  Did you have some thoughts on the horizontal systems as well, now that we've kind of
[35:53.680 --> 35:55.360]  explained the perch water table?
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.120]  I mean, I think people should just go on YouTube and look up what a perch water table is so you
[36:01.120 --> 36:07.760]  can see for yourself. That whole idea of any two layers that are dissimilar, whatever order they're
[36:07.760 --> 36:14.640]  in, however they are, will cause water to stop moving. It will cause water to move horizontally
[36:14.640 --> 36:22.080]  instead of vertically until it's able to break that tension and the gravity can overcome the
[36:22.080 --> 36:29.920]  capillary action. So yeah, it's a real thing. In terms of layering from a horizontal perspective,
[36:31.520 --> 36:38.640]  I think you can absolutely do it, but we want to talk about best practice or what's optimal
[36:38.640 --> 36:48.560]  for growing. We don't see this happening in landscape design. We don't see it in horticulture.
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.440]  We don't see it in agriculture. Everyone there is trying to create the best physical properties
[36:53.440 --> 37:01.280]  that we can for plant health as deep as we can intentionally. The reason why is just because of
[37:01.280 --> 37:05.760]  the basic properties of plant physiology. We don't want to make the plant have to work harder to get
[37:05.760 --> 37:12.000]  through these different layers. That's why when I transplant a plant outside, I'm going to make
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.840]  sure that I mix in some of the native soil so that that layer between the plant itself and the native
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.000]  soil is not distinct so that the roots can actually push out through it. We want to make everything
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.880]  easier for the plant. So those are some of the reasons why I choose not to do that. I've seen
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.880]  examples of horizon. I've watched some of the videos on folks that are promoting the horizon
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.440]  system. I think the reason it works is because those lower layers that they're putting in that
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.960]  are like clay and rock and mineral are just basically raising the layer level of that pot.
[37:46.960 --> 37:50.800]  So if you're one of those people that's got underwaters, you're probably getting some benefit
[37:50.800 --> 37:56.240]  from it because that water is taking longer to drain down. But do I think the roots are making
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.080]  it down there and that you're actually getting mineral content from what's down there? No, not
[38:02.080 --> 38:09.520]  in the cycle that we have with cannabis. That's a process of weathering that takes years. When we
[38:09.520 --> 38:17.200]  talk about layers geologically, we're talking decades, millennia, much longer periods of time
[38:17.200 --> 38:23.600]  for that erosion and weathering to occur. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, but I was just going
[38:23.600 --> 38:30.240]  to say that when Tad said, if you look at traditional agriculture or conventional
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.360]  agriculture, you don't see these practices. And that's one thing I would like to see
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.640]  cannabis growers doing is, we've had what, 90 years of prohibition trying to figure out
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.800]  ourselves in the quiet, in the dark. You couldn't talk to anybody. You couldn't even take notes
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.200]  because what it's, God forbid, somebody found your notebook, you'd go, you get 30 years.
[38:54.080 --> 39:01.600]  And so it was real, it was terrifying. And so you couldn't share. And so now, so we relied on
[39:04.720 --> 39:12.640]  what your buddy told you. And I'm very excited to see some people with some really strong
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.360]  agricultural backgrounds come into cannabis. And I would like to challenge, maybe isn't the
[39:19.360 --> 39:26.560]  right word, but encourage growers when you have a problem, a forum shouldn't be your first
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.040]  reach. Go and see what traditional ag says about your situation. Because we've been doing corn for
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.600]  a minute. We've been doing soybeans for a minute. And every state's going to have an agricultural
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.760]  extension as well. You just need to find your university and get in touch with those people.
[39:43.760 --> 39:52.240]  Yeah. I've abused my local, they know me when I'm going to show up. But at this point,
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.240]  they asked me to come talk to other growers, because they don't want to see farmers failing.
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.360]  No, no. Then they're a great resource too. If you are an outdoor farmer, gardener,
[40:03.360 --> 40:07.680]  insect pressure is what to expect. All of that, that's their job.
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.720]  Yeah. They'll tell you when it's coming. And then one more thing on the layering,
[40:13.600 --> 40:23.360]  when it comes to scale, would you rather fill a pot with one substrate, be done,
[40:23.360 --> 40:27.840]  or do you want to do layers? I don't want to pay somebody to do layers. And again,
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.720]  it comes back to, do I see a bump from that? I don't see increased production. I don't see
[40:32.720 --> 40:39.520]  improved quality versus a 10 inch bed. And so for me, it always comes back to margins.
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.240]  Did it? Did it improve it? And whether it's a touch or a purchase, I had to pay for it.
[40:46.240 --> 40:51.760]  And so if it doesn't help, I'm not doing it. And that's good. I'm glad you guys kind of
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.320]  explain it that way. If I'm hearing it right, it's more of a static tension between the two layers,
[40:56.320 --> 41:05.760]  because I face value. If I had some sand and maybe a little bit of silt and then some rocks
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.000]  or pebbles at the bottom, it would sound like water would just go straight through that.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.920]  Exclusively. Yeah. So if you-
[41:11.920 --> 41:13.520]  But that's not the case.
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.520]  If you blend those layers a little bit, it absolutely will. But if those layers are distinct,
[41:18.160 --> 41:19.760]  then the water will move.
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.000]  And like you said, same reason you break up the soil when you plant a tree.
[41:24.400 --> 41:24.960]  Okay.
[41:24.960 --> 41:27.920]  You don't want a distinct layer.
[41:28.480 --> 41:34.400]  Light bulb moment. That kind of makes sense. Again, because it's easier to push an object
[41:34.400 --> 41:40.160]  that's already in motion versus starting it because there's that static tension.
[41:40.160 --> 41:47.520]  Well, it's the split between capillary and gravity. And that's what makes it an intuitive
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.600]  problem. Because when you have a glass and you fill it with water, you watch it fill from the
[41:51.600 --> 41:57.360]  bottom. And so that's how we think about a pot. And a pot fills from the top down. It doesn't
[41:57.360 --> 42:02.160]  fill from the bottom. And so you've got gravity trying to get it to the bottom. You've got
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.920]  capillary action holding it up top.
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.520]  Okay. Well, that is something that I'm going to go back and watch just to make sure I understand
[42:11.520 --> 42:16.480]  it a little bit more. But I do appreciate you guys taking some time on that one. I do kind of
[42:16.560 --> 42:22.320]  want to bring up some other topics that we had here. There's a lot earlier we're talking kind
[42:22.320 --> 42:29.520]  of efficiency and things on scale, inputs, all of that. Frass, insect frass. That's something
[42:29.520 --> 42:38.880]  that I hear a lot about. And it's meant to elicit a reaction from the plant. And that is why a lot
[42:38.880 --> 42:44.000]  of people are using that. So what can you tell us about insect frass or maybe how that is or isn't
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.040]  used at scale?
[42:47.200 --> 42:56.800]  Yeah, I'll take this one. So insect frass is essentially insect poop. It's a manure created
[42:56.800 --> 43:04.160]  by rearing of insects. We're seeing black soldier fly, mealworm are the two I'm most familiar with.
[43:05.600 --> 43:11.920]  But I've heard of cricket, you know, variety of other insect frass products. The concept behind
[43:12.640 --> 43:19.440]  in terms of the benefits of it is that you're going to get beneficial microorganisms from that
[43:19.440 --> 43:26.320]  manure like any other manure. But this is insect in this case, you're also going to get some
[43:26.320 --> 43:32.640]  chitin from the insects themselves, which works with the chitinase pathway, this idea that you're
[43:32.640 --> 43:38.880]  going to get some systemic acquired resistance to the plants can be less susceptible to insects and
[43:38.880 --> 43:50.400]  diseases. Now, is this proven out? No, and I think I think it's a great security blanket. I
[43:50.400 --> 43:56.000]  love insect frass. I think it's a very sustainable product, it can be sourced very affordably and
[43:56.000 --> 44:03.200]  locally. So we're not shipping stuff from you know, from China or overseas. One thing I did
[44:03.200 --> 44:09.200]  hear on one of the podcasts on here was well, basically someone messaged me and said, Hey,
[44:09.200 --> 44:13.040]  I heard on this and they sent me the exact time slot that insect frass goes bad if you don't use
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.760]  it right away, it has to be fresh. So I reached out to a person that I'd interviewed, they have
[44:17.760 --> 44:24.000]  the largest mealworm production in the United States. And then it was an entomologist who'd
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.960]  done her research on frass, essentially. And they said, she said, actually, it gets better over time.
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.040]  And then I was talking with Suzanne Lane Wright Evans, the mug lady about it. And she's like,
[44:35.040 --> 44:38.800]  yeah, it's like any other manure over time, the biology actually improves.
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.880]  If it's if it's managed and handled appropriately. So you don't have to use it right away. It's not
[44:44.880 --> 44:51.040]  going to go bad on you. microbes are very resilient. And yeah, a lot of the research
[44:51.040 --> 44:57.520]  around it is quite promising. But do we do we know exactly what sort of outcomes and benefits we can
[44:57.520 --> 45:03.760]  get from it? Not really. I use it in my soil mixes. I think it's awesome. I highly recommend
[45:03.760 --> 45:12.800]  it. It's also got a very good balance NPK ratio, which is nice. But I wouldn't say if I put insect
[45:12.800 --> 45:17.840]  frass in my soil or on my plant, I'm not going to get pests. So that's kind of where I want to just
[45:17.840 --> 45:22.640]  draw the line for people when I'm talking about some of these potential benefits. Yeah, there's
[45:22.640 --> 45:29.920]  best practices, but there's no there's no plant and there's no SOP that's bulletproof. There's
[45:29.920 --> 45:34.240]  there's a rust. There's a rust that might out there with your name on it. Just just wait.
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.240]  And, you know, so we want to do best practices. But, you know, we don't want people to have a
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.400]  false assurance that if you, you know, like compost tea, if you spray that on your plant,
[45:45.360 --> 45:51.840]  it's good for your plant. Theoretically. Yeah. Great. Is it going to keep you from getting
[45:51.840 --> 45:57.360]  fungal pathogens? It could potentially outcompete them. But in Washington State, no,
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.800]  it's going to get to you, buddy. You know, so there's there's best practices and better practices.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.960]  And that's one point that you kind of bring up, too, which I love and need to remind myself to.
[46:09.120 --> 46:13.040]  A lot of people are in different environments. A lot of people have different conditions. And
[46:13.040 --> 46:18.400]  that's why a lot of times the answer is it depends. But it depends only applies if there's
[46:18.400 --> 46:24.480]  a solid foundation to what we're talking about. So sounds like FRAS does have, you know, kind of
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.600]  the leg to stand on as far as beneficial, but maybe not in the capacity, at least that it's
[46:29.600 --> 46:35.520]  being pushed or the fact that, you know, the point that you kind of brought up is, you know,
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.320]  you got to use it right away. But, yeah, you know, manure does kind of tend to get better with age.
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.480]  It's just little, little manures. And keep in mind, too, what's the insect that's doing the
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.360]  pooping? You know, how much of the insect carcasses are in the FRAS itself, along with the poop?
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.400]  What was that insect fed originally? All of these things are going to influence
[46:58.400 --> 47:04.560]  the biological properties of the final FRAS. So, you know, I think that's a really good point.
[47:05.360 --> 47:09.920]  So it's more complicated. Unfortunately, it's more complicated than we want it to be. We want
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.000]  to just be able to say, if I use this, am I going to get disease resistance? And nature just doesn't
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.680]  work that way. So many variables. Yeah. And in theory, it makes sense. You know, you've got
[47:19.680 --> 47:26.000]  chitin, you've got chitinase. The plants communicate with soil, with the microbes. And so they,
[47:27.120 --> 47:32.560]  you know, theoretically, the plant sees an attack from that, you know, and so puts up its immune
[47:32.560 --> 47:40.480]  system. And so, yeah, that sounds fantastic. But, you know, I like it for the MPK as much as
[47:40.480 --> 47:47.200]  anything. I think it's just a great, because I do a lot of, you know, soil nerding, soil analysis
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.840]  for KISS and for growers. And they send me their soil reports and we go through them. And,
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.280]  you know, FRAS can be a really nice answer for some people.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.480]  Well, we kind of touched on insects there and we kind of touched on fungus. And I see Smiley's
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.040]  garden in chat and you guys might not know this, but this is an inside joke to him because he's
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.400]  kind of a living soil guy. And I always bug him. I'm like, well, if you have living soil,
[48:12.400 --> 48:19.040]  say hello to fungus gnats, because that's what causes it. Which is a joke, but maybe serious.
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.640]  Have you guys dealt with that or have any thoughts kind of about fungus gnats and living
[48:25.200 --> 48:32.800]  soil? Never heard of them. Never heard of them. Yeah. It's endemic. It's part of living soil.
[48:32.800 --> 48:40.640]  We've got this rich, you know, organic matter. It's wet and it's a dinner bell for fungus gnats.
[48:40.640 --> 48:47.840]  You know, I'm on the East Coast. We have fungus gnats and shore fly. And, you know, we keep a
[48:48.960 --> 48:53.200]  certain moisture level all the way to the top. We don't let our top layers dry out because we
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.800]  want to keep everything alive, you know, vital. And so you're going to get fungus gnats. And so
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.680]  there's really simple SOPs to keep them under control, though. You know, start with scouting.
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.960]  You know, you want to have your sticky cards up so that you can know if you've got a problem
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.600]  before you, you know, if you wait till you walk in and there's clouds wafting up, you've waited
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.720]  too long, you know, so scout, check your cards. And if you, you know, if you have a problem or
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.880]  if you just want to be proactive and not have a fungus gnat issue, you can get some SF nematodes
[49:27.840 --> 49:35.680]  into your soil and they will pretty effectively control, you know, I've never seen a fungus gnat
[49:35.680 --> 49:44.800]  outbreak that Steinernema feltiae could not get under control, you know. Yeah. Or BTI. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:45.120 --> 49:52.400]  Mosquito bits, either of those will work. It's real easy. Anytime you have a compost fraction,
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.440]  you have higher organic matter. And because we have a lot of we don't want to sterilize our
[49:57.440 --> 50:00.880]  soil because there's a lot of beneficial microorganisms in there that are cycling
[50:00.880 --> 50:05.040]  nutrients. And we can talk about all that, too, because they're the big driver when it
[50:05.040 --> 50:11.920]  comes to nutrient availability in organic soils. Unfortunately, there's not a way to just remove
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.000]  the fungus gnats unless you want to start applying nematodes and some of these other things.
[50:17.200 --> 50:22.960]  That being said, you know, if you have a good, well-made compost, I don't typically see a lot of
[50:22.960 --> 50:29.520]  fungus gnats. Like just working with our soils on occasion, we'll have a grower reach out and say,
[50:29.520 --> 50:32.480]  you know, I found some fungus gnats in the soil. But for most of the year,
[50:33.840 --> 50:40.240]  usually it's not really an issue. Okay. Well, that's good. You hear that, Smiley?
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.920]  They are living. No, I won't. I won't do you like that.
[50:48.880 --> 50:55.600]  Okay. So that exists. And you did mention, too, kind of nutrient cycling or maybe even just like
[50:55.600 --> 51:02.640]  nutrient layering. Was that something that you guys wanted to touch on at all? You kind of said
[51:02.640 --> 51:09.360]  it a little bit when we were talking horizontals, just why build a seven layer burrito when you can
[51:09.360 --> 51:14.160]  mix it all into a salad. Right. Get a little bit in every bite.
[51:15.680 --> 51:21.520]  I can touch on that. Can I say one thing about what we were just talking about before we switch
[51:21.520 --> 51:27.920]  over? Is that when folks, you know, because a lot of folks don't start off as organic. It's
[51:27.920 --> 51:37.760]  challenging. You know, most folks start off with rock wool and salts and that's awesome. Grow,
[51:37.760 --> 51:44.400]  get growing, man. Whoever you are, wherever you are, start yesterday. And however you do it is
[51:44.400 --> 51:49.440]  awesome. You know, we're not dogmatic. We're more about sustainability. We're all organic growers,
[51:49.440 --> 51:58.480]  but we're about sustainability. And there's an art and a science to taking care of that soil.
[51:59.120 --> 52:04.960]  And so when people make that move over to organics, if you want to let us know,
[52:05.680 --> 52:10.800]  we can walk you through how do you, how do you keep your biology? How do you, how do you out
[52:10.800 --> 52:17.280]  compete the bad guys, biology and pests? Because that's a part of soil that you have to manage.
[52:17.280 --> 52:23.840]  You know, you can't just, you know, run right. You know, I've had calls from people who were like,
[52:23.840 --> 52:27.920]  you know, this round just doesn't seem to be as good as the last one. I was like, okay, well,
[52:27.920 --> 52:32.480]  you know, what did you amend with last time? We didn't amend. I'm like, oh, okay. Well,
[52:32.480 --> 52:36.480]  how many rounds? Oh, we've had like 10 rounds. And I'm like, okay, you're out of gas. It's time
[52:36.480 --> 52:42.400]  to get your way out of gas, you know? And so that's, that's a service that I'm proud that KISS
[52:42.400 --> 52:50.400]  provides, you know, cause it's very hard to dial in at organic SOP. And we're more than happy to
[52:50.400 --> 52:56.000]  just walk people through it, you know, because we want them to, you know, if you use KISS soil,
[52:56.000 --> 53:01.200]  we want you to be successful with it. So we're going to be there to answer your questions and,
[53:01.600 --> 53:07.360]  you know, give you a good leg up on, you know, this is, this is what you want to do. And,
[53:07.360 --> 53:13.120]  and, you know, and even if it's just talking points, it gets people thinking about, you know,
[53:13.120 --> 53:18.080]  the ecosystem of their soil. You know, why do you want a big bed as opposed to a one gallon pot?
[53:18.080 --> 53:22.960]  You need that bigger ecosystem for the cycling, for the biology, just to hold that nutrient level.
[53:22.960 --> 53:26.240]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani And in the bigger picture too, a lot of us,
[53:26.640 --> 53:32.000]  included, you know, on this channel and watching now, we've taken a lot of this knowledge that
[53:32.000 --> 53:37.920]  about the soil food web, you know, the microbes and all of this and applied it to our own health,
[53:38.880 --> 53:45.920]  which is coincidentally very similar. So I do love that aspect of it. But you also had
[53:45.920 --> 53:50.240]  wanted to say something on this one, Tad? Dr. Tad Sinclair
[53:50.240 --> 53:55.360]  Well, I want to talk about container size. And I want to talk about soil food web. But before we
[53:55.360 --> 53:58.400]  do, you mentioned you mentioned nutrient layering. So I do want to touch on that.
[54:00.720 --> 54:06.720]  There's a few different ways you can re you can reamend the soil. Now, if you are not
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.920]  going to transplant your plant, and so you start from seed, I could I could see the argument for
[54:13.920 --> 54:19.920]  putting a lower fertility soil mix, it's a little more porous right around that initial plant and
[54:19.920 --> 54:27.040]  then letting it grow into a media that contains more nutrients because seeds and tiny plants just
[54:27.040 --> 54:35.280]  don't, they don't really need or want that level of fertility to EC is too high. But there's a lot
[54:35.280 --> 54:39.520]  of reasons to benefit that there's a lot of reasons to transplant, there's a lot of benefits to it.
[54:40.560 --> 54:49.280]  And layering really, getting back to that original question, I don't think is the most optimal way of
[54:49.280 --> 54:56.000]  fertilizing our plants. Now, when we talk about top dressing, or how do we, you know, how do we
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.560]  amend during each cycle, there's a lot of different approaches on this. And I'd love to see more
[55:00.560 --> 55:07.120]  research because, for me, I like to mix those nutrients back into the bed. And if you want to
[55:07.120 --> 55:13.040]  read out a blog post on our website talking about, you know, is no till really the best way to grow
[55:13.040 --> 55:20.160]  indoors, because I want to get those nutrients right back into the soil mix in the rhizosphere
[55:20.160 --> 55:25.040]  as fast as possible, because the next cycle starting 24 hours later in my flowering bed,
[55:25.040 --> 55:29.440]  and I don't want to wait for those nutrients to work their way down through the soil profile.
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.440]  That being said, we have other growers or even Brandon, I think in his place, he just scratches
[55:35.440 --> 55:41.360]  it lightly into the first inch or so I tend to dig it, you know, more like six inches into the into
[55:41.360 --> 55:47.360]  the mix, I'm not probably disturbing the full profile. But this idea that we're killing off,
[55:49.360 --> 55:54.960]  you know, we're destroying soil structure, or we're killing off microbes, I think is vastly
[55:54.960 --> 56:00.080]  overstated. And this idea that we're tilling is also the wrong term, because we're not tilling,
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.720]  we're not taking a mechanical tiller and absolutely destroying all the soil structure,
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.600]  like we are outdoors, we're not risking erosion of our topsoil, because it's all blowing away in
[56:09.600 --> 56:13.920]  the wind, like we saw with the Great Dust Bowl, what we're doing is we're just getting the
[56:13.920 --> 56:20.080]  nutrients where we want them. So that's, again, this whole idea of biomimicry and leaning back
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.880]  to that. But you could absolutely do the same thing by top dressing if you just were, if you
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.200]  just had a dial. And again, we're talking about best practice here. You know, I know people that
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.880]  will say I top dress and it went well, that's awesome. You know, that's great. But I know a
[56:34.880 --> 56:38.000]  lot more people that top dress and then their plants didn't get the nutrients they needed
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.680]  when they needed them. So that's sort of my thoughts on it. I'm done.
[56:43.680 --> 56:47.360]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Well, you gotta get ahead with the top dressing.
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.160]  Dr. Tim Jackson Phosphorus is only gonna move what a half inch in your soil profile on its own.
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.720]  So you kind of got to get it down like two or three inches, you know, because that's where
[56:56.720 --> 57:03.360]  your roots are going to be starting. And so it's in we we've seen there's plenty of research to show
[57:04.240 --> 57:13.120]  that chlorinated water, deep till, you know, digging beds and that kind of stuff. There's a
[57:13.120 --> 57:22.720]  huge die off. But 48 hours later, the biology is back. And so it's so resilient, you know,
[57:22.720 --> 57:28.080]  and I don't want to say go abuse your beds. I baby my soils gold to me, you know, I baby it.
[57:28.880 --> 57:36.240]  I tell it stories, you know, I love it. But it's, but it's more resilient than than is stated,
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.280]  you know, widely. So, you know, I don't want people to panic, you know, you'll be okay.
[57:41.280 --> 57:45.040]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Can I add to that real quick, Chad?
[57:45.040 --> 57:45.600]  Dr. Tim Jackson Please.
[57:45.600 --> 57:47.760]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani So people have asked us like, Hey,
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.320]  you know, can I store the soil outside when it arrives or like through the winter if it freezes,
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.360]  we've had soil freeze just on its way to the East Coast before. It's totally fine. Like the soil is
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.600]  fine. Now if the water is leaching through that soil, removing nutrients, that's a whole nother
[58:01.600 --> 58:07.280]  story. But the biology is very, very resilient. It's designed to handle all of these fluctuations
[58:07.280 --> 58:12.240]  and changes. However, when it's going to be most happy and nutrient cycling is when we're, you
[58:12.240 --> 58:19.600]  know, 7880 degrees, you know, around 100 m bar in terms of the amount of water in there has the soil
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.800]  itself that you're using, it has good physical properties, and there's pockets of air and get gas
[58:24.800 --> 58:30.880]  exchange. Those are the things that really allow the microbes to really flourish. And those microbes
[58:30.880 --> 58:36.640]  are really key to this whole process. And I don't want to downplay that. I would like to say that
[58:36.640 --> 58:42.400]  we find that there are as we increase the size of our container, not only does it make our workflow
[58:42.400 --> 58:50.880]  easier, but it also allows us to it allows us it kind of corrects all the nutrient issues that a
[58:50.880 --> 58:56.160]  lot of people are having the plants able to overcome that just by having access to where
[58:56.160 --> 59:00.960]  root space is not a limiting factor of growth, where nutrition is not going to be a limiting
[59:00.960 --> 59:07.280]  factor growth, because there's more fertility that it can access in the soil. And lastly, having
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.400]  plants more than one plant in the same pot. And that could be another argument for, you know,
[59:12.400 --> 59:19.280]  potentially a cover crop. But what we do is we plant multiple cannabis plants in a larger bed.
[59:19.280 --> 59:25.440]  And we've actually done trials, which Dr. Bing, Ben Hagen, stated Goldie, where he planted
[59:26.720 --> 59:33.760]  multiple plants in the same beds, which is their normal way of growing versus plants in their own
[59:33.760 --> 59:39.040]  30 gallon pots. So the plant alone in that 30 gallon pot had more soil per plant than the ones
[59:39.040 --> 59:45.040]  in the beds. However, the ones in the beds all out yielded and outperformed that 30 those 30
[59:45.040 --> 59:52.320]  gallon pots. Because really, you know, there's a lot of stuff around like plant roots being able
[59:52.320 --> 59:59.680]  to interact with each other, you know, essentially trade nutrients, access further into that root
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:05.200]  space. Because a lot of the roots want to go laterally, at least with cannabis, we find that
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.680]  they've, you know, plant the plant wants to grow laterally under the ground. So all of these things,
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:16.640]  at least I can hypothesize are the reason why we found that that out yielded being in a pot,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.360]  but the larger the pot, the better results typically that you'll have and watering becomes
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.520]  less of a challenge. And just all around better results. And then we can reamend directly in that
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:33.120]  bed. So 24 to 36 hours later, we're bringing in our next flowering crop. So that bed, we don't
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.600]  have to move that soil out of we're in a pot. Not only is that soil going to shrink down because the
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.160]  organic matter is breaking down. It's also going to be a big old root ball in a lot of cases. So
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.360]  there's not as much soil to reamend. But then we have to take it out, reamend it at a higher rate,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.960]  and then bring it back in if we want to reuse the soil. So it's just a lot more work.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]  So sorry, I went off on a tangent, but
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:02.080]  No, it was it was a good one. We're talking 20 gallons. Do we have a minimum size that you want
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.520]  to see if someone's trying to, you know, like me and a four by four, what is the smallest
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.440]  container size I should consider doing a living soil in?
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.160]  An easy seed without having to feed it every week and treat it like, you know, the old system.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.760]  So I guess you could do anything in a solo cup. We've seen it. It's online.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.600]  Yeah, yeah, you can feed it. But, you know,
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.200]  it depends on your cultivar. It depends on your PPFD levels, you know, is there CO2 being added
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.760]  all those things if you're really pushing a plant a 10 gallon, maybe you might get away with it.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.080]  We put more fertility in our soils, I think than anyone else on the market based on other
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.920]  recipes I've seen online. We're putting almost 100 pounds of fertilizer essentially into each
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.840]  yard of soil. And we still will find people will run out of nutrients
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.640]  in a five or a seven if they're really pushing that plant. But as a general rule,
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:10.960]  seven gallon pot is what I'm doing. Just water. Yeah. And that's and that's for a short one week
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.880]  veg, eight week, you know, so if you're if you're going to run a four week veg and a 12 week flower,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.560]  you know, it's not going to make it, you know, without some some help, you know.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.760]  I'm all about bigger, the better, you know, like I, I love anything bigger than 12 gallons.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.400]  I prefer a 30 gallon or a raised bed, just because I just experientially,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.400]  I've just gotten the best results from those larger ecosystems. And like Tad was saying,
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:49.200]  with the multiple plantings, you know, there we go. One plant that's just not, not firing like
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.480]  it should. It's going to draft off the exudates of those other plants in that bed. You know,
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:00.960]  it's still calling for biology to free up nutrients, you know, so it's it's there's
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.880]  a really nice symbiotic relationship doing multiple plants, I think.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.000]  It's the same reason why outdoors, I want you to plant your plant in the ground if you can,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.200]  versus being in a container. That plant in the ground is going to outperform that container
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.880]  nine times out of 10, unless your soil is so lacking in fertility.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.560]  Yeah, we, we really want to just give the plant as much room for root growth as we can.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.840]  And there's a lot of, you know, mycorrhizal activity. That's one thing that,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.720]  you know, I've heard that you have to add it, have to add it. But at the same time,
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.320]  I've also heard that it really takes about 90 days or so, again, a lot of variables,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:51.600]  but to form like a meaningful functioning body really to get nutrients is, am I pulling that out
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.520]  of the air? Or is there a little bit of truth to building up that sort of network in a pot? Like,
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:03.120]  if I'm using it for 90 days, and then tossing it, that's not going to be too beneficial, do you
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.840]  think? Let me take this one. I'm going to tell you everything I know about trichoderma in the
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.920]  next two minutes, and it's going to basically end with I don't know. So when we talk about,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.960]  when we talk about mycorrhizal fungus, there's, there's basically three different types. There's
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.600]  endo, ecto, and arochoid. There's more, but those are the major ones we want to talk about.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  Arochoid mycorrhizae are specific to rhododendrons, azaleas, it's not going to do you any good,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.040]  blueberries, doesn't really apply to what we're doing. Ecto mycorrhizae, specific to conifers,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:41.040]  pine trees, things like that. Now you'll find ecto mycorrhizae in a lot of mycorrhizal inoculants
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.520]  because they're cheap. So you can look at this one say, Oh, I have a million spores in there.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.640]  Holy cow, that one's better. Most of the spores won't apply to cannabis, they won't apply to your
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.040]  fruit trees, they won't apply to tomatoes, which are all endo mycorrhizae. And when we talk about
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:01.520]  that, the main ones that we're talking about are Rhizophagus irregularis, which is also
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:07.600]  Glomus interradicis, which is also one other name that I'm blanking on all the exact same
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:16.000]  strata mycorrhizal fungus now, or species, sorry. That being said, there's also Glomus mossier.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.240]  There's a few others that are commercially produced right now. Desert Ecola is another one.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.920]  So you'll see some diversity there. Do we know which one works best with cannabis? No, the one
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.560]  that's most widely studies is that Rhizophagus irregularis. So the first thing is just knowing
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:41.120]  what you're getting. Now, can we trust the numbers on the label? Absolutely not. The ODA has shown
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.600]  Oregon Department of Ag did trials on this and they found that with microbial products, a lot of
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.760]  what you see on the label is not actually what's in the product. So you're kind of already screwed
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.960]  to start with there. Now, if you decide you want to use mycorrhizal fungus, it gets even more
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:03.040]  complicated because there's very few producers of the, I'll go with Rhizophagus irregularis,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.920]  because that's the most common name that we're seeing now in terms of nomenclature.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.880]  There's various producers of it, but there's not very many. RTI is one who makes mycos, Premier
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:20.000]  up in Canada. And the other one I know of is the mycos coming out of Israel. That's three,
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.960]  almost all the other ones that you see on the market are just people rebranding and remarketing
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:34.800]  one of those companies. Knowing all of that, when it comes down to viability, that's going to depend
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.320]  on how long the product's been on the shelf, how it's been stored, how it's been cared for.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.800]  All those things are determined what kind of spore count is actually in that package.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:51.120]  The one from Israel is going to be different than the one from RTI that's raised in Canada.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.080]  They're slightly different strains. So that can affect how well they work in terms of regards of
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.720]  drought resistance or phosphorus uptake or some of these other benefits. So it's complicated.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.680]  On top of that, I found that the carrier can vary between them, some of which are going to have
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.560]  higher heavy metals than others. That's a big deal too for a lot of us growers. And we can talk about
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.440]  heavy metals too. So again, low levels, but we're still adding to our heavy metal count in our soil
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.680]  potentially with things like pH up and down, mycorrhizal inoculates, things that you think
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.480]  of as being rather innocuous when it comes to heavy metals. So then lastly, infection.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.760]  This is where it gets tricky. So there was one paper out of Florida that said that trichoderma
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.680]  hazirinium, I can never pronounce that word, inhibited mycorrhizal infection,
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.920]  which would make sense. Trichoderma is a pretty aggressive microbe. You can see where that could
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.520]  have an antagonistic effect on infection rates with mycorrhizal. They also found that high
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.840]  phosphorus limited mycorrhizal infection. And that's absolutely been proven.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.920]  If a plant is getting sufficient phosphorus in its soil, it's like, why the heck do I need this
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:14.160]  fungus? I'm not going to do this trade because it's costing me. I can get my pee for free. So
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.640]  that's something that's absolutely the case and that's available phosphorus. So that's something
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:26.800]  to consider too. Some research actually shows that trichoderma can be beneficial or symbiotic
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:34.160]  now with mycorrhizal fungus. So again, that's going to vary. And I've talked to mycologists
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.760]  about this and I've heard various answers. So that's where it gets very confusing to me.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:45.200]  I did an awesome interview with Dr. Yoram Kipulnik, who actually developed the product
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:52.080]  mycos in Israel. He was one of the original researchers on it. That is probably the most
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.320]  I've ever learned and the most excited I've ever been about mycorrhizal fungus after interviewing
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:04.160]  him. I can't recommend it enough. He was awesome. So I was on the mycorrhizal train. I was fully
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.480]  on board. I'm like, this stuff is the most amazing thing ever. I did a recent interview with, I think
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:18.720]  it was my most recent one with Dr. Monique. I'm blanking on her last name right now. But basically,
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.400]  she said that they started some trials and found that they didn't get infection on the plants when
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.040]  they actually started looking and staining the roots. They weren't finding infection with cannabis,
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:36.080]  which is really interesting. Supposedly, infection can occur in as little as seven to ten days
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.240]  in optimal conditions. And in theory, if you apply it, because it's a root symbiont, it should be a
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.040]  one-time application directly to the roots. So we're not mixing it in teas. We're not sprinkling
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:52.640]  it over the surface because it's not moving through. It's attached to whatever the carrier is.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.480]  It's not moving through the soil. And I can't remember where I read this, but it's something
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:01.040]  like if it was more than like three or five millimeters from a root tip and didn't come
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.280]  in contact with that root tip, then essentially it's going to stay dormant in the life of the plant.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.680]  So what we want is a meat infection. So we want to put on, if we're going to use mycorrhizal
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.600]  fungus in terms of best practice, you want to apply it directly to the root of the plant
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.360]  right away. So cloning stage, coating the seeds, that's when I would use it. And in theory,
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.720]  it's going to grow with the plant. So I don't need to reapply it every transplant stage.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.400]  However, the other thing to look at, and the last thing I'm going to say on this is microbial
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:37.680]  persistence. How quickly are those spores, and what are the quantity of spores that are available
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.840]  or propagules, little pieces of hyphae, for the next crop that's going in? And how quickly am I
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.400]  going to get infection on that crop if say I don't inoculate that crop? And that's where I think it
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.880]  gets really murky. Because for me, if I'm going to use mycorrhizal fungus, I'm going to do a one
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.080]  time application directly to the roots early in the plant's life. And I'm not going to assume that
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.240]  my media, if I'm reusing it, has sufficient mycorrhizal levels to get me that kind of inoculation.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:14.640]  So that's really all I can say. So do I know? No. I think people are going to have varied results.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.960]  And I think it's going to vary by cultivar and environment and the way you water and all of
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.640]  these things. I absolutely think it's one of those things like once you have your soil dialed in,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.800]  it's one of the first things I'm like, hey, let's add this. And let's let's document how well,
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.760]  you know, what kind of results you get, like have a control and see if you notice, you know,
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.680]  a statistically significant increase in plant health or yield to where we want to keep doing
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.480]  this cycle after cycle. Because it's relatively inexpensive. And that's something that I want to
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.160]  look at. And the very last thing I know, I already said this, but the last thing I want to tell
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.520]  people is just because it says mycorrhizal on the label with a fertilizer or a soil mix, I can
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.520]  guarantee you unless it's a specific mycorrhizal inoculant, the amount of propagules or spores
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.280]  that they're putting into that product is not going to be sufficient to actually get any sort
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.880]  of result. So don't count on that. Actually buy a specific mycorrhizal product if you want to use
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:12.000]  mycorrhizal fungus and done. Okay. I like the when you were wrapping that up, you said something
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:23.840]  that was great and people need the control. And so start off with a simple, straightforward SOP.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.400]  And then if you want to try something, cover cropping, I don't care what it is. If you want
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.920]  to try something, now you've got a database, you know, a data set that says I did X, Y, and Z,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.960]  simple SOP. It cost me this much. This was my return. Now you're doing science. Now you're
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.240]  applied science. You're going to try something and you're going to see if that cost was worth
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.600]  the expense. And now you're a professional agronomist, you know, like you're-
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.720]  You tricked me.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.480]  One thing I want to add, if you're growing giant pumpkins or squash, those guys apply it at every
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.320]  node because they'll get rooting along all their secondary vines. And that to me makes sense because
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.520]  you have new roots starting growing out of, you know, out of that secondary vine. So if you wanted
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.440]  to apply it there, I could see the argument behind that. But try, you know, don't take my word for it.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.680]  Like try some plants where you don't apply any mycorrhizal fungus, try ones where you apply it
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.360]  at every transplant stage and try some where you just do it right at the beginning and see what
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.640]  your results are. That's really the best way.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.960]  It's a good way to do it. And then like you said too, you know, you'd recommend it early in the
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:50.800]  life stages of the cannabis plant. So imagine that nodal space is the early roots of the pumpkin.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:57.520]  Early roots of the pumpkins. And those are- I want to try growing a dramatic pumpkin.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.640]  Dramatic pum- I call it dramatic because they add pounds per day. That's dramatic, man.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.120]  Yeah, you can watch them grow. It's wild.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.960]  Let me know. I got some buddies. I can get you some genetics if you ever want to do it.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.880]  Nice. Oh, I want to try that. I do. Getting my garden made as we speak.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:23.360]  Well, you're giving up pretty much like a 30 by 30 piece of land for one plant, one
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:31.440]  fruit that you're not going to eat. So I've done it. It's fun. Kids love it. I wish I had a photo
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:40.160]  of my- ours. We were in the rookie stage. We only got to like 720 some pounds. If you're not over
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:46.560]  a thousand pounds, like it's like, why are you even doing this? Yeah. And that's from seed in
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:54.640]  like three months. It's pretty fun. It's insane. Just, okay. Yeah. The growth on it. I won't
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.920]  sidetrack too much because I see, you know, we're already sneaking up on the hour and a half. And I
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.800]  know I said I wouldn't keep you guys any longer than that. So, you know, we got about 15 minutes
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.160]  and just a couple more things I wanted to touch on real quick. You kind of mentioned some of the
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:20.720]  limiting factors early on, but did you want to maybe let people know some of the more common
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:27.120]  limiting factors in a living soil or an organic approach? Some things that you might not expect
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:34.640]  to be a limiting factor? Brandon, can I let you answer that question, but can I say something
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.360]  right before? Yeah. I, this is something that I probably say too much, but as a grower, I think
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:50.480]  you really need to be a detective. And the thing I find is like, when I, when I walk into a grow room,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.800]  what I want to figure out is like you said, that limiting factor of growth. And people
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.280]  immediately usually go to fertilizer. They go to light, they go to soil, and it could be any of
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.800]  those things. But you really, as a detective, you have to know more. And that's why a photo of a
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.280]  plant that doesn't look healthy is not enough information to know what's going on and make a
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.880]  diagnosis. It could be a nutrient deficiency because you're under or over watering. And it's
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.120]  not because that soil doesn't have the fertility. It's just because it's not able to access this
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:25.520]  because of your watering practices. So you really have to look at all those variables. You have to
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.400]  look at your environment, what your VPD levels are, and you have to look at your, your watering,
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:37.280]  your, your nutrients, your lighting levels, all of those things play a role. So Brandon,
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.560]  do you want to talk about what some of the more common ones are in living soils in terms of,
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:49.120]  from a nutrient perspective, if it is, that is indeed the issue? Yeah, sure. So like Ted said,
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.200]  first and foremost, you got to put the detective hat on. And you know, when you walk in to a grow,
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.720]  you know, like we did the dichotomous key that is, you know, hopefully helping people diagnose
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.240]  nutrient and pest or pathogen issues. And so you walk into a room and you're looking for patterns,
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:14.160]  you know, first and foremost, do you see a pattern in this huge canopy? Is it a good pattern? Is it
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:21.120]  a bad pattern? And then, so, you know, if it's something that leads you to the conclusion that
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:29.280]  you've got a nutrient issue, then you've got options, you can visually diagnose it. And you
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:37.360]  know, and I think that most growers that have got, you know, not even like 10 years under your belt,
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:44.640]  like you, you can, you should be able to walk into a room and tell what that nutrient deficiency
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:53.280]  issue is. Yeah. Okay, cool. And so once you've determined that you've got a nutrient issue,
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:18:02.000]  either by soil test or visually, then there's amendment recommendations, recipes. There's
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.160]  certain things that we see that are in high demand, like people who really blow out their PPFD,
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:17.760]  really, really high, you know, 1200 and above, not burning gas, they run out of magnesium,
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.680]  you know, week three, like it's something that we just see, you know. But when you see,
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.640]  like Tad said, when you, when you know that you've got a deficiency, the reason I love a soil report
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.600]  is because the soil report just tells me immediately, like a blood report would for you,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.520]  or me or Tad or whatever, it tells you what's there. And so if I've got a phosphorus deficiency,
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.720]  it's visible in the plant or nitrogen or, you know, any limiting factor nutrient,
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:54.480]  any of the 17 essential, if one of those is missing, now you have to decide, is it in the soil?
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.240]  Soil test is the only way you're going to know that for sure. And then if it's in the soil,
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.560]  now you've got to do the detective work of why is it not getting into the plant? You know,
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.840]  is it calcium and you're too humid? And so your transpiration rates are bad, you know, so that's
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.640]  environment. It has nothing to do with the amount of calcium in the soil, you know, iron, if it's
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:22.560]  not chelated, if your pH is out of whack, you're not getting any iron in that plant. And so it's
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.000]  one thing to know you have a deficiency and then it's another step, you know, to confidently say,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.720]  hey, this is our issue. And then it's another step to find out why it's not getting into the plant.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:38.000]  It could be physiological. You know, I think most people think nutrients, you know, what's,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.320]  what's the cure more water and more, more cow mag on it. It'll fix it, you know, and that's not the
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.240]  right approach. You know, the right approach is to figure out what the limiting factor is
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:54.880]  and then find out why it's not getting into the plant. And a lot of the time it's environmental,
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.320]  you know, the CO2 levels are wrong. The light, the PPFD is wrong. The air exchange is wrong.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:09.360]  The VPD is wrong. You're not driving transpiration. You know, you've got a calcium deficiency in a
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.720]  plant and there's plenty of calcium in the soil. So what's the first thing you think? Okay.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:20.560]  Transpiration. So you check the relative, you know, check your VPD coefficient, see where you are.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:27.200]  Looks good. Okay. Oh, it's that crappy fan that's putting too many CFUs across that leaf
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.440]  and that big calcium molecule can't get in there. So it could be all kinds of things, you know? And
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:38.080]  so there's, there's, you know, like people said, you know, I, I answer a lot of the calls
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:45.200]  and product support at KISS. And I think, you know, I think I hurt people's feelings sometimes
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.000]  because they'll call and say, Hey, I've got this issue. And I'm like, okay, cool. I've got 500
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.360]  questions for you, you know, but that's how you're going to determine, you know, what that limiting
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.480]  factor is. You have to investigate them all. And so, you know, as somebody that deals with soil
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:09.280]  chemistry and nutrient loads, I can't help, but my brain normally goes to nutrients first and foremost.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:16.080]  But, you know, I have to keep that scientific thought process, pest and pathogen, nutrients.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.840]  Okay. It's not pest and pathogen, it's nutrients. What's the nutrient? Now I got to find out why
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.960]  it's not getting into the plant. And each element has a different hurdle, you know, like you can see,
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:33.200]  you know, like get low on, on magnesium and because it's carrying phosphorus into the plant,
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.200]  now you've got a phosphorus deficiency. You've got plenty of phosphorus in the soil, you know,
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.040]  phosphorus is so hard to make available. It's not going to just take off on you, you know,
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:47.440]  not an organic growing. And so that's, that's where the real nuances come in, I think, you know,
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:55.040]  and, and that, and the only way to get that is a lot of experience. You know, I've killed
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.840]  thousands of plants, you know, I always highly encourage somebody to try to kill a plant. You
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.600]  know, if they've got a plant that's going down, you know, somebody will send me a picture of
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.560]  really bad fusarium or something. They're like, should I just chop it? I'm like, no, learn something,
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:13.760]  you know, go try to kill it, spray it with something, you know? And so, you know, make it a learning
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.880]  process. There's always got to be a, you know, a silver lining to any lesson that you learn,
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.080]  you know, but you have to put on that, you have to work with controls, you have to work with,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:29.120]  you don't have to, you can do whatever you want, but best practices, you know, you want controls,
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:36.480]  you want a basic strong SOP, you want to change one factor at a time. And that's, that's, you know,
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:42.400]  that's my process. But as far as the limiting factors with soil, that soil analysis tells you
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.600]  everything you need to know about what's available. And so if it's, if it's not in the soil,
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:52.240]  simple fix, you know, here's a target, here's what it's going to take to get there with this
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.000]  organic amendment, go at it, you know, but if it's in the soil, then, then we, you know,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.960]  we do video walkthroughs with people. You know, we had a guy with heavy metals, couldn't figure out
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:08.640]  what his was. I got on the phone with him one day and I said, just FaceTime me, walk me through your
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.120]  facility. He goes outside because the reception, you know, grow rooms are traditionally horrible.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.760]  Hear him fans and all that. So he goes outside to talk to me and I can see a farmer off in the
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.040]  distance growing dust. He's in a breadbasket state where they've been dropping lead arsenate for
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.920]  40 years, you know, every time the farmers across the street from him plow, he was getting dust
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.840]  into his facility. And that's why he was failing. You know, I saw a guy one time in the background
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.680]  dumping water from the dehumidifier into the reservoir. I was like, there's your heavy
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:52.960]  metals right there, buddy, you know? And so like it's each grow is, is very individual, you know,
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.600]  even among the same growers, you know, you can take a guy that's got, you know, multiple farms,
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.600]  they're all going to be different. And so, you know, get that basic SOP,
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.960]  detail it to your specific, like you said earlier, in your environment, you know,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:13.280]  are you hot and humid? Are you cold? Are you wet? Or, you know, dial it into your environment. And
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.800]  yeah, can I share this on the screen? I don't know if this is going to work here.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:27.280]  Yeah, it should be able to, there's either a present or a share button down there. If not,
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.600]  you can always send me the link to I'm able to put stuff up. Should be along the bottom bar where
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:42.160]  there was the settings. If you have, yeah. Oh, it's gonna make me quit out before I can do it.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.920]  Basically on our website, Brandon's created dichotomous key. If you go to kishorganics.com.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.360]  Yep. Let me actually let me pull up your site here. Sorry to catch you there. I'm going to
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.160]  pull it up. So, we'll walk through this for so everybody can walk through it with me later.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.240]  Okay. So, let me go stream. Okay. Drive, drive.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.360]  Go to learn. Oh, that's a horrible picture.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:15.920]  Go to blog. There you go. Now, if you scroll down one more,
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.400]  we're going to make this downloadable. But this dichotomous key, if you click on it here,
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.800]  you can see here, there's, this is a little hard to see, but it kind of walks you through the
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.600]  steps you should be going through in your head to figure out what the problem is. Is it biotic? Is
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.000]  it a biotic? You know, is it a pest? Is it a nutrient? If it is a nutrient, it's a mobile
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.720]  nutrient. And if you scroll down, Brandon's actually done some drawings of various plants
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:49.360]  and we link to some other articles and stuff that has some good information. So, we're just showing
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.960]  here where you'll see, you know, different nutrients displayed. So, nitrogen is an obvious
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:02.080]  one right there. Phosphorus, things like that. In terms of your question about living soil though,
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.760]  where, what I typically see is your mobile nutrients. So, you tend to see people run out of
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:13.920]  nitrates and potassium. So, if your plant just isn't bulking up the way you want it to, you don't
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.040]  have time to do a soil test, it's probably a lack of potassium that may have leached out of your
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.360]  soil. Easiest thing is to apply a little bit of potassium sulfate and see if the plant, if that
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:31.760]  helps give you a little more bud density. Can I say something real quick? Is that I see a ton of
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:40.720]  reports come through with an inverted magnesium to potassium ratio. And so, potassium, a lot of times
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:46.240]  is the smoking gun. It is the thing that's missing in so many soil reports that I see.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:55.520]  Yeah. If it's below, you know, three or 4% of your cation exchange capacity,
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.480]  of your total cations, then we tend to see issues.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:09.840]  And we tend to see high-ish or higher sodium levels because most living bed folks don't
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:15.280]  have any runoff at all. Sodium is super mobile. You know, if you're having runoff, it's gone,
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.840]  but we'll see cycle after cycle after cycle. And so, you'll start to get really high sodium.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.480]  And if you've got low potassium, then you get locked out real fast.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:30.880]  And the bottom of that page, Chad, if you start, I'll make you scroll back down. There's a link to
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.800]  Paul Coxon's paper on nutrient deficiencies. And that's a really great resource for folks
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.480]  that also mirrors a lot of what we're talking about here with actual photos of plants where
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.440]  he specifically removed sulfur, he specifically removed nitrogen, and then he shows you what the
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.880]  plant will look like. So, awesome resources for folks that are free.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.440]  Huge. Yeah. Huge resource. And, you know, just even that top is a little bit of free SOP. How
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.840]  do you walk into your room? How do you use that critical eye? How do you wear that detective hat?
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.720]  Just kind of the step-by-step process bookmarked. So, thank you for that one.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.440]  And there's a lot of stuff. I mean, while we have the website up too, or actually, let me pull it
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.840]  back up here. Tell us a little bit about maybe some of the tabs real quick. I know, again,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:31.680]  we're running short on time, but maybe just a couple of the tabs and what they are, or which
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:37.040]  ones you feel people should check out first. Let me scroll back up to the top. So, all right,
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.680]  we're back at the main page and we got your living soil, your amendments, your pests,
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.240]  folks, more than in contact. Yeah. So, basically, you know, we do sell gardening products. We sell
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.800]  soils that we formulate ourselves. We've been using for a long time. If you want to add a
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:01.520]  specific amendment to your soil, you can search by that. And then we now recently added beneficial
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:08.960]  insects from BioBe, shipped direct from Insectary to you. So, that's something we do offer BlueMat,
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:16.800]  custom BlueMat designs. And then we do soils in bulk anywhere from a bag to a thousand yards.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.240]  There's a link to the podcast. The blog page has a lot of the information regarding, you know,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.720]  I have an article on cover cropping. I have an article on no-till indoors.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.920]  Biochar. You know, a lot of these topics. And then we have some of the research that Ben
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:42.160]  has done over at Gold Leaf. That particular one relates to BlueMats and their yields and
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:47.600]  results around that. So, we're trying to get more and more information on the website. We did
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.360]  recently put heavy metal results for every single one of our products. I haven't even really
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.840]  announced this yet, but if you go to any of our products now, whether there's something we
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.360]  manufacture or not, we have an independent heavy metal test that we had done on the products
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:09.280]  available on the product page, I believe. Yep. Here we go. I see that right there. And good. Yeah.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.760]  Because that was kind of one of the last things that I wanted to touch on too, was just heavy metals.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:20.800]  You mentioned your pH up, pH down, your mycos. Those were things I was unsuspecting of.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:28.560]  Commonly, I hear them more so in kelp. But where else might we accidentally be getting this?
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:35.280]  For me, the home gardener, obviously there's the health reason for medicinals. But on the larger
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:42.800]  scale, commercially, heavy metals will flunk your entire crop and that's unacceptable. So,
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:49.440]  I know a lot of people here are on the commercial scale. So, maybe some of the obvious or less
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.160]  obvious sources of heavy metals? Kelp and soft rock are the first two that come to my mind.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.600]  What's- Soft rock phosphate.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:10.800]  Okay. You're potentially bringing in a good dose of heavy metals, but we've seen it come in in
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:20.640]  everything. We've seen it in people's water. We've seen it in not our inputs, but commercially
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:27.120]  available inputs that just have really high heavy metals. It's not something that was on anybody's
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:34.880]  radar who's coming from the four by four world. And so, I think a lot of folks just, it wasn't
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:40.000]  even in the planning stage. And two, because a lot of people,
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.480]  if you're reusing the soil time and time again, and you're adding a little bit here, a little bit
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:50.960]  there, that's when it becomes more of an issue because then it reaches a critical level,
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.480]  essentially. And you can't help but uptake it because cannabis is such a productive,
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.400]  it'll take up all those heavy metals. Nutrient accumulator. Yeah.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:13.040]  So, higher pHs can help with that. Something above six, six can help with limiting the uptake.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:20.400]  Silica can outcompete. There's some research that silica can outcompete heavy metals for uptake.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:26.480]  Once you've got heavy metals, you've got them. They're persistent. They're not going to go away.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:33.280]  And so, our whole thing is we want people to reuse their soil. That's sustainability. And so,
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:38.560]  we don't want people throwing out a truckload of soil. And so, you've got to pay attention to what
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.800]  you put into it. And that's why we like, I always encourage people. I'm like, you're not bothering
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:50.000]  me. If you're in the KISS ecosystem, you're working with KISS soil, call me before you put
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.840]  it in because I'll be more than happy to talk to you about it. Tell you whether I think there'll be
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:01.280]  a bump for you. I'll tell you if there's any potential antagonisms or issues that it might
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:08.720]  cause. It's all a learning process for everybody involved. And I think it's great because it's
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.280]  almost, you get to crowdsource some of these problems, but you already have the knowledge to
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:21.680]  apply, to ask the right questions or to easily give an answer. So, that's one thing I do enjoy
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:28.080]  about talking with other growers is I can get a hundred grows under my belt in a month if I talk
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:35.680]  to enough growers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just to jump in on the heavy metal thing, there's still a lot
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:41.040]  we don't know about what levels are even dangerous to human health when we're combusting a flower,
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:46.160]  when we're making it into a concentrate, when we're eating it. And the levels are going to vary
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.600]  state to state. And frankly, some of them I think are unrealistic. So, there's definitely a regulatory
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.600]  issue around it, especially since the lettuce, I mean, even though the less I'm getting out of
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.720]  Mexico that's organic could have potentially higher heavy metals than my cannabis. So,
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.400]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Okay. Yeah.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.040]  Dr. Aaron Masekala It's kind of scary when you think about that.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:13.920]  Heavy metals are everywhere. It's like radiation. It's all about dosage. It's not inherently bad.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:20.560]  Some metals in low doses are good or okay for us. So, like kelp has a lot of beneficial.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.080]  There's a lot of good reasons to use kelp in our soil. But if we use too much of it,
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.320]  yes, we're going to be bringing in heavy metals that we don't want. So, when you see that something
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.400]  has heavy metals in it, don't necessarily, I guess, freak out, but but realize that it's a
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:42.640]  balancing act. And there are things like biochar and silica and pH that are tools that we can use
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:50.160]  to help remediate or control soils or we can even run other crops through there as a way of reducing
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.200]  levels of heavy metals in our soil. So, and it's going to vary based on the cultivars based on
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.600]  the environment, based on the way you water in terms of uptake. So, it's another one of those
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.880]  things that's kind of complicated, unfortunately. It's not just a cut and dry thing. So, if people
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  tell you like, hey, I can guarantee there's no heavy metals in this, like they're throwing you
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:19.840]  a line. Do I feel pretty confident, you know, with our system that you're going to pass in your state?
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:25.040]  Absolutely, because we can see it and we do it. But, you know, when we start talking about making
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:32.720]  some of these ferments or teas or other products that people are using, they may be bringing in
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:38.320]  heavy metals without even realizing it. We had one guy failing just because they were doing
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:44.080]  construction in the building he was in and it was an old building in Oklahoma City and they were just
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:50.320]  knocking dust off of the pipes and the bricks and that had him failing for heavy metals. So,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:57.360]  it's stuff you don't even think about, honestly. You really have to dive in deep with the grower
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:04.640]  to figure out what's going on. And just to echo that, there is no one SOP, you know. You've got
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:10.240]  to ask the right questions. The grower's got to give you the feedback and you'll figure it out,
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.720]  but, you know, you've got to go down that path. Well, that's why I'm glad we have people who
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:23.120]  took the time to learn these things and become experts. And, Brendan, it's great to be able to
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.960]  get a hold of you, too, and to be able to bend your ear on these types of things because this,
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.400]  I'm not going to say life or death for a lot of people, but, you know, cannabis does give life to
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:41.120]  a lot of people. So, it's important. It is. It is. Yeah. And when you start talking about farming,
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.760]  you know, that's important. That's potentially somebody's great grandparents worked that land,
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.880]  you know. So, you want to see them succeed. You don't want to see them fail.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.400]  As far as passion, you know, there's some orchid guys, there's some geranium ladies,
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.480]  there's some people out there that are passionate about their plants, but person to person,
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.440]  you're not going to find anybody more passionate about their plant than cannabis growers. There's
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:16.160]  just, as a community, we're rabid. We're rabid for information. We're rabid for tools.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.120]  You know, we're so limited in our, you know, our IPM approaches, what we can use safely and that
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:28.080]  kind of stuff. And so, we're just always trying to learn, you know, the whole community. I love
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:34.000]  being part of it. I love talking to growers. It's awesome. Yep. I love, you know, I love the
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.160]  comments, you know, the comments like this. Definitely lots to think about.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.080]  Can I just throw a quick summary out there before we?
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.760]  Absolutely, please.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:49.680]  So, if I could have one, a few quick messages, just thinking that I would like to get out to
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.840]  growers. It's one, be a critical thinker, you know, try different things in your garden.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:01.440]  Absolutely. Have a control, learn for yourself. But don't get caught up in this idea that you
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  need this new fire product from this company. You can grow an absolutely healthy plant in healthy
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.400]  soil without any other inputs. And that those other products are only going to help if there's
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.800]  something lacking. And the only reason there's something lacking, it's because you didn't set
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.960]  up your fertility and manage it properly in the first place. And that's why that soil test is so
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.080]  key. And then having someone that can help you understand it. But don't get into that marketing
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:34.560]  hype in that marketing race. I just see so many companies that are pushing products rather than
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.240]  education. And it's very, very effective, because as a cannabis grower, I want the very best for my
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:45.280]  plant. And I just want people to take a step back and realize that you can have the very best just
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.280]  by starting with really high quality soil. Whether you make it yourself, whether you buy it, whether
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.520]  you, you know, improve it over time, through, you know, soil testing and modifying it, all of those
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:03.760]  things are things you can do without these, you know, ferment, enzyme, microbial products. I mean,
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.160]  they may have a place, but they're not going to, they're not going to be the difference between
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.480]  a healthy and unhealthy plant and a good yield and a bad yield. And then the last thing I want
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:21.840]  to say is sort of on the pest side. It's the same idea, this idea that, you know, if we grow a
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.240]  healthy plant, we're not going to have pests, and we're not going to have pathogens, we're not going
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.360]  to have disease. It's just patently false. And it really, it really bothers me that there's people
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.480]  out there that are pushing this because you can take the best grower in the world, and with the
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.960]  healthiest plant, and if there are root aphids in that get exposed to that plant in high enough
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.760]  doses, it's going to get root aphids. There's no way around it. So yes, we want the healthiest
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:53.680]  plants we can. Yes. A plant that is more susceptible, that is stressed is going to be more susceptible to
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.920]  disease. Those things are true. And I have no problem with that. But this idea that, you know,
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.600]  if I get a pest or pathogen, it's because I didn't have the right microbial population in the soil.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.880]  That's just not accurate. And I hope people don't fall down that path because I see,
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.920]  I see people rely too much on microbes. And don't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of the
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.600]  Soil Food Lab. The microbiology is what drives everything in organic soils. I firmly believe that.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.600]  But it's also only one piece of the puzzle. It's a tripod. You have the physical properties,
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.640]  you have the chemical properties, and you have the biological properties. And if you don't have
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:35.520]  all three of those correct, you're not going to have a healthy plant. And none of those three,
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.880]  in and of themselves, can completely protect your plant from pests and disease. Those are
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:45.040]  things that just happen in natural and in gardening. So all right, I'm done. That was all I had.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.240]  I just wanted to get out. That was perfect.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.600]  But that is the special sauce. People want to know, you know, what's the special sauce? Well,
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.960]  I'm doing all that. I'm doing all that. What's the secret, Brandon? What's the secret? And
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:05.520]  Tad just said, you dial in all the basics. You should have a target, you know, limiting factors.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:13.680]  You should have a CO2, PPFD, nutrient levels, irrigation, air exchange. You should have a
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:20.720]  target for all those. And once you can meet that, then if you want to try something,
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.240]  try something. But special sauce is doing it right from the start. That's how you get
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:33.440]  the best terpenes, the best trichome production, the most resinous, you know, the best bag appeal,
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:39.280]  the esters, the alcohols, terpenes, all the volatiles. You get that with nailing the basics.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.920]  Yep. That's the sauce.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:49.840]  The critical thinking is so important, particularly as we advance in this industry and more
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:56.480]  advertising dollars come into it. Yes, it's great to be able to cut through the clutter
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.480]  and start with the basic ingredient. And that's a healthy soil.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.600]  And it's in the same thing. Like, think about the gold rush, you know, think about all the snake
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:13.200]  oil, all the predators that were just waiting on some poor oaky to show up and, you know,
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:20.640]  and take everything he had. And I see that and I see people prey on cannabis growers because we're
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:27.440]  coming out of prohibition. Most of us didn't get the agronomy background. And so there's somebody
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.640]  waiting to take your money. There's somebody waiting to give you an SOP that they didn't build.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.440]  There's, you know, so, you know, buyer beware and just keep that, you know, that science mind on.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.120]  Yep. I do enjoy that. And you guys, you guys kind of took my last question from me. It's like,
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.040]  was there anything else that you wanted to mention that we didn't quite cover this evening?
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:58.240]  We also do lights. We also do rolling bed. We also do fabric pots. We also do workflow consult.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.200]  If you got a problem, give me a call.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:07.280]  And this is all over at the Kiss Organics. And again, the link for Kiss Organics, the website
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:14.880]  is down in the bottom, the show description, show notes. And, you know, you honestly don't have to
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:20.240]  go too far to find someone who's had a good experience with it. I've used it. I've had
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.280]  good experiences with it. And it sounds like obviously, Brandon, you have too, Tad. This is
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.320]  your jam. So of course, but you've had a lot of the trial and error. So we appreciate that, that
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.320]  you took the nosedives. We just get the benefits from it.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.920]  Yeah. It feels awkward talking about Kiss, but I appreciate that's why we need people like Brandon
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.200]  that will bring it up for me because it's hard for me to talk about it. But yeah, you know,
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:51.840]  at the end of the day, like I just, I love the fact that a lot of people are trying to grow using
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:58.800]  organics, whether you're sourcing everything off your land or you're using another company's
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.040]  products. It's all good, man. As long as we're all trying to do a little better for the planet.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:09.040]  Our thing is big on taking a science-based approach. That's not for everybody. But if
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.880]  you're interested, you know, please reach out. We'd love to, we'd love to work with more growers,
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.680]  whether you have two plants or 2000, you're going to get the same, the same help.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.560]  Yep. And you're not new to this either. This is something you guys have both been doing for a
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:30.640]  while. So that also speaks volumes and, you know, it makes people a little bit less reluctant
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:37.280]  to use a service like that. So, you know, definitely reach out. But before we go, what
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.480]  I always also like to ask, where can people find you? What do you have upcoming? Tad, I know you've
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.720]  got podcasts coming up. Brandon, let's start with you. Where can people find you if they wanted to
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:55.200]  connect with you? Yeah. So the easiest thing is to hit me up at Kiss. You can call our 425 number
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:04.160]  425-558-0990. You can email me, Brandon at kissorganics.com. And I'm on Instagram as tatu
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:12.480]  sadhu. So I make the rounds and yeah, T-A-T-U-S-A-D-H-U. Yeah. I'm going to pull that one up.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.640]  It's in the show notes, everybody. It's down there. Yeah. Yeah. That's a hard people that
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:22.320]  throws people, but yeah. But, but yeah, I'm easy to get in touch with. Cool. And then how about you,
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.000]  Tad? What's, what's the best place to maybe find you or some of the things that you've got coming
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:34.240]  up? Yeah. Well, I think people, if you, if you, anything through our company finds me, we're a
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:44.480]  small company. Yeah. So we're pretty easy to find at kissorganics on with one S on Instagram is
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:51.520]  probably the most common for growers right now. But yeah, upcoming dope history, I guess I should
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:57.360]  mention that. So we're continuing the cannabis cultivation and science podcast. I have my next
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:03.680]  one is with Dr. Danielle Vergara talking about genetics. And then after that, I'm going to get
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.640]  Jeff on. Yeah. I know he already came on your show, but Jeff Longfellow to talk about some different
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:15.280]  topics around teaming with bacteria. I have and the clay and David Montgomery Montgomery coming on
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.880]  to talk about their most recent book on regenerative soils around the world. And then Paul
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.760]  Coxon and a lot of the guys with his research are going to be coming on to talk more about
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.240]  cannabis deficiencies and some of the latest research on there, which is really exciting.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:40.160]  Dope history, actually, Chad and I are collaborating on co-hosting. It's been like four years, but we're
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:46.960]  finally getting this off. We've got season one in the books, all mastered and ready to go. So we're
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.080]  going to be releasing that soon. And that's just going to be the personal narratives of like some
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:58.640]  really cool, influential people who really shaped our industry. Dr. Keith, or not Dr. Keith Strauch,
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:06.080]  who founded Normal. His life story through his eyes. Eddie Leff, who's now passed away. We're
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:14.320]  sharing his story. Frenchie Cannoli's wife, Madame Cannoli, came on and shared his life story. And
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:21.520]  then Tom Alexander, who founded Tensomea Tips and Growing Edge. Yeah. Am I forgetting anyone?
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:27.120]  Ed. We've got Ed. We've got Ed. Got to ask Ed. Ed Rosenthal.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:32.640]  Yeah. MJBs. Yeah. And then tell them about season two.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:39.200]  Yep. Season two is going to be fun. We're reaching out. We're talking to a lot of the breeders
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.440]  that have made some of the strains that we know, that we've liked and enjoyed. But again,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:53.360]  one of the real fun things about this is we're not looking for the pinpoint historical accuracy.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.880]  We want to hear the story from these people's eyes. That's the fun part. You always talk about
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.760]  sitting down on a porch with the old man and kicking it. Well, that's kind of what we're
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:08.560]  doing. So I'm looking forward to that because again, I get to talk with some of these people
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.960]  too. So it's going to be interesting. Yeah. I'm hoping to have a bigger reach than the
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.640]  cultivation podcast because not everyone wants to grow their own cannabis, but I think everyone
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:22.880]  wants to hear the first time Tommy Chong smoked a joint. Those are the kinds of things that we
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.120]  want to have available for people. And then I really want to break out to where we have stories
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.960]  of people that no one's ever heard of, but just their life story or some of the things they've
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.440]  experienced is just so cool. We can share some of that. So I really see it broadening out and
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.840]  growing, but I'm super excited for that. Lastly, Brandon reminded me, I will be at MJ BizCon in
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.040]  the BIOS lighting booth. If anyone's going to that, I'm looking forward to seeing people at
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:56.160]  that. I know Suzanne, the bug lady will be there and a few other people. Dr. Ben Higgins is going
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:01.840]  with us too. So I've never been, I hear it's kind of business-y, so I don't know, but.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.720]  Yeah, it'll be a joy. It'll be fun. You don't have to tuck your shirt in. How about that?
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.280]  All right. Have you gone before?
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:18.000]  No, no. Plenty of people that have, but yeah, no, that's the joke. We're not fully business.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.040]  The shirt's untucked.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:26.560]  Yeah. I'm excited to check it out and I'm super excited for the history. We are so close on this.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.020]  Yes.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.160]  Let's get together and set a release date so we can stop telling people about it and actually get
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.040]  it out there.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.280]  Yes. Yes. And I'm really excited too, guys. And I know I'm going to tease here, but really excited
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.360]  again, season two, some of the guests that we have on and the stories that I know they're going to
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:48.560]  tell are just, but I don't want to let those go. Definitely check out season one. Cannabis history
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:54.160]  is something that we all love and want to know more about. And I definitely learned as part of
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:59.360]  being, or as part of the process, I learned. So I think everybody's going to enjoy it. And yes,
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.600]  we need a date. We need a date, damn it.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.960]  Yes. Yeah.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.240]  Coming soon.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.880]  Yeah. Very soon. Within the next, let's say within the next two months, month, two months,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:15.920]  very reasonable timeframe to get it out there. Yeah. There's the pressure on us. We said it
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.640]  publicly. So.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:21.680]  Yep. Oh no, I said it last week too on another show. I'm like, coming soon. It was funny.
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:23.360]  Chad Casual at BizCon.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:28.560]  Fair enough. See, that's what I've heard. So I didn't want to say it, but yeah, there you go.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.200]  I know my parents picked the worst possible name for me to be in the cannabis industry,
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:39.680]  but whatever. I don't think this exactly was their call when they had me. Whatever.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.480]  I don't think my parents planned for let's go Brandon either. So.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.400]  Oh my gosh, Ted, you just need a nickname and then we're all,
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.920]  we're all hosed, but we won't go there tonight. We'll keep it out of the green.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:56.880]  Who thinks got a nickname? We'll tell you about that later though.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.640]  Tell me off air. No.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.960]  Everybody, thank you in chat for hanging out. This has been a really fun episode. You guys have been
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:10.560]  great. Love seeing the comments and love seeing the interaction in the back and forth with you
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.720]  guys too. A lot of smart people in there answering questions as they get asked. So
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.880]  Ted, Brandon, thank you guys so much for your time. Really appreciate it.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:27.760]  Awesome. And with that, I will hit the end broadcast button and we're out of here.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:28.240]  So.
