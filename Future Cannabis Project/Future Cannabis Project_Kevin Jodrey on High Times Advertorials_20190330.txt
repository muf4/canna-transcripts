[00:00.000 --> 00:03.500]  What you have is you have information that's used as basically marketing.
[00:03.500 --> 00:07.800]  It's kind of like reading old high times, because I haven't read the shit in years.
[00:07.800 --> 00:13.800]  It's like reading high times and every article was basically to sell the material on the next page.
[00:13.800 --> 00:16.200]  So they're not giving you any information.
[00:16.200 --> 00:20.000]  They're giving you a marketing pitch wrapped around some photos.
[00:20.000 --> 00:22.900]  So the problem is you're not really getting true info.
[00:22.900 --> 00:24.500]  You're getting marketing.
[00:24.500 --> 00:28.600]  And what people need is true info because that's what's going to resonate.
[00:28.600 --> 00:33.100]  And I think in this kind of community, that's what you get.
[00:33.100 --> 00:37.800]  And when people come to hang out and experience that type of situation,
[00:37.800 --> 00:43.300]  their education level skyrockets and their appreciation of cannabis culture skyrockets.
[00:43.300 --> 00:47.700]  And it means that they'll take the time to ask the person at the counter,
[00:47.700 --> 00:51.900]  could you direct me into something like this?
[00:51.900 --> 00:56.700]  Because the person at the counter, who's the lowest paid person in the dispensary,
[00:56.700 --> 00:59.800]  is the gatekeeper to every one of your farm successes.
