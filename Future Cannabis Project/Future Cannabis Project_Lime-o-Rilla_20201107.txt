[00:03.520 --> 00:09.320]  All right, welcome everyone. It's thanks for waiting. It's a little past 8 p.m.
[00:09.320 --> 00:16.520]  Pacific. Oklahoma is what, two hours ahead? Yeah, it's 10 o'clock out here.
[00:16.520 --> 00:22.920]  10 o'clock. All right, we are with this guy, Brandon Rust, who has been working some
[00:22.920 --> 00:30.360]  lines and has a killer illustrator. By the way, I like your illustrator. Yeah, I'm
[00:30.360 --> 00:36.160]  really stoked. He's actually a tag artist. He does murals on the side of trains, like
[00:36.160 --> 00:43.000]  on a secret missions. He's just a really cool dude. In Oklahoma, where is he based? No, he's
[00:43.000 --> 00:52.440]  in another state. I think he's in Maryland. I get it. Yeah, no, I like good artwork. Yeah,
[00:52.440 --> 00:59.440]  I do too. That's another one of my passions. I'm not a very talented artist, but I have some other
[00:59.440 --> 01:06.960]  cool art stuff that I do when I have the opportunity. I figured I'd start by introducing
[01:06.960 --> 01:15.560]  myself. If you guys aren't familiar, the listeners, my name is Brandon Rust. I'm from San Diego,
[01:15.680 --> 01:22.680]  and I moved out here to Oklahoma. I run a large organic indoor facility out here in Oklahoma,
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.640]  and I own Bokashi Earthworks. If you want to find more information on me, you can find me on
[01:28.640 --> 01:37.960]  Instagram at rust.brandon, R-U-S-T, Brandon, all one word. You can find me here on Future Canvas
[01:37.960 --> 01:48.240]  Project and Cheap Home Grow Podcast, which we do live every Sunday. Let me just get...give me one
[01:48.240 --> 01:58.200]  second. Like that? Yeah. No, that was my old account. It actually got deleted. It's no dot
[01:58.200 --> 02:06.280]  in there anymore. Just Rust Brandon? Yep. All right, take two. In there, if you know, you can
[02:06.280 --> 02:17.000]  find the link in there for my Bokashi company, Bokashi Earthworks. My website is bokashiearthworks.com.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  You can find different types of microbes, EM consortiums, amino acids. I got some new stuff
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.560]  that's going to be going up there. The biggest thing everybody probably that is tuning in really
[02:27.560 --> 02:33.840]  wants to know is where they can find this drop at. We should probably give them the website, right?
[02:33.840 --> 02:42.880]  It is right there. Perfect. That's www.daga.live. That's awesome. I love how you're able...
[02:42.880 --> 02:50.240]  Love, love, love. Oh yeah, love. Whoops. Really small text there, but that's really cool that you can do that. I like that.
[02:50.240 --> 02:58.920]  Yeah, we are... People can see. You know what? We can make it bigger by doing that. There we go.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.520]  There you go. It's like fat and bold and... Can't miss it. Super legible.
[03:05.560 --> 03:13.720]  I guess I could start by kind of giving a little history on the
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.680]  Lyme-a-rilla. Well, first of all, the genetics are groggy four times black Lyme reserve.
[03:21.560 --> 03:28.600]  It was one of those kind of happy accidents like most stories that you'll hear in cannabis.
[03:29.720 --> 03:38.200]  I've always been kind of the guy that people are asked if they can
[03:38.200 --> 03:44.200]  check on their garden, see what's going on. My willingness to always go and look at
[03:44.200 --> 03:51.080]  stuff and help people out has kind of led me into some unusual situations, some hairy
[03:51.080 --> 03:56.920]  situations and some also some pretty awesome situations. This was both kind of all three.
[03:57.240 --> 04:05.400]  I was asked to go check out this garden and it was just a home grower who had set
[04:05.400 --> 04:11.080]  something up. His first grow and the guy that was helping him out had bailed out on him. He had...
[04:13.400 --> 04:21.400]  He was growing out the a-rilla-glu-four that we had. Then he also had the black
[04:21.400 --> 04:25.640]  Lyme reserve cut. I'm not sure where he got the black Lyme reserve cut from.
[04:27.800 --> 04:35.160]  Long story short, this garden wasn't looking very hot.
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.360]  When I got in there, I was like, these are your options. You can continue to let this thing go.
[04:43.800 --> 04:49.640]  I think it was the gorilla glue was starting to harm because of all the stress
[04:49.640 --> 04:55.800]  factors that were going on. I was all, if you pull now, you're not going to get anything.
[04:56.360 --> 05:02.200]  If you let this go, you have the option. I gave him his options. You're going to get some seeds
[05:02.200 --> 05:08.440]  in your weed, but at least you'll have something to smoke on. He's an older dude. He was used to
[05:08.440 --> 05:15.480]  smoking schwag weed, Mexican brick weed and stuff. I told him, I think you should just let it do its
[05:15.480 --> 05:21.480]  thing. This is your first grow. You're going to get something. I ended up helping him finish
[05:21.480 --> 05:31.560]  everything out and help them figure out how to dry everything. I just helped him get to a place
[05:31.560 --> 05:40.520]  where he could produce something better the next round. Out of all the product that he grew,
[05:41.800 --> 05:48.600]  I grabbed up a bunch of seeds because like I said, the gorilla glue had harmed. I just started
[05:48.600 --> 05:58.040]  pulling seeds out of that black lime reserve. I started popping them. This was in, I think, 2015.
[06:04.300 --> 06:07.980]  Let's see. I started running through them. I started growing them out. I was growing them
[06:07.980 --> 06:16.140]  out in San Diego. I started just pulling out these incredible plants with terpene profiles
[06:16.140 --> 06:29.500]  that were absolutely insane. They were just... It had this resinous stickiness that you get
[06:29.500 --> 06:36.380]  from that gorilla glue. It just had these insane chemical, artificial chemical soap
[06:37.100 --> 06:42.940]  with full lime terpene profile. I found a couple of variations in that,
[06:43.900 --> 06:52.220]  one being the gorilla glue liner, which had a very strong coffee and tarty lime flavor.
[06:54.620 --> 07:01.100]  I ran through a bunch of that. I found something that I really liked. I had a plant that was
[07:01.100 --> 07:08.620]  testing at incredibly high terpene levels when terpene tests first started becoming available
[07:08.620 --> 07:20.220]  out in California readily. I had chosen that plant and I crossed that with another variety
[07:20.220 --> 07:27.260]  that I had, Purple Kush Grape God. I also back-crossed it into itself, just doing a
[07:27.260 --> 07:34.060]  rototillization, old Soma style method, which was taught to me way back in the day when I first
[07:34.060 --> 07:43.740]  started. I did that. I reversed it into itself. I know I have the F2 generations that I've been
[07:43.740 --> 07:50.780]  running through. They're all really similar. All the stuff that you guys have probably seen
[07:51.500 --> 08:02.780]  on my feed has come from that. The current project was really interesting because when I
[08:04.220 --> 08:12.620]  got out here to Oklahoma, I had the opportunity to do a big pheno hunt so I could have a selection
[08:14.700 --> 08:24.140]  for the facility that I'm cultivating at. There was, I think, like 120 males out of, I think,
[08:24.620 --> 08:38.060]  the maybe it was like 350 or maybe 400 seeds that I had popped. The Lime 1 back-cross that
[08:39.500 --> 08:46.220]  Jackson had given to me at Emerald Cup a couple months before, because this is back in the
[08:46.220 --> 08:52.380]  beginning of the year, he gave me some seeds back in December at the Cup. Those were some of the
[08:52.380 --> 09:02.380]  ones that I was hunting through. This particular variety had some of the whitest leaf. It was a
[09:02.380 --> 09:07.660]  broad leaf dominant variety. It had some of the whitest leaf morphology that I had ever seen in
[09:07.660 --> 09:14.540]  any cannabis variety. I was really digging it because it was just, for me, really unique. I
[09:14.540 --> 09:27.820]  hadn't seen anything with such a wide profile. It was nice and short and stocky. It outshined
[09:27.820 --> 09:37.260]  a lot of the plants that were in there to begin with. I had all of these males that were lined up
[09:37.260 --> 09:41.260]  and I was like, I'll just start cutting them down. I got to it and I was like, I don't really want to
[09:41.260 --> 09:50.140]  cut this down. I just kept it around for a while. It didn't really do anything. Eventually, I just
[09:50.140 --> 09:58.540]  took a clone. I was like, I'm just going to use this for my home grow. I took it home and I had
[09:58.540 --> 10:05.420]  one of the Lime Arula 31 cuts, which was one of the cuts from the first generation.
[10:05.820 --> 10:17.180]  That 31 cut was a great cut. I actually grew that the previous year before I came out here.
[10:18.700 --> 10:24.780]  I gave that cut to Jackson. I gave it to a couple other people. I think he used it in one of his
[10:24.780 --> 10:34.300]  breeding projects. Anyway, back to that Lime 1 male. That male was just a really nice, hardy plant.
[10:34.300 --> 10:40.540]  It grew really nice. It grew quick. It was just really beefy. I just wanted to preserve it.
[10:40.540 --> 10:48.780]  I figured, if I'm going to choose one male out of all of these ones, that was the one that I
[10:48.780 --> 10:56.940]  ended up choosing. It just happened to also be, I think, one of the parents to the Black Lime
[10:56.940 --> 11:03.980]  Reserve, which was used in the creation of the Lime Arula. I felt like it was a good match.
[11:05.020 --> 11:15.660]  I also wanted to out-cross the Lime Arula and then inbreed it back into itself, just so I could have
[11:16.780 --> 11:25.980]  male selections, since it is a feminized seed line. I figured that would be a really good way to
[11:26.860 --> 11:31.580]  go about doing it as well, because that would give me some of the characteristics. I didn't
[11:31.580 --> 11:38.460]  really know what to expect until I grew out all the females. The terpene profiles on the females
[11:39.660 --> 11:49.100]  have a similar characteristic on some of the notes. I expect them to blend really well.
[11:52.530 --> 11:53.410]  That looks nice.
[11:57.610 --> 11:59.210]  I'm not seeing any video feed.
[12:01.610 --> 12:04.410]  How about there? Can you see us now?
[12:05.130 --> 12:05.630]  Oh.
[12:10.420 --> 12:11.460]  Jackson, what's up?
[12:12.100 --> 12:12.900]  How are you guys doing?
[12:14.740 --> 12:20.340]  Where'd my camera go? My god, hold on. Here comes Brandon.
[12:21.620 --> 12:23.540]  There we go. I got disconnected, but I'm back.
[12:26.570 --> 12:28.970]  No worries. All right. Can you see us, by the way?
[12:30.490 --> 12:31.930]  Yeah, I can see you guys.
[12:32.890 --> 12:36.250]  What I was showing was that.
[12:37.850 --> 12:43.290]  Oh, yeah. That's her right there. That's the Lime Arula. She is just a beautiful plant.
[12:47.240 --> 12:49.000]  Was that the cut that you gave me?
[12:51.800 --> 12:54.440]  I think that is the cut that I gave you.
[12:54.520 --> 13:07.080]  I ran it out in the depth. It was killer. You could smell the Chem D notes in it that some of
[13:07.080 --> 13:15.000]  the gnarlier Black Lime Reserves had. The Black Lime Reserve, my favorite ones in it were the
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.600]  limiest ones, but then there was the ones you gave me that had the Lime Arula you gave me.
[13:21.400 --> 13:37.160]  It was just like the one I put in the Emerald Cup. That one had this metallic, musky, deep,
[13:37.160 --> 13:44.520]  skunky funk, and then it had the heavy lime peel too. It was killer. When I grew it out,
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.240]  I was like, I wonder which way it went, what you had. Then when I checked it out, I was like,
[13:49.960 --> 14:00.120]  damn. I was stoked because it was like the one that I had that had that exact nose was killer,
[14:00.120 --> 14:06.040]  but it was hard to trim. It didn't weigh that much. A really big plant was only like five pounds
[14:08.040 --> 14:15.880]  in a 200. When I saw the one that you gave me, I was stoked because I was like, oh, it's that weed,
[14:15.880 --> 14:22.360]  but it's really chunky. The one I had was super frosty like that, but it just wasn't as chunky,
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.760]  so it was cool that that nose cut through. I liked it a lot. I ended up hitting it with
[14:30.200 --> 14:36.920]  PK Cross Black Lime, which is what Lime One is, which is the mother side of the Black Lime Reserve.
[14:37.880 --> 14:45.960]  Then I hit that with an F5 of that. We'll see what it does. I'll get you a bunch of those.
[14:46.680 --> 14:55.960]  Nice. Yeah, I'm really excited. I took that same male and I hit a bunch of other stuff. I hit the
[14:55.960 --> 15:01.480]  Gorilla Glue back with it. I think that one will be really interesting. It seems like
[15:02.120 --> 15:11.800]  that Gorilla Glue just breeds really well. I had just a really small plant,
[15:12.600 --> 15:19.400]  one of the, I think it's Super Glue. I think it's like Afghani times NL5 times On Haze that
[15:20.440 --> 15:28.520]  Todd gave me at the Cup 2. I hit one of the females, one of the clones that I picked out
[15:28.520 --> 15:36.600]  of that and I hit it with that Lime One male. Sorry, I was talking to Gemma.
[15:42.350 --> 15:50.750]  And then, yeah, dude. When I was hunting through the Lime Arulas, I would get really just like
[15:50.750 --> 15:55.710]  kind of almost two variations. There was one that would be more on the glue side, which still had
[15:56.510 --> 16:06.110]  this pungent soapy chem, but it had this really heavy coffee overtone to it, which I really liked.
[16:06.910 --> 16:12.750]  But that one that just really gets me is that profile that is just super deep in there and it
[16:12.750 --> 16:21.310]  has really complex layers. I was looking for this kind of artificial chemical soap. It's almost like
[16:21.870 --> 16:28.830]  a floral soap. It's really perfumey and pungent and skunky and then it just cuts through with that
[16:29.470 --> 16:34.430]  top end with that lime, dude. That's like one of my favorite profiles.
[16:35.630 --> 16:42.990]  I'm going to keep working the Lime Arula. That's one of the reasons why I'm really excited because
[16:42.990 --> 16:50.910]  I'm running a bunch of these right now and I'll find a really good male and I'll back cross it
[16:51.070 --> 17:01.870]  back into that cut so I can have a regular seed line side that I can run through.
[17:04.350 --> 17:12.190]  Yeah, it's a good idea. The Lime 1 back cross is three quarters lime and the Lime Arula
[17:12.190 --> 17:23.070]  is a quarter lime. So you should get neat stuff happening. The glue was one that I got that.
[17:24.510 --> 17:32.270]  I got a couple buds of that when it won the cup in San Bernardino. That was kind of when it got
[17:32.270 --> 17:39.550]  popularized, I think. Everybody's like, damn, have you seen that shit? It's a shit. And then
[17:39.550 --> 17:44.910]  pretty soon everybody was like, oh, whatever. It's been a dream and this and that. People got
[17:44.910 --> 17:49.870]  it. Everybody had it. A lot of people, I think, had fake cuts. A lot of people cut it early. A
[17:49.870 --> 17:56.110]  lot of people pump it and then dry it like shit. But like, yeah, it's really good. It has that
[17:56.110 --> 18:02.430]  good coffee. Like it reminded me of the Hindu we had, like good baba, but a little bit better and
[18:02.430 --> 18:09.150]  more complex. That coffee earthier. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's a natural mix. I would have
[18:09.150 --> 18:18.910]  crossed that with the lime for sure. I've actually still never grown it because it was one of those
[18:18.910 --> 18:23.310]  ones where it was like all of a sudden everyone had it. And I try to kind of like keep things that
[18:23.310 --> 18:32.750]  I think nobody might have, not to have something exclusive, but because like, you know, you try to
[18:33.310 --> 18:36.750]  hold on to the things you think people are going to lose. So some of the stuff I keep is kind of
[18:36.750 --> 18:42.510]  weird. And you know, like people, it was like you try to show it to people and if people don't
[18:42.510 --> 18:48.110]  understand it, they don't, you know, they wouldn't keep it. So yeah, I've never really done, but it's
[18:48.110 --> 18:54.590]  definitely like it performs. It's a big killer plant. It gets tons of resin. And I like that
[18:54.590 --> 19:00.990]  profile from it. It's what people would say is super plain to for certain tastes. Like if you
[19:00.990 --> 19:06.670]  only like like Skittles or something, you might not like that. But like I kind of grew up with
[19:06.670 --> 19:13.470]  like the Ghanis and the Hindu and I like those kind of coffee earth things, you know? Yeah. And
[19:13.470 --> 19:19.230]  dude, I mean, I paid my bills with that, you know, with that, that purple Kush, that Oakland cut
[19:20.430 --> 19:27.550]  for about 14 years, dude. And that was that the Bubba and the Master Kush were all really,
[19:27.550 --> 19:36.110]  really similar. They all have that really deep earth must coffee. And they were great. I mean,
[19:36.110 --> 19:40.190]  those are tried and true. Some of those are still floating around down in San Diego. Some of my
[19:40.190 --> 19:47.230]  friends still have them. The Gorilla Glue man in 2000, I want to say in like 2014.
[19:48.670 --> 19:54.270]  It was hard to sell Gorilla Glue because everybody had it and you would go into any shop.
[19:54.270 --> 19:57.230]  And they would be like, oh, we have Gorilla Glue. And it would be like,
[19:59.150 --> 20:03.550]  look at this Gorilla Glue, you know, like so many people were doing it. And there was
[20:04.270 --> 20:09.790]  so much that was not good that it was it just became hard to sell. And the and the
[20:10.910 --> 20:16.830]  price for it just depreciated to a point where I couldn't grow it, you know?
[20:17.710 --> 20:21.070]  Yeah, that's a typical trend, you know, I mean, when people first see.
[20:21.470 --> 20:26.670]  I mean, anything that gets like blown out that hard, it's got to be good to start. But then
[20:26.670 --> 20:31.070]  once everybody gets their hands on it, it's easy to give it a bad name because
[20:32.110 --> 20:37.790]  statistically, if you got three people growing something and they know it's special,
[20:40.030 --> 20:44.270]  they're probably pretty close to whoever popped it or, you know, like you kind of
[20:45.070 --> 20:50.510]  more likely to have the most experience with it. And then when everybody gets something and
[20:50.990 --> 20:56.110]  it's really easy for it, just, you know, like I said, just the statistics of it,
[20:56.110 --> 20:59.550]  all of a sudden it's like, well, now you're going to have more that's not as good,
[20:59.550 --> 21:03.550]  you know, you can get a bad name on something really quick, you know?
[21:04.510 --> 21:12.270]  Yeah, I think, you know, talking about exclusive, exclusive cuts and kind of, you know,
[21:13.310 --> 21:19.310]  I think a lot of people, you know, were able to make their names and, you know, keep themselves
[21:19.310 --> 21:27.230]  afloat off of the elite cuts. And that's one, you know, it's kind of strange because if you're
[21:27.230 --> 21:31.950]  new into cannabis, or if you're just kind of like a home grower, and you haven't been doing this,
[21:31.950 --> 21:37.550]  like, you might not know, dude, but some of these cuts, dude, like, they're what,
[21:38.670 --> 21:43.790]  what made it so that way we could operate in certain, you know, at certain times, because
[21:44.270 --> 21:49.310]  again, and you could have something like Blue Dream, and everybody was growing it, but not
[21:49.310 --> 21:56.510]  everybody had, like, you know, the Bull Rider, not everybody had, you know, the Romulan or,
[21:56.510 --> 22:03.950]  you know, they didn't have the exclusive stuff that was really sought after. So, you know,
[22:03.950 --> 22:09.150]  when I started this, I was just really lucky to have a bunch of OGs that had been in the game that,
[22:10.110 --> 22:12.190]  you know, had all this cool stuff.
[22:18.560 --> 22:23.440]  So, just quickly, someone asked if it washes well.
[22:25.360 --> 22:33.600]  Yeah, it, um, one of the things that I noticed with the, with the Limerilla is that
[22:34.240 --> 22:41.840]  it's really hard to stabilize the concentrate. I think it's just because it's, it's so oily,
[22:42.480 --> 22:49.760]  that it doesn't, like, it just, I've never had, when I was doing, when I was doing concentrates
[22:49.760 --> 22:56.800]  heavy, you know, right before I got sent to prison, which two years freedom today,
[22:58.640 --> 23:05.920]  I, I was doing a bunch of it. I was, I was doing a bunch of rosin, I was doing a bunch of
[23:06.880 --> 23:13.760]  BHO and it would dump. But again, I could never get it to stabilize no matter what I do,
[23:13.760 --> 23:19.680]  whether it was solventless or whether it was with chemical extraction.
[23:21.680 --> 23:29.040]  Yeah. I mean, stuff usually with the lime in it. I mean, I've seen like the Black Lime Reserve.
[23:29.680 --> 23:35.120]  I saw one test come back, I think, was it like 4.8% terps at SC Labs?
[23:37.120 --> 23:43.200]  Like, you know, it's, it's a lot. So if you run it next to, like, I had somebody
[23:43.200 --> 23:57.200]  ran like Root Beer, Sky Cuddler, Lime and Black Lime Reserve and PK Black Lime and Cherry Limeade.
[23:58.160 --> 24:03.440]  And like the Root Beer and the Sky Cuddler Kush make like nice sugar, you know, as, as live resin.
[24:03.440 --> 24:10.720]  Like when you, when you let it set up, it just kind of turns into like, like the whole things,
[24:10.720 --> 24:18.400]  like small diamonds, kind of with a little bit of terps in it, you know? And then, and then the lime
[24:18.480 --> 24:27.280]  is like nice sugar on bottom and then a big terp layer on top. And then, and then the Cherry Lime
[24:27.280 --> 24:35.360]  was like, my boy was like, dude, I think I ruined it. I don't know if the freezer went out or what
[24:35.360 --> 24:41.280]  happened, but it was, the jar was just liquid. And it was, it was liquid because that weed was like
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.440]  6% terps. So you can imagine like in between, if you go, if you go Sky Cuddler, there's only a
[24:47.440 --> 24:53.840]  couple percent and like OGs and stuff like that. Usually 2.5, 3% is like really high. A lot of it's
[24:53.840 --> 25:01.440]  like 1.5 or 1.8 or 2.2 or whatever. Then you start to creep up into four and five and then you get
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.680]  above that. And it's just like, there's no, there's no way to make it stable, you know?
[25:05.680 --> 25:11.680]  And then depending on what kind of terpenes it has in it too, things get even more unstable. So
[25:11.760 --> 25:16.960]  anything with lime in them is going to be hard to wash. Like that's why it's such good flower
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.320]  weed to smoke joints of because it's like steamy and rich and bomb because the terps are just wet.
[25:22.320 --> 25:29.120]  But when you try to like make water hash out of it, it's like, you know, a lot of it is winds up
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.720]  in the water. And when you make BHO out of it or whatever, then you wind up like just having this
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.080]  huge amount of terps, which can be cool because you can have like sugar and then like, you know,
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.080]  sugar and then make pens straight live pens out of the rest or whatever. So you got to figure out
[25:46.080 --> 25:52.640]  what to do with it. But washing stuff with lime in it, I haven't seen like, it's not that you
[25:52.640 --> 25:56.960]  won't get really killer hash if you wash it to make water hash. It's just that you'll be like,
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.360]  where did it all go? There's all this resin, you can test it. It's got these high test results.
[26:01.360 --> 26:06.400]  And then you wonder where it goes, but there's so much terps that it's like half water soluble
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.440]  almost, you know, you get that super foamed up water and it just, there's, you know, you look at
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.400]  it and you just see the oil slip on it. It's all getting in the water. So, you know, it's, it's for
[26:16.400 --> 26:22.080]  me, I'd say that kind of weed is better for flower. And that's what I bred it for more was to be able
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.800]  because you smoke it and you go, damn, this is a good joint. But then when you go to extract it,
[26:26.800 --> 26:32.400]  all that terps that make it a good joint makes it be, you know, fucked up for extracting something.
[26:33.040 --> 26:41.040]  The, the, the PK that you were talking about, is that a pure kush or is that the purple kush from
[26:41.040 --> 26:48.880]  Oakland? No, it's pure kush. It's the Hollywood, Hollywood PK. I've never been able to nail down
[26:48.880 --> 26:54.160]  if it's the Topanga, but as far as I know, from everything I can tell, it's the Topanga. It just
[26:54.160 --> 27:00.000]  is, it just, it was the Hollywood and then it got the Topanga name and I got it from Tahonga. And
[27:00.960 --> 27:06.240]  then there's an S1 from that. That's the Malibu people say, and I don't really know that much
[27:06.240 --> 27:14.000]  about it. I just know when I got it, I got it from Hollywood. And they said they got it from Tahonga.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.040]  And so it like went from Hollywood to Tahonga, back to Hollywood. And then dude gave it to
[27:19.040 --> 27:25.520]  somebody I know. And then I wound up with it. And that was like 2004, 2005. I'm not exactly sure
[27:25.520 --> 27:32.400]  like exactly where it was, but it was right around in there, maybe in the spring of 2005 or
[27:32.400 --> 27:38.000]  the spring of 2004, something like that. And then I seeded it and I only made a little bit of seeds
[27:38.000 --> 27:44.720]  and the stuff I got out of it was like just hitters really, really good. I still have it and
[27:44.720 --> 27:50.480]  I'm, I'm still messing around with it, but. Cool. Cool. Yeah. I just, I just got, I just got a cut
[27:50.480 --> 28:01.040]  from a mutual associate. So I'm pretty stoked on that. Of, of, of the Hollywood? Yeah. Of the,
[28:01.040 --> 28:06.560]  the pure Kush. Nice. So yeah. So then now there's a Hollywood pure Kush that is
[28:07.920 --> 28:15.040]  like a more purple Kush type. And so that causes some confusion and that's why people say
[28:15.680 --> 28:19.280]  Topanga. So, you know, the Topanga is not the other Hollywood.
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.840]  Like this is Hollywood and they called it pure Kush or they were like, it's PK. It didn't,
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.400]  they didn't really call it pure Kush. They called it PK. Yeah. That's what we called the cut down
[28:30.400 --> 28:35.440]  in San Diego too, but it was purple Kush. I wonder, I'm really curious to grow it out. Cause
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.920]  I wonder if it would be crazy to see if it's that same cut and it just like went around in a circle
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.400]  and came back to me. It definitely could. I mean, there was a time when my buddy had a hoop up here.
[28:46.400 --> 28:53.760]  Um, my buddy, ancient, ancient future. And he was like, um, he was like, uh, I got this P I got the
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.800]  PK in here and I went and I looked and I'm like, dude, this is not PK. Somebody mixed up your
[28:58.800 --> 29:05.440]  stuff. Like this is, this is, um, this is like more like Bubba or something like that. And they
[29:05.440 --> 29:11.520]  just call it PK. And he was like, I don't know if they said it was called pure Kush. And then
[29:12.160 --> 29:18.400]  later on I was reading a thread when, um, when I think Fletcher was from archive was talking about
[29:18.400 --> 29:24.400]  it. And I was like, you'll know if it's the real PK cause it's musky OG and it's got this sweet
[29:24.400 --> 29:28.800]  kind of like little fruit loop thing in the back that people ascribe as like lime marshmallow,
[29:28.800 --> 29:32.880]  but it smells like kind of fruit loops to me. And he goes, Oh, I know that one. He goes,
[29:32.880 --> 29:37.600]  I've had that one, but he goes, no, we're talking about a different one and it's real special and
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.000]  blah, blah, blah. And I was like, damn it. If I would've known that it wasn't just a fake cut
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.480]  and there was a different cut with the same name, then I would have probably grabbed cuts of it,
[29:46.480 --> 29:51.440]  but it ran right past me. Cause I thought it was just a, a counterfeit and not a, um,
[29:51.440 --> 29:56.720]  and not a one-off, you know? Yeah. Yeah. And then what's, Hey, what's the Testa Rosa?
[29:56.880 --> 30:03.200]  Testa Rosa, dude. I, I don't know. I mean, I think Testa Rosa is like a Royal Skittles.
[30:05.360 --> 30:08.320]  I don't know. Something like that. That probably, that sounds about right.
[30:09.040 --> 30:14.800]  Yeah. I don't, I couldn't remember what it was. Um, yeah, dude, I'm really excited to run, uh,
[30:14.800 --> 30:21.440]  to be, uh, uh, run in that, uh, all this new stuff. So, uh, dude, the, I sent you a bunch of
[30:21.680 --> 30:27.200]  other stuff to the, uh, uh, some blueberry, a bunch of MK ultra crosses. And then, uh,
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.360]  I sent some other stuff to you. I sent the, uh, bull rider times,
[30:31.360 --> 30:37.520]  harijuana, uh, the China writer. Um, I didn't have success popping this. Uh, so maybe you'll
[30:37.520 --> 30:43.040]  have better success. They're really old season. They're from 2001. What did you do when you went
[30:43.040 --> 30:48.480]  to, when you went to a sprouter? You know, I hit, I, uh, I did a seed wash with, uh,
[30:48.560 --> 30:56.400]  uh, amazing doctor enzymes and I, you know, I, I seed washed them and then I rinsed them off.
[30:56.400 --> 31:00.240]  And then I just soaked them, I think for like 24 hours. And then I, uh,
[31:01.200 --> 31:04.800]  stuck them in some paper towels and stuck them in a, a Tupperware.
[31:05.840 --> 31:10.240]  Okay. Yeah. I was just curious. Cause a lot of times people try doing the old
[31:10.240 --> 31:13.680]  seeds and then they don't clean them up and they get attacked real easy. And
[31:13.840 --> 31:20.160]  I had a lot of luck with just, um, cleaning them up, you know, like with peroxide, but,
[31:20.160 --> 31:23.440]  um, enzymes would have done the same thing. You're just trying to kill the
[31:24.080 --> 31:27.440]  bacteria and, and, and fungal funk on the outside and stuff.
[31:28.560 --> 31:33.920]  Yeah. I've had some issues with some older varieties where, uh, as soon as they, uh,
[31:34.480 --> 31:41.360]  as soon as you, uh, hit, as soon as they hit water, there's, uh, there's a lot of
[31:41.360 --> 31:47.760]  water. They're just like a fungus there. And I don't, and it's weird because it's,
[31:47.760 --> 31:52.640]  it seems to be coming from like an endo fight. It seems to be coming internally from the seed
[31:52.640 --> 32:00.400]  because I could sterilize the seed, um, on the outside and it'll still happen.
[32:00.960 --> 32:06.160]  It's really unfortunate cause we had, you know, the Afghani bull rider, which was bull rider by
[32:06.160 --> 32:16.000]  Afghani that my, uh, my, uh, my business partner, um, he created that. And, um, we lost the cut
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.800]  just cause it just aged out and it just started to harm. So nobody, everybody has started getting
[32:20.800 --> 32:28.320]  rid of it. Yeah. And, uh, before it did that though, my, we had a, a friend who was growing
[32:28.320 --> 32:31.680]  a room of it and it hermed out on him. And so he had a bunch of seeds and we're like, well,
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.680]  let's go run through the seed. Maybe we can find something out of it that's stable.
[32:36.480 --> 32:41.520]  But every single one of those seeds just, I couldn't get a single one to pop.
[32:42.080 --> 32:48.320]  Didn't matter what it did. Gibberellic acid. I, I use amino acids. I did sterilization,
[32:48.320 --> 32:52.240]  the combination of everything. It just, everything I tried was just failure.
[32:54.560 --> 32:56.000]  By the way, what was this?
[32:56.000 --> 33:06.400]  Oh, um, I think that was the, I think that was the muggles. Yeah, that was the muggles. I'm not,
[33:06.400 --> 33:12.400]  here's the thing. Uh, some of the stuff that, um, I, uh, got mislabeled in the phenol hunt that I
[33:12.400 --> 33:17.440]  did in the beginning of the year. Um, and this was one of them and I was just running through
[33:17.440 --> 33:23.280]  everything and I had said something to, uh, summer who works at a majestic craft cannabis.
[33:24.160 --> 33:29.680]  Um, and she said she made some Harry Potter reference about muggles or something. Also,
[33:29.680 --> 33:35.680]  that's what we're going to call it. Cause it, I lost the label on it. Um, I'm actually thinking
[33:35.680 --> 33:43.920]  now that it might be the, uh, the, uh, strawberry glue from TH seeds because it has very similar,
[33:43.920 --> 33:49.520]  uh, structure. Uh, but the terpene profile is a little bit different. Actually, this one's
[33:49.520 --> 33:53.920]  different from any of the other thing that was in that room. That one was, uh, it's got this,
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.760]  um, it's not like a blatantly loud, like in your face, like a lot of the stuff I have,
[34:00.320 --> 34:04.880]  the terpene profile is more like deep. Uh, it's like this incense
[34:05.840 --> 34:18.620]  musk that also has a really strong, heavy mint and like a kerosene and they get huge.
[34:19.260 --> 34:21.900]  Are you guys there? I was just, I just, just remember. And, um,
[34:22.620 --> 34:26.380]  when you said muggles, cause it's a, it's a reference from Harry Potter.
[34:27.900 --> 34:31.340]  I had just remembered too. I just Googled it. I, cause I remembered it was a,
[34:31.340 --> 34:38.940]  I thought it was a old jazz tune about weed too. And, uh, and it is, I just, I just checked it out.
[34:38.940 --> 34:44.220]  So that's kind of cool. Double meaning. Sorry. You know, weed slang term. Oh, that's awesome.
[34:44.460 --> 34:47.740]  And I didn't even know that. Yeah. There, here, wait, hold it up. Yeah,
[34:47.740 --> 34:55.180]  now there is lots of old jazz slang about like drugs and, uh, other, yep. There you go. Oh,
[34:55.180 --> 35:03.900]  that's great. You know, I can one up here. Hold on. That's so cool. Yeah. So I guess it fits,
[35:03.900 --> 35:08.780]  you know, that thing produced massive. I went like a, I went nine weeks. Um,
[35:09.100 --> 35:16.220]  they, the, the buds were solid. I mean, they were like, they're all chunky,
[35:16.220 --> 35:21.100]  dude. Everything that's coming out of those rooms, dude, are just insane though, dude. I mean,
[35:21.100 --> 35:27.660]  I'm pulling like, I'm pulling spears that are like, you know, as long as my arm, the, the fronts
[35:27.660 --> 35:34.220]  that I did, which is a watermelon Z kittles times Mac. I found this Fino that smells like, uh,
[35:34.220 --> 35:40.940]  like raspberry cheesecake and a Sprite Berry remix. And it creates these long ass
[35:40.940 --> 35:47.500]  spears, right? And they don't get super thick, but they're super dense, dude. So, uh,
[35:48.220 --> 35:52.300]  I'm super stoked on that. Everything's just really, I'm really stoked on how everything's
[35:52.300 --> 35:56.460]  progressing over at the facility. Cause we're just doing all the science driven,
[35:56.460 --> 36:01.900]  like data driven, uh, input method that I'm doing with the, and then doing the biological.
[36:04.220 --> 36:08.220]  Yeah. The health on everything looks crazy. All your weed looks really good. It's cool to see
[36:08.220 --> 36:13.660]  cause I know how you're doing it, you know? So it's, it's nice to see because it's, um,
[36:14.860 --> 36:20.140]  you know, usually if you see people's stuff is that dialed in, it's a lot easier to dial in when
[36:20.140 --> 36:25.660]  you have only, you know, one ingredient or two ingredients and you're going, okay, we have this
[36:25.660 --> 36:30.380]  salt mix or we have this, or we have that. And I know you're doing everything like live organic
[36:30.380 --> 36:36.220]  and it's still, you know, your stuff stacking up to look like, uh, look like, you know, it's,
[36:36.220 --> 36:41.340]  it's, it's competitive with, with the looks of, um, of something that's on a simple,
[36:41.900 --> 36:47.420]  simple diet and it, uh, and it, you know, knowing what it is, I'm sure your turps are probably
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.380]  hitting too, you know? Yeah. It's really interesting because,
[36:53.820 --> 36:59.100]  you know, I wanted to be able to kind of showcase and show people that you can do numbers in these
[36:59.180 --> 37:06.540]  bio and these living, you know, living soil systems and I'm, and I'm doing it with LEDs as
[37:06.540 --> 37:15.260]  well too. So, um, what, what are you using? Okay. So I'm actually using an old model of HLG
[37:15.260 --> 37:20.780]  horticulture lighting group, but they don't even sell anymore, which is the 550 V2. Um,
[37:20.780 --> 37:27.900]  I think now they have a 600 or 650 that they replaced with that. Um, these things are like
[37:27.900 --> 37:33.100]  fucking gnarly, right? I was doing the CMH, uh, before I got out here and I love that,
[37:33.100 --> 37:37.420]  that full spectrum, they were hitting real hard. Everything was really good. It took me a little
[37:37.420 --> 37:42.620]  while to dial in the system fully because I had to kind of adjust my VPD and temperatures. They
[37:42.620 --> 37:47.980]  had to go a little bit higher for the LED. Um, but once I had that dialed in and the soil is,
[37:48.940 --> 37:57.260]  is all dialed and I'm doing like the biological program that I've kind of, you know, put together,
[37:57.900 --> 38:04.220]  um, you know, like my, my room, like one of those big rooms, it's got 40 of those lights.
[38:04.220 --> 38:14.220]  It's 19,200 Watts, you know, I'm kidding close to 60 pounds. Um, so I'm, I'm getting like the
[38:14.220 --> 38:20.220]  equivalent of what would be like three pounds of light, you know? So it's, it's not up there
[38:20.220 --> 38:24.540]  with some of the dudes that are, that are hitting huge numbers. I know there's some dudes that,
[38:24.540 --> 38:31.500]  that are hitting like three and a half, four. Um, but three is in my opinion, uh, pretty,
[38:31.500 --> 38:38.220]  uh, respectable, um, especially with the, uh, with the numbers on the testing, as far as the
[38:38.220 --> 38:43.740]  terpene tests and the potency and everything goes, because I'm typically sorry, you're saying like
[38:43.740 --> 38:48.780]  three, three per thousand per thousand Watts. That's what, that's kind of like what the
[38:48.780 --> 38:55.900]  adjustment would be. Right. Cause I have a total of 19,200 Watts, but it doesn't, you know,
[38:55.900 --> 39:03.900]  obviously, I mean, obviously it's a, you know, it's all about PPFD and, you know,
[39:03.900 --> 39:09.900]  a spectrum and all that as well. But if we're talking about strictly power consumption, um,
[39:11.100 --> 39:17.740]  I'm, it's a lot more cost effective to create this cannabis because I'm not running a bunch
[39:17.740 --> 39:21.980]  of salt inputs that are costing a bunch of money. I'm literally like, when I buy something,
[39:21.980 --> 39:30.540]  I can buy a 50 pound bag for maybe 15 to like $50, you know, 50 pound bag of gypsum cost me 1399,
[39:31.100 --> 39:39.340]  you know, 50 pound bag of, uh, wall stone, I, you know, calcium silica, it costs me 15 bucks.
[39:39.900 --> 39:45.500]  Yeah. And that stuff is going to last me an entire year. So I can maximize, I can decrease the,
[39:45.580 --> 39:56.700]  you know, the cost of production in one of these systems, um, both with the actual inputs and also
[39:56.700 --> 40:02.460]  with the power consumption. So it's kind of a, you know, when you're taking me into the consider,
[40:02.460 --> 40:07.820]  consideration on, you know, your production costs as far as the lighting and your inputs,
[40:07.820 --> 40:14.220]  and you factor that into your production, I think that, you know, essentially, I think I'm,
[40:14.220 --> 40:19.180]  I should be right on par with a lot of the guys that have these really super dialed in
[40:19.180 --> 40:24.860]  hydro systems. Yeah. It sounds pretty good. I mean, people are usually looking at, okay, what are,
[40:24.860 --> 40:31.660]  what can we get per square foot and per watt? And I've always thought, I mean, depending on
[40:31.660 --> 40:36.060]  your situation, it's different if you're like leasing space or something, but if you have a
[40:36.060 --> 40:42.620]  lot of space, if you can get, if you're getting, if you're doing well per watt, then that's,
[40:42.620 --> 40:48.300]  that's good on your overhead, you know, versus where, you know, people are looking per square
[40:48.300 --> 40:55.100]  foot. It's like in some cases per square foot is really important. Um, but like if you, if you're
[40:55.100 --> 41:01.740]  using a little bit less juice for every square foot and you're getting a little bit less weed
[41:02.460 --> 41:07.820]  and you just have a bigger footprint, um, of where your weed is growing, it's like, it can work out
[41:07.820 --> 41:14.780]  to be more, um, more cost, um, effective, you know, it sounds like you're getting, it sounds
[41:14.780 --> 41:19.980]  like you're getting a good, you're definitely not, you're definitely not having a bad result with the
[41:19.980 --> 41:25.100]  way you're doing it, you know? So that's, you're also not, you're also not flushing a bunch of
[41:25.100 --> 41:30.380]  stuff down a drain all the time going, okay, well, there's all that food going down the drain,
[41:30.380 --> 41:36.060]  you know? And that's the, one of the things, things that I actually focus on. I, I, you know,
[41:36.060 --> 41:43.900]  spend a lot of time, uh, training the employees and not just telling them, not that, not just
[41:43.900 --> 41:49.900]  showing them how to do something, but actually, uh, helping them understand the reasoning behind
[41:49.900 --> 41:55.340]  it. You know? So when I tell my employees, look, we want to saturate these pots, but we don't want
[41:55.340 --> 42:00.140]  runoff, right? Because what happens if we're running anything off, that means we're leaching
[42:00.140 --> 42:05.420]  something out of the system that's going to have to be replaced. So if you guys, you know,
[42:06.380 --> 42:11.260]  so I let them know the function and the reason, and, um, it's been working really well because
[42:11.260 --> 42:15.740]  I've been able to kind of take more of a backseat over the last couple months as, uh, they've been
[42:15.740 --> 42:23.260]  able to kind of, um, just take my instruction and I can just kind of direct. Yeah, that's nice.
[42:23.980 --> 42:29.100]  So, and, and the way you're doing it too, you wind up getting, you wind up being able to reuse your,
[42:29.100 --> 42:35.180]  all your, your dirt, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just literally, um, I'm cutting everything down.
[42:35.180 --> 42:39.740]  We pull all the pots off of the tables. We scrub all the tables down real well.
[42:40.460 --> 42:48.380]  Um, we sanitize the rooms when we really pot, um, in the same, in the same soil. Uh, I use a lot of
[42:48.380 --> 42:55.900]  biologicals. Uh, I'm not sure if you listened to that biological crops during episode that we did
[42:55.900 --> 43:01.980]  a couple of weeks ago. Um, but I talk about a lot of the different biological programs and the
[43:01.980 --> 43:07.900]  different microbial consortiums that I'm using, and I'm using the, uh, effective microorganisms,
[43:07.900 --> 43:15.420]  the bacillus subtilis, uh, the, all the different bacillus strains, uh, along with the Saccharomyces
[43:15.420 --> 43:21.500]  vica and the right up Pseudomonas. And then I'm also doing the Trichoderma bacillus subtilis combo.
[43:21.500 --> 43:26.860]  And then, uh, the Boveria bacillana, which is for like integrated pest management. So there's
[43:26.860 --> 43:32.060]  all these different, uh, biologicals that I'm using that are dual purpose. Some of them help
[43:32.060 --> 43:38.540]  cycle nutrients. Uh, some of them are, uh, going to outcompete pathogens. Um, and then, you know,
[43:38.540 --> 43:46.690]  the benefits from the metabolites that they produce. Yeah, that's cool, man. Cause I see
[43:46.690 --> 43:54.610]  people are really getting it dialed in, um, with using like cocoa and stuff like that to the point
[43:54.610 --> 43:59.810]  where they're like, no, no runoff. We just let them, we let them and we use, and we use lower,
[44:00.770 --> 44:07.170]  they're using lower, um, dosages of all the food, but then they're letting them dry down further,
[44:07.170 --> 44:11.490]  which is like, you know, if you know, even in the situation you are like, you let something get too
[44:11.490 --> 44:17.650]  dry, all of a sudden it's like you're overfeeding. So you can, you can do that intentionally and go,
[44:17.650 --> 44:22.130]  okay, we let them dry down further. They'll get more out. Then you get more paying for your buck.
[44:22.130 --> 44:26.210]  Then there's no runoff and all that stuff. But when they're all done, when they're using salts,
[44:26.210 --> 44:31.810]  they're taking all, they're taking all of that, um, all of that, whatever they're growing in
[44:32.370 --> 44:36.850]  rock, wool, cocoa or whatever. And then they're throwing it all away and then they're going and
[44:36.850 --> 44:42.530]  they're buying more. So then when you look at it, you go, okay, well, organics is a little bit more.
[44:42.530 --> 44:46.610]  It's a little bit more of a pain in the ass. It might cost more money in certain ways,
[44:46.610 --> 44:52.690]  but then you go, yeah, but you have soil and you're keeping your soil like it's, like it's
[44:52.690 --> 44:57.490]  little, little chunks of land in your grow. Like you're actually holding onto it and you don't ever
[44:57.490 --> 45:04.130]  buy any more. And like, I've always liked that. Like I was able to grow for, I don't know what I
[45:04.130 --> 45:10.290]  was growing for, like $15 a pound or something at one point. And without being like just planting
[45:10.290 --> 45:15.570]  straight in the ground and putting water on it, if you have like fertile soil outside, like I was
[45:15.570 --> 45:21.250]  growing in pots and I was going the whole year and I was like, I don't know. And I think I spent like
[45:21.250 --> 45:26.770]  $1,400 on food or something. And then I had all this weed and I'm going, well, what, what is this
[45:26.770 --> 45:31.970]  costing? $13 a pound to produce or something. And that's outdoor. So you're not figuring in cost of
[45:31.970 --> 45:37.170]  everything else, but the way you're doing it indoor is you're paying for electricity costs.
[45:37.170 --> 45:44.610]  And then you still have this low food cost, which to me seems pretty cool. And you're not creating
[45:44.610 --> 45:50.530]  a shitload of waste, you know, because that's like all essentially winds up being landfill.
[45:50.530 --> 45:54.530]  I mean, it doesn't have to be, it could be used in a better way, but I'm sure that's what's mostly
[45:54.530 --> 45:58.850]  happening is that's just getting thrown away and something new is getting pulled in, you know?
[45:59.490 --> 46:05.970]  So that's costing, that's overall cost too, because it's, you know, as far as when you look
[46:05.970 --> 46:11.490]  at the big picture cost of like the environmental impacts and just resource usage in general, you know?
[46:12.210 --> 46:17.650]  Yeah. And one of the things that I like to do is try to decrease that footprint as best I can
[46:17.650 --> 46:22.050]  and being able to kind of close different loops in the systems, like reusing soil,
[46:23.010 --> 46:30.050]  not having water runoff. And then also I know that you're really familiar with probiotics. If
[46:30.050 --> 46:35.650]  I remember correctly, Alan Atkinson's your neighbor. He's another big Bokashi guy and
[46:36.930 --> 46:41.410]  he talks about a lot of solid state fermentation stuff. And that's kind of what I'm doing at the
[46:41.410 --> 46:46.850]  facility too, because you can take that green waste, you can mulch it up and you can do a
[46:46.850 --> 46:53.970]  solid state fermentation on that and you can reuse that as a biological input. And what's
[46:53.970 --> 47:00.210]  really interesting is because the way that the laws are written out here in Oklahoma, you can
[47:00.210 --> 47:04.690]  compost your material and we have a processing license, we're vertically integrated, so I can
[47:04.690 --> 47:12.610]  process that material and use it. What I typically do, I'll take green waste from pruning, I'll mulch
[47:12.690 --> 47:20.290]  that up, I'll do a fermentation with it. And at the beginning of a cycle, when I do a transplant
[47:20.290 --> 47:28.370]  on the soil, I'll do an inoculation with that input. Yeah. And I've been wondering about the,
[47:29.330 --> 47:36.290]  you know, because when you look at like one of the big issues, you know, at least in California now
[47:36.290 --> 47:47.650]  is like with the viroid, with the HLV. Yeah. So I've been wondering, like I know that that can be
[47:49.090 --> 47:54.770]  transmitted through tissue. And I look at like when people just like chop and drop stuff back
[47:54.770 --> 48:00.610]  in the beds and I'm like, okay, well, if you did have an infection, then that could be an issue.
[48:00.610 --> 48:09.330]  But I'm curious to see studies of like when you actually take that and compost it and
[48:12.050 --> 48:17.810]  if that can be broken down, because I mean, the reality, I'm not exactly sure what type of
[48:17.810 --> 48:22.610]  proteins those are made of. I know they're kind of novel in comparison to the stuff we're used to.
[48:23.170 --> 48:32.610]  Most things by through like some type of enzyme action can be broken down. It actually
[48:33.170 --> 48:40.770]  completely actually takes apart the proteins and now they don't have the same, there's no DNA left.
[48:41.970 --> 48:49.170]  But I'm wondering about, I'm curious about it, if there's any risk to that. But I'd like to see
[48:49.890 --> 48:54.690]  somebody do studies intentionally where they go, okay, we got this one, it's tested, infected,
[48:54.690 --> 49:00.530]  and now we're going to go ahead and inoculate it with these species and see how it breaks it down.
[49:00.530 --> 49:06.930]  Because it seems like even maybe if it's not any old composting thing, it seems like there's got to
[49:06.930 --> 49:16.530]  be some type of process that would neutralize that. Because just because of the nature of how
[49:17.410 --> 49:22.930]  certain enzymes work on proteins. Yeah, no, it makes perfect sense. And it's actually a really
[49:22.930 --> 49:31.170]  valid point. And it's one of the things that Nelson Lindsay, Pottery Plant was talking about
[49:32.210 --> 49:37.170]  not too long ago about, if you're taking wild plants from an outdoor setting,
[49:38.370 --> 49:44.930]  you're not, it's a guessing game if you're using those to make something as a natural input,
[49:44.930 --> 49:50.770]  whether it be like a top dress or mulch or a ferment, because nobody really knows
[49:52.370 --> 49:58.290]  if there's a pathogen association or viral association with those inputs that could
[49:59.250 --> 50:05.970]  potentially be introduced into one of these biological systems and then kind of you inoculate
[50:06.770 --> 50:12.450]  your system with that. It would be interesting, I guess, if anybody was going to do that type of
[50:12.450 --> 50:17.970]  research, it would probably be someone like myself. It would be really difficult to,
[50:20.530 --> 50:24.850]  it would require a lot of, I think, a laboratory equipment, genetic testing.
[50:24.850 --> 50:30.530]  And you'd have to be testing initially with your initial stuff. You'd have to have intentionally
[50:30.530 --> 50:36.130]  infected stuff. And then you'd have to be able to test it after it had gone through the process.
[50:36.130 --> 50:41.410]  And you'd have to be able to repeat it a lot. But it probably wouldn't be really that much to figure
[50:41.410 --> 50:46.850]  out. And maybe just us bullshitting about it right now might set somebody to doing that. Because
[50:46.850 --> 50:50.770]  sometimes there's people who are like, oh, that sounds like a cool experiment. I don't have
[50:50.770 --> 50:55.250]  anything to lose in this particular spot over here, whatever. Maybe somebody can check it out.
[50:55.250 --> 51:00.530]  But I just had questions about that. Because after learning about it, I'm like, wow, it's scary shit.
[51:01.330 --> 51:07.890]  But they also say that a lot of times, I mean, you know, they call it latent for a reason,
[51:07.970 --> 51:14.290]  because you don't actually see it in a lot of cases. So I wonder, too, I mean, nobody knows
[51:14.290 --> 51:20.690]  that for sure, because of the way everything is set up in the routine of everybody's cultivation.
[51:22.770 --> 51:28.210]  It might not even be an issue in a system like yours, even if it was introduced. Nobody really
[51:28.210 --> 51:33.570]  knows that yet. Because we know that it can be a big issue in some cases. But it might be one of
[51:33.570 --> 51:40.690]  those things where it's like, oh, well, if you have a big healthy system going on, it might be
[51:40.690 --> 51:48.290]  kind of being deconstructed as everything's happening in the first place. I don't think
[51:48.290 --> 51:57.090]  anybody's done enough controlled analysis of everything that's going on to know what's the
[51:57.090 --> 52:02.930]  reason why sometimes nobody sees it for years and years. And then all of a sudden, somebody gets the
[52:02.930 --> 52:09.250]  same material, puts out these big grows of clones, and then all of a sudden, everything is dotted,
[52:09.250 --> 52:15.010]  you know? So like, it's a real weird kind of mysterious thing. But it is kind of a boogie
[52:15.010 --> 52:20.930]  man. When I look at it, I'm like, oh, shit, I don't. I'm afraid to just chop everything down
[52:20.930 --> 52:27.890]  and put it all over here with this and then put it back on there. It raises questions.
[52:28.450 --> 52:33.570]  You actually bring up a really valid point, too. So when you're talking about, you know,
[52:33.570 --> 52:38.530]  just chopping, dropping, and putting stuff right back into the soil system. So I was doing crop
[52:38.530 --> 52:46.290]  cover, which is, it has a lot of benefits in it. And it's great for the soil. But when you're
[52:46.290 --> 52:52.370]  doing things at scale, it's more work than it's worth. And it creates kind of more issues than
[52:52.370 --> 52:59.730]  it's really worth. So in the same with, you know, chopping and dropping, right? Just dropping all
[52:59.730 --> 53:05.090]  your leaves on the top of your soil, because what ends up happening is those leaves just kind of
[53:05.090 --> 53:10.450]  half decompose, some of them mold, some turn to slime. And then, you know, there's,
[53:11.970 --> 53:18.290]  it just, unless you're, unless you can take the time to sit there and mulch that all up into
[53:18.290 --> 53:26.450]  tiny pieces and then redistribute over, evenly over all the pots, it just, it just seems to be
[53:27.090 --> 53:33.810]  more of a hassle at scale, like I'm doing. So my, my, because I was doing that at first,
[53:33.810 --> 53:38.290]  and then it just was like, you know, I'm spending too much time. So I've, it, there's been a learning
[53:38.290 --> 53:44.770]  curve when it comes to dialing in the system. Some things that I was taught would work,
[53:44.770 --> 53:51.730]  you know, to do doesn't work as well at scale. And, you know, I've kind of adjusted some of the
[53:51.730 --> 54:00.130]  things that I am doing. So that way I can get maximum efficiency and maximum production.
[54:01.170 --> 54:06.530]  And that's kind of like, dude, it took a little while, you know, to get everything dialed in with
[54:06.530 --> 54:14.610]  my first, you know, being the first system with LEDs that I ran. And, you know, just,
[54:15.170 --> 54:21.730]  again, just scaling organics to make it to where it is able to produce continuously.
[54:27.020 --> 54:31.660]  Yeah. Can you see that? Mean gene is reverse aging.
[54:31.740 --> 54:39.740]  Yeah. The curious case of Benjamin Buttons. I'm going to be a baby soon and then they're going to
[54:39.740 --> 54:41.740]  take my underling.
[54:44.540 --> 54:49.420]  Someone's going to be wiping your bum for you soon. That's a, it's a, it's not a bad age to be.
[54:51.420 --> 54:57.020]  My two year old still gets her, my six year old gets her bum wiped by me at the, she does a couple
[54:57.500 --> 55:02.140]  of wipes herself and I got to finish it off.
[55:02.140 --> 55:09.020]  Yeah. I got another 10 or 15 years on me before they got it. I'm still holding it down, you know.
[55:12.480 --> 55:19.840]  Um, you know, I, I always do the, like the cheap home grow podcast and I always get so many
[55:19.840 --> 55:27.680]  questions, you know, people love information, um, in education. What, what do you think, uh,
[55:27.680 --> 55:34.960]  maybe some good methods for, uh, germinating, uh, like maybe older seeds other than, you know,
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.360]  some of the stuff we talked about and maybe, uh, have you had any experience with like seed
[55:39.360 --> 55:45.120]  tracking to help germination rates or is there any other little secrets, tips that might help
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.800]  some of the other people if they run into issues popping seeds?
[55:49.920 --> 55:57.680]  Uh, so seed cracking is an interesting one. Um, I, at one point it, I hadn't really heard of
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.160]  anybody doing it, but I saw kind of what was going on with the seeds and I was like, well,
[56:02.160 --> 56:08.000]  they just don't seem to have enough energy to really come out. And so I started actually just
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.840]  biting the seeds, like along the seam, just to just hear them to just pop and then put them back
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.120]  in. And I did that. It was like, I tried, I think I tried a hundred seeds and nothing happened. And
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.200]  then I tried a hundred seeds, nothing happened. And then I did that and I got like five or six
[56:23.200 --> 56:30.000]  plants to come out of a hundred. And I was like, well, that's not like great, um, numbers to be
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.400]  able to analyze and know, was that just an anomaly or what, but it was the same seeds.
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.040]  And I went through these, they didn't do anything. Then I went through these and they did something.
[56:39.040 --> 56:47.840]  And then, um, I saw, uh, up here, uh, 2020 Mendocino, um, seeds posted a little study where they went
[56:47.840 --> 56:53.200]  ahead and, you know, they showed that like, look, we use the seed cracker. It does, you know, you get a
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.360]  little bit more plants. Um, and I was like, okay, well that's kind of in line with what I saw. And,
[56:59.360 --> 57:07.120]  um, so I think that there's something to that. You really have to know, um, what the difference is
[57:07.120 --> 57:12.800]  between crushing your seeds and just popping the seam. The seam wants to pop. It's not that strong.
[57:12.800 --> 57:18.080]  I mean, on some seeds that aren't the greatest too, it'll pop really easy. Um, but, but you just
[57:18.080 --> 57:23.600]  want that, you just want that seam where the two halves meet just right along the edge right here
[57:23.600 --> 57:28.880]  to just kind of just open up a little bit. And then that way the tail doesn't use all this energy.
[57:28.960 --> 57:36.880]  And then trying to swell inside the seed, there's a little, basically a bag and that is around the
[57:36.880 --> 57:42.560]  germ and it goes like this and it swells with water. And basically it's like a bladder and pops
[57:42.560 --> 57:49.600]  it. And, um, that combined with the fact that the German side wants to stretch its tail,
[57:50.560 --> 57:57.040]  makes it actually open. So, you know, anything you can do to get those two things to happen
[57:57.040 --> 58:04.320]  more is going to help it. So if you can pop it, then it doesn't have to, um, you know, it doesn't
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.720]  have to use quite as much of its energy towards that. And maybe it can just grow a little bit
[58:08.720 --> 58:15.680]  better. It's kind of idea. And it does seem to work. Um, for me, what I found is really important.
[58:15.680 --> 58:21.440]  And I'm actually thinking about like, you can use a heating mat, but it's really hard to know
[58:21.440 --> 58:28.400]  exactly what temperature the actual location of your seed in the soil is. Like I kind of think that
[58:29.520 --> 58:35.040]  seeds would rather be in soil to germinate if it's going to take them a long time,
[58:35.040 --> 58:40.400]  because it's just more natural. It's not really natural to be in a paper towel.
[58:41.280 --> 58:46.640]  Um, so you want them to be in soil, but once they're in soil, you really want that soil to be
[58:46.640 --> 58:56.400]  between like 78 and 82 degrees as far as I can tell. And, um, if, you know, like you can have a,
[58:56.400 --> 59:02.080]  you can have a, uh, you know, a heating pad with a thermostat probe and put that in there in the
[59:02.080 --> 59:07.040]  dirt, but is that exactly the same? And then is it picking up the temperature at the bottom or the top
[59:07.040 --> 59:12.480]  of the soil? And you kind of don't know. So I was thinking it would be kind of cool actually to have,
[59:13.200 --> 59:20.880]  um, to go ahead and repurpose an incubator that you would use for, um, like reptile or bird eggs
[59:21.680 --> 59:28.800]  and make it so you could have a completely controlled, like 80 degrees nonstop or 82 or
[59:28.800 --> 59:36.240]  whatever, you know, you want it to be for those seeds. Um, and then I think the really, really
[59:36.240 --> 59:44.320]  crucial thing is the sterilizing of the seeds. And, um, I I've had some smart buddies of mine to,
[59:44.880 --> 59:52.960]  um, say maybe you don't want to sterilize them. Maybe you want to actually inoculate them
[59:52.960 --> 59:58.400]  with something that can outcompete any type of bacteria or fungal infection that they might want
[59:58.400 --> 01:00:04.160]  to pick up from their shell. Or like you said, that might actually be inside. Um,
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.160]  but I've noticed that I was thinking, uh, the there's the, the trichoderma and that
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:17.920]  bacillus subtilis, I think is a great combination to, uh, help, uh, would be, I think a really good
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.400]  combination for seed germination. It's something that I, that I'm going to, I'm going to try out
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.560]  because I actually have some trichoderma right here. Um, uh, and you know, what's crazy speaking
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:36.160]  about incubators, I actually have mycology and bacterial incubators at the facility. Um, because
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:41.680]  one of the owners, he's been in the, uh, the pharmaceutical business for like 30 years
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.360]  and he's run labs all over and he had a bunch of equipment that was owed to him. So I ended up
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.440]  putting it there and it's the only thing I've used it in there just to see the viability of some of
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.480]  the spores that I get. So I'll get some petri dishes, put down a little bit of spore and then,
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.480]  uh, culture them to see how, uh, how quickly they, uh, they culture. So it'd be curious to
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.960]  see that I could do that. I could put pots in there and, uh, yeah. And then, I mean,
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:20.240]  the other option too, I'm saying like in, in soil, um, but the, the reality of, of being in soil too
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:27.040]  is, um, if you're going to have, once you have them in that situation, you can kind of go to more
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.000]  of a, of a tissue culture side and go ahead and go, okay, well, if you already have the nice,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.520]  if you already have that set up there and it's already set up where you're doing, you're used to
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:43.600]  putting, uh, test tubes and petri dishes in there for, uh, mycology stuff. Um, then, you know, you,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.520]  you could also experiment with using, using some, some, some type of media and they're more
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:59.040]  like auger or a different type of gel like that, that has hormones. And, um, you know, that's the,
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.960]  that's the deal with like people who pop stuff, people pop seeds in a tissue culture environment
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:11.280]  too. And you could see like, what's a good recipe. The bigger challenge I've seen people discuss with
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.280]  that is that you need to have, um, the right recipe because you don't know exactly what the
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.720]  needs are, but what's cool about that is as opposed to soil where you go, okay, we got some cool stuff
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:30.560]  in the soil. You can put basically the, the, the, the plant version of antibiotics, whatever those
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:38.480]  chemicals are, I'm not familiar. And then you can put, um, you know, carbohydrates and hormones in
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:45.360]  there so that you can really, really make them, um, go for it. And as far as I can tell, that's
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:52.720]  the best way to really, to sprout seeds. And then what I'm really looking for, um, and I have a
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.800]  couple of people who have, um, contacted me about it, but I haven't been able to get it, anything
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:06.000]  solidified is, is to be able to actually take the seed, cut it open, like you cut open a mushroom
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.680]  and take some of the cells, culture those cells into a callus, and then hit those with the right
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.960]  hormones to be able to bring them back that way. And it's a lot of work because after you do all
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.000]  that and you've got this culture in these, you know, you got these different plates of this callus,
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.600]  um, that's one plant, you know what I mean? So it's like, okay, now when you're trying to bring
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.440]  back these old seeds, ideally, you're going to want to do that with as many of the seeds as you
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:38.080]  can. You're going to want at least a dozen or a hundred or something. So, you know, it's a,
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.080]  it's a pain in the ass. And of course, when you start, you know, you you've dealt with plates.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.920]  So the deal with it is when you're doing it, it's like, okay, well, okay, here's good. And, and now
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.480]  you need to do a transfer because you have some contamination. Eventually you get a clean culture
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:56.560]  and you're doing that for the one plant. So with some stuff, it's really good, especially if it's
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.920]  really true breeding. Um, but with other stuff, it wouldn't be so practical, but that's like the,
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:09.440]  the, the Holy grail that I'm looking for to pull out like my original, um, black lime seeds that
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:16.640]  I crossed with the PK that got crossed with the CDSR to make black lime reserve, or to pull out
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.280]  the original, like big blue cross, big, big red or black athi cross big red, or some of the really
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.240]  cool things that I had that just got a little bit too old. Like I can pop them in their tail,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.200]  will poke out and they're pearly white and they're hard and they're still nice. And they're not,
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:41.040]  they're not shot, but they don't have enough, um, energy of carbohydrates and hormones.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:49.760]  Yeah. I, I, you know, we have some pretty cool lab equipment and it's pretty much not,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.520]  you know, being used because I'm not, I don't really have a technical background in, uh,
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:03.840]  you know, the lab science, uh, you know, being a grower. Um, but you know, it's one of the things
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.520]  that I hope that I I'm able to learn because especially when I'm doing pheno hunts and stuff,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.760]  if I want to put something aside, or if I have a variety that I want to hold on to without having
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.520]  to, you know, have a mom that just can, you know, like I have moms, you know, and it's like,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.880]  I have to cut these things before it's even time for me to like clone them because they just get
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:31.040]  out of control all the times, you know? So being able to have a tissue culture would be, uh,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.960]  you know, a little less of a headache when it comes to preserving genetics.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.360]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, Jackson, do you see that one?
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:49.120]  Best seed preservation techniques? I mean, if basically the, the, the, the two key things to
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:57.040]  preserve seeds is you want cool and dry. So, and dark. So however you can keep your seeds in the
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:04.240]  dark and keep them cool and dry, um, it's, it's kind of up to you to figure out what that really
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:12.320]  means. But, um, for me, like if you can, if you can basically take like, you know, a nice Mason jar
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:20.560]  and put some type of desiccant in there. Um, I mean, I've used rice. I have like poppy seeds
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.640]  that are 20 years old that still come up like a hundred percent and they're just big poppy heads
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.040]  in a Mason jar with a handful of rice in them. And those are 20 years old and they're still a
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:38.240]  hundred percent. Um, uh, poppy seeds keep really well, those small seeds, it seems to keep better
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.280]  because they don't have as much oil in them. So they're not as likely to go rancid. Um,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.920]  cannabis seeds have a lot of oil in them and so they can go rancid easy. And that's one of the
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.160]  ways that I kind of have checked over the years. Like if someone has some seeds and they're like,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.200]  do you think maybe these might still be viable? You can actually eat the seed. And if it still
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.320]  tastes like a fresh sunflower seed, you know, it's good. If it tastes like old stale oil,
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.200]  then you know that it's not. And a lot of times those seeds will have kind of a, a dark look
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.760]  on them. Like they're stained from the inside out. And you can just tell that it rancid, you know?
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:20.560]  Um, if they're not rancid, then it pretty, pretty much, you know, pretty, you, you can tell when you
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.800]  pop them open, if they're still curly white and nice and they look like it's like still something
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:35.920]  that's alive, it's probably alive. Um, but, um, yeah, I mean, it, it, uh, it just is all about,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.600]  you know, keeping them cold and dry. I mean, they planted, I think the oldest seeds planted
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.160]  were something about 27 years, 27,000 years old. And they were from like the, from like a frozen,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.160]  uh, a frozen nest from like a ground squirrel or something like that. I mean, this is,
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.200]  this is, this is, this is vaguely accurate. You know what I mean? I don't know if this is
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:06.000]  exactly what it was, but it was like, uh, basically a place that had been frozen for all that time.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:12.320]  And they were able to go in and it's, I think it's a species of lupine and they got these seeds out
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.200]  and they were able to put them in a lab. And I think they probably used like test tubes and,
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:23.520]  and like, uh, some type of a gel, like auger or whatever they use for that. And they were able to
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:31.360]  bring those back in there, you know, over 25,000 years old. Um, and the, the, the thing about it
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.680]  was, was they were very cold and they managed to stay dry because of where they were at. And because
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:43.600]  below freezing, everything is, is dry in general because of the nature of what extreme cold, um,
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:51.440]  does because it, it's its own desiccant. But, um, that really it's, you know, like knowing those
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.760]  things that, okay, the warmer they are and the moister they are, the less likely they are to
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.200]  survive. The cooler they are and the drier they are, the more likely they are to survive. So you
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:09.280]  want to keep them cool and dry in the dark. And that can be done in a jar that can be done in any
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.240]  kind of airtight container. Um, if you have the perfect freezer conditions, you might not even
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.040]  need an airtight container, but you might as well have an airtight container since the conditions in
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:27.040]  a freezer or a fridge can, you know, sometimes thaw out or whatever. Um, and then I don't like
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.640]  to freeze the seeds because I know my power might go out. I might not, you know, I might,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.880]  my generator might not work when my power goes out or whatever. So I don't want them to freeze
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.760]  and thaw and freeze and thaw and freeze and thaw. I don't have any evidence to say that's bad. It
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:49.920]  just doesn't sound good to me. So I keep my seeds in the high thirties, um, in the fridge. And the
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:10:00.160]  way I do that is I have a thermostat to it and the pro and then I turn the thermostat to be
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.040]  just below 40 basically. And that way I know they're as cold as can be without freezing.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.040]  Um, and that was just based on getting some seeds. I got some seeds that were from the end
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.960]  of the nineties a couple of years ago. So they were a good solid 20 years old and they had been
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:23.680]  in a cellar in London and they popped a hundred percent like they were brand new seeds and they
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.600]  had never been frozen. They weren't in the fridge. The only thing was they had never got hot.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.400]  So I figure if you can keep seeds for 20 years and the only thing about them is they didn't
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:39.040]  get hot. And it's gotta be, um, it's gotta work just to, just to keep them cold, you know? So I
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.080]  figure a fridge is, um, better than freezing and thawing and freezing and thawing, you know?
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.320]  So this is a question from a while back, but Riley was persistent. So
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.960]  was black lime reserve the result of a pheno hunt or a lucky find? So the trippy thing about that
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:09.280]  was I had, um, years ago, I have a buddy and him and his, him and his family, um, his dad in
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:19.200]  particular was a really big successful grower. And he had really cool seed stock from a guy
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.400]  who was like a really heavy duty breeder in the early eighties. And I mean, like this guy was
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.840]  like, he had all this different stuff and he lime breaded all and got, he made all these different
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:39.280]  things and really predictable performance and, um, basically cleaned up land graces, you know?
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:46.480]  And he always talked about these few things. He had one called the spice, one called the lime,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.480]  one that he called the P4. Um, and the P4 wasn't like there's a, there's a water crystal they call
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.960]  P4, but it was, uh, it was the, the, the one, two, three, four was the different picks. And so it'd be
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.960]  like, there was the first pick of the year, the second pick of the year. And like the fourth
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.200]  strain they would cut down would be that fourth one. So then there's the P4. So like spice, lime, P4,
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.680]  the airport he had, he was like, ah, that one blah, blah, blah. So there's all these different things.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.040]  And when he talked about the lime, I was always like, man, the lime, that just sounds good to me
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.800]  for some reason, you know, it was one of these things that I wanted to see and I never saw it.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:36.880]  And I got some seeds from him that he dug up. And, um, so, uh, I grew his seeds and I didn't find
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.920]  anything. I found one thing that I was like, oh, that's kinda, that's kinda limey and nice. And it's
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.560]  actually kind of similar, kind of similar to what I later found that was the lime. But from the same,
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.560]  probably the same gene pool, I can't say for sure, but it was a neighborhood. Like in, in the old
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.640]  days, things were really tight and there wasn't like a lot, it wasn't like now where you're like,
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.880]  oh, there's all this and there's all that. And it was like, you know, this is early 80s stuff. So
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.440]  it was before the seed bank sent stuff back from Amsterdam. Um, it's all the stuff that like
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:19.200]  Amsterdam got, um, to make all the stuff that later got re-imported here to be what was the
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:27.200]  second wave of stuff in the nineties. And, um, so there's a likelihood the lime I found might
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.680]  have been related to the lime he had just because of the circle of people. So I ended up getting
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:40.160]  these seeds and I grew them and there was a lot of really cool stuff in them, but I got this one
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:47.840]  plant and it smelled like, like Thai lime. It was like just this crazy, um, really, really bomb
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:58.400]  lime smell that I really loved. And, um, I seeded it and, um, I, that when I had that plant, I
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.880]  labeled it, uh, it was, it was smelled, it was the one that smelled like lime out of all these females
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:11.920]  I grew. And, um, the leaves all turned black. So I just labeled it black lime. And what it got
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.120]  seeded with was this old other thing that I had. And that's a whole other story, but I ended up
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:26.480]  taking the, um, the seeds out of the plant that was labeled black lime and I grew them and I ended up,
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.320]  um, getting killer stuff out of that. And I ended up taking one male out of it that really had the
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:39.440]  smell I wanted and putting it on that same Hollywood piercush clone that I got. And out of
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:48.080]  that came a plant that I called lime one, because it was the PK, cross black lime number one. And,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.520]  um, I had that and I grew it and it was really killer. And then what ended up happening was when
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:02.160]  I saw, um, the weed in a jar that was the, um, chem dog special reserve from aficionado, I told,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.960]  um, I told Leo, I go, wow, look at this. I go, look, you can drop this, this jar that you had
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.080]  that one in the cup. You could drop a butt of this in and it looks the same. And I was like, you know,
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.120]  that would be a cool cross. And he was like, oh yeah, let's cross it. And so he gave me some of
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:24.160]  the pollen and I put it onto my clone that I'd had for a while. And, um, for a couple of years
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:33.520]  and the original black lime stuff before the PK and the PK cross, that was all like 2002, 2003,
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.560]  the original lime seed that I actually popped. I'd had those for a long time. I pulled those
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:49.680]  out of shake in, um, like 97 or 96 or something, 97 and maybe 98, I think 97. And so that was,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.320]  that, that was what it is. So it wasn't like, um, it wasn't just like, uh, um, the initial
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.600]  lime flavor was a lucky find, but it was something I'd been looking for for years.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.520]  And I was going through those seeds, kind of hoping I might find some of those old,
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.520]  more legendary things from our old neighborhood. And, um, that was, that was really what the,
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.880]  the black lime reserve, um, came from was out of those.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.400]  I'm glad that I have the, uh, the, the lineage on that. Cause I, I'm always curious, you know,
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.080]  whenever I'm growing something now, always want to know like, where'd this come from? How'd this
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:45.280]  get like this? You know? Yeah. It's neat. The history. Oh, cool. And then over the years,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.800]  like I thought it was one thing over the years I got, um, I got more, I got more and more of
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:59.200]  the story as I went. So it was like, initially I was like, Oh, this is Heath's weed. And then I
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:06.480]  like asked him and he was like, ah, it's like a Northern lights, Afghani. And then I was like,
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:12.640]  Oh, what's, what's this stuff? And the guy, Oh, it's the oil can. And then after a while,
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.880]  it was like, well, what did these guys have? You know? And then I talked to people in the
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:24.160]  neighborhood and it's like, Oh, well that was the oil can. That was actually that old Afghani
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.320]  Wahakon cross. And then I was like, Oh, well that makes sense. Cause I remember when it was being
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:34.160]  grown out pure, you get the big, tall green one that smells like turpentine. And you get the
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.480]  little stout one, those little stout purple one that smells like an Afghani Kush thing.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.440]  And then you get the mix of both of them where you get the tall purple one that smells like a
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.400]  Kush and you get the short green one that smells like turpentine and everything in between. You
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:56.320]  could really clearly see those two sides. And then the smell that came out of it, um, was what a
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.960]  couple old timers who now would be like 80 years old when they smelled the weed I have that smelled
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.000]  like that from other stuff, which was like turpentine. And they're like, Oh, that's the
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.560]  Wahakon. And I'm like, Oh really? This is what Wahakon smelled like. They're like, Oh dude. And
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:16.240]  whatever. And 74 or whatever, that was like the first stuff I remember that really would knock
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.520]  you on your ass. And I have these big, huge seeds and there's like, you know, you, you see like from
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.000]  the old timers, you can show them a bud and they tell you, this is what that's like. And so then
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.080]  like you, you build and you build. And so then I was like, okay, so now I know the oil can is really,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:41.200]  um, is really Wahakon Afghani and the oil cans, the Afghani smell and the stoil or the less toil
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:49.760]  that is the turpentine side, which is the Wahakon side of the smell. And then, um, then I talked to
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.480]  my buddy and he's like, Oh, I talked to Heath. And he said, you know, that, that, that's not just,
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:19:00.080]  um, Afghani Northern. It has Burmese in it too. So then I, he's like in my house and I asked him,
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.280]  I'm like, what is, what is, what, what's the story with that? And he's like, Oh, well, I got it from,
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.800]  I was working with, I was working with this dude. And then I'm like, in the Northern lights,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:15.280]  where did that come from? And he's like, Oh, that came from Jerome. And, um, you know, like, uh,
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.600]  and I'm like, Oh shit. I know, I know Jerome's son. Uh, he's on Instagram, uh, base to the face.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:29.120]  Like, um, I'm like, Oh, well that's crazy because now all of a sudden I know this story and it all
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:34.640]  ties together. And all this took 20 years to know the real story. But as you get more interested in
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:40.320]  stuff, stuff unravels and then you find out like, Oh, okay. So then you go, okay. What smelled like
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:47.840]  lime, that citrusy exotic thing was probably coming from the Burmese that was in the Burmese
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.000]  Northern lights, Afghani cross. And on the other side, you have Afghani Northern lights,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.640]  Wahakian, the Northern lights on one side from Jerome, the Northern lights on the other side
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:03.520]  from my mom. And so like, you know, it, it all added up to be like, Oh, okay. Well then that's
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:12.080]  what that is. And so just for clarification, the black lime is Northern lights, oil can cross
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:22.320]  Northern lights, uh, Burmese Afghani. And then the black lime reserve is that crossed with PK.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:28.160]  And then the PK black lime crossed with the Chemdoc special reserve, you know, and the lime
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.880]  turps what's crazy is like when you hear somebody talking about something, they go, Oh, it's dominant.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.160]  You go, okay. If it's a dominant trait, that means there's lots of them in the mix, but that's not
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.760]  what it actually means. It actually means for something to be dominant means when you breed with
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:51.840]  that particular plant with that trait, it'll come through, but it doesn't mean that it's super
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.280]  frequent. So I took something that was super, super rare where you could grow hundreds of plants,
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:06.160]  maybe, and not get a true lime. But once you seed the true lime, now out of it, you get lots of the
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:13.360]  true lime because it's dominant. And now, now you can take something like lime or Rilla and you can
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:20.560]  plant that and get tons of lime in it. It's way more common now, even though it's only a 30 second
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:26.400]  lime or something, it's this tiny amount of lime in it, but there's tons of lime in, in the, in the
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.480]  progeny. Whereas what I started with, it was actually super rare. So it's just a trippy thing.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:38.160]  Like a trait being dominant means that there'll be a lot of it when you breed that particular
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.400]  thing that has it, but it doesn't mean that it was originally common where you found it from. So
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:51.040]  that's the thing about going in like a land race. You might go into a land race or old seeds that
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.320]  have a big mix of stuff and you might go, Oh, this is so rare. You'll never be able to lock it down,
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.720]  but it might be rare, but it might also be dominant, which is totally counterintuitive
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.040]  because of how people think about dominance. But once you breed something dominant,
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.880]  they don't want to carry through a lot, but in the selection of seeds you've got,
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.640]  it might have that dominant thing in it, but that might not have been ever what somebody
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:20.320]  pulled seeds directly out of. So it's constantly kept in the background. So that's just a trippy,
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.760]  a trippy thing that you learn messing with, with weird things like that, you know?
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.400]  Hey, Peter, do you have the picture of that leaf that I sent you from that male plant
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:42.720]  that I used? Like the fat leaves? Yeah, that was the male that was used in the cross. It was just...
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:52.160]  Yeah, give me a second. So Jackson, as somebody who, if I were to give a music analogy,
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:59.760]  you're not top 40, you're more like a Lee Perry. Awesome, but not in the top 40.
[01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:07.590]  Less, basically like less popular. Like what do you,
[01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:16.070]  you just finished a season and what are you intrigued by in terms of what you've been
[01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:26.630]  exploring? Well, I mean, it's interesting, you know, I've said it before, but you have,
[01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:37.590]  if you want to do things like as a music analogy, you have to, if you want to please the crowd,
[01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:43.270]  you got to play the hits, you know? So like if people come to me and they go, oh, you're the
[01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:48.950]  lime guy, you know, or you're the cherry lime guy. And that's what they know from the stuff
[01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:53.270]  that I've done because it was the stuff that I entered in a contest and won an award, or
[01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:59.590]  I put that out with a collab with somebody else. Those are the things they know from me. So like,
[01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:08.070]  this year I did a lot of work with like Gelato 33 cross cherry limeade male, because that did
[01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:21.590]  um killer stuff. And I did some lime stuff and, you know, people a lot of the time are like,
[01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:26.230]  oh, I just want a good kush. Like my friends that want to grow my seeds are like, dude, just
[01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:30.150]  give me, I just want OG seeds. Do you have them? I don't want to grow the clones. I don't want to
[01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:35.590]  risk getting clones from somebody. Do you have just some gas seeds? So this year I made some
[01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:39.590]  of the stuff that I have that's like true breeding kush. Like you plant it and you're like, okay,
[01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:47.430]  it's OG. Cool. You can put it all in the bag. It's OG, you know? So like I did a lot of that kind
[01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:54.470]  of stuff, but I also did some more kind of oddball stuff. And then what I did was I took those kind
[01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:59.910]  of males and I put them with other stuff to make them go in different directions. So what's kind
[01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:06.950]  of cool is when you go to do stuff, like for me, I can go, all right, I picked these certain things.
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:11.990]  I can grow a whole bunch of things. I can only grow so many males. So a lot of people, what they
[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:16.230]  do is when they do a project or a whole, a season or whatever, they're like, and some people their
[01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:21.510]  whole career, they're like, this is this male. I take this male. This is my male. People know me
[01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:27.590]  for this male. Like, um, Subcool did some other stuff, but he was mostly known for the space dude
[01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:33.670]  male, which was a space queen boy. And they'll just put that on everything. But that's what's
[01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:38.390]  kind of cool is if you go, I kind of do the same thing except with a bunch of males. So I'll go,
[01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:44.630]  okay, I'm going to take, I'm going to take this, you know, lime and it's F5 and I'm going to make
[01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:53.350]  F6s. But while I do that, I can go ahead and put in sourdough, sour diesel, um,
[01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:58.630]  you know, whatever other things that I can get my hands on from somebody that I know is killer and
[01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:04.310]  verified. And, uh, like my buddy skunk tech gave me a whole bunch of different cuts. And then, um,
[01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:11.350]  uh, my buddy Colby and, and, uh, and, uh, who works with, uh, art from round table, like they
[01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:15.350]  always keep really nice cuts and cool stuff. And they go through a lot of cuts to see which one's
[01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:20.790]  the real deal and get them verified and take a long time. And after they've had something for
[01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:25.990]  a long time, I'm like, all right, let me get that one and that one and that one. And then you take
[01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:32.150]  those and you throw those in with the male that I already have. So like cherry limeade gelato,
[01:26:32.150 --> 01:26:36.870]  it's like, Oh, it's just, you know, whatever. It's a fresh mashup and it's just some hype
[01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:43.830]  bullshit. But the cherry limeade male that I used is already, you're using an F4 male or F5 male or
[01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:51.270]  F6 male of something that's already real, uh, um, true breeding. And then you put it with
[01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:55.910]  something and then I can take that and make a bunch of stuff out of it. And it's real predictable,
[01:26:55.910 --> 01:27:00.150]  the one side of it. And then you get these cool mixes. So like this year I did like, um,
[01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:09.190]  I did like, um, you know, I made, I took that, I did gelato 33 back cross. I did, I, I crossed
[01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:16.150]  that because it's really greasy. Um, and I crossed it like with chrome's white because chrome's white
[01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:21.190]  has a more dry resin. So I'm hoping maybe I can get like a cherry limeade profile on something
[01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:25.990]  that can hash so that the hash won't just fall apart in the water. Like I was talking about
[01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:31.030]  earlier, um, like just different goals that you see, like, okay, there's this, you want to do
[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:36.790]  that to it and that you want to do this to it. And then sometimes too, I'll just have, I'll have
[01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:41.750]  this male and I'll go, okay, this male's going, this male's going to be in the room and I'm going
[01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:47.670]  to put in its siblings with it. But then out of all this collection of plants that I have right
[01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:51.990]  now that are all flowering, what do I want to stick in there with it? And I'll just kind of
[01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:57.670]  stand there, maybe get high, listen to some tunes, kind of look at everything and be like,
[01:27:59.350 --> 01:28:03.750]  that was that, what would that be? That was that, what would that be? And I'll just like run through
[01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:09.110]  all the possibilities and go, okay, give me that, that, that, and that. So what I'll do is I'll take,
[01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:14.390]  like, I'll have like, this year I had like 80 different clone only. It's like 30 of them are
[01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:21.270]  mine. And then 50 of them are other stuff other people gave me, or maybe 90 clone onlys or whatever,
[01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:27.990]  right? So it's like Macchiato Gelato, Gelato 411, which is a 41 bag seed from Skunk Tech,
[01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:39.270]  Gelato 33, Purple Unicorn, the White, Katsubaba Fish, Purple Snowbubba from Seed,
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:46.070]  Black Dog from Bio Vortex, Purple Snowbubba was from CSI, and all these things. And I'm like,
[01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:53.510]  okay, these things kind of make sense. And this might add some added vigor, or this might add
[01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:59.430]  some added color, this might add some, this might make it more hashable. Like probably the
[01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:08.070]  Gelato 33 Cherry Limeade crossed with the Katsu, you're going to get, if you pop a few of them,
[01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.310]  you're going to get one that can hash. And the Katsu is not going to dominate the Terps, because
[01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:16.710]  it doesn't have that kind of profile. Same with the White. So those were ones where I was like,
[01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:21.110]  okay, these things should bring something to the table. So you don't just want to like,
[01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:26.230]  take everything you have and put it all with whatever male, although that can work too.
[01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:32.630]  For me, I'm like, okay, I can take this and put it with this, and I'm going to gain something here,
[01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:39.030]  that I'm going to gain something there. And so, you know, this year, I did like three OG type things,
[01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:46.950]  a couple cookie things, a more Perp Cherry Limeade thing, a lime thing.
[01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:52.470]  And then, you know, do them pure so you can keep them going further, but then
[01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:57.030]  toss in all these other things, because any of those new combinations could be something that's
[01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:00.870]  way better than what you started with. It just depends. And then you have to
[01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:07.750]  grow them out and see what they do, you know? Hey, speaking of growing things out, you know,
[01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:18.150]  I did that release for that Gorilla Glue Lime, Lime Worm VX Cross. And the whole goal was to
[01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:29.830]  just, I was trying to raise funds for a Connex box to put on the farm. And I, you know, they sold out.
[01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:35.110]  I, you know, they sold out. Actually, you guys broke all the back end of the website.
[01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:44.470]  My website, the Bokashi Earthworks one. But I'm going to be able to outfit a
[01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:51.750]  large shipping container. I'm going to do a vertical stacked LED. And it's just going to be
[01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:59.910]  a special ops division for this farm. I'm just waiting for some contract negotiation stuff.
[01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:07.430]  My current employment, and then hopefully I'll be able to move forward with this thing. But I'm
[01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:11.830]  going to get this box and it's strictly just going to be for popping seeds and phenol hunting.
[01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:14.070]  Hell yeah.
[01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:16.790]  I'm really stoked on that.
[01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:17.430]  I'm sure, man.
[01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:23.510]  Yeah. So it's like, because we're, we're gonna, they're built all the farms being built right now.
[01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:29.110]  I'm not really involved in any of it. I don't really need to be because it's just
[01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:34.870]  building infrastructure, doing electrical, that stuff that, you know, other people are doing.
[01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:40.790]  So it's going to be really interesting because we're starting off with two
[01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:48.710]  mixed light, environmentally controlled, light depth greenhouses. We're going to have that
[01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:54.790]  Connex box and I'll just be able to keep running through stuff consistently to use for any like
[01:31:54.790 --> 01:32:03.910]  future projects or like, I've been like, I've had like an overwhelmingly massive amount of people
[01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:09.110]  send me seeds and some of the stuff that I've gotten just sounds awesome. So it's like, I just
[01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:14.230]  get so excited. I want to be able to pop everything. And I was like, well, what's a good
[01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:22.150]  way to do this? And I was like, you know, I'm going to use the funds from the seeds to pop
[01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:27.030]  everybody else's seeds, probably make some more seeds and then give people more seeds.
[01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:34.310]  Do you remember the do you remember the old commercial? I think it was in the eighties
[01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:39.270]  and there's a dude walking around in the circle and he goes, I do coke.
[01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:41.990]  So I can work harder.
[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:44.230]  I was going to say, where's the beef?
[01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:52.630]  So I can buy more coke so I can make, so I can work harder. So I can make more money. So I can
[01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:57.190]  buy more coke. And he just starts running around in a circle, talking faster and faster, saying
[01:32:57.190 --> 01:33:01.750]  the same thing in a loop. That's my joke with seeds. It's like, oh, I make seeds so I can
[01:33:02.230 --> 01:33:09.990]  make money so I can make more seeds. So I can make more seeds so I can make money. So I can
[01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:14.230]  make more seeds. It's like, oh God. All right. That's all you do.
[01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:21.670]  Hey, if you love what you do though, you know, it's it's one of those things. I'm, I, you know,
[01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:27.030]  I'm really grateful to be where I'm at in all honesty. I was sitting in the cell
[01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:34.150]  a little over two years ago. So being able to, I've been doing this for a long time and, you know,
[01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:38.870]  I just keep doing it and it's nothing was going to stop me. Nobody's going to tell me not to,
[01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:44.470]  but not having to like constantly look over my back, being in a state like Oklahoma, which has
[01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:51.830]  been an absolute blessing. The people out here are really amazing. Everybody's really friendly.
[01:33:52.790 --> 01:34:00.070]  The laws are the laws are friendly for the people for like, you know, they can't, you can,
[01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:04.630]  you come out here and you can start a business. Well, you have to have residency if you want to
[01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:11.910]  hold a license. So that's not true, but it's, they've made it so that it's inclusive so that
[01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:19.670]  everybody can participate. And it's created a huge economic impact here in Oklahoma, as far as
[01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:26.710]  development, property, everybody's businesses, as far as like HVAC, electrical, all that,
[01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:34.870]  all that stuff comes with it. So the economic impact from cannabis is in Oklahoma is huge
[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:41.590]  because they've allowed it to be inclusive. And I really hope that, you know, this can be a really
[01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:49.590]  good example for how things can be done well, when things are not over-regulated by politicians who
[01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:55.830]  want a piece of something that they, you know, condemned for years. And a lot of times played a
[01:34:55.830 --> 01:35:03.430]  part in, you know, locking people like myself up. So it really makes me mad to see people try to
[01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:11.110]  take things from, you know, the people, you know, that work really hard and risk a lot to do this.
[01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:17.830]  So Oklahoma is a really good example of a place that that's inclusive and isn't going to tax the
[01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:25.190]  shit out of licensing and over-regulation. And Jackson, how's the California experience working out?
[01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:33.430]  I mean, everybody knows California is totally fucked on the way they like to over-regulate,
[01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:43.030]  over-tax, do all that kind of stuff. It's a really nice place. And, you know, the
[01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:50.310]  government is definitely always leave something to be desired, right? But, yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:55.350]  It's cool that some places are doing stuff more loose like that. It's trippy to me,
[01:35:55.350 --> 01:36:00.150]  like, because I can understand regulations, like if you're going to make a car, like, you know,
[01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:06.150]  your shit needs to not blow up and catch on fire or like there needs to be, like, you know,
[01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:11.510]  controls like that. But those things are really easy to see the dangers and the risks and all
[01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:17.830]  that. Whereas weed, it's like weed's already been around just everywhere for thousands of years and
[01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:25.670]  it never really fucked up anything. And then you can tell that the regulation of it is basically
[01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:31.750]  just based, like you said, on the greed of people who want a piece of it because it's going on. And
[01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:38.630]  to me, it's weird because it would have seemed like all they really had to do was basically,
[01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:42.870]  if you want to sell it in stores, it's got to be tested and there's going to be a sales tax,
[01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:49.750]  just like anything else. And if you have a big, huge, booming product like that, then just taxing
[01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:55.510]  it seven or 10 percent or whatever as a sales tax would bring in a huge amount of money. But instead,
[01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:59.830]  they're missing out on all the money because people don't want to deal with that whole system
[01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:06.230]  of how everything works anyway at the stores and shit. So they're just this huge, huge piece of
[01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:11.750]  everything that I feel like they're missing. And then the other big thing to look at with things
[01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:18.470]  that are regulated to me is like, and this is drugs in general, people go, oh, well, if you have
[01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:27.190]  legal drugs, like something like mushrooms, you go, well, what if somebody eats mushrooms and
[01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:32.630]  then they become psychotic and they assault somebody? It's like, well, assault's already a
[01:37:32.630 --> 01:37:39.190]  crime. Yeah. But what if they're driving impaired and they do that? Well, driving impaired is already
[01:37:39.190 --> 01:37:46.310]  a crime. Like the actual drug doesn't need to be there doesn't need to be a crime for the drug,
[01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:51.510]  for the weed, for the shrooms, for whatever. Like as crazy as people think Oregon is right now for
[01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:59.190]  legalizing hard drugs. I'm like, well, if you're really that worried about, OK, people do meth,
[01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:04.950]  they get violent. A lot of people, I mean, where I live, there's always been a lot of people doing
[01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:11.110]  that. And a lot of them do it just for the sake of their life. I'm a rebel and I do. I like to do
[01:38:11.110 --> 01:38:15.670]  shit that's illegal and we like to creep around. We do like you legalize it. A lot of people be
[01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:20.870]  all man, that's some boring shit. Now it's like some fucking whatever. Like, I don't think we're
[01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:25.110]  going to want to fucking do it anymore because they're not fucking Rambo for doing some meth
[01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:32.550]  anymore. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's like. But I was just going to say, like with any
[01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:38.870]  state, I mean, their number one priority is revenue. And I've always just thought like it's
[01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:47.430]  stupid if, you know, an industry is booming, tax it lightly and you'll generate more revenue than
[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:55.590]  if you tax it heavily. Like if you have more players and employees and revenue up and down
[01:38:55.590 --> 01:39:05.510]  the sheet, right, like personal employment income, corporate income, like low taxes and lots of
[01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:14.470]  players leads to like California's number one priority is tax revenue. And to overtax everyone
[01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:20.710]  is worse for the state than if they had like what Oklahoma had. Like if California had
[01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:27.510]  Oklahoma's model, they'd just be rolling in tax revenue. Tons of employees, tons of employers.
[01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:36.390]  Oh yeah. And here's the thing, right? So when multiple people are able to operate,
[01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:41.190]  the thing is there's lots of different industries out here. It's not just cultivation. There's
[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:45.990]  cultivation, there's processing, there's waste disposal, there's transportation.
[01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:54.390]  And then again, it's like with like logging and like restaurants popping up and barber shops and
[01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:58.870]  or like fracking with all those ancillary industries.
[01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:04.310]  It's all it's mainly all about control. They want to control markets so they can,
[01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:08.870]  you know, you have to remember California, I think, has like one of the world's largest
[01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:15.430]  economies, the state itself, probably like the sixth or seventh largest world economy.
[01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:21.910]  And when you're talking about the type of revenue that the state of California generates, you have
[01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:28.390]  to be aware that we're talking about cannabis. Cannabis has been around and hugely prevalent.
[01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:35.270]  The black market has supplied the entire United States with cannabis for the last 40, 50 years,
[01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:44.950]  on a regular basis. So we're talking about a multi-billion, billions, billions, probably 20,
[01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:51.510]  30, 40, maybe a hundred billion dollars, even more than that. It's probably in the trillions of
[01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:59.990]  dollars. And the thing is, there's a lot of political people that would like to just be
[01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:05.990]  able to control the income. That's why it's so, and the price fluctuation, right? When we're
[01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:13.750]  talking about California's markets, when things go federally legal also, and we can export
[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:20.070]  different cannabis and there's like the terroirs in place, it's going to be a game changer for
[01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:28.710]  California, a huge, huge impact. And it's going to affect probably global markets at some point.
[01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:37.190]  It's going to affect national markets extremely. And we're talking about the price of cannabis
[01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:47.350]  across the board. So I think that that's probably one of the reasons why it's so highly taxed and
[01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:56.390]  regulated, just because the math adds up, the income adds up for the people who are able to
[01:41:56.390 --> 01:42:05.260]  regulate these things. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's weird to me because I look at it as like,
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:09.100]  okay, I noticed the thing that happens, like what's happening right now in my county
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.260]  is they're going, okay, we're going to make it so that you can grow.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:20.300]  I think they're saying you can grow 10% of your property. So they're saying, okay, if you have
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.860]  a hundred acres now, you can grow 10 acres. And it was capped where, okay, you can only grow a half
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:31.900]  acre. So the play really for them is to go, okay, well, if we're going to regulate it so heavy,
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:37.980]  it's impossible for us to do if there's lots of small people. So what we want to do is regulate
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:43.340]  the hell out of it, but we'll make it so that we only have a few. We don't have that many.
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:48.780]  Because if there's lots of big farms, then they'll be the only ones. And we'll only have to deal with
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:53.580]  this little stack of paperwork instead of this big stack of paperwork. But what they're not seeing is
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:43:00.460]  what you're talking about with the real future of the economy. And someone like me can look and see
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:11.980]  and go, like the stuff you were saying, like if it comes down to quality and all these little areas
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:18.060]  and all this special different things and specialty stuff, the way, like what California
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:28.060]  and other places are like, then it's going to be a lot of potential like that. But if you only have
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:35.500]  these few big players, that doesn't really translate to being something super valuable
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:43.740]  on the big scale across the board. Because their product is going to be similar to product that you
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:49.420]  could produce anywhere. Like what's special about being able to get something from these certain
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:59.260]  places, whether it's southern Oregon or Washington or Santa Cruz, or if you establish something,
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:04.700]  a name in Oklahoma, you establish a name in Maine, these different places, there's going to be these
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:13.020]  certain places. And what will make them noteworthy will be the fact that the quality is really
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:20.780]  standing out. But if everything is leaned towards this kind of a commodity market, then there'll be
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:28.940]  no reason for anybody to want to buy something from Oklahoma or Maine or Virginia or Montana
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:34.780]  specifically. It'll just be like, oh, well, wherever you can produce that. And then it'll turn out that,
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:40.460]  oh, well, they found, okay, somebody just took their money to Morocco and invested in some super deep
[01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:46.140]  wells or some shit and grew all this tonnage and they might as well just buy it from these guys for
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:52.860]  nothing. And then there's really no edge to the economy where if everything is specialized and
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:45:00.540]  kept small, then there's actually a reason for everywhere to have this edge. So to me, it seems
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:08.780]  like they're undermining the potential and just going for what's easy and it's short-sighted.
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:13.980]  And then they want the money. It's funny because for regulation, it's like, okay, they want the
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:18.140]  permit money, they want this, they want that. Me, I'm like, if they just let it be a free-for-all,
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:25.420]  the economy would naturally grow. The thing is, like you were saying, control. If they can control
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:31.420]  it, they can count their money and it goes to the government and people in the government can
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:37.660]  figure out ways to run these scams and to get these salaries and these positions and have this
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:43.500]  different stuff. But the reality is that I've already seen is that when you let communities
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:52.540]  have this big boom of money, then all of a sudden you're like, whoa, hey, look, the schools are just
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:57.980]  nice regardless of the government. The towns are nice regardless of the government. It doesn't even
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:03.500]  matter because everybody's like, we have money and we live here. So people all of a sudden start just
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:07.820]  making the schools be nice. They start making the towns be nice. Everyone all of a sudden,
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:12.700]  it's like stimulus package for everybody. Like, hey, look, everybody just got this massive
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:21.340]  injection of money into the system. And then the government on every transaction,
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:27.100]  when people have money is already getting their sales tax. So they're like, oh, we want your money
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.940]  for growing weed. It's like, you're already getting everybody's money from growing weed.
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.500]  They don't understand what the economy really is. The money they're actually already seeing
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.340]  for all this shit was already coming from all these people growing weed anyway,
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:46.620]  because that's what they're getting the money when the guy at the restaurant or the shoe store or
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:53.580]  whatever, even Walmart, when these guys are actually paying whatever tax they pay or sales
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:58.460]  tax comes in off all these items, that was weed money. They were already getting their seven or
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:04.780]  8% off of this billion dollar, multi, multi billion dollar industry. It was already going
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:09.820]  there, but they can't get it right in their pocket and they can't skim it and they can't
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:14.460]  give it. They can't get it. They can't get a salary to be the commissioner of this or
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:20.220]  whatever the fuck it is. So they think that they're not getting the money. But the reality
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:26.300]  of an economy is any time money is in circulation, the government is already getting a shit load of
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:31.420]  money from that anyway. And what they've actually done by doing this whole process is taken money
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:37.260]  back out of the system, but they don't understand mechanics of everything well enough for that
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:41.180]  because they have this tunnel vision and they're fucking bureaucrats and they only understand what's
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:50.380]  on their desk. They can't see the world for shit. So it's fucking nuts. Yeah, I agree, man. I mean,
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:48:00.140]  like again, I think that out here in Oklahoma, I think we're safe for another year of medical,
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:10.620]  which is good. I don't think anything's changing, which I, you know, we have regulations in place
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:16.460]  now, like they're doing, you know, tagging all the plants now because they weren't, we didn't
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:24.860]  have to do that before. But I mean, tagging plants isn't a big deal. I said before, you know, I have
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:30.700]  obsessive compulsive cannabis disorder and the only cure is unlimited plant counts.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:39.340]  And we still have that. So I think that's a beautiful thing because that gives you a lot
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:45.820]  of freedom to do a lot of things that you might not necessarily be able to do in a lot of places.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.620]  Yeah, I mean, for me, I'm not really that intimidated by that process. I already have to,
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:49:00.220]  I already have to tag everything anyway, because I need to know what male I seeded it with.
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:05.020]  Like, I know the difference between weed when I see it. I'm like, oh, this is that or that's this.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:12.940]  But I need to know, okay, this was seeded with this and it came from this run or whatever and
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:16.860]  all that. And so it's like, all right, I'm already keeping track of that. You're already taking notes,
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:22.140]  you know what you're doing. So it's not, that part of it's not super intimidating. It was
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:26.380]  intimidating when it was a vague thing. But now that I actually have to do it, I'm like, all right,
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:37.180]  well, I can do that. And for me, it's not a thing that, you know, like none of it gets in my way
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:46.300]  because of my specific situation. But it's still, you know, I just look at the big picture of it,
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:53.180]  and I'm like, it just doesn't, it doesn't all add up, you know. But yeah, I mean, you want to have,
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:59.100]  ideally, you want to already be logging all that stuff anyway. And then, you know, the system of
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:04.700]  it is like, okay, well, now we know what this is, everything's doing per square foot in this run.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:11.340]  You know, in every different house or whatever. So it can be cool too, but it's definitely,
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:16.140]  you know, it's nice to just do it however the hell you want, you know.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:26.140]  Let me ask you a question because I always, you know, for me, I've grown a shitload of
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:32.860]  different varieties. I've grown a ton of weed. And there's been like a couple of plants that I,
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:40.940]  or a couple of varieties that I distinctly remember that were just like insane as far as
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:48.060]  just marking all the boxes, production, just those. You know, some people are like, oh, this is my one.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:54.620]  You know, this is my one. What is that or what has that been for you? Do you still have it?
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.660]  Or is it something that you lost? You know, what's... I'm sure a lot of people want to hear
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:06.700]  that because I'm a little curious if you've got one. Just like my very favorite. Yeah.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:17.660]  I mean, you know, it's for me, it's interesting because I don't, you know, I...
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:25.420]  It's a funny thing how personal preferences. For me, I like lime and different things that
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:31.100]  come from the lime and things that are related to the root beer, the different jarrow stuff.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:40.060]  That's my favorite. And I've had OG cuts, like the fire cut that I had, the pure PK if you grow it
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:49.100]  right. They're more choky and more like I could say, if you only could have a gram of weed and
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:55.980]  that's all the weed you're going to have ever, you might want those more if you're just trying to
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:03.340]  have a really gnarly hit of weed. But like there's like certain things that I really like
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:10.700]  that just really do it for me. Like I light it up and that's what I want to smoke. And if I
[01:52:10.700 --> 01:52:18.300]  light something up, I might want to put it down, even if I think it might be more likely to be
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:26.300]  successful as like a hit amongst a crowd. So for me, like Cherry Limeade was like the
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:34.620]  one of those ones where I was like, oh, this is a showstopper. But after I smoke it for a little
[01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:39.420]  bit, I'm like, it's really good. I'm not saying there's anything that you can say against it.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:45.660]  It's just that for me, I go back to smoking like some jarrow and the jarrow is so plain
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:51.580]  compared to Cherry Limeade. It's crazy, but it has this thing that I like that's like
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:56.540]  makes it not plain, which is like that kind of thing. Like I was talking about with the old
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:53:05.260]  Hindus and Ghanis and like glue stuff like that. I mean, not that those even I like as much as
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:11.900]  jarrow, like the jarrow, I just love it. It has OG in it, it has Dussel in it, it has Hindu in it,
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:19.340]  has Black Afi in it. And that to me is just incredibly like satisfying for some reason,
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:27.420]  you know? You said that's the Sky Jarrow? Just the jarrow. So the Sky Jarrow is Skywalker
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:37.740]  cross with jarrow. The jarrow was Black Afi on Hindu on PK on Sour Dsoul. And the root here
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:44.300]  was the same male, but instead of being on the Sour Dsoul, it was on the headband.
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:50.460]  And so the same flavor the root beer has, it comes out in the jarrow.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:57.180]  That's weird that you said, because I saw a picture, I think you posted it on your feed
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:54:02.140]  of the root beer. And I was like, that kind of looks a little bit like Sour Dsoul a little bit.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:08.060]  Yeah, I mean, it has the headband that I had is really closely related to Sour.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:19.740]  Nobody knows exactly how Not So Dog thinks that it could be from the same batch of seeds or
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:25.980]  a predecessor of it or something like that, just because it's a headband.
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:33.100]  Yeah, the headband that we had, which is different than all, it's not Lumpa's, it's not
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:40.700]  what they have in Oregon. It's a different one. It's like a sour. It's got that, it's like the
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:46.940]  old best sour ever, but a little better than that. And it's a little bit more chunkier,
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:55.260]  a little bit more chunky. It's a little more desirable to me than a sour. But it's still like,
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:58.940]  if you grow it outside in the full sun, it still has some of that undesirable
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:05.500]  structure a little bit, like the little stretchy, as to me, a little bit too much stretch. The
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:09.340]  stems want to grow fast when it's in the full sun, but indoor, it just gets like the big
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:17.660]  flat top with little nipples on the top. And it's just, it's really, really, really dank.
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:25.660]  It was really killer. But what was cool about it was that the weed that I really liked was the
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:30.940]  athi with the hindu, but the plants were too small. So I crossed them with the PK. And the PK
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:38.460]  didn't do much, but it made it have a little bit more of a better structure. Yeah, well,
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:45.340]  it made it, the PK made it get to be a much bigger, faster growing plant. And it made the
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:52.620]  resin a little bit more gloppy. And then when it got crossed with the headband or with the sour,
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:58.700]  it went from being like, okay, this is a nice big bush to being like, oh, shit, these are these now,
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:04.940]  these are legitimate trees, these are big, big plants. And all the way through the whole process,
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:11.420]  it still hung on to being kind of the same profile that I liked from the initial stuff.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:18.300]  It just got a little different, but I never got anything to be sour or anything to be headband.
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:23.420]  Like in seed form, it would be like the things that lean that way will still pop out a little bit.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:31.180]  But mostly it's like athi hindu on a really big frame with bigger, longer buds and way better
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:37.260]  mold resistance. And that's like how, you know, that's why it's so good to me because it's,
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:43.420]  because I, you know, I could get sour or things that are closer to that, but those weren't the
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:49.260]  things that really, really hit for me. But I do like that kind of weed. It's killer too.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:54.780]  It's just like there's this extra little thing. And I don't even know, like usually I'm surprised
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:59.900]  if people like it. Like when people like root beer so much, I'm like, okay, I would think maybe people
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:08.140]  might think it's a little bit plain because it's not like, to me, it's not the loudest,
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:12.060]  but then I show it to somebody and they're like, oh man, that's so stinky. And I'm like, okay, well,
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:17.100]  you know, you kind of get desensitized to maybe what things are like, like, oh,
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:22.300]  gee, to me doesn't smell like that stinky weed anymore. Like when I first smelled Urkel,
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:28.780]  it was this crazy fruit loops, Flintstone vitamin, artificial flavor, crazy gnarly shit.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:35.740]  Now I smell it and I'm like, it's fruity, it's sweet, it's good, but it doesn't have the impact.
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:41.100]  I think that things just wear out on you. Like when you listen to a song and you listen to that
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.660]  song and it's just amazing. And then you hear it a hundred times and you're like, man, I wish I
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:49.260]  could hear that for the first time again. Cause it's just now it's just the song I've heard.
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:58.540]  Yeah. My, one of my all-time favorites is the train wreck blueberry. That was my friend put
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:05.100]  together. It's one of the lines that I'm working. He had crossed that with a MK Ultra male when that
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:15.820]  was released, I think in, I don't know, it was either 2001 or 2003. And he did, he had a,
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:22.780]  he had a super silver haze and then a MK Ultra male that he used in a bunch of crosses. And
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:33.420]  one of those was the trainer at blueberry MK Ultra. I'm trying to replicate the terpene profile for
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:42.860]  the trainer at blueberry, but without the out of control stretch because the blueberry trainer
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:50.540]  It grew just like train wreck it, but it had a different, a different terpene profile. It had
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:59.020]  kind of more of a, a full front, like the full, the full, the, the front end of the, the profile was,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:10.220]  was like this very, very, really extremely sweet blueberry smell. And then the,
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.580]  then the cut was really, really sweet blueberry smell
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:23.660]  with with like a pine lemon, that kind of cut through the back end. And it's, it's a
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:32.620]  really, it was, it's really, really, really pungent. And I, you know, that cut was lost in
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:35.040]  But some of the
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:42.640]  Some of the beans that he had sent me I tested out and I ran through a bunch of them and they had
[01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:46.540]  Quite a few of them. They had the profile I was looking for
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:51.340]  One of those actually I I hit with that the lime one BX
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.640]  Mail, I think I sent you some of those seeds, too
[01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:00.160]  I'm working on that right now. Just the the MK ultra
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:02.160]  Trainer a blueberry
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:08.280]  It should be pretty nice when it's done, but you know, I had this mail that I thought was gonna
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:13.360]  Be the one but it looks like it has less of intersex characteristics
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:18.080]  associated with it and I think I'm gonna just have to cut it out and
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.840]  You know, I'll have to just try again next time
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:26.760]  I'll just run through some more of the seeds try to find something that didn't have those characters
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.800]  And it and it sucks because it's got that right
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.640]  You know right stature. It's really woody the stems
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:38.840]  It grew really nice. It didn't have any issues
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.400]  except for that, you know, it's showing all those those
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  stigmas stamen
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  stigmas one of the two
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.800]  So I'll probably just end up cutting it down
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.800]  So I'll probably just end up cutting it down
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:59.280]  I don't know. I might do a test on it collect some of the pollen maybe do a test
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:04.880]  Like a single branch pollination then test out some of those seeds to see if they're stable or not
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.560]  Or if it's even what I'm looking for
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.720]  Just quickly Brandon with lime or illa, what's the flowering time?
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:17.640]  Flowering time on the lime or was nine to ten weeks
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:25.380]  All right, well
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.860]  Should we wrap it on that two hours in
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:35.020]  Yeah, I'm about ready. I go to work in the morning. Yeah, I got uh
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:40.780]  Yeah, I'm trying to so tomorrow wait hold on one second
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:45.180]  So tomorrow at 9 a.m
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:49.220]  So, let me just quickly run through
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:54.460]  Here Brandon you can narrate as we go through this but
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:00.340]  Oh, yeah, so this is the lime 1b X
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:03.340]  These were some of the first
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.940]  shots of
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:08.420]  The plants when I first popped them
[02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:14.070]  There were all really nice
[02:02:14.590 --> 02:02:19.430]  Vibrant healthy this was I think I think I don't know if this one was male
[02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:22.510]  Um, I think there's a picture of him in there though
[02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:29.270]  It's not that one I think it's the next one
[02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:32.390]  It's that one
[02:02:33.150 --> 02:02:40.430]  That was the male that I use it was very very short and squat it was that had incredibly
[02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:49.630]  Close internodal spacing and it had it it grew out. I think there might be some pictures
[02:02:49.630 --> 02:02:53.270]  I don't know if I sent them to you of it. Well, voila. It was bigger
[02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:57.230]  But the leaf
[02:02:57.270 --> 02:03:00.510]  The leaves got just huge on on them
[02:03:02.110 --> 02:03:05.510]  And they're super super wide I just like the structure
[02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:12.430]  I think he could it was gonna balance out that 31 because the 31 the lemon roll of 31 cut was pretty stretchy
[02:03:13.110 --> 02:03:17.910]  And it you know, it got really heavy and it didn't have
[02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:19.950]  the a
[02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:23.070]  Lot of support, you know couldn't support itself very well
[02:03:23.670 --> 02:03:27.350]  Yeah, so that that came off of the mail right there that was a
[02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:33.950]  Fan there's some line of really right there. That was the lemon DX mail
[02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:38.390]  These are early on I think maybe like four weeks in the flowering
[02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:46.270]  A little further on in
[02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:53.090]  They have yeah, they have really nice resin production
[02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:57.490]  Um, but the thing that's most you most unique about these
[02:03:57.490 --> 02:04:01.090]  Is the the terpene levels I haven't tested anything
[02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:06.570]  I think under like three and a half on this variety and it usually tests between five and eight
[02:04:07.410 --> 02:04:09.410]  so I mean they get
[02:04:09.970 --> 02:04:11.970]  they get
[02:04:12.490 --> 02:04:14.490]  They get really high in terpene
[02:04:15.690 --> 02:04:26.060]  That looks nice
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:33.540]  Yeah, those are caked like good glue. So what's cool about it is it's got the resin like the glue but the smell it's just so stinky
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.860]  Yeah, I'm really happy with that I have some
[02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:41.850]  I have a couple of I
[02:04:42.610 --> 02:04:44.610]  have a couple of Fino's
[02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:46.370]  that I
[02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:50.890]  That I've been holding on to I let that 30 I gave the 31 cut
[02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:52.970]  to
[02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:58.210]  Caleb to all that that Emerald Cup, but I'm not sure if he even kept it
[02:04:58.210 --> 02:05:02.050]  I think I just left it on his his table that he was sitting at
[02:05:02.170 --> 02:05:04.490]  And then a couple other people have it too, oh
[02:05:05.170 --> 02:05:07.170]  And yeah, I got a shout out the artist
[02:05:08.610 --> 02:05:10.050]  J
[02:05:10.050 --> 02:05:12.050]  JB King s choir
[02:05:13.130 --> 02:05:14.810]  ESQ on
[02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:16.810]  IG he's
[02:05:17.210 --> 02:05:20.370]  Super cool, dude. He's a legit underground
[02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:26.010]  Tag artist who does like train murals and stuff and he reached out to me
[02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:28.010]  I think he does a lot of like like
[02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:34.170]  Train murals and stuff and he reached out to me. I think he does a lot of the stuff from a sonic as well
[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:37.290]  the artwork that
[02:05:37.570 --> 02:05:39.570]  Masonic releases he
[02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:44.330]  Does a lot of his stuff too. He's a really cool cool guy and he comes up with some
[02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:49.250]  Really neat creations. I and then there was another artist to the one that
[02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:53.770]  The one that
[02:05:54.810 --> 02:05:57.730]  Jackson shared on his feed that was for the
[02:05:58.170 --> 02:06:00.170]  Gorilla Glue for
[02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:06.890]  Limeland DX and that was a mit congen on IG's another really good graphic artist
[02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:12.250]  All right, so
[02:06:13.610 --> 02:06:16.650]  Tomorrow morning we have
[02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:22.930]  Mandalorian genetics at 9 a.m. And
[02:06:24.970 --> 02:06:26.970]  Then we have
[02:06:27.970 --> 02:06:29.970]  The James Ladd show
[02:06:33.010 --> 02:06:35.650]  Then we got these guys at 11
[02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:41.250]  Yeah, Mandalorian genetics is a full duplex
[02:06:42.570 --> 02:06:45.810]  AP and I on AG he's actually another one of the
[02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:52.970]  panel members on the cheap home grow podcast that we do live every Sunday and we just kind of chop it up for two hours
[02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:54.970]  about you know
[02:06:55.170 --> 02:06:57.170]  Girl weed
[02:06:58.290 --> 02:07:00.290]  He's a good
[02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:05.330]  good stuff and then Tuesday night, we're finally getting to the
[02:07:06.210 --> 02:07:10.210]  fire relief stuff, so I wanted to see if
[02:07:12.490 --> 02:07:18.130]  Between the two of you either one of you would be down for like 15 30 minutes to come on and
[02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:24.490]  Talk shop for a little bit as we get this started and I think
[02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:27.970]  Food not bombs is
[02:07:29.530 --> 02:07:32.890]  Possibly gonna be the first risk, you know
[02:07:32.890 --> 02:07:37.810]  It's kind of like you got to aim the fire hose at someone and it's like is there a good?
[02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:44.370]  Nonprofit is there someone whose house burnt down or farm burnt down and I?
[02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:48.810]  Think food not bombs is doing a lot of good. So we're probably gonna
[02:07:49.650 --> 02:07:52.770]  As far as I know start with them and we need
[02:07:53.730 --> 02:07:55.450]  We
[02:07:55.450 --> 02:07:59.570]  Santa Cruz cannabis company got a lot of seeds from a lot of breeders and
[02:08:01.170 --> 02:08:08.450]  Alright, so check this out. I actually sent some of those original crosses those f1
[02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:10.530]  hybrids from
[02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:12.210]  2001
[02:08:12.210 --> 02:08:14.210]  2002 2003
[02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:16.610]  So there's some really rare stuff in there
[02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:22.450]  I briefly spoke to Adam and I wouldn't mind I'll hop on hop on
[02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:26.810]  You just got to give me heads up when it's when it is and I can tell you a little bit about the history
[02:08:26.810 --> 02:08:28.810]  of those things well, yes
[02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:35.610]  So I think you know ideally we go weekly and Tuesday is gonna be the first one
[02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:40.250]  So, but yeah we need
[02:08:41.250 --> 02:08:48.610]  Someone who wants to be like an MC for each one people want to help out on the keeping track of what's going on
[02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:57.370]  Yeah, so we got I think there's some momentum and now it's kind of
[02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:06.650]  Wrangling cats and making shit happen starting to Tuesday night, so
[02:09:06.690 --> 02:09:11.010]  But for the 400 and something people still tuned in at
[02:09:11.690 --> 02:09:15.050]  1015 on a Saturday night Pacific Time when
[02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:18.850]  East Coast should all be in bed by now. We appreciate it
[02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:23.290]  Yes, Brandon is on

[02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:31.930]  Yeah, I'm shadow ban, so you're gonna have to type it all out
[02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:38.250]  The shadow may ban may be up because I typed in like the first four letters and it popped up
[02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:44.010]  Really? Oh, but I but but I know in the past like I've had to type in the whole thing
[02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:46.810]  Okay
[02:09:46.810 --> 02:09:48.610]  Awesome. So
[02:09:48.610 --> 02:09:50.610]  Well, I knew I'd sign off it

[02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:40.250]  And I stand correct. Wait, sorry that was that wasn't the one
[02:10:41.490 --> 02:10:44.090]  You're still a shadow ban. So don't get your hopes up
[02:10:47.210 --> 02:10:49.210]  Sorry about that
[02:10:49.330 --> 02:10:52.610]  But uh, all right, well, thank you everyone have a good night
