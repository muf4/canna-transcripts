[00:11.450 --> 00:16.010]  The bottom line is you must create markets in order for you to be in the market.
[00:16.010 --> 00:19.790]  If you have something that's so specific that only three people want to buy it, when those
[00:19.790 --> 00:22.930]  three people don't want to buy it, you're sitting on that shit.
[00:22.930 --> 00:23.930]  And you can't.
[00:23.930 --> 00:26.270]  You don't have an ability to sit on flour.
[00:26.270 --> 00:27.750]  You can't offload it.
[00:27.750 --> 00:31.410]  You can't take it and say, well, now we're going to blow it because you've already processed
[00:31.410 --> 00:33.170]  it, so you've wasted money.
[00:33.170 --> 00:34.890]  You've spent time.
[00:34.890 --> 00:36.890]  You have to be very clear.
[00:36.890 --> 00:42.410]  And the way this works is that you start to create these sun-grown models that allow the
[00:42.410 --> 00:44.850]  customer to say, wow, that was really good.
[00:44.850 --> 00:46.810]  I would like to buy more sun-grown.
[00:46.810 --> 00:51.110]  Instead of trying to fight for your brand value, what you fight for is a bigger picture
[00:51.110 --> 00:54.370]  of brand value that you can then get under.
[00:54.370 --> 00:56.750]  And then you start to be able to get differentiation.
[00:56.750 --> 00:58.770]  You start to get noticed.
[00:58.770 --> 01:04.010]  Once you're noticed, you can now introduce the customer to what you do.
[01:04.050 --> 01:08.090]  And then you can start to be able to release the information of when your product's going
[01:08.090 --> 01:09.530]  to come out.
[01:09.530 --> 01:13.610]  If you follow the way people buy things, they don't like variety.
[01:13.610 --> 01:14.610]  Everyone's like, I love variety.
[01:14.610 --> 01:15.610]  And I'm like, really?
[01:15.610 --> 01:16.610]  How many different kind of shoes you got?
[01:16.610 --> 01:18.170]  Not that many.
[01:18.170 --> 01:19.170]  Women.
[01:19.170 --> 01:21.210]  Women like variety and shoes.
[01:21.210 --> 01:25.790]  But really, they don't buy, how many different foods do you buy?
[01:25.790 --> 01:28.390]  How many different things do you really buy when you go?
[01:28.390 --> 01:31.050]  You go to the supermarket, do you leave with a different item every time?
[01:31.050 --> 01:32.050]  No.
[01:32.090 --> 01:34.850]  You have a range of things that you use.
[01:34.850 --> 01:39.930]  And that's basically how people function, is they work off a repetition and pattern.
[01:39.930 --> 01:46.030]  And so what you have to do is realize that when you go into a store and there's 400 varieties,
[01:46.030 --> 01:47.930]  the customer goes, too many.
[01:47.930 --> 01:52.010]  And they ask the person who's selling it, what's selling?
[01:52.010 --> 01:53.010]  What's hot?
[01:53.010 --> 01:54.010]  What do you like?
[01:54.010 --> 01:58.930]  And in a simple sentence, you've destroyed the business for almost every one of those
[01:58.930 --> 02:03.650]  farms because the relationship has to be built with the people who are interfacing
[02:03.650 --> 02:05.330]  with the public.
[02:05.330 --> 02:08.710]  You have to be able to let them understand why your product is better.
[02:08.710 --> 02:10.130]  You don't need to give them a t-shirt.
[02:10.130 --> 02:11.130]  You don't need to give them a hat.
[02:11.130 --> 02:12.130]  They don't give a shit.
[02:12.130 --> 02:13.130]  They're going to give it away.
[02:13.130 --> 02:15.530]  What you need to give them is product.
[02:15.530 --> 02:16.770]  Aloha.
[02:16.770 --> 02:23.810]  I commend you because every time I see you, you give the same thing, a pack of matches,
[02:23.810 --> 02:26.690]  have some pre-roll and two business cards.
[02:26.690 --> 02:28.530]  So you don't lose the damn thing.
[02:29.130 --> 02:34.130]  And what that does, it develops a relationship so that people start to see you as an individual,
[02:34.130 --> 02:38.250]  not just a company, and they get to experience your product and they say, hey, the last couple
[02:38.250 --> 02:40.210]  times I smoked it, that shit was pretty good.
[02:40.210 --> 02:44.810]  When I go to the store and I need a pre-roll, I'll look for that blue and white box.
[02:44.810 --> 02:46.790]  And they start to pattern.
[02:46.790 --> 02:52.210]  And I think that these are the things that we really need to discuss and talk about in
[02:52.210 --> 02:56.810]  an honest sense because what happens is people become very, very protective of their genetics
[02:57.130 --> 03:00.890]  because it's your material that represents you.
[03:00.890 --> 03:05.370]  And so you're emotionally connected to it and you're like, I am my genes, but you're
[03:05.370 --> 03:06.370]  not.
[03:06.370 --> 03:07.370]  You're not your genes.
[03:07.370 --> 03:11.570]  There's something that you work with and over the course of your career, you have definitely
[03:11.570 --> 03:14.090]  grown more than one line.
[03:14.090 --> 03:19.010]  And so because of that, what you've done is you've always moved into things that are marketable.
[03:19.010 --> 03:25.210]  And to me, the destruction of our culture in terms of diversity of genetics was really
[03:25.250 --> 03:27.570]  around 2002.
[03:27.570 --> 03:29.330]  And that was when the perp came out.
[03:29.330 --> 03:35.770]  And so when the perp came out, the perp comes into this perfect storm of internet and it
[03:35.770 --> 03:40.290]  comes into Oaksterdam where you start, and I don't mean the university, I'm talking about
[03:40.290 --> 03:46.690]  when Oakland became Oaksterdam and the blunt and how people bought pot.
[03:46.690 --> 03:50.170]  And so I'm watching this, I had the perp a couple of years before it got hot.
[03:50.170 --> 03:53.190]  And all of a sudden it blew up and I couldn't understand why it blew up.
[03:53.190 --> 03:55.150]  So I said, I'm going down the bay to check this out.
[03:56.090 --> 03:58.290]  I was always tied into the hood and the bay.
[03:58.290 --> 04:02.790]  So I said, let's go into the hood and let's figure out why people are buying the perp.
[04:02.790 --> 04:07.230]  And when they ran up to my car and threw that bag in the window, I realized that under street
[04:07.230 --> 04:12.150]  lights that purple color with those orange hairs was instantly recognizable in a way
[04:12.150 --> 04:14.230]  that nothing else resonated.
[04:14.230 --> 04:19.110]  And what it did is it let people get ahold of a variety that was high in sesquiterpenes
[04:19.110 --> 04:21.310]  that didn't taste like shit in the blunt.
[04:21.310 --> 04:28.430]  So the blunt and street lights and instant recognizability created this desire.
[04:28.430 --> 04:33.270]  And in a brief second, if you weren't in purple business, you weren't in business.
[04:33.270 --> 04:37.750]  And at that moment, every single person I knew who had collections of genetics, they
[04:37.750 --> 04:43.150]  had incredible lines from the past, couldn't sell any pot.
[04:43.150 --> 04:47.630]  And so they started throwing away all this material and going into the perp because you
[04:47.630 --> 04:50.430]  can't hold libraries if you're poor.
[04:50.430 --> 04:52.790]  You can't hold collections if you're poor.
[04:52.790 --> 04:56.230]  It's kind of hard to light up a mom room if you're not selling the clones.
[04:56.230 --> 05:00.150]  It's kind of hard to hold a huge collection if it's a risk and it's a felony if you're
[05:00.150 --> 05:01.450]  not getting paid.
[05:01.450 --> 05:04.230]  Because if you're not getting paid, you can't afford a lawyer.
[05:04.230 --> 05:07.410]  And so if you're really in business, you kind of understand, I need to make enough money
[05:07.410 --> 05:11.630]  to afford lawyers or I'm going to go straight to prison because a public defender is only
[05:11.630 --> 05:13.510]  there to negotiate a deal.
[05:13.510 --> 05:15.870]  They're not there to beat a case.
[05:15.870 --> 05:21.470]  So if your career at what you do, there was these realities that shaped your decisions
[05:21.470 --> 05:26.670]  and the perp was the first variety that took over a market on a wide level and basically
[05:26.670 --> 05:28.950]  wiped out everything else.
[05:28.950 --> 05:35.030]  And I looked at that situation because I didn't jump on it as quick as I should because I
[05:35.030 --> 05:38.310]  couldn't understand why people were so caught up with it when there was all this killer
[05:38.310 --> 05:40.550]  cannabis we were still consuming and growing.
[05:40.550 --> 05:43.330]  And I was like, oh man, people just aren't making the right decision.
[05:43.330 --> 05:48.330]  And I realized that what I was doing was I was emotionally blinding myself to the market
[05:48.330 --> 05:49.650]  reality.
[05:49.650 --> 05:54.290]  And so when I went down and said, I got you, they're doing it because of this.
[05:54.290 --> 05:57.290]  It let me know that we needed to focus on perp production.
[05:57.290 --> 05:59.250]  We needed to focus on perp nurseries.
[05:59.250 --> 06:03.330]  We needed to get better models to get the perp higher level and more perp because if
[06:03.330 --> 06:08.210]  it was anything under an 80-20 in terms of perp to green ratio, it didn't have the money.
[06:08.210 --> 06:14.010]  So you started seeing perp quantified as hundreds or 90-10s or 80-20s or 70-30s, meaning
[06:14.010 --> 06:16.370]  perp to green ratios.
[06:16.370 --> 06:21.330]  And it's changed the business we're in to the degree that we've never come back to the
[06:21.330 --> 06:23.410]  diversity prior.
[06:23.410 --> 06:29.970]  The small dispensary operations allowed people to be able to move micro loads, 10, 15 pounds
[06:29.970 --> 06:33.890]  to dispensaries in a diverse form for a long time.
[06:33.890 --> 06:38.050]  So most people who aren't old like me that had actually hustle in the day, they got used
[06:38.050 --> 06:41.170]  to 215 protection and storefronts to move pot.
[06:41.170 --> 06:43.210]  And so they said, people love my stuff.
[06:43.210 --> 06:47.570]  They do because you have a storefront to sell it and it's convenient.
[06:47.570 --> 06:51.290]  But as soon as they shut those storefronts down, you're screwed.
[06:51.290 --> 06:53.170]  And everyone said, I'm going to use Instagram.
[06:53.170 --> 06:54.610]  You're screwed when they ban you.
[06:54.610 --> 06:55.610]  I'm going to use Facebook.
[06:55.610 --> 06:56.610]  Sorry, they banned you.
[06:56.610 --> 06:58.650]  I'm going to use Craigslist, they banned you.
[06:58.650 --> 07:01.610]  So all of a sudden, all your marketing tools are gone.
[07:01.610 --> 07:02.890]  You have no tools.
[07:02.890 --> 07:06.490]  And all you now have is desperation where you're begging to find a distributor who will
[07:06.490 --> 07:10.890]  possibly take your product and then find some place to move it.
[07:10.890 --> 07:15.650]  And what takes place is that you are victimized in that process.
[07:15.650 --> 07:20.410]  And when I, when I researched this, I discovered that the poorest person in the economy is
[07:20.410 --> 07:22.250]  the agricultural worker.
[07:22.250 --> 07:27.290]  The agricultural worker is the single lowest paid person in any industry.
[07:27.290 --> 07:31.610]  And I was like, we're going to get buried alive because there is no appreciation for
[07:31.610 --> 07:33.210]  agriculture.
[07:33.210 --> 07:34.570]  That's not how America works.
[07:34.570 --> 07:36.450]  We work off an industrial model.
[07:36.450 --> 07:39.450]  So what we need to work off of is this luxury model.
[07:39.450 --> 07:44.090]  And the luxury model was highlighted in a quote I saw from the guy that owned Rolex.
[07:44.090 --> 07:49.210]  And the world was turbulent and a reporter yelled at the owner of Rolex, how's the watch
[07:49.210 --> 07:50.210]  business?
[07:50.210 --> 07:51.210]  And he goes, I don't know.
[07:51.210 --> 07:52.210]  I'm not in the watch business.
[07:52.210 --> 07:54.670]  I'm in the luxury business and I'm balling.
[07:54.670 --> 07:56.530]  And I was like, I got you.
[07:56.530 --> 08:01.930]  He was able to transcend an industry by perception.
[08:01.930 --> 08:03.890]  And it's perception that you're working with.
[08:03.890 --> 08:11.890]  And right now we're perceived as losers because we somehow aren't able to be $60 million companies.
[08:11.890 --> 08:17.090]  And because of that, consumers don't have access to your products at stores.
[08:17.090 --> 08:22.290]  And so the black market may be pumping because it's cheaper, but the people that are coming
[08:22.290 --> 08:27.490]  into the new market don't buy in that form because they don't know people that are growing.
[08:27.490 --> 08:31.370]  The people that you want to start to sell to are this burgeoning new groups.
[08:31.370 --> 08:33.010]  They only go to storefronts.
[08:33.130 --> 08:36.890]  They only know that access and they're the ones that are going to allow you to be able
[08:36.890 --> 08:41.690]  to get product that's in and move because as they systematically shut down the black
[08:41.690 --> 08:47.330]  market and they will over time, it'll always exist, but I'm not buying any beer on the
[08:47.330 --> 08:48.330]  street corner.
[08:48.330 --> 08:49.770]  I don't, I don't know.
[08:49.770 --> 08:55.050]  There's very few items that we buy that if they can get the tax rates low enough and
[08:55.050 --> 08:58.810]  they can get the supply convenient enough, do you go to all the trouble to get it in
[08:58.810 --> 08:59.810]  the black?
[08:59.810 --> 09:01.810]  You just buy it normally.
[09:01.850 --> 09:06.850]  And so the situation is that you have to be able to figure out what are you doing in the
[09:06.850 --> 09:10.730]  short term so that you can survive in the long term.
[09:10.730 --> 09:15.050]  And what I tell most people is you need to go take a look at your distributor first.
[09:15.050 --> 09:16.530]  Who are you, who are you working with?
[09:16.530 --> 09:20.930]  And this guy knows topics on genetics, but it's the genetics that you're using that allow
[09:20.930 --> 09:23.130]  this to take place.
[09:23.130 --> 09:28.410]  And to me, the discussion of how do you get paid is more important than anything else
[09:28.770 --> 09:31.890]  because you're not going to survive if you don't.
[09:31.890 --> 09:35.570]  And if you're not crystal clear about that shit, then grow six in your yard and enjoy
[09:35.570 --> 09:39.490]  being a cannabis consumer and have the best time you've ever had because they can't get
[09:39.490 --> 09:40.810]  you in trouble for that.
[09:40.810 --> 09:42.170]  And you can enjoy the culture.
[09:42.170 --> 09:43.730]  You can enjoy being a cultivator.
[09:43.730 --> 09:45.390]  You can share with your friends.
[09:45.390 --> 09:47.730]  You can do all this wonderful stuff.
[09:47.730 --> 09:50.770]  But if you're going to be in business, boy, you better be crystal clear who you're playing
[09:50.770 --> 09:51.910]  with.
[09:51.910 --> 09:58.010]  And when I go take a look at operations that are about to spit out 250,000 pounds a year
[09:58.010 --> 10:03.610]  with brilliant individuals running them, with agricultural programs that are on point,
[10:03.610 --> 10:06.210]  how do you compete?
[10:06.210 --> 10:09.210]  And the only way that you're going to do this is through being crafty.
[10:09.210 --> 10:12.370]  And crafty meaning you're good at what you do, but you're sly.
[10:12.370 --> 10:17.250]  And so you have to be able to start to figure out the things that you produce, what regions
[10:17.250 --> 10:20.050]  in the state like those things.
[10:20.050 --> 10:25.750]  I did this United States wide for clone operations because the reality of it is all the cannabis
[10:25.750 --> 10:29.790]  that was grown here, majority of it, 90% was moving out of the area.
[10:29.790 --> 10:35.870]  And so what I did is I did market analysis of all the major regions in the US so I could
[10:35.870 --> 10:37.490]  understand what they wanted.
[10:37.490 --> 10:40.590]  And when you came in and spoke to me, I would have a private consult with you and I'd ask
[10:40.590 --> 10:42.550]  you where you're moving it.
[10:42.550 --> 10:46.010]  And if you were moving it to Florida, I knew what you should grow.
[10:46.010 --> 10:52.550]  And if you were moving it into certain places, certain demographics, certain niches, I could
[10:52.550 --> 10:57.950]  tell you what you should grow so that you had an ability to actually sell the product.
[10:57.950 --> 11:02.030]  Otherwise you're just growing something hoping that it's going to sell.
[11:02.030 --> 11:05.750]  And when the market was underproduced, everything sold.
[11:05.750 --> 11:08.390]  If you lived in Humboldt, you know about Red Dog.
[11:08.390 --> 11:13.670]  Red Dog was this green thing covered in red hair that was, it didn't get you high.
[11:13.670 --> 11:16.990]  She's laughing in the back, but you remember the days of Red Dog when Red Dog ran wild
[11:16.990 --> 11:18.790]  in the hills of Sohum.
[11:18.790 --> 11:20.590]  That shit's biomass fodder.
[11:20.590 --> 11:22.150]  You wouldn't give it to a goat.
[11:22.150 --> 11:24.910]  It was 4,800 bucks a pound.
[11:24.910 --> 11:30.470]  People started to believe that they were actually successful because there was a shortage of
[11:30.470 --> 11:36.610]  product and the fact that you could get it into the system made your shop, made you fly.
[11:36.610 --> 11:39.630]  But as soon as it changed, you were out of business.
[11:39.630 --> 11:44.510]  And so what I recommend to people is you really need to take a look at your supply chain.
[11:44.510 --> 11:48.510]  Who is your distributor and who do they sell to?
[11:48.510 --> 11:53.350]  And the key thing that I think that we need to work on is the ability to hold your genomic
[11:53.350 --> 12:00.310]  forms after you've produced them in a manner that doesn't destroy the quality of the product
[12:00.310 --> 12:03.110]  until it can move into the supply chain.
[12:03.110 --> 12:07.790]  Because once you let go of it, everything I see in the dispensary, almost 90% of it
[12:07.790 --> 12:09.430]  is diminished.
[12:09.430 --> 12:14.590]  And I know most of the people I deal with, I've historically done local sourcing.
[12:14.590 --> 12:18.430]  And so I go and meet you, I check out your stuff and I'm like, it's primo.
[12:18.430 --> 12:22.430]  By the time it gets to me in a jar, it's not primo anymore.
[12:22.430 --> 12:27.390]  And I look at the dates and I realize, wow, that was a seven month timeframe that took
[12:27.390 --> 12:30.650]  for you to get it from here, to get it to me.
[12:30.650 --> 12:33.830]  And how many people are really thrilled right now with their business models?
[12:33.830 --> 12:37.510]  Like man, I'm so happy, I'm just going to jump up and down and cheer.
[12:37.510 --> 12:38.510]  Not many.
[12:38.510 --> 12:43.150]  And a lot of it is because you can't get return on your money at a rate of speed that lets
[12:43.150 --> 12:44.890]  you cover your costs.
[12:44.890 --> 12:48.690]  And so what you have to do is you have to, like I said earlier, is take a look at what
[12:48.690 --> 12:52.870]  you're trying to sell and realize that the things that you produce, as incredible as
[12:52.870 --> 12:57.170]  they may be, don't get rid of them, but sometimes you just have to hold them.
[12:57.170 --> 13:01.250]  So I hold banks of plants that I know will come back into trend.
[13:01.250 --> 13:02.810]  For me, it's old stuff.
[13:02.810 --> 13:05.210]  It's stuff from the 70s, 80s and 90s.
[13:05.210 --> 13:07.810]  Things that make me happy from my youth.
[13:07.810 --> 13:09.490]  I know who I want to go after.
[13:09.490 --> 13:12.530]  I want to go after 50 to 70 year old people.
[13:12.530 --> 13:14.730]  People that have disposable income.
[13:14.730 --> 13:19.830]  Because 30 year olds that are the biggest population of dispensary people are cheap.
[13:19.830 --> 13:22.650]  Because they don't have disposable income, so they're not going to buy a lot of your
[13:22.650 --> 13:25.090]  weed and they're going to buy little bits of your shit and they're going to be hyper
[13:25.090 --> 13:28.770]  picky because that's all they have to do is be picky.
[13:28.770 --> 13:30.610]  And you're in the wrong market.
[13:30.610 --> 13:35.970]  And so for me, I know where I'm going to go because I define it and it allows me to say,
[13:36.490 --> 13:39.650]  my future is to go after things from the past.
[13:39.650 --> 13:41.770]  Does that mean I can sell them today?
[13:41.770 --> 13:42.770]  No.
[13:42.770 --> 13:46.970]  But I will in the future once we can start to establish our market share.
[13:46.970 --> 13:49.370]  What am I doing this season on my own farm?
[13:49.370 --> 13:50.370]  Biomass.
[13:50.370 --> 13:56.810]  Because I know that I said, if I can get 500 a pound versus 700 a pound and it leaves all
[13:56.810 --> 14:02.330]  in two days and it comes back in two months, why that's a good business decision.
[14:02.330 --> 14:05.890]  And yes, I might lose total profit potentially.
[14:05.930 --> 14:08.370]  But more than likely I'm going to make way more than I ever would have made if I tried
[14:08.370 --> 14:09.730]  to play the weed game.
[14:09.730 --> 14:13.850]  I'm looking at so many people jarring shit up and I'm like, this is unbelievable.
[14:13.850 --> 14:18.250]  You're not going to sell this crap and by the time you do, it's going to be diminished
[14:18.250 --> 14:21.330]  and it's going to make you look like you're inferior.
[14:21.330 --> 14:27.090]  And so when I go to, I tour dispensaries constantly and I look at product nonstop and I go, wow,
[14:27.090 --> 14:29.210]  I saw the truth of it.
[14:29.210 --> 14:34.370]  People love indoor because the people who do indoor production are typically better
[14:34.370 --> 14:38.690]  financed because in order to put together a 3000 light operation, you have to have a
[14:38.690 --> 14:39.810]  lot of money.
[14:39.810 --> 14:44.050]  And when you have a lot of money, you also have financial planners that say, hey, we
[14:44.050 --> 14:45.530]  need to have supply chain management.
[14:45.530 --> 14:47.530]  So let's get a distribution license.
[14:47.530 --> 14:50.090]  Let's get a partner that has storefront ability.
[14:50.090 --> 14:52.450]  Let's get packaging and manufacturing.
[14:52.450 --> 14:56.850]  And so all of a sudden they can get their product to the store in two months.
[14:56.850 --> 15:00.810]  So indoor in two months is different than outdoor in seven months.
[15:00.810 --> 15:04.350]  And the problem with it is, is the customer is unhappy.
[15:04.350 --> 15:11.030]  And so I go in and have friends that buy product from an incredible number of dispensaries
[15:11.030 --> 15:13.030]  because they're older and they have money.
[15:13.030 --> 15:14.910]  They're affluent and they love weed.
[15:14.910 --> 15:20.790]  And so they sample pot constantly and they're never ending lead dismayed at the quality
[15:20.790 --> 15:24.790]  and they're always horrified at Humboldt and Trinity and Mendocino.
[15:24.790 --> 15:27.150]  God, the herb is fucked.
[15:27.150 --> 15:31.150]  And I said, it's not, let me bring you up to Humboldt and let's go smoke fresh weed.
[15:31.150 --> 15:34.390]  And then they're like, my God, it's the best pot I ever smoked.
[15:34.390 --> 15:37.270]  But it's lost in translation.
[15:37.270 --> 15:41.550]  And so what I tell people that are caught in these situations is that you need to have
[15:41.550 --> 15:47.750]  flour that is rock hard because processing and manufacturing will not damage it.
[15:47.750 --> 15:53.190]  It needs to not be so monoterp dominant because unless they keep that stuff at below 68, you're
[15:53.190 --> 15:54.190]  going to destroy it.
[15:54.190 --> 15:58.830]  It needs to be heavy sesquid dominant so that when they smoke it and burn it, they get the
[15:58.830 --> 16:00.710]  experience.
[16:01.270 --> 16:05.390]  And you need to make sure that it yields enough in a convenient enough way so that you're
[16:05.390 --> 16:08.310]  actually making money on what you're doing.
[16:08.310 --> 16:09.830]  And people like, yeah, but that's commercial.
[16:09.830 --> 16:12.190]  I said, no, no, it's targeted.
[16:12.190 --> 16:14.270]  Commercial is massive production.
[16:14.270 --> 16:19.430]  You're doing targeted production and you're putting yourself in a situation by using genetic
[16:19.430 --> 16:23.030]  choices to find things that work.
[16:23.030 --> 16:31.110]  One of the things I think that's an important point is that you find what variety worked
[16:31.110 --> 16:36.110]  under what methodology because you're going to choose things that your friend grew.
[16:36.110 --> 16:40.130]  And the problem is that your location doesn't produce the same product.
[16:40.130 --> 16:43.670]  So some things need to have a cooler temperature.
[16:43.670 --> 16:47.790]  And if it's warmer, you flare off these monos no matter what you do.
[16:47.790 --> 16:51.990]  And if it's not sunny and hot enough, you don't get density.
[16:51.990 --> 16:53.470]  And therefore, that's an issue.
[16:53.470 --> 16:57.110]  And so when you're trying to match up what you put on the market and you're choosing
[16:57.110 --> 17:01.590]  things that people have, what you're trying to do is make sure all the factors match so
[17:01.590 --> 17:03.070]  that you can actually take data.
[17:03.070 --> 17:04.350]  It's called extrapolating.
[17:04.350 --> 17:09.110]  If I take data from one set and apply it to another, it doesn't mean it's accurate.
[17:09.110 --> 17:10.110]  It doesn't.
[17:10.110 --> 17:12.790]  You have to make sure that everything holds true in both sets.
[17:12.790 --> 17:16.350]  Otherwise, what you're doing is you're doing a guess.
[17:16.350 --> 17:19.590]  And what we want to be able to do is take the information that you all have, which is
[17:19.590 --> 17:25.670]  this unbelievable quantity of information of how do you create incredible cannabis,
[17:25.670 --> 17:29.870]  and then what varieties shined in those production methodologies.
[17:29.870 --> 17:33.430]  And then instead of looking at your neighbor like he's your frigging competitor, he's not.
[17:33.430 --> 17:34.930]  He's your collaborator.
[17:34.930 --> 17:37.110]  You're all basically in collusion if you...
[17:37.110 --> 17:40.710]  I have to be careful because I get yelled at when I say those words because price fixing
[17:40.710 --> 17:43.870]  and collusion scare the regulators.
[17:43.870 --> 17:45.670]  But that is the drug business.
[17:45.670 --> 17:47.030]  And it's also community business.
[17:47.190 --> 17:51.590]  And as long as you don't agree to set price, you can most definitely communicate about
[17:51.590 --> 17:53.630]  how to do production.
[17:53.630 --> 18:00.910]  And what I did for this event was Josh brought me this incredible plant that he bred.
[18:00.910 --> 18:09.070]  So Josh, a humble guy, excellent cultivator, and very good at sifting good genetic material.
[18:09.070 --> 18:11.190]  And he says, Kev, I sifted this out.
[18:11.190 --> 18:12.630]  I want to give you a copy.
[18:12.630 --> 18:13.630]  Here's some of the flower.
[18:13.630 --> 18:14.630]  Here's the plant.
[18:14.630 --> 18:16.550]  And I smelled it and I said, holy shit.
[18:16.550 --> 18:17.910]  It's sellable.
[18:17.910 --> 18:22.270]  And so I did the snake charma test where I put it in a jar and I hold it up to you.
[18:22.270 --> 18:24.430]  And when you smell it, I move the jar around.
[18:24.430 --> 18:29.350]  And if I can get you to dance with the jar back and forth, and then you realize I got
[18:29.350 --> 18:31.390]  you, I got you.
[18:31.390 --> 18:35.550]  So that lets me clearly know that you were enthralled by the flower so much that you
[18:35.550 --> 18:39.430]  didn't give a shit that I was making you move up and down and jump all over the place.
[18:39.430 --> 18:44.110]  Then you realize, whoa, I was so attracted to the flower that you had hypnotized me like
[18:44.110 --> 18:45.510]  it was a flute.
[18:45.510 --> 18:47.590]  And it's snake charming.
[18:47.590 --> 18:53.550]  And so then we go, okay, it has the nose to grab someone's attention.
[18:53.550 --> 18:57.670]  And then you smoke it and you go, yes, it matches profile.
[18:57.670 --> 19:02.470]  The expectation of the nose is delivered in the mouth so that you don't let someone down.
[19:02.470 --> 19:05.390]  How many times have you smoked something that was incredible in the nose and it was hay
[19:05.390 --> 19:09.070]  in the mouth and you're like, hey, garbage.
[19:09.070 --> 19:11.510]  And so the problem is you're disappointed.
[19:11.510 --> 19:13.030]  So you can't disappoint them.
[19:13.030 --> 19:14.230]  So the profiles have to match.
[19:14.230 --> 19:18.510]  I'd rather have it low in the nose and awesome in the mouth than vice versa.
[19:18.510 --> 19:21.830]  And so his variety matched identically.
[19:21.830 --> 19:26.230]  And so I'm someone who studies market and I'm good at picking things that go into markets.
[19:26.230 --> 19:31.030]  And I said, ooh, that has everything we want in taste and in smell.
[19:31.030 --> 19:33.510]  Visually, it works.
[19:33.510 --> 19:34.510]  What's the highlight?
[19:34.510 --> 19:35.710]  Beautiful.
[19:35.710 --> 19:37.630]  And I said, oh, this is a tool.
[19:37.630 --> 19:40.990]  And it's not a tool that you need to switch your whole garden to, but it's something that
[19:40.990 --> 19:42.790]  you produce.
[19:42.790 --> 19:47.550]  And what you do is as a cultivator, you're not allowed to do a lot of the things you
[19:47.550 --> 19:48.870]  were prior.
[19:48.870 --> 19:52.910]  But just like today, I'm bringing six plants because I can bring six plants anywhere I
[19:52.910 --> 19:53.910]  want.
[19:53.910 --> 19:55.910]  I'm allowed to have six plants in my possession anytime I choose.
[19:55.910 --> 19:59.550]  So therefore I can bring six plants into this building and I can hand them to you with no
[19:59.550 --> 20:00.990]  illegalities.
[20:00.990 --> 20:05.390]  You can go to any one of these dispensaries across the state with an ounce in your pocket
[20:05.390 --> 20:09.990]  and you can go and meet the people who are running these facilities and you can say,
[20:09.990 --> 20:12.530]  here, here's some stuff that we mess around with.
[20:13.270 --> 20:15.890]  And what you do is you hit them with shit that slaps them in the mouth so hard it basically
[20:15.890 --> 20:18.490]  takes the teeth out of the back of the jaw.
[20:18.490 --> 20:23.170]  And they go, wow, that's incredible because it's something that most people don't get
[20:23.170 --> 20:24.170]  their hands on.
[20:24.170 --> 20:25.750]  And that's an introduction.
[20:25.750 --> 20:28.630]  So things like that allow you to open doors.
[20:28.630 --> 20:33.270]  And so what I did is I brought these plants in and I said, I'm going to auction them off
[20:33.270 --> 20:36.190]  me and you're going to pull straws to see who gets them.
[20:36.190 --> 20:39.910]  But the real truth of it is, is that I'm going to give them to you and you're going to figure
[20:40.010 --> 20:42.810]  out a bunch of you share the goddamn thing.
[20:42.810 --> 20:46.330]  You're going to take the plants and you're going to say, listen, I'll cultivate it.
[20:46.330 --> 20:50.570]  I can share a clone because you can share clones amongst each other as cultivators.
[20:50.570 --> 20:54.030]  Every farm has an ability to produce its own material.
[20:54.030 --> 21:00.690]  I helped write these laws on how nurseries, farms and stores interrelate because I have
[21:00.690 --> 21:01.770]  all of them.
[21:01.770 --> 21:07.370]  And I said, nursery should be able to sell product, but not retail.
[21:07.390 --> 21:10.190]  Farms should be able to not be a slave to a nursery.
[21:10.190 --> 21:13.550]  They should be able to have their own nursery option, but they shouldn't be able to sell
[21:13.550 --> 21:18.550]  the nursery products they grow because then it, then it competes with the nursery.
[21:18.550 --> 21:23.090]  Stores should be able to sell the retail so that each one of these operations has an ability
[21:23.090 --> 21:28.290]  to make money because otherwise what happens is you're favoring one over another and they
[21:28.290 --> 21:29.650]  all have to get paid.
[21:29.650 --> 21:33.470]  A good business deal is both of us walk away satisfied.
[21:33.470 --> 21:36.430]  If we, if we walk away pissed off, bad business.
[21:36.490 --> 21:40.170]  So in order to make it work, you have to create a fairness.
[21:40.170 --> 21:44.370]  And in the situation that we created so that we'd be able to have some kind of success
[21:44.370 --> 21:48.970]  in the different forms was that individuals who had their own farms could do their own
[21:48.970 --> 21:50.650]  nurseries for themselves.
[21:50.650 --> 21:54.270]  They could breed, they could produce seed, they could produce clonal form.
[21:54.270 --> 21:56.210]  You can share six plants.
[21:56.210 --> 22:01.610]  And so I brought these plants in, I propped up some plants and I brought in six and I'm
[22:01.610 --> 22:02.690]  going to give them out.
[22:02.690 --> 22:06.010]  But what you want to be able to do is don't be a prick and hoard it.
[22:06.010 --> 22:11.110]  Take the plant and share it with the people that you know so that what you have is something
[22:11.110 --> 22:17.510]  that was selected out of 400 plants in a greenhouse in Washington that absolutely caught my eye
[22:17.510 --> 22:21.750]  so heavily that I said, Whoa, that's the introduction.
[22:21.750 --> 22:26.030]  You take something like that, you use that as an introduction to the, to the stores,
[22:26.030 --> 22:31.150]  you introduce it to your distributors because when they smell it, it's instant sellability.
[22:31.150 --> 22:34.230]  And what it does, it allows you to start to enter a market.
[22:34.250 --> 22:36.930]  And then now you start to get a conversation.
[22:36.930 --> 22:42.330]  But when you're having to give things that are delicate and nuanced and fragile and designed
[22:42.330 --> 22:48.950]  for people who are more caught up in the ethereal qualities of cannabis, that's a limited number.
[22:48.950 --> 22:52.690]  So in all our minds, everyone knows pot like this.
[22:52.690 --> 22:54.550]  And then people get pissed off at bud tenders.
[22:54.550 --> 22:55.550]  They don't know what they're doing.
[22:55.550 --> 22:56.550]  I had to give them an education.
[22:56.550 --> 22:57.550]  I'm like, they get paid 15 bucks an hour.
[22:57.550 --> 22:58.550]  What do you expect?
[22:58.550 --> 23:01.650]  You could pay 400,000 a year to grow weed.
[23:01.650 --> 23:05.070]  Of course you're intelligent at it because you get paid for it and you get to spend all
[23:05.070 --> 23:06.450]  your time doing it.
[23:06.450 --> 23:11.190]  But someone who's making almost minimum wage, how smart do you think they are about your
[23:11.190 --> 23:14.990]  product and you're going to give them this long drawn out bullshit story about how special
[23:14.990 --> 23:15.990]  you are.
[23:15.990 --> 23:16.990]  And they're like, look, I'm here to get a fucking paycheck.
[23:16.990 --> 23:20.830]  I just want to do my job, but they don't want to do a bad job.
[23:20.830 --> 23:24.230]  It's just that how much education can they possibly have?
[23:24.230 --> 23:28.590]  Little, unless you paid tenders 30 bucks an hour, which is like a living wage and they
[23:28.590 --> 23:29.830]  don't.
[23:29.850 --> 23:31.770]  So what you have to do is make it easy.
[23:31.770 --> 23:32.770]  You have to make things loud.
[23:32.770 --> 23:34.570]  You have to make things rich.
[23:34.570 --> 23:36.790]  You have to make them to where they're sellable.
[23:36.790 --> 23:40.930]  And then what it does is it allows a tender to recommend a product that then makes them
[23:40.930 --> 23:41.930]  look good.
[23:41.930 --> 23:44.970]  So the person who comes back doesn't tell them you recommended some bullshit.
[23:44.970 --> 23:49.570]  I don't want to deal with you anymore because everyone who buys weed, I, my whole career,
[23:49.570 --> 23:51.050]  I've seen it.
[23:51.050 --> 23:55.850]  They are not connoisseur in anything, but when they come in, they break out a loop.
[23:55.870 --> 23:58.230]  I'm like, holy Christ, here it comes.
[23:58.230 --> 24:02.530]  Because in cannabis, you could be ultra picky and have this ultra high level, but everything
[24:02.530 --> 24:04.630]  else in your life, your car's dirty.
[24:04.630 --> 24:06.190]  Your fucking sneakers are falling apart.
[24:06.190 --> 24:07.910]  Your house is a shithole.
[24:07.910 --> 24:10.270]  You got friends that are, that are, that are nuts.
[24:10.270 --> 24:14.750]  But with your herb, you're the most discriminating connoisseur in the planet.
[24:14.750 --> 24:19.990]  And since that's a reality, you have to work with that reality.
[24:19.990 --> 24:22.230]  And what you do is you make it easy.
[24:22.230 --> 24:26.290]  And so I know some people are gonna be like, damn, I was going to win me one of those plants.
[24:26.290 --> 24:29.050]  But really what I want to do is I want to give them, you all figure out who gets them.
[24:29.050 --> 24:32.090]  I'm going to put them on the table and you all figure out who gets them and get some,
[24:32.090 --> 24:35.330]  share some phone numbers and say, look, give me a cut of that thing when you prop it because
[24:35.330 --> 24:37.650]  you can share a cut with your friends.
[24:37.650 --> 24:40.970]  And what you're doing is you're doing regenerative culture.
[24:40.970 --> 24:43.210]  You want to live, you, you better work together.
[24:43.210 --> 24:45.050]  You're going to die.
[24:45.050 --> 24:46.170]  And it is so clear.
[24:46.170 --> 24:51.050]  I get to, I get to do consultation for some of the largest companies in the world and
[24:51.950 --> 24:53.190]  I don't go visit them.
[24:53.190 --> 24:56.510]  I make them come visit me here because it brings them down to your level.
[24:56.510 --> 24:58.070]  So they have to fly into Humboldt.
[24:58.070 --> 25:00.710]  They got to rent a car, drive to my greenhouse.
[25:00.710 --> 25:02.310]  And I look like I'm homeless half the time.
[25:02.310 --> 25:03.310]  I shaved today.
[25:03.310 --> 25:04.310]  I'm serious.
[25:04.310 --> 25:05.310]  I shaved today.
[25:05.310 --> 25:06.310]  Otherwise I'll look like the janitor.
[25:06.310 --> 25:11.070]  And, and half the time when people meet me the first time, they think I am the janitor
[25:11.070 --> 25:13.750]  and they ask me, hey, where's the guy that I'm supposed to talk to?
[25:13.750 --> 25:16.870]  And I always bust their balls and say, oh, the smart guys are in that other room.
[25:16.870 --> 25:21.030]  And they all go there and then they have to come back and they go, oh, it's, it's, it's
[25:21.030 --> 25:24.970]  a, and for me it's great because I like to play games like that because I'm really checking
[25:24.970 --> 25:26.770]  you out as a person.
[25:26.770 --> 25:29.610]  And what we're doing is we're mentally wrestling.
[25:29.610 --> 25:34.610]  And once we even the playing field, now you're going to have to play.
[25:34.610 --> 25:38.210]  And that's the point of this, this lecture is that, man, I've, I've done these lectures
[25:38.210 --> 25:43.410]  forever on this stuff, but this one's specific because it's about everyone in the room that
[25:43.410 --> 25:46.110]  I experienced that cannabis is really good grass.
[25:46.110 --> 25:50.630]  I would say across the board, 95% of the stuff that I see the people in the space produce
[25:50.730 --> 25:53.930]  and I smoke and I see it's gorgeous pot.
[25:53.930 --> 25:59.330]  The question is who you're selling it to and how do you get it to them and how do you make
[25:59.330 --> 26:03.650]  sure you have something that the market wants and how do you make sure you're not just looking
[26:03.650 --> 26:08.210]  on Instagram saying, oh my God, I need a Skittle gelato hybrid or I'm screwed.
[26:08.210 --> 26:10.290]  Well the problem is everyone else has the same idea.
[26:10.290 --> 26:13.530]  If I don't have purple punch, I'm, I'm, well, you get purple punch, you got punched in the
[26:13.530 --> 26:16.490]  eye, you got a black eye because people only buy it once.
[26:16.510 --> 26:21.710]  Now you can hybridize it and take those, those visual qualities forward, but if you're consuming
[26:21.710 --> 26:27.650]  it, you're like, yes, all I no nose, no mouth, no power, Instagram pot.
[26:27.650 --> 26:33.930]  And so the people that are in cannabis, unfortunately, because we was so, and I was too, I was someone
[26:33.930 --> 26:35.750]  who had multiple identities.
[26:35.750 --> 26:40.670]  I used to change rigs and, and, and outfits to go check all the operations I ran.
[26:40.670 --> 26:43.270]  I was somebody who was constantly under surveillance.
[26:43.270 --> 26:47.170]  I used to have the cops going through my trash and I used to take all the dog shit
[26:47.170 --> 26:51.530]  in the yard and put it in the garbage so that when they went through the fucking bags, that's
[26:51.530 --> 26:54.290]  what they got was a bag of shit.
[26:54.290 --> 27:00.570]  And, and so, you know, I had to pay the price for this, but the bottom line is that I was
[27:00.570 --> 27:14.900]  somebody who was living in a, I was living a very secretive, quiet life and I'm not,
[27:14.920 --> 27:20.040]  I'm someone who loves to talk about what we're doing, but I'm not someone who's loud in public.
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.000]  I'm kind of quiet, which people find hard to believe, but actually I am.
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.080]  And I was very secretive with what I did criminally because I came from a criminal background
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.480]  from family members that were in organized crime.
[27:33.480 --> 27:39.760]  And so I learned, let's shut your mouth and never rat on your crew and you be intelligent
[27:39.760 --> 27:42.560]  every step of the way because the punishment's real.
[27:42.580 --> 27:47.820]  And when you go and visit your family in prison year after year, you go, oh, the punishment's real.
[27:47.820 --> 27:50.260]  And so I was very, very quiet.
[27:50.260 --> 27:56.300]  And when I got into the position to be in what we call legal cannabis, what I did was
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.460]  I realized that in order for me to make the education work, I had to shut off all my black
[28:00.460 --> 28:02.140]  market operations.
[28:02.140 --> 28:07.220]  So I took this massive pay cut to become normal.
[28:07.220 --> 28:10.060]  And everyone who knew me was like, they thought I lost my mind.
[28:10.060 --> 28:12.540]  They were like, you lost your frigging mind, man.
[28:12.540 --> 28:14.520]  You're basically going to be poor.
[28:14.520 --> 28:16.160]  And I said, kinda.
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.700]  What I'm going to do is be free so that no matter what I do, anywhere I go, I'm not afraid
[28:21.700 --> 28:23.640]  of you coming to my house and checking out my shit.
[28:23.640 --> 28:28.120]  Matter of fact, every event I put on, I invited the sheriffs and all the regulators.
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.360]  So much so that eventually they just said, fuck, we don't need to be around you anymore
[28:31.360 --> 28:33.240]  because it's almost a waste of time.
[28:33.240 --> 28:41.080]  But what it did was it let me participate at a level of involvement that was absolute
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.820]  to where I wasn't half stepping.
[28:42.820 --> 28:44.540]  I wasn't toe dipping.
[28:44.540 --> 28:50.300]  I was fully submerged in the real because I was so afraid that I was going to reach
[28:50.300 --> 28:53.860]  older age and be working at Walmart.
[28:53.860 --> 28:58.620]  I'd spent my whole life in cannabis and it was such an incredible life and it was such
[28:58.620 --> 29:05.340]  a rich, full, rewarding life that I realized that I need to figure this out.
[29:05.340 --> 29:07.780]  And there was nobody that had a map.
[29:07.780 --> 29:09.220]  I didn't copy anybody.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.600]  I was the first person to do a vertical nursery in the country.
[29:13.600 --> 29:18.140]  And so these models that I was coming up with were based off the fact that I was looking
[29:18.140 --> 29:25.840]  for a way through a problem and because I didn't have any fear of you catching me and
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.460]  I knew that there was no statute of limitations issue with what I had done because I hadn't
[29:29.460 --> 29:33.920]  done any capital crimes, I could be unbelievably open.
[29:33.920 --> 29:39.540]  And because of it, it let me connect into the media and it let me connect into universities
[29:39.540 --> 29:44.500]  and it let me connect into academia and it let me connect into massive businesses and
[29:44.500 --> 29:48.980]  it allowed me to be able to get an education to a degree that almost no one I know has
[29:48.980 --> 29:54.400]  because I've spoken to every monster in the game and what they wanted was my knowledge
[29:54.400 --> 29:56.820]  of a thing and I made them trade me knowledge.
[29:56.820 --> 29:59.300]  I wouldn't let you hire me as a consultant.
[29:59.300 --> 30:02.800]  You got to play a game with me because I already had most of my stuff.
[30:02.800 --> 30:08.340]  I own my property, I own my home and I made enough money doing legal cannabis on a salary
[30:08.340 --> 30:11.300]  that I could afford to take care of my children and pay my basic bills.
[30:11.300 --> 30:14.100]  I just didn't have disposable money anymore.
[30:14.100 --> 30:18.580]  But the fact that I had already achieved the success and I was building businesses that
[30:18.580 --> 30:24.140]  were generating millions of dollars let me have an audience which then let me have an
[30:24.140 --> 30:31.620]  ability to use that power to blow a hole in the wall so that everybody behind me that
[30:31.640 --> 30:33.760]  I knew could run through it.
[30:33.760 --> 30:37.900]  So when I'm able to take a look at a market and say that's the hot spot I go and tell
[30:37.900 --> 30:41.680]  my friends that's the hot spot and that's something that I found that I'm historically
[30:41.680 --> 30:44.760]  good at is it's a game called where's the money?
[30:44.760 --> 30:45.760]  It's over there.
[30:45.760 --> 30:46.760]  I can see the money.
[30:46.760 --> 30:47.760]  It moved.
[30:47.760 --> 30:51.480]  It's over there now and I make sure I pay attention to this and I make sure I use the
[30:51.480 --> 30:56.960]  tools that I have to share the information with the people I'm around because unlike
[30:56.960 --> 31:00.880]  a lot of people I saw drugs on a global level.
[31:00.880 --> 31:04.440]  When I get in trouble as a kid I went in the military.
[31:04.440 --> 31:09.140]  When I got out of training school I go back to high school and graduate and I looked at
[31:09.140 --> 31:12.440]  all my friends and I realized we were all going to go to prison for the rest of our
[31:12.440 --> 31:14.640]  lives and a bunch of them were going to die and they did.
[31:14.640 --> 31:18.840]  They were in the joint for the rest of their life for crime or they got killed in crime.
[31:18.840 --> 31:23.040]  And I was like this isn't what I want and I didn't have any alternative so I went in
[31:23.040 --> 31:24.040]  the military.
[31:24.120 --> 31:31.160]  When I went in the military I became a salvage diver and because I was young and I was bold
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.040]  I would dive on any project.
[31:33.040 --> 31:38.360]  And so the military used to loan me out to the DOJ and the DEA and in the mid 80s I used
[31:38.360 --> 31:42.080]  to get dropped out of helicopters in the middle of the ocean on billions of dollars worth
[31:42.080 --> 31:43.400]  of drugs.
[31:43.400 --> 31:48.520]  So I got to see what hundreds of tons of cannabis and cocaine looked like coming into the country
[31:48.600 --> 31:54.280]  and I realized holy shit we're smoking a lot of weed.
[31:54.280 --> 31:59.320]  And I realized that nobody that you were in around was a competitor because nobody that
[31:59.320 --> 32:03.400]  you knew was producing 120 tons of weed.
[32:03.400 --> 32:09.720]  And it was in these conversations with the drug traffickers that I realized and they
[32:09.720 --> 32:14.680]  helped me understand it that really I was actually way more like them than I was the
[32:14.680 --> 32:20.160]  military and that the future of the world was going to be cannabis.
[32:20.160 --> 32:24.160]  And so I just said well I might as well start to restudy it on a scientific level.
[32:24.160 --> 32:28.560]  And when I got out of the military in 89 I sparked up indoor using the government vehicle
[32:28.560 --> 32:30.780]  to pick up all my lights.
[32:30.780 --> 32:35.760]  And so that background of seeing cannabis in the billion dollar levels and seeing you
[32:35.760 --> 32:40.660]  know half a billion dollars of cocaine and you realize there's a lot of drugs being consumed.
[32:40.660 --> 32:46.060]  And so it changed my perspective on the people I'm around because you are not my competitor.
[32:46.060 --> 32:47.500]  You are not.
[32:47.500 --> 32:54.180]  The hole is so huge that the perception that we're in competition is what screwed us because
[32:54.180 --> 32:57.940]  you had petty competition with each other and you didn't share the info.
[32:57.940 --> 32:59.780]  You don't share the genomic forms.
[32:59.780 --> 33:01.100]  You don't share the contacts.
[33:01.100 --> 33:02.900]  You don't share the connects.
[33:02.900 --> 33:07.020]  And I'm someone who historically always have because of that experience.
[33:07.020 --> 33:11.620]  And it changed me because when you realize that nobody that you're around is the competitor,
[33:11.620 --> 33:17.500]  they're your collaborator, what it does it starts to allow you to share information.
[33:17.500 --> 33:23.340]  And I was been able to use that ability to gather knowledge so that I could survive.
[33:23.340 --> 33:25.100]  And I'm always really clear about it.
[33:25.100 --> 33:28.680]  My mission is to not be 65 years old working at Walmart.
[33:28.680 --> 33:32.400]  And I don't fault you if you work there but I know damn well you wish you weren't.
[33:32.400 --> 33:36.500]  You really wish you weren't having to work at 65 years old, make a minimum wage, having
[33:36.500 --> 33:41.020]  to figure out how to chop up tuna can into six meals because otherwise you're going to
[33:41.020 --> 33:42.020]  be broke.
[33:42.020 --> 33:43.500]  And I've seen enough people that were poor.
[33:43.500 --> 33:47.740]  I was around enough poverty, enough struggle to realize that when you're young you can
[33:47.740 --> 33:48.900]  handle the beating.
[33:48.900 --> 33:53.580]  But when you're older you might not be able to and if God help you, you get sick.
[33:53.580 --> 33:58.860]  And so my whole direction was I believe that cannabis will one day be normalized and I
[33:58.860 --> 34:05.380]  believe one day we will have a craft industry but how do we get from there to here?
[34:05.460 --> 34:08.060]  And so that's why I give up so much information.
[34:08.060 --> 34:13.020]  All the video stuff I shoot is to share this information is really because I was covered
[34:13.020 --> 34:14.860]  so heavily by all the major media.
[34:14.860 --> 34:19.020]  I've been in every newspaper in the country at the same time simultaneously multiple times.
[34:19.020 --> 34:23.300]  So if there's 1500 newspapers in America I was in every one of them same day.
[34:23.300 --> 34:24.300]  Over and over.
[34:24.300 --> 34:29.240]  It was unreal and it was something that I didn't intend to have happen, it just did.
[34:29.240 --> 34:34.740]  But I realized that if I use that as a tool then I would be able to use it as a tool to
[34:34.780 --> 34:36.540]  help out my crew.
[34:36.540 --> 34:40.740]  And when I get into medical cannabis really heavily I realized that my crew was everybody
[34:40.740 --> 34:43.660]  I was involved with in any capacity.
[34:43.660 --> 34:45.700]  And so that's what the lecture today is really about.
[34:45.700 --> 34:50.660]  What we did is we brought in all these killer breeders because the breeders are the individuals
[34:50.660 --> 34:55.580]  that give you paint that you use to paint your picture.
[34:55.580 --> 35:00.780]  And the picture that people want to buy changes over time and you can only be so intelligent
[35:00.780 --> 35:02.120]  with your palette.
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.160]  And so what you need to do is you need to have access to other people's palettes.
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.640]  And the palettes that they use you can then use to freshen up your paint so you're still
[35:10.640 --> 35:12.840]  in the selling art business.
[35:12.840 --> 35:16.800]  Otherwise you're in the hanging the art business and people aren't buying it.
[35:16.800 --> 35:22.360]  And to me the breeder is completely diminished because no one understands really the work
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.880]  it takes to do what they do.
[35:23.880 --> 35:26.680]  And so I get connected to breeding all the time but I'm not a breeder.
[35:26.680 --> 35:31.400]  I'm someone who's a seed reproducer where I hold genomic forms in seed form because
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.920]  I've been raided and arm robbed and workers kill shit and you kill shit to where I've
[35:36.920 --> 35:39.840]  lost so much material that I like redundancy.
[35:39.840 --> 35:44.020]  So if I can take something I like and put it into seed form I can seal it, put it away
[35:44.020 --> 35:47.920]  and hopefully I can keep that genomic form through time.
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.960]  So my breeding desires are really to hold material and then to do sifting.
[35:52.960 --> 35:55.240]  But I don't breed for stabilized lines.
[35:55.240 --> 35:56.880]  I don't breed for the market.
[35:56.880 --> 35:59.280]  So I don't consider myself a breeder at all.
[35:59.280 --> 36:04.040]  And I highlight the people that I do consider breeders because what it does it allows me
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.040]  to utilize their artistic ability to stay current.
[36:08.040 --> 36:12.800]  And if I can be somehow involved with them in a positive way where I can promote them,
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.200]  I can carry their work, I can introduce them to the public, I can then utilize them in
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.720]  collaboration then what happens is we both survive.
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.080]  I stay current, the breeder stays current.
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.520]  And so it was the basis of the whole breeder series we did a couple years back where I
[36:28.560 --> 36:29.560]  paid for all of that.
[36:29.560 --> 36:30.680]  That was that's free.
[36:30.680 --> 36:34.840]  So my company paid for all of that because I wanted the public to understand that as
[36:34.840 --> 36:41.640]  much prop as you give me, I'm only someone who works with material that I get from them.
[36:41.640 --> 36:44.680]  And I wanted people to understand who the them was.
[36:44.680 --> 36:49.720]  And I wanted people to understand what made them and what drove them and where do they
[36:49.720 --> 36:55.160]  see the directions coming so that people could make an emotional connection to them and then
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.440]  say you're the person I want to work with because my desire is pain relief in cannabis.
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.680]  I want to go that route and you're someone who bred for that specifically in all your
[37:03.680 --> 37:04.680]  lines.
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.560]  Your selection process was for people who are in extreme pain.
[37:08.560 --> 37:10.920]  You're someone who breeds for visual stunning.
[37:10.920 --> 37:13.020]  You understand trendy market.
[37:13.020 --> 37:15.120]  You're someone who breeds for resistance.
[37:15.120 --> 37:17.440]  You're someone who breeds for biomass.
[37:17.440 --> 37:19.960]  You're someone who breeds for extraction.
[37:19.960 --> 37:22.120]  Every one of these people have a specific direction.
[37:22.120 --> 37:23.120]  You can't be all of them.
[37:23.120 --> 37:24.400]  I don't care how bright you are.
[37:24.640 --> 37:28.440]  I meet some of the smartest people in the world and I'm telling you some of them can't
[37:28.440 --> 37:30.200]  tie their frigging shoe.
[37:30.200 --> 37:36.560]  They have to wear Velcro but they can split an atom and they can't tie their shoes because
[37:36.560 --> 37:39.520]  you're not everybody in all things.
[37:39.520 --> 37:44.520]  And cannabis is so massive and so diverse and so complicated and so complex that the
[37:44.520 --> 37:49.200]  only way you're going to survive is if you paint the picture so that everyone has some
[37:49.200 --> 37:51.000]  kind of equal credit.
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.840]  And in that direction what you do is you end up having the ability to access these people.
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.160]  So this situation today is to bring in all these killer breeders that are just fantastic
[38:01.160 --> 38:05.920]  at what they do and what it does it lets you get to see them in real life and start to
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.480]  introduce yourself to them so that you can access what they do as time goes forward so
[38:10.480 --> 38:15.200]  that if the trends change and the products that you grow are no longer moving on the
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.640]  market you know where to go to get materials so that you can repaint your work.
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.000]  My recommend is don't ever get rid of your core material.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.480]  Hold it because all things come back in time.
[38:27.480 --> 38:29.200]  Plaid is trendy.
[38:29.200 --> 38:30.800]  Polka dots are trendy.
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.560]  And so at one point red hot then not now back.
[38:34.560 --> 38:37.680]  And the thing is that if all you in cannabis and I'd say you know there's a few a year
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.240]  my age but most of you probably 20 years younger than me.
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.480]  You're going to see that these trends keep rotating through and I don't think any of
[38:44.480 --> 38:48.400]  you want to get out of cannabis so you wouldn't be in a regenerative conference because what
[38:48.400 --> 38:50.360]  you're doing is timelessness.
[38:50.360 --> 38:53.780]  You're trying to build something that transcends time.
[38:53.780 --> 38:57.120]  My desire is to be able to also participate in that.
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.400]  I want to take the property that I use to make money and I wanted to turn it into a
[39:01.400 --> 39:04.200]  farm so that my children could hold it over time.
[39:04.200 --> 39:08.520]  I wanted to turn it into something that had an ability to be an asset and not a liability
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.200]  so it was never sold.
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.200]  I wanted to be able to treat it as a preserve so that all the animals that were there still
[39:15.200 --> 39:16.200]  remained.
[39:16.200 --> 39:18.000]  I wanted to bring in biodiversity.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.800]  I got exposed to all these brilliant people through what I do and I realized man I want
[39:22.800 --> 39:24.360]  to do that too.
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.920]  But I also realized if I fuck this up I'm going to have to sell it and I don't have
[39:28.920 --> 39:30.600]  time to make that mistake.
[39:30.600 --> 39:34.680]  And so what I did is I looked at every single aspect that needed to be covered done and
[39:34.680 --> 39:40.040]  understood and I got my hand in every single cookie jar I could get it into and it aged
[39:40.040 --> 39:41.040]  me.
[39:41.040 --> 39:44.880]  You know I if I grow a beard I look like I'm 70 because it's so white.
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.480]  But what it did was it gave me an unbelievable amount of understanding of where we're at,
[39:50.480 --> 39:55.840]  what are we doing and the fact that for most people you're emotionally taking a beating
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.960]  more than anything and that what you have to be able to do is realize that you're valid,
[40:00.960 --> 40:05.520]  the genetics that you hold are valid, your choices are valid, it's just that you have
[40:05.520 --> 40:07.120]  to be timely.
[40:07.120 --> 40:09.680]  Where are you valid in the timeline?
[40:09.800 --> 40:17.360]  So for us it's to say what are we doing with our products, who am I selling it to, who's
[40:17.360 --> 40:22.600]  the people that process it, manufacture it and distribute it, what stores do they sell
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.280]  to, what's the expectation of the people at those stores so that you can make a market
[40:28.280 --> 40:34.280]  penetration so that you get some form of brand differentiation where people start to realize
[40:34.360 --> 40:40.760]  that you are on a shelf, that you're still there next year and what happens is you start
[40:40.760 --> 40:42.960]  to build a recognition.
[40:42.960 --> 40:46.920]  And for me the longevity component is the biggest one.
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.960]  Most people really don't understand that you need to be constantly present all the time
[40:51.960 --> 40:54.520]  or people forget who you are.
[40:54.520 --> 40:58.080]  And so you make a big splash and then you're out of the market for nine months and then
[40:58.080 --> 41:00.580]  you come back and you're gone.
[41:00.580 --> 41:04.660]  But if you can create a splash big enough to get an emotional buy-in and you can get
[41:04.660 --> 41:08.780]  people who want to give you emails and you have an ability to be able to highlight what
[41:08.780 --> 41:13.860]  you do through digital marketing which is cheap and you send them flyers and you send
[41:13.860 --> 41:18.460]  them pictures and you send them information and you let them know that your products are
[41:18.460 --> 41:23.660]  coming out and you let them know that it's limited batch and you know there's only 200
[41:23.660 --> 41:29.820]  pounds total available period and you let them know in advance people will come and
[41:29.820 --> 41:32.620]  buy that product and hold it.
[41:32.620 --> 41:36.860]  And you will be able to have an ability to get people who want to mess with you and in
[41:36.860 --> 41:41.260]  the process of messing with you it's the same thing I did with genetics where I moved as
[41:41.260 --> 41:44.100]  many plants for other people as I ever did for myself.
[41:44.100 --> 41:47.880]  I moved so many black market ops plants there was no word for it and I got no money off
[41:47.880 --> 41:48.880]  of it.
[41:48.880 --> 41:51.740]  And people say why do you help out so many people moving genetics and I said because
[41:51.740 --> 41:54.460]  ultimately everybody's coming to me for the information and if I can put you into the
[41:54.460 --> 41:56.740]  right direction you're still going to come to me.
[41:56.740 --> 42:01.300]  And when my day comes to sell you a product I'll sell you my product but I don't have
[42:01.300 --> 42:02.680]  that product today.
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.660]  So instead of telling you no I don't know where to go I would refer you and what that
[42:06.660 --> 42:10.980]  is is that's networking and what you're doing is you're becoming someone very powerful because
[42:10.980 --> 42:16.560]  you answer the problem of how do I get it and you're somebody that says you get it from
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.100]  him and instead of me getting in the middle of the deal to decrease the actual profit
[42:21.100 --> 42:25.300]  that that person makes you become a good middleman and step out of the deal.
[42:25.300 --> 42:30.180]  You become more of a connector and then what happens now is you start to get respect from
[42:30.180 --> 42:35.540]  the customer because they realize that what you're trying to do is satisfy a desire and
[42:35.540 --> 42:38.720]  that desire is success for all people.
[42:38.720 --> 42:42.340]  And when that becomes synonymous with who you are people will forgive you for your ups
[42:42.340 --> 42:45.500]  and downs and what happens everyone thinks you're going to be perfect in business and
[42:45.500 --> 42:49.260]  I'm like bro if you could hit a 92 man you're unreal.
[42:49.260 --> 42:54.180]  That means out of a thousand people you serve 920 of them correctly because 80 of them are
[42:54.180 --> 42:57.660]  going to be pissed 40 of them are going to hate you because they just hate in general
[42:57.660 --> 43:00.460]  and 40 of them because you made a mistake.
[43:00.460 --> 43:06.220]  But the 920 who you didn't have issues with are the ones who sustain your business and
[43:06.220 --> 43:10.080]  most people have never been in public business and they sure as hell haven't had to deal
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.620]  with public business with the internet and what takes place is you have to be able to
[43:14.620 --> 43:19.500]  make a connection and a penetration so that people just realize I do business with this
[43:19.500 --> 43:24.060]  person because they give me something that I need and when I wanted to find things that
[43:24.060 --> 43:29.020]  were comparable similar rare you become a network.
[43:29.020 --> 43:34.340]  Your digital marketing is more important than any of your other brand bullshit because and
[43:34.340 --> 43:38.900]  I don't mean on Instagram because people who are 50 to 70 don't look at it.
[43:38.900 --> 43:41.180]  People that have money don't look at it.
[43:41.180 --> 43:43.180]  They don't look at it to buy weed.
[43:43.180 --> 43:46.540]  They come into the store and they trust the person at the counter.
[43:46.540 --> 43:52.300]  Your ability to go and figure out my distributor sells to these seven stores you go drive to
[43:52.300 --> 43:57.460]  those seven stores yourself and you introduce yourself to these people and say I'm the farmer
[43:57.460 --> 43:59.220]  from this stuff.
[43:59.220 --> 44:02.080]  Here is something that I cultivate.
[44:02.080 --> 44:03.520]  You can give them a joint.
[44:03.520 --> 44:06.060]  You can you can hold up an ounce in your pocket.
[44:06.060 --> 44:10.140]  You make these connections so that people start to see you as a real person.
[44:10.140 --> 44:12.340]  They go wow that's really nice product.
[44:12.340 --> 44:13.940]  I'll remember that.
[44:13.940 --> 44:18.340]  And then when someone comes in and they refer it they're able to refer your products and
[44:18.340 --> 44:20.620]  then you and I have an identity.
[44:20.620 --> 44:25.020]  Anybody who's successful right now in the market is connected into a vertical chain
[44:25.020 --> 44:27.620]  and I study this and I'm like it's scary.
[44:27.620 --> 44:28.700]  It is scary.
[44:28.700 --> 44:32.940]  If you're the farmer you're the most vulnerable and you're relying on distributors to sell
[44:32.940 --> 44:36.660]  your pot and the problem is that they're not qualified because most of them were selling
[44:36.660 --> 44:40.420]  shoes two years ago and so now they're selling your stuff.
[44:40.420 --> 44:44.300]  So what you have to be able to do is be able to take the things that you have that are
[44:44.300 --> 44:45.940]  highly attractive.
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.500]  You meet these individuals.
[44:47.500 --> 44:52.220]  You showcase it and then you take a look and you're asking them what do your customers
[44:52.220 --> 44:56.540]  want here and they're going to tell you the customers here typically needed to be under
[44:56.540 --> 44:58.040]  this amount of money.
[44:58.040 --> 45:02.620]  So you need to go backwards and figure out what can I grow that will let me make margin
[45:02.620 --> 45:05.540]  on something that fits that.
[45:05.580 --> 45:10.180]  And then you're able to use your craft skills, your organic methodologies which are very
[45:10.180 --> 45:16.260]  efficient to deliver products that fit those ranges and that gets you penetration and once
[45:16.260 --> 45:20.780]  you have penetration you have recognition and with recognition comes acceptance and
[45:20.780 --> 45:25.720]  trust and now you can take them anywhere you want in your portfolio.
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.020]  But when you try to say this is what you should be doing they step back.
[45:30.020 --> 45:34.460]  And so this question is this thing today I thought about it I was like this has to be
[45:34.460 --> 45:38.460]  a marketing lecture and it has to really does because most people are getting their
[45:38.460 --> 45:42.580]  shit kicked out of them financially and I'm like wait a minute you all have incredible
[45:42.580 --> 45:45.740]  genomic forms you'll have collections you got buddies that have stuff.
[45:45.740 --> 45:46.740]  How you selling?
[45:46.740 --> 45:47.740]  Selling good?
[45:47.740 --> 45:48.740]  Going well?
[45:48.740 --> 45:51.980]  Because I'm not seeing a lot of happy smiles when I ask that question in general and it's
[45:51.980 --> 45:54.020]  really because of these issues.
[45:54.020 --> 46:00.460]  It's about trying to understand what's the material I have to grow to satisfy the sale
[46:00.660 --> 46:06.820]  and once I can do that now I have an ability to start releasing my material and start to
[46:06.820 --> 46:12.020]  build your unique brand and I hate to use the word brand because there really is no
[46:12.020 --> 46:13.860]  brands in cannabis.
[46:13.860 --> 46:15.860]  Nobody's big enough to satisfy brand.
[46:15.860 --> 46:21.780]  When you think of brand you're thinking Nike, you're thinking Pepsi, you're thinking Heineken,
[46:21.780 --> 46:26.220]  you know name anything that you know that's a brand you're none of those.
[46:27.220 --> 46:32.500]  What we need to do is create the brand of high quality sun-grown biologically based
[46:32.500 --> 46:39.420]  cultivation and under that brand we all fall underneath it and then what that does it allows
[46:39.420 --> 46:44.380]  you now to really cheapen up your marketing because all you have to do is be able to understand
[46:44.380 --> 46:47.140]  how do we work together to create an umbrella.
[46:47.140 --> 46:48.740]  We all get underneath it.
[46:48.740 --> 46:54.300]  We fill this pile with the stuff we have when it's correct and we identify the destination
[46:54.300 --> 46:59.540]  market once you identify the destination that's what you produce and even though you
[46:59.540 --> 47:04.100]  might love your varietal to death well you're allowed to grow six plants legally so I tell
[47:04.100 --> 47:08.140]  people all the time you want to get an emotional ride grow six and those are the ones you get
[47:08.140 --> 47:09.140]  to keep.
[47:09.140 --> 47:13.580]  I grow six and I turn four of them into RSO that I donate because unfortunately I know
[47:13.580 --> 47:17.340]  too many people from the med years that are dying of cancer and they can't get anything
[47:17.340 --> 47:20.820]  and so I only need two plants to satisfy a year's worth of smoke.
[47:20.820 --> 47:24.860]  I mean shit if it's a big enough plant I can't smoke the whole thing in a year so I
[47:24.860 --> 47:29.420]  choose things that I like and I choose things that I want to donate which lets me still
[47:29.420 --> 47:34.660]  participate in the culture that we came from which was collaborative community and it lets
[47:34.660 --> 47:39.640]  me still be able to feel like I'm a human being and then I put that emotional shit to
[47:39.640 --> 47:46.700]  bed and I go after the business like I'm doing business and I'm crystal clear about it and
[47:46.700 --> 47:50.980]  a lot of times it's offensive to people because when we have discussions I mean I'm brutal
[47:50.980 --> 47:57.500]  and I rip your plant apart because I make you substantiate your claim and it kills people
[47:57.500 --> 48:02.120]  because I watch them have emotional breakdowns in the conversation because their connection
[48:02.120 --> 48:06.220]  to what they produce is some form of their identity and we talked about that a little
[48:06.220 --> 48:11.500]  earlier it is not your identity you're your identity the product is something that you
[48:11.500 --> 48:17.380]  produce that reflects your desires it reflects your ethos it reflects your skills but it
[48:17.380 --> 48:21.820]  changes over the course of your career and so if you remember to hold the material that
[48:21.820 --> 48:26.500]  you've been holding for time do as much seed preservation as possible so this way you can
[48:26.500 --> 48:31.220]  keep these genetics because there's a lack of them globally you're not gonna mind this
[48:31.220 --> 48:34.860]  stuff I get hit up from countries all over the world that are asking me to provide them
[48:34.860 --> 48:41.220]  with genes and I'm like where's all your genes and I realize that they're gone because cocaine
[48:41.220 --> 48:47.580]  took out all the genes in South America and heroin opium production took out all the genes
[48:47.580 --> 48:53.740]  in Asia and so lo and behold you have radically shrunk gene populations to mine from you go
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.500]  into any part of Africa Civil War strife famine plague took out the cannabis and so all of
[48:59.500 --> 49:06.200]  a sudden cannabis is just like coral and so coral a friend of mine's a world-class coral
[49:06.240 --> 49:12.480]  collector and he said Kev he goes we hold more varietals in-house now than is available in the
[49:12.480 --> 49:18.840]  ocean because the oceans are acidified and all the corals dying and so people like him hold coral and
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.840]  then they sell it as frags and they ship it globally so that other coral collectors can
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.680]  access the material and I realized that only within the community of coralists do you have
[49:29.680 --> 49:33.800]  access to coral because you can no longer mine it from the ocean because it's no longer there
[49:33.920 --> 49:39.080]  so the material you're all holding is actually priceless because you really can't go find it
[49:39.080 --> 49:45.880]  anymore but what you need to do is is don't believe that it's been been minimized because
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.280]  that's the lesson for perp perp said hey your weed isn't worth anything anymore you need him
[49:51.280 --> 49:57.960]  sell perp and instead of people saying I got you let's let's make seed pops they threw everything
[49:57.960 --> 50:02.520]  away so they could go full perp and the problem was it screwed them down the road because they
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.560]  got rid of half of their easel they no longer have the paint needed to make new varieties they
[50:07.560 --> 50:13.480]  don't have an ability to stay current and when you start to use stuff that's trendy you bottleneck
[50:13.480 --> 50:18.920]  your genomic form and you make it susceptible to things you're not aware of and so by having a
[50:18.920 --> 50:24.320]  tissue culture facility and having lab access we find that some of these very popular varieties
[50:24.320 --> 50:29.520]  if I pull them from the general population sometimes up to 60% of the samples are carrying
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.160]  they're carrying a fungal problem some of them have viral issues so everyone using these bottleneck
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.800]  genetic forms are susceptible to major problems and so what takes place is you have to be able
[50:41.800 --> 50:46.840]  to say I got you I can't go chase trends that are bottleneck genes because if we have a pathogenic
[50:46.840 --> 50:52.320]  issue I'm screwed and so you have to have enough diversity and you have to be able to take this
[50:52.320 --> 50:57.000]  diversity and understand how do you diversify it into the markets and that's why we talked about
[50:57.120 --> 51:00.880]  the fuels the earth's the florals and the fruits because fundamentally that's how cannabis breaks
[51:00.880 --> 51:06.800]  up and scientifically it breaks up into these divisions based off of these terp relationships
[51:06.800 --> 51:12.480]  and once you can start to see this it starts to help you understand how to market your product
[51:12.480 --> 51:17.680]  it helps you understand who your target audience is it starts to let you know that when you look
[51:17.680 --> 51:24.400]  at the database you can figure out what's working I love to use the the digital galaxy from phylos
[51:24.400 --> 51:30.440]  because it lets me take a look at relationships between plants it lets me understand am I working
[51:30.440 --> 51:35.040]  with something that's unique or am I working with something that's not unique and what's the level
[51:35.040 --> 51:40.400]  of homozygosity heterozygosity so if I breed it am I gonna get an incredible spread of genes or am I
[51:40.400 --> 51:45.120]  gonna get a narrow spread of genes so it's information that you can use to help steer
[51:45.120 --> 51:51.200]  your directions and as we go forward there'll be individuals that do incredible work that produce
[51:51.320 --> 51:55.320]  varietals at the market wants and you're gonna and we learned yesterday all the different licensing
[51:55.320 --> 52:01.080]  agreements you'll be able to license material from other people to produce product on your farm using
[52:01.080 --> 52:06.960]  your methodologies so that what you have is sellability and then at some point in time when
[52:06.960 --> 52:12.320]  you get enough brand recognition you can release new things you're allowed then to say look I can
[52:12.320 --> 52:19.080]  do other stuff adidas always had three stripes but lo and behold once they got market penetration
[52:19.080 --> 52:23.640]  they could change some of those things and they had other things that they could sell and so I
[52:23.640 --> 52:29.560]  always look at what people buy and what they do and I try to overlay that over the reality of what
[52:29.560 --> 52:37.800]  we do and because my desire is to always be able to preserve protect and move the genomic form
[52:37.800 --> 52:43.960]  forward through time I know that to hold is priceless and to share is priceless and to be
[52:43.960 --> 52:50.120]  able to understand how do you take this material that you have identify where it's going identify
[52:50.120 --> 52:55.480]  where the supply chain problems are how do you get around those issues by choosing genetically
[52:55.480 --> 53:00.840]  what you need and so it's just really a series of checks on a box that you just start checking
[53:00.840 --> 53:08.560]  through and say the pot that I sell has a lag time in processing don't make it in any way high
[53:08.560 --> 53:13.960]  monoterpene if it's extremely aromatic be very careful because by the time the user gets it it's
[53:13.960 --> 53:20.640]  done and when they burn it satisfaction is gone if it has a rough handling where the people that
[53:20.640 --> 53:30.000]  do this mechanized work if it is in any way open it will shred in process and by the time the person
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.100]  gets it it's in pieces so what you sold them was a bag of crumble and it wasn't crumble when you
[53:36.220 --> 53:42.580]  leave your building but it's crumble when I get it at a store and so you these decisions have to
[53:42.580 --> 53:51.140]  be made and you have to just basically disconnect your emotional shit you have to be a robot when
[53:51.140 --> 53:57.420]  it comes to making business decisions and then you able the opposite of a robot in order to hold
[53:57.420 --> 54:02.300]  the culture and so it's very difficult because there's almost no industry like cannabis where
[54:02.300 --> 54:07.100]  all of us had to pay such a heavy toll the whole time to participate so your connection to what you
[54:07.100 --> 54:11.740]  do your connection to your plants it's your identity but the truth of it all is it's not
[54:11.740 --> 54:18.780]  these are things that are part of you but not all of you and so I'm not gonna go on forever on this
[54:18.780 --> 54:22.580]  because the the the point is I want to get all these breeders that come up here and start to
[54:22.580 --> 54:27.420]  work and talk but I wanted to cover some very specific things of understand that cannabis
[54:27.420 --> 54:33.180]  breaks up into major categories that's scientifically accurate that's important because the public loves
[54:33.180 --> 54:37.900]  people with titles behind their names telling you them things so they don't listen to you but if you
[54:37.900 --> 54:43.500]  put the word PhD in front of your name they will and what you need to do is have science quantify
[54:43.500 --> 54:48.700]  the things that you do so that when you put it on the table and it gets challenged there's a proof
[54:48.700 --> 54:54.180]  and now it's not an opinion and now what it does it allows you to be able to not have to have such
[54:54.180 --> 54:58.900]  an intimate argument with individuals because if you argue with them you lose the sale you want to
[54:58.900 --> 55:03.740]  be able to make sure that you're measuring your supply lines who's moving your product where do
[55:03.740 --> 55:08.620]  they sell it how do they process it most people don't have a vertical chain it's too expensive
[55:08.620 --> 55:14.020]  it's very expensive to have all these things in hand and if you're a distributor and a farmer on
[55:14.020 --> 55:20.140]  a micro license who's grew who's growing the weed and doing the work when you're selling it and so
[55:20.140 --> 55:24.500]  a lot of it is you start having the ability to do it but unfortunately you don't have the time
[55:24.500 --> 55:30.820]  or the resources to do it correctly and then what stores are going to take you on when you're not
[55:30.820 --> 55:37.460]  able to provide to them product on a consistent level all the time you're basically a flash so
[55:37.460 --> 55:43.900]  what you're having to do is you're having to find specific operations that specialize in niche pot
[55:44.020 --> 55:50.780]  what's a good example of people's people's dispensary right a beautiful beautiful facility
[55:50.780 --> 55:56.380]  but they look for really high quality product because the the buyer is discerning and he
[55:56.380 --> 56:01.060]  understands that the customer wants a better product and so he sources out product from
[56:01.060 --> 56:07.420]  smaller entities over larger entities because he understands this how many people are at that
[56:07.420 --> 56:12.500]  education level not that many and so you have to go find dispensaries where the people who are
[56:12.500 --> 56:18.740]  running them are intelligent and they understand the reality of customer satisfaction and they
[56:18.740 --> 56:23.300]  understand that the only way to get really high quality product is from craft manufacturers
[56:23.300 --> 56:30.540]  because the details are all checked and if they can figure out that they want to deal with you
[56:30.540 --> 56:36.460]  and they want your product they can find the distributor who will make that happen and so
[56:36.460 --> 56:41.060]  the farmer in the store need to make the relationship everything else in the middle
[56:41.060 --> 56:46.500]  can be worked out but if the store doesn't want you people think that you're pushing product what
[56:46.500 --> 56:51.980]  you want is it to be pulled you want your product pulled out of your hands so that all you do is
[56:51.980 --> 56:58.780]  produce it and then people desire it and that has to be through relationships and it has to be through
[56:58.780 --> 57:05.020]  given individuals varieties that are easy to sell and it has to be able to understand what the margin
[57:05.020 --> 57:11.460]  has to be and if you can't produce that cultivar that you have and get paid for it put it back in
[57:11.460 --> 57:18.020]  the library and then sell the things that have an ability to be sold and when you eventually get the
[57:18.020 --> 57:22.300]  market penetration you want which should happen over the next couple years and that's not really
[57:22.300 --> 57:27.620]  that long a time it's a lifetime when you pour and it's just like oxygen three minutes with no air is
[57:27.620 --> 57:35.060]  a long time and so in in life it's whatever you have least supply of that's most important and when
[57:35.060 --> 57:39.340]  people challenge me on that I tell them hold your breath and they start choking and I'm like BAM you
[57:39.340 --> 57:43.340]  were least supply of air so while you were struggling to breathe you thought of nothing
[57:43.340 --> 57:47.740]  else so whatever's in least supply is most important for us the thing that's gonna be in
[57:47.740 --> 57:52.660]  least supply is liquidity and finances and what we need to be able to do is just survive these
[57:52.660 --> 57:59.460]  transitions until you firmly establish this new industry they will go after the store situation
[57:59.460 --> 58:04.700]  they will open up these opportunities because they're there's 700 million short in California
[58:04.700 --> 58:09.980]  on expected tax revenue in order to get the tax revenue they can't tax more they have to open up
[58:09.980 --> 58:17.060]  more sales so the only way that's going to happen is through the the relaxing of the laws and the
[58:17.060 --> 58:21.540]  development of an industry that means that in a couple years all of us have an opportunity to
[58:21.540 --> 58:27.700]  really participate in the craft industry but right now it's about survival and so like I tell people
[58:27.700 --> 58:31.580]  someone said you know what are you gonna do I was something same thing I'm going crude this year I'm
[58:31.580 --> 58:37.580]  gonna blow the farm crude so that I can blow it and walk away with the paycheck so that I can afford
[58:37.580 --> 58:44.220]  to pay to keep the farm alive and what I do with my farm is I can hold all my genomic forms at your
[58:44.220 --> 58:48.740]  farm because you have an ability to hold your material in-house you're not you're not set up
[58:48.740 --> 58:53.140]  for six if you have a license you can have as much as you want within that specific square footage
[58:53.140 --> 59:00.540]  of what you do and you hold the material and you start to create the story around the material and
[59:00.540 --> 59:06.500]  you do it digitally because that's the cheapest way to market and you start to be able to meet
[59:06.500 --> 59:11.380]  these people at these dispensaries and while they're there you pop it up on the phone and you
[59:11.380 --> 59:16.740]  show them some cool stuff and you start to link to other farms and you start to link to other
[59:16.820 --> 59:21.860]  varietals and pretty soon what you're doing is you're creating an information network of what's
[59:21.860 --> 59:27.060]  available or otherwise I get it from a distributor and it's a skew and we go through it and say all
[59:27.060 --> 59:33.460]  right this stuff is that's the right one that's at the right price for my market because my customers
[59:33.460 --> 59:40.700]  can only spend so much money so I can't give you a $90 bag but if I'm in Hollywood I can and so if
[59:40.700 --> 59:45.140]  you can make a penetration into one of those places then you can move some of these extremely
[59:45.140 --> 59:54.500]  less efficient cultivars that don't give you the same amount of yield but what they do is they give
[59:54.500 --> 01:00:00.020]  you differentiation but if you try to put that into a market where people want to pay 45 bucks you
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:07.260]  screwed and you have to clearly see it and so the the world we're in now is really to me a survival
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:12.620]  world and it's about making sure that you keep your neighbors alive it's making sure that when
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.780]  you get varietals like Josh bread that's nasty you realize that you and your neighbor could both
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.140]  produce it maybe your whole hill could produce it because what it'll do is it allow there be
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:27.420]  enough of it to satisfy the customer for a whole year and then the customer comes back to go work
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:33.140]  with your group because that's how it works with all products that's how normal things are marketed
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.900]  that's how normal things are consumed and that's what has to take place and that's why I said I
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:42.580]  brought those plants in because I said oh my god this stuff is killer and I wanted to hoard it and
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:48.700]  so as soon as I want to hoard something I know that's what I need to release because that has
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:01:02.160]  the value and if you just instantly want to release it so so so that's really the lesson on it it's
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.480]  it's just trying to be very honest with what you're doing determine the destination do your
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.560]  numbers if you're not really good at the business end of it have someone do an assessment of your
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.880]  efficiency so you can figure out does it make sense for me to grow this and does it make sense
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:26.240]  for me to work with it I and I tell people a lot of it too is that if your desire is to everyone's
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.400]  like I'm gonna take the top 20% of my plants and I'm gonna turn it into flour and the rest of it's
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:35.280]  gonna be concentrate well if that stuff isn't over 22% it's tough to get it into an extractor
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.240]  because they have to make money too so if they can't get a return they don't touch it if the
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.160]  turps aren't high we're not stripping it so I have a terp stripping facility where all it does is strip
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.040]  turps and then dry the material convert it to blow it into biomass so it's pre converted before we
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.200]  have to turn it into distillate because these high-end cartridges are only from cannabis derived
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:00.080]  terpenes what that means is that if you have varieties that have an incredible turf profile
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:06.040]  and a quantity of it that makes sense you can grow that just for that and you have an ability
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.760]  to diversify what you're growing to fit certain markets so there's things that I started mining
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.240]  that release an incredible terpene signature with a high biomass load early so that you can get your
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.680]  crop out by mid-august harvest the numbers that you need which is the the oil the scent and combine
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.920]  it but it has to work if it's low numbers extractors won't touch it so you're gonna give
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.120]  them 20% to the customers flour and the other 80% is gonna sit still because nobody wants to work
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:43.200]  with it and then you get caught up in what people like and you're like no solventless is best in in
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.040]  Vancouver Canada it is but try selling that shit in California don't want it they wanted it such a
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.480]  small rate of speed that the best hash makers I know don't sell it quickly at all people want
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.320]  convenience California market is convenience its simplicity its pens it's the masses want this so
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.400]  you have to say I got you the variety that I'm gonna grow not only does it do what I want and
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:14.440]  it's quality in the smoke but the numbers are over 22 and 3 5 on the turps otherwise I can't blow it
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:20.120]  and sell it now I have to sell the whole plant is flower and so now what you're doing is you're
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.920]  having to degrade the quality of your flower to be in the mid market but the problem is that still
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.960]  your label still your brand it's all tied in you'd have to create two companies one to sell your high
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.760]  end flower and then another name to sell your lower end flower because it's visually lower in
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:42.840]  quality and that's complicated and so I tell people I said listen I said I'm telling you you
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:48.440]  have to go after this reality and understand it well the beating you're gonna take is gonna be so
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.880]  aggressive you're gonna have to capitulate and the question here is on on our regions and our values
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:01.280]  is that someone told me there's no 25 years ago I hung out with an economist who was a from a long
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.320]  history of farming so his family were very successful farmers in the Central Valley but he
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.680]  became an economist because he said I hate farming but what he was was a brilliant economist and he
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:18.320]  and I had this this was a man this would have been 95 so in 95 I'm having discussions on the fall of
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.760]  Humboldt County to Salinas and Monterey and Santa Barbara because he said the cut flower industry
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:31.680]  disappeared due to NAFTA and so a free trade agreement made it cheaper to ship flowers from
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:38.600]  Columbia to the East Coast then from California to the East Coast and overnight an entire cut
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.400]  flower industry disappeared he said that's what's gonna happen to you you guys are gonna get wiped
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.680]  out and you're gonna get destroyed and I said to him I said well as an economist I said wouldn't
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.200]  my route through that to be unique product differentiation and then micro craft and he
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.760]  said yeah that's the only way out he said your regions have global recognition what you have
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:06.240]  to be able to do is survive the transition and the region itself will have the brand value and
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.520]  so everyone's arguing that I should have went and picked up operations in Central California but I
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.040]  said I hate Central California I love Northern California so why would I want to be down there
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.880]  I want to be where I want to be and I believe that the value here will hold and then I'm talking
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.720]  to someone who does the buys for a major Canadian LP and they just picked up a million square foot
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:33.680]  of humble canopy so that it allows them to have a craft division in their portfolio that's not bad
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.280]  because when you have people that are developing craft businesses in your region what do they do
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.240]  they advertise the reason why it's craft is because it's coming out of your region and so
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:51.840]  you get to do something called piggyback and you get to go ride that forward and that's why I think
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.120]  that if we can just survive this next couple of years and we make clear decisions on what we're
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.040]  doing and if you want people to really love what you're growing then you need to use your skills
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:09.000]  as a farmer and produce a product that they want and then over time you can give them the product
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.600]  that you'd like to give them which then lets you feel happy about what you're doing because you may
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:20.440]  not like smoking Gorilla Glue or Blue Dream but the bottom line is the extractor sure do they love
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.840]  those products because they're hot numbers high yield easy to grow and it allows you to catch
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:32.040]  holes in a market that are here right now and that's really turning your ego down and just
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:37.560]  saying look I'm here to do business if I want to experience my culture in the way I knew it I grow
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.200]  plants we smoke and share and enjoy and I have shit that nobody wants to buy but I'm enjoying it
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:50.280]  and then the business of farming is farming and if you really need to understand the reality just go
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.720]  look at agricultural pay scales and you're gonna find out that farmers get screwed globally and
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.880]  when you put that I never tell anybody I'm a farmer I said because I would imply that I'm
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.960]  broke and what that does is it absolutely change even when I'm struggling I don't tell you I'm
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.520]  struggling because people love to see people hurt because it allows them to feel like they're in
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.520]  power so when I play business games I always tell people I don't know what I'm doing and I watch
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:23.080]  your response and when I see your eyes blinking I know that you're trying to fuck me and so now I
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:29.560]  know I play the game with you because I want to be able to feel out the reality I want to be able
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:35.720]  to understand the deal that I'm doing and it's that understanding of what's taking place and so
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.200]  the perception that we have to have is that we're being looked at like we're failures that somehow
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:47.440]  we screwed up so bad that we're desperate and that we don't produce good pot and that the big
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:53.160]  companies do it correctly because that's the imagery that's being painted and so I always talk
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.920]  about yeah it's a struggle but the bottom line is all businesses struggle and what it does it allows
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.320]  people to see a normality and then we can also say but we were able to be successful for decades
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.960]  prior so we have a history of longevity and now we're having to work with the transition so that
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.560]  we can move forward and then the customer doesn't see you as a victim as soon as you start begging
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:22.160]  for anything you're screwed you're screwed never beg when I got in trouble in 2002 I had to write a
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.080]  letter of contrition because I caught a felony right and I had to write a letter of contrition
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.280]  so I wrote this letter and my lawyer and my friend said are you out of your mind and I said
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.920]  no no this is what I'm giving to him and it said the only thing I did wrong was I moved too fast
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:42.320]  for the rest of you Kevin Jodry and I got the max penalty because I knew I was going to get it
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.080]  anyways so I knew they were gonna screw me anyways and I said you might as well take it on your feet
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:54.360]  than on your knees because at least at least you're holding yourself to a standard and that's
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:01.720]  the truth here is that every time you capitulate bend beg pray the public sees you as a victim and
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.800]  then they want to beat you down in price when you go to the store and you play this game they want
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:11.560]  to beat you down in price because that's business and what you have to be able to do is give them
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:18.120]  things that they want so that the negotiations affair get you on a shelf get you into the public
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.560]  eye get you an opportunity to make connections you take those connections and you network them
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.720]  like you have your whole lives because everybody here had to sell their own weed so you all know
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.960]  how to do business you all know how to produce a product that the public wanted so what you want
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:37.040]  to do now is just be able to kind of readjust that shift and use the genetic tools that are
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.600]  available to you because there's a lot of material available to be able to put yourself in situations
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.720]  where you can succeed and I think that's enough of the conversation so the main point is you guys
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.600]  don't bow down don't get off get off your knees only one time you should be on your knees is if
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.400]  you're looking for your car keys because you dropped them out of your pocket and other than
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.840]  that and maybe and maybe as we stand under the cross here as it falls in Chris crucifies me from
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:12.560]  being shitty is is in is in humility but not in begging for mercy from the market because no one
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.880]  gives a shit about your struggle and the people that you're selling cannabis to are going through
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.960]  the same beating you are but they've been going through it for a long time because they've been
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.920]  diminished in their wages and so most people are taking a brutal beating and you don't get sympathy
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.600]  from people who are also in the same circumstance what you want to be able to do is give them some
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:39.680]  form of escapism some form of satisfaction some form of genuine quality and those are the things
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.360]  that transcend and once you have that you're going to able to have a penetration that'll happen that
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.960]  allow you to move your products and then start to rebring in your genetic libraries that you've
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:56.160]  held and built and nurtured and now you start to have an ability to where your farm only produces
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:03.240]  one thing the thing that you know produces best on your farm and there's there's there's 1700 people
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:09.000]  who buy the entire farms worth the product and then you're done for the season but when you
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:15.400]  release you re-release the information and you can set up the desire the stores that want to carry
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:22.200]  it the prices will be there it's it's a reality if you look at every other market and so for me
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:27.840]  I'm somebody who was career hustler who said wow I'm gonna get buried alive let me study let me
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.440]  learn let me share and together we're gonna do it so let's go
