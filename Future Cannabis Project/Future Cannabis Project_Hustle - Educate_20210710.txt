[00:00.570 --> 00:02.570]  And we are live.
[00:05.530 --> 00:12.810]  Welcome everyone, welcome to the first Hustle and Educate in Oklahoma. We're super excited to be here today.
[00:13.850 --> 00:18.930]  I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore at this point. Heck, I just keep on talking.
[00:19.050 --> 00:25.430]  So I'm super excited really that we actually have so many people that are interested in education.
[00:25.630 --> 00:31.630]  And so many people actually interested in growing correctly. Get back to the natural basics.
[00:31.910 --> 00:35.190]  So with all of that being said, I've talked a lot already.
[00:36.270 --> 00:38.870]  I'm actually the managing partner of Abco.
[00:38.870 --> 00:43.230]  And this is not our event center, but we made it ours today.
[00:43.230 --> 00:48.510]  So let's enjoy it and everyone please medicate, enjoy. We're going to talk to you
[00:49.270 --> 00:53.390]  around the room and we're going to actually talk to the different vendors that are here.
[00:53.910 --> 00:58.550]  Educate you about their products and I will tell you that every product that is in here
[00:59.070 --> 01:02.630]  may not be in Abco today, but it will be.
[01:04.910 --> 01:11.190]  And actually soil, just so that you know, we actually have soil for sale and I believe we've worked that out and it's ready to go.
[01:11.590 --> 01:15.190]  So anyone wanting soil, you can purchase that down at Abco.
[01:15.190 --> 01:21.590]  And that's already in the system. We're also working on some of the Terry's products that will be in there today as well.
[01:21.590 --> 01:24.670]  So they will be ready to go. Just give us some time to get it in.
[01:25.030 --> 01:30.230]  And I'm going to hand the microphone off to Brian and let's just have a great day.
[01:37.350 --> 01:39.670]  All right, so just quickly living soil nerds.
[01:39.670 --> 01:43.990]  This is something that we really wanted to think about. James is going to come up here in a second.
[01:43.990 --> 01:46.950]  He's one of the main reasons as well as Deidre with Abco Med.
[01:47.270 --> 01:51.470]  The main reason that we have this is because we want to bring education to Oklahoma.
[01:51.750 --> 01:56.910]  There's a lot of us out here that want to see just improvement in the overall community as well.
[01:56.910 --> 02:00.230]  So this is what we put together. And as things continue to progress,
[02:00.230 --> 02:04.550]  I know that we're going to move into other states and that kind of stuff.
[02:04.550 --> 02:07.830]  So I'm not sure if we're going to continue to call it hustle and educate.
[02:07.830 --> 02:13.550]  This was kind of a nod to, you know, the old school way of thinking, some of the street life, some of that stuff.
[02:13.990 --> 02:16.510]  That's obviously hustle and motivate.
[02:16.510 --> 02:21.390]  That's something that I personally listen to usually every morning because it's something that, you know,
[02:21.390 --> 02:23.550]  I have two children and that's really what it's about.
[02:23.550 --> 02:28.990]  So now getting to that next level, I want to be able to hustle with you guys as well as educate you guys.
[02:28.990 --> 02:30.430]  And that's what this has come about.
[02:30.430 --> 02:33.710]  So James, do you want to come up here and kind of talk about you
[02:34.110 --> 02:36.790]  and what you guys are representing in Dunk Lane in Oklahoma?
[02:37.790 --> 02:43.790]  Thanks everybody for coming.
[02:43.790 --> 02:47.790]  I'm James from Red Dirt Rays, we're in Duncan.
[02:47.790 --> 02:50.790]  You guys have got some great speakers here today.
[02:50.790 --> 02:53.390]  I want to thank all of you for coming.
[02:53.390 --> 02:59.390]  Brandon, Terry, Marco, Brian for putting this thing on.
[02:59.390 --> 03:06.390]  I share a passion with all these guys for cannabis and for education.
[03:06.390 --> 03:12.390]  And they've all motivated and influenced what we're doing at our farm.
[03:12.390 --> 03:15.390]  And we just want to share that with you guys.
[03:15.390 --> 03:17.390]  So thank you for coming.
[03:26.500 --> 03:28.500]  We've got Dan Kakers coming up next.
[03:32.900 --> 03:34.900]  Hi everybody, we're Dan Kakers.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.900]  We're based in Bixby, Oklahoma.
[03:36.900 --> 03:38.900]  Indoor living soil.
[03:38.900 --> 03:41.900]  Future cannabis project educated.
[03:41.900 --> 03:43.900]  Yes, thank you Peter.
[03:43.900 --> 03:49.900]  I want to give a shout out to Peter's daughters too, because they really kept me going.
[03:49.900 --> 03:53.900]  We've got a seven year old at home, so through COVID it was tough.
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.900]  Yeah, all living soil, organic, no-till.
[03:58.900 --> 04:02.900]  Just try to keep up with everybody else basically.
[04:02.900 --> 04:06.900]  I mean, just last week's show, now we're doing a show.
[04:06.900 --> 04:10.900]  I mean, just last week's show, now we're doing Try Not Bottomless Pots.
[04:10.900 --> 04:13.900]  So if you guys have been following, you saw that.
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.900]  Shout out to Cantwell.
[04:15.900 --> 04:24.900]  But yeah, I'm just super glad to be able to give back to the platform that's given so much to us.
[04:24.900 --> 04:27.900]  That's given us a lot of our education.
[04:27.900 --> 04:29.900]  So, happy to be here.
[04:29.900 --> 04:31.900]  Yes, thank you for doing it Peter.
[04:37.900 --> 04:40.900]  Next up is CB DJ.
[04:40.900 --> 04:43.900]  We're excited to have him this evening as well as Mark.
[04:43.900 --> 04:45.900]  He's one of our DJs this evening.
[04:45.900 --> 04:49.900]  He was also helping us when we were in the crowd.
[04:49.900 --> 04:51.900]  I wonder how he's doing.
[04:51.900 --> 04:53.900]  Well, hello again.
[04:53.900 --> 04:55.900]  How's it going guys?
[04:55.900 --> 04:58.900]  I'd like to thank you guys all for coming out here.
[04:58.900 --> 05:00.900]  I am your DJ.
[05:00.900 --> 05:03.900]  And well, we've got a couple other names.
[05:03.900 --> 05:06.900]  And like I said earlier today, this is the first one.
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.900]  I'd like to thank you guys for all coming out here.
[05:08.900 --> 05:10.900]  I get to do this all the time.
[05:10.900 --> 05:15.900]  I have an awesome job as being a DJ, so I get to party all the time.
[05:15.900 --> 05:26.900]  But I also get to go around and educate people and teach them about cannabis and show them the proper ways of just being with it.
[05:26.900 --> 05:28.900]  Because it's not just those guys.
[05:28.900 --> 05:33.900]  When I talk with trimmers and people like that, the plant is medicine.
[05:33.900 --> 05:37.900]  So from start to finish, it's got to be surrounded with love.
[05:37.900 --> 05:42.900]  Everyone out here today, we're all here for education because we love it.
[05:42.900 --> 05:51.900]  I mean, at the end of the day, to come out and discover something, you have to love it to begin with, to further educate yourself.
[05:51.900 --> 05:57.900]  And the thing about medicine is it's something that you – it's not just something you take.
[05:57.900 --> 06:01.900]  It's something you live. It's something you surround yourself with, all of it.
[06:01.900 --> 06:06.900]  And like I was saying earlier, when I first got into this, I just knew about the cannabinoids.
[06:06.900 --> 06:14.900]  I mean, I knew it. I had an injury myself, and I was given the opiates and the things like that, and it was making things worse.
[06:14.900 --> 06:25.900]  And then I started getting closer to trying to discover what was going on, like the whole physiology of what happens between the plant and the relationship between you and that.
[06:25.900 --> 06:31.900]  And the cannabinoids are inside of your body, the endocannabinoid system.
[06:31.900 --> 06:33.900]  You have that system.
[06:33.900 --> 06:38.900]  And now that I'm not – I know I told you guys this once in the earlier times, but you guys at home need to know about that
[06:38.900 --> 06:45.900]  because something about this medicine is everything else you get from the doctors, you do not have a system for.
[06:45.900 --> 06:47.900]  It does not exist in your body.
[06:47.900 --> 06:51.900]  Some of it harms your system, especially if it's chemicals.
[06:51.900 --> 06:59.900]  So when you take the cannabinoids, which are phytocannabinoids, out of the plant and you put them into your endocannabinoid system,
[06:59.900 --> 07:01.900]  well, it's kind of like giving your body a tuna.
[07:01.900 --> 07:06.900]  So after about 30 days or so of not doing any cannabinoids, it starts to break down.
[07:06.900 --> 07:12.900]  So if you're, let's say, 30 years old, 40 years old, and you've never done cannabinoids at all, it's pretty much dead.
[07:12.900 --> 07:17.900]  But lucky thing for all of us, CBD brings it back to life.
[07:17.900 --> 07:22.900]  After a month of taking just a gram every single day, or whatever you want to use,
[07:22.900 --> 07:27.900]  it has to have a gram of full spectrum, something you start bringing it back to life.
[07:27.900 --> 07:32.900]  They used to tell us that nothing would regrow brain stuff and organs.
[07:32.900 --> 07:33.900]  They were lying to us.
[07:33.900 --> 07:34.900]  It's CBD.
[07:34.900 --> 07:40.900]  And then it does also, it regrows brain matter from narcotics and the poison that they gave you and all those things.
[07:40.900 --> 07:46.900]  So once I started realizing that and I quit going to the doctor and started eating right and taking medicine,
[07:46.900 --> 07:48.900]  and Barb, can I have that coffee really quick?
[07:48.900 --> 07:54.900]  And now it's just so much that I've made my own medicine and coffee for it.
[07:54.900 --> 07:58.900]  See, every single person in the world, this is Delta 8, and this is very important
[07:58.900 --> 08:01.900]  because they're starting to take this away from us all over the place.
[08:01.900 --> 08:08.900]  And Delta 8 is a very, very, very amazing cannabinoid because it's almost like Tetris.
[08:08.900 --> 08:14.900]  Like when people get really, really high, and they're on the Delta 9 and now Delta 10,
[08:14.900 --> 08:19.900]  and they kind of get your eyes and it consumes all your mental and stuff.
[08:19.900 --> 08:22.900]  Well, Delta 8 does not do that.
[08:22.900 --> 08:27.900]  It's more of a structured one that lands on the cannabinoids more as a scrubbing instead of like a sponge.
[08:27.900 --> 08:36.900]  So the patients get more of an uplifting effect, more euphoric effect and focus,
[08:36.900 --> 08:42.900]  with the rest of it working on the CD2 receptors, you know, the relaxation, the inflammation,
[08:42.900 --> 08:45.900]  all the things that patients go and seek out.
[08:45.900 --> 08:49.900]  That's why they're taking it away from you because if you have this, you don't need chemicals.
[08:49.900 --> 08:57.900]  So the bottom line is once I started learning about how older people are scared of the plant, you know,
[08:57.900 --> 09:03.900]  so I knew that if I did something with coffee and things and used this one because it's known as the more milder THC,
[09:03.900 --> 09:08.900]  I knew that I could start getting more patients to open up to doing this, you know.
[09:09.900 --> 09:15.900]  And like the biggest thing that I like about this, I was telling you guys earlier, that was my focus,
[09:15.900 --> 09:18.900]  was creating a great medicine, something I could get everywhere.
[09:18.900 --> 09:21.900]  Delta 8, you can order this to your front door.
[09:21.900 --> 09:24.900]  So this is like the loot roll to saving people's lives.
[09:24.900 --> 09:30.900]  But then when I did my first farmer's market, I met Bart in Payonee Soil,
[09:30.900 --> 09:35.900]  and I was just telling him, man, I thought I was dialed in and did mostly everything.
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.900]  And then I don't know why I didn't put it together.
[09:38.900 --> 09:44.900]  But that day I mentioned I was like everything that I find in the plants that I think is so freaking important
[09:44.900 --> 09:50.900]  had to start somewhere. And that's in the soil and the farmers and what they did with it and the love and the care.
[09:50.900 --> 09:54.900]  And that right there is what ended up in the medicine.
[09:54.900 --> 10:00.900]  So, you know, when you think about the patient side consuming it, that's all over the place.
[10:01.900 --> 10:05.900]  I mean, how many freaking reviews do you see on YouTube of people just smoking weed and coughing?
[10:05.900 --> 10:09.900]  What the hell? Does it taste good? I mean, did it do something for you?
[10:09.900 --> 10:13.900]  What the hell is this even about? Like that's what is flooding the market.
[10:13.900 --> 10:18.900]  And the reason that's flooding the market is just to make everyone out there think we're stupid.
[10:18.900 --> 10:26.900]  You know, the bottom line is those flavors that you taste are also creating a special effect.
[10:26.900 --> 10:28.900]  Do you know which effects those things are doing?
[10:28.900 --> 10:33.900]  Do you know if it's more fruity, it's probably an indica. If it's more citrus, it's probably a sativa.
[10:33.900 --> 10:37.900]  Do you know things like that? Because those are things that you need to know right off the bat,
[10:37.900 --> 10:39.900]  especially if you're talking to a patient.
[10:39.900 --> 10:43.900]  So the biggest thing I want to stress to everyone is I do this all the time.
[10:43.900 --> 10:47.900]  When you guys leave here, you're all going to think I wish I would have got that person's number.
[10:47.900 --> 10:51.900]  I wish I would have taken a picture. But today is important. This is day one.
[10:51.900 --> 10:56.900]  We're all in here. We all have time to meet with each other, have time to try each other's medicines,
[10:56.900 --> 11:01.900]  kick and tell stories, grow in stories. That's what today is about, is teaching each other,
[11:01.900 --> 11:06.900]  is educating each other, because we can go out there and smoke a weed every single day.
[11:06.900 --> 11:10.900]  How many days you guys got to sit around and talk to each other about farming stories
[11:10.900 --> 11:14.900]  and about things like that? Because this is how we get smarter, get better,
[11:14.900 --> 11:17.900]  and ultimately take care of our patients better.
[11:17.900 --> 11:20.900]  So anyways, I am the CBDJ. I love seeing you guys all here.
[11:20.900 --> 11:27.900]  Next time you guys are here online, you guys need to be out here and join this marijuana movement
[11:27.900 --> 11:30.900]  that we have going on in Smoke, Oklahoma, baby.
[11:30.900 --> 11:33.900]  And I'll be DJing here later on tonight. I hope I'll see you guys there too.
[11:33.900 --> 11:38.900]  We'll be back there doing dabs with the Boil-Tac Hoods. I'll see you guys later.
[11:38.900 --> 11:41.900]  That's right.
[11:41.900 --> 11:56.880]  Hi, my name is Ethan Miller. I do product development for Scent Cannabis
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.880]  along with Honey Creek Farms and RPS2 Tulsa.
[12:01.880 --> 12:05.880]  We're the guys who did cannabis and mushroom-infused yummies.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.880]  These are the guys who are eating today. Thank you. Appreciate the support.
[12:10.880 --> 12:15.880]  And I'm a patient. I've been in Oklahoma born and raised.
[12:15.880 --> 12:19.880]  I was introduced to cannabis when I was 15 years old, fell for it really hard,
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.880]  and became an advocate. I was going to sell weed legally in Oklahoma.
[12:24.880 --> 12:29.880]  That was my dream. And here I am looking at you guys talking about cannabis and mushrooms.
[12:29.880 --> 12:32.880]  So it's near and dear to my heart.
[12:32.880 --> 12:36.880]  This state's had a lot of issues with other compounds,
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.880]  and I'm seeing this transition over the past three years to cannabis.
[12:40.880 --> 12:43.880]  And not just a transition, but people are stoked about it.
[12:43.880 --> 12:46.880]  Our economy's coming back, and new buildings are on the streets,
[12:46.880 --> 12:51.880]  and people have a chance to do their dream like what I'm doing right now.
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.880]  So to me, this is a trip, to be honest.
[12:55.880 --> 13:02.880]  I'm on Future Cannabis Project. I literally watched Future 4200.
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.880]  I saved the video. It's on my phone from three years ago,
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.880]  and it's what got me into teaching.
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.880]  Future talks about open-source ecology, open-source information.
[13:12.880 --> 13:18.880]  I got super excited about it, and now I talk in front of people when they let me.
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.880]  I'm also VP of the Oklahoma Mycological Society, OK Fungi.
[13:23.880 --> 13:27.880]  We teach and talk all things fungi. Thank you.
[13:27.880 --> 13:30.880]  You got the back, future member.
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.880]  Yeah, so I've got dreads. I'm the real deal, guys.
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.880]  Thank you, thank you.
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.880]  Yeah, so Ascent Cannabis, real quick, we were super excited to sponsor the event.
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.880]  Getting to be around a bunch of people who are like-minded is rarer than I thought,
[13:50.880 --> 13:52.880]  especially after COVID.
[13:52.880 --> 13:56.880]  So getting to be here and assuming that we could all be friends is a heck of a first start.
[13:56.880 --> 13:59.880]  I appreciate you guys coming out, too.
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.880]  I know there's something new and different, and I appreciate Deidre for pulling it off, Amy as well,
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.880]  everybody who participated in the setup and takedown.
[14:07.880 --> 14:09.880]  So thank you. Thank you for being here.
[14:09.880 --> 14:14.880]  And if anybody's got any mushroom questions, I'm going to be ranting off to the side over here.
[14:14.880 --> 14:18.880]  Come bug me. I won't do it up here because they won't be able to take me down.
[14:18.880 --> 14:20.880]  As I get started, I just don't stop.
[14:20.880 --> 14:25.880]  So that's me. There's my elevator pitch, and I appreciate it. Thanks.
[14:25.880 --> 14:38.700]  The boho is legit.
[14:38.700 --> 14:44.700]  Oh, what's up? All right. I'm the shorty of the group.
[14:44.700 --> 14:48.700]  My name is Amy Lee. I am the boho health coach.
[14:48.700 --> 14:52.700]  I run a cannabis wellness coaching company.
[14:52.700 --> 15:00.700]  And when I tell people I'm a cannabis coach, they're like, oh, so you like help me smoke weed and get high?
[15:00.700 --> 15:04.700]  I'm like, yeah, that's your goal. Yeah, I'm going to help you do that.
[15:04.700 --> 15:06.700]  Let's do that together.
[15:06.700 --> 15:13.700]  But in all seriousness, cannabis saved my life multiple times during my health journey.
[15:13.700 --> 15:28.700]  And now I get to share that with others through education, through educating myself, getting certifications, both in wellness, becoming certified, finishing my nutritionist this year.
[15:28.700 --> 15:31.700]  And I'm also certified as a level three clinician and a trainer.
[15:31.700 --> 15:37.700]  So I train others. I host an apprenticeship. And my goal is really not to coach the world.
[15:37.700 --> 15:41.700]  I don't have that many hours in my day, but to be the ripple.
[15:41.700 --> 15:46.700]  Right. So to teach you what I know and you can take that information and do what you want with it.
[15:46.700 --> 15:52.700]  So I host an apprenticeship. My next apprenticeship is August 8th. You can save your seat for $120.
[15:52.700 --> 15:56.700]  That's right. Shameless plug. But please do go fast.
[15:56.700 --> 16:01.700]  This is my third one. And there's people all across the country and including Canada.
[16:01.700 --> 16:05.700]  So it doesn't matter if you live in a legal state or not. You're a coach.
[16:05.700 --> 16:10.700]  You're just helping people find wellness. And that's completely legal.
[16:10.700 --> 16:15.700]  So anyway, that's what I do. And I'm here from Tulsa.
[16:15.700 --> 16:22.700]  I met Brian in 2019 when I was researching my own wellness and getting education with Rear of Your Organics.
[16:22.700 --> 16:28.700]  And he was talking about soil. So I started geeking out. Oh, my gosh, I'm jumping in my lead. I'm smoking.
[16:28.700 --> 16:33.700]  And then came along education. And now that I'm very honored to be here.
[16:33.700 --> 16:39.700]  Thank you for letting me share the stage. If you guys are growers, I am not.
[16:39.700 --> 16:43.700]  So I don't have a green thumb at all. But I love learning what you do.
[16:43.700 --> 16:49.700]  And I love why it's important and hearing your passion. So thank you so much.
[16:54.700 --> 17:00.700]  All right. So the reason why you guys were able to have ticket prices so low is because of all the people that you just heard.
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.700]  So another round of applause for those guys.
[17:04.700 --> 17:11.700]  Especially the James. He's given out a lot of his canvas to you guys to enjoy as well.
[17:11.700 --> 17:14.700]  A lot of these speakers that are here today are nationally known.
[17:14.700 --> 17:19.700]  Every single one that you are going to hear from now on has been hand selected by me for a reason.
[17:19.700 --> 17:31.700]  So I'm excited to really bring Tulsa, Oklahoma, this level of education and also to the future candidates project so that we can continue to have this basically in the ether of YouTube forever.
[17:31.700 --> 17:42.700]  So the first speaker that I want to introduce you guys to, especially here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is well known in Colorado for not only his DJ skills, but also making high end soil.
[17:42.700 --> 17:49.700]  It's extremely hard, especially at the commercial level, to make soil that people want to buy in bulk and truckloads.
[17:49.700 --> 17:54.700]  And that's something that Bart is well known for in Colorado. I'm excited to bring him up on the stage right now.
[17:54.700 --> 17:57.700]  So Bart, from KM to Soil, we appreciate you sir.
[17:57.700 --> 18:03.700]  He put a lot of this stuff together behind the scenes. We were here late last night trying to set up all the audio and stuff.
[18:03.700 --> 18:08.700]  So he's been a huge part of this as well as Kate back there. So thank you guys.
[18:08.700 --> 18:09.700]  Thank you.
[18:09.700 --> 18:11.700]  Thank you, Brian.
[18:11.700 --> 18:14.700]  Thanks to everybody here today.
[18:14.700 --> 18:18.700]  I'm Bart Heller, aka DJ Art Beller.
[18:18.700 --> 18:23.700]  And we're going to talk living soil, which is a passion of mine.
[18:23.700 --> 18:29.700]  And I'm going to start out just a little bit telling you all how I got to this stage of life.
[18:29.700 --> 18:37.700]  But as a kid, my mom, growing up in Colorado Springs, was really into growing exotic flowers.
[18:37.700 --> 18:44.700]  I was always in a greenhouse with her when I was little and saw a lot of the stuff she did.
[18:44.700 --> 18:48.700]  But like a lot of us, she loved to use Miracle-Gro.
[18:49.700 --> 18:52.700]  She thought that was how you grew a plant.
[18:52.700 --> 19:07.700]  And a lot of us in the generations after our grandparents really got an idea that agriculture needed soluble salt synthetic fertilizer.
[19:07.700 --> 19:14.700]  And I carried that on into my early, early teens.
[19:14.700 --> 19:25.700]  And when I got into growing, I started out in an aeroponic system running some sort of alleged NASA soluble salts.
[19:25.700 --> 19:40.700]  And I could get big plants, but I had to do a lot of work finding pests, pathogens, and was kind of struggling but not knowing why.
[19:40.700 --> 19:47.700]  And a good friend turned me on to a big fat book from Australia, which was the original Permaculture Bible.
[19:47.700 --> 19:54.700]  And I started seeing those concepts, and it changed my whole way of thinking.
[19:54.700 --> 20:04.700]  It started this seed that, hmm, maybe a synthetic salt fertilizer isn't the best way to grow a plant.
[20:05.700 --> 20:09.700]  And I moved from Moab to Paonia, Colorado.
[20:09.700 --> 20:15.700]  And Paonia, Colorado is a little town on the West Slope, probably about 1,500 people.
[20:15.700 --> 20:22.700]  It is the birthplace of Terrence McKenna, and it's the birthplace of Chemdog.
[20:22.700 --> 20:32.700]  And some kids from Crested Butte, a nearby ski town in the 90s, managed to save a cut of one of their seeds from our area.
[20:32.700 --> 20:35.700]  And we all know what happened from there.
[20:35.700 --> 20:40.700]  So, you know, it's a cool place.
[20:40.700 --> 20:50.700]  And seeing these hundreds of organic farms combined with my previous knowledge, we all started as a community talking about what's possible.
[20:50.700 --> 20:59.700]  Is it possible to reproduce a rainforest environment in a pot?
[20:59.700 --> 21:01.700]  And it's a tough question.
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.700]  It's not easy to do.
[21:03.700 --> 21:11.700]  But that's the interesting thing, is when you look at the rainforest, nobody is out feeding Miracle-Gro to the rainforest,
[21:11.700 --> 21:16.700]  and yet it produces more biomass than any region of the world.
[21:16.700 --> 21:26.700]  And so you see that nature actually has all of these systems built into it to provide everything that the plant needs.
[21:27.700 --> 21:36.700]  The problem is that as human beings, we got an idea that there was a better way to do this, which actually, in my opinion, is a worse way to do it.
[21:36.700 --> 21:38.700]  How did this happen?
[21:38.700 --> 21:40.700]  Well, it's really interesting.
[21:40.700 --> 21:43.700]  A lot of it happened around World War II.
[21:43.700 --> 21:52.700]  And as we were facing a global onslaught of fascism, which we know a little bit about today,
[21:52.700 --> 21:58.700]  we started needing to make a lot of nitrates to go drop them on our enemies at the time.
[21:58.700 --> 22:06.700]  And we built up an industry based on creating thousands and thousands and thousands of tons of this stuff.
[22:06.700 --> 22:12.700]  And people noticed if you spilled it on your grass, the grass got greener and grew bigger.
[22:13.700 --> 22:25.700]  And a German chemist I learned from Dr. Faust the other day was the guy who originally got the idea that you only need N, P, and K soluble salts.
[22:25.700 --> 22:32.700]  Now, what's interesting is long before this, there was a guy, William Albrecht.
[22:32.700 --> 22:36.700]  He was a PhD soil scientist at the University of Missouri.
[22:37.700 --> 22:42.700]  And he was operating in the same time as people like Rudolf Steiner.
[22:42.700 --> 22:50.700]  And Steiner, if you know him, he's the father of biodynamics, Waldorf, all sorts of cool things.
[22:50.700 --> 22:58.700]  He was a really educated person and an enlightened person and had a lot of great ideas.
[22:59.700 --> 23:07.700]  Albrecht is a consummate scientist, and he really was doing hard research.
[23:07.700 --> 23:17.700]  And you almost never hear of Albrecht, but in my opinion, his work was as important, if not more important, than the work of someone like Steiner.
[23:17.700 --> 23:26.700]  Because Albrecht really figured out that, one, you need a full mineral profile to grow plants right.
[23:27.700 --> 23:36.700]  And if there's one thing I'm going to say, and yeah, I sell apothecary soil and all that, but this applies to growing any plant anywhere in the world,
[23:36.700 --> 23:41.700]  you need to have your minerals set right to have success.
[23:41.700 --> 23:50.700]  There's no way, if any of your minerals are out past a certain point, you're just not going to be able to get what you want.
[23:50.700 --> 23:59.700]  And if you want to unlock the true genetic potential of a plant, and especially a pinnacle feeder like cannabis, you need to get those minerals into ratio.
[23:59.700 --> 24:10.700]  And the fact that a guy in the 30s figured all of this out and perfectly blew my mind once I kind of figured out that he was out there.
[24:10.700 --> 24:17.700]  And so what happened to Albrecht is the nitrate companies came home from the war.
[24:17.700 --> 24:22.700]  They said, hey guys, we've got this new method and all you need is N, P, and K.
[24:22.700 --> 24:27.700]  Albrecht was saying, hey, no, you need calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, sulfate.
[24:27.700 --> 24:31.700]  That sounds really complicated when you've got this easy method.
[24:31.700 --> 24:34.700]  There's a lot of appeal to that.
[24:34.700 --> 24:44.700]  What people didn't realize at the time is that they were sacrificing something.
[24:45.700 --> 24:50.700]  And so I'll explain a little bit about what happens when you use a nitrate nitrogen.
[24:50.700 --> 24:54.700]  It's a little bit like steroids for a plant.
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.700]  Can it grow a bigger plant?
[24:56.700 --> 24:58.700]  Maybe, or at least as big of one.
[24:58.700 --> 25:02.700]  But occasionally I see some even more small plants.
[25:02.700 --> 25:07.700]  And one of the reasons it's doing that is because it's stretching the cells.
[25:07.700 --> 25:09.700]  It's making the cells bigger.
[25:09.700 --> 25:15.700]  That stretched cell is going to have a thinner and less pathogen-resistant cell wall.
[25:15.700 --> 25:18.700]  And as well, you're stripping boron.
[25:18.700 --> 25:22.700]  When you add the nitrate, you're reducing the amount of boron in the cell.
[25:22.700 --> 25:29.700]  And the reason boron is important is it's the base of all of the plant's immune functions.
[25:29.700 --> 25:37.700]  So if you strip that boron and you don't have it available, that's your kind of second weakness you've created to pests and pathogens.
[25:37.700 --> 25:46.700]  And so immediately, right away, when you use a nitrate salt, you're down two strikes against these pests and pathogens.
[25:46.700 --> 25:58.700]  And so that's why we really like to try to feed nitrogens as, at the minimum, a soluble amino.
[25:58.700 --> 26:02.700]  There are a lot of more complex amino acids out in the world.
[26:02.700 --> 26:04.700]  And that's another cool little bit of chemistry.
[26:04.700 --> 26:15.700]  I wasn't the best chemist in high school, I think, mainly because it wasn't explained to me in the way that I now think about chemistry.
[26:15.700 --> 26:25.700]  I'm less interested in balances and more interested in bonds and reactions and those reactions with microbes and plants
[26:25.700 --> 26:33.700]  and tying all of this together into a much more cohesive concept.
[26:33.700 --> 26:36.700]  And so for me, that's what changed it all.
[26:36.700 --> 26:46.700]  And so in an organic system, the plant has a lot more control.
[26:46.700 --> 26:51.700]  And this is one thing that Albrecht proved, again, and it blew my mind when I figured this out,
[26:51.700 --> 27:02.700]  is that in an organic system, the plant has full bidirectional control of water and nutrients in and out of the roots.
[27:02.700 --> 27:12.700]  And so what that means is that the plant can be drinking water and sending sugars and phosphorus and root exudates out into the soil.
[27:12.700 --> 27:14.700]  And the same thing can be happening.
[27:14.700 --> 27:19.700]  The plant can be bringing nutrients in and sending water out into the soil.
[27:19.700 --> 27:30.700]  And these relationships between these microbes and plants get extremely complicated, and they all affect each other.
[27:30.700 --> 27:35.700]  And if you had to try to do that in a synthetic system, it's just too much.
[27:35.700 --> 27:37.700]  Like, a person can't do this.
[27:37.700 --> 27:50.700]  But that's the miracle of organic living soil is that you're taking advantage of this system that our ancestors evolved with over tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years.
[27:50.700 --> 27:59.700]  And all of these little bits of it are free, helpful bots that want to do your work for you, want to keep your plants healthy.
[27:59.700 --> 28:02.700]  Your plant is adapted to this.
[28:02.700 --> 28:10.700]  A soluble salt that came along in the 60s hasn't had this time to build a whole system to work with.
[28:10.700 --> 28:12.700]  Could nature do that? Maybe.
[28:12.700 --> 28:22.700]  But it's so much better to not try to force a new system into a system that's been working for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years.
[28:22.700 --> 28:33.700]  And so that's something that fascinates me, and that's a huge thing you lose when you go to a salt, is that if the plant wants to drink water, it has to take that food.
[28:33.700 --> 28:35.700]  It doesn't have a choice.
[28:35.700 --> 28:48.700]  And so now you, as the god of that system, you better get that salt right, and you better get all the components of it right, and you better have another chemical to spray when this happens, and another chemical to spray when that happens.
[28:48.700 --> 28:53.700]  And you just get into a game of whack-a-mole, when instead you can use nature.
[28:53.700 --> 29:02.700]  And that's really, at the end, one of the reasons why we make our products the way we do, is because I'm a consummately lazy grower or gardener.
[29:02.700 --> 29:07.700]  I don't want to have to actively maintain and control all this.
[29:07.700 --> 29:18.700]  I'm basically just there trying to be a steward of this environment and create an ecosystem as much like the rainforest as I can in my growth.
[29:18.700 --> 29:36.700]  And so this knowledge of Albrecht's, that you really lose all this control, or you have to take the control, I guess, is a better way to say it, and then you lose the ability to let the environment take care of your plants for you.
[29:36.700 --> 29:42.700]  And does that mean that growing in living soil, you're never going to get a pest, or you're never going to get a pathogen?
[29:43.700 --> 29:59.700]  No, but through integrated pest management, which is a science of trying to use all the elements of nature, there are a lot of solutions to manage your grow that don't involve chemicals or spraying or anything like that.
[30:00.700 --> 30:05.700]  And so that just really, one, fascinates me.
[30:05.700 --> 30:07.700]  It makes me happy about my health.
[30:07.700 --> 30:12.700]  It makes me happy about the environment.
[30:12.700 --> 30:20.700]  And it really just helps me out and takes a big load off of what I do.
[30:21.700 --> 30:41.700]  And the grows and growers that we consult with are able to save a lot of money, and a lot of them have been able to take their grows from being on the edge of competing, the edge of maybe failure, and suddenly are now quite profitable and very hard to compete with by their competitors.
[30:41.700 --> 30:48.700]  And so that's why I think this is the future, not just for the health, not for the terpenes.
[30:48.700 --> 30:54.700]  That's the other thing that's going to go through the roof as you get this fully mineralized profile.
[30:54.700 --> 31:09.700]  And what's fascinating about that is Albrecht figured that out by watching livestock who've been in a field where the animals have been consuming the same grass over and over.
[31:10.700 --> 31:14.700]  And in a place like Oklahoma or Ohio, you can grow grass.
[31:14.700 --> 31:17.700]  You can grow it really great, and you can grow it with nitrates.
[31:17.700 --> 31:19.700]  You can grow it with not much.
[31:19.700 --> 31:27.700]  But after a number of harvests of livestock off a field, those minerals are going to be depleted.
[31:27.700 --> 31:33.700]  And he wanted to know, why do the cows, why do the pigs want the grass on the other side of the fence?
[31:33.700 --> 31:35.700]  And it's the classic, the grass is greener.
[31:35.700 --> 31:48.700]  I believe this is actually where this saying came from, is that he would have cows break through a fence in a field that has four-foot-tall grass because they want to eat the grass on the other side of the fence that's fully mineralized.
[31:48.700 --> 31:52.700]  And it's one of the things we see in vegetables in the store.
[31:52.700 --> 32:09.700]  If you analyze the mineral content of a normal vegetable, it's significantly lower, like several times lower than an organically grown vegetable, and then in particular an organically grown vegetable that's in fully mineralized soil.
[32:10.700 --> 32:13.700]  And so the same exact thing happens in cannabis.
[32:13.700 --> 32:26.700]  Without those minerals, the mechanisms that the plant evolved with to produce those terpenes don't have the raw ingredients that they need, and you just won't get the flavor out of it.
[32:26.700 --> 32:43.700]  And time and time again, I have salt guys who switch to us, and even if they want to keep running their salts on top, which I don't recommend, but I've got some of them that do it, and they'll immediately, their next harvest, they'll say, we've never had this flavor, never, ever, ever.
[32:43.700 --> 32:47.700]  And if they would just go all the way organic, they'd have even more flavor.
[32:48.700 --> 32:57.700]  And so it's something I really believe about passionately, not only because we want better wheat, but also because we want to be healthy.
[32:57.700 --> 33:03.700]  We want to be healthy in the medicine that we create for our customers.
[33:03.700 --> 33:10.700]  And so these are some of the base principles of what we do.
[33:11.700 --> 33:19.700]  And then the cool thing about the minerals is that the minerals won't make it to the plant on their own.
[33:19.700 --> 33:22.700]  Like, there's a whole stage in between.
[33:22.700 --> 33:29.700]  Most of these minerals come in an insoluble form and in a form that the plant can't utilize.
[33:30.700 --> 33:41.700]  And you need these soil organisms, whether they're bacterial, fungal, microarthropods, you need them to be your little chemical factories and bioprocess them.
[33:41.700 --> 33:57.700]  And yeah, I knew a compost microbe could break down organic matter and turn it into something else, but it didn't hit me until I was doing it professionally that these microbes are literally a chemical factory.
[33:58.700 --> 34:09.700]  They're anaerobic organisms they found in certain non-good compost.
[34:09.700 --> 34:21.700]  If you let a compost go anaerobic, no air to it, these microbes can actually generate toluene and xylene, and those same microbes can break it back down again in the same process.
[34:21.700 --> 34:26.700]  That's how crazy they are of their ability to process things.
[34:26.700 --> 34:33.700]  And it's why in composting, composting is a great way to clean up toxins.
[34:33.700 --> 34:36.700]  Now, are there chemicals they can't break down? Sure.
[34:36.700 --> 34:48.700]  Persistent herbicides are the main class of chemicals that these, even these advanced soil microbes just can't step up to the level and crack that bond.
[34:49.700 --> 35:00.700]  But other than herbicides, pretty much the compost microbes can break down any toxic chemical and bio-convert them into a safe base substance.
[35:00.700 --> 35:12.700]  Now, that doesn't mean you should go use the worst waste you can as your compost feedstock, but it does mean you can feel really safe with most well-made compost out there.
[35:12.700 --> 35:19.700]  That if there was any chemical present in that to begin with, it's gone and it's turned into something totally different.
[35:19.700 --> 35:21.700]  And so that's really magic.
[35:21.700 --> 35:32.700]  And as important as bacteria are, and most compost are made with a method that makes them bacterially dominant.
[35:33.700 --> 35:41.700]  I don't know how many of y'all have seen how compost is made, but the most traditional tool is called a windrow turner.
[35:41.700 --> 35:49.700]  And it's a giant auger machine, and somebody runs this machine through the pile, and that brings air back into the pile.
[35:49.700 --> 35:56.700]  And that's one of the tricks in making compost, is you have to get air into the pile pretty much every eight hours.
[35:56.700 --> 36:00.700]  And so you run the machine, you run the machine, and bacteria don't care.
[36:00.700 --> 36:06.700]  They're really strong and resilient, and they can get beat up and flourish fine.
[36:06.700 --> 36:09.700]  Fungal organisms are a different story.
[36:09.700 --> 36:12.700]  Anything like a mushroom is really delicate.
[36:12.700 --> 36:16.700]  It has a spore, that's what is its seed, essentially.
[36:16.700 --> 36:18.700]  It has mycelium.
[36:18.700 --> 36:20.700]  The mycelium is made from hyphae.
[36:20.700 --> 36:23.700]  And all of that is delicate.
[36:23.700 --> 36:30.700]  So this windrow turner actually selects for a bacterial compost and destroys the fungal organisms.
[36:30.700 --> 36:41.700]  And if you want to make a compost with fungal organisms, you have to pretty much double the amount of time and effort that you put into culturing those specific organisms.
[36:41.700 --> 36:44.700]  And that's not even starting with mycorrhizae.
[36:45.700 --> 36:54.700]  And that's one of the big things that in the fungal organisms I see as a misunderstanding, is people thinking, oh, I'm going to make a mycorrhizae tea.
[36:54.700 --> 36:56.700]  I'm getting mycorrhizae from here.
[36:56.700 --> 37:00.700]  That white mycelium I see is mycorrhizae.
[37:00.700 --> 37:02.700]  No, none of that's true.
[37:02.700 --> 37:07.700]  You cannot have a mycorrhizae unless it grows on a root.
[37:07.700 --> 37:10.700]  Like if you put it in first, it's not going to grow.
[37:10.700 --> 37:15.700]  If you make a tea with it, you're going to kill it, and it's not going to grow.
[37:15.700 --> 37:22.700]  Mycorrhizae, arbuscular mycorrhizae in particular, is what they call endoscopic.
[37:22.700 --> 37:31.700]  And it's an organism that has an evolution with plants that can work with it, once again, of millions of years.
[37:32.700 --> 37:40.700]  And what it means that it's endoscopic is that the mycelium actually penetrates the cell wall of the plant's roots.
[37:40.700 --> 37:50.700]  And you would think and look at it almost like an infection of a pathogen, yet it's done in a symbiotic, friendly way.
[37:50.700 --> 37:53.700]  And the plant says, hey, you can do a ton for me.
[37:53.700 --> 37:58.700]  You can go out and reach out into the soil way further than my roots can.
[37:58.700 --> 38:06.700]  And you can use this advanced chemistry to break down these minerals and bring them back directly into the cell wall.
[38:06.700 --> 38:13.700]  And tell you what, that helps me out so much, I'll give you some sugar to grow more mycorrhizae in exchange.
[38:13.700 --> 38:16.700]  And it's an amazing symbiotic relationship.
[38:16.700 --> 38:23.700]  And phosphorus is the trigger that the plant uses.
[38:23.700 --> 38:27.700]  And if the mycorrhizae was in control, once again, it'd be kind of like the salts.
[38:27.700 --> 38:31.700]  The mycorrhizae would overload the plant with food.
[38:31.700 --> 38:38.700]  But instead, the plant controls the relationship through those sugar exudates out from the roots.
[38:38.700 --> 38:43.700]  And it tells the mycorrhizae, hey, I need more phosphorus, here's more sugar.
[38:43.700 --> 38:46.700]  And the mycorrhizae brings that back in.
[38:47.700 --> 38:58.700]  And that's just one of the thousands and thousands of relationships in a living organic soil system that happen on a second-by-second basis.
[38:58.700 --> 39:03.700]  So, how much time do we have, Brandon?
[39:03.700 --> 39:05.700]  We've got a few minutes for Q&A.
[39:05.700 --> 39:07.700]  Yep, okay, great.
[39:07.700 --> 39:08.700]  So I'm going to wrap up.
[39:08.700 --> 39:11.700]  That's a little bit about what I think about living organic soil.
[39:11.700 --> 39:14.700]  If you all have any questions.
[39:15.700 --> 39:17.700]  Yep, fire away.
[39:17.700 --> 39:24.700]  And we've got another microphone here, so grab the mic or Brian can take it to you.
[39:24.700 --> 39:27.700]  And then the folks at home can hear the questions, too.
[39:27.700 --> 39:44.160]  Yeah, go ahead.
[39:44.160 --> 39:47.160]  So I worked at Buffalo in Colorado.
[39:47.160 --> 39:54.160]  One of the biggest issues that we had, we have the things to make soil, but nothing ever seemed to really churn correctly.
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.160]  Were there human beings running those machines?
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.160]  There were human beings running those machines.
[40:01.160 --> 40:11.160]  And so if I sometimes wasn't on my staff, sometimes mistakes were made, or we would have to remake batches, because consistency is obviously key when you're making soil at that level.
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.160]  So how do you keep consistency?
[40:13.160 --> 40:22.160]  How are you able to continue to improve that and offer healthy soil systems in a consistent manner at the truckload level?
[40:22.160 --> 40:23.160]  Sure thing.
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.160]  It is a huge part of making a soil.
[40:27.160 --> 40:42.160]  Before I started doing it myself, I thought, well, some of these other guys, and I won't name names, they might not be making as good a soil as me or whatever, but I thought they at least made the same thing every time, relatively.
[40:42.160 --> 40:45.160]  We'd all seen a little bit of wishy-washy.
[40:45.160 --> 40:47.160]  And I started testing what was on the market.
[40:47.160 --> 40:55.160]  And I was shocked to find that out of four bags, all four bags would be totally different in their composition.
[40:55.160 --> 41:00.160]  And I thought it was going to be easier to create a consistent product when I started.
[41:00.160 --> 41:01.160]  It was actually hard.
[41:01.160 --> 41:08.160]  Like for the first year, year and a half, it was surprising how hard it was to get every batch the same.
[41:08.160 --> 41:13.160]  But we, one, have a very specific protocol.
[41:14.160 --> 41:16.160]  And all of our workers follow this protocol.
[41:16.160 --> 41:23.160]  And there's always multiple workers doing each step so that they're checking each other and checking checklists.
[41:23.160 --> 41:34.160]  And we don't ever let – while it's one of the hardest jobs at our place, building these new packs, we don't have the new guys doing the new packs.
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.160]  We consider it to be the most important part of what we do.
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.160]  And so there are guys all armored up in their dust masks and goggles.
[41:42.160 --> 41:51.160]  And all day long, they're out there humping thousands and thousands of pounds of newts and building these newt packs so that each one is exactly the same.
[41:51.160 --> 41:58.160]  And then on top of that, because it's organic, the materials aren't always exactly the same.
[41:58.160 --> 42:00.160]  It's a natural product.
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.160]  And one batch may be slightly different than another.
[42:03.160 --> 42:09.160]  So as the trucks of materials come in, we're immediately grabbing tests, any tests we can do in-house.
[42:09.160 --> 42:13.160]  We're testing core for salt.
[42:13.160 --> 42:21.160]  Even if we've got a lab report that says it's good, we dig in to the middle of the pallet and really see how salty is that.
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.160]  And if we need to, we'll refuse that truck and send it back.
[42:25.160 --> 42:37.160]  Also, if we have a slight variation, our weekly tests will show us and we'll make minute adjustments to keep everything within those Albrecht ratios or those specs that we want to see.
[42:44.530 --> 42:46.530]  Thank you. Appreciate it, everybody.
[42:52.780 --> 42:54.780]  Again, Bart really came through.
[42:54.780 --> 42:59.780]  A few people that were even on my team kind of let me down putting this together behind the scenes.
[42:59.780 --> 43:03.780]  And Bart and CBD DJ back there, they really came through.
[43:03.780 --> 43:04.780]  So appreciate you, buddy.
[43:04.780 --> 43:05.780]  As well as Kate.
[43:05.780 --> 43:06.780]  Thank you, Kate.
[43:06.780 --> 43:08.780]  So next is Amy Lee.
[43:08.780 --> 43:11.780]  She is somebody I feel like is an inspiration.
[43:11.780 --> 43:23.780]  I know a lot of us, myself, when I was really into late-night munchies and stuff like that, eating a lot of peanut butter M&Ms, tried to be healthy, but late-night kind of stuff just had a bunch of issues.
[43:23.780 --> 43:25.780]  So that's when I discovered intermittent fasting.
[43:25.780 --> 43:28.780]  It's something that I always try to give, even on Thursdays.
[43:28.780 --> 43:31.780]  That will also get you to what's known as autophagy.
[43:31.780 --> 43:38.780]  So if you've ever heard that word before, I encourage you to find out what that does, what's going on inside of the body, because that's something that's changed my life.
[43:38.780 --> 43:46.780]  And now I've basically grown on what's known as ketones instead of sugars, which I like to consider like the synthetic salts for the human body.
[43:46.780 --> 43:53.780]  You know, you are growing and moving around and creating energy, but it's really taxing on the system.
[43:53.780 --> 43:57.780]  So Amy is somebody that I feel like is proof of that transformation.
[43:57.780 --> 44:07.780]  She was able to lose a lot of weight and continue to understand that health is really where it's at, understanding cannabis, understanding the minor and major ketones.
[44:07.780 --> 44:09.780]  So Amy Lee.
[44:10.780 --> 44:20.730]  I've got to bring all my things, right?
[44:20.730 --> 44:25.730]  You have to stay hydrated if you're a stoner.
[44:25.730 --> 44:31.730]  I'm going to share a little bit.
[44:31.730 --> 44:37.730]  I'm going to move this down a little more.
[44:46.730 --> 44:49.730]  Yeah, fabulous.
[44:49.730 --> 44:50.730]  Fabulous.
[44:50.730 --> 44:52.730]  So, again, my name is Amy Lee.
[44:52.730 --> 44:59.730]  I am the health coach and I am so excited to be here speaking with you guys.
[44:59.730 --> 45:09.730]  I have a little I don't know if it's a joke or a dare there, but with my following on TikTok, I have a lot of cannabis content on there and things like that.
[45:09.730 --> 45:12.730]  And I said, I'm so excited to be doing this show.
[45:12.730 --> 45:16.730]  I'm going to be doing a show with a bunch of growers and not showers.
[45:16.730 --> 45:20.730]  And that's the first time.
[45:20.730 --> 45:23.730]  And they were like, oh, you got to tell that joke.
[45:23.730 --> 45:24.730]  You got to tell that joke.
[45:24.730 --> 45:27.730]  And of course, I was going to look at the moment.
[45:27.730 --> 45:30.730]  So I'm so glad to be here nerding out with you guys.
[45:30.730 --> 45:37.730]  I'm growing because as a coach, I've got to be able to direct my clients to good medicine.
[45:37.730 --> 45:38.730]  Right.
[45:38.730 --> 45:45.730]  And a lot of times they come to me, they don't know how to identify good medicine.
[45:45.730 --> 45:46.730]  They're listening to the butt tender.
[45:46.730 --> 45:48.730]  That's like this is fire.
[45:48.730 --> 45:50.730]  This is gas.
[45:50.730 --> 45:54.730]  Oh, the THP percentage on this is a lot.
[45:54.730 --> 45:56.730]  You don't even know. Right.
[45:56.730 --> 45:58.730]  And that's what they're being sold.
[45:58.730 --> 46:00.730]  Right.
[46:00.730 --> 46:04.730]  And immediately I'm like, oh, I don't know if that's what I want.
[46:05.730 --> 46:10.730]  I have rheumatoid arthritis and I have hyperthyroidism and I have a lot of pain.
[46:10.730 --> 46:13.730]  I have, you know, a lot of inflammation in my body.
[46:13.730 --> 46:18.730]  I don't know if I want all the fire.
[46:18.730 --> 46:22.730]  And so I went on a journey.
[46:22.730 --> 46:26.730]  I have to have my notes.
[46:26.730 --> 46:29.730]  My ADHD and I get lost.
[46:29.730 --> 46:47.770]  But on my journey, I started off using cannabis as a medicine for not weight loss or not anything like that.
[46:47.770 --> 46:51.770]  I was living in West Virginia at the time with my husband.
[46:51.770 --> 46:56.770]  I was married and I had postpartum depression, really bad.
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.770]  I'm living in a state.
[46:58.770 --> 47:01.770]  I didn't know anybody's mom.
[47:01.770 --> 47:03.770]  I didn't know anything.
[47:03.770 --> 47:06.770]  And one of my friends said, I think you should probably get high.
[47:06.770 --> 47:08.770]  You should probably chill out.
[47:08.770 --> 47:09.770]  You're really like OCD.
[47:09.770 --> 47:10.770]  High, strong.
[47:10.770 --> 47:11.770]  Yes.
[47:11.770 --> 47:13.770]  You know, your new mom and all these things.
[47:13.770 --> 47:16.770]  I was just like, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[47:16.770 --> 47:17.770]  I'm lost.
[47:17.770 --> 47:20.770]  And she's like, you should get high.
[47:20.770 --> 47:21.770]  So I did.
[47:21.770 --> 47:25.770]  And I was like, wow, is this what normal people feel like?
[47:25.770 --> 47:30.770]  I like being chill because I love being chill.
[47:30.770 --> 47:33.770]  I like this normal level of headiness.
[47:33.770 --> 47:40.770]  And so before I had my daughter, I struggled with infertility.
[47:40.770 --> 47:43.770]  I struggled with endometriosis really bad.
[47:43.770 --> 47:49.770]  I had a lot of hormone issues, a lot on a lot of synthetic hormones.
[47:49.770 --> 47:54.770]  And it did a lot of damage to my body over six years.
[47:54.770 --> 47:57.770]  So I ended up gaining a bunch of weight.
[47:57.770 --> 48:01.770]  My heaviest, I was 235 pounds.
[48:01.770 --> 48:03.770]  I had high blood pressure.
[48:03.770 --> 48:05.770]  I was at high risk for a stroke.
[48:05.770 --> 48:10.770]  I had passed out twice and fell down by the stairs once while I was pregnant
[48:10.770 --> 48:11.770]  and then once afterwards.
[48:11.770 --> 48:15.770]  So I was in and out of the hospital all the time.
[48:15.770 --> 48:19.770]  I mean, my doctor was like, I was 27 years old.
[48:19.770 --> 48:22.770]  And he's like, you're not going to live to 36.
[48:22.770 --> 48:25.770]  Like you are dying, my dear.
[48:25.770 --> 48:32.770]  And I was like, at this point, I will eat tree bark if it means I can be a mom.
[48:32.770 --> 48:34.770]  I struggled with infertility for so long.
[48:34.770 --> 48:36.770]  I need to get to wellness.
[48:36.770 --> 48:38.770]  I want to enjoy my life as a mom.
[48:38.770 --> 48:45.770]  So my friend that they suggested for my postpartum, I was like on the interwebs.
[48:45.770 --> 48:49.770]  How do I make brownies with this?
[48:49.770 --> 48:51.770]  How can I make this a daily medicine?
[48:51.770 --> 48:55.770]  How can I use this to help me on my wellness journey?
[48:55.770 --> 48:59.770]  And through the years, I did everything wrong.
[48:59.770 --> 49:01.770]  I did every single fad diet.
[49:01.770 --> 49:02.770]  I did HCG.
[49:02.770 --> 49:04.770]  I was eating 500 calories.
[49:04.770 --> 49:06.770]  I was eating cabbage soup diets.
[49:06.770 --> 49:08.770]  I was drinking hot dog water.
[49:08.770 --> 49:15.770]  You know, I was like whatever it was, I was doing it because I wanted to be healthy, right?
[49:15.770 --> 49:16.770]  Whatever it was.
[49:16.770 --> 49:20.770]  And so CBD came on the market.
[49:20.770 --> 49:21.770]  CBD was real hot.
[49:21.770 --> 49:22.770]  It was real sexy.
[49:22.770 --> 49:27.770]  And the number one thing about it was that it was an anti-inflammatory.
[49:27.770 --> 49:35.770]  And at the source of all of my disease, it was on 10 different prescriptions, was inflammation.
[49:35.770 --> 49:42.770]  And so hiring, I was working with my cardiologist, a dietician, a nutritionist, a personal trainer.
[49:42.770 --> 49:44.770]  I ran two half marathons.
[49:44.770 --> 49:47.770]  I was doing all of these things.
[49:47.770 --> 49:49.770]  And I was still obese.
[49:49.770 --> 49:53.770]  I was still at high risk for all of these things.
[49:53.770 --> 49:55.770]  What's going on here?
[49:55.770 --> 49:57.770]  And it was the inflammation in my body.
[49:57.770 --> 50:01.770]  So I said screw the gym, screw working out, F that.
[50:01.770 --> 50:02.770]  I know how to do all that.
[50:02.770 --> 50:04.770]  Don't teach me how to do another pushup.
[50:04.770 --> 50:08.770]  I need to focus on what I'm putting in my body, right?
[50:08.770 --> 50:10.770]  And so that's when I dove into it.
[50:10.770 --> 50:14.770]  It's like okay, anti-inflammatory this, anti-inflammatory that.
[50:14.770 --> 50:17.770]  I started using CBD to get off my prescriptions.
[50:17.770 --> 50:23.770]  I wanted to stop treating the side effects from my prescriptions and start treating the symptoms of my actual disease.
[50:23.770 --> 50:28.770]  I did that with my doctor's help, and I lost 125 pounds.
[50:28.770 --> 50:30.770]  I've been able to keep off.
[50:30.770 --> 50:33.770]  I'd like to keep it off.
[50:33.770 --> 50:35.770]  It's been over two years now.
[50:35.770 --> 50:38.770]  And a lot of people say it's so easy to lose weight.
[50:38.770 --> 50:40.770]  It's really hard to maintain it, right?
[50:40.770 --> 50:43.770]  It feels like it's super hard to maintain it.
[50:43.770 --> 50:47.770]  But when you feel so good, it's so easy.
[50:47.770 --> 50:57.770]  And when my clients that work with me, when they start feeling good, they know they look good, they're confident, they know that they're medicating properly, all of these fun things, right?
[50:57.770 --> 51:01.770]  So let's see how I get so passionate.
[51:01.770 --> 51:05.770]  All right.
[51:05.770 --> 51:16.770]  So I worked with my doctor to get off all of my prescriptions and replaced every single one of them using cannabis, using it, layering techniques.
[51:16.770 --> 51:17.770]  What does that look like?
[51:17.770 --> 51:19.770]  Breathables, topicals.
[51:19.770 --> 51:24.770]  I use, you know, RSO daily, CBD.
[51:24.770 --> 51:33.770]  I'm a huge CBD fan, huge CBD fan because it's like such a great anti-inflammatory, and it's the number one cause of our chronic illness.
[51:33.770 --> 51:44.770]  In 2020, the CDC did a study for chronic illnesses across the United States, and 42% of Americans suffer from three or more chronic illnesses.
[51:44.770 --> 51:45.770]  What is a chronic illness?
[51:45.770 --> 51:48.770]  Any illness lasting longer than three months.
[51:48.770 --> 51:54.770]  So if you have stomach issues, IBS, things like that, lasting longer, you are now a chronic illness.
[51:54.770 --> 51:58.770]  You have cardiovascular disease, you have high blood pressure.
[51:58.770 --> 52:02.770]  Diabetes is considered a chronic illness.
[52:02.770 --> 52:07.770]  All of these symptoms can be reversed using cannabis and nutrition together.
[52:07.770 --> 52:17.550]  So that all being said, how to correct this balance?
[52:17.550 --> 52:21.550]  And what's the number one question I get as a coach?
[52:21.550 --> 52:23.550]  Do you not get the munchies?
[52:23.550 --> 52:25.550]  Like how do you not get the munchies?
[52:25.550 --> 52:27.550]  How do I not get the munchies, right?
[52:28.550 --> 52:36.550]  If you want wellness, if you're seeking wellness, and then you're like, oh my gosh, I don't want to smoke until the end of the night because I don't want to get the munchies during the day.
[52:36.550 --> 52:38.550]  I don't want to have that.
[52:38.550 --> 52:42.550]  And the majority of my clients come to me because they don't want the munchies.
[52:42.550 --> 52:48.550]  And I wish it was simple in saying pick this terpene, pick this cannabinoid.
[52:49.550 --> 53:01.550]  And even though we know there is some scientific research that shows benefits to some cannabinoids and terpenes, it really is what we're consuming and how we're consuming cannabis.
[53:01.550 --> 53:03.550]  Are you consuming clean cannabis?
[53:03.550 --> 53:05.550]  Or how are you layering?
[53:05.550 --> 53:07.550]  What are you, what edibles are you making?
[53:08.550 --> 53:15.550]  I teach and coach a low inflammation diet where my clients can medicate every single meal.
[53:15.550 --> 53:19.550]  And it helps fight inflammation with those foods.
[53:19.550 --> 53:25.550]  So I have them focus on their macronutrients, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
[53:25.550 --> 53:28.550]  And cannabis is a great source of all of those, you guys.
[53:28.550 --> 53:29.550]  I don't know if you know this.
[53:29.550 --> 53:30.550]  Of course you guys know this.
[53:30.550 --> 53:32.550]  You guys are all growers.
[53:33.550 --> 53:38.550]  So it is like almost a complete nutrient for the body.
[53:38.550 --> 53:43.550]  You've got protein, calcium, magnesium, iron, folate, all of these wonderful things.
[53:43.550 --> 53:47.550]  It also contains three omega fatty acids, 3, 6, 9.
[53:47.550 --> 53:49.550]  Why are these important?
[53:49.550 --> 53:50.550]  You want to look fat.
[53:50.550 --> 53:52.550]  That's what I'm talking about.
[53:52.550 --> 53:55.550]  Omega-3 fatty acids help you with energy.
[53:55.550 --> 53:57.550]  They help regulate your sleep.
[53:58.550 --> 54:04.550]  So pairing your medicine that you're making at home, that you're dabbing, that you're cooking with, whatever it is,
[54:04.550 --> 54:11.550]  pairing it with a low inflammation diet that has balanced carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
[54:11.550 --> 54:13.550]  is going to help you balance your wellness.
[54:13.550 --> 54:18.550]  So my clients, when we're working together and we're talking about mastering the munchies,
[54:18.550 --> 54:20.550]  they're like, well, don't you get the munchies?
[54:20.550 --> 54:21.550]  I'm like, hell yeah.
[54:21.550 --> 54:22.550]  Yeah.
[54:22.550 --> 54:27.550]  And when I do, that means I'm probably not fueling my body properly for that day.
[54:27.550 --> 54:29.550]  Because what's the whole purpose of cannabis?
[54:29.550 --> 54:31.550]  It's homeostasis.
[54:31.550 --> 54:32.550]  It's balance.
[54:32.550 --> 54:36.550]  So if you're getting the munchies, I tell them to reflect on what have you eaten today?
[54:36.550 --> 54:38.550]  An iced coffee?
[54:38.550 --> 54:40.550]  And a croissant?
[54:40.550 --> 54:42.550]  Yes, you have the munchies.
[54:42.550 --> 54:44.550]  Your body needs food.
[54:44.550 --> 54:45.550]  It's fuel.
[54:45.550 --> 54:48.550]  It's the whole point of your body as a machine.
[54:48.550 --> 54:50.550]  It's fuel.
[54:50.550 --> 54:51.550]  You need to eat.
[54:51.550 --> 54:57.550]  So when you're getting those munchies, I tell my clients, journal, three days, medicate,
[54:57.550 --> 55:01.550]  look at what you're eating, look at what you're consuming, and let's adjust from there.
[55:01.550 --> 55:08.550]  It's not about calories in, calories out.
[55:08.550 --> 55:10.550]  That's a diet mindset.
[55:10.550 --> 55:13.550]  That's a really toxic mindset.
[55:13.550 --> 55:16.550]  So I really focus on helping that.
[55:16.550 --> 55:18.550]  So I make these really, really great bars.
[55:18.550 --> 55:20.550]  And I've got some people that have made it before.
[55:20.550 --> 55:23.550]  They tag me in their posts, and I've got the recipe up.
[55:23.550 --> 55:28.550]  They're like dark chocolate cherry bars, and they're high healthy fat.
[55:28.550 --> 55:29.550]  Why is that?
[55:29.550 --> 55:31.550]  We want that omega-3 fatty acid again.
[55:31.550 --> 55:32.550]  We want that heart health.
[55:32.550 --> 55:34.550]  We want that cardiovascular health.
[55:34.550 --> 55:38.550]  These are all the things we know cannabis can already do, but we're just amplifying it with our food.
[55:38.550 --> 55:45.550]  Instead of these over-sugary edibles, that sugar is going to cause more inflammation.
[55:45.550 --> 55:49.550]  Are you treating your wellness, or are you feeding your illness?
[55:49.550 --> 55:55.550]  And it's such a fine line between am I eating for pleasure or am I eating for fuel?
[55:55.550 --> 55:58.550]  And both are okay, right?
[55:58.550 --> 56:02.550]  I have sugary snacks in moderation.
[56:02.550 --> 56:08.550]  I love a good brownie edible, you know, but I'm not eating that every night for my wellness.
[56:08.550 --> 56:11.550]  Instead, I can have some yogurt with some medicated granola.
[56:12.550 --> 56:18.550]  I can have a chocolate mousse that's low inflammation, completely medicated.
[56:18.550 --> 56:23.550]  So it's very easy to start incorporating into your everyday life.
[56:26.550 --> 56:27.550]  All right.
[56:27.550 --> 56:32.550]  So I briefly mentioned a little bit about cannabinoids and terpenes.
[56:32.550 --> 56:45.300]  And when I do give recommendations to my clients on this, there are some, you know,
[56:45.300 --> 56:47.300]  I do state scientific research.
[56:47.300 --> 56:57.300]  Here's what we do know, and here's what we can go by, is that we do know humaline is a terpene that is an appetite suppressant.
[56:57.300 --> 57:01.300]  Now, for some people, they're looking to increase their appetite when they're medicating,
[57:02.300 --> 57:05.300]  and there's many other cannabinoids and terpenes that can help for that.
[57:05.300 --> 57:09.300]  And then also a cannabinoid to look for is THC-B.
[57:09.300 --> 57:16.300]  So just even just these two little key things, when you're a client or you're a patient going in at the dispensary,
[57:16.300 --> 57:21.300]  and you're looking to make, let's say, your own edibles, but you want to do your own flour,
[57:21.300 --> 57:23.300]  I'm looking for a strain that has these terpenes.
[57:23.300 --> 57:30.300]  And maybe it's just higher in this one terpene because you want to suppress that trigger, right?
[57:31.300 --> 57:33.300]  For the menchies, for those cravings.
[57:35.300 --> 57:40.300]  And so those, CBD is another one.
[57:40.300 --> 57:42.300]  I have to write my notes down.
[57:42.300 --> 57:48.300]  CBD is another one also that I recommend, taking like a CBD tincture at night to reduce inflammation,
[57:48.300 --> 57:50.300]  but also to, that signaling.
[57:50.300 --> 57:54.300]  I always recommend to my clients to also see if they're just bored.
[57:55.300 --> 58:00.300]  Sometimes we have triggers because we have false sugar spikes, and we think that we're hungry,
[58:00.300 --> 58:04.300]  we think we're getting a menchie, and sometimes we just have excess energy, we need to get out.
[58:04.300 --> 58:07.300]  I recommend we do meditating.
[58:07.300 --> 58:12.300]  You can do, I do four workouts, four days a week on my YouTube channel with my clients.
[58:12.300 --> 58:17.300]  We do like session sessions, and we do token tones and things like that.
[58:18.300 --> 58:24.300]  It's a lot of fun to move your body and still medicate using those cannabinoids on demand.
[58:25.300 --> 58:32.300]  But as far as beating the menchies, it really is a balance game.
[58:32.300 --> 58:35.300]  It really is finding what works for your body.
[58:35.300 --> 58:39.300]  I recommend to my clients eating six times a day, starting off the first day,
[58:39.300 --> 58:45.300]  within the first hour, 100 calories, getting that endocannabinoid system,
[58:45.300 --> 58:47.300]  having something like a CBD coffee.
[58:47.300 --> 58:49.300]  I know, I mean, I don't know.
[58:49.300 --> 58:50.300]  I wake and bake.
[58:50.300 --> 58:51.300]  Do you guys wake and bake?
[58:51.300 --> 58:52.300]  Do you?
[58:52.300 --> 58:53.300]  Yeah, okay.
[58:53.300 --> 58:58.300]  So when you're waking and baking, right, you're activating that endocannabinoid system.
[58:58.300 --> 59:01.300]  You are getting that metabolism going on its own.
[59:01.300 --> 59:04.300]  So now you've got something to fuel it with.
[59:04.300 --> 59:05.300]  What are you fueling it with?
[59:05.300 --> 59:07.300]  I tell my clients 100 calories.
[59:07.300 --> 59:11.300]  Sometimes I have just little like nut mixes, and that's it.
[59:12.300 --> 59:13.300]  Some toast and jam.
[59:13.300 --> 59:15.300]  It doesn't have to be big.
[59:15.300 --> 59:18.300]  Something in your stomach to help get yourself going for the day.
[59:18.300 --> 59:22.300]  And then from there, eating every two and a half to three hours,
[59:22.300 --> 59:25.300]  breaking up those macronutrients for the day.
[59:25.300 --> 59:32.300]  And I microdose throughout the day with my cannabis.
[59:32.300 --> 59:35.300]  I also use mushroom plant-based wellness.
[59:35.300 --> 59:39.300]  Ethan, who is up here with the Judds, with Ascent Cannabis,
[59:39.300 --> 59:41.300]  they make my gummies as well.
[59:41.300 --> 59:44.300]  And I will tell you that when I met him,
[59:44.300 --> 59:49.300]  the mushroom plant-based wellness really saved my life through COVID,
[59:49.300 --> 59:53.300]  through helping me through my depression and PTSD.
[59:53.300 --> 59:57.300]  So I became a huge fan, and I thanked him to help me with my gummy line,
[59:57.300 --> 59:58.300]  and he agreed.
[59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.300]  So I'm super excited to have those.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.300]  He's brilliant.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.300]  You guys will hear him speak.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.300]  But that's part of my wellness dosing.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.300]  It's not just cannabis as a breathable,
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.300]  but really looking at it as all of the things it can do for you.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.300]  So reducing inflammation from the gut, from the inside out,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.300]  which is where the majority of our illnesses come from,
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.300]  is inflammation throughout our digestive system.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.300]  Am I good on time?
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.300]  Yeah, okay.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  Sweet.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.300]  I'm not going to bore you.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.300]  All right, so what does that look like day to day?
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.300]  Future roadmap, what does that look like?
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.300]  Like I said, getting up in the morning, moving your body 30 minutes a day,
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:43.300]  really paying attention to what you're eating.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.300]  What does a low-inflammation diet look like?
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.300]  Does that mean no carbs?
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.300]  No.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.300]  My clients are usually surprised at how many carbs that they do get to eat
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.300]  during the day, but that's energy.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.300]  And a lot of people come to me, and they're lacking that energy.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.300]  So when we go over their wellness plan, and I'm asking them,
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.300]  you know, what are you doing throughout the day?
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.300]  What's your energy level like?
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.300]  It's usually pretty low.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.300]  And just making some small tweaks to food here and there,
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.300]  and going through some things like that can really make a difference
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.300]  in your wellness.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.300]  That's basically all I do.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.570]  And any questions?
[01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:25.570]  Ask me anything about cannabis coaching.
[01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:29.570]  What percentage of CBD do you like in your companies?
[01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.570]  Let's get that for the issue of cannabis coaching.
[01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.570]  What's up, brother?
[01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.570]  Come on up and ask the question.
[01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.570]  For you guys that don't know, this is Dana Gardner.
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.570]  Check them out on Instagram.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:44.570]  It's pop.
[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.570]  So I would like to know what percentage in milligrams do you like your CBD
[01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.570]  in your gummy bar?
[01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.570]  Okay, so currently the gummies that I'm taking are 30 milligrams.
[01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.570]  Interesting.
[01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:54.570]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:59.570]  And so I usually start my – I take a lot of CBD throughout the day,
[01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.570]  and I give my clients a regimen based on their weight and what their
[01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.570]  antibody level is, and then we titrate them up to that wellness level.
[01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:12.570]  But, I mean, for my height and weight, it's supposed to be like 50 milligrams.
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:13.570]  For the day?
[01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:14.570]  For the day.
[01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:16.570]  But I take around like 300.
[01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.570]  I take a lot.
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.570]  And then I'm wondering that I'm layering with THC products,
[01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:23.570]  mushroom products, you know.
[01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.570]  I think I need to up my CBD intake.
[01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.570]  Yeah.
[01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:27.570]  Well, so here's the deal.
[01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.570]  Like your endophenolphthaleic system is made for those cannabinoids, right,
[01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.570]  to use on demand for stress response, nutrition response,
[01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.570]  allergy response within the body.
[01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:39.570]  And when you're – and if you're using them on demand all day,
[01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:42.570]  you're consuming a small amount, they're going to be gone quicker.
[01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.570]  You know, it's stress responses.
[01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.570]  If I hit my elbow, that's a stress response.
[01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:50.570]  Any cannabinoids I've consumed are now being alerted to go to this area to bring
[01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:52.570]  balance to the body in that area.
[01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:55.570]  So if you're constantly moving, you know.
[01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:56.570]  Indigar is 20%.
[01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:57.570]  Yeah.
[01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:58.570]  Yeah.
[01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:01.570]  I would recommend titrating up and see how you feel.
[01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.570]  Thank you.
[01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.570]  I appreciate that.
[01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:07.030]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:10.030]  There are a few people on there that wanted to know, like,
[01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:14.030]  what strains are best for when you're trying to, you know,
[01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.030]  battle through the munchies and that kind of thing.
[01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.030]  Yes.
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.030]  This is an excellent question.
[01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:25.030]  And I knew that I would be elevated, so I wrote them down.
[01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:30.030]  Okay.
[01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.030]  Yes.
[01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:35.030]  Elevated.
[01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.030]  Elevated.
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.030]  Okay, right on.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.030]  And I don't have my glasses.
[01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.030]  Look at me.
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:44.030]  This is 36, you guys.
[01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.030]  Oh, so I'm a huge fan of anything cookies, right?
[01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:50.030]  So Dosey Dough is a great one.
[01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:53.030]  This helps with – this actually – I'm going to –
[01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.030]  three strains I'm going to list right now are known to help with
[01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.030]  metabolic disorders.
[01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.030]  And when you pair these strains or similar strains with healthy fats,
[01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.030]  which is my favorite thing, like dark chocolate,
[01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:07.030]  it can help lower your blood pressure,
[01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:12.030]  which is something that I've suffered with for 10 years now,
[01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:13.030]  is blood pressure issues.
[01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:17.030]  So using strains like this to help manage my blood pressure has been so
[01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.030]  beneficial and delicious.
[01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:22.030]  So Dosey Dough, Banana OG, and Wedding Cake.
[01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:28.030]  And Wedding Cake is one of my favorite terpene combinations as well.
[01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.030]  I don't know if that made me get concentrated.
[01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:33.030]  And then Girl Scout Cookies, like I said, anything cookies,
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.030]  anything with a cookies lineage.
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:36.030]  I'm like, that's that terpene.
[01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.030]  It's speaking to both my CB2s out there.
[01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:40.030]  I'm like, yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:42.030]  And then Super Lemonade and Headband.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:47.030]  So these are great because they have a high percentage of humulin as well as
[01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.030]  they're known to be potent anti-inflammatory.
[01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:53.030]  And again, that's reducing those symptoms of disease,
[01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:57.030]  including those triggers or those false hunger cravings that can be just
[01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:01.030]  sugar spikes within the body where you think you're feeling hungry,
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:05.030]  but it was just a sugar spike in something you've been seeing previously.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:09.710]  All right.
[01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:10.710]  Thank you, Amy.
[01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:11.710]  Appreciate it.
[01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:12.710]  Thank you.
[01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:13.710]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.710]  Wait, Brian, can you hear me, Brian?
[01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:18.710]  Hold on, Peter's whispering to me as well.
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.710]  There are a couple chat questions.
[01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:32.710]  Let me know when you're ready.
[01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.710]  One second, Peter.
[01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:37.710]  We have a question from the audience and then we'll get on that.
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:38.710]  Okay.
[01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:42.710]  I guess dealing with coaching people, can you speak to like nomenclature?
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.710]  Like you just said elevated instead of high.
[01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.710]  Like is it a challenge?
[01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:54.710]  I feel like the word high has a negative stigma in our society.
[01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.710]  I feel like you say, oh, you're high.
[01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:59.710]  There's a negative draw to it.
[01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:04.710]  I have a variety of clients that come to me that want to be healthy,
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.710]  not high.
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:06.710]  Right.
[01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:12.710]  So choosing words, choosing words like elevated instead of high,
[01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:15.710]  to me, that's changing the stigma.
[01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:20.710]  It's really breaking that view of what is a stoner, right?
[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.710]  Like this is a stoner.
[01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:25.710]  People are crazy, like, wow, you medicate a lot.
[01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.710]  I'm like, yeah, man, because I'm sick.
[01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:31.710]  I know you think I look healthy, but I'm really sick.
[01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:33.710]  And so medicating with this keeps me healthy.
[01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.710]  And that's, for me, I always say, what an opportunity.
[01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:38.710]  What an opportunity to educate somebody.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.710]  I actually had a lady at Office Depot.
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:44.710]  She's like, oh, what do you do for a living?
[01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.710]  I was like, oh, I am a cannabis coach.
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.710]  And she was like, that's sweet, girl.
[01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:52.710]  You soak in marijuana?
[01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:55.710]  And I was like, yes, ma'am, every day.
[01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.710]  Every day.
[01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.710]  And the people there, they know me.
[01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.710]  They're like, it's true, it's true.
[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.710]  So I think really just breaking that stigma and finding words that are
[01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:06.710]  just as harsh.
[01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.710]  Does that answer your question?
[01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:15.710]  And then there was a question online from Green Giant 2021.
[01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:20.710]  Has Amy ever inoculated her growing medium that she uses for her cannabis
[01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:22.710]  with liquid culture or spa?
[01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:27.710]  I said I was in a room full of growers.
[01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.710]  I'm not one.
[01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:32.710]  No, I have not inoculated anything.
[01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:37.710]  Do you want to teach me how to inoculate?
[01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:42.710]  I definitely, the rest of this group following you could definitely teach.
[01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.710]  I'm not the expert.
[01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:48.710]  That's why I love this group, you guys.
[01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.710]  These are experts.
[01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.710]  I mean, this is education.
[01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:54.710]  So I'm super honored to be here again.
[01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:58.710]  One last question from 619 to 664.
[01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:02.710]  Does she take breaks when she's microdosing mushrooms throughout the week?
[01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:07.710]  I've heard many different reasons to not microdose at all,
[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.710]  to not microdose all seven days.
[01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:13.710]  But everyone is different and just wondering why.
[01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:19.710]  So definitely you have to be on your own journey and discover what is right
[01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:20.710]  for you.
[01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:24.710]  But there are different calendars and schedules for that.
[01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:25.710]  Yes.
[01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:26.710]  So I'm a little different.
[01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:29.710]  I normally have six days a month.
[01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:31.710]  Okay.
[01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.710]  Great.
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:33.710]  Yeah.
[01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.710]  That's it.
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.710]  All right.
[01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:36.710]  Thanks so much, you guys.
[01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:53.030]  All right.
[01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:56.030]  So the reason why we have five speakers is because I really wanted to go out
[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.030]  of my way to have three people from Oklahoma.
[01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:00.030]  All right.
[01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:03.030]  I went out of my way to have a female speaker today from Oklahoma as well.
[01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:07.030]  And then I also want to kind of bring that culture because I see that some
[01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:12.030]  people are hesitant to have other people come into their state and grow
[01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:14.030]  cannabis or have some kind of stigma to that.
[01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:18.030]  And so the whole point of this is for that everybody starts to rise together.
[01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.030]  And when I was in Canada, I'm at Dan and Terry here.
[01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:26.030]  And I feel like he kind of is, he epitomizes that to me.
[01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:30.030]  Somebody that is kind of newer to this just a few years into this is,
[01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:32.030]  is doing it from A to Z.
[01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:35.030]  And so that's another reason why he is here speaking today.
[01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:37.030]  And I feel like I've also gone out of my way.
[01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:39.030]  I want to show you your skillset.
[01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:40.030]  You're wearing a horse.
[01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:43.030]  You've only been doing this, I believe, like three years.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:45.030]  So for a lot of us in this room,
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:48.030]  we've obviously cultivated a lot longer than that.
[01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:51.030]  And I feel like his skillset is just impressive.
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:55.030]  So Dan, if you'd like to come up here, brother, we'd love to show that off.
[01:09:55.030 --> 01:10:00.030]  He's going to also do a live demonstration on squishy techniques is what we
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.030]  call it in Colorado.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.660]  You might need to have them on that and set that up.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.020]  Hey, how's it going everybody? I'm Danny. I'm Terry's collective.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.020]  I'm Terry's farms. I am originally from Oklahoma.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.020]  Like we said, I've been going for about a little bit since before they say it
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:37.020]  was legal for us to do.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.020]  This is the opportunity. But honestly,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.020]  I read and I read and I read and I read and tried to learn everything.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.020]  I could as much as I could about growing.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.020]  And then I started trying things and I tried it and it would work.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.020]  Do this again. And from that point on,
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:03.020]  it was reading, trying things and trying my best to stay true to the plan.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:09.020]  And so at the end of the day, Oh, so I can tell you one thing.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.020]  I definitely know a lot of things that do not work.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.020]  I have spent a lot of money on things that do not work.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.020]  And it has been definitely a learning process all the way.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.020]  But yeah, so I'm going to bring up my press,
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:33.020]  show you guys a little couple of techniques, some low hash for my press.
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.020]  I can say we have a growing process. The name of our grows Terry's farms,
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.020]  the name of the process and exterior is,
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:46.020]  everything we do is organic from seed all the way to your dad.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:50.020]  We use no chemicals. We use no solvents and everything like that.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.020]  We also take pride and sorry, I'm watching him carry my baby.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.020]  Okay. Yes, you made it. Yes. Thank you.
[01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:06.350]  Yeah. So this is a press from low-temp plates.
[01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:12.350]  When we're making hash rods and we are pressing mobile hash and this here is a
[01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:17.350]  plate with a heat and pressure is all we use.
[01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:24.350]  And I'm actually, this is a custom made press from loads of plates.
[01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:29.350]  I actually started out with the hydraulic press and using hydraulic press.
[01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:33.350]  I wanted to have a control that I really wanted to be able to do this.
[01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:37.350]  And so I actually had them make me a custom hand press so I could be able to
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.350]  have that control of pressing out certain things,
[01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:42.350]  getting the exact pressure that I wanted and be able to fill it.
[01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:48.350]  It took a lot of work and a lot of practice to be able to control this machine
[01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.350]  in the sense that we,
[01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:53.350]  you can tell when that Rosman is actually coming out and the bubble has just
[01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.350]  telling me you want to give it more pressure.
[01:12:56.350 --> 01:13:00.350]  I actually have a PowerPoint presentation that we will do and I will go into
[01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:03.350]  explaining our organic methods, why I do organic,
[01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:08.350]  as well as what bubble hash is, what hash is, how we make here,
[01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.350]  the methodology behind it, the medicinal properties behind it,
[01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:15.350]  as well as the terpenes and a couple of our products.
[01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:21.350]  So hope you guys are still awake and smoke too much and are enjoying this and
[01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:25.350]  let's press some bubble hash.
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:31.350]  You want to do this?
[01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:32.350]  There you go, bro.
[01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:34.350]  The skills, organic.
[01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:12.930]  So I'd love to put some of you guys that are here in Oklahoma on the spot.
[01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:16.930]  If you want to bring your flower up here and get it switched in front of your
[01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:19.930]  body and show off your skillset, I'm going to open that up to you.
[01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:23.930]  There is a reason why Terry is running awards and I feel like you're getting
[01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:24.930]  to A to Z farmer.
[01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:28.930]  I feel like that is going to be the new kind of frontier for a lot of the
[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:29.930]  younger guys out there.
[01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:33.930]  I just turned 39 years old so I feel like we're continuing to pass on that
[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.930]  educational torch because those younger generations,
[01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.930]  the 20 somethings in my opinion are going to be the ones that are really going
[01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:43.930]  to continue to put out that quality canvas all the way through.
[01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:46.930]  So shout out to the breeders.
[01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:49.930]  They're going out of their way to create that canvas for us and that was really
[01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:50.930]  a secret.
[01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:53.930]  When I first started we didn't tell everybody what breeders we were using and
[01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:55.930]  those guys were making us look fantastic.
[01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:59.930]  So every Thursday we're talking about why genetics are so important.
[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.930]  What Terry is going to show you guys is the finished product and how do we get
[01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.930]  to that finished product, especially only three years in.
[01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:11.930]  This is pretty impressive guys for a lot of us out there that are newer to this.
[01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.930]  This is kind of the goal that you guys want to achieve and if you can get it
[01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:19.930]  done within a four year, a lot of us kind of view it as a four year degree.
[01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:23.930]  If you can get that shit done in four years and really understand cultivating
[01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:27.930]  with a living soil on a commercial scale in four years,
[01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.930]  you're going to do really well for yourself.
[01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:34.930]  So Danny, can I help you back there sir?
[01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:40.930]  Anybody want to bring a flower up here?
[01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:48.930]  We got a, you got a bit of a ring or anything.
[01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:52.930]  So this is another one of our keynote speakers guys for you guys that don't
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:56.930]  know Brandon Russ, one of the best farmers in my opinion out there.
[01:15:57.930 --> 01:16:01.930]  So please check them out. Also we got Marco's growing somewhere.
[01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:04.930]  There is in the back. Another one of our keynote speakers.
[01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:08.930]  And again, this guy is next level and I feel like a lot of highs are going to be
[01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.930]  on him. That's the reason why I'm also doing the podcast with him as well.
[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.930]  So appreciate you Marco. We'll see you in a little bit.
[01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:25.930]  All these stoners, nobody wants to put their flower up there.
[01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:32.930]  They jumped at the chance. There we go.
[01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:33.930]  Well I can assess the list.
[01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.930]  That's your stuff yesterday.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.040]  What about you James?
[01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:23.110]  So who has seen this before? Raise your hand.
[01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:29.110]  So a lot of you haven't. Some of you I know do this for a living.
[01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:33.110]  But for a lot of you, if you haven't seen this, I mean this is,
[01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:36.110]  this is kind of the next frontier. This is how we're going to,
[01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:39.110]  a lot of us judge each other. It's the end result.
[01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:43.110]  By the end result, I mean like getting it to this level and squishing it out
[01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:48.110]  or washing it or whatever you choose to do to get that finished product.
[01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:52.110]  But the finished product is started at the A process and he's showing you
[01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:53.110]  basically the Z.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760]  Okay. So right now I'm just breaking up flower.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760]  I'm not really getting broke.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.760]  Breaking up flower right now.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.760]  So what we're doing is using heat and pressure to brush off the essential oils
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.760]  that are found in the cannabis, which are mainly in the trichome heads.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.760]  So in the trichome heads is where you're going to find most of your
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.760]  phenyl aminoides and your terpenes.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.760]  And so what we have found is that with using the heat and pressure,
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.760]  we're able to press out those essential oils and be able to collect those and
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.760]  make it for a cleaner medicine without so much of the plant material involved.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.760]  And we take that a step farther with the bubble hash by a separation
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.760]  technique using ice water,
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.760]  ice water and a little bit of agitation to actually separate the trichome heads
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.760]  from the stem and collect those. And with that,
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.760]  we can put it within a micron bag,
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.760]  which is kind of like a filter and be able to press out the essentials that
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.760]  way, which is much more cleaner.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760]  Concentrate there.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.760]  In my company we pride ourselves on doing organic,
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.760]  just like you were saying about the living soil.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.760]  That has been something that I've been working on for years.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.760]  I have made really, really good strides in it.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.760]  I don't think I'm anywhere near on that level there,
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.760]  but I do compost and things like that as well because I feel the same way
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.760]  about growing organically. I mean, I don't know how many people, actually,
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.760]  has anybody seen that guy? He's normally in this area.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.760]  He waters that tree across the street. Nobody? Nobody yet?
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.760]  Cause that doesn't happen. We don't have to have that.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.760]  And in nature, if you're, or in growing,
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.760]  if you're able to replicate that same thing,
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.760]  we can have that same effect that we have out of nature where everything's
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.760]  working so just as we together and we don't need to up the sense for all those
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:14.760]  chemicals. We are organic bodies. And in order for us to be,
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.760]  to heal ourselves, we have to heal ourselves with organic nutrients,
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.760]  which is things like cannabis. And just like Amy said a minute ago,
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.760]  if we are trying to heal our body,
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760]  put it in a chemical and stuff like that into our bodies,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.760]  it's not necessarily going to get that job done.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.760]  It's actually going to make it worse. So if you're, in my opinion,
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.760]  and I'm not knocking away anybody grows, grow however you want to grow.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.760]  This is just the way I want to grow. Hey, that's why you don't grow this stuff.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.760]  If you do, you do. It's whatever. But in my opinion,
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:54.760]  we love to grow organic and watch that plant give us the best that it can give
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.760]  because we give it the best that we can give.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.760]  I'm just going to raise this a little bit. I guess that a little children here.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.760]  My business partner says I scream all the time. You guys can't hear me.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.760]  Actually shout out to my business partner here.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.760]  Without her I would not be doing this still.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:26.760]  This has been a journey. This has been a lot of hard work.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.760]  I love blood, sweat and tears literally.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.760]  And without her, I wouldn't be standing here right now.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.760]  It's been a journey. She has definitely been a help along the way.
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.760]  So you guys go team, go to the team. We'll help you get there.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:48.760]  And I think events like this will help us do that.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.760]  Teamwork makes the dream work. Teamwork makes the dream work for sure.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.760]  So I can say right now I'm just breaking the flower up
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  and putting it in the Micron bag to get ready to press.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.760]  We're actually going to heat this press up for a second.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.520]  So a few differences in pressing flower and bubble hash.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.520]  When you're pressing flowers, you do need higher temps
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.520]  because you are pressing with the plant material.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:40.520]  I always, for people who do press, we always double bag.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.520]  Just to be safe. Keep it from having a bad blowout and things like that.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.180]  Can you kind of explain for everybody, especially for the viewers on here,
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.180]  a lot of this is going to be brand new and they seem pretty excited about it.
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:02.180]  So what happens during a blowout? Why do we not want a blowout?
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.180]  Especially when, again, we're taking a canvas that has taken so long to make
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.180]  and that's really a huge screw up.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:12.180]  So can you kind of dive deeper into what a blowout is?
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.180]  Yeah, definitely. A blowout is not a good thing, I mean, ever.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.180]  So what happens is we, like I said, we put this in Micron bags
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.180]  and this is to help filter out the plant material.
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.180]  And so if you're not careful on how you press, your temperature and things like that,
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.180]  you can actually blow this bag. And that's what a blowout means.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:35.180]  And whenever you do that, then you pretty much defeat the whole purpose of using the bag.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:41.180]  And so then you have your plant material into your oil and it's really hard to separate at that point.
[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:44.180]  So you definitely want to be careful on how you do it, which is why we double bag.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:49.180]  Because whenever you're pressing and you have the essential oils come out,
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.180]  well, it's the oil and it's slippery.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.180]  And so if you don't double bag and put two bags on each side,
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:59.180]  it will actually slide out or it may actually bust out.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.180]  So you don't ever want that to happen.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:07.180]  So if you put two bags around it, then it will avoid that from happening.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.180]  And to be honest with you guys, I mean, we can do this a little different.
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.180]  I mean, you guys got questions or anything like that, like totally feel free.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.180]  This is a speaking engagement.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.180]  Like I'm hanging out with Freedon's family cousins right now.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.180]  You want to talk, say something.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:26.180]  I mean, you got a question, you don't understand what's going on?
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.180]  Hey, let me know. Like, yeah, let's just have you guys come over here and ask the question.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180]  Absolutely.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.340]  I don't do many speaking engagements.
[01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:44.510]  Ethan has a question for you too.
[01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:49.510]  So do you normally break it up by hand before you press it?
[01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:53.510]  Yeah. Is that the preferred method when you press the platter?
[01:24:54.510 --> 01:25:00.510]  I do for me because I mean, breaking it up by hand compared to, what did you say, like a grinder?
[01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:02.510]  I've never done it.
[01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:06.510]  Oh, okay. Yeah. For me, breaking it up by hand because you do get to keep the integrity of your charcoal.
[01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:10.510]  So I'm going to break them all off again, especially using a grinder.
[01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:13.510]  So to keep it that way, I like to do it by hand.
[01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:22.510]  Because the whole point of this is to keep the integrity of the essentials in that charcoal.
[01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:27.510]  And so whenever we're pressing it out, one of the things we immediately do is get it cold.
[01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:31.510]  That way we can get that temperature right back down to be able to preserve those servings.
[01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:34.510]  All right.
[01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:36.510]  I have a question for you.
[01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:42.510]  So with you breaking it up by hand, what's the most that you've ever pressed at one time?
[01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:50.510]  Flour-wise, I actually have a really small press converter with some people who do have, but I am able to control a little bit more, I believe.
[01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:57.510]  I'd say maybe three or four ounces.
[01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:59.510]  I don't know. Three or four ounces.
[01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:01.510]  Not quite an ounce.
[01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:07.510]  Hash rosin, or sorry, the bubble hash press.
[01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:17.780]  I've pressed about 33 grams at once, and it was amazing to watch that.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.780]  Oh wow, okay.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.780]  Yeah. That was a blast.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.780]  Hey Danny, JCZ wants to know, what's the difference in the press he is using versus traditional press?
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.780]  Just air compressor?
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:33.780]  And what attempts do you press that flour versus bubble?
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.780]  Well, the biggest deal with the hand press is, like I say, you have more control with it.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:44.780]  So I'm able to feel the actual presser almost give as I'm pressing, especially with bubble hash.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:55.780]  So with other press, like with the hydraulic press, for me, when I used it, it was really hard for me to be able to control that pressure and the amount of pressure at the same time.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:27:04.780]  So when I did that, I was honestly trying to make what we call a TACA from the rosin, which is repressing the rosin.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.780]  And so when you do that, you're taking out the terpenes.
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:13.780]  So you have to be extremely careful with how much pressure that you're putting on that in order to squeeze out the TACA and the terpenes together.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.780]  So that was what my goal was.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:19.780]  And using that hydraulic press, I was not able to do it the way that I wanted to.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:23.780]  I was able to achieve it a couple of times, and it was nice, you know.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:29.780]  But when I got the hand press, I realized, OK, yeah, it's a good difference to be able to have that much control over your press.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:43.780]  Normally with a flower press, you won't see a whole lot of the squish like you normally do with a bubble hash press.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.780]  But all I'm doing here is putting this in parchment paper.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:56.780]  In the micro bag, in the flower, and simply heating pressure.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.780]  And we can smoke this in about three, four minutes.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.780]  Don't point the microphone at the chamber.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.340]  All right, cool. Anybody got any questions?
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:30.340]  What's going on right now? Yeah, go ahead.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:38.340]  Is there, do you change the temperature that you press at for the particular flower?
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:41.340]  Do you kind of press all the flowers at the same temperature?
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.340]  No, every strain is different.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.340]  So normally if you're pressing a lot of flower at once, you actually want to press just a little bit.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.340]  I'll take maybe a gram or two to work on that certain temperature and that pressure on how it's going to go.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:03.340]  A good starting point for me is somewhere around about 90 degrees Celsius.
[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.340]  Quick off the press, just to give me a test of seeing what the flower may give me.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:18.340]  So like he asked with the flower press, I was doing that anywhere between 180 degrees up to 200.
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:24.340]  Just depending on the flower, depending on the cure, depending on how fresh it is, things like that.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:31.340]  All of those matter. The humidity in the room, the temperature, the way it was grown, all of those become factors.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:38.340]  So whenever you're doing that, it is a lot easier to just take a small portion, test that, and go from there.
[01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:45.830]  Awesome, thank you. See, I told you guys, one way to do this without the help.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]  Anybody else got any questions?
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:58.580]  Yeah, they wanted to know again what tests, like are you doing different tests for different strains?
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:04.580]  Yes, you will, but in this situation right here, since I don't have a whole lot to be able to test with,
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:10.580]  it wouldn't be necessarily worth wasting the bag to be able to test one gram if I wanted to test, you know, press four or five.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:17.580]  But yes, you will. If I was pressing strictly just flower and I was pressing a lot of flower, definitely,
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:21.580]  you will test the temperatures and how fast and quick it comes off.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:28.580]  Like that is the most important part instead of going at it and not knowing exactly where you are
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:36.580]  and not having a clue about anything. Like I say, right now, I'll be able to start here.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:41.580]  But it's very possible the temperature may not be right and there's just no way to know unless you try.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:47.580]  I mean, there's no book out there that says, oh, okay, you got this strain, you know, you tested this temperature.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:58.220]  I wish. So it's kind of hard to press normally. I'm like sitting down looking at this, you know, the entire time.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.220]  So a little different.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:07.220]  Can you talk about the medicinal differences between here and Old Man and President Obama?
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:17.220]  So there's still a huge debate right now about what's going on with fresh frozen and cured flower.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.220]  It's pressing and making bubble hash and pressing flower.
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:28.220]  To me, in my opinion, I'm not a huge fan of fresh frozen at all.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.900]  There's a flower press here.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:55.900]  This one was the larger amount that I had just had.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.900]  We bought the flower. Yeah, it was yours. Yeah, that was yours there.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:13.620]  And then there was an ex-person that brought some smaller amount.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.620]  Is that yours? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.620]  And then we have this right there.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.620]  Oh, okay. Perfect.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:32.620]  So normally after a flower press like that, I immediately go to my cold plate to cool it back down and try to preserve those serpents.
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:37.620]  Actually, in doing that, it makes it easier to collect off the parchment paper as well.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:45.620]  So if you got a squishing at home and you can't get off the parchment paper, if you have a cold plate or a serpent tool, immediately get that cold.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:49.620]  You can collect it off a lot, lot better and get more blood.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.620]  Your return back. Instead of just sticking on the parchment paper, which I've had happen several times.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.620]  That's one good tip to be able to do that.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:12.960]  Do you have any tips for people who say they buy it and get the flower and they don't really have a gram of it to test?
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:18.960]  Do you think humidity is one of the biggest factors in how hot to press it?
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.960]  Oh, yeah, for sure. Humidity.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:26.960]  Because the thing is, when you're doing heat and pressure, as you increase pressure, you automatically increase heat.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.960]  So you're also adding the humidity in there as well.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:35.960]  You have to think about all those factors when it goes into pressing on the temperature.
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:40.960]  Because higher humidity means you should probably actually press at a lower temperature, would be my opinion.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.960]  So all of that would go into effect.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.960]  Right now, this room is extremely humid.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.960]  If I was pressing on a commercial level, I wouldn't be pressing these kinds of temperatures.
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.960]  You have to cool it off in this room. You have to get a dehumidifier.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.960]  It would take hours to get it down to where it was that you need it to be.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.960]  So all of those things go into effect whenever you're pressing, especially bubble hash and flowers as well.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.960]  And like you were saying about fresh frozen, here.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:23.960]  So with fresh frozen, if you're doing true fresh frozen, and if you are, in my opinion, doing straight fresh frozen, washed and off the press,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.960]  I mean, you would have to get that done, in my opinion, within 48 hours.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.960]  Which is extremely, I mean, you can do that. It's kind of hard to do, but you can't do that.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:37.960]  So you can cut it down, freeze it overnight, wash it, dry it, press it, all within 48 hours.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.960]  But, in my opinion, I am not a fan of it.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:47.960]  Actually, what we have to press with bubble hash today is some fresh frozen.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:52.960]  And in my opinion, I would think that you still need somewhat of a cure on your tripod.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:59.960]  I mean, just like everybody out there who's a grower, I don't, I mean, unless you were just that much into Russia, hurting that bad,
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.960]  you never went in there and cut a bullet off and just let it roll down the snow.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.960]  Let it dry, let it cure for a bit, and I mean, at least a few days, you know.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.960]  Same thing with this, I believe.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.960]  Doing the fresh frozen, I mean, that's cool, but in my opinion, it's kind of a fad.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.960]  Because as you allow those tripods to age just a little bit, it's just like five watts.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:27.960]  The more you allow it to age, and typically to a certain point of gentrification, you actually make those terpenes and those profiles come out a little bit better.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.960]  So, like I say, we pride ourselves on having high terpenes.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:43.960]  And in my flower, whenever we do it, we are drying for at least a couple of days in order to get that green taste, in my opinion, that chlorophyll taste out of the bollash.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:52.960]  And so I've seen, I've actually watched it go from the being cut down all the way through fresh frozen and being dried,
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.960]  you still have that green chlorophyll taste.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:02.960]  That, to me, is not the taste that gives the plant its essence, because any plant is going to have that essence grown, you know.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.960]  So, we'll take time to cure for a few days and then start our separation process.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:18.960]  And another thing you said earlier about nomaplasia, so when we're doing ice water hash, making bubble hash, we're not doing extraction.
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.960]  Extraction is just using a solvent of some type.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.960]  Like I said, we don't use any chemicals at all.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960]  So, what we're doing is a separation.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.960]  We are taking the trichrome head and separating it from the stem and collecting it.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.960]  We're not using any chemicals at all in order to be able to do this.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:42.960]  And we do this just to stay true to the plant, stay true to the terpenes that are in the plant.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.960]  And so, we don't have to take terpenes out and add them back in and anything like that.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  We like to keep it 100% true all the way.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.960]  And one of the reasons I say is because, just like water, water is H2O.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:03.960]  Well, if you split water and you have just hydrogen, or then you have a bomb, and that becomes extremely dangerous.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.960]  If you have oxygen and straighten, oxygen becomes poisonous.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.960]  However, if you put it together and keep it together, then you have water.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.960]  That's what everybody needs in order to live.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.960]  So, we're looking at the same way with our terpenes.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  We like to keep our terpenes together and not strip them away and add them back in or do anything like that.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.960]  We just want to keep it the way that it is.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  It's extremely hard to do.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.960]  It's not necessarily the most profitable.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960]  The yields are not always, always there.
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.960]  And sometimes you may have a bad day and have a bad go out.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:44.960]  And my opinion, in our opinion, with our company, is this is the cleanest way to consume the cannabis doing it this way.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.960]  We get rid of, the way I explain it to people is like taking an apple tree.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.960]  I will take an apple tree and I'll get rid of the stems.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.960]  I'll get rid of the leaves.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:57.960]  I'll get rid of the roots, the dirt, the algae that's on it.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960]  I'll get rid of everything.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  I'll get rid of the apples.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.960]  I'll get rid of the seeds.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:02.960]  I'll get rid of the juice.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  And so I'll take that entire tree and I'll give you the juice.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.960]  And essentially that's what I'm doing here with the cannabis.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.960]  I'm taking the entire cannabis plant, pressing out the essentials and giving you the juice.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  And that juice will mature, like you said, in a safe way in order for you to heal yourself.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.960]  And so, like I said, it ain't always the most profitable.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.960]  Sometimes some strains yield a lot more than others, stuff like that.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:34.960]  Reaching the high terpenes, we have found that a lot of our patients are really, really now starting to understand the benefits of terpenes
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.960]  and understand that that is where the medicine is.
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:38.960]  Every strain has THC in it.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:39.960]  It may have a lot of THC.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960]  It may not have a whole lot of THC.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960]  But the terpene profiles where it's at.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960]  And that's what's different.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.960]  And so I had a buddy of mine, Squeezer Palace on Instagram, shout out to him.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:52.960]  He told me one day it was like the steering wheel.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.960]  If you have the THC, your THC is the car.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960]  The terpene is where your steering wheel.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  They're going to tell you which direction you're going to go, what kind of high you're going to get.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.960]  You're going to get the calcified, you're going to get the up, you know, the steeper.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.960]  Either way, that is what's coming from your terpenes.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.960]  And so we pride ourselves on keeping those terpenes.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:16.960]  So with our strains, our lowest right now we have is the Divine Berry strain from Mid-Austin X that we grew.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:23.960]  And it had about 6.7% terpenes, which is decent terpenes, and it was okay.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.960]  Wonderful smell.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.960]  The smell, I don't know if you guys are here, I mean, totally go right there and try it out.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:29.960]  Like it's super gassy.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  It smells amazing.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.960]  But 6.7% wasn't good enough for me.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.960]  So I was like, ah, I think we can do better.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.960]  So I had another strain on Black Cherry Punch.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.960]  And we changed a few methods the way we were doing things.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.960]  Waters, the temperatures in the room, pay attention to the humidity, things like that.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.960]  Try to be able to get those terpenes a little bit higher.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  So we grew a strain, Black Cherry Punch, and again, everything is organic.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:40:00.960]  And we washed and pressed it, and we hit 11.11% terpenes.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  And so I was like, okay, hey, we can do something, all right?
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.960]  So that ain't good enough.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  We can correct that.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.960]  So 11.11%, that's good.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  I'm sorry, can you speak specifically to leaving or excluding the 45-U bag?
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.960]  Can you repeat the question?
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  Oh, yeah, I definitely will.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.960]  So he asked about getting rid of the 45 bag.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.960]  So when you look at a micron head under a microscope, we can measure it,
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  and most of your micron heads will land about in the 90 micron bag.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:39.960]  And so that's the actual size or around the size of most of the normal,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.960]  mature trichome heads.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.960]  And so whenever you're sifting through bubble bags like that,
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.960]  every 220 was just what you collect in your plant material, your 190,
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:54.960]  your, you know, all the way down to 160, 170, 390 bag all the way down.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  So 45 is actually where you will possibly catch more trichome,
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.960]  more stems, depending on what your flower looks like.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:10.960]  So whenever we're able to harvest and have the growing and processing together,
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:13.960]  we can actually take time with a microscope and go out there and look at
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.960]  the trichome heads and be able to have a good idea about where they should land.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.960]  And so doing that, I can tell if the stems are long, if it's really lengthy,
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.960]  how big the heads are, how much agitation I should be looking at to be able
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.960]  to separate those trichomes.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.960]  I can get an idea of possibly how many times I may have to wash that.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  So a lot of that goes into when you're figuring out which bag to throw away
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.960]  because sometimes 45-5 bag can have some good stuff in it.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:47.960]  And keeping that 45 bag, and I've done this and tested it to see,
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:50.960]  can actually have a lot of good medicinal benefits in there.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:54.960]  Now, your 25 bag, which is your lower, your very bottom bag,
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.960]  is going to have most of your food grain, what we call,
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960]  and what should be most of your stems.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.960]  Which means the stems, they are still kind of have those in there,
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:04.960]  just most of them are in the trichome.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.960]  So whenever you're sitting through your bags and stuff like that,
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.960]  being able to have that control, having a microscope,
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:16.960]  being able to go out and look, can actually give you a really great idea
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:19.960]  of when to get rid of that, what bag to actually get rid of.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.960]  Anybody else have a question?
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:28.960]  Yeah, sure. We'll do another one.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.680]  This one is yours.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:41.680]  Yeah, we can set you up on the email and you can actually try it.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.680]  We've got the stuff out there.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.680]  So who's got the next bag?
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.680]  What's your name here?
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:53.680]  This one's yours, right?
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.680]  Cannon.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:55.680]  Cannon?
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.680]  What strain is this?
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.680]  That is King Sherd.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.680]  King Sherd?
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]  Sherd.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]  Sherd? Okay.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  Most of that's the grain.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.680]  That's actually probably...
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:12.190]  This is from O'Kane.
[01:43:13.190 --> 01:43:16.190]  Someone goes special.
[01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:19.190]  I actually want to turn it up a little bit.
[01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:22.190]  What?
[01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:25.190]  I want to turn it up a little bit.
[01:43:25.190 --> 01:43:27.190]  Okay.
[01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:37.190]  We'll do it.
[01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:40.190]  Okay, yeah.
[01:43:40.190 --> 01:44:04.190]  This is where I'm going to put the small cups over here.
[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:07.190]  I didn't get a dab on camera.
[01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:09.190]  No.
[01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:10.190]  Dave Dankers?
[01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:11.190]  That's who it is?
[01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:12.190]  Okay, cool.
[01:44:12.190 --> 01:44:30.170]  Let me get you guys to work.
[01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.170]  Do you have a specific...
[01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:35.170]  Can you grow the flowers?
[01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:37.170]  Yes, I grow all the flowers.
[01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:44.170]  Do you have a specific cure that you like to do for it?
[01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:45.170]  A specific cure?
[01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:46.170]  Yeah.
[01:44:46.170 --> 01:44:53.170]  Again, being able to have that grow and process from there makes it so I can control a lot of that.
[01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:57.170]  And so...
[01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:01.170]  I'm able to look at the trichomes and see how they're doing.
[01:45:01.170 --> 01:45:05.170]  Normally, for me personally, I will go about a three-day market.
[01:45:05.170 --> 01:45:09.170]  So, in about a three-day market, I'll look at trichomes and see what's going on.
[01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:13.170]  So, anywhere between two or three days of actually being cut and hung up,
[01:45:13.170 --> 01:45:19.170]  would happen that little small pot here will greatly increase the yield of that thing
[01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:22.170]  and still be able to preserve those terpenes and that taste.
[01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:29.170]  So, like I said earlier, I honestly think the fresh frozen deal is almost as bad
[01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:34.170]  because I've seen the fresh frozen, I've done fresh frozen, and I've done a small cure like that.
[01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:39.170]  My yield has increased, the taste has increased, the terpenes have increased, just in those three days.
[01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:44.170]  So, me personally, I'm not really understanding the whole point of fresh frozen other than saying that it's fresh frozen
[01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:48.170]  because if you're looking for the medicinal effects of it, that cure is extremely important.
[01:45:49.170 --> 01:45:53.170]  So, even a three, four day cure on that thing definitely makes a difference.
[01:45:57.170 --> 01:45:59.170]  Are you trying to get down?
[01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:02.170]  Spotlight's on you now, buddy.
[01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:10.170]  Brandon, I would like to know what you're smoking on right now.
[01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:15.170]  Wesley Crusher. I think it's Do-Si-Do times.
[01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:20.170]  That smells amazing.
[01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:32.170]  Okay, we'll press.
[01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:40.170]  Hey, Jer, is it, once you press, is it something you look for on the part set or do you just take what you got?
[01:46:41.170 --> 01:46:46.170]  In a sense, after you press that, I mean, take what you got.
[01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:48.170]  I mean, it is what you got.
[01:46:48.170 --> 01:46:52.170]  Can you tell from looking at it, if it's a good quality press or is it?
[01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:58.170]  Yeah, yields, for one thing, will definitely tell if you got a better press on that.
[01:46:58.170 --> 01:47:02.170]  Sometimes you can have totally different consistencies straight off the press.
[01:47:02.170 --> 01:47:07.170]  You can have something that will give you a butter like consistency, you know, while it's still coming off the press.
[01:47:08.170 --> 01:47:15.170]  I've noticed these mercery strings like that are really high THC-like, that they are burning up that quick.
[01:47:15.170 --> 01:47:24.170]  So, during my process, I've learned that if it's, the faster it takes for it to cure and get that butter consistency, the higher THC it's going to have.
[01:47:24.170 --> 01:47:26.170]  I mean, sorry, the higher THC it's going to have.
[01:47:26.170 --> 01:47:34.170]  Now, the longer it takes in a cold cure for it to actually cure and separate and you get that turquoise on there, then it will have higher THC.
[01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:46.170]  And so, doing things like making softness diamonds and stuff like that, that becomes extremely important because if it has a higher amount of THC in it, it's going to dissolve that THC in it and it's going to be extremely hard to get a good yield out of it.
[01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:53.170]  So, definitely looking at that press after you get it off, depending on what you plan on doing after that next, will definitely depend.
[01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:55.170]  So, does that steer you into what you're going to do with it?
[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:56.170]  Most of the time it does.
[01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:59.170]  I mean, you can still be able to get that, those different products.
[01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:04.170]  We can make just a hash browns on there or we can go and even make browns and bakes.
[01:48:04.170 --> 01:48:12.170]  And so, looking at that, I will be able to tell if I want to steer towards just doing a cold cure or do a jar tag and maybe try to get it.
[01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:15.170]  Because if you were going to do it, you'd probably burn it too.
[01:48:15.170 --> 01:48:17.170]  That's right.
[01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:19.170]  Yeah, I'll just ask a few questions.
[01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:24.170]  And then sometimes you see where it looks almost watery when it's in the jar.
[01:48:24.170 --> 01:48:27.170]  Do you know what kind of makes it more wet?
[01:48:27.170 --> 01:48:30.170]  Yeah, that is the terpene content in there.
[01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:34.170]  So, if you're looking at it, it has like a shiny look to it.
[01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:36.170]  And like you say, it looks like it's wet.
[01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:42.170]  There's usually a higher terpene content in it compared to some that will look almost chalky.
[01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:44.170]  Like it looks dry.
[01:48:44.170 --> 01:48:48.170]  Those will have a lower terpene content from what I've seen.
[01:48:48.170 --> 01:48:50.170]  I may not have all the facts right.
[01:48:50.170 --> 01:48:51.170]  But in general, yeah.
[01:48:51.170 --> 01:49:03.170]  So, like even with my shrimps there, our lowest one is a 6.7, and it looks kind of like a chalky consistency compared to the other ones that are like super juicy looking and stuff like that.
[01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:09.170]  But, I mean, I was able to actually make a rotten bait out of the chalky consistency as well.
[01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:13.170]  So, normally, if you were doing something like that, you would be higher terpene.
[01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:15.170]  All right. Thank you.
[01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:18.170]  Any questions?
[01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:20.170]  Okay, so we're going to go into this push real quick.
[01:49:20.170 --> 01:49:22.170]  And then we're going to go ahead and press the bow eyes.
[01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:37.700]  That's the color part.
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:48.700]  So, I did notice with the last press a couple of things that I look for is like the hue, the color, and stuff like that.
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.700]  That was more of a sheer flower.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:54.700]  So, therefore, we got somewhat of a darker color.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:50:01.700]  But with the yellow being quite as low as it was, I thought it could have been a little bit more, so I raised the temperature on that.
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:11.700]  And I think that was just a generalization just from it being humid in this room and not being quite as cold.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:15.700]  How do you feel the humidity difference in the room can affect that?
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:22.700]  If it's 80% humidity in here, close to 20%, how does that change?
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.700]  Sorry, I didn't hear the last part you said. I almost got it.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:29.700]  How does the humidity difference change what you do?
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:34.700]  Like, if it's humid, are you pressing hotter or are you pressing lower?
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:39.700]  Yeah, if it's humid, to me, I'm going to ‑‑ if it's humid, I'm trying not to press if it's humid at all.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:44.700]  If I have to press if it's humid, I'd rather just wait until it's a different day.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:51.700]  Days like, especially where I am, I'm in a building, yes, it's controlled, but it still matters on what's going on outside.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:56.700]  So if it rained last week and it's still wet outside, that means it's still humid outside.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.700]  So I don't try to press on it at all.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:05.700]  But if I am having to press, I will increase my temperature somewhat on my higher humidity.
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:13.920]  Do you have any idea why that is?
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.920]  Just from my experience, doing it that way.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.920]  I've pressed on days where, first to God, I wouldn't press.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:27.920]  And it would be in a little bit too warm or too humid, decrease those yields.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:33.920]  And so I noticed on that day when I did increase my temperature, I was able to get better yields.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.920]  But still, it would have been better just to wait.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.920]  But that's just from my experience with pressing.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:44.920]  I don't have a hundred percent logic.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:47.920]  Like, okay, I know for a fact that this is the way to do it.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:48.920]  It's just from my experience.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:51.920]  I mean, I know that, like I say, from the very beginning, trial and error.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.920]  Like, when I did it this way, it didn't quite work.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.920]  When I increased my temperature, it tends to work this way.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:02.920]  And I'm sure on some of those days, there's probably, it might be a scientific reason on why it worked that time or why it may work.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:09.920]  But, I mean, just from my experience of trying it over and over and over, that's what it is that I feel like it works the best way.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:12.920]  If I have to press in those conditions.
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:23.740]  I wish we had a scale so we could get a percentage of yield on there.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:27.740]  But this actually came out really nice and really, really, really pretty color.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:32.010]  This one was yours.
[01:52:32.010 --> 01:52:33.010]  What strain did you say it was?
[01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:34.010]  King's Shirt.
[01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:35.010]  King's Shirt.
[01:52:35.010 --> 01:52:36.010]  Okay, here you go, bro.
[01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:38.010]  This is all you, man.
[01:52:38.010 --> 01:52:43.010]  And like that was, again, simply heat and pressure, pressing up those essentials.
[01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:47.010]  And, I mean, you see there's no chemicals or anything like that.
[01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:49.010]  We still have the flour.
[01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:50.010]  It's right here.
[01:52:50.010 --> 01:52:51.010]  Just simply press.
[01:52:51.010 --> 01:53:01.010]  And so, actually, you can actually take this and if you wanted to infuse some butter or tea or anything like that, you can totally use this.
[01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:07.010]  And actually, we do use some of that in our topicals whenever we press, especially when we're making donuts and things like that.
[01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:12.010]  We will use our rosin bag chip bags in order to make our topical.
[01:53:12.010 --> 01:53:15.010]  Does anybody in the room have a scale?
[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:18.010]  The viewers would like it to be weighed out.
[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:20.010]  Anybody have a scale in here?
[01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:24.010]  Now, it's more the viewers are skeptical that there's not a scale in that room full of...
[01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:26.010]  It's all right.
[01:53:26.010 --> 01:53:31.010]  The way this was set up, everything is provided.
[01:53:39.870 --> 01:53:41.870]  We got a question for you, Danny.
[01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:43.870]  Yeah, what's up?
[01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:48.870]  So, where are you from out of state?
[01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:52.870]  Most everybody here, it seems like it's from Oklahoma, Louisiana.
[01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:54.870]  Two weeks ago, this legalized flour.
[01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:59.870]  So, this isn't something that's readily available in dispensaries.
[01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:04.870]  And the one dispensary that we have in town doesn't offer this.
[01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:11.870]  So, where you have people that are in the community that are willing to try this type of medication,
[01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:18.870]  how would you recommend it where we have those super humid days where they want to buy off the Gulf Coast?
[01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:21.870]  Did you guys do half flour there?
[01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:23.870]  It was just legalized two weeks ago.
[01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:24.870]  Oh, okay.
[01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:26.870]  August 1st, it will be in a dispensary.
[01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:28.870]  August 1st, it will be in our dispensary.
[01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:30.870]  Oh, okay, nice. Congratulations.
[01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:31.870]  Thank you.
[01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:47.780]  So, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:51.780]  When I started dressing, there's a place here called Harbor Break.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:53.780]  I actually had 10-ton brass.
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:54.780]  I had heat plates.
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:56.780]  You've got glasses, so you know what I'm talking about.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.780]  I had those heat plates.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:01.780]  I had my heat plates in a small convection oven.
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.780]  And I would let them get hot, and I had a thermometer.
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:09.780]  I would sit with them with a laser thermometer, and right until they got to their temperature, okay, cool, we got it for brass.
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:14.780]  And we only got about 45 seconds, which could have probably been too cold.
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:17.780]  But, I mean, that's what I had to start with.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:24.780]  And that's actually what it was that really, really got me into learning, okay, okay, if I can do this much,
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.780]  and I can get back the yield off of this, and I'm throwing it in the oven and messing it out this way on a 10-ton brass that came from Harbor Break,
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.780]  okay, cool, let's upgrade and see how far we can go on this.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.780]  So that's what it is that I did.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:41.780]  But I have seen people use things like hair straighteners.
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:47.780]  I've never used a hair straightener, so I couldn't give me any advice on that.
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:48.780]  Iron, yeah, I've seen people use iron.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:52.780]  The biggest deal is getting that pressure.
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:57.780]  Being able to get that heat, that's totally fine, but being able to get that pressure is where the hard part is.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:02.780]  So using that 10-ton press, having the heated plates, I was able to somewhat get it.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:07.780]  So pretty much the same thing with this is on the Rotem plates, it's a heat-heated press here.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:11.780]  And this controller here actually keeps it there.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:17.780]  And so that way I don't have fluctuations in one, the top one being harder than the other one, something like that,
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:20.780]  which will definitely change the yield, change the ways it's coming off the press.
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:25.780]  So that was one of the main things about this is keeping that temperature there.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:29.780]  That's what it needs to be on there without any fluctuations.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:40.780]  But to answer your question, I mean, I honestly couldn't give any more suggestions other than, I mean, how we started this.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:48.780]  With a hair straightener or maybe iron or if you wanted to get somebody to engineer you something down there.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:53.780]  Or if you got the money, just go ahead and get you a press.
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:58.780]  Because the deal is, I mean, in order for you to get the other press, you're going to have to get a press and you're going to have to do it.
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:03.780]  I mean, I can give you all the tips that you want to give and then you can pay me to teach you all the tips that you want me to teach you.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:07.780]  But if you don't got a thing to do yourself, it's not going to be any good.
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.780]  You can read every book you want to read.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.780]  If you don't go and do it yourself, it's not going to help you.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:15.780]  So it's just kind of depending on how far you want to go.
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:28.780]  There's not really any budget-wise ways to be able to do rosin, especially on this consistency, to be able to get it like that.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:30.780]  That I've found.
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:34.780]  You are able to press out using that program and stuff like that.
[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.780]  You'll be able to get essentials.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:40.780]  And that is all good and great, but you won't get the yields and stuff like that.
[01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:49.780]  In a sense, you don't necessarily waste it, but you don't get the full benefit that you would if you actually have a decent press.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:53.780]  And it doesn't mean you have to go out and spend $1,000 on a press, you know what I mean?
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:58:02.780]  Something small will definitely make it more efficient and better for you, especially if you're pressing flour that's new to that area down there.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:07.780]  And as you see, most of the people here, I believe, are organic.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:17.780]  And if you're down there and your flour is new, I would totally push for a grower to be organic and try to keep it that way.
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:21.780]  Because that is extremely important in my opinion.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:30.780]  So I definitely think that with that being a mistake like that, you guys can start learning from other people's mistakes and just get down to doing it.
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:33.780]  And do it the right way.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:36.780]  That could be awesome for you guys.
[01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:43.530]  Yeah, we got a question here for you, Dan.
[01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:44.530]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:49.530]  One thing I was kind of curious about when you talk about using certain pressures and temperatures for getting certain amounts of yield.
[01:58:49.530 --> 01:58:55.530]  Have you ever actually tried doing that inside of a vacuum chamber to see if maybe that might increase yields?
[01:58:55.530 --> 01:58:59.530]  No, I've never tried to press this out of a vacuum chamber.
[01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:05.530]  I'm running a lot of data through my head.
[01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:11.530]  I mean, possibly that would increase the yields.
[01:59:11.530 --> 01:59:19.530]  But it's not necessarily the pressure of just getting it off the plate.
[01:59:19.530 --> 01:59:26.530]  Because I know there's another brand, they have one that will actually kind of drop off the plate like that.
[01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:32.530]  So it's not necessarily being in a vacuum that's going to help increase yields or whatever.
[01:59:32.530 --> 01:59:35.530]  It's more that's what you're starting with.
[01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:37.530]  What you're starting with is heating the brain.
[01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:38.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:41.530]  So I mean, I totally understand what you mean about that.
[01:59:41.530 --> 01:59:44.530]  But yeah, in a vacuum, you probably wouldn't do too much.
[01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:54.530]  There's a couple of ideas that I've been throwing around about better separation techniques, ionization is one of them.
[01:59:55.530 --> 02:00:00.530]  Because we know that trichomes have a positive and negative charge.
[02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:04.530]  And so we're using things like that to be able to do a better separation.
[02:00:04.530 --> 02:00:10.530]  I'm actually experimenting with some things like that to see if we can get a better increase.
[02:00:10.530 --> 02:00:19.530]  Because one thing about this is the yields are low, considerably low compared to other methods of extraction.
[02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:32.530]  And so whenever you're trying to do this in this industry, in the new market with people who are uneducated, and it's not even their fault that they're uneducated, it's just that it's new.
[02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:36.530]  It makes doing this job extremely, extremely difficult.
[02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:47.530]  Because not only am I doing all the work that everybody else is doing, I'm actually taking less of a yield and I'm having to push a more expensive product out there.
[02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:53.530]  And so pushing that more expensive product out there, the only way for me to be able to win is by educating everybody.
[02:00:53.530 --> 02:01:02.530]  And educating everybody like that means doing events like this, answering questions like this, future cannabis, going to dispensaries, going to pop-ups, doing 30 days.
[02:01:02.530 --> 02:01:04.530]  I'm tired, y'all.
[02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:12.530]  I am tired. I got three hours of sleep last night and that's probably an hour more than normal.
[02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:14.530]  So hey, we're doing good. You know what I mean?
[02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:18.530]  So this industry has been, I see y'all raising your hands back there, you know what I mean?
[02:01:18.530 --> 02:01:21.530]  Yes, it's extremely hard out there right now.
[02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:25.530]  Especially in Oklahoma, I mean, it's so easy for anybody to get a license.
[02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:27.530]  So therefore, you have a lot of big, big competition.
[02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:34.530]  So if you're not bringing in the best of the best, you may just be a little blip and they're moving on.
[02:01:34.530 --> 02:01:45.530]  So that's one reason why I'm trying to educate people, trying to get people to understand the benefits of the terpenes, the benefits of being organic and staying away from chemicals.
[02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:53.530]  If it's possible, if you want to, if that's what you want to do, I at least want to give you the ability to know that there's another option.
[02:01:53.530 --> 02:02:07.530]  And so if I give you an option to know that, hey, there are growers out there who are growing organic, who are making salt on this concentrates, who are trying their best to give it pure medicine out there, it is possible for you to get that.
[02:02:07.530 --> 02:02:11.530]  So I take a lot of time, a lot of pride to be able to do it this way.
[02:02:11.530 --> 02:02:16.530]  And I can say, we ain't bothering, we ain't bothering at all.
[02:02:16.530 --> 02:02:19.530]  But I mean, we are getting the medicine out there.
[02:02:20.530 --> 02:02:30.530]  And this right here, being able to teach people, talk to people a lot, ask a question like this, like, you can keep your money as long as you are learning something and get out there and actually try.
[02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:33.530]  That's all I want you to be able to do is get out there and actually try.
[02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:45.530]  Look at yourself, see if you like it, see if it works for you, look for the terpenes that you like, find those different strains that you like to be able to help you and do it yourself for whatever it is that you may be able to learn to be going to.
[02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:51.530]  We got a question. This is more of a comment from hanging out. Shout out to Sticky Mom, shout out to Hide the Hippie.
[02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:55.530]  Those dudes laced me up with quality stuff for the road trip here.
[02:02:55.530 --> 02:03:02.530]  But I know that he wanted to get deeper into with you and also with Arlie here in a little bit about static tech.
[02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:08.530]  And maybe we could dive deeper into that because there are a few people that are liking that, but the yields just aren't there.
[02:03:08.530 --> 02:03:14.530]  So maybe not everybody in this room even knows what static tech is, because I know it's still kind of a new thing, even in Colorado.
[02:03:14.530 --> 02:03:38.530]  Yeah, it is. Static tech is actually using the fact that the polarized charcoal, the charcoal is polarized, using basically a paint roller and parchment paper to be able to apply a static charge to parchment paper and run it across, which is normally draw sip and be able to separate the charcoal heads from the stems to be able to get a cleaner product.
[02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:50.530]  So when people have Keith and stuff like that or our draw sip, which is normally come from the bottom of a container from trim, it's stems and heads and everything in there.
[02:03:50.530 --> 02:03:57.530]  So there are techniques to be able to separate those. I mean, you're talking about something that looks like sand and you're trying to separate sand.
[02:03:58.530 --> 02:04:09.530]  And so using static tech, you're able to separate those charcoal heads and stems and still be able to press that and be able to get an amazing medicinal product out of that.
[02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:13.530]  We got another question for you, Dan, and you're a high demand right now.
[02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:16.530]  Where'd that blunt go?
[02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:22.530]  Do you have any tips for working with a hard, like a runny material?
[02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:24.530]  Like a final product?
[02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:25.530]  Working with what again?
[02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:28.530]  Like a runny material that's like not sticky.
[02:04:28.530 --> 02:04:30.530]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:32.530]  I don't know the word to put on that.
[02:04:32.530 --> 02:04:37.530]  Yeah, I know what you mean. Like a material that's too viscous. So it's too runny, like you mean.
[02:04:38.530 --> 02:04:46.530]  Normally products like that are higher in terpenes, but that also can be very dependent on how you get the press.
[02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:57.530]  So if you did the press and it may have been hot or maybe you didn't get off the press in time and it was too warm, that can cause that kind of consistency.
[02:04:57.530 --> 02:05:00.530]  You can also go really hot sometimes and get a shot of consistency.
[02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:06.530]  But where you're talking about this runny, it's probably dependent upon that press is what I would guess.
[02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:09.530]  And so if you do have anything like that, keep it cold.
[02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:12.530]  Keep it cold temperatures like that will help.
[02:05:12.530 --> 02:05:15.530]  Immediately go into the freezer.
[02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:20.530]  And before even if you can't collect it right then, go immediately to the freezer will help with collection processes.
[02:05:20.530 --> 02:05:25.530]  And then you can get it into a jar or whatever will help out a whole lot.
[02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:28.530]  But basically what you can do on that is just keep it cold.
[02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:35.530]  They want to know do you have any hazes back there?
[02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:42.530]  I actually didn't bring my blueberries and my other ones.
[02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:43.530]  So not right now.
[02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:44.530]  We don't.
[02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:45.530]  All right.
[02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:46.530]  Andrew, a sense of memory.
[02:05:46.530 --> 02:05:47.530]  No.
[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:48.530]  So shut up.
[02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:50.530]  OK, that's not right now.
[02:05:50.530 --> 02:05:52.530]  We got some fire hash back there, bro.
[02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:56.530]  So if you're here, man, I really wish I could try that.
[02:05:56.530 --> 02:05:59.530]  OK, so we're going to try to do this real quick.
[02:05:59.530 --> 02:06:02.530]  So this right here is a boba hash we did.
[02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:06.530]  We actually washed this a while ago.
[02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:09.530]  A week or so ago we were getting prepared for this.
[02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:11.530]  We figured we were going to press the boba hash.
[02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:14.530]  So we actually got this ready and put it in the freezer.
[02:06:14.530 --> 02:06:21.530]  So here, like a few minutes ago, I actually put this in a 25-micron bag and we double bagged it.
[02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:27.530]  And we don't have a scale right now, so I can't tell you exactly what the weight of it is to be able to get our yields.
[02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:31.530]  But this is more to show you guys the process.
[02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:44.920]  This being strictly boba hash put into a bag and applied heat and pressure.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:48.920]  OK, so anybody got any questions while I get this all off in there?
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.920]  It's kind of hard to do both at the same time.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:07:07.690]  I think a lot of people want to pick your bag.
[02:07:07.690 --> 02:07:10.690]  We got Marley here since Danny's setting some things up.
[02:07:10.690 --> 02:07:17.690]  He wanted to kind of give the audience, for you guys, more information about static tech.
[02:07:17.690 --> 02:07:27.690]  I was just going to say one of the original resources on static tech came from, I believe the YouTube channel is D420K.
[02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:32.690]  He was a frequenter on HashChurch.
[02:07:32.690 --> 02:07:40.690]  And D420K and Dr. Apollo, they're all excellent resources.
[02:07:40.690 --> 02:07:45.690]  So static tech, I wonder what yours is like.
[02:07:45.690 --> 02:07:46.690]  Appreciate that.
[02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:53.690]  And Marley's going to be up next after our little break there with DJ Mark.
[02:07:53.690 --> 02:07:57.690]  Yeah, I haven't looked a whole lot into static tech.
[02:07:57.690 --> 02:08:02.690]  Like I say, I started doing this like three years ago.
[02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:05.690]  I've actually bred my own strain.
[02:08:05.690 --> 02:08:11.690]  White blueberries, I took a white little male and a huckleberry female.
[02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:15.690]  I bred those together and did a small little female hunt.
[02:08:15.690 --> 02:08:16.690]  I mean, I didn't know about you.
[02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:21.690]  It was like 27 plants I did a small little female hunt with.
[02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:25.690]  And I got one that came out really, really, really nice.
[02:08:25.690 --> 02:08:30.690]  And so I grew it indoors, outdoors, and in a greenhouse.
[02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:38.690]  And I ended up washing and pressing the last greenhouse and hit 13.6% terpenes.
[02:08:39.690 --> 02:08:44.690]  So for a strain, I don't know if you guys can see that,
[02:08:44.690 --> 02:08:45.690]  but I'm going to press it now.
[02:08:45.690 --> 02:08:55.050]  Everybody's coming up quick.
[02:08:55.050 --> 02:08:59.050]  Now, the reason you're able to achieve that, especially with the amount
[02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:03.050]  and the color and everything, also comes down to basically, again, that canvas.
[02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:08.050]  So you have to have a quality product to be able to squish anything of quality.
[02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:09.050]  Fire in, fire out.
[02:09:09.050 --> 02:09:14.050]  And anybody that are pressing, I'll just let you know I'm still at zero on my pressure right now.
[02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:16.050]  I'm not even registering on the press.
[02:09:16.050 --> 02:09:19.050]  What temperature is it right now?
[02:09:19.050 --> 02:09:22.050]  Right now, we are super hot.
[02:09:22.050 --> 02:09:24.050]  We're going up quick.
[02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:28.050]  I believe it's right now at 89, 86 on some of this.
[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:34.050]  Yeah, so it's not super, super hot, but a little warmer than what I would normally press to start with.
[02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:40.050]  I pressed this earlier, and I actually went really low.
[02:09:40.050 --> 02:09:43.050]  It's 78 degrees Celsius, and I didn't like the return on it,
[02:09:43.050 --> 02:09:46.050]  and I didn't like the way it actually came off the press.
[02:09:46.050 --> 02:09:53.920]  So I actually went higher, pressed a little bit faster.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:59.920]  If anybody wants to jump up there and dab that, the viewers would love to see that right now.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.920]  Does everybody want to be on TV?
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:07.920]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:14.920]  You've got the email right there, and everything's in shot.
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.920]  To be honest with you, I feel like I just had a bar, and I offered everybody a shot, and nobody said nope.
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:31.920]  See?
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  Yeah.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.920]  Just let me know when it's my turn.
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.920]  This temp is firing.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:47.920]  Yes.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  That's good.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.920]  Now, I've always felt like if I'm taking a dab, if I can blow it through the nose without hacking my lungs up or something like that,
[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:03.920]  or really feeling it in the face, that to me is quality.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:05.920]  So you guys can usually kind of tell this.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:10.920]  I love going to other events and seeing people dab and hack their lungs up and stuff like that,
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:17.920]  or other people who can easily tell that they have quality in another part of the room, and nobody's really coughing or choking.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:20.920]  And again, that comes down to the quality in and quality out.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:39.240]  So are you happy with that press?
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:41.240]  Oh, yeah. That press came out nice.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.240]  And that was a great deal on that press.
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:52.240]  So to even do that, Terry, how long did that take you from start to finish?
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.240]  You're talking about even your example of phenohunting.
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.240]  Sometimes that's almost like a year-long thing to do.
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:11:59.240]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.240]  The phenohunting, that was, again, that was one of those deals where I started, I was like, oh, yeah.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:08.240]  The original reason was I have Crohn's disease.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:16.240]  And so I, for the better part of four years, woke up every morning in pain.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:19.240]  And sometimes it would wake me up out of my sleep.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:21.240]  I'd wake up out of my sleep in tears.
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:24.240]  And still even now sometimes it still happens.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:27.240]  And I tried all the medicines.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:28.240]  I went to the doctor.
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:36.240]  I spent all the medicine, that means all the money that the doctor is trying to do this, and then the scopies, and the tubes up your butt, and the tubes down your throat, everything like that, man.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:37.240]  And nothing worked.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:39.240]  And tried this medicine, didn't work.
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:41.240]  Tried this medicine, kind of worked.
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:42.240]  Didn't quit working.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.240]  So I started smoking a lot more.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:47.240]  And that's the only thing that helps.
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:55.240]  And the last time that I went to the doctor, she asked me, you know, what is it that you do because everything we give you has not helped you.
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:56.240]  And I told her I smoked.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:59.240]  And this was like eight, nine years ago.
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:03.240]  And she was like, okay, well, I can't give you a prescription for that.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:06.240]  She was like, but if that's what helps, then keep doing it.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.240]  So you don't have to tell me that.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.240]  And from that point on, it was okay to medicate in cannabis.
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:20.240]  And so my purpose on curating the white blueberry strain was to actually help you with your Crohn's disease.
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:24.240]  And so growing that strain, we hit those numbers on the high terpanes.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:29.240]  It actually did help out quite a bit with terpene with the Crohn's disease.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:35.240]  But I actually found out it worked out a hell of a lot better as a topical.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:42.240]  And so we make, again, a softness topical using our white blueberry strain.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:44.240]  And it works.
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.240]  I mean, there's not a person out here yet that says that it doesn't work.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:54.240]  It is. We're using a coconut oil as a carrier, using a bubble hash, using that flour.
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:58.240]  And we are making our topical.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.240]  Uh-oh, they're calling out.
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:01.240]  Got to finish it.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:05.240]  There you go.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.240]  Yeah, so we use our white blueberries also as well as our topical.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:12.240]  We found out that it helps out a whole lot with inflammation.
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:18.240]  So when Amy was talking about inflammation earlier, being a cause of a lot of problems, it definitely is.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  Inflammation causes a lot of your pain.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:26.240]  And so being a topical, that actually really helps with the inflammation.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.240]  It's able to decrease pain in a lot of patients.
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:33.240]  Rubbing on the shoulders, back, headaches, things like that, even stomachaches.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.240]  People are using topical, and it does actually work.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:43.240]  So that strain that I actually started out to make for Crohn's disease actually turned out to be a really great topical.
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:45.240]  That just ended up how it worked.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:49.240]  We actually won second place at the Cowboy Cup with that topical.
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:54.240]  So I said I would go, didn't quite reach that goal, but I made another one.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:57.240]  And that's just literally how this entire journey began.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.240]  It was trying this, nope, that don't work, trying this, nope, that don't work, trying this, I didn't, shit, that worked.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:07.240]  All right, you know, so that's been this entire journey.
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:11.240]  You got a question for you?
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:18.240]  Do you feel like over-freeze drying has an effect on your final product's taste?
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.240]  Oh, definitely, yeah.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:28.240]  Throughout the process of my freeze dryer, I will, towards the end, check it to see where I'm at, see the consistency.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:36.240]  Because if you do go over-dry, that is just as bad as if you hung up your plane and you over-dried it and it didn't get into the jar.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  Yes, that can definitely, definitely cause a problem.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:50.240]  Even though the temperatures are extremely cold in the freeze dryer, you can still run into a lack of taste.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.240]  Dani?
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:16:01.240]  So normally there's a curing process with black-capped shotgun, and I just took a dab of that, and it felt, or tasted great.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:08.240]  I think what I feel is a little bit more chlorophyll. Is that why you do the curing, so you have a smoother turnout?
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:15.240]  It will, definitely, especially after a press, a fresh press like that, it's definitely a totally different taste of a cure.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:17.240]  I personally like the cold cure.
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:27.240]  That way you can get it immediately cold, preserve those terpenes, and get it to get that consistency, the butter consistency that we normally look for.
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.240]  But yes, curing the hash browns is extremely important.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.240]  And you said that you don't like fresh frozen reds?
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.240]  No.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:36.240]  Can you tell me why, please?
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:42.240]  Because of that, right, the reason why, that taste, the chlorophyll taste, I don't like that taste at all. I do not like that taste.
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:45.240]  Is that how your rosin is so light?
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.240]  Some of my rosins are actually dark.
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:17:02.240]  If you look at the white blueberries, actually the gold viscosity with the highest number of terpenes on it is actually really dark compared to what other people consider the standard quality of hash browns.
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:17.240]  I tell people a top color doesn't matter because when you, it matters in a sense, but in a sense you can't tell the quality of hash browns based strictly on the color.
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:27.240]  There's no way you would be able to do that because color being dark could be from something not good, acquired as a too hot press or under-pressed for too long.
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:33.240]  Because you have a darker color, but a purple flower can also be a darker color.
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:37.240]  So the velvet scotch back then was actually a completely purple plant.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.240]  I mean the whole entire bud, the leaves, everything was dark purple.
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:42.240]  Some of them almost even looked black.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:50.240]  And so whenever we did the wash, it was almost a wine color of water when we got done.
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:53.240]  So we did the press, it looks a little bit darker.
[02:17:53.240 --> 02:18:01.240]  But you cannot look at hash browns and judge it strictly on the color to be able to tell if it's this or that way.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.240]  Before the chat, can you kind of go into the reasons why?
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:13.240]  Because they're basically taught, especially on Instagram, what certain stuff looks like and then that's great.
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:15.240]  And there's CRC techniques and all that kind of stuff.
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:20.240]  So can you kind of break that down, not only for our live audience, but for everybody at home?
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:26.240]  I really do want people to realize that it's easy to trick the person that doesn't understand exactly.
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.240]  It's almost like they're offering you a high-quality car, but the inside is total trash.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:42.240]  So whenever you're looking at products like this, you get a lot of people that will lean towards a lighter color.
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:49.240]  And I know a minute ago I had a gentleman say, you know, if I was looking at this, this would be what I would go for because of the color.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:53.240]  However, oh God, we got some water?
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.240]  Fuck that.
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:57.240]  That's the good weed, y'all.
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.240]  Thank you.
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:09.240]  So actually, my two lighter color strains actually have lower number of terpenes compared to my darker color strains.
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.240]  My darker color strains are the ones that actually are the most active.
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:20.240]  So whatever you are curing your bud, depending on when you cut down, is extremely important.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:26.240]  So you do have a lot of people cutting down super early in order to get that color.
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:31.240]  Me personally, that strain right there is probably cut a little bit too early.
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:33.240]  At least that was a personal strain.
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:35.240]  I was doing a female hunt.
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.240]  I didn't really like the strain anyway.
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:39.240]  So it was like, hey, we got a principal hash here.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.240]  I can do a hash for free and make this.
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.240]  So that was a personal strain.
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:48.240]  A little female type there that I didn't care for.
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:50.240]  And I mean, actually did really good.
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.240]  I'm impressed enough with you.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:57.240]  But you do have people who were doing things like, say, CRC.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:04.240]  I think that's more when you're doing a CO2 extraction, a butane extraction, something like that.
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:06.240]  But they don't know the difference.
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:13.240]  So then sometimes people will sell that those products is basically the same thing because they kind of look with the same color.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:15.240]  Oh, okay.
[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.240]  I see what you're saying.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:21.240]  So now this here is a touchy subject.
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:24.240]  And I don't mean to step on anybody's toes.
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:29.240]  So if I say something that comes out the wrong way, to each his own.
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:32.240]  I'm not putting a gun to your head telling you to do anything.
[02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:35.240]  So whichever way that you want to go, you go that way.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:39.240]  But I will educate you, especially if somebody wants to ask a question.
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:44.240]  So butane extraction, CO2 extraction.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:52.240]  I will tell you, you have companies that are using extremely amazing cannabis to be able to do this.
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:56.240]  You also got some companies that are using straight trash.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:59.240]  And looking at the color, you are not going to be able to tell the difference.
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:02.240]  So whatever. And I don't do butane extraction.
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:06.240]  I don't do CO2 extraction, but I did major in chemistry.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:15.240]  So whenever there is one that butane extraction or CO2 extraction, you're basically what they call blasting your cannabis with these products.
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:20.240]  And so you get your car, you get your cannabis super cold, basically in the tube.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.240]  And this is just layman's terms, just pretty much how it was explained to me.
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.240]  I may not be 100 percent right.
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:30.240]  But my understanding is pretty much like you blasted with butane, CO2.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:37.240]  After you get it out of that, you have what some people still call full spectrum.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:44.240]  And I think the jury is still out on full spectrum because after you blast this stuff with either the butane or the CO2.
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:49.240]  And when I say butane, I mean the same stuff that you might have to go joint with.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:52.240]  It's the same stuff they are putting on your cannabis.
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:58.240]  And so when they take this cannabis and blast it with this butane, they have to get it off.
[02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:02.240]  And the only way to be able to get that off is if they put it in a vacuum and they heat the temperatures up.
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:05.240]  When they heat the temperatures up, they destroy all the terpenes.
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.240]  And like I told you earlier, that's where all your medicine is.
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:11.240]  Every strain has a TACA. That's just the car.
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:14.240]  Your steering wheel is what you need to be able to go somewhere.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:23.240]  So once you heat it up and destroy all the terpenes, you have to do a process of cleaning it up in a sense.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:29.240]  Because it's got a sometimes kind of super dark and super like gross looking.
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:35.240]  And they do a technique called CRC and they are able to basically clean it up and lighten it up.
[02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:43.240]  But in this vacuum chamber, as they're trying to burn off this butane, they are also burning off volatile terpenes.
[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:47.240]  And what they do is they add the terpenes back in.
[02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:59.240]  And if you guys want to know the God-awful truth about it, it doesn't matter what strain that your Distilyt card says, that is not the marijuana that it is.
[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:06.240]  And I probably won't have a lot of people mad at me about this, but this is going to give me some truth.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:09.240]  I don't care what your Distilyt card says. That's not what it is.
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:14.240]  They will take any strain from any plant and they will blast it all together.
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:25.240]  And what they do is they will look at the terpene profile of say a white widow or a sour diesel and they will add those terpenes back into that Distilyt to give you the vapor.
[02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:28.240]  Tell you that's what it is. That is not how that should be.
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:45.240]  And so basically what it is, is they take this butane blasted gunk, because I know you've seen the pictures that come out and look like, I don't know, slime, some thick, heavy, it don't look like something I want to eat.
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:47.240]  I take that much. I don't want to eat that.
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:54.240]  And so after they get all of this, they will put it into a vape card or they will put it into an edible.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:59.240]  And so one thing people need to understand is that there is this another imaginary guy.
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:09.240]  Now he ain't the guy that waters the tree, but it is a guy out there that determines how much of a poison that you can ingest in order to still be okay.
[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:17.240]  So if you look at your water in this town of Tulsa, Oklahoma, you can go online right now and look at what's in your water.
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:21.240]  And some guy tells you that it's okay to have arsenic.
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.240]  It's okay to have a bunch of fluoride. It's okay to have all of these chemicals in your tap water.
[02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:30.240]  And it's okay. Now, I'm not the guy that said that, but somebody did.
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:40.240]  So whenever they're making these Distilyt and butane extracted things, there's a level that you can reach that is okay.
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:43.240]  And somebody out there determined what that level was.
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:48.240]  I don't know what that level is. I don't care what that level is. I don't want to do anything with that.
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:25:05.240]  And so once you get all of the butane or CO2 off of your marijuana and you put it into an edible or a vape and you give it a different terpene, you restricted its medicinal purpose.
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:13.240]  And the same thing, like I said, with water. You split water up and you got hydrogen, you got a bomb, you just got oxygen, you got poison.
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:17.240]  You drink it for a year and it's just oxygen. It will kill you. So you have to keep it together.
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:24.240]  And so if you take it and you're stripping everything off and then you add terpenes in, that may not be to rob you of cannabis at all anyway.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:30.240]  You're not giving me medicine. You may be giving me a party drug and that's cool. I'll buy that and party on it.
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:38.240]  But if I'm looking for medicine, to me, that's not medicine. That's not the intended purpose, I believe, of the plant.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.240]  So how many people did I piss off on there?
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:52.240]  Yeah, you got some people that are questioning stuff. But at the same time, man, there's a reason why people get really upset about that.
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:58.240]  You know, it's because it takes time to produce what you're doing here. And then CRC is basically cheating.
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:05.240]  And if you're newer to, which I feel like Oklahoma's consumers are newer to this, what's it been, three years?
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:08.240]  Two years? Is that everything you've been talking about?
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:14.240]  So as far as for a lot of us in here, you guys are so new to this.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:23.240]  Like I even said, if you're learning how to grow, you still need to consider it like a four year process before you should feel comfortable enough in farming at a commercial level.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:33.240]  And so the CRC stuff, I feel like there's a reason why those companies even won the High Times Awards when we were out here, which was a complete shit show as well.
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:38.240]  Because I feel like you guys were deceived at that event.
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:48.240]  Yes, yes, because you have an uneducated market. And so like you say, one of the reasons that people are getting pissed off about it, I mean, the deal is, why would you ever get mad at me for telling you the truth?
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:53.240]  If you get mad at me for telling you the truth, then you are the one with the problem, not me.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:27:01.240]  So if you are all about money and you want to keep your secret about the insulin, well, sorry, but secret's out.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:09.240]  I'm busting my ass right now to be able to make hash browns and the growth of the product to be able to give people the medicine that they need.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:12.240]  Because I've seen people benefit from it.
[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:18.240]  I've seen people who could barely walk start walking or using my top.
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:24.240]  I've seen people who were having anxiety and goes away by smoking my hash browns.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:32.240]  I've seen somebody with severe PTSD be able to go around and meet a group of people and be able to talk to people because of using my hash browns.
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:45.240]  OK, but again, you can keep your money because if I can help you this way and make you be able to have a more enjoyable life and not have to be dependent on chemicals, you're here, man.
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:47.240]  Thank you. But that may have been my purpose here.
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:49.240]  So go ahead.
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:52.240]  Yeah. For the viewers at home, you're a self-taught, correct?
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.240]  Yeah, I didn't take any classes or anything like that.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.240]  I just read and chopped some stuff and read some more.
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:04.240]  I definitely utilize things like Instagram.
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.240]  At that time, we wouldn't really be popular on Facebook like that.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:11.240]  So what do I need to just go and ask somebody, you know?
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.240]  Well, I'm just trying to point out, Marco, you're self-taught, correct?
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:16.240]  For the most part, yeah.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.240]  You're an engineer by trade?
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:24.240]  Well, I majored in forestry and wildlife and then I transitioned to engineering.
[02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:28.510]  But yeah, mostly self-taught.
[02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:35.510]  Because I feel like some people in the chat, you know, if you don't have a PhD next to your name, then why are we going to take you serious?
[02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:40.510]  And what I was trying to point out is that there's a lot of you, Brandon Russ, as well.
[02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:45.510]  I mean, I know that he's self-educated because he was just unfortunately in prison just a few years ago.
[02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:54.510]  I just want to point out to the chat that a lot of us, especially here today, we're just trying to educate to the fact of our level, our skill set.
[02:28:54.510 --> 02:29:01.510]  No one here, I can assure you, there is no bullshit egos in this room and nobody's trying to be like that.
[02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:09.510]  So if there's anybody in the chat that feels like I've been saying this, sometimes I feel like you guys, especially in the chat, feel like you invented candidates.
[02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:11.510]  And I can assure you that nobody did that.
[02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:14.510]  And we're all here just trying to promote one another.
[02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:18.510]  And so when he's up here and he doesn't have a PhD, I don't have a PhD.
[02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:19.510]  I don't have a college degree.
[02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:23.510]  But I will let you know that we have spent a lot of time doing this.
[02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:27.510]  And the experience is honestly what a lot of you should really be after.
[02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:37.510]  It's how do we minimize the bullshit techniques, some of the bro science that's been out there to minimize sometimes months, even years off your learning curve.
[02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:43.510]  Exactly. Because at the end of the day, there are they are capitalizing on the ignorance.
[02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:53.510]  And so how did you be upset or not want to listen to somebody who actually went out there and did it on their own, trying to figure out for themselves instead of listening to what somebody else had to say?
[02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:56.510]  So guess what, guys? I went out there. I did it on my own.
[02:29:56.510 --> 02:30:01.510]  I'm telling you what I found out. A lot of the stuff out there is straight bullshit.
[02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:04.510]  And the more you educate yourself about it, you'll be able to figure that out.
[02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:14.510]  And we'll be able to save our market and not have our market go in the shit like this right now, because everybody knows, especially if you're a grower, it's hard to sell.
[02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:24.510]  It's extremely hard to sell. And so if you're out here busting your ass and you're doing stuff like this, like she knows we are all the time.
[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:34.510]  I have a pool of marijuana. I can't remember. I know what I am.
[02:30:34.510 --> 02:30:38.510]  I know where to drive, but that's fine because I want to make hash.
[02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:42.510]  So I cut an entire field of marijuana.
[02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:50.510]  I got plants. This big, this tall, cut them down, throw them in the freezer.
[02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:56.510]  Everybody's like, oh, you're out to get mine? Cut them down, throw them in the freezer. I've been studying this. I can do it.
[02:30:56.510 --> 02:31:06.510]  Cut it down, throw it in the freezer. I washed it, pressed it. 14% terpenes. I won an OG Cup.
[02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:13.510]  I'm telling y'all what I learned. So if you want to learn, you want to listen, go ahead.
[02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:18.510]  If you want to talk shit, we're the shores of what I can say.
[02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:22.510]  Well, that's what I mean, man. There's so many little keyboard growers and stuff.
[02:31:22.510 --> 02:31:30.510]  And I just wanted to put it out there. So it was squash, but I just wanted to put it out there that nobody here, I assure you, is at that level.
[02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:39.510]  And I can say from going around and doing public speaking events, it is usually the guys that don't have the PhDs that resonates with the crowd like this.
[02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:49.510]  Some of those top companies that are cannabis focused, when they do bring their PhDs up there, they start talking about really deep topics, especially for newer farmers.
[02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:56.510]  It goes over their head. And I know that a lot of people are resonating with what you're saying right now because there's a ton of questions in the chat.
[02:31:56.510 --> 02:32:01.510]  There's already been a ton of people asking about that. So that means you're communicating with everybody.
[02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:04.510]  And I feel like that as a public speaker, that's what you're after.
[02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:09.510]  And more and more people are going to come after you, what you're saying, because you're just sitting there spitting truth.
[02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:13.510]  And if people are upset about that, you know, CRC is for you.
[02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:19.510]  Yeah, exactly. That's for you. I mean, I don't have many friends at all because I will speak the truth all day long.
[02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:27.510]  Matter of fact, on the way up here, I had a friend call me. She was like, look, I called you specifically because I know you're going to tell the truth.
[02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:32.510]  You're not going to sugarcoat it. I was like, yep, that's one thing about me. I'm not going to. I don't care if you're my friend or not.
[02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:39.510]  I'm not going to lie to you. And that should let you know that I'm at least your friend. So you don't have to be my friend. I'm not going to lie to you at all.
[02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:45.510]  So truth of the matter is, I feel like this is the best way to consume this medicine. Pay attention to the therapies.
[02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:52.510]  Regardless, it works for you. If you're a CRC person, I'm not mocking you. I could care less. And I will tell you, I mean, I don't know everything.
[02:32:52.510 --> 02:32:55.510]  Again, this is a brand new market. I've been doing this for three years.
[02:32:55.510 --> 02:33:03.510]  But I have also in three years time made my own strain that is actually beneficial in medicinal purposes for people in this industry.
[02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:13.510]  So it's going to be kind of hard for me to listen to anybody trying to bad mouth me if they're sitting on the couch watching me to make the next move for them.
[02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:16.510]  So it is what it is.
[02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:22.510]  All right. Does anybody from the crowd have any questions? Please come up quickly.
[02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:29.510]  And then we're going to start off, have a nice little break. So you guys can smoke if you want to have food. There's food downstairs.
[02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:38.510]  And then we're going to get back with Arlie right here in the green shirt. Where is that? Brown hat. He is up next after the break.
[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:45.510]  Thank you guys so much. Anybody have any more questions? Anything like that? Cool.
[02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:48.510]  All right. I encourage you guys to come see him. Enjoy his stuff back there.
[02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:52.510]  Yeah. Come on in. Let's see. I'll show you why we do this. Come on.
[02:33:55.510 --> 02:34:01.510]  And a lot of people in the chat, I definitely noticed for you, you're way ahead of the game after three years.
[02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:04.510]  That's what I'm saying. You're a top prospect.
[02:34:05.510 --> 02:34:10.510]  Honestly, it's been three years. And I don't say three years in the sense of being cocky.
[02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:13.510]  Like, oh, I need to sit three years by myself or anything like that.
[02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:21.510]  It was just in this market and in this industry and being in this place, it wasn't like I had a whole lot of people say, hey, come on, bro.
[02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:23.510]  Let me show you how to grow. That didn't happen.
[02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:28.510]  Ain't nobody out here like, hey, bro, come on, let me show you how to make some hash brows and teach you something.
[02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:32.510]  That didn't happen. So it was five more to learn. I had to teach myself.
[02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:36.510]  I don't think that come off as cocky or anything like that.
[02:34:36.510 --> 02:34:42.510]  But anybody who knows more than me and looking at that like he's cocky, I would actually be.
[02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:44.510]  You come to me, don't teach.
[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:49.510]  I definitely don't think people think you know, you're genuine.
[02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:52.510]  So the cockiness, that's not there. I have somebody say that.
[02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:57.510]  Somebody said, because of me telling them that I was self taught, that I was cocky.
[02:34:57.510 --> 02:35:05.510]  I was like, no, from the industry and where I'm at in Oklahoma, I had to teach myself.
[02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:06.510]  I didn't have a choice.
[02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:07.510]  Absolutely.
[02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:10.510]  Well, again, thank you, Danny.
[02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:12.510]  We look forward to smoking on your stuff.
[02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:13.510]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:55.220]  We'll see if we survive the YouTube censors for the music, but let it roll.
[02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:06.220]  I think we need a Murphy Murray response.
[02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:16.220]  I wish I had some DJs to queue up.
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:37:00.220]  So my fun for the rest of the day is I have 24 different lines to data input.
[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:03.220]  I don't even know if anyone can hear me.
[02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:05.220]  That's what all this stuff is.
[02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:08.220]  It's all like three packs of this, four packs of that.
[02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:15.220]  I can.
[02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:25.220]  I can turn that down.
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:36.220]  Yes, Papa Shin, we understand that the sound is coming from a USB microphone.
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:45.220]  Don't bump bump bump bump bump.
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:55.220]  Any who could either kill the streamer and come back when.
[02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:09.220]  Yeah, basically earlier we were trying to send for the audio files in the room, a an XLR cable from the soundboard, which is on the other side of the room.
[02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:16.220]  Now they're in Tulsa.
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:22.220]  Yes, Papa Shin, thank you.
[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:30.220]  Well, Papa Shin, you could mute it and come back when the next speaker is on.
[02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:37.220]  And I fully acknowledge the audio is is mediocre, but it's passable.
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.220]  So what should I do?
[02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:41.220]  What should I do?
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:44.220]  I don't know.
[02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:52.220]  My audio sounds good.
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:58.220]  So, by the way, these were what I was showing before the.
[02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:03.220]  First of all, this is a a gem of self portrait.
[02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:10.220]  But these are the Drew Brophy collab.
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:12.220]  FCP drew the.
[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:17.220]  FCP down there, Drew Brophy.
[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:27.220]  Yeah, I haven't eaten anything today.
[02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:40.220]  It's three in the afternoon and I'm fantasizing that the fridge Brian, I do smoke, but my wife hates when I smoke in the house.
[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:49.220]  And the tradeoff between being nagged and lectured and just not smoking in the house.
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:55.220]  I usually side with the minimize the nagging and lecturing.
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:00.220]  And he's.
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:10.220]  I'm almost at the end of flowering at the Hayes.
[02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:17.220]  I got to go up the time I was in Rhode Island for the past two weeks, so I got to check in on Tom's house.
[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:35.220]  Yeah, I was hoping that I did not have to monologue or will turn that way down, turn it way down.
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:39.220]  All right. Let me let me find me find some non strike music.
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:41.220]  If you all give me a second.
[02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:44.220]  Hold on.
[02:40:52.950 --> 02:41:04.350]  Wake up.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:39.900]  Let's see.
[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:55.820]  All right, let's see if that is making up.
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:57.820]  No.
[02:41:57.820 --> 02:42:04.820]  OK, let's see if you can all hear that.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:16.400]  All right.
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:35.440]  That this guy is about 90 years old right now, and I was trying to get his contact info.
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:40.440]  To.
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:47.440]  It's very satisfying.
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:49.440]  It's.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:56.440]  He's my dad's age.
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  Be like my dad.
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:18.780]  This is the exciting stage.
[02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:22.780]  Everybody left.
[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:26.780]  It's not expected.
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:37.560]  We will do the and we need to think of you and sunshine.
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:43.560]  Yeah, well, I didn't really think you wanted to listen to me.
[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:01.140]  Yeah, I was trying to keep my audio low.
[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:03.140]  Would you rather hear me or the music?
[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:06.500]  Along this smoke break is.
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:47:14.460]  All right. Got to find something else that will hopefully not be dinged for copyright.
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:19.460]  So let me walk over to the other computer again where the music is.
[02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:21.460]  But I'm.
[02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:27.820]  Yeah, we can have Brandon come freestyle.
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:29.820]  I think he's probably smoking downstairs.
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:31.820]  All right, I'll be back.
[02:47:34.820 --> 02:47:36.820]  This is no longer in this.
[02:47:38.820 --> 02:48:25.810]  Let me fast forward.
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:34.580]  I'm.
[02:48:37.490 --> 02:48:39.490]  I'm.
[02:48:57.950 --> 02:48:59.950]  I'm.
[02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:02.950]  This.
[02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:05.950]  It's.
[02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:08.950]  It's.
[02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:13.950]  This.
[02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:07.700]  You can all watch me do data entry.
[02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:16.100]  This is what data entry looks like.
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:09.700]  Why, buddy? That's what I'm doing.
[02:51:09.700 --> 02:51:11.700]  Data entry. I decided a Mr.
[02:51:12.700 --> 02:51:17.700]  Toad disciple, eclectic elegance with a whole lot of black line reserve process.
[02:51:19.700 --> 02:51:21.700]  Right now I'm doing seven seven.
[02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:25.700]  That's what all this stuff is.
[02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:29.700]  I got a bunch of bins right over there.
[02:51:30.700 --> 02:51:32.700]  More data entry.
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:36.700]  So anyway, this is a Manu Chow concert.
[02:51:36.700 --> 02:51:39.700]  I remember when I first heard Manu Chow, I was like, this dude is amazing.
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:42.700]  It's like he sings in French, Spanish, English.
[02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:48.700]  Shredder, if you want to, if you want to, I can move over.
[02:51:49.700 --> 02:51:51.700]  You want to take over?
[02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:54.700]  Yes, I agree, Mr.
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:57.700]  Toad.
[02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:00.700]  And what I wanted to do is to have you and him.
[02:52:00.700 --> 02:52:02.700]  And maybe Jackson.
[02:52:03.700 --> 02:52:07.700]  Come on and kind of have you guys talk about him and talk about you guys.
[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:13.700]  Even show you want to see the results of my data entry.
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:16.700]  Here we go.
[02:52:18.700 --> 02:52:32.530]  I am pistol positive. Yeah, I thought it'd be cool to get.
[02:52:33.530 --> 02:52:35.530]  I thought it'd be cool to get.
[02:52:36.530 --> 02:52:38.530]  I thought it'd be cool to get.
[02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:51.060]  I am pistol positive. Yeah, I thought it'd be cool to get.
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:54.060]  Yes, pistol. You and pistol positive too.
[02:52:58.060 --> 02:53:00.060]  I think.
[02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:03.060]  Blackbird.
[02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:05.060]  Preservation.
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  He was even inspired by your bio.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000]  I was like, can you put a bio together?
[02:53:34.220 --> 02:53:36.220]  This was the data entry.
[02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:39.220]  So far.
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:51.940]  This is.
[02:53:52.940 --> 02:53:54.940]  24. It's like things that demoralize you.
[02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:10.230]  Also, Mr. Toad, since I have you here.
[02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:17.230]  The plastic.
[02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:20.230]  That you can use the heat gun on.
[02:54:21.230 --> 02:54:23.230]  I think you need to send more of that.
[02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:26.230]  But I got to look in the end.
[02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:29.230]  I'm talking about the phone shippers.
[02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:32.230]  Although I may be.
[02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:35.230]  I'll look at all of them.
[02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:38.230]  Maybe you sent a whole bunch.
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:02.340]  Does anyone who's a musician know what a U-Base is?
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:08.340]  Yeah, the heat shrink.
[02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:13.340]  Because I was thinking of getting a.
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:17.340]  That'd be fun to have the U-Base and lay down some baselines.
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:27.840]  So as long as.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:30.840]  Readers who are currently in the chat.
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:43.920]  Let us.
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:46.920]  Mr. Toad.
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:50.920]  This is what we're talking about right now. The phone shipper.
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:53.920]  We have.
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:56:05.680]  Representing.
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:08.680]  Utah.
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:11.680]  Rhode Island's the ocean state. What's Utah?
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:16.680]  It's the what state?
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:18.680]  I don't know.
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:31.680]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:34.680]  Yes.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.680]  Are they like this big?
[02:57:02.220 --> 02:57:04.220]  Is anyone back?
[02:57:05.220 --> 02:57:21.990]  No.
[02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.660]  So this is.
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:36.660]  The man.
[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:39.660]  For the future.
[02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:42.660]  I mean.
[02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:45.660]  George.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.360]  Brian don't think I don't notice your heckling.
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:42.210]  Scrolling past all these Rhode Island.
[02:58:43.210 --> 02:58:45.210]  Pictures.
[02:58:49.210 --> 02:59:02.210]  The Greenhouse.
[02:59:22.780 --> 02:59:28.100]  All right.
[02:59:29.100 --> 02:59:31.100]  Random personal.
[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:34.100]  This is the greenhouse.
[02:59:35.100 --> 02:59:37.100]  Takeover.
[02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:40.100]  Yeah, the color.
[02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:43.100]  Because you can basically you can.
[02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:55.950]  It's like an electric acoustic.
[02:59:56.950 --> 02:59:58.950]  Sorry, so this is in Camarillo.
[02:59:59.950 --> 03:00:01.950]  Carpenter.
[03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:12.690]  So it's a.
[03:00:13.690 --> 03:00:15.690]  Square foot greenhouse.
[03:00:30.090 --> 03:00:33.870]  Conveniently.
[03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:38.870]  Located.
[03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:41.870]  50 yards from the 101.
[03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:43.870]  That's the maybe not even 50.
[03:00:43.870 --> 03:00:45.870]  That's the 101.
[03:00:58.980 --> 03:01:00.980]  Now it has a.
[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:04.980]  The roof is clear plastic.
[03:01:05.980 --> 03:01:07.980]  Although you need the plastic.
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:10.980]  Because it's all that's all dirt on top.
[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:12.980]  That's that's not.
[03:01:14.980 --> 03:01:20.100]  So but.
[03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:23.100]  Yeah, basically to do.
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:27.100]  To grow stuff to do research to do events.
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:31.100]  And then also outside we could have caught inside to.
[03:01:35.100 --> 03:01:37.100]  Workshops seminars.
[03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:40.100]  The FCP brand beans.
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:42.100]  And then have kind of like random.
[03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:46.100]  Big boy toys in there or just random stuff like sun on demand.
[03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:50.100]  I wanted to talk to them about getting one of their lights in
[03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:53.100]  there.
[03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:58.100]  Lance Lambert.
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:01.100]  With Green Bros.
[03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:08.100]  Alexander.
[03:02:08.100 --> 03:02:12.210]  I like the talking about the.
[03:02:15.210 --> 03:02:17.210]  Or what are you talking about.
[03:02:19.210 --> 03:02:30.930]  I also haven't eaten anything.
[03:02:32.930 --> 03:02:39.140]  I think they all left for good.
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:03:12.950]  From 619 I did it was that in the news.
[03:03:13.950 --> 03:03:15.950]  I was at a town so.
[03:03:15.950 --> 03:03:17.950]  Some food today.
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:27.900]  Say what you guys show with the music.
[03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:32.900]  OK so.
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:44.400]  Yeah.
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.400]  Fuck yeah 1.6 billion.
[03:03:51.310 --> 03:03:53.310]  What.
[03:03:56.310 --> 03:03:58.310]  What.
[03:03:59.310 --> 03:04:01.310]  I'm not sure.
[03:04:02.310 --> 03:04:08.020]  That looks awesome.
[03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:12.020]  Antelope Valley.
[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:28.740]  Yeah I don't know how they get there.
[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:31.740]  Like are they weighing like.
[03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:34.740]  The whole plant plus the pots.
[03:04:40.740 --> 03:04:42.740]  Three.
[03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:48.910]  373,000 plans.
[03:04:50.910 --> 03:05:20.740]  Those lights going.
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:23.740]  We got our lighting effects.
[03:05:25.740 --> 03:05:35.670]  It was an antelope.
[03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:44.340]  North of.
[03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:04.670]  I believe that is where it is.
[03:06:05.670 --> 03:06:07.670]  Up near Palmdale.
[03:06:09.670 --> 03:06:27.470]  OK.
[03:06:27.470 --> 03:06:29.470]  I'm going to go see.
[03:06:29.470 --> 03:06:31.470]  What I can quickly grab.
[03:06:32.470 --> 03:06:36.900]  You guys.
[03:06:38.900 --> 03:06:42.230]  Keep an eye on.
[03:06:42.230 --> 03:06:44.230]  I'll be back.
[03:09:10.820 --> 03:09:12.820]  Are you OK.
[03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:25.150]  Yeah.
[03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:28.150]  So.
[03:09:42.390 --> 03:09:44.390]  I thought.
[03:09:45.390 --> 03:10:02.300]  I.
[03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:05.300]  Saw.
[03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:08.300]  So.
[03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:36.820]  So.
[03:10:40.060 --> 03:10:42.060]  So.
[03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:45.060]  So.
[03:10:46.060 --> 03:10:48.060]  So.
[03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:51.060]  So.
[03:10:55.060 --> 03:10:57.060]  So.
[03:10:59.060 --> 03:11:04.570]  So.
[03:11:06.570 --> 03:11:36.850]  So.
[03:11:37.850 --> 03:11:39.850]  So.
[03:11:52.890 --> 03:11:54.890]  So.
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:28.920]  So.
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:40.180]  Mexicano, grande estilo.
[03:15:40.180 --> 03:15:43.060]  Me dicen El Desaparecido.
[03:15:43.060 --> 03:16:06.680]  Cuando llega ya se ha ido, volando vengo, volando voy.
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:09.380]  Deprisa, deprisa, rumbo perdido.
[03:16:09.380 --> 03:16:11.920]  Cuando me busca el tramo no soy.
[03:16:11.920 --> 03:16:16.700]  El que está enfrente por mi charro me voy corriendo mas allá.
[03:16:16.700 --> 03:16:19.300]  Me dicen El Desaparecido.
[03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:21.280]  Cuantas manos me han ido de mi.
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:23.280]  Me dicen El Desaparecido.
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:36.490]  Cuantas mangas nunca salgo.
[03:16:36.490 --> 03:16:44.810]  I actually brought a ton of edibles when I went to see my family.
[03:16:47.770 --> 03:16:52.650]  I'm not really a big edibles person. I just like to smell mostly flour.
[03:17:13.750 --> 03:17:16.870]  Cheddar Bob, how is Maristem?
[03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:32.270]  Do you want to tell us about it? It's Maine's newest, hottest, bar harbor dispenser.
[03:17:46.340 --> 03:17:50.020]  Perpetual, we are waiting for the people who are smoking weed
[03:17:50.980 --> 03:17:57.380]  somewhere off camera to come back on camera and begin talking again.
[03:18:02.660 --> 03:18:08.100]  With mediocre audio, but better than no audio.
[03:18:16.810 --> 03:18:19.130]  That was one single sausage.
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:35.880]  I am not eating chow.
[03:18:41.060 --> 03:18:42.340]  The music we're listening to.
[03:18:56.050 --> 03:18:58.530]  I wish they rotated the camera so we could see
[03:19:01.970 --> 03:19:06.930]  what's going on. Yeah, I think they're, I don't know, there's like a downstairs.
[03:19:06.930 --> 03:19:08.530]  I think they're outside. I think they're like
[03:19:11.650 --> 03:19:12.290]  magma.
[03:19:28.270 --> 03:19:28.910]  Light show.
[03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:45.030]  It's like an eighth grade bar mitzvah in a Hilton hotel.
[03:19:45.350 --> 03:20:09.050]  That's insane. Really? I mean, that's awesome.
[03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:45.730]  It's good.
[03:20:45.730 --> 03:20:49.260]  I'm not sure what that is.
[03:20:49.260 --> 03:20:51.260]  I don't know.
[03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:53.260]  I don't know.
[03:20:53.260 --> 03:20:55.260]  I don't know.
[03:20:55.260 --> 03:20:59.810]  I don't know.
[03:20:59.810 --> 03:21:01.810]  I don't know.
[03:21:02.050 --> 03:21:04.050]  Let's give everyone a visual.
[03:21:08.050 --> 03:21:10.050]  Maristem.
[03:21:23.180 --> 03:21:25.180]  If I were to google map that.
[03:21:27.180 --> 03:21:29.180]  Maristem.
[03:21:57.090 --> 03:21:59.090]  Aha! Mount Dogen Island.
[03:21:59.330 --> 03:22:01.330]  Err.
[03:22:01.330 --> 03:22:04.920]  There's Blue.
[03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:08.260]  The Jungle GI.
[03:22:33.300 --> 03:22:35.300]  Some intrepid reporting.
[03:22:39.300 --> 03:22:41.300]  By Sarah Hinckley.
[03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:49.300]  Digging deep into the news that is happening in the Southwest Harbor,
[03:22:49.300 --> 03:22:51.300]  Tremont, and neighboring islands.
[03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:55.300]  I like the guy on the left has style.
[03:23:17.130 --> 03:23:19.130]  Anyway, Blue is probably in the shop right now.
[03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:21.130]  Actually, no, sorry. It's 6.50.
[03:23:21.130 --> 03:23:23.130]  What time?
[03:23:23.130 --> 03:23:25.130]  I don't know if he disappeared on us.
[03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:31.130]  What time can you stay open until?
[03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:33.130]  I mean, that's amazing that he's the only
[03:23:33.370 --> 03:23:35.370]  shop in the
[03:23:35.370 --> 03:23:37.370]  I mean, that's
[03:23:37.370 --> 03:23:39.370]  I think every LA shop would love to have that.
[03:23:45.370 --> 03:23:47.370]  LA is heat right now.
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:23:58.400]  I've been in here most of the day.
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:04.400]  There's SoCal people.
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:06.400]  Who has the hottest weather right now?
[03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:08.640]  Who has the hottest weather right now?
[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:12.640]  Anyone in triple digits today?
[03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:16.640]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:18.640]  Especially because it's also like a
[03:24:20.640 --> 03:24:22.640]  high-end resort
[03:24:22.640 --> 03:24:51.840]  town.
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.840]  Adelanto Stadium today.
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:57.840]  Which is, I believe, the only reason
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:24:59.840]  besides prison that anyone would go to Adelanto.
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:23.360]  Prison.
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:31.360]  The Palm Springs area gets
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:33.360]  ridiculously hot.
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:37.360]  There was some event there last August
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:39.360]  or two Augusts ago.
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:43.360]  I was like, why would you have an event in August
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:45.360]  in the Palm Desert area?
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:49.360]  Yes, it's a Mitzah
[03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:51.600]  or Tzotoropsky.
[03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:53.600]  It is Manechal.
[03:26:16.350 --> 03:26:18.350]  Yeah, I was on the east coast when Coast Guard happened.
[03:26:46.720 --> 03:26:54.540]  Tzotkitz.
[03:27:06.540 --> 03:27:08.540]  I would like to be at the Emerald Cup this year.
[03:27:08.540 --> 03:27:10.540]  I think it's usually
[03:27:12.540 --> 03:27:14.540]  early December this year.
[03:27:18.540 --> 03:27:20.540]  2021.
[03:27:20.780 --> 03:27:22.780]  Yeah, December 11th.
[03:27:26.780 --> 03:27:28.780]  I was there two years ago.
[03:27:36.230 --> 03:27:38.230]  I'm having baby number three
[03:27:38.230 --> 03:27:40.230]  early September.
[03:27:42.230 --> 03:27:44.230]  Let's see how much I can stray.
[03:27:46.230 --> 03:27:58.200]  Is from 619
[03:27:58.200 --> 03:28:00.200]  to 664 going to be
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:02.200]  at the Emerald Cup?
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:29.970]  It's almost 6.
[03:28:31.970 --> 03:28:33.970]  I don't know if this is their dinner break
[03:28:33.970 --> 03:28:35.970]  or if they're going to break again for like
[03:28:37.970 --> 03:28:39.970]  I was hoping to condense this stuff
[03:28:39.970 --> 03:28:41.970]  and just have it be like
[03:28:41.970 --> 03:28:43.970]  four or five hours
[03:28:43.970 --> 03:28:45.970]  and
[03:28:45.970 --> 03:29:19.960]  done.
[03:29:19.960 --> 03:29:21.960]  Oh, call him on the phone.
[03:29:34.690 --> 03:29:36.690]  Yeah, let's
[03:29:36.690 --> 03:29:38.690]  that is a good idea.
[03:29:50.430 --> 03:29:52.430]  I said, y'all coming back?
[03:30:12.390 --> 03:30:14.390]  We got a fight tonight.
[03:30:16.390 --> 03:30:18.390]  Was basketball
[03:30:18.390 --> 03:30:20.390]  last night
[03:30:20.390 --> 03:30:22.390]  or are they taking
[03:30:22.390 --> 03:30:24.390]  three nights
[03:30:24.390 --> 03:30:26.390]  between games two and three?
[03:30:30.390 --> 03:30:32.390]  Sunday, okay.
[03:30:32.390 --> 03:30:34.390]  No basketball tonight.
[03:30:45.630 --> 03:30:47.630]  Fortunately, Manu Chow can go 20 more minutes.
[03:30:58.850 --> 03:31:00.850]  So
[03:31:20.490 --> 03:31:22.490]  Brian is trying to herd
[03:31:22.490 --> 03:31:24.490]  cats right now
[03:31:24.490 --> 03:31:26.490]  and get them all back inside.
[03:31:28.490 --> 03:31:38.160]  Hello, Virginia
[03:31:38.400 --> 03:31:40.400]  Herbs
[03:31:40.400 --> 03:31:47.520]  What is it?
[03:31:47.520 --> 03:31:49.520]  7 o'clock?
[03:31:49.520 --> 03:31:51.520]  Yes.
[03:31:53.520 --> 03:31:55.520]  Shockingly long break.
[03:32:09.300 --> 03:32:11.300]  I guess this would be the dinner break.
[03:32:13.300 --> 03:32:15.300]  Even in the schedule.
[03:32:19.300 --> 03:32:21.300]  I believe
[03:32:21.540 --> 03:32:23.540]  we have Brandon
[03:32:23.540 --> 03:32:25.540]  and Marco up next.
[03:32:27.540 --> 03:32:29.540]  I don't know in what order.
[03:32:31.540 --> 03:32:33.540]  Yes.
[03:33:01.280 --> 03:33:03.280]  Lucas, we were just talking about you, brother.
[03:33:03.280 --> 03:33:05.280]  We would love to have you on too
[03:33:05.520 --> 03:33:07.520]  and we are going to make it happen.
[03:33:09.520 --> 03:33:11.520]  With this man right here.
[03:33:11.520 --> 03:33:13.520]  There is Lucas.
[03:33:17.520 --> 03:33:19.520]  I was just telling everybody
[03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:21.520]  about the data entry
[03:33:21.520 --> 03:33:23.520]  I was doing.
[03:33:23.520 --> 03:33:25.520]  As you can see.
[03:33:27.520 --> 03:33:29.520]  I don't have to send you the link.
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:31.520]  I can do it for you.
[03:33:31.520 --> 03:33:33.520]  Give me one second.
[03:33:35.520 --> 03:33:39.620]  Look at that.
[03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:52.910]  This was fun by the way.
[03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:54.910]  My data entry journey today.
[03:33:54.910 --> 03:33:56.910]  Lucas originally
[03:33:56.910 --> 03:33:58.910]  sent me
[03:33:58.910 --> 03:34:00.910]  Lime Breath Reserve F2
[03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:02.910]  and then he sent a bunch of
[03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:04.910]  new stuff
[03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:06.910]  and my confusion was
[03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:08.910]  it seems like it is not quite the same thing.
[03:34:08.910 --> 03:34:10.910]  There is an F1 and an F2.
[03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:12.910]  Now we have them both up.
[03:34:14.910 --> 03:34:16.910]  This is new.
[03:34:16.910 --> 03:34:18.910]  The Lime Cookies
[03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:20.910]  are new to the site.
[03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:24.910]  And the Black Lime Reserve.
[03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:26.910]  I think he restocked all the other stuff
[03:34:26.910 --> 03:34:28.910]  and those ones are new.
[03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:34.880]  Well, fortunately
[03:34:38.880 --> 03:34:40.880]  I was just... Oh my god, people.
[03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:44.880]  I was telling everyone
[03:34:45.120 --> 03:34:47.120]  I'm on 707 Seabank
[03:34:47.120 --> 03:34:49.120]  with 24 different lines.
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:53.120]  I'm on number 1 still.
[03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:56.160]  Thank you, Tank.
[03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:00.160]  First time commenter.
[03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:02.160]  First time chat participant.
[03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:10.560]  This is Manu Chow.
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:12.800]  This song...
[03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:21.200]  I'm trying to remember what song this is.
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:25.200]  I haven't listened to Manu Chow
[03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:27.200]  in years.
[03:36:27.200 --> 03:36:29.200]  I decided I needed
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:31.200]  to
[03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:33.200]  revisit some old stuff
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:35.200]  that makes me happy.
[03:36:47.200 --> 03:36:49.200]  I agree with this.
[03:36:53.200 --> 03:36:55.200]  This too.
[03:36:59.200 --> 03:37:01.200]  That's perpetual.
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:03.200]  Really?
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:05.200]  Let me look at those prices.
[03:37:05.200 --> 03:37:07.200]  We got one for $200.
[03:37:07.200 --> 03:37:09.200]  We got $60, $80, $80, $60, $60, $80.
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:11.440]  $60, $60, $80.
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:19.440]  In the greeter world, those are
[03:37:19.440 --> 03:37:21.440]  fairly reasonable prices.
[03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:23.440]  Mr. Toad has the
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:27.440]  lowest prices in the game.
[03:37:29.440 --> 03:37:31.440]  This party has a variety
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:33.440]  of price points.
[03:37:33.440 --> 03:37:35.440]  Lots of low price points.
[03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:49.510]  Boy.
[03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:51.510]  We had a sighting
[03:37:51.510 --> 03:38:04.190]  and then they disappeared.
[03:38:04.190 --> 03:38:06.190]  Anyway, my visions
[03:38:06.190 --> 03:38:08.190]  of having a venue
[03:38:08.190 --> 03:38:10.190]  I would be very satisfied
[03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:12.190]  to have these guys
[03:38:12.190 --> 03:38:14.190]  come rockin' it.
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:39.040]  Shutterbob, get off the couch.
[03:38:46.410 --> 03:38:48.410]  That is true.
[03:38:48.410 --> 03:38:50.410]  That's why I always tell you you need to add
[03:38:50.410 --> 03:38:52.410]  some higher price points.
[03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:56.410]  You're working just as hard.
[03:39:00.410 --> 03:39:02.410]  Bob's cheddar.
[03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:20.950]  Alex, I look forward
[03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:22.950]  to my data entry
[03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:24.950]  future.
[03:39:38.990 --> 03:39:40.990]  I'm
[03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:42.990]  sick of it.
[03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:58.960]  The violin.
[03:40:04.960 --> 03:40:06.960]  I'm not a violinist.
[03:40:10.960 --> 03:40:12.960]  Thank you, brothers and sisters.
[03:40:12.960 --> 03:40:14.960]  See you soon.
[03:40:14.960 --> 03:40:16.960]  Here they come.
[03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:24.490]  Oh, wait. I think I turned his audio down.
[03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:30.490]  Appreciate it.
[03:40:30.490 --> 03:40:32.490]  Alright, guys.
[03:40:32.490 --> 03:40:34.490]  We're gonna get ourselves settled back in.
[03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:36.490]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[03:40:38.490 --> 03:40:40.490]  We're gonna get settled back in here for everybody.
[03:40:40.730 --> 03:40:42.730]  Future Canvas project as well.
[03:40:42.730 --> 03:40:44.730]  CDD, DJ.
[03:40:46.730 --> 03:40:48.730]  Quiet, sir.
[03:40:48.730 --> 03:40:50.730]  We're gonna get
[03:40:50.730 --> 03:40:52.730]  everything started here again.
[03:40:52.730 --> 03:40:54.730]  In my opinion, Solve Canvas is the future.
[03:40:54.730 --> 03:40:56.730]  If you guys understand that, especially
[03:40:56.730 --> 03:40:58.730]  if you're newer to this,
[03:40:58.730 --> 03:41:00.730]  that's gonna be something that
[03:41:00.730 --> 03:41:02.730]  we're building a blueprint
[03:41:02.730 --> 03:41:04.730]  if you will for some of the best and brightest
[03:41:04.730 --> 03:41:06.730]  that I personally know here.
[03:41:06.730 --> 03:41:08.730]  Hopefully in time, this community will grow
[03:41:08.970 --> 03:41:10.970]  where a lot of us can talk about
[03:41:10.970 --> 03:41:12.970]  the static tech or something that even
[03:41:12.970 --> 03:41:14.970]  in other states is brand new.
[03:41:14.970 --> 03:41:16.970]  To have that knowledge already
[03:41:16.970 --> 03:41:18.970]  here at Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're gonna be ahead of the game
[03:41:18.970 --> 03:41:20.970]  if that's something that you're interested in.
[03:41:20.970 --> 03:41:22.970]  Mr. Arlie Boyd,
[03:41:22.970 --> 03:41:24.970]  he is our next speaker.
[03:41:26.970 --> 03:41:28.970]  In my opinion,
[03:41:28.970 --> 03:41:30.970]  these are gentlemen that I met
[03:41:30.970 --> 03:41:32.970]  just pretty recently.
[03:41:32.970 --> 03:41:34.970]  I feel like when you judge
[03:41:34.970 --> 03:41:36.970]  concentrate, solve, and list self
[03:41:37.210 --> 03:41:39.210]  on the next level, he is one of those.
[03:41:39.210 --> 03:41:41.210]  Again, shout out to Danny for going out of his way
[03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:43.210]  to explain things.
[03:41:43.210 --> 03:41:45.210]  We have Arlie here that's gonna explain his things
[03:41:45.210 --> 03:41:47.210]  from his side of things, from his eyes
[03:41:47.210 --> 03:41:49.210]  that I also feel like is going to
[03:41:49.210 --> 03:41:51.210]  agree with what Danny said
[03:41:51.210 --> 03:41:53.210]  but also might disagree a little bit.
[03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:55.210]  That's what we also love to see
[03:41:55.210 --> 03:41:57.210]  is a little bit of debate
[03:41:57.210 --> 03:41:59.210]  without any kind of bullshit
[03:41:59.210 --> 03:42:01.210]  hate from someone just because you
[03:42:01.210 --> 03:42:03.210]  disagree with them. Arlie, appreciate it, brother.
[03:42:09.060 --> 03:42:11.060]  Hello, I appreciate
[03:42:11.060 --> 03:42:13.060]  everybody coming out. It's pretty sweet
[03:42:13.060 --> 03:42:15.060]  to look out and see a whole room of people
[03:42:15.060 --> 03:42:17.060]  that want to
[03:42:17.060 --> 03:42:19.060]  come and sit in a room and
[03:42:19.060 --> 03:42:21.060]  learn instead of just
[03:42:21.060 --> 03:42:23.060]  party all day. It's pretty cool.
[03:42:23.060 --> 03:42:25.060]  One thing that I
[03:42:25.060 --> 03:42:27.060]  noticed about the Oklahoma
[03:42:27.060 --> 03:42:29.060]  industry pretty early that really brought
[03:42:29.060 --> 03:42:31.060]  me here was that thirst for knowledge
[03:42:31.060 --> 03:42:33.060]  and a sincere want
[03:42:33.060 --> 03:42:35.060]  to understand the product
[03:42:35.060 --> 03:42:37.060]  and not just rep a cool brand.
[03:42:37.300 --> 03:42:39.300]  Like you said, my name
[03:42:39.300 --> 03:42:41.300]  is Arlie.
[03:42:41.300 --> 03:42:43.300]  I watch
[03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:45.300]  Hash for Smith Valley.
[03:42:45.300 --> 03:42:47.300]  We're over in Stillwater. My Instagram
[03:42:47.300 --> 03:42:49.300]  is Lost Roots Hash.
[03:42:49.300 --> 03:42:51.300]  I guess
[03:42:51.300 --> 03:42:53.300]  normally I don't explain it but that name
[03:42:53.300 --> 03:42:55.300]  sort of came from, I was in the
[03:42:55.300 --> 03:42:57.300]  Lost Sierra region
[03:42:57.300 --> 03:42:59.300]  of Sierra Nevada
[03:42:59.300 --> 03:43:01.300]  so I was making hash there and needed a name
[03:43:01.300 --> 03:43:03.300]  for it so I picked Lost Sierra.
[03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:05.300]  I moved
[03:43:05.540 --> 03:43:07.540]  from there and didn't really find it fitting
[03:43:07.540 --> 03:43:09.540]  since I wasn't there anymore so I
[03:43:09.540 --> 03:43:11.540]  started thinking about what I was going to call myself
[03:43:11.540 --> 03:43:13.540]  and at the time I was
[03:43:13.540 --> 03:43:15.540]  making solenless extracts which
[03:43:15.540 --> 03:43:17.540]  is like, people would sort of
[03:43:17.540 --> 03:43:19.540]  say like solenless is the future.
[03:43:19.540 --> 03:43:21.540]  To me it's sort of like
[03:43:21.540 --> 03:43:23.540]  solenless is like we're like working
[03:43:23.540 --> 03:43:25.540]  in reverse because like the first
[03:43:25.540 --> 03:43:27.540]  like cannabis I was
[03:43:27.540 --> 03:43:29.540]  consumed wasn't necessarily like smoking
[03:43:29.540 --> 03:43:31.540]  a flower. It was technically like an extract
[03:43:31.540 --> 03:43:33.540]  of the cannabis plant
[03:43:33.780 --> 03:43:35.780]  of the resin off of that plant.
[03:43:35.780 --> 03:43:37.780]  So
[03:43:37.780 --> 03:43:39.780]  we like, we went from that
[03:43:39.780 --> 03:43:41.780]  to flower to
[03:43:41.780 --> 03:43:43.780]  using hydrocarbon distillation
[03:43:43.780 --> 03:43:45.780]  and things like that to get it and then
[03:43:45.780 --> 03:43:47.780]  we figure out, you know,
[03:43:47.780 --> 03:43:49.780]  later on that the original
[03:43:49.780 --> 03:43:51.780]  way to do it was
[03:43:51.780 --> 03:43:53.780]  not the only way but a great way to do it.
[03:43:53.780 --> 03:43:55.780]  So a little about
[03:43:55.780 --> 03:43:57.780]  me, I grew up here in
[03:43:57.780 --> 03:43:59.780]  northwest Oklahoma
[03:43:59.780 --> 03:44:01.780]  kind of like a lot of people
[03:44:02.020 --> 03:44:04.020]  in the state I grew up like smoking weed.
[03:44:04.020 --> 03:44:06.020]  Called it that, bought it
[03:44:06.020 --> 03:44:08.020]  just like that. It was weed.
[03:44:08.020 --> 03:44:10.020]  You know, we heard different names
[03:44:10.020 --> 03:44:12.020]  every now and then but most of the time
[03:44:12.020 --> 03:44:14.020]  it wasn't and I didn't really understand
[03:44:14.020 --> 03:44:16.020]  that I was
[03:44:16.020 --> 03:44:18.020]  ingesting the trichomes on the flower
[03:44:18.020 --> 03:44:20.020]  to get medicated. I wasn't
[03:44:20.020 --> 03:44:22.020]  necessarily looking for the flower.
[03:44:22.020 --> 03:44:24.020]  I moved out to
[03:44:24.020 --> 03:44:26.020]  Washington with the intent to go
[03:44:26.020 --> 03:44:28.020]  out there and learn and
[03:44:28.020 --> 03:44:30.020]  you know, because
[03:44:30.260 --> 03:44:32.260]  I kind of had a feeling that maybe
[03:44:32.260 --> 03:44:34.260]  one day I might be able to move home and
[03:44:34.260 --> 03:44:36.260]  do what I love here and
[03:44:36.260 --> 03:44:38.260]  if I couldn't I would stay out there but
[03:44:38.260 --> 03:44:40.260]  luckily I was able to come home.
[03:44:40.260 --> 03:44:42.260]  Whenever I first got out there I started
[03:44:42.260 --> 03:44:44.260]  working for a really large growth
[03:44:44.260 --> 03:44:46.260]  they were getting
[03:44:46.260 --> 03:44:48.260]  $4,000 a pound.
[03:44:48.260 --> 03:44:50.260]  They were harvesting about
[03:44:50.260 --> 03:44:52.260]  like 140,
[03:44:52.260 --> 03:44:54.260]  160 pounds a month
[03:44:54.260 --> 03:44:56.260]  and it was
[03:44:56.260 --> 03:44:58.260]  you know, it had great bag
[03:44:58.500 --> 03:45:00.500]  and it sold really well but
[03:45:00.500 --> 03:45:02.500]  I would take it home and I would have these
[03:45:02.500 --> 03:45:04.500]  8 different really nice looking flowers
[03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:06.500]  and I would put them all in my pipe
[03:45:06.500 --> 03:45:08.500]  and I would hit it and maybe
[03:45:08.500 --> 03:45:10.500]  one of the 8 would
[03:45:10.500 --> 03:45:12.500]  really, really taste good.
[03:45:12.500 --> 03:45:14.500]  This was like a state of the art
[03:45:14.500 --> 03:45:16.500]  $12 million facility
[03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:18.500]  and I had
[03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:20.500]  a homie at the time that had 4 lights
[03:45:20.500 --> 03:45:22.500]  in his garage and
[03:45:22.500 --> 03:45:24.500]  he was doing
[03:45:24.500 --> 03:45:26.500]  all organic living soil
[03:45:26.740 --> 03:45:28.740]  and I was like, I'm going to go to the hotel
[03:45:28.740 --> 03:45:30.740]  inside and I went over there
[03:45:30.740 --> 03:45:32.740]  and it was just like, the nugs weren't quite
[03:45:32.740 --> 03:45:34.740]  as huge
[03:45:34.740 --> 03:45:36.740]  and it wasn't a $12 million
[03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:38.740]  facility but the nugs that I got
[03:45:38.740 --> 03:45:40.740]  for him I loved
[03:45:40.740 --> 03:45:42.740]  and I would look at them and they
[03:45:42.740 --> 03:45:44.740]  taste exactly like they smell
[03:45:44.740 --> 03:45:46.740]  even through a dirty spoon pipe
[03:45:46.740 --> 03:45:48.740]  and so I'm like, it got the wheels turning
[03:45:48.740 --> 03:45:50.740]  and I'm like, there's something here
[03:45:50.740 --> 03:45:52.740]  that makes this different
[03:45:52.740 --> 03:45:54.740]  than what we have
[03:45:54.980 --> 03:45:56.980]  I started doing a lot of research
[03:45:56.980 --> 03:45:58.980]  and realized that
[03:45:58.980 --> 03:46:00.980]  like the first
[03:46:00.980 --> 03:46:02.980]  guy said, that a lot of
[03:46:02.980 --> 03:46:04.980]  the plant, a lot of that taste, it doesn't necessarily
[03:46:04.980 --> 03:46:06.980]  come from the flower, it comes from the soil
[03:46:06.980 --> 03:46:08.980]  and what is in the soil
[03:46:08.980 --> 03:46:10.980]  and the plant, in my
[03:46:10.980 --> 03:46:12.980]  opinion, it knows what it needs
[03:46:12.980 --> 03:46:14.980]  more than we do, it knows what it wants
[03:46:14.980 --> 03:46:16.980]  more than we do at the
[03:46:16.980 --> 03:46:18.980]  specific time and
[03:46:18.980 --> 03:46:20.980]  so I feel like people like
[03:46:20.980 --> 03:46:22.980]  Brandon and
[03:46:23.220 --> 03:46:25.220]  people like that, what they do is
[03:46:25.220 --> 03:46:27.220]  they like provide
[03:46:27.220 --> 03:46:29.220]  the tools for the plant
[03:46:29.220 --> 03:46:31.220]  to use to get strong, they don't
[03:46:31.220 --> 03:46:33.220]  necessarily put a
[03:46:33.220 --> 03:46:35.220]  like a, you know, like an IV
[03:46:35.220 --> 03:46:37.220]  in its arm and say, I'm gonna make you
[03:46:37.220 --> 03:46:39.220]  strong, it's like, here's the medicine
[03:46:39.220 --> 03:46:41.220]  if you want to take it and get stronger and stronger
[03:46:41.220 --> 03:46:43.220]  and it does, and that's where
[03:46:43.220 --> 03:46:45.220]  the good, tight tasting, melty
[03:46:45.220 --> 03:46:47.220]  ash comes from
[03:46:47.220 --> 03:46:49.220]  one of the cool
[03:46:49.220 --> 03:46:51.220]  things about Oklahoma that I noticed
[03:46:51.460 --> 03:46:53.460]  maybe the yields that I get
[03:46:53.460 --> 03:46:55.460]  from
[03:46:55.460 --> 03:46:57.460]  both ash are quite as like
[03:46:57.460 --> 03:46:59.460]  high on average as maybe somewhere
[03:46:59.460 --> 03:47:01.460]  in Washington, California
[03:47:01.460 --> 03:47:03.460]  but of what I
[03:47:03.460 --> 03:47:05.460]  do get, the percentage that I do get
[03:47:05.460 --> 03:47:07.460]  it's a lot more melty
[03:47:07.460 --> 03:47:09.460]  than
[03:47:09.460 --> 03:47:11.460]  ash that's in California
[03:47:11.460 --> 03:47:13.460]  or Washington state. What's causing
[03:47:13.460 --> 03:47:15.460]  that, I don't necessarily know whether it
[03:47:15.460 --> 03:47:17.460]  might be the humidity, it might be
[03:47:17.460 --> 03:47:19.460]  you know, the sun, whatever it does
[03:47:19.700 --> 03:47:21.700]  it really likes the environment
[03:47:21.700 --> 03:47:23.700]  here
[03:47:23.700 --> 03:47:25.700]  so yeah
[03:47:25.700 --> 03:47:27.700]  I also have to
[03:47:27.700 --> 03:47:29.700]  make a few notes every now and then
[03:47:29.700 --> 03:47:31.700]  and also if you guys
[03:47:31.700 --> 03:47:33.700]  have any questions really throughout this
[03:47:33.700 --> 03:47:35.700]  feel free to ask, I'm not going to
[03:47:35.700 --> 03:47:37.700]  necessarily throw anything out
[03:47:39.700 --> 03:47:41.700]  so one of the things
[03:47:41.700 --> 03:47:43.700]  that I was going to talk about
[03:47:43.700 --> 03:47:45.700]  was sort of
[03:47:45.700 --> 03:47:47.700]  as like a patient
[03:47:47.940 --> 03:47:49.940]  if you're going to go to the store
[03:47:49.940 --> 03:47:51.940]  you know, they don't let you
[03:47:51.940 --> 03:47:53.940]  say, hey let me take a dab of that, let me take a dab
[03:47:53.940 --> 03:47:55.940]  of that, let me take a dab of that
[03:47:55.940 --> 03:47:57.940]  and I'll buy it at the salon, so it's kind of on you
[03:47:57.940 --> 03:47:59.940]  so long as
[03:47:59.940 --> 03:48:01.940]  you know, you can go to the store
[03:48:01.940 --> 03:48:03.940]  and you can get
[03:48:03.940 --> 03:48:05.940]  11 grams of VHO in a jar
[03:48:05.940 --> 03:48:07.940]  with diamonds in it for $100
[03:48:07.940 --> 03:48:09.940]  whereas my
[03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:11.940]  gram of ash is more like
[03:48:11.940 --> 03:48:13.940]  $65 to $80
[03:48:13.940 --> 03:48:15.940]  so the justification of something
[03:48:16.180 --> 03:48:18.180]  that's 8 to 9 times more expensive
[03:48:18.180 --> 03:48:20.180]  than one, it's like why would I ever use
[03:48:20.180 --> 03:48:22.180]  saltless
[03:48:22.180 --> 03:48:24.180]  over VHO
[03:48:24.180 --> 03:48:26.180]  and so I sort of just
[03:48:26.180 --> 03:48:28.180]  want to touch on some of those things
[03:48:28.180 --> 03:48:30.180]  and then sort of like
[03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:32.180]  I've been doing this for around
[03:48:32.180 --> 03:48:34.180]  10 years, I've seen a lot of ash
[03:48:34.180 --> 03:48:36.180]  I've smoked a lot of ash, I've been exposed to a lot of ash
[03:48:36.180 --> 03:48:38.180]  I'm very
[03:48:38.180 --> 03:48:40.180]  very fortunate in that
[03:48:40.180 --> 03:48:42.180]  I've been able to do that
[03:48:42.180 --> 03:48:44.180]  I feel like that's
[03:48:44.420 --> 03:48:46.420]  really hard to learn a lot of things
[03:48:46.420 --> 03:48:48.420]  in this industry without exposure to it
[03:48:48.420 --> 03:48:50.420]  you can be told over and over and over
[03:48:50.420 --> 03:48:52.420]  until you see it and try it
[03:48:52.420 --> 03:48:54.420]  smoke it, it's really hard to
[03:48:54.420 --> 03:48:56.420]  understand some of those things
[03:48:56.420 --> 03:48:58.420]  so
[03:48:58.420 --> 03:49:00.420]  like one of the things is
[03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:02.420]  whenever you go into the dispensary people are like
[03:49:02.420 --> 03:49:04.420]  what does good ash look like
[03:49:04.420 --> 03:49:06.420]  well, there's
[03:49:06.420 --> 03:49:08.420]  not necessarily like a definitive
[03:49:08.420 --> 03:49:10.420]  this is what good ash looks like
[03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:12.420]  because it's kind of like
[03:49:12.660 --> 03:49:14.660]  what is a good person look like
[03:49:14.660 --> 03:49:16.660]  there's a lot of good people out there
[03:49:16.660 --> 03:49:18.660]  so you can go in
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:20.660]  color is like one thing
[03:49:20.660 --> 03:49:22.660]  so you look at it
[03:49:22.660 --> 03:49:24.660]  the light color, the dark
[03:49:24.660 --> 03:49:26.660]  color, there's a lot of things that play
[03:49:26.660 --> 03:49:28.660]  into the dark color, a lot of people
[03:49:28.660 --> 03:49:30.660]  associate dark color with
[03:49:30.660 --> 03:49:32.660]  negative traits
[03:49:32.660 --> 03:49:34.660]  so like
[03:49:34.660 --> 03:49:36.660]  that has to do with the
[03:49:36.660 --> 03:49:38.660]  maturity of the trichrome head
[03:49:38.660 --> 03:49:40.660]  whenever it's harvested
[03:49:40.900 --> 03:49:42.900]  maybe it was fresh frozen
[03:49:42.900 --> 03:49:44.900]  maybe it was cured for a short amount of time
[03:49:44.900 --> 03:49:46.900]  maybe it was cured for a long amount of time
[03:49:46.900 --> 03:49:48.900]  maybe it was going to be sold
[03:49:48.900 --> 03:49:50.900]  as flour and it got old
[03:49:50.900 --> 03:49:52.900]  and so they washed it
[03:49:52.900 --> 03:49:54.900]  you can have some stuff
[03:49:54.900 --> 03:49:56.900]  that look pretty similar
[03:49:56.900 --> 03:49:58.900]  one you'll take home and it'll taste like it smells
[03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:00.900]  and one you'll take home and it'll taste like churn
[03:50:00.900 --> 03:50:02.900]  and so you can be let down
[03:50:02.900 --> 03:50:04.900]  you're like man, I wish I would have
[03:50:04.900 --> 03:50:06.900]  spent my money on the other jar
[03:50:06.900 --> 03:50:08.900]  so what are some questions
[03:50:09.140 --> 03:50:11.140]  that you can ask the bud tender
[03:50:11.140 --> 03:50:13.140]  that maybe they
[03:50:13.140 --> 03:50:15.140]  maybe they don't know but they should
[03:50:15.140 --> 03:50:17.140]  know, if you're going to be spending $80
[03:50:17.140 --> 03:50:19.140]  on a jar of oil
[03:50:19.140 --> 03:50:21.140]  you should say
[03:50:21.140 --> 03:50:23.140]  what farm grew this
[03:50:23.140 --> 03:50:25.140]  and they should be able to
[03:50:25.140 --> 03:50:27.140]  tell you which farm grew
[03:50:27.140 --> 03:50:29.140]  the oil
[03:50:29.140 --> 03:50:31.140]  where that ash came from
[03:50:31.140 --> 03:50:33.140]  and then you should say is it
[03:50:33.140 --> 03:50:35.140]  grown organically, is it grown
[03:50:35.140 --> 03:50:37.140]  in soil, is it grown
[03:50:37.380 --> 03:50:39.380]  hydroponically, is it grown
[03:50:39.380 --> 03:50:41.380]  are they using, what are they using
[03:50:41.380 --> 03:50:43.380]  so at that point
[03:50:43.380 --> 03:50:45.380]  if it's a darker color
[03:50:45.380 --> 03:50:47.380]  I'm going to say
[03:50:47.380 --> 03:50:49.380]  was this grown in organic
[03:50:49.380 --> 03:50:51.380]  soil, and if they
[03:50:51.380 --> 03:50:53.380]  know and they say oh yeah
[03:50:53.380 --> 03:50:55.380]  it's an organic farm and they know about it
[03:50:55.380 --> 03:50:57.380]  the color is basically going to go out
[03:50:57.380 --> 03:50:59.380]  that's the picture at that point
[03:50:59.380 --> 03:51:01.380]  and then I'm going to look at basically the production date
[03:51:01.380 --> 03:51:03.380]  I'll tell you when it's made
[03:51:03.380 --> 03:51:05.380]  how old it is
[03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:07.620]  so if it's
[03:51:07.620 --> 03:51:09.620]  if it's outdoor, like full term
[03:51:09.620 --> 03:51:11.620]  outdoor and it's July
[03:51:11.620 --> 03:51:13.620]  you know that it's 6 months old
[03:51:15.620 --> 03:51:17.620]  if it's December
[03:51:17.620 --> 03:51:19.620]  of next year you know it's either
[03:51:19.620 --> 03:51:21.620]  really fresh or it's really old
[03:51:21.620 --> 03:51:23.620]  so that can give you a tip
[03:51:23.620 --> 03:51:25.620]  if they let you
[03:51:25.620 --> 03:51:27.620]  if you're in a state where you can open it up
[03:51:27.620 --> 03:51:29.620]  and you can smell it, that's a pretty easy one
[03:51:29.620 --> 03:51:31.620]  I don't have to tell you
[03:51:31.620 --> 03:51:33.620]  if it smells good to you, it smells good to you
[03:51:33.860 --> 03:51:35.860]  some people open up a jar and it smells like Jack
[03:51:35.860 --> 03:51:37.860]  and they absolutely hate it
[03:51:37.860 --> 03:51:39.860]  some people open it up and they love it
[03:51:39.860 --> 03:51:41.860]  so the smell of it
[03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:43.860]  if you can smell it
[03:51:43.860 --> 03:51:45.860]  that's sort of a touchy situation though
[03:51:47.860 --> 03:51:49.860]  because
[03:51:49.860 --> 03:51:51.860]  Ryan was asking me earlier
[03:51:51.860 --> 03:51:53.860]  he was, the question that he had
[03:51:53.860 --> 03:51:55.860]  I can't remember how exactly he worded it
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:51:57.860]  but basically the difference
[03:51:57.860 --> 03:51:59.860]  in the consistencies
[03:51:59.860 --> 03:52:01.860]  so there is like a
[03:52:02.100 --> 03:52:04.100]  fresh press which is like more of a
[03:52:04.100 --> 03:52:06.100]  translucent sap in the jar
[03:52:06.100 --> 03:52:08.100]  most people will press it thin and make it
[03:52:08.100 --> 03:52:10.100]  more of a coin
[03:52:10.100 --> 03:52:12.100]  and then there's the batter
[03:52:12.100 --> 03:52:14.100]  which is pretty stable
[03:52:14.100 --> 03:52:16.100]  it's easy to work with, you can get it
[03:52:16.100 --> 03:52:18.100]  out of the jar and then there
[03:52:18.100 --> 03:52:20.100]  is like the jar tip, like saucy
[03:52:20.100 --> 03:52:22.100]  diamond type consistency
[03:52:22.100 --> 03:52:24.100]  so he asked
[03:52:24.100 --> 03:52:26.100]  me like I think what I
[03:52:26.100 --> 03:52:28.100]  prefer to make
[03:52:28.100 --> 03:52:30.100]  um
[03:52:30.340 --> 03:52:32.340]  consistency wise and I was
[03:52:32.340 --> 03:52:34.340]  telling him that it's kind of touchy
[03:52:34.340 --> 03:52:36.340]  because what I would prefer
[03:52:36.340 --> 03:52:38.340]  to make would be like a fresh press
[03:52:38.340 --> 03:52:40.340]  coin that's put into
[03:52:40.340 --> 03:52:42.340]  the refrigerator and kept there
[03:52:42.340 --> 03:52:44.340]  until like
[03:52:44.340 --> 03:52:46.340]  3 minutes before you want to smoke it
[03:52:46.340 --> 03:52:48.340]  get it out, let it come to room temp, get your dab out
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:50.340]  put it back in the refrigerator
[03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:52.340]  I smoke a lot of dabs
[03:52:52.340 --> 03:52:54.340]  I don't do that, I understand
[03:52:54.340 --> 03:52:56.340]  I'd be back and forth to the fridge all day
[03:52:56.340 --> 03:52:58.340]  I guess you can't do that
[03:52:58.580 --> 03:53:00.580]  but in a perfect world I would like to do that
[03:53:00.580 --> 03:53:02.580]  one of the reasons that I don't
[03:53:02.580 --> 03:53:04.580]  though is because whenever it comes
[03:53:04.580 --> 03:53:06.580]  to the patients
[03:53:06.580 --> 03:53:08.580]  buying it at the store they'll
[03:53:08.580 --> 03:53:10.580]  open the jar and if it's a fresh
[03:53:10.580 --> 03:53:12.580]  press coin, one of the positives
[03:53:12.580 --> 03:53:14.580]  about the fresh press coin
[03:53:14.580 --> 03:53:16.580]  is it makes the terpenes that are in it
[03:53:16.580 --> 03:53:18.580]  are super stable, they're not
[03:53:18.580 --> 03:53:20.580]  as volatile and they're like locked
[03:53:20.580 --> 03:53:22.580]  in that sap
[03:53:22.580 --> 03:53:24.580]  that keeps them in there
[03:53:24.580 --> 03:53:26.580]  so whenever you pop it open
[03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:28.820]  you won't get much of a smell off of it
[03:53:28.820 --> 03:53:30.820]  which to me, that's good
[03:53:30.820 --> 03:53:32.820]  because whenever you take it
[03:53:32.820 --> 03:53:34.820]  and you dab it, you get all of that
[03:53:34.820 --> 03:53:36.820]  if you can smell it, it's because it's
[03:53:36.820 --> 03:53:38.820]  burning off
[03:53:38.820 --> 03:53:40.820]  like in your room
[03:53:40.820 --> 03:53:42.820]  you can smell, like you walk
[03:53:42.820 --> 03:53:44.820]  in your grow room and you can smell that flower
[03:53:44.820 --> 03:53:46.820]  because there's terpenes off-gassing it
[03:53:46.820 --> 03:53:48.820]  if they're not off-gassing, then you wouldn't be able to
[03:53:48.820 --> 03:53:50.820]  smell it, the same goes with your jar
[03:53:50.820 --> 03:53:52.820]  patch, so whenever you
[03:53:52.820 --> 03:53:54.820]  buy a jar of
[03:53:55.060 --> 03:53:57.060]  say like a saucy
[03:53:57.060 --> 03:53:59.060]  more jam consistency
[03:53:59.060 --> 03:54:01.060]  like that and you open it up, it's really loud
[03:54:01.060 --> 03:54:03.060]  and you can smell it from
[03:54:03.060 --> 03:54:05.060]  this far away, in the
[03:54:05.060 --> 03:54:07.060]  store, to someone like
[03:54:07.060 --> 03:54:09.060]  me, that's great because that's a huge
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:11.060]  selling point, they open up the jar
[03:54:11.060 --> 03:54:13.060]  and it really blows them away by the smell of it
[03:54:13.060 --> 03:54:15.060]  but my fresh press
[03:54:15.060 --> 03:54:17.060]  coin can go home, go into their
[03:54:17.060 --> 03:54:19.060]  refrigerator and in six months it's going to taste
[03:54:19.060 --> 03:54:21.060]  exactly like it did today
[03:54:21.060 --> 03:54:23.060]  whereas with like
[03:54:23.300 --> 03:54:25.300]  a fresh press, or with a jam
[03:54:25.300 --> 03:54:27.300]  something that's jar-type like that, you can smell
[03:54:27.300 --> 03:54:29.300]  it because the terpenes that are there
[03:54:29.300 --> 03:54:31.300]  are very volatile and so
[03:54:31.300 --> 03:54:33.300]  they're off-gassing at a
[03:54:33.300 --> 03:54:35.300]  way higher rate, just at room temperature
[03:54:35.300 --> 03:54:37.300]  and so, though
[03:54:37.300 --> 03:54:39.300]  it's going to be less of a product
[03:54:39.300 --> 03:54:41.300]  the longer it goes
[03:54:41.300 --> 03:54:43.300]  because there's certain things that go
[03:54:43.300 --> 03:54:45.300]  into a great thing, it's
[03:54:45.300 --> 03:54:47.300]  exposure to oxygen, light,
[03:54:47.300 --> 03:54:49.300]  heat, and time
[03:54:49.300 --> 03:54:51.300]  and so by
[03:54:51.540 --> 03:54:53.540]  putting it into a dark jar
[03:54:53.540 --> 03:54:55.540]  putting it into a cold place
[03:54:55.540 --> 03:54:57.540]  it slows down a lot of those but time
[03:54:57.540 --> 03:54:59.540]  really isn't one of the ones that you can
[03:54:59.540 --> 03:55:01.540]  take away
[03:55:01.540 --> 03:55:03.540]  so that sort of goes into
[03:55:05.540 --> 03:55:07.540]  fresh frozen versus
[03:55:07.540 --> 03:55:09.540]  cured, whenever it comes to that
[03:55:09.540 --> 03:55:11.540]  so
[03:55:11.540 --> 03:55:13.540]  there was the mention of chlorophyll
[03:55:13.540 --> 03:55:15.540]  one of the things
[03:55:15.540 --> 03:55:17.540]  that I sort of
[03:55:17.540 --> 03:55:19.540]  look at differently, I guess
[03:55:19.780 --> 03:55:21.780]  because you already heard it the other way
[03:55:21.780 --> 03:55:23.780]  I think like, if you
[03:55:23.780 --> 03:55:25.780]  are thinking about making tea
[03:55:25.780 --> 03:55:27.780]  you put in
[03:55:27.780 --> 03:55:29.780]  dry tea into
[03:55:29.780 --> 03:55:31.780]  the water and it makes
[03:55:31.780 --> 03:55:33.780]  tea so much quicker than if
[03:55:33.780 --> 03:55:35.780]  you put a fresh tea leaf
[03:55:35.780 --> 03:55:37.780]  into the water, the same
[03:55:37.780 --> 03:55:39.780]  thing goes with the cannabis
[03:55:39.780 --> 03:55:41.780]  and getting the chlorophyll into
[03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:43.780]  the water that you're washing with
[03:55:43.780 --> 03:55:45.780]  it's like, I can
[03:55:45.780 --> 03:55:47.780]  put fresh frozen into
[03:55:48.020 --> 03:55:50.020]  my barrel and I can expose it to
[03:55:50.020 --> 03:55:52.020]  ice water for
[03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:54.020]  an hour and a half sometimes and my water
[03:55:54.020 --> 03:55:56.020]  won't be green but I
[03:55:56.020 --> 03:55:58.020]  can put a pound of cured
[03:55:58.020 --> 03:56:00.020]  shrimp into my water and after five
[03:56:00.020 --> 03:56:02.020]  minutes it's completely full of
[03:56:02.020 --> 03:56:04.020]  chlorophyll and so
[03:56:06.020 --> 03:56:08.020]  a full leaf will
[03:56:08.020 --> 03:56:10.020]  like if you have an entire
[03:56:10.020 --> 03:56:12.020]  full fan leaf that is fully intact
[03:56:12.020 --> 03:56:14.020]  that will get less
[03:56:14.020 --> 03:56:16.020]  chlorophyll into your water
[03:56:16.260 --> 03:56:18.260]  and if you take that leaf and you cut it
[03:56:18.260 --> 03:56:20.260]  in half and only put half of it
[03:56:20.260 --> 03:56:22.260]  into the machine because the
[03:56:22.260 --> 03:56:24.260]  it's like cutting your hand off and bleeding
[03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:26.260]  out of your arm, it's just like the
[03:56:26.260 --> 03:56:28.260]  chlorophyll bleeds out of that plant
[03:56:28.260 --> 03:56:30.260]  so that's why trim
[03:56:30.260 --> 03:56:32.260]  is lesser
[03:56:32.260 --> 03:56:34.260]  of a product because it has
[03:56:34.260 --> 03:56:36.260]  so much more plant
[03:56:36.260 --> 03:56:38.260]  material to resin
[03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:40.260]  and so whenever you're processing
[03:56:40.260 --> 03:56:42.260]  it there you have so much more
[03:56:42.260 --> 03:56:44.260]  fats and lipids, chlorophyll
[03:56:44.500 --> 03:56:46.500]  that type of stuff that you have to
[03:56:46.500 --> 03:56:48.500]  separate from
[03:56:48.500 --> 03:56:50.500]  the hash that we get and really
[03:56:50.500 --> 03:56:52.500]  all I have is a set of bags
[03:56:52.500 --> 03:56:54.500]  and a spoon so I don't have a lot
[03:56:54.500 --> 03:56:56.500]  at my disposal
[03:56:56.500 --> 03:56:58.500]  to really separate stuff out
[03:56:58.500 --> 03:57:00.500]  really only just the coldness
[03:57:00.500 --> 03:57:02.500]  and the size of the bags
[03:57:02.500 --> 03:57:04.500]  and so at that point I try
[03:57:04.500 --> 03:57:06.500]  to use
[03:57:06.500 --> 03:57:08.500]  a starting material that really
[03:57:08.500 --> 03:57:10.500]  limits what's going to get in here
[03:57:10.500 --> 03:57:12.500]  so if you have something that's really fresh
[03:57:12.740 --> 03:57:14.740]  you let it come up to
[03:57:14.740 --> 03:57:16.740]  you let it properly hydrate
[03:57:16.740 --> 03:57:18.740]  in the ice water, those
[03:57:18.740 --> 03:57:20.740]  leaves are going to bend
[03:57:20.740 --> 03:57:22.740]  instead of break
[03:57:22.740 --> 03:57:24.740]  and so again it's like chopping your hand off
[03:57:24.740 --> 03:57:26.740]  they're going to go like this instead of chopping
[03:57:26.740 --> 03:57:28.740]  your hand off, there's going to be less chlorophyll
[03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:30.740]  and a lot of that type of thing
[03:57:30.740 --> 03:57:32.740]  so whenever you're looking
[03:57:32.740 --> 03:57:34.740]  at the hash
[03:57:34.740 --> 03:57:36.740]  in the store and so it's like
[03:57:36.740 --> 03:57:38.740]  if it's a
[03:57:38.740 --> 03:57:40.740]  saucy jar-tect
[03:57:40.980 --> 03:57:42.980]  consistency, maybe they did that
[03:57:42.980 --> 03:57:44.980]  because they had
[03:57:44.980 --> 03:57:46.980]  800 grams of one
[03:57:46.980 --> 03:57:48.980]  flavor and they wanted to have 200 grams
[03:57:48.980 --> 03:57:50.980]  that were a wet batter and 200 grams
[03:57:50.980 --> 03:57:52.980]  that were a sauce or
[03:57:52.980 --> 03:57:54.980]  maybe it was lesser of a
[03:57:54.980 --> 03:57:56.980]  material and it didn't look that great as like
[03:57:56.980 --> 03:57:58.980]  a fresh pressed coin so they
[03:57:58.980 --> 03:58:00.980]  jar-tected it and made it a more
[03:58:00.980 --> 03:58:02.980]  volatile
[03:58:02.980 --> 03:58:04.980]  form of the
[03:58:04.980 --> 03:58:06.980]  concentrate but it looks better and you can
[03:58:06.980 --> 03:58:08.980]  really really smell it
[03:58:09.220 --> 03:58:11.220]  so that is
[03:58:11.220 --> 03:58:13.220]  really personal preference
[03:58:13.220 --> 03:58:15.220]  I say one of
[03:58:15.220 --> 03:58:17.220]  my ideas was I would like to
[03:58:17.220 --> 03:58:19.220]  sell like 7 gram
[03:58:19.220 --> 03:58:21.220]  jars of basically a fresh
[03:58:21.220 --> 03:58:23.220]  press and then like a candle
[03:58:23.220 --> 03:58:25.220]  warmer that fits to the perfect
[03:58:25.220 --> 03:58:27.220]  temperature so you can do your
[03:58:27.220 --> 03:58:29.220]  own jar-tecting at home
[03:58:29.220 --> 03:58:31.220]  so by the time I
[03:58:31.220 --> 03:58:33.220]  jar-tected it, I sell it
[03:58:33.220 --> 03:58:35.220]  they sell it to you
[03:58:35.220 --> 03:58:37.220]  but when you get it it might be 4 bucks
[03:58:37.460 --> 03:58:39.460]  and those volatile
[03:58:39.460 --> 03:58:41.460]  turkeys have time to evaporate off
[03:58:41.460 --> 03:58:43.460]  that whole time but if you're baking it at home
[03:58:43.460 --> 03:58:45.460]  you know in smaller quantities
[03:58:45.460 --> 03:58:47.460]  like that
[03:58:47.460 --> 03:58:49.460]  we have a question for you, so they want to know
[03:58:49.460 --> 03:58:51.460]  what are the highest temps you can
[03:58:51.460 --> 03:58:53.460]  basically get away with
[03:58:53.460 --> 03:58:55.460]  washing it and then a follow up with
[03:58:55.460 --> 03:58:57.460]  that is what would be the ideal
[03:58:57.460 --> 03:58:59.460]  temp to wash it
[03:58:59.460 --> 03:59:01.460]  temperature
[03:59:01.460 --> 03:59:03.460]  of my cold room?
[03:59:03.460 --> 03:59:05.460]  I believe he was asking
[03:59:05.700 --> 03:59:07.700]  what is the highest temp you can
[03:59:07.700 --> 03:59:09.700]  wash in and get away with it
[03:59:09.700 --> 03:59:11.700]  without messing things up
[03:59:11.700 --> 03:59:13.700]  and then in your opinion what is the ideal
[03:59:13.700 --> 03:59:15.700]  temp to wash it in
[03:59:15.700 --> 03:59:17.700]  I guess like if you're
[03:59:17.700 --> 03:59:19.700]  between a rock and a hard place you absolutely
[03:59:19.700 --> 03:59:21.700]  have to get some stuff
[03:59:21.700 --> 03:59:23.700]  washed and get it out there
[03:59:23.700 --> 03:59:25.700]  and you
[03:59:25.700 --> 03:59:27.700]  I mean I wouldn't really wash anything
[03:59:27.700 --> 03:59:29.700]  over like 60 degrees
[03:59:29.700 --> 03:59:31.700]  fresh frozen is a lot more
[03:59:31.700 --> 03:59:33.700]  unstable than cured material is
[03:59:33.940 --> 03:59:35.940]  they're like little grill light bulbs
[03:59:35.940 --> 03:59:37.940]  whenever they're fresh
[03:59:37.940 --> 03:59:39.940]  so if you don't keep them super
[03:59:39.940 --> 03:59:41.940]  super cold don't want them to either melt
[03:59:41.940 --> 03:59:43.940]  or break open in your washer
[03:59:43.940 --> 03:59:45.940]  once they're cured they're a little
[03:59:45.940 --> 03:59:47.940]  bit more stable
[03:59:47.940 --> 03:59:49.940]  if you handle a plant in your garden
[03:59:49.940 --> 03:59:51.940]  a lot of times your hands get greasy
[03:59:51.940 --> 03:59:53.940]  but if you handle a cured plant
[03:59:53.940 --> 03:59:55.940]  or a cured plant your hand will get more
[03:59:55.940 --> 03:59:57.940]  sandy opposed to the greasy
[03:59:57.940 --> 03:59:59.940]  that's just saying whenever you go to wash it
[03:59:59.940 --> 04:00:01.940]  you want the sandy opposed to the greasy
[04:00:02.180 --> 04:00:04.180]  so I would say for like
[04:00:04.180 --> 04:00:06.180]  a cured material if you
[04:00:06.180 --> 04:00:08.180]  can get somewhere around 50 degrees
[04:00:08.180 --> 04:00:10.180]  and under 60 degrees
[04:00:10.180 --> 04:00:12.180]  you'll probably be alright
[04:00:12.180 --> 04:00:14.180]  with fresh frozen I would say
[04:00:14.180 --> 04:00:16.180]  you probably don't really want to be
[04:00:16.180 --> 04:00:18.180]  anywhere over
[04:00:18.180 --> 04:00:20.180]  50 to 55 degrees
[04:00:20.180 --> 04:00:22.180]  I like to keep my cold room 38
[04:00:22.180 --> 04:00:24.180]  36 degrees
[04:00:24.180 --> 04:00:26.180]  um
[04:00:26.180 --> 04:00:28.180]  that's like what the cool bot says
[04:00:28.180 --> 04:00:30.180]  so I have like a little machine
[04:00:30.420 --> 04:00:32.420]  basically I put my
[04:00:32.420 --> 04:00:34.420]  window unit AC into it
[04:00:34.420 --> 04:00:36.420]  and it just makes my window unit
[04:00:36.420 --> 04:00:38.420]  think it's 80 degrees in my room
[04:00:38.420 --> 04:00:40.420]  despite when it actually is in there
[04:00:40.420 --> 04:00:42.420]  so it just keeps working
[04:00:42.420 --> 04:00:44.420]  it thaws it out for me and lets me
[04:00:44.420 --> 04:00:46.420]  use a window unit and get my room
[04:00:46.420 --> 04:00:48.420]  down to like
[04:00:48.420 --> 04:00:50.420]  if it's under 65 degrees out I can get it
[04:00:50.420 --> 04:00:52.420]  36 degrees in my room
[04:00:52.420 --> 04:00:54.420]  so to me the colder the better
[04:00:54.420 --> 04:00:56.420]  I don't really know
[04:00:56.420 --> 04:00:58.420]  um
[04:00:58.660 --> 04:01:00.660]  if you could somehow get it so cold
[04:01:00.660 --> 04:01:02.660]  that it could be like negative to you
[04:01:02.660 --> 04:01:04.660]  I don't really understand how that could happen
[04:01:04.660 --> 04:01:06.660]  you know I'm trying to
[04:01:06.660 --> 04:01:08.660]  chop the plant
[04:01:08.660 --> 04:01:10.660]  and ok so the reason that I
[04:01:10.660 --> 04:01:12.660]  prefer to use fresh frozen
[04:01:12.660 --> 04:01:14.660]  is because it's a way for me
[04:01:14.660 --> 04:01:16.660]  to just ensure
[04:01:16.660 --> 04:01:18.660]  like a steady
[04:01:18.660 --> 04:01:20.660]  product so I know that I can go
[04:01:20.660 --> 04:01:22.660]  into the grow room I can go into Brandon's
[04:01:22.660 --> 04:01:24.660]  greenhouse
[04:01:24.660 --> 04:01:26.660]  I can smell the plant
[04:01:26.900 --> 04:01:28.900]  I know that he uses living soil
[04:01:28.900 --> 04:01:30.900]  I can chop that put it into a freezer
[04:01:30.900 --> 04:01:32.900]  and I can know without a doubt
[04:01:32.900 --> 04:01:34.900]  what it's going to taste like
[04:01:34.900 --> 04:01:36.900]  in that greenhouse
[04:01:36.900 --> 04:01:38.900]  yeah he's got it right there
[04:01:38.900 --> 04:01:40.900]  so if you smell the flower you can taste it
[04:01:40.900 --> 04:01:42.900]  with
[04:01:42.900 --> 04:01:44.900]  that I guess being said
[04:01:44.900 --> 04:01:46.900]  it's like I prefer to do it that way
[04:01:46.900 --> 04:01:48.900]  because there's more than one way
[04:01:48.900 --> 04:01:50.900]  to do things
[04:01:50.900 --> 04:01:52.900]  about every grower that you talk to
[04:01:52.900 --> 04:01:54.900]  if I went through here and asked you one by one
[04:01:55.140 --> 04:01:57.140]  what's your curing technique
[04:01:57.140 --> 04:01:59.140]  I'm probably going to get about 15 different answers
[04:01:59.140 --> 04:02:01.140]  they're probably going to be pretty close but they're all going to be different
[04:02:01.140 --> 04:02:03.140]  if I ask you
[04:02:03.140 --> 04:02:05.140]  what is your method of
[04:02:05.140 --> 04:02:07.140]  taking this bag and putting it into that freezer
[04:02:07.140 --> 04:02:09.140]  it's probably going to be pretty close
[04:02:09.140 --> 04:02:11.140]  you know and so at that point
[04:02:11.140 --> 04:02:13.140]  I'm not saying that cured
[04:02:13.140 --> 04:02:15.140]  resin is anything less
[04:02:15.140 --> 04:02:17.140]  but what I'm saying is
[04:02:17.140 --> 04:02:19.140]  with fresh frozen it's just
[04:02:19.140 --> 04:02:21.140]  true to the plant
[04:02:21.140 --> 04:02:23.140]  you can take that plant
[04:02:23.380 --> 04:02:25.380]  and chop it and in the next 10 days
[04:02:25.380 --> 04:02:27.380]  you can ruin it
[04:02:27.380 --> 04:02:29.380]  if you don't have the right environment to dry
[04:02:29.380 --> 04:02:31.380]  and cure in you can have some great stuff
[04:02:31.380 --> 04:02:33.380]  and it's going to be trash in 7 days
[04:02:33.380 --> 04:02:35.380]  you're going to have a jar that smells like hay
[04:02:35.380 --> 04:02:37.380]  or cut grass and it's like
[04:02:37.380 --> 04:02:39.380]  it can look great but it's going to taste like cut grass
[04:02:39.380 --> 04:02:41.380]  and it's like I'm not trying to be rude
[04:02:41.380 --> 04:02:43.380]  but that's the way it is
[04:02:43.380 --> 04:02:45.380]  you all have tasted some stuff that looked great
[04:02:45.380 --> 04:02:47.380]  and you tasted it and you were like dang
[04:02:47.380 --> 04:02:49.380]  what happened here
[04:02:49.380 --> 04:02:51.380]  they didn't dry and cure it properly
[04:02:51.620 --> 04:02:53.620]  they did good on the drying
[04:02:53.620 --> 04:02:55.620]  but they dipped it on the drying and curing
[04:02:55.620 --> 04:02:57.620]  I like to take that out
[04:02:57.620 --> 04:02:59.620]  I like to eliminate that barrier
[04:02:59.620 --> 04:03:01.620]  right there and so
[04:03:01.620 --> 04:03:03.620]  there's nothing wrong with
[04:03:03.620 --> 04:03:05.620]  cured resin if you go in
[04:03:05.620 --> 04:03:07.620]  and you say is this fresh frozen or is it cured
[04:03:07.620 --> 04:03:09.620]  if they tell you it's cured
[04:03:09.620 --> 04:03:11.620]  don't shake a stick at it
[04:03:11.620 --> 04:03:13.620]  don't like be mad at it
[04:03:13.620 --> 04:03:15.620]  cure it out, smell it
[04:03:15.620 --> 04:03:17.620]  if the price point is right then try it out
[04:03:17.620 --> 04:03:19.620]  if you can afford it
[04:03:19.860 --> 04:03:21.860]  there's nothing wrong with it
[04:03:21.860 --> 04:03:23.860]  I've had great cured resin
[04:03:23.860 --> 04:03:25.860]  I've had cured resin that was better than fresh frozen
[04:03:25.860 --> 04:03:27.860]  I've had a lot of fresh frozen
[04:03:27.860 --> 04:03:29.860]  that's better than the cured
[04:03:29.860 --> 04:03:31.860]  just because it's like fresh frozen
[04:03:31.860 --> 04:03:33.860]  I can chop it and then if it's in the freezer
[04:03:33.860 --> 04:03:35.860]  I mean you can't really tell the difference
[04:03:35.860 --> 04:03:37.860]  in something that's been frozen for a week
[04:03:37.860 --> 04:03:39.860]  and something that's been frozen for a month
[04:03:39.860 --> 04:03:41.860]  you can't tell the difference
[04:03:41.860 --> 04:03:43.860]  I've washed a lot of stuff
[04:03:43.860 --> 04:03:45.860]  that's been frozen those different amounts of time
[04:03:45.860 --> 04:03:47.860]  you can really
[04:03:48.100 --> 04:03:50.100]  really tell something that's been cured
[04:03:50.100 --> 04:03:52.100]  for a week from something that's been cured
[04:03:52.100 --> 04:03:54.100]  for two months
[04:03:54.100 --> 04:03:56.100]  if you're not like
[04:03:56.100 --> 04:03:58.100]  packing those notes in nitrogen the whole time
[04:03:58.100 --> 04:04:00.100]  they're probably not going to taste that good
[04:04:00.100 --> 04:04:02.100]  it's two months, three months old wheat
[04:04:02.100 --> 04:04:04.100]  you know and so
[04:04:04.100 --> 04:04:06.100]  that just goes back to
[04:04:06.100 --> 04:04:08.100]  these are tips sort of like
[04:04:08.100 --> 04:04:10.100]  questions that you can ask
[04:04:10.100 --> 04:04:12.100]  and sort of like the age
[04:04:12.100 --> 04:04:14.100]  of the material that made this ash
[04:04:14.100 --> 04:04:16.100]  what that might mean without you tasting it
[04:04:16.340 --> 04:04:18.340]  you can ask a question
[04:04:18.340 --> 04:04:20.340]  get the answer and sort of know what that might be
[04:04:22.340 --> 04:04:24.340]  and as you're getting closer to
[04:04:24.340 --> 04:04:26.340]  32 degrees
[04:04:26.340 --> 04:04:28.340]  what is like the threshold
[04:04:28.340 --> 04:04:30.340]  that the lowest
[04:04:30.340 --> 04:04:32.340]  is there
[04:04:32.340 --> 04:04:34.340]  too cold is the question
[04:04:34.340 --> 04:04:36.340]  I don't necessarily
[04:04:36.340 --> 04:04:38.340]  think that it can be like
[04:04:38.340 --> 04:04:40.340]  too cold maybe if you got it like
[04:04:40.340 --> 04:04:42.340]  really really cold whenever you're like
[04:04:42.340 --> 04:04:44.340]  pulling your bag out of the water
[04:04:44.580 --> 04:04:46.580]  if you're getting like
[04:04:46.580 --> 04:04:48.580]  ice crystals or something
[04:04:48.580 --> 04:04:50.580]  building up on that
[04:04:50.580 --> 04:04:52.580]  you would have to be
[04:04:52.580 --> 04:04:54.580]  really really cold
[04:04:54.580 --> 04:04:56.580]  maybe if you're walking or working
[04:04:56.580 --> 04:04:58.580]  in like an industrial freezer
[04:04:58.580 --> 04:05:00.580]  you know
[04:05:00.580 --> 04:05:02.580]  I wouldn't in 34
[04:05:02.580 --> 04:05:04.580]  good, good
[04:05:04.580 --> 04:05:06.580]  I wouldn't go much lower
[04:05:06.580 --> 04:05:08.580]  are there any questions
[04:05:08.580 --> 04:05:10.580]  right now that you guys might have
[04:05:10.820 --> 04:05:16.200]  hi
[04:05:16.200 --> 04:05:18.200]  from Sepulveda
[04:05:18.200 --> 04:05:20.200]  we have one or maybe two
[04:05:20.200 --> 04:05:22.200]  online already as well
[04:05:22.200 --> 04:05:24.200]  so you were talking about
[04:05:24.200 --> 04:05:26.200]  most of you guys
[04:05:26.200 --> 04:05:28.200]  have spoken about chlorophyll
[04:05:28.200 --> 04:05:30.200]  and
[04:05:30.200 --> 04:05:32.200]  you know conditions aren't always perfect
[04:05:32.200 --> 04:05:34.200]  like you said I mean I've watched in
[04:05:34.200 --> 04:05:36.200]  you know my buddy's
[04:05:36.200 --> 04:05:38.200]  kitchen like 65 degrees
[04:05:38.200 --> 04:05:40.200]  right
[04:05:40.200 --> 04:05:42.200]  so how do you prevent
[04:05:42.440 --> 04:05:44.440]  chlorophyll from leaching
[04:05:44.440 --> 04:05:46.440]  into the water regardless of the
[04:05:46.440 --> 04:05:48.440]  interior of the fresh frozen or
[04:05:48.440 --> 04:05:50.440]  dry it doesn't matter
[04:05:50.440 --> 04:05:52.440]  again you're working for jobs
[04:05:52.440 --> 04:05:54.440]  so how do you prevent that chlorophyll or reduce the amount
[04:05:54.440 --> 04:05:56.440]  of chlorophyll that's going into your liquid
[04:05:56.440 --> 04:05:58.440]  or get that out of the hatch at the end
[04:05:58.440 --> 04:06:00.440]  like what are some remediation methods
[04:06:00.440 --> 04:06:02.440]  that you've found
[04:06:02.440 --> 04:06:04.440]  for that
[04:06:04.440 --> 04:06:06.440]  um
[04:06:06.440 --> 04:06:08.440]  so I guess you
[04:06:08.440 --> 04:06:10.440]  would want to
[04:06:10.680 --> 04:06:12.680]  there's little tricks that you can do
[04:06:12.680 --> 04:06:14.680]  if you're in a really hot room like that
[04:06:14.680 --> 04:06:16.680]  so as you
[04:06:16.680 --> 04:06:18.680]  you want it to get cold
[04:06:18.680 --> 04:06:20.680]  get it cold as quickly as possible
[04:06:20.680 --> 04:06:22.680]  if it's cured
[04:06:22.680 --> 04:06:24.680]  material the warmer it is
[04:06:24.680 --> 04:06:26.680]  sort of like you're going to want to
[04:06:26.680 --> 04:06:28.680]  put that cured material in there
[04:06:28.680 --> 04:06:30.680]  you want it to properly hydrate
[04:06:30.680 --> 04:06:32.680]  before you start going at it
[04:06:32.680 --> 04:06:34.680]  or it's just going to break apart like a paper shutter
[04:06:34.680 --> 04:06:36.680]  so you might want to put it in there
[04:06:36.680 --> 04:06:38.680]  maybe instead of 15 minutes wait
[04:06:38.920 --> 04:06:40.920]  a full 25 minutes for it to really hydrate up
[04:06:40.920 --> 04:06:42.920]  depending on the
[04:06:42.920 --> 04:06:44.920]  humidity of the
[04:06:44.920 --> 04:06:46.920]  flowers or the humidity
[04:06:46.920 --> 04:06:48.920]  whenever you put it in there
[04:06:48.920 --> 04:06:50.920]  once you get it in there and you give it a good soak time
[04:06:50.920 --> 04:06:52.920]  then you can
[04:06:52.920 --> 04:06:54.920]  whenever you're sieving the
[04:06:54.920 --> 04:06:56.920]  hash a lot of people
[04:06:56.920 --> 04:06:58.920]  I see online will
[04:06:58.920 --> 04:07:00.920]  take it and basically
[04:07:00.920 --> 04:07:02.920]  they'll do like this thing where they like
[04:07:02.920 --> 04:07:04.920]  bounce the hash like on
[04:07:04.920 --> 04:07:06.920]  the screen and like wash it back and forth
[04:07:07.160 --> 04:07:09.160]  and they get it to where the hash is like flat
[04:07:09.160 --> 04:07:11.160]  on the screen
[04:07:11.160 --> 04:07:13.160]  yeah they'll shake it and just shake it
[04:07:13.160 --> 04:07:15.160]  and shake it to try to get all that water
[04:07:15.160 --> 04:07:17.160]  out of there because they think about that's what I'm
[04:07:17.160 --> 04:07:19.160]  doing now to dry the hash
[04:07:19.160 --> 04:07:21.160]  it's like
[04:07:21.160 --> 04:07:23.160]  if you're air drying
[04:07:23.160 --> 04:07:25.160]  then yeah shake it give it a little
[04:07:25.160 --> 04:07:27.160]  press with a paper towel from the bottom side
[04:07:27.160 --> 04:07:29.160]  if you're freeze drying it you want
[04:07:29.160 --> 04:07:31.160]  it basically to be more water
[04:07:31.160 --> 04:07:33.160]  than hash because you got to think about
[04:07:33.160 --> 04:07:35.160]  drying out like
[04:07:35.400 --> 04:07:37.400]  say a sponge opposed to a rock
[04:07:37.400 --> 04:07:39.400]  or a piece of clay
[04:07:39.400 --> 04:07:41.400]  the more the
[04:07:41.400 --> 04:07:43.400]  drier the hash is
[04:07:43.400 --> 04:07:45.400]  whenever you take it out of that bag
[04:07:45.400 --> 04:07:47.400]  the harder it is for that freeze dryer to pull
[04:07:47.400 --> 04:07:49.400]  the humidity from the inside of that
[04:07:49.400 --> 04:07:51.400]  if it's a slurry
[04:07:51.400 --> 04:07:53.400]  in there the water just runs out
[04:07:53.400 --> 04:07:55.400]  ok so
[04:07:55.400 --> 04:07:57.400]  instead of pulling it
[04:07:57.400 --> 04:07:59.400]  out and really giving it a shake like that
[04:07:59.400 --> 04:08:01.400]  leave everything down in your ice water
[04:08:01.400 --> 04:08:03.400]  in the bucket that you're gonna
[04:08:03.640 --> 04:08:05.640]  you're gonna mix over here
[04:08:05.640 --> 04:08:07.640]  you're gonna pour that through your screens
[04:08:07.640 --> 04:08:09.640]  or maybe you're mixing on top of your screens
[04:08:09.640 --> 04:08:11.640]  put
[04:08:11.640 --> 04:08:13.640]  ice underneath that so whenever
[04:08:13.640 --> 04:08:15.640]  you pour it and it goes through
[04:08:15.640 --> 04:08:17.640]  your bags it doesn't hit like a
[04:08:17.640 --> 04:08:19.640]  hot trash can on it
[04:08:19.640 --> 04:08:21.640]  it's gonna go into ice water
[04:08:21.640 --> 04:08:23.640]  it's gonna be through the bag but the water that it
[04:08:23.640 --> 04:08:25.640]  sets in is gonna be cold so it's gonna keep it
[04:08:25.640 --> 04:08:27.640]  cold you want to keep it frozen
[04:08:27.640 --> 04:08:29.640]  so instead of using your room you're gonna use
[04:08:29.640 --> 04:08:31.640]  a lot of ice and you're gonna
[04:08:31.880 --> 04:08:33.880]  create a ton of waste water
[04:08:33.880 --> 04:08:35.880]  it's gonna be this
[04:08:35.880 --> 04:08:37.880]  putting in ice taking out water
[04:08:37.880 --> 04:08:39.880]  sort of like dance that you're gonna be doing
[04:08:39.880 --> 04:08:41.880]  at that point so
[04:08:41.880 --> 04:08:43.880]  as you sit it
[04:08:43.880 --> 04:08:45.880]  your sprayer you can take
[04:08:45.880 --> 04:08:47.880]  a
[04:08:47.880 --> 04:08:49.880]  weed sprayer but basically a weed sprayer
[04:08:49.880 --> 04:08:51.880]  you know like your nozzle
[04:08:51.880 --> 04:08:53.880]  and put ice in there
[04:08:53.880 --> 04:08:55.880]  so you're spraying ice water
[04:08:55.880 --> 04:08:57.880]  instead of room temperature water on that
[04:08:57.880 --> 04:08:59.880]  take that and get it
[04:09:00.120 --> 04:09:02.120]  into a regular freezer
[04:09:02.120 --> 04:09:04.120]  as quickly as possible so keep
[04:09:04.120 --> 04:09:06.120]  your tray like a metal tray
[04:09:06.120 --> 04:09:08.120]  in the freezer so you can
[04:09:08.120 --> 04:09:10.120]  take it out put the hash on there
[04:09:10.120 --> 04:09:12.120]  and at least have something cold to set on it
[04:09:12.120 --> 04:09:14.120]  and it starts chilling it if you're gonna be in a warm room
[04:09:16.120 --> 04:09:18.120]  it sounds a lot like
[04:09:18.120 --> 04:09:20.120]  cold to use this way
[04:09:20.120 --> 04:09:22.120]  having a yeah I mean you'll spend
[04:09:22.120 --> 04:09:24.120]  a fraction on the ice you'll use a lot less
[04:09:24.120 --> 04:09:26.120]  ice you'll create a lot less waste
[04:09:26.120 --> 04:09:28.120]  at that point
[04:09:28.360 --> 04:09:30.360]  of moving that amount of water in this room
[04:09:32.360 --> 04:09:34.360]  there's a question from the audience
[04:09:34.360 --> 04:09:36.360]  online audience
[04:09:36.360 --> 04:09:38.360]  when it comes to your health
[04:09:38.360 --> 04:09:40.360]  risk and getting involved with turps
[04:09:40.360 --> 04:09:42.360]  what is your opinion on that
[04:09:44.360 --> 04:09:46.360]  my opinion I guess wouldn't be
[04:09:46.360 --> 04:09:48.360]  worth much because I'm not
[04:09:48.360 --> 04:09:50.360]  I haven't done like
[04:09:50.360 --> 04:09:52.360]  a ton of like research on that
[04:09:52.360 --> 04:09:54.360]  I mean in 2013
[04:09:54.360 --> 04:09:56.360]  whenever Blue River started putting
[04:09:56.600 --> 04:09:58.600]  off their turps and people were taking
[04:09:58.600 --> 04:10:00.600]  you know chunks of shatter
[04:10:00.600 --> 04:10:02.600]  and dipping it in pure turps
[04:10:02.600 --> 04:10:04.600]  you know and dabbing it my throat would hurt
[04:10:04.600 --> 04:10:06.600]  for two weeks I was like you're not even
[04:10:06.600 --> 04:10:08.600]  convincing me this is a good thing we should do
[04:10:08.600 --> 04:10:10.600]  you know and like until
[04:10:12.600 --> 04:10:14.600]  I don't know seven years ago there weren't
[04:10:14.600 --> 04:10:16.600]  terpene you weren't ingesting
[04:10:16.600 --> 04:10:18.600]  terpenes over five
[04:10:18.600 --> 04:10:20.600]  to seven percent really
[04:10:20.600 --> 04:10:22.600]  there just like wasn't that high
[04:10:22.600 --> 04:10:24.600]  of like terpenes in a lot of things so
[04:10:24.840 --> 04:10:26.840]  I think that it's kind of like
[04:10:26.840 --> 04:10:28.840]  how bad is vaping tobacco
[04:10:28.840 --> 04:10:30.840]  we just don't really know
[04:10:30.840 --> 04:10:32.840]  we haven't had the time
[04:10:32.840 --> 04:10:34.840]  and the exposure to it to really know
[04:10:34.840 --> 04:10:36.840]  so I don't really necessarily
[04:10:36.840 --> 04:10:38.840]  want to spread
[04:10:38.840 --> 04:10:40.840]  misinformation on
[04:10:40.840 --> 04:10:42.840]  what I think about dabbing
[04:10:42.840 --> 04:10:44.840]  like volatile
[04:10:44.840 --> 04:10:46.840]  terpenes but I think if you
[04:10:46.840 --> 04:10:48.840]  moderation is key
[04:10:48.840 --> 04:10:50.840]  maybe not dab
[04:10:50.840 --> 04:10:52.840]  100% pure terpene is key but other
[04:10:53.080 --> 04:10:55.080]  than that 20%
[04:10:55.080 --> 04:10:57.080]  15% something like that I don't know if your
[04:10:57.080 --> 04:10:59.080]  throat hurts don't dab if you want to
[04:11:01.080 --> 04:11:03.080]  drink some water
[04:11:03.080 --> 04:11:05.080]  deep breaths
[04:11:05.080 --> 04:11:07.080]  alright and then
[04:11:07.080 --> 04:11:09.080]  Magnus Sainz would like to know
[04:11:09.080 --> 04:11:11.080]  basically if you can go deeper into
[04:11:11.080 --> 04:11:13.080]  the electric static tech
[04:11:13.080 --> 04:11:15.080]  as well as the fresh frozen dry
[04:11:15.080 --> 04:11:18.680]  sys
[04:11:18.680 --> 04:11:20.680]  so
[04:11:20.680 --> 04:11:22.680]  like I said
[04:11:22.920 --> 04:11:24.920]  8420k on YouTube
[04:11:24.920 --> 04:11:26.920]  bubbleman, john burfello those are the dudes
[04:11:26.920 --> 04:11:28.920]  you need to like
[04:11:28.920 --> 04:11:30.920]  there are hours
[04:11:30.920 --> 04:11:32.920]  and hours of people that have
[04:11:32.920 --> 04:11:34.920]  done it that can show you
[04:11:34.920 --> 04:11:36.920]  how to do it
[04:11:36.920 --> 04:11:38.920]  a lot better than I can right now
[04:11:38.920 --> 04:11:40.920]  I haven't done
[04:11:40.920 --> 04:11:42.920]  like a ton of it
[04:11:42.920 --> 04:11:44.920]  because I feel like you have to
[04:11:44.920 --> 04:11:46.920]  I haven't necessarily had
[04:11:46.920 --> 04:11:48.920]  access to the right material to do it
[04:11:48.920 --> 04:11:50.920]  if you're a gardener
[04:11:51.160 --> 04:11:53.160]  and you have a ton of lowers that are dry
[04:11:55.160 --> 04:11:57.160]  then by all means do it
[04:11:57.160 --> 04:11:59.160]  for me it's not really worth it
[04:11:59.160 --> 04:12:01.160]  because you have to take so much material
[04:12:01.160 --> 04:12:03.160]  do a lot a lot a lot of work
[04:12:03.160 --> 04:12:05.160]  maybe a little bit of material
[04:12:05.160 --> 04:12:07.160]  and then take that
[04:12:07.160 --> 04:12:09.160]  and refine that down
[04:12:09.160 --> 04:12:11.160]  you're talking 2-3% of
[04:12:11.160 --> 04:12:13.160]  5% of the weight
[04:12:13.160 --> 04:12:15.160]  that you're extracting
[04:12:15.160 --> 04:12:17.160]  so basically what it is
[04:12:17.160 --> 04:12:19.160]  is you're using
[04:12:19.400 --> 04:12:21.400]  the static
[04:12:21.400 --> 04:12:23.400]  that is the trichome
[04:12:23.400 --> 04:12:25.400]  the
[04:12:25.400 --> 04:12:27.400]  full metal trichome head
[04:12:27.400 --> 04:12:29.400]  that is still intact
[04:12:29.400 --> 04:12:31.400]  that doesn't have any holes in it
[04:12:31.400 --> 04:12:33.400]  has a positive
[04:12:33.400 --> 04:12:35.400]  charge
[04:12:35.400 --> 04:12:37.400]  you can use like a paint roller
[04:12:37.400 --> 04:12:39.400]  you can use like a cassette cd case
[04:12:39.400 --> 04:12:41.400]  you can use like a
[04:12:41.400 --> 04:12:43.400]  regular cd case
[04:12:43.400 --> 04:12:45.400]  there's a few things that you can use
[04:12:45.400 --> 04:12:47.400]  you wrap some parchment paper
[04:12:47.640 --> 04:12:49.640]  around that, that gets a negative charge on it
[04:12:49.640 --> 04:12:51.640]  and you sort of
[04:12:51.640 --> 04:12:53.640]  push the hash across your triceps
[04:12:53.640 --> 04:12:55.640]  and the heads
[04:12:55.640 --> 04:12:57.640]  will
[04:12:57.640 --> 04:12:59.640]  only the ones that are positively charged
[04:12:59.640 --> 04:13:01.640]  I think it could be negative
[04:13:01.640 --> 04:13:03.640]  I don't really know
[04:13:03.640 --> 04:13:05.640]  it's just like a magnet
[04:13:05.640 --> 04:13:07.640]  they basically stick on to the paint roller
[04:13:07.640 --> 04:13:09.640]  you take it over here and knock them off
[04:13:09.640 --> 04:13:11.640]  it's just a way
[04:13:11.640 --> 04:13:13.640]  I don't really know
[04:13:13.640 --> 04:13:15.640]  necessarily why people are doing
[04:13:15.880 --> 04:13:17.880]  it's kind of like a way to clean your
[04:13:17.880 --> 04:13:19.880]  keef at home I feel like would be
[04:13:19.880 --> 04:13:21.880]  the application to it
[04:13:21.880 --> 04:13:23.880]  I don't know if it necessarily has a commercial
[04:13:23.880 --> 04:13:25.880]  application because at that point
[04:13:25.880 --> 04:13:27.880]  it's like just do dry sift
[04:13:27.880 --> 04:13:29.880]  and I guess
[04:13:29.880 --> 04:13:31.880]  maybe they are and that's how they're cleaning
[04:13:31.880 --> 04:13:33.880]  their dry sift
[04:13:35.880 --> 04:13:37.880]  because the heads aren't
[04:13:37.880 --> 04:13:39.880]  the heads are maybe like
[04:13:39.880 --> 04:13:41.880]  85 microns on that particular
[04:13:41.880 --> 04:13:43.880]  strain but
[04:13:44.120 --> 04:13:46.120]  they're caught on the 74 micron
[04:13:46.120 --> 04:13:48.120]  screen so maybe the
[04:13:48.120 --> 04:13:50.120]  75 micron heads on the
[04:13:50.120 --> 04:13:52.120]  74 screens aren't
[04:13:52.120 --> 04:13:54.120]  full metal and so
[04:13:54.120 --> 04:13:56.120]  they're using that static tech
[04:13:56.120 --> 04:13:58.120]  to further refine the
[04:13:58.120 --> 04:14:00.120]  gap of their
[04:14:00.120 --> 04:14:02.120]  triceps back
[04:14:02.120 --> 04:14:04.120]  and then you ask about dry
[04:14:04.120 --> 04:14:06.120]  fresh frozen dry sift
[04:14:06.120 --> 04:14:08.120]  that I've never
[04:14:08.120 --> 04:14:10.120]  done, I would like to
[04:14:10.120 --> 04:14:12.120]  that is whenever you're talking
[04:14:12.360 --> 04:14:14.360]  about getting really really cold
[04:14:14.360 --> 04:14:16.360]  I want to have a room that's
[04:14:16.360 --> 04:14:18.360]  15 degrees it's basically like a
[04:14:18.360 --> 04:14:20.360]  freezer because you need a lot of room
[04:14:20.360 --> 04:14:22.360]  you need a lot of space and it needs to be
[04:14:22.360 --> 04:14:24.360]  really really cold
[04:14:24.360 --> 04:14:26.360]  you basically need to have your own
[04:14:26.360 --> 04:14:28.360]  garden too because you basically need to harvest
[04:14:28.360 --> 04:14:30.360]  it and be able to
[04:14:30.360 --> 04:14:32.360]  watch it, watch it, watch it
[04:14:32.360 --> 04:14:34.360]  okay it's ready to go right now
[04:14:34.360 --> 04:14:36.360]  because you have to catch it up in perfect time
[04:14:38.360 --> 04:14:40.360]  any other questions?
[04:14:43.690 --> 04:14:45.690]  not yet
[04:14:45.690 --> 04:14:47.690]  alright I'll wait
[04:14:47.690 --> 04:14:49.690]  I'm just kidding
[04:14:49.690 --> 04:14:51.690]  I appreciate you guys
[04:14:51.690 --> 04:14:53.690]  again coming out and
[04:14:53.690 --> 04:14:55.690]  taking your time to like
[04:14:55.690 --> 04:14:57.690]  genuinely be curious
[04:14:57.690 --> 04:14:59.690]  about the product
[04:14:59.690 --> 04:15:01.690]  I like selling
[04:15:01.690 --> 04:15:03.690]  medical products as opposed to
[04:15:03.690 --> 04:15:05.690]  recreational products because
[04:15:05.690 --> 04:15:07.690]  if you want to use my medical products
[04:15:07.690 --> 04:15:09.690]  for recreation you might not need to do it but
[04:15:09.690 --> 04:15:11.690]  people coming
[04:15:11.930 --> 04:15:13.930]  here and having a genuine curiosity
[04:15:13.930 --> 04:15:15.930]  and really caring
[04:15:15.930 --> 04:15:17.930]  what does this do
[04:15:17.930 --> 04:15:19.930]  it makes the
[04:15:19.930 --> 04:15:21.930]  hard work of making the ash
[04:15:21.930 --> 04:15:23.930]  growing the weed, packaging it
[04:15:23.930 --> 04:15:25.930]  and selling it, it makes all of that worth
[04:15:25.930 --> 04:15:27.930]  it for somebody to be like this is
[04:15:27.930 --> 04:15:29.930]  healthy in some way
[04:15:29.930 --> 04:15:31.930]  as opposed to yeah I like it
[04:15:31.930 --> 04:15:33.930]  it's fire
[04:15:35.930 --> 04:15:37.930]  yeah I appreciate it
[04:15:37.930 --> 04:15:39.930]  applause
[04:15:40.170 --> 04:15:42.170]  you got another one
[04:15:42.170 --> 04:15:44.170]  I was cheering on for that
[04:15:46.170 --> 04:15:48.170]  can you talk about like difficulties
[04:15:48.170 --> 04:15:50.170]  in affecting your price point
[04:15:50.170 --> 04:15:52.170]  in a retail space
[04:15:52.170 --> 04:15:54.170]  as time goes on
[04:15:58.170 --> 04:16:00.170]  yeah right
[04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:02.170]  well
[04:16:02.170 --> 04:16:04.170]  something
[04:16:04.170 --> 04:16:06.170]  that I've been talking about lately with
[04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:08.170]  like a few people
[04:16:10.170 --> 04:16:12.170]  it's sort of like I've noticed
[04:16:12.170 --> 04:16:14.170]  I've been in the industry for about 10 years now
[04:16:14.170 --> 04:16:16.170]  and it's interesting
[04:16:16.170 --> 04:16:18.170]  because the cannabis
[04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:20.170]  industry is kind of like unlike
[04:16:20.170 --> 04:16:22.170]  any other industry that I've ever really
[04:16:22.170 --> 04:16:24.170]  looked at because
[04:16:24.170 --> 04:16:26.170]  it's like you know
[04:16:28.170 --> 04:16:30.170]  a Honda Civic
[04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:32.170]  isn't cheaper
[04:16:32.170 --> 04:16:34.170]  now because they've been making
[04:16:34.170 --> 04:16:36.170]  Honda Civics for
[04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:38.170]  40 years
[04:16:38.410 --> 04:16:40.410]  milk isn't cheaper than it was
[04:16:40.410 --> 04:16:42.410]  10 years ago
[04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:44.410]  Brandon's inputs for his
[04:16:44.410 --> 04:16:46.410]  soil aren't cheaper than they were
[04:16:46.410 --> 04:16:48.410]  10 years ago
[04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:50.410]  nothing in life is
[04:16:50.410 --> 04:16:52.410]  cheaper than it was 10 years ago
[04:16:52.410 --> 04:16:54.410]  but the way the cannabis industry is
[04:16:54.410 --> 04:16:56.410]  a lot of people look at it and they go man
[04:16:56.410 --> 04:16:58.410]  the medical industry has been in Oklahoma
[04:16:58.410 --> 04:17:00.410]  now since 2018 we've got to get these
[04:17:00.410 --> 04:17:02.410]  prices down
[04:17:02.410 --> 04:17:04.410]  they were $70 a gram
[04:17:04.410 --> 04:17:06.410]  when we started
[04:17:06.650 --> 04:17:08.650]  30 years into it we've got to get them down
[04:17:08.650 --> 04:17:10.650]  it should be $40 a gram
[04:17:10.650 --> 04:17:12.650]  and it's like
[04:17:12.650 --> 04:17:14.650]  one
[04:17:14.650 --> 04:17:16.650]  the product that I make is sort of like
[04:17:16.650 --> 04:17:18.650]  the more expensive products
[04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:20.650]  that you can buy at a cheaper expense
[04:17:20.650 --> 04:17:22.650]  I hate that
[04:17:22.650 --> 04:17:24.650]  I hate that it has to be like that
[04:17:24.650 --> 04:17:26.650]  I wish it was the cheapest one
[04:17:26.650 --> 04:17:28.650]  so everybody in this room had like a hundred migraines
[04:17:28.650 --> 04:17:30.650]  at their house
[04:17:30.650 --> 04:17:32.650]  and I understand that's sort of like unrealistic
[04:17:32.650 --> 04:17:34.650]  for a bunch of black people
[04:17:34.890 --> 04:17:36.890]  that's true
[04:17:36.890 --> 04:17:38.890]  but I wish
[04:17:38.890 --> 04:17:40.890]  I just wish that it was like
[04:17:40.890 --> 04:17:42.890]  they didn't have to sell
[04:17:42.890 --> 04:17:44.890]  for a lesser product to be able to
[04:17:44.890 --> 04:17:46.890]  afford to ingest
[04:17:46.890 --> 04:17:48.890]  the amount that they ingest
[04:17:48.890 --> 04:17:50.890]  I can't necessarily
[04:17:50.890 --> 04:17:52.890]  take a 30 day
[04:17:52.890 --> 04:17:54.890]  tolerance break
[04:17:54.890 --> 04:17:56.890]  every other month to let my tolerance
[04:17:56.890 --> 04:17:58.890]  go down because I wouldn't be able to get going
[04:17:58.890 --> 04:18:00.890]  I smoke a gram
[04:18:00.890 --> 04:18:02.890]  a hash before most people are awake
[04:18:03.130 --> 04:18:05.130]  just to get up and going
[04:18:05.130 --> 04:18:07.130]  because of where my stomach is
[04:18:07.130 --> 04:18:09.130]  so I don't have the ability
[04:18:09.130 --> 04:18:11.130]  to take a 30 day tolerance break
[04:18:11.130 --> 04:18:13.130]  and not smoke as much as I do
[04:18:13.130 --> 04:18:15.130]  so I am where I am
[04:18:15.130 --> 04:18:17.130]  today because of that
[04:18:17.130 --> 04:18:19.130]  I started like oh wow
[04:18:19.130 --> 04:18:21.130]  I can't afford
[04:18:21.130 --> 04:18:23.130]  my medicine anymore like what do I do
[04:18:23.130 --> 04:18:25.130]  I met somebody that let me work
[04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:27.130]  for him and he would give me a little bit
[04:18:27.130 --> 04:18:29.130]  of material that I could watch and I could have
[04:18:29.130 --> 04:18:31.130]  an action that was cheaper
[04:18:31.370 --> 04:18:33.370]  for me to get that material
[04:18:33.370 --> 04:18:35.370]  it's unfortunate
[04:18:35.370 --> 04:18:37.370]  that the hash
[04:18:37.370 --> 04:18:39.370]  is one of the most
[04:18:39.370 --> 04:18:41.370]  expensive items in the
[04:18:41.370 --> 04:18:43.370]  store that is being sold
[04:18:45.370 --> 04:18:47.370]  some of the
[04:18:47.370 --> 04:18:49.370]  so one of the things I was going to
[04:18:49.370 --> 04:18:51.370]  talk about is even if it is
[04:18:51.370 --> 04:18:53.370]  a really young market
[04:18:53.370 --> 04:18:55.370]  here in Oklahoma, it's been around since
[04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:57.370]  2018, if you go to the store there is
[04:18:57.370 --> 04:18:59.370]  more hash in Oklahoma
[04:18:59.610 --> 04:19:01.610]  dispensaries than any other state
[04:19:01.610 --> 04:19:03.610]  in the entire nation
[04:19:03.610 --> 04:19:05.610]  you can go to the Cessias in Oakland
[04:19:05.610 --> 04:19:07.610]  California which is like a collection
[04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:09.610]  of all the hash dudes and there's less
[04:19:09.610 --> 04:19:11.610]  jars of hash and they're $95 a gram
[04:19:11.610 --> 04:19:13.610]  in the Bay Area
[04:19:13.610 --> 04:19:15.610]  the reason that is is because
[04:19:15.610 --> 04:19:17.610]  Oklahoma was really fortunate
[04:19:17.610 --> 04:19:19.610]  in the way that they did the laws with the
[04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:21.610]  taxes the way it is
[04:19:21.610 --> 04:19:23.610]  so take Washington for instance
[04:19:23.610 --> 04:19:25.610]  whenever I was there
[04:19:25.610 --> 04:19:27.610]  I had a good friend that
[04:19:27.850 --> 04:19:29.850]  whenever I went to Washington
[04:19:29.850 --> 04:19:31.850]  he went to Colorado
[04:19:31.850 --> 04:19:33.850]  he was working
[04:19:33.850 --> 04:19:35.850]  dispensary there, they were vertically
[04:19:35.850 --> 04:19:37.850]  integrated so they were selling
[04:19:37.850 --> 04:19:39.850]  $120 grams
[04:19:39.850 --> 04:19:41.850]  of
[04:19:41.850 --> 04:19:43.850]  full milk dry sift at the time
[04:19:43.850 --> 04:19:45.850]  so I was just curious
[04:19:45.850 --> 04:19:47.850]  what are you making
[04:19:47.850 --> 04:19:49.850]  per gram?
[04:19:49.850 --> 04:19:51.850]  and they were making between
[04:19:51.850 --> 04:19:53.850]  $85 to $75
[04:19:53.850 --> 04:19:55.850]  for every gram
[04:19:56.090 --> 04:19:58.090]  that they sold at that price point
[04:19:58.090 --> 04:20:00.090]  I was in Washington state
[04:20:00.090 --> 04:20:02.090]  they were able to wash it
[04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:04.090]  press it, sell it, pay the
[04:20:04.090 --> 04:20:06.090]  sales tax on it
[04:20:06.090 --> 04:20:08.090]  and get it to the customer
[04:20:08.090 --> 04:20:10.090]  at that point. Well
[04:20:10.090 --> 04:20:12.090]  if I in Washington state just wanted
[04:20:12.090 --> 04:20:14.090]  to even make their
[04:20:14.090 --> 04:20:16.090]  wholesale which was maybe
[04:20:16.090 --> 04:20:18.090]  say $50, if I wanted
[04:20:18.090 --> 04:20:20.090]  that the consumer would have to pay
[04:20:20.090 --> 04:20:22.090]  $150 for the same gram
[04:20:22.090 --> 04:20:24.090]  of hash because in Washington
[04:20:24.330 --> 04:20:26.330]  the way the taxes are set up they have to mark up
[04:20:26.330 --> 04:20:28.330]  everything three times
[04:20:28.330 --> 04:20:30.330]  so
[04:20:30.330 --> 04:20:32.330]  the way that the taxes are here
[04:20:32.330 --> 04:20:34.330]  you literally can't
[04:20:34.330 --> 04:20:36.330]  if you don't have a flower that dumps
[04:20:36.330 --> 04:20:38.330]  7, 8, 9%
[04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:40.330]  in hash rawson which is maybe
[04:20:40.330 --> 04:20:42.330]  a tenth of a percent of the stuff that you
[04:20:42.330 --> 04:20:44.330]  wash, you can't afford to do it
[04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:46.330]  and so that's why whenever you go to Washington
[04:20:46.330 --> 04:20:48.330]  state, VHO
[04:20:48.330 --> 04:20:50.330]  diamonds, still huge
[04:20:50.330 --> 04:20:52.330]  Oklahoma, nobody brags about
[04:20:52.570 --> 04:20:54.570]  smoking VHO, they do, they buy it
[04:20:54.570 --> 04:20:56.570]  and then they post the one picture of the
[04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:58.570]  hash because it's already
[04:20:58.570 --> 04:21:00.570]  they
[04:21:00.570 --> 04:21:02.570]  like know, they understand
[04:21:02.570 --> 04:21:04.570]  that it's like
[04:21:04.570 --> 04:21:06.570]  it's a superior product
[04:21:06.570 --> 04:21:08.570]  and I'm not trying to talk trash
[04:21:08.570 --> 04:21:10.570]  on anyone and say
[04:21:10.570 --> 04:21:12.570]  it's like
[04:21:12.570 --> 04:21:14.570]  one is like a trash product
[04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:16.570]  no I'm not saying that, I'm just saying it's like
[04:21:16.570 --> 04:21:18.570]  it is like the future
[04:21:18.570 --> 04:21:20.570]  I think it is the future because it is a great
[04:21:20.810 --> 04:21:22.810]  product, hash is basically like the
[04:21:22.810 --> 04:21:24.810]  end of the road, like in my opinion
[04:21:24.810 --> 04:21:26.810]  it started as hash
[04:21:26.810 --> 04:21:28.810]  it went to flower, it went to all these
[04:21:28.810 --> 04:21:30.810]  other bonker things
[04:21:30.810 --> 04:21:32.810]  and then it went back to hash and it's sort of like
[04:21:32.810 --> 04:21:34.810]  the plant knows
[04:21:34.810 --> 04:21:36.810]  like with all the different things
[04:21:36.810 --> 04:21:38.810]  the plant grows
[04:21:38.810 --> 04:21:40.810]  it's like I'm growing and my
[04:21:40.810 --> 04:21:42.810]  one job is to basically
[04:21:42.810 --> 04:21:44.810]  put on resin
[04:21:44.810 --> 04:21:46.810]  get somebody to pollinate me
[04:21:46.810 --> 04:21:48.810]  keep somebody from eating me
[04:21:49.050 --> 04:21:51.050]  and drop seeds on the ground
[04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:53.050]  and I mean that resin, that's what you want
[04:21:55.050 --> 04:21:57.050]  grow in living soil
[04:21:57.050 --> 04:21:59.050]  get that resin
[04:21:59.050 --> 04:22:01.050]  get the resin into the jar nicely
[04:22:01.050 --> 04:22:03.050]  and I believe that's
[04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:05.050]  the best product
[04:22:05.050 --> 04:22:07.050]  that you can smoke
[04:22:07.050 --> 04:22:09.050]  did I answer that
[04:22:09.050 --> 04:22:11.050]  or did I, why I'm like
[04:22:11.050 --> 04:22:13.050]  you forgot the question I was so long
[04:22:13.050 --> 04:22:15.050]  no, well I'm reading a lot
[04:22:15.050 --> 04:22:17.050]  of stuff
[04:22:17.290 --> 04:22:19.290]  so I asked the audience
[04:22:19.290 --> 04:22:21.290]  but it sounded like it was pretty well done
[04:22:21.290 --> 04:22:23.290]  did I answer your question
[04:22:23.290 --> 04:22:25.290]  ok, yeah
[04:22:25.290 --> 04:22:27.290]  oh so one thing is
[04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:29.290]  another thing is he asked what sort of
[04:22:29.290 --> 04:22:31.290]  affects that, so one of the things is
[04:22:31.290 --> 04:22:33.290]  right now they made it
[04:22:33.290 --> 04:22:35.290]  whenever metric comes into play
[04:22:35.290 --> 04:22:37.290]  here
[04:22:37.290 --> 04:22:39.290]  you have to test every
[04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:41.290]  10 pounds of legion garden
[04:22:41.290 --> 04:22:43.290]  whether that's cured or dry
[04:22:43.290 --> 04:22:45.290]  so a cured pound
[04:22:45.530 --> 04:22:47.530]  is 80% water
[04:22:47.530 --> 04:22:49.530]  so having to do that
[04:22:49.530 --> 04:22:51.530]  testing fresh roses is 5 times
[04:22:51.530 --> 04:22:53.530]  as expensive as it is
[04:22:53.530 --> 04:22:55.530]  to test a cured material
[04:22:55.530 --> 04:22:57.530]  so you're either going to start seeing a lot more
[04:22:57.530 --> 04:22:59.530]  cured hash or you're going to
[04:22:59.530 --> 04:23:01.530]  see hashes closer to 100 gram
[04:23:01.530 --> 04:23:03.530]  because I'm opening
[04:23:03.530 --> 04:23:05.530]  up a 40 light indoor right now
[04:23:05.530 --> 04:23:07.530]  if I did
[04:23:07.530 --> 04:23:09.530]  2 pounds of
[04:23:09.530 --> 04:23:11.530]  trimmable plant fur
[04:23:11.530 --> 04:23:13.530]  light
[04:23:13.770 --> 04:23:15.770]  I'm saying that's roughly going to be
[04:23:15.770 --> 04:23:17.770]  10 pounds of fresh frozen
[04:23:17.770 --> 04:23:19.770]  so I'm looking at somewhere around
[04:23:19.770 --> 04:23:21.770]  400 pounds of test of fresh frozen
[04:23:21.770 --> 04:23:23.770]  and I have to test every
[04:23:23.770 --> 04:23:25.770]  10 pounds of that, so that's 40
[04:23:25.770 --> 04:23:27.770]  tests that cost 300 bucks
[04:23:27.770 --> 04:23:29.770]  so I have to chop my harvest
[04:23:29.770 --> 04:23:31.770]  of 12 grain in the hole
[04:23:31.770 --> 04:23:33.770]  and hope that they watch a higher
[04:23:33.770 --> 04:23:35.770]  yield that I can
[04:23:35.770 --> 04:23:37.770]  sell that hash
[04:23:37.770 --> 04:23:39.770]  and make any money at all
[04:23:39.770 --> 04:23:41.770]  by gardening 12 grain in the hole
[04:23:42.010 --> 04:23:44.010]  and if I don't want to do that
[04:23:44.010 --> 04:23:46.010]  then I basically have to dry cure it
[04:23:46.010 --> 04:23:48.010]  because 300 bucks for 10 pounds of cured material
[04:23:48.010 --> 04:23:50.010]  I'll pay all day
[04:23:50.010 --> 04:23:52.010]  but 10 pounds of fresh frozen
[04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:54.010]  is not that big, it's a small chunk
[04:23:56.010 --> 04:23:58.010]  so watch out for that
[04:23:58.010 --> 04:24:00.010]  if you want to send some emails
[04:24:00.010 --> 04:24:02.010]  to people, I'm sure
[04:24:02.010 --> 04:24:04.010]  Brandon knows
[04:24:04.010 --> 04:24:06.010]  the right people to send the emails
[04:24:06.010 --> 04:24:08.010]  to to tell him that we want that changed
[04:24:14.050 --> 04:24:16.050]  one second Brandon
[04:24:24.010 --> 04:24:26.010]  so I'm not 100%
[04:24:26.010 --> 04:24:28.010]  certain but
[04:24:28.010 --> 04:24:30.010]  I believe what happened was
[04:24:32.010 --> 04:24:34.010]  that court order against Metric
[04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:36.010]  is still standing and then there was
[04:24:36.010 --> 04:24:38.010]  a
[04:24:38.010 --> 04:24:40.010]  emergency signing
[04:24:40.010 --> 04:24:42.010]  that I think the governor put in place
[04:24:42.010 --> 04:24:44.010]  but I don't know if he was
[04:24:44.010 --> 04:24:46.010]  aware that there was already a court order
[04:24:46.250 --> 04:24:48.250]  against that so I think he might have
[04:24:48.250 --> 04:24:50.250]  involved himself inadvertently
[04:24:50.250 --> 04:24:52.250]  in the lawsuit that's pending
[04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:54.250]  against Metric so
[04:24:54.250 --> 04:24:56.250]  I think right now Metric's on hold
[04:24:56.250 --> 04:24:58.250]  like
[04:24:58.250 --> 04:25:00.250]  I couldn't hear you
[04:25:00.250 --> 04:25:02.250]  I couldn't hear you
[04:25:02.250 --> 04:25:04.250]  that's the last call I heard of
[04:25:04.250 --> 04:25:06.250]  alright
[04:25:06.250 --> 04:25:08.250]  that's true so as of right now Metric
[04:25:08.250 --> 04:25:10.250]  is on hold
[04:25:10.250 --> 04:25:12.250]  until we get the lawsuit settled
[04:25:12.250 --> 04:25:14.250]  however just FYI
[04:25:14.490 --> 04:25:16.490]  I have friends at OMA
[04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:18.490]  that actually needs to work for us
[04:25:18.490 --> 04:25:20.490]  so I made a phone call
[04:25:20.490 --> 04:25:22.490]  I'll just share that with y'all
[04:25:22.490 --> 04:25:24.490]  because this is what we're here to do
[04:25:24.490 --> 04:25:26.490]  share information that's actually important
[04:25:26.490 --> 04:25:28.490]  so this is how the conversation went
[04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:30.490]  I said hey
[04:25:30.490 --> 04:25:32.490]  I have a question
[04:25:32.490 --> 04:25:34.490]  and it's about Metric and he said
[04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:36.490]  Deidre I work for OMA
[04:25:36.490 --> 04:25:38.490]  I can't talk to you about Metric
[04:25:38.490 --> 04:25:40.490]  and I said okay I have a question for you as a friend
[04:25:40.490 --> 04:25:42.490]  and he said
[04:25:42.730 --> 04:25:44.730]  I'm not really sure if I can answer it
[04:25:44.730 --> 04:25:46.730]  and I said well let me just see
[04:25:46.730 --> 04:25:48.730]  let's just see
[04:25:48.730 --> 04:25:50.730]  I said so if you were me
[04:25:50.730 --> 04:25:52.730]  and you were in
[04:25:52.730 --> 04:25:54.730]  my place
[04:25:54.730 --> 04:25:56.730]  would you go ahead and incorporate
[04:25:56.730 --> 04:25:58.730]  Metric
[04:25:58.730 --> 04:26:00.730]  now or would you wait
[04:26:02.730 --> 04:26:04.730]  and he said that's kind of funny
[04:26:04.730 --> 04:26:06.730]  that you ask that he said have you read
[04:26:06.730 --> 04:26:08.730]  the new emergency laws that are
[04:26:08.730 --> 04:26:10.730]  posted on OMMA
[04:26:10.970 --> 04:26:12.970]  as of the 28th and I said yes sir
[04:26:12.970 --> 04:26:14.970]  I did and this is why I'm asking
[04:26:14.970 --> 04:26:16.970]  because I don't understand how you can write
[04:26:16.970 --> 04:26:18.970]  in Metric laws
[04:26:18.970 --> 04:26:20.970]  and rules
[04:26:20.970 --> 04:26:22.970]  and regulations emergency
[04:26:22.970 --> 04:26:24.970]  done today effective now
[04:26:24.970 --> 04:26:26.970]  when we're in a lawsuit
[04:26:26.970 --> 04:26:28.970]  so my question to you again
[04:26:28.970 --> 04:26:30.970]  is as a friend
[04:26:30.970 --> 04:26:32.970]  if you were me would you
[04:26:32.970 --> 04:26:34.970]  go ahead and incorporate Metric
[04:26:34.970 --> 04:26:36.970]  in your dispensary
[04:26:36.970 --> 04:26:38.970]  and he said
[04:26:39.210 --> 04:26:41.210]  Metric will probably
[04:26:41.210 --> 04:26:43.210]  be incorporated
[04:26:43.210 --> 04:26:45.210]  I would not sit on it
[04:26:45.210 --> 04:26:47.210]  now that's an
[04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:49.210]  OMMA representative telling me that
[04:26:49.210 --> 04:26:51.210]  as a friend but
[04:26:53.210 --> 04:26:55.210]  as far as the law goes
[04:26:55.210 --> 04:26:57.210]  there is no way
[04:26:57.210 --> 04:26:59.210]  that any of us in this room is going to know which way
[04:26:59.210 --> 04:27:01.210]  that's going to go
[04:27:01.210 --> 04:27:03.210]  because we all know that there is no
[04:27:03.210 --> 04:27:05.210]  way that you can predict
[04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:07.210]  how anything
[04:27:07.450 --> 04:27:14.630]  will go
[04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:16.630]  100% so Metric
[04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:18.630]  is not legal
[04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:20.630]  and it is not
[04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:22.630]  I'm not doing it
[04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:24.630]  Oklahoma government does a few things
[04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:26.630]  about it
[04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:28.630]  let's go back to the last
[04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:44.590]  I'll be talking in a little bit too but
[04:27:44.590 --> 04:27:46.590]  one of the things
[04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:48.590]  that I've been kind of hit to
[04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:50.590]  now that I'm doing a lot more
[04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:52.590]  consulting work some of these
[04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:54.590]  that I work with
[04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:56.590]  in Hawaii
[04:27:56.590 --> 04:27:58.590]  they have
[04:27:58.830 --> 04:28:00.830]  to
[04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:02.830]  try to fight legislation
[04:28:02.830 --> 04:28:04.830]  and the only way that they are able to do that
[04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:06.830]  is hire a lobby group
[04:28:06.830 --> 04:28:08.830]  and so their investment
[04:28:08.830 --> 04:28:10.830]  into
[04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:12.830]  this group basically was able to
[04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:14.830]  stop what would have essentially
[04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:16.830]  shut down patient based farms
[04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:18.830]  the program that they have
[04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:20.830]  out there
[04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:22.830]  essentially what is
[04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:24.830]  happening is there's probably
[04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:26.830]  groups or
[04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:29.070]  people in the industry
[04:28:29.070 --> 04:28:31.070]  that have lobby
[04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:33.070]  groups that go and pay
[04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:35.070]  to have legislation made up
[04:28:35.070 --> 04:28:37.070]  and to try to
[04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:39.070]  pass them the law
[04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:41.070]  it usually gives a little benefit to them
[04:28:41.070 --> 04:28:43.070]  so collectively as a community
[04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:45.070]  I think what has to happen
[04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:47.070]  is there has to be
[04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:49.070]  a legal
[04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:51.070]  team and a lobby that can go
[04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:53.070]  against unfair
[04:28:53.070 --> 04:28:55.070]  regulations when companies
[04:28:55.310 --> 04:28:57.310]  go and try to pull these types of
[04:28:57.310 --> 04:28:59.310]  schemes if you look at what's
[04:28:59.310 --> 04:29:01.310]  happening in Michigan right now they're trying
[04:29:01.310 --> 04:29:03.310]  to take away the caregiver program
[04:29:03.310 --> 04:29:05.310]  they're trying to take away
[04:29:05.310 --> 04:29:07.310]  homegrown it's like a list of
[04:29:07.310 --> 04:29:09.310]  you know different companies
[04:29:09.310 --> 04:29:11.310]  that have all done the same thing they go and try
[04:29:11.310 --> 04:29:13.310]  to change the legislation using lobby
[04:29:13.310 --> 04:29:15.310]  groups and it's like they're it's almost
[04:29:15.310 --> 04:29:17.310]  just like you know legal bribery
[04:29:17.310 --> 04:29:19.310]  I think
[04:29:19.310 --> 04:29:21.310]  collectively a lot of people
[04:29:21.310 --> 04:29:23.310]  need to collectively
[04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:25.550]  put in to help
[04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:27.550]  that way
[04:29:27.550 --> 04:29:29.550]  there's not just a specific interest
[04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:31.550]  and it's like you know collectively
[04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:33.550]  beneficial that we keep legislation
[04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:35.550]  the way that it is here
[04:29:35.550 --> 04:29:37.550]  because if things change
[04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:39.550]  like they are in California and how
[04:29:39.550 --> 04:29:41.550]  they've developed in other states
[04:29:41.550 --> 04:29:43.550]  it becomes unfeasible
[04:29:43.550 --> 04:29:45.550]  and it hinders
[04:29:45.550 --> 04:29:47.550]  the economic growth that's happening because people
[04:29:47.550 --> 04:29:49.550]  are looking at Oklahoma
[04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:51.550]  why is Oklahoma being looked at it's not just
[04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:53.790]  because of the we it's because of
[04:29:53.790 --> 04:29:55.790]  all the economic growth
[04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:57.790]  that's happening
[04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:59.790]  as a side effect
[04:29:59.790 --> 04:30:01.790]  but collectively
[04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:03.790]  it's all up to us as business owners
[04:30:03.790 --> 04:30:05.790]  as consumers you have to know
[04:30:05.790 --> 04:30:07.790]  where you're buying products from
[04:30:07.790 --> 04:30:09.790]  you have to kind of be involved
[04:30:09.790 --> 04:30:11.790]  so I mean I try to do what I can to be involved
[04:30:11.790 --> 04:30:13.790]  yeah I think that's important
[04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:15.790]  not just in the cannabis industry but just
[04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:17.790]  like in the world that we live in
[04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:19.790]  as consumers on like
[04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:22.030]  being thoughtful about what you're buying
[04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:24.030]  who you're giving your money to
[04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:26.030]  I've made a few posts about it and I really
[04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:28.030]  am sincere about it
[04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:30.030]  like those of you out there that are patients
[04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:32.030]  probably every single one of you along with
[04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:34.030]  myself like I buy
[04:30:34.030 --> 04:30:36.030]  stuff from the dispensary
[04:30:36.030 --> 04:30:38.030]  I say who grew that
[04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:40.030]  you know what I mean I look into it
[04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:42.030]  I don't smoke a lot of weed from people that I don't
[04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:44.030]  know because I want to know
[04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:46.030]  I work really hard for my money
[04:30:46.030 --> 04:30:48.030]  and I don't get paid that well
[04:30:48.270 --> 04:30:50.270]  and where I give that money is really important
[04:30:50.270 --> 04:30:52.270]  and the only people
[04:30:52.270 --> 04:30:54.270]  that I want to build up are people
[04:30:54.270 --> 04:30:56.270]  that also want to build up other people
[04:30:56.270 --> 04:30:58.270]  too and if you're
[04:30:58.270 --> 04:31:00.270]  a shitty person I'm not trying
[04:31:00.270 --> 04:31:02.270]  or a shitty business I'm not trying to build you up
[04:31:02.270 --> 04:31:04.270]  I don't want you to have any
[04:31:04.270 --> 04:31:06.270]  power. Oklahoma whenever I
[04:31:06.270 --> 04:31:08.270]  came here I heard a big talk about
[04:31:08.270 --> 04:31:10.270]  oh it's stupid that Cookies is
[04:31:10.270 --> 04:31:12.270]  even trying to come to town
[04:31:12.270 --> 04:31:14.270]  I don't know why they would come here Oklahoma's not
[04:31:14.270 --> 04:31:16.270]  into that BS and then the day they
[04:31:16.510 --> 04:31:18.510]  open there's a mile long line out
[04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:20.510]  in front and I'm not
[04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:22.510]  talking trash on anybody
[04:31:22.510 --> 04:31:24.510]  but what I'm saying is you guys
[04:31:24.510 --> 04:31:26.510]  have the power and you give that
[04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:28.510]  power to who you support and who you give
[04:31:28.510 --> 04:31:30.510]  that money to. You don't go to Cookies
[04:31:30.510 --> 04:31:32.510]  and you don't buy their hoodie and you don't buy their
[04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:34.510]  weed that somebody in Oklahoma
[04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:36.510]  grew and that California company
[04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:38.510]  put their California based
[04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:40.510]  sticker on that Oklahoma
[04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:42.510]  grown weed by somebody
[04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:44.510]  that worked really hard and spent their
[04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:46.750]  money to grow that Oklahoma
[04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:48.750]  cannabis we put inside of that
[04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:50.750]  bag to build up their brand
[04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:52.750]  and it's like if that's what you
[04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:54.750]  want to do if you want to grow
[04:31:54.750 --> 04:31:56.750]  and you want to give all of your weed to Cookies and let
[04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:58.750]  them sell those Cookies I'm not here to tell
[04:31:58.750 --> 04:32:00.750]  anybody what to do but I'm telling
[04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:02.750]  you if you're thinking about
[04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:04.750]  caring go ahead and take the
[04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:06.750]  leap and do. Pull the trigger
[04:32:06.750 --> 04:32:08.750]  and really care about something
[04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:10.750]  and like
[04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:12.750]  be serious about it
[04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:14.990]  don't go into the dispensary and there's not something
[04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:16.990]  that you want and there's not
[04:32:16.990 --> 04:32:18.990]  a person that you respect in there that you
[04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:20.990]  want to build up
[04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:22.990]  swallow it go down the street
[04:32:22.990 --> 04:32:24.990]  find something that you want don't
[04:32:24.990 --> 04:32:26.990]  consistently settle for just something
[04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:28.990]  you know like we're all in this
[04:32:28.990 --> 04:32:30.990]  shit together we can really help
[04:32:30.990 --> 04:32:32.990]  each other out and like on our
[04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:34.990]  own like Brandon said
[04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:36.990]  we all have to it's a collective thing
[04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:38.990]  like there's a lot of us in this room
[04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:40.990]  right now that if I
[04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:42.990]  send an email to somebody they kick
[04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:44.990]  it out but if every single one of us
[04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:46.990]  that's a big real estate in their
[04:32:46.990 --> 04:32:48.990]  inbox you know it takes up a lot
[04:32:48.990 --> 04:32:50.990]  maybe they'll read one of them
[04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:52.990]  maybe one of you guys might be
[04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:54.990]  able to say something in an email that might
[04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:56.990]  really like grab somebody's
[04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:58.990]  attention you know maybe we can get something
[04:32:58.990 --> 04:33:00.990]  rolling at that point so again
[04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:02.990]  if you're thinking about caring
[04:33:02.990 --> 04:33:04.990]  pull the trigger and really just like start caring
[04:33:04.990 --> 04:33:06.990]  about it like ask the questions
[04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:08.990]  like and really like find out
[04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:10.990]  because like you have like a
[04:33:10.990 --> 04:33:12.990]  incredible amount of power because
[04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:14.990]  money makes the world go around
[04:33:14.990 --> 04:33:16.990]  in the world and like nothing happens
[04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:18.990]  like we test our
[04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:20.990]  cannabis because
[04:33:20.990 --> 04:33:22.990]  people make money from
[04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:24.990]  us testing our cannabis the state
[04:33:24.990 --> 04:33:26.990]  does not require us to test our cannabis
[04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:28.990]  for your safety if you think it's for your
[04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:30.990]  safety that we test cannabis you're crazy
[04:33:30.990 --> 04:33:32.990]  you don't know how the world works
[04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:34.990]  it's money everything is about money
[04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:36.990]  I wish it wasn't but it is
[04:33:36.990 --> 04:33:38.990]  like if I gave away every
[04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:40.990]  gram of ash and I didn't
[04:33:40.990 --> 04:33:42.990]  make any money and I starved to death
[04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:44.990]  I'm not going to be able to make any more ash for you guys
[04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:46.990]  so even if I don't want to
[04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:48.990]  have to make ash to keep going gardens
[04:33:48.990 --> 04:33:50.990]  have to get a certain amount per
[04:33:50.990 --> 04:33:52.990]  pound to be able to keep going if you
[04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:54.990]  want to just like only buy
[04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:56.990]  the cheapest material from the biggest
[04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:58.990]  growers that can afford raises
[04:33:58.990 --> 04:34:00.990]  in margins because they can
[04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:02.990]  have investment that will keep them going
[04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:04.990]  for 10 years until they're the
[04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:06.990]  only license in the state and they
[04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:08.990]  can make money by being
[04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:10.990]  40% of the
[04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:12.990]  market share you're
[04:34:12.990 --> 04:34:14.990]  not going to like that you're not going to like the product
[04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:16.990]  that comes with that and you
[04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:18.990]  as a patient ultimately
[04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:20.990]  you decide that maybe you don't know
[04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:22.990]  that right now and maybe in
[04:34:22.990 --> 04:34:24.990]  like 8 years you'll look back on it and be like
[04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:26.990]  damn really wish I would have
[04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:28.990]  drove the extra 5 miles and bought my
[04:34:28.990 --> 04:34:30.990]  homies weed that time because
[04:34:30.990 --> 04:34:32.990]  like he was struggling and he
[04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:34.990]  went under because like that
[04:34:34.990 --> 04:34:36.990]  just that crop didn't move
[04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:38.990]  and that snowballed into that that and that
[04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:40.990]  you know it's like cookies doesn't mean
[04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:42.990]  oh but if you know smoke cookies, smoke cookies
[04:34:42.990 --> 04:34:44.990]  but just
[04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:46.990]  know and be aware ask
[04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:48.990]  questions if you want care for you
[04:34:48.990 --> 04:34:50.990]  it's really important
[04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:52.990]  since you're bringing up certain genetics
[04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:54.990]  for a newbie that
[04:34:54.990 --> 04:34:56.990]  is wanting to get into this
[04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:58.990]  you know it is a lot of work to
[04:34:58.990 --> 04:35:00.990]  eventually then get your hands on and actually
[04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:02.990]  doing it and getting the experience
[04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:04.990]  so are there certain breeders that
[04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:06.990]  stick out where it's easier for you to
[04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:08.990]  watch and are there other cultivars
[04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:10.990]  within those breeders that you feel
[04:35:10.990 --> 04:35:12.990]  like it's an easy watch for a beginner
[04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:14.990]  sure so you asked me that question
[04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:16.990]  last time
[04:35:16.990 --> 04:35:18.990]  in Oklahoma City and
[04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:20.990]  I was a little bit nervous just because I didn't
[04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:22.990]  like want to like leave anybody out
[04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:24.990]  or create any
[04:35:24.990 --> 04:35:26.990]  friction between anybody and so I didn't
[04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:28.990]  say much and then once I left
[04:35:28.990 --> 04:35:30.990]  I sort of like thought about it and I wish
[04:35:30.990 --> 04:35:32.990]  I would have elaborated a bit more so I'm glad
[04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:34.990]  you asked
[04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:36.990]  I heard earlier like
[04:35:36.990 --> 04:35:38.990]  just if you're
[04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:40.990]  going to maybe try to like go and buy
[04:35:40.990 --> 04:35:42.990]  a pound of weed and wash it and
[04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:44.990]  make yourself hash like
[04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:46.990]  what can I do to help that
[04:35:46.990 --> 04:35:48.990]  maybe look for
[04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:50.990]  if you handle the material
[04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:52.990]  handle it you're going to want to feel
[04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:54.990]  more of like a grainy consistency
[04:35:54.990 --> 04:35:56.990]  if your hands get greasy your water
[04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:58.990]  is going to be greasy
[04:35:58.990 --> 04:36:00.990]  so stay away from like stuff that's
[04:36:00.990 --> 04:36:02.990]  like greasy a lot of like
[04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:04.990]  really high citrus sativas
[04:36:04.990 --> 04:36:06.990]  will melt and sort of
[04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:08.990]  be able to be sifted off
[04:36:08.990 --> 04:36:10.990]  so maybe stay away from like
[04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:12.990]  you know really strong
[04:36:12.990 --> 04:36:14.990]  like lemon that type of thing
[04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:16.990]  um
[04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:18.990]  chemdogs wash well
[04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:20.990]  wedding cake washes well
[04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:22.990]  uh
[04:36:22.990 --> 04:36:24.990]  gorilla glue normally washes
[04:36:24.990 --> 04:36:26.990]  well so if you can
[04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:28.990]  find some like you know
[04:36:28.990 --> 04:36:30.990]  whatever cake
[04:36:30.990 --> 04:36:32.990]  or uh
[04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:34.990]  whatever gorilla
[04:36:34.990 --> 04:36:36.990]  glue cross a lot of the times
[04:36:36.990 --> 04:36:38.990]  like I can't really tell you
[04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:40.990]  like go out and like buy these
[04:36:40.990 --> 04:36:42.990]  but if you can like find
[04:36:42.990 --> 04:36:44.990]  those three I would
[04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:46.990]  pick that over the other ones that you don't
[04:36:46.990 --> 04:36:48.990]  really like to know about but
[04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:50.990]  yeah do a jar test take a
[04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:52.990]  jar take a little bit of what you're
[04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:54.990]  going to wash maybe if you can weigh it
[04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:56.990]  out take 10 grams put it into a
[04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:58.990]  jar put some ice water in there give it a
[04:36:58.990 --> 04:37:00.990]  hell of a shake and uh
[04:37:00.990 --> 04:37:02.990]  like 10
[04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:04.990]  to 15 minutes shake it in the jar
[04:37:04.990 --> 04:37:06.990]  let it set and
[04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:08.990]  you'll at least be able to know if
[04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:10.990]  the trichomes are going to fall off and fall
[04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:12.990]  down to the bottom and be able to be collected
[04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:14.990]  or if they're just going to break open
[04:37:14.990 --> 04:37:16.990]  and be like uh
[04:37:16.990 --> 04:37:18.990]  oil mixed with water that you can't
[04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:20.990]  collect so if you're
[04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:22.990]  a grower you've got two strands
[04:37:22.990 --> 04:37:24.990]  put them both in the jar mix
[04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:26.990]  it up if you look at the bottom there's
[04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:28.990]  no trichomes in one if you're
[04:37:28.990 --> 04:37:30.990]  not going to smoke that as flour
[04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:32.990]  send that to the VHO guy
[04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:34.990]  I think hash is
[04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:36.990]  a superior product but if
[04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:38.990]  your whole garden
[04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:40.990]  gets put into the washing machine
[04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:42.990]  and it doesn't yield anything because it's not
[04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:44.990]  a hash machine I'm not going to tell you
[04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:46.990]  hey I washed it because it's a superior
[04:37:46.990 --> 04:37:48.990]  product because it's not it's not a superior
[04:37:48.990 --> 04:37:50.990]  in this instance
[04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:52.990]  you know what I mean so
[04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:54.990]  butane
[04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:56.990]  or hydrocarbon based
[04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:58.990]  extracts are better
[04:37:58.990 --> 04:38:00.990]  than hash if it's not going to yield
[04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:02.990]  more hash
[04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:04.990]  since you are washing so
[04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:06.990]  much what are numbers that you
[04:38:06.990 --> 04:38:08.990]  are seeing that's realistic I mean
[04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:10.990]  I know there's obviously two ends
[04:38:10.990 --> 04:38:12.990]  of that spectrum but where can we find that
[04:38:12.990 --> 04:38:14.990]  happy median that is
[04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:16.990]  making your time worth it but also
[04:38:16.990 --> 04:38:18.990]  you know obviously you need that
[04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:20.990]  material so the growers I know
[04:38:20.990 --> 04:38:22.990]  especially when they first got into this
[04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:24.990]  even just a few years ago
[04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:26.990]  they would lose a lot of money
[04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:28.990]  and you guys would lose a lot of money so then deals
[04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:30.990]  would run out and nobody has to work for each other
[04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:32.990]  right so
[04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:34.990]  I guess like with
[04:38:34.990 --> 04:38:36.990]  that being said
[04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:38.990]  so everybody
[04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:40.990]  has their
[04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:42.990]  horror stories of the hash
[04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:44.990]  maker that's ripped them off or the VHO
[04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:46.990]  share dukes that screwed them over
[04:38:46.990 --> 04:38:48.990]  you know and that
[04:38:48.990 --> 04:38:50.990]  happens you know it definitely happens
[04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:52.990]  I like to think that I
[04:38:52.990 --> 04:38:54.990]  am honest with everybody I
[04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:56.990]  keep really stringent paperwork
[04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:58.990]  if I
[04:38:58.990 --> 04:39:00.990]  wash for you you can
[04:39:00.990 --> 04:39:02.990]  give you paperwork at the end
[04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:04.990]  of it that tells you you know I
[04:39:04.990 --> 04:39:06.990]  took your hundred pounds I did it in these
[04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:08.990]  ten different washes my room was
[04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:10.990]  it tells you what temperature my
[04:39:10.990 --> 04:39:12.990]  room was how many washes I did what
[04:39:12.990 --> 04:39:14.990]  bags I pulled
[04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:16.990]  which one of my employees helped me
[04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:18.990]  wash it what day we
[04:39:18.990 --> 04:39:20.990]  washed it on how long it was in the free dryer
[04:39:20.990 --> 04:39:22.990]  or the shelf temp of the free dryer
[04:39:22.990 --> 04:39:24.990]  everything like that
[04:39:24.990 --> 04:39:26.990]  so
[04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:28.990]  what was the question
[04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:30.990]  one more time
[04:39:30.990 --> 04:39:32.990]  yeah but percentage of
[04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:34.990]  yield versus realistic
[04:39:34.990 --> 04:39:36.990]  so
[04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:38.990]  with that like on fresh frozen
[04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:40.990]  realistically
[04:39:42.990 --> 04:39:44.990]  two and a half percent
[04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:46.990]  somewhere between like two and a half to like
[04:39:46.990 --> 04:39:48.990]  five percent if you're getting five percent
[04:39:48.990 --> 04:39:50.990]  you're probably pretty happy off of it
[04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:52.990]  but yeah I mean
[04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:54.990]  I've washed stuff that is
[04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:56.990]  yielded literally a thousand grams yielded
[04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:58.990]  nothing and I've
[04:39:58.990 --> 04:40:00.990]  watched
[04:40:00.990 --> 04:40:02.990]  Gorilla Glue from Opie cultivator
[04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:04.990]  about two years ago
[04:40:04.990 --> 04:40:06.990]  and it yielded eleven and a half percent in the
[04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:08.990]  hash runs so
[04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:10.990]  which I thought at the time I
[04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:12.990]  screwed up and
[04:40:12.990 --> 04:40:14.990]  got something in this hash that was too much
[04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:16.990]  but I ended up getting second
[04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:18.990]  place with the color cup
[04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:20.990]  pretty good
[04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:22.990]  so you've got like that
[04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:24.990]  you don't really know
[04:40:24.990 --> 04:40:26.990]  it really sucks to
[04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:28.990]  put in twelve hundred grams of
[04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:30.990]  grape cuties and it was like
[04:40:30.990 --> 04:40:32.990]  beautiful flower
[04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:34.990]  I put it in there and I washed it and I literally
[04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:36.990]  didn't do anything
[04:40:36.990 --> 04:40:38.990]  it was like wash wash wash and didn't do anything
[04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:40.990]  you know and it was like so that was an
[04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:42.990]  eighteen hundred dollar mistake
[04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:44.990]  I bought twenty five hundred
[04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:46.990]  dollars worth of fresh frozen and I fit it
[04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:48.990]  into one of my little white jars
[04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:50.990]  so like that was like
[04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:52.990]  that really hurt
[04:40:52.990 --> 04:40:54.990]  you know so
[04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:56.990]  the acceptable yields
[04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:58.990]  is all opinion though because it's
[04:40:58.990 --> 04:41:00.990]  if you have
[04:41:00.990 --> 04:41:02.990]  a very expensive state of the art
[04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:04.990]  indoor facility that you're trying
[04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:06.990]  to pay off and your lead grower
[04:41:06.990 --> 04:41:08.990]  is paid two hundred thousand dollars a year
[04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:10.990]  then you need some stuff that yields
[04:41:10.990 --> 04:41:12.990]  about eight percent
[04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:14.990]  if you and your
[04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:16.990]  significant other have
[04:41:16.990 --> 04:41:18.990]  five acres of light depths outside
[04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:20.990]  that you have soaker lines on
[04:41:20.990 --> 04:41:22.990]  and your cost
[04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:24.990]  is really nothing then maybe one percent
[04:41:24.990 --> 04:41:26.990]  is just fine you know so
[04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:28.990]  acceptable percentage is what we try
[04:41:28.990 --> 04:41:32.390]  but
[04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:34.390]  average two and a half
[04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:36.390]  I'd say
[04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:38.390]  and then
[04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:40.390]  when you hear fish stories
[04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:42.390]  basically of stuff like what is
[04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:44.390]  to the cap what do you think
[04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:46.390]  like some of the best farmers in the world
[04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:48.390]  what percentage yields are we getting
[04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:50.390]  there
[04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:52.390]  I mean
[04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:54.390]  before
[04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:56.390]  I watched that stuff from OD Cultivator
[04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:58.390]  that yielded eleven and a half percent
[04:41:58.390 --> 04:42:00.390]  I wouldn't really believe that anybody got over
[04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:02.390]  seven percent I mean I got like
[04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:04.390]  six and a half at that time and I was like there's so
[04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:06.390]  much cash here it's unreal
[04:42:06.390 --> 04:42:08.390]  and then out of nowhere it was like eleven and a half
[04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:10.390]  and I literally
[04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:12.390]  took the hash
[04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:14.390]  poured it onto the scale
[04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:16.390]  and like I looked at the way I did
[04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:18.390]  the rough estimate in my head and I
[04:42:18.390 --> 04:42:20.390]  told my partner I was like dude I screwed up
[04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:22.390]  I don't know if I over
[04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:24.390]  washed it I got like every head and
[04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:26.390]  every stock and the whole bag
[04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:28.390]  in here like I don't get like where all this weight
[04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:30.390]  could come from he took a pinch
[04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:32.390]  of it he put it in the banger and it melted like
[04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:34.390]  and at that point I was like oh
[04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:36.390]  I'm it was hard
[04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:38.390]  for me to believe I literally thought I screwed it
[04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:40.390]  up and then I was like okay
[04:42:40.390 --> 04:42:42.390]  because that was it was it yielded
[04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:44.390]  thirteen percent
[04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:46.390]  and so I was like okay I screwed it up
[04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:48.390]  I took that thirteen percent
[04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:50.390]  of bubble hash I pressed it into
[04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:52.390]  hash rods and we jarred it up
[04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:54.390]  into one grams
[04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:56.390]  and it was eleven point two percent
[04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:58.390]  of the fresh frozen weight
[04:42:58.390 --> 04:43:00.390]  so I was
[04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:02.390]  if it wasn't me right there
[04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:04.390]  in the room I wouldn't have believed that I did that
[04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:08.390]  it can be done so like
[04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:10.390]  we bred for like a very
[04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:12.390]  long time to just get like really
[04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:14.390]  fat flowers
[04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:16.390]  that yeah like had like
[04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:18.390]  a smell to them and looked good in a
[04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:20.390]  bag but we weren't like focused
[04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:22.390]  for like twenty five years on growing
[04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:24.390]  resin that holds together
[04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:26.390]  ice water hash
[04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:28.390]  and like there's like I don't know
[04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:30.390]  four or five breeders that have been
[04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:32.390]  focused on that for you know
[04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:34.390]  really like less than like ten years now
[04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:36.390]  so
[04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:38.390]  ten years from right now it'll probably be
[04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:40.390]  you know probably be what we're getting
[04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:42.390]  twelve percent consistently
[04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:44.390]  you know
[04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:46.390]  once we've spent twenty years
[04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:48.390]  breeding for
[04:43:48.390 --> 04:43:50.390]  ice water extraction
[04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:52.390]  based extractions I guess
[04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:54.390]  any of those
[04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:56.390]  it's kind of jumping around for the static
[04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:58.390]  tech do you feel like
[04:43:58.390 --> 04:44:00.390]  the amount of effort that it's taking
[04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:02.390]  is still a learning curve for a lot of people
[04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:04.390]  do you feel like that's worth learning
[04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:07.790]  yeah
[04:44:07.790 --> 04:44:09.790]  I feel like everything is worth
[04:44:09.790 --> 04:44:11.790]  learning if you
[04:44:11.790 --> 04:44:13.790]  want to like you should never stop
[04:44:13.790 --> 04:44:15.790]  like learning stuff so I'm not
[04:44:15.790 --> 04:44:17.790]  going to tell you not to learn it do I think it's
[04:44:17.790 --> 04:44:19.790]  worth learning
[04:44:19.790 --> 04:44:21.790]  yeah
[04:44:21.790 --> 04:44:23.790]  if you like
[04:44:23.790 --> 04:44:25.790]  full melt dry sieve like if that's something
[04:44:25.790 --> 04:44:27.790]  you like that makes you happy at night
[04:44:27.790 --> 04:44:29.790]  time
[04:44:29.790 --> 04:44:31.790]  then by all means like do that I'd rather
[04:44:31.790 --> 04:44:33.790]  it's just
[04:44:33.790 --> 04:44:35.790]  so hard to get like a dry sieve
[04:44:35.790 --> 04:44:37.790]  that like you get it you get the dry
[04:44:37.790 --> 04:44:39.790]  sieve you press it out you dab it and you're like
[04:44:39.790 --> 04:44:41.790]  yeah like it's so
[04:44:41.790 --> 04:44:43.790]  rare to get that and it's like
[04:44:43.790 --> 04:44:45.790]  just take the same stuff put it in some ice water
[04:44:45.790 --> 04:44:47.790]  freeze dry that hatch
[04:44:47.790 --> 04:44:49.790]  press it out dab it you're going to like it
[04:44:49.790 --> 04:44:51.790]  you know what I mean unless you like screwed
[04:44:51.790 --> 04:44:53.790]  something up like you're probably going to like it
[04:44:53.790 --> 04:44:55.790]  so like
[04:44:55.790 --> 04:44:57.790]  do I think it's worth it
[04:44:57.790 --> 04:44:59.790]  like yeah just to learn
[04:44:59.790 --> 04:45:01.790]  a new process but I haven't
[04:45:01.790 --> 04:45:03.790]  learned it or perfected it
[04:45:03.790 --> 04:45:05.790]  I've been doing it for quite a while I'm still
[04:45:05.790 --> 04:45:07.790]  trying to like I'm still trying
[04:45:07.790 --> 04:45:09.790]  to get my head wrapped around just bubble bath
[04:45:09.790 --> 04:45:11.790]  you know I've been doing it for a long time
[04:45:11.790 --> 04:45:13.790]  and I still I change
[04:45:13.790 --> 04:45:15.790]  up my method
[04:45:15.790 --> 04:45:17.790]  probably 80% every
[04:45:17.790 --> 04:45:19.790]  two years it's 80% different
[04:45:19.790 --> 04:45:21.790]  than I did it the two years before that
[04:45:21.790 --> 04:45:23.790]  just find
[04:45:23.790 --> 04:45:25.790]  better ways easier ways to make it
[04:45:25.790 --> 04:45:27.790]  more of a consistent product
[04:45:27.790 --> 04:45:29.790]  I used to press 10 gram pucks
[04:45:29.790 --> 04:45:31.790]  at a time so I'd take bubble
[04:45:31.790 --> 04:45:33.790]  press it into 10 gram pucks and press
[04:45:33.790 --> 04:45:35.790]  that and now I press 75
[04:45:35.790 --> 04:45:37.790]  gram pucks because
[04:45:37.790 --> 04:45:39.790]  one is faster
[04:45:39.790 --> 04:45:41.790]  and two
[04:45:41.790 --> 04:45:43.790]  whenever I get to the end and I have 500
[04:45:43.790 --> 04:45:45.790]  grams of hatch I really only have
[04:45:45.790 --> 04:45:47.790]  the difference of 6 presses
[04:45:47.790 --> 04:45:49.790]  not 35 presses
[04:45:49.790 --> 04:45:51.790]  you know because it's
[04:45:51.790 --> 04:45:53.790]  a seventh the chance for
[04:45:53.790 --> 04:45:55.790]  your back to blow out it's a seventh
[04:45:55.790 --> 04:45:57.790]  of the chance for you to press it too long
[04:45:57.790 --> 04:45:59.790]  you know it's like all this different
[04:45:59.790 --> 04:46:01.790]  thing like you just put 500 grams
[04:46:01.790 --> 04:46:03.790]  in there and do one
[04:46:03.790 --> 04:46:05.790]  that one comes out perfect
[04:46:05.790 --> 04:46:07.790]  in my opinion that's the best
[04:46:07.790 --> 04:46:09.790]  80% consistent product
[04:46:09.790 --> 04:46:11.790]  like we had mentioned with Danny
[04:46:11.790 --> 04:46:13.790]  before when we first
[04:46:13.790 --> 04:46:15.790]  were starting out we didn't have a bunch of material
[04:46:15.790 --> 04:46:17.790]  it was still illegal so
[04:46:17.790 --> 04:46:19.790]  when we were trying to figure this stuff out
[04:46:19.790 --> 04:46:21.790]  we did have a blow out
[04:46:21.790 --> 04:46:23.790]  the fact that
[04:46:23.790 --> 04:46:25.790]  today there's even more people
[04:46:25.790 --> 04:46:27.790]  in the room as well as on
[04:46:27.790 --> 04:46:29.790]  Pinch of Canada's project if you could just minimize
[04:46:29.790 --> 04:46:31.790]  never having a blow out from
[04:46:31.790 --> 04:46:33.790]  day one I think you're going to
[04:46:33.790 --> 04:46:35.790]  enjoy this a lot more
[04:46:35.790 --> 04:46:37.790]  and want to continue your educational
[04:46:37.790 --> 04:46:39.790]  road down this path
[04:46:39.790 --> 04:46:41.790]  to really taking it from an agency farm
[04:46:41.790 --> 04:46:43.790]  right yeah
[04:46:43.790 --> 04:46:45.790]  use
[04:46:45.790 --> 04:46:47.790]  evolution decks
[04:46:47.790 --> 04:46:49.790]  and
[04:46:49.790 --> 04:46:51.790]  if you press and hash put your hash
[04:46:51.790 --> 04:46:53.790]  inside of a 25 micron
[04:46:53.790 --> 04:46:55.790]  bag and put that 25 micron
[04:46:55.790 --> 04:46:57.790]  bag inside of a
[04:46:57.790 --> 04:46:59.790]  37
[04:46:59.790 --> 04:47:01.790]  and it's a little bit unorthodox what I
[04:47:01.790 --> 04:47:03.790]  do but I press it 100 degrees Celsius
[04:47:03.790 --> 04:47:05.790]  which is about 212 degrees
[04:47:05.790 --> 04:47:07.790]  Fahrenheit which is
[04:47:07.790 --> 04:47:09.790]  pretty hot but like I said I press 75
[04:47:09.790 --> 04:47:11.790]  grams and that 75 grams
[04:47:11.790 --> 04:47:13.790]  is only on this press
[04:47:13.790 --> 04:47:15.790]  for about 30 seconds
[04:47:15.790 --> 04:47:17.790]  and so in my opinion
[04:47:17.790 --> 04:47:19.790]  the time
[04:47:19.790 --> 04:47:21.790]  to the exposure to really
[04:47:21.790 --> 04:47:23.790]  any heat at all is more detrimental
[04:47:23.790 --> 04:47:25.790]  to like
[04:47:25.790 --> 04:47:27.790]  what the actual heat is
[04:47:27.790 --> 04:47:29.790]  under
[04:47:29.790 --> 04:47:31.790]  210, 215
[04:47:31.790 --> 04:47:33.790]  I'm not saying take it up to 300
[04:47:33.790 --> 04:47:35.790]  I'd rather
[04:47:35.790 --> 04:47:37.790]  put it at 212, stick
[04:47:37.790 --> 04:47:39.790]  it in and it just shoots off
[04:47:39.790 --> 04:47:41.790]  and it's only on there for 30 seconds
[04:47:41.790 --> 04:47:43.790]  put it on there at 160
[04:47:43.790 --> 04:47:45.790]  and it takes 3 minutes for it to
[04:47:45.790 --> 04:47:47.790]  all come off I feel like that's harder
[04:47:47.790 --> 04:47:49.790]  on the hash and I don't
[04:47:49.790 --> 04:47:51.790]  I don't know
[04:47:51.790 --> 04:47:53.790]  I had a blowout the other day
[04:47:53.790 --> 04:47:55.790]  I was trying to stick too much hash in the bag
[04:47:55.790 --> 04:47:57.790]  and I was in a hurry
[04:47:57.790 --> 04:47:59.790]  but okay so if you're
[04:47:59.790 --> 04:48:01.790]  pressing right and you're
[04:48:01.790 --> 04:48:03.790]  halfway through your press
[04:48:03.790 --> 04:48:05.790]  and it starts to like shit
[04:48:05.790 --> 04:48:07.790]  out on you or leak out on you
[04:48:07.790 --> 04:48:09.790]  right just keep
[04:48:09.790 --> 04:48:11.790]  going don't apply any more
[04:48:11.790 --> 04:48:13.790]  pressure just stop right
[04:48:13.790 --> 04:48:15.790]  then and let it keep coming
[04:48:15.790 --> 04:48:17.790]  let it keep coming
[04:48:17.790 --> 04:48:19.790]  let off on it take your paper
[04:48:19.790 --> 04:48:21.790]  out take all of that
[04:48:21.790 --> 04:48:23.790]  and roll get all of the
[04:48:23.790 --> 04:48:25.790]  hash that's came out of it off
[04:48:25.790 --> 04:48:27.790]  take that put that into a new
[04:48:27.790 --> 04:48:29.790]  25 bag and just repress
[04:48:29.790 --> 04:48:31.790]  it the other
[04:48:31.790 --> 04:48:33.790]  bag the bag that has the hash
[04:48:33.790 --> 04:48:35.790]  in it if you can take it and you can
[04:48:35.790 --> 04:48:37.790]  fold it in half just put it in a whole other
[04:48:37.790 --> 04:48:39.790]  bag if you can't take a
[04:48:39.790 --> 04:48:41.790]  pair of scissors and like really
[04:48:41.790 --> 04:48:43.790]  quickly go
[04:48:43.790 --> 04:48:45.790]  and it'll cut it without sticking to it
[04:48:45.790 --> 04:48:47.790]  you can cut it into chunks and then put those
[04:48:47.790 --> 04:48:49.790]  chunks into a bag and you can
[04:48:49.790 --> 04:48:51.790]  sort of like strain
[04:48:51.790 --> 04:48:53.790]  all of your stuff it's gonna be like one step
[04:48:53.790 --> 04:48:55.790]  as good as if you
[04:48:55.790 --> 04:48:57.790]  wouldn't have screwed up but
[04:48:57.790 --> 04:48:59.790]  it's a way to keep from oh I wasted that
[04:48:59.790 --> 04:49:01.790]  $100 for the hash
[04:49:01.790 --> 04:49:03.790]  cause then what's left is like minimal I got
[04:49:03.790 --> 04:49:05.790]  smooth on the whole week
[04:49:05.790 --> 04:49:07.790]  can you rank
[04:49:07.790 --> 04:49:09.790]  grow length sources for
[04:49:09.790 --> 04:49:11.790]  quality of taste of final
[04:49:11.790 --> 04:49:13.790]  product? sun is
[04:49:13.790 --> 04:49:15.790]  number one
[04:49:15.790 --> 04:49:17.790]  uh
[04:49:17.790 --> 04:49:19.790]  yeah
[04:49:19.790 --> 04:49:21.790]  I'll say that sun is number one
[04:49:21.790 --> 04:49:23.790]  um so the reason
[04:49:23.790 --> 04:49:25.790]  I think sun is number one is
[04:49:25.790 --> 04:49:27.790]  the sun is the best source of
[04:49:27.790 --> 04:49:29.790]  UV that we
[04:49:29.790 --> 04:49:31.790]  know uh UV
[04:49:31.790 --> 04:49:33.790]  is what causes resin
[04:49:33.790 --> 04:49:35.790]  in terpene production
[04:49:35.790 --> 04:49:37.790]  so I'm looking
[04:49:37.790 --> 04:49:39.790]  for resin in terpenes
[04:49:39.790 --> 04:49:41.790]  so if you're gonna take
[04:49:41.790 --> 04:49:43.790]  a plant that uses
[04:49:43.790 --> 04:49:45.790]  UV to produce what I
[04:49:45.790 --> 04:49:47.790]  want and put it under a light source
[04:49:47.790 --> 04:49:49.790]  that doesn't have any UV in it
[04:49:49.790 --> 04:49:51.790]  in my opinion
[04:49:51.790 --> 04:49:53.790]  why do it but
[04:49:53.790 --> 04:49:55.790]  yeah so
[04:49:55.790 --> 04:49:57.790]  sun is
[04:49:57.790 --> 04:49:59.790]  number one all the rest is
[04:49:59.790 --> 04:50:01.790]  not the best
[04:50:01.790 --> 04:50:03.790]  I guess I don't know
[04:50:03.790 --> 04:50:05.790]  they're making a lot of
[04:50:05.790 --> 04:50:07.790]  leeway into like LEDs
[04:50:07.790 --> 04:50:09.790]  I don't have a lot of experience
[04:50:09.790 --> 04:50:11.790]  using LEDs
[04:50:11.790 --> 04:50:13.790]  I've always been kind of worried cause every
[04:50:13.790 --> 04:50:15.790]  two years it's like oh this
[04:50:15.790 --> 04:50:17.790]  is the best LED ever and then all of a sudden
[04:50:17.790 --> 04:50:19.790]  it's like the worst LED ever and you're silly
[04:50:19.790 --> 04:50:21.790]  for using it so I've never pulled the
[04:50:21.790 --> 04:50:23.790]  trigger to buy a bunch of LEDs
[04:50:23.790 --> 04:50:25.790]  um I personally in my
[04:50:25.790 --> 04:50:27.790]  garden right now have CMHs
[04:50:27.790 --> 04:50:29.790]  um
[04:50:29.790 --> 04:50:31.790]  I've got lower ceilings
[04:50:31.790 --> 04:50:33.790]  so I've got
[04:50:33.790 --> 04:50:35.790]  650 watts, 1000 watts
[04:50:35.790 --> 04:50:37.790]  um
[04:50:37.790 --> 04:50:39.790]  yeah so
[04:50:39.790 --> 04:50:41.790]  yeah outdoor
[04:50:41.790 --> 04:50:43.790]  greenhouse is like if you're
[04:50:43.790 --> 04:50:45.790]  in my opinion greenhouse
[04:50:45.790 --> 04:50:47.790]  if you get like a really proper greenhouse
[04:50:47.790 --> 04:50:49.790]  it's like better than inside
[04:50:49.790 --> 04:50:51.790]  like inside where the
[04:50:51.790 --> 04:50:53.790]  sun can come in
[04:50:53.790 --> 04:50:58.530]  any more questions?
[04:50:58.530 --> 04:51:00.530]  alright
[04:51:00.530 --> 04:51:02.530]  I'm gonna set this up for Marco
[04:51:02.530 --> 04:51:04.530]  as our next speaker
[04:51:04.530 --> 04:51:06.530]  so let me set all that up
[04:51:06.530 --> 04:51:08.530]  alright thanks again
[04:51:08.530 --> 04:51:10.530]  thank you very much
[04:51:10.530 --> 04:51:12.530]  and for the real quick
[04:51:12.530 --> 04:51:14.530]  we mentioned your social media
[04:51:14.530 --> 04:51:16.530]  and stuff for a few people
[04:51:16.530 --> 04:51:18.530]  yeah my social media is
[04:51:18.530 --> 04:51:20.530]  lostrootshash and so it's
[04:51:20.530 --> 04:51:22.530]  got underscores in between
[04:51:22.530 --> 04:51:24.530]  the lost and the roots
[04:51:24.530 --> 04:51:26.530]  lost underscore
[04:51:26.530 --> 04:51:28.530]  roots underscore hash
[04:51:28.530 --> 04:51:30.530]  um and then
[04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:32.530]  my Smith Valley account
[04:51:32.530 --> 04:51:34.530]  got deleted because I shared a picture
[04:51:34.530 --> 04:51:36.530]  of a sticker
[04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:38.530]  and somebody said that that was me selling weed
[04:51:38.530 --> 04:51:40.530]  and so that got deleted
[04:51:40.530 --> 04:51:42.530]  but uh yeah
[04:51:42.530 --> 04:51:44.530]  lostrootshash
[04:51:44.530 --> 04:51:46.530]  Smith underscore valley as well
[04:51:46.530 --> 04:51:48.530]  and uh again thanks
[04:51:48.530 --> 04:51:50.530]  applause
[04:51:50.530 --> 04:51:57.840]  alright so
[04:51:57.840 --> 04:51:59.840]  you know I'm trying to put
[04:51:59.840 --> 04:52:01.840]  a lot of things together and trying to get behind
[04:52:01.840 --> 04:52:03.840]  the scenes we got a lot of stuff going on
[04:52:03.840 --> 04:52:05.840]  the next speaker that I have coming up
[04:52:05.840 --> 04:52:07.840]  is a becoming
[04:52:07.840 --> 04:52:09.840]  really a family member to me
[04:52:09.840 --> 04:52:11.840]  you know we actually met for the first
[04:52:11.840 --> 04:52:13.840]  time today physically but we've been
[04:52:13.840 --> 04:52:15.840]  talking on social media and all that
[04:52:15.840 --> 04:52:17.840]  kind of stuff for a long time
[04:52:17.840 --> 04:52:19.840]  so Marco and I are moving into
[04:52:19.840 --> 04:52:21.840]  not only having
[04:52:21.840 --> 04:52:23.840]  not only do I have a show on Thursdays
[04:52:23.840 --> 04:52:25.840]  but Marco and I are now gonna have a show on future
[04:52:25.840 --> 04:52:27.840]  campus project as well
[04:52:27.840 --> 04:52:29.840]  so I feel like as this continues to grow
[04:52:29.840 --> 04:52:31.840]  there's just a lot of opportunity
[04:52:31.840 --> 04:52:33.840]  that's gonna come from Marco and myself
[04:52:33.840 --> 04:52:35.840]  and so I really appreciate the fact that you came
[04:52:35.840 --> 04:52:37.840]  out here bro you know you flew out here
[04:52:37.840 --> 04:52:39.840]  there's a lot of people that you know
[04:52:39.840 --> 04:52:41.840]  myself included that drove from
[04:52:41.840 --> 04:52:43.840]  Colorado you know that's about an 11 hour drive
[04:52:43.840 --> 04:52:45.840]  I know there's a gentleman that
[04:52:45.840 --> 04:52:47.840]  right actually right here that drove from
[04:52:47.840 --> 04:52:49.840]  Chicago you know so a lot of people
[04:52:49.840 --> 04:52:51.840]  put time into this and I'm excited
[04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:53.840]  that we're gonna be able to put it on the future campus
[04:52:53.840 --> 04:52:55.840]  project for it's out there forever
[04:52:55.840 --> 04:52:57.840]  because this is the kind of content that
[04:52:57.840 --> 04:52:59.840]  I wish I would have when I first started doing
[04:52:59.840 --> 04:53:01.840]  this so again Marco is
[04:53:01.840 --> 04:53:03.840]  next level I mean there's a reason why
[04:53:03.840 --> 04:53:05.840]  Brandon Russ is the next
[04:53:05.840 --> 04:53:07.840]  speaker as well there's a reason
[04:53:07.840 --> 04:53:09.840]  why these guys are hand selected because I want
[04:53:09.840 --> 04:53:11.840]  to minimize your experience
[04:53:11.840 --> 04:53:13.840]  in making mistakes really
[04:53:13.840 --> 04:53:15.840]  I mean my family suffered
[04:53:15.840 --> 04:53:17.840]  tremendously when I was first starting to understand
[04:53:17.840 --> 04:53:19.840]  how to do this kind of stuff and Marco
[04:53:19.840 --> 04:53:21.840]  is another gentleman that understands the A
[04:53:21.840 --> 04:53:23.840]  Z of what it's really going to take to
[04:53:23.840 --> 04:53:25.840]  build up that soil system
[04:53:25.840 --> 04:53:27.840]  alright so Marco
[04:53:27.840 --> 04:53:36.550]  I'm gonna bring a stool up
[04:53:36.550 --> 04:53:38.550]  here
[04:53:51.120 --> 04:53:53.120]  can y'all hear me alright
[04:54:05.300 --> 04:54:07.300]  alright appreciate y'all
[04:54:07.300 --> 04:54:09.300]  thanks for having me out here
[04:54:18.360 --> 04:54:20.360]  alright cool
[04:54:22.360 --> 04:54:24.360]  Instagram folks
[04:54:24.360 --> 04:54:26.360]  YouTube folks
[04:54:26.360 --> 04:54:28.360]  everybody here live
[04:54:28.360 --> 04:54:30.360]  appreciate y'all
[04:54:30.360 --> 04:54:32.360]  first time out to Tulsa
[04:54:32.360 --> 04:54:34.360]  Oklahoma
[04:54:34.360 --> 04:54:36.360]  and a lot of history out here
[04:54:36.360 --> 04:54:38.360]  y'all know that
[04:54:38.360 --> 04:54:40.360]  you know I couldn't be up here without
[04:54:40.360 --> 04:54:42.360]  mentioning some of that I went to Greenwood today
[04:54:42.360 --> 04:54:44.360]  which was you know if you don't know about
[04:54:44.360 --> 04:54:46.360]  it read about it
[04:54:46.360 --> 04:54:48.360]  if something happens once it could happen again
[04:54:48.360 --> 04:54:50.360]  so just know your
[04:54:50.360 --> 04:54:52.360]  history but I'm not here for that
[04:54:52.360 --> 04:54:54.360]  I'm here just to talk about living
[04:54:54.360 --> 04:54:56.360]  soil and just to
[04:54:56.360 --> 04:54:58.360]  piggyback on what some of the other
[04:54:58.360 --> 04:55:00.360]  folks were talking about
[04:55:00.360 --> 04:55:02.360]  you know if you're looking to
[04:55:02.360 --> 04:55:04.360]  cultivate
[04:55:04.360 --> 04:55:06.360]  plants and you want them clean
[04:55:06.360 --> 04:55:08.360]  I mean a lot of folks were just talking
[04:55:08.360 --> 04:55:10.360]  about ash obviously that's a very
[04:55:10.360 --> 04:55:12.360]  clean product
[04:55:12.360 --> 04:55:14.360]  to me there's no cleaner way to grow
[04:55:14.360 --> 04:55:16.360]  than living soil
[04:55:16.360 --> 04:55:18.360]  natural farming style
[04:55:18.360 --> 04:55:20.360]  I consider myself a natural farmer
[04:55:20.360 --> 04:55:22.360]  so I kind of
[04:55:22.360 --> 04:55:24.360]  want to just talk about my process
[04:55:24.360 --> 04:55:26.360]  for creating
[04:55:26.360 --> 04:55:28.360]  an indoor
[04:55:28.360 --> 04:55:30.360]  no-till
[04:55:30.360 --> 04:55:32.360]  living soil
[04:55:32.360 --> 04:55:34.360]  and with parts of it being
[04:55:34.360 --> 04:55:36.360]  wild crafted I go
[04:55:36.360 --> 04:55:38.360]  to nature and look for things
[04:55:38.360 --> 04:55:40.360]  and I also do it in a horizontal
[04:55:40.360 --> 04:55:42.360]  way I don't know if you guys know about
[04:55:42.360 --> 04:55:44.360]  horizontal soil
[04:55:44.360 --> 04:55:46.360]  basically as soil is
[04:55:46.360 --> 04:55:48.360]  created in nature
[04:55:48.360 --> 04:55:50.360]  it starts from rock
[04:55:50.360 --> 04:55:52.360]  and then through weathering
[04:55:52.360 --> 04:55:54.360]  and different
[04:55:54.360 --> 04:55:56.360]  plants and
[04:55:56.360 --> 04:55:58.360]  microbes it basically breaks that
[04:55:58.360 --> 04:56:00.360]  rock down and turns it into soil
[04:56:00.360 --> 04:56:02.360]  in a long term sense
[04:56:02.360 --> 04:56:04.360]  obviously we can't
[04:56:04.360 --> 04:56:06.360]  break rock down indoors
[04:56:06.360 --> 04:56:08.360]  and turn it into soil it takes
[04:56:08.360 --> 04:56:10.360]  millions of years so
[04:56:10.360 --> 04:56:12.360]  I like the horizontal
[04:56:12.360 --> 04:56:14.360]  method because what I do
[04:56:14.360 --> 04:56:16.360]  is I start at the
[04:56:16.360 --> 04:56:18.360]  at the
[04:56:18.360 --> 04:56:20.360]  our top horizon is
[04:56:20.360 --> 04:56:22.360]  our O horizon and
[04:56:22.360 --> 04:56:24.360]  that's basically organic material
[04:56:24.360 --> 04:56:26.360]  our middle horizon
[04:56:26.360 --> 04:56:28.360]  is kind of like your
[04:56:28.360 --> 04:56:30.360]  workforce and that's basically
[04:56:30.360 --> 04:56:32.360]  all of your
[04:56:32.360 --> 04:56:34.360]  minerals, humus
[04:56:34.360 --> 04:56:36.360]  nutrients and things like
[04:56:36.360 --> 04:56:38.360]  that that your plants roots will
[04:56:38.360 --> 04:56:40.360]  grow in and uptake
[04:56:40.360 --> 04:56:42.360]  and then that lower horizon that we're
[04:56:42.360 --> 04:56:44.360]  going to use in our soil bed will be your
[04:56:44.360 --> 04:56:46.360]  your E horizon
[04:56:46.360 --> 04:56:48.360]  and that's basically your
[04:56:48.360 --> 04:56:50.360]  gravel, sand, silk
[04:56:50.360 --> 04:56:52.360]  and it's more
[04:56:52.360 --> 04:56:54.360]  like a sand filter pretty much
[04:56:54.360 --> 04:56:56.360]  with that horizon
[04:56:56.360 --> 04:56:58.360]  so what I like to
[04:56:58.360 --> 04:57:00.360]  do is I start with a
[04:57:00.360 --> 04:57:02.360]  you know like I said a good
[04:57:02.360 --> 04:57:04.360]  4x4 bed interior
[04:57:04.360 --> 04:57:06.360]  living
[04:57:06.360 --> 04:57:08.360]  living soil starting with your
[04:57:08.360 --> 04:57:10.360]  E horizon
[04:57:10.360 --> 04:57:12.360]  I'll start with lava rock
[04:57:12.360 --> 04:57:14.360]  and then I'll go from on top
[04:57:14.360 --> 04:57:16.360]  of the lava rock I'll go with coarse
[04:57:16.360 --> 04:57:18.360]  gravel
[04:57:18.360 --> 04:57:20.360]  and I like the lava rock basically
[04:57:20.360 --> 04:57:22.360]  it's porous
[04:57:22.360 --> 04:57:24.360]  it's clean, you know you always get your
[04:57:24.360 --> 04:57:26.360]  clean sources for anything
[04:57:26.360 --> 04:57:28.360]  you're growing
[04:57:28.360 --> 04:57:30.360]  your plants in
[04:57:30.360 --> 04:57:32.360]  basically lava rock
[04:57:32.360 --> 04:57:34.360]  gravel and then
[04:57:34.360 --> 04:57:36.360]  river silt
[04:57:36.360 --> 04:57:38.360]  and sand
[04:57:38.360 --> 04:57:40.360]  create about a 4 inch
[04:57:40.360 --> 04:57:42.360]  gravel layer on the bottom and that's kind of
[04:57:42.360 --> 04:57:44.360]  like your filter layer
[04:57:44.360 --> 04:57:46.360]  and
[04:57:46.360 --> 04:57:48.360]  let me look at my notes a little bit too
[04:57:54.360 --> 04:57:56.360]  yep and then basically your E horizon
[04:57:56.360 --> 04:57:58.360]  is your alluvial layer
[04:57:58.360 --> 04:58:00.360]  I don't know if you guys ever watched like
[04:58:00.360 --> 04:58:02.360]  Gold Rush or seen like Gold Mine
[04:58:02.360 --> 04:58:04.360]  or stuff like that
[04:58:04.360 --> 04:58:06.360]  what they're doing is they're capturing gold
[04:58:06.360 --> 04:58:08.360]  it's alluvial in the alluvial layer
[04:58:08.360 --> 04:58:10.360]  and what that means is setting on top of the bedrock
[04:58:10.360 --> 04:58:12.360]  so for our indoor bed
[04:58:12.360 --> 04:58:14.360]  we don't need bedrock
[04:58:14.360 --> 04:58:16.360]  so we're going to start at that level right above
[04:58:16.360 --> 04:58:18.360]  the bedrock and that's basically
[04:58:18.360 --> 04:58:20.360]  your E horizon which is your
[04:58:20.360 --> 04:58:22.360]  filter
[04:58:22.360 --> 04:58:24.360]  now
[04:58:24.360 --> 04:58:26.360]  I guess this would be kind of
[04:58:26.360 --> 04:58:28.360]  this is your bed
[04:58:28.360 --> 04:58:30.360]  this would be your E horizon on the
[04:58:30.360 --> 04:58:32.360]  bottom, this would be your A horizon
[04:58:32.360 --> 04:58:34.360]  and your alluvial on the top
[04:58:34.360 --> 04:58:36.360]  just to give you kind of a
[04:58:36.360 --> 04:58:38.360]  reference
[04:58:38.360 --> 04:58:40.360]  so to make our
[04:58:40.360 --> 04:58:42.360]  A horizon there's a little bit more detail
[04:58:44.360 --> 04:58:46.360]  and to get into that we need to talk
[04:58:46.360 --> 04:58:48.360]  about indigenous microorganisms
[04:58:48.360 --> 04:58:50.360]  because that's pretty much the key
[04:58:50.360 --> 04:58:52.360]  component of your soil
[04:58:52.360 --> 04:58:54.360]  so
[04:58:54.360 --> 04:58:56.360]  now you made our
[04:58:56.360 --> 04:58:58.360]  E horizon which is basically
[04:58:58.360 --> 04:59:00.360]  gravel, sand, river,
[04:59:00.360 --> 04:59:02.360]  silt, and
[04:59:02.360 --> 04:59:04.360]  locally harvested
[04:59:04.360 --> 04:59:06.360]  things like that which are our filter
[04:59:06.360 --> 04:59:08.360]  now for our A horizon that's our
[04:59:08.360 --> 04:59:10.360]  workhorse, that's going to be our horizon
[04:59:10.360 --> 04:59:12.360]  it's going to be basically
[04:59:16.360 --> 04:59:18.360]  going to basically be our top soil
[04:59:20.360 --> 04:59:22.360]  lots of humus, lots of nutrients
[04:59:22.360 --> 04:59:24.360]  this is like I said
[04:59:24.360 --> 04:59:26.360]  the engine of our soil so this is the
[04:59:26.360 --> 04:59:28.360]  layer that we need to
[04:59:28.360 --> 04:59:30.360]  amend with our
[04:59:30.360 --> 04:59:32.360]  inputs so
[04:59:32.360 --> 04:59:34.360]  what I
[04:59:34.360 --> 04:59:36.360]  like to do is
[04:59:36.360 --> 04:59:38.360]  before I get into that I got to back up
[04:59:38.360 --> 04:59:40.360]  to IMO because like I said indigenous
[04:59:40.360 --> 04:59:42.360]  microorganisms is the engine for
[04:59:42.360 --> 04:59:44.360]  any living
[04:59:44.360 --> 04:59:46.360]  indoor soil or any
[04:59:46.360 --> 04:59:48.360]  soil microorganisms
[04:59:50.360 --> 04:59:52.360]  so basically as a natural
[04:59:52.360 --> 04:59:54.360]  farmer the way you collect your
[04:59:54.360 --> 04:59:56.360]  IMO or indigenous microorganisms
[04:59:56.360 --> 04:59:58.360]  is pretty
[04:59:58.360 --> 05:00:00.360]  simple you take a rice collection
[05:00:00.360 --> 05:00:02.360]  you take rice which is
[05:00:02.360 --> 05:00:04.360]  partially cooked still a
[05:00:04.360 --> 05:00:06.360]  little bit firm not
[05:00:06.360 --> 05:00:08.360]  mushy you want to put that into
[05:00:08.360 --> 05:00:10.360]  a box or wicker
[05:00:10.360 --> 05:00:12.360]  basket or
[05:00:12.360 --> 05:00:14.360]  even just straight on the forest floor but
[05:00:14.360 --> 05:00:16.360]  what you want to do is you want to find a forest
[05:00:16.360 --> 05:00:18.360]  that's got big strong trees
[05:00:18.360 --> 05:00:20.360]  and
[05:00:20.360 --> 05:00:22.360]  basically that forest
[05:00:22.360 --> 05:00:24.360]  has never had to be
[05:00:24.360 --> 05:00:26.360]  fertilized no one ever had to put
[05:00:26.360 --> 05:00:28.360]  fertilizer out there the way
[05:00:28.360 --> 05:00:30.360]  all those trees and the way all that growth
[05:00:30.360 --> 05:00:32.360]  is able to grow is by the
[05:00:32.360 --> 05:00:34.360]  relationships between the plant roots and the
[05:00:34.360 --> 05:00:36.360]  microorganisms so what we
[05:00:36.360 --> 05:00:38.360]  like to do with natural farming is come in
[05:00:38.360 --> 05:00:40.360]  and harvest those microorganisms
[05:00:40.360 --> 05:00:42.360]  and now use them into our gardens
[05:00:42.360 --> 05:00:44.360]  and the best way to do that like I
[05:00:44.360 --> 05:00:46.360]  said is take a simple rice collection
[05:00:46.360 --> 05:00:48.360]  that will be IMO1
[05:00:48.360 --> 05:00:50.360]  you set that on a forest floor
[05:00:50.360 --> 05:00:52.360]  for about 3-5 days
[05:00:52.360 --> 05:00:54.360]  and when you come back it will be
[05:00:54.360 --> 05:00:56.360]  inoculated with the forest
[05:00:56.360 --> 05:00:58.360]  microbiology
[05:00:58.360 --> 05:01:00.360]  you can then take that
[05:01:00.360 --> 05:01:02.360]  combine that with the equal weight sugar
[05:01:02.360 --> 05:01:04.360]  and now that will put those microbes in a
[05:01:04.360 --> 05:01:06.360]  dormant state that will be called
[05:01:06.360 --> 05:01:08.360]  IMO2
[05:01:08.360 --> 05:01:10.360]  and the IMO2 is good
[05:01:10.360 --> 05:01:12.360]  but if you really
[05:01:12.360 --> 05:01:14.360]  want to get the full working
[05:01:14.360 --> 05:01:16.360]  power of the microorganisms
[05:01:16.360 --> 05:01:18.360]  in natural farming then you need to take it to
[05:01:18.360 --> 05:01:20.360]  the next step and make IMO3
[05:01:20.360 --> 05:01:22.360]  and basically what you're doing
[05:01:22.360 --> 05:01:24.360]  in each of these steps is you're taking
[05:01:24.360 --> 05:01:26.360]  the biology
[05:01:26.360 --> 05:01:28.360]  and you're multiplying it and inoculating
[05:01:28.360 --> 05:01:30.360]  things along the way so
[05:01:30.360 --> 05:01:32.360]  IMO2 is that rice and
[05:01:32.360 --> 05:01:34.360]  that sugar mix so say if that's
[05:01:34.360 --> 05:01:36.360]  you know X that's
[05:01:36.360 --> 05:01:38.360]  1X microbes well if you go to
[05:01:38.360 --> 05:01:40.360]  IMO3 now that's
[05:01:40.360 --> 05:01:42.360]  like 50X so you're
[05:01:42.360 --> 05:01:44.360]  really multiplying that so
[05:01:44.360 --> 05:01:46.360]  the way you make your
[05:01:46.360 --> 05:01:48.360]  IMO3 is basically
[05:01:48.360 --> 05:01:50.360]  I use 3 parts I use
[05:01:50.360 --> 05:01:52.360]  like cracked grains
[05:01:52.360 --> 05:01:54.360]  partially grown oats and I use
[05:01:54.360 --> 05:01:56.360]  some well aged wood chips
[05:01:56.360 --> 05:01:58.360]  and basically
[05:01:58.360 --> 05:02:00.360]  you combine those
[05:02:00.360 --> 05:02:02.360]  and then water them in with
[05:02:02.360 --> 05:02:04.360]  natural farming inputs and
[05:02:04.360 --> 05:02:06.360]  IMO that we collected
[05:02:06.360 --> 05:02:08.360]  so it's a
[05:02:08.360 --> 05:02:10.360]  little bit natural farming
[05:02:10.360 --> 05:02:12.360]  is the work is on the up
[05:02:12.360 --> 05:02:14.360]  front once it's all set up
[05:02:14.360 --> 05:02:16.360]  it's easy to maintain
[05:02:16.360 --> 05:02:18.360]  but it's the making
[05:02:18.360 --> 05:02:20.360]  these recipes and things that takes a little
[05:02:20.360 --> 05:02:22.360]  time so
[05:02:22.360 --> 05:02:24.360]  basically when you make your IMO
[05:02:24.360 --> 05:02:26.360]  3 those are those
[05:02:26.360 --> 05:02:28.360]  3 dry ingredients I
[05:02:28.360 --> 05:02:30.360]  mentioned and then you want to water them in
[05:02:30.360 --> 05:02:32.360]  with natural farming inputs
[05:02:32.360 --> 05:02:34.360]  a really easy way
[05:02:34.360 --> 05:02:36.360]  to make natural farming inputs is to look
[05:02:36.360 --> 05:02:38.360]  around your environment like
[05:02:38.360 --> 05:02:40.360]  for instance in the springtime
[05:02:40.360 --> 05:02:42.360]  it's dead
[05:02:42.360 --> 05:02:44.360]  dead nettle season we always have like lots
[05:02:44.360 --> 05:02:46.360]  of dead nettle like if you ever look
[05:02:46.360 --> 05:02:48.360]  you can look it up and see where it is but you guys
[05:02:48.360 --> 05:02:50.360]  have all seen it and it grows in all the lawns
[05:02:50.360 --> 05:02:52.360]  but it only grows for
[05:02:52.360 --> 05:02:54.360]  a few months in the springtime
[05:02:54.360 --> 05:02:56.360]  and then it dies off
[05:02:56.360 --> 05:02:58.360]  so if you can go out and harvest this dead nettle
[05:02:58.360 --> 05:03:00.360]  in the springtime
[05:03:00.360 --> 05:03:02.360]  combine that with equal weight sugar
[05:03:02.360 --> 05:03:04.360]  that's a simple
[05:03:04.360 --> 05:03:06.360]  simple alcohol fermentation
[05:03:06.360 --> 05:03:08.360]  to get you a
[05:03:08.360 --> 05:03:10.360]  nettle FPJ
[05:03:10.360 --> 05:03:12.360]  fermented fruit juice
[05:03:12.360 --> 05:03:14.360]  I'm sorry FPJ fermented
[05:03:14.360 --> 05:03:16.360]  plant juice
[05:03:16.360 --> 05:03:18.360]  and basically what
[05:03:18.360 --> 05:03:20.360]  these plant juices are
[05:03:20.360 --> 05:03:22.360]  they're not necessarily
[05:03:22.360 --> 05:03:24.360]  fertilizer but they are
[05:03:24.360 --> 05:03:26.360]  loaded with plant
[05:03:26.360 --> 05:03:28.360]  all the enzymes, plant growth
[05:03:28.360 --> 05:03:30.360]  hormones that were in that plant
[05:03:30.360 --> 05:03:32.360]  and now you've extracted them
[05:03:32.360 --> 05:03:34.360]  via osmosis into the sugar
[05:03:34.360 --> 05:03:36.360]  so that's one input
[05:03:36.360 --> 05:03:38.360]  once you
[05:03:38.360 --> 05:03:40.360]  extract this
[05:03:40.360 --> 05:03:42.360]  FPJ then now you
[05:03:42.360 --> 05:03:44.360]  can turn right around and use those same solids
[05:03:44.360 --> 05:03:46.360]  and make a vinegar
[05:03:46.360 --> 05:03:48.360]  and to make a vinegar is basically you use
[05:03:48.360 --> 05:03:50.360]  about a quarter container of the
[05:03:50.360 --> 05:03:52.360]  leftover FPJ solids
[05:03:52.360 --> 05:03:54.360]  fill the rest with water
[05:03:54.360 --> 05:03:56.360]  and then add a splash of
[05:03:56.360 --> 05:03:58.360]  raw vinegar
[05:03:58.360 --> 05:04:00.360]  if you don't have raw vinegar it will still
[05:04:00.360 --> 05:04:02.360]  it will still vinegar
[05:04:02.360 --> 05:04:04.360]  in time but the raw vinegar helps speed
[05:04:04.360 --> 05:04:06.360]  up the process
[05:04:06.360 --> 05:04:08.360]  one thing that vinegar is
[05:04:08.360 --> 05:04:10.360]  awesome for plants is it strengthens
[05:04:10.360 --> 05:04:12.360]  the stems
[05:04:12.360 --> 05:04:14.360]  it gives the leaves
[05:04:14.360 --> 05:04:16.360]  their waxy coating is much thicker
[05:04:16.360 --> 05:04:18.360]  so when you dilute
[05:04:18.360 --> 05:04:20.360]  vinegar at a proper
[05:04:20.360 --> 05:04:22.360]  ratio for natural farming which is
[05:04:22.360 --> 05:04:24.360]  about 1 to 1000
[05:04:24.360 --> 05:04:26.360]  that you get
[05:04:26.360 --> 05:04:28.360]  those benefits plus you get whatever
[05:04:28.360 --> 05:04:30.360]  leftover residual nutrients
[05:04:30.360 --> 05:04:32.360]  and minerals were
[05:04:32.360 --> 05:04:34.360]  in the initial FPJ
[05:04:34.360 --> 05:04:36.360]  that you harvested
[05:04:36.360 --> 05:04:38.360]  so that's two
[05:04:38.360 --> 05:04:40.360]  really simple natural farming
[05:04:40.360 --> 05:04:42.360]  inputs and then
[05:04:42.360 --> 05:04:44.360]  along with
[05:04:44.360 --> 05:04:46.360]  natural farming there's also
[05:04:46.360 --> 05:04:48.360]  JADAM I know a lot of you all have heard of that
[05:04:48.360 --> 05:04:50.360]  too and JADAM
[05:04:50.360 --> 05:04:52.360]  is like a very low cost
[05:04:52.360 --> 05:04:54.360]  low cost
[05:04:54.360 --> 05:04:56.360]  form of natural farming
[05:04:56.360 --> 05:04:58.360]  basically if I was going to make
[05:04:58.360 --> 05:05:00.360]  a dead metal
[05:05:00.360 --> 05:05:02.360]  JLF which is JADAM
[05:05:02.360 --> 05:05:04.360]  liquid fertilizer I take that
[05:05:04.360 --> 05:05:06.360]  same plant material or any plant
[05:05:06.360 --> 05:05:08.360]  material fill it half way
[05:05:08.360 --> 05:05:10.360]  in a container fill the
[05:05:10.360 --> 05:05:12.360]  rest with water and then toss in some
[05:05:12.360 --> 05:05:14.360]  forest soil or
[05:05:14.360 --> 05:05:16.360]  like leaf mold or
[05:05:16.360 --> 05:05:18.360]  anything that you have IMO3
[05:05:18.360 --> 05:05:20.360]  toss that in there and what happens is
[05:05:20.360 --> 05:05:22.360]  the microbes the water
[05:05:22.360 --> 05:05:24.360]  break down the plants into a
[05:05:24.360 --> 05:05:26.360]  form that's readily available to be used
[05:05:26.360 --> 05:05:28.360]  to feed other plants
[05:05:28.360 --> 05:05:30.360]  so JLF's are very
[05:05:30.360 --> 05:05:32.360]  important I think
[05:05:32.360 --> 05:05:34.360]  if you're a natural farmer you should have several
[05:05:34.360 --> 05:05:36.360]  JLF's if you grow whatever
[05:05:36.360 --> 05:05:38.360]  plant you grow you should have a
[05:05:38.360 --> 05:05:40.360]  barrel of that plant for
[05:05:40.360 --> 05:05:42.360]  JLF you can grow tomatoes
[05:05:42.360 --> 05:05:44.360]  whatever it may be
[05:05:44.360 --> 05:05:46.360]  and make several of them
[05:05:46.360 --> 05:05:48.360]  make them out of fruit
[05:05:48.360 --> 05:05:50.360]  make them out of leafy plants
[05:05:50.360 --> 05:05:52.360]  just make
[05:05:52.360 --> 05:05:54.360]  make more
[05:05:54.360 --> 05:05:56.360]  JLF's because what that does is
[05:05:56.360 --> 05:05:58.360]  it's going to increase your diversity in your
[05:05:58.360 --> 05:06:00.360]  soil you know what I mean all these JLF's
[05:06:00.360 --> 05:06:02.360]  are very high in microbes
[05:06:02.360 --> 05:06:04.360]  and then they're very high in nutrients so you have
[05:06:04.360 --> 05:06:06.360]  to be careful
[05:06:06.360 --> 05:06:08.360]  to dilute them properly
[05:06:08.360 --> 05:06:10.360]  when you use them
[05:06:10.360 --> 05:06:12.360]  so with all
[05:06:12.360 --> 05:06:14.360]  that said that gives us
[05:06:14.360 --> 05:06:16.360]  now we have three inputs we have our FPJ
[05:06:16.360 --> 05:06:18.360]  we have our vinegar
[05:06:18.360 --> 05:06:20.360]  and then we have our JLF
[05:06:20.360 --> 05:06:22.360]  just keeping it simple
[05:06:22.360 --> 05:06:24.360]  so now when we make our
[05:06:24.360 --> 05:06:26.360]  A horizon
[05:06:26.360 --> 05:06:28.360]  we have those inputs
[05:06:28.360 --> 05:06:30.360]  in order to water it
[05:06:30.360 --> 05:06:32.360]  so basically our ingredients
[05:06:32.360 --> 05:06:34.360]  for our
[05:06:34.360 --> 05:06:36.360]  A horizon
[05:06:36.360 --> 05:06:38.360]  I use
[05:06:38.360 --> 05:06:40.360]  let's see
[05:06:40.360 --> 05:06:42.360]  my I use
[05:06:42.360 --> 05:06:44.360]  an alfalfa and
[05:06:44.360 --> 05:06:46.360]  shredded leaves so basically I took
[05:06:46.360 --> 05:06:48.360]  alfalfa that you can buy from a feed
[05:06:48.360 --> 05:06:50.360]  grain store
[05:06:50.360 --> 05:06:52.360]  if you can't if you have
[05:06:52.360 --> 05:06:54.360]  alfalfa growing even better I don't have it
[05:06:54.360 --> 05:06:56.360]  growing so you can take feed
[05:06:56.360 --> 05:06:58.360]  grade alfalfa
[05:06:58.360 --> 05:07:00.360]  combine that with
[05:07:00.360 --> 05:07:02.360]  shredded leaves that I harvested in the fall
[05:07:02.360 --> 05:07:04.360]  and I watered those
[05:07:04.360 --> 05:07:06.360]  with natural farming inputs including
[05:07:06.360 --> 05:07:08.360]  IMO and then I wrap
[05:07:08.360 --> 05:07:10.360]  that in tarp and just let it cook
[05:07:10.360 --> 05:07:12.360]  for about two months
[05:07:12.360 --> 05:07:14.360]  okay just don't bother
[05:07:14.360 --> 05:07:16.360]  now that's one
[05:07:16.360 --> 05:07:18.360]  component of it now I got rice hulls
[05:07:18.360 --> 05:07:20.360]  which is another
[05:07:20.360 --> 05:07:22.360]  part to my A horizon that I like
[05:07:22.360 --> 05:07:24.360]  to use
[05:07:24.360 --> 05:07:26.360]  garden soil
[05:07:26.360 --> 05:07:28.360]  and then I also use I like to amend
[05:07:28.360 --> 05:07:30.360]  the A horizon
[05:07:30.360 --> 05:07:32.360]  gypsum
[05:07:32.360 --> 05:07:34.360]  potassium sulfate, epsom salt
[05:07:34.360 --> 05:07:36.360]  I use the
[05:07:36.360 --> 05:07:38.360]  build a soil craft blend which is great
[05:07:40.360 --> 05:07:42.360]  I also make a
[05:07:42.360 --> 05:07:44.360]  azomite IMO 4
[05:07:44.360 --> 05:07:46.360]  an acorn IMO 3
[05:07:46.360 --> 05:07:48.360]  and river sand salt
[05:07:48.360 --> 05:07:50.360]  river, silt, sand and gravel
[05:07:50.360 --> 05:07:52.360]  all go to the A horizon
[05:07:52.360 --> 05:07:54.360]  so
[05:07:54.360 --> 05:07:56.360]  I gotta give you a visual
[05:07:56.360 --> 05:07:58.360]  because if you look at those horizons
[05:07:58.360 --> 05:08:00.360]  again and this is the bottom
[05:08:00.360 --> 05:08:02.360]  this is the E it doesn't
[05:08:02.360 --> 05:08:04.360]  stop there's not a sharp line
[05:08:04.360 --> 05:08:06.360]  this horizon and this horizon
[05:08:06.360 --> 05:08:08.360]  have a zone where they
[05:08:08.360 --> 05:08:10.360]  converge okay so
[05:08:10.360 --> 05:08:12.360]  each horizon
[05:08:12.360 --> 05:08:14.360]  also has what the other horizon above
[05:08:14.360 --> 05:08:16.360]  it has
[05:08:16.360 --> 05:08:18.360]  but
[05:08:18.360 --> 05:08:20.360]  um
[05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:26.470]  a little bit more about the
[05:08:26.470 --> 05:08:28.470]  acorn IMO 3
[05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:30.470]  one thing I like to do in
[05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:32.470]  the fall is um
[05:08:32.470 --> 05:08:34.470]  all year long like
[05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:36.470]  things are seasonal with natural farming
[05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:38.470]  like you know I make
[05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:40.470]  inputs I make things when
[05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:42.470]  they're available so in the fall
[05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:44.470]  acorn drop I go out and
[05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:46.470]  harvest acorns
[05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:48.470]  and I use those acorns to
[05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:50.470]  either an IMO
[05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:52.470]  IMO piles or I also do
[05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:54.470]  like a cold no turn
[05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:56.470]  compost in which I'll
[05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:58.470]  take the acorns
[05:08:58.470 --> 05:09:00.470]  and I'll actually do a process where I
[05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:02.470]  sprout them, I'll sprout
[05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:04.470]  about a half inch
[05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:06.470]  sprout coming out and I'll crack them
[05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:08.470]  and then I'll combine those
[05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:10.470]  with alfalfa again
[05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:12.470]  and I'll water that with natural
[05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:14.470]  farming inputs, stuff that in
[05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:16.470]  burlap sacks and then put it
[05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:18.470]  in cardboard boxes for like six
[05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:20.470]  months, just don't even touch it, don't even
[05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:22.470]  look at it, six months when you go back in
[05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:24.470]  there, you still got all
[05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:26.470]  the nutritional value that's in an acorn
[05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:28.470]  you know you got an oak tree right there
[05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:30.470]  inside that small package so you have
[05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:32.470]  all that and on top of that
[05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:34.470]  you also have all that fungi
[05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:36.470]  and different
[05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:38.470]  all the soil biology from when
[05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:40.470]  you watered in your IMO
[05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:42.470]  when you put it in there
[05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:44.470]  and it was bags wet all that is
[05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:46.470]  grown and pretty much that comes
[05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:48.470]  out looking like a nice white
[05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:50.470]  cake of acorns
[05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:52.470]  and fungi
[05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:54.470]  and bacteria, it's really good
[05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:56.470]  stuff and that's one of my components
[05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:58.470]  of my soil
[05:09:58.470 --> 05:10:00.470]  in the horizon
[05:10:00.470 --> 05:10:02.470]  let's jump
[05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:04.470]  on up to the over horizon now which is
[05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:06.470]  your top horizon
[05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:10.470]  I like to use, some of the things I do
[05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:12.470]  I put clay in my over horizon
[05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:14.470]  and this sounds a little, you might have
[05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:16.470]  to just kind of think through this with me
[05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:18.470]  but the reason I do that is
[05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:20.470]  because I want clay, I use
[05:10:20.470 --> 05:10:22.470]  three different clays, I use French
[05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:24.470]  Green clay, I use the Brassoul
[05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:26.470]  clay and I use Sea Clay
[05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:28.470]  and the reason I like these clays is
[05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:30.470]  because clays are loaded with
[05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:32.470]  micronutrients
[05:10:32.470 --> 05:10:34.470]  and what also happens
[05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:36.470]  clay is very good at holding moisture
[05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:38.470]  so in my over
[05:10:38.470 --> 05:10:40.470]  horizon when I have this clay mix
[05:10:40.470 --> 05:10:42.470]  with these acorns
[05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:44.470]  alfalfa
[05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:46.470]  along with some IMO
[05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:48.470]  I use a pre-feeding
[05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:50.470]  time cover crop
[05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:52.470]  and what happens is when I water
[05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:54.470]  the clay slowly trickles down
[05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:56.470]  through my horizons
[05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:58.470]  and basically what happens is
[05:10:58.470 --> 05:11:00.470]  this horizon, the top
[05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:02.470]  of the eating horizon will end up collecting
[05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:04.470]  all that clay, well
[05:11:04.470 --> 05:11:06.470]  over time
[05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:08.470]  plant roots will go down as well
[05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:10.470]  and this top of this eating horizon
[05:11:10.470 --> 05:11:12.470]  will be a very nutritionally rich area
[05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:14.470]  just because of the way
[05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:16.470]  everything leaches down
[05:11:16.470 --> 05:11:18.470]  now
[05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:20.470]  a bed like this is like
[05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:22.470]  a lifetime bed
[05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:24.470]  I mean years, like I have
[05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:26.470]  mine now that I use is
[05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:28.470]  about seven years old, similarly
[05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:30.470]  built and it just gets better
[05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:32.470]  over time as things break down
[05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:36.470]  one thing I didn't mention in my
[05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:38.470]  before where my
[05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:40.470]  eating horizon meets
[05:11:40.470 --> 05:11:42.470]  I actually harvested some
[05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:44.470]  ginkgo ramal wood
[05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:46.470]  ramal wood is the
[05:11:46.470 --> 05:11:48.470]  small tips of the wood, basically
[05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:50.470]  just the branches and the
[05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:52.470]  twigs and I
[05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:54.470]  actually layered that in right
[05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:56.470]  above my eat with the thought
[05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:58.470]  process of this being such a long term
[05:11:58.470 --> 05:12:00.470]  bed, ginkgo being
[05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:02.470]  such a kind of a light wood
[05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:04.470]  anyway, it doesn't take a long time to
[05:12:04.470 --> 05:12:06.470]  grow and with all the ramal
[05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:08.470]  wood in there
[05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:10.470]  adding all that
[05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:12.470]  growth hormone and all that
[05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:14.470]  I think that's going to be really
[05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:16.470]  it's going to bring a bed to life after
[05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:18.470]  about a couple of years
[05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:20.470]  it won't be immediately like
[05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:22.470]  this stuff takes time to break down
[05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:24.470]  and it gets better over time
[05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:28.470]  but the thing is
[05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:30.470]  it seems complex to set up
[05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:32.470]  it's not, but once it's going
[05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:34.470]  to be water only
[05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:36.470]  this will be water only for years
[05:12:36.470 --> 05:12:38.470]  I still will top dress
[05:12:38.470 --> 05:12:40.470]  I'll still water with
[05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:42.470]  natural farming inputs
[05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:44.470]  but as far as the soil
[05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:46.470]  being preloaded
[05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:48.470]  and having everything available to it
[05:12:48.470 --> 05:12:50.470]  a soil like this will
[05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:52.470]  have that
[05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:54.470]  on your over horizon
[05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:56.470]  that includes your
[05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:58.470]  plants that are growing in it as well
[05:12:58.470 --> 05:13:00.470]  not only the plants but all
[05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:02.470]  the soil biology that's in that
[05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:04.470]  layer as well
[05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:06.470]  I like creeping time
[05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:08.470]  I've just been using
[05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:10.470]  it recently, but I grow it outdoors
[05:13:10.470 --> 05:13:12.470]  in my gardens
[05:13:12.470 --> 05:13:14.470]  and I just
[05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:16.470]  toss it everywhere, flower beds
[05:13:16.470 --> 05:13:18.470]  everywhere, just let it grow and that's one thing
[05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:20.470]  I thought, I noticed nothing ever
[05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:22.470]  eats it, like it's there
[05:13:22.470 --> 05:13:24.470]  growing, it's healthy, but there's never
[05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:26.470]  any pest eating it
[05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:28.470]  and I love how it stays low
[05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:30.470]  and it really gives the soil
[05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:32.470]  biology a nice home
[05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:34.470]  in there, some of your cover crops
[05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:36.470]  grow tall and then there's a big
[05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:38.470]  space between the surface
[05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:40.470]  of the soil and the crop
[05:13:40.470 --> 05:13:42.470]  where these creeping time are kind of
[05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:44.470]  curly, they're down low
[05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:48.470]  and the soil biology
[05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:50.470]  seems to really like it
[05:14:01.880 --> 05:14:03.880]  a lot of people say
[05:14:03.880 --> 05:14:05.880]  what is natural farming?
[05:14:05.880 --> 05:14:07.880]  what's a natural farmer?
[05:14:07.880 --> 05:14:09.880]  I feel like anybody that's mindful
[05:14:09.880 --> 05:14:11.880]  of
[05:14:11.880 --> 05:14:13.880]  you're mindful of what's going
[05:14:13.880 --> 05:14:15.880]  into your soil, you're mindful of how you're
[05:14:15.880 --> 05:14:17.880]  growing your plants, you're mindful that
[05:14:17.880 --> 05:14:19.880]  you're not using chemicals
[05:14:19.880 --> 05:14:21.880]  you're not using
[05:14:21.880 --> 05:14:23.880]  fertilizers, you're trying to
[05:14:23.880 --> 05:14:25.880]  wild harvest things as much as you can
[05:14:25.880 --> 05:14:27.880]  and you're focusing on
[05:14:27.880 --> 05:14:29.880]  indigenous microorganisms
[05:14:29.880 --> 05:14:31.880]  to me that's natural farming
[05:14:31.880 --> 05:14:33.880]  now
[05:14:33.880 --> 05:14:35.880]  a living soil does not have to be as complex
[05:14:35.880 --> 05:14:37.880]  as a horizontal soil
[05:14:37.880 --> 05:14:39.880]  don't get me wrong, you can
[05:14:39.880 --> 05:14:41.880]  definitely take a good quality
[05:14:41.880 --> 05:14:43.880]  soil, start adding IMO
[05:14:43.880 --> 05:14:45.880]  and the other
[05:14:45.880 --> 05:14:47.880]  things that I mentioned, and that soil will be
[05:14:47.880 --> 05:14:49.880]  great, it will be awesome soil
[05:14:49.880 --> 05:14:51.880]  the thing I like about the
[05:14:51.880 --> 05:14:53.880]  building kind of horizontal
[05:14:53.880 --> 05:14:55.880]  and this method is
[05:14:55.880 --> 05:14:57.880]  like a lot of people say, I don't like to have to
[05:14:57.880 --> 05:14:59.880]  do a lot of things in my garden
[05:14:59.880 --> 05:15:01.880]  I like for it to kind of do its own
[05:15:01.880 --> 05:15:03.880]  thing and
[05:15:03.880 --> 05:15:05.880]  have water and tend to it but
[05:15:05.880 --> 05:15:07.880]  if you guys
[05:15:07.880 --> 05:15:09.880]  back in the day you had all these bottles
[05:15:09.880 --> 05:15:11.880]  and you were really a
[05:15:11.880 --> 05:15:13.880]  slave to that
[05:15:13.880 --> 05:15:15.880]  you couldn't take a vacation
[05:15:15.880 --> 05:15:17.880]  you can, but
[05:15:17.880 --> 05:15:19.880]  you'd have to set up things
[05:15:19.880 --> 05:15:21.880]  like with a nice living soil
[05:15:21.880 --> 05:15:23.880]  you may have to water
[05:15:23.880 --> 05:15:25.880]  once a week, you know what I mean?
[05:15:25.880 --> 05:15:27.880]  when you get it well established
[05:15:27.880 --> 05:15:29.880]  they hold so much water
[05:15:29.880 --> 05:15:31.880]  so you know
[05:15:31.880 --> 05:15:33.880]  you're not like captive by your
[05:15:33.880 --> 05:15:35.880]  garden, which is one of the big things
[05:15:35.880 --> 05:15:37.880]  about it that I like
[05:15:37.880 --> 05:15:39.880]  and just
[05:15:39.880 --> 05:15:41.880]  overall the ease of it
[05:15:41.880 --> 05:15:43.880]  if you're not
[05:15:43.880 --> 05:15:45.880]  having to move or anything like that
[05:15:45.880 --> 05:15:47.880]  build one of these
[05:15:47.880 --> 05:15:49.880]  and just leave it and don't
[05:15:49.880 --> 05:15:51.880]  bother with it
[05:15:51.880 --> 05:15:53.880]  I think it's well worth the time spent
[05:15:57.880 --> 05:16:06.720]  yeah and then
[05:16:06.720 --> 05:16:08.720]  another thing
[05:16:08.720 --> 05:16:10.720]  like wild harvesting, like always
[05:16:10.720 --> 05:16:12.720]  look for what's available
[05:16:12.720 --> 05:16:14.720]  to you
[05:16:14.720 --> 05:16:16.720]  like
[05:16:16.720 --> 05:16:18.720]  local persimmons
[05:16:18.720 --> 05:16:20.720]  like every fall I know I'm going to harvest
[05:16:20.720 --> 05:16:22.720]  my neighbor's persimmon and I'm going to make
[05:16:22.720 --> 05:16:24.720]  vinegar out of that and use it on my garden
[05:16:24.720 --> 05:16:26.720]  and I'm going to drink it myself too
[05:16:26.720 --> 05:16:28.720]  harvesting
[05:16:28.720 --> 05:16:30.720]  your microorganisms is big
[05:16:30.720 --> 05:16:32.720]  taking it a step and going to
[05:16:32.720 --> 05:16:34.720]  IMO 3
[05:16:34.720 --> 05:16:36.720]  I think you can't beat that
[05:16:36.720 --> 05:16:38.720]  for the amount
[05:16:38.720 --> 05:16:40.720]  of biology getting into your soil
[05:16:40.720 --> 05:16:42.720]  and
[05:16:42.720 --> 05:16:44.720]  the Dom liquid fertilizers are very
[05:16:44.720 --> 05:16:46.720]  awesome, you know, like I said
[05:16:46.720 --> 05:16:48.720]  to tailor them to kind of fit
[05:16:48.720 --> 05:16:50.720]  however you grow or how you're
[05:16:50.720 --> 05:16:52.720]  growing, the plants you have
[05:16:52.720 --> 05:16:54.720]  available to you
[05:16:54.720 --> 05:16:56.720]  all those things I think are very key
[05:16:56.720 --> 05:16:58.720]  to giving you a
[05:16:58.720 --> 05:17:00.720]  good quality soil
[05:17:00.720 --> 05:17:02.720]  which is basically, as we all know
[05:17:02.720 --> 05:17:04.720]  the root of our plant
[05:17:04.720 --> 05:17:06.720]  I mean, you're not going to get a quality plant
[05:17:06.720 --> 05:17:08.720]  if you don't start with quality soil
[05:17:08.720 --> 05:17:10.720]  you know, so
[05:17:10.720 --> 05:17:12.720]  living soil to me is
[05:17:12.720 --> 05:17:14.720]  probably the best, focusing on
[05:17:14.720 --> 05:17:16.720]  soil food web
[05:17:16.720 --> 05:17:18.720]  to me your whole horizon
[05:17:18.720 --> 05:17:20.720]  should contain all of
[05:17:20.720 --> 05:17:22.720]  pretty much a member of each one of your
[05:17:22.720 --> 05:17:24.720]  soil food web colonies
[05:17:24.720 --> 05:17:26.720]  meaning like earthworms, arthropods
[05:17:26.720 --> 05:17:28.720]  springtails
[05:17:28.720 --> 05:17:30.720]  you know
[05:17:30.720 --> 05:17:32.720]  isopods, on down
[05:17:32.720 --> 05:17:34.720]  to protozoa, nematodes
[05:17:34.720 --> 05:17:36.720]  fungi, bacteria
[05:17:36.720 --> 05:17:38.720]  all that is part of what makes up
[05:17:38.720 --> 05:17:40.720]  that horizon where the plants
[05:17:40.720 --> 05:17:42.720]  grow, you know what I mean
[05:17:42.720 --> 05:17:44.720]  in nature
[05:17:44.720 --> 05:17:46.720]  plants grow, they drop their leaves
[05:17:46.720 --> 05:17:48.720]  those are cycled back down
[05:17:48.720 --> 05:17:50.720]  into the soil, plant reuses
[05:17:50.720 --> 05:17:52.720]  them and that process
[05:17:52.720 --> 05:17:54.720]  continues and
[05:17:54.720 --> 05:17:56.720]  there's no reason you can't have that same process
[05:17:56.720 --> 05:17:58.720]  indoors, you know what I mean
[05:17:58.720 --> 05:18:00.720]  and with a good living soil it's very
[05:18:00.720 --> 05:18:02.720]  possible
[05:18:02.720 --> 05:18:04.720]  so I guess at this point
[05:18:04.720 --> 05:18:06.720]  let's just take some questions if anybody has
[05:18:06.720 --> 05:18:08.720]  some and then I'll just crank back up
[05:18:08.720 --> 05:18:10.720]  and we'll sum it up
[05:18:10.720 --> 05:18:12.720]  real quick I wanted to talk about
[05:18:12.720 --> 05:18:14.720]  the show that we're going to do
[05:18:14.720 --> 05:18:16.720]  as well because I want you to kind of give
[05:18:16.720 --> 05:18:18.720]  your perspective and stuff
[05:18:18.720 --> 05:18:20.720]  people kind of know if they are watching on Thursdays
[05:18:20.720 --> 05:18:22.720]  they kind of know my personality and all that
[05:18:22.720 --> 05:18:24.720]  stuff but there's a reason why you and I are
[05:18:24.720 --> 05:18:26.720]  doing this so if you can kind of
[05:18:26.720 --> 05:18:28.720]  talk about that and we'll get into it
[05:18:28.720 --> 05:18:30.720]  as far as the show I'm really excited
[05:18:30.720 --> 05:18:32.720]  about that, I think it'll be
[05:18:32.720 --> 05:18:34.720]  you know Brian and I
[05:18:34.720 --> 05:18:36.720]  we're on the same page
[05:18:36.720 --> 05:18:38.720]  like I'm sure you all can see
[05:18:38.720 --> 05:18:40.720]  I'm not a young spring chicken, I'm an older
[05:18:40.720 --> 05:18:42.720]  guy and with that
[05:18:42.720 --> 05:18:44.720]  age you know you just
[05:18:44.720 --> 05:18:46.720]  learn that respect is
[05:18:46.720 --> 05:18:48.720]  a huge thing in everything
[05:18:48.720 --> 05:18:50.720]  you do
[05:18:50.720 --> 05:18:52.720]  I like the way
[05:18:52.720 --> 05:18:54.720]  I think our show is going to be great as far as
[05:18:54.720 --> 05:18:56.720]  we're going to hit like all
[05:18:56.720 --> 05:18:58.720]  age groups I think everyone is going to be able to
[05:18:58.720 --> 05:19:00.720]  benefit from our show
[05:19:00.720 --> 05:19:02.720]  what I really don't want to see is
[05:19:02.720 --> 05:19:04.720]  I appreciate
[05:19:04.720 --> 05:19:06.720]  I should have did this when I started but I appreciate all
[05:19:06.720 --> 05:19:08.720]  the speakers that we have here for me
[05:19:08.720 --> 05:19:10.720]  this is not easy
[05:19:10.720 --> 05:19:12.720]  y'all, I mean you got people that are coming up here
[05:19:12.720 --> 05:19:14.720]  just doing this stuff trying to share
[05:19:14.720 --> 05:19:16.720]  something to help you guys
[05:19:16.720 --> 05:19:18.720]  and I actually you know
[05:19:18.720 --> 05:19:20.720]  called my wife here a little bit ago and
[05:19:20.720 --> 05:19:22.720]  told me that some of the comments on some of the
[05:19:22.720 --> 05:19:24.720]  other speakers were pretty you know disrespectful
[05:19:24.720 --> 05:19:26.720]  you know and
[05:19:26.720 --> 05:19:28.720]  to me you know
[05:19:28.720 --> 05:19:30.720]  nobody has to be here
[05:19:30.720 --> 05:19:32.720]  you know what I mean if you love what we're
[05:19:32.720 --> 05:19:34.720]  kicking stay here and run with us
[05:19:34.720 --> 05:19:36.720]  you know what I mean but if you don't
[05:19:36.720 --> 05:19:38.720]  if I don't like something or what somebody's doing
[05:19:38.720 --> 05:19:40.720]  I got plenty of things I can do
[05:19:40.720 --> 05:19:42.720]  than to sit there and find
[05:19:42.720 --> 05:19:44.720]  something wrong with what they're doing
[05:19:44.720 --> 05:19:46.720]  the one thing about
[05:19:46.720 --> 05:19:48.720]  us you know about our
[05:19:48.720 --> 05:19:50.720]  plant is that
[05:19:50.720 --> 05:19:52.720]  there's a million ways to grow it
[05:19:52.720 --> 05:19:54.720]  you know and we should all
[05:19:54.720 --> 05:19:56.720]  be kind of mindful
[05:19:56.720 --> 05:19:58.720]  and look at each other as members
[05:19:58.720 --> 05:20:00.720]  of our own community whether or not
[05:20:00.720 --> 05:20:02.720]  he does it this way or he does it that way
[05:20:02.720 --> 05:20:04.720]  we're still in the same community
[05:20:04.720 --> 05:20:06.720]  so at the very minimum we should at least
[05:20:06.720 --> 05:20:08.720]  respect each other for having the
[05:20:08.720 --> 05:20:10.720]  same love for the same plant you know what I mean
[05:20:10.720 --> 05:20:12.720]  so that's kind of
[05:20:12.720 --> 05:20:14.720]  I think for the show I think it's going to be great
[05:20:14.720 --> 05:20:16.720]  I think we're going to bring
[05:20:16.720 --> 05:20:18.720]  try to bring a lot more
[05:20:18.720 --> 05:20:20.720]  just new
[05:20:20.720 --> 05:20:22.720]  faces a lot of people that
[05:20:22.720 --> 05:20:24.720]  haven't had platforms and
[05:20:24.720 --> 05:20:26.720]  just because like a guy doesn't
[05:20:26.720 --> 05:20:28.720]  have any followers that doesn't
[05:20:28.720 --> 05:20:30.720]  mean anything about that person's
[05:20:30.720 --> 05:20:32.720]  knowledge so we're just going to be
[05:20:32.720 --> 05:20:34.720]  looking for people that are like right
[05:20:34.720 --> 05:20:36.720]  like people that can add to the community
[05:20:36.720 --> 05:20:38.720]  you know
[05:20:38.720 --> 05:20:40.720]  be a benefit
[05:20:40.720 --> 05:20:42.720]  to the community positive
[05:20:42.720 --> 05:20:44.720]  minded people helpful people
[05:20:44.720 --> 05:20:46.720]  we should
[05:20:46.720 --> 05:20:48.720]  all be helping each other you know what I mean
[05:20:48.720 --> 05:20:50.720]  so we learn something teach that
[05:20:50.720 --> 05:20:52.720]  because when you teach it you're going to also
[05:20:52.720 --> 05:20:54.720]  learn it more you know what I mean so
[05:20:54.720 --> 05:20:56.720]  I feel like that's kind of what our show
[05:20:56.720 --> 05:20:58.720]  is going to be on
[05:20:58.720 --> 05:21:00.720]  you know it'll be a little bit different
[05:21:00.720 --> 05:21:02.720]  than this you know
[05:21:02.720 --> 05:21:04.720]  we'll be able to loosen up we'll have a good time
[05:21:04.720 --> 05:21:06.720]  with it you know right now I'm kind of like
[05:21:06.720 --> 05:21:08.720]  you know I'm the speaker
[05:21:08.720 --> 05:21:10.720]  here so you want to make sure everything's perfect
[05:21:10.720 --> 05:21:12.720]  but yeah the show is going to be really
[05:21:12.720 --> 05:21:14.720]  good you guys will like it man
[05:21:14.720 --> 05:21:16.720]  we'll show a lot more of our personalities and stuff
[05:21:16.720 --> 05:21:18.720]  well and also I want to share more of our
[05:21:18.720 --> 05:21:20.720]  backgrounds you know like we're
[05:21:20.720 --> 05:21:22.720]  I like to for the
[05:21:22.720 --> 05:21:24.720]  lack of a better term of course
[05:21:24.720 --> 05:21:26.720]  we wanted those were the cowboy days
[05:21:26.720 --> 05:21:28.720]  those were stuff when we want to share with you what it
[05:21:28.720 --> 05:21:30.720]  took to you know I guess I'm
[05:21:30.720 --> 05:21:32.720]  sharing some stuff today but like drawing
[05:21:32.720 --> 05:21:34.720]  something from Colorado to Georgia
[05:21:34.720 --> 05:21:36.720]  we would really break that down and think
[05:21:36.720 --> 05:21:38.720]  things through you know I would personally
[05:21:38.720 --> 05:21:40.720]  invent a priest I would personally
[05:21:40.720 --> 05:21:42.720]  dress up as a Mormon I
[05:21:42.720 --> 05:21:44.720]  bought stuff on eBay I bought
[05:21:44.720 --> 05:21:46.720]  I had the plaque with my name on it
[05:21:46.720 --> 05:21:48.720]  there were other times where I would dress up for
[05:21:48.720 --> 05:21:50.720]  an interview or something like that and I would actually
[05:21:50.720 --> 05:21:52.720]  be driving the suits in the car
[05:21:52.720 --> 05:21:54.720]  that has everything a loaded car
[05:21:54.720 --> 05:21:56.720]  but I had my resume right there
[05:21:56.720 --> 05:21:58.720]  because I don't feel like enough people
[05:21:58.720 --> 05:22:00.720]  are on game that
[05:22:00.720 --> 05:22:02.720]  a lot of us were lucky enough to learn
[05:22:02.720 --> 05:22:04.720]  I grew up in Atlanta and I was
[05:22:04.720 --> 05:22:06.720]  you know for where I was
[05:22:06.720 --> 05:22:08.720]  I learned street stuff a lot
[05:22:08.720 --> 05:22:10.720]  sooner a lot quicker and I felt like I
[05:22:10.720 --> 05:22:12.720]  understood that more than the
[05:22:12.720 --> 05:22:14.720]  school work stuff that I probably should have been
[05:22:14.720 --> 05:22:16.720]  paying attention to so part of that
[05:22:16.720 --> 05:22:18.720]  stuff is what we want to share with you guys so
[05:22:18.720 --> 05:22:20.720]  that you understand that the
[05:22:20.720 --> 05:22:22.720]  disrespect that some people just show
[05:22:22.720 --> 05:22:24.720]  out of the gate I assure you
[05:22:24.720 --> 05:22:26.720]  back in the day that would have been dealt with
[05:22:26.720 --> 05:22:28.720]  but now everybody does
[05:22:28.720 --> 05:22:30.720]  Instagram and keyboard warriors
[05:22:30.720 --> 05:22:32.720]  and stuff like that so people can't
[05:22:32.720 --> 05:22:34.720]  kind of check each other anymore so that's something
[05:22:34.720 --> 05:22:36.720]  else that we want to kind of
[05:22:36.720 --> 05:22:38.720]  highlight in is that you know
[05:22:38.720 --> 05:22:40.720]  if you went around running your mouth about people
[05:22:40.720 --> 05:22:42.720]  not only did nobody
[05:22:42.720 --> 05:22:44.720]  fuck with you so you basically went broke
[05:22:44.720 --> 05:22:46.720]  but everywhere you went people were
[05:22:46.720 --> 05:22:48.720]  chomping at the bit to punch you in the mouth
[05:22:48.720 --> 05:22:50.720]  and that is gone
[05:22:50.720 --> 05:22:52.720]  in this community and I feel like
[05:22:52.720 --> 05:22:54.720]  I'm definitely
[05:22:54.720 --> 05:22:56.720]  not promoting violence I hope you guys
[05:22:56.720 --> 05:22:58.720]  don't misunderstand that I think anybody
[05:22:58.720 --> 05:23:00.720]  who glorifies that has never seen that and that
[05:23:00.720 --> 05:23:02.720]  is something that near and dear to my heart
[05:23:02.720 --> 05:23:04.720]  that I hope nobody else really sees that
[05:23:04.720 --> 05:23:06.720]  real hood, real street life
[05:23:06.720 --> 05:23:08.720]  bullshit is just that bullshit
[05:23:08.720 --> 05:23:10.720]  fighting over nothing and so
[05:23:10.720 --> 05:23:12.720]  Marco kind of came from that
[05:23:12.720 --> 05:23:14.720]  I kind of came from that and that's something that we
[05:23:14.720 --> 05:23:16.720]  want to kind of I guess
[05:23:16.720 --> 05:23:18.720]  respect as the main thing so
[05:23:18.720 --> 05:23:20.720]  we definitely want to have that respect
[05:23:20.720 --> 05:23:22.720]  what I see a lot of is
[05:23:22.720 --> 05:23:24.720]  and it's funny
[05:23:24.720 --> 05:23:26.720]  because you'll see that guy on the sideline
[05:23:26.720 --> 05:23:28.720]  you call him a troll or whatever you call
[05:23:28.720 --> 05:23:30.720]  whatever we call him
[05:23:30.720 --> 05:23:32.720]  and it's kind of sad because what it is
[05:23:32.720 --> 05:23:34.720]  is right now
[05:23:34.720 --> 05:23:36.720]  I'm sitting here I'm trying to drop
[05:23:36.720 --> 05:23:38.720]  a little something on natural farming
[05:23:38.720 --> 05:23:40.720]  where there's going to be that troll
[05:23:40.720 --> 05:23:42.720]  instead of him getting into
[05:23:42.720 --> 05:23:44.720]  the game and jumping in here
[05:23:44.720 --> 05:23:46.720]  and saying what he can add to it
[05:23:46.720 --> 05:23:48.720]  they would rather
[05:23:48.720 --> 05:23:50.720]  focus on things that they can find wrong
[05:23:50.720 --> 05:23:52.720]  or something different so
[05:23:52.720 --> 05:23:54.720]  when you want to be like minded
[05:23:54.720 --> 05:23:56.720]  and
[05:23:56.720 --> 05:23:58.720]  focus on the same thing
[05:23:58.720 --> 05:24:00.720]  we don't really have time for that kind of stuff
[05:24:00.720 --> 05:24:02.720]  so don't
[05:24:02.720 --> 05:24:04.720]  tune in if that's what you're on like
[05:24:04.720 --> 05:24:06.720]  if you're not positive
[05:24:06.720 --> 05:24:08.720]  if you're not trying to pick a good vibe
[05:24:08.720 --> 05:24:10.720]  and share something
[05:24:10.720 --> 05:24:12.720]  we're not on it, we're not on that
[05:24:12.720 --> 05:24:14.720]  tough guy stuff
[05:24:14.720 --> 05:24:16.720]  or any of that
[05:24:16.720 --> 05:24:18.720]  we can be on it but
[05:24:18.720 --> 05:24:20.720]  it's not about that
[05:24:20.720 --> 05:24:22.720]  I'm here trying to share something
[05:24:22.720 --> 05:24:24.720]  I think
[05:24:24.720 --> 05:24:26.720]  the show will be successful
[05:24:26.720 --> 05:24:28.720]  for every reason
[05:24:28.720 --> 05:24:30.720]  and if you guys want to
[05:24:30.720 --> 05:24:32.720]  if somebody feels strong enough
[05:24:32.720 --> 05:24:34.720]  we'll bring them on the show
[05:24:34.720 --> 05:24:36.720]  come on, talk about it
[05:24:36.720 --> 05:24:38.720]  if you got something
[05:24:38.720 --> 05:24:40.720]  that may work better
[05:24:40.720 --> 05:24:42.720]  or you think we're doing something
[05:24:42.720 --> 05:24:44.720]  totally wrong here
[05:24:44.720 --> 05:24:46.720]  just jump in there
[05:24:46.720 --> 05:24:48.720]  so that's kind of that
[05:24:48.720 --> 05:24:50.720]  I'm with you on that Brian
[05:24:50.720 --> 05:24:52.720]  sharing that knowledge
[05:24:52.720 --> 05:24:54.720]  and then
[05:24:54.720 --> 05:24:56.720]  growing this community
[05:24:56.720 --> 05:24:58.720]  well I know for a lot of people
[05:24:58.720 --> 05:25:00.720]  out there that have been watching you on
[05:25:00.720 --> 05:25:02.720]  Instagram, I'm sure a lot of us
[05:25:02.720 --> 05:25:04.720]  it's the main platform that really
[05:25:04.720 --> 05:25:06.720]  is tribe and troop or at least sticks around
[05:25:06.720 --> 05:25:08.720]  so when we're
[05:25:08.720 --> 05:25:10.720]  learning more about you today I feel like
[05:25:10.720 --> 05:25:12.720]  this is kind of your little
[05:25:12.720 --> 05:25:14.720]  you grow cannabis
[05:25:14.720 --> 05:25:16.720]  and so what are some of the
[05:25:16.720 --> 05:25:18.720]  cultivars, what are some of the breeders that you personally
[05:25:18.720 --> 05:25:20.720]  behind the scenes, you and Ronnie
[05:25:20.720 --> 05:25:22.720]  you enjoy that you'd love to
[05:25:22.720 --> 05:25:24.720]  kind of debut to the world today
[05:25:24.720 --> 05:25:26.720]  well let's see
[05:25:26.720 --> 05:25:28.720]  we are 10 days legal
[05:25:28.720 --> 05:25:30.720]  in Virginia so shout out to that
[05:25:30.720 --> 05:25:32.720]  you know
[05:25:32.720 --> 05:25:34.720]  it's pretty awesome
[05:25:34.720 --> 05:25:36.720]  flying from a legal
[05:25:36.720 --> 05:25:38.720]  state to another legal state
[05:25:38.720 --> 05:25:40.720]  that's, I never did
[05:25:40.720 --> 05:25:42.720]  that for miles before
[05:25:42.720 --> 05:25:44.720]  that's right
[05:25:44.720 --> 05:25:46.720]  so I
[05:25:46.720 --> 05:25:48.720]  really feel like
[05:25:48.720 --> 05:25:50.720]  you know like as far as
[05:25:50.720 --> 05:25:52.720]  strains and things like that
[05:25:52.720 --> 05:25:54.720]  I mean we can get into that
[05:25:54.720 --> 05:25:56.720]  I don't
[05:25:56.720 --> 05:25:58.720]  want to really shout anybody out
[05:25:58.720 --> 05:26:00.720]  because I've even got some strains right now that people
[05:26:00.720 --> 05:26:02.720]  said don't say you've got my
[05:26:02.720 --> 05:26:04.720]  strains like straight up so
[05:26:04.720 --> 05:26:06.720]  you know I don't want to get into that kind of thing
[05:26:06.720 --> 05:26:08.720]  but as far as over
[05:26:08.720 --> 05:26:10.720]  the years I can just tell you that
[05:26:10.720 --> 05:26:12.720]  literally starting
[05:26:12.720 --> 05:26:14.720]  with three bottles
[05:26:14.720 --> 05:26:16.720]  working it up to five
[05:26:16.720 --> 05:26:18.720]  bottles going to organics
[05:26:18.720 --> 05:26:20.720]  aeroponics
[05:26:20.720 --> 05:26:22.720]  was in there at some point
[05:26:22.720 --> 05:26:24.720]  in the day
[05:26:24.720 --> 05:26:26.720]  everybody remembers those
[05:26:26.720 --> 05:26:28.720]  just every
[05:26:28.720 --> 05:26:30.720]  method that pretty much is out
[05:26:30.720 --> 05:26:32.720]  there you know I have tried
[05:26:32.720 --> 05:26:34.720]  and living soil is where
[05:26:34.720 --> 05:26:36.720]  it's at you know what I mean
[05:26:36.720 --> 05:26:38.720]  for the quality for the ease
[05:26:38.720 --> 05:26:40.720]  for the flavor
[05:26:40.720 --> 05:26:42.720]  I mean there's no beating that
[05:26:42.720 --> 05:26:44.720]  you know
[05:26:44.720 --> 05:26:46.720]  maybe you can go higher
[05:26:46.720 --> 05:26:48.720]  yields like we
[05:26:48.720 --> 05:26:50.720]  said earlier
[05:26:50.720 --> 05:26:52.720]  what's artificial stuff
[05:26:52.720 --> 05:26:54.720]  all you're doing is decreasing
[05:26:54.720 --> 05:26:56.720]  stretching your cell walls weakening
[05:26:56.720 --> 05:26:58.720]  your plants not a good
[05:26:58.720 --> 05:27:00.720]  thing so
[05:27:00.720 --> 05:27:02.720]  definitely my experience
[05:27:02.720 --> 05:27:04.720]  if you're bottoms
[05:27:04.720 --> 05:27:06.720]  you might as well just go ahead and switch
[05:27:06.720 --> 05:27:08.720]  out now because you're not doing it anyway
[05:27:08.720 --> 05:27:10.720]  I'm telling you it's going to happen
[05:27:10.720 --> 05:27:12.720]  just a progression
[05:27:12.720 --> 05:27:14.720]  of the whole thing
[05:27:14.720 --> 05:27:19.020]  I got
[05:27:19.020 --> 05:27:21.020]  two questions
[05:27:21.020 --> 05:27:23.020]  you were talking about
[05:27:23.020 --> 05:27:25.020]  horizon levels can you put like a
[05:27:25.020 --> 05:27:27.020]  percentage of how much
[05:27:27.020 --> 05:27:29.020]  natural harvesting
[05:27:29.020 --> 05:27:31.020]  you put into that
[05:27:31.020 --> 05:27:33.020]  like a long term
[05:27:33.020 --> 05:27:35.020]  and second question
[05:27:35.020 --> 05:27:37.020]  what would you say to somebody
[05:27:37.020 --> 05:27:39.020]  who's like intimidated by
[05:27:39.020 --> 05:27:41.020]  I guess the complexity
[05:27:41.020 --> 05:27:43.020]  of living soil all the
[05:27:43.020 --> 05:27:45.020]  microorganisms everything just kind
[05:27:45.020 --> 05:27:47.020]  of went over like what would you say
[05:27:47.020 --> 05:27:49.020]  to somebody who's that
[05:27:49.020 --> 05:27:51.020]  person yeah I get you man I get that
[05:27:51.020 --> 05:27:53.020]  question a lot
[05:27:53.020 --> 05:27:55.020]  and I really really try to make this
[05:27:55.020 --> 05:27:57.020]  stuff as simple as possible
[05:27:59.020 --> 05:28:01.020]  I have some on my Instagram
[05:28:01.020 --> 05:28:03.020]  Marco underscore is underscore
[05:28:03.020 --> 05:28:05.020]  grown and I have some nice
[05:28:05.020 --> 05:28:07.020]  tutorial type videos and then on
[05:28:07.020 --> 05:28:09.020]  the internet there's a lot of that out there too
[05:28:09.020 --> 05:28:11.020]  so you can find a lot of information if you
[05:28:11.020 --> 05:28:13.020]  start searching
[05:28:13.020 --> 05:28:15.020]  back to your first question though
[05:28:15.020 --> 05:28:17.020]  the amount of wild crafted that I would
[05:28:17.020 --> 05:28:19.020]  so this is a 4x4
[05:28:19.020 --> 05:28:21.020]  and I estimate
[05:28:21.020 --> 05:28:23.020]  150 gallons
[05:28:23.020 --> 05:28:25.020]  I have
[05:28:27.020 --> 05:28:29.020]  I have 40
[05:28:29.020 --> 05:28:31.020]  gallons of the sand
[05:28:31.020 --> 05:28:33.020]  river salt
[05:28:33.020 --> 05:28:35.020]  I keep saying salt
[05:28:35.020 --> 05:28:37.020]  sand silt and river gravel
[05:28:37.020 --> 05:28:39.020]  that I harvested
[05:28:39.020 --> 05:28:41.020]  so I got that much though that's
[05:28:41.020 --> 05:28:43.020]  in this layer and then the lava rock
[05:28:43.020 --> 05:28:45.020]  I had to purchase that
[05:28:45.020 --> 05:28:47.020]  the acorns I have at least
[05:28:47.020 --> 05:28:49.020]  in this bed
[05:28:49.020 --> 05:28:51.020]  I'd say
[05:28:51.020 --> 05:28:53.020]  about 20 gallons
[05:28:53.020 --> 05:28:55.020]  to 30 gallons about 5 or 6
[05:28:55.020 --> 05:28:57.020]  buckets of acorns in there
[05:28:57.020 --> 05:28:59.020]  I did 20 pounds
[05:28:59.020 --> 05:29:01.020]  of rice hulls
[05:29:01.020 --> 05:29:03.020]  and then the amendments
[05:29:03.020 --> 05:29:05.020]  I don't have the exact numbers
[05:29:05.020 --> 05:29:07.020]  roughly a pound of each
[05:29:07.020 --> 05:29:09.020]  of the amendments that I listed earlier
[05:29:09.020 --> 05:29:11.020]  and I like to go lighter
[05:29:11.020 --> 05:29:13.020]  than heavier
[05:29:13.020 --> 05:29:15.020]  because everybody knows you can't really take it back
[05:29:15.020 --> 05:29:17.020]  if you go light
[05:29:17.020 --> 05:29:19.020]  you can kind of add it to it
[05:29:19.020 --> 05:29:21.020]  and top dress
[05:29:21.020 --> 05:29:23.020]  as far as
[05:29:23.020 --> 05:29:25.020]  being intimidated
[05:29:25.020 --> 05:29:27.020]  or just not knowing where to start
[05:29:27.020 --> 05:29:29.020]  is kind of where a lot of people
[05:29:29.020 --> 05:29:31.020]  are at
[05:29:31.020 --> 05:29:33.020]  the first step
[05:29:33.020 --> 05:29:35.020]  like I tell everybody
[05:29:35.020 --> 05:29:37.020]  it's a tough one
[05:29:37.020 --> 05:29:39.020]  you got to toss out
[05:29:39.020 --> 05:29:41.020]  the old nutrients
[05:29:41.020 --> 05:29:43.020]  you got to just go ahead and toss those out
[05:29:43.020 --> 05:29:45.020]  now
[05:29:45.020 --> 05:29:47.020]  let me back up
[05:29:47.020 --> 05:29:49.020]  first if you want to start
[05:29:49.020 --> 05:29:51.020]  you already have a bed that you're working on
[05:29:51.020 --> 05:29:53.020]  that's your money maker
[05:29:53.020 --> 05:29:55.020]  you got to keep that going
[05:29:55.020 --> 05:29:57.020]  you got to start this over here
[05:29:57.020 --> 05:29:59.020]  where you can start fresh
[05:29:59.020 --> 05:30:01.020]  you got to keep your money going
[05:30:01.020 --> 05:30:03.020]  start a living soil
[05:30:03.020 --> 05:30:05.020]  and then once you get that going
[05:30:05.020 --> 05:30:07.020]  what's going to happen is you're going to be growing
[05:30:07.020 --> 05:30:09.020]  on this one free
[05:30:09.020 --> 05:30:11.020]  basically very low cost
[05:30:11.020 --> 05:30:13.020]  whereas over here you're going to still be spending money
[05:30:13.020 --> 05:30:15.020]  buying things and what's going to happen
[05:30:15.020 --> 05:30:17.020]  you're going to notice your quality over here is going to be better
[05:30:17.020 --> 05:30:19.020]  and that's where you're going to say
[05:30:19.020 --> 05:30:21.020]  well damn
[05:30:21.020 --> 05:30:23.020]  spending money is not quite as good
[05:30:23.020 --> 05:30:25.020]  or not spending
[05:30:25.020 --> 05:30:27.020]  all that money in wild harvest
[05:30:27.020 --> 05:30:29.020]  and maybe even a little bit better
[05:30:29.020 --> 05:30:31.020]  better
[05:30:31.020 --> 05:30:33.020]  but I think
[05:30:33.020 --> 05:30:35.020]  that's kind of where you got to start
[05:30:35.020 --> 05:30:37.020]  you got to just start you one
[05:30:37.020 --> 05:30:39.020]  even if it's not a 4x4
[05:30:39.020 --> 05:30:41.020]  if you're going to start it with a 20 gallon
[05:30:41.020 --> 05:30:43.020]  start with a nice living soil
[05:30:43.020 --> 05:30:45.020]  and then go out in the woods
[05:30:45.020 --> 05:30:47.020]  and collect your IMO
[05:30:47.020 --> 05:30:49.020]  that's the first step
[05:30:49.020 --> 05:30:51.020]  you got to collect that IMO
[05:30:51.020 --> 05:30:53.020]  because what happens is
[05:30:53.020 --> 05:30:55.020]  when you collect that IMO
[05:30:55.020 --> 05:30:57.020]  it was the same thing that Danny was talking about
[05:30:57.020 --> 05:30:59.020]  and other folks were talking about
[05:30:59.020 --> 05:31:01.020]  you're doing, you're not just reading
[05:31:01.020 --> 05:31:03.020]  we can read, read, read, read
[05:31:03.020 --> 05:31:05.020]  until forever
[05:31:05.020 --> 05:31:07.020]  but if you don't do
[05:31:07.020 --> 05:31:09.020]  you're not really going
[05:31:09.020 --> 05:31:11.020]  it's not going to be practical to you
[05:31:11.020 --> 05:31:13.020]  so really when you collect
[05:31:13.020 --> 05:31:15.020]  that IMO that's a very liberating
[05:31:15.020 --> 05:31:17.020]  step because
[05:31:17.020 --> 05:31:19.020]  you're like wow, they collect that
[05:31:19.020 --> 05:31:21.020]  that's nice
[05:31:21.020 --> 05:31:23.020]  usually the next thing is they reach out
[05:31:23.020 --> 05:31:25.020]  to me and say what do I do with that
[05:31:25.020 --> 05:31:27.020]  you know what I mean
[05:31:27.020 --> 05:31:29.020]  collecting it first
[05:31:29.020 --> 05:31:31.020]  we've stored enough sugar to preserve it
[05:31:31.020 --> 05:31:33.020]  now we have that IMO
[05:31:33.020 --> 05:31:35.020]  I'm ready now, I'm ready
[05:31:35.020 --> 05:31:37.020]  I can start a 20 gallon
[05:31:37.020 --> 05:31:39.020]  I can water that in
[05:31:39.020 --> 05:31:41.020]  and start up
[05:31:41.020 --> 05:31:43.020]  and now start looking to your
[05:31:43.020 --> 05:31:45.020]  wild plants
[05:31:45.020 --> 05:31:47.020]  for your FPJs, JLSs and your nutrients
[05:31:47.020 --> 05:31:49.020]  so that's kind of
[05:31:49.020 --> 05:31:51.020]  where
[05:31:51.020 --> 05:31:53.020]  to me the best place to start
[05:31:53.020 --> 05:31:55.020]  just really getting in there
[05:31:55.020 --> 05:31:57.020]  doing it even if it's a small living soil
[05:31:57.020 --> 05:31:59.020]  and go from there
[05:32:12.360 --> 05:32:14.360]  are there certain
[05:32:14.360 --> 05:32:16.360]  I know there's sometimes a lot of sugars
[05:32:16.360 --> 05:32:18.360]  that we add and stuff that can add
[05:32:18.360 --> 05:32:20.360]  we can cause IPM issues
[05:32:20.360 --> 05:32:22.360]  so I know that
[05:32:22.360 --> 05:32:24.360]  a lot of people especially watching
[05:32:24.360 --> 05:32:26.360]  the show are really getting out getting into
[05:32:26.360 --> 05:32:28.360]  the row of beetles and that kind of thing
[05:32:28.360 --> 05:32:30.360]  I know you dive deeper into this than others
[05:32:30.360 --> 05:32:32.360]  are there other insects that you feel like
[05:32:32.360 --> 05:32:34.360]  predatory mites
[05:32:34.360 --> 05:32:36.360]  just
[05:32:36.360 --> 05:32:38.360]  deeper down that rabbit hole
[05:32:38.360 --> 05:32:40.360]  on stuff that you feel like is extremely
[05:32:40.360 --> 05:32:42.360]  beneficial
[05:32:42.360 --> 05:32:44.360]  yeah really all of the
[05:32:44.360 --> 05:32:46.360]  all of our soil food webinars
[05:32:46.360 --> 05:32:48.360]  to me are very beneficial but I did
[05:32:48.360 --> 05:32:50.360]  like you said Brian I have been focusing more
[05:32:50.360 --> 05:32:52.360]  on row of beetles
[05:32:52.360 --> 05:32:54.360]  I just feel like
[05:32:54.360 --> 05:32:56.360]  I don't know something about them
[05:32:56.360 --> 05:32:58.360]  the way they eat they basically
[05:32:58.360 --> 05:33:00.360]  if y'all know row of beetles are just a
[05:33:00.360 --> 05:33:02.360]  soil beetle there's thousands
[05:33:02.360 --> 05:33:04.360]  of different types of them
[05:33:04.360 --> 05:33:06.360]  but they're just basically a small beetle
[05:33:06.360 --> 05:33:08.360]  that live in the soil and they're very
[05:33:08.360 --> 05:33:10.360]  voracious predators they eat a lot of
[05:33:10.360 --> 05:33:12.360]  things that are negative
[05:33:12.360 --> 05:33:14.360]  in our gardens and they're really
[05:33:14.360 --> 05:33:16.360]  a healthy part of soil food web
[05:33:16.360 --> 05:33:18.360]  so I think
[05:33:18.360 --> 05:33:20.360]  all of those members
[05:33:20.360 --> 05:33:22.360]  from mites to
[05:33:22.360 --> 05:33:24.360]  soil beetles to everything
[05:33:24.360 --> 05:33:26.360]  in that soil food web is important
[05:33:26.360 --> 05:33:28.360]  the key though
[05:33:28.360 --> 05:33:30.360]  to me is the diversity
[05:33:30.360 --> 05:33:32.360]  and taking many
[05:33:32.360 --> 05:33:34.360]  different IMO
[05:33:34.360 --> 05:33:36.360]  collections
[05:33:36.360 --> 05:33:38.360]  using the natural soil
[05:33:38.360 --> 05:33:40.360]  like I have an outdoor soil pile
[05:33:40.360 --> 05:33:42.360]  you should always have even if you grow indoors
[05:33:42.360 --> 05:33:44.360]  you should at least
[05:33:44.360 --> 05:33:46.360]  grow something outdoors and you should
[05:33:46.360 --> 05:33:48.360]  at least have some kind of outdoor
[05:33:48.360 --> 05:33:50.360]  compost type tile or
[05:33:50.360 --> 05:33:52.360]  no turn compost or somewhere
[05:33:52.360 --> 05:33:54.360]  where you're dumping
[05:33:54.360 --> 05:33:56.360]  organic material
[05:33:56.360 --> 05:33:58.360]  that you can take back from
[05:33:58.360 --> 05:34:00.360]  use that as a stockpile and put it back
[05:34:00.360 --> 05:34:02.360]  into your garden
[05:34:02.360 --> 05:34:04.360]  earthworms of course
[05:34:04.360 --> 05:34:06.360]  all the worms are great
[05:34:06.360 --> 05:34:08.360]  I have jumpers, I have wigglers
[05:34:08.360 --> 05:34:10.360]  I'll go for indigenous
[05:34:10.360 --> 05:34:12.360]  to my property
[05:34:12.360 --> 05:34:14.360]  some people freak out about the jumpers
[05:34:14.360 --> 05:34:16.360]  but they're there
[05:34:16.360 --> 05:34:18.360]  what are you going to do
[05:34:18.360 --> 05:34:20.360]  soil seems nice and
[05:34:20.360 --> 05:34:22.360]  healthy with them so I don't
[05:34:22.360 --> 05:34:24.360]  have any issues with jumpers
[05:34:24.360 --> 05:34:26.360]  I have wigglers all in the same
[05:34:26.360 --> 05:34:28.360]  soil
[05:34:33.290 --> 05:34:35.290]  so what do you
[05:34:35.290 --> 05:34:37.290]  personally think about isopods? I know
[05:34:37.290 --> 05:34:39.290]  they're getting out of control
[05:34:39.290 --> 05:34:41.290]  a lot of people handle that at home
[05:34:41.290 --> 05:34:43.290]  rightly so
[05:34:43.290 --> 05:34:45.290]  Stinsland had an extreme
[05:34:45.290 --> 05:34:47.290]  Joshua Stinsland check him out on Instagram
[05:34:47.290 --> 05:34:49.290]  he had an extreme problem
[05:34:49.290 --> 05:34:51.290]  with that
[05:34:51.290 --> 05:34:53.290]  but I also think if you let things get out of hand
[05:34:53.290 --> 05:34:55.290]  with anything, I've had issues
[05:34:55.290 --> 05:34:57.290]  when I let springtails get out of control
[05:34:57.290 --> 05:34:59.290]  moderation is obviously key
[05:34:59.290 --> 05:35:01.290]  correct
[05:35:01.290 --> 05:35:03.290]  dive deeper on that
[05:35:03.290 --> 05:35:05.290]  like you said moderation is the key
[05:35:05.290 --> 05:35:07.290]  and what I've learned about
[05:35:07.290 --> 05:35:09.290]  here's the thing when you have
[05:35:09.290 --> 05:35:11.290]  a living soil
[05:35:11.290 --> 05:35:13.290]  you have to have the habitat
[05:35:13.290 --> 05:35:15.290]  for everything in that living soil
[05:35:15.290 --> 05:35:17.290]  so what happens is
[05:35:17.290 --> 05:35:19.290]  isopods
[05:35:19.290 --> 05:35:21.290]  they love laying under
[05:35:21.290 --> 05:35:23.290]  logs, rind, trees
[05:35:23.290 --> 05:35:25.290]  so when you don't
[05:35:25.290 --> 05:35:27.290]  have enough of that
[05:35:27.290 --> 05:35:29.290]  food source that they eat naturally
[05:35:29.290 --> 05:35:31.290]  then they're going to eat your plants
[05:35:31.290 --> 05:35:33.290]  so when you build these
[05:35:33.290 --> 05:35:35.290]  living soils you have to be mindful
[05:35:35.290 --> 05:35:37.290]  of the habitat that each
[05:35:37.290 --> 05:35:39.290]  of these members that you have in your
[05:35:39.290 --> 05:35:41.290]  soil requires
[05:35:41.290 --> 05:35:43.290]  I never have a problem with isopods
[05:35:43.290 --> 05:35:45.290]  I embrace them
[05:35:45.290 --> 05:35:47.290]  but then again I've never had
[05:35:47.290 --> 05:35:49.290]  a bad outbreak
[05:35:49.290 --> 05:35:51.290]  so I really don't know what that looks like
[05:35:51.290 --> 05:35:53.290]  but
[05:35:53.290 --> 05:35:55.290]  I'm not sure
[05:35:55.290 --> 05:35:57.290]  how that got so bad
[05:35:57.290 --> 05:35:59.290]  but if there's not an outbreak
[05:35:59.290 --> 05:36:01.290]  I mean isopods are very
[05:36:01.290 --> 05:36:03.290]  beneficial and helpful
[05:36:03.290 --> 05:36:05.290]  for recycling nutrients in your soil
[05:36:05.290 --> 05:36:07.290]  springtails are great
[05:36:07.290 --> 05:36:09.290]  I encourage
[05:36:09.290 --> 05:36:11.290]  springtails, I love seeing them
[05:36:11.290 --> 05:36:13.290]  when you have plenty of
[05:36:13.290 --> 05:36:15.290]  springtails you also should
[05:36:15.290 --> 05:36:17.290]  have lots of worm activity too
[05:36:17.290 --> 05:36:19.290]  they kind of go hand in hand
[05:36:19.290 --> 05:36:21.290]  so springtails are great
[05:36:21.290 --> 05:36:23.290]  believe it or not
[05:36:23.290 --> 05:36:25.290]  I see a lot of, I've just stuck with
[05:36:25.290 --> 05:36:27.290]  in a new bed more than an
[05:36:27.290 --> 05:36:29.290]  older bed, it takes time
[05:36:29.290 --> 05:36:31.290]  for things to balance out
[05:36:31.290 --> 05:36:33.290]  so when you start a new bed
[05:36:33.290 --> 05:36:35.290]  one thing I didn't mention, when you start
[05:36:35.290 --> 05:36:37.290]  a living soil bed
[05:36:37.290 --> 05:36:39.290]  always water it in with
[05:36:39.290 --> 05:36:41.290]  BT or mosquito dumps
[05:36:41.290 --> 05:36:43.290]  back to Bacillus therigensis
[05:36:43.290 --> 05:36:45.290]  which
[05:36:45.290 --> 05:36:47.290]  we all know
[05:36:47.290 --> 05:36:49.290]  fungus gnats can be an issue with too much moisture
[05:36:49.290 --> 05:36:51.290]  so when I start these beds
[05:36:51.290 --> 05:36:53.290]  sometimes when
[05:36:53.290 --> 05:36:55.290]  things are wrapped up in tarps for months
[05:36:55.290 --> 05:36:57.290]  sitting outside, things like
[05:36:57.290 --> 05:36:59.290]  fungus gnats can get a little out of control
[05:36:59.290 --> 05:37:01.290]  so when I build the bed I go ahead and start
[05:37:01.290 --> 05:37:03.290]  watering that in
[05:37:03.290 --> 05:37:05.290]  that kind of gets on top of that problem
[05:37:05.290 --> 05:37:07.290]  before it really becomes an issue
[05:37:07.290 --> 05:37:09.290]  things like that
[05:37:09.290 --> 05:37:11.290]  just trying to look ahead
[05:37:11.290 --> 05:37:13.290]  keep
[05:37:13.290 --> 05:37:15.290]  everything in your soil so your plants
[05:37:15.290 --> 05:37:17.290]  aren't in need of anything
[05:37:17.290 --> 05:37:19.290]  that comes down to amending it
[05:37:19.290 --> 05:37:21.290]  early
[05:37:21.290 --> 05:37:23.290]  before you grow plants, amend it
[05:37:23.290 --> 05:37:25.290]  like I, it's funny
[05:37:25.290 --> 05:37:27.290]  because I mean
[05:37:27.290 --> 05:37:29.290]  I had the time but I started
[05:37:29.290 --> 05:37:31.290]  this new bed in my workshop
[05:37:31.290 --> 05:37:33.290]  so literally it's been like a three
[05:37:33.290 --> 05:37:35.290]  month process before I even put the
[05:37:35.290 --> 05:37:37.290]  first plant into it because I wanted to make
[05:37:37.290 --> 05:37:39.290]  sure A, I got it mixed
[05:37:39.290 --> 05:37:41.290]  right, B, my soil food
[05:37:41.290 --> 05:37:43.290]  web inhabitants are all living in there
[05:37:43.290 --> 05:37:45.290]  nicely, C, my
[05:37:45.290 --> 05:37:47.290]  cover crop grew
[05:37:47.290 --> 05:37:49.290]  if my cover crop grows
[05:37:49.290 --> 05:37:51.290]  right now I'm feeling good about this
[05:37:51.290 --> 05:37:53.290]  everything's getting in balance and then I finally
[05:37:53.290 --> 05:37:55.290]  put my plant in there
[05:37:55.290 --> 05:37:57.290]  and then that grows just
[05:37:57.290 --> 05:37:59.290]  like it should
[05:37:59.290 --> 05:38:01.290]  so the biggest thing with natural
[05:38:01.290 --> 05:38:03.290]  farming to me and
[05:38:03.290 --> 05:38:05.290]  living soil is kind of
[05:38:05.290 --> 05:38:07.290]  you can't really rush it
[05:38:07.290 --> 05:38:09.290]  I mean you can, but rushing it will
[05:38:09.290 --> 05:38:11.290]  get things, probably lead to a little
[05:38:11.290 --> 05:38:13.290]  more problems, I'd much rather just
[05:38:13.290 --> 05:38:15.290]  get everything in there
[05:38:15.290 --> 05:38:17.290]  and then let it balance
[05:38:17.290 --> 05:38:19.290]  itself out and then that's
[05:38:19.290 --> 05:38:21.290]  going to give me a much better quality
[05:38:21.290 --> 05:38:23.290]  soil for long term
[05:38:23.290 --> 05:38:25.290]  and by balancing it out
[05:38:25.290 --> 05:38:27.290]  I mean we put amendments
[05:38:27.290 --> 05:38:29.290]  in there and now you've got all this biology
[05:38:29.290 --> 05:38:31.290]  in here so everything has to
[05:38:31.290 --> 05:38:33.290]  eat, breathe, die, live
[05:38:33.290 --> 05:38:35.290]  and eat each other,
[05:38:35.290 --> 05:38:37.290]  poop, eat, you know, there's just so much
[05:38:37.290 --> 05:38:39.290]  going on and it takes time for that to shuffle
[05:38:39.290 --> 05:38:41.290]  out, but once it does
[05:38:41.290 --> 05:38:43.290]  you'll notice some pretty cool things
[05:38:43.290 --> 05:38:45.290]  like I said, everything
[05:38:45.290 --> 05:38:47.290]  I've got in my store is pretty much indigenous
[05:38:47.290 --> 05:38:49.290]  to my area or I may have to buy some
[05:38:49.290 --> 05:38:51.290]  things like the rice hulls
[05:38:51.290 --> 05:38:53.290]  and the lava rock
[05:38:53.290 --> 05:38:55.290]  like I noticed colonies of
[05:38:55.290 --> 05:38:57.290]  orange springtails
[05:38:57.290 --> 05:38:59.290]  like just, you know
[05:38:59.290 --> 05:39:01.290]  a colony created itself and I think I sent
[05:39:01.290 --> 05:39:03.290]  you that picture Brian
[05:39:03.290 --> 05:39:05.290]  I mean stuff like that, like you
[05:39:05.290 --> 05:39:07.290]  really, we love
[05:39:07.290 --> 05:39:09.290]  our plants, but when you
[05:39:09.290 --> 05:39:11.290]  get into living soil, sometimes you get
[05:39:11.290 --> 05:39:13.290]  carried away into the critters
[05:39:13.290 --> 05:39:15.290]  that are in there too, you know what I mean, they become
[05:39:15.290 --> 05:39:17.290]  part of your community
[05:39:17.290 --> 05:39:19.290]  too. I have
[05:39:19.290 --> 05:39:21.290]  a buddy set up a grow
[05:39:21.290 --> 05:39:23.290]  like I said, Virginia
[05:39:23.290 --> 05:39:25.290]  we're 10 days old, this buddy
[05:39:25.290 --> 05:39:27.290]  never grew anything before
[05:39:27.290 --> 05:39:29.290]  so we set him up
[05:39:29.290 --> 05:39:31.290]  a little 4x4 and
[05:39:31.290 --> 05:39:33.290]  this makes me smile because
[05:39:33.290 --> 05:39:35.290]  two days later
[05:39:35.290 --> 05:39:37.290]  we were talking, I was like how's it going man
[05:39:37.290 --> 05:39:39.290]  and he said man
[05:39:39.290 --> 05:39:41.290]  I put my head in there and he said it just smells
[05:39:41.290 --> 05:39:43.290]  different, he said
[05:39:43.290 --> 05:39:45.290]  it smells a lot, I was like
[05:39:45.290 --> 05:39:47.290]  yeah man, I said that's it, I said
[05:39:47.290 --> 05:39:49.290]  you know, way before you put
[05:39:49.290 --> 05:39:51.290]  a plant in there, your soil is your
[05:39:51.290 --> 05:39:53.290]  commodity, that's where your life
[05:39:53.290 --> 05:39:55.290]  is, like
[05:39:55.290 --> 05:39:57.290]  if someone chops down your plant
[05:39:57.290 --> 05:39:59.290]  well, you can grow another plant, if somebody
[05:39:59.290 --> 05:40:01.290]  took that soil and messed it up
[05:40:01.290 --> 05:40:03.290]  that's a whole other process
[05:40:03.290 --> 05:40:05.290]  so your soil is your commodity
[05:40:05.290 --> 05:40:07.290]  you know, your plant is just to me
[05:40:07.290 --> 05:40:09.290]  the byproduct of
[05:40:09.290 --> 05:40:11.290]  a quality living soil
[05:40:11.290 --> 05:40:13.290]  and that's just kind of
[05:40:13.290 --> 05:40:15.290]  you know, I focus
[05:40:15.290 --> 05:40:17.290]  more on the soil
[05:40:17.290 --> 05:40:19.290]  and then the plants just do their thing
[05:40:19.290 --> 05:40:21.290]  like I don't have to bother with them
[05:40:21.290 --> 05:40:23.290]  another cool thing is
[05:40:23.290 --> 05:40:25.290]  like, I remember man, like
[05:40:25.290 --> 05:40:27.290]  chasing pests, like back in the
[05:40:27.290 --> 05:40:29.290]  bottles days and all that
[05:40:29.290 --> 05:40:31.290]  pests just popping up
[05:40:31.290 --> 05:40:33.290]  you know, randomly
[05:40:33.290 --> 05:40:35.290]  where does this come from?
[05:40:35.290 --> 05:40:37.290]  but with living soil man, I
[05:40:37.290 --> 05:40:39.290]  haven't, knock on wood
[05:40:39.290 --> 05:40:41.290]  I haven't had pests in
[05:40:41.290 --> 05:40:43.290]  seven years, like the whole
[05:40:43.290 --> 05:40:45.290]  life of that bed that I'm on right
[05:40:45.290 --> 05:40:47.290]  now, no pests, no
[05:40:47.290 --> 05:40:49.290]  issues, and what it is is
[05:40:49.290 --> 05:40:51.290]  a combination of natural
[05:40:51.290 --> 05:40:53.290]  farming, which natural
[05:40:53.290 --> 05:40:55.290]  farming focuses on doing a lot of foliar
[05:40:55.290 --> 05:40:57.290]  sprays, so what
[05:40:57.290 --> 05:40:59.290]  you're doing with the foliar spray in
[05:40:59.290 --> 05:41:01.290]  natural farming is you're applying that
[05:41:01.290 --> 05:41:03.290]  biology to all surfaces of the leaves
[05:41:03.290 --> 05:41:05.290]  what happens is that now
[05:41:05.290 --> 05:41:07.290]  that biology is on that leaf, if some
[05:41:07.290 --> 05:41:09.290]  kind of pest or predator lands on that leaf
[05:41:09.290 --> 05:41:11.290]  they can't really get a foothold
[05:41:11.290 --> 05:41:13.290]  you know, there's nowhere for
[05:41:13.290 --> 05:41:15.290]  them to go, you know, it's not
[05:41:15.290 --> 05:41:17.290]  favorable for them to be there
[05:41:17.290 --> 05:41:19.290]  and then that along
[05:41:19.290 --> 05:41:21.290]  with the health of the soil
[05:41:21.290 --> 05:41:23.290]  translates to the health of the plant
[05:41:23.290 --> 05:41:25.290]  so that plant is just stronger and can fight
[05:41:25.290 --> 05:41:27.290]  any kind of pest
[05:41:27.290 --> 05:41:29.290]  and way better
[05:41:29.290 --> 05:41:31.290]  than some weak
[05:41:31.290 --> 05:41:33.290]  plant that was grown with
[05:41:33.290 --> 05:41:35.290]  synthetic or bio nutrients
[05:41:35.290 --> 05:41:37.290]  one thing I talk
[05:41:37.290 --> 05:41:39.290]  about is I like to grow
[05:41:39.290 --> 05:41:41.290]  things strong, I like to grow strong microbes
[05:41:41.290 --> 05:41:43.290]  like a lot of people, and this
[05:41:43.290 --> 05:41:45.290]  probably rubbed some folks the wrong way, but
[05:41:45.290 --> 05:41:47.290]  a lot of people, and trust me
[05:41:47.290 --> 05:41:49.290]  I brew teas too, but
[05:41:49.290 --> 05:41:51.290]  I use a Vortex brewer
[05:41:51.290 --> 05:41:53.290]  a lot of
[05:41:53.290 --> 05:41:55.290]  people swear by just seeing
[05:41:55.290 --> 05:41:57.290]  the foam on a tea, like
[05:41:57.290 --> 05:41:59.290]  when a tea froths up, it's gotta be
[05:41:59.290 --> 05:42:01.290]  good, you know, that's
[05:42:01.290 --> 05:42:03.290]  not necessarily an indicator of
[05:42:03.290 --> 05:42:05.290]  the biology that's in that tea
[05:42:05.290 --> 05:42:07.290]  one example
[05:42:07.290 --> 05:42:09.290]  I like to use, if I take a glass of milk
[05:42:09.290 --> 05:42:11.290]  and I blow it in with a straw, I'm gonna
[05:42:11.290 --> 05:42:13.290]  froth up, I'll get a
[05:42:13.290 --> 05:42:15.290]  froth on top of that, that doesn't tell me
[05:42:15.290 --> 05:42:17.290]  that there's microbiology in there, that
[05:42:17.290 --> 05:42:19.290]  just tells me that it's probably proteins
[05:42:19.290 --> 05:42:21.290]  or something else that's causing
[05:42:21.290 --> 05:42:23.290]  that to foam up, bubble up
[05:42:23.290 --> 05:42:25.290]  so, the other thing is
[05:42:25.290 --> 05:42:27.290]  when you grow
[05:42:27.290 --> 05:42:29.290]  you know, with natural farming
[05:42:29.290 --> 05:42:31.290]  I don't like to do air stones
[05:42:31.290 --> 05:42:33.290]  or, you know, a lot
[05:42:33.290 --> 05:42:35.290]  of what I'm doing
[05:42:35.290 --> 05:42:37.290]  when I'm doing brews
[05:42:37.290 --> 05:42:39.290]  and the reason why is because I feel like
[05:42:39.290 --> 05:42:41.290]  you're growing those microbes
[05:42:41.290 --> 05:42:43.290]  in an artificially rich environment
[05:42:43.290 --> 05:42:45.290]  and so that's
[05:42:45.290 --> 05:42:47.290]  easy, so you're growing weak microbes
[05:42:47.290 --> 05:42:49.290]  like you gave them
[05:42:49.290 --> 05:42:51.290]  molasses and you gave them air
[05:42:51.290 --> 05:42:53.290]  two things that aren't going to be in the soil
[05:42:53.290 --> 05:42:55.290]  when they get there
[05:42:55.290 --> 05:42:57.290]  I'd much rather do a
[05:42:57.290 --> 05:42:59.290]  JLF
[05:42:59.290 --> 05:43:01.290]  where it just sets in that water
[05:43:01.290 --> 05:43:03.290]  and just kind of does its thing
[05:43:03.290 --> 05:43:05.290]  and then those microbes are going to be tough
[05:43:05.290 --> 05:43:07.290]  when those microbes reach the soil
[05:43:07.290 --> 05:43:09.290]  that soil is probably a better
[05:43:09.290 --> 05:43:11.290]  environment for them than the liquid
[05:43:11.290 --> 05:43:13.290]  they came out of
[05:43:13.290 --> 05:43:15.290]  so, things like that
[05:43:15.290 --> 05:43:17.290]  I always try to focus on
[05:43:17.290 --> 05:43:19.290]  growing the microbes strong
[05:43:19.290 --> 05:43:21.290]  and getting that
[05:43:21.290 --> 05:43:23.290]  strong biology in my soil
[05:43:23.290 --> 05:43:25.290]  and really getting that
[05:43:25.290 --> 05:43:27.290]  starting it at a strong forest
[05:43:27.290 --> 05:43:29.290]  and collecting it from there
[05:43:29.290 --> 05:43:31.290]  is really the key for me on that
[05:43:43.920 --> 05:43:45.920]  the water?
[05:43:45.920 --> 05:43:47.920]  can we repeat that question real quick?
[05:43:47.920 --> 05:43:49.920]  I'm here
[05:43:51.920 --> 05:43:53.920]  okay
[05:43:53.920 --> 05:43:55.920]  yeah
[05:43:55.920 --> 05:43:57.920]  well so
[05:43:57.920 --> 05:43:59.920]  what I did, I have a
[05:43:59.920 --> 05:44:01.920]  I dug a small pond
[05:44:01.920 --> 05:44:03.920]  I have a natural pond on my property
[05:44:03.920 --> 05:44:05.920]  for outdoor
[05:44:05.920 --> 05:44:07.920]  and basically I'll just take that
[05:44:07.920 --> 05:44:09.920]  scoop water out of there
[05:44:09.920 --> 05:44:11.920]  if I need just water
[05:44:11.920 --> 05:44:13.920]  I also have a rain catchment
[05:44:13.920 --> 05:44:15.920]  where I have three 50 gallon barrels
[05:44:15.920 --> 05:44:17.920]  that are kind of elevated so I can use
[05:44:17.920 --> 05:44:19.920]  gravity
[05:44:19.920 --> 05:44:21.920]  they're the highest point on the farm
[05:44:21.920 --> 05:44:23.920]  property
[05:44:23.920 --> 05:44:25.920]  I guess I can't call it a farm
[05:44:25.920 --> 05:44:27.920]  because I don't have any animals
[05:44:27.920 --> 05:44:29.920]  but we got about three quarters of an acre
[05:44:29.920 --> 05:44:31.920]  in the old town part of our city
[05:44:31.920 --> 05:44:33.920]  city lot type stuff
[05:44:33.920 --> 05:44:35.920]  so I have that
[05:44:35.920 --> 05:44:37.920]  rain catchment system
[05:44:37.920 --> 05:44:39.920]  and then
[05:44:39.920 --> 05:44:41.920]  basically then my JLF barrels
[05:44:41.920 --> 05:44:43.920]  I have
[05:44:43.920 --> 05:44:45.920]  at least
[05:44:45.920 --> 05:44:47.920]  1000 gallons of different JLFs
[05:44:47.920 --> 05:44:49.920]  in barrels
[05:44:49.920 --> 05:44:51.920]  those are all liquid so
[05:44:51.920 --> 05:44:53.920]  anytime I need water
[05:44:53.920 --> 05:44:55.920]  that's part of my liquid
[05:44:55.920 --> 05:44:57.920]  gotta be diluted but it's all right there
[05:44:57.920 --> 05:44:59.920]  I use a lot of rain water
[05:44:59.920 --> 05:45:01.920]  I'm big on rain water
[05:45:01.920 --> 05:45:03.920]  I love rain water
[05:45:03.920 --> 05:45:05.920]  I don't know if people, someone asked me before
[05:45:05.920 --> 05:45:07.920]  aren't you worried about
[05:45:07.920 --> 05:45:09.920]  such and such of rain water?
[05:45:09.920 --> 05:45:11.920]  I'm like man damn if we gotta worry about rain water
[05:45:11.920 --> 05:45:13.920]  I'm out
[05:45:13.920 --> 05:45:15.920]  there's not much I can do
[05:45:15.920 --> 05:45:17.920]  about that
[05:45:17.920 --> 05:45:19.920]  yeah a lot of rain water
[05:45:19.920 --> 05:45:21.920]  it's a great asset
[05:45:21.920 --> 05:45:23.920]  even when it's sitting in the barrels
[05:45:23.920 --> 05:45:25.920]  there's microbes everywhere
[05:45:25.920 --> 05:45:27.920]  there's always microbiology being collected
[05:45:27.920 --> 05:45:29.920]  in your barrels
[05:45:29.920 --> 05:45:31.920]  so
[05:45:31.920 --> 05:45:33.920]  that's always a good thing
[05:45:39.240 --> 05:45:41.240]  as far, and also
[05:45:41.240 --> 05:45:43.240]  I also like to use
[05:45:43.240 --> 05:45:45.240]  I also have one of those RV filters
[05:45:45.240 --> 05:45:47.240]  inline hose filter
[05:45:47.240 --> 05:45:49.240]  it'll go right on your spigot
[05:45:49.240 --> 05:45:51.240]  it's a little bit adapter size
[05:45:51.240 --> 05:45:53.240]  if you ever don't have rain water
[05:45:53.240 --> 05:45:55.240]  and you run out
[05:45:55.240 --> 05:45:57.240]  I'll use that hose with that
[05:45:57.240 --> 05:45:59.240]  inline filter on it
[05:45:59.240 --> 05:46:01.240]  so I don't have any chlorine and that kind of stuff
[05:46:01.240 --> 05:46:03.240]  in my water
[05:46:03.240 --> 05:46:05.240]  biggest thing is you don't want the chlorine in there
[05:46:05.240 --> 05:46:07.240]  it's gonna degrade your microbes
[05:46:09.240 --> 05:46:11.240]  and that kind of thing
[05:46:11.240 --> 05:46:13.240]  yeah
[05:46:13.240 --> 05:46:15.240]  that's kind of a nutshell of the water
[05:46:15.240 --> 05:46:17.240]  you got any other questions in there Brian?
[05:46:21.240 --> 05:46:23.240]  no man we appreciate you
[05:46:23.240 --> 05:46:25.240]  yeah I mean I think I pretty much touched on everything
[05:46:25.240 --> 05:46:27.240]  I know folks are probably ready to hear
[05:46:27.240 --> 05:46:29.240]  my man Brandon come on
[05:46:29.240 --> 05:46:31.240]  I am too
[05:46:31.240 --> 05:46:33.240]  and like I said man thanks again
[05:46:33.240 --> 05:46:35.240]  what's your social media
[05:46:35.240 --> 05:46:37.240]  and again we've had
[05:46:37.240 --> 05:46:39.240]  Marco as a guest on the Thursday show
[05:46:39.240 --> 05:46:41.240]  episode 15

[05:46:43.240 --> 05:46:45.240]  about another 3 hours of conversation
[05:46:45.240 --> 05:46:47.240]  we just really dialed in information
[05:46:47.240 --> 05:46:49.240]  like I said we're not trying to have any flops
[05:46:49.240 --> 05:46:51.240]  so we'll get right into it
[05:46:51.240 --> 05:46:53.240]  yeah that's right
[05:46:53.240 --> 05:46:55.240]  yeah y'all can follow me on
[05:46:55.240 --> 05:46:57.240]  Marco underscore is underscore growing

[05:47:01.240 --> 05:47:03.240]  that's the only place you can find me

[05:47:15.240 --> 05:47:17.240]  I don't think we have a set date
[05:47:17.240 --> 05:47:19.240]  for our first show but we're going to be
[05:47:19.240 --> 05:47:21.240]  announcing that real soon
[05:47:21.240 --> 05:47:23.240]  hopefully it'll be at that destination
[05:47:23.240 --> 05:47:25.240]  behind the scenes
[05:47:25.240 --> 05:47:27.240]  yeah we're
[05:47:27.240 --> 05:47:29.240]  planning on doing some destination stuff
[05:47:29.240 --> 05:47:31.240]  live at some
[05:47:31.240 --> 05:47:33.240]  groves live at different
[05:47:33.240 --> 05:47:35.240]  locations
[05:47:35.240 --> 05:47:37.240]  just yeah definitely looking
[05:47:37.240 --> 05:47:39.240]  forward to the rest of this year being great
[05:47:41.240 --> 05:47:43.240]  applause
[05:47:43.240 --> 05:47:52.850]  applause
[05:47:52.850 --> 05:47:54.850]  alright so like
[05:47:54.850 --> 05:47:56.850]  I said
[05:47:56.850 --> 05:47:58.850]  getting into cannabis and trying
[05:47:58.850 --> 05:48:00.850]  to understand things
[05:48:00.850 --> 05:48:02.850]  you have to be self taught
[05:48:02.850 --> 05:48:04.850]  especially back in the day
[05:48:04.850 --> 05:48:06.850]  especially on forums there was a lot of
[05:48:06.850 --> 05:48:08.850]  so called experts there was a lot of people that
[05:48:08.850 --> 05:48:10.850]  would still to this day
[05:48:10.850 --> 05:48:12.850]  even you know they'll talk in the chat all
[05:48:12.850 --> 05:48:14.850]  day long but if you ask them to see their plants
[05:48:14.850 --> 05:48:16.850]  they never want to show that
[05:48:16.850 --> 05:48:18.850]  the future that we have on the future cannabis project
[05:48:18.850 --> 05:48:20.850]  he's been doing this longer before
[05:48:20.850 --> 05:48:22.850]  Peter asked me to be doing
[05:48:22.850 --> 05:48:24.850]  the show on his platform as well
[05:48:24.850 --> 05:48:26.850]  is our guest this evening Brandon Russ
[05:48:26.850 --> 05:48:28.850]  I can't say enough about this
[05:48:28.850 --> 05:48:30.850]  guy I think he is changing the game and
[05:48:30.850 --> 05:48:32.850]  understanding stuff and also showing
[05:48:32.850 --> 05:48:34.850]  people in real time his commercial
[05:48:34.850 --> 05:48:36.850]  growth so for a lot of you
[05:48:36.850 --> 05:48:38.850]  out there that maybe not have
[05:48:38.850 --> 05:48:40.850]  been able to cultivate at that
[05:48:40.850 --> 05:48:42.850]  level I assure you that when you
[05:48:42.850 --> 05:48:44.850]  pan into most people's
[05:48:44.850 --> 05:48:46.850]  commercial growth there's deficiencies
[05:48:46.850 --> 05:48:48.850]  through the roof there's a lot of IPM issues
[05:48:48.850 --> 05:48:50.850]  stuff like that so again shout
[05:48:50.850 --> 05:48:52.850]  out to the best and brightest minds
[05:48:52.850 --> 05:48:54.850]  and Brandon is one of them so I'm
[05:48:54.850 --> 05:48:56.850]  excited to bring you up here buddy and
[05:48:56.850 --> 05:48:58.850]  I'm sure you're going to have a lot of questions but we also
[05:48:58.850 --> 05:49:00.850]  want to
[05:49:00.850 --> 05:49:02.850]  touch on a lot of things on future cannabis so
[05:49:02.850 --> 05:49:04.850]  we want to make sure that
[05:49:04.850 --> 05:49:06.850]  you can give us those gold
[05:49:06.850 --> 05:49:08.850]  nuggets that we might not have heard of
[05:49:08.850 --> 05:49:10.850]  before
[05:49:10.850 --> 05:49:12.850]  appreciate you having me out
[05:49:12.850 --> 05:49:14.850]  here humbled to be here
[05:49:14.850 --> 05:49:16.850]  I've been doing this a long time but I
[05:49:16.850 --> 05:49:18.850]  just kind of like to show
[05:49:18.850 --> 05:49:20.850]  what's possible
[05:49:20.850 --> 05:49:22.850]  and it's not always
[05:49:22.850 --> 05:49:24.850]  as easy as
[05:49:24.850 --> 05:49:26.850]  I make it look
[05:49:26.850 --> 05:49:28.850]  it takes a lot of hard work
[05:49:28.850 --> 05:49:30.850]  it takes team effort and even
[05:49:30.850 --> 05:49:32.850]  that sometimes
[05:49:32.850 --> 05:49:34.850]  when you go from
[05:49:34.850 --> 05:49:36.850]  you know
[05:49:36.850 --> 05:49:38.850]  running a
[05:49:38.850 --> 05:49:40.850]  house on the traditional
[05:49:40.850 --> 05:49:42.850]  market to scaling
[05:49:42.850 --> 05:49:44.850]  production it can be a challenge
[05:49:44.850 --> 05:49:46.850]  especially in
[05:49:46.850 --> 05:49:48.850]  new territory especially when you
[05:49:48.850 --> 05:49:50.850]  have to face a lot
[05:49:50.850 --> 05:49:52.850]  of different challenges so
[05:49:52.850 --> 05:49:54.850]  if you guys
[05:49:54.850 --> 05:49:56.850]  don't know me my name is Brandon
[05:49:56.850 --> 05:49:58.850]  Russ I've been cultivating
[05:49:58.850 --> 05:50:00.850]  professionally almost for
[05:50:00.850 --> 05:50:02.850]  20 years and when I
[05:50:02.850 --> 05:50:04.850]  mean professionally I mean
[05:50:04.850 --> 05:50:06.850]  as a daily
[05:50:06.850 --> 05:50:08.850]  job you know it's something
[05:50:08.850 --> 05:50:10.850]  that I would wake up in the morning and I'd go
[05:50:10.850 --> 05:50:12.850]  multiple houses with the
[05:50:12.850 --> 05:50:14.850]  OG's that I worked with
[05:50:14.850 --> 05:50:16.850]  back in the day and we would
[05:50:16.850 --> 05:50:18.850]  go eat and that's what we did for
[05:50:18.850 --> 05:50:20.850]  a really long time
[05:50:20.850 --> 05:50:22.850]  I've been to prison
[05:50:22.850 --> 05:50:24.850]  a couple of times for it
[05:50:24.850 --> 05:50:26.850]  because those
[05:50:26.850 --> 05:50:28.850]  were the risks I knew what the risks were
[05:50:28.850 --> 05:50:30.850]  did it anyway
[05:50:30.850 --> 05:50:32.850]  bad circumstances but that was
[05:50:32.850 --> 05:50:34.850]  the time that I lived in and when I had an opportunity
[05:50:34.850 --> 05:50:36.850]  to come out here to Oklahoma I capitalized
[05:50:36.850 --> 05:50:38.850]  on that opportunity
[05:50:38.850 --> 05:50:40.850]  and there's going to be a lot of opportunities
[05:50:40.850 --> 05:50:42.850]  like that opening up
[05:50:42.850 --> 05:50:44.850]  all over the country as
[05:50:44.850 --> 05:50:46.850]  the legalization of cannabis continues
[05:50:46.850 --> 05:50:48.850]  I was
[05:50:48.850 --> 05:50:50.850]  really fortunate enough to take
[05:50:50.850 --> 05:50:52.850]  my experience
[05:50:52.850 --> 05:50:54.850]  my hands on experience and my knowledge
[05:50:54.850 --> 05:50:56.850]  that I had in
[05:50:56.850 --> 05:50:58.850]  the organic
[05:50:58.850 --> 05:51:00.850]  cultivation
[05:51:00.850 --> 05:51:02.850]  and I was able to apply
[05:51:02.850 --> 05:51:04.850]  a lot of
[05:51:04.850 --> 05:51:06.850]  standard agronomic practices
[05:51:06.850 --> 05:51:08.850]  that are
[05:51:08.850 --> 05:51:10.850]  standard in traditional
[05:51:10.850 --> 05:51:12.850]  crops such as
[05:51:12.850 --> 05:51:14.850]  wine and corn and such
[05:51:14.850 --> 05:51:16.850]  so
[05:51:16.850 --> 05:51:18.850]  my journey for education has
[05:51:18.850 --> 05:51:20.850]  never stopped
[05:51:20.850 --> 05:51:22.850]  and
[05:51:22.850 --> 05:51:24.850]  you know when I
[05:51:24.850 --> 05:51:26.850]  moved into the
[05:51:26.850 --> 05:51:28.850]  commercial space
[05:51:28.850 --> 05:51:30.850]  in the legal space
[05:51:30.850 --> 05:51:32.850]  trying to maintain
[05:51:32.850 --> 05:51:34.850]  things
[05:51:34.850 --> 05:51:36.850]  consistently
[05:51:36.850 --> 05:51:38.850]  was the goal
[05:51:38.850 --> 05:51:40.850]  always in mind right you want to maintain
[05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:42.850]  consistent quality
[05:51:42.850 --> 05:51:44.850]  all the time
[05:51:44.850 --> 05:51:46.850]  and to be able to do that in
[05:51:46.850 --> 05:51:48.850]  the types of systems that are
[05:51:48.850 --> 05:51:50.850]  organic you know what I found
[05:51:50.850 --> 05:51:52.850]  out in my experience that it required
[05:51:52.850 --> 05:51:54.850]  collecting data agronomic
[05:51:54.850 --> 05:51:56.850]  data to find out what your soil
[05:51:56.850 --> 05:51:58.850]  nutritional levels are finding
[05:51:58.850 --> 05:52:00.850]  out how that soil
[05:52:00.850 --> 05:52:02.850]  falls into solution
[05:52:02.850 --> 05:52:04.850]  and then being able to test tissue
[05:52:04.850 --> 05:52:06.850]  and sap to see both the nutritional
[05:52:06.850 --> 05:52:08.850]  content of the material that's in there
[05:52:08.850 --> 05:52:10.850]  and then also to understand
[05:52:10.850 --> 05:52:12.850]  how the
[05:52:12.850 --> 05:52:14.850]  mineral nutrition is being
[05:52:14.850 --> 05:52:16.850]  moved and
[05:52:16.850 --> 05:52:18.850]  translocated inside
[05:52:18.850 --> 05:52:20.850]  the plant
[05:52:20.850 --> 05:52:22.850]  so that's kind of the approach that
[05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:24.850]  I've been taking
[05:52:24.850 --> 05:52:26.850]  you know there's
[05:52:26.850 --> 05:52:28.850]  kind of a
[05:52:28.850 --> 05:52:30.850]  there's kind of like two
[05:52:30.850 --> 05:52:32.850]  modes of thought
[05:52:32.850 --> 05:52:34.850]  and I come
[05:52:34.850 --> 05:52:36.850]  and I kind of am branching off in the way
[05:52:36.850 --> 05:52:38.850]  that I think about how
[05:52:38.850 --> 05:52:40.850]  organic production at scale
[05:52:40.850 --> 05:52:42.850]  works and
[05:52:42.850 --> 05:52:44.850]  a lot of
[05:52:44.850 --> 05:52:46.850]  the science that we're looking at
[05:52:46.850 --> 05:52:48.850]  is made for
[05:52:48.850 --> 05:52:50.850]  agronomic soils and they're based off
[05:52:50.850 --> 05:52:52.850]  of principles for building
[05:52:52.850 --> 05:52:54.850]  soil and building soil
[05:52:54.850 --> 05:52:56.850]  health and fertility in
[05:52:56.850 --> 05:52:58.850]  agronomic settings and
[05:52:58.850 --> 05:53:00.850]  what we've done is we've kind
[05:53:00.850 --> 05:53:02.850]  of taken ourselves out
[05:53:02.850 --> 05:53:04.850]  of that realm of thinking because
[05:53:04.850 --> 05:53:06.850]  we have these modified mixes that
[05:53:06.850 --> 05:53:08.850]  don't contain actually any
[05:53:08.850 --> 05:53:10.850]  naturally weathered materials
[05:53:10.850 --> 05:53:12.850]  things like sand, silt, and clay
[05:53:12.850 --> 05:53:14.850]  and we add our own types of
[05:53:14.850 --> 05:53:16.850]  mineral
[05:53:16.850 --> 05:53:18.850]  amendments in there we're adding things like
[05:53:18.850 --> 05:53:20.850]  pumice, rice hulls, compost
[05:53:20.850 --> 05:53:22.850]  into the mineral
[05:53:22.850 --> 05:53:24.850]  amendments and we're looking at
[05:53:24.850 --> 05:53:26.850]  the amount
[05:53:26.850 --> 05:53:28.850]  and then the sufficiency that
[05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:30.850]  are the target levels
[05:53:30.850 --> 05:53:32.850]  for cannabis
[05:53:32.850 --> 05:53:34.850]  for the type of cultivation
[05:53:34.850 --> 05:53:36.850]  that I'm doing so
[05:53:36.850 --> 05:53:38.850]  while I once focused
[05:53:38.850 --> 05:53:40.850]  super heavily on
[05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:42.850]  biologicals and I was you know a lot
[05:53:42.850 --> 05:53:44.850]  of times over applying
[05:53:44.850 --> 05:53:46.850]  different types of
[05:53:46.850 --> 05:53:48.850]  meals and top dress amendments
[05:53:48.850 --> 05:53:50.850]  being able to collect
[05:53:50.850 --> 05:53:52.850]  analytic data has allowed me
[05:53:52.850 --> 05:53:54.850]  to see and
[05:53:54.850 --> 05:53:56.850]  maintain sufficient levels
[05:53:56.850 --> 05:53:58.850]  and balance throughout the soil system
[05:53:58.850 --> 05:54:00.850]  so that way when I'm watering
[05:54:00.850 --> 05:54:02.850]  the system everything that needs
[05:54:02.850 --> 05:54:04.850]  to be in solution
[05:54:04.850 --> 05:54:06.850]  biologically to the plant
[05:54:06.850 --> 05:54:08.850]  is there and so what I'm
[05:54:08.850 --> 05:54:10.850]  able to do is I'm able to do a top dress
[05:54:10.850 --> 05:54:12.850]  amendment which a lot of organic farmers
[05:54:12.850 --> 05:54:14.850]  are familiar with
[05:54:14.850 --> 05:54:16.850]  but when you start off with a
[05:54:16.850 --> 05:54:18.850]  really high quality soil that
[05:54:18.850 --> 05:54:20.850]  has a lot of mineral amendment, has the mineral
[05:54:20.850 --> 05:54:22.850]  sufficiency and it's balanced in the right
[05:54:22.850 --> 05:54:24.850]  proper balance you don't need
[05:54:24.850 --> 05:54:26.850]  to add a whole lot
[05:54:26.850 --> 05:54:28.850]  adding things like target specific
[05:54:28.850 --> 05:54:30.850]  microbes is more of my
[05:54:30.850 --> 05:54:32.850]  play on a commercial scale
[05:54:32.850 --> 05:54:34.850]  as opposed to
[05:54:34.850 --> 05:54:36.850]  some things like collecting
[05:54:36.850 --> 05:54:38.850]  indigenous microorganisms
[05:54:38.850 --> 05:54:40.850]  now there's more than one way to skin a cat
[05:54:40.850 --> 05:54:42.850]  and there's more than one way to grow
[05:54:42.850 --> 05:54:44.850]  cannabis and I'm
[05:54:44.850 --> 05:54:46.850]  specifically talking about my experience
[05:54:46.850 --> 05:54:48.850]  with organics at scale
[05:54:48.850 --> 05:54:50.850]  building up the soil
[05:54:50.850 --> 05:54:52.850]  and also using things like target
[05:54:52.850 --> 05:54:54.850]  specific microorganisms that
[05:54:54.850 --> 05:54:56.850]  you know are going to have a direct effect
[05:54:56.850 --> 05:54:58.850]  on that soil system
[05:54:58.850 --> 05:55:00.850]  as far as the chemical makeup of
[05:55:00.850 --> 05:55:02.850]  that soil because what we're seeing is
[05:55:02.850 --> 05:55:04.850]  that
[05:55:04.850 --> 05:55:06.850]  the chemistry of that soil
[05:55:06.850 --> 05:55:08.850]  and the hydrology
[05:55:08.850 --> 05:55:10.850]  and how things constantly are
[05:55:10.850 --> 05:55:12.850]  in flux will change the way that things
[05:55:12.850 --> 05:55:14.850]  become available. It's not just
[05:55:14.850 --> 05:55:16.850]  you know typically in cannabis
[05:55:16.850 --> 05:55:18.850]  we're taught that something
[05:55:18.850 --> 05:55:20.850]  is available between this and this
[05:55:20.850 --> 05:55:22.850]  range and we have a chart but it doesn't
[05:55:22.850 --> 05:55:24.850]  exactly work just like
[05:55:24.850 --> 05:55:26.850]  that because what we have are
[05:55:26.850 --> 05:55:28.850]  oxidation and redox
[05:55:28.850 --> 05:55:30.850]  mechanics
[05:55:30.850 --> 05:55:32.850]  of chemistry that are taking place
[05:55:32.850 --> 05:55:34.850]  and so a lot of
[05:55:34.850 --> 05:55:36.850]  things that
[05:55:36.850 --> 05:55:38.850]  should be sufficiently
[05:55:38.850 --> 05:55:40.850]  that should be sufficient
[05:55:40.850 --> 05:55:42.850]  and I'll give you an example
[05:55:42.850 --> 05:55:44.850]  like iron. Iron is
[05:55:44.850 --> 05:55:46.850]  a really tricky mineral
[05:55:46.850 --> 05:55:48.850]  in these types of systems because
[05:55:48.850 --> 05:55:50.850]  it oxidizes so easily into
[05:55:50.850 --> 05:55:52.850]  an unavailable form that it's not always sufficient
[05:55:52.850 --> 05:55:54.850]  even if you're adding it. So
[05:55:54.850 --> 05:55:56.850]  using the tricks that mother nature
[05:55:56.850 --> 05:55:58.850]  gives us to be able to
[05:55:58.850 --> 05:56:00.850]  chelate that into a form where
[05:56:00.850 --> 05:56:02.850]  it's going to stay in that chemical
[05:56:02.850 --> 05:56:04.850]  form so it's biologically available
[05:56:04.850 --> 05:56:06.850]  and those are some of the tricks that we've taken
[05:56:06.850 --> 05:56:08.850]  from nature and taken from these
[05:56:08.850 --> 05:56:10.850]  other practices to
[05:56:10.850 --> 05:56:12.850]  make these
[05:56:12.850 --> 05:56:14.850]  other chemicals biologically
[05:56:14.850 --> 05:56:16.850]  more available or to keep them in a
[05:56:16.850 --> 05:56:18.850]  biologically available form.
[05:56:18.850 --> 05:56:20.850]  You know one of the things when I
[05:56:20.850 --> 05:56:22.850]  talk about
[05:56:22.850 --> 05:56:24.850]  microorganisms
[05:56:24.850 --> 05:56:26.850]  a lot of times I'll refer
[05:56:26.850 --> 05:56:28.850]  to the micro plus consortium or
[05:56:28.850 --> 05:56:30.850]  EM, effective microorganisms
[05:56:30.850 --> 05:56:32.850]  which is a sub species of
[05:56:32.850 --> 05:56:34.850]  bacillus around pseudomonas which is
[05:56:34.850 --> 05:56:36.850]  a purple known sulfur bacteria
[05:56:36.850 --> 05:56:38.850]  and a fermented yeast.
[05:56:38.850 --> 05:56:40.850]  They work really really well
[05:56:40.850 --> 05:56:42.850]  and they have different types of
[05:56:42.850 --> 05:56:44.850]  mechanisms
[05:56:44.850 --> 05:56:46.850]  that they offer to these systems.
[05:56:46.850 --> 05:56:48.850]  Now
[05:56:48.850 --> 05:56:50.850]  science has shown repeatedly
[05:56:50.850 --> 05:56:52.850]  over and over that they have
[05:56:52.850 --> 05:56:54.850]  a pathogen suppressing
[05:56:54.850 --> 05:56:56.850]  ability which
[05:56:56.850 --> 05:56:58.850]  they are able to operate in a
[05:56:58.850 --> 05:57:00.850]  lot of different pH range and also
[05:57:00.850 --> 05:57:02.850]  in a lot of different
[05:57:02.850 --> 05:57:04.850]  oxygen range.
[05:57:04.850 --> 05:57:06.850]  So they're foculative anaerobes.
[05:57:06.850 --> 05:57:08.850]  They can function fine
[05:57:08.850 --> 05:57:10.850]  in low oxygen conditions and
[05:57:10.850 --> 05:57:12.850]  high oxygen conditions. So that gives them
[05:57:12.850 --> 05:57:14.850]  a competitive advantage over a lot of
[05:57:14.850 --> 05:57:16.850]  the types of things that would be negative and
[05:57:16.850 --> 05:57:18.850]  give negative pressure on your plant as far
[05:57:18.850 --> 05:57:20.850]  as pathogens go. They also work
[05:57:20.850 --> 05:57:22.850]  really well because they're creating chemical
[05:57:22.850 --> 05:57:24.850]  compounds just like
[05:57:24.850 --> 05:57:26.850]  plants do. And these metabolites
[05:57:26.850 --> 05:57:28.850]  that they produce
[05:57:28.850 --> 05:57:30.850]  can be enzymes or
[05:57:30.850 --> 05:57:32.850]  organic acids that can be things
[05:57:32.850 --> 05:57:34.850]  that can chelate or make
[05:57:34.850 --> 05:57:36.850]  other minerals more available.
[05:57:36.850 --> 05:57:38.850]  They can
[05:57:38.850 --> 05:57:40.850]  be an organic acid that's going to
[05:57:40.850 --> 05:57:42.850]  solubilize
[05:57:42.850 --> 05:57:44.850]  mineral
[05:57:44.850 --> 05:57:46.850]  into an available form.
[05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:48.850]  We see high
[05:57:48.850 --> 05:57:50.850]  solubility in phosphorus
[05:57:50.850 --> 05:57:52.850]  using
[05:57:52.850 --> 05:57:54.850]  biology. That's one of the ways that
[05:57:54.850 --> 05:57:56.850]  phosphate is
[05:57:56.850 --> 05:57:58.850]  available. It's released from mineral phosphorus
[05:57:58.850 --> 05:58:00.850]  that's in soil.
[05:58:00.850 --> 05:58:02.850]  If you're not using
[05:58:02.850 --> 05:58:04.850]  a chemical source
[05:58:04.850 --> 05:58:06.850]  usually you're using something
[05:58:06.850 --> 05:58:08.850]  like a soft rock phosphate
[05:58:08.850 --> 05:58:10.850]  or maybe
[05:58:10.850 --> 05:58:12.850]  like a high phosphoanil.
[05:58:12.850 --> 05:58:14.850]  But the
[05:58:14.850 --> 05:58:16.850]  amount that you need
[05:58:16.850 --> 05:58:18.850]  to get to the plant
[05:58:18.850 --> 05:58:20.850]  is always going to be
[05:58:20.850 --> 05:58:22.850]  better
[05:58:22.850 --> 05:58:24.850]  when you have the biology
[05:58:24.850 --> 05:58:26.850]  to release that into the
[05:58:26.850 --> 05:58:28.850]  form that's available to
[05:58:28.850 --> 05:58:30.850]  the plant. Because the plant can only use up
[05:58:30.850 --> 05:58:32.850]  certain mineral elements.
[05:58:32.850 --> 05:58:34.850]  They exist
[05:58:34.850 --> 05:58:36.850]  in so many different forms a lot of
[05:58:36.850 --> 05:58:38.850]  time in these soils. That's
[05:58:38.850 --> 05:58:40.850]  part of the job of the plant.
[05:58:40.850 --> 05:58:42.850]  It will release a lot of things like photosynthates
[05:58:42.850 --> 05:58:44.850]  and different types of
[05:58:44.850 --> 05:58:46.850]  exudates that have
[05:58:46.850 --> 05:58:48.850]  specific functions in those soils.
[05:58:48.850 --> 05:58:50.850]  With the science,
[05:58:50.850 --> 05:58:52.850]  it goes even further than just
[05:58:52.850 --> 05:58:54.850]  doing the soil data
[05:58:54.850 --> 05:58:56.850]  and seeing what's in the tissue and seeing
[05:58:56.850 --> 05:58:58.850]  how the sap
[05:58:58.850 --> 05:59:00.850]  and how everything is being translocated.
[05:59:00.850 --> 05:59:02.850]  But there's new
[05:59:02.850 --> 05:59:04.850]  testing being done to see if there's
[05:59:04.850 --> 05:59:06.850]  actual connections with
[05:59:06.850 --> 05:59:08.850]  something like a mycorrhizae
[05:59:08.850 --> 05:59:10.850]  fungi to see if
[05:59:10.850 --> 05:59:12.850]  those connections are actually being made
[05:59:12.850 --> 05:59:14.850]  in the root systems. There's now testing
[05:59:14.850 --> 05:59:16.850]  being done to see what types
[05:59:16.850 --> 05:59:18.850]  of
[05:59:18.850 --> 05:59:20.850]  chemical compounds are being
[05:59:20.850 --> 05:59:22.850]  released by these organisms
[05:59:22.850 --> 05:59:24.850]  and then we can see what is happening
[05:59:24.850 --> 05:59:26.850]  on a chemical level.
[05:59:26.850 --> 05:59:28.850]  Because all of these things are creating reactions
[05:59:28.850 --> 05:59:30.850]  in the soil. And when you go through
[05:59:30.850 --> 05:59:32.850]  all these different reactions, which biology
[05:59:32.850 --> 05:59:34.850]  does help, but also
[05:59:34.850 --> 05:59:36.850]  having sufficient mineral
[05:59:36.850 --> 05:59:38.850]  nutrition is going to help increase the
[05:59:38.850 --> 05:59:40.850]  biology as well. Because
[05:59:40.850 --> 05:59:42.850]  when we're looking at
[05:59:42.850 --> 05:59:44.850]  the history of how these
[05:59:44.850 --> 05:59:46.850]  things evolved, the microorganisms in these systems,
[05:59:46.850 --> 05:59:48.850]  they co-evolved a lot of times with the plants.
[05:59:48.850 --> 05:59:50.850]  Plants co-evolved with these microbes.
[05:59:50.850 --> 05:59:52.850]  And the way that
[05:59:52.850 --> 05:59:54.850]  a plant sequesters
[05:59:54.850 --> 05:59:56.850]  mineral nutrients or
[05:59:56.850 --> 05:59:58.850]  elements from the earth is similar
[05:59:58.850 --> 06:00:00.850]  to the way that the bacteria and fungi are
[06:00:00.850 --> 06:00:02.850]  doing it as well. They share a very
[06:00:02.850 --> 06:00:04.850]  common relation
[06:00:04.850 --> 06:00:06.850]  in that aspect.
[06:00:06.850 --> 06:00:08.850]  So, you know, you want to
[06:00:08.850 --> 06:00:10.850]  have proper mineral nutrition
[06:00:10.850 --> 06:00:12.850]  as well. We know that
[06:00:12.850 --> 06:00:14.850]  you can't always
[06:00:14.850 --> 06:00:16.850]  control the specific
[06:00:16.850 --> 06:00:18.850]  organisms that are in these systems
[06:00:18.850 --> 06:00:20.850]  unless you're like,
[06:00:20.850 --> 06:00:22.850]  okay, I have this
[06:00:22.850 --> 06:00:24.850]  strain of Bacillus
[06:00:24.850 --> 06:00:26.850]  bacterialis. This science has shown
[06:00:26.850 --> 06:00:28.850]  that this can suppress pathogens because it's an
[06:00:28.850 --> 06:00:30.850]  endocytic microorganism. It can go
[06:00:30.850 --> 06:00:32.850]  into the plant tissue. If
[06:00:32.850 --> 06:00:34.850]  you know you have something, you
[06:00:34.850 --> 06:00:36.850]  can use that continually as
[06:00:36.850 --> 06:00:38.850]  let's say a biocontrol agent.
[06:00:38.850 --> 06:00:40.850]  So
[06:00:40.850 --> 06:00:42.850]  there's a lot of different aspects, I think,
[06:00:42.850 --> 06:00:44.850]  to scaling the organic side
[06:00:44.850 --> 06:00:46.850]  and understanding the science
[06:00:46.850 --> 06:00:48.850]  but also understanding too that
[06:00:48.850 --> 06:00:50.850]  when
[06:00:50.850 --> 06:00:52.850]  it comes to
[06:00:52.850 --> 06:00:54.850]  trying to
[06:00:54.850 --> 06:00:56.850]  keep your overhead
[06:00:56.850 --> 06:00:58.850]  inexpensive, that's
[06:00:58.850 --> 06:01:00.850]  one of the reasons why I originally
[06:01:00.850 --> 06:01:02.850]  started cultivating organically.
[06:01:02.850 --> 06:01:04.850]  Let me just back up
[06:01:04.850 --> 06:01:06.850]  for a second. I grew
[06:01:06.850 --> 06:01:08.850]  in hydroponic systems
[06:01:08.850 --> 06:01:10.850]  for I want to
[06:01:10.850 --> 06:01:12.850]  say about nine years
[06:01:12.850 --> 06:01:14.850]  and then I switched over to soil and was still doing
[06:01:14.850 --> 06:01:16.850]  fertigation salts but in
[06:01:16.850 --> 06:01:18.850]  California where I lived in San
[06:01:18.850 --> 06:01:20.850]  Diego, the prices started to drop
[06:01:20.850 --> 06:01:22.850]  in 2013-2014
[06:01:22.850 --> 06:01:24.850]  and so
[06:01:24.850 --> 06:01:26.850]  you had to figure
[06:01:26.850 --> 06:01:28.850]  out how to decrease your overhead because
[06:01:28.850 --> 06:01:30.850]  that's where your profit lies.
[06:01:30.850 --> 06:01:32.850]  And so I had to kind of
[06:01:32.850 --> 06:01:34.850]  relearn what I was doing and I
[06:01:34.850 --> 06:01:36.850]  stepped into the organics and what it started
[06:01:36.850 --> 06:01:38.850]  with was looking at what I was already using.
[06:01:38.850 --> 06:01:40.850]  If you're using something like
[06:01:40.850 --> 06:01:42.850]  house
[06:01:42.850 --> 06:01:44.850]  and garden, which was the last nutrient
[06:01:44.850 --> 06:01:46.850]  line that I used, I was using 11
[06:01:46.850 --> 06:01:48.850]  different bottles
[06:01:48.850 --> 06:01:50.850]  and it was overwhelming because
[06:01:50.850 --> 06:01:52.850]  there was this huge schedule and it was complicated.
[06:01:52.850 --> 06:01:54.850]  When I started to understand
[06:01:54.850 --> 06:01:56.850]  what was in those bottles, I realized
[06:01:56.850 --> 06:01:58.850]  that I could literally go and buy
[06:01:58.850 --> 06:02:00.850]  these things in bulk for probably like
[06:02:00.850 --> 06:02:02.850]  $15 for a 50
[06:02:02.850 --> 06:02:04.850]  pound bag. You know,
[06:02:04.850 --> 06:02:06.850]  Lampionite, Sulco bag,
[06:02:06.850 --> 06:02:08.850]  stuff like that is very inexpensive.
[06:02:08.850 --> 06:02:10.850]  Magnesium sulfate, potassium
[06:02:10.850 --> 06:02:12.850]  sulfate, a lot of these things
[06:02:12.850 --> 06:02:14.850]  that are in these are
[06:02:14.850 --> 06:02:16.850]  just mixed with water and then
[06:02:16.850 --> 06:02:18.850]  I found out unsuspecting
[06:02:18.850 --> 06:02:20.850]  people and I was one of those people
[06:02:20.850 --> 06:02:22.850]  for a really, really long time.
[06:02:22.850 --> 06:02:24.850]  You know, and it's not
[06:02:24.850 --> 06:02:26.850]  by any means like
[06:02:26.850 --> 06:02:28.850]  my own fault or anybody else's
[06:02:28.850 --> 06:02:30.850]  fault, but for so long that's
[06:02:30.850 --> 06:02:32.850]  how it was advertised that
[06:02:32.850 --> 06:02:34.850]  you cultivate cannabis.
[06:02:34.850 --> 06:02:36.850]  I mean, if you looked at
[06:02:36.850 --> 06:02:38.850]  the high times magazines
[06:02:38.850 --> 06:02:40.850]  from when I started this, there
[06:02:40.850 --> 06:02:42.850]  wasn't like,
[06:02:42.850 --> 06:02:44.850]  you know, oh, get this
[06:02:44.850 --> 06:02:46.850]  plant living soil, get this
[06:02:46.850 --> 06:02:48.850]  modified growing mix,
[06:02:48.850 --> 06:02:50.850]  get these microbes. It's
[06:02:50.850 --> 06:02:52.850]  taken, you know, people
[06:02:52.850 --> 06:02:54.850]  that were, you know, doing
[06:02:54.850 --> 06:02:56.850]  the agronomy work and
[06:02:56.850 --> 06:02:58.850]  soil field science and then having
[06:02:58.850 --> 06:03:00.850]  those types
[06:03:00.850 --> 06:03:02.850]  of principles applied
[06:03:02.850 --> 06:03:04.850]  to these new
[06:03:04.850 --> 06:03:06.850]  modified growing mixes
[06:03:06.850 --> 06:03:08.850]  and what I'm seeing
[06:03:08.850 --> 06:03:10.850]  by collecting data
[06:03:10.850 --> 06:03:12.850]  and I'll still be learning, I'm going to
[06:03:12.850 --> 06:03:14.850]  keep doing this, you know,
[06:03:14.850 --> 06:03:16.850]  as long as I keep mineral
[06:03:16.850 --> 06:03:18.850]  sufficiency and I keep the
[06:03:18.850 --> 06:03:20.850]  cation exchange,
[06:03:20.850 --> 06:03:22.850]  the main cations
[06:03:22.850 --> 06:03:24.850]  which are calcium,
[06:03:24.850 --> 06:03:26.850]  magnesium, potassium, and
[06:03:26.850 --> 06:03:28.850]  then also, we also have sodium,
[06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:30.850]  but sodium is,
[06:03:30.850 --> 06:03:32.850]  you want to keep that as low as possible.
[06:03:32.850 --> 06:03:34.850]  It's very antagonistic, but
[06:03:34.850 --> 06:03:36.850]  you want to keep your cations
[06:03:36.850 --> 06:03:38.850]  balanced and as long
[06:03:38.850 --> 06:03:40.850]  as you do that, you're going
[06:03:40.850 --> 06:03:42.850]  to have a pretty overall
[06:03:42.850 --> 06:03:44.850]  healthy crop as long as
[06:03:44.850 --> 06:03:46.850]  you can maintain that
[06:03:46.850 --> 06:03:48.850]  sufficiency and that balance
[06:03:48.850 --> 06:03:50.850]  throughout the whole thing. Not only
[06:03:50.850 --> 06:03:52.850]  that, but just like
[06:03:52.850 --> 06:03:54.850]  the care that somebody would take on a
[06:03:54.850 --> 06:03:56.850]  smaller grow, because we don't know that
[06:03:56.850 --> 06:03:58.850]  when you scale, it takes
[06:03:58.850 --> 06:04:00.850]  more work, right? It takes a
[06:04:00.850 --> 06:04:02.850]  larger team, it takes more
[06:04:02.850 --> 06:04:04.850]  time for someone who knows
[06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:06.850]  what they're doing to educate people
[06:04:06.850 --> 06:04:08.850]  to make sure things are done right and
[06:04:08.850 --> 06:04:10.850]  you know,
[06:04:10.850 --> 06:04:12.850]  you want to do it the exact
[06:04:12.850 --> 06:04:14.850]  same way when you scale. You want to go
[06:04:14.850 --> 06:04:16.850]  in there and you want to prune things back.
[06:04:16.850 --> 06:04:18.850]  You want to go in there and do your
[06:04:18.850 --> 06:04:20.850]  integrated pest management stuff. You want
[06:04:20.850 --> 06:04:22.850]  to do your foiler sprays. You want to
[06:04:22.850 --> 06:04:24.850]  make sure that you're doing
[06:04:24.850 --> 06:04:26.850]  all of your, you know,
[06:04:26.850 --> 06:04:28.850]  your biological root trenches.
[06:04:28.850 --> 06:04:30.850]  All of those things are really
[06:04:30.850 --> 06:04:32.850]  important in the aspect
[06:04:32.850 --> 06:04:34.850]  for commercial production,
[06:04:34.850 --> 06:04:36.850]  because, you know,
[06:04:36.850 --> 06:04:38.850]  if we take the
[06:04:38.850 --> 06:04:40.850]  initiative as people
[06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:42.850]  here in Oklahoma to do
[06:04:42.850 --> 06:04:44.850]  these types of systems and to cultivate
[06:04:44.850 --> 06:04:46.850]  this type of way,
[06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:48.850]  we get to show the rest of the world
[06:04:48.850 --> 06:04:50.850]  that's looking at us,
[06:04:50.850 --> 06:04:52.850]  at what we're doing, and say, hey, look,
[06:04:52.850 --> 06:04:54.850]  we can
[06:04:54.850 --> 06:04:56.850]  have a bottom line,
[06:04:56.850 --> 06:04:58.850]  you know, less expense
[06:04:58.850 --> 06:05:00.850]  on your inputs, on your
[06:05:00.850 --> 06:05:02.850]  overhead, by being able to
[06:05:02.850 --> 06:05:04.850]  cultivate a certain
[06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:06.850]  way. You know, again,
[06:05:06.850 --> 06:05:08.850]  the whole reason I got into organic
[06:05:08.850 --> 06:05:10.850]  cultivation was because
[06:05:10.850 --> 06:05:12.850]  I needed to figure out how to do things cheaper.
[06:05:12.850 --> 06:05:14.850]  And it ended up,
[06:05:14.850 --> 06:05:16.850]  you know, changing
[06:05:16.850 --> 06:05:18.850]  my perspective, because I didn't grow my
[06:05:18.850 --> 06:05:20.850]  own food until after I started growing
[06:05:20.850 --> 06:05:22.850]  organic cannabis. And when I started
[06:05:22.850 --> 06:05:24.850]  growing my own food, it was like, now
[06:05:24.850 --> 06:05:26.850]  if I can grow my own food, I will.
[06:05:26.850 --> 06:05:28.850]  You know, and now, ever
[06:05:28.850 --> 06:05:30.850]  since, the goal's been, oh, I have to
[06:05:30.850 --> 06:05:32.850]  find a place to where I can
[06:05:32.850 --> 06:05:34.850]  cultivate my own food as well.
[06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:36.850]  Because the bottom line is,
[06:05:36.850 --> 06:05:38.850]  you know, all of us
[06:05:38.850 --> 06:05:40.850]  here, as we get involved,
[06:05:40.850 --> 06:05:42.850]  as new states open up,
[06:05:42.850 --> 06:05:44.850]  if we can showcase
[06:05:44.850 --> 06:05:46.850]  organic production
[06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:48.850]  on a high dollar value crop,
[06:05:48.850 --> 06:05:50.850]  we want to see that translate into
[06:05:50.850 --> 06:05:52.850]  the way all of agriculture is produced.
[06:05:52.850 --> 06:05:54.850]  Because
[06:05:54.850 --> 06:05:56.850]  the base of health
[06:05:56.850 --> 06:05:58.850]  is nutrition. Just like
[06:05:58.850 --> 06:06:00.850]  the base of health in my plants that
[06:06:00.850 --> 06:06:02.850]  everybody sees on IG, how
[06:06:02.850 --> 06:06:04.850]  they're green and everything looks beautiful.
[06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:06.850]  And don't get me wrong, we have problems. There's things
[06:06:06.850 --> 06:06:08.850]  that you can't control, you know, but it's all
[06:06:08.850 --> 06:06:10.850]  about just making sure
[06:06:10.850 --> 06:06:12.850]  that you do things properly.
[06:06:12.850 --> 06:06:14.850]  You know? And
[06:06:14.850 --> 06:06:16.850]  it's going to translate over, eventually,
[06:06:16.850 --> 06:06:18.850]  into mainstream
[06:06:18.850 --> 06:06:20.850]  agriculture, where we can,
[06:06:20.850 --> 06:06:22.850]  you know, it's going to be really difficult
[06:06:22.850 --> 06:06:24.850]  to take a thousand acre farm
[06:06:24.850 --> 06:06:26.850]  and turn it into a permaculture
[06:06:26.850 --> 06:06:28.850]  farm, right? It will take
[06:06:28.850 --> 06:06:30.850]  a lot of time, years. I mean, I don't know if you guys
[06:06:30.850 --> 06:06:32.850]  are familiar with the documentary
[06:06:32.850 --> 06:06:34.850]  Biggest Little Farm, but they take a
[06:06:34.850 --> 06:06:36.850]  200 acre dead
[06:06:36.850 --> 06:06:38.850]  plot of land and it takes them
[06:06:38.850 --> 06:06:40.850]  five years to actually build up
[06:06:40.850 --> 06:06:42.850]  that ecosystem. So it's no small
[06:06:42.850 --> 06:06:44.850]  task. It is a massive
[06:06:44.850 --> 06:06:46.850]  undertaking to create
[06:06:46.850 --> 06:06:48.850]  homoerotic spaces
[06:06:48.850 --> 06:06:50.850]  in an outdoor agronomic
[06:06:50.850 --> 06:06:52.850]  setting. And it takes a lot
[06:06:52.850 --> 06:06:54.850]  of manpower, right?
[06:06:54.850 --> 06:06:56.850]  If we can translate,
[06:06:56.850 --> 06:06:58.850]  you know, the way
[06:06:58.850 --> 06:07:00.850]  that kind of that
[06:07:00.850 --> 06:07:02.850]  I'm doing things, where we're taking organic
[06:07:02.850 --> 06:07:04.850]  mineral inputs and we don't have
[06:07:04.850 --> 06:07:06.850]  to use as much, but we build
[06:07:06.850 --> 06:07:08.850]  up these soil systems
[06:07:08.850 --> 06:07:10.850]  to get them to where they need to be
[06:07:10.850 --> 06:07:12.850]  and then we're just focusing on
[06:07:12.850 --> 06:07:14.850]  balance. How do we maintain this
[06:07:14.850 --> 06:07:16.850]  balance? And a lot of times, you
[06:07:16.850 --> 06:07:18.850]  know, when I'm talking about
[06:07:18.850 --> 06:07:20.850]  top dressing and using mineral amendments,
[06:07:20.850 --> 06:07:22.850]  people are a lot of
[06:07:22.850 --> 06:07:24.850]  times, they're pretty, you know,
[06:07:24.850 --> 06:07:26.850]  taken back on the amounts
[06:07:26.850 --> 06:07:28.850]  that are actually needed because
[06:07:28.850 --> 06:07:30.850]  you don't need a lot. It just needs
[06:07:30.850 --> 06:07:32.850]  to be balanced. If you look at the PPMs
[06:07:32.850 --> 06:07:34.850]  on the soluble
[06:07:34.850 --> 06:07:36.850]  salts on a saturated paste test
[06:07:36.850 --> 06:07:38.850]  for my soils, it typically doesn't go
[06:07:38.850 --> 06:07:40.850]  over 1200 PPM at the highest
[06:07:40.850 --> 06:07:42.850]  levels. And if
[06:07:42.850 --> 06:07:44.850]  you're talking about that on hydro,
[06:07:44.850 --> 06:07:46.850]  you know, there's guys who
[06:07:46.850 --> 06:07:48.850]  go twice that much, you know,
[06:07:48.850 --> 06:07:50.850]  and it's on a lot of
[06:07:50.850 --> 06:07:52.850]  times plants that are not even half
[06:07:52.850 --> 06:07:54.850]  the size as what's
[06:07:54.850 --> 06:07:56.850]  in these living soil systems. So
[06:07:56.850 --> 06:07:58.850]  they're pushing them so, so
[06:07:58.850 --> 06:08:00.850]  hard for production value, but
[06:08:00.850 --> 06:08:02.850]  they're missing that balance
[06:08:02.850 --> 06:08:04.850]  to where they can get all the
[06:08:04.850 --> 06:08:06.850]  sufficient mineral nutrition that they need.
[06:08:06.850 --> 06:08:08.850]  I see a lot of, even in
[06:08:08.850 --> 06:08:10.850]  the way that I cultivate, the
[06:08:10.850 --> 06:08:12.850]  reason why I do the constant
[06:08:12.850 --> 06:08:14.850]  data collection is because it's
[06:08:14.850 --> 06:08:16.850]  not always perfect. When I take these
[06:08:16.850 --> 06:08:18.850]  tests, it's a snapshot in time
[06:08:18.850 --> 06:08:20.850]  of what's going on. So I can
[06:08:20.850 --> 06:08:22.850]  see what's happening, but with that snapshot
[06:08:22.850 --> 06:08:24.850]  I'm able to look
[06:08:24.850 --> 06:08:26.850]  and say, okay, well,
[06:08:26.850 --> 06:08:28.850]  this is what I need to do now
[06:08:28.850 --> 06:08:30.850]  to make... Let me give you
[06:08:30.850 --> 06:08:32.850]  an example. My last sap test,
[06:08:32.850 --> 06:08:34.850]  everything was very sufficient.
[06:08:34.850 --> 06:08:36.850]  It looked like
[06:08:36.850 --> 06:08:38.850]  everything in the new growth was
[06:08:38.850 --> 06:08:40.850]  actually higher than the old growth, which means that
[06:08:40.850 --> 06:08:42.850]  it
[06:08:42.850 --> 06:08:44.850]  was...
[06:08:44.850 --> 06:08:46.850]  it wasn't pulling
[06:08:46.850 --> 06:08:48.850]  from the lowers, which is a good sign,
[06:08:48.850 --> 06:08:50.850]  but I had things like iron
[06:08:50.850 --> 06:08:52.850]  and copper, which were really low on sap.
[06:08:52.850 --> 06:08:54.850]  Now, even though my
[06:08:54.850 --> 06:08:56.850]  tests will show that I have a sufficient amount
[06:08:56.850 --> 06:08:58.850]  and my plants look really, really
[06:08:58.850 --> 06:09:00.850]  healthy, I know
[06:09:00.850 --> 06:09:02.850]  that if I add
[06:09:02.850 --> 06:09:04.850]  more of these two chemical
[06:09:04.850 --> 06:09:06.850]  compounds, I'm going to
[06:09:06.850 --> 06:09:08.850]  be... I'm going to better be able to express
[06:09:08.850 --> 06:09:10.850]  the genetic potential of that plant because
[06:09:10.850 --> 06:09:12.850]  it's going to have the sufficient mineral
[06:09:12.850 --> 06:09:14.850]  needs that it has
[06:09:14.850 --> 06:09:16.850]  available where it actually
[06:09:16.850 --> 06:09:18.850]  needs it. So, just because my soil
[06:09:18.850 --> 06:09:20.850]  and my saturated paste says I might be
[06:09:20.850 --> 06:09:22.850]  sufficient, it's being
[06:09:22.850 --> 06:09:24.850]  able to look further
[06:09:24.850 --> 06:09:26.850]  with the data that I can
[06:09:26.850 --> 06:09:28.850]  correct anything that might
[06:09:28.850 --> 06:09:30.850]  be low. And when I do things like that,
[06:09:30.850 --> 06:09:32.850]  I can do something
[06:09:32.850 --> 06:09:34.850]  like a foiler.
[06:09:34.850 --> 06:09:36.850]  Again, bringing me back to iron, I'm really
[06:09:36.850 --> 06:09:38.850]  kind of, at this point in my
[06:09:38.850 --> 06:09:40.850]  growing, I'm focusing on iron and copper
[06:09:40.850 --> 06:09:42.850]  right now because they're two elements
[06:09:42.850 --> 06:09:44.850]  that seem to...
[06:09:44.850 --> 06:09:46.850]  that seem
[06:09:46.850 --> 06:09:48.850]  to always be low.
[06:09:48.850 --> 06:09:50.850]  And
[06:09:50.850 --> 06:09:52.850]  I understand why iron is
[06:09:52.850 --> 06:09:54.850]  because it oxidizes
[06:09:54.850 --> 06:09:56.850]  so easily into an
[06:09:56.850 --> 06:09:58.850]  unavailable form.
[06:09:58.850 --> 06:10:00.850]  So I started doing, you know,
[06:10:00.850 --> 06:10:02.850]  foiler applications. And that's one way
[06:10:02.850 --> 06:10:04.850]  that you can improve the nutritional
[06:10:04.850 --> 06:10:06.850]  content
[06:10:06.850 --> 06:10:08.850]  of a mineral that is
[06:10:08.850 --> 06:10:10.850]  maybe not deficient, but that you need
[06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:12.850]  more of. You know, because when I'm looking at these things,
[06:10:12.850 --> 06:10:14.850]  as long as I'm maintaining
[06:10:14.850 --> 06:10:16.850]  target levels in soil, I'm not
[06:10:16.850 --> 06:10:18.850]  ever going to be like... express
[06:10:18.850 --> 06:10:20.850]  physical symptoms
[06:10:20.850 --> 06:10:22.850]  of deficiencies.
[06:10:22.850 --> 06:10:24.850]  But that's... but, you know,
[06:10:24.850 --> 06:10:26.850]  I can see that it's low and could use
[06:10:26.850 --> 06:10:28.850]  more. You know, and I don't want to run out
[06:10:28.850 --> 06:10:30.850]  of something like iron, which is a photosynthetic
[06:10:30.850 --> 06:10:32.850]  chemical. You can't create chlorophyll
[06:10:32.850 --> 06:10:34.850]  without it. You know, it's one
[06:10:34.850 --> 06:10:36.850]  of the... one of the five photosynthetic
[06:10:36.850 --> 06:10:38.850]  chemicals that are responsible for
[06:10:38.850 --> 06:10:40.850]  photosynthesis. So,
[06:10:40.850 --> 06:10:42.850]  you know,
[06:10:42.850 --> 06:10:44.850]  using the select biology
[06:10:44.850 --> 06:10:46.850]  really helps. I found out that
[06:10:46.850 --> 06:10:48.850]  you know,
[06:10:48.850 --> 06:10:50.850]  going through a lot of the different
[06:10:50.850 --> 06:10:52.850]  science can be
[06:10:52.850 --> 06:10:54.850]  a task in its own and really, really
[06:10:54.850 --> 06:10:56.850]  time consuming. But what's...
[06:10:56.850 --> 06:10:58.850]  what can be
[06:10:58.850 --> 06:11:00.850]  even harder is trying to
[06:11:00.850 --> 06:11:02.850]  take science and trying
[06:11:02.850 --> 06:11:04.850]  to apply that in these systems. So
[06:11:04.850 --> 06:11:06.850]  being able to take the
[06:11:06.850 --> 06:11:08.850]  science that's being presented,
[06:11:08.850 --> 06:11:10.850]  this does this, this, this, and this
[06:11:10.850 --> 06:11:12.850]  equals this,
[06:11:12.850 --> 06:11:14.850]  and then see if that works in this
[06:11:14.850 --> 06:11:16.850]  type of system. So, some
[06:11:16.850 --> 06:11:18.850]  biologicals
[06:11:18.850 --> 06:11:20.850]  have
[06:11:20.850 --> 06:11:22.850]  worked and some haven't. And here's a good example.
[06:11:22.850 --> 06:11:24.850]  You know, there's always a debate about
[06:11:24.850 --> 06:11:26.850]  mycorrhizal fungus and whether
[06:11:26.850 --> 06:11:28.850]  or not it's really beneficial
[06:11:28.850 --> 06:11:30.850]  and, you know, when and where
[06:11:30.850 --> 06:11:32.850]  it's useful. And
[06:11:32.850 --> 06:11:34.850]  what I've noticed in my systems
[06:11:34.850 --> 06:11:36.850]  is because we usually have
[06:11:36.850 --> 06:11:38.850]  you know,
[06:11:38.850 --> 06:11:40.850]  enough phosphorus that
[06:11:40.850 --> 06:11:42.850]  I don't see
[06:11:42.850 --> 06:11:44.850]  any...I don't physically see
[06:11:44.850 --> 06:11:46.850]  a benefit, although, you know,
[06:11:46.850 --> 06:11:48.850]  I would like to test the roots to see
[06:11:48.850 --> 06:11:50.850]  if there's an association. I don't
[06:11:50.850 --> 06:11:52.850]  physically see a benefit. And when you're
[06:11:52.850 --> 06:11:54.850]  talking about scale, if there's...if you
[06:11:54.850 --> 06:11:56.850]  can't weigh a benefit,
[06:11:56.850 --> 06:11:58.850]  then it's just an added cost.
[06:11:58.850 --> 06:12:00.850]  And that's one of
[06:12:00.850 --> 06:12:02.850]  the things that we're looking at,
[06:12:02.850 --> 06:12:04.850]  right? Because
[06:12:04.850 --> 06:12:06.850]  as business owners,
[06:12:06.850 --> 06:12:08.850]  as small entrepreneurs,
[06:12:08.850 --> 06:12:10.850]  all of those things really, really
[06:12:10.850 --> 06:12:12.850]  matter.
[06:12:12.850 --> 06:12:14.850]  So,
[06:12:14.850 --> 06:12:16.850]  you know, I'd like
[06:12:16.850 --> 06:12:18.850]  to open it up and
[06:12:18.850 --> 06:12:20.850]  you know, just kind of free flow, get
[06:12:20.850 --> 06:12:22.850]  questions going because I know I've been doing
[06:12:22.850 --> 06:12:24.850]  this for a long time and I know that people probably have
[06:12:24.850 --> 06:12:26.850]  a lot of questions about different types of
[06:12:26.850 --> 06:12:28.850]  microbes and
[06:12:28.850 --> 06:12:30.850]  you know, just kind of the systems
[06:12:30.850 --> 06:12:32.850]  that I kind of run with the data collection.
[06:12:34.850 --> 06:12:36.850]  So, great talk. I'd like
[06:12:36.850 --> 06:12:38.850]  to say right off the bat,
[06:12:38.850 --> 06:12:40.850]  agree with everything you said
[06:12:40.850 --> 06:12:42.850]  and wanted to ask what
[06:12:42.850 --> 06:12:44.850]  PPMs you like to run your
[06:12:44.850 --> 06:12:46.850]  iron and copper at, both
[06:12:46.850 --> 06:12:48.850]  dry and paste.
[06:12:48.850 --> 06:12:50.850]  Yeah, okay, so what's
[06:12:50.850 --> 06:12:52.850]  interesting about the
[06:12:52.850 --> 06:12:54.850]  way that I do my testing
[06:12:54.850 --> 06:12:56.850]  is one, I use one specific
[06:12:56.850 --> 06:12:58.850]  lab, which is Logan Labs, and they do
[06:12:58.850 --> 06:13:00.850]  a soil test and then they do a
[06:13:00.850 --> 06:13:02.850]  wheat extract...wheat acid
[06:13:02.850 --> 06:13:04.850]  extraction for the saturated
[06:13:04.850 --> 06:13:06.850]  paste test and that basically
[06:13:06.850 --> 06:13:08.850]  is showing, you know, how that
[06:13:08.850 --> 06:13:10.850]  soil will fall into solution, what
[06:13:10.850 --> 06:13:12.850]  minerals will be available and so that's what I'm
[06:13:12.850 --> 06:13:14.850]  looking at to balance.
[06:13:14.850 --> 06:13:16.850]  So iron is surprisingly
[06:13:16.850 --> 06:13:18.850]  low. A sufficient amount of
[06:13:18.850 --> 06:13:20.850]  iron is one PPM.
[06:13:20.850 --> 06:13:22.850]  Okay?
[06:13:22.850 --> 06:13:24.850]  However,
[06:13:24.850 --> 06:13:26.850]  it's hard to get there. It's hard to
[06:13:26.850 --> 06:13:28.850]  get there because of
[06:13:28.850 --> 06:13:30.850]  the chemical
[06:13:30.850 --> 06:13:32.850]  structure of
[06:13:32.850 --> 06:13:34.850]  iron. The way that it's
[06:13:34.850 --> 06:13:36.850]  available is Fe2+,
[06:13:36.850 --> 06:13:38.850]  and that 2+, is
[06:13:38.850 --> 06:13:40.850]  two bonding sites,
[06:13:40.850 --> 06:13:42.850]  two positively charged
[06:13:42.850 --> 06:13:44.850]  cations
[06:13:44.850 --> 06:13:46.850]  that will bond to
[06:13:46.850 --> 06:13:48.850]  oxygen really, really
[06:13:48.850 --> 06:13:50.850]  easily and because
[06:13:50.850 --> 06:13:52.850]  of how oxygen
[06:13:52.850 --> 06:13:54.850]  bonds, the amount of molecules,
[06:13:54.850 --> 06:13:56.850]  they partner up super, super well.
[06:13:56.850 --> 06:13:58.850]  They oxidize in a pH range
[06:13:58.850 --> 06:14:00.850]  that we grow our cannabis
[06:14:00.850 --> 06:14:02.850]  and so it becomes
[06:14:02.850 --> 06:14:04.850]  unavailable even if you're using like
[06:14:04.850 --> 06:14:06.850]  various iron, iron sulfate,
[06:14:06.850 --> 06:14:08.850]  which is something that I use,
[06:14:08.850 --> 06:14:10.850]  it still doesn't seem
[06:14:10.850 --> 06:14:12.850]  to be a sufficient amount
[06:14:12.850 --> 06:14:14.850]  and so being
[06:14:14.850 --> 06:14:16.850]  able to, one, either use a biological
[06:14:16.850 --> 06:14:18.850]  entity such as
[06:14:18.850 --> 06:14:20.850]  trichoderma, which creates
[06:14:20.850 --> 06:14:22.850]  a secondary metabolite called
[06:14:22.850 --> 06:14:24.850]  a
[06:14:24.850 --> 06:14:26.850]  sodiophores, and what they do
[06:14:26.850 --> 06:14:28.850]  is they actually are able
[06:14:28.850 --> 06:14:30.850]  to keep
[06:14:30.850 --> 06:14:32.850]  the iron in a reduced
[06:14:32.850 --> 06:14:34.850]  form and so it becomes
[06:14:34.850 --> 06:14:36.850]  more available biologically to the
[06:14:36.850 --> 06:14:38.850]  plant. Also there's things like
[06:14:38.850 --> 06:14:40.850]  humic folic acids, there's
[06:14:40.850 --> 06:14:42.850]  certain
[06:14:42.850 --> 06:14:44.850]  amino acids or natural chelators
[06:14:44.850 --> 06:14:46.850]  which will help
[06:14:46.850 --> 06:14:48.850]  make those things biologically available.
[06:14:48.850 --> 06:14:50.850]  It's just knowing and understanding
[06:14:50.850 --> 06:14:52.850]  how to apply these,
[06:14:52.850 --> 06:14:54.850]  which is things that I'm working on,
[06:14:54.850 --> 06:14:56.850]  but I need to be able to see
[06:14:56.850 --> 06:14:58.850]  it in the data. I can't just
[06:14:58.850 --> 06:15:00.850]  say, hey, my plant looks good because my plants look
[06:15:00.850 --> 06:15:02.850]  great and my plants don't often not
[06:15:02.850 --> 06:15:04.850]  look great, but I need
[06:15:04.850 --> 06:15:06.850]  to look internally at
[06:15:06.850 --> 06:15:08.850]  the data to say this can
[06:15:08.850 --> 06:15:10.850]  still be improved because when
[06:15:10.850 --> 06:15:12.850]  I'm doing sap testing, I can
[06:15:12.850 --> 06:15:14.850]  see the deficiency before
[06:15:14.850 --> 06:15:16.850]  it will actually manifest
[06:15:16.850 --> 06:15:18.850]  in the plant. If the
[06:15:18.850 --> 06:15:20.850]  plant is pulling all of its nitrogen
[06:15:20.850 --> 06:15:22.850]  from its lowers, it means that there's not
[06:15:22.850 --> 06:15:24.850]  enough nitrogen falling into the solution
[06:15:24.850 --> 06:15:26.850]  so I can correct that before it physically
[06:15:26.850 --> 06:15:28.850]  shows as a symptom.
[06:15:28.850 --> 06:15:30.850]  You'll never see a symptom
[06:15:30.850 --> 06:15:32.850]  of deficiency unless it's
[06:15:32.850 --> 06:15:34.850]  gone past a certain point.
[06:15:36.850 --> 06:15:38.850]  With your 1 ppm
[06:15:38.850 --> 06:15:40.850]  of iron, we'll assume that's
[06:15:40.850 --> 06:15:42.850]  soluble, what's
[06:15:42.850 --> 06:15:44.850]  your optimal that you're looking
[06:15:44.850 --> 06:15:46.850]  for on your Logan dry test?
[06:15:46.850 --> 06:15:48.850]  I would optimally
[06:15:48.850 --> 06:15:50.850]  like to see 1.5.
[06:15:50.850 --> 06:15:52.850]  That's the target range, but
[06:15:52.850 --> 06:15:54.850]  I rarely ever
[06:15:54.850 --> 06:15:56.850]  see that, but it's
[06:15:56.850 --> 06:15:58.850]  one of the reasons too where
[06:15:58.850 --> 06:16:00.850]  I own Bokashi
[06:16:00.850 --> 06:16:02.850]  Earthworks. It's a biofertilizer
[06:16:02.850 --> 06:16:04.850]  company. I specialize in microbial
[06:16:04.850 --> 06:16:06.850]  inoculations.
[06:16:06.850 --> 06:16:08.850]  As I develop
[06:16:08.850 --> 06:16:10.850]  new products, I want
[06:16:10.850 --> 06:16:12.850]  to be able to test and see what I can keep
[06:16:12.850 --> 06:16:14.850]  in solution.
[06:16:14.850 --> 06:16:16.850]  One of the last products,
[06:16:16.850 --> 06:16:18.850]  experiments that I did, it's not a product yet. I haven't
[06:16:18.850 --> 06:16:20.850]  released it, but I took a
[06:16:20.850 --> 06:16:22.850]  Fulvic iron carrier,
[06:16:22.850 --> 06:16:24.850]  a solution that fermented in
[06:16:24.850 --> 06:16:26.850]  the Trichoderma and Bacillus
[06:16:26.850 --> 06:16:28.850]  subtilis, which are both biocontrol
[06:16:28.850 --> 06:16:30.850]  agents. They're also really good at
[06:16:30.850 --> 06:16:32.850]  ... They work synergistically together.
[06:16:32.850 --> 06:16:34.850]  It's a two-part consortium,
[06:16:34.850 --> 06:16:36.850]  but the science shows that
[06:16:36.850 --> 06:16:38.850]  the Bacillus will actually
[06:16:38.850 --> 06:16:40.850]  grow with the Trichoderma
[06:16:40.850 --> 06:16:42.850]  homo-fungal heifet that it produces.
[06:16:42.850 --> 06:16:44.850]  They're both really, really excellent
[06:16:44.850 --> 06:16:46.850]  biocontrol agents, not to mention
[06:16:46.850 --> 06:16:48.850]  the iron chelating capacity
[06:16:48.850 --> 06:16:50.850]  from the sodium force from the
[06:16:50.850 --> 06:16:52.850]  Trichoderma.
[06:16:52.850 --> 06:16:54.850]  What I want to do is I want to create
[06:16:54.850 --> 06:16:56.850]  a spore in solution
[06:16:56.850 --> 06:16:58.850]  in an iron Fulvic
[06:16:58.850 --> 06:17:00.850]  carrier. That way, not only
[06:17:00.850 --> 06:17:02.850]  am I adding the biology
[06:17:02.850 --> 06:17:04.850]  that will actually utilize
[06:17:04.850 --> 06:17:06.850]  that element specifically
[06:17:06.850 --> 06:17:08.850]  at a higher rate than anything else,
[06:17:08.850 --> 06:17:10.850]  when I give it into that system,
[06:17:10.850 --> 06:17:12.850]  I'm giving a chelated form of that iron
[06:17:12.850 --> 06:17:14.850]  along with the biology that it's going to be able to use.
[06:17:14.850 --> 06:17:16.850]  The idea behind that is
[06:17:16.850 --> 06:17:18.850]  because I want to be able to promote
[06:17:18.850 --> 06:17:20.850]  that specific
[06:17:20.850 --> 06:17:22.850]  consortium
[06:17:22.850 --> 06:17:24.850]  for this time being. I want to use this
[06:17:24.850 --> 06:17:26.850]  as a biocontrol agent. I want to use this
[06:17:26.850 --> 06:17:28.850]  to help the plant sequester
[06:17:28.850 --> 06:17:30.850]  more iron. Those are the
[06:17:30.850 --> 06:17:32.850]  modes of thinking. It's trying to take something that
[06:17:32.850 --> 06:17:34.850]  you know what it's going to do and then
[06:17:34.850 --> 06:17:36.850]  inoculating it in the system
[06:17:36.850 --> 06:17:38.850]  at a certain point to try to get an effect
[06:17:38.850 --> 06:17:40.850]  from it.
[06:17:40.850 --> 06:17:42.850]  Fascinating. Makes a lot of sense.
[06:17:42.850 --> 06:17:44.850]  Really great.
[06:17:44.850 --> 06:17:46.850]  On the copper side, what
[06:17:46.850 --> 06:17:48.850]  do you say there?
[06:17:48.850 --> 06:17:50.850]  What I've noticed is
[06:17:50.850 --> 06:17:52.850]  that typically
[06:17:52.850 --> 06:17:54.850]  if
[06:17:54.850 --> 06:17:56.850]  the
[06:17:56.850 --> 06:17:58.850]  copper and zinc
[06:17:58.850 --> 06:18:00.850]  you'll do about 50%
[06:18:00.850 --> 06:18:02.850]  more zinc than copper.
[06:18:02.850 --> 06:18:04.850]  As long as you keep your ratios
[06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:06.850]  and they fall in solution,
[06:18:06.850 --> 06:18:08.850]  they're usually adequate. What I'm seeing
[06:18:08.850 --> 06:18:10.850]  is that if they're not, I'll usually do
[06:18:10.850 --> 06:18:12.850]  a micronutrient spray.
[06:18:12.850 --> 06:18:14.850]  That is
[06:18:14.850 --> 06:18:16.850]  in hopes of correcting any type
[06:18:16.850 --> 06:18:18.850]  of deficiency
[06:18:18.850 --> 06:18:20.850]  that might occur in the future.
[06:18:20.850 --> 06:18:22.850]  I'm usually acting preemptively.
[06:18:22.850 --> 06:18:24.850]  I'm not looking at something and trying to
[06:18:24.850 --> 06:18:26.850]  correct the deficiency. It's just like for
[06:18:26.850 --> 06:18:28.850]  integrated pest management. You guys
[06:18:28.850 --> 06:18:30.850]  don't want to go to war with something.
[06:18:30.850 --> 06:18:32.850]  You want to
[06:18:32.850 --> 06:18:34.850]  take preemptive measurements and then just
[06:18:34.850 --> 06:18:36.850]  maintain through preventative
[06:18:36.850 --> 06:18:38.850]  maintenance. That's the key.
[06:18:38.850 --> 06:18:40.850]  We do so much
[06:18:40.850 --> 06:18:42.850]  for IPM. It's ridiculous.
[06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:48.850]  It's not always going to be 100%
[06:18:48.850 --> 06:18:50.850]  effective too. You have to
[06:18:50.850 --> 06:18:52.850]  make sure that you go in there
[06:18:52.850 --> 06:18:54.850]  and you're taking proper protocols
[06:18:54.850 --> 06:18:56.850]  to make sure that you have
[06:18:56.850 --> 06:18:58.850]  a good product.
[06:18:58.850 --> 06:19:00.850]  With those
[06:19:00.850 --> 06:19:02.850]  trace minerals like that,
[06:19:02.850 --> 06:19:04.850]  a lot of department
[06:19:04.850 --> 06:19:06.850]  of ags are recommending running
[06:19:06.850 --> 06:19:08.850]  things like zinc
[06:19:08.850 --> 06:19:10.850]  at 5-6 ppm.
[06:19:10.850 --> 06:19:12.850]  I'm always
[06:19:12.850 --> 06:19:14.850]  finding a benefit, especially
[06:19:14.850 --> 06:19:16.850]  in hard nuts
[06:19:16.850 --> 06:19:18.850]  running higher, closer
[06:19:18.850 --> 06:19:20.850]  to 17 ppm
[06:19:20.850 --> 06:19:22.850]  with a lot of those, pushing
[06:19:22.850 --> 06:19:24.850]  everything all up together
[06:19:24.850 --> 06:19:26.850]  in ratio a little higher.
[06:19:28.850 --> 06:19:30.850]  In copper, that's one of the
[06:19:30.850 --> 06:19:32.850]  ones that I haven't
[06:19:32.850 --> 06:19:34.850]  had as much time to experiment
[06:19:34.850 --> 06:19:36.850]  with, but where would
[06:19:36.850 --> 06:19:38.850]  you say you like to land
[06:19:38.850 --> 06:19:40.850]  in that copper world?
[06:19:40.850 --> 06:19:42.850]  It's about .6 ppm.
[06:19:42.850 --> 06:19:44.850]  Here's
[06:19:44.850 --> 06:19:46.850]  the thing.
[06:19:48.850 --> 06:19:50.850]  With the testing, if you're
[06:19:50.850 --> 06:19:52.850]  doing a different type of standard of
[06:19:52.850 --> 06:19:54.850]  testing, your results are going to
[06:19:54.850 --> 06:19:56.850]  be different. This is
[06:19:56.850 --> 06:19:58.850]  one of the most complicated parts.
[06:19:58.850 --> 06:20:00.850]  I can really only use
[06:20:00.850 --> 06:20:02.850]  one lab.
[06:20:02.850 --> 06:20:04.850]  I can only use that one lab
[06:20:04.850 --> 06:20:06.850]  for the same thing over and over again
[06:20:06.850 --> 06:20:08.850]  because what happens is the protocols
[06:20:08.850 --> 06:20:10.850]  and the way that they
[06:20:10.850 --> 06:20:12.850]  do their
[06:20:12.850 --> 06:20:14.850]  extractions for saturated paste
[06:20:14.850 --> 06:20:16.850]  can be different.
[06:20:16.850 --> 06:20:18.850]  What I would have to do is
[06:20:18.850 --> 06:20:20.850]  go back to the books, look at the plant
[06:20:20.850 --> 06:20:22.850]  physically, say, hey, I need to create
[06:20:22.850 --> 06:20:24.850]  a new baseline with this new company,
[06:20:24.850 --> 06:20:26.850]  this new lab, find out all these
[06:20:26.850 --> 06:20:28.850]  new target levels, and then build from there.
[06:20:28.850 --> 06:20:30.850]  We do the exact same thing
[06:20:30.850 --> 06:20:32.850]  and in the end we run Logan.
[06:20:32.850 --> 06:20:34.850]  Maybe it's like the nobody gets
[06:20:34.850 --> 06:20:36.850]  fired for using Logan
[06:20:36.850 --> 06:20:38.850]  strategy, but a lot of the
[06:20:38.850 --> 06:20:40.850]  labs
[06:20:40.850 --> 06:20:42.850]  that our state Department of Ag
[06:20:42.850 --> 06:20:44.850]  recommends are really oriented towards
[06:20:44.850 --> 06:20:46.850]  salt and PEM Ag, and
[06:20:46.850 --> 06:20:48.850]  we get wacky results
[06:20:48.850 --> 06:20:50.850]  that don't really
[06:20:50.850 --> 06:20:52.850]  help us with
[06:20:52.850 --> 06:20:54.850]  Albrecht and mineral type thinking.
[06:20:54.850 --> 06:20:56.850]  On the other hand, some of the other labs
[06:20:56.850 --> 06:20:58.850]  that we have had good luck with are
[06:20:58.850 --> 06:21:00.850]  TPSL
[06:21:00.850 --> 06:21:02.850]  and Kinsey, they'll do really
[06:21:02.850 --> 06:21:04.850]  cool recommendations and
[06:21:04.850 --> 06:21:06.850]  stuff like that.
[06:21:06.850 --> 06:21:08.850]  You're talking about for testing the soil
[06:21:08.850 --> 06:21:10.850]  that you guys manufacture and ship out to
[06:21:10.850 --> 06:21:12.850]  a cultivation center. Correct.
[06:21:12.850 --> 06:21:14.850]  And for going into fields at field scale.
[06:21:14.850 --> 06:21:16.850]  I just
[06:21:16.850 --> 06:21:18.850]  started doing something similar with my company
[06:21:18.850 --> 06:21:20.850]  called Costly Earthworks because I know how
[06:21:20.850 --> 06:21:22.850]  to do the agronomy work
[06:21:22.850 --> 06:21:24.850]  for the modified growing systems.
[06:21:24.850 --> 06:21:26.850]  I have the target
[06:21:26.850 --> 06:21:28.850]  levels and when
[06:21:28.850 --> 06:21:30.850]  you look at a lot of the
[06:21:30.850 --> 06:21:32.850]  soils on the market out there, there's a lot of really
[06:21:32.850 --> 06:21:34.850]  good ones. I highly recommend the soil
[06:21:34.850 --> 06:21:36.850]  because organics have great, great
[06:21:36.850 --> 06:21:38.850]  soils that are
[06:21:38.850 --> 06:21:40.850]  really balanced.
[06:21:40.850 --> 06:21:42.850]  For the most part, if you look at most
[06:21:42.850 --> 06:21:44.850]  of the bad soils that are on the market,
[06:21:44.850 --> 06:21:46.850]  they're really
[06:21:46.850 --> 06:21:48.850]  insufficient. It's why Fox Farms
[06:21:48.850 --> 06:21:50.850]  will only get you maybe three weeks in the
[06:21:50.850 --> 06:21:52.850]  bed before you start having
[06:21:52.850 --> 06:21:54.850]  to apply
[06:21:54.850 --> 06:21:56.850]  things to get your plant
[06:21:56.850 --> 06:21:58.850]  to where they need to be.
[06:21:58.850 --> 06:22:00.850]  I think that
[06:22:00.850 --> 06:22:02.850]  the levels of nutrition
[06:22:02.850 --> 06:22:04.850]  are poorly understood at
[06:22:04.850 --> 06:22:06.850]  this point. There's not a lot of people
[06:22:06.850 --> 06:22:08.850]  that
[06:22:08.850 --> 06:22:10.850]  know what they need to be and
[06:22:10.850 --> 06:22:12.850]  I guess how to
[06:22:12.850 --> 06:22:14.850]  keep those levels maintained.
[06:22:14.850 --> 06:22:16.850]  That's
[06:22:16.850 --> 06:22:18.850]  one of the biggest things, being able to
[06:22:18.850 --> 06:22:20.850]  translate
[06:22:20.850 --> 06:22:22.850]  the data into
[06:22:22.850 --> 06:22:24.850]  how much
[06:22:24.850 --> 06:22:26.850]  of what do I need?
[06:22:26.850 --> 06:22:28.850]  That's the biggest
[06:22:28.850 --> 06:22:30.850]  thing
[06:22:30.850 --> 06:22:32.850]  with what I
[06:22:32.850 --> 06:22:34.850]  do. It's knowing, oh, I need to
[06:22:34.850 --> 06:22:36.850]  add
[06:22:36.850 --> 06:22:38.850]  0.2 cups of
[06:22:38.850 --> 06:22:40.850]  molasses tonight
[06:22:40.850 --> 06:22:42.850]  if my pH is at
[06:22:42.850 --> 06:22:44.850]  6.2.
[06:22:44.850 --> 06:22:46.850]  To bring my pH back up to 6.8
[06:22:46.850 --> 06:22:48.850]  where I want it. It's those little
[06:22:48.850 --> 06:22:50.850]  things like that that
[06:22:50.850 --> 06:22:52.850]  really get you there.
[06:22:52.850 --> 06:22:54.850]  I work with
[06:22:54.850 --> 06:22:56.850]  several different companies and that's what I
[06:22:56.850 --> 06:22:58.850]  help them build. I help them
[06:22:58.850 --> 06:23:00.850]  get their soils
[06:23:00.850 --> 06:23:02.850]  to
[06:23:02.850 --> 06:23:04.850]  balanced, sufficient levels
[06:23:04.850 --> 06:23:06.850]  and then when they're able to maintain that
[06:23:06.850 --> 06:23:08.850]  they start working on things like if they
[06:23:08.850 --> 06:23:10.850]  know that they're going to be running ice cream cake,
[06:23:10.850 --> 06:23:12.850]  they can do
[06:23:12.850 --> 06:23:14.850]  and build SOPs and they
[06:23:14.850 --> 06:23:16.850]  can look at what those
[06:23:16.850 --> 06:23:18.850]  are uptaking more of.
[06:23:18.850 --> 06:23:20.850]  For instance,
[06:23:20.850 --> 06:23:22.850]  I did a full round of testing,
[06:23:22.850 --> 06:23:24.850]  two rounds of testing on one of the cultivars
[06:23:24.850 --> 06:23:26.850]  that I have, Death Breath.
[06:23:26.850 --> 06:23:28.850]  I know that it has a lower nitrogen
[06:23:28.850 --> 06:23:30.850]  requirement, it has a lower calcium
[06:23:30.850 --> 06:23:32.850]  requirement, and it has a higher phosphorus
[06:23:32.850 --> 06:23:34.850]  requirement. You can find out
[06:23:34.850 --> 06:23:36.850]  what certain cultivars require
[06:23:36.850 --> 06:23:38.850]  because we all know
[06:23:38.850 --> 06:23:40.850]  as growers that
[06:23:40.850 --> 06:23:42.850]  different plants have different nutritional needs
[06:23:42.850 --> 06:23:44.850]  and some of them will be wacky, completely
[06:23:44.850 --> 06:23:46.850]  unhappy
[06:23:46.850 --> 06:23:48.850]  in some
[06:23:48.850 --> 06:23:50.850]  conditions where other things thrive.
[06:23:50.850 --> 06:23:52.850]  I see it all the time, especially if you're running
[06:23:52.850 --> 06:23:54.850]  a room full of different
[06:23:54.850 --> 06:23:56.850]  cultivars. It can
[06:23:56.850 --> 06:23:58.850]  be tricky to make sure you have
[06:23:58.850 --> 06:24:00.850]  sufficiency across the board.
[06:24:00.850 --> 06:24:02.850]  I think just
[06:24:02.850 --> 06:24:04.850]  being able to look
[06:24:04.850 --> 06:24:06.850]  at those and say, hey, this cultivar
[06:24:06.850 --> 06:24:08.850]  needs this and you can take your target levels
[06:24:08.850 --> 06:24:10.850]  and you can subtract. Okay, this needs
[06:24:10.850 --> 06:24:12.850]  15% less calcium
[06:24:12.850 --> 06:24:14.850]  than this and then you can have those levels
[06:24:14.850 --> 06:24:16.850]  sufficiently to maximize
[06:24:16.850 --> 06:24:18.850]  your production and quality of that product.
[06:24:20.850 --> 06:24:22.850]  Based on what you
[06:24:22.850 --> 06:24:24.850]  just said, so then do you
[06:24:24.850 --> 06:24:26.850]  stick to that same cultivar
[06:24:26.850 --> 06:24:28.850]  in that bed?
[06:24:28.850 --> 06:24:30.850]  You know, once you get that dialed in?
[06:24:30.850 --> 06:24:32.850]  Yeah, so
[06:24:32.850 --> 06:24:34.850]  what I'll typically do is
[06:24:34.850 --> 06:24:36.850]  if I'm
[06:24:36.850 --> 06:24:38.850]  testing to try to see
[06:24:38.850 --> 06:24:40.850]  what a cultivar's
[06:24:40.850 --> 06:24:42.850]  nutritional needs are, I'm just
[06:24:42.850 --> 06:24:44.850]  so I'll do, let's say I
[06:24:44.850 --> 06:24:46.850]  have two greenhouses that are up and operational.
[06:24:46.850 --> 06:24:48.850]  When I want to do an
[06:24:48.850 --> 06:24:50.850]  overall test for house one and house
[06:24:50.850 --> 06:24:52.850]  two, I have four beds.
[06:24:52.850 --> 06:24:54.850]  I'll take a 20 site sample. I'll take
[06:24:54.850 --> 06:24:56.850]  four samples from four different locations
[06:24:56.850 --> 06:24:58.850]  in the bed. I'll homogenize
[06:24:58.850 --> 06:25:00.850]  all of those together and then I'll send the
[06:25:00.850 --> 06:25:02.850]  sample out and that's greenhouse one
[06:25:02.850 --> 06:25:04.850]  because
[06:25:04.850 --> 06:25:06.850]  although those beds aren't going to be
[06:25:06.850 --> 06:25:08.850]  perfectly exact,
[06:25:08.850 --> 06:25:10.850]  it's not cost effective
[06:25:10.850 --> 06:25:12.850]  to go and do
[06:25:12.850 --> 06:25:14.850]  test just this bed and then this
[06:25:14.850 --> 06:25:16.850]  variety. So if I have
[06:25:16.850 --> 06:25:18.850]  an overall view and I started at
[06:25:18.850 --> 06:25:20.850]  the same place, I know
[06:25:20.850 --> 06:25:22.850]  that everything is going to be
[06:25:22.850 --> 06:25:24.850]  everything that I've given it has been the same
[06:25:24.850 --> 06:25:26.850]  overall through that whole house
[06:25:26.850 --> 06:25:28.850]  and so we're going to be really close.
[06:25:28.850 --> 06:25:30.850]  When it comes to these systems, we don't need to be
[06:25:30.850 --> 06:25:32.850]  perfect, right?
[06:25:32.850 --> 06:25:34.850]  But they need to be close.
[06:25:34.850 --> 06:25:36.850]  Go ahead.
[06:25:36.850 --> 06:25:38.850]  Alright, one other thing.
[06:25:38.850 --> 06:25:40.850]  When you're sufficient, do you
[06:25:40.850 --> 06:25:42.850]  ever feel like it's necessary to
[06:25:42.850 --> 06:25:44.850]  just get everything to high
[06:25:44.850 --> 06:25:46.850]  in the values or sufficient
[06:25:46.850 --> 06:25:48.850]  cool? Yeah, no.
[06:25:48.850 --> 06:25:50.850]  That's one of the things that I was looking at
[06:25:50.850 --> 06:25:52.850]  because you can grow really great cannabis
[06:25:52.850 --> 06:25:54.850]  at let's say the PPM of soluble
[06:25:54.850 --> 06:25:56.850]  salts might be 800.
[06:25:56.850 --> 06:25:58.850]  Everything's in balance but it's
[06:25:58.850 --> 06:26:00.850]  not as much but your plant
[06:26:00.850 --> 06:26:02.850]  could handle it because
[06:26:02.850 --> 06:26:04.850]  you have so much biomass, right? These plants
[06:26:04.850 --> 06:26:06.850]  are pretty big. That's one of the
[06:26:06.850 --> 06:26:08.850]  things that I'm, you know,
[06:26:08.850 --> 06:26:10.850]  you can increase the nutrient load
[06:26:10.850 --> 06:26:12.850]  especially when the
[06:26:12.850 --> 06:26:14.850]  plants get bigger.
[06:26:14.850 --> 06:26:16.850]  Again, you just want to make sure
[06:26:16.850 --> 06:26:18.850]  that it's balanced because what I see
[06:26:18.850 --> 06:26:20.850]  typically when I read anybody's tests
[06:26:20.850 --> 06:26:22.850]  a lot of times what happens is their
[06:26:22.850 --> 06:26:24.850]  magnesium levels go
[06:26:24.850 --> 06:26:26.850]  above their potassium and potassium
[06:26:26.850 --> 06:26:28.850]  is the second most
[06:26:28.850 --> 06:26:30.850]  used nutrient
[06:26:30.850 --> 06:26:32.850]  in cannabis in my experience.
[06:26:32.850 --> 06:26:34.850]  Calcium being the first, nitrogen being
[06:26:34.850 --> 06:26:36.850]  the third.
[06:26:36.850 --> 06:26:38.850]  Magnesium is also
[06:26:38.850 --> 06:26:40.850]  antagonistic when that
[06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:42.850]  level goes above
[06:26:42.850 --> 06:26:44.850]  it messes with the
[06:26:44.850 --> 06:26:46.850]  cation balance so it starts antagonizing
[06:26:46.850 --> 06:26:48.850]  calcium as well.
[06:26:48.850 --> 06:26:50.850]  While you might think that you have
[06:26:50.850 --> 06:26:52.850]  a calcium deficiency
[06:26:52.850 --> 06:26:54.850]  you might actually have an abundance of magnesium.
[06:26:54.850 --> 06:26:56.850]  Being able to look
[06:26:56.850 --> 06:26:58.850]  at that data and see
[06:26:58.850 --> 06:27:00.850]  what those ranges are really gives you
[06:27:00.850 --> 06:27:02.850]  and gives me an advantage
[06:27:02.850 --> 06:27:04.850]  because I can physically look at the plant
[06:27:04.850 --> 06:27:06.850]  where before I was like, oh
[06:27:06.850 --> 06:27:08.850]  I think it needs magnesium
[06:27:08.850 --> 06:27:10.850]  but it might have needed
[06:27:10.850 --> 06:27:12.850]  calcium and it might have
[06:27:12.850 --> 06:27:14.850]  needed calcium but you might have actually had
[06:27:14.850 --> 06:27:16.850]  sufficient amount of calcium in
[06:27:16.850 --> 06:27:18.850]  solution. It just wasn't being
[06:27:18.850 --> 06:27:20.850]  available because that magnesium was
[06:27:20.850 --> 06:27:22.850]  pushing it off.
[06:27:22.850 --> 06:27:24.850]  That's why the balance is so important
[06:27:24.850 --> 06:27:26.850]  and that's one of the things
[06:27:26.850 --> 06:27:28.850]  that I see a lot of times in these systems
[06:27:28.850 --> 06:27:30.850]  because people go at it for a long time
[06:27:30.850 --> 06:27:32.850]  it can take a
[06:27:32.850 --> 06:27:34.850]  really long time but you can compile
[06:27:34.850 --> 06:27:36.850]  a problem and here's a
[06:27:36.850 --> 06:27:38.850]  really good example using something like
[06:27:38.850 --> 06:27:40.850]  Langdonite also trade name Sulcomag.
[06:27:40.850 --> 06:27:42.850]  People will use that to try
[06:27:42.850 --> 06:27:44.850]  to make up for a potassium
[06:27:44.850 --> 06:27:46.850]  deficiency but they don't
[06:27:46.850 --> 06:27:48.850]  understand that that chemical
[06:27:48.850 --> 06:27:50.850]  Sulcomag is potassium
[06:27:50.850 --> 06:27:52.850]  magnesium and sulfur
[06:27:52.850 --> 06:27:54.850]  and because
[06:27:54.850 --> 06:27:56.850]  that magnesium is more water
[06:27:56.850 --> 06:27:58.850]  soluble and that magnesium sulfate
[06:27:58.850 --> 06:28:00.850]  in there is more soluble
[06:28:00.850 --> 06:28:02.850]  than the potassium what ends up
[06:28:02.850 --> 06:28:04.850]  happening is you release a
[06:28:04.850 --> 06:28:06.850]  bunch of magnesium into
[06:28:06.850 --> 06:28:08.850]  that system instead
[06:28:08.850 --> 06:28:10.850]  of getting that potassium
[06:28:10.850 --> 06:28:12.850]  that you were after and then you
[06:28:12.850 --> 06:28:14.850]  switch that cation on balance.
[06:28:14.850 --> 06:28:16.850]  So it's
[06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:18.850]  being aware of
[06:28:18.850 --> 06:28:20.850]  what type of inputs you use
[06:28:20.850 --> 06:28:22.850]  really affects the outcome because
[06:28:22.850 --> 06:28:24.850]  and that's one of the reasons why I use single mineral
[06:28:24.850 --> 06:28:26.850]  input. If I need magnesium
[06:28:26.850 --> 06:28:28.850]  I have one source of magnesium
[06:28:28.850 --> 06:28:30.850]  nothing else and that's Epsom salt.
[06:28:30.850 --> 06:28:32.850]  If I need potassium
[06:28:32.850 --> 06:28:34.850]  I have two options.
[06:28:34.850 --> 06:28:36.850]  I use potassium sulfate
[06:28:36.850 --> 06:28:38.850]  which I like to use a granular
[06:28:38.850 --> 06:28:40.850]  as a top dress for potassium sulfate.
[06:28:40.850 --> 06:28:42.850]  Here's a little trick if you guys didn't know.
[06:28:42.850 --> 06:28:44.850]  What it helps is it helps keep
[06:28:44.850 --> 06:28:46.850]  the
[06:28:46.850 --> 06:28:48.850]  pH in the soil up
[06:28:48.850 --> 06:28:50.850]  because you're getting potassium as you
[06:28:50.850 --> 06:28:52.850]  water it's not just
[06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:54.850]  completely there like it would be in
[06:28:54.850 --> 06:28:56.850]  powder form so it's slower
[06:28:56.850 --> 06:28:58.850]  to release so it's almost like a time release
[06:28:58.850 --> 06:29:00.850]  and that also helps keep that
[06:29:00.850 --> 06:29:02.850]  cation balance. So what you can
[06:29:02.850 --> 06:29:04.850]  do is like
[06:29:04.850 --> 06:29:06.850]  I often recommend
[06:29:06.850 --> 06:29:08.850]  to my
[06:29:08.850 --> 06:29:10.850]  clients to use
[06:29:10.850 --> 06:29:12.850]  potassium sulfate and they can add
[06:29:12.850 --> 06:29:14.850]  in a soluble form
[06:29:14.850 --> 06:29:16.850]  a powdered form that will be immediately
[06:29:16.850 --> 06:29:18.850]  available it will go through the whole system because
[06:29:18.850 --> 06:29:20.850]  it goes, you know it follows
[06:29:20.850 --> 06:29:22.850]  the water
[06:29:22.850 --> 06:29:24.850]  but if you go and you do
[06:29:24.850 --> 06:29:26.850]  more of a granular that's more
[06:29:26.850 --> 06:29:28.850]  of a slow release you'll have a sufficient
[06:29:28.850 --> 06:29:30.850]  amount that you need to make up that deficit
[06:29:30.850 --> 06:29:32.850]  but then you'll also be able to have that
[06:29:32.850 --> 06:29:34.850]  slowly release over time and that's
[06:29:34.850 --> 06:29:36.850]  going to again help that balance
[06:29:36.850 --> 06:29:38.850]  you know because
[06:29:38.850 --> 06:29:40.850]  not all of the things you want just
[06:29:40.850 --> 06:29:42.850]  like to be loaded up
[06:29:42.850 --> 06:29:44.850]  immediately you know sometimes you do
[06:29:44.850 --> 06:29:46.850]  and in that case I would go to something like
[06:29:46.850 --> 06:29:48.850]  potassium silica you know
[06:29:48.850 --> 06:29:50.850]  add some because it adds to the potassium
[06:29:50.850 --> 06:29:52.850]  it's more water soluble and then you also
[06:29:52.850 --> 06:29:54.850]  get the benefit of the silica as well
[06:29:54.850 --> 06:29:56.850]  you know so it
[06:29:56.850 --> 06:29:58.850]  can be contingent what you're putting into
[06:29:58.850 --> 06:30:00.850]  these systems depending on
[06:30:00.850 --> 06:30:02.850]  like what your need is
[06:30:02.850 --> 06:30:04.850]  but I try to focus on those single
[06:30:04.850 --> 06:30:06.850]  mineral inputs you know if I need calcium
[06:30:06.850 --> 06:30:08.850]  I'm using usually I'm using
[06:30:08.850 --> 06:30:10.850]  gypsum but if I need
[06:30:10.850 --> 06:30:12.850]  something like
[06:30:14.850 --> 06:30:16.850]  phosphorus
[06:30:16.850 --> 06:30:18.850]  phosphorus in almost all
[06:30:18.850 --> 06:30:20.850]  cases naturally comes with calcium
[06:30:20.850 --> 06:30:22.850]  you know whether it's a
[06:30:22.850 --> 06:30:24.850]  high phosphate seabird water which is
[06:30:24.850 --> 06:30:26.850]  still 20% calcium
[06:30:26.850 --> 06:30:28.850]  like 11% phosphorus
[06:30:28.850 --> 06:30:30.850]  if you're getting something like
[06:30:30.850 --> 06:30:32.850]  calcium phosphate soft rock mineral
[06:30:32.850 --> 06:30:34.850]  you're getting 3%
[06:30:34.850 --> 06:30:36.850]  phosphorus and then
[06:30:36.850 --> 06:30:38.850]  18% calcium so
[06:30:38.850 --> 06:30:40.850]  typically you can add in
[06:30:40.850 --> 06:30:42.850]  to make up for a
[06:30:42.850 --> 06:30:44.850]  calcium deficiency
[06:30:44.850 --> 06:30:46.850]  you can add in something
[06:30:46.850 --> 06:30:48.850]  like a soft mineral rock phosphate
[06:30:48.850 --> 06:30:50.850]  which is also going to help load up on that phosphorus
[06:30:50.850 --> 06:30:52.850]  as well
[06:30:52.850 --> 06:30:54.850]  Do you ever use
[06:30:54.850 --> 06:30:56.850]  compost as a
[06:30:56.850 --> 06:30:58.850]  potassium
[06:30:58.850 --> 06:31:00.850]  amendment?
[06:31:00.850 --> 06:31:02.850]  So compost is kind of tricky
[06:31:02.850 --> 06:31:04.850]  right because again you want
[06:31:04.850 --> 06:31:06.850]  to know where your compost
[06:31:06.850 --> 06:31:08.850]  starts that's the big thing
[06:31:08.850 --> 06:31:10.850]  and you want to look at the mineral
[06:31:10.850 --> 06:31:12.850]  makeup and the nutritional
[06:31:12.850 --> 06:31:14.850]  makeup of that compost it's what
[06:31:14.850 --> 06:31:16.850]  we do when we start
[06:31:16.850 --> 06:31:18.850]  building soils we want to make sure
[06:31:18.850 --> 06:31:20.850]  that we have sufficient enough
[06:31:20.850 --> 06:31:22.850]  to say hey this compost has
[06:31:22.850 --> 06:31:24.850]  X amount of magnesium
[06:31:24.850 --> 06:31:26.850]  X amount of nitrogen I want to add
[06:31:26.850 --> 06:31:28.850]  this percent of the soil mix
[06:31:28.850 --> 06:31:30.850]  that way when
[06:31:30.850 --> 06:31:32.850]  it's finalized there's not
[06:31:32.850 --> 06:31:34.850]  too much of something it's the same way
[06:31:34.850 --> 06:31:36.850]  you know I personally
[06:31:36.850 --> 06:31:38.850]  I'm not amending beds with
[06:31:38.850 --> 06:31:40.850]  compost I'm using the same
[06:31:40.850 --> 06:31:42.850]  mineral inputs because I
[06:31:42.850 --> 06:31:44.850]  started a soil
[06:31:44.850 --> 06:31:46.850]  I hate compost it's not even a soil
[06:31:46.850 --> 06:31:48.850]  it's a modified garlic mix right these things work
[06:31:48.850 --> 06:31:50.850]  more like a highly aerated
[06:31:50.850 --> 06:31:52.850]  cocoa that has
[06:31:52.850 --> 06:31:54.850]  mineral sufficiency that's just always
[06:31:54.850 --> 06:31:56.850]  present in it when it
[06:31:56.850 --> 06:31:58.850]  falls in the solution that's how these things
[06:31:58.850 --> 06:32:00.850]  really work and you can do this with all
[06:32:00.850 --> 06:32:02.850]  the organic rock
[06:32:02.850 --> 06:32:04.850]  amendments like I'm not
[06:32:04.850 --> 06:32:06.850]  even using like any
[06:32:06.850 --> 06:32:08.850]  animal inputs you know I don't use
[06:32:08.850 --> 06:32:10.850]  like blood meals, bone meals, nothing
[06:32:10.850 --> 06:32:12.850]  like that typically if I
[06:32:12.850 --> 06:32:14.850]  do it would be like
[06:32:14.850 --> 06:32:16.850]  a small small
[06:32:16.850 --> 06:32:18.850]  amount you know
[06:32:18.850 --> 06:32:20.850]  yeah so with the rock phosphate do you
[06:32:20.850 --> 06:32:22.850]  ever run into the polonium 210
[06:32:22.850 --> 06:32:24.850]  issue?
[06:32:24.850 --> 06:32:26.850]  Heavy metals? No it's a
[06:32:26.850 --> 06:32:28.850]  radioactive isotope that seems
[06:32:28.850 --> 06:32:30.850]  to be present in a lot of the rock
[06:32:30.850 --> 06:32:32.850]  phosphates and I used to run rock
[06:32:32.850 --> 06:32:34.850]  phosphate and then got away from
[06:32:34.850 --> 06:32:36.850]  it after a lot of
[06:32:36.850 --> 06:32:38.850]  seemingly a lot of
[06:32:38.850 --> 06:32:40.850]  people were finding
[06:32:40.850 --> 06:32:42.850]  polonium 210
[06:32:42.850 --> 06:32:44.850]  in a lot of the rock phosphate
[06:32:44.850 --> 06:32:46.850]  no that's something that I'm not familiar
[06:32:46.850 --> 06:32:48.850]  with
[06:32:48.850 --> 06:32:50.850]  it's you know
[06:32:50.850 --> 06:32:52.850]  it is definitely important to source your materials
[06:32:52.850 --> 06:32:54.850]  to make sure you're not adding things like heavy metals
[06:32:54.850 --> 06:32:56.850]  excuse me
[06:32:58.850 --> 06:33:00.850]  especially when we're talking about amendments
[06:33:00.850 --> 06:33:02.850]  that are like rock
[06:33:02.850 --> 06:33:04.850]  derivatives
[06:33:04.850 --> 06:33:06.850]  azomite
[06:33:06.850 --> 06:33:08.850]  azomite is something that I use a lot
[06:33:08.850 --> 06:33:10.850]  in my system because it's like azomite
[06:33:10.850 --> 06:33:12.850]  A to Z minerals and I was like this is one of the
[06:33:12.850 --> 06:33:14.850]  things that I think that could be really beneficial
[06:33:14.850 --> 06:33:16.850]  and while it has benefits
[06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:18.850]  it comes to find out that
[06:33:18.850 --> 06:33:20.850]  a lot of those azomites are really high
[06:33:20.850 --> 06:33:22.850]  in ammonium, really high
[06:33:22.850 --> 06:33:24.850]  in
[06:33:24.850 --> 06:33:26.850]  in
[06:33:26.850 --> 06:33:28.850]  cadmium
[06:33:28.850 --> 06:33:30.850]  arsenic
[06:33:30.850 --> 06:33:32.850]  and some other lead
[06:33:32.850 --> 06:33:34.850]  so you have
[06:33:34.850 --> 06:33:36.850]  to kind of
[06:33:36.850 --> 06:33:38.850]  my thing was like this
[06:33:38.850 --> 06:33:40.850]  I had to look at it from a different standpoint
[06:33:40.850 --> 06:33:42.850]  a lot of the things that I had used in the past
[06:33:42.850 --> 06:33:44.850]  before I was like
[06:33:44.850 --> 06:33:46.850]  I had to like say
[06:33:46.850 --> 06:33:48.850]  oh I need this because it's going to have
[06:33:48.850 --> 06:33:50.850]  all these minerals in it right
[06:33:50.850 --> 06:33:52.850]  once I actually
[06:33:52.850 --> 06:33:54.850]  looked at the tests and the data
[06:33:54.850 --> 06:33:56.850]  it's like oh well I don't need any of this
[06:33:56.850 --> 06:33:58.850]  mineral I don't need any of this I really only
[06:33:58.850 --> 06:34:00.850]  just need let's say
[06:34:00.850 --> 06:34:02.850]  like a little bit more copper and then
[06:34:02.850 --> 06:34:04.850]  some manganese
[06:34:04.850 --> 06:34:06.850]  in the system as far as my micronutrients go
[06:34:06.850 --> 06:34:08.850]  so it makes more sense on a commercial scale
[06:34:08.850 --> 06:34:10.850]  to just use something
[06:34:10.850 --> 06:34:12.850]  that is just manganese sulfate
[06:34:12.850 --> 06:34:14.850]  just copper sulfate
[06:34:14.850 --> 06:34:16.850]  and those can be watered into a system
[06:34:16.850 --> 06:34:18.850]  they can be copperized and it's
[06:34:18.850 --> 06:34:20.850]  going to give that system exactly
[06:34:20.850 --> 06:34:22.850]  what it needs right when it needs it
[06:34:22.850 --> 06:34:24.850]  it just
[06:34:24.850 --> 06:34:26.850]  a little more sufficient
[06:34:26.850 --> 06:34:33.640]  you know
[06:34:33.640 --> 06:34:35.640]  so I know you're talking
[06:34:35.640 --> 06:34:37.640]  briefly on like I call them
[06:34:37.640 --> 06:34:39.640]  sulfurophores, iron carriers
[06:34:39.640 --> 06:34:41.640]  when I started to
[06:34:41.640 --> 06:34:43.640]  understand that and dive deeper into that
[06:34:43.640 --> 06:34:45.640]  I felt like I started to get those
[06:34:45.640 --> 06:34:47.640]  unique expressions in the
[06:34:47.640 --> 06:34:49.640]  high end genetics that I started to purchase
[06:34:49.640 --> 06:34:51.640]  can you kind of dive deeper into that
[06:34:51.640 --> 06:34:53.640]  maybe why iron is so important
[06:34:53.640 --> 06:34:55.640]  and why that's something that I feel like
[06:34:55.640 --> 06:34:57.640]  especially a lot of new farmers miss out on
[06:34:57.640 --> 06:34:59.640]  yeah so
[06:34:59.640 --> 06:35:01.640]  you know
[06:35:01.640 --> 06:35:03.640]  the whole
[06:35:03.640 --> 06:35:05.640]  you know process
[06:35:05.640 --> 06:35:07.640]  of this plant is to take
[06:35:07.640 --> 06:35:09.640]  is to take carbon
[06:35:09.640 --> 06:35:11.640]  and to create new chemical compounds
[06:35:11.640 --> 06:35:13.640]  and they use
[06:35:13.640 --> 06:35:15.640]  it by building
[06:35:15.640 --> 06:35:17.640]  carbon skeletons and then using these
[06:35:17.640 --> 06:35:19.640]  reduced minerals to
[06:35:19.640 --> 06:35:21.640]  turn them into other things
[06:35:21.640 --> 06:35:23.640]  um
[06:35:23.640 --> 06:35:25.640]  if you have
[06:35:25.640 --> 06:35:27.640]  a sufficient amount of nutrient
[06:35:27.640 --> 06:35:29.640]  and you're just missing one
[06:35:29.640 --> 06:35:31.640]  thing right
[06:35:31.640 --> 06:35:33.640]  you can still have a really
[06:35:33.640 --> 06:35:35.640]  good result but
[06:35:35.640 --> 06:35:37.640]  you're not going to be able
[06:35:37.640 --> 06:35:39.640]  you're going to be limited in energy
[06:35:39.640 --> 06:35:41.640]  to do certain processes
[06:35:41.640 --> 06:35:43.640]  um one of the things that
[06:35:43.640 --> 06:35:45.640]  you know you've heard me
[06:35:45.640 --> 06:35:47.640]  talk about before like on
[06:35:47.640 --> 06:35:49.640]  different episodes of future cannabis
[06:35:49.640 --> 06:35:51.640]  projects other podcasts
[06:35:51.640 --> 06:35:53.640]  I talk about energy
[06:35:53.640 --> 06:35:55.640]  conservation in the actual plant
[06:35:55.640 --> 06:35:57.640]  in conserving energy through
[06:35:57.640 --> 06:35:59.640]  metabolic processes this is one of the reasons why
[06:35:59.640 --> 06:36:01.640]  I use the amino acids right
[06:36:01.640 --> 06:36:03.640]  it all gets behind in a minute
[06:36:03.640 --> 06:36:05.640]  now
[06:36:05.640 --> 06:36:07.640]  to understand what's happening
[06:36:07.640 --> 06:36:09.640]  with nitrogen
[06:36:09.640 --> 06:36:11.640]  nitrogen is sequestered by the plant
[06:36:11.640 --> 06:36:13.640]  but it's turning to amino acids and then those are
[06:36:13.640 --> 06:36:15.640]  converted into proteins
[06:36:15.640 --> 06:36:17.640]  it takes a lot of energy for the plant to do this
[06:36:17.640 --> 06:36:19.640]  it takes up to 18% of
[06:36:19.640 --> 06:36:21.640]  the plant's energy to convert nitrogen
[06:36:21.640 --> 06:36:23.640]  into proteins
[06:36:23.640 --> 06:36:25.640]  that energy comes from
[06:36:25.640 --> 06:36:27.640]  photosynthesis it comes through
[06:36:27.640 --> 06:36:29.640]  all of the
[06:36:29.640 --> 06:36:31.640]  photoelectric excitement and all those different
[06:36:31.640 --> 06:36:33.640]  pathways
[06:36:33.640 --> 06:36:35.640]  there's a mix of
[06:36:35.640 --> 06:36:37.640]  science and stuff
[06:36:37.640 --> 06:36:39.640]  that's going on
[06:36:39.640 --> 06:36:41.640]  but essentially if we're able
[06:36:41.640 --> 06:36:43.640]  to bypass some of these
[06:36:43.640 --> 06:36:45.640]  processes by feeding
[06:36:45.640 --> 06:36:47.640]  things like amino acids
[06:36:47.640 --> 06:36:49.640]  to plants which the plant is going to create
[06:36:49.640 --> 06:36:51.640]  those amino acids out of the nitrogen anyway
[06:36:51.640 --> 06:36:53.640]  it's going to conserve that energy
[06:36:53.640 --> 06:36:55.640]  so it essentially has that energy for other metabolic
[06:36:55.640 --> 06:36:57.640]  functions
[06:36:57.640 --> 06:36:59.640]  when you run
[06:36:59.640 --> 06:37:01.640]  out of certain mineral element
[06:37:01.640 --> 06:37:03.640]  you're limited in
[06:37:03.640 --> 06:37:05.640]  the plant's ability to
[06:37:05.640 --> 06:37:07.640]  create things like proteins
[06:37:07.640 --> 06:37:09.640]  or to create things like enzymes
[06:37:09.640 --> 06:37:11.640]  that are used to
[06:37:11.640 --> 06:37:13.640]  maybe
[06:37:13.640 --> 06:37:15.640]  for a different pathway
[06:37:15.640 --> 06:37:17.640]  that's going to I don't know
[06:37:17.640 --> 06:37:19.640]  maybe it's going to split something
[06:37:19.640 --> 06:37:21.640]  in half and make something available
[06:37:21.640 --> 06:37:23.640]  you know in one of these
[06:37:23.640 --> 06:37:25.640]  because when we're looking at this plant it's full of
[06:37:25.640 --> 06:37:27.640]  all these cellular machines and these
[06:37:27.640 --> 06:37:29.640]  machines all function differently with different
[06:37:29.640 --> 06:37:31.640]  nutrients and they all do different things
[06:37:31.640 --> 06:37:33.640]  and it's like
[06:37:33.640 --> 06:37:35.640]  it's really psychedelic
[06:37:35.640 --> 06:37:37.640]  when you get into
[06:37:37.640 --> 06:37:39.640]  the mechanics of how
[06:37:39.640 --> 06:37:41.640]  these things work and we're talking
[06:37:41.640 --> 06:37:43.640]  about things like you know your photosynthetic
[06:37:43.640 --> 06:37:45.640]  chemicals, nitrogen
[06:37:45.640 --> 06:37:47.640]  magnesium, sulfur
[06:37:47.640 --> 06:37:49.640]  iron,
[06:37:49.640 --> 06:37:51.640]  molybdenum
[06:37:51.640 --> 06:37:53.640]  you have to have a sufficient amount
[06:37:53.640 --> 06:37:55.640]  for it to be
[06:37:55.640 --> 06:37:57.640]  for the plant to be able to
[06:37:57.640 --> 06:37:59.640]  acquire
[06:37:59.640 --> 06:38:01.640]  all the light that it's getting
[06:38:01.640 --> 06:38:03.640]  a lot of times we're pushing
[06:38:03.640 --> 06:38:05.640]  trying to push these plants past their
[06:38:05.640 --> 06:38:07.640]  natural limits
[06:38:07.640 --> 06:38:09.640]  right with
[06:38:09.640 --> 06:38:11.640]  the high intense lighting
[06:38:11.640 --> 06:38:13.640]  and these high nutrition diets
[06:38:13.640 --> 06:38:15.640]  and really
[06:38:15.640 --> 06:38:17.640]  what I've
[06:38:17.640 --> 06:38:19.640]  come to experience is that
[06:38:19.640 --> 06:38:21.640]  it really just comes to
[06:38:21.640 --> 06:38:23.640]  balance and then
[06:38:23.640 --> 06:38:25.640]  doing those little biohacks that
[06:38:25.640 --> 06:38:27.640]  nature's created for us
[06:38:27.640 --> 06:38:29.640]  when you
[06:38:29.640 --> 06:38:31.640]  create a system
[06:38:31.640 --> 06:38:33.640]  that's conducive for the growth of
[06:38:33.640 --> 06:38:35.640]  something like a trichoderma
[06:38:35.640 --> 06:38:37.640]  that can use its metabolites
[06:38:37.640 --> 06:38:39.640]  something that it's creating as a
[06:38:39.640 --> 06:38:41.640]  byproduct as a waste product
[06:38:41.640 --> 06:38:43.640]  basically that is going to benefit
[06:38:43.640 --> 06:38:45.640]  the plant
[06:38:45.640 --> 06:38:47.640]  to be able to get something like iron
[06:38:47.640 --> 06:38:49.640]  which is an extremely
[06:38:49.640 --> 06:38:51.640]  hard nutrient
[06:38:51.640 --> 06:38:53.640]  because of the
[06:38:53.640 --> 06:38:55.640]  chemical properties
[06:38:55.640 --> 06:38:57.640]  you're going to be able to increase
[06:38:57.640 --> 06:38:59.640]  that plant's photosynthetic
[06:38:59.640 --> 06:39:01.640]  capabilities and when you're increasing
[06:39:01.640 --> 06:39:03.640]  its photosynthetic capabilities you're increasing
[06:39:03.640 --> 06:39:05.640]  the amount of energy that that plant
[06:39:05.640 --> 06:39:07.640]  has for other processes this combined
[06:39:07.640 --> 06:39:09.640]  with the other things like those biohacks
[06:39:09.640 --> 06:39:11.640]  using amino acids
[06:39:11.640 --> 06:39:13.640]  these are where
[06:39:13.640 --> 06:39:15.640]  you're going to be able to unlock the potential
[06:39:15.640 --> 06:39:17.640]  for things like
[06:39:17.640 --> 06:39:19.640]  pathogen suppression
[06:39:19.640 --> 06:39:21.640]  acquired systemic resistance
[06:39:21.640 --> 06:39:23.640]  these different immune responses
[06:39:23.640 --> 06:39:25.640]  that are going to really help
[06:39:25.640 --> 06:39:27.640]  increase the health and
[06:39:27.640 --> 06:39:29.640]  the
[06:39:29.640 --> 06:39:31.640]  quality and the vigor
[06:39:31.640 --> 06:39:33.640]  and the overall well-being of this plant
[06:39:33.640 --> 06:39:35.640]  it really comes to
[06:39:35.640 --> 06:39:37.640]  you know
[06:39:37.640 --> 06:39:39.640]  to
[06:39:39.640 --> 06:39:41.640]  nutrition, soil nutrition
[06:39:41.640 --> 06:39:43.640]  because soil nutrition is not only
[06:39:43.640 --> 06:39:45.640]  feeding the plant but it's feeding
[06:39:45.640 --> 06:39:47.640]  microbes as well and they work hand in hand
[06:39:47.640 --> 06:39:49.640]  right? Chemistry changes biology
[06:39:49.640 --> 06:39:51.640]  biology changes chemistry and it
[06:39:51.640 --> 06:39:53.640]  goes back and forth and back and forth
[06:39:53.640 --> 06:39:55.640]  so we have to
[06:39:55.640 --> 06:39:57.640]  look at it from that perspective
[06:39:57.640 --> 06:39:59.640]  and I also need to look at it from like
[06:39:59.640 --> 06:40:01.640]  you know when I see a science
[06:40:01.640 --> 06:40:03.640]  paper can it be applied
[06:40:03.640 --> 06:40:05.640]  to this system or is this something that strictly
[06:40:05.640 --> 06:40:07.640]  is only going to work in an agronomic setting
[06:40:07.640 --> 06:40:09.640]  you know that's one of the things that I
[06:40:09.640 --> 06:40:11.640]  am like
[06:40:11.640 --> 06:40:13.640]  okay so I can use
[06:40:13.640 --> 06:40:15.640]  certain things, certain principles work
[06:40:15.640 --> 06:40:17.640]  way better in field conditions than
[06:40:17.640 --> 06:40:19.640]  they do in a living soil system. Doing
[06:40:19.640 --> 06:40:21.640]  crop covers at scale
[06:40:21.640 --> 06:40:23.640]  can be a nightmare
[06:40:23.640 --> 06:40:25.640]  you know it's like when you have
[06:40:25.640 --> 06:40:27.640]  88
[06:40:27.640 --> 06:40:29.640]  yards of soil
[06:40:29.640 --> 06:40:31.640]  that have all crop cover it's going
[06:40:31.640 --> 06:40:33.640]  to take another
[06:40:33.640 --> 06:40:35.640]  additional hand to go chop and drop all that
[06:40:35.640 --> 06:40:37.640]  stuff and it's something else that you have to maintain
[06:40:37.640 --> 06:40:39.640]  right? So choosing
[06:40:39.640 --> 06:40:41.640]  and
[06:40:41.640 --> 06:40:43.640]  applying the types of
[06:40:43.640 --> 06:40:45.640]  information that
[06:40:45.640 --> 06:40:47.640]  go with standard
[06:40:47.640 --> 06:40:49.640]  agriculture practices to help build
[06:40:49.640 --> 06:40:51.640]  soil health
[06:40:51.640 --> 06:40:53.640]  and fertility
[06:40:53.640 --> 06:40:55.640]  can be different in
[06:40:55.640 --> 06:40:57.640]  modified growing systems you know
[06:40:57.640 --> 06:40:59.640]  so there's kind of a you take a lot of those
[06:40:59.640 --> 06:41:01.640]  same principles but a lot of them are different
[06:41:01.640 --> 06:41:03.640]  you know like and then the biology part
[06:41:03.640 --> 06:41:05.640]  like I always
[06:41:05.640 --> 06:41:07.640]  use a specific
[06:41:07.640 --> 06:41:09.640]  set of consortiums of
[06:41:09.640 --> 06:41:11.640]  microbes because I know
[06:41:11.640 --> 06:41:13.640]  what they do you know
[06:41:13.640 --> 06:41:15.640]  okay so here we go
[06:41:15.640 --> 06:41:17.640]  right I talked about two of them which is
[06:41:17.640 --> 06:41:19.640]  Bacillus subtilis the Trichoderma
[06:41:19.640 --> 06:41:21.640]  that works great
[06:41:21.640 --> 06:41:23.640]  there's seven different species of Bacillus
[06:41:23.640 --> 06:41:25.640]  Bacillus Pumerus
[06:41:25.640 --> 06:41:27.640]  there's the again
[06:41:27.640 --> 06:41:29.640]  with the Bacillus subtilis that's in the Microbes Plus
[06:41:29.640 --> 06:41:31.640]  there's some other Bacillus
[06:41:31.640 --> 06:41:33.640]  strains Marco
[06:41:33.640 --> 06:41:35.640]  mentioned one of them right Bacillus
[06:41:35.640 --> 06:41:37.640]  Therigensis
[06:41:37.640 --> 06:41:39.640]  there's two different
[06:41:39.640 --> 06:41:41.640]  strains this is one of
[06:41:41.640 --> 06:41:43.640]  the times that you will hear me
[06:41:43.640 --> 06:41:45.640]  say strain
[06:41:45.640 --> 06:41:47.640]  when I'm talking about
[06:41:47.640 --> 06:41:49.640]  microorganisms because
[06:41:49.640 --> 06:41:51.640]  there are
[06:41:51.640 --> 06:41:53.640]  two different distinct strains
[06:41:53.640 --> 06:41:55.640]  of Bacillus Therigensis one of them
[06:41:55.640 --> 06:41:57.640]  will control things like mosquitoes and
[06:41:57.640 --> 06:41:59.640]  the other is for things
[06:41:59.640 --> 06:42:01.640]  like cutworms
[06:42:01.640 --> 06:42:03.640]  cabbage worms
[06:42:03.640 --> 06:42:05.640]  the things that burrow
[06:42:05.640 --> 06:42:07.640]  through your weed and mold it out
[06:42:07.640 --> 06:42:09.640]  so Bacillus Therigensis
[06:42:09.640 --> 06:42:11.640]  Crestaceae
[06:42:11.640 --> 06:42:13.640]  VTK is what
[06:42:13.640 --> 06:42:15.640]  you find in mosquito dunks
[06:42:15.640 --> 06:42:17.640]  and it's actually the toxin
[06:42:17.640 --> 06:42:19.640]  that the
[06:42:19.640 --> 06:42:21.640]  bacteria produces
[06:42:21.640 --> 06:42:23.640]  that is effective against
[06:42:23.640 --> 06:42:25.640]  these insects
[06:42:25.640 --> 06:42:27.640]  so there's that and there's the
[06:42:27.640 --> 06:42:29.640]  Israeli Insect Strain which is for
[06:42:29.640 --> 06:42:31.640]  the microbes also
[06:42:31.640 --> 06:42:33.640]  B.bossiana
[06:42:33.640 --> 06:42:35.640]  is another, it's a fungi
[06:42:35.640 --> 06:42:37.640]  it's endopathogenic which means
[06:42:37.640 --> 06:42:39.640]  it is parasitic to a wide host
[06:42:39.640 --> 06:42:41.640]  of insect pests
[06:42:41.640 --> 06:42:43.640]  and you can use that as integrated pest
[06:42:43.640 --> 06:42:45.640]  management to control
[06:42:45.640 --> 06:42:47.640]  things like aphids, white
[06:42:47.640 --> 06:42:49.640]  flies, thrips, it's been effective
[06:42:49.640 --> 06:42:51.640]  against mice and it has low impact
[06:42:51.640 --> 06:42:53.640]  on your predator mice things like
[06:42:53.640 --> 06:42:55.640]  rogue beetles, things like
[06:42:55.640 --> 06:42:57.640]  hypoascus miles,
[06:42:57.640 --> 06:42:59.640]  soil dwelling mice so it has low
[06:42:59.640 --> 06:43:01.640]  impact on the good stuff, has high impact
[06:43:01.640 --> 06:43:03.640]  on the bad stuff
[06:43:03.640 --> 06:43:05.640]  but again when you're talking about bio controls
[06:43:05.640 --> 06:43:07.640]  you also have to make sure that you have
[06:43:07.640 --> 06:43:09.640]  proper application because
[06:43:09.640 --> 06:43:11.640]  this is a fungus
[06:43:11.640 --> 06:43:13.640]  it creates a spore
[06:43:13.640 --> 06:43:15.640]  it needs to be in contact
[06:43:15.640 --> 06:43:17.640]  with whatever it
[06:43:17.640 --> 06:43:19.640]  touches and you usually want to have
[06:43:19.640 --> 06:43:21.640]  higher humidity
[06:43:21.640 --> 06:43:23.640]  when you're applying these types of
[06:43:23.640 --> 06:43:25.640]  things because again when you're talking about
[06:43:25.640 --> 06:43:27.640]  culturing microbes and having them be
[06:43:27.640 --> 06:43:29.640]  effective, when you're growing mushrooms
[06:43:29.640 --> 06:43:31.640]  you're usually growing in a pretty
[06:43:31.640 --> 06:43:33.640]  warm, humid environment
[06:43:33.640 --> 06:43:35.640]  and there's a reason
[06:43:35.640 --> 06:43:37.640]  your
[06:43:37.640 --> 06:43:39.640]  cultures, your bacteria
[06:43:39.640 --> 06:43:41.640]  and your microbes, they really
[06:43:41.640 --> 06:43:43.640]  really like warm, humid
[06:43:43.640 --> 06:43:45.640]  temperatures for a lot of these ones
[06:43:45.640 --> 06:43:47.640]  it's one of the reasons why
[06:43:47.640 --> 06:43:49.640]  VPD can also affect
[06:43:49.640 --> 06:43:51.640]  your nutrient cycling capacity
[06:43:51.640 --> 06:43:53.640]  of these soils
[06:43:53.640 --> 06:43:55.640]  but again sometimes
[06:43:55.640 --> 06:43:57.640]  a lot of varieties you can't take up
[06:43:57.640 --> 06:43:59.640]  those higher humid ranges
[06:43:59.640 --> 06:44:01.640]  without having
[06:44:01.640 --> 06:44:03.640]  possible
[06:44:03.640 --> 06:44:05.640]  issues
[06:44:05.640 --> 06:44:07.640]  you know
[06:44:07.640 --> 06:44:09.640]  one of the other things that I'm using
[06:44:09.640 --> 06:44:11.640]  is the Buvaria
[06:44:11.640 --> 06:44:13.640]  Blossiana, the BT Trichoderma
[06:44:13.640 --> 06:44:15.640]  the MicroPlus
[06:44:15.640 --> 06:44:17.640]  go ahead
[06:44:17.640 --> 06:44:19.640]  get into the VPD
[06:44:19.640 --> 06:44:21.640]  a little bit more, a lot of people
[06:44:21.640 --> 06:44:23.640]  you know kind of question
[06:44:23.640 --> 06:44:25.640]  what's really
[06:44:25.640 --> 06:44:27.640]  interesting is VPD actually
[06:44:27.640 --> 06:44:29.640]  affects calcium uptake
[06:44:29.640 --> 06:44:31.640]  and a lot of us are familiar with
[06:44:31.640 --> 06:44:33.640]  calcium, calcium is a major
[06:44:33.640 --> 06:44:35.640]  cation which means it has two bonding sites
[06:44:35.640 --> 06:44:37.640]  and it will bring in other nutrients
[06:44:37.640 --> 06:44:39.640]  with it
[06:44:39.640 --> 06:44:41.640]  we have
[06:44:41.640 --> 06:44:43.640]  okay
[06:44:43.640 --> 06:44:45.640]  this is one of the ways that I like to visualize
[06:44:45.640 --> 06:44:47.640]  like
[06:44:47.640 --> 06:44:49.640]  internal osmotic pressure
[06:44:49.640 --> 06:44:51.640]  within a plant but you know when you're
[06:44:51.640 --> 06:44:53.640]  a little kid and you have a juice box
[06:44:53.640 --> 06:44:55.640]  and you blow pressure into that
[06:44:55.640 --> 06:44:57.640]  juice box and as soon as you take pressure
[06:44:57.640 --> 06:44:59.640]  off of it, water comes
[06:44:59.640 --> 06:45:01.640]  out. I think of that straw as kind
[06:45:01.640 --> 06:45:03.640]  of like the opening of a stomata on
[06:45:03.640 --> 06:45:05.640]  a plant and once that pressure is released
[06:45:05.640 --> 06:45:07.640]  it's causing
[06:45:07.640 --> 06:45:09.640]  the transpiration of
[06:45:09.640 --> 06:45:11.640]  water
[06:45:11.640 --> 06:45:13.640]  when you have
[06:45:13.640 --> 06:45:15.640]  when you have
[06:45:15.640 --> 06:45:17.640]  an environment that's conducive
[06:45:17.640 --> 06:45:19.640]  that lets the plant
[06:45:19.640 --> 06:45:21.640]  transpire more
[06:45:21.640 --> 06:45:23.640]  it's going to be able to move more water
[06:45:23.640 --> 06:45:25.640]  essentially moving more nutrients into the
[06:45:25.640 --> 06:45:27.640]  cellular structures of the plant
[06:45:27.640 --> 06:45:29.640]  so that's kind of one
[06:45:29.640 --> 06:45:31.640]  of the ways that that works and calcium
[06:45:31.640 --> 06:45:33.640]  is one of those
[06:45:33.640 --> 06:45:35.640]  immobile nutrients
[06:45:35.640 --> 06:45:37.640]  so it won't translocate
[06:45:37.640 --> 06:45:39.640]  it will, what it will do is it will fill
[06:45:39.640 --> 06:45:41.640]  up the bottom
[06:45:41.640 --> 06:45:43.640]  requirements of the plant before
[06:45:43.640 --> 06:45:45.640]  it moves on so if you're deficient
[06:45:45.640 --> 06:45:47.640]  in calcium
[06:45:47.640 --> 06:45:49.640]  you'll usually see it
[06:45:49.640 --> 06:45:51.640]  at the tops because it's not
[06:45:51.640 --> 06:45:53.640]  a mobile nutrient
[06:45:53.640 --> 06:45:55.640]  and so it wants to
[06:45:55.640 --> 06:45:57.640]  you want to make sure that you have sufficiency
[06:45:57.640 --> 06:45:59.640]  and again BPD affects
[06:45:59.640 --> 06:46:01.640]  your microbes
[06:46:01.640 --> 06:46:03.640]  right, your climate
[06:46:03.640 --> 06:46:05.640]  as an organic grower
[06:46:05.640 --> 06:46:07.640]  you've seen how temperatures
[06:46:07.640 --> 06:46:09.640]  can affect the biology of the soil
[06:46:09.640 --> 06:46:11.640]  you can see how things speed up
[06:46:11.640 --> 06:46:13.640]  how things slow down, you can see how
[06:46:13.640 --> 06:46:15.640]  hydrology will
[06:46:15.640 --> 06:46:17.640]  do the same thing, springfield populations
[06:46:17.640 --> 06:46:19.640]  really explode when you have a lot of organic
[06:46:19.640 --> 06:46:21.640]  matter and it's hot and humid right
[06:46:21.640 --> 06:46:23.640]  you're getting a lot of
[06:46:23.640 --> 06:46:25.640]  other things that are happening that you might not be able
[06:46:25.640 --> 06:46:27.640]  to see as far as bacteria that
[06:46:27.640 --> 06:46:29.640]  is growing and when you're
[06:46:29.640 --> 06:46:31.640]  increasing the
[06:46:31.640 --> 06:46:33.640]  the
[06:46:33.640 --> 06:46:35.640]  the, or when
[06:46:35.640 --> 06:46:37.640]  you're getting an environment that's conducive
[06:46:37.640 --> 06:46:39.640]  for these microbes to culture
[06:46:39.640 --> 06:46:41.640]  you're culturing microbes in these systems right
[06:46:41.640 --> 06:46:43.640]  that's what we're doing essentially
[06:46:43.640 --> 06:46:45.640]  we're giving them complex carbohydrates
[06:46:45.640 --> 06:46:47.640]  we're giving them mineral nutrition
[06:46:47.640 --> 06:46:49.640]  we're giving them a plethora of different things
[06:46:49.640 --> 06:46:51.640]  to stimulate
[06:46:51.640 --> 06:46:53.640]  these different processes whether they're biological
[06:46:53.640 --> 06:46:55.640]  or chemical
[06:46:55.640 --> 06:46:57.640]  and so
[06:46:57.640 --> 06:46:59.640]  when you're increasing those things
[06:46:59.640 --> 06:47:01.640]  the temperature and humidity just like when you're culturing
[06:47:01.640 --> 06:47:03.640]  mushrooms that's how they grow
[06:47:03.640 --> 06:47:05.640]  and you'll have better
[06:47:05.640 --> 06:47:07.640]  phosphorus cycling
[06:47:07.640 --> 06:47:09.640]  because phosphorus cycles
[06:47:09.640 --> 06:47:11.640]  biologically. One thing
[06:47:11.640 --> 06:47:13.640]  you guys don't know a little bit about that
[06:47:13.640 --> 06:47:15.640]  is that phosphorus
[06:47:15.640 --> 06:47:17.640]  the main component is
[06:47:17.640 --> 06:47:19.640]  the reason why it's so important
[06:47:19.640 --> 06:47:21.640]  is because it creates ATP
[06:47:21.640 --> 06:47:23.640]  anhydride phosphate which is the energy
[06:47:23.640 --> 06:47:25.640]  exchange currency for all biological
[06:47:25.640 --> 06:47:27.640]  processes
[06:47:27.640 --> 06:47:29.640]  so three phosphate molecules they go through
[06:47:29.640 --> 06:47:31.640]  a cycle internally in these
[06:47:31.640 --> 06:47:33.640]  cellular machines where
[06:47:33.640 --> 06:47:35.640]  they are
[06:47:35.640 --> 06:47:37.640]  combined together and then broken
[06:47:37.640 --> 06:47:39.640]  apart and in doing that it releases energy
[06:47:39.640 --> 06:47:41.640]  and that energy is utilized
[06:47:41.640 --> 06:47:43.640]  for every single type of
[06:47:43.640 --> 06:47:45.640]  biological process that happens
[06:47:45.640 --> 06:47:47.640]  in plants. It's a little more complicated
[06:47:47.640 --> 06:47:49.640]  than that but I'm trying to
[06:47:49.640 --> 06:47:51.640]  simplify it. That's why
[06:47:51.640 --> 06:47:53.640]  trying to have adequate phosphorus
[06:47:53.640 --> 06:47:55.640]  in these soils is really really important
[06:47:55.640 --> 06:47:57.640]  that's one of the things that we see
[06:47:57.640 --> 06:47:59.640]  on the testing with these different
[06:47:59.640 --> 06:48:01.640]  biologicals is that ability
[06:48:01.640 --> 06:48:03.640]  to take even if you don't have a
[06:48:03.640 --> 06:48:05.640]  high amount of phosphorus
[06:48:05.640 --> 06:48:07.640]  in the soil
[06:48:07.640 --> 06:48:09.640]  you'll still have adequate
[06:48:09.640 --> 06:48:11.640]  phosphate as it falls in solution as it
[06:48:11.640 --> 06:48:13.640]  cycles. I think that has to do
[06:48:13.640 --> 06:48:15.640]  with two things though. It's not always just
[06:48:15.640 --> 06:48:17.640]  biology but you have to remember that the
[06:48:17.640 --> 06:48:19.640]  plant is going to
[06:48:19.640 --> 06:48:21.640]  always be releasing photosynthates
[06:48:21.640 --> 06:48:23.640]  and different
[06:48:23.640 --> 06:48:25.640]  entities in the soil to try to
[06:48:25.640 --> 06:48:27.640]  either reduce chemicals
[06:48:27.640 --> 06:48:29.640]  or to oxidize
[06:48:29.640 --> 06:48:31.640]  chemicals or to
[06:48:31.640 --> 06:48:33.640]  change pH ranges
[06:48:33.640 --> 06:48:35.640]  to get
[06:48:35.640 --> 06:48:37.640]  what it's after.
[06:48:37.640 --> 06:48:39.640]  One of those chemicals
[06:48:39.640 --> 06:48:41.640]  I'm sure
[06:48:41.640 --> 06:48:45.640]  I can't remember the name of that chemical compound
[06:48:45.640 --> 06:48:47.640]  but it's a
[06:48:47.640 --> 06:48:49.640]  phosphorus
[06:48:49.640 --> 06:48:51.640]  solubilizing it
[06:48:51.640 --> 06:48:53.640]  solubilizes phosphate from phosphorus
[06:48:53.640 --> 06:48:55.640]  and it does it really efficiently.
[06:48:55.640 --> 06:48:57.640]  That's the thing is if you have those types of
[06:48:57.640 --> 06:48:59.640]  relationships
[06:48:59.640 --> 06:49:01.640]  you're going to get the maximum benefit through
[06:49:01.640 --> 06:49:03.640]  the release of nutrition.
[06:49:08.520 --> 06:49:12.520]  Let me see if there's any questions.
[06:49:14.520 --> 06:49:16.520]  Peter are you there buddy?
[06:49:16.520 --> 06:49:21.450]  Hold on.
[06:49:21.450 --> 06:49:23.450]  Yeah hey I
[06:49:23.450 --> 06:49:25.450]  appreciate everybody that came out today
[06:49:25.450 --> 06:49:27.450]  and you know we were talking
[06:49:27.450 --> 06:49:29.450]  a little bit earlier about community.
[06:49:29.450 --> 06:49:31.450]  There wasn't
[06:49:31.450 --> 06:49:33.450]  a huge
[06:49:33.450 --> 06:49:35.450]  open community in the places that
[06:49:35.450 --> 06:49:37.450]  I come from, the plants that I come from
[06:49:37.450 --> 06:49:39.450]  so being able to
[06:49:39.450 --> 06:49:41.450]  stand up here and share
[06:49:41.450 --> 06:49:43.450]  my experiences with everybody
[06:49:43.450 --> 06:49:45.450]  it's both humbling and
[06:49:45.450 --> 06:49:47.450]  I'm still kind of shocked that people
[06:49:47.450 --> 06:49:49.450]  want to listen to me talk.
[06:49:57.450 --> 06:49:59.450]  We all collectively have to
[06:49:59.450 --> 06:50:01.450]  understand that if we want to
[06:50:01.450 --> 06:50:03.450]  maintain
[06:50:03.450 --> 06:50:05.450]  control of the
[06:50:05.450 --> 06:50:07.450]  industry and business
[06:50:07.450 --> 06:50:09.450]  it takes a
[06:50:09.450 --> 06:50:11.450]  collective effort to
[06:50:11.450 --> 06:50:13.450]  do the education
[06:50:13.450 --> 06:50:15.450]  not just educating each other but
[06:50:15.450 --> 06:50:17.450]  we got to get like legal
[06:50:17.450 --> 06:50:19.450]  teams and we got to educate
[06:50:19.450 --> 06:50:21.450]  the people who are making laws and
[06:50:21.450 --> 06:50:23.450]  help them understand because
[06:50:23.450 --> 06:50:25.450]  I mean
[06:50:25.450 --> 06:50:27.450]  I've just been growing
[06:50:27.450 --> 06:50:29.450]  wheat for a long time and I guess I've just
[06:50:29.450 --> 06:50:31.450]  kind of tried to take the responsibility on
[06:50:31.450 --> 06:50:33.450]  to showcase kind of what I'm doing
[06:50:33.450 --> 06:50:35.450]  and say hey there's a better way
[06:50:35.450 --> 06:50:37.450]  to do things and there's a lot
[06:50:37.450 --> 06:50:39.450]  of misinformation that you know I
[06:50:39.450 --> 06:50:41.450]  follow and it's up to the community
[06:50:41.450 --> 06:50:43.450]  to educate each other but really
[06:50:43.450 --> 06:50:45.450]  I want to keep doing this. I don't want to like
[06:50:45.450 --> 06:50:47.450]  stop growing
[06:50:47.450 --> 06:50:49.450]  not just the plant
[06:50:49.450 --> 06:50:51.450]  but as a person and
[06:50:51.450 --> 06:50:53.450]  as an educator
[06:50:53.450 --> 06:50:55.450]  so I
[06:50:55.450 --> 06:50:57.450]  just don't see
[06:50:57.450 --> 06:50:59.450]  there being
[06:50:59.450 --> 06:51:01.450]  a future if we can't all collectively
[06:51:01.450 --> 06:51:03.450]  come together to help stop a lot
[06:51:03.450 --> 06:51:05.450]  of the
[06:51:05.450 --> 06:51:07.450]  bullshit madness you know
[06:51:07.450 --> 06:51:09.450]  when someone comes in and tries to
[06:51:09.450 --> 06:51:11.450]  raise higher taxes or
[06:51:11.450 --> 06:51:13.450]  try to put limitations on
[06:51:13.450 --> 06:51:15.450]  how we're allowed to
[06:51:15.450 --> 06:51:17.450]  operate. It's us to come
[06:51:17.450 --> 06:51:19.450]  together to try to create
[06:51:19.450 --> 06:51:21.450]  organizations and to get
[06:51:21.450 --> 06:51:23.450]  legal counsel for each other
[06:51:23.450 --> 06:51:25.450]  to push back
[06:51:25.450 --> 06:51:27.450]  because I
[06:51:27.450 --> 06:51:29.450]  I mean the only
[06:51:29.450 --> 06:51:31.450]  reason I'm standing here in front of you guys right
[06:51:31.450 --> 06:51:33.450]  now is because I moved out here to Oklahoma
[06:51:33.450 --> 06:51:35.450]  I would have never
[06:51:35.450 --> 06:51:37.450]  ever in my wildest dreams
[06:51:37.450 --> 06:51:39.450]  I don't think been able to
[06:51:39.450 --> 06:51:41.450]  operate in California because of
[06:51:41.450 --> 06:51:43.450]  my past, my background
[06:51:43.450 --> 06:51:45.450]  and because of the way the legislation
[06:51:45.450 --> 06:51:47.450]  is written out. You know I know
[06:51:47.450 --> 06:51:49.450]  so many people all over the country
[06:51:49.450 --> 06:51:51.450]  that are looking at
[06:51:51.450 --> 06:51:53.450]  Oklahoma and the people and the businesses
[06:51:53.450 --> 06:51:55.450]  and what people are doing here and we have
[06:51:55.450 --> 06:51:57.450]  a real opportunity. We have a real opportunity
[06:51:57.450 --> 06:51:59.450]  to showcase like
[06:51:59.450 --> 06:52:01.450]  how we can do things grass roots
[06:52:01.450 --> 06:52:03.450]  without having huge corporations come in here
[06:52:03.450 --> 06:52:05.450]  and fuck everything up. Because
[06:52:05.450 --> 06:52:07.450]  dude I want to do this forever dude and
[06:52:07.450 --> 06:52:09.450]  we can all eat like everybody can eat
[06:52:09.450 --> 06:52:11.450]  you know there's a lot of licenses
[06:52:11.450 --> 06:52:13.450]  yeah but guess what all those licenses
[06:52:13.450 --> 06:52:15.450]  all those people can make money when they
[06:52:15.450 --> 06:52:17.450]  open up other states and stop
[06:52:17.450 --> 06:52:19.450]  you know it's like
[06:52:19.450 --> 06:52:21.450]  I keep hearing things about
[06:52:21.450 --> 06:52:23.450]  like oh there's so much competition
[06:52:23.450 --> 06:52:25.450]  and like it's like yeah there might be
[06:52:25.450 --> 06:52:27.450]  a lot of people that are entering into this
[06:52:27.450 --> 06:52:29.450]  but we can all collectively
[06:52:29.450 --> 06:52:31.450]  participate because
[06:52:31.450 --> 06:52:33.450]  we're all small craft
[06:52:33.450 --> 06:52:35.450]  growers right we're not
[06:52:35.450 --> 06:52:37.450]  huge corporations that can just hemorrhage
[06:52:37.450 --> 06:52:39.450]  money for years and we don't want
[06:52:39.450 --> 06:52:41.450]  that here you know because we see what it's
[06:52:41.450 --> 06:52:43.450]  done to
[06:52:43.450 --> 06:52:45.450]  the industry everywhere else
[06:52:45.450 --> 06:52:47.450]  and Oklahoma I've been here
[06:52:47.450 --> 06:52:49.450]  for two years now
[06:52:49.450 --> 06:52:51.450]  and I've seen
[06:52:51.450 --> 06:52:53.450]  it grow exponentially
[06:52:53.450 --> 06:52:55.450]  and people don't understand
[06:52:55.450 --> 06:52:57.450]  it's not just because
[06:52:57.450 --> 06:52:59.450]  of candidates it's because
[06:52:59.450 --> 06:53:01.450]  other people who are outside of Canada can come
[06:53:01.450 --> 06:53:03.450]  here and make a living because of the economic
[06:53:03.450 --> 06:53:05.450]  impact that Canada has brought
[06:53:05.450 --> 06:53:07.450]  all the ancillary businesses
[06:53:07.450 --> 06:53:09.450]  are all affected and I say this
[06:53:09.450 --> 06:53:11.450]  all the Honda people
[06:53:11.450 --> 06:53:13.450]  the HVAC guys the realtors
[06:53:13.450 --> 06:53:15.450]  the guys that are building soil
[06:53:15.450 --> 06:53:17.450]  the hydro shops there's so
[06:53:17.450 --> 06:53:19.450]  many different aspects in this community
[06:53:19.450 --> 06:53:21.450]  and then when people make money
[06:53:21.450 --> 06:53:23.450]  you know we go out to the
[06:53:23.450 --> 06:53:25.450]  to the restaurants you know
[06:53:25.450 --> 06:53:27.450]  we go and put money back into the economy
[06:53:27.450 --> 06:53:29.450]  and
[06:53:29.450 --> 06:53:31.450]  when you have companies
[06:53:31.450 --> 06:53:33.450]  come from
[06:53:33.450 --> 06:53:35.450]  that come from corporate interests
[06:53:35.450 --> 06:53:37.450]  come from like big money
[06:53:37.450 --> 06:53:39.450]  and they come from out of state
[06:53:39.450 --> 06:53:41.450]  they pay people shit wages
[06:53:41.450 --> 06:53:43.450]  you know
[06:53:43.450 --> 06:53:45.450]  and don't get me wrong dude
[06:53:45.450 --> 06:53:47.450]  I don't have I can't pay I can't afford
[06:53:47.450 --> 06:53:49.450]  to pay people a whole lot right now
[06:53:49.450 --> 06:53:51.450]  but at least we generate jobs and we try
[06:53:51.450 --> 06:53:53.450]  to do what we can for our people you know
[06:53:53.450 --> 06:53:55.450]  try to keep it chill
[06:53:55.450 --> 06:53:57.450]  and that's not
[06:53:57.450 --> 06:53:59.450]  really a concern for a lot of these companies
[06:53:59.450 --> 06:54:01.450]  it's the bottom the bottom line
[06:54:01.450 --> 06:54:03.450]  and
[06:54:03.450 --> 06:54:05.450]  you know I want to see
[06:54:05.450 --> 06:54:07.450]  I want to see Oklahoma continue
[06:54:07.450 --> 06:54:09.450]  to
[06:54:09.450 --> 06:54:11.450]  continue to prosper and
[06:54:11.450 --> 06:54:13.450]  the only way that we can do that is if we
[06:54:13.450 --> 06:54:15.450]  collectively come together do things
[06:54:15.450 --> 06:54:17.450]  meet each other you know
[06:54:17.450 --> 06:54:19.450]  and then start with those
[06:54:19.450 --> 06:54:21.450]  you know building up
[06:54:21.450 --> 06:54:23.450]  you know education
[06:54:23.450 --> 06:54:25.450]  building up the legal side of things
[06:54:25.450 --> 06:54:27.450]  like say you know we need to collectively
[06:54:27.450 --> 06:54:29.450]  know when things are happening you know
[06:54:29.450 --> 06:54:31.450]  people have to be informed
[06:54:31.450 --> 06:54:33.450]  about changes that are happening
[06:54:33.450 --> 06:54:35.450]  so we can say hey we don't like this
[06:54:35.450 --> 06:54:37.450]  we think you know like how many times have they
[06:54:37.450 --> 06:54:39.450]  tried to change daily style
[06:54:39.450 --> 06:54:41.450]  dispensaries you know
[06:54:41.450 --> 06:54:43.450]  obviously people want to see the medicine they want
[06:54:43.450 --> 06:54:45.450]  to smell the medicine how can you really be a good judge
[06:54:45.450 --> 06:54:47.450]  of what you're about to consume
[06:54:47.450 --> 06:54:49.450]  if you can't like have the experience
[06:54:49.450 --> 06:54:51.450]  and a lot of this was you know
[06:54:51.450 --> 06:54:53.450]  I don't think a lot of new people
[06:54:53.450 --> 06:54:55.450]  who may be in California are going to get
[06:54:55.450 --> 06:54:57.450]  the experience that we had
[06:54:57.450 --> 06:54:59.450]  back in the day when we got going to the
[06:54:59.450 --> 06:55:01.450]  medical shops we got to
[06:55:01.450 --> 06:55:03.450]  you know we could smell 10 different
[06:55:03.450 --> 06:55:05.450]  jars and kind of see what
[06:55:05.450 --> 06:55:07.450]  fit us so I want to keep it like
[06:55:07.450 --> 06:55:09.450]  that and you know
[06:55:09.450 --> 06:55:11.450]  I think that even though we have a lot of license I think
[06:55:11.450 --> 06:55:13.450]  that once Oklahoma opens up
[06:55:13.450 --> 06:55:15.450]  for export
[06:55:15.450 --> 06:55:17.450]  export to other states
[06:55:17.450 --> 06:55:19.450]  especially into new the emerging markets
[06:55:19.450 --> 06:55:21.450]  Texas you know
[06:55:21.450 --> 06:55:23.450]  for instance Arkansas
[06:55:23.450 --> 06:55:25.450]  Kansas
[06:55:25.450 --> 06:55:27.450]  you know if we can get
[06:55:27.450 --> 06:55:29.450]  sensible legislation in place
[06:55:29.450 --> 06:55:31.450]  and we can export product that will really
[06:55:31.450 --> 06:55:33.450]  boom the economy
[06:55:33.450 --> 06:55:35.450]  out here and you can see a lot
[06:55:35.450 --> 06:55:37.450]  of people prosper and just continue
[06:55:37.450 --> 06:55:39.450]  to see economic growth but it really takes
[06:55:39.450 --> 06:55:41.450]  again it takes community to be able to
[06:55:41.450 --> 06:55:43.450]  go in those types of
[06:55:43.450 --> 06:55:46.850]  directions
[06:55:46.850 --> 06:55:48.850]  Peter
[06:55:48.850 --> 06:55:50.850]  excuse me Peter we got a professor
[06:55:50.850 --> 06:55:52.850]  Blonstash in the house and he had a question
[06:55:52.850 --> 06:55:54.850]  so I just wanted to give him a quick shout out
[06:55:54.850 --> 06:55:56.850]  and let him ask his question
[06:55:56.850 --> 06:56:01.470]  Oh yeah what's up buddy
[06:56:01.470 --> 06:56:03.470]  What up? Hey I want to get back
[06:56:03.470 --> 06:56:05.470]  to the science for a quick second
[06:56:05.470 --> 06:56:07.470]  Yeah and you mentioned hydrology
[06:56:07.470 --> 06:56:09.470]  Yeah and I've been
[06:56:09.470 --> 06:56:11.470]  finding doing tasks with hydrology
[06:56:11.470 --> 06:56:13.470]  that the nutrients
[06:56:13.470 --> 06:56:15.470]  will not cycle the same
[06:56:15.470 --> 06:56:17.470]  for example running 70 mill bars
[06:56:17.470 --> 06:56:19.470]  and trying to keep that consistent
[06:56:19.470 --> 06:56:21.470]  and running another one at 100
[06:56:21.470 --> 06:56:23.470]  and of course the cold war has to do with it
[06:56:23.470 --> 06:56:25.470]  so have you done any data points
[06:56:25.470 --> 06:56:27.470]  with some of the hydrology
[06:56:27.470 --> 06:56:29.470]  and things like that? So right now
[06:56:29.470 --> 06:56:31.470]  we are still hand watering
[06:56:31.470 --> 06:56:33.470]  because we don't
[06:56:33.470 --> 06:56:35.470]  have a bump map system set up
[06:56:35.470 --> 06:56:37.470]  or we plan on doing that
[06:56:37.470 --> 06:56:39.470]  and that's one of the things that
[06:56:39.470 --> 06:56:41.470]  you know we'll be looking at
[06:56:41.470 --> 06:56:43.470]  however you know we
[06:56:43.470 --> 06:56:45.470]  we
[06:56:45.470 --> 06:56:47.470]  it's going to be hard
[06:56:47.470 --> 06:56:49.470]  to gauge I guess
[06:56:49.470 --> 06:56:51.470]  because we're going to have to set up
[06:56:51.470 --> 06:56:53.470]  and then we'll take a little bit of
[06:56:53.470 --> 06:56:55.470]  experimenting so we'll have to run
[06:56:55.470 --> 06:56:57.470]  you know
[06:56:57.470 --> 06:56:59.470]  the beds at a certain
[06:56:59.470 --> 06:57:01.470]  m bar through a whole cycle
[06:57:01.470 --> 06:57:03.470]  do a whole cycle of testing and then
[06:57:03.470 --> 06:57:05.470]  we'll have to go through and run
[06:57:05.470 --> 06:57:07.470]  at a different m bar to see what's available
[06:57:07.470 --> 06:57:09.470]  again you know I think it also has to do too
[06:57:09.470 --> 06:57:11.470]  with you know your water temp
[06:57:11.470 --> 06:57:13.470]  is going to play a lot to do
[06:57:13.470 --> 06:57:15.470]  with that because you know
[06:57:15.470 --> 06:57:17.470]  colder water will hold more oxygen
[06:57:17.470 --> 06:57:19.470]  which essentially means
[06:57:19.470 --> 06:57:21.470]  more hydrogen in solution
[06:57:21.470 --> 06:57:23.470]  and hydrogen is kind of
[06:57:23.470 --> 06:57:25.470]  you know
[06:57:25.470 --> 06:57:27.470]  important that's going to play a role
[06:57:27.470 --> 06:57:29.470]  in your pH
[06:57:29.470 --> 06:57:31.470]  again pH is going to be a factor
[06:57:31.470 --> 06:57:33.470]  but I just haven't
[06:57:33.470 --> 06:57:35.470]  I just don't have any data on that stuff
[06:57:35.470 --> 06:57:37.470]  right now you know
[06:57:37.470 --> 06:57:39.470]  but I see you know people who increase their yields
[06:57:39.470 --> 06:57:41.470]  when they're running
[06:57:41.470 --> 06:57:43.470]  a consistent moisture level
[06:57:43.470 --> 06:57:45.470]  throughout but I also
[06:57:45.470 --> 06:57:47.470]  you know there's also people who are doing
[06:57:47.470 --> 06:57:49.470]  their dry backs and stuff which I understand the concept
[06:57:49.470 --> 06:57:51.470]  of that too is you know once you're
[06:57:51.470 --> 06:57:53.470]  taking water out of that system
[06:57:53.470 --> 06:57:55.470]  you're leaving more of the hydrogen
[06:57:55.470 --> 06:57:57.470]  so there's more
[06:57:57.470 --> 06:57:59.470]  there's a higher cation exchange
[06:57:59.470 --> 06:58:01.470]  in that soil as the
[06:58:01.470 --> 06:58:03.470]  soil dries out but
[06:58:03.470 --> 06:58:05.470]  the thing is you need that water as well
[06:58:05.470 --> 06:58:07.470]  to be able to transport that
[06:58:07.470 --> 06:58:09.470]  so you have to have a happy medium
[06:58:11.470 --> 06:58:13.470]  so I'm willing to bet though
[06:58:15.470 --> 06:58:17.470]  that just
[06:58:17.470 --> 06:58:19.470]  because I'm thinking about it I'm willing to bet
[06:58:19.470 --> 06:58:21.470]  that
[06:58:21.470 --> 06:58:23.470]  that
[06:58:23.470 --> 06:58:25.470]  the PPMs
[06:58:25.470 --> 06:58:27.470]  of your soluble
[06:58:27.470 --> 06:58:29.470]  salts will play
[06:58:29.470 --> 06:58:31.470]  a huge role with your hydrology
[06:58:31.470 --> 06:58:33.470]  they'll play in tandem like
[06:58:33.470 --> 06:58:35.470]  if you have
[06:58:35.470 --> 06:58:37.470]  less
[06:58:37.470 --> 06:58:39.470]  water higher
[06:58:39.470 --> 06:58:41.470]  PPMs soluble salts
[06:58:41.470 --> 06:58:43.470]  you'll have a different effect if you add
[06:58:43.470 --> 06:58:45.470]  lower
[06:58:45.470 --> 06:58:47.470]  PPMs with
[06:58:47.470 --> 06:58:49.470]  you know lower water or more water
[06:58:49.470 --> 06:58:51.470]  I think that's going to play a different effect but again
[06:58:51.470 --> 06:58:53.470]  all these things are things that
[06:58:53.470 --> 06:58:55.470]  I'm trying to find out on data
[06:58:55.470 --> 06:58:57.470]  I have like my experiment box
[06:58:57.470 --> 06:58:59.470]  so I can see what's
[06:58:59.470 --> 06:59:01.470]  happening because it's
[06:59:01.470 --> 06:59:03.470]  a lot of information
[06:59:03.470 --> 06:59:05.470]  to look through
[06:59:05.470 --> 06:59:07.470]  really. I mean when you start
[06:59:07.470 --> 06:59:09.470]  thinking about trying to get
[06:59:09.470 --> 06:59:11.470]  all these data points I mean I used a couple
[06:59:11.470 --> 06:59:13.470]  different instruments I'm going to be honest
[06:59:13.470 --> 06:59:15.470]  the blue mat is plus or minus 10%
[06:59:15.470 --> 06:59:17.470]  20% all day I mean it's
[06:59:17.470 --> 06:59:19.470]  often the case but. Yeah I don't recommend
[06:59:19.470 --> 06:59:21.470]  I don't oh
[06:59:21.470 --> 06:59:23.470]  just the meter
[06:59:23.470 --> 06:59:25.470]  yeah the meter. The
[06:59:25.470 --> 06:59:27.470]  blue lab meter. Yeah the blue lab
[06:59:27.470 --> 06:59:29.470]  meter. Yeah.
[06:59:29.470 --> 06:59:31.470]  I'm not a big fan of them.
[06:59:31.470 --> 06:59:33.470]  Canada makes pretty good
[06:59:33.470 --> 06:59:35.470]  meters
[06:59:35.470 --> 06:59:37.470]  those are the ones I used in the past but
[06:59:37.470 --> 06:59:39.470]  the problem too is
[06:59:39.470 --> 06:59:41.470]  How about the hydrometer?
[06:59:41.470 --> 06:59:43.470]  So I
[06:59:43.470 --> 06:59:45.470]  have one and I never actually got to
[06:59:45.470 --> 06:59:47.470]  got around to using it
[06:59:47.470 --> 06:59:49.470]  it's a hydrometer to
[06:59:49.470 --> 06:59:51.470]  check
[06:59:51.470 --> 06:59:53.470]  the soil to water
[06:59:53.470 --> 06:59:55.470]  tension so you can use those
[06:59:55.470 --> 06:59:57.470]  and that basically tells you
[06:59:57.470 --> 06:59:59.470]  you know how difficult
[06:59:59.470 --> 07:00:01.470]  it's going to be for a plant
[07:00:01.470 --> 07:00:03.470]  to you know absorb
[07:00:03.470 --> 07:00:05.470]  that water. It basically measures
[07:00:05.470 --> 07:00:07.470]  water tension so
[07:00:07.470 --> 07:00:09.470]  but I haven't got to use it. I bought one and I was
[07:00:09.470 --> 07:00:11.470]  like I'm going to check all this and it's
[07:00:11.470 --> 07:00:13.470]  you know how
[07:00:13.470 --> 07:00:15.470]  I'm spread pretty thin right now. I have a lot
[07:00:15.470 --> 07:00:17.470]  going on so I'm just trying to catch everything up
[07:00:17.470 --> 07:00:19.470]  and all the time.
[07:00:19.470 --> 07:00:21.470]  I'm going to be honest so I just
[07:00:21.470 --> 07:00:23.470]  a couple notes and actually
[07:00:23.470 --> 07:00:25.470]  if you're going to put in a lot of these systems
[07:00:25.470 --> 07:00:27.470]  you're looking at putting in the urometer
[07:00:27.470 --> 07:00:29.470]  and you can kind of set up an engineering
[07:00:29.470 --> 07:00:31.470]  sort of system
[07:00:31.470 --> 07:00:33.470]  where you have pressure meters that
[07:00:33.470 --> 07:00:35.470]  rebuild the barn and it's just set up
[07:00:35.470 --> 07:00:37.470]  like any other sort of engineering system to
[07:00:37.470 --> 07:00:39.470]  a PLC and that's kind of
[07:00:39.470 --> 07:00:41.470]  like a way to do it but if you're trying to take meters
[07:00:41.470 --> 07:00:43.470]  and put them in, I've noticed I'm not getting
[07:00:43.470 --> 07:00:45.470]  accurate meters. Having them in place
[07:00:45.470 --> 07:00:47.470]  is kind of the way to prevent that.
[07:00:47.470 --> 07:00:49.470]  So just a couple notes. So what I've talked to
[07:00:49.470 --> 07:00:51.470]  a couple people who work in
[07:00:51.470 --> 07:00:53.470]  real time data collection and using scientific
[07:00:53.470 --> 07:00:55.470]  instrumentation, they've had a lot of
[07:00:55.470 --> 07:00:57.470]  trouble collecting
[07:00:57.470 --> 07:00:59.470]  accurate data because what happens
[07:00:59.470 --> 07:01:01.470]  is biofilms usually
[07:01:01.470 --> 07:01:03.470]  start to build
[07:01:03.470 --> 07:01:05.470]  up on the instrumentation and get
[07:01:05.470 --> 07:01:07.470]  false readings. So
[07:01:07.470 --> 07:01:09.470]  there's been some solutions where
[07:01:09.470 --> 07:01:11.470]  they'll use like a buffer
[07:01:11.470 --> 07:01:13.470]  or they'll use like a thin layer of like sand
[07:01:13.470 --> 07:01:15.470]  or something like that
[07:01:15.470 --> 07:01:17.470]  or like water for instance like that.
[07:01:17.470 --> 07:01:19.470]  But yeah
[07:01:19.470 --> 07:01:21.470]  when we do, when we set up
[07:01:21.470 --> 07:01:23.470]  our BlueMath systems we're going to use a water
[07:01:23.470 --> 07:01:25.470]  tension meter
[07:01:25.470 --> 07:01:27.470]  to set those
[07:01:27.470 --> 07:01:29.470]  things because that's ideally
[07:01:29.470 --> 07:01:31.470]  like
[07:01:31.470 --> 07:01:33.470]  I have
[07:01:33.470 --> 07:01:35.470]  18 to 24 inches of soil
[07:01:35.470 --> 07:01:37.470]  in the bed. 24 in one house,
[07:01:37.470 --> 07:01:39.470]  18 in the other house. So I need to be
[07:01:39.470 --> 07:01:41.470]  able to have that
[07:01:41.470 --> 07:01:43.470]  whole entire
[07:01:43.470 --> 07:01:45.470]  thing of soil
[07:01:45.470 --> 07:01:47.470]  be adequately
[07:01:47.470 --> 07:01:49.470]  hydrated consistently
[07:01:49.470 --> 07:01:51.470]  across the whole thing.
[07:01:51.470 --> 07:01:53.470]  So I'm not only going to just check one,
[07:01:53.470 --> 07:01:55.470]  I'm going to have to go and check all these different areas
[07:01:55.470 --> 07:01:57.470]  in the bed to make sure the water tension
[07:01:57.470 --> 07:01:59.470]  is where it needs to be before
[07:01:59.470 --> 07:02:01.470]  I start plugging in those carrots and
[07:02:01.470 --> 07:02:03.470]  setting those carrots in because I don't think
[07:02:03.470 --> 07:02:05.470]  it would be, it's going to be better to
[07:02:05.470 --> 07:02:07.470]  use another data point as opposed
[07:02:07.470 --> 07:02:09.470]  to me just going in and watering and saying
[07:02:09.470 --> 07:02:11.470]  oh this feels good.
[07:02:11.470 --> 07:02:13.470]  I have to dig in there and
[07:02:13.470 --> 07:02:15.470]  make sure that everything is good
[07:02:15.470 --> 07:02:17.470]  or use
[07:02:17.470 --> 07:02:19.470]  a scientific instrument that does it
[07:02:19.470 --> 07:02:21.470]  for me and just says hey
[07:02:21.470 --> 07:02:23.470]  this is where you're at.
[07:02:23.470 --> 07:02:25.470]  That's what I like because it gives me
[07:02:25.470 --> 07:02:27.470]  more fool proof for me.
[07:02:27.470 --> 07:02:29.470]  It eliminates a lot of the guessing because
[07:02:29.470 --> 07:02:31.470]  I've been doing this a long time
[07:02:31.470 --> 07:02:33.470]  and I've grown great weed but
[07:02:33.470 --> 07:02:35.470]  I don't want
[07:02:35.470 --> 07:02:37.470]  when you're going at scale
[07:02:37.470 --> 07:02:39.470]  it's just got to be consistent all the way through.
[07:02:39.470 --> 07:02:41.470]  I don't want any hiccups.
[07:02:41.470 --> 07:02:43.470]  You can have
[07:02:45.470 --> 07:02:47.470]  you can have things
[07:02:47.470 --> 07:02:49.470]  shift and
[07:02:49.470 --> 07:02:51.470]  be different if you're not
[07:02:51.470 --> 07:02:53.470]  consistently on top
[07:02:53.470 --> 07:02:55.470]  of the data collection.
[07:02:55.470 --> 07:02:57.470]  It's like I've had pots before
[07:02:57.470 --> 07:02:59.470]  I started testing
[07:02:59.470 --> 07:03:01.470]  data that I overloaded with
[07:03:01.470 --> 07:03:03.470]  top-dose supplements and I couldn't figure out
[07:03:03.470 --> 07:03:05.470]  what was going on. All these things are
[07:03:05.470 --> 07:03:07.470]  prematurely
[07:03:07.470 --> 07:03:09.470]  looking like they're maybe nitrogen
[07:03:09.470 --> 07:03:11.470]  but it's like they can't possibly be
[07:03:11.470 --> 07:03:13.470]  nitrogen or it looks like
[07:03:13.470 --> 07:03:15.470]  they need magnesium but
[07:03:15.470 --> 07:03:17.470]  I put in all the steps and saw what's going on
[07:03:17.470 --> 07:03:19.470]  and it really just shows
[07:03:19.470 --> 07:03:21.470]  the imbalances that can be in there
[07:03:21.470 --> 07:03:23.470]  and how it fits that.
[07:03:23.470 --> 07:03:25.470]  So it just takes the guess work out.
[07:03:25.470 --> 07:03:27.470]  I also have
[07:03:27.470 --> 07:03:29.470]  this one more note.
[07:03:29.470 --> 07:03:31.470]  Good points by the way.
[07:03:31.470 --> 07:03:33.470]  One more question. So do you ever do
[07:03:33.470 --> 07:03:35.470]  water to run off?
[07:03:35.470 --> 07:03:37.470]  No. Or maybe for just
[07:03:37.470 --> 07:03:39.470]  certain things or do you just
[07:03:39.470 --> 07:03:41.470]  keep it all balanced and make sure
[07:03:41.470 --> 07:03:43.470]  nothing gets into the system?
[07:03:43.470 --> 07:03:45.470]  In these types of
[07:03:45.470 --> 07:03:47.470]  systems, when we're
[07:03:47.470 --> 07:03:49.470]  talking about systems that are just
[07:03:49.470 --> 07:03:51.470]  sufficiently balanced,
[07:03:51.470 --> 07:03:53.470]  there's only a couple of times where you would want
[07:03:53.470 --> 07:03:55.470]  to flush out the system. And that's when
[07:03:55.470 --> 07:03:57.470]  there's been a toxic buildup
[07:03:57.470 --> 07:03:59.470]  and that's typically going to be something like sodium
[07:03:59.470 --> 07:04:01.470]  bicarbonate.
[07:04:01.470 --> 07:04:03.470]  So
[07:04:03.470 --> 07:04:05.470]  sodium is a major cation.
[07:04:05.470 --> 07:04:07.470]  You're going to find it in soil but you want to keep it
[07:04:07.470 --> 07:04:09.470]  really low. Across
[07:04:09.470 --> 07:04:11.470]  the board typically in
[07:04:11.470 --> 07:04:13.470]  organic agriculture, especially
[07:04:13.470 --> 07:04:15.470]  cannabis, the use of
[07:04:15.470 --> 07:04:17.470]  sea inputs has been
[07:04:17.470 --> 07:04:19.470]  highly used. And so what I
[07:04:19.470 --> 07:04:21.470]  typically see is someone who will go and build
[07:04:21.470 --> 07:04:23.470]  a soil, like a
[07:04:23.470 --> 07:04:25.470]  super soil for instance, and they'll load it up
[07:04:25.470 --> 07:04:27.470]  with things like kelp
[07:04:27.470 --> 07:04:29.470]  and crab meal, crustacean
[07:04:29.470 --> 07:04:31.470]  meal, oyster
[07:04:31.470 --> 07:04:33.470]  shell, and then
[07:04:33.470 --> 07:04:35.470]  maybe add some
[07:04:35.470 --> 07:04:37.470]  sea
[07:04:37.470 --> 07:04:39.470]  90,
[07:04:39.470 --> 07:04:41.470]  sea minerals and stuff.
[07:04:41.470 --> 07:04:43.470]  And what will typically
[07:04:43.470 --> 07:04:45.470]  happen is
[07:04:45.470 --> 07:04:47.470]  they bring in a lot
[07:04:47.470 --> 07:04:49.470]  of sodium. Sodium is
[07:04:49.470 --> 07:04:51.470]  super antagonistic.
[07:04:51.470 --> 07:04:53.470]  It's the most antagonistic
[07:04:53.470 --> 07:04:55.470]  cation there is.
[07:04:55.470 --> 07:04:57.470]  And so when your
[07:04:57.470 --> 07:04:59.470]  levels start to increase, it
[07:04:59.470 --> 07:05:01.470]  takes away the plant's ability
[07:05:01.470 --> 07:05:03.470]  to absorb the calcium,
[07:05:03.470 --> 07:05:05.470]  the magnesium, and the potassium.
[07:05:05.470 --> 07:05:07.470]  So keeping those low
[07:05:07.470 --> 07:05:09.470]  is going to improve
[07:05:09.470 --> 07:05:11.470]  your ability for the
[07:05:11.470 --> 07:05:13.470]  plant to sequester those nutrients.
[07:05:13.470 --> 07:05:15.470]  You know?
[07:05:15.470 --> 07:05:17.470]  Do you think
[07:05:17.470 --> 07:05:19.470]  will sodium naturally
[07:05:19.470 --> 07:05:21.470]  build up over time?
[07:05:21.470 --> 07:05:23.470]  Will you eventually just have to flush it back
[07:05:23.470 --> 07:05:25.470]  or something? I haven't
[07:05:25.470 --> 07:05:27.470]  seen it, but the thing is I'm not adding any
[07:05:27.470 --> 07:05:29.470]  sodium as far as
[07:05:29.470 --> 07:05:31.470]  that are in my inputs. Because I stopped
[07:05:31.470 --> 07:05:33.470]  using things like kelp. I stopped using
[07:05:33.470 --> 07:05:35.470]  meals because meals typically
[07:05:35.470 --> 07:05:37.470]  have, like let's take
[07:05:37.470 --> 07:05:39.470]  crab meal for instance. It's typically
[07:05:39.470 --> 07:05:41.470]  something like
[07:05:41.470 --> 07:05:43.470]  2% nitrogen,
[07:05:43.470 --> 07:05:45.470]  maybe 4%
[07:05:45.470 --> 07:05:47.470]  phosphorus, and maybe
[07:05:47.470 --> 07:05:49.470]  1% potassium, or something like
[07:05:49.470 --> 07:05:51.470]  that. Take that for instance.
[07:05:51.470 --> 07:05:53.470]  Now I might not be deficient in potassium.
[07:05:53.470 --> 07:05:55.470]  I might not be deficient in nitrogen.
[07:05:55.470 --> 07:05:57.470]  I just need phosphorus. So what I do
[07:05:57.470 --> 07:05:59.470]  is I go to a single mineral input instead of
[07:05:59.470 --> 07:06:01.470]  a meal because the meals
[07:06:01.470 --> 07:06:03.470]  only make sense to me
[07:06:03.470 --> 07:06:05.470]  on a standpoint if I'm deficient
[07:06:05.470 --> 07:06:07.470]  in the need to get all those elements
[07:06:07.470 --> 07:06:09.470]  that that thing possesses into
[07:06:09.470 --> 07:06:11.470]  the system. That's why
[07:06:11.470 --> 07:06:13.470]  I opt for single mineral
[07:06:13.470 --> 07:06:15.470]  inputs and most of them are water soluble.
[07:06:15.470 --> 07:06:17.470]  So when you contrast,
[07:06:17.470 --> 07:06:19.470]  they're going to go into that system
[07:06:19.470 --> 07:06:21.470]  and they're going to become available.
[07:06:21.470 --> 07:06:25.120]  I do
[07:06:25.120 --> 07:06:27.120]  have one more quick question.
[07:06:27.120 --> 07:06:29.120]  Kind of pertaining to that.
[07:06:29.120 --> 07:06:31.120]  As we shift more towards
[07:06:31.120 --> 07:06:33.120]  having irrigation
[07:06:33.120 --> 07:06:35.120]  systems, I'm a person
[07:06:35.120 --> 07:06:37.120]  looking into this,
[07:06:37.120 --> 07:06:39.120]  if we're not doing
[07:06:39.120 --> 07:06:41.120]  top watering, I'm concerned about
[07:06:41.120 --> 07:06:43.120]  my mulch, first off,
[07:06:43.120 --> 07:06:45.120]  in my system not being properly broken down
[07:06:45.120 --> 07:06:47.120]  or top dressings not getting properly
[07:06:47.120 --> 07:06:49.120]  moistened from the system
[07:06:49.120 --> 07:06:51.120]  not having as good a dispersion.
[07:06:51.120 --> 07:06:53.120]  Yeah. I mean
[07:06:53.120 --> 07:06:55.120]  most of
[07:06:55.120 --> 07:06:57.120]  I don't really know anybody
[07:06:57.120 --> 07:06:59.120]  who's growing cannabis
[07:06:59.120 --> 07:07:01.120]  aside from some people who do the
[07:07:01.120 --> 07:07:03.120]  irrigated planters that aren't
[07:07:03.120 --> 07:07:05.120]  top watering.
[07:07:05.120 --> 07:07:07.120]  So
[07:07:07.120 --> 07:07:09.120]  that being said, it's kind of
[07:07:09.120 --> 07:07:11.120]  standard across the
[07:07:11.120 --> 07:07:13.120]  board for organics that people
[07:07:13.120 --> 07:07:15.120]  use top dresses.
[07:07:15.120 --> 07:07:17.120]  So what
[07:07:17.120 --> 07:07:19.120]  was the question though? Sorry.
[07:07:19.120 --> 07:07:21.120]  Do you think
[07:07:21.120 --> 07:07:23.120]  that there's going to be challenges
[07:07:23.120 --> 07:07:25.120]  to getting a proper
[07:07:25.120 --> 07:07:27.120]  dispersion once we switch to these systems?
[07:07:27.120 --> 07:07:29.120]  I feel like
[07:07:29.120 --> 07:07:31.120]  single drippers are not going to
[07:07:31.120 --> 07:07:33.120]  do the same effects. We're going to have a different
[07:07:33.120 --> 07:07:35.120]  cycling of the nutrients
[07:07:35.120 --> 07:07:37.120]  because some of this stuff is just not breaking down.
[07:07:37.120 --> 07:07:39.120]  It's not moist. It's not soiled blood.
[07:07:39.120 --> 07:07:41.120]  You definitely want to keep
[07:07:41.120 --> 07:07:43.120]  adequate moisture levels in the system
[07:07:43.120 --> 07:07:45.120]  for them to function properly.
[07:07:45.120 --> 07:07:47.120]  That is a huge thing. I understand what you're
[07:07:47.120 --> 07:07:49.120]  saying. We're just
[07:07:49.120 --> 07:07:51.120]  hooking up our dripper systems.
[07:07:51.120 --> 07:07:53.120]  Cody over here has been helping out at the farm.
[07:07:53.120 --> 07:07:55.120]  And
[07:07:55.120 --> 07:07:57.120]  the thing is
[07:07:57.120 --> 07:07:59.120]  if you had
[07:07:59.120 --> 07:08:01.120]  like with the drippers that we had, if we had
[07:08:01.120 --> 07:08:03.120]  a lot larger size pot,
[07:08:03.120 --> 07:08:05.120]  it wouldn't work because there's a lot
[07:08:05.120 --> 07:08:07.120]  more surface area that needs to be
[07:08:07.120 --> 07:08:09.120]  wet and it wouldn't be adequate.
[07:08:09.120 --> 07:08:11.120]  The thing is we selected
[07:08:11.120 --> 07:08:13.120]  a size bag with the amount
[07:08:13.120 --> 07:08:15.120]  of soil that's going to be adequate
[07:08:15.120 --> 07:08:17.120]  to use with a drip system.
[07:08:19.120 --> 07:08:21.120]  So it's just
[07:08:21.120 --> 07:08:23.120]  you kind of have to make sure that you
[07:08:23.120 --> 07:08:25.120]  have what you need
[07:08:25.120 --> 07:08:27.120]  as far as those
[07:08:27.120 --> 07:08:29.120]  kind of things.
[07:08:29.120 --> 07:08:31.120]  But as far as
[07:08:31.120 --> 07:08:33.120]  watering to runoff, I don't recommend
[07:08:33.120 --> 07:08:35.120]  watering to runoff because oftentimes
[07:08:35.120 --> 07:08:37.120]  you'll rinse out
[07:08:37.120 --> 07:08:39.120]  essential mineral elements that are in the
[07:08:39.120 --> 07:08:41.120]  system. I only recommend it to people
[07:08:41.120 --> 07:08:43.120]  who are trying to flush out
[07:08:43.120 --> 07:08:45.120]  like a salty system. And I'll typically
[07:08:45.120 --> 07:08:47.120]  have them do something like
[07:08:47.120 --> 07:08:49.120]  add gypsum to the system
[07:08:49.120 --> 07:08:51.120]  and then do the flush and then
[07:08:51.120 --> 07:08:53.120]  go and remineralize after you've
[07:08:53.120 --> 07:08:55.120]  thoroughly flushed the system to bring it up
[07:08:55.120 --> 07:08:57.120]  to sufficiency and balance.
[07:08:57.120 --> 07:09:00.910]  Any other questions
[07:09:00.910 --> 07:09:04.630]  you guys?
[07:09:04.630 --> 07:09:06.630]  I was just texting Peter
[07:09:06.630 --> 07:09:08.630]  real quick to see.
[07:09:08.630 --> 07:09:10.630]  Tell Peter I said hi.
[07:09:10.630 --> 07:09:12.630]  Tell everybody in chat
[07:09:12.630 --> 07:09:14.630]  I said hello.
[07:09:14.630 --> 07:09:16.630]  At some point I'll have more
[07:09:16.630 --> 07:09:18.630]  time to hop on there when you guys
[07:09:18.630 --> 07:09:20.630]  are doing lives and get in there and interact.
[07:09:20.630 --> 07:09:22.630]  Yeah.
[07:09:22.630 --> 07:09:24.630]  Talk about some of the social media.
[07:09:24.630 --> 07:09:26.630]  I know you're a man
[07:09:26.630 --> 07:09:28.630]  that is in high demand.
[07:09:28.630 --> 07:09:30.630]  And the reason for that is
[07:09:30.630 --> 07:09:32.630]  what you just displayed.
[07:09:32.630 --> 07:09:34.630]  I know that you've just been featured on
[07:09:34.630 --> 07:09:36.630]  Mr. Grow It. I know there's other
[07:09:36.630 --> 07:09:38.630]  which I feel like
[07:09:38.630 --> 07:09:40.630]  shout out to them because I feel like he's
[07:09:40.630 --> 07:09:42.630]  pumping out a lot of information that's being
[07:09:42.630 --> 07:09:44.630]  seen. And then
[07:09:44.630 --> 07:09:46.630]  talk about maybe some of the other
[07:09:46.630 --> 07:09:48.630]  podcasts I might not also be familiar with.
[07:09:48.630 --> 07:09:50.630]  Sure. So, you know,
[07:09:50.630 --> 07:09:52.630]  I get a lot of requests to do
[07:09:52.630 --> 07:09:54.630]  education stuff.
[07:09:54.630 --> 07:09:56.630]  And I don't mind doing it. I like to help out
[07:09:56.630 --> 07:09:58.630]  where I can. Growcast
[07:09:58.630 --> 07:10:00.630]  is one of the podcasts that you can find
[07:10:00.630 --> 07:10:02.630]  me on. I have a couple episodes
[07:10:02.630 --> 07:10:04.630]  that talk about coffee,
[07:10:04.630 --> 07:10:06.630]  green waste, recycling, which is
[07:10:06.630 --> 07:10:08.630]  something that we're not going to touch on tonight.
[07:10:10.630 --> 07:10:12.630]  Also Growcast,
[07:10:12.630 --> 07:10:14.630]  Future Cannabis Project.
[07:10:16.630 --> 07:10:18.630]  Also Cheap Home Grow
[07:10:18.630 --> 07:10:20.630]  podcast. We do that every Sunday
[07:10:20.630 --> 07:10:22.630]  evening with a panel.
[07:10:22.630 --> 07:10:24.630]  And it's, you know, just that's kind of
[07:10:24.630 --> 07:10:26.630]  bullshitting back and forth, talking about
[07:10:26.630 --> 07:10:28.630]  different growth styles,
[07:10:28.630 --> 07:10:30.630]  home growing, and ways that people
[07:10:30.630 --> 07:10:32.630]  can improve what they're doing
[07:10:32.630 --> 07:10:34.630]  at home if you want to cultivate your own
[07:10:34.630 --> 07:10:36.630]  medicine, which
[07:10:36.630 --> 07:10:38.630]  I am a huge advocate
[07:10:38.630 --> 07:10:40.630]  for. I think that everybody
[07:10:40.630 --> 07:10:42.630]  should at least give it a shot.
[07:10:42.630 --> 07:10:44.630]  I mean, I know it's not going to be for everybody,
[07:10:44.630 --> 07:10:46.630]  but
[07:10:46.630 --> 07:10:48.630]  it's something I highly advocate.
[07:10:48.630 --> 07:10:50.630]  I think that once people
[07:10:50.630 --> 07:10:52.630]  have the understanding of
[07:10:52.630 --> 07:10:54.630]  what it is and they grow it themselves
[07:10:54.630 --> 07:10:56.630]  and they're able to nurture that
[07:10:56.630 --> 07:10:58.630]  and reap the benefit,
[07:10:58.630 --> 07:11:00.630]  it can have a good positive
[07:11:00.630 --> 07:11:02.630]  impact on their
[07:11:02.630 --> 07:11:04.630]  mindset.
[07:11:04.630 --> 07:11:06.630]  Yeah, so those are the
[07:11:06.630 --> 07:11:08.630]  major ones, future cannabis. I did a
[07:11:08.630 --> 07:11:10.630]  really good episode on
[07:11:10.630 --> 07:11:12.630]  biological crops here. I kind
[07:11:12.630 --> 07:11:14.630]  of touch on different microbes
[07:11:14.630 --> 07:11:16.630]  and kind of just the
[07:11:16.630 --> 07:11:18.630]  methodology that I've been using.
[07:11:18.630 --> 07:11:20.630]  I learn every day, man. I mean, I
[07:11:20.630 --> 07:11:22.630]  take tests, so
[07:11:22.630 --> 07:11:24.630]  the more that I know, the more I'll be
[07:11:24.630 --> 07:11:26.630]  able to share and just keep doing this.
[07:11:26.630 --> 07:11:28.630]  Again, I'm humbled to be here because
[07:11:28.630 --> 07:11:30.630]  I'm just some random dude. I just happen to be
[07:11:30.630 --> 07:11:32.630]  growing weed for a long
[07:11:32.630 --> 07:11:34.630]  time, doing a bunch of illegal shit like
[07:11:34.630 --> 07:11:36.630]  most people didn't, but
[07:11:36.630 --> 07:11:38.630]  it ended up turning out all right
[07:11:38.630 --> 07:11:40.630]  for me, so I just
[07:11:40.630 --> 07:11:42.630]  ran with it.
[07:11:42.630 --> 07:11:44.630]  Excellent.
[07:11:44.630 --> 07:11:46.630]  Like I said, man,
[07:11:46.630 --> 07:11:48.630]  I'm sure more and more people, especially as we continue
[07:11:48.630 --> 07:11:50.630]  to put out content, they're going to
[07:11:50.630 --> 07:11:52.630]  learn more about you, some
[07:11:52.630 --> 07:11:54.630]  of your ideas and stuff like that, and that's the
[07:11:54.630 --> 07:11:56.630]  great part about you, man, is you're putting out content.
[07:11:56.630 --> 07:11:58.630]  It seems like weekly now.
[07:11:58.630 --> 07:12:00.630]  Yeah, I try to do
[07:12:00.630 --> 07:12:02.630]  what I can. I would
[07:12:02.630 --> 07:12:04.630]  like to focus a little bit more, but my
[07:12:04.630 --> 07:12:06.630]  priorities are all over the place
[07:12:06.630 --> 07:12:08.630]  right now. Just
[07:12:08.630 --> 07:12:10.630]  spread pretty thin, so
[07:12:10.630 --> 07:12:12.630]  I'll be doing more of that. I'll be doing
[07:12:12.630 --> 07:12:14.630]  a lot of education through the Bill Cosby Earthworks
[07:12:14.630 --> 07:12:16.630]  IG page.
[07:12:16.630 --> 07:12:18.630]  You can also find me at russ.brandon.ig.
[07:12:18.630 --> 07:12:20.630]  I've got to give a huge
[07:12:20.630 --> 07:12:22.630]  shout out to Carly over there,
[07:12:22.630 --> 07:12:24.630]  who's my hugest
[07:12:24.630 --> 07:12:26.630]  supporter, and she
[07:12:26.630 --> 07:12:28.630]  helps out in so many
[07:12:28.630 --> 07:12:30.630]  other ways, as well as my business partners
[07:12:30.630 --> 07:12:32.630]  and all the people that
[07:12:32.630 --> 07:12:34.630]  I work with on a consulting basis
[07:12:34.630 --> 07:12:36.630]  and any kind of
[07:12:36.630 --> 07:12:38.630]  contractual basis. These people
[07:12:38.630 --> 07:12:40.630]  are the people that have gotten me to
[07:12:40.630 --> 07:12:42.630]  where I'm at, and
[07:12:42.630 --> 07:12:44.630]  I appreciate it all.
[07:12:44.630 --> 07:12:46.630]  That's right, man.
[07:12:46.630 --> 07:12:48.630]  I know that you're giving me an inspiration
[07:12:48.630 --> 07:12:50.630]  for a lot of people out there that are just trying to
[07:12:50.630 --> 07:12:52.630]  understand this and be self-taught
[07:12:52.630 --> 07:12:54.630]  because
[07:12:54.630 --> 07:12:56.630]  you're showing that you can pave the way.
[07:12:56.630 --> 07:12:58.630]  It was just a few years ago that we
[07:12:58.630 --> 07:13:00.630]  were talking on the phone where you were talking about
[07:13:00.630 --> 07:13:02.630]  I'm coming to Oklahoma and I'm going to take over.
[07:13:02.630 --> 07:13:04.630]  Yeah, it's really interesting
[07:13:04.630 --> 07:13:06.630]  because we met.
[07:13:06.630 --> 07:13:08.630]  We knew Brian before
[07:13:08.630 --> 07:13:10.630]  I came out to
[07:13:10.630 --> 07:13:12.630]  Oklahoma.
[07:13:12.630 --> 07:13:14.630]  Probably about eight or nine months
[07:13:14.630 --> 07:13:16.630]  before I even got out here, and I'm saying,
[07:13:16.630 --> 07:13:18.630]  I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, this, this, and I
[07:13:18.630 --> 07:13:20.630]  just try to stay focused
[07:13:20.630 --> 07:13:22.630]  and follow through with
[07:13:22.630 --> 07:13:24.630]  the plan. I appreciate it
[07:13:24.630 --> 07:13:26.630]  and I wouldn't be here without the support
[07:13:26.630 --> 07:13:28.630]  of the people who
[07:13:28.630 --> 07:13:30.630]  support me through purchasing
[07:13:30.630 --> 07:13:32.630]  my products, buying seeds
[07:13:32.630 --> 07:13:34.630]  from me,
[07:13:34.630 --> 07:13:36.630]  buying weed from the dispensaries
[07:13:36.630 --> 07:13:38.630]  that came from our farms.
[07:13:38.630 --> 07:13:40.630]  All that stuff matters and
[07:13:40.630 --> 07:13:42.630]  it's the reason why I can stand up here
[07:13:42.630 --> 07:13:44.630]  because, I mean,
[07:13:44.630 --> 07:13:46.630]  don't get me wrong, dude, it's a struggle. A lot of people
[07:13:46.630 --> 07:13:48.630]  only get to see
[07:13:48.630 --> 07:13:50.630]  all the good stuff, all the happy
[07:13:50.630 --> 07:13:52.630]  stuff, but it's been a
[07:13:52.630 --> 07:13:54.630]  huge learning curve.
[07:13:54.630 --> 07:13:56.630]  Having a business,
[07:13:56.630 --> 07:13:58.630]  being able to learn
[07:13:58.630 --> 07:14:00.630]  how to communicate with people is a huge
[07:14:00.630 --> 07:14:02.630]  thing because
[07:14:02.630 --> 07:14:04.630]  a lot of us don't come from,
[07:14:04.630 --> 07:14:06.630]  I come from just a solo
[07:14:06.630 --> 07:14:08.630]  act. With one partner, we did everything
[07:14:08.630 --> 07:14:10.630]  ourselves and it comes to, like, you have
[07:14:10.630 --> 07:14:12.630]  to deal with whole teams
[07:14:12.630 --> 07:14:14.630]  of people. So it can
[07:14:14.630 --> 07:14:16.630]  be difficult, man. It's
[07:14:16.630 --> 07:14:18.630]  no small feat to be able to do
[07:14:18.630 --> 07:14:20.630]  this and a lot of people,
[07:14:20.630 --> 07:14:22.630]  they struggle,
[07:14:22.630 --> 07:14:24.630]  we struggle,
[07:14:24.630 --> 07:14:26.630]  but it's all about just making the
[07:14:26.630 --> 07:14:28.630]  best of what you have and
[07:14:28.630 --> 07:14:30.630]  putting your best foot forward and
[07:14:30.630 --> 07:14:32.630]  staying persistent.
[07:14:32.630 --> 07:14:34.630]  Passion goes a long way, I think, in
[07:14:34.630 --> 07:14:36.630]  cannabis.
[07:14:36.630 --> 07:14:38.630]  Yeah, and just real quick
[07:14:38.630 --> 07:14:40.630]  before we wrap up, I feel like everybody,
[07:14:40.630 --> 07:14:42.630]  especially for you guys,
[07:14:42.630 --> 07:14:44.630]  this is kind of the marathon stuff
[07:14:44.630 --> 07:14:46.630]  that I hope, you know,
[07:14:46.630 --> 07:14:48.630]  we're at seven hours here,
[07:14:48.630 --> 07:14:50.630]  but this is seven hours that's going to be out there
[07:14:50.630 --> 07:14:52.630]  forever and I feel like, you know, there's
[07:14:52.630 --> 07:14:54.630]  time stamps that'll be out there and stuff so that we
[07:14:54.630 --> 07:14:56.630]  can continue to come back on this.
[07:14:56.630 --> 07:14:58.630]  And I feel like more and more of the suits, if you will,
[07:14:58.630 --> 07:15:00.630]  they're going to see that we're putting out quality content
[07:15:00.630 --> 07:15:02.630]  and there's people like you guys that are coming
[07:15:02.630 --> 07:15:04.630]  through and wanting to learn more about that.
[07:15:04.630 --> 07:15:06.630]  So quickly I wanted to give a shout out
[07:15:06.630 --> 07:15:08.630]  again to Apco Med for really putting
[07:15:08.630 --> 07:15:10.630]  this together with me behind the scenes.
[07:15:10.630 --> 07:15:12.630]  Reggie and Ray,
[07:15:12.630 --> 07:15:14.630]  and the soil is really
[07:15:14.630 --> 07:15:16.630]  held down in the pitch.
[07:15:16.630 --> 07:15:18.630]  If anything feels like my dream, there's more.
[07:15:18.630 --> 07:15:20.630]  Fantastic product guys.
[07:15:20.630 --> 07:15:22.630]  I was able to smoke their stuff. I've never
[07:15:22.630 --> 07:15:24.630]  tried that before and
[07:15:24.630 --> 07:15:26.630]  you guys are doing it right.
[07:15:26.630 --> 07:15:28.630]  So congratulations for that
[07:15:28.630 --> 07:15:30.630]  because I know that you're going to definitely stand out
[07:15:30.630 --> 07:15:32.630]  here in this state.
[07:15:32.630 --> 07:15:34.630]  Shout out to Ascent Cannabis
[07:15:34.630 --> 07:15:36.630]  and shout out to Boho
[07:15:38.630 --> 07:15:40.630]  Health Coach.
[07:15:40.630 --> 07:15:42.630]  I think she might have slipped out.
[07:15:42.630 --> 07:15:44.630]  There she is back in the corner.
[07:15:44.630 --> 07:15:46.630]  And shout out to Terry as well.
[07:15:46.630 --> 07:15:48.630]  Terry's Collective, Danny.
[07:15:48.630 --> 07:15:50.630]  Just a lot of people that were a part of this
[07:15:50.630 --> 07:15:52.630]  and all of our speakers.
[07:15:52.630 --> 07:15:54.630]  Just everybody that was,
[07:15:54.630 --> 07:15:56.630]  you know, came out and made
[07:15:56.630 --> 07:15:58.630]  this an event that I feel like
[07:15:58.630 --> 07:16:00.630]  a lot of us are from different states.
[07:16:00.630 --> 07:16:02.630]  So to have one location
[07:16:02.630 --> 07:16:04.630]  where we could all meet up.
[07:16:04.630 --> 07:16:06.630]  Shout out to you again buddy. I think you
[07:16:06.630 --> 07:16:08.630]  are the ball guess one.
[07:16:08.630 --> 07:16:10.630]  So Peter, I know that we're always
[07:16:10.630 --> 07:16:12.630]  talking about being international
[07:16:12.630 --> 07:16:14.630]  but we definitely had a gentleman drop
[07:16:14.630 --> 07:16:16.630]  from Chicago
[07:16:16.630 --> 07:16:18.630]  to Tulsa, Oklahoma for the event.
[07:16:18.630 --> 07:16:20.630]  So a little
[07:16:20.630 --> 07:16:22.630]  applause for this gentleman.
[07:16:22.630 --> 07:16:24.630]  I think that's the furthest.
[07:16:24.630 --> 07:16:26.630]  Thanks to you Brian.
[07:16:26.630 --> 07:16:28.630]  We really appreciate all the love and work
[07:16:28.630 --> 07:16:30.630]  you put into this.
[07:16:30.630 --> 07:16:32.630]  It's a wacky thing, first year
[07:16:32.630 --> 07:16:34.630]  trying to do stuff and here's
[07:16:34.630 --> 07:16:36.630]  to your, what I
[07:16:36.630 --> 07:16:38.630]  would say, courage. It reminds me
[07:16:38.630 --> 07:16:40.630]  of the old Terrence McKinney quote that nature
[07:16:40.630 --> 07:16:42.630]  loves courage. So well played
[07:16:42.630 --> 07:16:44.630]  and I just want to remind people
[07:16:44.630 --> 07:16:46.630]  that we've got four DJs coming in as
[07:16:46.630 --> 07:16:48.630]  late as you all want to go.
[07:16:48.630 --> 07:16:50.630]  So we've still got that aspect
[07:16:50.630 --> 07:16:52.630]  of it if you're
[07:16:52.630 --> 07:16:54.630]  a pro. So thank you all.
[07:16:56.630 --> 07:16:58.630]  Alright.
[07:16:58.630 --> 07:17:00.630]  So
[07:17:00.630 --> 07:17:02.630]  we're going to
[07:17:02.630 --> 07:17:04.630]  end our night as well and
[07:17:04.630 --> 07:17:06.630]  continue to network and build a
[07:17:06.630 --> 07:17:08.630]  living soil community
[07:17:08.630 --> 07:17:10.630]  here in Oklahoma.
[07:17:34.270 --> 07:17:36.270]  Evidently we wrapped up.
[07:17:36.270 --> 07:17:38.270]  Gemma, come here and say hi.
[07:17:38.270 --> 07:17:40.270]  Hi.
[07:17:40.270 --> 07:17:42.270]  Did you have fun
[07:17:42.270 --> 07:17:44.270]  with mommy?
[07:17:44.270 --> 07:17:46.270]  We went to a party, I went in the pool
[07:17:46.270 --> 07:17:48.270]  three times.
[07:17:48.270 --> 07:17:50.270]  That's a much better
[07:17:50.270 --> 07:17:52.270]  afternoon than I had.
[07:17:52.270 --> 07:17:54.270]  So, baby girl, by the way,
[07:17:54.270 --> 07:17:56.270]  what is this?
[07:17:56.270 --> 07:17:58.270]  My artwork.
[07:17:58.270 --> 07:18:00.270]  It's a picture of
[07:18:00.270 --> 07:18:02.270]  my artwork.
[07:18:02.270 --> 07:18:04.270]  My artwork.
[07:18:04.270 --> 07:18:06.270]  Is that you? Is that a self portrait?
[07:18:06.270 --> 07:18:08.270]  Yeah.
[07:18:08.270 --> 07:18:10.270]  Nice.
[07:18:10.270 --> 07:18:12.270]  So, can you
[07:18:12.270 --> 07:18:14.270]  why don't you...well, alright, we got nothing
[07:18:14.270 --> 07:18:16.270]  going on there.
[07:18:16.270 --> 07:18:18.270]  Can you
[07:18:18.270 --> 07:18:20.270]  you want to
[07:18:20.270 --> 07:18:22.270]  sign off? Do you know what that means?
[07:18:22.270 --> 07:18:24.270]  Yeah.
[07:18:24.270 --> 07:18:26.270]  Chronicle, we can get Kevin back
[07:18:26.270 --> 07:18:28.270]  on.
[07:18:28.270 --> 07:18:30.270]  Gemma!
[07:18:30.270 --> 07:18:32.270]  Okay, stop, stop. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[07:18:32.270 --> 07:18:34.270]  Okay. Alright.
[07:18:34.270 --> 07:18:36.270]  Alright, so
[07:18:36.270 --> 07:18:38.270]  today's Saturday.
[07:18:38.270 --> 07:18:40.270]  Oh my god, you weigh a ton.
[07:18:40.270 --> 07:18:42.270]  Tomorrow we're having
[07:18:42.270 --> 07:18:44.270]  Gemma's baby sister's birthday.
[07:18:44.270 --> 07:18:46.270]  Lots of
[07:18:46.270 --> 07:18:48.270]  Barbies and
[07:18:48.270 --> 07:18:50.270]  Elsas and
[07:18:50.270 --> 07:18:52.270]  other kid appropriate stuff.
[07:18:52.270 --> 07:18:54.270]  The fake Elsa's coming?
[07:18:54.270 --> 07:18:56.270]  The fake Elsa is not
[07:18:56.270 --> 07:18:58.270]  coming, but
[07:19:00.270 --> 07:19:02.270]  How do you know?
[07:19:02.270 --> 07:19:04.270]  Just as we're
[07:19:04.270 --> 07:19:06.270]  ending, I had to go outside and grab Gemma.
[07:19:06.270 --> 07:19:08.270]  How do you know?
[07:19:08.270 --> 07:19:10.270]  You didn't even plan it.
[07:19:10.270 --> 07:19:12.270]  That is true.
[07:19:12.270 --> 07:19:14.270]  Alright, so
[07:19:14.270 --> 07:19:16.270]  I'm brain dead
[07:19:16.270 --> 07:19:18.270]  right now. If you can see
[07:19:18.270 --> 07:19:20.270]  this mound of packs, that's
[07:19:20.270 --> 07:19:22.270]  it's like
[07:19:22.270 --> 07:19:24.270]  four of this, four of this,
[07:19:24.270 --> 07:19:26.270]  four of this, four of this, four of this.
[07:19:26.270 --> 07:19:28.270]  Anyway,
[07:19:28.270 --> 07:19:30.270]  everyone have a good
[07:19:30.270 --> 07:19:32.270]  rest of your Saturday.
[07:19:32.270 --> 07:19:34.270]  Gemma, what did you
[07:19:34.270 --> 07:19:36.270]  eat for dinner? Make me jealous.
[07:19:36.270 --> 07:19:38.270]  What?
[07:19:38.270 --> 07:19:40.270]  You don't remember what you ate?
[07:19:40.270 --> 07:19:42.270]  I ate salad and pizza and ice cream.
[07:19:42.270 --> 07:19:44.270]  That sounds amazing.
[07:19:44.270 --> 07:19:46.270]  Better than your dinner, probably.
[07:19:46.270 --> 07:19:48.270]  Yeah, I have not had anything.
[07:19:48.270 --> 07:19:50.270]  I've had
[07:19:50.270 --> 07:19:52.270]  I just ate pickles about
[07:19:52.270 --> 07:19:54.270]  an hour ago. Before that
[07:19:54.270 --> 07:19:56.270]  I had one Italian sausage.
[07:19:58.270 --> 07:20:00.270]  And I am
[07:20:00.270 --> 07:20:02.270]  I'm on the extreme
[07:20:02.270 --> 07:20:04.270]  side of hunger. So
[07:20:04.270 --> 07:20:06.270]  anyway, everyone
[07:20:06.270 --> 07:20:08.270]  Cheddar Bob
[07:20:08.270 --> 07:20:10.270]  I hope
[07:20:10.270 --> 07:20:12.270]  you catch many lobster this weekend
[07:20:12.270 --> 07:20:14.270]  and
[07:20:14.270 --> 07:20:16.270]  shoot low, low
[07:20:16.270 --> 07:20:18.270]  scores on the golf course.
[07:20:18.270 --> 07:20:20.270]  And one
[07:20:20.270 --> 07:20:22.270]  day we will play golf together.
[07:20:22.270 --> 07:20:24.270]  By
[07:20:24.270 --> 07:20:26.270]  the way, I
[07:20:26.270 --> 07:20:28.270]  I've been
[07:20:28.270 --> 07:20:30.270]  talking to Chad Westport
[07:20:30.270 --> 07:20:32.270]  about
[07:20:32.270 --> 07:20:34.270]  kind of putting together one of the home
[07:20:34.270 --> 07:20:36.270]  growth things with
[07:20:36.270 --> 07:20:38.270]  a very medical
[07:20:38.270 --> 07:20:40.270]  focus. Just a bunch
[07:20:40.270 --> 07:20:42.270]  of people who
[07:20:42.270 --> 07:20:44.270]  are dealing with specific medical issues.
[07:20:44.270 --> 07:20:46.270]  Because I think one of the things Brandon
[07:20:46.270 --> 07:20:48.270]  touched on is kind of the advocacy and stuff
[07:20:48.270 --> 07:20:50.270]  like that. And I think getting those stories
[07:20:50.270 --> 07:20:52.270]  out there is
[07:20:52.270 --> 07:20:54.270]  important. And on
[07:20:54.270 --> 07:20:56.270]  another positive note
[07:20:56.270 --> 07:20:58.270]  Christian Carter
[07:20:58.270 --> 07:21:00.270]  who was in jail for over a year
[07:21:00.270 --> 07:21:02.270]  up in El Dorado County
[07:21:02.270 --> 07:21:04.270]  earlier this week got out of jail.
[07:21:04.270 --> 07:21:06.270]  We all
[07:21:06.270 --> 07:21:08.270]  paid for his legal fees.
[07:21:08.270 --> 07:21:10.270]  And so that
[07:21:10.270 --> 07:21:12.270]  is awesome.
[07:21:12.270 --> 07:21:14.270]  Oh, look, baby parrots.
[07:21:14.270 --> 07:21:16.270]  Those
[07:21:16.270 --> 07:21:18.270]  yeah, those are some kind of bird.
[07:21:18.270 --> 07:21:20.270]  So anyway
[07:21:20.270 --> 07:21:22.270]  I mean it's on the
[07:21:22.270 --> 07:21:24.270]  prison side.
[07:21:24.270 --> 07:21:26.270]  It's on the medical patient
[07:21:26.270 --> 07:21:28.270]  side. We have people
[07:21:28.270 --> 07:21:30.270]  who are in states where they
[07:21:30.270 --> 07:21:32.270]  have desperate
[07:21:32.270 --> 07:21:34.270]  medical need and still have
[07:21:34.270 --> 07:21:36.270]  I mean like the Sanjay Gupta
[07:21:36.270 --> 07:21:38.270]  documentary from
[07:21:38.270 --> 07:21:40.270]  what was that like six, eight years
[07:21:40.270 --> 07:21:42.270]  ago. You know where the family
[07:21:42.270 --> 07:21:44.270]  moved from New Jersey to Colorado
[07:21:44.270 --> 07:21:46.270]  or whatever or Charlotte's Web.
[07:21:46.270 --> 07:21:48.270]  That shit's still
[07:21:48.270 --> 07:21:50.270]  going on. So
[07:21:50.270 --> 07:21:52.270]  grow your own
[07:21:52.270 --> 07:21:54.270]  support small
[07:21:54.270 --> 07:21:56.270]  businesses.
[07:21:56.270 --> 07:21:58.270]  Can you type in Bob's Burgers?
[07:21:58.270 --> 07:22:00.270]  Yes, we can watch some Bob's Burgers.
[07:22:02.270 --> 07:22:04.270]  Gemma and her sister have convinced
[07:22:04.270 --> 07:22:06.270]  me to let them watch very Asian
[07:22:06.270 --> 07:22:08.270]  appropriate cartoons. What else
[07:22:08.270 --> 07:22:10.270]  do you watch? Bob's Burgers,
[07:22:10.270 --> 07:22:12.270]  Family Guy, American Dad, The Simpsons.
[07:22:14.270 --> 07:22:16.270]  And as
[07:22:16.270 --> 07:22:18.270]  you guys watch that I realize
[07:22:18.270 --> 07:22:20.270]  you probably shouldn't be watching it.
[07:22:24.270 --> 07:22:26.270]  That is, oh that's, Gemma you're
[07:22:26.270 --> 07:22:28.270]  watching Future Cannabis Project videos on
[07:22:28.270 --> 07:22:30.270]  YouTube. Amazing. Okay.
[07:22:30.270 --> 07:22:32.270]  Alright. Everyone have a good night.
[07:22:32.270 --> 07:22:34.270]  How is this amazing?
[07:22:34.270 --> 07:22:36.270]  And with that
[07:22:36.270 --> 07:22:38.270]  Gemma can you,
[07:22:38.270 --> 07:22:40.270]  alright, do you know how to
[07:22:40.270 --> 07:22:42.270]  you're going to move the
[07:22:42.270 --> 07:22:44.270]  mouse up to
[07:22:44.270 --> 07:22:46.270]  that and just hit it.
[07:22:46.270 --> 07:22:48.270]  That says, no, no, no, no, no,
[07:22:48.270 --> 07:22:50.270]  right here, end broadcast. Boom.
[07:22:50.270 --> 07:22:52.270]  And then hit that, end broadcast.
