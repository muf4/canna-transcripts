[00:28.410 --> 00:31.650]  How's it going, everybody?
[00:31.650 --> 00:36.010]  I didn't realize I was muted as I did my little intro.
[00:36.010 --> 00:37.970]  Anyway, we are live.
[00:37.970 --> 00:38.970]  Carry on.
[00:38.970 --> 00:39.970]  Yeah.
[00:39.970 --> 00:40.970]  Welcome, everybody.
[00:40.970 --> 00:43.650]  Week 19, we got Arjen Roskam.
[00:43.650 --> 00:45.970]  There's an old school picture of Arjen.
[00:45.970 --> 00:46.970]  And we got Dest.
[00:46.970 --> 00:47.970]  I got more modern.
[00:47.970 --> 00:48.970]  Hello.
[00:48.970 --> 00:49.970]  How's it going, guys?
[00:49.970 --> 00:50.970]  Hanging in there.
[00:50.970 --> 00:51.970]  Excellent.
[00:51.970 --> 00:52.970]  So, we're live.
[00:52.970 --> 01:00.490]  So, you remember this, guys?
[01:00.490 --> 01:04.170]  This is, Arjen gave this to me, I think, in 2013.
[01:04.170 --> 01:08.810]  This is the Arjen King of Cannabis bobblehead.
[01:08.810 --> 01:09.810]  This is great.
[01:09.810 --> 01:11.730]  You know, I mean, it's a one of a kind thing.
[01:11.730 --> 01:15.210]  I mean, greenhouse, Arjen, one of a kind sort of guy.
[01:15.210 --> 01:17.650]  Thank you guys for coming on the show today.
[01:17.650 --> 01:18.650]  You're most welcome.
[01:18.650 --> 01:19.650]  And thank you for having us.
[01:19.650 --> 01:20.650]  Yep.
[01:20.650 --> 01:21.650]  Thank you for inviting.
[01:21.650 --> 01:22.650]  Excellent.
[01:23.330 --> 01:24.330]  So, you guys are in Barcelona.
[01:24.330 --> 01:25.330]  Dest is in Barcelona.
[01:25.330 --> 01:26.330]  Arjen is in Amsterdam.
[01:26.330 --> 01:29.330]  How are things going with COVID?
[01:29.330 --> 01:34.650]  Well, probably a little bit the same like in America.
[01:34.650 --> 01:37.650]  We got more problems with the mayor than with COVID.
[01:37.650 --> 01:43.650]  Yeah, they're giving the injections to people.
[01:43.650 --> 01:50.650]  So, I hope after June, we should be a little bit back to normal.
[01:50.650 --> 01:58.050]  That will take a while and depends a lot on the speed of the injections and stuff like
[01:58.050 --> 01:59.050]  that.
[01:59.050 --> 02:00.050]  How's Barcelona?
[02:00.050 --> 02:06.650]  Yeah, Barcelona is very strange to see it empty.
[02:06.650 --> 02:09.970]  You know, I've been there for like seven years and it's always so crowded.
[02:09.970 --> 02:12.330]  You know, you see the Rambla, it's always full.
[02:12.330 --> 02:15.990]  I think it's one of the most visited streets in the world.
[02:15.990 --> 02:17.530]  And now it's literally empty, you know.
[02:17.530 --> 02:19.610]  So, it's a little bit strange for sure.
[02:19.610 --> 02:21.170]  Yeah, it's like worldwide.
[02:21.170 --> 02:24.530]  People are suffering a little bit for the job and everything.
[02:24.530 --> 02:26.290]  But we know it's temporary.
[02:26.290 --> 02:31.290]  We just have to be patient and just wait for better times.
[02:33.290 --> 02:35.290]  So, we stay positive.
[02:35.290 --> 02:37.290]  Yeah, we got to stay positive.
[02:37.290 --> 02:38.290]  That's for sure.
[02:38.290 --> 02:44.290]  Are the coffee shops open in Amsterdam and the Strain Hunters Club open for sales in Spain?
[02:45.290 --> 02:47.290]  Yeah, Barcelona, the clubs are open.
[02:47.970 --> 02:49.970]  We are limited capacity, you know.
[02:49.970 --> 02:54.970]  In the weekend, just takeaways and there's no drinks, no bar, no food.
[02:54.970 --> 02:57.970]  But at least we can still run a minimum.
[02:59.970 --> 03:00.970]  Amsterdam, the same.
[03:00.970 --> 03:02.970]  We run a minimum, only takeaway.
[03:03.970 --> 03:06.970]  And yeah, the streets are dead basically in the centre.
[03:06.970 --> 03:09.970]  It's a very sad situation.
[03:09.970 --> 03:15.080]  So, let's hope we get out of there soon.
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.080]  Yeah.
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.080]  Yeah, it's really sad over here.
[03:19.760 --> 03:23.760]  In California, in the Bay Area, we just opened up for outside dining again.
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.760]  We've been closed for two months.
[03:25.760 --> 03:29.760]  Then post-inauguration, they opened it back up for outdoor dining.
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.760]  So, restaurants are suffering.
[03:31.760 --> 03:33.760]  Everybody's been kind of suffering.
[03:33.760 --> 03:36.760]  I think the cannabis industry overall is doing well.
[03:36.760 --> 03:41.760]  On an international scale and even statewide and regional here,
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.760]  cannabis has been considered essential in the United States.
[03:46.440 --> 03:48.440]  So, it's been good for cannabis employees.
[03:48.440 --> 03:51.440]  Cannabis sales have gone through the roof in a lot of places.
[03:51.440 --> 03:55.440]  And we have Arizona just went online on Monday for recreational sales.
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.440]  So, the buzz is going and the amount of users is growing.
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.440]  So, I think that's a good thing for us.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.440]  I really wanted to talk to you guys today.
[04:07.440 --> 04:09.440]  There's a couple of things, Franco's legacy.
[04:09.440 --> 04:11.440]  But I wanted to go all the way back with you, Ariane,
[04:11.440 --> 04:14.440]  and kind of talk about how you got started in the cannabis industry.
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.120]  I think that was in the 80s, right?
[04:17.120 --> 04:22.120]  I saw you on the cover of High Times when I was just out of high school in 1995
[04:22.120 --> 04:25.120]  with long hair, just like the picture you showed us.
[04:25.120 --> 04:28.120]  So, how did you get started in the cannabis industry?
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.120]  And take us back to the beginning.
[04:31.120 --> 04:37.120]  Well, I was traveling 82, 83, 84 a lot as I grew up in Africa and Asia.
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.120]  And yeah, it's of course a famous story.
[04:40.800 --> 04:45.800]  I bumped into a mountain village up in the north of Thailand
[04:45.800 --> 04:49.800]  where I encountered a heroin rehab situation,
[04:49.800 --> 04:53.800]  which I was not familiar at all with, but I was just a pot smoker.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.800]  And I was just looking for a sleeping place.
[04:55.800 --> 04:57.800]  Stayed there one day, two days.
[04:57.800 --> 04:59.800]  In the end, I stayed six days.
[04:59.800 --> 05:05.800]  And the man who really intrigued me at that time was really 78, old Thai man.
[05:06.800 --> 05:07.800]  And he gave me a bunch of seeds.
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.480]  And he said to me, when you go back to Europe,
[05:10.480 --> 05:17.480]  do something with these seeds and it will overthrow governments in the future.
[05:17.480 --> 05:20.480]  I thought, yeah, you know, overthrow government in the future.
[05:20.480 --> 05:22.480]  But at that time I was 16, 17.
[05:22.480 --> 05:24.480]  I don't even exactly remember.
[05:25.480 --> 05:28.480]  Unfortunately, those seeds never made it,
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.480]  but the guy planted the seed in my brain.
[05:31.480 --> 05:34.480]  And from there on, I started growing.
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.160]  And I think in 83, 84, I started growing.
[05:38.160 --> 05:40.160]  85, I started making my first seeds.
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.160]  And in 92, I opened the famous Tolstrat coffee shop in the pipe in Amsterdam.
[05:45.160 --> 05:47.160]  Yeah, and the rest is history, of course.
[05:50.160 --> 05:51.160]  Right.
[05:51.160 --> 05:53.160]  And then, Dust, what about you?
[05:53.160 --> 05:55.160]  How did you get started in the industry?
[05:55.160 --> 05:57.160]  And when did you and Arian meet?
[05:57.840 --> 06:03.840]  Well, originally I encountered Greenhouse when I was looking for seeds to buy,
[06:03.840 --> 06:05.840]  you know, for my first growth.
[06:05.840 --> 06:09.840]  And then by coincidence, I bought the Great White Shark.
[06:10.840 --> 06:12.840]  So I started looking into greenhouse seeds, you know,
[06:12.840 --> 06:14.840]  and they had a super nice forum at that time.
[06:14.840 --> 06:16.840]  So I just started to participate there.
[06:16.840 --> 06:19.840]  So I was just very active on the forum for a few years,
[06:19.840 --> 06:21.840]  you know, sharing my growth and helping people.
[06:22.520 --> 06:24.520]  And so there was the fair in Jeroen.
[06:24.520 --> 06:27.520]  I believe it was the first expo grow in Jeroen.
[06:27.520 --> 06:31.520]  And that was like three, four hours from where I was living in France.
[06:32.520 --> 06:35.520]  So one night, you know, I was smoking with friends and we thought of a night.
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.520]  We said, let's go tomorrow to Jeroen.
[06:37.520 --> 06:39.520]  You know, we wake up at six in the morning, drive there,
[06:39.520 --> 06:41.520]  and we can meet Franco and Arian.
[06:42.520 --> 06:44.520]  And that's how we met for the first time.
[06:44.520 --> 06:47.520]  And I just on the smoking joints on the night.
[06:47.520 --> 06:49.520]  And I went there and Franco got me some tickets.
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.520]  And we spent the whole weekend together.
[06:52.200 --> 06:56.200]  And I met Oscar also, that's my partner in the club, Mr. X.
[06:56.200 --> 06:59.200]  And yeah, the rest also is history now for me.
[06:59.200 --> 07:02.200]  You know, it's unbelievable, but I'm super grateful for everything.
[07:04.200 --> 07:06.200]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[07:06.200 --> 07:09.200]  Yeah, so things have changed a lot since the 90s, the 80s and 90s.
[07:09.200 --> 07:11.200]  And, you know, I think we've really evolved.
[07:12.200 --> 07:16.200]  96, when they legalized cannabis for medicine in California,
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.200]  I kind of predicted that it was going to happen in my lifetime.
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.880]  But, you know, it's actually here and even on an international scale
[07:23.880 --> 07:25.880]  with stuff like Strain Hunters,
[07:25.880 --> 07:27.880]  you guys have traveled all around the world.
[07:29.880 --> 07:31.880]  So as far as like you guys,
[07:31.880 --> 07:34.880]  I would assume have the largest collection of land-raised strains.
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.880]  What stood out over the last 15 years of collecting seeds?
[07:40.880 --> 07:42.880]  And how did that actually get started?
[07:42.880 --> 07:44.880]  We can even go there, Arian,
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.880]  with the Strain Hunters concept, you know,
[07:46.880 --> 07:48.880]  it's pretty amazing what you've done.
[07:49.560 --> 07:51.560]  Well, I started, of course, the King of Cannabis concept.
[07:51.560 --> 07:55.560]  This started in 95, when we came under pressure
[07:55.560 --> 07:59.560]  internationally and locally, especially of the Dutch government,
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.560]  because, you know, coffee shops were getting quite popular in Europe
[08:03.560 --> 08:07.560]  and in the United Nations, the French and the Swedes
[08:07.560 --> 08:11.560]  and the American were complaining about the Dutch drugs policy
[08:11.560 --> 08:14.560]  and making statements against us.
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.560]  And we came under pressure of the Amsterdam mayor at that time.
[08:18.240 --> 08:20.240]  He was the spokesman for the Cannabis Retailers Association.
[08:20.240 --> 08:23.240]  And I thought, you know what, we need to create the King of Cannabis.
[08:23.240 --> 08:25.240]  So when celebrities come over to Amsterdam,
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.240]  we can inform them and try to help them a lot
[08:30.240 --> 08:32.240]  and tell them to go back to America
[08:32.240 --> 08:34.240]  and, you know, advocate our case,
[08:34.240 --> 08:37.240]  which of course already was happening through high times
[08:37.240 --> 08:41.240]  and many people like Woody Harrison and Bill Maher
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.240]  and a lot of musicians and all those kind of people, you know.
[08:44.920 --> 08:47.920]  But I thought, you know, King of Cannabis
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.920]  and the people, Americans really like that kind of stuff
[08:49.920 --> 08:53.920]  and it really worked because, yeah, as you probably know now,
[08:53.920 --> 08:56.920]  you know, we have more than 150 A-list people
[08:56.920 --> 08:58.920]  and five royal families as customers
[08:58.920 --> 09:01.920]  and they really, really helped us a lot
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.920]  by, you know, moving forward in California and in Canada
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.920]  and all those places.
[09:05.920 --> 09:07.920]  That's why we still exist.
[09:07.920 --> 09:09.920]  Unfortunately, now we have a new mayor again,
[09:09.920 --> 09:13.920]  who wants to kick out all the tourists of the coffee shops
[09:14.600 --> 09:18.600]  because she considers the tourists a lower grade of tourists.
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.600]  Yeah, it's astonishing basically what she's doing,
[09:23.600 --> 09:25.600]  but this is the situation now.
[09:25.600 --> 09:26.600]  But that was the King of Cannabis.
[09:26.600 --> 09:28.600]  I have to give you a little intro
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.600]  because at one point, I think 2004, 2005,
[09:32.600 --> 09:35.600]  I went to the office and I was a little bit fed up
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.600]  and of course, you know, as you know my background
[09:37.600 --> 09:39.600]  from Africa and Asia, I thought, you know what?
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.600]  I would like to show the world what I'm really doing
[09:44.280 --> 09:46.280]  and go to the bush and hang out with my friends
[09:46.280 --> 09:48.280]  and look for seeds and stuff like that
[09:48.280 --> 09:50.280]  and go look for plants and have a nice smoke
[09:50.280 --> 09:52.280]  in countries like Morocco and India and the Philippines
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.280]  and everywhere.
[09:53.280 --> 09:55.280]  So I went back to the office and said,
[09:55.280 --> 09:57.280]  okay guys, let's go film it, you know?
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.280]  And then everybody thought, okay,
[09:58.280 --> 10:00.280]  this is going to be the end of our company
[10:00.280 --> 10:02.280]  because this is such a crazy idea.
[10:02.280 --> 10:04.280]  This is impossible, you know?
[10:04.280 --> 10:06.280]  Well, make a long story short,
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.280]  it was 2006 or 2008, I don't even remember it.
[10:10.280 --> 10:13.280]  I pulled Franco out of the coffee shop
[10:13.960 --> 10:15.960]  and Simon I encountered on the road
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.960]  and we created Strain Hunters
[10:17.960 --> 10:19.960]  and what I wanted to show was
[10:19.960 --> 10:23.960]  that how many people are depending economically wise
[10:23.960 --> 10:25.960]  on marijuana around the equator.
[10:25.960 --> 10:28.960]  We think it's 200 million poor farmers
[10:28.960 --> 10:31.960]  all around the equator, around the world
[10:31.960 --> 10:32.960]  that are depending on this crop.
[10:32.960 --> 10:34.960]  This is how important it is.
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.960]  Also the health part, you know,
[10:36.960 --> 10:38.960]  they treat all the young babies when they have no medicine
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.960]  and no money with the seeds, you know,
[10:40.960 --> 10:42.960]  with the oil for their stomach.
[10:43.640 --> 10:45.640]  They pull those teas and all that kind of stuff.
[10:45.640 --> 10:47.640]  So we start documenting that
[10:47.640 --> 10:49.640]  and in the beginning it was only me
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.640]  and Franco and Simon and it was Franco's uncle filming us
[10:53.640 --> 10:55.640]  until Vice got a hold of it
[10:55.640 --> 10:57.640]  and then National Geographic, you probably know
[10:57.640 --> 11:01.640]  and then now in the last one was Vice on HBO
[11:01.640 --> 11:02.640]  with a great episode.
[11:02.640 --> 11:04.640]  I think we hit like 80 million people.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.640]  So that's a little bit the history of the Strain Hunters.
[11:08.640 --> 11:11.640]  And then, yeah, then unfortunately four years ago
[11:12.320 --> 11:14.320]  we had a drama with Franco.
[11:14.320 --> 11:17.320]  So one of our missions, he contracted
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.320]  celebrile malaria and he unfortunately passed away.
[11:21.320 --> 11:25.320]  But yeah, I had 19 years of craziness with this guy.
[11:25.320 --> 11:28.320]  And we had three, four years of mourning
[11:28.320 --> 11:31.320]  and now Dust is going to take over his position
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.320]  because we already planned one last year in September
[11:35.320 --> 11:37.320]  but you can understand due to COVID
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.320]  it was impossible to go on a mission,
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  because we're coming from four or five countries, the crew.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  And so we are now focusing on April, May.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  And if that's technically not possible
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  we will do one in September
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  because technically we can do two a year if we would like.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  We always make one a year because it's a lot of work.
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  But of course you have the Northern Hemisphere
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  and the Southern Hemisphere
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  which is different harvest season.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  So, you know, we can go to both places.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  So that's where we stand right now with Strain Hunters.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  So I'm very, very much looking forward
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.680]  to get the boots back on the ground
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.680]  and go into the bush and have a good time with friends
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.680]  and find some great stuff, you know?
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.680]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[12:18.680 --> 12:21.680]  So you've collected seeds in each place
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.680]  that you've gone from all around the world.
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.680]  So you're preserving these, you use them for breeding
[12:28.680 --> 12:31.680]  and, you know, preservation.
[12:31.680 --> 12:34.680]  I think you've done an immense job
[12:34.680 --> 12:36.680]  of going around the world
[12:37.360 --> 12:38.360]  and Colombia.
[12:38.360 --> 12:40.360]  So you want to tell us something?
[12:40.360 --> 12:41.360]  Yeah, Punta Roja.
[12:41.360 --> 12:42.360]  Yeah.
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.360]  We mixed it up in a new variety that maybe Das can explain.
[12:46.360 --> 12:49.360]  We found a one keeper in that big field.
[12:49.360 --> 12:50.360]  It was amazing.
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.360]  Yeah, the Punta Roja actually is the first land race
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.360]  that we are using in one of the crosses.
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.360]  So that's really exciting and super vigorous.
[12:59.360 --> 13:01.360]  It was a really, really nice plant.
[13:01.360 --> 13:04.360]  You know, like really compact birds and full of resin.
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.040]  It was really nice, fruity, like strawberry.
[13:08.040 --> 13:11.040]  I don't know, it was kind of not strawberry haze,
[13:11.040 --> 13:14.040]  but it had a hazy note with strawberry and like red fruit.
[13:14.040 --> 13:17.040]  It smells, you know, like super, super intense,
[13:17.040 --> 13:20.040]  like a little bit like the old school shizuka, but different.
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.040]  And yeah, we crossed it with a selection of mandelbrot we did.
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.040]  That was a really amazing plant.
[13:26.040 --> 13:28.040]  Also, it was a really nice plant.
[13:28.040 --> 13:30.040]  And the cloudwalker came out from this.
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.040]  And I'm super happy with the result, you know,
[13:33.720 --> 13:35.720]  super, super nice sativa effect.
[13:35.720 --> 13:38.720]  The yield is really good and you get those nice compact birds.
[13:38.720 --> 13:39.720]  It's full of resin.
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.720]  Pretty soon we're probably going to do some hash with it,
[13:42.720 --> 13:43.720]  so we'll see how it's doing.
[13:43.720 --> 13:46.720]  But I'm pretty confident it's going to be really good for hash also.
[13:46.720 --> 13:47.720]  So that's nice.
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.720]  Yeah, and also a great yielder, eh?
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.720]  Yeah, yeah, the buds are huge.
[13:51.720 --> 13:54.720]  Nice, nice long color, like the old school sativas,
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.720]  but really compact.
[13:55.720 --> 13:56.720]  It's super nice.
[13:56.720 --> 13:57.720]  Really nice.
[13:57.720 --> 13:59.720]  Yeah, the thing is, you know, Steve,
[13:59.720 --> 14:01.720]  we have to get to America and Canada bigger.
[14:02.400 --> 14:04.400]  But the problem is everything is so commercial.
[14:04.400 --> 14:06.400]  What we need is big outdoor spaces.
[14:06.400 --> 14:08.400]  If you want to select these plants, you know,
[14:08.400 --> 14:10.400]  you need to put out thousands of plants, you know,
[14:10.400 --> 14:12.400]  to select the proper one and then work.
[14:12.400 --> 14:15.400]  And don't forget here in Europe everything is like super illegal, yeah?
[14:15.400 --> 14:19.400]  So our situations are much more complicated than for you guys in America,
[14:19.400 --> 14:22.400]  you know, where you got a red carpet from the police.
[14:22.400 --> 14:23.400]  Right.
[14:23.400 --> 14:25.400]  We have a black carpet.
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.400]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like, green carpet, yeah.
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.400]  No green carpet.
[14:31.080 --> 14:32.080]  Black carpet.
[14:32.080 --> 14:33.080]  Go prison.
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.080]  You know, monopoly?
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.080]  Yeah, right.
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.080]  Yeah, it's amazing because, you know,
[14:39.080 --> 14:43.080]  I think we've been just kind of a thorn in the side of the government
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.080]  for a long time here in the United States.
[14:45.080 --> 14:47.080]  They're starting to come around to it.
[14:47.080 --> 14:50.080]  But going, you know, down in Colombia, and I was in Colombia last year,
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.080]  and, you know, in the Caribbean, they're very excited to have us on board.
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.080]  I'm really excited about Colombia and the potentials in Mexico
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.760]  and places like that where we have, there's a lot of space, you know,
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.760]  because I still feel like, you know, we have space in America
[15:04.760 --> 15:07.760]  and we can do a lot of stuff, but the labor is so much cheaper
[15:07.760 --> 15:14.760]  down in places like that and access to land is just,
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.760]  I mean, you're working down in Colombia, Mexico as well, or?
[15:18.760 --> 15:19.760]  Well, we have friends that work.
[15:19.760 --> 15:20.760]  You're kind of all over the world.
[15:20.760 --> 15:21.760]  You're working with people.
[15:21.760 --> 15:22.760]  Yeah.
[15:22.760 --> 15:23.760]  We've been working there.
[15:23.760 --> 15:26.760]  We have friends that work there that have license.
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.440]  We have a lot of seeds to them.
[15:28.440 --> 15:31.440]  There's some groups doing really, really well.
[15:31.440 --> 15:33.440]  Other groups still have to start.
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.440]  But, yeah, of course, as many other countries, it's a great country to grow, you know?
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.440]  Right.
[15:40.440 --> 15:41.440]  How's the Congo?
[15:41.440 --> 15:43.440]  I know you were in the Congo for a long time.
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.440]  In fact, you want to talk about the legislation that you helped pass in the Congo?
[15:48.440 --> 15:49.440]  Yeah.
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.440]  Well, what we did was one of our biggest programs ever, you know?
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.120]  We created a whole factory there, which until today still is going.
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.120]  We not have been there anymore since beginning of last year,
[16:03.120 --> 16:06.120]  because we also want them to do it on their own, you know?
[16:06.120 --> 16:11.120]  But we are still mentally behind them and supporting them in all the ways we can.
[16:11.120 --> 16:19.120]  But Congo is an extremely complicated country with, I think, 700 languages
[16:19.120 --> 16:22.120]  and 500 tribes, and it's huge.
[16:22.800 --> 16:23.800]  It's the size of Europe.
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.800]  So you can imagine how big it is.
[16:27.800 --> 16:30.800]  And then, of course, there's all these issues with different tribes
[16:30.800 --> 16:32.800]  and mining and all that kind of stuff.
[16:33.800 --> 16:37.800]  But, yeah, as I was from Africa, we made a movie there with Vice and HBO.
[16:38.800 --> 16:40.800]  We went back there with Frank also.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.800]  Okay, this is the most difficult area in the world,
[16:42.800 --> 16:45.800]  and here they need this medicine the most.
[16:46.800 --> 16:48.800]  So we did basically the impossible.
[16:49.480 --> 16:52.480]  We have 40 glasshouses, and it's running there.
[16:53.480 --> 16:56.480]  But it's a very difficult process with governments,
[16:56.480 --> 16:58.480]  because governments keep changing.
[16:58.480 --> 17:02.480]  I think in the meantime, even the president changed after 22 years.
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.480]  And also the Minister of Health changes like every 8 or 12 months, you know?
[17:09.480 --> 17:11.480]  So it's very difficult to get things organized.
[17:11.480 --> 17:17.480]  It's a very slow machine, but it's running.
[17:19.480 --> 17:21.480]  Well, and you guys made it out relatively okay.
[17:21.480 --> 17:24.480]  As far as safety, I would be concerned with my safety down there.
[17:25.480 --> 17:27.480]  Everything we hear in America about the Congo is like,
[17:27.480 --> 17:28.480]  man, it sounds so dangerous.
[17:29.480 --> 17:31.480]  Look, there's many countries very dangerous,
[17:31.480 --> 17:33.480]  and this is for sure one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
[17:33.480 --> 17:38.480]  You probably saw on Instagram, we had a huge crash on the highway
[17:39.480 --> 17:44.480]  one night when our driver, our partner, fell asleep with Heiko next to him.
[17:44.480 --> 17:47.480]  And we really went to the right, luckily, and not to the left,
[17:48.160 --> 17:51.160]  because this is the road from Matadi to Kinshasa,
[17:51.160 --> 17:56.160]  which is like a 400k road, where all these huge 20 and 40 tons
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.160]  just crush over you and you're just done, you know?
[18:00.160 --> 18:02.160]  Then, of course, you have snakes, you have war.
[18:04.160 --> 18:06.160]  We have a lot of crazy stuff.
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.160]  But having said all those things, even more dangerous is diseases.
[18:11.160 --> 18:13.160]  You can see that with Franco, you know?
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.160]  There's Ebola there.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.160]  There's all kinds of stuff.
[18:16.840 --> 18:17.840]  So, yeah.
[18:18.840 --> 18:21.840]  But also, we also find that a company,
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.840]  it was also our responsibility to leave some legacy in some countries left and right.
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.840]  Like in India, we built a house for a family.
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.840]  And here we said, okay, let's try to do the most impossible job in the world,
[18:35.840 --> 18:38.840]  in the most remote area, where there's war, where there's all kinds of stuff.
[18:39.840 --> 18:42.840]  Let's try to build a facility here for marijuana,
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.840]  and let's see how it goes, and let's see how difficult it is.
[18:45.520 --> 18:49.520]  And also, don't forget, there's 50,000 Rastafarians in Congo.
[18:50.520 --> 18:53.520]  It's the biggest Rastafarian community in the world, I think.
[18:54.520 --> 18:57.520]  And so, also, there's a big legacy there, you know?
[18:58.520 --> 18:59.520]  This is where it all originated.
[19:00.520 --> 19:02.520]  We call it the deep sea of Africa.
[19:03.520 --> 19:07.520]  It's a beautiful country, beautiful people, but just extremely complicated.
[19:08.520 --> 19:10.520]  But, you know, what do I have to say about complicated?
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.520]  Look at your elections the last two months, you know?
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.200]  It's crazy.
[19:16.200 --> 19:19.200]  So, you know, there's problems everywhere.
[19:19.200 --> 19:23.200]  There's problems in Turkey, there's problems in so many countries in Europe, you know?
[19:24.200 --> 19:26.200]  And in America, and in South America, and all over the world.
[19:28.200 --> 19:30.200]  That's because people don't smoke enough pot.
[19:31.200 --> 19:32.200]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[19:33.200 --> 19:36.200]  They should all smoke a lot and then chill out, you know?
[19:37.200 --> 19:39.200]  The government should give it out to people.
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.880]  Yeah, so we had this whole plan there, which we still hope one day they can implement, you know?
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.880]  And then just spread free oil to sick people and try to help them.
[19:49.880 --> 19:50.880]  And we can do a lot of good things there, you know?
[19:51.880 --> 19:56.880]  Because Africa is an area where people really depend on local medicine a lot.
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.880]  Because, you know, they don't have money to buy medicine.
[20:01.880 --> 20:05.880]  As a matter of fact, people don't really know, but the reason many kids in Africa don't go to school
[20:06.880 --> 20:07.880]  is because they have to guard the cattle.
[20:08.560 --> 20:11.560]  And most very poor families have like three fields.
[20:12.560 --> 20:14.560]  So one is for the millies, the corn, as you call it.
[20:15.560 --> 20:17.560]  One is for the vegetables, to eat themselves.
[20:18.560 --> 20:19.560]  And the millie is for the cattle and also for themselves.
[20:20.560 --> 20:21.560]  And they have a little marrow anfield.
[20:22.560 --> 20:24.560]  But they don't have money to buy fences.
[20:25.560 --> 20:31.560]  So the only job of the kids is to make sure the cattle, the few cows they have and goats,
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.560]  don't go into the fields and eat the crop, because then they literally die.
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.240]  So this is a big reason that kids don't go to school in Africa.
[20:43.240 --> 20:44.240]  Wow.
[20:45.240 --> 20:46.240]  Yeah.
[20:47.240 --> 20:48.240]  Pretty amazing.
[20:49.240 --> 20:52.240]  And then you come into the Western world and then your kids can't go to a really expensive school
[20:53.240 --> 20:54.240]  because you don't have money.
[20:55.240 --> 20:56.240]  Right.
[20:57.240 --> 20:58.240]  Yeah.
[20:59.240 --> 21:00.240]  Yeah.
[21:00.240 --> 21:01.240]  I mean, the whole world is so volatile.
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.240]  So and then cannabis is just evolving so much, too.
[21:05.920 --> 21:08.920]  From land races to these, you know, like Durban poison is a great example.
[21:09.920 --> 21:15.920]  And I use the example because for silver, which is one of your varieties, was bred into it.
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.920]  You know, we have Malawi, we have Durban, some of these popular land race varieties.
[21:21.920 --> 21:23.920]  Red Congolese is another one that we see here.
[21:24.920 --> 21:25.920]  But they're not the original version.
[21:26.920 --> 21:28.920]  Like the Durban poison that we see here is not the Durban land race.
[21:29.920 --> 21:30.920]  And I think there's a lot of confusion on it.
[21:31.600 --> 21:38.600]  So Durban, you know, I got Durban a long time ago or Durban poison that really leaned towards the Durban.
[21:39.600 --> 21:41.600]  And now the Durban is very leaning towards the super silver haze.
[21:42.600 --> 21:50.600]  What have you guys seen change wise coming from land race varieties and then breeding them into new, more modern genetics?
[21:51.600 --> 21:54.600]  Kind of like we were talking about with the Punta Rojo.
[21:55.600 --> 21:59.600]  Are there other varieties that you see like what I'm talking about with the Durban poison?
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.280]  Yeah.
[22:02.280 --> 22:07.280]  Look, Punta Rojo is really Punta Rojo, you know, that's widely available.
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.280]  But Durban poison, I made a movie that never came out, by the way.
[22:13.280 --> 22:16.280]  It was one of the first ones I made with Franco, but our quality was so bad.
[22:17.280 --> 22:21.280]  And we were a little bit chasing in South Africa and Transkei and all those places.
[22:22.280 --> 22:27.280]  We were trying to chase the Durban poison and we winded up by the old South African growers.
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.960]  And basically the original plants came on the East Coast with the Indians from Kerala.
[22:33.960 --> 22:36.960]  Kerala was, we think, originates some of the best dope ever.
[22:37.960 --> 22:44.960]  But anyway, this one came through the East Coast with those sailing boats, with those fishermen and trade guys all the way down.
[22:45.960 --> 22:50.960]  And according to them, there have never been like a fixed variety of Durban poison.
[22:51.960 --> 22:55.960]  There's been like an area where a lot of phenotypes from a good variety grew.
[22:56.640 --> 23:03.640]  And that has been then identified as so-called the Durban poison.
[23:04.640 --> 23:07.640]  So, yeah, also in land races, you know, what is a land race?
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.640]  Is it something that is 30 years in the valley or 50 years or 100 years inbred or whatever?
[23:14.640 --> 23:17.640]  You know, there's many things to say.
[23:18.640 --> 23:25.640]  If you go to other areas, for example, Malawi, Malawi gold, which is an amazing variety.
[23:26.640 --> 23:29.640]  That's a stable land race, you know, but you have to look properly for it.
[23:30.640 --> 23:34.640]  And then things change, of course, when you go to the mountains, when you go to India,
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.640]  where they make the proper charas and even the jungle one and everything.
[23:41.640 --> 23:47.640]  That plant is useless to inbreed in good quality because it's a hash making plant.
[23:48.640 --> 23:50.640]  Many people tried it, but not really good stuff came out.
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.640]  Makes the best hash, but it's just not suitable.
[23:54.320 --> 23:56.320]  So there's a lot of different things in land races.
[23:57.320 --> 23:59.320]  There's some really good ones. Some there's like a myth around.
[24:00.320 --> 24:02.320]  You don't really know. Other ones are useless.
[24:04.320 --> 24:07.320]  You know, it's just in what context you want to place the land race.
[24:08.320 --> 24:11.320]  And what is a land race? What is the definition?
[24:12.320 --> 24:13.320]  Yeah, so let's talk about that for a minute.
[24:14.320 --> 24:21.320]  I think there's a lot of confusion between indigenous wild cannabis, land races,
[24:22.000 --> 24:23.000]  land race varieties.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  So, you know, my understanding would be that indigenous would be the stuff
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  that's originated from that variety.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  Wild cannabis could be anything that grows wild in that region, wherever that region is.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  And then land race is actually a cultivated variety that's been cultivated
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  and bred towards certain goals, depending on that area's needs.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Cultivated by humans.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  Yeah, cultivated by humans, selected.
[24:49.680 --> 24:50.680]  We've done that as humans.
[24:51.680 --> 24:53.680]  We've done the selection process, brought stuff in from other places.
[24:54.680 --> 24:57.680]  Like Jamaica is a perfect example of, you know, if you look at some of the
[24:58.680 --> 25:01.680]  varieties, lamb's bread is probably brought over from Africa, maybe even from, you know.
[25:02.680 --> 25:03.680]  It's from Colombia.
[25:04.680 --> 25:05.680]  Colombia. Okay.
[25:06.680 --> 25:07.680]  All the Jamaican stuff is from Colombia.
[25:08.680 --> 25:09.680]  Yeah.
[25:10.680 --> 25:12.680]  Until the 75 or 70s, there was no pot in Jamaica.
[25:13.680 --> 25:15.680]  Of course, there was some pot, you know, because you know stories.
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.360]  It's even in one of my movies that the slaves were already smoking and running
[25:21.360 --> 25:22.360]  away and hiding near the waterfalls and stuff like that.
[25:23.360 --> 25:27.360]  But the stuff that has been marked as lamb's bread and all those varieties,
[25:28.360 --> 25:29.360]  they all came from South America.
[25:30.360 --> 25:32.360]  Yeah, it's funny how those have changed even still.
[25:33.360 --> 25:36.360]  I think because it's an island and pollen floats so freely, a lot of the stuff
[25:37.360 --> 25:40.360]  that was accessible 20 years ago is really, really hard to find today.
[25:41.360 --> 25:43.360]  You know, there's places like Orange Hill and Lamb's Bread.
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.040]  I think the lamb's bread, what people think of lamb's bread, especially in the
[25:47.040 --> 25:50.040]  United States, isn't the lamb's bread that you know or the lamb's bread that I've seen.
[25:51.040 --> 25:53.040]  No, it's not there anymore.
[25:54.040 --> 25:55.040]  I tried to find it the last three times.
[25:56.040 --> 25:57.040]  Nobody's got it.
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.040]  Yeah, so I look around also and it's like, yes, looking for a unicorn.
[26:02.040 --> 26:03.040]  You know, it's.
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.040]  Yeah, we think we got some kind of good context there, you know.
[26:08.040 --> 26:09.040]  Yeah.
[26:10.040 --> 26:11.040]  You just can't find it.
[26:11.720 --> 26:15.720]  It's so tough with an island and then pollen floating freely around that island.
[26:16.720 --> 26:18.720]  It's like, you know, that can change genetics.
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.720]  That can definitely change the lineage of stuff and, you know, not the origin,
[26:24.720 --> 26:27.720]  but it can change the seeds because everything comes from seed and a lot of those growers
[26:28.720 --> 26:29.720]  grow from seed.
[26:30.720 --> 26:31.720]  So, yeah, it's pretty wild.
[26:32.720 --> 26:35.720]  Jamaica is a fun place, but Orange Hill, which is one of my favorite varieties,
[26:36.720 --> 26:40.720]  it's super, super strong that we have seeds of now here that I've gotten from some Jamaicans.
[26:41.720 --> 26:42.720]  And that's a good one.
[26:43.720 --> 26:45.720]  Yeah, but it's also related to the size of those islands.
[26:46.720 --> 26:50.720]  They're so small, you know, that there's not enough space for the genetic to save itself somewhere,
[26:51.720 --> 26:52.720]  you know, and it cannot hide anywhere.
[26:53.720 --> 26:54.720]  There's just pollen everywhere.
[26:55.720 --> 26:58.720]  Even if you go in the French Caribbean, you know, in Guadalupe and Martinique and all this,
[26:59.720 --> 27:03.720]  all the weed that I had there when I was there the last time is all influenced by modern genetic.
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.720]  It's all skunky or cushy or but there's no more land raised like the old school
[27:09.400 --> 27:11.400]  15 weeks flowering that they used to have and stuff like this.
[27:12.400 --> 27:14.400]  They don't have it anymore because they don't want it also.
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.400]  You know, the people there, yeah, they found faster strains.
[27:20.400 --> 27:22.400]  Of course, in those areas for them, it's much faster.
[27:23.400 --> 27:24.400]  It's better.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.400]  So they didn't preserve it, unfortunately.
[27:28.400 --> 27:29.400]  Yeah.
[27:30.400 --> 27:32.400]  So and then that's so different, like islands compared to like Morocco,
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.400]  where people have gone in and brought in seeds and they brought these varieties
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.400]  in and it seems to have changed the hash that arrives in Europe for a period of time.
[27:44.400 --> 27:45.400]  And then a lot of it goes back.
[27:46.400 --> 27:48.400]  What's your guys' experience with that, with Morocco?
[27:49.400 --> 27:55.400]  Well, Morocco is definitely following the markets that is the world is asking for.
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.400]  Also, you know, like if they find a seed that has a better yield and more,
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.400]  more resistant to molds, you know, and to insects and pests,
[28:04.400 --> 28:07.400]  because they have a lot of molds always every year, a lot of males flying around.
[28:08.080 --> 28:12.080]  You know, so when they found out feminized or pest resistant and all this,
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.080]  yeah, of course they're going for this.
[28:15.080 --> 28:18.080]  But I think Morocco, if you go deep enough, you can always still find because it's so big.
[28:19.080 --> 28:21.080]  You know, even though the amount of plants is big in the Rift Valley and all this,
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.080]  if you go in more remote area, you can still find the old school,
[28:26.080 --> 28:29.080]  you know, the old Pakistani plants and all those, those local semi-autos,
[28:30.080 --> 28:31.080]  land-raised that are super short.
[28:32.080 --> 28:33.080]  And you can still find this in Morocco.
[28:33.760 --> 28:37.760]  It might be a little bit affected, but I think if you leave it long enough,
[28:38.760 --> 28:39.760]  it will come back to its original.
[28:41.760 --> 28:48.760]  Yeah. Also, I think the authorities now forbid to import seeds, legal or illegal,
[28:49.760 --> 28:54.760]  because the plants that have been coming in there from the early 2000s,
[28:55.760 --> 28:57.760]  especially the Pakistani plants and all that, are growing much bigger.
[28:58.760 --> 29:01.760]  And then, and they use more chemicals now instead of the old system.
[29:02.440 --> 29:04.440]  So the ground is not getting much better.
[29:05.440 --> 29:11.440]  And I think they are like trying to impose some kind of structure
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.440]  to get the soil better again and not grow these huge plants
[29:17.440 --> 29:19.440]  because it's a burden on the soil in the mountains.
[29:23.540 --> 29:24.540]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[29:25.540 --> 29:28.540]  And their rules down there are very interesting too on what can be grown.
[29:29.540 --> 29:32.540]  And they're moving towards legalization too as well. Correct?
[29:33.220 --> 29:35.220]  There are talks in the parliament.
[29:36.220 --> 29:37.220]  I think they want to do something with CBD.
[29:38.220 --> 29:42.220]  But I don't know how far that is on paper.
[29:43.220 --> 29:46.220]  But there are talks in Morocco that they want to legalize their industry.
[29:47.220 --> 29:49.220]  Yeah, I heard Lebanon too.
[29:50.220 --> 29:51.220]  Lebanon too, yes.
[29:52.220 --> 29:54.220]  Lebanon too. That's a whole other story.
[29:55.220 --> 29:56.220]  They are legalizing in parliament.
[29:57.220 --> 29:58.220]  Wow. That's huge.
[29:59.220 --> 30:02.220]  Well, they did it in Thailand, which you would never expect.
[30:03.220 --> 30:05.220]  I think you're even allowed to grow five plants now,
[30:06.220 --> 30:07.220]  which is unreal.
[30:08.220 --> 30:10.220]  If you told me that 10 years ago, I would declare you crazy.
[30:11.220 --> 30:13.220]  And even in the Philippines, I heard stories about
[30:14.220 --> 30:16.220]  they want to legalize some medical marijuana growth.
[30:17.220 --> 30:19.220]  So yeah, it's moving.
[30:20.220 --> 30:22.220]  We have Luxembourg also, right? In Europe.
[30:23.220 --> 30:24.220]  Yeah, Luxembourg in Europe,
[30:25.220 --> 30:28.220]  which is also one of the last countries you would think they would do it.
[30:29.220 --> 30:31.220]  It's like a little bit conservative kingdom
[30:31.900 --> 30:33.900]  with a lot of rich people living in small castles.
[30:34.900 --> 30:37.900]  It's a very small country, very well organized banking system.
[30:38.900 --> 30:42.900]  And yeah, they decided they want to even open coffee shops there.
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.900]  So that's quite surprising.
[30:46.900 --> 30:48.900]  Wow. Maybe a Strain Hunters Club.
[30:49.900 --> 30:53.900]  Yeah. I prefer to come to California, to be honest.
[30:54.900 --> 30:56.900]  Yeah, we're ready. We're ready for Strain Hunters California.
[30:57.900 --> 30:58.900]  Wouldn't that be awesome?
[30:59.580 --> 31:01.580]  Yeah, just chill there in this nice shop and smoke one.
[31:02.580 --> 31:03.580]  Yeah, that would be great.
[31:04.580 --> 31:06.580]  Well, yeah. At one time you told me that Strain Hunters
[31:07.580 --> 31:09.580]  was going to be the Hard Rock Cafe of Cannabis.
[31:10.580 --> 31:12.580]  And I feel like you've expanded on that.
[31:13.580 --> 31:15.580]  And you know, your Barcelona, you know, is that still the plan?
[31:16.580 --> 31:17.580]  Yeah. Well, yeah, of course.
[31:18.580 --> 31:20.580]  Well, we had, I didn't say Hard Rock
[31:21.580 --> 31:22.580]  because I don't think I said it like that.
[31:23.580 --> 31:24.580]  Something similar. Yeah.
[31:25.580 --> 31:26.580]  Something similar. Yeah.
[31:27.260 --> 31:29.260]  The idea was to have in a few big cities in the world one club.
[31:30.260 --> 31:32.260]  So when we travel around, we are fine, you know.
[31:33.260 --> 31:37.260]  So, well, we opened one in Barcelona five years ago, Dustin Oscar.
[31:38.260 --> 31:40.260]  And I opened one two months ago in Amsterdam.
[31:41.260 --> 31:43.260]  No, it's not two months ago. It was August.
[31:44.260 --> 31:45.260]  I'm not so good in time, as you guys know.
[31:46.260 --> 31:48.260]  So there was last year, August, we opened a fifth coffee shop in Amsterdam
[31:49.260 --> 31:51.260]  called Strain Hunters, which came out really nice.
[31:52.260 --> 31:55.260]  Yeah. And definitely now in the near future,
[31:55.940 --> 31:56.940]  I don't know, in the next three years,
[31:57.940 --> 32:00.940]  we should see what we can do in California or in Canada, you know.
[32:01.940 --> 32:03.940]  Canada has also a lot of possibilities, of course,
[32:04.940 --> 32:05.940]  because it's totally legalized.
[32:06.940 --> 32:08.940]  And yeah, it could be interesting for us to be also there.
[32:09.940 --> 32:11.940]  So, yeah, let's see what the future brings.
[32:12.940 --> 32:17.940]  We're open to any particle, new ideas, you know.
[32:20.940 --> 32:24.940]  Yeah. So you're working with Canopy up in Canada as well, right?
[32:25.940 --> 32:27.940]  Canopy Growth. How's everything with that going?
[32:28.940 --> 32:31.940]  Not really. They own the factory, which we took over part of, you know,
[32:32.940 --> 32:33.940]  and they still own that.
[32:34.940 --> 32:36.940]  And yeah, that's basically it.
[32:37.940 --> 32:38.940]  But technically, we don't do much together, basically.
[32:39.940 --> 32:40.940]  It's one of their investments.
[32:41.940 --> 32:42.940]  Right.
[32:43.940 --> 32:44.940]  Their stock's doing well.
[32:46.940 --> 32:47.940]  Yes.
[32:48.940 --> 32:49.940]  Yeah, they're all going up right now.
[32:50.940 --> 32:52.940]  Again? On Sunday?
[32:53.620 --> 32:55.620]  What is Canopy doing?
[32:56.620 --> 32:58.620]  I know Canopy went up like 50%.
[32:59.620 --> 33:00.620]  I don't know what the hell is going on there.
[33:02.620 --> 33:03.620]  Yeah, they're at 40%.
[33:04.620 --> 33:06.620]  You know, I mean, I think last year they were at, what, 60?
[33:07.620 --> 33:09.620]  55 February 10th and they're at 40 now.
[33:10.620 --> 33:11.620]  So that's not that great.
[33:12.620 --> 33:14.620]  But, you know, over the long haul,
[33:15.620 --> 33:19.620]  over the last year, they were really low and now they've bounced up.
[33:20.620 --> 33:22.620]  You know, we're seeing that a lot with cannabis stocks, with Bitcoin.
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.620]  You guys work with Bitcoin at all?
[33:26.620 --> 33:27.620]  Not sure.
[33:28.620 --> 33:29.620]  Maybe on the website, but...
[33:30.620 --> 33:31.620]  Yeah, I don't think we have Bitcoin payment on the website.
[33:32.620 --> 33:33.620]  I don't remember that.
[33:34.620 --> 33:35.620]  We need to ask Heiko that.
[33:36.620 --> 33:39.620]  He's our chief on that point.
[33:40.620 --> 33:41.620]  Bitcoin chief.
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.620]  Yeah.
[33:46.620 --> 33:47.620]  Yeah, it's wild with Bitcoin.
[33:48.620 --> 33:50.620]  Now Tesla, they're taking on Bitcoin and they're going to offer it to
[33:51.300 --> 33:53.300]  their customers to pay for Tesla's in Bitcoin.
[33:54.300 --> 33:56.300]  And, you know, I don't see Bitcoin going down anytime soon.
[33:57.300 --> 33:58.300]  It's just going to keep going up the way it looks.
[33:59.300 --> 34:01.300]  Yeah, it seems to be the hype lately.
[34:02.300 --> 34:03.300]  How high is it going to go?
[34:04.300 --> 34:05.300]  A million eventually.
[34:06.300 --> 34:07.300]  Is that what they're saying?
[34:08.300 --> 34:09.300]  You hear things from different people.
[34:10.300 --> 34:14.300]  But yeah, I think that within 10 years, you hear people saying it could be a million dollars.
[34:15.300 --> 34:17.300]  I heard within five years, $250,000.
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.980]  It's, you know, I think it wouldn't be a bad investment.
[34:21.980 --> 34:23.980]  I'm waiting for it to go down below $20,000 before I buy more.
[34:24.980 --> 34:25.980]  I'm hoping that that happens.
[34:26.980 --> 34:27.980]  I doubt it will, but...
[34:28.980 --> 34:29.980]  Yeah, that's going to take a while.
[34:30.980 --> 34:31.980]  Yeah.
[34:32.980 --> 34:33.980]  Well, we got Elon Musk who just put $1.5 billion.
[34:34.980 --> 34:35.980]  And so he doesn't want it to go down to that level.
[34:36.980 --> 34:37.980]  He lost half of his investment.
[34:38.980 --> 34:39.980]  I follow him a bit, you know, and he likes pushing stuff around.
[34:40.980 --> 34:41.980]  So he's playing with people.
[34:42.980 --> 34:43.980]  Is it his money or Tesla's money?
[34:44.980 --> 34:45.980]  Yeah, it's Tesla's money.
[34:46.660 --> 34:47.660]  He's manipulating the market with his company's money.
[34:48.660 --> 34:49.660]  It's great.
[34:50.660 --> 34:53.660]  Yeah, but I read something that US government is going to change some law about that.
[34:54.660 --> 34:58.660]  Because too many big companies are investing billions in crypto money and they're not too happy about it.
[34:59.660 --> 35:01.660]  So that's probably not going to last too long either.
[35:02.660 --> 35:05.660]  Well, with banks looking at crypto too, I mean, I think crypto is the future.
[35:06.660 --> 35:07.660]  There's definitely future in crypto.
[35:08.660 --> 35:09.660]  It's not going away.
[35:10.660 --> 35:12.660]  No, it just won't be so easy to get it.
[35:13.660 --> 35:14.660]  Right.
[35:15.340 --> 35:16.340]  So Musk should be in jail.
[35:17.340 --> 35:18.340]  We have comments here.
[35:19.340 --> 35:20.340]  Someone says Musk should be in jail.
[35:21.340 --> 35:22.340]  I don't think so.
[35:23.340 --> 35:24.340]  Why is that?
[35:25.340 --> 35:26.340]  Why should he be in jail?
[35:27.340 --> 35:28.340]  Yeah, because he's successful, right?
[35:29.340 --> 35:30.340]  I don't know.
[35:30.340 --> 35:32.340]  Look, you know, he's a great entrepreneur doing crazy stuff, building tunnels and shooting rockets to the moon.
[35:33.340 --> 35:34.340]  And, you know, I don't know.
[35:35.340 --> 35:38.340]  But yeah, who knows, man?
[35:39.340 --> 35:40.340]  We're just simple marijuana growers, you know?
[35:41.340 --> 35:42.340]  Yeah.
[35:43.020 --> 35:45.020]  Hey, I'm with Soma buying gold bars, you know?
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.020]  So is he still in the gold, Soma?
[35:49.020 --> 35:50.020]  I'm sure he's still in the gold and the silver.
[35:51.020 --> 35:53.020]  He's been preaching that for ever since I've known him.
[35:54.020 --> 35:57.020]  And how much is the gold price now compared to 20 years ago?
[35:58.020 --> 35:59.020]  It hasn't gone up.
[36:00.020 --> 36:05.020]  Well, it's got, you know, I guess 20 years ago in 2000, it was $400 an ounce.
[36:06.020 --> 36:08.020]  And now it's like $1,800 an ounce.
[36:09.020 --> 36:10.020]  That's not a bad investment.
[36:10.700 --> 36:11.700]  So I think $1,200, right?
[36:12.700 --> 36:14.700]  $1,200 more in 20 years?
[36:15.700 --> 36:16.700]  Yeah.
[36:17.700 --> 36:18.700]  Four times?
[36:19.700 --> 36:20.700]  $80 a year.
[36:21.700 --> 36:22.700]  Yeah.
[36:22.700 --> 36:23.700]  I mean, as a long-term investment, it's not a bad thing.
[36:24.700 --> 36:25.700]  Like silver jumps up and down so much.
[36:26.700 --> 36:27.700]  Silver, I think, is undervalued.
[36:28.700 --> 36:29.700]  So eventually silver is supposed to go up.
[36:30.700 --> 36:35.700]  So I think silver is a real interesting investment, you know, but that silver, you know, goes up and down.
[36:36.700 --> 36:37.700]  So you can buy it at $12 and sell it at $30.
[36:38.380 --> 36:39.380]  You know, Soma's all up on that stuff.
[36:40.380 --> 36:43.380]  I guarantee you, we'll get him on the show one of these days to talk about silver and gold.
[36:44.380 --> 36:48.380]  And just quickly, James is not offering professional investment advice.
[36:49.380 --> 36:50.380]  Not at all.
[36:51.380 --> 36:52.380]  Not at all.
[36:53.380 --> 36:54.380]  Yeah, my investments are never that great.
[36:55.380 --> 37:02.380]  So investments in seeds, you know, I got a, we got seeds, we got gelato autos available on the website today.
[37:03.380 --> 37:04.380]  I got a little show and tell stuff too.
[37:05.380 --> 37:06.380]  We got some pollen.
[37:07.060 --> 37:09.060]  This is a great way to preserve your pollen, guys.
[37:10.060 --> 37:16.060]  With your whole plants after you've pollinated them, if you're trying to preserve them for the future, you can separate it.
[37:17.060 --> 37:21.060]  Or like if you're lazy like me, sometimes you can just put them in a jar like this and you can sift it out.
[37:22.060 --> 37:27.060]  You can actually get pollen bags that you use for the bubble bags and shake them right over your plants.
[37:28.060 --> 37:29.060]  It works great.
[37:30.060 --> 37:31.060]  How long will you keep your pollen in that jar?
[37:32.060 --> 37:35.060]  Oh, my pollen, this will be here for maybe a month.
[37:35.740 --> 37:37.740]  How long will it stay kind of fertile enough?
[37:38.740 --> 37:47.740]  If you use desiccant packs and you keep them in the fridge or you keep it cooler, it'll last, you know, it'll start within three months.
[37:48.740 --> 37:49.740]  It's not going to be as good within six months.
[37:50.740 --> 37:51.740]  You got to throw it away.
[37:52.740 --> 37:53.740]  Yeah.
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.740]  You know, and I mean, there are people that preserve pollen, you know, in the freezer.
[37:57.740 --> 38:01.740]  You can, you know, here's an example of some really, you know, this is pollen that I haven't mixed with any flour.
[38:02.420 --> 38:04.420]  This is right here.
[38:05.420 --> 38:08.420]  We've got creme rosé dosie times gelato 41.
[38:09.420 --> 38:13.420]  And this, this I haven't mixed.
[38:14.420 --> 38:20.420]  I typically mix it with and then put desiccants and put them either freeze or in the refrigerator, depending on how soon I'm using it.
[38:21.420 --> 38:22.420]  But how do you guys preserve your pollen?
[38:23.420 --> 38:25.420]  Or how long do you preserve it for?
[38:26.420 --> 38:28.420]  Like the fresh metal, but most of the time we use it directly.
[38:29.420 --> 38:30.420]  Yeah.
[38:31.100 --> 38:33.100]  You know, so we don't preserve a lot.
[38:34.100 --> 38:37.100]  We've got the males on side or we spray the females.
[38:38.100 --> 38:39.100]  Yeah.
[38:40.100 --> 38:41.100]  Yeah, I do.
[38:42.100 --> 38:46.100]  We also work with like a lot of varieties, you know, like 60 to 100.
[38:47.100 --> 38:50.100]  So you want to more hit quickly and move on.
[38:51.100 --> 38:52.100]  Right.
[38:53.100 --> 38:56.100]  You know, you don't need too many different males going around.
[38:57.100 --> 38:58.100]  Yeah.
[38:59.100 --> 39:00.100]  Cross pollination is a bad thing when you're making seeds.
[39:01.100 --> 39:02.100]  But what, yeah.
[39:03.100 --> 39:09.100]  So like what I try to do is I try to use a redundancy because sometimes some of the newer varieties I'm working with, I don't know how they're going to respond.
[39:10.100 --> 39:14.100]  So I try to collect pollen in advance so I can apply it if necessary.
[39:15.100 --> 39:23.100]  I just, I've had some interesting issues coming up, you know, in the past I've had problems with pollinating plants where it didn't reverse that well and I had to dry it out.
[39:24.100 --> 39:25.100]  And then my, my yields on my seeds weren't that good.
[39:26.100 --> 39:27.100]  So, but now I'm using a nano silver.
[39:27.780 --> 39:36.780]  I don't know if you guys have switched over to nano silver or using nano silver, but one of my friends recipes, it works great and it reverses almost every plant.
[39:37.780 --> 39:41.780]  Like even Blue Dream, which has been difficult, was something that easily reversed with it.
[39:42.780 --> 39:44.780]  So you guys still use STS or?
[39:45.780 --> 39:46.780]  Yeah.
[39:47.780 --> 39:48.780]  No.
[39:48.780 --> 39:50.780]  I haven't heard about that nano silver yet.
[39:51.780 --> 39:52.780]  We'll try it out.
[39:53.780 --> 39:56.780]  It's always nice to hear from friends some new stuff, you know, we can fool around with.
[39:57.780 --> 39:58.780]  Well, the nice thing with nano silver is the plant health.
[39:59.780 --> 40:03.780]  So, you know, with STS, the more you spray it, the worse the plant looks.
[40:04.780 --> 40:09.780]  And with nano silver, it's like colloidal silver in the same sense where your plant stays super healthy the whole time.
[40:10.780 --> 40:16.780]  So I got a question off the top of my head, but who created, who was the first person to figure out how to do feminized seeds?
[40:17.780 --> 40:18.780]  I think there's a lot.
[40:19.780 --> 40:20.780]  I've heard Hank was the one.
[40:21.780 --> 40:25.780]  Oh man, he came out of the normal agriculture industry in Holland way in the, I don't know, in the fifties, sixties.
[40:26.460 --> 40:27.460]  Oh wow.
[40:28.460 --> 40:29.460]  No, it's a very, you can look it up.
[40:30.460 --> 40:39.460]  It's coming out of the normal, look, science in Holland on, on, yeah, still 60 to 70% of all world seeds come from the north of Holland.
[40:40.460 --> 40:47.460]  Where it's like 15 huge companies that make all kinds of seeds with amazing machines.
[40:48.140 --> 40:59.140]  And yeah, they have the, of course they have the, the University of Wageningen, which is one of the most advanced agriculture universities in the world that supplies all those people.
[41:00.140 --> 41:05.140]  I think even right now, because we were talking about hiring more people, but really professionals.
[41:06.140 --> 41:14.140]  And then they said there's 1200 open jobs in that area that they cannot fill in because they're so specific, you know?
[41:14.820 --> 41:19.820]  So, yeah, that's, that's where it all originates from this whole flower industry.
[41:20.820 --> 41:22.820]  That's where basically we come from, you know?
[41:23.820 --> 41:28.820]  And then I think, I think Dutch Passion was the first to implement it.
[41:29.820 --> 41:30.820]  I'm not really sure.
[41:31.820 --> 41:35.820]  And then, yeah, we shortly after implemented and some other guys, you know, now everybody's doing it, of course.
[41:36.820 --> 41:37.820]  And in the beginning, everyone is complaining.
[41:38.820 --> 41:43.820]  Yeah, it's not, the plants are not so healthy as regular plants, which is bullshit.
[41:44.820 --> 41:45.820]  They're exactly the same.
[41:46.820 --> 41:47.820]  There's no difference, I would say.
[41:48.820 --> 41:59.820]  And now it's very common practice because, yeah, you can imagine if you live in Tokyo or in New York and you buy 10 seeds and six are males and you're growing very illegal, you know, that doesn't help a lot.
[42:00.820 --> 42:01.820]  You want to have 10 females.
[42:02.820 --> 42:05.820]  So, yeah, it's a great thing for the people.
[42:06.820 --> 42:13.820]  I think it's for the customer because many of our colleagues, breeders always said, yeah, it's not a way to go.
[42:14.820 --> 42:19.820]  But I think for the customer, it's the best they can have, you know, they always have females.
[42:20.820 --> 42:23.820]  So you get more and more for your money.
[42:24.820 --> 42:26.820]  It seems to be spreading in America also lately.
[42:27.820 --> 42:29.820]  I see more and more seed banks that are doing feminized seeds.
[42:30.820 --> 42:38.820]  Before it was kind of not hard, you know, but when you would see the top of the players, you know, all the super hype stuff, they would have mainly regular lines.
[42:39.820 --> 42:41.820]  And now I see a lot are going to feminize.
[42:42.500 --> 42:44.500]  So let's see, you know, in 5-10 years how it is in America.
[42:45.500 --> 42:48.500]  In 5 years, all those Americans all have feminized seeds.
[42:49.500 --> 42:50.500]  Agreed.
[42:51.500 --> 42:53.500]  I think it's going the same way also because the market is just opening.
[42:54.500 --> 42:56.500]  So you just have regular lines.
[42:57.500 --> 43:00.500]  We will emphasize what they all said 10 years ago about the Dutch.
[43:03.500 --> 43:07.500]  It's funny because everyone was so scared of feminized seeds in the 90s.
[43:08.500 --> 43:09.500]  Even I thought, oh man, it's going to ruin the gene pool.
[43:10.180 --> 43:14.180]  And that's just because we were told that by other people who weren't educated.
[43:15.180 --> 43:16.180]  Uneducated.
[43:17.180 --> 43:18.180]  Uneducated completely.
[43:19.180 --> 43:20.180]  And I think there was problems with hermaphrodites.
[43:21.180 --> 43:22.180]  And I think that was the big thing.
[43:23.180 --> 43:24.180]  But you have that problem whether it's regular or feminized.
[43:25.180 --> 43:26.180]  Yeah, that's a genetic problem.
[43:27.180 --> 43:28.180]  That's a genetic problem.
[43:29.180 --> 43:31.180]  That's what's in this really good genetics in America, you know.
[43:32.180 --> 43:35.180]  In most of our lands, we hardly have any hermaphrodites.
[43:35.860 --> 43:39.860]  But at the moment, these super varieties in America are so inbred and crossed and overcrossed.
[43:40.860 --> 43:41.860]  And God knows what happened to all to them.
[43:42.860 --> 43:43.860]  Then you have all these problems, you know.
[43:44.860 --> 43:51.860]  And it's the same when people accuse us of polluting an area in Africa or Asia with the strains we have.
[43:52.860 --> 43:58.860]  But we see in four generations, the local land race just outgrown the genetics we brought there.
[43:59.860 --> 44:04.860]  The European genetics have absolutely zero chance against a local land race.
[44:05.860 --> 44:06.860]  It just gets demolished.
[44:07.860 --> 44:14.860]  Yeah, I got some hate mail about you coming on the show about you going to places and bringing your genetics and ruining the gene pool.
[44:15.860 --> 44:18.860]  And I think that people need to understand that it's just not true.
[44:19.860 --> 44:23.860]  Ask them for a scientific report that backs that up, you know.
[44:24.860 --> 44:29.860]  Yeah, you would need really millions and millions of seeds and during a lot of years to do it.
[44:30.860 --> 44:31.860]  It doesn't make any sense.
[44:32.540 --> 44:34.540]  What makes sense is to help poor people.
[44:35.540 --> 44:40.540]  And here's the whole discussion, you know, also with, look, I'm not a big fan of GM food and all that kind of stuff, you know.
[44:41.540 --> 44:46.540]  But we also have to face the world like now with the pandemic, you know.
[44:47.540 --> 44:48.540]  And also we have to face the world.
[44:49.540 --> 44:50.540]  And where I'm from Africa, and Africa is going to double in size.
[44:51.540 --> 44:55.540]  And we're going on this planet, we're going from 7 to 12 billion people.
[44:56.220 --> 45:06.220]  Now we already know that our cattle is responsible for 25% of all our CO2 problems and all these things that are happening in the world.
[45:07.220 --> 45:09.220]  And we all know that this is not sustainable, you know.
[45:10.220 --> 45:11.220]  We can't eat seven days a week meat anymore.
[45:12.220 --> 45:14.220]  We're going to have to bring that back to once a week or not at all.
[45:15.220 --> 45:24.220]  And then the land that we're going to use, we have to use that for proper farming, you know, responsible farming.
[45:24.900 --> 45:27.900]  But even then, we probably don't have enough.
[45:28.900 --> 45:34.900]  So then you're going to come in a situation, okay, or we're going to let a lot of people die.
[45:35.900 --> 45:38.900]  Literally, like what happens occasionally in some parts of the world.
[45:39.900 --> 45:44.900]  Or we're going to create a super seed, which only needs 25% of the water that it needs now.
[45:45.900 --> 45:49.900]  It can be corn or can be some vegetables, God knows what.
[45:50.900 --> 45:52.900]  And it grows like six weeks faster.
[45:53.580 --> 45:58.580]  So this means we can produce 25% more so we can feed 25% more.
[45:59.580 --> 46:04.580]  You know, the thing is, this is an ethical question and everybody has to answer that question for himself.
[46:05.580 --> 46:06.580]  How are we going to solve this problem?
[46:07.580 --> 46:12.580]  Because the problem is that to control the world population is not a problem, you know.
[46:13.580 --> 46:14.580]  And is that ethical, you know.
[46:15.580 --> 46:17.580]  So I don't know.
[46:18.580 --> 46:19.580]  It's on everybody's plate now.
[46:20.580 --> 46:21.580]  You can choose.
[46:22.260 --> 46:25.260]  Yeah, and I think there's a lot of people that don't understand it fully.
[46:26.260 --> 46:33.260]  But, you know, I think glyphosate, glyphosate, they are probably a problem.
[46:34.260 --> 46:35.260]  Roundup is a problem. We know that's bad.
[46:36.260 --> 46:37.260]  Roundup is a huge problem.
[46:38.260 --> 46:40.260]  Yeah, I mean, I think we can all agree that it's a huge problem.
[46:41.260 --> 46:44.260]  And I think rounding everything up to, you know, I think even molecular breeding.
[46:45.260 --> 46:51.260]  People don't understand that molecular breeding, you know, GMO and actually breeding with data are two different things.
[46:52.260 --> 46:53.260]  That you can actually take analytics and breed.
[46:54.260 --> 46:57.260]  We don't necessarily need to breed cannabis GMO yet.
[46:58.260 --> 46:59.260]  And there may be some benefits down the road.
[47:00.260 --> 47:02.260]  But I think everything should be explored.
[47:03.260 --> 47:04.260]  And I've gotten a lot of shit for that in the past.
[47:05.260 --> 47:06.260]  But I feel like, you know, we're talking about science here.
[47:07.260 --> 47:08.260]  I think we need to explore all options.
[47:09.260 --> 47:10.260]  We need to take these things very seriously.
[47:11.260 --> 47:14.260]  And I'll get a lot of shit about the whole GMO thing.
[47:15.260 --> 47:18.260]  But it's like, I think data driven breeding is super important.
[47:18.940 --> 47:20.940]  Yeah, it's definitely on the way.
[47:21.940 --> 47:24.940]  You can see a lot of medicinal projects, you know, that are starting to think about it.
[47:25.940 --> 47:28.940]  And starting in how they could apply this to everything.
[47:29.940 --> 47:30.940]  It's definitely the future for sure.
[47:31.940 --> 47:32.940]  There's a lot of techniques popping out.
[47:33.940 --> 47:34.940]  And I'm open for discussion also.
[47:35.940 --> 47:36.940]  I'm like, I am in the base of it.
[47:37.940 --> 47:39.940]  I wouldn't eat some GMO food and stuff like this.
[47:40.940 --> 47:43.940]  And I try to eat as close from where I live, you know.
[47:44.620 --> 47:47.620]  Like try to really consume local.
[47:48.620 --> 47:51.620]  But yeah, I mean, it's gonna come.
[47:52.620 --> 47:58.620]  Don't forget, without us realizing, we already eat a lot of GM food.
[47:59.620 --> 48:00.620]  Oh, yeah.
[48:01.620 --> 48:02.620]  If you eat any GMO product.
[48:03.620 --> 48:04.620]  95% of soy beans is already GM.
[48:05.620 --> 48:06.620]  Yeah.
[48:07.620 --> 48:08.620]  If you go, and this is the other problem we have.
[48:09.620 --> 48:10.620]  If you go all the way from Japan, all the way down to Indonesia.
[48:11.620 --> 48:12.620]  And I live in Malaysia.
[48:13.300 --> 48:14.300]  Singapore and Indonesia.
[48:15.300 --> 48:16.300]  There's one big rice grain.
[48:17.300 --> 48:18.300]  Yeah.
[48:19.300 --> 48:21.300]  Because, of course, it gives more crop, you know, and blah, blah, blah.
[48:22.300 --> 48:23.300]  But here again, there you go.
[48:24.300 --> 48:30.300]  You know, if one animal or one virus comes, you kill 800 million people.
[48:31.300 --> 48:33.300]  It's like the Cavendish banana.
[48:34.300 --> 48:35.300]  What's the Cavendish?
[48:36.300 --> 48:39.300]  Well, like globally, there's kind of one banana cultivar.
[48:40.300 --> 48:41.300]  Yes.
[48:41.980 --> 48:42.980]  Yeah.
[48:43.980 --> 48:44.980]  And don't forget banana.
[48:45.980 --> 48:47.980]  You know how many times bananas save my life?
[48:48.980 --> 48:51.980]  Life is a big word because I always have cans of tuna also with me.
[48:52.980 --> 48:56.980]  But in the Bushman, wherever you are, you know, a bunch of bananas.
[48:57.980 --> 48:58.980]  You know, you can do a whole day on one banana.
[48:59.980 --> 49:01.980]  You can live with 30 bananas.
[49:02.980 --> 49:03.980]  You can live 30 days, you know.
[49:04.980 --> 49:06.980]  So it's a very important product.
[49:07.980 --> 49:08.980]  Yeah.
[49:09.660 --> 49:10.660]  But this is the whole discussion we're having.
[49:11.660 --> 49:14.660]  And people are just screaming and not realizing what they're saying, you know,
[49:15.660 --> 49:18.660]  when they talk about these land races or when we talk about power.
[49:19.660 --> 49:21.660]  Look, you know, America is the perfect country.
[49:22.660 --> 49:26.660]  Donald Trump killed the Paris environment thing, you know.
[49:27.660 --> 49:28.660]  Now Joe Biden is signing it again.
[49:29.660 --> 49:36.660]  But we all, I think, what is it, 2030 or 2050, we have to be carbon print neutral or something?
[49:37.660 --> 49:38.660]  Right.
[49:39.340 --> 49:40.340]  It's impossible.
[49:41.340 --> 49:42.340]  It's impossible.
[49:42.340 --> 49:44.340]  It's impossible where we go from 7 to 12 billion people.
[49:45.340 --> 49:48.340]  My father says it's possible that he says you have to build nuclear power.
[49:49.340 --> 49:50.340]  Yeah.
[49:51.340 --> 49:54.340]  My father is a science guy, you know, he said, he said, everybody's crazy in this world.
[49:55.340 --> 49:56.340]  You guys making it way too complicated.
[49:57.340 --> 49:58.340]  You're polluting the whole ocean with windmills.
[49:59.340 --> 50:00.340]  Just put nuclear power.
[50:01.340 --> 50:02.340]  It's the cleanest power there is.
[50:03.340 --> 50:06.340]  And if you do it safe and you don't put it on an earthquake line or with a crazy dictator,
[50:07.020 --> 50:08.020]  he says it's the safest thing.
[50:09.020 --> 50:10.020]  It solves all your problem.
[50:11.020 --> 50:13.020]  So, you know, I don't know, you know, I'm not an expert on these kind of things,
[50:14.020 --> 50:16.020]  but one person says this, the other person says that.
[50:17.020 --> 50:20.020]  But we all understand when we go from 7 to 12 billion people.
[50:21.020 --> 50:24.020]  And we are already having a problem.
[50:25.020 --> 50:26.020]  Look at this pandemic.
[50:27.020 --> 50:30.020]  And with this pandemic, we are blaming, now we're blaming the Chinese.
[50:31.020 --> 50:34.020]  But don't forget Ebola and HIV came from Africa.
[50:34.700 --> 50:37.700]  And my country here in Holland, we got all kinds of crazy stuff, you know,
[50:38.700 --> 50:39.700]  like mad cow disease.
[50:40.700 --> 50:42.700]  We have this goat thing, they call it the Q fever.
[50:43.700 --> 50:46.700]  Came in Holland from South Holland because we're one of the countries in the world
[50:47.700 --> 50:49.700]  where we put the most animals small together in stables.
[50:50.700 --> 50:52.700]  You know, this kind of factory farming, which is not good.
[50:53.700 --> 50:55.700]  So, yeah, you know, the whole world is to blame.
[50:56.700 --> 51:00.700]  It is not, it's just a way of how we evolved in the last, let's say,
[51:01.700 --> 51:02.700]  after the Second World War.
[51:03.380 --> 51:06.380]  So in the last 80 years, you know, this industrial thing.
[51:07.380 --> 51:11.380]  And if this planet will keep, want to make a profit,
[51:12.380 --> 51:16.380]  instead of becoming profit neutral, like where we kind of say,
[51:17.380 --> 51:19.380]  okay guys, you know, this is kind of the level we should be living in.
[51:20.380 --> 51:21.380]  But everybody wants more and more and more.
[51:22.380 --> 51:25.380]  That also will not help to keep this neutral carbon footprint
[51:26.380 --> 51:27.380]  in the next 20 or 40 years.
[51:28.380 --> 51:31.380]  So it's all very complicated, but we are pot growers, you know,
[51:32.060 --> 51:36.060]  and we know, I remember one old thing when I was talking to Jack Herrera,
[51:37.060 --> 51:40.060]  I don't know when that was, late 80s, early 90s.
[51:41.060 --> 51:45.060]  He said, if we put 4% of the world full of marijuana,
[51:46.060 --> 51:49.060]  which is of course technically impossible because 4% is a huge amount of hectares.
[51:50.060 --> 51:53.060]  He said, it will bring the CO2 down with 30%.
[51:54.060 --> 51:55.060]  Yeah.
[51:56.060 --> 51:57.060]  Yeah.
[51:58.060 --> 51:59.060]  You know, so.
[51:59.740 --> 52:00.740]  I mean, but these are all possibilities.
[52:01.740 --> 52:03.740]  If we get together and we plan properly,
[52:04.740 --> 52:07.740]  but it's so complicated because there's so many governments at hand,
[52:08.740 --> 52:11.740]  so many people, and we have exponential growth with people,
[52:12.740 --> 52:13.740]  and we have a limited amount of resources.
[52:14.740 --> 52:16.740]  And so eventually those resources and that's going to cross.
[52:17.740 --> 52:19.740]  And the big thing with that is human suffering.
[52:20.740 --> 52:21.740]  We're just going to see more and more suffering.
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.740]  Disease, I mean, this is, you know, the disease is,
[52:25.740 --> 52:27.740]  you know, like if we're looking at COVID,
[52:28.420 --> 52:29.420]  I mean, COVID is the reason,
[52:30.420 --> 52:32.420]  the problem is because of the population we have in the world.
[52:33.420 --> 52:34.420]  Exactly.
[52:35.420 --> 52:37.420]  And COVID is nothing because we've been talking and talking in Canada, everywhere.
[52:38.420 --> 52:40.420]  And I told my team this was going to come for years.
[52:41.420 --> 52:43.420]  And I predict you the next one will come in the next 15 years.
[52:44.420 --> 52:46.420]  And it will wipe out one on eight or one on 12.
[52:47.420 --> 52:48.420]  Yeah.
[52:48.420 --> 52:49.420]  The next one.
[52:50.420 --> 52:54.420]  And the power of nature is so strong that it will kind of put us back in our cage.
[52:55.420 --> 52:56.420]  You know, at one point,
[52:57.100 --> 52:58.100]  like it's basically doing now.
[52:59.100 --> 53:00.100]  Yeah.
[53:01.100 --> 53:04.100]  And then also here, you know, we are not united at all.
[53:05.100 --> 53:06.100]  Yeah.
[53:07.100 --> 53:08.100]  Europe does its own thing.
[53:09.100 --> 53:10.100]  And within Europe, we don't do our own thing.
[53:11.100 --> 53:12.100]  In America, every state does its own thing.
[53:13.100 --> 53:14.100]  That's a little bit like Europe.
[53:15.100 --> 53:16.100]  And then if you go to Asia, they're much more organized.
[53:17.100 --> 53:19.100]  You know, there with New Year, everybody was partying again.
[53:20.100 --> 53:22.100]  You know, so you saw Taiwan, you saw New Zealand,
[53:23.100 --> 53:26.100]  you know, 10,000, 20,000 people on the street with a bottle of champagne.
[53:27.100 --> 53:28.100]  Here it's impossible.
[53:29.100 --> 53:30.100]  They're much stricter in their lockdowns.
[53:31.100 --> 53:32.100]  They're much stricter in their testing.
[53:33.100 --> 53:34.100]  They're much stricter with everything.
[53:35.100 --> 53:36.100]  And they do it properly for four weeks.
[53:37.100 --> 53:38.100]  And everybody stays at home and we all go chill.
[53:39.100 --> 53:40.100]  And then in four weeks, it's all good.
[53:41.100 --> 53:42.100]  And we do massive testing.
[53:43.100 --> 53:44.100]  Now, what we do here in Europe, we leave all the borders open.
[53:45.100 --> 53:46.100]  Some kids go to school.
[53:47.100 --> 53:48.100]  Some kids don't go to school.
[53:49.100 --> 53:50.100]  Some people go work.
[53:51.100 --> 53:52.100]  Some people don't go to work.
[53:53.100 --> 53:54.100]  Airplanes keep flying.
[53:55.100 --> 53:56.100]  America stays open.
[53:56.780 --> 53:58.780]  We are really smart and then bring the virus back to America.
[53:59.780 --> 54:00.780]  You know what to say.
[54:01.780 --> 54:02.780]  And now we're all in a mess here.
[54:03.780 --> 54:04.780]  Yeah.
[54:05.780 --> 54:06.780]  Yeah.
[54:06.780 --> 54:07.780]  I mean, they're quarantining for a month over in China.
[54:08.780 --> 54:09.780]  You want to go to China, you have to quarantine for a full month.
[54:10.780 --> 54:11.780]  You know, and that's you don't get to leave the house.
[54:12.780 --> 54:13.780]  They actually come test you during that period.
[54:14.780 --> 54:15.780]  They'll come to the door and they come and test you.
[54:16.780 --> 54:17.780]  I was a big Dutch DJ going to Taiwan.
[54:18.780 --> 54:19.780]  And what they basically do, they give you a SIM card.
[54:20.780 --> 54:21.780]  They call you once a day.
[54:22.780 --> 54:23.780]  And they give you a SIM card.
[54:24.460 --> 54:25.460]  They call you once a day.
[54:26.460 --> 54:27.460]  And they see they track you on a SIM card.
[54:28.460 --> 54:29.460]  Wow.
[54:30.460 --> 54:31.460]  So you can't go nowhere.
[54:32.460 --> 54:33.460]  You know, it's basically like a house arrest.
[54:34.460 --> 54:37.460]  So they give you a SIM card and you have to pick up the phone when the government calls you.
[54:38.460 --> 54:39.460]  And they call you once a day.
[54:40.460 --> 54:41.460]  And you don't know when they call.
[54:42.460 --> 54:43.460]  And you must tell where you are, of course.
[54:44.460 --> 54:45.460]  But yeah, you can't go out of the house because that's the end of it, you know.
[54:46.460 --> 54:47.460]  But they got it under control.
[54:48.460 --> 54:49.460]  They definitely have the virus under control.
[54:50.460 --> 54:51.460]  You know, there's a lot more fear over there.
[54:52.140 --> 54:53.140]  And a lot less freedom in some ways.
[54:54.140 --> 54:55.140]  And, you know, it's a different way of life.
[54:56.140 --> 54:57.140]  No, it's the way you look at it, you know.
[54:58.140 --> 54:59.140]  Maybe that's true in China or in some parts of Hong Kong.
[55:00.140 --> 55:01.140]  If you are politically motivated.
[55:02.140 --> 55:03.140]  But that's not the case in Taiwan or in South Korea or in Japan.
[55:04.140 --> 55:05.140]  There you're really free, you know.
[55:06.140 --> 55:07.140]  Yeah.
[55:08.140 --> 55:09.140]  Also, if you look at Africa, what surprises me, there's not so much problems as there
[55:10.140 --> 55:11.140]  are in Europe.
[55:12.140 --> 55:13.140]  In fact, I've been to Africa.
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.140]  I've been to the Philippines.
[55:16.140 --> 55:17.140]  I've been to the Philippines.
[55:18.140 --> 55:19.140]  I've been to the Philippines.
[55:19.820 --> 55:20.820]  There's not so much problems as there are in Europe and in America.
[55:21.820 --> 55:22.820]  Hmm.
[55:23.820 --> 55:24.820]  Probably made due to overweight and the way we eat.
[55:25.820 --> 55:26.820]  Right.
[55:27.820 --> 55:28.820]  Probably.
[55:29.820 --> 55:30.820]  But we'll know that in the next two or three years when all these results will
[55:31.820 --> 55:32.820]  come out and they will explain us.
[55:33.820 --> 55:34.820]  Like Tanzania, for example, they're not even doing anything.
[55:35.820 --> 55:36.820]  No borders closed.
[55:37.820 --> 55:38.820]  Everything is open.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.820]  Like, no, we don't have COVID here.
[55:41.820 --> 55:42.820]  I don't know what's going on in Tanzania.
[55:43.820 --> 55:44.820]  I'm not sure.
[55:45.820 --> 55:46.820]  I don't know.
[55:47.500 --> 55:48.500]  I don't know what's going on in Tanzania.
[55:49.500 --> 55:50.500]  But it's pretty funny.
[55:51.500 --> 55:52.500]  Yeah.
[55:53.500 --> 55:56.500]  We have a lot of people thinking it's a hoax here, too, you know, and it's definitely
[55:57.500 --> 55:58.500]  real, you know, but.
[55:59.500 --> 56:02.500]  No, but look in Australia, the Melbourne Cup now, another tennis team is going on.
[56:03.500 --> 56:04.500]  Yeah.
[56:05.500 --> 56:08.500]  So the Latvian audience coming 20,000 instead of 40,000 every day.
[56:09.500 --> 56:10.500]  So half the people.
[56:11.500 --> 56:12.500]  Yeah.
[56:13.500 --> 56:14.500]  Which is smart.
[56:15.500 --> 56:16.500]  And it was good for a week.
[56:17.500 --> 56:22.500]  The whole stadium was empty during the game because in the whole state of New South Wales,
[56:23.500 --> 56:26.500]  which is Melbourne and or Victoria, I don't know exactly Melbourne, New South Wales.
[56:27.500 --> 56:32.500]  There was three positive COVID patients in two million people or something.
[56:33.500 --> 56:34.500]  All state locked up.
[56:35.500 --> 56:36.500]  Wow.
[56:37.500 --> 56:38.500]  This is Australia.
[56:39.500 --> 56:40.500]  This is a Western country.
[56:41.500 --> 56:46.500]  They implement the same rule as the as the as the Asians do, you know, and it works.
[56:47.500 --> 56:48.500]  Mm hmm.
[56:49.500 --> 56:50.500]  Yeah.
[56:50.500 --> 56:51.500]  COVID is not going away anytime soon.
[56:52.500 --> 56:55.500]  It's going to have to be something that we learn to live with and learn to be healthier
[56:56.500 --> 56:57.500]  and, you know, practice, have healthier practices.
[56:58.500 --> 56:59.500]  And, you know, it's it's.
[57:00.500 --> 57:01.500]  It's a new flu.
[57:02.500 --> 57:03.500]  It's a new flu.
[57:03.500 --> 57:04.500]  It will never go away.
[57:05.500 --> 57:06.500]  Yeah.
[57:06.500 --> 57:07.500]  And we don't even know what's going to happen.
[57:08.500 --> 57:09.500]  It could evolve into the common cold.
[57:10.500 --> 57:11.500]  I mean, there's so many things we don't know about it.
[57:12.500 --> 57:13.500]  And I think people just want to live in fear, too.
[57:14.500 --> 57:15.500]  But, you know, there's a balance.
[57:16.180 --> 57:17.180]  But, yeah.
[57:18.180 --> 57:19.180]  So let's talk about Franco's legacy.
[57:20.180 --> 57:23.180]  And, you know, I saw you guys have created the Franco Loha Fund.
[57:24.180 --> 57:25.180]  What is Franco's legacy?
[57:26.180 --> 57:27.180]  You know, it's like he did so much for the community.
[57:28.180 --> 57:33.180]  He was by far the most passionate person I've ever met regarding cannabis.
[57:34.180 --> 57:36.180]  You know, he would be like we'd smoke weed together.
[57:37.180 --> 57:40.180]  When I first met you guys in 2012, I had concentrates in Europe.
[57:41.180 --> 57:44.180]  And I think I was one of the first people to bring the different varieties of
[57:44.860 --> 57:47.860]  concentrates all to one place where I had 16 different things to show people.
[57:48.860 --> 57:49.860]  Franco went crazy and he's like, fuck, I love this.
[57:50.860 --> 57:51.860]  I want to try this.
[57:52.860 --> 57:53.860]  I want to try this.
[57:54.860 --> 57:55.860]  But he loved that.
[57:56.860 --> 57:57.860]  I have the hashtag passion for the sacred plant.
[57:58.860 --> 57:59.860]  And that came from Franco, you know.
[58:00.860 --> 58:03.860]  And so what is Franco's legacy moving forward?
[58:04.860 --> 58:06.860]  Well, his movies that we created together.
[58:07.860 --> 58:08.860]  Yeah.
[58:09.860 --> 58:10.860]  That's, I think, the most important thing.
[58:11.860 --> 58:12.860]  I'm pretty proud that we pulled that off.
[58:13.540 --> 58:14.540]  I think we made nine or something.
[58:15.540 --> 58:16.540]  I'm not sure.
[58:17.540 --> 58:18.540]  And yeah, that's his biggest legacy.
[58:19.540 --> 58:20.540]  That says it all, you know.
[58:21.540 --> 58:26.540]  Big smile, always happy, going, taking much more risks than all the other teams
[58:27.540 --> 58:31.540]  and seed companies and people in the industry doing something totally out of the box,
[58:32.540 --> 58:35.540]  showing the world what's going on, really.
[58:36.540 --> 58:41.540]  You know, Columbia, after we made a movie in Columbia, we were big in newspapers.
[58:42.220 --> 58:45.220]  You know, especially the right newspapers were really harsh on us.
[58:46.220 --> 58:48.220]  But of course, the legalization came on thing.
[58:49.220 --> 58:52.220]  And then we did St. Vincent and Trinidad.
[58:53.220 --> 58:54.220]  And we left.
[58:55.220 --> 59:00.220]  And the day we left, the government called us and we were big on the news.
[59:01.220 --> 59:05.220]  And the president, you can read it, you can see the interview with the president.
[59:06.220 --> 59:11.220]  It was on the BBC, where he stated, hey, listen, if America and Canada
[59:12.220 --> 59:15.220]  and all these countries are legalizing, I'm not going to arrest people anymore
[59:16.220 --> 59:17.220]  with an ounce of weed on the beach.
[59:18.220 --> 59:21.220]  So basically he said, hey, if you're an American tourist, a Canadian or a European tourist,
[59:22.220 --> 59:26.220]  please come to St. Vincent with Bequia Mystique, which is one of the greatest countries in the world,
[59:27.220 --> 59:30.220]  and come line the beach and have a good time and smoke a joint, you know, no problem.
[59:31.220 --> 59:34.220]  So I think that is the biggest part, what we wanted to accomplish.
[59:35.220 --> 59:39.220]  Like, you know, regulate our industry, respect our industry.
[59:39.900 --> 59:41.900]  We are also people, we like to smoke a joint.
[59:42.900 --> 59:46.900]  It's not dangerous, you know, change of politics.
[59:51.900 --> 59:55.900]  Yeah, so have you guys stayed in contact with Dr. Green, with Marcus?
[59:56.900 --> 59:57.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.900]  He's coming, normally he's coming every year to Barcelona.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.900]  Yeah, we see him a lot, we see him every year.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.900]  He comes to Amsterdam, he comes to Barcelona.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:09.580]  We're on the phone sometimes.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.580]  Yeah, he's working to passing legislation in Trinidad right now,
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.580]  him and Marlon Asher, who's my business partner.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.580]  I was in Trinidad last year and, you know, got to smoke some weed, some good stuff.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.580]  We keep missing each other, but we have a lot of mutual friends over in Trinidad.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.580]  But yeah, Trinidad, St. Vincent, I believe those countries are so amazing.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:37.260]  It's like those Caribbean countries are really very open to cannabis and legalization
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.260]  and benefiting their country.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:45.260]  And you got guys like Marcus, who's like really pushing and trying to pave the way
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.260]  for cannabis in places like Trinidad.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.260]  Yeah, yeah, let's see how that goes.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.260]  Yeah, I just, they decriminalized it.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.260]  Now they just need to pass it either for medical or for recreational.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.260]  I think that'd be great.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.260]  And then it's really implemented in the culture also.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.260]  You can see those places, they have a traditional use of marijuana.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.260]  It's like when we go in Congo, you know, most of the people, when they see me,
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.260]  they are super friendly with all the rastas, even if I'm white or whatever.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.260]  It's just, they know I'm smoking and anywhere you go in the end,
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.260]  people realize that I smoke, you know, and I don't know, it just relax people, you know.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:29.260]  So yeah, it doesn't, I think it's going to be also good in the Caribbean soon.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.940]  I hope I can come to visit you there.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.940]  Yeah, yeah. Caribbean is awesome, man.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.940]  It's a, you know, it's funny though, but most of the stuff people smoke,
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940]  there's really, really low THC.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.940]  And they smoke all day, you know, but they're smoking really low THC, borderline CBD.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.940]  You know, I smoked some stuff there where it's like, they were like,
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.940]  holy shit, you're smoking a big spliff all the way down.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:52.940]  And it's like, it wasn't really getting me high.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.940]  At the same time with the temperature and the humidity, I think it's better that way.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:01.620]  You know, I don't know if I could be able to smoke like a really fat bubble hash joint on the beach,
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.620]  40 degrees, you know, and 80% humidity.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.620]  Yeah.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.620]  It's fine like this.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.620]  Most of the weed in the Caribbean comes from St. Vincent.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620]  I don't know if you know, or if you're aware of that.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:20.620]  But I would say probably 70, 80%, you know, not from Jamaica,
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.620]  but from St. Vincent, it goes with the speed boats, with the scarabs.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.300]  You can see that in our movie, that's one of the original boats.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.300]  And it goes to Barbados, Bahamas, all those countries.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:35.300]  So yeah, that's, and there you can find some really good weed on the volcano.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.300]  But here again, guys, they are poor farmers, you know,
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.300]  they don't have much money to buy proper seeds.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:48.300]  And they need special seeds, you know, on that level.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.980]  But I've climbed that volcano with Franco and with my team.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.980]  Oh man, you have no idea.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.980]  And you can see it in our movie, you look in that huge hole, you know, from that volcano.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.980]  And then when you walk around that volcano, you see this beautiful soil where all the marijuana grows on.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:11.980]  And in the morning you see hundreds of planters with their machete walking up to that hill, you know,
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.980]  and all pass on that volcano all around.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980]  It's an amazing scene.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.660]  I lectured in St. Vincent with Marlon a little over a year ago.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:26.660]  We were there, in fact, maybe a year and a week ago.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:30.660]  We were there and I lectured to the Cannabis Authority over in St. Vincent.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.660]  And we got tours of some of the farms and it's pretty amazing.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.660]  You know, the really amazing people, you know, they're very passionate about what they're doing,
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.660]  but living in poverty, you know, I mean, some of the poorest people I've ever seen.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.660]  And who could benefit the most from the industry.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.340]  And it's a beautiful place.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.340]  Yeah.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.340]  So, yeah.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.340]  So where did you guys say you were going to go for your next Strain Hunters?
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.340]  We didn't say, because we never say.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.340]  Nice try.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.340]  If we were high, it's late, and we're drunk, we would not say.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.340]  It's a security thing, James.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.340]  Oh, totally.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.340]  Totally understood.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020]  So let's talk about autoflowers.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.020]  You know, I think you guys have a history with autoflowers.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.020]  I thought autoflowers were garbage up until, you know, about four years ago.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020]  They were.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020]  They were.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.020]  The Ruderales and the Mexican Rudy and, you know, Lowrider were all very hay-like.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.020]  I went to Spain through some people that you guys know and I know as well,
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]  and saw their stuff.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]  They got in trouble recently, but I went and saw it.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.700]  And I was just really disappointed with the autoflowers that they had to show me.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.700]  They were showing me Bubba Kush and they had like an Amnesia, Super Lemon Haze auto,
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.700]  and it was just garbage.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.700]  But they've come a long ways.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.700]  What's your guys' experience with autoflowers?
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.700]  You mean the company that's closed now?
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:00.700]  Yes.
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:02.700]  Yes.
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:03.700]  Yeah, that's a different story.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.700]  Now maybe Dustin can tell a little bit.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.700]  How long have you been going on this podcast?
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.700]  What's that?
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380]  How long are we on here?
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.380]  We got about another hour.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.380]  Oh, we got another hour.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380]  Okay, cool.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.380]  Look, the good thing, I agree with you totally.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.380]  The autoflowers, I think in the beginning, they were pretty bad.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.380]  You know, you couldn't really find the profile you were looking for.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.380]  But yeah, look, one of the good and bad points, it's a bad point for the breeder kind of,
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:36.380]  but good for the customer, is that you can't really keep a mother plant of an auto plant, you know.
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.060]  So each generation is a new generation.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.060]  And with that, if you keep breeding the plant, you know, instead of just using the same pollen
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.060]  or whatever that you saved, you know, and you keep just breeding with a better phenotype
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.060]  of each plant every time.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.060]  And now some of those autos, they are maybe like F25, you know.
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:59.060]  It's like a 25th generation and just being kept going.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.060]  And I found some really good plants.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:07.740]  I don't put them a lot myself because if I want a short flowering time, I just flower directly.
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.740]  And I put 12-12 in indoor.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:14.740]  So the only place I would use it is outdoor, like where you don't have a really low time
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:16.740]  and you want to flower fast.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.740]  But yeah, I think it's definitely improving.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.740]  We've been doing a few crosses, you know, also test crosses with some strains
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.740]  and it came out really good.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.740]  And now we're also working on some stuff, you know.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:33.420]  But yeah, that's something that I grow personally a lot, to be honest.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.420]  Yeah.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:41.420]  So as far as varieties, I think in my opinion, Mephisto is one of the big game changers
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.420]  with autoflowers.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.420]  But the further we've gone away from those original root arousal varieties, the better
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.420]  it's gotten.
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.420]  And now incorporating some of the modern day genetics and some of these hybrids,
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.420]  it just keeps getting better and better.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.100]  What varieties are you growing over there in Barcelona or over in Spain?
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100]  Well, in Spain, there's a bit of everything.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.100]  People now really want some of the American hype, you know,
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.100]  so all the gassiness, all the cushiness.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.100]  But really, there's a demand for everything.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.100]  We often have some good Hawaiian snow, you know, for example.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.100]  So like real sativas that a lot of people don't want to do because it's too long to flower or whatever.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.100]  And yeah, there's definitely people enjoy it.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.100]  They appreciate it.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.780]  It's a pity that they don't do it more.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.780]  But what you would see the most here, but it's more for a commercial reason,
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.780]  I guess would be Amnesia.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780]  That's the king of Spain, I would say.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.780]  But now it's going to be super lemon, white widow, super critical.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.780]  You know, it's all those super Spanish classic.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.780]  And yeah, and then you have all the rest of the gelato.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780]  It's all here.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.780]  You have skittles, gelatos, watermelon skittles, docidos.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.780]  Everything's here.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]  A lot of people are doing selections.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.460]  You know, they invest a lot on seeds now.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.460]  People are buying a lot of packs and some really good stuff are popping out.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:02.460]  Really interesting.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:11.460]  So when I first came to Barcelona Dust years ago, I noticed it was the hash sales were predominant still.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.460]  They had a little bit of flower and a lot of hash.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.460]  But your flower sales have gone up tremendously, I would assume.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.460]  No, it's always the same.
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:28.140]  I don't know if I will confirm for Amsterdam, but for France, I've always seen the same tendency also.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.140]  And I see it in Spain.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:39.140]  I don't know if it's a European standard, you know, but there's always been a really big hash consumption base everywhere I've been in Europe.
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:46.140]  Most people, because weed was so hard to find, you know, and it's still kind of hard to find.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]  It's still illegal to grow, you know, in Spain, for example.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140]  So people cannot grow.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.140]  So easily.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.140]  No, it's still 50-50, I think.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.140]  I think it's a good 50-50.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.140]  If I had to.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.140]  The flower quality has gotten a lot better.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.140]  Yeah, flower quality was already good in Spain.
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.140]  It's just that the clones were not so good, you know.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.140]  But the growers here, if you give them a good genetic, they are really good.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:17.140]  You have some really dedicated people that have been saving, you know, clones for 15, 20 years that love their classic.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.820]  And they're going to do the strain perfectly, you know, and the trim it perfectly.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.820]  Yeah, you have really, really good quality here, for sure.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.820]  And now with all this American hype, of course, you know, it's getting more attention from the public.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.820]  So, yeah, a lot of people are starting to grow themselves also.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:40.820]  Nice. So what's the most popular strain in Spain right now?
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.820]  If you were to guess, what would your opinion be on what the most popular variety is?
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.600]  Well, Skittles was here for a while.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.600]  It's still around in the corners.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  Yeah, anything that has a little bit of Skittles in it or maybe some Tropicana cookies.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600]  Lately, it's pretty, it's going pretty strong also.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.600]  And because we had big gelato hype at some point, you know, like everybody was about the gelato, the sunset and everything.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]  That's kind of done.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.600]  And now I think Skittles has been the one that survived, kind of.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:23.280]  You know, everything that's crossed with the Z, it's always something that's going to work.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280]  The only problem is it's not easy to grow.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]  So not many people do it.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]  Yeah, Skittles is a tough one.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280]  It has terrible structure.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.280]  The turf profile is great, but the structure is so bad, it really needs to be bred into other stuff.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.280]  And that kind of goes along the line with all these newer seed companies trying to improve genetics.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.280]  I think that's a great thing.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  Yeah. But in the end, you know, anything that is OG, if you get that gassiness and that,
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280]  earthiness, people are happy.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280]  Yeah.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]  Yeah. It's still the good old classic that wins.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280]  Whatever turf, you know, because I think you guys still smoke with a lot of tobacco.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.280]  Not for the weed, for the hash, yeah.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.280]  But most of people, mainly people, when they smoke with tobacco, it's going to be for economical reason, you know,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.280]  because there's not enough weed or because it's so hard to find.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.280]  You know, it's not because they prefer smoking tobacco with the weed.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]  Except it's a hash joint.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.960]  Then it's the only way.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.960]  But no, for the weed reason, I would say it's mainly economical, you know.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:28.960]  Because, yeah, I mean, in France, when I was buying weed at the time, you know, for, let's say, one, two grams,
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.960]  it was going to be like 20, 25 bucks, you know.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.960]  So if you make one joint with that, that's not really sustainable.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.960]  So you make two, three out of it with a little bit of tobacco and then everything lasts longer.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.640]  But since I had easier access to weed, I always try to smoke the weed pure.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.640]  Unless I'm with somebody that doesn't.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.640]  Speaking of smoking, Arien, I saw you had a joint earlier.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640]  What are you smoking on?
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  Smoking Super Lemon.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.640]  Super Lemon, yeah.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640]  Yeah, what I got from a friend by coincidence, actually.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640]  Nice. Still a staple in Amsterdam.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320]  We see it here.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.320]  The Super Lemon haze is here. People get seeds and I've seen different phenotypes of it.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.320]  But yeah, we still see a lot of Super Lemon popping up occasionally here.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.320]  I was just down in San Diego last week and I saw some White Rhino.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.320]  I just wanted to hear a variety.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]  I was like, White Rhino? You got to be kidding me.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  But yeah, it's only gotten, I think, seed packs years ago.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320]  And it wasn't the clone only that was passed around.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  But it was definitely White Rhino that he had got from a seed pack maybe 20 years ago or something like that, I believe.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Nice.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  Yeah, it's funny. It's funny the legacy of White Rhino.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  It's interesting because one of my friends, who I didn't know him at the time,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  but he was such a fan of greenhouse seeds, he started a collective called the White Rhino Collective
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  because that was the first strain he'd grown.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  So yeah, it's funny how these strains evolve into other things.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680]  I was in one of my first also.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  I had Great White Shark and I think second run I had White Rhino.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]  And it's still really good.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.680]  I mean, we have a clone and every time I see a flower and you smell it,
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680]  it's still got that really nice creaminess touch.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.680]  It's really good.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.680]  James, do you see that question?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.680]  Yeah. Super Lemon x Amnesia.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.680]  That's right. Jaffata is one of the Ganja Farmer Seed Company varieties,
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]  which is kind of the best.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.360]  So Super Lemon Haze and Amnesia, I believe, are sister plants.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  They're very similar.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]  Yeah, they both come out of the Super Silver line.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.360]  Right. And Super Silver was one of your staples from years ago.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360]  That's been fed into some of the biggest things.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:50.360]  Yeah. That's a very, very old one that came through the lines of the famous Haze Brothers
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.360]  and then went through Neville and then I winded with me when I was partnering with him in...
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]  When was this? 95?
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.040]  Yeah. 95 or something.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.040]  Yeah. We got Super Silver Haze in San Francisco in the Bay Area in 97.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.040]  Yeah. 96.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.040]  Yeah.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.040]  Thank you.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:20.040]  So that strain that we had that was going around, it wasn't like your typical Haze.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:25.040]  People know Haze. It was pungent, but it wasn't high terpeneal limonene.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.720]  It had a very muskiness to it.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.720]  Same thing with the White Widow that we had back then.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.720]  It was super, super strong.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.720]  Strong knock you out, you smoke a joint of it, but the terpene profile was super, super strong as well
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.720]  and not your typical Haze.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.720]  I feel like that's been lost somewhere along the line.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.720]  I know Short Brooks and some other people have been chasing that,
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  trying to recreate or find the original.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.720]  The original Super Haze?
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  I met two guys on the Emerald Cup two years ago and three years ago
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.400]  and they had bought with me the perfect Super Silver Haze.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400]  It is around.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.400]  Well, then White Widow is another one.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400]  I haven't seen the same White Widow that we had.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400]  There's the White Widow that you guys had in Europe
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  and then somebody had a White Widow that they were growing here that was very unique and different.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.080]  There's a handful of varieties and those are both varieties I've been looking for for a while.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.080]  Yeah.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.080]  Let's talk about breeding back in the 90s.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080]  I feel like Europe kind of bottlenecked into that Haze
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.080]  where everybody really got excited about Haze
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.080]  and it changed the genetic gene pool from the 80s into Haze.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.080]  That lasted for what, 15 years maybe?
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.080]  Well, it wasn't mixed, no.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.760]  We were kind of the only ones doing that, you know,
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:56.760]  Neville's Haze and Super Silver Haze and Hawaiian Snow and Orange Haze 1
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  and Orange Ultra Haze and then later and then there are from there on
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.760]  Amnesia came which was a little shorter, quicker plant,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.760]  good phenotype of the original one.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.760]  They find a short flower in one.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.760]  And that was all between 96 and yeah,
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.760]  early 2000s.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.760]  You know, and still of course, it's going.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760]  Yeah.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.760]  Yeah, but before that there, I feel like there was a lot of diversity in the genetics
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.760]  and there was a period in the 90s, in the mid 90s where it kind of bottlenecked
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.760]  kind of like what happened with Cook from Cookies in 2012 to now
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.760]  where it was like Cookies, Sherbert, Gelato.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.760]  It really reminds me of Europe in the 90s.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.760]  Right now, what's going on in California, especially in the United States
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.440]  where everything's got to be Gelato, it's got to be color.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.440]  And there was kind of a time where I, as I saw it from California anyway,
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440]  where it kind of got bottlenecked.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.440]  The European genetics that we were getting, you know,
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440]  everything from power plant to all these things,
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.440]  they lean towards one thing kind of as Gelato, you know.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  And you guys, are you guys working with any of the,
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.440]  I know I saw some wedding cake crosses that you're doing.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.440]  You guys working with Gelato and any of the Cookie lineage?
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.440]  Not the direct Cookie stuff, but we did a lot of selection.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.440]  Yeah, we did a huge selection of like 200 strains a few years ago.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  So we just put out thousands and thousands and seeds.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.440]  We did a huge pheno hunt, you know, and we really tried to find stuff.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440]  We were not looking for original parents, you know,
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  not looking for something that resembled the plant,
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.440]  just looking for something brand new to make more stuff, you know, from this.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.440]  Try to find new terpene profiles and just breed it with our stuff.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.440]  And see what comes out and from that stuff breed more, you know.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440]  We've just been doing thousands and thousands of crosses.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.440]  And it's really exciting, you know, to be able to do this.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.440]  And I appreciate the Gelato for sure.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440]  It's a really good strain.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]  It's just not the most stable in my opinion for breeding.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.440]  Sometimes it's hard to find a really stable phenotype.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.440]  But yeah, it's nice. It's really good.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440]  I'm more sure, but if I have to choose between Gelato and Sunset.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  I would agree.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120]  I feel like Sherbert didn't get its heyday.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.120]  You know, there was Cookies and then there was Sherbert for a short period of time.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.120]  And if it wasn't for the Sherbert, there would be no Gelato.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.120]  But Sherbert, I got Sherbert around this room somewhere.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.120]  There's some nugs of it that I smoke on.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.120]  Yeah, it's interesting how we go towards stuff.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.120]  And then, you know, Runtz is the popular thing now.
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.120]  But yeah, there's a lot of issues with stability
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.800]  in the sense of intersexual traits with everything that stems from that Cookie line.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.800]  You know, because Cookies was very, you know, it reverses really easily,
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800]  which is great for making seeds and for making crosses.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]  If you're trying to get the clone only.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.800]  But the problem is, is, you know, stability in the sense of intersexual traits.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.800]  But, you know, all those things can be worked out.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]  No, it's just a matter of stabilizing.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.800]  But you can clearly see that I'm not saying one is better than another.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.480]  But the American market is a bit more focused on having more new stuff more rapidly,
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.480]  but with less work, because like you're saying, a lot of people are growing from clones.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.480]  You know, here it's so easy to buy your clone from a dispensary or whatever.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.480]  So you don't have that problem of putting 20 seeds and 10 of your seeds are Hermes.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.480]  But here in Europe, you know, if the people are doing this really illegally, like we're saying.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.480]  So when you put 20 seeds in your room, you know, and you're expecting to have something,
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.160]  you cannot afford to have half of it that has a problem because it's a genetic trait.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.160]  You know, so it needs a little bit more work and a little bit more time.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.160]  But yeah, it can definitely be done.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  Yeah, I feel like in the 90s and early 2000s, when you'd buy a seed pack from Europe,
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:03.160]  10% if you had 10% that, you know, one out of 10 that had a hermaphrodite issue, it was no big deal.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.160]  And now we've really gone to really stable varieties.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.840]  And people have worked these lines, figure out what works, what doesn't work.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.840]  And also testing their stuff.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840]  You know, I feel like the stability issues have completely gone away.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.840]  I think it's a demand from the customer also, you know, because the companies are in contact a lot.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.840]  We have a lot of cannabis fairs in Europe, you know, so we are lucky that you can see the customer everywhere in their countries.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840]  You know, you get to talk with them.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840]  And we had the forum that was giving a lot of feedback, you know.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.520]  So internet is very important for all this aspect, you know, even for the testing and all this.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:46.520]  That's really the good side of internet that you can get feedback from thousands of person almost instantly, you know, before it was much harder.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:54.520]  Oh, yeah. It's like there's so much, you know, the feedback and well, and the amount of misinformation too.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.520]  There's just as much misinformation now these days with the accessibility of the internet.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.520]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  So how's Yoa doing?
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.520]  He was good. He's moving from houses today.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.520]  Oh, nice.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.520]  So he's still managing over in the Netherlands, over in Amsterdam.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.520]  Yeah. Yeah, still there.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.520]  Nice. And how many coffee shops do you guys have over there still?
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.520]  I know that that's changed a little bit too with the, you used to do five.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.520]  But they went from over a thousand to what, 250 or something like that total.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:30.520]  What went from over a thousand?
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.520]  Over a thousand coffee shops.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200]  You mean for the country or for Amsterdam?
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]  For Amsterdam.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.200]  No, we went from like 400 to 166.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200]  Oh, wow.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:48.200]  That's still a significant drop. And then the red light district is shrunk down too now, correct?
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.200]  Yeah. And they want to shrink it down more. And now they also want to throw out the tourists from the coffee shops.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.200]  Yeah, that's so crazy.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200]  That's a crazy idea.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]  I can't even imagine.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]  No, let's see.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.880]  It happened in four other councils in Holland.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  And then one, two, three years later, it all turned it back because of the disaster on the streets, you know.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.880]  And other issues. I'm not really aware of what, but they turned it back.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:26.540]  Wow. So we got some questions from the audience. If you guys want to throw some questions out at us, we'd love to answer some questions.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.540]  I'm sure you guys got some good stuff for Arjan and Dust.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:36.220]  What kind of questions? You want some fastball in American baseball? You want some high heat inside?
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.220]  Or do you want some...
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.220]  We want some good questions. I'm sure I've been seeing them pop up on our feed here.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.220]  So one of them was, can you clarify your thoughts on American genetics and breeders?
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:58.220]  Because it seemed like you, I guess from the chat, the chat took away that you have a low opinion of American breeders.
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:02.900]  It's just a different approach from the European, you know.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.900]  Because European is more focused on the seed market, I think, when they're breeding a strain.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:14.900]  And America is more focused on clone production, you know, because you can produce the flower and you have access to the flower so easily, you know.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:23.900]  So it's not the same. If you remember serious seeds, you know, for example, they were really famous for the strains because it was super stable.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:29.580]  Like you would put 50 seeds out of it and the 50 plants were exactly the same.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.580]  But he was taking like 7-8 years of breeding, you know, to take one strain out.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:41.580]  And of course, at some point people started complaining because they didn't put out enough strains, you know, for the demand of the public.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:43.580]  They wanted to see more new stuff.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:53.580]  And that's where you have this limit of where is the point where you put out a work that you know is tasty, you know, and has a super amazing profile.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.580]  But that is really unstable. Then it's a choice, you know.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:02.580]  I don't know. For me, I try to make something as stable as you can.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.580]  I don't want to have like a Maphrodite 3 absolutely.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.580]  It's not in my head like something crazy, you know.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.580]  But I'm trying to make it as stable as possible so that people don't have problems with it, you know.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:16.580]  But I think the American strains are great, you know.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.580]  They're super vigorous. They have terpene profiles that you could not find in Europe really easily.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.260]  And yeah, it's great genetic material for breeding for sure.
[01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:35.490]  Yeah. And I think in America, we got a lot of amateur breeders, people that are breeding in their closets, selling seeds that aren't tested.
[01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:39.490]  You know, there's so much going on with stuff.
[01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:44.490]  And I feel like in Europe also, there's a handful of seed companies that do it themselves.
[01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:48.490]  And then there's other people that buy from the, you know, seed companies.
[01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:54.490]  There's companies that produce just to sell to other seed companies that pop up overnight that want to sell their seed.
[01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:59.490]  And then there's seeds in souvenir shops all over, you know, that aren't even real companies.
[01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:03.490]  But you see a lot of small breeders pop up also here.
[01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:07.490]  You know, that's the nice part with all this American culture that is coming to Europe.
[01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:15.490]  Is that a lot of people, like I was saying before, are buying those, I think it's like 500 packs, $500 packs, you know.
[01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:18.490]  Which when I was starting growing, it was crazy prices.
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:22.490]  Never I would have thought that you could see cannabis seeds at this price, you know.
[01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:26.170]  They invest real money in it and they make real crosses, you know.
[01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:28.170]  And they don't plan on becoming big or whatever.
[01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:30.170]  They're just doing their small breeding project.
[01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.170]  They sell a few thousand seeds.
[01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:34.170]  They're happy.
[01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:36.170]  And I think that's really nice.
[01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:38.170]  That's the whole thing about cannabis.
[01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:40.170]  You know, you don't have to be big or what.
[01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.170]  Just love the plants.
[01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:44.170]  Then you can do whatever you want.
[01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:48.170]  Yeah, I think people are, we get all these people that are like, oh man, that's crazy.
[01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:50.170]  $500 a pack.
[01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:51.850]  $100 for a 10 pack of seeds is a little crazy.
[01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:56.850]  But at the end of the day, seeds are worth whatever people will pay for them.
[01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:02.850]  So, you know, whether it's $100 a pack, $200, it's worth whatever people will pay for them.
[01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:05.850]  If they're not worth it, people won't pay it.
[01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:08.850]  So, you know, that's up to the consumer at the end of the day.
[01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:11.850]  Look, they're selling Pokemon Caps for $200k now.
[01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:13.850]  So, what can I say?
[01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:17.850]  Some things are going crazy.
[01:26:18.850 --> 01:26:19.850]  Yeah, $200,000.
[01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:21.850]  For a Pokemon Cap.
[01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:23.850]  It's good.
[01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:25.850]  Oh, yeah, it's nuts.
[01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:27.850]  That's just nuts.
[01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:29.850]  But then it's like, what is that worth?
[01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:34.850]  If somebody pays that much money, are they able to translate it into more than what that's worth?
[01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:36.850]  I don't know.
[01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:38.850]  It's worth what you pay for it.
[01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:42.850]  So, we've had some interesting talk about cat piss.
[01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:44.850]  I don't know if you guys ever remember.
[01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:46.850]  In Europe, there was cat piss haze.
[01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:52.530]  I think I'd smoked some A5, actually, at a strain hunters club in maybe 2010.
[01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:57.530]  And it's the closest I've come to the real cat piss that we had in the Bay Area in the last 20 years.
[01:26:58.530 --> 01:26:59.530]  But it's been a big topic on my show, is the cat piss.
[01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:03.530]  Do you guys have any stories about the cat piss haze or cat piss genetics?
[01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:07.530]  Well, that's how they used to call the weed in the early 90s.
[01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:09.530]  Dutch people were smoking hash.
[01:27:10.530 --> 01:27:11.530]  They all said it smells like cat piss.
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:13.530]  That's why we don't smoke it.
[01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.210]  That was a Dutch thing here.
[01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.210]  That's what we already, when we liked, we really liked whatever.
[01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:21.210]  Even skunk, they called cat piss.
[01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:23.210]  They called everything cat piss.
[01:27:24.210 --> 01:27:27.210]  That's where the name in Amsterdam originated from, you know.
[01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:31.210]  But it was the hashish smokers who called weed cat piss.
[01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:33.210]  Yeah, it's so funny.
[01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:35.210]  There's a clone in Spain also.
[01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:39.210]  I think it was a Super Lemon selection when we opened in the beginning.
[01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:41.210]  A lot of people used to do it.
[01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:43.890]  It was clearly like smelling like cat piss.
[01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:47.890]  And most of the people that described it when they were smelling it
[01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:49.890]  would describe it as cat piss also.
[01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:53.890]  Yeah, the A5 has some real pissiness to it.
[01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:56.890]  That real ammonia, strong on the ammonia.
[01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:00.890]  And it's funny because there's this big argument in the Bay Area,
[01:28:01.890 --> 01:28:03.890]  not even the Bay Area, but just in the United States about cat piss,
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:05.890]  where it came from, who originated it.
[01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:08.890]  And we got 10 people claiming that they created the cat piss.
[01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:11.570]  And while I do believe they created a cat piss,
[01:28:12.570 --> 01:28:14.570]  I don't believe they created the cat piss.
[01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:16.570]  There's the San Diego cat piss.
[01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:19.570]  We're going to credit Tom to the San Diego cat piss.
[01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:23.570]  But it's so funny because it's a terpene profile.
[01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:26.570]  And there's been this huge piss off on my show
[01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:30.570]  where people are arguing about the cat piss and the origination,
[01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.570]  where it came from.
[01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:36.570]  Then we see people saying it's gross that nobody wants to smoke cat piss.
[01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:38.250]  It's definitely acquired taste.
[01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:41.250]  Yeah, every time I smell it, it's definitely accurate.
[01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:45.250]  I get a cat piss comment at least every single show since that show.
[01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:49.250]  Not even a James Loud show, just in the chat.
[01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.250]  But they did the cheetah piss, no?
[01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:55.250]  Also, I think I saw recently.
[01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.250]  Cheetah piss.
[01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.250]  Yeah, so cheetah piss, they say it's related to the cat piss,
[01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:02.250]  but it has a little ammonia.
[01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:05.250]  And I could agree, but I don't think it's the same.
[01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:10.930]  The Bay Area cat piss was the skunkiest and pissiest smelling weed.
[01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.930]  It had ammonia with skunk, and one little tenth of a gram
[01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:17.930]  would smell your whole house up.
[01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:19.930]  Like a little piece on your shirt walking in.
[01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.930]  And I was in high school at the time.
[01:29:22.930 --> 01:29:25.930]  My parents would think I was crazy because it would be real stinky.
[01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:32.930]  It's interesting, these stories and these varieties.
[01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:36.610]  Yeah, here I would rate it more to haze and smells.
[01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:39.610]  Every time I had this feeling of cat piss,
[01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:42.610]  because I was not familiar with the strain itself.
[01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:46.610]  But every time I had that feeling, it was with some kind of haze crosses.
[01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:48.610]  Yeah.
[01:29:49.610 --> 01:29:50.610]  Who knows?
[01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:53.610]  So Husky asked,
[01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:59.610]  what is Aria or both your favorite smoke from your own library
[01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:02.610]  and one that you would recommend to your friends?
[01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:04.610]  And one pick from another breeder.
[01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.610]  For me, it's Exodus Cheese.
[01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:09.610]  Easy.
[01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:11.610]  For me, it's Hawaiian Snow.
[01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:15.610]  Maybe I'll make a Hawaiian Exodus then.
[01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.610]  Isn't that in the pipeline?
[01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.610]  No, Exodus with some other stuff, yeah.
[01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:23.610]  I'm working on some stuff.
[01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:26.610]  If I have to pick one from another breeder, I would say Cali Mist.
[01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:28.610]  Yeah, that's nice.
[01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:31.610]  And from another breeder.
[01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:34.290]  Yeah, Simon, he didn't put out a lot.
[01:30:35.290 --> 01:30:39.290]  He only put out a handful of genetics and they were all stable, true F1s.
[01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:41.290]  I mean, it's rare.
[01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:44.290]  You guys might know other true F1 breeders,
[01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:48.290]  but he's the only one that I know that is a real true F1 breeder
[01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:53.290]  that bred from land-raised varieties and created stable F1s.
[01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:55.290]  Yeah.
[01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:57.290]  Come again?
[01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:00.290]  So Simon, what he did is he took two land-raised varieties
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:02.970]  stable lines and created F1s
[01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:05.970]  and then took those F1s and created F1 hybrids
[01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:08.970]  creating like Cali Mist AK47.
[01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:11.970]  You know, you don't see that kind of breeding going on these days
[01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:14.970]  because those projects take years and years to perfect.
[01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:17.970]  Yeah, I think the Serious 6 was like six years, literally.
[01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:19.970]  Yeah.
[01:31:21.970 --> 01:31:23.970]  Now for the Overseed Bank, I would say Shoreline.
[01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:27.970]  Shoreline has been one of my favorite smokes from an Overseed Bank.
[01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:31.650]  So it's pretty funny because Shoreline, it's interesting
[01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.650]  because there's a Texas Shoreline, which is where it originally came from
[01:31:36.650 --> 01:31:37.650]  and I believe it's crossed.
[01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:41.650]  So the one that pops up in Amsterdam is like the Shoreline
[01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:44.650]  that's crossed with either the purple Urkel or lavender,
[01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:46.650]  maybe some is lavender or something like that.
[01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:48.650]  It does have a lavender touch, definitely.
[01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:50.650]  Yeah, and the one here is just straight skunk.
[01:31:51.650 --> 01:31:53.650]  It's as close to roadkill skunk as I believe you can get.
[01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:57.650]  You know, it's an interesting smoke, but kind of like a
[01:31:58.650 --> 01:32:02.650]  completely different from, if you say Shoreline in California or Texas
[01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:06.650]  and you say Shoreline in Amsterdam, it's two completely different varieties almost.
[01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:10.650]  Yeah, I guess the same would happen with the White Widow, no?
[01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:14.650]  Because we have been trying White Widow for so many years since the beginnings.
[01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:19.650]  It was one of the only weed that would come to France from Amsterdam since it started.
[01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:23.650]  And yeah, I guess we have different standards for some stuff, you know,
[01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:25.650]  but that's the good thing also about the weed.
[01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:27.330]  There's so many difference.
[01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:29.330]  Yeah.
[01:32:30.330 --> 01:32:33.330]  Yeah, it's funny because I think of White Widow as an example of something
[01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:37.330]  that people think of as vanilla, you know, and like you breed it with stuff
[01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:40.330]  and it makes strange vanilla, but like the real White Widow was not vanilla.
[01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:43.330]  The real White Widow was strong, amazing smoke.
[01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:45.330]  Yeah, I never had really vanilla.
[01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:49.330]  You could say it's floral, you know, and fruit in some cases,
[01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:52.330]  but I never really found a vanilla taste in it.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.010]  Well, and I think what happens when you breed White Widow,
[01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:59.010]  because I think a lot of people used it as a pollinator for making seeds
[01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:03.010]  because it's so stable that it would take some genetics like OG Kush
[01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:06.010]  and it would get lost in the seeds.
[01:33:08.010 --> 01:33:10.010]  Yeah, it was a bit dominant.
[01:33:11.010 --> 01:33:13.010]  A lot of seed banks have been doing this for a while
[01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:15.010]  and they probably keep doing it.
[01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:17.010]  I don't know.
[01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.010]  But the problem is it's kind of neutral.
[01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:22.010]  Let's say when you breed it from a seed bank,
[01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:25.010]  it's not good in my opinion, you know, because the plant itself is really good,
[01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:29.010]  but what the pollen gives is just a good structure and a good resin production,
[01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:32.010]  but it doesn't really add a profile on the terpenes, you know,
[01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:35.010]  and it kind of brings everything down.
[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:40.010]  So like if your plant is super tasty, you know, it just puts it on the average.
[01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:44.010]  And I've never been a really big fan of using the White Widow as a male.
[01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:48.010]  Like it's good in some cases, you know, but I wouldn't do it for all the plants.
[01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:50.010]  Definitely not.
[01:33:50.690 --> 01:33:57.690]  And then someone asked kind of more newer lines that have come onto the scene.
[01:33:58.690 --> 01:34:03.690]  So things that you've seen recently in 2020, 2021.
[01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:05.690]  That we like?
[01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:08.690]  Well, the Cloud Walker that we did for you was a really good one, really.
[01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:12.690]  You know, the profile terpene that comes out of it is super sweet.
[01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.690]  It's like a candy and it's really, really nice when you have some grapey and earthy,
[01:34:18.370 --> 01:34:19.370]  you know, in it.
[01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:21.370]  I don't know how to describe it really.
[01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:24.370]  It's pretty strange, but it's really good and it's new and it's refreshing.
[01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:28.370]  You know, it's not like most of the time when I smoke something, I don't ask the name.
[01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:32.370]  You know, I just smoke it first and I smell it, you know, and look at the buds
[01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:36.370]  and you kind of know where you're going already, you know, without even asking a name.
[01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:42.370]  So yeah, anything that is a bit new, you know, like now we did also the King's Juice
[01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:46.370]  with this mimosa, you know, that is super terpy one, you know, the selection
[01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:51.050]  and with the King's Cush, it just brings some, it's crazy, really smells like orange juice, you know,
[01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:57.050]  like you're squeezing French orange juice and you're smelling it and it's a really nice one.
[01:34:58.050 --> 01:35:04.050]  Someone asked about King's Juice, actually a couple of people have asked that you guys elaborate on it.
[01:35:05.050 --> 01:35:09.050]  Yeah, that's a really nice one and it's a really good combination because the mimosa is really nice,
[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:11.050]  you know, but it's more floral.
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.050]  I don't know if it's the case for your mimosa in America, but the one that we select is a more floral one,
[01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:22.050]  you know, that's kind of creamy floral, really nice, but not so New York or diesel, you know,
[01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:28.050]  you don't have that really lemony, lemony touch and the King's Cush had that earthiness and the lemony
[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:34.050]  and both together it just came out like orange, you know, somehow and it's a really, really good mix.
[01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:36.050]  I'm really happy with this mix.
[01:35:38.050 --> 01:35:39.050]  Nice.
[01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:44.050]  So we got a question about Ariane and Berner.
[01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:45.730]  Are you guys working together?
[01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:50.730]  There was a video, I guess, on Instagram of you guys together at one point, maybe last year,
[01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:55.730]  that was floating around and so we get people interested in you and Berner.
[01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:58.730]  Yes, we are working together.
[01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:00.730]  Nice.
[01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:07.730]  Yeah, we know each other for a long time and we're doing a seed project for him
[01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:18.410]  and we started a new brand together with Damien Marley, which we're working on
[01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:26.410]  and we're looking now how we can start making flowers in the very near future
[01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:28.410]  to get on the shelves of the cookie stores, of course.
[01:36:29.410 --> 01:36:34.410]  And then, of course, we are very soon opening a, that rumor is probably also out,
[01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:39.090]  that we are opening a cookie lounge in Amsterdam in the main shop in the Haarlemstraat.
[01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:45.090]  So there's a lot of crossovers going between us and them.
[01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:48.090]  Nice.
[01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:51.090]  Looking forward to that, yeah.
[01:36:52.090 --> 01:36:54.090]  It's great to work with other people in the industry, you know.
[01:36:55.090 --> 01:36:56.090]  We do it a lot.
[01:36:58.090 --> 01:36:59.090]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:37:00.090 --> 01:37:04.090]  Well, yeah, I think people think the cannabis industry is so big and really it's small.
[01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:07.090]  It's very small, especially at the level that we're at
[01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:09.090]  and the people that have been in there for a while.
[01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.090]  Yeah.
[01:37:12.090 --> 01:37:13.090]  Everybody knows everybody.
[01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:15.090]  Yeah.
[01:37:16.090 --> 01:37:20.090]  Okay, so a while ago, Greg McAllister said,
[01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:25.090]  Production Matters asked Arjan what formula he makes has the highest,
[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.090]  or I guess that has the highest yield.
[01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:31.090]  What are your high yielding formulations or formulas?
[01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:33.770]  What, plant-wise or nutrients-wise?
[01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:39.770]  I assume he's talking about nutrients and Greg, you can clarify the question,
[01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:41.770]  but I think he's talking nutrients.
[01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:43.770]  There is a mix, you know.
[01:37:44.770 --> 01:37:46.770]  It depends how you grow, you know.
[01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:48.770]  Of course, the more light, the more yield.
[01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:50.770]  We all know this trick.
[01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:52.770]  It's pretty easy.
[01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:54.770]  In Holland, we have a rhyme.
[01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:56.770]  It says, Licht is Gewicht.
[01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:58.770]  That means basically light is weight.
[01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:04.450]  And then, yeah, look, a lot of people work on hydroponics,
[01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.450]  which you pump much more air to the roots,
[01:38:07.450 --> 01:38:09.450]  so you have probably a 15% more yield
[01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:14.450]  and a 50% quicker ratio on the turnover of your cycles.
[01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.450]  But then again, you don't have the taste of the soil.
[01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:22.450]  And, well, we use our own fertilizer, which we launched like seven years ago
[01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:24.450]  and now it's really getting booming.
[01:38:25.450 --> 01:38:27.450]  I think we are number one in most South American countries and Russia.
[01:38:28.130 --> 01:38:31.130]  In Europe, we're going also really, really well.
[01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:33.130]  And Canada, we use a lot.
[01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:35.130]  America is a more difficult market for us
[01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:38.130]  because there's really huge companies, you know,
[01:38:39.130 --> 01:38:41.130]  that we have to deal with on Shell Space.
[01:38:42.130 --> 01:38:45.130]  But we came up with the motto with the powder feeding
[01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:48.130]  and, yeah, the stuff is working amazing, you know.
[01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:54.130]  First of all, feeding doesn't have to be as complicated as everybody thinks it is, you know.
[01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:56.810]  And people should really look into that.
[01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:58.810]  People should try out.
[01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:00.810]  This is how we grew up when we were young.
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:03.810]  We always had pots and every pot we did something different, you know,
[01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:07.810]  same plant, same light and slowly evolve to what you do.
[01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:10.810]  Many big growers make their own stuff.
[01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:12.810]  And we technically did the same.
[01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:16.810]  We made it into a powder because we thought it was sustainable for the long run,
[01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:22.810]  where, you know, walking around with 25 liter or what is it,
[01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:27.490]  five, six gallon big tanks didn't make sense anymore at one point,
[01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:29.490]  especially when you are remote, you know.
[01:39:30.490 --> 01:39:36.490]  So, yeah, we grow with the powder feeding now and it's doing amazing.
[01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:38.490]  Well, you can see all our pictures.
[01:39:39.490 --> 01:39:41.490]  You can see a lot of people raving about it on the Internet.
[01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:46.490]  And slowly it's getting his market within the marijuana market.
[01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:49.490]  It took a while because people have to get used.
[01:39:50.170 --> 01:39:55.170]  We all know how difficult it is to change a grower from nutrients
[01:39:56.170 --> 01:40:01.170]  or from his plants, you know, to change genetics or from his medium.
[01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:03.170]  But slowly we're getting there.
[01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:07.170]  And now, yeah, now it's a whole new thing, you know, powder feeding.
[01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:09.170]  Check it out.
[01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:12.170]  Yeah, the concept is amazing.
[01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:15.170]  I mean, there's no reason to mix the powder with it.
[01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:18.170]  If you're making salts, mixing the salts with the liquid
[01:40:18.850 --> 01:40:20.850]  and shipping them with this huge carbon footprint.
[01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.850]  I mean, if you could just ship the powder and you have stabilizers,
[01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:26.850]  I think that's an amazing concept.
[01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:28.850]  Carbon footprints.
[01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:32.850]  Yeah, you know, and also, you know, for people with one tent,
[01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:35.850]  you know, a lot of illegal growth with like one light or two lights
[01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:39.850]  and a little bit of soil, you know, you put a little bit of powder through it
[01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:44.850]  in the buckets and you just give it and the shell space is really long.
[01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:46.850]  It's just super handy, you know.
[01:40:47.530 --> 01:40:50.530]  And I remember Larry telling me from General Hydroponics
[01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:55.530]  six, seven years ago, I say, that stuff will never work.
[01:40:56.530 --> 01:41:01.530]  I know what he's talking about, of course, you know, he's an old friend of mine.
[01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:04.530]  And then after two years, he saw it going, it's going around
[01:41:05.530 --> 01:41:06.530]  and everybody started using.
[01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:08.530]  I said, that's what you told me, it's not working.
[01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:10.530]  He said, yeah, I told it on purpose.
[01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:12.530]  I knew it was working, but it's going to cost us a lot of money.
[01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:14.530]  Yeah.
[01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:17.210]  Well, he has his own, I mean, he's not with, it's now Scott's,
[01:41:18.210 --> 01:41:19.210]  but Larry sold it, but yeah.
[01:41:20.210 --> 01:41:21.210]  I sold it, he left the company and sold everything.
[01:41:22.210 --> 01:41:25.210]  But now you see American companies also doing powders, huh?
[01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:29.210]  Yeah, GH, I mean, GH has a Flora Pro, which is a powder line.
[01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.210]  They all have a powder now.
[01:41:32.210 --> 01:41:34.210]  And when I started the whole thing, they all said I was crazy, you know.
[01:41:35.210 --> 01:41:36.210]  And now they all have powder.
[01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:39.210]  But my powder is by far the best powder of all of them.
[01:41:40.210 --> 01:41:41.210]  No residue in the tubes, nothing.
[01:41:42.210 --> 01:41:43.210]  And Dustin, I can guarantee that.
[01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:44.890]  Just try it.
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:46.890]  Yeah.
[01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:47.890]  And the organic is working really good also.
[01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:49.890]  And the organic is amazing.
[01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:51.890]  Nice.
[01:41:52.890 --> 01:41:53.890]  So yeah, you guys should really, really try it.
[01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:55.890]  It's good, you know, because it's an honest product, you know,
[01:41:56.890 --> 01:41:57.890]  we should emphasize that.
[01:41:58.890 --> 01:41:59.890]  And small time growers should just grow powder
[01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:01.890]  and not walk around with all these liquids and, you know,
[01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:03.890]  and pollute stuff.
[01:42:04.890 --> 01:42:05.890]  No, use a powder, you know, it's good.
[01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:09.890]  Yeah, I think the concept is great.
[01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:11.890]  I think especially for remote locations,
[01:42:12.570 --> 01:42:13.570]  there's no, you're not going to go to Antarctica
[01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:18.570]  if you want to grow cannabis and grow with stuff that has liquid in it.
[01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:20.570]  So Africa too.
[01:42:21.570 --> 01:42:23.570]  I mean, I think it just makes sense for a lot of places.
[01:42:24.570 --> 01:42:25.570]  Yeah.
[01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:28.570]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:30.570]  Look here, Greenhouse Powder Organic is the bomb.
[01:42:31.570 --> 01:42:32.570]  This guy's using it.
[01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:34.570]  And you see more and more people now.
[01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:36.570]  Yeah.
[01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:38.570]  And the good thing about it is everybody uses it.
[01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:40.570]  It's super happy to say, wow, I did it.
[01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.250]  Realize this, you know,
[01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:44.250]  especially production.
[01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:46.250]  It's just, it's just, it's just amazing.
[01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:48.250]  It's just a super good product.
[01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:50.250]  So I'm happy.
[01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:52.250]  One of the things we contributed to this planet is bringing powder
[01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:54.250]  into the marijuana industry.
[01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:56.250]  And yeah, we did that, you know,
[01:42:57.250 --> 01:42:58.250]  and now all the companies are following us.
[01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:00.250]  I'm proud of that.
[01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:02.250]  It's good for the environment.
[01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:04.250]  It's good that other companies pick it up and realize
[01:43:05.250 --> 01:43:06.250]  that we should not work with all these gallons of waters
[01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:08.250]  and, you know,
[01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:09.930]  mixing it like that and throwing away a lot,
[01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:11.930]  you know, and yeah.
[01:43:12.930 --> 01:43:13.930]  We contributed a little bit to a better world,
[01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:15.930]  we hope.
[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:17.930]  Yeah.
[01:43:18.930 --> 01:43:19.930]  Well, so when I,
[01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:21.930]  the time when I first met you and I'd won my first
[01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:23.930]  cannabis cup,
[01:43:24.930 --> 01:43:25.930]  you said something that's kind of stuck with me throughout
[01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:27.930]  this whole time.
[01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:29.930]  It's been almost 10 years now.
[01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:31.930]  And you said that the cup that I had,
[01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:33.930]  you said,
[01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:35.930]  it's just the beginning that this cup is worth a million dollars.
[01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:37.610]  Or it's worth nothing.
[01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:39.610]  If you,
[01:43:40.610 --> 01:43:41.610]  if you get up and you apply yourself,
[01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:43.610]  it can be worth a million.
[01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:45.610]  But if you don't, it's worth absolutely zero.
[01:43:46.610 --> 01:43:47.610]  Yeah.
[01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:49.610]  You know, so I get up every day and I think about that.
[01:43:50.610 --> 01:43:51.610]  Not every day thinking about that specifically,
[01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:53.610]  but getting up every day and grinding that this is just
[01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:55.610]  the beginning.
[01:43:56.610 --> 01:43:57.610]  It's part of the path that these awards are great things.
[01:43:58.610 --> 01:43:59.610]  But if you don't apply yourself, they mean nothing.
[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:01.610]  So what's your legacy?
[01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:03.610]  What's your,
[01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.610]  I mean, I think in your opinion,
[01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:07.610]  I guess you're leaving behind a great seed company.
[01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:09.610]  We're talking nutrients now.
[01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:11.610]  I think the way we do it,
[01:44:12.610 --> 01:44:13.610]  what's the plan for your future?
[01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:15.610]  The clubs, you see, really important.
[01:44:16.610 --> 01:44:17.610]  I would like to see the whole world like having coffee shops
[01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:19.610]  like in Amsterdam.
[01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:21.610]  So it's like,
[01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:23.610]  look, what is the fun part for all of us?
[01:44:24.610 --> 01:44:25.610]  Go to restaurant with friends and have a nice meal
[01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:27.610]  or go to bar, have a nice drink and watch some sports game
[01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:29.610]  or chat with friends and girls and whatever.
[01:44:30.610 --> 01:44:31.610]  And that has to happen in a coffee shop.
[01:44:32.610 --> 01:44:33.610]  And I think that's the way we do it.
[01:44:34.290 --> 01:44:35.290]  And that has to happen in a coffee shop with a joint.
[01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:37.290]  And that's one of my things.
[01:44:38.290 --> 01:44:39.290]  And I hope through,
[01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:41.290]  I hope through
[01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:43.290]  Wait till he comes back.
[01:44:44.290 --> 01:44:51.560]  And also the movies, you know,
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.560]  I hope I'm going to make another 10 with dust
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560]  and show what's really going on.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  I think that's what I can do.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.560]  And then, of course, leave behind great varieties,
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.560]  you know, and
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  and I think that's what I can do.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.560]  And then, of course, leave behind great varieties,
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  you know, and
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.240]  and contribute,
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:11.240]  contributed like 5% to the legalization process,
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.240]  which I did from the beginning.
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.240]  Now, the first 10 licenses are granted in Holland
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.240]  because myself and nine other people,
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.240]  we pushed it really hard for the last six years.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.240]  And then we created this transparent chain.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240]  And now the government implemented that.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.240]  And now there's 10 licenses in Holland.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.240]  So I'm proud of that.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.240]  We worked really hard for that.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.240]  And it's good.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.240]  Those things are going to be a part of my life.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.240]  And I hope that I can continue to do that.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920]  And it's good.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920]  Those things are happening.
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920]  Yeah.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:42.920]  With your children getting older,
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:44.920]  are they going to be involved in the industry?
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920]  I have no idea.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.920]  One of them is going to start working tomorrow morning
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920]  on the office.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920]  I'm looking at him sitting on the couch.
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.920]  He's 14.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.920]  And he's born on 420.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.920]  You maybe remember that crazy day.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.920]  Future stream hunters.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:02.920]  How is that possible?
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:04.920]  So
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.920]  Yeah.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:08.920]  So James, we actually have a question for you.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.920]  When you were talking about
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:12.920]  or let me just post it up.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:14.920]  So it's Mr. Toad.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.920]  What type of nano silver?
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:18.920]  Is it a bacteria based silver?
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920]  Just colloidal silver?
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.920]  It's not very.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:24.920]  Yes.
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920]  We're going to go over it on the show.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:28.920]  Eventually I have a recipe that is in my book,
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.920]  my breeding book that I will be sharing with everyone.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920]  And I'm going to be sharing it with you.
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.600]  So we'll be talking about that sometime in the near future.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  Got it.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  How many times you spray?
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.600]  In what?
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:42.600]  In what ratio?
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:44.600]  So it just depends.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.600]  Like so typically what you do is you take one milliliter.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.600]  It's in such a concentration.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:50.600]  So it's one milliliter to one gallon.
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.600]  And then you start spring one week before flower
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:54.600]  through one week after and you get a full reversal.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  So then with autos, I just depending on the auto,
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.600]  I just spray it.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.600]  And then I spray it.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]  So then with autos, I just depending on the auto,
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.280]  some of them I've started spraying as early as like three weeks
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280]  from germination and you spray every other day
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.280]  and you get really good results.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.280]  For the normal fan you spray the plants one week prior
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]  to going on 12.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280]  Exactly.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280]  And then you spray again on 12 and then one week later
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:18.280]  you spray three times or what?
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.280]  No, I spray every other day.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280]  Starting one week before through one week after.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.280]  So for 14 days.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]  14 days.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.280]  So you spray it every other day.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:29.960]  Yeah.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  Okay.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.960]  And when do you put then the plants on 12 hours
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.960]  that you're going to pollinate?
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960]  So it just depends on the variety.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960]  But typically.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:41.960]  The normal indica.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:43.960]  A week before.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  A week before.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.960]  So that's basically the same time then as you spray.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  Right.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:51.960]  But you spray still seven days on 18 hours.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:53.960]  So I spray seven days on 18 hours and then seven days on 12.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  And then I spray the plants on 12.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:57.640]  Interesting.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640]  Correct.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.640]  And then like if you're making one variety I might start the
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.640]  donors a little before I start the receivers.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.640]  Yeah.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.640]  And you say you have much more pollen than on the old
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.640]  fashioned way.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.640]  I think you get a lot more pollen.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:13.640]  And the other thing that I've noticed and this is something
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:15.640]  that is real interesting because everybody's switching over to
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.640]  LED lighting.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.640]  That actually my partner did a side by side recently and he's
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640]  getting with HPS which is a high-power LED lighting.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.640]  And he's getting a lot more pollen.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  And he's getting a lot more pollen.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]  And I'm sure it has something to do with the spectrum.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640]  But significantly more pollen with HPS than you do with LED.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.640]  Interesting.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.640]  So yeah.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640]  And then the silver that we're using doesn't really work well
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  out in the field.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:39.640]  We're getting a lot better results with it doing it
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.640]  indoors or in a greenhouse environment.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640]  Yeah.
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.640]  Because it blows away.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.640]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.640]  Yeah.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.640]  That's why I need big fields.
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:53.640]  Yeah.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.320]  And then you know your donor and receiver ratios you got to use
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.320]  a lot more donors.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.320]  We need outdoors.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.320]  You know I mean we've done two to one.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  Whereas like indoors is like you know one to six or one to
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]  nine even.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  And having good successful rates.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.320]  Yeah.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.320]  There's a lot of new techniques for pollinating.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.320]  And so how often does it still your pollen don't grab the
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  pollen?
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:19.320]  Yeah.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.320]  So I think it's a good question.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  How often does it still your pollen don't grab.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Don't grab like it's the plant the other day the other side
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  is not working.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  How often does that happen to you?
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  Not a lot.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  But you know sometimes if I'm doing like I'll be doing.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  So there's a couple of different things I do.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  I do seed raises where I'm doing one donor and one receiver
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  or a couple of receivers.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  And then there's times where I'm just trying to make new
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  genetics which is one of the projects I'm doing now where I
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  have one donor and I have like 30 or 40 different receivers.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  And then I'm just trying to make new genetics which is one of
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  the projects I'm doing now where I have one donor and I have
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  like 30 or 40 different receivers.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  And I'm not doing that to sell seeds.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  I'm doing that to create new varieties.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Yes.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  So for 30 how much will not get seeds?
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  Maybe one in 30 two in 30 just depending on the varieties.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  And you know a lot of this stuff is so with all these new
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  varieties there's just all these complex polyhybrids that are
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  very similar to each other.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  And a lot of the new stuff kind of works together.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  But it just depends.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  And then I'm finding that stuff like wedding cake works better
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  as a recipient.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Receiver than as a donor.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  So there's a lot of varieties that they're good varieties but
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  they're not going to work well as a donor.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  They're going to work well as a receiver.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  We encountered the same issues one on 30 one on 15.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  It's funny.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  Comes all with nature.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  And how much and how much males will there be in 100 seeds
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  roughly.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  With feminists.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Yeah.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  It's funny because it's interesting that you brought that
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  up.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  But typically we don't get any males in 100.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  But like if you look in a thousand to five thousand
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  depending on the variety you might find one in a thousand or
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  one in five thousand.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  But the pink panties my buddy from root down genetics he he
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  made a cross with the pink panties that I gave him that I
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  got through some friends.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  That was the real deal pink panties cut.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  And he made feminized seeds by hand.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:21.680]  And he made feminized seeds by reversing the pink panties and
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.680]  put it on another female variety.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.680]  So it was a fem line donor receiver.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.680]  And he got five males and five females out of the first
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.680]  10 seeds he popped with a feminized line.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.680]  I've never seen that before in my life.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.680]  But anything is possible.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:37.680]  That's crazy.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.680]  That's crazy.
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.680]  Now I want to just it just gives you also the how strong
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680]  nature is against us.
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680]  You know.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680]  Yeah.
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680]  We see it on we see it on many occasions because we
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:51.680]  put out 10 20 thousand seeds and we see depends on the
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:55.680]  variety one on 300 to one on thousand whatever you know
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:57.680]  depends a little bit on the variety.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.680]  And there's always one plant standing out there like really
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.680]  strong you know being being a full male of all the seeds
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:06.680]  are femme.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:10.680]  Those you know how strong nature is that you never can like
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.680]  you know rule it out probably only if you do GM then yes.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680]  But this is all natural made basically you know.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680]  Yeah.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.360]  I think the new thing is I mean it's not the new new thing
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.360]  but triploids is you know come to light recently again.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.360]  And it's something that I know the Dutch guys did 15 20 years
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.360]  ago and kind of abandoned but triploids for large scale seed
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.360]  production is a very viable and interesting option especially
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.360]  in places like Colorado where they need pollen mitigation
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.360]  because there's so much pollen it's so dry that there's pollen
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:44.360]  flying in and contaminating everyone's cannabis or cannabis
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  and hemp.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  And so triploids where they basically breed so it doesn't
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:53.040]  accept pollen just like a seedless watermelon.
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.040]  You know I think there's a huge potential for that.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  And yeah I think I think there's some future in that.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.040]  Oregon CBD is already nailed it for him where they think
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:06.040]  there was a T.H.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.040]  strain also like this I heard it a few years ago.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.040]  Yeah.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  Yeah I know short worked on some stuff.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.040]  Me and him talked about it years ago.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:16.720]  You know I think he was in Cambodia and he was working on
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.720]  some stuff like that and this was over 15 years ago.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.720]  So but they they abandoned it.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:25.720]  A whole new discussion if that's ethical to do.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.720]  Right.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.720]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.720]  Everyone's going to say no in the beginning and then it's
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.180]  going to be fine.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.180]  So we'll see.
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:38.180]  So yeah.
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:39.180]  Wave of the future.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.180]  So let's see.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.180]  What do you guys how do you guys see the future in 10 years
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:45.860]  from now for you guys.
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:47.860]  What's what's your future.
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:49.860]  How do you envision the future of greenhouse and strain
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:51.860]  hunters and everything else.
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:53.860]  No.
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.860]  We hope you'll still be around and doing great.
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.860]  But it's a crazy world out there.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:53:59.860]  No.
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:00.860]  Yeah.
[01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:02.860]  We have to see how this all goes.
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:04.860]  And in Europe we're not as far as advanced as you guys in
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:06.860]  Canada and America.
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:10.860]  You know it's all we're still very much under the radar
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.860]  and fighting systems.
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:14.540]  And arguing with politicians.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.540]  And you know so it's difficult.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:19.540]  Yeah.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:20.540]  I hope that changes.
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:22.540]  I mean I I feel like it's going to change eventually.
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:24.540]  It has to change.
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:26.540]  You know we have this we have this momentum building
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:28.540]  especially with the United States.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.540]  Once it goes recreational across the border of the United
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:32.540]  States I think Europe will soon follow.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.540]  Spain is definitely going to follow suit.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:36.540]  I mean the tax money hopefully I would assume that Spain
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:38.540]  would follow through anyway.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.540]  I don't know if they will be the first.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:42.540]  I don't know.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:44.220]  I know France has been doing a public questionnaire
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:46.220]  recently on the National Assembly.
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:48.220]  They're starting to ask people if they want to legalize
[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:50.220]  for recreational.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:52.220]  Let's see.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.220]  I don't know.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.220]  They're on the way for medicinal.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.220]  I think we are kind of like California was you know
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:00.220]  in the end of the 90s where they were kind of medicinal
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.220]  and starting to try stuff.
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:04.220]  And we're just missing another 10 15 years to be like
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:06.220]  like you are now which is the time that it took more
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:08.220]  or less to America.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.220]  You know we're just missing a lot of time.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:11.900]  It's the time that it took more or less to America.
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:13.900]  You know that's the knowledge that it's not that bad
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:15.900]  in most of the countries.
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:17.900]  They just don't know how to introduce it for the moment.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.900]  And when that happens that would be good.
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.900]  But hopefully in 10 years we're going to have more
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:23.900]  shops everywhere.
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:25.900]  You know I hope they can keep legalizing especially
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.900]  in Europe in Asia.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:29.900]  You know I would love to work in Asia also like going
[01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.900]  to Thailand and all this.
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:33.900]  That would be great.
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:35.900]  So let's keep the keep going.
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:37.900]  And may we all have our own business.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:39.580]  And may we all have our own bobblehead in 10 years.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:41.580]  I think that's funny that guy.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.580]  I still have mine in the living room.
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.580]  You know I always touch it when I pass next to it.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:47.580]  I say hello.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:49.580]  I don't know if my friend or sleeps with it.
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.580]  How many people you have on your show.
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:53.580]  Between how many we got right now.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.580]  Right now it's probably between 750 and 800 people
[01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:57.580]  watching.
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:55:59.580]  Oh that's a lot.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:01.580]  I mean I think it's probably between 700 and 800 people
[01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:03.580]  watching.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.580]  I think it's probably between 700 and 800 people watching.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.260]  Oh nice.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:09.260]  People for all coming online was great seeing everybody
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.260]  in California and wherever you guys are from.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.260]  Was nice.
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:15.260]  We got Spain South Africa.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.260]  Yeah it's global.
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.260]  Great.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:21.260]  That's nice.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:23.260]  Unified economies were up.
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.260]  Yeah.
[01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:28.260]  Yeah.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:30.260]  We'll be selling knockoff bobbleheads here in the near
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:32.260]  future.
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.260]  I need to come back to that.
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:35.940]  I need to come with a new one with a straight hunter one.
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.940]  Yeah.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.940]  Yeah.
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:41.940]  You really need to do another line of these.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  I want a bobblehead.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  My daughters would play with it.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.600]  By the way for everyone in the chat.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  My wife made me give my two year old a suppository at.
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  I think we started at 11.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  That was at 1045.
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:57.600]  And her general discomfort with that actually.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:56:59.600]  I think it was a little bit of a shock.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  I think it was a little bit of a shock.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.600]  I think it was a little bit of a shock.
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.280]  Her general discomfort with that activity was similar to me
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.280]  reading the chat for the past two hours.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.280]  So I have been noticing.
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.280]  But James you want to talk about what we just threw up on
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:13.280]  the website.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.280]  Oh yeah.
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  So we got some gelato autos for sale.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:19.280]  There's a limited supply of them.
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.280]  They're going to you know they're going to be a little bit
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.280]  more expensive.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:25.280]  So we're going to be selling them.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:27.280]  And we're going to be selling them.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.280]  And we're going to be selling them.
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.280]  And we're going to be selling them.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:32.960]  And there's a limited supply of them.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:34.960]  They're going to you know we got a lot of autos.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:36.960]  This is how we preserve seeds here.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:38.960]  Desiccants.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.960]  These are fresh seeds.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:42.960]  So these were harvested about a week ago.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:44.960]  We got a limited supply of these gelato autos.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:46.960]  There's you're getting.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:48.960]  So as far as genotypes you'll have purple genotypes and you'll
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.960]  have green and we haven't got it to all express purple.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.960]  But that's coming in the near future.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:56.960]  Hopefully by next year we'll have all purple gelatos.
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:58.960]  I feel like they have a lot of good nose on them.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.960]  They have good texture.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.960]  They're going to make people happy.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.960]  But again there's a limited amount.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:06.960]  So get them while you can.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:08.960]  And yeah it's a Valentine's Day special.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.960]  So we're selling them for five seeds for $50.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:13.960]  So yeah I appreciate it.
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.960]  And what else was I going to talk about.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:18.960]  Oh yeah we have some other show and tell stuff.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:20.960]  Hitman hitman bag.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960]  I don't know if you guys remember Dougie from Hitman.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:27.960]  You can go to I believe his website is take a hitman.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.960]  And he's got all kinds of cool bags and what not.
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:32.960]  And wallets.
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:34.960]  So yeah go check him out.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  You know I don't do any paid sponsorship for my show.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.960]  So it's only my friends products that I support.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:40.960]  Same thing go check out greenhouse seeds.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960]  You guys are looking for some good seeds.
[01:58:43.960 --> 01:58:44.960]  You guys still sell super silver haze.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.960]  Yes.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:48.960]  Nice.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:50.960]  It's a good one.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:52.960]  Yeah.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.960]  Just quickly a while ago someone asked about why no seed banks
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:58.960]  sell to the UK.
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.640]  Is that something.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:04.640]  And is that an issue getting you into the UK.
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:06.640]  No no we sell into the UK.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.640]  OK.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.640]  Yeah.
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:11.640]  No problem.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.640]  Greenhouse seed sells into the UK.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:15.640]  We have maybe not in the US.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:19.640]  And people can order you know if the retail we order.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:22.640]  The sales are booming on the retail side from us.
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.640]  So yeah they can.
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:26.640]  UK is not not not an issue.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.320]  They can just.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320]  I learned.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.320]  They can just.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:34.320]  Order retail and we send it.
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.320]  Yeah.
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:37.320]  Dougie is a Boston boy.
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.320]  Sorry I'm looking at the chat.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.320]  Hmm.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.320]  Yeah.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.320]  Maybe there's issues for companies sending from the US to the UK.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:46.320]  I can see that being a problem.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.320]  But.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.320]  Yeah.
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.320]  I really appreciate you guys coming on the show man.
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.320]  It's been good.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.320]  Thanks for having us.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000]  And I want to say bye bye to everybody.
[01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  Thank you for all being here.
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  And hope to see you some other podcasts in the near future.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  Thank you.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  And just some housekeeping.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  Tomorrow morning we have Tad Hussey.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  David Bernard Perrone who I guess is the has the largest organic facility in Canada.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  And Nelson Lindsley that I believe is at 9 a.m.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  And.
[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:25.680]  To everyone a happy Valentine's Day.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:29.680]  My wife lovingly brought me a an Italian grinder which I crushed.
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:35.680]  I kept trying to cut to you guys as like close up so I could like eat it really fast.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.680]  It was delicious if anyone was wondering.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.680]  But happy Valentine's Day everyone.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.680]  And we'll see you next week.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:46.680]  Happy Valentine's Day.
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:48.680]  Take care guys.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:50.680]  Thank you very much.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.360]  Have a great day.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.360]  See you soon.
