[00:00.760 --> 00:03.680]  All right, happy Wednesday to you guys.
[00:03.680 --> 00:06.720]  I'm learning some of the behind the scene things.
[00:06.720 --> 00:08.480]  Thanks to my boy London.
[00:08.480 --> 00:10.560]  Really kind of keep things more interactive.
[00:10.560 --> 00:13.040]  Like you guys said, you appreciate the fact
[00:13.040 --> 00:16.400]  that we're kind of being more as a family, as a group.
[00:16.400 --> 00:18.280]  And that's something that we want to keep moving forward
[00:18.280 --> 00:19.880]  in 2023.
[00:19.880 --> 00:21.440]  If you'll notice, we're really trying to make it
[00:21.440 --> 00:23.800]  where things are organized and we're propping up,
[00:23.800 --> 00:26.320]  in my opinion, some of the brightest minds
[00:26.320 --> 00:30.720]  that we have here, Marco, that I have in my Rolodex.
[00:31.640 --> 00:33.240]  You know, the audience might not necessarily
[00:33.240 --> 00:35.080]  have heard of NJ last week,
[00:35.080 --> 00:38.480]  but I hope that you guys go back and watch his video.
[00:38.480 --> 00:41.640]  You know, he's really creating medicine for the community
[00:41.640 --> 00:43.120]  and he's been doing it for a while.
[00:43.120 --> 00:45.320]  And he's just somebody that I think a lot of people
[00:45.320 --> 00:46.440]  need to listen to.
[00:46.440 --> 00:48.120]  He's somebody that I personally admire.
[00:48.120 --> 00:50.320]  Like I think just his energy,
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.760]  who he is as a person is contagious.
[00:52.760 --> 00:54.440]  So if you haven't checked that out, you know,
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.280]  check him out.
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.160]  That's his logo right there as well.
[00:57.160 --> 00:59.360]  And then another reason I, you know,
[00:59.360 --> 01:01.120]  giving an extra shout out today to MJ
[01:01.120 --> 01:03.960]  is because he's been like the hype man for Robbie
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.840]  since I can remember, to be honest.
[01:05.840 --> 01:07.960]  I mean, he's been out there doing his thing,
[01:07.960 --> 01:11.000]  going to all the events, talking about nerds genetics,
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.360]  talking about nerds genetics,
[01:12.360 --> 01:15.120]  talking about nerds genetics, growing those genetics.
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.000]  I'd be going to, you know, some different events
[01:18.000 --> 01:18.840]  and that kind of stuff.
[01:18.840 --> 01:21.440]  And without letting the person know,
[01:21.440 --> 01:23.720]  I, you know, I knew that they were getting that from MJ
[01:23.720 --> 01:25.560]  because there's just nobody else that hyped it,
[01:25.560 --> 01:28.640]  especially with the WODY and like all these, like,
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.600]  just kind of like classic strains,
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.720]  I felt like that were found here in Denver.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.320]  So, you know, now from what I understand,
[01:35.320 --> 01:38.000]  it's going nationally and as well as internationally.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.800]  We were talking to London right before we came on here live.
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.120]  So when you put in the work, which Robbie does,
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.760]  you have a hype man like MJ,
[01:46.760 --> 01:48.520]  then of course you're going to find success.
[01:48.520 --> 01:51.440]  And you know, you know, salute and hats off to you, Robbie,
[01:51.440 --> 01:53.720]  because I've even personally wanted to hang out with you
[01:53.720 --> 01:54.560]  in an event before,
[01:54.560 --> 01:56.800]  because I just think you're a great human being.
[01:56.840 --> 01:58.400]  And I hope more people find out
[01:58.400 --> 02:00.320]  about your genetics moving forward.
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.120]  Oh, thank you for that intro.
[02:03.120 --> 02:04.520]  That's amazing.
[02:04.520 --> 02:06.800]  And you know, before we go any further,
[02:06.800 --> 02:09.200]  I also want to give my support to MJ
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.400]  because that dude really is brilliant.
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.440]  And I've seen him really put in the work over the years.
[02:15.440 --> 02:17.200]  I mean, when we first met,
[02:18.440 --> 02:22.800]  probably like 2015, 16, somewhere in there,
[02:24.120 --> 02:26.640]  you know, he was already doing it pretty big
[02:27.480 --> 02:29.880]  and where he is now compared to where he is now
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.080]  is such a beautiful thing.
[02:31.080 --> 02:33.600]  And you know, it just really shows
[02:33.600 --> 02:35.320]  that if you have passion and you have drive,
[02:35.320 --> 02:36.880]  you can really do anything you want to.
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.240]  And I just, I love seeing that out there.
[02:40.240 --> 02:43.520]  I love his energy and I love that you guys are,
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.720]  you know, really showing, giving him his props,
[02:45.720 --> 02:48.160]  giving him his flowers, you know what I'm saying?
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.280]  So.
[02:49.280 --> 02:50.120]  Nice.
[02:50.120 --> 02:52.520]  Yeah, I want to give Marco the mic for a little bit
[02:52.520 --> 02:54.040]  and then we'll get into it, Robbie.
[02:54.040 --> 02:54.880]  Cool.
[02:54.880 --> 02:56.120]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:56.520 --> 02:57.680]  Yeah, man, when you said you were having on
[02:57.680 --> 03:00.200]  NERS Genetics, I'm going to be honest,
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.600]  I didn't know a lot about NERS Genetics, Robbie,
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.400]  but when Brian put that stamp on it for me,
[03:06.400 --> 03:07.560]  you know, I mean, pretty much he said,
[03:07.560 --> 03:09.800]  hey, this guy is legit, he knows his shit.
[03:09.800 --> 03:10.880]  And that's what I'm looking for.
[03:10.880 --> 03:14.280]  I love genetics, which are proven, which are solid.
[03:14.280 --> 03:15.120]  You know what I mean?
[03:15.120 --> 03:17.200]  I've tried a lot of different things as a grower
[03:17.200 --> 03:19.480]  over the years, a lot of people's gear,
[03:19.480 --> 03:22.040]  the hype stuff, you know, the stuff that
[03:22.040 --> 03:24.520]  supposed to be all that doesn't end up being that sometimes.
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.000]  So I really appreciate the person that just grinds,
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.640]  puts in that work and puts out that good quality
[03:31.640 --> 03:32.560]  time after time.
[03:32.560 --> 03:34.520]  So I'm really looking forward to, man,
[03:34.520 --> 03:36.720]  just talking to you and learning some stuff today.
[03:36.720 --> 03:38.880]  You know, I've been, like I said, growing different things.
[03:38.880 --> 03:41.000]  And right now I've got two males, you know,
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.400]  that I'm holding on to, which I'm going to save
[03:43.400 --> 03:44.960]  a little bit of pollen, you know what I mean?
[03:44.960 --> 03:47.920]  And just kind of start really getting serious about,
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.280]  you know, going after some traits that I want for myself
[03:51.280 --> 03:52.800]  and doing that kind of thing.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.760]  So man, it's going to be really good to kind of get
[03:54.760 --> 03:56.520]  into all that kind of stuff.
[03:56.520 --> 03:58.920]  And yeah, man, with that said,
[03:58.920 --> 04:00.040]  I don't know a lot about you.
[04:00.040 --> 04:02.280]  So why don't you just kind of, you know,
[04:02.280 --> 04:04.600]  tell us all a little bit of what you want us to know
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.320]  about yourself and kind of how long you've been doing it,
[04:07.320 --> 04:09.360]  how you started and where you're at right now
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.320]  and kind of plans for the future.
[04:11.320 --> 04:13.520]  You know how we do, we just have a good conversation here,
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.920]  man, and just keep it going.
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.200]  You know, that's, this plant found me,
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.840]  like so many of us, like that I didn't really know
[04:23.840 --> 04:26.440]  that I was choosing this life.
[04:26.440 --> 04:28.080]  It sort of found me.
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.440]  When I was in college, I ran cross country
[04:34.440 --> 04:39.440]  and I was running some absurd number of miles a week,
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.160]  like, you know, around a hundred miles a week
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.280]  to, you know, be competitive on this cross country team.
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.920]  And three days before regionals, my junior year,
[04:49.920 --> 04:51.880]  I broke both my feet at the same time.
[04:51.880 --> 04:54.960]  I woke up and got out of bed and collapsed,
[04:54.960 --> 04:56.840]  just like went straight to ground.
[04:58.680 --> 05:01.680]  They took me in for x-rays, told me I had stress fractures
[05:01.680 --> 05:04.520]  and my second metatarsal in both of my feet.
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.200]  And the next statement that they made was,
[05:09.200 --> 05:11.040]  you know, if you want to,
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.280]  you could still run the race in three days,
[05:14.320 --> 05:16.920]  but it's just gonna hurt like hell.
[05:16.920 --> 05:19.920]  And my cross country coach looked at me and said,
[05:19.920 --> 05:22.520]  well, what do you think Rob?
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.200]  And so I ran the race, cause I'm dumb,
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.200]  or, you know, I was young at the time,
[05:30.200 --> 05:35.200]  but I ran the race and it set a chain of events in place
[05:37.640 --> 05:40.760]  that have like determined everything else afterwards.
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.320]  So after running the race, I ran the second fastest time
[05:45.320 --> 05:48.960]  that I had ever run in any five mile course
[05:48.960 --> 05:51.280]  in all of the years,
[05:51.280 --> 05:53.920]  but it was the last race that I was ever able to run.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.800]  It fully just like, just broke my whole body.
[06:00.720 --> 06:03.160]  Three months after that race,
[06:03.160 --> 06:07.800]  I went to do my study abroad trip for college.
[06:07.840 --> 06:11.120]  And it just so happened that I was going to Holland.
[06:12.120 --> 06:15.720]  Like that just happened to be the one that worked
[06:15.720 --> 06:20.040]  with my program of study and like all of the different things
[06:20.040 --> 06:22.680]  that like I was going to Holland, right?
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.320]  So I get to Holland and the first thing that we do
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.120]  after I've gotten out of my boot
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.200]  is go on like a three day walking tour over cobblestones.
[06:34.200 --> 06:36.440]  And I just immediately broke both feet again.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.800]  And so now I'm in Europe.
[06:38.880 --> 06:42.720]  I'm there all by myself as like a 20, 21 year old kid.
[06:44.160 --> 06:49.160]  And there is nothing about the like West
[06:49.280 --> 06:51.200]  or the like American medical system
[06:51.200 --> 06:53.520]  that really translates to that place.
[06:53.520 --> 06:55.840]  And there's a lot of really beautiful things
[06:55.840 --> 06:57.320]  about their medical system,
[06:57.320 --> 07:01.080]  but what came about of it to make a long story short
[07:01.080 --> 07:05.720]  is they suggested that in order to deal with the pain
[07:05.960 --> 07:09.240]  of having two broken feet and walking on cobblestones,
[07:09.240 --> 07:11.560]  that I explore cannabis.
[07:11.560 --> 07:15.040]  And like I had been exposed to cannabis before.
[07:15.040 --> 07:17.200]  It was something that like, you know,
[07:17.200 --> 07:22.080]  I'd smoked weed or whatever, but like there at the time,
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.520]  it was a very different thing.
[07:23.520 --> 07:28.440]  It was like the first time when I was able to see
[07:28.440 --> 07:31.800]  all of the different strains
[07:31.800 --> 07:34.080]  and what cannabis could really do.
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.760]  You know, like with before that, up until that point,
[07:36.760 --> 07:39.560]  if you saw cannabis in the United States for the most part,
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.680]  unless you were a really like lucky person,
[07:42.680 --> 07:45.400]  you were getting whatever your dude had, you know,
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.840]  like however that worked out,
[07:46.840 --> 07:48.200]  that's what you were getting.
[07:48.200 --> 07:49.880]  And it was gonna be that,
[07:49.880 --> 07:52.160]  that's as good as it is, you know.
[07:52.160 --> 07:54.720]  But then I'm in Holland and I can order off a menu
[07:54.720 --> 07:56.880]  and I can pick things that I can go back to strains
[07:56.880 --> 07:59.560]  that like are actually helping in some ways.
[07:59.560 --> 08:02.920]  And like I can avoid strains that are hurting in other ways.
[08:02.920 --> 08:06.960]  And I just got absolutely fascinated with this plant.
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.960]  And so I came back after that trip, mostly healed,
[08:14.240 --> 08:16.400]  mostly my feet were mostly healed,
[08:16.400 --> 08:20.440]  but the fire inside me had been lit, right?
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.680]  So I immediately started, you know,
[08:24.680 --> 08:29.680]  growing in what first was a very small, small scale.
[08:29.680 --> 08:31.480]  I think most of the viewers out there,
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.480]  if you saw my first grow, you would laugh truly.
[08:36.840 --> 08:40.080]  You know, it was hilarious and, you know,
[08:40.080 --> 08:44.640]  awesome for what it was, but compared to where we built,
[08:44.640 --> 08:46.640]  you know, it didn't happen overnight.
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.640]  And so over time I was exposed to different things
[08:52.240 --> 08:53.520]  and different people.
[08:53.520 --> 08:57.600]  When I moved to Boulder, I met two groups of people.
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.600]  One, they kind of got me started on the, like,
[09:02.880 --> 09:06.920]  the basics of like where I needed to resource myself
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.960]  on how to take clones, on what kind of lights to buy,
[09:09.960 --> 09:12.160]  on like all the different things.
[09:12.160 --> 09:13.920]  And then another group out of Florida
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.120]  that ended up mentoring me for a lot of years,
[09:17.120 --> 09:21.720]  basically up until we started Nerds and Beyond.
[09:21.720 --> 09:25.360]  And they had been doing it for a really, really long time,
[09:25.360 --> 09:26.800]  like since the early nineties.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.400]  And the game went from something that was done
[09:31.400 --> 09:34.280]  because it was a personal fascination to suddenly,
[09:34.280 --> 09:35.560]  this is something that I could do
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.720]  that I can help a lot of people with.
[09:37.720 --> 09:40.040]  And I can start to bring a whole lot
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.800]  of really interesting things to all these people.
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.600]  Because at 2014, I don't know if you guys really remember,
[09:47.600 --> 09:50.520]  but it was hard to buy seeds.
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.440]  It was not like it is today
[09:52.440 --> 09:54.360]  where there are seeds on every corner, you know?
[09:54.360 --> 09:56.640]  Like it was hard to find seeds.
[09:57.480 --> 09:58.400]  And scary.
[09:58.400 --> 10:00.880]  Yeah, that was, it was scary to buy them.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.920]  You know, like you had to find somebody to do it.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.720]  You never knew what you were going to get.
[10:04.720 --> 10:07.000]  There was always like all these different stuff.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  Like I remember ordering from Barney's Seed Bank
[10:12.040 --> 10:13.680]  out of Amsterdam.
[10:13.680 --> 10:16.880]  And I, you know, I know now that what I got
[10:16.880 --> 10:18.960]  was not from Barney's Seed Bank,
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.320]  but I grew out a plant that I grew for 120 days
[10:24.320 --> 10:26.360]  and never produced any usable weed.
[10:28.040 --> 10:30.080]  Like it just got bigger and bigger and bigger
[10:30.080 --> 10:31.280]  and never flowered.
[10:31.280 --> 10:33.400]  It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[10:33.400 --> 10:35.600]  It was, the only thing I can compare it to
[10:35.600 --> 10:39.440]  is this Landrace American hemp that I saw out in Kansas.
[10:40.480 --> 10:44.200]  It was like, it was unlike anything I've ever seen.
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.800]  And it was supposed to be vanilla cush.
[10:45.800 --> 10:47.680]  Because I mean, this thing was 12 feet tall.
[10:47.680 --> 10:49.480]  There was no way it was a cush.
[10:49.480 --> 10:51.920]  So it was a-
[10:51.960 --> 10:53.560]  It was what it was.
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.720]  Yeah, whatever it was, it was wild.
[10:58.720 --> 11:03.720]  But at that time, you know, like we saw this huge need,
[11:04.040 --> 11:06.360]  you know, and I remember talking to the guy
[11:06.360 --> 11:07.960]  that I founded Nerds with,
[11:07.960 --> 11:11.000]  and we were walking through the mountains
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.680]  and we were talking about, you know,
[11:12.680 --> 11:15.400]  like why it is that it's so hard
[11:15.400 --> 11:16.880]  to find all these good genetics
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.440]  and why it is that like, because we're in Colorado
[11:19.440 --> 11:22.000]  and the doors just opened,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.040]  we can have, you know, 70 awesome strains
[11:25.040 --> 11:26.720]  in between our crews.
[11:28.160 --> 11:31.920]  And the rest of the world is fighting to find one,
[11:31.920 --> 11:35.920]  you know, so that's really where it all started.
[11:35.920 --> 11:37.120]  And like from there,
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.320]  there's been a whole lot of evolution for sure.
[11:40.320 --> 11:42.720]  But where it really started was like,
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.960]  how can we make it so that the people
[11:44.960 --> 11:48.440]  who wanna grow their own have something to grow,
[11:48.440 --> 11:49.680]  have something to look through,
[11:49.680 --> 11:51.720]  have something to learn how to phenotype
[11:51.720 --> 11:52.960]  or phenotype with.
[11:53.760 --> 11:56.320]  And, you know, that's really where it started.
[11:56.320 --> 11:57.880]  So.
[11:57.880 --> 11:59.120]  Nice.
[11:59.120 --> 12:00.560]  Yeah, man, it was sketchy.
[12:00.560 --> 12:03.400]  And I will say, I used to mess with Barneys
[12:03.400 --> 12:05.960]  and try some different strains with that stuff.
[12:05.960 --> 12:08.120]  And it was very inconsistent, like you said,
[12:08.120 --> 12:10.320]  like, you know, you got what you got,
[12:10.320 --> 12:11.440]  you know, pretty much, man.
[12:11.440 --> 12:15.680]  So yeah, I can relate to that 100%.
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.280]  Yeah, we've joked on the show, Rob,
[12:17.280 --> 12:19.120]  about like, it was some of that shit,
[12:19.120 --> 12:22.560]  the t-shirt was with more than the genetics they shipped you.
[12:22.560 --> 12:26.160]  So a lot of that stuff was just kind of like flying blind.
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.400]  I remember, you know, greenhouse,
[12:28.400 --> 12:31.000]  was it greenhouse seeds with the super lemon haze?
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.680]  I don't know if you guys have ever messed around with that.
[12:33.680 --> 12:35.160]  For me, that was the only one that seemed
[12:35.160 --> 12:37.320]  like I ever got the real deal stuff
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.440]  and could play around with it.
[12:38.440 --> 12:40.600]  And it's one of those, oh, I wish I could go back.
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.680]  And, you know, there were some genetics out there
[12:43.680 --> 12:46.520]  that were just really hard to get a hold of.
[12:46.520 --> 12:49.080]  Now, here we are in Denver, Marco,
[12:49.080 --> 12:51.720]  we have one of the, I think,
[12:51.720 --> 12:54.200]  one of the bigger brains on the subject.
[12:54.200 --> 12:56.520]  So we wanna talk about genetics,
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.200]  but we wanna nerd out with genetics.
[12:58.200 --> 12:59.920]  And I think the community deserves that
[12:59.920 --> 13:02.160]  with like just really kind of breaking things down.
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.120]  That's why I reached out to you.
[13:04.120 --> 13:05.840]  You know, you live up to the name
[13:05.840 --> 13:08.120]  that you decided for your brand.
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.960]  And there's something to that when individuals like MJ
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.000]  and people like, you know, in his little circle,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.520]  where they're able to create just something for themselves
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.320]  because of the work that you've done.
[13:19.320 --> 13:20.640]  So I wanted to talk about more
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.800]  how you're able to create stable genetics
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.040]  that, you know, we'll be candid here,
[13:25.040 --> 13:26.800]  that feed people's families.
[13:26.800 --> 13:28.720]  I mean, your stuff is so solid
[13:28.720 --> 13:31.920]  that other individuals are willing to, you know,
[13:31.920 --> 13:34.720]  risk their entire basement with your gear.
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.440]  And I think a lot of that came based off of MJ's
[13:37.440 --> 13:41.000]  kind of like co-sign for being friends with you,
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.920]  where a lot of people started to just find out who you were.
[13:43.920 --> 13:47.360]  And I hope after today as well, obviously that's continuing.
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.880]  But, you know, can we dive deeper, sir,
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.080]  when you're talking about genetics?
[13:51.080 --> 13:52.720]  Like, I think a lot of us understand
[13:52.720 --> 13:54.280]  the basics of breeding,
[13:54.280 --> 13:56.800]  but what is the stuff where you're really finding,
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.360]  you have an eye for this, obviously.
[13:58.360 --> 14:01.560]  So what are these girls when they're going through this,
[14:01.560 --> 14:03.040]  what makes them stand out?
[14:04.800 --> 14:09.800]  Yeah, you know, the simple answer to that, Brian,
[14:10.080 --> 14:13.080]  is that being a good breeder is being a good grower.
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.800]  And, you know, when a part of being a good grower
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.240]  is learning to be absolutely brutal
[14:22.240 --> 14:24.760]  with your selection process.
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.680]  And something that like any real seed head
[14:29.680 --> 14:32.160]  is gonna find out if they like ever take this
[14:32.160 --> 14:36.600]  into any kind of, you know, any kind of big scale.
[14:36.600 --> 14:38.520]  Like even like, let's say for you,
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.560]  10 plants is a big scale, that can be a big scale.
[14:41.560 --> 14:43.920]  But whatever a big scale is to you,
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.000]  if you start going through and realizing,
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.160]  okay, I'm gonna pop 10 different seeds,
[14:48.160 --> 14:50.520]  and I'm gonna go through and I'm going to select
[14:50.520 --> 14:52.480]  which one of this that keeps going,
[14:52.480 --> 14:54.040]  and then I'm gonna pop 10 more seeds.
[14:54.040 --> 14:56.600]  Well, suddenly you've got 20 things
[14:56.600 --> 14:58.480]  that you have to select from.
[14:58.480 --> 15:03.480]  And if you aren't able or willing to decide
[15:03.600 --> 15:05.120]  what it is that you care about,
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.560]  and what it is that you're looking for,
[15:08.560 --> 15:10.520]  then there's no other steps.
[15:10.520 --> 15:14.240]  You're done there in the water.
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.920]  So, you know, a huge part of this is that
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.240]  if you wanna be a breeder,
[15:21.600 --> 15:25.880]  you gotta decide what you wanna grow for.
[15:25.880 --> 15:28.080]  You know, like what do you wanna bring to the world?
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.560]  What do you wanna bring to these things?
[15:29.560 --> 15:31.880]  And we'll go deeper on all of this stuff.
[15:31.880 --> 15:34.000]  I'm just kind of getting started a little bit.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.720]  But, you know, I think that realistically
[15:38.080 --> 15:40.880]  that's the first question that everybody needs to ask.
[15:41.880 --> 15:43.800]  I'm gonna liken this to skateboarding real quick
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.960]  because I think it's a really good analogy.
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.400]  I have been a lifelong skateboarder.
[15:50.400 --> 15:53.600]  I'm not good by any means, don't get that.
[15:53.600 --> 15:55.640]  Don't get that impression, but I love it.
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.920]  And when you are in a skate park,
[15:59.920 --> 16:02.160]  you can see the difference between the people
[16:02.160 --> 16:03.760]  who learn to ride the board first
[16:03.760 --> 16:05.960]  and the people who just wanted to do tricks.
[16:06.760 --> 16:11.040]  And there's a different style, there's a different flow,
[16:11.040 --> 16:12.600]  there's a different everything.
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.360]  And when you look at breeders who didn't learn to grow first
[16:16.360 --> 16:18.560]  and just wanted to be a breeder,
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.880]  then there's a different style and there's a different flow
[16:21.880 --> 16:23.160]  and there's a different outcome
[16:23.160 --> 16:25.160]  and there's a different everything.
[16:25.160 --> 16:30.160]  Yeah, so I think that when we're looking at this,
[16:30.360 --> 16:33.280]  like the ones who really fall in love with this
[16:33.280 --> 16:34.840]  who are here for the time
[16:35.840 --> 16:39.760]  that are gonna be breeders 10, 15, 20 years from now,
[16:39.760 --> 16:42.200]  they're gonna be breeders 10, 15, 20 years from now
[16:42.200 --> 16:44.120]  because they love this plant.
[16:44.120 --> 16:46.160]  They love every bit about this plant.
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.720]  They love the nuances, they love the hunt.
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.280]  They love the fact that it's not always the same.
[16:52.280 --> 16:55.000]  They love the fact that sometimes it doesn't work.
[16:55.000 --> 16:56.800]  Yeah, if it worked all the time,
[16:56.800 --> 16:59.400]  this would be an awful, awful thing.
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.120]  Like it just, it would be okay, I guess,
[17:04.200 --> 17:06.160]  but it wouldn't be interesting.
[17:07.040 --> 17:09.600]  Part of what keeps it interesting
[17:09.600 --> 17:11.000]  is because sometimes it doesn't work
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.060]  and you have no idea why it doesn't work.
[17:14.360 --> 17:18.320]  And I think that's a really interesting part
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.640]  is that I think that there's been,
[17:23.960 --> 17:26.400]  in some ways, like the breeding community
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.880]  has been sort of put on a little bit of a pedestal
[17:29.320 --> 17:34.320]  and part of the reason
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.320]  that I'm not sure that that's always correct,
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.760]  and some of the reason that it is sometimes correct,
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.360]  it goes back to the love and the reasons
[17:47.360 --> 17:49.760]  that why we're doing this in the first place.
[17:49.760 --> 17:53.040]  You know, like if it's all just about
[17:54.880 --> 17:57.880]  the money that can be made from it,
[17:57.880 --> 18:02.480]  then this won't last because like, this is an art,
[18:02.480 --> 18:04.760]  you know, growing is an art, breeding is an art,
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.680]  and you have to learn to hone your skills
[18:09.680 --> 18:14.680]  in order to best portray the art that you see in your head.
[18:16.040 --> 18:19.200]  And, you know, growing is the first skill
[18:19.200 --> 18:20.040]  that you have to learn.
[18:20.040 --> 18:22.440]  Like that is the drawing to painting.
[18:23.440 --> 18:28.440]  And, you know, we, I've probably spent the vast majority
[18:30.120 --> 18:32.440]  of my career trying to be a better grower.
[18:33.320 --> 18:35.720]  And as a result, that's made me a better breeder.
[18:35.720 --> 18:38.200]  And then what has been super interesting
[18:38.200 --> 18:40.960]  is trying to become a better hash maker
[18:40.960 --> 18:42.680]  has also made me a better breeder
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.280]  because I've learned so many different things
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.360]  about the plant and the way that it expresses
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.360]  in ice water hash and rosin and things like that,
[18:58.160 --> 19:01.520]  that it has made me rethink the questions
[19:01.520 --> 19:04.440]  about what I was selecting for in the first place
[19:04.440 --> 19:07.080]  and whether or not something might have been a keeper
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.640]  that I didn't understand was a keeper at the time.
[19:11.960 --> 19:12.880]  That's deep.
[19:12.880 --> 19:15.440]  I got a question staying on that same topic,
[19:15.440 --> 19:17.440]  but going back to kind of starting off,
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.360]  that brutal selection process.
[19:20.400 --> 19:23.360]  Yeah, I'm always a fan of tough love
[19:23.360 --> 19:25.840]  when it comes to like, you know, selecting things,
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.000]  you know, I feel like you gotta put it through its paces.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.600]  Now, what's your thoughts on that?
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.040]  Because there's two lines of thinking,
[19:32.040 --> 19:34.040]  well, man, I got these seeds.
[19:34.040 --> 19:36.240]  I just should nurture everyone,
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.800]  make sure everyone gets to the finish line
[19:38.800 --> 19:41.640]  so I can flower it and see what it's all about.
[19:41.640 --> 19:44.880]  Or do I take that pack and say, well,
[19:44.880 --> 19:46.920]  two of them struggle coming out the gate.
[19:46.920 --> 19:48.840]  I don't want those, you know what I mean?
[19:48.880 --> 19:51.480]  Oh, shit, missed a day of watering here,
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.560]  halfway through, lost a couple more, that's okay.
[19:55.560 --> 19:56.880]  And then you whittle that down
[19:56.880 --> 19:59.400]  kind of with a tough selection process
[19:59.400 --> 20:02.720]  to you got five or maybe even only four
[20:02.720 --> 20:05.040]  out of that 10 starting out with it even survive.
[20:05.040 --> 20:06.440]  What's the thought process?
[20:06.440 --> 20:08.880]  Should you focus more on getting all 10
[20:08.880 --> 20:10.760]  to the finish line starting out
[20:10.760 --> 20:12.800]  or just go ahead and whittle them on out?
[20:12.800 --> 20:14.000]  You know what I mean?
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.800]  Well, all right, so there are sort of,
[20:17.800 --> 20:20.160]  there are two directions that we can go with this question
[20:20.160 --> 20:22.640]  and I wanna talk about both of them.
[20:22.640 --> 20:27.640]  The first one is, okay, so what is your goal?
[20:29.280 --> 20:32.480]  Are you a commercial grower or are you a home grower?
[20:32.480 --> 20:35.280]  Right, because if you're a commercial grower,
[20:35.280 --> 20:37.200]  there's a totally different line of thinking
[20:37.200 --> 20:42.200]  I think that you need to take than if you're a home grower
[20:42.320 --> 20:45.280]  and you're just growing for yourself, right?
[20:45.280 --> 20:48.440]  So let's just real quickly go down the home grower,
[20:48.440 --> 20:50.500]  I'm just growing for myself situation.
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.760]  If you are a home grower
[20:52.760 --> 20:54.280]  and you're just growing for yourself,
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.800]  then the most important thing that comes out of it,
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.200]  in my opinion, is the flower.
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.920]  And the goal should be to have the best flower
[21:02.920 --> 21:03.800]  as your medicine.
[21:05.560 --> 21:07.600]  So in that particular case,
[21:07.600 --> 21:10.080]  I think the best strategy would be to try
[21:10.080 --> 21:14.080]  and nurture all 10 plants and get them to the end
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.760]  to find out if any of the flowers are something
[21:16.760 --> 21:18.680]  that works for your system,
[21:20.440 --> 21:22.520]  that is going to benefit your life
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.860]  and not take away from it.
[21:25.440 --> 21:30.440]  And, you know, because not all weeds work with all people,
[21:30.600 --> 21:33.880]  that's something that I've definitely seen in the years
[21:33.880 --> 21:35.500]  and it's certainly true for me,
[21:35.500 --> 21:38.580]  there are some strains that I just honestly can't smoke.
[21:38.580 --> 21:41.580]  Other of my friends will tell me it's their favorite thing
[21:41.580 --> 21:45.020]  and I'll get a panic attack from it,
[21:45.020 --> 21:46.700]  you know, or something like that.
[21:46.700 --> 21:49.980]  So I think it's reasonable that we need
[21:49.980 --> 21:52.260]  to put into the conversation,
[21:52.260 --> 21:55.020]  like you need to be able to select for you
[21:55.020 --> 21:57.540]  if you're a home grower and you are growing
[21:57.540 --> 22:02.020]  for just your personal medicine needs or personal desires,
[22:02.020 --> 22:04.860]  like, you know, some strains are gonna work better for you
[22:04.860 --> 22:06.180]  and you should grow those.
[22:07.020 --> 22:09.720]  But if you're a commercial grower,
[22:09.720 --> 22:12.700]  there's a whole different line of parameters
[22:12.700 --> 22:14.540]  that you have to think about.
[22:14.540 --> 22:16.700]  And so like if you're a commercial grower
[22:16.700 --> 22:19.380]  and you're doing a commercial pheno hunt,
[22:19.380 --> 22:21.820]  I think that really the way to do it then
[22:21.820 --> 22:26.260]  is to do it more in the other style
[22:26.260 --> 22:27.240]  where you were talking about
[22:27.240 --> 22:29.260]  where you give them incredibly tough love,
[22:29.260 --> 22:31.700]  where you try and put it through a system
[22:31.700 --> 22:35.780]  where you're not giving them anything
[22:36.340 --> 22:37.180]  and you're just kind of seeing what shines,
[22:37.180 --> 22:40.020]  you know, like in a commercial grow,
[22:40.020 --> 22:42.100]  depending on how big your commercial grow is,
[22:42.100 --> 22:44.020]  you have the ability to go through,
[22:45.140 --> 22:47.740]  or if you build a pheno hunt room,
[22:47.740 --> 22:50.100]  you have the ability to go through however many you need
[22:50.100 --> 22:52.700]  to fit your audience, right?
[22:55.100 --> 22:56.600]  In those cases, you know,
[22:56.600 --> 23:00.260]  I think that it's really important to select away
[23:00.260 --> 23:03.860]  from things that you could potentially not get to flower
[23:03.860 --> 23:05.780]  in a commercial space.
[23:05.780 --> 23:07.620]  You know, if you're pheno hunting for something
[23:07.620 --> 23:09.380]  that has to make money,
[23:09.380 --> 23:13.180]  then your goal has to be getting to the end product
[23:13.180 --> 23:15.660]  every single time, no matter what.
[23:15.660 --> 23:18.740]  And in that case, it's probably better for you
[23:18.740 --> 23:22.140]  to sacrifice a little bit of quality of end product
[23:22.140 --> 23:24.860]  in order to make sure that the end product you get
[23:24.860 --> 23:26.860]  is quality, if that makes sense.
[23:28.140 --> 23:29.680]  You know, if it's easier to grow
[23:29.680 --> 23:31.820]  and it's easier to get out in a situation
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.460]  where you're just not able to give them
[23:33.460 --> 23:36.300]  the same amount of love, because let's be honest,
[23:36.300 --> 23:38.180]  there's no commercial grow in the world
[23:38.180 --> 23:41.480]  that can give a thousand plants the same love
[23:41.480 --> 23:43.920]  that somebody gives 10 or one.
[23:44.900 --> 23:46.120]  It's just not possible.
[23:47.160 --> 23:49.460]  There's not enough energy to spread around in the world.
[23:49.460 --> 23:52.900]  So when you look at that kind of situation,
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.980]  you need to hunt for different stuff.
[23:54.980 --> 23:58.700]  And when I'm hunting for a commercial facility,
[23:58.700 --> 24:02.020]  it's a totally different list of parameters
[24:02.020 --> 24:03.900]  than maybe if I'm hunting for myself.
[24:05.140 --> 24:07.540]  And both are totally valid.
[24:07.540 --> 24:12.540]  But I would also say that for me as a breeder
[24:12.540 --> 24:14.540]  and a commercial grower, most of the time
[24:14.540 --> 24:18.300]  when I do pheno hunts, I hunt as a commercial grower.
[24:20.380 --> 24:25.100]  Because in order for me to keep however many strains
[24:25.100 --> 24:27.820]  that I'm keeping at a time, which is generally a lot,
[24:28.140 --> 24:31.420]  and our Oklahoma facility, I think we have
[24:31.420 --> 24:36.420]  about a hundred pheno hunted cuts right now.
[24:38.100 --> 24:41.300]  And that list is ever expanding.
[24:48.460 --> 24:50.460]  I think he froze there for a second.
[24:53.060 --> 24:58.060]  Yeah, last thing I heard was a hundred rooted pheno hunts
[24:59.020 --> 25:01.380]  or clones from pheno hunts.
[25:01.380 --> 25:04.700]  Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I reached out to Rob
[25:04.700 --> 25:07.460]  is he puts in the work.
[25:07.460 --> 25:08.300]  Hi, am I back?
[25:08.300 --> 25:09.140]  Hello?
[25:09.140 --> 25:09.960]  All right, we're back.
[25:09.960 --> 25:11.340]  Here we go.
[25:11.340 --> 25:12.460]  Guys?
[25:12.460 --> 25:17.460]  Yeah, the last thing we heard was a hundred pheno hunts.
[25:17.740 --> 25:18.580]  Am I back?
[25:20.540 --> 25:21.740]  Yep, can you hear us?
[25:23.660 --> 25:26.380]  Yeah, he's getting it back, it looks like.
[25:26.380 --> 25:27.780]  Hello?
[25:28.540 --> 25:29.460]  Hey, can you hear us?
[25:31.500 --> 25:33.540]  If you can hear us, leave and come back.
[25:41.720 --> 25:42.880]  Can you hear us, Rob?
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.320]  Guy, I don't know if you can hear me,
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.080]  but I can't hear anything, I got totally disconnected.
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.500]  We can hear you now, can you hear us now?
[26:02.280 --> 26:03.120]  I pushed it.
[26:03.120 --> 26:05.120]  It looks like he's leaving and coming back.
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.680]  But yeah, man, this is getting,
[26:07.680 --> 26:08.760]  and it's gonna be great, man.
[26:08.760 --> 26:11.200]  I wanted to just leave the gold bar up the whole time
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.520]  because everything's just pretty much bars.
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.560]  He'll come back on, I'm not tripping.
[26:16.560 --> 26:19.800]  So from just the way he does things, man,
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.360]  the way he broke that down,
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.480]  the way you do it from homegrower standpoint to a commercial,
[26:24.480 --> 26:26.000]  I hope this shit is really,
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.280]  people are hearing this
[26:27.280 --> 26:29.680]  because I think it makes a lot of sense.
[26:29.680 --> 26:32.080]  And I can't wait to really get into his strings.
[26:32.960 --> 26:34.840]  Yeah, no, there he is.
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.720]  Hey, I'm so sorry, guys.
[26:37.720 --> 26:38.560]  No problem, man.
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.960]  We have technical difficulties every now and then.
[26:42.200 --> 26:43.040]  All right.
[26:45.520 --> 26:47.040]  You can hear us now though, right?
[26:47.040 --> 26:48.720]  I'm not sure where it shut off.
[26:49.720 --> 26:50.560]  I can, yes.
[26:51.680 --> 26:52.520]  All right.
[26:52.520 --> 26:53.920]  Well, one of the things I wanted to talk about,
[26:53.920 --> 26:56.440]  you're bringing up the selections
[26:56.440 --> 26:58.400]  and especially being out in Oklahoma,
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.800]  all of a sudden all these different shops are popping up.
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.000]  People newer to farming, they wanna pheno hunt.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.920]  And I've seen small mom and pop operations,
[27:08.920 --> 27:10.640]  that was actually part of their downfall
[27:11.080 --> 27:13.760]  was they just didn't have stable genetics to pay the bills.
[27:13.760 --> 27:16.360]  And they went after all these different genetics at first.
[27:16.360 --> 27:17.800]  So I wanted to kind of talk about more
[27:17.800 --> 27:19.000]  of on the commercial side.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.600]  It does seem like if you're building out a facility,
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.560]  you need something that is your stable.
[27:23.560 --> 27:26.200]  And that's kind of why we named part of the show about that
[27:26.200 --> 27:27.360]  is building out your stable.
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.120]  You need stable genetics,
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.680]  horses, the thoroughbreds, if you will,
[27:31.680 --> 27:32.880]  that are gonna carry you through
[27:32.880 --> 27:34.440]  that you know can pay the bill
[27:34.440 --> 27:36.440]  so that eventually you can get to the point
[27:36.440 --> 27:38.680]  where you start to play around with a lot of stuff.
[27:38.680 --> 27:40.400]  But if you pheno hunt from day one
[27:41.160 --> 27:43.040]  and the facility is too big, in my opinion,
[27:43.040 --> 27:45.040]  you might shoot yourself in the foot
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.000]  because you just don't know
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.240]  how those crops are gonna produce.
[27:48.240 --> 27:50.600]  So that was something else that I wanted to talk about
[27:50.600 --> 27:51.600]  on a grander scale
[27:51.600 --> 27:54.080]  that I don't think a lot of people think about at first.
[27:54.080 --> 27:56.900]  Yes, everything that you just said, amen.
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.800]  Commercial growers worldwide,
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.240]  please turn up your volume right now
[28:03.240 --> 28:05.520]  and listen to what I have to say.
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.520]  Do not pheno hunt in your commercial facility.
[28:11.320 --> 28:14.200]  Please stop doing that, period.
[28:14.200 --> 28:17.560]  Create your own pheno hunt facility.
[28:17.560 --> 28:19.640]  Have a stable.
[28:19.640 --> 28:22.140]  When we're talking about a commercial facility,
[28:22.140 --> 28:23.800]  we're talking about something that needs
[28:23.800 --> 28:26.840]  to be able to pay the bills of the business.
[28:26.840 --> 28:30.760]  It's like this is not like a section
[28:30.760 --> 28:32.200]  that really is up for debate.
[28:32.720 --> 28:35.920]  And at the end of the day,
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.840]  one of the hardest things that you can do on yourself
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.980]  is try and pheno hunt in that big room.
[28:42.980 --> 28:45.560]  Now, is it fun in some ways?
[28:45.560 --> 28:46.880]  Yeah, sure it is.
[28:46.880 --> 28:47.920]  It's really cool.
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.360]  You get to see a whole bunch of big plants.
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.120]  But that is probably the dumbest business decision
[28:54.120 --> 28:56.960]  you can possibly make in commercial growing.
[28:56.960 --> 28:59.480]  And I see it all the time.
[28:59.480 --> 29:01.680]  And as a seed breeder,
[29:02.160 --> 29:03.200]  it's one of those things where it's like,
[29:03.200 --> 29:04.800]  yes, I want you to take my seeds.
[29:04.800 --> 29:06.200]  And yes, I want you to run them out
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.320]  in your commercial facility.
[29:07.320 --> 29:09.560]  But no, I do not want you to do it that way.
[29:10.920 --> 29:12.840]  Because at the end of the day,
[29:12.840 --> 29:16.200]  one, when you're going through 1,000 plants,
[29:16.200 --> 29:19.100]  even if it's 1,000 of the same strain,
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000]  it is so difficult to hold on to all of the genetic material
[29:25.400 --> 29:28.000]  between one generation to the next.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.920]  And then to be able to consume
[29:30.920 --> 29:32.260]  the amount that you would need
[29:32.260 --> 29:35.040]  to be able to adequately judge whether or not
[29:35.040 --> 29:37.040]  there's a real difference between the two
[29:38.680 --> 29:40.700]  is also just a tremendous ask.
[29:41.640 --> 29:44.500]  So if you are in a commercial facility
[29:44.500 --> 29:47.080]  and you have one strain that you can run out
[29:47.080 --> 29:48.760]  while you are doing pheno hunts
[29:48.760 --> 29:52.160]  to find your new best thing, great.
[29:52.160 --> 29:53.000]  That's awesome.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.520]  That's the beginning of your stable.
[29:54.520 --> 29:59.040]  That's where you start the races from.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.480]  Because at the end of the day,
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.520]  that's what keeps you able to be in the market.
[30:03.520 --> 30:08.280]  And yeah, Blue Dream did that for a lot of people.
[30:08.280 --> 30:10.280]  For a lot of people.
[30:10.280 --> 30:13.360]  AK-47 did that for a lot of people.
[30:13.360 --> 30:15.560]  Do you know how many strains were able to be developed
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.100]  because AK-47 paid the bills?
[30:20.320 --> 30:22.520]  The reality is that when you're looking at this
[30:22.520 --> 30:24.940]  from a total commercial standpoint,
[30:25.780 --> 30:30.780]  you can provide better medicine to your end customer.
[30:30.980 --> 30:34.540]  You can provide a better life for yourself.
[30:34.540 --> 30:38.060]  And you can provide better flower just in general
[30:38.060 --> 30:40.460]  if you understand that your commercial room
[30:40.460 --> 30:41.940]  is your commercial room.
[30:41.940 --> 30:46.140]  And it needs to be kept to a limited number of strains.
[30:46.140 --> 30:48.660]  And those strains need to like the same thing.
[30:49.560 --> 30:53.740]  And the best way that you can possibly scale craft
[30:53.740 --> 30:58.740]  is to try and scale by creating small spaces
[30:59.940 --> 31:04.740]  that can be individual for the way
[31:04.740 --> 31:07.460]  that the plant needs to be supported.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.700]  Because at the end of the day,
[31:09.700 --> 31:13.000]  AK-47 doesn't need the same thing that Neville's Haze does.
[31:13.920 --> 31:16.360]  And it's not gonna thrive in the same room
[31:16.360 --> 31:18.300]  that Neville's Haze is gonna thrive in.
[31:19.540 --> 31:22.140]  And actually Neville's Haze is probably not gonna thrive
[31:22.140 --> 31:23.700]  in a room at all.
[31:24.540 --> 31:26.340]  It's gonna do real good in a greenhouse or outside,
[31:26.340 --> 31:28.980]  but it struggles indoors.
[31:28.980 --> 31:32.980]  So when we're looking at how to create a stable,
[31:34.980 --> 31:37.380]  that's where what we were talking about
[31:37.380 --> 31:40.100]  before I got cut off with Marco's question
[31:40.100 --> 31:42.420]  of how do you pheno-hunt?
[31:42.420 --> 31:44.340]  I think that's the very first question
[31:44.340 --> 31:46.340]  that you need to ask when you're going into this
[31:46.340 --> 31:47.620]  as a commercial grower is,
[31:47.620 --> 31:49.500]  okay, what am I gonna grow right now?
[31:49.500 --> 31:52.780]  What can I grow that's good enough to get me through
[31:52.780 --> 31:54.500]  till I do the next thing?
[31:55.780 --> 32:00.780]  Because there's sort of a weird dichotomy here, right?
[32:01.300 --> 32:02.860]  It's a double-edged sword.
[32:02.860 --> 32:07.420]  We're in a situation where you need to be able
[32:07.420 --> 32:09.420]  to have a stable, but you need to be able
[32:09.420 --> 32:11.320]  to have a stable that's unique to you.
[32:12.700 --> 32:15.900]  Because if everybody is growing Gorilla Glue,
[32:15.900 --> 32:18.980]  and it can be anything, if everybody's growing Blue Dream,
[32:18.980 --> 32:21.260]  or everybody's growing cookies or whatever,
[32:21.260 --> 32:23.220]  then we're racing to the bottom.
[32:25.020 --> 32:28.220]  It's who can produce the cookies or the Blue Dream
[32:28.220 --> 32:30.140]  or the Gorilla Glue the cheapest,
[32:31.380 --> 32:34.020]  and get it to the end user the cheapest,
[32:34.020 --> 32:35.740]  the best quality at the cheapest.
[32:36.780 --> 32:39.940]  So in a commercial standpoint,
[32:39.940 --> 32:41.980]  it's really important for you to be able
[32:41.980 --> 32:45.080]  to differentiate yourself in some way.
[32:45.920 --> 32:50.920]  And if you're a dispensary, or you're a rosin maker,
[32:51.480 --> 32:56.480]  or you're a grower, and you're coming with the same thing
[32:57.040 --> 32:59.200]  that everybody else is coming to the table with,
[32:59.200 --> 33:02.800]  then you're either going to differentiate yourself
[33:02.800 --> 33:04.880]  with quality, or you're gonna differentiate yourself
[33:04.880 --> 33:06.520]  with price.
[33:06.520 --> 33:09.120]  But if you can have something that's totally unique,
[33:10.080 --> 33:14.620]  if everybody is giving you gas and you can bring fruit,
[33:14.620 --> 33:18.500]  then suddenly you might have a niche of the market
[33:18.500 --> 33:23.500]  that is going to come and shop directly with you only,
[33:23.740 --> 33:26.740]  because you're providing them the need that they want.
[33:28.140 --> 33:31.140]  And as a breeder, it's really interesting
[33:31.140 --> 33:34.300]  because when I started this whole thing,
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.120]  it was all about what I liked.
[33:37.340 --> 33:41.460]  And I have a pretty diverse palette for this plant,
[33:41.500 --> 33:46.420]  but at the beginning, it really was all about the things
[33:46.420 --> 33:47.900]  that I was hyped on at the time,
[33:47.900 --> 33:50.140]  and trying to make them better and whatnot.
[33:51.100 --> 33:52.780]  But over time, one of the things
[33:52.780 --> 33:54.900]  that has been really interesting,
[33:54.900 --> 33:57.660]  as more people have been able to grow out the strains,
[33:57.660 --> 34:00.180]  as more people have been able to use them as medicine
[34:00.180 --> 34:02.140]  and give us feedback,
[34:02.140 --> 34:06.300]  then in places that I didn't understand
[34:06.300 --> 34:08.380]  were really important,
[34:08.380 --> 34:10.340]  things have shown up as really important.
[34:10.660 --> 34:13.060]  For example, I have the sex grenade strain,
[34:14.220 --> 34:17.580]  which is lemon G times Dr. Hoffman.
[34:17.580 --> 34:21.380]  And Dr. Hoffman is one of the first strains that I made
[34:21.380 --> 34:22.900]  and then started stabilizing.
[34:22.900 --> 34:27.500]  And it's acid from paradise seeds, I believe,
[34:27.500 --> 34:32.500]  in Amsterdam, and sour peas from La Plata Labs in Denver.
[34:33.260 --> 34:38.260]  And the La Plata Labs sour peas mail that I found
[34:41.740 --> 34:44.860]  just really stood out at the time.
[34:44.860 --> 34:47.580]  And it was one of those things where,
[34:47.580 --> 34:49.300]  it was kind of like what Marco was talking about.
[34:49.300 --> 34:52.220]  He had a couple of really good dudes
[34:52.220 --> 34:53.380]  and he wanted to try something.
[34:53.380 --> 34:55.780]  Well, that's where I was too.
[34:55.780 --> 34:58.100]  I found something that really stood out
[34:58.100 --> 35:00.820]  in the hundreds of seeds that I'd been popping.
[35:00.820 --> 35:04.420]  And I wanted to see what the next step was.
[35:04.420 --> 35:06.420]  And the next step ended up being pretty good.
[35:06.420 --> 35:09.820]  And then we kept working down the line.
[35:09.820 --> 35:11.780]  But anyway, the point that I brought up with this
[35:11.780 --> 35:15.380]  is that that was one of the first strains that I made
[35:15.380 --> 35:17.260]  where the feedback that I got from it
[35:17.260 --> 35:20.500]  was that it was really helping people medically.
[35:20.500 --> 35:23.380]  Where there was something that was different about it
[35:23.380 --> 35:25.100]  than every other strain
[35:25.100 --> 35:27.260]  that was on the shelves of the dispensary.
[35:27.700 --> 35:32.700]  And more than any other strain that I've released,
[35:32.780 --> 35:36.380]  that one has been one that people have come back to me
[35:36.380 --> 35:39.380]  routinely to tell me that it is medicinally
[35:39.380 --> 35:41.740]  incredibly beneficial to them.
[35:41.740 --> 35:44.540]  And this is a place where like my flavor profile
[35:44.540 --> 35:47.100]  doesn't really match that one anymore.
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.420]  It's not something that like I really enjoy smoking,
[35:50.420 --> 35:53.180]  but we will make it forever
[35:53.180 --> 35:55.380]  because of how much it has helped people.
[35:55.420 --> 36:00.420]  And I want to continue working lines
[36:00.500 --> 36:03.460]  with whatever it is that's in it that is doing that.
[36:03.460 --> 36:06.700]  And so like that sparked a whole new level of interest
[36:06.700 --> 36:08.460]  in the plant for me,
[36:08.460 --> 36:11.060]  because there's something else happening with that strain
[36:11.060 --> 36:13.620]  that isn't happening with some of the other ones.
[36:13.620 --> 36:16.020]  And so to have that feedback,
[36:16.020 --> 36:18.420]  it made me look at it from a different angle,
[36:18.420 --> 36:20.620]  a different perspective, I suppose.
[36:20.620 --> 36:25.620]  And that has made the whole journey of breeding
[36:27.060 --> 36:30.020]  so interesting because originally
[36:30.020 --> 36:31.580]  it was all about getting high
[36:31.580 --> 36:35.380]  and just the mental benefits that come from that
[36:35.380 --> 36:40.380]  and the joys of being able to have that community
[36:41.180 --> 36:42.580]  and whatnot.
[36:42.580 --> 36:46.420]  But over the period of time with different selection
[36:46.420 --> 36:48.100]  and different breeding,
[36:48.100 --> 36:49.700]  it's been about a lot more than that
[36:49.700 --> 36:51.580]  because I've seen how much it helps people
[36:51.580 --> 36:52.940]  for different stuff.
[36:52.940 --> 36:56.140]  And some of it is just the mental part of it.
[36:56.140 --> 36:57.780]  Having a strain that's real mellow
[36:57.780 --> 36:59.100]  that people can smoke all day,
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.980]  that really takes that edge off
[37:02.980 --> 37:05.980]  and allows them to function at a higher level.
[37:08.060 --> 37:09.860]  That's a hundred percent good to me.
[37:10.700 --> 37:13.580]  I don't see that as any part bad.
[37:13.580 --> 37:18.580]  So you can value the different effects from this plant
[37:19.420 --> 37:21.380]  in a lot of different ways.
[37:21.380 --> 37:22.700]  And from what I've seen,
[37:22.700 --> 37:26.060]  a lot of people have different values
[37:26.060 --> 37:28.940]  for how it interacts with their lives.
[37:28.940 --> 37:33.140]  So as I get that feedback,
[37:33.140 --> 37:36.340]  another thing that has become real interesting is like,
[37:36.340 --> 37:38.420]  well, how do I continue to breed for this?
[37:38.420 --> 37:40.260]  How do I select for these things
[37:40.260 --> 37:43.740]  that I didn't know six years ago were a thing at all?
[37:45.420 --> 37:46.660]  So.
[37:46.660 --> 37:47.580]  Nice.
[37:47.580 --> 37:49.340]  Yeah, man, great info.
[37:49.340 --> 37:51.100]  But getting back to the males a little bit.
[37:51.100 --> 37:53.700]  So I have some scenario we can walk through.
[37:54.780 --> 37:58.020]  I had three males, same strain.
[37:58.020 --> 37:58.860]  This is from-
[37:58.860 --> 37:59.900]  Are y'all-
[37:59.900 --> 38:01.140]  Yep, same strain.
[38:01.140 --> 38:03.100]  Mendo Breath from King J.
[38:03.100 --> 38:05.460]  He sent me some seeds to run through,
[38:05.460 --> 38:08.180]  help him select some things or whatever.
[38:08.180 --> 38:10.940]  So I run those, kept the three males.
[38:10.940 --> 38:12.940]  One was just kind of, okay,
[38:12.940 --> 38:15.860]  you know this one doesn't look good, not the one.
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.580]  So kind of just toss that one out.
[38:17.580 --> 38:19.460]  No stem rub either.
[38:19.460 --> 38:22.420]  The other two, one has a little more stem rub.
[38:22.420 --> 38:26.780]  And then that one is also has like longer nodes spacing,
[38:26.780 --> 38:27.620]  if that matters.
[38:27.620 --> 38:30.620]  They're both very beautiful males, if you will.
[38:30.620 --> 38:32.300]  But one's kind of the,
[38:32.300 --> 38:34.580]  it's very tighter node space and one's longer,
[38:34.580 --> 38:35.980]  but they both look good.
[38:35.980 --> 38:38.980]  Would you keep those separate
[38:38.980 --> 38:40.620]  or go ahead and just collect it together
[38:40.620 --> 38:43.420]  as my Mendo Breath pollen and use it down the road?
[38:43.420 --> 38:46.540]  Is it that finite to look at it that way?
[38:47.620 --> 38:50.860]  No, well, all right.
[38:50.860 --> 38:54.340]  Man, that is such an incredibly hard question to answer.
[38:54.340 --> 38:55.180]  I know, man.
[38:55.180 --> 38:58.100]  Those are the kind of questions that I have for myself
[38:58.100 --> 38:59.660]  as I'm living.
[38:59.660 --> 39:01.980]  You're gonna get a great answer to it, trust me.
[39:01.980 --> 39:02.820]  All right.
[39:02.820 --> 39:07.300]  But there's nuances to it, you know?
[39:08.420 --> 39:10.820]  Okay, so the first question that I have
[39:10.820 --> 39:12.940]  in order to answer this question
[39:13.740 --> 39:15.180]  is did you run the girls out?
[39:16.020 --> 39:18.700]  The girls are currently running.
[39:18.700 --> 39:22.100]  They're at like, I'm just badging right now.
[39:22.100 --> 39:23.380]  They're just badging.
[39:23.380 --> 39:28.380]  Okay, so one of the easiest ways to select a male
[39:29.700 --> 39:31.180]  is to select a female.
[39:32.860 --> 39:35.660]  So if when you run out all of your girls,
[39:36.580 --> 39:40.180]  and granted everybody out there PSA,
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.900]  this doesn't always work.
[39:41.900 --> 39:44.020]  But as a general rule,
[39:45.100 --> 39:46.780]  if you run out all of your girls
[39:46.780 --> 39:49.820]  and you find girls that you really like,
[39:49.820 --> 39:53.700]  and you can look at the growth traits of them,
[39:53.700 --> 39:55.660]  you can look at the serration of their leaves,
[39:55.660 --> 39:57.140]  you can look at the stem rub,
[39:57.140 --> 40:02.140]  you can look at the width of the stalk itself,
[40:02.260 --> 40:05.060]  you can look at whether or not the stalk is hollow,
[40:05.060 --> 40:07.780]  you can look at the lateral branching,
[40:07.780 --> 40:12.660]  you can look at the flower structure eventually,
[40:12.660 --> 40:14.100]  both male and female.
[40:15.180 --> 40:16.020]  And you can-
[40:16.020 --> 40:17.060]  Let me stop you there, Robby.
[40:17.060 --> 40:19.860]  Do you care if the stems are hollow?
[40:19.860 --> 40:21.340]  Let's go back to that right quick.
[40:21.340 --> 40:22.180]  Okay, break that down a little bit.
[40:22.180 --> 40:24.300]  Yeah, that is the thing I select for.
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.860]  Because in the seed stage,
[40:30.260 --> 40:32.940]  when you are sort of,
[40:33.860 --> 40:35.620]  you're looking for vigorous growth,
[40:36.620 --> 40:41.300]  and having hollow stems in a commercial clone stage
[40:41.300 --> 40:45.940]  is not actually a very good thing per se.
[40:45.940 --> 40:47.380]  There's a level to where it's good,
[40:47.380 --> 40:49.700]  but then after that it's not anymore.
[40:50.700 --> 40:54.220]  But during the seed phase,
[40:54.220 --> 40:56.660]  one of the things that I'm looking for is vigor
[40:56.660 --> 40:59.700]  in the seed itself.
[40:59.700 --> 41:01.180]  And so when you see that,
[41:01.180 --> 41:02.980]  that means that the plant is growing faster
[41:03.140 --> 41:05.700]  than it can kind of keep up with.
[41:07.060 --> 41:10.820]  And so that's a sign of just amazing vigor in the plant.
[41:10.820 --> 41:12.500]  Well, let me stop you there then,
[41:12.500 --> 41:16.660]  because genome alchemies fantasia, girls.
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.340]  Remember, Brian, I was saying they're growing
[41:18.340 --> 41:19.940]  like they're in hydro.
[41:19.940 --> 41:22.820]  Like they're literally stems like that.
[41:22.820 --> 41:25.980]  And when I went to do some LST and squeeze them,
[41:25.980 --> 41:27.940]  I'm like, damn, they're hollow as hell.
[41:27.940 --> 41:30.100]  Like it was literally like that hydro.
[41:30.100 --> 41:30.940]  So that's dope, man.
[41:30.940 --> 41:34.060]  So that there reinforces again, good genetics.
[41:35.060 --> 41:37.340]  Yeah, so the reason that I'm looking for vigor
[41:37.340 --> 41:39.580]  and I'm looking for that in the seed generation
[41:39.580 --> 41:43.020]  is because when I take this to a clone generation,
[41:43.020 --> 41:46.300]  it's going into either my commercial or my home grow.
[41:46.300 --> 41:49.620]  It's something that I'm gonna rely on one way or the other.
[41:49.620 --> 41:51.660]  And if it's weak from the beginning,
[41:51.660 --> 41:53.180]  it's gonna be weak as a clone,
[41:53.180 --> 41:54.220]  and then it's gonna be weak
[41:54.220 --> 41:58.060]  in every aspect of its life afterwards.
[41:58.220 --> 42:03.060]  Like bugs, mildew, HPLVD,
[42:03.060 --> 42:06.020]  all these things are going to attack a weak plant
[42:06.020 --> 42:09.260]  faster than they're going to attack a vigorous plant.
[42:11.260 --> 42:12.500]  Pythium, same thing.
[42:12.500 --> 42:15.980]  So like whenever you look at a lot of the common problems
[42:15.980 --> 42:18.100]  that you have as a grower, part of it,
[42:21.340 --> 42:25.580]  is that your genetics are weak and you didn't select well.
[42:25.620 --> 42:29.100]  And that's because nobody teaches this stuff.
[42:29.100 --> 42:30.820]  So let's teach some people.
[42:30.820 --> 42:34.140]  Guys, when you are selecting,
[42:34.140 --> 42:36.740]  look for the plant that is going to be strong.
[42:36.740 --> 42:39.380]  Put it into bad situations,
[42:39.380 --> 42:42.020]  because if it survives a bad situation
[42:42.020 --> 42:43.900]  and still comes out really good,
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.140]  then at the end of the time,
[42:45.140 --> 42:46.660]  you're always gonna have medicine,
[42:46.660 --> 42:48.820]  either for you or for your customers.
[42:50.340 --> 42:52.220]  You know, like if you can get through
[42:52.220 --> 42:54.820]  and not feed something for 10 days
[42:54.860 --> 42:58.820]  and everything else is dead, but that plant is alive,
[42:58.820 --> 43:01.740]  that plant has something special.
[43:01.740 --> 43:05.020]  You know, so like it really matters.
[43:05.020 --> 43:06.060]  That tough love.
[43:07.340 --> 43:08.260]  Yeah, no, it is.
[43:08.260 --> 43:09.220]  It is tough love.
[43:09.220 --> 43:14.220]  And you know, I tend to reference my buddy, Duke Diamond,
[43:15.460 --> 43:16.580]  on these shows a lot,
[43:16.580 --> 43:18.380]  because he's one of the only other people
[43:18.380 --> 43:20.260]  that I've seen do this.
[43:20.260 --> 43:21.660]  And I'm not saying other people don't,
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.980]  it's just I've seen him do this.
[43:23.980 --> 43:26.540]  You know, and it really like put a lot of things
[43:26.540 --> 43:27.740]  into perspective for me,
[43:27.740 --> 43:31.780]  but I've seen him go through like extended days
[43:31.780 --> 43:33.660]  or periods of time with no water
[43:33.660 --> 43:35.900]  to see which plant could handle it.
[43:35.900 --> 43:37.980]  You know, and that made me really think about it
[43:37.980 --> 43:40.700]  like as an earlier breeder,
[43:41.820 --> 43:43.940]  of well, what am I looking for here?
[43:43.940 --> 43:45.780]  You know, like do I want something
[43:45.780 --> 43:48.180]  that if I baby it the whole time, it's gonna be awesome?
[43:48.180 --> 43:50.020]  Or do I want something that's gonna be awesome
[43:50.020 --> 43:51.660]  if I treat it like shit,
[43:51.660 --> 43:55.220]  and then really awesome if I baby it the whole time?
[43:55.220 --> 43:57.400]  And normally my answer is number two.
[43:58.420 --> 43:59.260]  Yeah.
[44:00.180 --> 44:01.860]  It's gonna be stronger for longer.
[44:01.860 --> 44:02.700]  You know what I mean?
[44:02.700 --> 44:04.100]  Same way we talk about the soil.
[44:04.100 --> 44:04.940]  You know what I mean?
[44:04.940 --> 44:05.900]  We want that strong,
[44:05.900 --> 44:08.980]  those microbes in our soil that can survive that.
[44:08.980 --> 44:10.740]  You want plants that can survive that too.
[44:10.740 --> 44:14.580]  And when you have both microbes and plant surviving
[44:14.580 --> 44:17.380]  and thriving, you have a great system.
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.100]  So that's why it is big, man.
[44:19.100 --> 44:20.860]  Like you said, select for yourself.
[44:20.860 --> 44:22.140]  You know what I mean?
[44:22.140 --> 44:26.260]  And I have noticed, you know, I noticed your phenos.
[44:26.260 --> 44:27.820]  You know, I noticed what these,
[44:27.820 --> 44:32.540]  I did 20 of the Mendelicious
[44:32.540 --> 44:37.260]  and ended up right now down to 15 females,
[44:37.260 --> 44:39.020]  but I'm seeing three distinct phenos.
[44:39.020 --> 44:42.340]  I'm seeing ones with like that cross leaf pattern
[44:42.340 --> 44:45.900]  where like the fans kind of do overlap almost,
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.660]  ones closer to the top.
[44:47.660 --> 44:50.060]  Seeing one is what just a traditional kind of,
[44:50.060 --> 44:51.580]  you know, sativa look,
[44:51.580 --> 44:54.620]  kind of that long kind of wide open look.
[44:54.620 --> 44:56.820]  And then one that just kind of looks a little squatty,
[44:56.820 --> 44:58.340]  you know, out of those three.
[44:58.340 --> 45:02.780]  My males both look kind of that sativa-ish, if you will.
[45:02.780 --> 45:06.340]  So maybe that may be what I'm looking for then,
[45:06.340 --> 45:08.060]  you know, as I go, you know what I mean?
[45:08.060 --> 45:10.460]  Or maybe I get benefit by crossing the shorty
[45:10.460 --> 45:12.380]  with the long, you know.
[45:12.380 --> 45:14.780]  Well, and that comes back to the second question is,
[45:14.780 --> 45:17.060]  you know, like what is the goal as a breeder, right?
[45:17.060 --> 45:22.060]  So if you get to the end of your girl cycle and you say,
[45:22.180 --> 45:24.900]  okay, I have this girl that's short and stout
[45:24.900 --> 45:27.660]  and she's awesome, but she doesn't produce the sativa-like
[45:27.660 --> 45:29.940]  high that I love from this strain,
[45:29.940 --> 45:34.220]  then breeding something that is tall and lanky
[45:34.220 --> 45:36.940]  and has long, thin sativa leaves with her
[45:36.940 --> 45:40.740]  is going to give you the possibility of the next generation
[45:40.740 --> 45:42.340]  of that being a dominant trait.
[45:42.940 --> 45:47.260]  And so then you have the opportunity to select again,
[45:47.260 --> 45:52.260]  and maybe this time you get the pheno that you wanted.
[45:52.780 --> 45:55.940]  And something that you also mentioned
[45:55.940 --> 45:58.380]  about putting the two pollens together
[45:58.380 --> 46:01.060]  and then going back with that,
[46:01.060 --> 46:06.060]  I think that that is a incredibly useful technique
[46:06.100 --> 46:08.380]  for seed expansion.
[46:08.380 --> 46:12.300]  So if say you have 10 Mindo perp seeds
[46:12.300 --> 46:14.140]  or Mindo breath seeds,
[46:14.140 --> 46:17.500]  but you want to be able to look through a thousand of them,
[46:17.500 --> 46:22.500]  if you take the pollen from the two male plants
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.220]  and you dust it on all of your girl plants
[46:25.220 --> 46:27.500]  and then you put all those seeds together,
[46:27.500 --> 46:29.020]  now you have an expression,
[46:29.020 --> 46:32.220]  or you have a possible expression of basically everything.
[46:32.220 --> 46:34.580]  You know, like you took all the possible expressions
[46:34.580 --> 46:36.100]  from all the things in your 10-pack
[46:36.100 --> 46:39.100]  and you expanded them to be able to look through them again.
[46:40.140 --> 46:42.820]  So you're not selectively breeding,
[46:42.820 --> 46:45.740]  but what you are doing is giving yourself the opportunity
[46:45.740 --> 46:49.620]  to selectively breed in a way that you may not have had
[46:49.620 --> 46:52.000]  in the 10-pack in the first place.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.380]  And so something that I have done
[46:54.380 --> 46:57.020]  is I've gotten to be a better breeder
[46:57.020 --> 46:59.380]  or a better selector maybe,
[46:59.380 --> 47:03.940]  is that I very rarely open anybody else's packs
[47:03.980 --> 47:06.220]  unless I'm going to do a seed expansion on them
[47:06.220 --> 47:09.100]  and I'm going to do a second generation
[47:09.100 --> 47:13.500]  of looking through to see what all is actually in that pheno.
[47:13.500 --> 47:16.140]  Because I can see so much from five seeds,
[47:16.140 --> 47:18.420]  but what I can see out of a hundred of them
[47:18.420 --> 47:22.340]  is a completely different spectrum of what's available.
[47:22.340 --> 47:24.620]  And something else that's really interesting
[47:24.620 --> 47:28.940]  is that when you look at regular male-female seeds
[47:28.940 --> 47:32.100]  versus when you look at feminized seeds,
[47:32.100 --> 47:37.100]  you see different ratios of possible phenotypes.
[47:37.380 --> 47:39.700]  When you're looking at feminized seeds,
[47:39.700 --> 47:41.340]  even if it's a feminized cross,
[47:41.340 --> 47:44.420]  like let's say I took the pollen from Nendo breath
[47:44.420 --> 47:49.420]  and I put it on to Girl Scout cookies,
[47:51.100 --> 47:53.660]  the phenos that would come out of that,
[47:53.660 --> 47:55.700]  if it was a male-female cross,
[47:56.500 --> 48:01.500]  would probably, you end up seeing a lot more phenotypes
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.540]  than you do out of feminized cross.
[48:03.540 --> 48:07.460]  And my guess for that is that
[48:07.460 --> 48:10.220]  because you're eliminating the Y genome
[48:10.220 --> 48:14.140]  from the cross itself and the breeding,
[48:14.140 --> 48:19.140]  that you're only working with the aspects of the plant
[48:21.100 --> 48:24.140]  that are connected to the X chromosome.
[48:24.140 --> 48:28.620]  So that just means that there's less options.
[48:28.620 --> 48:30.300]  You know, like the different traits
[48:30.300 --> 48:32.100]  that are attached to the X chromosome
[48:32.100 --> 48:35.500]  are going to be what vary within your feminized cross.
[48:36.380 --> 48:39.340]  But in a male-female cross,
[48:39.340 --> 48:41.620]  you have the ability to have traits
[48:41.620 --> 48:43.380]  that vary across the Y chromosome
[48:43.380 --> 48:46.220]  and traits that are carried on the X chromosome.
[48:46.220 --> 48:50.180]  So you end up just seeing like a bigger,
[48:50.180 --> 48:53.340]  you see more colors of the rainbow, I suppose,
[48:53.340 --> 48:54.740]  you know, in a regular cross
[48:54.740 --> 48:56.380]  than you do in a feminized cross.
[48:56.420 --> 49:00.620]  So how you select from the seeds that you're popping
[49:00.620 --> 49:03.420]  can be determined by that.
[49:03.420 --> 49:06.940]  I mean, like you can run a lot less feminized seeds
[49:06.940 --> 49:09.140]  in order to find the three or four phenos
[49:09.140 --> 49:10.900]  that you might find out of it
[49:10.900 --> 49:13.980]  than you would running out the same number
[49:13.980 --> 49:16.580]  of male-female seeds, right?
[49:20.740 --> 49:21.820]  Yeah, hell of a good answer.
[49:21.820 --> 49:24.820]  So what I think, so using your answer
[49:24.820 --> 49:26.540]  and then what I've already been thinking,
[49:26.540 --> 49:29.780]  so I'm gonna take these males,
[49:29.780 --> 49:31.340]  I'm gonna collect some pollen.
[49:31.340 --> 49:34.580]  The ladies that are running right now,
[49:34.580 --> 49:37.660]  I was gonna touch the lowers on a few of them.
[49:38.660 --> 49:40.540]  I was gonna touch the lowers on, you know,
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.900]  hit them with a little bit of that male pollen,
[49:42.900 --> 49:44.340]  then work through them
[49:44.340 --> 49:47.380]  and then rework through those seeds that I get.
[49:47.380 --> 49:48.780]  It looks like he dipped out.
[49:48.780 --> 49:50.620]  Yeah, I was just gonna-
[49:50.620 --> 49:52.540]  What a hell of a snapshot.
[49:52.540 --> 49:54.820]  And I didn't wanna interrupt your thought process,
[49:54.820 --> 49:56.780]  but hopefully he'll pop back on here.
[49:56.780 --> 49:57.620]  He'll come back.
[49:57.620 --> 49:59.980]  But yeah, this is the kind of stuff I need, Brian.
[49:59.980 --> 50:02.740]  Like, you know, when we get into certain things
[50:02.740 --> 50:04.820]  at certain levels, it's hard to just, you know,
[50:04.820 --> 50:08.020]  you don't just go Googling certain questions
[50:08.020 --> 50:10.420]  because you know you're not gonna get what you wanna,
[50:10.420 --> 50:12.140]  you know, you're not gonna get to the right spot.
[50:12.140 --> 50:14.620]  So having somebody with the experience,
[50:14.620 --> 50:15.980]  to me, man, is vital.
[50:15.980 --> 50:17.900]  Like if you guys got questions,
[50:17.900 --> 50:19.820]  y'all need to get them in the joint now
[50:19.860 --> 50:23.020]  because, you know, someone with experience,
[50:23.020 --> 50:23.860]  you know what I mean?
[50:23.860 --> 50:26.460]  I've seen some of the big, even some,
[50:26.460 --> 50:28.140]  it looks like he might be coming back.
[50:28.140 --> 50:30.260]  Everybody's stuff isn't great, y'all.
[50:30.260 --> 50:31.620]  I mean, it might look great.
[50:31.620 --> 50:32.700]  And what he said earlier
[50:32.700 --> 50:35.220]  about actually having to go through everything,
[50:35.220 --> 50:37.980]  you gotta try all the plants to know what's good.
[50:37.980 --> 50:40.620]  You can't just say this one looks and smells,
[50:40.620 --> 50:41.900]  you know, like donuts.
[50:41.900 --> 50:44.060]  So we're gonna call it donuts and put it out there.
[50:44.060 --> 50:46.060]  Like it's got to burn like donuts too.
[50:46.060 --> 50:48.100]  It's gotta have that taste, you know what I mean?
[50:48.100 --> 50:48.940]  At the end.
[50:49.580 --> 50:52.180]  So, you know, this is good stuff.
[50:54.140 --> 50:55.660]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[50:59.260 --> 51:00.220]  That's all right.
[51:00.220 --> 51:01.820]  We were just talking about like,
[51:05.660 --> 51:08.380]  we're just talking about the genetics that you're,
[51:08.380 --> 51:11.420]  you know, I think more people are starting to realize,
[51:11.420 --> 51:13.580]  you know, the work that you put in.
[51:13.580 --> 51:14.740]  You're a humble individual.
[51:14.740 --> 51:17.460]  So I'm gonna brag on you for a minute.
[51:17.500 --> 51:21.300]  The Grow Off has decided the last two times
[51:21.300 --> 51:24.900]  to choose your genetics because of how stable they are.
[51:24.900 --> 51:25.940]  You know, I'm on the,
[51:25.940 --> 51:28.340]  Marco and I are on the outside looking in on the Grow Off.
[51:28.340 --> 51:29.900]  We don't necessarily know how that works.
[51:29.900 --> 51:32.220]  But from the way I understand it,
[51:32.220 --> 51:34.900]  everybody gets to pick, well, not everybody.
[51:34.900 --> 51:37.340]  Okay, so the Grow Off picks your genetics
[51:37.340 --> 51:40.380]  and then everybody gets to pick their growing style
[51:40.380 --> 51:42.460]  of how they wanna grow those genetics.
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.780]  And whoever grows those genetics in the best way
[51:45.500 --> 51:47.820]  that little community kind of judges,
[51:47.820 --> 51:49.660]  you know, they're the winner of the Grow Off.
[51:49.660 --> 51:51.540]  And so for you to be picked two times,
[51:51.540 --> 51:54.420]  and I believe I also heard that you're picked again
[51:54.420 --> 51:57.860]  for 2023, I wanted to talk about that for a minute
[51:57.860 --> 51:59.540]  so that a lot of individuals can realize
[51:59.540 --> 52:01.140]  that there's a reason why your genetics
[52:01.140 --> 52:04.180]  have been tried and true for individuals like MJ
[52:04.180 --> 52:06.540]  and kind of the UGKs of the world,
[52:06.540 --> 52:08.820]  putting, you know, putting real work into stuff,
[52:08.820 --> 52:12.740]  never having any of the accoutrement, if you will,
[52:12.860 --> 52:15.220]  of social media, for most of them,
[52:15.220 --> 52:16.700]  they could care less about it,
[52:16.700 --> 52:18.460]  but you're the one putting in that real work.
[52:18.460 --> 52:20.420]  And I think that's what most people realize
[52:20.420 --> 52:22.780]  is that the breeders are the ones putting in the real work.
[52:22.780 --> 52:24.500]  That's why you're able to answer the questions
[52:24.500 --> 52:27.060]  that Marco's been giving you on such a deep level
[52:27.060 --> 52:28.860]  because you're actually putting in the work
[52:28.860 --> 52:31.140]  where some of these breeders kind of just, you know,
[52:31.140 --> 52:32.860]  go through the motions, if you will.
[52:32.860 --> 52:34.420]  And I wanted to highlight that
[52:34.420 --> 52:35.580]  and let's get into the Grow Off.
[52:35.580 --> 52:37.420]  But I think more people need to realize
[52:37.420 --> 52:39.140]  where their genetics are coming from
[52:39.140 --> 52:41.980]  so that they have a better canvas for their own artwork.
[52:43.300 --> 52:48.100]  You know, I think that, thank you very much.
[52:48.100 --> 52:50.900]  We've worked real hard at this
[52:50.900 --> 52:54.940]  and it is something that I take a lot of pride in
[52:56.060 --> 53:00.660]  and that, you know, I've been lucky enough
[53:00.660 --> 53:05.580]  to be able to grow and really see this through
[53:05.580 --> 53:08.100]  in the way that I have on the scale
[53:08.100 --> 53:10.340]  that I've been able to see it through.
[53:10.340 --> 53:11.900]  And I think that's really cool.
[53:12.220 --> 53:15.100]  And so, you know, I'm real lucky to do it.
[53:15.100 --> 53:17.260]  And I just wanna say that, you know,
[53:17.260 --> 53:19.060]  I don't think necessarily that,
[53:23.340 --> 53:25.820]  I don't wanna believe that a lot of the breeders
[53:25.820 --> 53:29.300]  who are maybe not putting in some of the work
[53:29.300 --> 53:31.860]  are, is not because they,
[53:31.860 --> 53:33.940]  I just don't think that they're at the,
[53:33.940 --> 53:35.700]  I think there's different levels to this.
[53:35.700 --> 53:36.820]  That's what I wanna say.
[53:36.820 --> 53:41.140]  You know, I think that there is,
[53:41.180 --> 53:43.060]  and there's places for everybody
[53:43.060 --> 53:45.620]  to be in that different level.
[53:45.620 --> 53:47.020]  I want this to be something
[53:47.020 --> 53:48.460]  that's approachable to everybody.
[53:48.460 --> 53:51.500]  I don't want anybody in the world out there watching
[53:51.500 --> 53:54.220]  just to think that they can't breed a plant
[53:54.220 --> 53:55.900]  or that they can't be a breeder
[53:55.900 --> 53:58.660]  or they can't do any of this if they don't want to.
[53:58.660 --> 54:01.220]  They can absolutely do this.
[54:01.220 --> 54:02.540]  You absolutely can.
[54:02.540 --> 54:06.380]  Every one of you guys can do this if it's what you want.
[54:06.380 --> 54:08.820]  If it's something that you wanna put the time into
[54:08.820 --> 54:09.660]  and you wanna do it,
[54:09.660 --> 54:12.780]  you can take it to any level that you want to.
[54:12.780 --> 54:15.140]  The reason that we've been able to take it to the level
[54:15.140 --> 54:17.980]  or I've been able to take it to the level that I have
[54:17.980 --> 54:21.100]  is because I keep showing up and I keep doing it
[54:21.100 --> 54:24.340]  and I keep trying day after day
[54:24.340 --> 54:29.340]  and I keep accepting the failures with the successes.
[54:30.300 --> 54:35.300]  And I believe that as people keep doing this
[54:36.660 --> 54:38.500]  and that they see successes in it,
[54:38.540 --> 54:41.980]  then it's going to make them want to level up anyway.
[54:41.980 --> 54:44.100]  And that as a community,
[54:44.100 --> 54:49.100]  something that we can do is we can start to educate ourselves
[54:51.780 --> 54:56.780]  in a way that allows there to be a way
[55:00.860 --> 55:05.260]  for this work to be appreciated.
[55:05.300 --> 55:09.980]  Because right now, we're in a real weird place
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.020]  in the cannabis industry, the cannabis community,
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.700]  the cannabis world, where we're suddenly
[55:20.020 --> 55:22.740]  in a lot of places around the world
[55:22.740 --> 55:24.620]  being given access to this plant
[55:24.620 --> 55:28.420]  that has been held from us for a hundred years.
[55:29.340 --> 55:34.140]  And we're not being given education with that access.
[55:35.140 --> 55:38.740]  And one of the things that absolutely drives me crazy
[55:38.740 --> 55:42.620]  is that in every new state,
[55:44.300 --> 55:47.180]  there's all this brand new access to this,
[55:47.180 --> 55:50.300]  but there's nobody trying to, not nobody,
[55:50.300 --> 55:53.580]  but there's a lot less people than there should be
[55:53.580 --> 55:54.940]  trying to educate the people
[55:54.940 --> 55:56.820]  who are coming in to use this plant
[55:56.820 --> 55:59.100]  and who are coming in to try and receive
[55:59.100 --> 56:00.700]  the benefits of this plant.
[56:01.220 --> 56:04.140]  Partially because I think very few people
[56:04.140 --> 56:08.460]  have had the ability to be around it enough
[56:08.460 --> 56:12.500]  because of prohibition to really be able
[56:12.500 --> 56:13.860]  to make their own mind up.
[56:15.020 --> 56:17.260]  It's hard to go in and recommend something
[56:17.260 --> 56:19.740]  to somebody else if you don't know what you like.
[56:22.460 --> 56:26.860]  So I would like to see a lot more education
[56:26.860 --> 56:29.100]  being put into this plant
[56:29.620 --> 56:34.620]  and a lot more reward being put into the education of it.
[56:41.820 --> 56:46.820]  I think that there's a lot of value in people making F1s.
[56:47.140 --> 56:50.380]  And I think there's a lot of value in people making F10s.
[56:50.380 --> 56:51.860]  And I think there's a lot of value
[56:51.860 --> 56:53.860]  in people just growing the weed out.
[56:55.260 --> 56:57.100]  And I think there's a lot of value
[56:57.100 --> 56:59.780]  in people getting on profiles like this
[56:59.780 --> 57:03.220]  and talking about it and educating people
[57:03.220 --> 57:05.420]  and getting out there to talk about the things
[57:05.420 --> 57:07.980]  that actually matter in this industry.
[57:07.980 --> 57:11.900]  Because when you look at something as fragile as Instagram,
[57:13.500 --> 57:18.420]  I used to do digital marketing for a living, pre-weed.
[57:18.420 --> 57:23.420]  And we were able to grow accounts
[57:23.740 --> 57:26.700]  in a way that we will never be able to grow in weed
[57:27.300 --> 57:28.980]  because Instagram can shut us down.
[57:30.140 --> 57:32.460]  I grew my account to 17,000 followers
[57:32.460 --> 57:34.380]  and then got shut down the next day.
[57:35.620 --> 57:38.420]  And there was nothing I could do about it at the time.
[57:38.420 --> 57:40.100]  And there was no way,
[57:40.100 --> 57:42.540]  there's no recourse for it or anything else.
[57:43.700 --> 57:48.700]  So yeah, I think that that's a major downfall
[57:50.740 --> 57:55.060]  is that a lot of our educational tools get censored.
[57:55.060 --> 57:59.700]  And so I want to quickly just applaud you guys
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.820]  for doing what you're doing
[58:01.820 --> 58:05.100]  and bringing this out to the public
[58:05.100 --> 58:09.140]  and using your knowledge and your reach
[58:09.140 --> 58:11.940]  to get it out to people because it's important.
[58:11.940 --> 58:13.740]  It's important topics, important things
[58:13.740 --> 58:14.940]  that we're talking about here
[58:14.940 --> 58:17.780]  because it's not only the future of our weed,
[58:17.780 --> 58:20.180]  it's the future of our soil, it's the future of our food,
[58:20.180 --> 58:21.620]  it's the future of our world.
[58:22.460 --> 58:24.420]  Yeah, man, you ain't lying, Robert.
[58:26.820 --> 58:29.460]  Yeah, well, I wanted to just briefly bring on MJ
[58:29.460 --> 58:31.780]  and then we can obviously get into deeper discussion
[58:31.780 --> 58:32.620]  having him on.
[58:32.620 --> 58:33.580]  Yeah.
[58:33.580 --> 58:34.420]  But there's a reason again why-
[58:34.420 --> 58:36.580]  I'm sorry to keep reminding you on the grow off.
[58:36.580 --> 58:38.220]  I want to talk about that still.
[58:38.220 --> 58:39.540]  Yeah, we should.
[58:39.540 --> 58:41.380]  And hey, we're having fun, we're getting stoned.
[58:41.380 --> 58:43.620]  So if we're cutting off or we forget Marco,
[58:43.620 --> 58:45.580]  just let's get back into it.
[58:45.580 --> 58:49.580]  But yeah, having MJ come back on again,
[58:49.580 --> 58:52.380]  there's something special to this day for me,
[58:52.380 --> 58:53.820]  kind of going down memory lane.
[58:53.820 --> 58:56.980]  And I think there's a lot of talent right here.
[58:56.980 --> 58:59.060]  And I think that if more individuals realize
[58:59.060 --> 59:01.740]  that you don't necessarily have to have a huge Instagram
[59:01.740 --> 59:03.700]  to be anybody of any significance.
[59:03.700 --> 59:05.460]  I've also had mine deleted, Robbie,
[59:05.460 --> 59:10.460]  and I felt like it was actually a breath of fresh air.
[59:10.540 --> 59:14.500]  You have to obviously, for less of a...
[59:14.500 --> 59:15.700]  There's really no other way, I guess,
[59:15.700 --> 59:17.740]  to be in the influence of cannabis
[59:17.740 --> 59:19.420]  without being on Instagram.
[59:20.260 --> 59:22.460]  But once that account is deleted, I don't know,
[59:22.460 --> 59:24.740]  there's something to where it's like, all right, whatever.
[59:24.740 --> 59:25.580]  I mean, it's-
[59:25.580 --> 59:27.380]  You didn't get deleted.
[59:27.380 --> 59:31.500]  You're still here, so they can't delete the person.
[59:31.500 --> 59:33.020]  And you get to refocus on stuff.
[59:33.020 --> 59:35.820]  And I hope that the karma for that seems to be
[59:35.820 --> 59:37.580]  like when that happens to individuals,
[59:37.580 --> 59:41.060]  the monetary gains seem to come for whatever reason.
[59:41.060 --> 59:42.860]  So just shout out to that aspect.
[59:42.860 --> 59:46.020]  And I think in time, especially being on these platforms,
[59:46.020 --> 59:47.540]  sharing what you know, buddy,
[59:47.540 --> 59:48.860]  there's a lot of people that are gonna want
[59:49.300 --> 59:50.820]  to grow your gear just because of the grow off.
[59:50.820 --> 59:52.460]  So we'll talk about that in a second,
[59:52.460 --> 59:54.660]  but let's get MJ on here.
[59:54.660 --> 59:55.940]  He's a UGK.
[59:55.940 --> 59:56.820]  If you know what that means,
[59:56.820 --> 59:57.900]  you know what I'm talking about.
[59:57.900 --> 59:58.980]  Somebody that I admire,
[59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.180]  somebody that took risks for a long, long time,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:02.620]  and now is wanting to show his face.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.940]  So I love that shit.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.220]  Good to see you, brother.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.100]  Much love to you, nerds, genetics, big robs in the house.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:10.940]  Love you, man.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.700]  Love all the work that you've put in throughout the years.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.700]  Always been an inspiration to me.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.940]  What's up, Marco and Brian?
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.780]  Sorry about y'all.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.420]  I had to jump right in, I'm a man,
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.900]  because that's big standards for me.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.580]  I know you're coming in with that big energy.
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.500]  We got you.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.340]  Come on in.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.940]  Oh, well, Rob, man, let me give you your flowers first,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.780]  if you don't mind, man.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:35.780]  The day I met you, what really brought my attention
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.780]  and my focus to what you were talking about
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.060]  versus all the big tents,
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.220]  the guys that were selling all these other things
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.940]  and gadgets and what not was,
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.340]  you could hear your passion when you talk about it.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.940]  That's what pulled me and gravitated me directly to you.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.740]  This dude is real.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.500]  I remember talking to my best friend,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.860]  shout out to Natalie Simone.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.900]  She was like, go over there and talk to him.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.660]  Let's follow him and let's see what's going on.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.260]  Ever since the day I met you, bro,
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.900]  it's been an incline in success.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.340]  It's been an incline in education
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.060]  and definitely love in the cannabis world.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:15.900]  Appreciate you.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.180]  Love you once again.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.380]  Thank you for having me with you guys once.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.540]  I can't tell you how much it goes both ways.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.660]  I echo everything that you just said.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.260]  And it's so cool because I admire you as a grower
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:38.660]  and I've gotten to watch you up your skills as a grower
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.580]  and as a commercial grower and as a home grower.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:47.420]  It's been super cool to be able to
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.580]  not only watch you grow my gear,
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:55.580]  but also watch your passion for growing
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.980]  really grow because of growing my gear
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.180]  and everybody else's too.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.780]  But that's such a cool thing to be able to inspire somebody
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.700]  that you are inspired by.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.900]  So just big love.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.140]  That's all I want to say.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.980]  Appreciate it.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.420]  MJ, you want to kind of get into,
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.380]  well, actually, hold on a second.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.780]  We should back up a minute.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.180]  We want to talk about the grow off
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.820]  because we don't want to lose track side of that.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.060]  And I think more individuals might understand
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.460]  why his gear has been so respected
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.380]  amongst the UGK type individuals.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.460]  And I think that there's a badge of honor
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.580]  that comes with that, MJ.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.500]  And I think there's a reason why individuals
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.460]  such as yourself, myself at one point in life,
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.500]  we chose genetics because we needed
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.860]  that shit to come through.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.020]  There is no mistakes when you're paying
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.300]  and trying to do all this for your family
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.980]  and pay the bills with this kind of stuff.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.700]  So the genetics have to be tried and true.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.660]  And so let's get into that, Rob,
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.620]  and then let's get into why you were running
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.580]  his stuff as well, MJ.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.180]  So Rob, let's get into the grow off part.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:07.780]  And have you selected a strategy for the grow off?
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.380]  Not for this year.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.580]  And so this year, it sounds like the grow off
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.380]  is gonna be done a little bit differently
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.900]  and it's not really,
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.780]  I should probably not be the one to be the spoiler alert
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.860]  on or the spoiler on how that's all gonna go down
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:29.820]  because I just was sort of given the update the other day.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.620]  But we are gonna be working with them again in 2023
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.260]  in a capacity that is going to be very cool.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.620]  The reason, so the grow off is super cool.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.780]  If you guys don't know what the grow off is,
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.900]  you should really look it up.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.500]  I believe it's in eight, nine, 10 states right now,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.340]  something like that.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.380]  It's all over the country.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.860]  There's one probably close to you.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.460]  The way it works is everybody is given the same cut.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.380]  Nobody knows what that cut is.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.340]  They know that the cut has been tested for HPLVD
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:11.180]  and is inspected for pests and mold and things like that
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.420]  before they go out to it.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.300]  But nobody knows what the genetic is,
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.660]  only who the breeder is.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.020]  And that information is not given to them
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.180]  until the end of the time.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:27.180]  So the competition is basically who can
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.780]  really test their skills the best
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.380]  when they don't know what it's gonna be.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.460]  Like if you don't have four or five runs
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.620]  to find out what the flowering time is
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.420]  or what kind of food it's gonna be,
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:43.260]  like are you gonna be able to show up and do this?
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.500]  And then it's judged by lab results.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.500]  So everybody is required to turn in a lab sample
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:56.420]  at the end of the cycle on basically,
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.420]  they have a window of time with which they can turn it in.
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.020]  And then the same lab goes through
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.060]  and tests for cannabinoids and terpenes.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.380]  And then the highest cannabinoid profile wins
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.700]  and the highest terpene level profile wins.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.380]  And so there's a lot of subjectivity in weed
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.100]  and what people like and what people don't like.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:31.020]  So this I think is a very interesting competition
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.740]  because it's not subjective.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.700]  It's based on lab results, which is maybe,
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.060]  people have their own opinions about that.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.180]  Whether or not that's a good strategy is up for debate.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.740]  And people in the comments go nuts,
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.980]  tell us all about what you think about that.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.020]  But I think that it's a fair way
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.180]  because it takes the human element out of it.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.860]  And so everybody knows what they're growing for.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.060]  They know that they're growing
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.420]  for the highest cannabinoids
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.980]  or they know they're growing for the highest terpenes.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.940]  And if you're a real good grower,
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.420]  there are things that you can do to bring those numbers up.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.860]  And it's not surprising to me at all
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:16.300]  that the same people win year after year.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.900]  But so anyway, the thing that's real interesting
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.900]  about that is it's a competition.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.380]  And the first year of the grow off,
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.220]  I didn't really know what I was getting myself into.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:38.380]  And we've worked a lot on breeding for stability,
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.860]  not looking for, or trying to make sure
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:45.300]  that when you pop a packet out fours,
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.700]  they're gonna be almost all the same plan.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.260]  There's not gonna be Hermes or anything like that.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.340]  But for the grow off, I actually picked,
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.300]  I went a different route the first year that we did it.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.380]  I didn't look for the most stable plant I had.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.940]  I looked for the one that I thought had the potential
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.500]  to hit the highest numbers.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.740]  And that was met with some interesting reactions
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.580]  because some people did push their plants real hard
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.680]  and get them to show some intersex flowers.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.500]  But they had the highest terpene numbers
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:25.020]  that they'd ever had in any competition.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.540]  And they had the highest cannabinoids
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.900]  they'd ever had in any competition.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.860]  So when you're looking at a cannabis competition,
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.980]  and we're not looking at something that is something
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.660]  that I would say, yeah, put this in your commercial grow
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.260]  and run this every run next to your,
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.660]  in your most unstable conditions.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.820]  It was more like, what can you do with this?
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.460]  And what can you get out of it?
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.580]  What can you really show that you can be
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.140]  a real bad-ass grower and push these numbers
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.700]  as high as they can go?
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:04.140]  And let me tell you, the people who showed up, showed up.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.780]  They showed up in such a serious way.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.700]  It was so cool.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:12.220]  I mean, granted, I don't know that this is a real number,
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:17.220]  but the total terpenes for the one in Colorado,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.100]  the first time they tested, it was 8.1%.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.120]  Now, for anybody who has ever tested terpenes,
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.160]  normally you see them in one, two, maybe 3% ranges.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.000]  8.1% are mythical numbers.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.120]  And I'm not sure that that was like an accurate-
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.280]  I want some of that.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.440]  Yeah, well, we'll get you some.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:46.400]  But when they retested it, it tested at 6.5 or 6.7% terpenes.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.080]  So no matter what, whatever they did brought up
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.840]  the number of terpenes in that plant
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.360]  to a tremendous level.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.440]  Like even if the test is off and it was only 4% terpenes,
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.880]  it was 4% terpenes.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.640]  You know, like that's crazy.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.640]  So one of the things that I think is really interesting
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.520]  about the grow-off is that when given the opportunity
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.160]  to really shine, growers will really shine.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.800]  I think that's so cool.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.360]  But also it was interesting to get some of the comments
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.520]  and some of the feedback that came with it
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.640]  because it was maybe outside
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  of what our traditional breeding has been for.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.760]  Because the strain that we released for that first one
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.760]  was Hype Train, which is not part of my breeding projects.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.920]  That was something I made as a one-off
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.160]  that I thought was cool.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.840]  But the potential for it was insane.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.000]  And you could tell just by looking at the plant
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  that if somebody really gave it the attention
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.880]  that it deserved, that it could thrive in ways
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.200]  that some of the other plants didn't have that potential for.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.040]  But it was something that, I mean, we released like 10 packs
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.000]  of those seeds or something like that.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.600]  Compared to the hundreds or thousands of packs
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.800]  of Woadie seeds that I have released.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.960]  It's just a totally different beast
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.560]  on what we were looking for.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.600]  But it was a super interesting learning experience.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.640]  And then this year in Oklahoma,
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.640]  we put out another strain that I really like,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.840]  which is Blueberry Headband x Woadie.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.520]  And we call that one Aretha.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.960]  And it didn't test in a super high-quality strain
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.560]  for insane numbers like the Hype Train did.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.880]  But it was overall, I think maybe better received
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.640]  by the growers in the competition
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.120]  because they had something that they could take back
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.360]  and put in their stable.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.520]  And the people in Oklahoma who won this year
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.400]  and absolutely killed it.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.040]  They got their weed in one of the hardest dispensaries
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.840]  to get into with that strain.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.640]  And they have that forever now if they want it.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.040]  And that was Aretha?
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.920]  Aretha.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.760]  Aretha, yeah.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.600]  Nice.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.680]  Like is it to Aretha Franklin or?
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.800]  Yeah, I'm a huge music fan,
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.800]  especially hip hop and soul and Motown
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800]  and things like that.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.600]  And Aretha Franklin died as I was trying
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.720]  to name this strain.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.960]  And I believe my wife actually suggested it
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.040]  as a possibility and it stuck.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.400]  And it ended up just being something that was,
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.400]  she's a real boss lady.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.400]  It really fits for a tribute to such an amazing woman.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.240]  Nice, I like that.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.920]  Well, listen to this right quick.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.440]  ♪ I'm the boss, I'm the fuck the rest ♪
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.920]  ♪ You need a lover, get your flow in that low C smoke ♪
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:30.350]  ♪ Feeling the strength of the titans, I heard her ♪
[01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:31.350]  ♪ And you gotta go, I'm the boss, I'm the way up ♪
[01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.790]  All right, y'all caught the vibe?
[01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:37.030]  So I gotta talk about that Thug Passion.
[01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:40.110]  We gotta talk about that Thug Passion.
[01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.230]  I saw that out there too.
[01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:45.470]  Oh man, we're talking about one of my favorite strains.
[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.390]  That's some of the best work that I ever did.
[01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:51.950]  I mean, I have one category for sure.
[01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:58.270]  We had a real, we had a Bubba Kush
[01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:02.110]  that had been around Boulder for a long time
[01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:04.070]  that we got access to.
[01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:08.070]  And Bubba Kush is a real unique plant
[01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:11.590]  for those of us out there who have grown it.
[01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:17.470]  There are two major phenos that you see out there
[01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.190]  that people call Bubba Kush.
[01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:24.550]  There's what people consider to be the pre-90A Bubba Kush,
[01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:28.710]  which is a short stout plant
[01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:30.830]  that takes a real long time to veg
[01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:35.830]  and produces these just amazing coffee chocolate
[01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:36.910]  flavored ducks.
[01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:40.710]  And then the Katsu Bubba,
[01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:44.110]  which is a lankier, taller version of it
[01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:49.670]  that is the same,
[01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:53.550]  pretty much the same bud structure and flavor profile
[01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.750]  as the pre-90A Bubba, very, very similar,
[01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.790]  maybe perhaps a little bit more fruit.
[01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:01.750]  But has a totally different growth structure.
[01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:05.030]  And then interestingly enough,
[01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:07.710]  there's a third kind of variety that is out there
[01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:09.990]  from all of the S1s that have been produced
[01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:11.870]  with Bubba Kush over the years
[01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:15.790]  from either plants that selfed themselves
[01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:19.590]  under stressful situations were purposefully selfed
[01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:24.590]  like what Swerve and the guys from Cali Connections did.
[01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:29.590]  And those are also called Bubba Kush.
[01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:35.750]  So when we talk about Bubba Kush,
[01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:40.310]  we're talking about these three basic phenos
[01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.670]  that show up in all of it.
[01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:48.230]  Like the S1s tend to show up as like a bigger yielding
[01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:51.670]  version of the pre-90A for the most part,
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:53.070]  unless it was made with Katsu
[01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:55.870]  and then it shows up as like similar to Katsu.
[01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:00.790]  But so we're talking about the same plant,
[01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:03.790]  but it's like actually three varieties.
[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.070]  So anyway, the one that will...
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.380]  Man, it's almost like he's about to freeze up.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.060]  About to drop a bomb and then freeze up.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:22.740]  Man, that passion, man, that shit sounds wonderful.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.020]  That Bubba in there, have you grown that brothers grow MJ?
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.540]  Sir?
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.740]  Have you grown his thug passion?
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.860]  Yes, I have.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.060]  Oh, I love that passion.
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.620]  I love the coloring, the structure.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.180]  The high is amazing, of course.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.020]  I remember I got to touch bases
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.060]  when you guys said something about Aretha.
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:47.060]  You know his on the area is I'm gonna let him finish,
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.060]  but it says dripping with class.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.620]  This soul queen brings a sense of elegance
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.620]  to any situation when you see her shining
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.220]  like a sequined dress in a spotlight
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.660]  and smelling and it froze up.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.180]  I love the description, Rob's always gives.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.020]  Gosh.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.220]  That's a bad lady, man.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.580]  Aretha want no joke.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.400]  All right, you back Rob?
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.240]  Can you hear us, bud?
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.320]  I muted you.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.340]  It says the mic's not connected yet.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:28.220]  All right, MJ, did you kind of want to get more into
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.180]  why you were choosing him to highlight
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.780]  and why you were, before you came on,
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.300]  I was saying, man, you're the best dude to have
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.820]  in your corner because you're hype training everything up.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.860]  And then when some of these names come out and stuff,
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.300]  it's just, I don't know, man.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.820]  It's just fun to see, like you had mentioned,
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.300]  people that you've known for a long time
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.500]  start to find success.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.180]  Yeah, definitely been following for,
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.260]  like we said, some time and we all met each other
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.980]  at kind of the same events and it kind of prospered
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.860]  into where we're at now, like eight, 10 years later
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.620]  or whatnot, I don't know how long exactly it's been,
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:09.900]  but man, it's been great to see everybody pick the lane
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:14.540]  they're finally destined to be in and ride it out.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.460]  When you get in your own lane, there's no traffic,
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.900]  you notice, but when you ride in somebody else's lane,
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.860]  there's always traffic, you go on and get around
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:21.700]  and move around.
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.260]  Man, I can't do what I wanna do in your lane
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.340]  with you driving like that, but when I get into this left
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.260]  lane over here, it's a wrap.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.580]  That's a bar right there, man, stay in your lane.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.940]  It's a lot easier that way.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.980]  Yeah, Rob, we were talking about some of your genetics,
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.980]  some of the reasons why MJ chose to hype those so much.
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:45.740]  One of the ones that stood out for me
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.140]  while we're talking about that was the hype train
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140]  crossed with the platinum OG.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.820]  You were calling that the 1337 OG.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.820]  Do you mind kind of explaining that one for me?
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.380]  It has all the, it sounds like something
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.340]  that I would be interested in.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.940]  So yeah, love to learn about that.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.580]  It sounds like this, you know, you do like that.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.780]  High end Italian.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.700]  It certainly should be something.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.220]  It certainly should be something you're interested in.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.060]  It's awesome.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.340]  Yeah.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.820]  It's, so 1337, for those of you out there
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:27.020]  who are not in the 1980s or before,
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:33.460]  is weak, which is early 90s hacker speak for,
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.860]  basically it was, you use letters and numbers as code.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.500]  But when I made the hype train crosses,
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:50.500]  I had this idea that I was gonna hype the planet thing,
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:55.500]  which was an ode to the 90s movie
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.540]  starring Angelina Jolie, Hackers,
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.100]  which is a hilarious movie.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.820]  If you have never seen it, please go watch it on YouTube.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.940]  It will enlighten you.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.940]  But we made that cross, the lead OG.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.140]  Platinum OG is a phenomenal strength.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.340]  It is one of the expression that comes from,
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.100]  so the one that we have is,
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.100]  trying to think about where to start with this,
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.620]  cause the OG story is very long
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.580]  for everybody in the community
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.900]  who has ever taken the time to try and figure out
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.060]  where this glorious train has come,
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.900]  and all the people that held it over the years
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.100]  in order to get it to where it is.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:59.460]  But in short, there's this original OG
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:05.460]  that created a bunch of S1 seeds over the years,
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.700]  that created all of the other OGs.
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.140]  So the SFV, the Hells OG,
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.420]  that's like the white, I believe,
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.420]  is also amongst this area of things
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.820]  that are all just basically self TKs.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.940]  And the phenos that came out of it,
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.100]  there are different things that came out of it.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:31.500]  One of the phenos that comes out in the S1 generation
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.980]  is this big yielding OG that is super frosty,
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:41.180]  but doesn't have any of the OG flavor, OG smell,
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.940]  OG, anything that makes it like really OG.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.980]  It has sort of the bud structure,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.060]  but it's a bigger yielder.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:54.060]  It definitely is a nod to the super skunk parent
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:59.940]  of OG Kush, or I mean, they call it Puck,
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.820]  from what I understand,
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.540]  is at least one of the parents of TK,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:09.220]  which is a, from what I understand,
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.060]  and don't quote me on this,
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:14.460]  because this is really something that the Kim family
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.380]  needs to be talking about, not me.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:22.220]  But the way I understand it is that
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.460]  it's basically three NLs, three Northern Lights
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.620]  that are crossed together to make this hash plant
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.020]  that was called Puck,
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.420]  and then that became part of TK's mom.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:38.820]  I believe it's also part of Kim Dog 91's mom,
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:42.700]  if I'm not mistaken, or in the lineage.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.140]  I believe they're both mothers there.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.900]  Anyway, what came out of the next generation
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.940]  is all these different varieties of OGs
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.140]  that we have all come to love.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.420]  And one of them is this big, yielding,
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:06.060]  super frosty, sort of tasteless, smellless version of OG,
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.980]  which still gets you incredibly high,
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:15.460]  like incredibly high, but isn't necessarily,
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.260]  like it doesn't have the sort of floral gas flavor
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.020]  that comes from the,
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:25.660]  it's got its own, like tasteless,
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.260]  hashy thing that comes from it.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.140]  But what's interesting about it
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.900]  is the way that it breeds into the next generation.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.740]  Literally everything that we have bred it to
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.820]  has become a bigger, yielding,
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.420]  more potent, insane version of itself.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:48.420]  When we made Wepa, which is a woady times splat emoji,
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.700]  that was the first strain that I ever saw from us
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.380]  that hit something over 30% in another state.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:59.940]  And again, tests are not necessarily
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.020]  all about where it's at,
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.900]  but it's interesting because it's saying
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.060]  that there is a high concentration of THC in this plant,
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:06.900]  and that breeds forward.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:08.220]  It's a good reference point.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.060]  Like crazy.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.820]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.580]  It's something that allows us to say,
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.820]  okay, well, this is for sure potent,
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.260]  but is it potent in a way
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.100]  that is going to be good for people?
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:23.340]  That's to be determined by subjective experience
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.020]  and coming back to us with feedback
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.500]  and those kinds of things.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.660]  Like a test is never going to be able to tell me
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.820]  whether or not this strain heals,
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:34.820]  or ails, heals what ails you.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.740]  But it is going to say,
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.020]  okay, well, this has the potential
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.940]  to be very strong and hash.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.740]  It has the potential to be something
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.420]  that could be a very powerful medicine
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:53.060]  if the combinations of all the cannabinoids
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.260]  and terpenes are working together properly.
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.340]  But anyway, Plant Emoji is one
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.700]  of the biggest yielding strains
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.300]  that we put in our commercial gardens
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.580]  year after year after year.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.980]  Like every time when we do the numbers
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.860]  of what the different strains come out,
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.220]  and part of our pheno process,
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.580]  back to what we were talking about earlier,
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.900]  is there's two rounds of pheno hunting that we do.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.140]  We do it and figure out good enough
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.700]  as like all the things.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.660]  Like, so we'll treat them real bad,
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.780]  get them all the way through,
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:29.820]  see what survived, what still produced good smoke,
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.380]  and then like what of that smoke
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.820]  is something that we're even interested in.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.780]  And then we run those out against the rest of stable.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.620]  So, a good thing to think about
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:43.780]  as a commercial grower back to building your stable
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.940]  is when you find and set the bar with,
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.220]  like say you have an AK or a Blue Dream
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.260]  or something like that,
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.100]  that you can set the bar with,
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.100]  or literally any strain that you have
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.780]  that you have yield numbers on,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.900]  that's where your bar is set right there.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.140]  So when you bring something in,
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.260]  you wanna be able to run capacity
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.420]  to be able to test it against the bar that's already set.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.660]  So if you are say,
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.700]  let's say that you have rows,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.820]  which you run in your commercial grow.
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:18.500]  If you can do one whole row that is a new strain
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.260]  that has been already tested in your pheno hunt room,
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.220]  and you know is a smoke that you like,
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:29.220]  and is something that gets to the end
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.380]  without producing intersex flowers,
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.420]  and isn't real prone to pests and disease
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.620]  and things like that,
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.340]  then you can put it into your room
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.540]  in a commercial sense to see what it does
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.900]  in a commercial setting.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.100]  So when you put it into that commercial setting
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.900]  and you feed it the way that you are with everything else,
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.060]  it has to perform at the same bar
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:53.900]  that you've already set with your stable or better,
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.020]  or it has to go.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.620]  And when you put it in and you can give it a real chance
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.460]  and run a row of them,
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.940]  or run one big plant,
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.980]  or run something that gives you a chance
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.020]  in order to be able to say,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.220]  okay, well compared to this Gorilla Glue
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:11.880]  that I have as my stable already,
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.880]  the bar is set at 10,000 grams per row.
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:20.300]  This one produced 12,000 grams.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.580]  It was better and it was easier to grow.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.780]  Well, suddenly the bar is up now.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:29.300]  Now the new level of the stable is what you just brought in,
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.160]  and everything that you bring in after that
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.300]  has to be as good or better.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.340]  And that's how we get better at this community.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.900]  That's how we collectively breed something
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.180]  that is better for us as humans.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.700]  And it's how communities did this for thousands of years
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.020]  before prohibition.
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.780]  That's key right there, man.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.500]  That is how we get better.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.100]  Set that bar higher.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.840]  That makes a lot of sense, man.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.460]  And I like that you broke it down to where,
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.020]  in the commercial sense,
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:03.500]  a lot of times weight is the key.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.700]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.540]  On that side.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.260]  But to me, I feel like we got a thing we-
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.340]  Tell them what they can't.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.820]  We got a thing we say is called
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.540]  skipping rungs on the ladder.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.100]  Like you might've made it to the top,
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.980]  but did you hit all the steps along the way?
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.780]  And I feel like just because you have money
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.740]  and you can open up a commercial facility,
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.460]  I still feel like there's value into...
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620]  You gotta start somewhere.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.180]  And even running your own stuff
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.880]  and kind of creating your own stable
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.640]  so that when you do start that facility,
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.000]  you're not, like you said earlier,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.600]  just hunting.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.880]  You gotta have something stable
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.200]  that you know is gonna work
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.640]  on a scaled up version, if that makes sense.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.680]  So all key points, man.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.440]  Oh, 100%.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:51.520]  That is a huge, huge thing to being successful
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.680]  in this industry.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.400]  And it has to be stable.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.960]  It has to be unique.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.200]  It has to be commercially viable.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.480]  And it has to be something
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.000]  that you think is good enough
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.040]  to give to somebody else for them
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.740]  to keep coming back for it.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.640]  Because when it gets to the end user
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.120]  and when it gets to the bud tender,
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.080]  or let's say it gets to the bud tender
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.200]  and then it gets to the end user,
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.400]  we're talking about two people
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.280]  who have to be convinced
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.120]  that it's going to be a useful thing.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.360]  You have to convince the bud tender first
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.440]  that it is going to be something that can help people.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.800]  And then they have to be able
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.080]  to show the uneducated population,
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.720]  this is what's available for you to try.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.160]  And if it helps them,
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.360]  they're going to come back and keep buying that
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.440]  because it helped them.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]  That was the whole point.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.120]  They came in to find something that helped them.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.680]  They were shown something
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.280]  that could potentially help them.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.460]  And then it did.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.120]  That's the whole cycle completed.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.720]  And so when we can get to a place
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.440]  where we're really educating our consumers
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.520]  and we're really educating ourselves,
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.000]  then the level of care
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.360]  that we're going to be able to provide
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.960]  with this plant is going to be so much higher
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:04.840]  and so much more found of what we can do with it.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.840]  And it's not limited to just the medical effects.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.160]  One of the things that I find absolutely fascinating
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:18.160]  about this plant is that when you apply the same,
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.120]  the same procedures that you do
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.800]  for trying to breed for cannabinoids
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.920]  or terpenes or whatever,
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:37.400]  but you change the goal to say be fiber
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:42.400]  or material for plastic or paper pulp
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:48.640]  or seed production for seed oil or seed flour.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:52.840]  Now we're talking about 50,000 other usable products
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.560]  that we can be breeding for.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.440]  This is not just one parameter of this.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.560]  I mean, when you're breeding for tomatoes,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.960]  you're breeding for flavor
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.320]  or you're breeding for yield or whatever.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:11.600]  But like this plant has literally thousands
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.640]  of different things that we as a community
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.320]  could decide to select for, decide to be interested in.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.320]  And the amount of work that I can do is so little
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.560]  compared to the amount of work that we can do.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.880]  And the amount of work that I've been able to do
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:33.840]  because I've had people like Michael on my team
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.360]  and really supporting the work that I'm doing
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.960]  has allowed for so much more expanse
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.720]  because I get to look at what he does in his facilities.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.280]  I get to look at where he had his successes and pitfalls
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.080]  and I get to compare it to the things that I did.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.720]  And now I have two opinions and not just one.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.400]  And when that's infinitely multiplied
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.640]  across this amazing like sort of meta universe
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.440]  that we've created through social media
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.000]  and platforms like this,
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:12.080]  we're able to do something that like science
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.720]  hasn't really provided the platform for.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.360]  Like there's not university studies on this
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.960]  and the way that there need to be
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.360]  in order for it to be advanced.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:28.120]  And so we as a community took that on and we did it.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.560]  That's so cool.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:33.440]  There's something really, really interesting
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:35.240]  about this plant and this community
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.960]  because as a team, we banded together
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.600]  and we made something that suddenly
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.680]  there is basically free access to this plant
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.040]  all over the world now
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.040]  after there being a hundred years of prohibition.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:53.640]  And we talked about 2014, not being able to find seeds.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.560]  Well, I don't think there's a country in the world
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:58.040]  where you can't find seeds anymore.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.360]  So, you know, like that's amazing.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.960]  Did we lose Marco?
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:06.800]  No.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.960]  No, I'm back.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.920]  And that is amazing.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.760]  Before we get into more dialogue,
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:15.000]  Rob, as usual, you're really generous
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  and we wanted to kind of take like an intermission,
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.040]  if you will, and give away some seeds,
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.200]  some of the genetics that, you know,
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.560]  you wanna give to the community.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.320]  And I always think when you're giving out like that,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.440]  especially genetics that people want,
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.360]  you know, there's always something to that.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.960]  So MJ, if you wanna pop in here as well, buddy,
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.920]  just kind of wanted to talk about the genetics
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.000]  that you're giving away, Rob.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  And then if London's back behind stage here,
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.080]  you know, what is the best way to do a giveaway?
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.000]  I don't know if I know that.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.360]  What do you think, Marco?
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.200]  Do you have an idea?
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.360]  Like do you wanna pick a number?
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.240]  I've seen it done.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.200]  No, we're gonna stick to the question.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.120]  The question is, you know, we have that question.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.120]  So the winner, then we'll talk about the strain.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.760]  All right, so we asked the question now.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:06.800]  We gotta watch the chat.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.280]  Now, as the first person that we see popped up in the chat,
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.720]  I don't know nothing about anything else.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.920]  When we see that person,
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:18.120]  we're gonna say he got the answer, all right?
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:18.960]  So the question is-
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.360]  I gotta ask Robbie something real quick.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.760]  Okay, go, yeah, build that suspense, go ahead.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.400]  Whoever, Robbie, let me just ask you this.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.240]  The watermelon Pakistani?
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.600]  Killer.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.600]  Why does it smell just like watermelon now or later?
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.720]  Like I'm in the movies just eating popcorn
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.320]  and I gotta, give me one of them now or later,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.800]  baby, I'll put one in my pop.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:46.520]  Every time, it's the exact smell and taste, every time.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.840]  Why is that?
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.680]  Rick.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.800]  Well, it's a unique combination of terpene
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:59.040]  is found mostly in land Pakistani plants.
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:04.880]  Almost every land race Pakistani variety that I've,
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.480]  well, so that whole mountain range
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.160]  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal area,
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.320]  amazing weed has come there,
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.160]  but what they selected for in those mountains
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.640]  in at least one particular variety,
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.760]  which I've found a couple of different times,
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.160]  comes out as a very watermelon pheno
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.440]  and that breeds as a dominant trait going forward.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.240]  So the woadie melon, which is my version
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.680]  of the watermelon Pakistani,
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.400]  is the woadie to that,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.680]  which adds a little bit more fruit,
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.280]  but what really comes through is the dominant trait
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.480]  of the Pakistani,
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.080]  just the dominant terpene combination
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.240]  is unlike anything that you see anywhere else.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.880]  And pretty much every I've seen it show up
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.160]  in other crosses that other people do,
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:16.400]  it's the same watermelon candy,
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.080]  you know, like calling it a now later
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.640]  is the closest thing that you really,
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.400]  you can do to describe it.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.520]  It's unbelievably sweet.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.400]  And when you bring it down into a dab
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.320]  where you extract it initially with hydrocarbons,
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:33.920]  you know,
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.800]  rosin is amazing,
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.200]  but there's something that happens really
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.480]  in a resting way,
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:43.080]  carbons and especially this one,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.960]  that is so sweet that it leaves like an out on your lips
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.560]  that you can like lick it and you just ate ice cream
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.480]  and you had watermelon ice cream.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.920]  It's truly phenomenal,
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:04.160]  but it's because the content is so high, Michael.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.000]  Okay.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.440]  That is the, that's the answer.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:10.920]  And it's unique terpenes
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.960]  that you don't see very often otherwise.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.560]  Nice.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.400]  That sounds good.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.440]  And the last little bit to that is
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.760]  they're gonna be a lucky person
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.480]  that's gonna get some of the,
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.560]  the wondy melon as well.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.560]  Is that gonna be in your giveaway?
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.160]  Yes.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.160]  I wasn't really deciding how we were going to do this,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.000]  but here's what I think we should do.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.120]  So we should give away.
[01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:41.450]  I mean,
[01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:43.530]  I just want to show.
[01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:50.770]  Hold on, you're freezing up on us, Rob.
[01:36:52.090 --> 01:36:53.690]  We don't want to miss this part.
[01:36:57.210 --> 01:36:58.610]  Hold tight, you froze up.
[01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:01.650]  That's all right, build a suspense.
[01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:03.130]  We got free feeds.
[01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:04.970]  There you go.
[01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:09.410]  Seed packs are coming.
[01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:12.050]  He's gonna tell us how we're gonna do the giveaway.
[01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.890]  It just jumped.
[01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:13.730]  We might be good.
[01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:15.210]  Are we good?
[01:37:15.210 --> 01:37:16.050]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:16.890]  Just let, yeah.
[01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:19.930]  So how about we, okay.
[01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:21.770]  So how about we do three packs?
[01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:24.130]  The pack that we give away
[01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:26.130]  will be the answer to Marco's question.
[01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:31.650]  Second one will be,
[01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:35.690]  I'm gonna let MJ pick a trick question.
[01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:40.210]  And get a bit of a body melon.
[01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:46.490]  And I think Brian should pick a trivia question
[01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:47.650]  of any subject.
[01:37:47.650 --> 01:37:50.850]  And whoever gets that can get a pack of,
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:52.810]  let's say 1337 OG.
[01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:57.130]  Ooh, damn, y'all lucky out there.
[01:37:57.130 --> 01:37:58.050]  This is gonna be nice.
[01:37:58.050 --> 01:37:59.370]  All right, so we heard the first one.
[01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:02.010]  The first one was, I'm gonna ask the question.
[01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:04.010]  All right, my question is,
[01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:06.570]  and the first person that types it in that I see,
[01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:09.170]  and I'm gonna say it, that's who wins.
[01:38:09.170 --> 01:38:13.090]  What is the first one of Robbie's strains that we mentioned?
[01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:14.890]  What is the first strain we mentioned
[01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:16.810]  on the show today of his?
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:18.770]  Go.
[01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:22.650]  All right, this is for a pack of seeds.
[01:38:25.570 --> 01:38:28.810]  Remind the viewers which one is first.
[01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:31.010]  You're generous giving away three packs.
[01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:32.730]  Yeah, what's going on this first pack?
[01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.010]  So they don't, yeah.
[01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:38.210]  The answer to the question.
[01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:39.650]  All right, the answer to the question.
[01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:41.370]  Boom, Justin.
[01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:42.210]  Boom.
[01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:44.130]  Oh, I thought, where's my man?
[01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:46.450]  Let me see, let me check my screen, guys.
[01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:47.490]  Chill out.
[01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:49.610]  Damn, it looks like Derek Nelson.
[01:38:52.450 --> 01:38:55.290]  Yeah, Derek Nelson, right on my screen.
[01:38:56.970 --> 01:38:58.810]  Woody, Woody's the name.
[01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:02.010]  That's what you win.
[01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:06.090]  So Derek Nelson will get a pack of Woody's.
[01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:11.010]  And he needs to reach out to you
[01:39:11.010 --> 01:39:13.610]  to get all that squared away, right?
[01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:19.530]  Yeah, so can we get an email into the chat
[01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:27.370]  or can, let's say Derek,
[01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:30.810]  Derek, can you email me at erdsgenetics at gmail.com?
[01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:35.730]  Can you write that on our little board, Brian?
[01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:38.490]  Nerdsgenetics at gmail.com.
[01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:41.170]  I'm gonna do a little post.
[01:39:41.170 --> 01:39:44.370]  Brian and I got, we're working on our behind the scenes
[01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:48.490]  mixing skills, so we're gonna try to get that put up too.
[01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:53.810]  Yeah, so for anybody who wins one of these,
[01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:55.650]  just shoot me an email.
[01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:57.850]  I've got your name and what you're getting.
[01:39:59.770 --> 01:40:01.370]  We'll get it all figured out.
[01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:03.410]  Boom, there we go, right there.
[01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:04.530]  I'll take care of you.
[01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:09.290]  Now the second pack, you broke up a little bit,
[01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:11.210]  so I didn't even hear what the whole deal is.
[01:40:11.210 --> 01:40:12.930]  So tell that one again, please.
[01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:19.810]  So I want MJ to pick a trivia question from anything.
[01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:24.930]  And the person who gets it right
[01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.330]  gets a pack of Woody melon.
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:31.820]  Now, is it gonna be the person MJ sees first
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.740]  on his screen or we're gonna just let me see it.
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:35.580]  I'll do it again.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.940]  I'll pick, I'll see the guy.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.140]  On your, yes, yes.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:39.980]  Well, I might not know the answer
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.540]  because it's your question.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:43.780]  So you got to pick it.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.260]  I have, so, listeners, what, let's, say it again.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:55.980]  Sorry, can you see the comments?
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:56.820]  So.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:02.940]  They're gonna answer your question over there,
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.660]  so you got to watch and see.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.060]  I can see it, MJ.
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.820]  Just go with it and I'll pop it up there.
[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.740]  Boom.
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:11.740]  I can see it now.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.900]  There we go.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.580]  Okay, so out of the, what we talked about earlier,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:21.580]  which of the strains had platinum OG in it?
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.900]  Was stable, unique, it's a big yielder, it was frosty.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.380]  See if anyone was listening,
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.340]  if they can pick that out of there.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.740]  Damn, I wrote that down too.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:33.580]  I got that.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.260]  I know the answer.
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.540]  You got it?
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:37.540]  I took my notes.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.820]  I took my notes.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.580]  It was actually two acceptable answers there.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:42.420]  Exactly.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.260]  Two, yes.
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.500]  Yep.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.820]  Are you seeing them?
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.820]  Let me look at what we got.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.660]  Okay.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.740]  You wanna get it?
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.460]  No, no, not yet.
[01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:58.190]  Not yet, not yet.
[01:41:58.190 --> 01:41:59.030]  Not Aretha, not Aretha.
[01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:00.950]  I see Doug Passion, that was close.
[01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:02.270]  Aretha.
[01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:03.230]  Not Doug.
[01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:04.510]  Yeah, close.
[01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:05.510]  TK.
[01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:08.150]  I see TK in there.
[01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:09.630]  Boom.
[01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:10.550]  Three, three, seven.
[01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:12.230]  Boom, Justin just got it.
[01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:13.070]  Yep.
[01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:14.350]  1837.
[01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:18.190]  Let me, y'all quick on the draw there, but yeah.
[01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:20.150]  All right, so congratulations to Justin.
[01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:21.750]  Way forward.
[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:23.670]  But there's one more, there's one more.
[01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.630]  Brad got it too.
[01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:27.030]  Brad got it next, right?
[01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:28.510]  With hype train.
[01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:29.910]  You sure did, hype train.
[01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:31.750]  Hype train.
[01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:35.550]  Bubba.
[01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:36.390]  Is that right, Brad?
[01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:37.230]  Yeah, that's right, yeah.
[01:42:37.230 --> 01:42:41.230]  So who got the 1837?
[01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:43.190]  That was the first right one, right?
[01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.350]  Justin, okay.
[01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:45.190]  That is correct.
[01:42:45.190 --> 01:42:46.390]  Okay, man.
[01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:47.230]  Yep.
[01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:52.510]  And I hadn't seen the other part on there yet.
[01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:54.550]  So Justin, please email.
[01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:57.390]  Justin looks like he's gonna be the lucky winner.
[01:42:57.750 --> 01:43:00.910]  Nerdsgenetics at gmail.com.
[01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:02.870]  Try to find that here.
[01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:03.710]  Okay, Brad.
[01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.910]  You hold second, Brad.
[01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:05.950]  You didn't get first.
[01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:06.950]  It's all good.
[01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:08.070]  Ooh, that looks great.
[01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:12.990]  These strings all sound amazing, man.
[01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:15.470]  Y'all, hey, y'all grow them out, man.
[01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:16.990]  Shit, grow these seeds.
[01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:19.190]  I know I'm gonna grow some when I get mine.
[01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:22.990]  All right, for my question, it's-
[01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.830]  Marco.
[01:43:25.110 --> 01:43:25.950]  Yeah, sir.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800]  What'd you say, MJ?
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.120]  Just tell him if he ever got a chance
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.600]  to get this right here, don't slip.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.520]  Okay. That was it.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.280]  I'll get you on the back page on that.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.120]  Well, hold on.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.760]  Is your stuff available?
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.200]  Can we say stuff?
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:53.520]  Like Neptune, is Neptune where you're...
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.160]  Because I saw your stuff and I was like,
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.840]  I don't know if this site's legit.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:57.800]  Are you good there?
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.960]  Actually, Daga DNA Future Cannon
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.120]  is one of the best places to get stuff.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.480]  Okay, Peter's joint.
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.880]  Okay.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.040]  Yeah, I support that.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:11.880]  What's up?
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:12.800]  That's what's up.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.640]  100%.
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:16.640]  All right, sorry.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.400]  All right, so remind me, Robbie,
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.440]  what's the final genetic line we're giving away?
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.880]  The answer to the last question,
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.960]  1337A is the last one going out.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.160]  And then you wanted me to pick a question.
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.240]  So there's a lot of nostalgia with the shirt
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.920]  that MJ has on.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:42.000]  And I actually looked back through some old phones
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.560]  to find out when I first met MJ.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.000]  So I would put out there,
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.920]  if you guys, this should be pretty quick.
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.520]  What year did MJ and I meet each other?
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.560]  It was actually when we first started to find out
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.800]  what the salsy sauce was and talking to Sasquatch
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.360]  and a lot of these older individuals.
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.560]  So what year was that?
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.840]  Please, please send that to us as quick as possible.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.360]  25 and 58.
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.280]  Look at Chad trying to win.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.280]  Endo Exposed.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.680]  So Screamin' Demon Cannabis got that one.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.920]  Yeah, that's my people.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.560]  What's up brother?
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.240]  All right, so I would imagine,
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.600]  please email nerdgenetics at gmail.com
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.480]  so that you can get your seeds.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.800]  And like Marco and everybody on the show is saying,
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.200]  grow them out.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.240]  These are genetics that I think a lot of people
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:43.120]  wish they could get their hands on.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.520]  Here you have the opportunity to basically
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.840]  find something that you might not necessarily
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.840]  have even ever heard of without watching this show.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:53.840]  Outside of-
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.000]  I need a gem.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.800]  Yeah, you can find a lot of gems with that.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.240]  And London was even talking about your genetics
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:01.280]  are now in Canada as well.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.560]  So that's props to you, Rob.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.280]  It's well-deserved, buddy.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.720]  I would imagine things are all over the world.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.280]  You might just not know it yet.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.120]  They are increasingly all over the world,
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.400]  interestingly enough.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.000]  You know, and it's super interesting
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.840]  to have somebody reach out and be like,
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.600]  you know, my cousin sent me this.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.720]  I'm in wherever, you know, Columbia.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.920]  And I'm growing out all of your stuff.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.640]  I found you on Instagram.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.960]  It's super awesome.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.200]  And it's just like the links that happen
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.360]  that you never really think about.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.200]  Because I send out seeds all the time for various reasons,
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.280]  either like venues like this
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.200]  or other giveaways that we do or whatever.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.880]  And to have some of those things
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.760]  be put into somebody's hands and then shared
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:02.120]  and have somebody down the line that like,
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.440]  you know, I never intended to get seeds to get seeds,
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.480]  grow them out and then have some sort of,
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.160]  you know, life altering experience for better or worse.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.160]  It is a really interesting thing because it shows us,
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.160]  you know, how tight the community is and how far it reaches.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.120]  And as I go further in this and the more that we do it
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:33.600]  and the more that we get genetics out there
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.360]  and people grow the stuff,
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:40.360]  the more that I have people tell me that,
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.960]  you know, people are familiar with the work that we've done,
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.600]  that they've grown out the things,
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.480]  or they were happy with something that had happened.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.480]  Or, you know, it's wildly,
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.720]  it's really exciting to be able to be in a position
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.440]  where the work that you do from one place
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.640]  that seems really small
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.200]  can have a really, really massive effect
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:17.760]  when there's enough time and energy put behind it.
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  And I think that's one place that, you know,
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.680]  this community really shines.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.640]  Is we've been able to really spread the love
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:35.520]  with this plant all over the world by, you know,
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.040]  sending seeds or sharing knowledge or, you know,
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.560]  sharing passion or teaching somebody
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.120]  how to take their first clone
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.800]  or teaching somebody what a female plant looks like
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.080]  instead of a male plant
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.480]  and allowing them to learn how to fish
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.960]  for the rest of their lives.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.960]  Like there are so many amazing things that come from us
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.120]  still having the desire to teach each other.
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.240]  And I think that that is a really special thing
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:07.320]  about this community in particular
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:12.320]  is that, you know, it was left in the dark for so long
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.440]  that it made people really thirsty for knowledge,
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.560]  but it also made people really innovative
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.640]  and really creative
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:27.120]  because the really amazing growers out there
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.680]  were not able to rely on the forums only
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:37.880]  or, you know, a grow Bible or whatever.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:39.880]  I mean, we had resources for sure.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.720]  And seriously big ups to Jorge
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  and the DJ Short and the other guys
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.120]  who put out those early texts about growing and breeding
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.640]  and like really came forward
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.080]  with what they were talking about
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.880]  and, you know, said, no,
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.600]  this information needs to be out there.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.400]  I'm gonna put it out there, period.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:13.000]  And like that took a whole lot of balls
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.760]  and a whole lot of work.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  And it's amazing how many people it helped.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.080]  But in order for us as a community
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.760]  to really get to the level where we are today,
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:33.040]  there had to be a lot more innovation.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.480]  There had to be a lot more understanding
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:40.520]  of organic soils and hydroponics at a scientific level
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.440]  of understanding nutrients
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.280]  and their sources of understanding the science
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.280]  behind microbes and different biological aspects
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.560]  of what we're doing
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.600]  and how all those things work together.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.720]  And, you know, this is another place
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.400]  where people like Jeff Lowenthal
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.480]  really helped the community a lot
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.240]  because, you know, even though he doesn't really,
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.000]  I feel like he's sort of talking about plants in general
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.240]  more than he is maybe about weed in general,
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:20.320]  but he was able to bring science to our community
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.160]  in a way that was understandable,
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:25.680]  that could be broken down, that could be applied.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.920]  And man, the weed got so much better, you know,
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.800]  like in any commercial or in any hydroponic sense,
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.520]  especially when you're doing something like cocoa,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.080]  drain to waste cocoa,
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:45.080]  where it's sort of like a mix between soil and hydroponics,
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.600]  any places where you can grow biology
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.840]  and you can further break down the minerals
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.400]  and you can expand the amount of food sources
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.680]  that go to the plant,
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.720]  the better the weed ends up turning out.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.120]  And so then when you take it to like an organic soil,
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.800]  where basically the plants, if you build the soil right,
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.600]  and you maintain the soil right,
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:20.080]  have the ability to have like an all you can eat buffet
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:21.840]  at all times of all the things
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.240]  that are going to be healthy for their growing bodies,
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.440]  then the kinds of expressions that you see
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.960]  are really phenomenal.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  And like, I always love comparing the plant to humans,
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:40.840]  especially since we're so close on most levels.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:45.640]  But when you look at hydroponics,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:47.880]  I feel like that's sort of like bodybuilding.
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:53.920]  And when you look at organics, it's more like Kung Fu.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.680]  Like in bodybuilding, and there's nothing wrong with this,
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:01.720]  there's nothing wrong with hydroponics, it's just different.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:08.040]  But you look at it where you're trying to really like
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.240]  feed the plant as aggressively as you possibly can
[01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.800]  and work it as aggressively as you possibly can.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:17.120]  You know, you're going to the gym 10 times a day
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:20.760]  and you're feeding it 14 canes of tuna a day.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.600]  And you're really pumping it up.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.600]  And you get big, you get big fricking buds, huge.
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:33.480]  You know, that are really massive
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.680]  and impressive in their own cool way.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.560]  But they're not nuanced in the same way.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:44.640]  You know, they have a really heavy upper half,
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:48.960]  but maybe they're not balanced across their body.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.120]  And then I feel like when you look at organics
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.560]  and you compare it more to something like Kung Fu
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:54:00.560]  or martial arts, you know, that's a situation
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.600]  where you're looking at the whole body, spirit and mind
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.240]  and everything else together in balance.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.400]  And organics is all about balance.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.800]  Understanding organics is really about understanding
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.800]  your balance within the system.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.640]  You cannot treat it like hydroponics,
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.920]  you cannot treat it like you are going to have
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.600]  any real effect over the plant at all.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.320]  The best you can hope to have any kind of effect on
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:27.640]  is the soil.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.560]  And then if you have a good effect on the soil,
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.880]  then the soil will feed the plant
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.880]  and everybody will be happy.
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.360]  But when you're looking at a more holistic approach
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:42.440]  at something where, you know, you're trying to feed the soil
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:45.160]  the best possible ingredients to be the best possible
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.680]  food source for the next thing,
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.320]  so that the plant can work its metabolism
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.920]  in its most efficient way.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:56.280]  Then the kind of expression that you see out of that
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.720]  is a seemingly healthier expression.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.600]  You know, like there doesn't seem to be balance,
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.960]  there's balance within the body, it's not unbalanced.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.200]  The plant seems to have a stronger tolerance
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.520]  to pests and diseases and everything else.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:20.520]  And so you just see this, a different approach
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.440]  that comes from organics, but one that tends to be,
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.880]  the outcome of it is not swollen, but it's rich.
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:41.440]  And I think that that's, you know,
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:46.360]  an interesting place to sort of start on talking about,
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.200]  you know, determining quality and really understanding
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.960]  the product that you're getting both as a patient
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:58.800]  and as a grower, you know, like,
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.360]  I think that like as a patient,
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.160]  every patient should know the difference
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:06.600]  between something that was grown in living soil
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.360]  and something that was grown in a flood and drain table.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.680]  And if you are really good at growing
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.600]  in a flood and drain table,
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:20.040]  then your product is gonna come out excellent
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.800]  and the patient is going to be just as happy
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.840]  as if it was grown in organic soil.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.600]  It just may have taken, you know,
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.200]  more resources to get there.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:32.800]  You can grow a really good product,
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.560]  but we're not really talking about quality most of the time
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.360]  when we go into dispensaries
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.600]  and we're talking to blood tenders,
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  we're talking about potency and we're talking about hype
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.600]  and we're talking about all these other things,
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.480]  but we're not talking about the flower.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.480]  We're not talking about the actual medicine.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.960]  We're not talking about how it was cured.
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.720]  We're not talking about how it was grown.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.280]  We're not talking about the IPM that was used for it.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:58.840]  We're not talking about the pressure
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:03.320]  that was experienced during that grow
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.480]  and how that might've changed the output of the plant.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.040]  Because if you don't know,
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:13.360]  whenever there's a pressure during the growth cycle,
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:18.120]  that changes the cannabinoid and terpene
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.440]  and flavonoid profile that comes out in the final product.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.000]  And, you know, just like in peppers,
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.360]  there are situations where you can make something
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.680]  more potent by being a bad grower.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.000]  You know, if you stress the plant out the whole time,
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.320]  you can get some really strong weed,
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:38.840]  but it's not generally balanced in the same way
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.920]  as something that was healthy and happy the whole time.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:44.920]  And there's something about the way
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:47.720]  that the balance comes out in the overall profile
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:50.040]  of the medicine that really matters.
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:54.040]  You know, when you're smoking the flower
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.840]  or the dab or whatever,
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.840]  and you get a full body experience,
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:04.160]  it's different than smoking a distillate pen,
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:10.120]  which is a very single phase type of high
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.800]  because it's only one compound.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.320]  You're not getting to experience the entourage effect of it
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:19.280]  or all the beauties that all these other cannabinoids
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.240]  and flavonoids, you know, play together with.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.040]  And so, you know, as selectors, as consumers,
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.160]  it's important for us to try different things.
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:31.280]  It's important for us to find things that we like
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.640]  and then determine why we like them.
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:36.200]  And then it's important for us to talk to each other
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:38.480]  about why those things matter
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.280]  so that when it gets back to the people
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.480]  who are making these strains,
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.160]  then we have that input
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:46.280]  in order to make a better product for you.
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:50.040]  Or if you wanna be a breeder, excellent.
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.480]  Please sit down and breed some stuff
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.240]  and, you know, determine what is gonna make
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.480]  a better product for you
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.880]  and how you can contribute to the society too.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.200]  Because at the end of the day,
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.080]  there's thousands and thousands and thousands of routes
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.200]  that this plant can go,
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.280]  thousands of projects that we can do with this.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:11.440]  And no one of us can do this alone.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:14.440]  And as a community, we can do it together.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:17.640]  And, you know, if we get out of each other's way
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:19.280]  and start sharing more knowledge
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:24.280]  and sharing more ability for people to get into this,
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.800]  then some of these amazing products
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:28.480]  that could maybe save our species
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:32.280]  or save, you know, our world or our civilization
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:34.360]  or who knows what,
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.360]  can be invented and created and put to market.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.200]  And if not, then maybe they won't.
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.040]  We don't know.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.920]  You know, it's hard to say.
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:47.120]  It's hard to say what will actually happen with that.
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:52.120]  But if we don't continue to like bring each other up
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.760]  in this community,
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:57.880]  then it stifles the creativity of the whole community.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:02.880]  So we need more of these individuals to find success.
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:05.640]  And it seems like they do go after these holy grails,
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:07.280]  trying to hit home runs.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:10.320]  Where we're, basically what I'm hearing from you today is
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.480]  if you're newer to this,
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.560]  you need to really hone in your skills
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.040]  of farming in general
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:18.800]  so that you're a fantastic farmer at first
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:20.800]  and then getting into the breeding aspects.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.320]  And if you can get into the living soil
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:25.080]  and maybe using that microbial world from day one,
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:28.440]  you might have an advantage to other individuals.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.480]  You know, you might not have that skillset yet,
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.080]  but you have that microbial world
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.400]  to kind of buffer when you make mistakes.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:35.840]  And so moving forward to that,
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:39.560]  how many different cultivars do you feel like you need
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:41.440]  to have a successful stable?
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.280]  Is it three?
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.120]  Is it five?
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:46.120]  And do you, obviously you need like backup of these
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:49.120]  and that kind of stuff when you're more on a,
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.200]  I can't make, I can't fail type of basis.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.120]  So what are your thoughts on basically
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:57.720]  on having how many different cultivars in your stable
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:58.960]  to find success?
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.280]  You need one to find success.
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.560]  You need one outstanding strain to find success.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.160]  Or you need three semi outstanding strains to find success.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.040]  You know, when you're building your stable,
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.040]  you will always find more success
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:27.480]  if you are consistently building your stable
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.160]  and you're consistently pheno hunting
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.600]  for something that is better.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.920]  The problem, you will also,
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.880]  and everybody who is a seed head will understand this,
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.680]  is there gets to be a point where there are some things
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:50.680]  that are unique for such completely different reasons
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.320]  that it's hard to kill them both.
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:56.440]  And so then you end up with more strains
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.600]  and then you end up with more strains
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:00.120]  and then you end up with more strains.
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:03.520]  For a commercial garden though,
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.200]  you need to look at the size of your room
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.880]  and you need to look at your potential output
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:13.880]  based on your regulations more than anything.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.600]  For example, in Oklahoma,
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.280]  we are required to test every 15 pounds.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:26.280]  So it's advantageous to be able to grow in 15 pound lots
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:28.920]  so that you can test 10 strains
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.560]  for the price of one essentially.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:34.320]  So there are a lot of different factors
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:38.040]  that go into how you pick your stable
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:39.800]  and what you keep in your stable.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.320]  But I think the one thing that is universal
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.600]  is that your stable is not gonna be good forever.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.280]  So there might be some strains that will be good forever.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.840]  Like I don't think that we're ever gonna be,
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.160]  we're ever gonna get rid of OG or sour diesel
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:00.360]  or blueberry.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.720]  There's like a handful of things
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:03.200]  that like if you can still find them,
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.720]  they're still considered to be really good.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.600]  But for the most part, a lot of people have moved on
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.120]  because a lot of them are harder to find.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:14.760]  You can find a million gelatos now
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:19.160]  and a million wedding cakes.
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:23.600]  So there's a lot of things that are real popular right now
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.440]  that the kind of flavor of the month,
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.200]  the things that people are interested in trying
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.040]  are going to continually change
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:39.560]  as the market develops
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.800]  and as the consumer knowledge really develops
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.600]  and the ability to try stuff is increased.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.400]  But I think that at the end of the day,
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.320]  you really need to pick based on
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.920]  what your consumers are telling you you like
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.280]  and what you like to produce for them.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.280]  Because there's gonna be a new flavor
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:04.040]  of the month every month.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.760]  And you can perpetually chase that forever
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.200]  and there will be success there.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.520]  But if you want to build a brand that,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.600]  especially in this industry,
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:20.080]  consistency is an absolute.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.560]  And being able to produce a consistent supply
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:27.680]  of really high quality flour that is unique to your market
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:31.360]  is how you should build your stable.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:34.520]  You should pick strains that people come in to buy
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:38.080]  and that you like growing.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:40.000]  If you like growing them and people come in
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.440]  and you're the only people that have it,
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.040]  then you've found the holy trilogy of selling weed.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.200]  Because at the end of the day,
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.760]  the market is set up for you that way.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:54.080]  Because they're not able to go anywhere else.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:54.920]  They have to come to you.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:57.200]  They like your product and you like producing it.
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:01.520]  So everybody is happy in that situation
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:03.720]  and the market will follow.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.400]  But if it's something that you hate growing,
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.120]  that people come in and they buy,
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:12.720]  but only if it's really good,
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.600]  well, then is that something
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.320]  that you can be consistent with?
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:22.000]  There has to be passion for you as the grower as well.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.800]  You have to enjoy growing the plant.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:28.520]  And as a commercial grower,
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.680]  you have to figure out how to find something
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:35.680]  that you enjoy growing and also is commercially viable.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.720]  Because if it's both,
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.040]  then eventually it's gonna catch up to you.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.240]  And eventually it's going to tear one side down.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.400]  Because everything has the benefit
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:48.400]  in order for it to move forward.
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:54.000]  So you gotta pick stuff that is real good for you
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.320]  and real good for your people.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.920]  And it doesn't have to be a lot of strains,
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.400]  but you need to be able to put them out consistently,
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:03.120]  whatever consistently looks like.
[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:06.600]  Yeah, great points, man.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.600]  I always say, I like to grow the plants
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.320]  that like to grow for me.
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.160]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:13.040]  There's something to that.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.240]  When a plant likes to grow for you
[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.880]  or you guys have a connection and it works out.
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:21.640]  I do say that, that's stable.
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.440]  You gotta constantly raise your own bar.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:24.360]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:26.920]  Things that you think are great,
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:29.560]  you gotta kind of let someone else look at it
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:31.120]  and try it and raise that bar
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.560]  and see if maybe it's time to move on
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:34.560]  or try something else.
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:38.280]  Like I had a nice breeder's cut, you know what I mean?
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.720]  But I got an S1 out of that.
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:42.200]  I grew that, I liked that better than the breeder's cut.
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:43.960]  So now I've got rid of the breeder's cut.
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:44.800]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:46.680]  It's just like, it's all about selection.
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.520]  You know what I mean?
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:51.120]  So yeah, man, everything you're saying makes a lot of sense.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.200]  I hope everybody is getting something out of this
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.560]  because I know I am, you know,
[02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:59.520]  just as far as the quality in, quality out.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:00.520]  You know what I mean?
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:02.840]  You know what I'm saying, MJ, you've grown this stuff.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:03.680]  You know what I mean?
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:04.680]  And you know the quality.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:07.040]  So why don't you speak a little bit on some of that too
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.840]  that you know and type in strains and everything.
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:14.080]  And talk about how more of like the underground part,
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:16.520]  like they want something different than the dispensary.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:20.560]  So you gotta really understand that market where you live.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:24.720]  And definitely, and being Denver,
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:27.280]  live, you know, living here in Denver where, you know,
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:29.600]  you can get weed anywhere.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:33.360]  It's always a good feeling to know that your friends
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:36.440]  and family can definitely come to town
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:39.160]  and, you know, partake and go on that.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:42.160]  But they can also look forward to coming to your house
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:44.240]  to partake in what you've grown.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:46.440]  And they're just as hyped about what you've grown
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.880]  is you're hyped about the person that bred it,
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:51.560]  like Rob, Nurse Genetics, you know what I mean?
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.420]  So it goes a long way to say, consistency is big.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:01.140]  You can go and grow seeds from anywhere.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.040]  That is your choice where you decide to get your seeds.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.680]  But my goal and my journey when I found Rob,
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.320]  that's what I'm gonna do,
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.560]  that I'm gonna go all the way with it.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.480]  I'm gonna be consistent with him.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.680]  I'm gonna do, you know, just run his strains.
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:17.380]  I wanna get to know him.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.240]  And before I do that, I don't wanna, you know,
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:21.760]  I wanna learn one thing first.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.800]  I don't wanna learn all these other strains right now.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.760]  I only wanna be consistent with what he's got going on.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:31.760]  So that's why I should say our friendship and our growth
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:35.160]  and how he mentors and gives free game out there
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.360]  is ridiculous.
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:39.400]  So why would I not want to be consistent
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:41.360]  with what he's got going on?
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.140]  We always say that too, man.
[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.000]  It's just, you're buying yourself time.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.440]  Like all that work that Rob's put in, like all these years,
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.680]  that's buying me time.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.880]  Now I don't have to do that work.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:54.920]  I can reap the benefits of him putting in that
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.600]  and getting his genetics, you know what I mean?
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.440]  And growing that out.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.560]  So that's another reason like a grower
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.160]  always has big respect for a breeder,
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.760]  especially when you hear that they're doing things
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.000]  the right way, because as a grower, you want some stability.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.880]  Like you like a challenge,
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:11.880]  but you don't want any surprises, you know what I mean?
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:14.800]  I want this shit to be right, at least going in the gate.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:17.520]  I don't want any, you know, intersex issues because,
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.240]  you know, now you're seeding up your stuff.
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:22.280]  So yeah, man, you look for that consistency.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:25.240]  And I liked that you said that MJ, like linking up,
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:27.040]  like you guys are linking, like, you know what I mean?
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.960]  You buying into what he's selling and it works.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:32.040]  And now it's just a cycle.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.360]  You're giving him feedback.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:36.000]  You told him you love that watermelon, you know,
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.840]  and that now you know why it's in there.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:40.240]  Like, this is all just building that community, man.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:42.160]  So, I mean, I think it's great, man.
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:43.520]  I think this is an awesome show.
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:45.200]  Appreciate y'all.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.040]  Keep it moving.
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:46.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:52.240]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.280]  I just wanted to get like, MJ,
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.240]  I just wanted to point out that,
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:59.360]  really more Rob of your work, buddy.
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:02.440]  So, you know, the only business is repeat business.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.760]  We've said that for a long, long time.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:05.760]  Our little peer group,
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.520]  that was kind of like our mantra, right?
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.960]  And especially when you're talking about
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:12.200]  in that gray market where you have to drive past
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.440]  probably a variety of different dispensaries,
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:16.680]  a bunch of different people that are also growing out
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.560]  of their basement,
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:20.200]  what's gonna make that individual wanna come to you?
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  And what I admire about MJ is,
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.600]  not only did he wanna create that network for himself,
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:25.600]  he's a master at that.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:28.160]  He's fantastic at networking and just being,
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:29.880]  but he also understood that I need to,
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.080]  basically, I need to know this plug
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.840]  so that when I'm running his stuff,
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.680]  I know that I'm gonna have something different.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:37.280]  I think that's what a lot of people miss
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:40.200]  is they're always chasing whatever's the coolest thing.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.000]  So by the time you get your girl up and running,
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.320]  you've been running through all your stuff,
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:46.000]  you find your thing,
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.040]  the community is off to whatever the next hype thing is.
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.360]  So here you are, you know,
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:53.600]  holding all of this fantastic cannabis in your mind
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.480]  and everybody's past that, they moved on.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.480]  So if you're focused in the gray market,
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.200]  you have to be actually one up on the community as a whole.
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:03.480]  You gotta be at every single expo.
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.520]  In my opinion, the best way to do that
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:07.600]  is to go around and look at all of the booths.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.040]  Who has the longest lines?
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.240]  Well, that's gonna be whoever the hype individual is.
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:13.400]  If you don't know anybody's name yet,
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:14.720]  just look at the lines.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:16.720]  And then I would like, like MJ is saying,
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:18.560]  he's going and he's finding the smaller booths
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.400]  when he's getting there.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.240]  He wants to find out, you know,
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.760]  what is this individual about?
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.480]  And there's so much talent out there
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.800]  that that's how, in my opinion,
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.120]  you're gonna be able to find
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.560]  and create something for yourself a lot easier
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:31.200]  than if you are always chasing the newest shiny thing.
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.120]  It's doing the work, but finding the work
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.000]  that people have already put their heart and soul into.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.400]  So that, you know, that canvas is already kind of a hit.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.080]  And as long as you continue to grow
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.100]  and you improve on your living soil skills,
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.120]  that's going to be a platinum hit, a gold hit,
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:46.800]  where people actually respect that.
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:48.520]  And that's something that you're easily after
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.480]  when you're trying to be a home grower
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.560]  or a commercial grower,
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:52.960]  is you have to have a little bit of clout
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.260]  for people to wanna put your stuff in your stores.
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:56.360]  That's just the way life is.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.060]  It's branding, however you wanna view it.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:11:59.860]  But in the gray world, that's clout.
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:02.820]  People wanna know that there's somebody else
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.020]  smoking your stuff.
[02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:05.740]  And once other people know that,
[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:07.020]  then they're gonna ride on that train.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.320]  And that's just how people are
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.900]  in the gray market, especially.
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:12.900]  And I got a comment on Robbie as well.
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:15.660]  Like when we first started or whatnot,
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:18.940]  he invited me to come up to Longmont.
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:20.220]  He stayed up in Longmont,
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:22.380]  had his own grow shop or whatnot.
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.380]  I'd come out, hang out or whatnot for a minute.
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.020]  And he was just like inviting me into his home.
[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:31.380]  For me, like he said, back in 14
[02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:32.220]  and them years like that,
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:33.700]  you couldn't get seeds out of nowhere.
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.140]  So for me to be able to say,
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.700]  I'm just gonna drive up here to Longmont
[02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:40.220]  or to Wyoming or somewhere and grab some seeds
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:41.300]  and I'm coming back home,
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.460]  that's a win-win for me.
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:46.340]  And I know I'm gonna get a ton more information
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:48.340]  than I could have probably got on internet
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:50.460]  or YouTube for a whole day listening.
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:52.500]  I could have went and sat with him
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:54.300]  and soaked up some game from him.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.620]  I'd have been straight to go.
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.380]  So that's the reason why I pick
[02:12:59.140 --> 02:13:01.740]  someone that's been consistent in the game.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:05.140]  It's not the big shiny name that's out there,
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:07.380]  but it's someone that had his passion
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:09.820]  and his story aligned in everything
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:11.700]  that I was listening to
[02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:14.740]  and everything that was deep and that was in my heart.
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.980]  A lot of the benefits of cannabis
[02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:20.540]  and things that helped him out
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.580]  and in running in high school
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:24.020]  and college and things like that.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:27.620]  So it's all about consistency, man.
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.620]  And love what you do and everything should come out all right.
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:37.380]  Well, what about when you do get that one hit wonder Rob?
[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:39.420]  Then what?
[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.980]  I mean, do you just let the streets speak for itself
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.260]  or do you kind of actively go out there
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:48.220]  and enter cups and try to get that notoriety?
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.660]  What's your thoughts on that?
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:55.340]  Well, that's building the business, right?
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:59.820]  It's certainly going out and entering cups
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:01.500]  and winning cups is a great way
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.380]  to gain notoriety in this game.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:11.860]  It is, it's its own game though.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:18.460]  Building the brand and building the breeding selection
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.380]  are two different games entirely.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:26.140]  And like you, it's challenging because they're very,
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:29.740]  you know, building your breeding collection
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:31.540]  and building the work that you're doing
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:34.740]  on the breeding side is a very slow game.
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.060]  It takes incredible amount of time
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:41.540]  and incredible amount of vision
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:44.620]  in order to be able to start from the beginning
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:46.940]  and try and make it happen
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:50.020]  and consistent enough to get to a point
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:51.980]  where you can actually get to a point
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:53.380]  of making it happen sometimes
[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:56.100]  because sometimes it doesn't happen on the first try.
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:02.260]  And then, you know, when you're looking at building a brand
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:06.340]  in a lot of ways, that's about being the loudest
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:09.260]  and about being able to get out in front of the most people
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.220]  and tell them, you know, like, this is the shit,
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:13.780]  you need to see it, it's awesome.
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:16.740]  And then if you have a product that backs that,
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.740]  because there's a lot of great weed out there,
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.220]  that could be the next hype strain.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:23.860]  But if you have both of those things,
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.580]  if you have something that's good enough to back it,
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.220]  but then you can also get out there
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:32.020]  and be on top of the world screaming from the rooftops,
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:33.900]  this strain is the next best thing,
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:37.500]  then there's a chance of your strain
[02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  being the next hype thing.
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:45.140]  And, you know, for a really long time,
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:50.260]  I was really not at all focused on what was going on
[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:57.780]  in the hype or the world of what was new in cannabis.
[02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:01.260]  I'm really still not.
[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:06.220]  Our breeding goal has always been the same.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:08.460]  We've been breeding for hash the whole time.
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:11.220]  That's what we've been looking for.
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:16.380]  My belief is hash has the most potential
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:21.380]  to bring consistent medicine to patients of all of the,
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:26.780]  whether it comes out in rosin or BHO or hexane
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:34.860]  or CO2 or ethanol,
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:39.860]  like they all create different versions of a medicine
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.100]  that can be utilized by patients
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:46.060]  and can be dosed more appropriately,
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:48.140]  certainly by patients.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:53.140]  And what's interesting where it has sort of aligned
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:57.580]  in the last couple of years is that the things that are hype
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:00.820]  are also the things that make better hash.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:03.580]  So like suddenly we've been working a lot more
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:06.980]  with some of the stuff that is hype in the industry
[02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:10.540]  because it aligned with our original goal,
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.180]  which was it made better hash.
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:16.260]  And so when we were working with the things
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:18.260]  that were gonna make better rosin,
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:23.540]  it's the hype strains, not the old stables
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:27.060]  that have those trichomes that come out
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:29.620]  and collect in massive numbers for fresh frozen.
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:34.220]  It's the stuff for the most part that we've made modern
[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:36.940]  in the last few years that really do it.
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:39.860]  And there's certain traits
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:42.020]  that are being bred for specifically
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.380]  that are based on cuts that people find
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.560]  that wash in incredible numbers.
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:52.460]  Strawn Anna, for example, was one of the first ones
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:55.580]  that people started to really see like,
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:59.420]  well, this produces amazing rosin and huge yields.
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:03.820]  And so there were people that have been able
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:08.820]  to take things like that and make their whole career
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:12.300]  on breeding for those strains and that's awesome.
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.640]  But suddenly that's the popular thing.
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:18.740]  And so it's really interesting to have kind of been
[02:18:18.740 --> 02:18:21.740]  in our own little hole for so many years
[02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:25.340]  and then all of a sudden be interacting
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:28.740]  in what is also popular in our industry
[02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:32.240]  because it's aligned with what we were already doing.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.860]  I got a question for you, man.
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.660]  It's one of those, here we go.
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:38.740]  I'm just gonna throw it out there.
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:43.740]  So is the rosin and hash to flower similar to the skater
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.340]  and only knowing how to do tricks
[02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:50.980]  versus learning how to skate?
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:53.260]  Is that similar?
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.420]  100,000%, 100 million percent even.
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:58.260]  Okay.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:03.420]  Because hash is the final expression of the plant.
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:10.100]  And so, especially when we're talking about solventless
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:14.980]  because when we're talking about hydrocarbon extraction,
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:19.100]  hydrocarbon extraction, butane, hexane, pentane,
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.900]  whatever, propane is a brute force extraction.
[02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:24.860]  You're pulling everything out of the plant
[02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:27.900]  and then recollecting it in another vessel.
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:30.180]  And so you're dissolving it completely
[02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:33.240]  and then recollecting it and bapping off the butane.
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:38.260]  In a solventless solution where you're going
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:40.100]  to ice water hash and you're either going
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:42.940]  to ice water hash as your final product
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:45.460]  or you're going to rosin as your final product.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:48.500]  You're talking about a process that requires you
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:52.420]  to have a more gentle touch with the plant.
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:55.620]  You're trying to finesse those trichome heads off
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:59.660]  of the plant in a way that doesn't break them,
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:01.600]  that doesn't destroy the beauty of them
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:04.240]  as a collected whole.
[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:10.860]  And so that in itself is a unique process of hash making
[02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:16.580]  that as a breeder is really unique
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:19.500]  because when we're talking about selecting for traits
[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:24.420]  of the trichome itself, then we're talking
[02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:27.940]  about something that is a totally different parameter
[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:30.960]  than we were selecting for when brute force
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:33.520]  was the way to extract.
[02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:39.540]  Because like, say when I met MJ, butane was really
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:45.340]  like that was the new hot thing on the market at the time.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:49.220]  And it was maybe not new, but it was really basically
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:52.220]  becoming a well-known thing in Colorado where we were.
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.380]  And so we were fascinated with it.
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:59.340]  And one of the things that we were breeding for
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.780]  were things that hashed in a higher number.
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:07.780]  So we would send it out to people that were really awesome
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.980]  who know who they are.
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:15.220]  And they would do that hashing for us
[02:21:15.220 --> 02:21:18.220]  and give us back yield results and numbers
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:19.260]  and things like that.
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:24.380]  And those would allow us to breed for that.
[02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:26.900]  And now to tie this all back into what
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:31.900]  the original question was, you can't express fully
[02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:37.060]  what the plant is going to do and get a good hash yield
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:38.820]  or a good hash final product
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:41.060]  if you didn't grow the weed good first.
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:45.820]  If you grow the best flower in the world
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:50.620]  and you take it to the hard time
[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:53.380]  that is appropriate for hash making,
[02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:55.060]  then you have the opportunity to make
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:56.980]  that best hash in the world.
[02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:59.980]  If you don't, it's biomass.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:02.660]  As a commenter described.
[02:22:04.100 --> 02:22:08.340]  So at the end of the day, it really comes back down
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:11.820]  to the farmer and it comes back down to the genetic.
[02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:14.780]  If the genetic has the potential to wash
[02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:19.780]  and the farmer really expresses that potential
[02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:25.460]  to the fullest extent, then the end product,
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:29.180]  the washed product has the potential to be as good
[02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:32.620]  as that plant can provide to the patient.
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:39.220]  And there's a circle that is capped at genetics.
[02:22:39.940 --> 02:22:44.940]  You know, like I like to use the example
[02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:49.020]  of Olympians in this conversation.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.460]  Cause when I ran cross country, we had a couple of guys
[02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:56.020]  on the team that were kids of Olympians
[02:22:56.020 --> 02:23:00.940]  and seemingly they were able to not train all season
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:02.460]  and still beat my ass.
[02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:07.340]  And so when you look at it in the plant world,
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:09.100]  the same thing tends to be true.
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:11.180]  If you have a really killer strain,
[02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:13.060]  like something that you would put up against
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:15.420]  any other strain and you breed it into something else
[02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.260]  that's pretty good, most of the time you're going
[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:20.620]  to get some things that come out of the next generation
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:21.460]  that are killer.
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:23.920]  And it may not be all of them.
[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:26.700]  That's where the selective breeding comes in.
[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.860]  But the likelihood that you'll get something really good
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:31.700]  in the next generation, if you started
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:34.500]  with something really good is really high.
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:38.620]  And the availability of genetics is sort of why
[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:42.540]  there can be so many seed companies out there
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:46.260]  and all of them be able to have good stuff.
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:49.620]  Because if everybody is being able to get the same GMO cut
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:51.620]  and the same wedding cake cut,
[02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:54.380]  and we're all breeding with same cuts,
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:57.940]  then the potential for us all to put out the same,
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:24:00.780]  you know, good thing that vein is real high.
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:06.620]  But what's unique about this plant is that there's
[02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:09.900]  so many different ways that you can take this.
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:14.900]  You know, you can focus on characteristics of land,
[02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:20.260]  land race plant and try and get a more holistic type of eye.
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:23.860]  You know, there's something that's really unique
[02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:26.380]  about those original land races.
[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:29.860]  And then the first generation of Dutch breed
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:34.860]  that happened in the, you know, 90s and early 2000s,
[02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:38.180]  where they were in those land races and them together
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:40.580]  and find, you know, what that first generations
[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:43.900]  of hybrids were that are really,
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:48.420]  they have, you know, compositions of different flavonoids
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:52.700]  and terpenes and cannabinoids that have been bred out
[02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:55.860]  in a lot of modern because we were aiming for THC
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:57.780]  or we were aiming for whatever.
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:02.860]  So depending on what place you wanna take with this,
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:08.500]  the plant allows you a lot of different roads to go down.
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:11.280]  But if you don't learn how to express the best expression
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.140]  out of the plant, you'll never be able to know
[02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:15.920]  how good your genetics are.
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.260]  Damn, well said.
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:24.260]  One thing I'm doing is I'm saying, okay,
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:27.060]  growing the best flower I can,
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:29.620]  herbs and everything for my taste, right?
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.300]  And others.
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:36.580]  And then if that plant is good for hash, that's a bonus.
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:38.620]  And that's just, like we said,
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:40.220]  everybody's gotta kind of have their own thing.
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:42.460]  So that's kind of the way I'm approaching it.
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:45.740]  And I think we cut off earlier.
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:50.740]  So I wanted to circle back to the Mendolithus I have going.
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:54.460]  So my plan was, now that we talked,
[02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:57.500]  I think I'm gonna hit the breeder back.
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:59.460]  Just ask what are the characteristics
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:02.380]  he was initially going for, right?
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:04.500]  Then I think I'm gonna dial in based on that
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:06.820]  instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:09.580]  And then I'll probably take some of that male pollen
[02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:12.660]  and just touch some of them just to get me some more seeds
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:15.780]  to kind of, I wanna re kind of work the line some more.
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:16.700]  How's that sound?
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:20.740]  Well, it sounds awesome.
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:23.020]  And actually one of the best things that you can do
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:25.220]  is hit a bunch of strains,
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:27.020]  because what it tells you then
[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:29.420]  is actually what the male does.
[02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:32.780]  So if you have female characteristics
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:34.620]  or have a bunch of different stuff,
[02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:36.300]  like you have one that tastes like garlic
[02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:37.420]  and one that tastes like lemon
[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:39.340]  and one that tastes like cherries,
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.700]  and you cross a male of it
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:44.580]  and the terpenes are the same category,
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:47.260]  then you know that whatever you cross that male to,
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:52.260]  it's going to probably show up as like a less dominant side
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:56.740]  on the terpenes than the female does for the most part.
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.460]  But what you get to find out
[02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:02.140]  is what characteristics the male brings forward into it.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:05.220]  And so the better you know the female,
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:06.940]  the easier it's going to be
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:09.780]  to select a male going forward
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:13.500]  because when you do your first breeding project,
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.380]  you're looking at all of the different characteristics
[02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:21.340]  and you can assess, did this come from mom?
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:22.500]  Did this come from dad?
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.420]  Or did this come from a previous generation?
[02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:28.860]  And the better you know the original parents,
[02:27:28.860 --> 02:27:30.100]  the easier that will be.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:31.980]  Yeah, boom.
[02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:33.540]  And that's why it takes so much time.
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:38.540]  So that's like for me, man, home grower, got time.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:41.780]  This is just going to be a slow, long process.
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.340]  Seeds, trying to keep them wild,
[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.180]  and that's all it's ever been for me is,
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:50.940]  but the difference now is that I've got the proven genetics
[02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:51.860]  that I have access to,
[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:54.420]  whereas before you were relying on
[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:56.740]  what could you get shipped in from wherever,
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:58.300]  hidden in what compartment,
[02:27:58.300 --> 02:28:00.940]  and if that was any good, you know what I'm saying?
[02:28:00.940 --> 02:28:03.460]  So since, I mean, these last few years
[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:04.580]  have really been wonderful.
[02:28:04.580 --> 02:28:06.220]  Like, I mean, people out there,
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.780]  if you're just starting growing,
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:10.900]  I think Rob alluded to this earlier,
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:12.540]  like it wasn't easy.
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:14.180]  So you guys are kind of spoiled.
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:16.540]  You have so much to choose from.
[02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:19.540]  So take your time and really find a good breeder
[02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:21.620]  that you like, find genetics that you like,
[02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:23.100]  and you can really dial in,
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.900]  find strains that you need.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.020]  Like if you're really down, low person,
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:30.060]  find that upbeat strain, you know, find,
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:33.060]  and if you're the opposite, find that opposite strain.
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:35.460]  It's out there now, and there's people that can tell you,
[02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:38.260]  you know, and back then it was like y'all said,
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:40.300]  you know, you just took whatever he had
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:41.820]  or whatever the guy had, you know, like,
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:42.660]  what do you got?
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:43.500]  Oh, you got some more of that?
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:44.460]  No, I don't have that.
[02:28:44.460 --> 02:28:45.460]  Damn, what you got?
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:47.860]  You know, like when they're asking for the other stuff,
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:50.260]  you know, you're going to kind of the wrong way,
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:52.340]  you know, with your growing.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:54.700]  So always keep them excited.
[02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:56.140]  Like, oh no, but I got this.
[02:28:56.140 --> 02:28:57.300]  Oh yeah, like that.
[02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.140]  You know what I mean?
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:00.900]  And always keep that stable fresh.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:01.740]  You know what I mean?
[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:04.100]  Keep that, keep the input in from people
[02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:06.340]  because I, you know, like I've had strains
[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:08.260]  where I'm like, I don't even care that,
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:10.100]  care for that, you know, whole bucket of it.
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:11.740]  Like, I don't really care for it.
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:13.620]  Well, let somebody else try it.
[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:14.740]  Damn, they love it.
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:15.740]  Now it gets hot.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:16.700]  Like, all right, cool.
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.540]  Y'all love that.
[02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:19.060]  It didn't work for me.
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:19.900]  Appreciate y'all.
[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:22.100]  So that kind of gives you more, you know,
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:23.700]  share your shit, you know,
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:24.780]  if you want to be out there,
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:27.460]  let people know what you got.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:29.020]  Let me say this to you, Marco,
[02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:31.140]  since you just brought that up,
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:32.660]  when you know, you have those strains,
[02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:35.620]  you're like, man, I grew six plants of this
[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:37.220]  and then they saying shit, man,
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.940]  like this ain't really doing up for me.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:41.620]  But like you said, it may not be what is doing,
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:44.220]  but the end product is going to the patient.
[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:45.580]  What is it going to do for them?
[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:47.860]  Maybe it didn't do so good for me with sleep
[02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:49.860]  and maybe for anxiety or this and that,
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:52.340]  but it worked wonders for them that they're shine,
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:53.500]  they're a shining star at work.
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:55.300]  They're on time now, they're alert,
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:58.180]  they're energetic, their mood has changed.
[02:29:58.180 --> 02:29:59.420]  They're positive now.
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:00.340]  You know,
[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.180]  Exactly.
[02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:02.820]  It ain't always about us, right?
[02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:04.780]  It ain't always about just us.
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:07.140]  But what I do keep is it going to be the best,
[02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:08.100]  you know, and always that,
[02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:10.620]  that's one thing don't cut your quality,
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:13.300]  you know, because I do have, you know,
[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:15.300]  like my dad's like, man, no, man,
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.380]  I still have too strong.
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:18.100]  Where's that other stuff?
[02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:19.140]  Where them trimmings at?
[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:20.020]  I want them trimmings.
[02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:20.860]  Yeah.
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:22.340]  The shake.
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.020]  And that's real talk, you know,
[02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:28.300]  and you know, one man's trimmings is another man's goals.
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:29.140]  Right.
[02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:32.180]  It's the same product is like,
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:33.420]  what is the, where's the convenience?
[02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:34.700]  Do you want to break down a bud
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:36.500]  or do you just want to see a nice little bud?
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:39.620]  Because the same thing is going to break down into.
[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:40.540]  There you go.
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:42.220]  You're going to get, you'll get yours.
[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:43.540]  He gets his.
[02:30:43.540 --> 02:30:44.380]  There you go.
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:46.140]  Everybody's happy with the same product.
[02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:47.540]  Wow.
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:50.580]  I was working with this company in Oklahoma
[02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:52.580]  and they had, they're pretty well funded.
[02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:55.620]  So they paid for this research, if you will,
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:57.740]  for people that were coming in,
[02:30:57.740 --> 02:30:58.900]  they had a soft opening.
[02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:01.260]  They were trying to find out what people wanted.
[02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:02.500]  They had four corners.
[02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:04.260]  So like one section would be for flower.
[02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:07.620]  I thought it pretty well thought out
[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:08.980]  for what they were trying to do.
[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:09.820]  Right.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:10.940]  So that they could kind of see like,
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:13.820]  all right, this, these certain individuals like flower,
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:15.860]  these certain individuals like dabs and all this.
[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:18.140]  What they found was at least for their location
[02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:20.460]  and the way that they were representing themselves
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:22.460]  is that the females were making most
[02:31:22.460 --> 02:31:25.060]  of the purchase decisions for the household,
[02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:27.980]  which meant that you would think that these OGs
[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:31.260]  and these heaviers would be what individuals wanted,
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:34.020]  but that individual wasn't there making the purchase.
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:36.100]  It was the wife of that individual
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:37.100]  that was making the purchase.
[02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:40.460]  So the fruity stuff shot up, the fancier stuff
[02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:42.540]  that might not, you know, the shinier stuff
[02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:45.660]  that might not necessarily be the highest THC,
[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:49.220]  you know, ladies, individuals, they like that kind of stuff.
[02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:52.620]  So when you're going into the commercial aspects of things,
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:54.940]  I think you need to also understand your market.
[02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:56.660]  And from a dispensary standpoint,
[02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:59.260]  you need to realize that for a lot of households,
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:00.500]  you know, the husband doesn't,
[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:02.820]  he doesn't have time to go to make that purchase.
[02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:06.060]  So the female aspect of what they like
[02:32:06.060 --> 02:32:08.740]  seems to impact overall sales,
[02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:10.500]  at least at, you know, a few dispensaries.
[02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:13.140]  And again, this place was represented as heightened.
[02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:14.940]  It would have been someplace that I feel like
[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.940]  a lot of nine to five individuals, male and female,
[02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:20.460]  would feel comfortable going in, asking questions.
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:22.500]  So they might've had their own little niche.
[02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:26.460]  But what I learned from being a part of that,
[02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:29.300]  you know, little exercise was that it's paramount
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:32.340]  in the gray market for you to do the same thing.
[02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:34.860]  And you have to realize that like,
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:37.380]  it doesn't matter necessarily what you like.
[02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:41.020]  Like if you're putting out fruity, you know,
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:44.420]  stuff that you and I necessarily want to put out,
[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:46.140]  but it's selling quickly
[02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:48.660]  and people are coming back asking for it by name,
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:51.500]  then that's something that is, I think in my opinion,
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:54.780]  is silly to almost like your ego
[02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:56.980]  is going to determine your pocketbook.
[02:32:56.980 --> 02:32:58.900]  If you're like, I'm onto the next thing,
[02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:00.260]  I don't grow that anymore.
[02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:03.180]  I saw that a lot of times here in Denver, MJ,
[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:05.100]  with like grapefruit and stuff.
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:06.700]  Some of the blue dreams,
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:08.460]  some of the older stuff that necessarily
[02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:11.580]  wasn't around anymore, but the nostalgia of it,
[02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:14.020]  like San Fernando Valley,
[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:16.460]  some of the stuff that you haven't heard of for a long time,
[02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:19.980]  but now if you have that, boy, you got that stable again.
[02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:21.500]  So think about all of those things,
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:23.420]  all that nostalgia aspects.
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:25.580]  You don't necessarily have to have the newest stuff
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:27.740]  to have the stuff that a lot of people
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:29.940]  with monetary means want.
[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:31.140]  And if they can smoke the stuff
[02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:33.260]  that reminds them of their youth,
[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:34.660]  that was always something that I felt like
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:36.500]  our peer group would focus on.
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:39.580]  The Durban Poisons, the Blue Dreams, the Golden Goats,
[02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:41.580]  the Gorilla Glues.
[02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:43.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:45.820]  And now, like you said, man,
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:48.780]  it's younger generation in this cannabis community
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:51.820]  and it is controlled by, I should say,
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:53.900]  more women than men, I should say,
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.420]  when it comes to, like you said,
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:56.740]  when it comes to sales or whatnot.
[02:33:56.740 --> 02:34:01.740]  So I don't know, man, it's kind of based on what you want,
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:03.620]  what's going to work for your body.
[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:05.460]  Rob, probably summed it up.
[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:08.460]  Well, I'll give you a realized example of that too.
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:10.820]  Like as far as the women goes,
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:13.060]  last year going to that competition,
[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:16.460]  I won a free entry to this cannabis cup.
[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:20.900]  And so I had two strains, I wasn't sure which one.
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:24.180]  And so I kind of was weighing it back and forth.
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:28.140]  And so I let my wife smell and she was like,
[02:34:28.140 --> 02:34:29.940]  oh, this one's nice, I like this one.
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:31.740]  And she smelled the other one and she said,
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.580]  oh, I don't know, that one smells
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:36.980]  like harsh cleaning chemicals, I don't like it.
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:39.180]  And fuck, that's the one I should have entered.
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:40.020]  You know what I mean?
[02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:42.220]  I entered the mild one, I went that way.
[02:34:43.220 --> 02:34:46.500]  But you gotta think about your audience, bro.
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:47.340]  You know what I mean?
[02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:48.420]  I should have went hardcore
[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:51.340]  and entered that hard gas chemical,
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:53.140]  like my gut told me, but I didn't.
[02:34:53.140 --> 02:34:54.940]  So moving on.
[02:34:56.780 --> 02:34:59.620]  Well, you know, it comes down to something
[02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:02.460]  that is interesting is in like,
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:04.900]  we used to do a People's Choice Award
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:06.060]  at this little competition
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:07.580]  that we would do up in Longmont.
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:12.100]  And the ones that won the People's Choice Award
[02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:16.140]  were almost always the strongest fruit.
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.340]  And the ones that won the reviewed one
[02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.100]  were almost always the gas.
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:24.180]  Peers like that gas.
[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:26.060]  Well, you know, I think-
[02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:26.940]  One second, Rob.
[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:29.340]  He just basically co-signed what I was saying,
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.700]  what those people paid for in Oklahoma,
[02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:34.980]  where it's the heavy fruit that's selling,
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.180]  even though that might necessarily be what you wanna grow.
[02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:40.580]  So Rob, you fell off, but we were talking just about that.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:42.220]  So you basically just...
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:44.740]  I love to see that when we're putting out information
[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:46.660]  that I think a lot of people can benefit from.
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:48.380]  And learning those things on the back end
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.460]  is how you make money.
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.780]  Well, and to me, some of those original strains
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:58.540]  are the best things that I have ever found.
[02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:01.260]  I've never been able to make anything
[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:04.380]  that was better than TK or original OG.
[02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:06.900]  Like I can't make that better.
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:09.700]  Everything that I breed with is different.
[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:10.900]  It's really awesome.
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:13.140]  I'm smoking TK right now in two days.
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:17.180]  But I can't make it better.
[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:18.660]  It's as good as it gets.
[02:36:19.740 --> 02:36:22.660]  And so, you know, I think that that's something
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.500]  that is always gonna be in my stable.
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.460]  I always try and keep like four in three different places
[02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:29.700]  just to make sure that we never ever lose it.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:34.740]  And that's part of keeping the stable too
[02:36:34.740 --> 02:36:36.980]  is believing in the plant that you like.
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:39.500]  Like I love Blue Dream.
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:41.860]  I don't care what anybody else says about it.
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:43.820]  I love Blue Dream.
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:46.300]  I'm just gonna go ahead and say it over and over again
[02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:48.340]  because I freaking love it.
[02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:49.620]  I love growing it.
[02:36:49.620 --> 02:36:50.900]  I love smoking it.
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:52.420]  I love smelling it.
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.380]  I love all of the parts about it.
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:57.700]  And I love that it is awesome for being a moneymaker too.
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:02.300]  But, you know, it's gotten a whole lot of hate
[02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:04.980]  for a whole lot of reasons over a lot of years.
[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:09.980]  And I kept it and now a lot of people wish that they had it.
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.100]  So there you go.
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:14.020]  That's a very good point.
[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:16.660]  It's almost like sometimes, you know how like
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:20.300]  the fashion industry shit repeats itself every few decades.
[02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:21.980]  Kind of seems that way with the cannabis
[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:23.540]  where like, you know, 10 years go by
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:26.460]  now everybody does want the classics
[02:37:26.460 --> 02:37:28.420]  and nobody seems to have the true classics.
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:30.700]  They have some kind of watered down version
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:33.340]  of stuff that people probably really could have
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.620]  made a difference with.
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:39.140]  And, you know, again, you shouted out Duke Diamond.
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:40.460]  You know, that's somebody that I feel like
[02:37:40.460 --> 02:37:42.300]  has a lot of those classics
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:45.340]  when he was unfortunately, you know,
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:46.980]  away from us for a while.
[02:37:46.980 --> 02:37:50.060]  I reached out to Rob and I just wanted to highlight that,
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:52.660]  that he was the first individual that got back to me
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:55.580]  and came heavy with the seeds to raise money for him.
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:57.340]  So I just want you guys to realize
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:37:59.740]  that Rob is not only looking out for the, you know,
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:01.900]  the little man as well, but he's helping individuals
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.940]  when, you know, sometimes the community can make a difference
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:07.820]  and he made a difference that day
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.900]  for what we were trying to do.
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:11.740]  So Rob, I really appreciate that, man.
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:14.700]  I mean, Duke's one of those that you want, you know,
[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:16.700]  if something happened to you, you just kind of have to help
[02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:18.740]  because you know that he'd be helping on the flip side
[02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:20.180]  if something happened to you.
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:22.220]  Well, he's been an amazing mentor to me
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:24.620]  in a lot of different ways.
[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:26.660]  You know, he's somebody that I've always looked up to
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:29.980]  as a breeder and as an organic grower.
[02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:32.260]  He's incredible at both.
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:37.860]  And he, I got the privilege of knowing him
[02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:43.780]  and he really, you know, lit a whole lot of fires
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:48.140]  in the creative side of breeding for me.
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:53.140]  The conversations that we had really put me down roads
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:56.500]  in both organic growing and in breeding
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:58.980]  that I'm still traveling today.
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:04.620]  And so like, you know, there's no way I can ever thank him
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:09.420]  for the way that he showed up for me all those times.
[02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:12.620]  You know, like best I can do is try and help him
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:16.260]  when he's in need, you know, and just shout out his name
[02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:18.300]  and tell everybody in the world.
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:20.020]  And like, if y'all don't know who this is,
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:21.580]  this dude's the truth.
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:24.300]  Go follow Duke Diamond
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:26.780]  or it's the real Duke Diamond now on Instagram.
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:29.940]  He's partnered up with another dude
[02:39:29.940 --> 02:39:32.580]  who is an unbelievable breeder
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:34.620]  that nobody knows about named Two.
[02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:40.300]  And like the two of them are gonna create some stuff
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:43.820]  that has the potential to be really powerful medicine,
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:45.780]  really, really unbelievable stuff.
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:49.900]  And I think it's interesting that you brought him back
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:53.700]  into the conversation because he's somebody
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:58.700]  that I really looked up to because of the collection
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:01.340]  that he had done over the years.
[02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:04.460]  You know, not only was he able to get some
[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:09.140]  of these real rare stuff, real, real rare strains,
[02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:12.500]  but he was able to keep them, which is an enormous feat.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.500]  If nobody has ever tried doing that,
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:18.020]  like, let me tell you, the amount of time and energy
[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:21.540]  and effort and money that goes into keeping a stable
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:23.900]  of moms is unbelievable.
[02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:27.100]  You would never guess how much it actually takes.
[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:31.500]  But the reality is that it's a tremendous amount of work.
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:34.020]  It's a tremendous dedication to the community.
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:37.660]  And because of it, there are things like Chem 91
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:38.700]  that are still around.
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:40.860]  There are things like TK that are still around.
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:43.420]  There are things like several diesel that are still around.
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.980]  There are things like Original NL that are still around
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:48.620]  because people did that work and God bless them for it
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:51.380]  because like, if they hadn't have done that work,
[02:40:51.380 --> 02:40:53.820]  then we wouldn't have it today.
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:55.780]  It would have gotten completely stomped out
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:58.820]  by the government when they wanted to put us in prohibition.
[02:40:58.820 --> 02:41:02.700]  But we as a community said, no, these are special.
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:03.900]  We're gonna keep these.
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:07.420]  And we kept them hidden underground for years
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:08.740]  until they could come out.
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:12.820]  Now we're reaping the benefit of all of that work
[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:15.220]  that all those people put in,
[02:41:15.220 --> 02:41:17.900]  that many people were incarcerated for,
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:19.780]  that people lost their lives for,
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:21.620]  that people lost their freedom for.
[02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:24.020]  You know, like every person out there
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:26.340]  who is investing in a weed company,
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:27.940]  you better be doing something.
[02:41:27.940 --> 02:41:32.180]  If you weren't part of the process before this,
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:35.380]  then I hope you're doing something to help people who were.
[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:37.380]  Because at the end of the day,
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:40.060]  a lot of people put their lives on the line
[02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:42.500]  so that you could drive a Bentley
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:45.340]  or whatever it is that you have found success for
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  in this industry.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:50.540]  Because if it was you, then that's awesome.
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:51.380]  Good for you.
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:52.900]  You deserve to reap those benefits.
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:55.900]  If it wasn't you, then you better help out somebody
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:57.420]  who lost their lives to this
[02:41:57.420 --> 02:42:00.260]  because you don't deserve to just reap those benefits
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:02.060]  and not pay respect to the people
[02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:03.500]  who kept this plant alive.
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:07.340]  Amen to that, brother.
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:09.020]  Especially individuals you know.
[02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:11.140]  When you mentioned that,
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:14.100]  I'd love to highlight too, for that reason.
[02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:16.460]  I don't think a lot of people
[02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:18.020]  might necessarily know who that is,
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:21.380]  but he was the brains behind Charlotte's Web.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:23.660]  And just like a lot of stuff where, you know,
[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:26.860]  the original artist, if you will, canvas creator,
[02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:31.900]  allegedly other people took that from him.
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:34.220]  You know, he's willing to tell his story, I would imagine.
[02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:36.900]  But yeah, it's a fucked up world.
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:41.900]  And Colorado has so many bright-minded individuals,
[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:44.860]  even in the kind of the two world, the MJ world,
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:48.700]  where I hope that more people start to see that.
[02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:51.140]  A lot of the real medicine is coming
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:52.940]  from just a few individuals.
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:56.940]  It's not like there's just all of these bright-minded people
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:42:57.860]  until recently.
[02:42:57.860 --> 02:43:00.300]  Like beforehand, there was some people
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:02.140]  that were just kind of like known
[02:43:02.140 --> 02:43:04.140]  because they were putting out medicine like that.
[02:43:04.140 --> 02:43:05.100]  And two was one of them.
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:07.060]  So do you mind kind of sharing a little bit?
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.620]  I know you know more than me about that individual,
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:13.700]  but his moniker, if you will, is definitely,
[02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:17.060]  you know, it's well-known here in Colorado.
[02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:18.180]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:22.100]  You know, I am not the right person
[02:43:22.100 --> 02:43:25.580]  to tell his story for sure,
[02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:30.580]  but I will say that the legend has it that,
[02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:34.380]  and I've met the dude.
[02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:36.100]  He's the nicest dude.
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:42.100]  But legend has it that he created this strain called,
[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:48.580]  I believe, woo is what it was originally called.
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:54.700]  And there was a nefarious act of some sort
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:57.980]  that happened when there was a parting of ways
[02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:00.620]  in which this really incredible strain,
[02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:05.620]  which later sort of became Charlotte's Web,
[02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:09.420]  got renamed to R4.
[02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:11.820]  So there are a lot of people out there
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:15.140]  because as I have heard the story,
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:16.820]  they couldn't read the tag
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:19.780]  and they thought woo said R4.
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:24.780]  So that was what it got put out as for a long time.
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:30.620]  And then that strain tended to produce seeds.
[02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:34.140]  So from what I understand,
[02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:39.140]  Charlotte's Web was a seed from that original R4 strain.
[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:42.860]  Now, again, this is not my story to tell.
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:45.420]  I hope that you can have two on the podcast
[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:49.260]  to really tell this story because it's worth hearing,
[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:53.700]  especially if anybody is interested in CBD
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:58.460]  or interested in breeding rights
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:02.580]  because there's a lot to his story that is noteworthy.
[02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:08.300]  But Charlotte's Web is the basis basically
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:11.260]  for every CBD thing.
[02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:13.660]  I mean, there's a little bit,
[02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:17.740]  that's not a totally true blanket statement,
[02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:20.740]  but the reality is that almost everything
[02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:22.340]  that comes from the CBD world
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:25.140]  came from Charlotte's Web somewhere along the way
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:27.220]  or R4 more appropriately.
[02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:33.820]  And so, his influence on the nation
[02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:39.140]  and cannabis in general is so immense.
[02:45:39.140 --> 02:45:41.060]  And the fact that nobody knows who he is
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:45.580]  or very few people know who he is, is really unfair
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:49.780]  because his contribution with just that strain alone
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:51.060]  is so incredible,
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:54.500]  not to mention all of the other work that he's done.
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:58.660]  And I know he's done a tremendous amount of work in CBD
[02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:02.780]  and other cannabinoids and doing stuff to promote
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:06.620]  real medicine for real patients.
[02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:09.740]  And so, big ups to that dude for sure
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:11.820]  because he's been at it a long time
[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:15.820]  and has been persecuted in a number of ways
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:18.100]  and deserves to have his flowers as well.
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:21.580]  Amen.
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:22.580]  Yeah, well said, man,
[02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:25.980]  because sometimes people might not even be seeking
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:27.180]  recognition for that,
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:29.060]  but I think more people need to realize
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:32.780]  that the medicine came from the underground world,
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:33.820]  from the gray market.
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:36.340]  That's where the real work was being done
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:37.620]  for a long, long time.
[02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:40.820]  And two, and people like him
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:43.900]  deserve to have a small spotlight if they don't want one,
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:45.940]  and then a bigger spotlight if they do,
[02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:48.780]  just so that others can kind of pay those respects
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:52.180]  and realize that it took a long time to,
[02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:53.420]  like Marco was kind of getting at,
[02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:56.940]  it took a long time to get where you can just go
[02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:58.540]  and get a pack of seeds and grow
[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:00.940]  and put it up on Instagram and YouTube
[02:47:00.940 --> 02:47:04.380]  and not feel the bit about anybody's coming after you
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:06.620]  because you're such small time individual
[02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:07.740]  that it doesn't matter.
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:10.020]  Back, even in like 2014,
[02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:11.820]  I mean, I don't necessarily know
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:14.380]  if I was showing my face back then, MJ.
[02:47:14.380 --> 02:47:16.940]  I mean, there was still too many things that were going on
[02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:18.860]  where it didn't make sense to do that,
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:21.020]  where you could at least, you could put out material,
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:23.540]  but why would you want people to know who you were?
[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:24.980]  So a lot has come.
[02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:29.700]  And someone else that I wanna mention in that vein
[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:33.940]  who is not attached to those guys,
[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:37.940]  but was also doing a lot of really interesting work
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:39.620]  in those early years in Colorado
[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:43.900]  was the guys behind 303 Seeds.
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:47.820]  And I don't know where they are in the industry
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:49.380]  or how they wanna be recognized,
[02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:51.740]  so I'm not going to put their information out there,
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:54.140]  but I am gonna say that they also
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:56.700]  did a tremendous amount of work
[02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:01.700]  to bringing CBD to a consumable market.
[02:48:02.140 --> 02:48:05.740]  And I'm not sure that they got the flowers
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:08.540]  that they deserved for that effort either.
[02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:12.940]  So, but they're the guys behind Spectrum 65
[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:15.180]  or Spectrum just in general,
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:19.900]  and the CBD side,
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:24.340]  and then so many awesome THC strains,
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:26.620]  like more than I can count.
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:30.740]  And they also were one of the first people in Colorado
[02:48:30.740 --> 02:48:32.980]  to try and use the metric system
[02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:35.940]  and the legal cannabis market
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:39.900]  to produce seeds within the legal cannabis market.
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:44.500]  And so that in general is a real unique thing
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:47.540]  because they sort of tried something
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:49.740]  everybody else was scared to do, so.
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:54.320]  You're on a roll, man.
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:56.640]  Yeah, it's nice to recognize the people
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:57.680]  that have done it before you,
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:59.160]  and I think if you don't do that,
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:01.440]  then shame on you,
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:04.520]  because I guess you don't really understand what it took.
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:06.880]  There's a few questions here that we could kind of go over
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:08.760]  and then out of respect for everybody's time,
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:11.000]  we're gonna try to keep these dialed in
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.200]  to no more than three hours.
[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.960]  So I wanted to kind of get to a few of these questions.
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.640]  The first one was from Tyler,
[02:49:17.640 --> 02:49:20.160]  and I think this might take a few minutes
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:21.080]  to kind of talk about,
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:24.680]  but it says, it might be Tyler from Grassroots Fabric Pots,
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:26.320]  it might be controversial subject,
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.760]  but I've learned the hollow stem is a nutrient deficiency.
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:32.160]  We can see this in sap and tissue testing,
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:36.720]  calcium, boron, foiler sprays fit it in.
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:38.280]  What are your thoughts on that?
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:40.880]  Yeah, he's not wrong.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:45.280]  It's one of those things that,
[02:49:49.720 --> 02:49:52.800]  this is a part where like the breeding is art,
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:56.760]  and maybe the science,
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:00.480]  my understanding might not be well or strong enough
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.960]  in this subject in order to really explain
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:06.880]  what's going on here.
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:12.680]  But I believe that that is 100% true
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:14.920]  that it is a nutrient deficiency,
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:16.840]  but it seems to be a nutrient deficiency
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:19.440]  caused by extreme growth.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:22.800]  So, like in similar instances
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:25.400]  where one plant is growing slower,
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:28.600]  it's not nutrient deficient in the same soil,
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:31.040]  but something that is growing extremely fast
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:32.520]  and is showing amazing vigor
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.640]  will be nutrient deficient faster in it.
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:40.560]  So, it's not something that we look for
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:41.680]  in the clone generation,
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:44.160]  and I mentioned that a little bit earlier,
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:46.520]  was that like when we get to the clone generation,
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  for the most part, having hollow stems is not a good thing
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:51.440]  because as Tyler is mentioning,
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.320]  that's a situation where you're not able
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:55.600]  to feed the plant enough.
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:51:02.200]  But it's something that we look for in our seed generation
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:04.800]  because we're looking for those signs of vigor.
[02:51:04.800 --> 02:51:07.040]  And so, since we put them in a situation
[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:09.680]  where everybody is fed the same thing,
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:13.080]  the ones that are hungriest fast
[02:51:13.080 --> 02:51:16.920]  is a sign of something that we are looking for.
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:21.220]  So, it's not a plant health thing in that situation.
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:26.480]  Marco or MJ, you guys wanna add to any of that?
[02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:27.760]  Yeah, it makes sense, man.
[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:30.640]  I noticed that, I do notice that the plants
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:34.600]  with the hollow main stems, at the clone tip level,
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:36.760]  that hollowness is not there.
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:38.220]  I do notice that.
[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:42.840]  And yeah, I can't remember the last time
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:45.120]  I took a clone with a hollow stem.
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:46.400]  You know what I mean?
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:47.240]  I think like-
[02:51:47.240 --> 02:51:48.960]  They were almost never ripped.
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:50.040]  Right, exactly.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:51.360]  Yeah, it would be worthless.
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:52.800]  But yeah, so like you're saying,
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:55.280]  I think like you said in that seed generation,
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:58.960]  like right off from seed, I get that and I like that.
[02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:00.520]  It makes a lot of sense.
[02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:02.480]  Plants probably outgrowing the amount
[02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:05.960]  it can even take in as far as those deficient nutrients
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:08.960]  he mentioned, calcium and boron.
[02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:11.560]  Yeah, I mean, if they're deficient in calcium and boron
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:15.460]  in the first three weeks or a veg,
[02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:19.240]  then they are eating like crazy and that's awesome.
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:21.720]  So, you know, that's something that we're looking for.
[02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:26.720]  And I think that it's just one of those things
[02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:32.160]  that we noticed originally when we were doing
[02:52:34.280 --> 02:52:36.480]  all these pheno hunts of all of these different seeds
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.520]  is that a lot of the things that we kept
[02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:39.840]  were the things that were hollow
[02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:41.400]  when they were coming up.
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:45.360]  And so, you know, like to go back to the art part of this,
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:47.040]  that was a place where, you know,
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:49.080]  just our observation was telling us
[02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:51.840]  that this is going to be a stronger plant over time.
[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:55.480]  But how I have justified it through science
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:56.760]  is what we just talked about.
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:53:01.760]  So I have learned that that is a deficiency,
[02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:05.960]  but again, we don't really, we try,
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:09.160]  we only use that technique in the seed stage
[02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:11.680]  and not in any clone generation or anything
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:13.480]  where we're trying for plant health.
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:18.520]  Later on, we can't be, is it safe to say
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.760]  we could look into it both ways
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:25.240]  and say it's not necessarily a deficiency
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.440]  or could we kind of look at both ways and say,
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:29.840]  can we rule something out to say
[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:32.400]  it's not a deficiency versus-
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:34.560]  No, you know, I think it is a deficiency.
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:36.720]  I think that that's 100% right.
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:38.960]  And just for exactly the reasons
[02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:41.920]  that we were talking with Marco about
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:46.120]  is like you will almost never get a hollow rooted clone
[02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:49.720]  to, you know, like if the stem is hollow
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:51.000]  and you're cutting off of something
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:54.400]  that's growing really fast and it's hollow in the middle,
[02:53:54.400 --> 02:53:56.440]  then that clone is worthless.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:53:59.720]  Like you can put it in, but almost always they don't root.
[02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:01.560]  Sometimes they will in an aero cloner,
[02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:06.560]  but for the most part, those are the ones that die off first.
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:10.680]  And then after they've rooted, if they do root,
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:12.720]  they seem to be the weakest ones.
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:16.160]  So, you know, if they started from a deficient plant,
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:17.480]  a plant that wasn't healthy,
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:19.440]  then like it's not gonna make a good clone
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:22.040]  in the next generation.
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:25.000]  And you see that with all sorts of other deficiencies.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.920]  And now when we're, since we're running a clone business,
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:31.520]  that's another like aspect of the game
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.720]  where we're learning so much more
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:35.780]  because of the way we've interacted
[02:54:35.780 --> 02:54:37.720]  with commercial cannabis.
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.800]  But this is a whole nother part of it.
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:43.200]  Anyway, when you see deficiencies in the plant,
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:44.620]  like if you're seeing purple stems,
[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:46.000]  if you're seeing small leaves,
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.320]  if you're seeing all these things
[02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:50.140]  that are not showing healthy growth,
[02:54:50.140 --> 02:54:53.700]  including, you know, big fat hollow stems,
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:56.580]  then you're gonna have a hard time with your clone success.
[02:54:56.580 --> 02:55:01.580]  And so I think that Tyler's like 100% right.
[02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:06.460]  It's just, we applied it in a different way.
[02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:08.180]  Okay.
[02:55:08.180 --> 02:55:10.620]  And when this happens, is it safe to say
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:13.720]  we should just go ahead and get rid of it now or?
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:15.500]  No, you should treat it a lot of different things.
[02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:16.540]  First time or?
[02:55:19.710 --> 02:55:23.270]  Yeah, I mean, I think that when you're looking at it
[02:55:23.270 --> 02:55:26.350]  as a grower's perspective, like, you know,
[02:55:26.350 --> 02:55:28.790]  like when you're trying to produce the best flowers
[02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:32.150]  you possibly can, then you wanna be able to baby it.
[02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:34.470]  I mean, if it's in the first pheno hunt run
[02:55:34.470 --> 02:55:36.350]  where you're just trying to figure out what you have,
[02:55:36.350 --> 02:55:40.710]  then that's not somewhere where you need to like try
[02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:42.650]  and cater to that plant.
[02:55:42.650 --> 02:55:44.310]  But if you're gonna put it in your stable
[02:55:44.310 --> 02:55:45.390]  and you love it that much,
[02:55:45.390 --> 02:55:46.630]  you're gonna be growing it a lot,
[02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:48.830]  and you need to figure out what it wants,
[02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:51.430]  and you need to be able to work in harmony with it.
[02:55:52.590 --> 02:55:56.170]  And so, you know, I think that that's a place
[02:55:56.170 --> 02:55:57.750]  where understanding that, okay,
[02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:59.430]  if I feed it more micronutrients,
[02:55:59.430 --> 02:56:01.230]  so I feed it more calcium and boron,
[02:56:01.230 --> 02:56:04.950]  and I feed it, you know, micronutrients in general
[02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:07.590]  are often lacked in calcium nutrients,
[02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:10.630]  but are in cannabis nutrients.
[02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:12.030]  But that's a whole nother topic
[02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:13.910]  that we could go and talk about for hours.
[02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:15.350]  And so we're not gonna.
[02:56:15.350 --> 02:56:19.110]  But in those cases, if you can determine,
[02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:22.110]  you can use that as a determining factor as a grower
[02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:24.670]  and say, oh, I'm looking at this hollow stem.
[02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:29.030]  I probably need more micronutrients to, you know,
[02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:32.110]  change the growth pattern of this
[02:56:32.110 --> 02:56:35.110]  so that it gets a more efficient delivery
[02:56:37.390 --> 02:56:40.830]  of each of these nutrients that it needs,
[02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:43.270]  which are frequently based on
[02:56:45.350 --> 02:56:47.430]  inadequate amount of micronutrients,
[02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:51.510]  which is another reason why organics is awesome.
[02:56:51.510 --> 02:56:56.510]  But anyway, the, yeah, that's the thing.
[02:56:58.230 --> 02:57:00.670]  Like if you can be a grower and you can determine
[02:57:00.670 --> 02:57:02.590]  what the plant wants by what it's showing you,
[02:57:02.590 --> 02:57:03.910]  then you're gonna be a better grower,
[02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:05.910]  and then you're going to be able to show
[02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:07.550]  a better expression of what it is,
[02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:09.710]  and you'll make better hash, you'll make better flour,
[02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:11.550]  you'll make better medicine, period.
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:16.120]  Hippie Zombie wants to know,
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:18.520]  why don't breeders put on the F
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:20.400]  and then the number on their seeds?
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:23.440]  Because they're almost always F1s.
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:25.640]  Boom.
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.520]  99% of the time.
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:31.160]  99% of the time they're F1s.
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:33.120]  If they're not F1s,
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:35.320]  then the breeder probably puts it on there.
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:39.880]  And the reality is that there's a lot of work
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:43.520]  that goes into taking a strain to a next generation.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:46.320]  Like when you say, oh, I want to make F2s.
[02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:47.320]  That sounds simple,
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.480]  but you just committed a year of your life
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:50.840]  and a year of your resources
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:52.160]  and a year of your grow space
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:53.840]  and a year of your everything.
[02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:56.200]  If you want to go to F3, that can...
[02:58:00.370 --> 02:58:02.570]  Man, when he drops the bars,
[02:58:02.570 --> 02:58:04.330]  that's when they cut them off, huh?
[02:58:06.930 --> 02:58:07.770]  Can you guys hear that?
[02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:09.090]  Cold bar.
[02:58:09.090 --> 02:58:09.930]  No.
[02:58:09.930 --> 02:58:10.770]  Thank you.
[02:58:10.770 --> 02:58:12.810]  That's because everything he says is a bar.
[02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:17.090]  Everything he says is a bar.
[02:58:17.090 --> 02:58:18.570]  Wow.
[02:58:18.570 --> 02:58:19.770]  It's crazy.
[02:58:19.770 --> 02:58:21.530]  But he's humble enough to where it's like,
[02:58:21.530 --> 02:58:23.210]  all right, man, I'll sit here and listen to you.
[02:58:23.210 --> 02:58:24.850]  Because sometimes people have that knowledge
[02:58:24.850 --> 02:58:26.730]  and it's like, they just keep...
[02:58:26.730 --> 02:58:28.970]  It's too much where you're like, all right, man, I get it.
[02:58:28.970 --> 02:58:30.890]  You're the king of cannabis, dude.
[02:58:30.890 --> 02:58:31.970]  You invented it.
[02:58:31.970 --> 02:58:32.810]  Yeah.
[02:58:32.810 --> 02:58:34.570]  Where he's more just like, hey, this is how it is.
[02:58:34.570 --> 02:58:35.410]  Smoke it.
[02:58:35.410 --> 02:58:38.410]  And then obviously the grow off and other individuals
[02:58:38.410 --> 02:58:41.770]  and the gray market kind of speaks to me.
[02:58:41.770 --> 02:58:45.090]  That speaks for volumes over really anything else.
[02:58:45.090 --> 02:58:49.210]  Is if people want to come purchase that product
[02:58:49.210 --> 02:58:52.050]  and then come and ask for it by name again.
[02:58:52.050 --> 02:58:54.730]  And I think Blue Dreams is one of those originals
[02:58:54.730 --> 02:58:55.850]  that people felt that way.
[02:58:55.850 --> 02:58:58.490]  And maybe it gets a bad rap for a variety of reasons,
[02:58:58.490 --> 02:59:01.730]  but that paid the mortgage for a lot of people.
[02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:03.250]  And I think that's...
[02:59:03.250 --> 02:59:04.930]  And people wanted it.
[02:59:04.930 --> 02:59:05.930]  Yeah, people wanted it.
[02:59:05.930 --> 02:59:09.650]  So it crossed the boxes for some people on all things
[02:59:09.650 --> 02:59:10.970]  because it made money.
[02:59:11.450 --> 02:59:13.610]  And then it was also being asked for.
[02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:16.290]  And so, especially back then in the early days,
[02:59:16.290 --> 02:59:17.810]  you would just grow a bunch of cannabis
[02:59:17.810 --> 02:59:19.410]  and then you'd hope people want it.
[02:59:19.410 --> 02:59:22.770]  And the unscrupulous type people sometimes
[02:59:22.770 --> 02:59:26.290]  would just make whatever you asked for.
[02:59:26.290 --> 02:59:27.570]  That's what they had.
[02:59:27.570 --> 02:59:30.810]  And I think that now the consumer knows the bullshit.
[02:59:30.810 --> 02:59:33.170]  So if you have Durban poison,
[02:59:33.170 --> 02:59:36.370]  I think most people know that it has a very unique smell.
[02:59:36.370 --> 02:59:38.250]  That the buds are usually a little bit bigger
[02:59:38.250 --> 02:59:39.170]  like a Blue Dream.
[02:59:39.210 --> 02:59:41.130]  So if you got small little nugs
[02:59:41.130 --> 02:59:42.570]  that smell like something else,
[02:59:42.570 --> 02:59:44.770]  then obviously this person's playing games with you.
[02:59:44.770 --> 02:59:48.290]  So there's a lot to just being educated,
[02:59:48.290 --> 02:59:50.290]  obviously in those days for flower.
[02:59:50.290 --> 02:59:53.130]  And I'm bringing this up because I think more people,
[02:59:53.130 --> 02:59:55.010]  it's the same thing now with seeds.
[02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:57.130]  So that you realize that I think a lot of people
[02:59:57.130 --> 03:00:01.210]  can get misled or think that if I spend $500 on F1s,
[03:00:01.210 --> 03:00:03.890]  that means that I have some kind of magic in a bag.
[03:00:03.890 --> 03:00:04.850]  And it's really more,
[03:00:04.850 --> 03:00:07.290]  you just bought a $500 lottery ticket.
[03:00:07.290 --> 03:00:08.130]  Boom.
[03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:12.600]  100%.
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:13.600]  Sorry, I muted myself.
[03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:15.640]  This one's for Marco actually.
[03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:18.040]  So Hash Slingin' Hasher.
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:18.880]  I like that.
[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:21.000]  How can I legally collect IMO around me?
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:25.040]  I'm in the city, but I can find some bushes around a trail.
[03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:29.880]  Okay, well, my rules are the healthiest,
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:34.880]  most diverse forest area closest to you
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.320]  or vegetation closest to you.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:38.520]  So whatever you have,
[03:00:38.800 --> 03:00:41.800]  if that's the closest, if it's away from streets,
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:43.640]  if it's somewhere that's secluded,
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:45.760]  away from motor traffic and that kind of stuff,
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:47.400]  give it a shot.
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:50.320]  You can also collect IMO indoors.
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:51.760]  You're kind of collecting what you have,
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:54.440]  but at least it's familiarizing you with the process.
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:00:58.120]  Sometimes you have to just take a little short drive,
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:00.280]  find a park in your area.
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:01.360]  Baseball fields.
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:04.000]  A lot of times, that land right behind the baseball
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:05.960]  and the football fields, that woods back there,
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:09.080]  it's all usually county owned, but no one goes back there.
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:10.920]  Those could be good places to go to.
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:13.640]  Keep an open mind.
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:15.880]  Bars for you, Marco.
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:17.240]  Bars for you, Marco.
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:18.080]  Damn it.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:18.920]  Hey, thank you.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:22.480]  Yeah, he's always bringing that.
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:23.560]  Here's the last question.
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:25.760]  And like I said, we're gonna really respect people's time.
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:27.680]  So we wanna keep this quick
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:30.480]  and then we'll keep it moving for next week.
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:33.360]  But yeah, they wanna know, how is Nerds Outdoors, Rob?
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:39.160]  So we've been able to test
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:41.520]  in a bunch of different environments now.
[03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:44.760]  And normally what we've found is anything that we test
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:48.280]  indoors generally tests well outdoors,
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:51.200]  but doesn't mean it's necessarily a winner.
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:53.120]  So there are certain strains that we have found
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.240]  that are better than others for outdoor cultivation.
[03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:03.040]  But it's really dependent on what you're looking for.
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:05.280]  Like some of the strains that we've made
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:09.040]  are very resistant to pest and disease
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.440]  and do great outdoors as far as yield go.
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:19.440]  And a lot of the woody crosses are excellent
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.520]  because they finish super fast.
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:25.760]  They're all one of the first things that start to flower
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:26.840]  and then one of the first things
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:29.240]  that finish flower in the season.
[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:33.160]  So if you're in a place where time pressure is a thing,
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:35.600]  then that matters.
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:37.120]  But it's a hard question to answer
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:41.280]  because growing things in Colorado was so wildly different
[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:42.800]  than growing things in Oklahoma,
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:44.040]  which is so wildly different
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:46.320]  than growing things in California.
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:49.600]  So depending on how your environment is,
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:51.400]  there are certain things that are gonna be better
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:56.400]  for humidity, arid climates, longer days, shorter days,
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:01.240]  higher, more or less stress than others.
[03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:04.160]  And it's a real broad question.
[03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:06.000]  So I apologize for that.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:09.520]  But the short answer is that some of them
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:11.000]  do really, really well.
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:15.720]  Certainly we had some plants that were 15 feet
[03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:18.740]  in June this year.
[03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:21.440]  By the end of June, they were just, they were massive.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:27.440]  And so you never really know until you put them outside
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:31.240]  and you see what they're gonna do in your own environment.
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:33.480]  But we do our best to test them
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:35.000]  in every environment that we can.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:36.800]  And we're trying to put out something
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:39.440]  that you're gonna find something that you like
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:42.560]  in any kind of growing space.
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:46.040]  So if you are running out our stuff
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:49.440]  and you put out something that didn't do well
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:51.440]  in your particular environment,
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:53.080]  then please actually hit us up.
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:54.400]  We wanna know.
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:55.760]  We want that information.
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:57.960]  We wanna know why it didn't do well,
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:59.800]  like what kinds of things that it faced
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:02.480]  that it hadn't faced in our test grows.
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:05.480]  And that kind of information
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:07.280]  starts to build the relationship
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:09.120]  that brings this community together.
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:10.720]  And MJ will tell you that,
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:13.040]  when you're helping us out,
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:15.600]  we're going to be giving you seeds.
[03:04:15.600 --> 03:04:19.520]  And we're going to be like trying to further this dialogue
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:21.760]  so that we can learn together as a community,
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:25.120]  because like, at the end of the day,
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.880]  I can only grow so many plants.
[03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:28.760]  I can only view so many plants.
[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:30.840]  I can only be in so many environments,
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:34.920]  but all of us as a community can answer
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:37.240]  some of these questions on such a broad scale
[03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:40.680]  in a way that no other science experiment really can.
[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:45.480]  And so, tell us, we wanna know, try them.
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:47.200]  And then like, if it doesn't work,
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:50.680]  then please let us know and let's figure out why
[03:04:50.680 --> 03:04:53.440]  so we can figure out something that will work for you.
[03:04:57.240 --> 03:05:00.200]  And we appreciate, yeah, the candid answers.
[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:01.720]  You know, there's a lot of breeders out there
[03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:03.920]  that really kind of just run through that stuff.
[03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:07.160]  And in my opinion, I think Marco backed me up here,
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:08.120]  they might not know it
[03:05:08.120 --> 03:05:09.760]  because they're not putting in the work.
[03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:14.760]  And so I think when the consumer is a little bit educated
[03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:16.520]  and now has enough knowledge
[03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:19.280]  to maybe ask the right questions when they go to the expos,
[03:05:19.280 --> 03:05:20.840]  how are things done?
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:24.000]  That's going to further just the process of better cannabis,
[03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:25.640]  better medicine for all.
[03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:27.320]  I wanted to give it over to Marco,
[03:05:27.320 --> 03:05:30.120]  and then I'd like to shut it down, boys,
[03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:32.880]  because we always go over and we try to-
[03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:33.800]  I know.
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:36.160]  And when the show's so good,
[03:05:36.160 --> 03:05:37.960]  I'm the main one that usually complains,
[03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:40.360]  but man, when the show's good, you gotta keep it going.
[03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:43.240]  So this was great, Robbie.
[03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:44.240]  I appreciate you, man.
[03:05:44.720 --> 03:05:45.760]  You lit some fires in me.
[03:05:45.760 --> 03:05:48.800]  You said that Duke and other people lit fires in you.
[03:05:48.800 --> 03:05:50.920]  You lit a few things in me, man.
[03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:54.400]  And I thank you for the straight up answers.
[03:05:54.400 --> 03:05:57.120]  Like if anybody's trying to,
[03:05:57.120 --> 03:05:59.600]  and I just want to breathe for myself, my own little thing,
[03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:01.760]  but anybody out there that wants to go serious
[03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:03.560]  and take it even farther, man,
[03:06:03.560 --> 03:06:06.800]  the stuff that Robbie dropped on you today is valuable, man.
[03:06:06.800 --> 03:06:08.440]  Like watch this shit again,
[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:12.800]  don't be, you know, forward through it and find no spots
[03:06:12.800 --> 03:06:16.080]  and take this info and move forward.
[03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:17.840]  And I'm just going to keep moving forward
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:19.600]  and doing my thing.
[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:20.600]  I appreciate y'all.
[03:06:21.560 --> 03:06:23.160]  Can I just say before we go,
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:26.360]  like if you are wanting to be a breeder out there,
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:29.080]  this show was about breeding, do it.
[03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:31.280]  Today's the day, start.
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:36.000]  Find a space, do it at any scale that you're capable.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.120]  Go out and make it happen
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:41.960]  because together the information's out there.
[03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:44.280]  People want to help you.
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:48.560]  So just keep it going, keep this community together
[03:06:48.560 --> 03:06:49.480]  and keep it alive.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:54.480]  And thank everybody for doing the show today.
[03:06:54.600 --> 03:06:55.520]  It's been awesome.
[03:06:57.800 --> 03:06:59.680]  Yeah, I wanted to add last words.
[03:06:59.680 --> 03:07:02.280]  Yeah, from you MJ, any last words or anything, boy?
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:04.640]  I always want to say,
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:07.360]  I'm always going to give big shout outs to Big Rob.
[03:07:07.360 --> 03:07:09.400]  I'm always going to give shout outs to you and Marco
[03:07:09.400 --> 03:07:11.320]  for putting the podcast together.
[03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:15.640]  Always having good people that are honest,
[03:07:15.640 --> 03:07:18.960]  that necessarily don't want to be in the forefront
[03:07:18.960 --> 03:07:19.880]  of this whole thing.
[03:07:19.880 --> 03:07:22.160]  Some people that don't never want to even want to be
[03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:24.440]  on any of this are willing to get on
[03:07:24.440 --> 03:07:27.360]  and give some information back to the community.
[03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:29.440]  Some of these bigger companies don't do that.
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:31.280]  I can call Robbie when we hang up this phone
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:33.400]  and he'll still want to talk for two or three more hours.
[03:07:33.400 --> 03:07:34.240]  You know what I mean?
[03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:37.360]  So I appreciate him and everything he's done for us,
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:40.360]  myself, definitely, my family, my community,
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:42.920]  my community within where I live
[03:07:42.920 --> 03:07:46.960]  and the community that you guys have inquired here
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:48.960]  on the podcast as well.
[03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:50.240]  Shout outs to you, Rob.
[03:07:50.240 --> 03:07:51.240]  Appreciate you, brother.
[03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:52.280]  Thanks.
[03:07:52.280 --> 03:07:54.200]  Hey, can I say one more thing?
[03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:56.400]  Everybody who's watching, please hit the like button.
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:07:57.720]  Please hit the follow button.
[03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:00.600]  Make sure that these guys build a bigger audience.
[03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:03.240]  Like it really does make a big difference.
[03:08:03.240 --> 03:08:05.160]  The more that you interact with this show,
[03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:07.800]  the more that you comment, the more that you like the show,
[03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:09.520]  the more that you follow it,
[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:11.680]  the better chances are that they're going to get out
[03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:13.880]  to a bigger audience and they're going to be able
[03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:15.400]  to spread this knowledge further.
[03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:19.240]  So you really are doing a big part by doing that.
[03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:22.720]  Please go out and make sure you do that on any podcast
[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:26.800]  or any source that you appreciate the knowledge from.
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:30.880]  Yeah, and I'd say, you know, we want to give a salute,
[03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:32.120]  Marco and I, to London,
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:34.760]  who's in a way teaching us a lot of this stuff.
[03:08:34.760 --> 03:08:38.840]  So, you know, just trying to learn more about the backend,
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:41.720]  how to make things just better.
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:43.800]  You know, I'm at a loss for words
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:46.760]  of trying to describe this being stoned for three hours,
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:49.480]  but on the backend, yes, seamless,
[03:08:49.480 --> 03:08:50.640]  where we're actually, you know,
[03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:53.440]  and we can communicate with you guys in real time.
[03:08:53.440 --> 03:08:56.880]  That's something that I think is special about this show
[03:08:56.880 --> 03:08:59.160]  that we can have, sit here, have dialogue.
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:00.760]  You know, this is the first time I've ever sat here
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:02.160]  and actually looked at the chat
[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:05.560]  and I didn't see one person that was being, you know,
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:07.600]  shady or negative in any way.
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:09.640]  And that's exactly what I would love to see
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:12.080]  from each and every show, each and every week,
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:14.480]  is all that nonsense is pointless anyway.
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:15.600]  We're here to learn.
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:17.840]  And that's something that I think Marco
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:18.920]  and I pride ourselves on,
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:20.960]  is that the nonsense and all that kind of stuff
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:22.240]  is for other shows.
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:25.600]  We're just here trying to use our time as best we can,
[03:09:25.600 --> 03:09:28.000]  you know, give it to you guys and bring on guests
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.040]  like we did today with Rob and MJ,
[03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:32.200]  where you might not necessarily have ever heard
[03:09:32.200 --> 03:09:33.480]  of these gentlemen,
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:36.320]  because they don't necessarily want to be heard from.
[03:09:36.320 --> 03:09:38.000]  And it's more me just reaching out.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:42.600]  And now that Rob's, you know, big, big time star,
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:45.440]  you know, I think that it's fun for a lot of us
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:48.040]  to see you having success.
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:51.560]  That's something that we, I like it, man.
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:53.320]  I love to see my friends shine.
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.200]  I love to see people that I know finding success
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:09:57.320]  and monetizing things.
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:09:58.840]  Yes, you have to make money in the world.
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:00.520]  People always start to hate on you
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:02.000]  when you got a little money in your pocket.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.320]  But there has to be positive things
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:06.800]  that come from people that are constantly giving.
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:10.520]  MJ, myself, I feel like Marco,
[03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:12.080]  we're constantly doing that stuff.
[03:10:12.080 --> 03:10:14.280]  Rob is, you know, has that in spades,
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:16.520]  obviously gave away seeds from today.
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:20.360]  So I hope that more people just give for 2023.
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:23.320]  That's what a lot of these shows started out to be.
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:25.960]  It didn't start out to be anything drama whatsoever.
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:28.280]  It was all about just giving back to the community
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.560]  because I, and maybe that was why we created
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:33.400]  that flyer a little bit, Marco, is we got lucky.
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:36.000]  I feel like I got very lucky that I didn't get caught up
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.040]  in some of the things that my peers got caught up in
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:41.200]  or being at the wrong house at a certain time.
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:43.160]  And then everybody's going down
[03:10:43.160 --> 03:10:44.200]  because they're hanging out there.
[03:10:44.200 --> 03:10:45.960]  And those are real things that happen to people.
[03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:47.360]  So remember who you're hanging out with.
[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:48.760]  Remember who your friends are.
[03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  And remember where you get your seeds.
[03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:52.160]  Till we see you next week.
[03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:54.920]  And London, are you on there?
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:57.160]  Cause I want to give you a shout out, buddy.
[03:10:57.160 --> 03:11:02.160]  If you're on the backend, give him a couple seconds here.
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:04.280]  You guys believe in cannabis?
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:06.840]  If you don't know, London is on the backend.
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:08.280]  I'm in the middle of something.
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:10.640]  So I'm not going to go visibly on, but yes.
[03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:11.960]  Yes, I am here.
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.200]  You guys are killing it.
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:15.040]  I look forward to seeing your show every single week.
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:16.600]  I got a ton of killer content coming up.
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:18.120]  We're going to be up in Spain.
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:20.080]  We're going to be showing you the new house in Italy
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:23.080]  and the new regenerative farm that we'll be setting up.
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:25.440]  We got the road to unicorn cup, which is happening
[03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:26.360]  which is a big deal.
[03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:27.880]  We've got a lot of fun stuff.
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:29.560]  So don't like, you know, hang out
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:31.640]  and then keep your eye out for fun stuff
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:33.080]  and do exactly what everybody said.
[03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:34.960]  Like, follow, share, do all that stuff.
[03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:35.800]  That's important.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:37.440]  It helps drive us forward.
[03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:39.440]  We worldwide, man.
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:40.520]  We are worldwide.
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:43.320]  And if you're lucky enough to watch the show internationally
[03:11:43.320 --> 03:11:46.360]  then reach out to, well, I guess if three B through Daga
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:48.560]  but you're buying Rob's gear and I promise you
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:52.240]  you're going to be able to create this own little stable
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:54.680]  for yourself because nobody else has those genetics.
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:56.600]  And those are the kinds of things that are allow you
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:58.280]  to start to build a brand for yourself.
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:11:59.680]  People want to wear your hats.
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:00.880]  They want to wear your t-shirt.
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:03.160]  Shout out to Steinsland even, right?
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:04.880]  I think what's his name?
[03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:07.720]  Created the cultivated classics, created your hat.
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:10.320]  That's the kind of stuff that I think the community likes.
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:12.760]  You can't buy this shit in the stores for the most part.
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:13.600]  Right.
[03:12:13.600 --> 03:12:15.680]  It's whether you know about the community or you don't.
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:16.880]  And that's something that I think, you know
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:18.720]  especially Marco, you're rocking today.
[03:12:18.720 --> 03:12:20.000]  So a legend.
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:21.760]  I bought these, I bought my hat.
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:22.960]  I bought my stuff.
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:23.920]  I buy my stuff.
[03:12:23.920 --> 03:12:25.920]  Cause I like to support our people out there.
[03:12:25.920 --> 03:12:28.000]  I ain't going to be talking about, let me get this for free.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:29.040]  You know what I mean?
[03:12:29.040 --> 03:12:30.720]  We got to support our people, bro.
[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:32.400]  That's all I'm talking about.
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:33.240]  Hook a brother up.
[03:12:33.240 --> 03:12:35.160]  Right, hook up, hook up.
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:37.240]  Rob, I'll give you, maybe we could hook up.
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.160]  But right now, you know, you got to support.
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:41.520]  Rob, I'll give you the last word
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:43.920]  and then we're going to cut it, sir.
[03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:45.320]  Man, it's been a great time.
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:48.720]  I really appreciate all of you guys
[03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:51.040]  for spending the last three hours with me.
[03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:51.960]  It's been a joy.
[03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:55.920]  So thank you and everybody have a great night.
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:58.480]  Excellent.
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:12:59.320]  We'll see you guys next week.
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:02.680]  Jadam February, hit me up.
[03:13:02.680 --> 03:13:03.600]  Anybody going?
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:05.280]  Chad?
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:06.880]  Yeah, we should start talking about that, huh?
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:07.720]  Exactly.
[03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:10.400]  Heather, hit me up.
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:12.920]  I'll let you guys know.
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:14.360]  All right, we'll see you guys next week.
[03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:15.200]  Peace.
