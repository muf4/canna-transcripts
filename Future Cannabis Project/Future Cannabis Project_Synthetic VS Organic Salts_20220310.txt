[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  I'll be back, I grabbed my bong.
[00:01.800 --> 00:02.640]  Yeah.
[00:02.640 --> 00:07.160]  So Brandon was just giving us an update on himself
[00:07.160 --> 00:10.000]  and I figured since he's gonna have to say it all over again
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.360]  we might as well save him.
[00:12.240 --> 00:13.800]  Having to say it two times,
[00:13.800 --> 00:16.780]  Brian I'll hopefully be on imminently.
[00:19.060 --> 00:20.500]  Layton.
[00:20.500 --> 00:21.340]  Yes sir.
[00:21.340 --> 00:23.320]  Layton's frozen.
[00:23.320 --> 00:24.880]  I'm frozen?
[00:24.880 --> 00:27.400]  I always forget that it's cold where some people are.
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.080]  No, you're not frozen.
[00:29.120 --> 00:30.480]  No, Layton was frozen.
[00:30.480 --> 00:31.560]  So Layton.
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.400]  Okay.
[00:32.400 --> 00:36.120]  Hang on dog, just grab my sunglasses.
[00:36.960 --> 00:41.960]  All right, let me, so I sent it to Brian on IG
[00:42.920 --> 00:44.400]  and I emailed it to him.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.240]  Let's see.
[00:47.840 --> 00:48.680]  All right.
[00:50.960 --> 00:53.560]  I wanted to show Layton.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.400]  I'm back.
[00:54.400 --> 00:57.700]  All right, so as the only other Boston person
[00:57.700 --> 01:02.100]  in this conversation, we got that.
[01:02.100 --> 01:03.980]  Can you see that?
[01:03.980 --> 01:05.540]  Celtics, yep.
[01:05.540 --> 01:07.460]  And then do you see the?
[01:07.460 --> 01:08.620]  Double zero.
[01:08.620 --> 01:10.140]  Yeah, the chief.
[01:11.060 --> 01:14.720]  I call this the Celtics off season T-shirt.
[01:17.140 --> 01:19.340]  Trying to figure out my lighting over here.
[01:21.100 --> 01:22.580]  Oh, is that a record?
[01:22.580 --> 01:23.820]  Well, that's more dramatic.
[01:23.820 --> 01:25.600]  You got dramatic lighting.
[01:28.510 --> 01:30.950]  We got Boston in the house.
[01:33.470 --> 01:35.590]  I feel like two lights are gonna come crashing down
[01:35.590 --> 01:36.430]  on your head.
[01:38.070 --> 01:39.750]  It looks amazing.
[01:39.750 --> 01:41.590]  Now where's your bong?
[01:41.590 --> 01:42.430]  It's right here.
[01:42.430 --> 01:44.350]  All right, all right, just making sure.
[01:46.350 --> 01:48.430]  My bong, I got everything.
[01:48.430 --> 01:50.310]  I gotta get a fishing license today too.
[01:50.310 --> 01:52.070]  I got to probably take the dog out.
[01:52.910 --> 01:53.750]  What's that?
[01:53.750 --> 01:55.510]  What's the fishing like?
[01:55.510 --> 01:59.390]  Are you like a fly fishing
[01:59.390 --> 02:01.230]  or what kind of fishing do you like?
[02:02.270 --> 02:04.850]  I have some swim baits, we'll be bait casting.
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.360]  And what kind of fish are running
[02:09.360 --> 02:10.960]  through the Oklahoma rivers?
[02:11.840 --> 02:14.040]  Bass. And lakes, okay.
[02:14.040 --> 02:14.880]  Nice.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.320]  I'm gonna get some bass fishing.
[02:16.320 --> 02:18.160]  I'm not sure what all the fish are out here.
[02:18.160 --> 02:20.760]  I'm not like an expert by any means, but.
[02:22.680 --> 02:25.040]  There's a lot more fish there than there is in San Diego,
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.240]  I'll tell you that much.
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.160]  I've caught fish in San Diego.
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.240]  Nothing in either box, I'm trying.
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.240]  Tell him to check his Instagram DM.
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.040]  Or let me, actually I can text him, hold on.
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.920]  Oh, he texted me, all right.
[02:54.860 --> 02:56.300]  All right, rubber.
[02:56.300 --> 02:59.340]  Let me also send it to this address.
[02:59.340 --> 03:01.220]  So actually, all right, while I'm dealing with him,
[03:01.220 --> 03:02.620]  Brandon, you were just about to tell us
[03:02.620 --> 03:03.780]  what's up in your life.
[03:07.140 --> 03:10.980]  Oh yeah, well, I got a bunch of stuff going on right now.
[03:12.180 --> 03:14.580]  I'm gonna be moving to Broken Bow
[03:14.580 --> 03:16.020]  and I'm gonna be setting up
[03:17.380 --> 03:22.020]  another vertically integrated facility over there.
[03:22.020 --> 03:25.940]  I'll be helping out with a couple of other farms
[03:25.940 --> 03:28.100]  that are in the same area.
[03:29.100 --> 03:32.260]  And I'm gonna get that all set up.
[03:32.260 --> 03:34.100]  I'm working on,
[03:35.820 --> 03:40.820]  I have to drop a business plan for a place out in New Jersey.
[03:42.460 --> 03:47.060]  And then I have a soil,
[03:50.380 --> 03:51.540]  the soil distribution thing
[03:51.540 --> 03:53.420]  is gonna be coming online real soon.
[03:53.420 --> 03:55.060]  So I will have,
[03:55.980 --> 04:00.180]  I'm gonna have a couple of different blends of soil
[04:00.180 --> 04:05.180]  and it's gonna be a balanced soil.
[04:05.420 --> 04:08.580]  I'll have one for seed starts,
[04:08.580 --> 04:10.580]  something that's not too heavy,
[04:11.580 --> 04:16.580]  but it's still sufficient and balanced for the crop.
[04:19.580 --> 04:23.380]  And then I'll have like my regular mix,
[04:23.380 --> 04:26.020]  like the heavy mix, the real heavy mix,
[04:26.020 --> 04:29.140]  that's almost like a water only,
[04:29.140 --> 04:30.820]  or I should probably say,
[04:35.260 --> 04:36.820]  you don't have to use as much
[04:36.820 --> 04:40.340]  because it's really difficult to just do water only
[04:40.340 --> 04:43.980]  because you need to be like adjusting your pH and soil
[04:43.980 --> 04:46.500]  and you can't do that with just like water.
[04:46.500 --> 04:48.740]  You have to add amendments to that and stuff.
[04:48.940 --> 04:53.940]  So, but it's really sufficient in mineral nutrition
[04:55.860 --> 04:59.300]  and then the base saturation percentages
[04:59.300 --> 05:01.260]  are balanced out really nicely.
[05:01.260 --> 05:06.260]  It's got a nice amount of micronutrients as well.
[05:08.180 --> 05:12.740]  And it has everything that you would need
[05:12.740 --> 05:14.340]  to get through a whole run.
[05:16.140 --> 05:18.660]  As long as you're using the right pot size,
[05:19.540 --> 05:21.460]  you can't grow a three foot plant
[05:21.460 --> 05:24.300]  in a one gallon pot, obviously.
[05:24.300 --> 05:29.300]  But if you kind of have enough space for the size plant
[05:31.660 --> 05:32.700]  that you plan on growing,
[05:32.700 --> 05:37.580]  then this soil will be in itself.
[05:37.580 --> 05:39.180]  If you have no experience at all
[05:39.180 --> 05:40.780]  and you literally just did water,
[05:40.780 --> 05:45.340]  you can get away with getting a great product at the end.
[05:46.180 --> 05:49.060]  But again, the soils, they react and stuff.
[05:49.060 --> 05:51.420]  So you gotta make the adjustments.
[05:51.420 --> 05:54.260]  You gotta add things back in that are getting pulled out.
[05:57.300 --> 05:58.700]  But yeah, I've got that thing coming up.
[05:58.700 --> 06:03.700]  Soil, I'll be going back and forth to Chicago again,
[06:05.140 --> 06:09.740]  working on some projects with NASA Agritech.
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.780]  I think the Nutri-Pot system
[06:11.780 --> 06:13.780]  will be coming online pretty soon.
[06:14.020 --> 06:17.260]  That's that carbon-based fertilizer pot.
[06:18.860 --> 06:22.380]  And I've just got a bunch of things
[06:22.380 --> 06:24.020]  that I'm taking care of.
[06:24.020 --> 06:27.780]  The garden out here will be kind of getting taken over.
[06:30.700 --> 06:32.180]  I'll just keep doing the recs.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.740]  I'll have all the things set up
[06:33.740 --> 06:35.460]  and have that kind of run in.
[06:35.460 --> 06:40.180]  And just putting all these things together.
[06:41.180 --> 06:44.380]  All right, Brandon, good morning to everybody.
[06:44.380 --> 06:46.100]  Good morning to you guys.
[06:46.100 --> 06:47.140]  Sorry, I was a little late there.
[06:47.140 --> 06:49.780]  I guess the link wasn't working right.
[06:49.780 --> 06:53.700]  But this is a show that I definitely wanted to put together.
[06:53.700 --> 06:55.000]  I know a lot of people have been asking
[06:55.000 --> 06:55.900]  for this kind of stuff,
[06:55.900 --> 06:58.780]  more of like discussions on certain topics.
[06:58.780 --> 07:03.220]  So again, last week was really well done, I felt like,
[07:03.220 --> 07:05.340]  for just kind of putting things together last minute,
[07:05.340 --> 07:06.940]  some surprises and stuff at the end,
[07:06.940 --> 07:08.660]  just the way the conversation flows.
[07:08.660 --> 07:12.140]  So I reached out to Smiley and Brandon again,
[07:12.140 --> 07:15.100]  so that we could have another honest discussion
[07:15.100 --> 07:18.500]  about salts and what the differences are.
[07:18.500 --> 07:23.500]  And there's people that have strong feelings on both sides.
[07:24.260 --> 07:27.340]  So just to kind of talk about these things
[07:27.340 --> 07:29.660]  and just kind of kick off ideas.
[07:29.660 --> 07:31.580]  I mean, that's what this is really about.
[07:31.580 --> 07:33.140]  I know that some people feel, again,
[07:33.140 --> 07:34.220]  really strongly about this.
[07:34.220 --> 07:37.580]  We're not, like the goal isn't to piss anybody off.
[07:37.580 --> 07:38.900]  We just want to have a discussion.
[07:38.900 --> 07:42.340]  And I feel like these, in my Rolodex,
[07:42.340 --> 07:44.620]  these are the ones that I feel like
[07:44.620 --> 07:48.260]  can continue to have an articulate dialogue about that
[07:48.260 --> 07:50.900]  without being disrespectful to one another.
[07:50.900 --> 07:52.660]  Brandon's already pulling out his charts
[07:52.660 --> 07:54.500]  and graphs and data points.
[07:55.420 --> 07:56.340]  Right on.
[07:56.340 --> 07:58.460]  So like I said, guys, I missed the beginning.
[07:58.460 --> 08:00.060]  So I don't know if Smiley,
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.740]  if you've had a chance to speak or Layton.
[08:01.740 --> 08:03.140]  So I kind of want to give you guys that.
[08:03.140 --> 08:05.580]  And then of course I got some questions and stuff
[08:05.580 --> 08:06.620]  to kind of kick things off.
[08:06.620 --> 08:08.740]  And then let's get the dialogue going.
[08:11.140 --> 08:12.220]  This is Smiley.
[08:12.220 --> 08:14.700]  Want to give another shout out?
[08:14.700 --> 08:16.220]  Yeah, man, I'm just Smiley's guard.
[08:16.220 --> 08:17.260]  I'm happy to be here.
[08:17.260 --> 08:20.780]  It's an honor to talk with you guys and share the panel.
[08:20.780 --> 08:24.940]  And yeah, I don't know, just doing my thing, man.
[08:28.540 --> 08:31.140]  Likewise, just here to chop it up with these boys.
[08:31.140 --> 08:32.660]  And thanks for coming on guys.
[08:32.660 --> 08:33.580]  Much appreciated.
[08:35.660 --> 08:38.260]  All right, so as we're like going week by week,
[08:38.900 --> 08:41.460]  we've done obviously a lot of interviews for a while now.
[08:41.460 --> 08:43.140]  And now it seems like more individuals
[08:43.140 --> 08:45.820]  want to see topic discussions.
[08:45.820 --> 08:47.980]  But there's a lot of videos obviously on topics
[08:47.980 --> 08:48.820]  and stuff like that.
[08:48.820 --> 08:51.860]  But it's usually based on that person's view, obviously.
[08:51.860 --> 08:55.700]  What the community is communicating with me
[08:55.700 --> 08:59.020]  is that they want to see things, yes, more complex ideas,
[08:59.020 --> 09:02.420]  even things that might be one side is way A
[09:02.420 --> 09:03.620]  and the other side is way B,
[09:03.620 --> 09:05.500]  but to still find a bridge,
[09:05.500 --> 09:08.060]  a platform where we can kind of create that kind of stuff.
[09:08.860 --> 09:10.380]  There's a lot of things behind the scenes
[09:10.380 --> 09:12.060]  that we hope to bring about.
[09:12.060 --> 09:14.180]  Today is kind of just maybe kicking that off
[09:14.180 --> 09:15.220]  because I know that everybody here
[09:15.220 --> 09:16.380]  is going to respect one another
[09:16.380 --> 09:20.140]  when we start talking about organic salts versus synthetic.
[09:20.140 --> 09:21.340]  So I kind of wanted to go around
[09:21.340 --> 09:23.100]  and let you guys in your own words,
[09:23.100 --> 09:26.580]  explain the differences to like a newbie
[09:26.580 --> 09:28.980]  on why they're different
[09:28.980 --> 09:33.340]  and why some people feel strongly about that synthetic salts,
[09:34.660 --> 09:36.660]  their viewpoints on synthetics as well.
[09:39.670 --> 09:40.910]  Should we go around the horn?
[09:40.910 --> 09:42.310]  I'll go with Brandon first.
[09:43.190 --> 09:44.950]  Okay, so,
[09:48.350 --> 09:52.190]  oh man, it's a really, really complicated question, right?
[09:53.030 --> 09:56.310]  It's a lot more complicated than most people would think.
[09:56.310 --> 09:57.990]  There's no easy answer.
[09:59.710 --> 10:04.190]  What it comes down to is the amount of energy
[10:05.170 --> 10:07.310]  that it takes to produce that thing.
[10:09.790 --> 10:14.390]  The use efficiency of how it reacts to water and soil
[10:14.390 --> 10:19.110]  and the other elements that it's being used for.
[10:21.030 --> 10:25.710]  And it also has to do with the types of elements
[10:25.710 --> 10:28.510]  that it brings into a system
[10:28.510 --> 10:31.430]  and accumulates over a period of time.
[10:32.310 --> 10:37.230]  So those are, I think, some of the main three key points,
[10:37.510 --> 10:41.230]  if we're gonna have this like on this topic.
[10:42.230 --> 10:45.350]  We also have to take into consideration
[10:46.670 --> 10:50.550]  some of these things are naturally cycled.
[10:50.550 --> 10:53.930]  And so some of these things like nitrogen, for instance,
[10:56.630 --> 11:01.630]  as a fertilizer can still volatilize off,
[11:03.230 --> 11:06.710]  and dissipate into the atmosphere as atmospheric nitrogen.
[11:07.550 --> 11:12.490]  When it goes through certain chemical changes in the soil.
[11:14.470 --> 11:17.470]  So the difference between chemical salts
[11:21.030 --> 11:26.030]  and organic salts is really nothing,
[11:30.990 --> 11:32.750]  except the terminology.
[11:32.750 --> 11:37.190]  Now, organic as in, if we're talking about organic,
[11:38.030 --> 11:40.670]  we're talking about something that's carbon-based,
[11:41.590 --> 11:42.890]  organic chemistry.
[11:44.910 --> 11:48.610]  When we're talking about something that's not organic,
[11:48.610 --> 11:52.050]  we use things for organic production
[11:52.050 --> 11:54.170]  that are not considered organic.
[11:55.630 --> 11:59.590]  But they are certified CDFA certified, OMRI certified,
[11:59.590 --> 12:01.490]  they're listed for organic production.
[12:02.210 --> 12:05.050]  You know, the difference is really
[12:06.170 --> 12:08.950]  the practice behind the cultivation.
[12:08.950 --> 12:11.830]  If you're talking about organic as a practice
[12:11.830 --> 12:16.230]  versus organic versus, you know, chemistry.
[12:16.230 --> 12:18.530]  I think that's kind of the biggest difference.
[12:21.450 --> 12:22.530]  Excellent, Smiley.
[12:25.170 --> 12:26.730]  Oh man, it's a deep question.
[12:27.930 --> 12:31.070]  I think Brandon really touched on that with the cycling.
[12:31.070 --> 12:36.070]  So, you know, and realizing that nitrogen and phosphorus
[12:36.510 --> 12:40.330]  and all these things, carbon, all of them cycle through,
[12:41.230 --> 12:44.430]  in my opinion, kind of like the fertilizer companies
[12:44.430 --> 12:46.550]  are kind of short cutting that,
[12:46.550 --> 12:49.710]  or trying to shortcut that cycling
[12:49.710 --> 12:52.550]  in a more direct manner of supplying new nitrogen
[12:52.550 --> 12:54.810]  in an ionic form or whatever.
[12:54.810 --> 12:57.650]  Where like, I guess in my mind's eye,
[12:58.650 --> 13:02.530]  an organic grower is trying to encourage
[13:02.530 --> 13:05.970]  that natural cycling more through biology
[13:05.970 --> 13:07.650]  versus trying to apply it.
[13:07.650 --> 13:09.530]  But I guess that's kind of my basic.
[13:14.200 --> 13:15.040]  Layton.
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.760]  Yeah, I think that goes back to some of these processes
[13:20.760 --> 13:22.840]  that we don't completely understand yet.
[13:22.840 --> 13:25.400]  So that would be these, you know,
[13:25.400 --> 13:28.640]  geo biochemistry interactions.
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.240]  And I think, you know, Brandon nailed it by saying that,
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.720]  you know, there's these consequences that are occurring
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.040]  in the soil when you are introducing synthetic.
[13:41.040 --> 13:44.840]  And so my point here is that synthetic is manmade
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.200]  where, you know, some of these other natural
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.080]  forming salts are mined.
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.640]  So let's just leave the carbon footprint equation
[13:54.640 --> 13:57.920]  out of that because that's gonna get really complicated.
[13:57.920 --> 14:01.520]  But there's definitely some undesirable consequences
[14:01.520 --> 14:03.520]  when you're using synthetics,
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.400]  both in plant reaction as well as soil pollution.
[14:07.400 --> 14:09.420]  So there's my two cents.
[14:11.120 --> 14:13.400]  Yeah, you wanna, let's kind of go around with that.
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.760]  So do you guys think that salts that are mined,
[14:16.760 --> 14:19.000]  there's a difference to that?
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.160]  I know Brandon, you kind of already kind of spoke
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.400]  your opinion on that, but let's go a little deeper with that.
[14:27.500 --> 14:31.260]  Okay, so this is what we're looking at.
[14:31.260 --> 14:36.060]  Because we're, because of the way that we consume energy,
[14:37.620 --> 14:42.340]  we have reactions that come from, let's say coal
[14:42.340 --> 14:44.900]  to produce energy and electricity,
[14:44.900 --> 14:49.340]  or we have, you know, some wind
[14:49.340 --> 14:51.380]  and some like green sources of energy,
[14:51.380 --> 14:54.220]  but our main sources of energy, at least in this country,
[14:54.220 --> 14:56.080]  come from the burning of fossil fuel.
[14:57.220 --> 15:02.220]  Now, because fossil fuel is a finite resource,
[15:07.620 --> 15:09.180]  we have to look at the equation
[15:09.180 --> 15:13.700]  of how much of that resource is used to produce something
[15:15.620 --> 15:18.720]  that we wanna introduce into another system.
[15:18.720 --> 15:21.120]  So we're looking at the energy use of it, right?
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.980]  How much energy does it create?
[15:26.500 --> 15:28.140]  You're also looking at, you know,
[15:30.540 --> 15:32.580]  what does it actually do?
[15:32.580 --> 15:36.980]  And how much of what is there is actually effective?
[15:36.980 --> 15:40.300]  If you take something that's chemical,
[15:42.560 --> 15:47.200]  whether it be mined or whether it be,
[15:48.420 --> 15:53.420]  you know, a rock phosphate or a, you know, iron sulfate
[15:53.980 --> 15:56.540]  or something like that synthetically made
[15:56.540 --> 15:59.540]  like diammonium phosphate,
[15:59.540 --> 16:03.200]  if you add too much of either one of those
[16:03.200 --> 16:04.280]  into the environment,
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.620]  it could potentially have negative consequences.
[16:08.620 --> 16:11.460]  But that's why people have agronomists,
[16:11.460 --> 16:14.200]  and that's why the science has already been developed.
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.980]  So you can know what you need to add without over applying,
[16:17.980 --> 16:20.460]  and then how to do it in proper techniques.
[16:20.540 --> 16:24.340]  So that way, the problem though is
[16:24.340 --> 16:26.520]  with these chemical fertilizers,
[16:27.740 --> 16:32.740]  a lot of times they have a small percentage.
[16:33.020 --> 16:34.980]  Let's take for instance,
[16:34.980 --> 16:37.700]  most of the hydroponic stuff that you see
[16:37.700 --> 16:41.240]  in hydroponic stores or grow stores, right?
[16:41.240 --> 16:46.240]  And you might have something like a 10, 10, 10, 10, right?
[16:47.500 --> 16:49.800]  If you're lucky, usually there's way less.
[16:50.160 --> 16:52.920]  Usually it's like one, six, three or something like that
[16:52.920 --> 16:54.960]  on these bottled nutrients.
[16:54.960 --> 16:55.960]  But I like to use 10
[16:55.960 --> 16:58.340]  because I can do math with it really easy.
[16:59.420 --> 17:03.080]  10%, I'm gonna take nitrogen and I've done this before.
[17:03.080 --> 17:06.320]  So if you have 10% of nitrogen in a product,
[17:07.960 --> 17:10.920]  the majority of that 10%
[17:13.240 --> 17:15.740]  will be a bioavailable, right?
[17:15.740 --> 17:18.560]  In like a soil system, if you had a nutrient, right?
[17:18.560 --> 17:20.520]  And you're using this in a soil system.
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.480]  Only 10% of that 10% is gonna be bioavailable.
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.200]  And that's because the nitrogen in that chemical form,
[17:29.200 --> 17:30.500]  it reacts.
[17:32.080 --> 17:34.040]  It reacts with water
[17:35.560 --> 17:39.800]  and it reacts with other chemicals that are in the soil.
[17:39.800 --> 17:43.860]  It also will eventually be used.
[17:44.860 --> 17:47.300]  If too much is applied,
[17:47.300 --> 17:51.420]  it'll decimate certain types of biology.
[17:54.530 --> 17:59.530]  Only 2% of that 10% will come in contact
[18:01.290 --> 18:05.530]  with root surface and be assimilated by the plant.
[18:05.530 --> 18:10.530]  So if you're looking at a product that has 10% of,
[18:11.130 --> 18:13.430]  let's say nitrogen or phosphorus in it,
[18:14.350 --> 18:18.510]  you put that into like ammonium, right?
[18:18.510 --> 18:20.870]  You put that into the soil system.
[18:20.870 --> 18:25.870]  10% divided by 10% divided by 2% is 0.0002%,
[18:30.110 --> 18:35.110]  which is a really, really low number
[18:35.310 --> 18:37.930]  as far as nutrient efficiency is.
[18:40.230 --> 18:42.910]  Those chemical reactions are always taking place.
[18:43.350 --> 18:45.670]  These biochemical reactions with biology,
[18:45.670 --> 18:48.950]  with other elements that are in the soil,
[18:48.950 --> 18:51.870]  these things also acidify the organic matter,
[18:51.870 --> 18:53.430]  releasing the carbon, right?
[18:53.430 --> 18:57.990]  The carbon could be carbon that's like trapped in that soil.
[18:57.990 --> 19:01.030]  But what happens is it acidifies it to the point
[19:01.030 --> 19:02.910]  where it releases the stored carbon
[19:02.910 --> 19:06.130]  and it decreases the organic matter content in soil.
[19:07.470 --> 19:09.330]  And what could happen is
[19:09.330 --> 19:11.790]  when you decrease the organic matter content,
[19:11.790 --> 19:14.030]  that is kind of like the heart and soul
[19:14.030 --> 19:15.730]  of the whole engine, right?
[19:15.730 --> 19:19.510]  It's where the biology is producing things like enzymes
[19:19.510 --> 19:22.350]  that break down inorganic minerals in the soil
[19:22.350 --> 19:27.190]  to create new soil and to create elements,
[19:27.190 --> 19:30.110]  to release things like phosphate in a form
[19:30.110 --> 19:31.330]  that's available to the plant.
[19:31.330 --> 19:33.310]  It's available ionic form.
[19:33.310 --> 19:37.790]  And that organic matter also holds those nutrients
[19:37.790 --> 19:39.670]  in that ionic form.
[19:39.670 --> 19:44.670]  And so if you add a bunch of chemicals
[19:45.110 --> 19:48.910]  into kind of an inert like dirt, really,
[19:48.910 --> 19:51.790]  with a really low organic matter,
[19:51.790 --> 19:53.290]  it doesn't have anywhere to go.
[19:53.290 --> 19:54.710]  It doesn't have anything to hold on to.
[19:54.710 --> 19:57.450]  That organic matter is what's responsible.
[19:57.450 --> 19:59.950]  You think of it kind of like a battery
[19:59.950 --> 20:02.770]  or like a magnet and it has these negative
[20:02.770 --> 20:04.670]  and positive charges on it.
[20:04.670 --> 20:09.670]  And they hold on to these elements that plants use.
[20:09.710 --> 20:11.990]  And so once that gets depleted,
[20:11.990 --> 20:15.910]  the ability for that soil to hold that mineral nutrition
[20:15.910 --> 20:19.270]  also that decreases.
[20:19.270 --> 20:21.310]  And so when you have rain and stuff,
[20:21.310 --> 20:23.710]  that shit washes off into the ecosystem
[20:23.710 --> 20:28.230]  and causes really, you know, like the red algae
[20:28.230 --> 20:33.230]  and it causes a lot of problems.
[20:33.670 --> 20:36.750]  So it's the improper use and also the acidification
[20:36.750 --> 20:41.750]  of the soil that is a problem with the use of chemicals,
[20:44.910 --> 20:48.630]  whether they're mined or whether they're produced.
[20:48.630 --> 20:52.310]  You can't just take something like, you know,
[20:53.230 --> 20:56.230]  potassium sulfate and just add it to a soil
[20:56.230 --> 21:00.130]  without properly amending that soil with organic matter,
[21:00.130 --> 21:04.050]  something like compost and kind of changing
[21:04.050 --> 21:07.210]  the actual practice of the farming technique.
[21:07.210 --> 21:08.570]  And I think that's the whole difference
[21:08.570 --> 21:11.570]  between organic versus synthetic
[21:11.570 --> 21:14.410]  when it comes to a practice, you know,
[21:14.410 --> 21:19.010]  because if I was to just add potassium sulfate,
[21:19.010 --> 21:20.810]  cause I was like, oh, it needs more potassium.
[21:20.810 --> 21:23.170]  Well, the organic matter content is low.
[21:23.170 --> 21:25.650]  I might just end up jacking up the EC.
[21:25.650 --> 21:29.690]  I might, you know, it might have a negative impact
[21:30.250 --> 21:33.370]  on that soil that's already suffering, you know?
[21:33.370 --> 21:36.290]  So it's more about the rejuvenation.
[21:36.290 --> 21:39.370]  You can use these different types of techniques
[21:39.370 --> 21:42.950]  to use something like a mined mineral sulfate.
[21:43.930 --> 21:45.750]  But again, it all comes down to technique
[21:45.750 --> 21:49.690]  and the usage becomes way, way less.
[21:49.690 --> 21:54.690]  The amount that you actually are applying is so, so small.
[21:54.930 --> 21:59.170]  I mean, I did eight millimeters total of a top dress,
[22:00.010 --> 22:04.290]  a couple of days ago per pot, you know?
[22:04.290 --> 22:07.250]  And that's a three gallon pot.
[22:07.250 --> 22:09.650]  And it's like, that is so minuscule.
[22:09.650 --> 22:14.650]  So the use efficiency for that type of thing
[22:14.670 --> 22:16.770]  is greater too, because here's the thing.
[22:16.770 --> 22:19.230]  When you get a synthetic iron,
[22:19.230 --> 22:22.170]  let's say you're gonna get an EDTH chelated iron
[22:22.170 --> 22:27.170]  and it's maybe gonna be about 0.05% in solution.
[22:27.970 --> 22:31.770]  And so you're gonna be adding this in there, right?
[22:31.770 --> 22:34.530]  At how, you know, how much of this do you have to add
[22:34.530 --> 22:37.850]  as opposed to something that's like iron sulfate,
[22:37.850 --> 22:42.610]  which is, you know, 25% total iron content.
[22:42.610 --> 22:46.910]  So you don't have to use very, very much, you know?
[22:46.910 --> 22:49.250]  We're talking about very, very small quantities.
[22:49.250 --> 22:50.890]  And when we're talking about micronutrients
[22:50.890 --> 22:54.770]  like copper, zinc, manganese, boron,
[22:55.770 --> 22:59.370]  it's, the quantities are so small
[22:59.370 --> 23:02.210]  that the only applications that you could really do
[23:02.210 --> 23:07.150]  are to do a foiler application on the surface of your soil.
[23:08.290 --> 23:10.330]  And it's not something that's,
[23:10.330 --> 23:12.890]  if you are building up your soil
[23:12.890 --> 23:15.570]  and you have that organic matter,
[23:15.570 --> 23:18.570]  these things work exponentially better, right?
[23:18.570 --> 23:21.290]  Because you have the capacity to hold on to them
[23:21.290 --> 23:23.370]  in an available form.
[23:23.370 --> 23:25.090]  Well, Brandon, isn't that to do
[23:25.090 --> 23:27.770]  with the carbon and nitrogen ratio too?
[23:27.770 --> 23:30.570]  So like organic matter in itself
[23:30.570 --> 23:32.810]  will increase carbon and nitrogen
[23:32.810 --> 23:35.830]  at the same time as organic matter is increasing, like?
[23:37.010 --> 23:40.930]  So there's a cycle that's constantly happening
[23:40.930 --> 23:43.710]  and, you know, those nutrients,
[23:45.230 --> 23:47.850]  there's chemical reactions that are always taking place.
[23:47.850 --> 23:48.850]  Okay, always.
[23:48.850 --> 23:51.530]  Through all the minerals that we have in our soil,
[23:51.530 --> 23:56.010]  they have the ability to change their composition
[23:56.010 --> 23:58.170]  and not all of their forms are available.
[23:58.170 --> 24:01.150]  If we're looking at like NH4, you know,
[24:01.150 --> 24:02.830]  that's a cation, that's ammonium.
[24:03.690 --> 24:07.290]  That's an available ionic form of nitrogen
[24:07.290 --> 24:08.510]  that's available to the form.
[24:08.510 --> 24:10.690]  Then you have something like nitrate.
[24:10.690 --> 24:12.410]  That's also available.
[24:12.410 --> 24:14.610]  And then you have an amino acid, right?
[24:14.610 --> 24:16.930]  That's an also another available form.
[24:16.930 --> 24:18.970]  And those things are cycled, right?
[24:18.970 --> 24:21.090]  There's the denitrification
[24:21.170 --> 24:23.090]  and there's the nitrification.
[24:23.090 --> 24:26.450]  And different types of bacteria will do different things.
[24:26.450 --> 24:29.410]  So some of them will cycle nitrogen
[24:30.690 --> 24:33.970]  that was once available in the soil to the plant
[24:33.970 --> 24:35.810]  and it'll turn it into atmospheric nitrogen.
[24:35.810 --> 24:39.090]  It'll volatilize off into the atmosphere.
[24:39.090 --> 24:40.890]  And there's also these organisms
[24:40.890 --> 24:45.890]  that are taking nitrogen from the atmosphere
[24:46.230 --> 24:49.870]  and turning it into a plant available form.
[24:52.090 --> 24:55.170]  And then there's also the release
[24:55.170 --> 24:58.370]  from decaying organic matter, right?
[24:58.370 --> 24:59.450]  There's a slow release.
[24:59.450 --> 25:02.210]  And what happens with that is the biology,
[25:02.210 --> 25:06.410]  usually stratophytic fungi and bacteria
[25:06.410 --> 25:08.630]  that feed on dead organic matter,
[25:08.630 --> 25:12.050]  they release enzymes and it kind of breaks down
[25:12.050 --> 25:14.750]  those carbon chains that, you know,
[25:14.750 --> 25:17.250]  like the cellulose and the lignin
[25:17.250 --> 25:18.630]  that the plant is made out of.
[25:18.670 --> 25:22.610]  And in doing so, it kind of unzips those carbon bonds
[25:22.610 --> 25:25.030]  that are bonded to the hydrogen, the oxygen
[25:25.030 --> 25:27.550]  and the nitrogen to make those proteins.
[25:27.550 --> 25:31.950]  So, you know, as it's broken down,
[25:31.950 --> 25:36.690]  it's catabolized into amino acids
[25:36.690 --> 25:41.690]  and then ammonium and then nitrate.
[25:42.910 --> 25:44.910]  And so that goes through a process too,
[25:44.910 --> 25:46.950]  the breakdown of that nitrogen cycle.
[25:46.950 --> 25:49.990]  So there's an atmospheric nitrogen cycle
[25:49.990 --> 25:52.950]  and there's also a cycle that takes place
[25:52.950 --> 25:55.470]  with the decaying organic matter.
[25:55.470 --> 26:00.470]  And the decaying organic matter is gonna be mostly carbon
[26:01.350 --> 26:03.310]  because that's what the plant mostly sequesters.
[26:03.310 --> 26:04.990]  It gets it out of the atmosphere.
[26:04.990 --> 26:06.410]  So in theory, you can create
[26:06.410 --> 26:10.810]  these carbon positive farming systems.
[26:10.810 --> 26:15.810]  If you were to, you know, put the majority of your biomass,
[26:15.810 --> 26:19.170]  that's not used and get it back into the system.
[26:19.170 --> 26:23.610]  However, the rate of release and breakdown
[26:23.610 --> 26:27.010]  isn't typically sufficient enough
[26:27.010 --> 26:31.110]  to supply things like micronutrients.
[26:32.170 --> 26:34.230]  It's what I've seen, you know,
[26:34.230 --> 26:36.270]  from the data that I've collected.
[26:36.270 --> 26:39.310]  Now, over a longer period of time,
[26:40.490 --> 26:43.450]  then those sufficiencies increase,
[26:43.450 --> 26:44.850]  but that's, you know,
[26:44.850 --> 26:48.850]  I think one of the reasons why you see living soil beds
[26:48.850 --> 26:51.570]  and, you know, that have that recycled matter
[26:51.570 --> 26:54.810]  always in there get better after time,
[26:54.810 --> 26:59.250]  because then the higher amount of true organic matter
[26:59.250 --> 27:02.410]  that's from the decomposition of all that stuff,
[27:02.410 --> 27:05.310]  it's gonna be able to hold more of that mineral nutrition.
[27:06.330 --> 27:11.330]  But you have to compensate for the deficiencies
[27:12.250 --> 27:14.970]  in the levels, and that's what I specialize in
[27:14.970 --> 27:17.250]  by looking at these target levels.
[27:17.250 --> 27:20.330]  So I use the mineral sulfates
[27:20.330 --> 27:23.770]  because they have a high percentage
[27:23.770 --> 27:26.650]  of the ionic mineral that's needed.
[27:27.930 --> 27:32.930]  It doesn't take as much energy to produce
[27:34.730 --> 27:37.530]  as a synthetic fertilizer,
[27:37.530 --> 27:41.290]  and it's not a derivative of petroleum production.
[27:42.150 --> 27:47.150]  And then it also has a higher nutrient use efficiency
[27:47.730 --> 27:52.730]  because it has a higher percentage of mineral in it,
[27:54.970 --> 27:57.850]  in a single element, you know?
[27:57.850 --> 28:00.810]  And you can also, you know, here's another thing too,
[28:00.810 --> 28:04.170]  that we have to think about these chemical soils.
[28:04.170 --> 28:07.410]  Processes of manufacturing, they create heavy metal,
[28:08.250 --> 28:09.090]  and they create contamination.
[28:09.090 --> 28:11.170]  And so if you're using chemical fertilizers,
[28:11.170 --> 28:14.830]  you may not get immediate contamination
[28:14.830 --> 28:17.050]  of things like heavy metals in food crops
[28:17.050 --> 28:20.290]  and stuff like that, but over a period of time,
[28:20.290 --> 28:22.750]  these things can compile.
[28:22.750 --> 28:25.750]  And this can not just come from, you know,
[28:25.750 --> 28:29.150]  chemical fertilizers, this can also come from, you know,
[28:29.150 --> 28:32.790]  sourcing organic material, like different types of meals
[28:32.790 --> 28:34.350]  and stuff like that, or it could even come
[28:34.350 --> 28:36.050]  from your water source, you know?
[28:37.450 --> 28:42.450]  But it's like the, if it's compiled over time, over time,
[28:42.770 --> 28:46.610]  and then it can become an issue, right?
[28:46.610 --> 28:51.290]  What that does is heavy metals in soil actually alter
[28:51.290 --> 28:54.370]  our DNA because the plant will uptake those.
[28:54.370 --> 28:56.530]  And if we're eating those heavy metals,
[28:56.530 --> 29:00.950]  they have the ability to kind of bind to sites in the cells
[29:00.950 --> 29:05.950]  where essential elements like zinc and copper might bind to.
[29:06.790 --> 29:11.110]  And it down-regulates the gene transcription process
[29:11.110 --> 29:15.030]  because they don't have, the proteins can't code properly.
[29:15.030 --> 29:17.730]  So heavy metals and cellular nutrition
[29:19.310 --> 29:21.190]  are go kind of hand in hand,
[29:21.190 --> 29:23.430]  because when you get heavy metals into these cellular
[29:23.430 --> 29:28.350]  systems, just like you would, you know, micronutrients,
[29:28.350 --> 29:29.710]  because that's what we're talking about
[29:29.710 --> 29:31.910]  when we're fertigating, we're actually working
[29:31.910 --> 29:34.370]  on a cellular level and these nutrients are used
[29:34.370 --> 29:36.490]  for these cellular processes.
[29:36.490 --> 29:38.850]  And you can have native consequences
[29:38.850 --> 29:43.370]  if you have heavy metals in your food crops.
[29:43.370 --> 29:45.530]  And if that gets in your food, your food's contaminated
[29:45.530 --> 29:47.590]  and we're eating these things,
[29:47.590 --> 29:51.610]  the same processes actually help happen on a cellular level.
[29:51.610 --> 29:53.050]  So it's all kind of related.
[29:54.130 --> 29:59.130]  So that's another reason why synthetics are, you know,
[29:59.330 --> 30:02.290]  not the greatest, but there is technology
[30:02.290 --> 30:04.850]  like the NASA agritech fertilizer, right?
[30:04.850 --> 30:08.970]  Which has taken things like the purest form
[30:08.970 --> 30:11.130]  of what the plant would actually use,
[30:11.130 --> 30:14.330]  and then attaching it to a carbon source
[30:14.330 --> 30:19.330]  to make a new organic molecule that has greater efficiency,
[30:20.070 --> 30:24.290]  takes less energy to manufacture.
[30:24.290 --> 30:27.130]  It's actually green manufacturing.
[30:28.130 --> 30:33.130]  And then what it can also do is help stabilize these systems
[30:34.770 --> 30:37.690]  because it's attached to the carbon.
[30:37.690 --> 30:41.130]  It adds the organic matter, it stimulates biology
[30:41.130 --> 30:43.970]  to build up the organic matter percentage,
[30:43.970 --> 30:48.650]  helping build new soil, and then also helping
[30:48.650 --> 30:51.770]  the mineral elements that are already in the soil systems
[30:53.090 --> 30:55.990]  stay in a biologically available form
[30:55.990 --> 30:59.950]  by attaching to the extra carboxylic acid
[30:59.950 --> 31:04.950]  that water soluble carbon that's being put in that system.
[31:06.910 --> 31:10.550]  I wanna get a smiley in on this, Brandon, as always, man,
[31:10.550 --> 31:12.550]  I love how you're able to break this stuff down
[31:12.550 --> 31:15.830]  on a level that I feel like most people can understand,
[31:15.830 --> 31:19.050]  or at least begin to understand how complex this stuff is.
[31:21.190 --> 31:22.350]  Smiley?
[31:22.350 --> 31:26.150]  No, I wanted to jump back to that carbon to nitrogen ratio
[31:26.150 --> 31:29.950]  just because some of this, I guess some of this
[31:29.950 --> 31:32.750]  is what made shit start to click in my head a little bit,
[31:32.750 --> 31:37.750]  or I think it does anyway, but when it was explained
[31:37.910 --> 31:42.910]  that a bacteria has a certain carbon to nitrogen ratio,
[31:43.270 --> 31:46.750]  fungi does, plants do, they're all different, right?
[31:46.750 --> 31:50.590]  So when a protozoa eats a bacteria,
[31:50.590 --> 31:53.990]  if it takes in six bacteria that are one to one,
[31:53.990 --> 31:56.550]  carbon and nitrogen, and it's trying to maintain
[31:56.550 --> 32:00.350]  a 10 to one, it has to get rid of some of that nitrogen
[32:00.350 --> 32:02.790]  and keep the carbon, that's my understanding.
[32:02.790 --> 32:06.470]  But for plants, it's similar to that with a plant too,
[32:06.470 --> 32:08.990]  but the carbon is coming from photosynthesis,
[32:08.990 --> 32:12.750]  so that's like that energy source that we always talk about.
[32:12.750 --> 32:15.990]  But the source of nitrogen, like what Brandon is saying,
[32:15.990 --> 32:18.710]  requires energy depending on what level
[32:18.750 --> 32:20.790]  or what stage you're getting it at.
[32:20.790 --> 32:23.830]  And it's still dependent on that carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[32:23.830 --> 32:27.190]  So if a plant is intaking a nitrogen source,
[32:27.190 --> 32:31.630]  like the NH4 or whatever, if it's intaking that,
[32:31.630 --> 32:36.070]  it has to have carbon to balance the amount of nitrogen
[32:36.070 --> 32:38.750]  and to, if that makes sense, you know what I'm saying?
[32:38.750 --> 32:41.790]  So it's always trying to balance carbon and nitrogen,
[32:41.790 --> 32:44.870]  but it's not just nitrogen, it's also potassium,
[32:44.870 --> 32:47.430]  it's also carbon to calcium,
[32:47.430 --> 32:50.230]  it's also carbon to sulfur and all these other things,
[32:50.230 --> 32:53.270]  but there's ratios that that has to maintain
[32:53.270 --> 32:56.910]  and try to balance is kind of an interesting idea,
[32:56.910 --> 32:58.670]  you know what I'm saying?
[32:58.670 --> 33:03.670]  So the carbon to nitrogen ratio is really in reference
[33:05.710 --> 33:10.710]  to how much nitrogen will be released from organic matter
[33:11.870 --> 33:13.350]  over a period of time.
[33:13.350 --> 33:15.910]  That's what actually that looks like.
[33:15.910 --> 33:19.670]  There's also the fact that, okay, so listen to this,
[33:19.670 --> 33:24.270]  there's bacteria that are also photosynthetic, right?
[33:24.270 --> 33:27.750]  And so they can take atmospheric carbon, carbon dioxide,
[33:27.750 --> 33:30.990]  and they can convert that the same way plants would do
[33:30.990 --> 33:34.510]  into carbon compounds and they can be stored
[33:34.510 --> 33:38.590]  as carbon molecules in the soil, right?
[33:38.590 --> 33:41.950]  Those carbon molecules might be, you know,
[33:41.950 --> 33:46.230]  something like a polysaccharide, right?
[33:47.510 --> 33:49.630]  That, you know, something that's gonna aggregate soil,
[33:49.630 --> 33:53.830]  but these things are gonna be, you know, having a function.
[33:53.830 --> 33:55.790]  And then there's a functional relationship
[33:55.790 --> 34:00.790]  between the amount of carbon and nitrogen,
[34:04.990 --> 34:09.990]  as far as the ability for it to cycle the nitrogen,
[34:10.590 --> 34:11.730]  if that makes sense.
[34:12.950 --> 34:17.670]  Because if there's no carbon, right, there's no energy.
[34:17.670 --> 34:21.790]  And so the release and for it to be able to break down
[34:22.750 --> 34:27.070]  the material, it doesn't have the energy to do it.
[34:27.070 --> 34:29.510]  But when it comes to plant energy,
[34:29.510 --> 34:31.910]  that is always gonna come from ATP.
[34:35.920 --> 34:38.960]  Something else that we should bring into this conversation
[34:38.960 --> 34:42.960]  is that, you know, what you touched on is so important,
[34:42.960 --> 34:46.000]  that organic matter in the soil fraction
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.040]  or their organic fraction in the soil.
[34:49.040 --> 34:51.400]  Yeah, not only does it hold those nitrogen
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.480]  or hold those nutrients and prevent them
[34:53.480 --> 34:55.860]  from being mobile in the soil system,
[34:55.860 --> 34:58.420]  so being able to wash away,
[34:58.420 --> 35:03.420]  but there also is a relationship for the bacteria
[35:04.720 --> 35:08.160]  to break apart those nitrogen, it needs carbon.
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.840]  So if you have no soil organic matter,
[35:10.840 --> 35:12.520]  you're not only losing your nutrients,
[35:13.080 --> 35:16.640]  you're preventing or disabling the very system
[35:16.640 --> 35:19.440]  of taking that nitrogen, breaking it apart
[35:19.440 --> 35:21.400]  and releasing it plant available.
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.640]  So in some of the early work I did in engineered soils,
[35:24.640 --> 35:28.680]  you're dealing with like a percent of organic matter,
[35:28.680 --> 35:30.480]  and they just couldn't get these plants
[35:30.480 --> 35:33.660]  to rebound after heavy pressure.
[35:33.660 --> 35:37.400]  So in sports fields, parks,
[35:37.400 --> 35:40.680]  so the key to that was getting that organic matter back
[35:40.720 --> 35:41.740]  in a liquid form.
[35:42.720 --> 35:44.280]  And that worked really well
[35:44.280 --> 35:46.800]  because now you could establish aggregation.
[35:46.800 --> 35:49.000]  So without carbon, you can't get aggregation,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.920]  you can't get those particles to start bonding together
[35:53.120 --> 35:54.800]  that allows the biology.
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.640]  So it's probably one of the most important factors
[35:58.640 --> 36:01.960]  in the soil system that you use synthetics,
[36:01.960 --> 36:03.480]  you're gonna break down all the carbon,
[36:03.480 --> 36:05.800]  you're gonna break down all that organic matter,
[36:05.800 --> 36:07.880]  and then you're not gonna be able to hold those nutrients.
[36:07.880 --> 36:10.600]  So like you said, not only are you building up
[36:11.420 --> 36:13.840]  these heavy metals, you're deterring your soils ability
[36:13.840 --> 36:16.760]  to function properly, and you're applying more
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.760]  and more nitrogen and getting less and less response
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.920]  because nobody's home to break the shit down
[36:20.920 --> 36:22.540]  and make it plant available.
[36:22.540 --> 36:25.000]  So it's fucking complex as shit.
[36:26.640 --> 36:28.640]  Now, when it comes to nitrogen,
[36:28.640 --> 36:30.440]  at least back in the day on the forums and stuff,
[36:30.440 --> 36:32.600]  they would say that the microbes prefer
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.320]  like the ammonium version,
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.480]  and then the plant prefers the nitrate version,
[36:38.480 --> 36:40.960]  so much so that if you're being silly
[36:40.960 --> 36:43.480]  and putting too much nitrogen late into flower
[36:43.480 --> 36:46.160]  that the plant will actually continue to take that up.
[36:46.160 --> 36:47.520]  Is there merit to that?
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.040]  I'd love to ask the panel.
[36:49.040 --> 36:50.840]  Well, personally, I don't think the plant
[36:50.840 --> 36:51.960]  takes anything up.
[36:51.960 --> 36:54.400]  It's the biology that has to make it plant available.
[36:54.400 --> 36:56.720]  So there's a link, there's a jump there.
[36:56.720 --> 36:58.480]  And then most fertilizers, they tell you
[36:58.480 --> 37:01.280]  not to just use one form or the other,
[37:01.280 --> 37:03.000]  but to use a combination of both
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.680]  because there's a suite of bacteria
[37:05.680 --> 37:08.760]  that some break this down, some break that down.
[37:08.760 --> 37:10.480]  So that gets back into diversity,
[37:10.480 --> 37:12.360]  like how important is it to have
[37:12.360 --> 37:14.720]  that diverse level of microbes in your soil?
[37:14.720 --> 37:18.000]  And it's very important because there are certain functions
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  that you can't get without that specific gene,
[37:23.160 --> 37:28.160]  or let's say, here we go, cultivar strain.
[37:28.200 --> 37:30.580]  Without those strains of bacteria,
[37:30.580 --> 37:34.140]  you're losing your potential.
[37:34.140 --> 37:36.640]  And I'd love to hear your guys' opinions on that.
[37:38.260 --> 37:39.100]  Smiley?
[37:42.540 --> 37:47.540]  Yeah, I mean, it's all about that diversity
[37:48.380 --> 37:52.560]  and that cycling and to truly get a system
[37:52.560 --> 37:54.580]  that's working and functioning on itself,
[37:54.580 --> 37:56.940]  you have to have those tiers.
[37:56.940 --> 37:58.860]  And I don't know, I guess it,
[38:01.860 --> 38:04.060]  I guess I lost my train of thought on it here.
[38:04.900 --> 38:09.900]  But yeah, I mean, I'm gonna mumble here for a minute
[38:10.980 --> 38:13.740]  because I'll have to catch my back on the train here.
[38:13.740 --> 38:16.060]  I've like totally lost it.
[38:16.060 --> 38:17.020]  My bad, dude.
[38:17.020 --> 38:19.700]  Hey, live, man, that's why a lot of people
[38:19.700 --> 38:20.860]  don't wanna do this stuff.
[38:20.860 --> 38:23.540]  It really is hard to just sit here and talk complex
[38:23.540 --> 38:27.660]  and keep things running, but we'll pass the torch to Brandon
[38:27.660 --> 38:30.960]  and maybe you can get that train of thought back on it.
[38:31.800 --> 38:36.440]  Um, yeah, so most of the stuff that's gonna be released
[38:36.440 --> 38:38.760]  from the decaying organic matter,
[38:38.760 --> 38:40.680]  from the cycling of organic matter,
[38:40.680 --> 38:43.680]  let's say like the waste,
[38:43.680 --> 38:48.680]  your leaves and stuff like that is gonna be nitrogen,
[38:49.560 --> 38:53.220]  sulfur, phosphorus.
[38:53.220 --> 38:54.880]  There's micronutrients in there too.
[38:54.880 --> 38:59.880]  Again, the amount that is released
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.560]  is available at one specific time,
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.880]  isn't typically enough.
[39:10.400 --> 39:15.320]  And so while these complex cycling,
[39:15.320 --> 39:18.560]  especially with phosphorus, because phosphorus,
[39:18.560 --> 39:22.280]  there are different micro,
[39:22.280 --> 39:23.840]  let me just back up here for a second.
[39:23.840 --> 39:25.960]  So different microbes will do different things
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.080]  depending on their modes of metabolism.
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.440]  Some are photosynthetic and they can,
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.440]  you know, they basically do what plants do.
[39:37.440 --> 39:40.520]  They can take minerals from their environment
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.160]  and they can take carbon from the atmosphere
[39:44.160 --> 39:46.720]  and they can sequester water from the environment
[39:46.720 --> 39:50.320]  and they can create complex carbon compounds.
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.160]  There's other bacteria that can break those things
[39:54.160 --> 39:58.200]  back down into their simpler parts again.
[39:58.240 --> 40:00.400]  And it's just like I was talking about before,
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.160]  you know, there is bacteria, nitrifying bacteria,
[40:05.160 --> 40:07.880]  and there's denitrifying bacteria.
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.880]  And it's typically you would see those cycles
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.560]  come into play when you have things like saturation
[40:17.560 --> 40:22.560]  or you go through a period of really low oxygen levels
[40:22.640 --> 40:24.240]  because you have so much water,
[40:24.240 --> 40:25.520]  let's say after heavy rains
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.720]  in like an ag soil, for instance.
[40:29.280 --> 40:32.040]  And these different types of bacteria
[40:32.040 --> 40:33.640]  would flourish for a little while,
[40:33.640 --> 40:36.880]  they would sequester the mineral elements around them
[40:36.880 --> 40:40.720]  and they would be releasing, you know,
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.520]  nitrogen in a plant available form.
[40:42.520 --> 40:45.760]  They would basically be a by-product of their metabolism.
[40:47.160 --> 40:49.800]  And then what would happen is it would dry back,
[40:49.800 --> 40:53.560]  maybe some other bacteria would come in
[40:53.560 --> 40:58.560]  and they'll utilize also those same available elements
[40:58.960 --> 41:00.160]  that are available to plants.
[41:00.160 --> 41:03.360]  There's always a competition between microbes and plants.
[41:03.360 --> 41:06.080]  You have to remember they're using the same mineral elements
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.320]  because fertilization happens on a cellular level.
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.680]  Now, while these microbes are responsible
[41:18.400 --> 41:22.640]  for breaking down some of these minerals
[41:22.640 --> 41:24.760]  into available forms,
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.520]  and we'll give you a couple of examples,
[41:26.520 --> 41:30.480]  trichoderma's ability to create sodiophores,
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.480]  which are natural iron chelators.
[41:35.560 --> 41:38.000]  And what that does is keeps iron in a form
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.480]  that's available to the plant.
[41:39.480 --> 41:41.720]  It keeps it from reacting in the environment.
[41:42.800 --> 41:45.800]  Another good example of this is going to be
[41:46.680 --> 41:49.960]  phosphorus solubilizing bacteria that produce an enzyme
[41:49.960 --> 41:52.560]  that solubilizes phosphate
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.120]  from inorganic mineral sources of phosphorus in soils.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.200]  So those are important.
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.080]  However, the plant actually uses
[42:02.080 --> 42:04.320]  three different transport methods
[42:04.320 --> 42:06.080]  to get these mineral elements.
[42:06.080 --> 42:07.520]  And it happens in the rhizosphere,
[42:07.520 --> 42:09.240]  and this is through diffusion.
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.720]  And what diffusion is, is you can think of diffusion as
[42:13.720 --> 42:18.720]  if you took and blew up a balloon with oxygen,
[42:20.360 --> 42:25.360]  it has an even distribution of those particles,
[42:25.680 --> 42:28.680]  and it's causing inflation on that balloon, right?
[42:28.680 --> 42:31.400]  So what happens is with diffusion,
[42:31.400 --> 42:34.400]  things move from higher concentration gradients
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.040]  to lower concentration gradients.
[42:37.040 --> 42:38.800]  And you can kind of think of it like this.
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.240]  Also, if this might be a good analogy,
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.600]  if you ever take something that's dry
[42:44.600 --> 42:46.960]  and you put it in a dish of water,
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  you can see the water defy gravity
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  and kind of soak up the whole tube, right?
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.280]  Like if you took a thing of toilet paper, for instance,
[42:55.280 --> 42:57.560]  and you put that in a little tray of water,
[42:57.560 --> 43:00.520]  eventually the whole thing will get soaked.
[43:00.520 --> 43:02.200]  The water actually is traveling up
[43:02.200 --> 43:05.720]  because it's moving from a higher concentration gradient
[43:05.720 --> 43:07.720]  to a lower concentration gradient.
[43:07.720 --> 43:12.200]  And so things like phosphate and a lot of other minerals
[43:12.200 --> 43:14.760]  are, this is how they're acquired.
[43:14.760 --> 43:16.620]  They have these concentration gradients
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.260]  where if it's lower in that root zone,
[43:20.260 --> 43:24.900]  then the surrounding area, it will diffuse into solution
[43:24.900 --> 43:27.700]  while the plant is pulling in water,
[43:27.700 --> 43:30.460]  and it'll move into that lower concentration gradient.
[43:30.460 --> 43:35.460]  And so you always need to have these minerals flowing
[43:35.660 --> 43:40.660]  into the root zone so that they can diffuse across membranes.
[43:41.500 --> 43:45.320]  And there's active and there's passive transport systems.
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.680]  Anything that's an active transport is gonna require ATP,
[43:49.680 --> 43:53.040]  an energy source, which is a triphosphate group
[43:53.040 --> 43:54.720]  that releases energy.
[43:55.840 --> 43:57.780]  And then, or it's gonna be a passive,
[43:57.780 --> 44:02.400]  which just allows it to naturally kind of move passively
[44:02.400 --> 44:05.000]  through the cellular membranes.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.080]  There's also what's called inception.
[44:08.080 --> 44:09.740]  And that is kind of like root mining
[44:09.740 --> 44:14.200]  where the root tip will come in contact,
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.320]  in physical contact with a mineral element,
[44:18.320 --> 44:20.880]  and it will be sequestered that way.
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.240]  And then there's also, so we did mass flow.
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.240]  And then mass flow is minerals that fall into solution
[44:30.720 --> 44:34.620]  and are uptaken with water transport.
[44:36.120 --> 44:40.120]  So those are the process that plants utilize
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.440]  to uptake mineral nutrients.
[44:42.440 --> 44:45.320]  And so they have these systems that are in place
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.320]  that work on a cellular mechanical level.
[44:50.880 --> 44:53.960]  And the biology that are around these systems
[44:53.960 --> 44:55.760]  and interacting with these systems
[44:55.760 --> 44:58.320]  help transport mineral nutrients.
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.320]  It helps create biologically available forms.
[45:04.860 --> 45:09.860]  It helps cycle some inorganic elements that are around them
[45:09.980 --> 45:14.980]  to create bioavailable forms of those elements.
[45:16.540 --> 45:18.100]  And then they're also responsible
[45:18.100 --> 45:22.020]  for the complex cycling of carbon and nitrogen
[45:24.040 --> 45:25.540]  into the soil from the atmosphere,
[45:25.540 --> 45:30.340]  as well as with the breakdown of organic compounds
[45:30.340 --> 45:31.360]  into the system.
[45:34.600 --> 45:37.020]  Smiley, do you remember?
[45:40.390 --> 45:41.910]  You're muted, buddy.
[45:42.550 --> 45:44.150]  Trying to get it unmuted there.
[45:45.750 --> 45:47.590]  You know, I did kind of,
[45:47.590 --> 45:50.190]  my brain went a hundred ways with that question,
[45:50.190 --> 45:52.030]  but I think one of the points
[45:52.030 --> 45:53.510]  that I was gonna try to make
[45:53.510 --> 45:56.650]  or kind of wrote down in my notes
[45:56.650 --> 45:59.190]  is there's like enzymatic type bonds,
[45:59.190 --> 46:01.710]  and there's also like stronger type bonds
[46:01.710 --> 46:03.110]  between these minerals.
[46:03.110 --> 46:05.950]  So just speaking in general terms, right?
[46:05.950 --> 46:09.350]  And enzymes are required to break down
[46:09.350 --> 46:11.350]  enzymatic type bonds,
[46:11.790 --> 46:15.190]  but some of the stronger bonds, covalent, tric,
[46:15.190 --> 46:16.230]  whatever the names are,
[46:16.230 --> 46:17.550]  but the stronger bonds,
[46:17.550 --> 46:18.870]  the point I'm trying to make is that
[46:18.870 --> 46:21.510]  they require different things to break them down.
[46:21.510 --> 46:22.990]  So like a lot of times people will say,
[46:22.990 --> 46:25.910]  well, all these enzymes are going in the soil
[46:25.910 --> 46:27.290]  and it's breaking everything down,
[46:27.290 --> 46:29.230]  but that's not exactly the way
[46:29.230 --> 46:31.030]  that's open-minded standing either.
[46:31.030 --> 46:33.030]  It'll break down enzymatic bonds,
[46:33.030 --> 46:36.230]  but it won't necessarily break down stronger type bonds.
[46:36.230 --> 46:39.470]  So that's where like all this different biology
[46:39.470 --> 46:42.910]  and all of them on a diversity that you can get there,
[46:42.910 --> 46:45.630]  in my mind's eye and the big picture
[46:45.630 --> 46:48.030]  is working at all these different things
[46:48.030 --> 46:49.670]  on all those different angles.
[46:49.670 --> 46:51.190]  And the more diversity you have,
[46:51.190 --> 46:54.710]  the more that's actually contributing to that cycling.
[46:54.710 --> 46:59.510]  So like, I think I made a comment to a friend in DMs,
[46:59.510 --> 47:02.710]  like synthetics versus organics,
[47:02.710 --> 47:04.510]  I think is probably the wrong way to word it
[47:04.510 --> 47:06.350]  because we're always kind of making it seem like
[47:06.350 --> 47:09.150]  it's like some kind of a competition,
[47:09.830 --> 47:10.670]  but there are differences.
[47:10.670 --> 47:15.670]  And that's the biggest thing I think is like in organics,
[47:16.190 --> 47:21.190]  the plant is still receiving a majority of those nutrients
[47:21.230 --> 47:25.550]  in a carbon to nitrogen ratio that it can deal with
[47:25.550 --> 47:30.550]  and maybe not have to sequester more carbon itself,
[47:30.750 --> 47:33.610]  you know what I'm saying, to try to uptake those.
[47:33.610 --> 47:36.230]  And that's where I see like a lot of that exchange happen.
[47:36.270 --> 47:39.910]  And so that extra carbon that the plant is doing
[47:39.910 --> 47:43.270]  through photosynthesis doesn't have to be expelled
[47:43.270 --> 47:45.870]  as much into the soil to get those nutrients
[47:45.870 --> 47:48.870]  in a good carbon ratio that it needs.
[47:48.870 --> 47:50.430]  It doesn't have to spend its carbon
[47:50.430 --> 47:51.670]  and sequestering on that.
[47:51.670 --> 47:54.510]  It can build it more into, you know,
[47:54.510 --> 47:57.510]  the fats and lipids and secondary metabolites,
[47:57.510 --> 47:58.990]  the things that we're after.
[47:58.990 --> 48:00.710]  And then that's kind of the difference.
[48:00.710 --> 48:03.270]  So it's like, I think it's always pitted that,
[48:03.270 --> 48:04.790]  you know, one is better than the other,
[48:04.790 --> 48:06.430]  but I don't think it's that way.
[48:06.430 --> 48:09.110]  And I was trying to get that across with Leighton
[48:09.110 --> 48:11.010]  a little bit too, is like,
[48:11.010 --> 48:14.790]  I think guys can do really good hydroponically,
[48:14.790 --> 48:15.630]  you know what I'm saying?
[48:15.630 --> 48:20.630]  But it's gotta be really mindful of that ratio
[48:20.670 --> 48:24.470]  and how well is the plant able to keep up
[48:24.470 --> 48:26.790]  with the amount of nutrients you're applying to it
[48:26.790 --> 48:29.870]  to balance those with the carbon that it needs.
[48:29.870 --> 48:30.910]  You know what I mean?
[48:31.910 --> 48:34.510]  Leighton, jump in on that.
[48:34.510 --> 48:36.430]  Oh man.
[48:36.430 --> 48:38.870]  Smiley, you still gotta send me some of that bud.
[48:40.930 --> 48:43.990]  But no, I think that, you know, you're right.
[48:43.990 --> 48:46.750]  And I think the real key to the whole thing
[48:46.750 --> 48:48.510]  is the biologics.
[48:48.510 --> 48:50.430]  I mean, we have proven,
[48:50.430 --> 48:53.390]  and I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[48:53.390 --> 48:55.910]  there's only one thing that we have not been able
[48:55.910 --> 49:00.230]  to break down, and that is the forever chemical
[49:00.270 --> 49:04.270]  that's used in fireproofing and Teflon coatings.
[49:04.270 --> 49:05.810]  Roundup has been broken,
[49:05.810 --> 49:08.630]  and that's why they've increased the strength fivefold,
[49:08.630 --> 49:11.630]  because a lot of these plants are now getting to the,
[49:11.630 --> 49:16.630]  or a lot of this biodactery in the soil
[49:16.630 --> 49:19.650]  have figured out how to break that bond.
[49:19.650 --> 49:22.310]  Remember, it goes back to this planet
[49:22.310 --> 49:23.790]  was completely in hospital.
[49:23.790 --> 49:24.830]  You couldn't live on it.
[49:24.830 --> 49:29.030]  There was no life here, you know, billions of years ago.
[49:29.030 --> 49:33.230]  So how did it end up that it turned into the Garden of Eden?
[49:33.230 --> 49:36.430]  And, you know, this again is one of the reasons
[49:36.430 --> 49:38.470]  why I promote fish brew so much,
[49:38.470 --> 49:43.470]  because it has so many of these specialty biology
[49:45.390 --> 49:49.390]  that breaks down, you know, phosphate solubilizing,
[49:49.390 --> 49:51.710]  potassium solubilizing bacteria,
[49:51.710 --> 49:54.350]  all kinds of aquatic fungi,
[49:54.350 --> 49:57.510]  that we don't even truly understand the processes yet,
[49:57.510 --> 49:59.990]  but we do know that they can live both terrestrial
[49:59.990 --> 50:01.550]  as well as aquatic.
[50:01.550 --> 50:03.270]  So in many ways, you know,
[50:03.270 --> 50:06.690]  to get that diversity back into play,
[50:08.630 --> 50:09.950]  you need something like that.
[50:09.950 --> 50:12.890]  You need an inoculant that is in, you know,
[50:12.890 --> 50:17.890]  in growing out in vivo, so in nature, not in vitro.
[50:19.550 --> 50:23.270]  You know, and so back to the point on, you know,
[50:23.270 --> 50:24.990]  what Smiley was saying is that, yeah, you know,
[50:25.990 --> 50:29.470]  I know that it's possible to grow plants in an aquaponics
[50:29.470 --> 50:33.190]  or aquaculture or aquaponics or hydroponic system.
[50:33.190 --> 50:36.710]  Yeah, but what is the environmental cost of that?
[50:36.710 --> 50:40.350]  You know, Brandon touched on the fact that, you know,
[50:40.350 --> 50:43.670]  like say you take natural gas and convert it
[50:43.670 --> 50:48.090]  into an ammoniacal form or a nitrogen form.
[50:49.350 --> 50:53.790]  What was the cost of energy to produce
[50:53.830 --> 50:57.470]  that 50 pound sack of urea?
[50:57.470 --> 51:00.550]  And there was a study, Jesus,
[51:00.550 --> 51:02.070]  it was probably 10 years ago,
[51:03.110 --> 51:06.710]  on somebody had actually taken the time to calculate it.
[51:06.710 --> 51:10.470]  And it was like 50 barrels of crude
[51:10.470 --> 51:15.350]  or equal amount of natural gas to turn,
[51:15.350 --> 51:18.190]  to produce that one bag.
[51:18.190 --> 51:22.190]  And then the cost to ship that bag was on top of all that.
[51:22.190 --> 51:25.030]  So, you know, again, this is why we go back to,
[51:25.030 --> 51:26.510]  and maybe you're right, Smiley,
[51:26.510 --> 51:29.350]  maybe we shouldn't call it organic versus synthetic.
[51:29.350 --> 51:34.350]  But if you're utilizing local resources that are organic,
[51:34.870 --> 51:37.510]  you are in many ways.
[51:38.930 --> 51:41.390]  So that's organic as a practice, right?
[51:41.390 --> 51:43.430]  Because that's what we're talking about
[51:43.430 --> 51:45.710]  with synthetic versus organic,
[51:45.710 --> 51:48.850]  because people who typically are using synthetics
[51:48.850 --> 51:51.590]  aren't being mindful of the cost of production
[51:51.990 --> 51:55.790]  because it can be done as equal with the production rate
[51:55.790 --> 51:58.510]  and the quality, everything,
[51:58.510 --> 52:01.990]  but it can be done with a less carbon footprint
[52:01.990 --> 52:05.290]  using, you know, like LEDs as opposed to HPS.
[52:06.350 --> 52:09.830]  Instead of throwing out your media every time,
[52:09.830 --> 52:11.430]  you could be reusing the soil
[52:11.430 --> 52:13.890]  and just doing some small amending.
[52:15.950 --> 52:19.390]  And Brandon, that was always my bitch with hydroponic,
[52:19.390 --> 52:20.910]  is nutrient crash.
[52:20.910 --> 52:23.510]  So there's still a tremendous amount of nutrient available
[52:23.510 --> 52:28.510]  in that media water, but because it's getting-
[52:28.510 --> 52:31.270]  Yeah, it's super, super wasteful.
[52:31.270 --> 52:33.110]  And the thing is, it's not cost-effective.
[52:33.110 --> 52:34.890]  And so that's the difference.
[52:34.890 --> 52:36.430]  What happens to all that wastewater?
[52:36.430 --> 52:39.510]  Those molecules have to go somewhere, right?
[52:39.510 --> 52:43.270]  And that's the whole, like,
[52:44.750 --> 52:47.790]  hydroponics are effective because they're delivering
[52:47.790 --> 52:49.870]  an ionic form of what the plant needs.
[52:49.870 --> 52:52.610]  Now, if they figure out that balance and get it to work,
[52:52.610 --> 52:55.190]  it'll work and they can make it happen.
[52:55.190 --> 52:58.430]  I grew, dude, I grew hydroponics for 11 years
[52:58.430 --> 52:59.910]  before I switched to soil.
[53:00.830 --> 53:05.830]  And it's just, it's organic as the practice.
[53:06.110 --> 53:09.390]  True organics, I love that.
[53:09.390 --> 53:13.030]  You know, that takes really your own piece of land
[53:13.030 --> 53:15.710]  because it's the practical application of,
[53:15.710 --> 53:20.710]  am I gonna invest on something that I don't even own?
[53:20.790 --> 53:22.670]  So a lot of people don't have the ability
[53:22.670 --> 53:24.870]  to do what is true organic,
[53:24.870 --> 53:26.670]  where they can remediate their own land,
[53:26.670 --> 53:30.030]  they can take and grow their own food
[53:30.030 --> 53:31.510]  and they can make their own bio-waste,
[53:31.510 --> 53:33.430]  they can collect their own microbes, they can do,
[53:33.430 --> 53:34.670]  I love all that stuff,
[53:34.670 --> 53:36.830]  but there's not always a practical application for it.
[53:36.830 --> 53:38.790]  And when we're talking about cannabis
[53:38.790 --> 53:41.410]  and the cannabis business and specifically,
[53:42.410 --> 53:46.290]  a lot of times that's just not the case at all, right?
[53:46.290 --> 53:48.730]  It's like, oh, this is like, we're renting out a warehouse,
[53:48.730 --> 53:49.850]  we're doing everything indoor,
[53:49.850 --> 53:53.250]  we're doing everything with rockwool and salts and HPS.
[53:53.250 --> 53:57.070]  And it's like, it's very, very energy insufficient,
[53:57.070 --> 54:00.250]  the nutrient, the production for the nutrients,
[54:00.250 --> 54:02.010]  production for all of the media
[54:02.010 --> 54:03.970]  and the constant having to do, you know,
[54:03.970 --> 54:08.090]  so, you know, as someone who understands
[54:08.090 --> 54:10.130]  and take a holistic approach, yeah,
[54:10.210 --> 54:11.670]  look, there's still gonna be business,
[54:11.670 --> 54:13.530]  people are still gonna grow indoor weed,
[54:13.530 --> 54:15.810]  a lot of people are gonna be against that,
[54:15.810 --> 54:18.750]  but you can't please everybody, you know?
[54:18.750 --> 54:21.410]  I love the fact that people have their own land
[54:21.410 --> 54:23.390]  and they can remediate and grow sun grown
[54:23.390 --> 54:26.010]  and do terroir cannabis, that's fucking beautiful,
[54:26.010 --> 54:27.690]  I absolutely love that, you know?
[54:27.690 --> 54:30.290]  A lot of people don't have the ability to do so,
[54:30.290 --> 54:33.530]  so like for my system, what I try to do,
[54:33.530 --> 54:36.170]  I don't try to do it, I do it successfully.
[54:36.170 --> 54:38.690]  I go into a place and I make sure that
[54:39.690 --> 54:44.690]  they're set up so they can at least be as energy efficient,
[54:45.930 --> 54:49.010]  to be as environmentally conscious
[54:49.910 --> 54:54.910]  and to have a low impact for what they're doing
[54:56.890 --> 55:01.890]  as opposed to another style of cultivation, right?
[55:03.430 --> 55:05.370]  That's all I'm getting at, it's like,
[55:05.370 --> 55:10.290]  I'll tell you straight up, my boy over at Organic Glaze Farm
[55:10.290 --> 55:15.290]  you can find him on IG, at Organic Glaze Farms,
[55:15.970 --> 55:20.970]  all one word, he's hitting two pounds per 480 watt LED
[55:21.290 --> 55:22.770]  that he's running right now, dude,
[55:22.770 --> 55:27.770]  so you can get the weight, you can get the quality
[55:28.250 --> 55:32.330]  and he's hitting almost 30% THC and 4% terps.
[55:33.330 --> 55:38.330]  So there's no doubt that it can be done, because it can.
[55:39.970 --> 55:43.210]  It's just about decreasing your overhead,
[55:43.210 --> 55:47.730]  decreasing your inputs, decreasing your labor
[55:47.730 --> 55:50.210]  and your usage and your footprint
[55:50.210 --> 55:53.130]  when it comes to these types of systems.
[55:55.130 --> 55:56.450]  That's where I'm at with it.
[55:56.450 --> 55:59.050]  Well, but I think the suits,
[55:59.050 --> 56:00.330]  the ones that are usually putting together
[56:00.330 --> 56:03.290]  these hydroponic setups or more of you in the background,
[56:03.290 --> 56:05.090]  they think that it's going to be cheaper,
[56:05.090 --> 56:07.870]  but the reality is, is that on the other side,
[56:07.870 --> 56:10.010]  the farmers know that we have to build a brand enough
[56:10.010 --> 56:13.410]  to where people are willing to drive past other dispensaries
[56:13.410 --> 56:15.610]  to come get the bud that you're producing.
[56:15.610 --> 56:17.290]  And the quality aspect is really
[56:17.290 --> 56:18.730]  what's always gonna shine through.
[56:18.730 --> 56:21.810]  So unless you have a super elite farmer
[56:21.810 --> 56:24.930]  that you can back in a hydroponic setup,
[56:24.930 --> 56:28.550]  I think from a skillset point of view and having a team run,
[56:28.550 --> 56:31.910]  it's so much easier to go more of on a soil route
[56:31.910 --> 56:34.710]  than when the team's trying to manage hydroponics.
[56:34.710 --> 56:37.510]  You know, when we were managing hydroponics in Colorado,
[56:37.510 --> 56:39.550]  just the algae and stuff that would build up
[56:39.550 --> 56:40.830]  on something like that.
[56:40.830 --> 56:44.990]  And just the overall team effort and stuff just wasn't there.
[56:44.990 --> 56:48.310]  Like it was just a different growing experience back then
[56:48.310 --> 56:49.630]  and trying to figure things out
[56:49.630 --> 56:52.150]  and constantly messing up the pHs.
[56:52.150 --> 56:54.910]  And one employee would mix the batch
[56:54.910 --> 56:56.350]  at a different rate than the other.
[56:56.350 --> 56:58.290]  And the plants would respond to that,
[56:59.030 --> 57:01.010]  or one individual would only come in on Saturdays
[57:01.010 --> 57:02.830]  or sometimes Sundays and water.
[57:02.830 --> 57:05.490]  They watered differently than the other two during the week.
[57:05.490 --> 57:07.610]  So it was just a constant battle with that stuff
[57:07.610 --> 57:10.450]  where if you're really trying to build something
[57:10.450 --> 57:12.490]  from the ground up, again,
[57:12.490 --> 57:14.570]  that's why I think Living Soil needs to be at the forefront
[57:14.570 --> 57:15.690]  of a lot of these platforms,
[57:15.690 --> 57:18.330]  because not enough people are saying that
[57:18.330 --> 57:19.530]  in these little board meetings
[57:19.530 --> 57:21.970]  when they're making decisions like this.
[57:21.970 --> 57:23.330]  Well, there's a lot of things
[57:23.330 --> 57:25.250]  that are gonna be changing too,
[57:25.250 --> 57:30.250]  because as you have to think of it like this,
[57:30.290 --> 57:35.290]  it is a plant and there's agronomic data
[57:35.490 --> 57:39.050]  that goes along with every other piece of land
[57:42.810 --> 57:44.650]  that a crop could be grown on.
[57:44.650 --> 57:47.730]  So if it's in the Midwest, the East Coast,
[57:47.730 --> 57:50.410]  and it's like different vegetables, there's data.
[57:50.410 --> 57:52.370]  It's all, there's tons of it.
[57:52.370 --> 57:57.130]  Now, data has been collected through universities
[57:57.130 --> 58:00.170]  for other studies, including cannabis,
[58:00.170 --> 58:03.970]  and people like myself have been collecting data
[58:03.970 --> 58:07.490]  for years now.
[58:08.490 --> 58:12.210]  And I think what it comes down to is
[58:15.050 --> 58:18.770]  you have to end up treating it like an ag crop,
[58:18.770 --> 58:20.050]  and it will be.
[58:20.290 --> 58:24.650]  I think that the cost of production at scale,
[58:24.650 --> 58:26.570]  when you start scaling huge systems
[58:26.570 --> 58:29.650]  with tons of nutrient and tons of rock wool
[58:29.650 --> 58:32.810]  and tons of things that are just getting thrown out,
[58:34.850 --> 58:36.970]  because there are gonna be people that come online
[58:36.970 --> 58:40.050]  with federal legislation that are huge,
[58:40.050 --> 58:41.770]  and it's just not even feasible
[58:41.770 --> 58:43.330]  to be able to do something like that.
[58:43.330 --> 58:44.170]  You know what I mean?
[58:44.170 --> 58:46.810]  But you could still do really well
[58:47.770 --> 58:52.290]  if you were in soil, treating it as an ag crop, right?
[58:52.290 --> 58:55.090]  Making sure you have nutritional sufficiency,
[58:55.090 --> 58:56.690]  making sure things are balanced,
[58:56.690 --> 58:58.770]  making sure you have organic matter,
[58:58.770 --> 59:02.210]  doing some microbial inoculations and biostimulants.
[59:03.210 --> 59:07.250]  Those things exponentially increase the quality of crops,
[59:07.250 --> 59:09.170]  the yields, all those things.
[59:10.690 --> 59:12.330]  You know, I'm gonna add one thing on this,
[59:12.330 --> 59:14.810]  and you're absolutely right, Brandon.
[59:14.810 --> 59:16.970]  It's going to go that way.
[59:16.970 --> 59:20.250]  And as soon as the walls come down
[59:20.250 --> 59:23.530]  and it's nationally legalized,
[59:23.530 --> 59:26.090]  and we move into other markets,
[59:26.090 --> 59:28.610]  South America's gonna kick our frigging ass.
[59:28.610 --> 59:30.530]  And if you've invested millions of dollars
[59:30.530 --> 59:34.410]  into an indoor facility, you're fucking shit out of luck,
[59:34.410 --> 59:36.570]  because the cost of production
[59:36.570 --> 59:38.970]  is gonna be the driving factor.
[59:38.970 --> 59:40.010]  And at the end of the day,
[59:40.010 --> 59:44.170]  if someone can save 50 bucks on a bag of weed,
[59:44.170 --> 59:46.010]  they're gonna pick the other shit.
[59:46.010 --> 59:49.010]  And Kevin Javid is on this.
[59:49.010 --> 59:50.970]  It's because there's different markets too, right?
[59:50.970 --> 59:53.630]  The people, look at what I,
[59:55.570 --> 59:57.610]  I do not smoke the same weed that I used to smoke
[59:57.610 --> 01:00:01.250]  when I first started smoking weed, vastly different quality.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.450]  And it's like that for everybody,
[01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.010]  because not everybody can just start off
[01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.330]  and like, no, hey, this is what it is.
[01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:11.330]  Unless they have somebody that really knows what's up,
[01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:15.530]  you know, that's been in it for a while,
[01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.650]  they can tell the difference between good quality weed
[01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:21.210]  and stuff that's been sitting on a shelf for a year.
[01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:26.010]  And so there's different markets.
[01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.450]  There's people who want good quality weed,
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:30.730]  and then there's people who are new to it
[01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.490]  or people who are on a budget, which is okay too.
[01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:36.150]  And there are going to be people
[01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:41.150]  that can create and grow great produce
[01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:44.650]  great product at exponentially lower price
[01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:51.210]  doing, you know, ad science stuff, you know?
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.670]  And it's gonna be, it'll be cheaper for the,
[01:00:56.530 --> 01:01:01.250]  it'll be cheaper for the, you know, the new consumer,
[01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.250]  you know, the conscious, the money conscious consumer,
[01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.090]  you know?
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.740]  There is a few people putting out that meme
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.100]  where it's like, you know,
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.560]  getting like real corporate cannabis weed
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.140]  is like getting your sushi from 7-Eleven.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.500]  And I think a lot of people out there,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.460]  if they only knew what was going on behind the curtain,
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.640]  they would view it that way
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.980]  and want to spend the extra money
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.500]  just for almost like your own health, you know,
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.980]  your personal health insurance
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.780]  so that you don't pay to actually start to destroy yourself
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.620]  with just heavy chemicals.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:39.120]  And before all this really started to get regulated,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.340]  you know, Eagle 20 and products like that
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.180]  were continually being sprayed here in Colorado
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.900]  and then people are smoking the flower with that
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.740]  and getting sick.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.260]  And so things have changed dramatically
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.480]  from that point of view.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.220]  When you guys are talking more like when you're saying
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.820]  like synthetics versus organics,
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.900]  I do want to get out that it's,
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.900]  if you're smoking or if you're growing cannabis,
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.820]  I mean, that is all one community.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.260]  Like that is the goal, but I have to be realistic.
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.320]  I think Layton's realistic that most of the people
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.160]  that spend the time listening to this are newer farmers
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.920]  or at least want to maybe dip their toe
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.620]  into see how they can grow using this
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:20.220]  and maybe see the differences in a synthetic world
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.100]  and an organic world.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.680]  So I just appreciate you guys taking complex subjects
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.480]  and being able to kind of, you know,
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.940]  toss the volleyball back and forth
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.440]  and let the viewers try to figure out what they want to do
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.300]  because there are a lot of fantastic farmers
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.380]  that are growing hydroponically.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.200]  But to be fair, they've earned that.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.340]  That has taken them years to get to
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:46.020]  where with a living soil or growing more with an organic,
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:49.860]  there's in a soil system, there's more of a forgiveness,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:50.960]  especially when you're growing more
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.860]  with a living soil system.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.420]  If you learn to manage that system and trust the process,
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:58.200]  I think you'll be light years ahead of
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.460]  if you were trying to manage a synthetic system
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.140]  without the right skillset.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.780]  But look at it, if you start off with a soil
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.740]  that doesn't have nutritional sufficiency
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.740]  or it's off balance, you can't just like add biology
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.100]  and you can't just, you know,
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.540]  put some more compost in there and like hope for the best.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.380]  You're gonna still end up having issues
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.980]  because you have to have, there has to be balance in there.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.820]  You know, it has to be balanced out.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.600]  This goes back to why it's so important to test.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.340]  So if you're bringing soil in
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.860]  or you're making your own soil, if you don't test it,
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.340]  you have no idea, you're flying blind.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.980]  You have no idea what you're doing.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.020]  And then-
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:46.540]  That's like the soil that I'm gonna be having manufactured,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.460]  I'll have a couple of different blends
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:53.460]  and it'll have the same tests that I use as a consultant
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.680]  and the same tests that I use myself,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.020]  those same target nutritional levels that I strive for,
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.340]  for my different targets, for different periods,
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.060]  that is what those soils are gonna be.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.900]  And they're gonna come out of the gate like that.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.780]  It's not gonna have to,
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.660]  you're not gonna have to add anything into it.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.560]  It'll just be already there when you get it.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.300]  And it'll have a little sheet on there.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.020]  It'll have it all printed out.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.980]  But you'll have to amend it after the first run, right?
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.740]  Oh yeah, that's the thing because so much gets pulled out.
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.780]  And one of the things that you can do,
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.220]  which is really, really cool, right?
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.700]  Because nitrogen is slowly released
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.660]  and phosphorus is slowly released
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.380]  from the breakdown of that organic matter,
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.580]  it is a really important component
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.460]  to get your material into that system.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.500]  And so having earthworms or having micro arthropods,
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.620]  things that can help break those things down
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.260]  because that's a slow release source of nitrogen.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.960]  So when I have a soil and I'm looking at sufficiency,
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.180]  I'm looking at how much I'm gonna need
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.300]  to get through a whole cycle.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:10.300]  And I'll be like, it's usually 200 to 150
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.100]  depending on the length of time for veg and the flower time.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.300]  It could be more though.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.180]  And if you have, if you load it up with an amendment
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.340]  that you know that is gonna break down
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.900]  this much over a certain amount of time,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.700]  you know that you're gonna have a sufficient amount
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.260]  of nitrogen in that system.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.580]  If you're always putting all of your biomass
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.620]  that's wasted back into your system,
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.660]  you're gonna always,
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.380]  as long as you're doing that consistently,
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.020]  you'll get to a point in time where you'll always have
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.500]  at least the base amount.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:50.060]  In theory, you should be able to have a base amount
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.420]  of nitrogen for the plant
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.300]  because the plant doesn't necessarily need
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.300]  that 200 or 150 parts per million
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.580]  that it has right at the beginning.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:04.100]  It just has access to that much.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.500]  It could be fine as long as there's always,
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:13.500]  let's say 70 or 40 PPM depends on what stage you're in
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.740]  or how big the plan is.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.660]  As long as there's a consistent amount there,
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:21.860]  then you're all right.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.420]  From an agronomic perspective, I'll load it up
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.700]  so I know that I'm gonna have this much at the beginning
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.780]  and it'll get eaten up slowly.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.220]  And you could see that as you test,
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.460]  you can see your nitrogen levels be depleted
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.940]  as the plant gets bigger.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.860]  It translates really well if you were to graph it out.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.140]  Again though, most people don't put their biomass
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.380]  back into those systems.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.740]  And so it's, you're potentially,
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.180]  you're missing something.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.660]  There's something there in that.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.100]  It's that breakdown, that extra carbon that's in there,
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.940]  the extra mineral nutrition that's there
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.380]  available for the biology.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.220]  It acts as kind of a top mulch layer
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.540]  to help make a little microclimate
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.060]  between the two surfaces of the soil
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:19.020]  and the other side of the material.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.140]  So it has a lot of benefits.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.420]  And in these soil systems, you can do that
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.220]  and you can get that cycling going.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.820]  And it takes a little time,
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.300]  but if you're in a synthetic system, you can't do that.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.580]  You can't have access to a lot of these microbes
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.020]  that produce secondary metabolites
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.700]  that trigger gene responses.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.500]  And those things could potentially change the profile,
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.300]  the terpene expressions,
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:59.300]  the plant's ability to express itself physically,
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.180]  which is gonna include its cannabinoid content
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.380]  and its terpene profiles.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.700]  And it's one of the reasons why you get
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:10.780]  these higher expressions.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:17.020]  If you have someone who grows good organic weed
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.420]  and someone that grows good synthetic weed,
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:24.940]  you're typically gonna see a higher terpene percentage.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.020]  You might not always see a higher THC percentage,
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.540]  but in my experience, you most definitely
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:35.660]  will see a higher terpene percentage.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:39.780]  You most definitely will see a higher terpene content.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:41.860]  And for me, that's one of the most important things
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:43.380]  because that's gonna be responsible
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.340]  for the flavor and the taste.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.580]  And I like to taste my weed.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.740]  Weed should taste good.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.300]  Your shit shouldn't taste like burnt weed.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.500]  It should taste like it should have a flavor.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.740]  Like, ooh, I can taste like tangerine in that.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.340]  Like, that's really interesting.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.140]  Or like, ooh, I can really taste the pine in this one.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.100]  Leighton and I, at the beginning of this little journey,
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.900]  we interviewed a guy, AJ, from Growing Organic.
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.580]  He used to be with Build-A-Soil.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.580]  And when he entered his GMO flower into Sticky Lungs Cup,
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.580]  there was just this unbelievable look and smell to it
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.700]  that was just cream of the crop.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.100]  And a lot of individuals, I was even told
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.700]  that the gentleman from Root Wise Organics,
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.260]  he picked AJ's weed based on that
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.220]  because of, without knowing whose it was,
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.020]  just because of how much the actual smell
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.820]  coming through a glass jar was just extremely impressive.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:51.100]  So getting more into this,
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.780]  back to the salts versus organics,
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.220]  there was a question too, Smiley.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.100]  There's other cups, we've even mentioned that,
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.940]  I think, before where synthetics comes through
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:03.140]  and there's probably some merit to that as well.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.660]  But in my opinion, when I've seen a lot of the cups
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.220]  where it's peer to peer and a lot of individuals
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.260]  take it realistic and it's not just a one day event,
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.260]  they give you the cannabis and allow you to smoke it
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.420]  with weeks before the cup.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.820]  Living soil seems to always shine through with that,
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.380]  back to back with stickies.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.460]  So there was a personal question,
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.340]  ask Smiley, do synthetic salts
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.860]  disrupt a living soil system in any way?
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.800]  I don't know, I don't use them.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.800]  To my understanding, they do.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.160]  I really, I don't have the, I guess,
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.840]  under knowledge to speak on that,
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.000]  but I will agree with you though.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.960]  And then Brandon just touched on it
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.520]  and it was what I had written down
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.400]  is that's the biggest difference, I think,
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.600]  that we could even speak on is that the DNA in the plant
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.640]  is responding to its environment.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.720]  And the more diverse that environment is,
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.920]  it's gonna trigger the plant in different ways.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.720]  So like Brandon kind of mentioned,
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.440]  there's biology that signals the plant to do certain things.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.920]  And we know that's the case because we'll talk about
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.120]  chitin being a, generating a response
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.400]  or salicylic acid generating response.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.400]  So we know some of these compounds do these things
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.720]  and that's the biggest.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.000]  What about the ability for-
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.640]  Trigger, I think.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.000]  Here's a good one too, right?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  Just the ability for an organic system,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.840]  for the plants that are growing an organic system
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.480]  to be able to acquire amino acids
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.520]  from the breakdown of organic matter.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.520]  Or if you're like me, you use them for your nitrogen source.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.260]  In a hydroponic system, there's no available amino acids
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.480]  for the plant to sequester.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.560]  And amino acids, the amino acids that plants can sequester
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.060]  are kind of like the beginning steps, the go steps
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:07.000]  for a lot of biosynthetic pathways to be stimulated
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.240]  and a lot of chemicals to be,
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.540]  like it's the base of what they are built from.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.920]  And so when you have the ability to take up
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.600]  a wider variety of trace mineral elements, amino acids,
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.040]  some of these other low weight molecular organic compounds
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.400]  that you can only get from the soil systems.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.840]  Again, when we're talking about what he was saying,
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.840]  dude, the up regulation is genes and proteins
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.840]  that are coded from the ribosome.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.120]  Like all that stuff happens in depending on their environment
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.960]  on a cellular level and what they have access to,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.320]  they'll up regulate or down regulate
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.160]  the way those things are transcripted.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.120]  So they'll write a really, really nice copy of a code.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.400]  Beautifully done, beautifully handwritten.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.020]  It's really well legible and everything about it is perfect.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.120]  Everybody can understand it and it gets the job done.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.400]  That's up regulation of gene transcription.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.000]  There's also happens when you're in a chaotic environment
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.960]  and what happens, you don't have all the things necessary.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.120]  It's written really badly out of pieced together things.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.600]  It's not fully complete, it's misspelled.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.040]  And so it doesn't get the job done as well.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.200]  It's like you might get an A plus on the first one
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.560]  and you might get like a C minus on the second one.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.240]  So if you put it in kind of those terms,
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.980]  I think it kind of helps me explain it
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.480]  the way that I think about it.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.760]  You know, something else that wasn't discussed
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.400]  in this last little round
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.040]  is the expression of minor cannabinoids.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.840]  You will only get those in a biological system
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.600]  where just as you said,
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.240]  these codes are transcript perfectly.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.800]  And so it's very easy for cell division
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.320]  and continued growth in the proper direction
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.400]  where all of the functions or the potential
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.560]  are being unlocked of the plant.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.680]  But yeah, that was a great explanation, Brandon.
[01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:35.890]  I guess this gentleman had a follow up.
[01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.410]  Does the synthetic salt build up over time?
[01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:43.510]  Yeah, well, see what happens is because it's a chemical,
[01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:45.730]  it reacts, right?
[01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.890]  It reacts as soon as you put it in water.
[01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:51.570]  And the reason why is because most people don't know
[01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:55.050]  what pH stands for, but pH stands for potential hydrogen
[01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:58.810]  because there's an amount of hydrogen in your water, right?
[01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:01.170]  That the amount of hydrogen is usually
[01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:03.930]  either an H plus or OH minus.
[01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:06.210]  And the more OH minus you have,
[01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:08.570]  the higher the pH will be,
[01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.170]  the more hydrogen you have, the lower the pH.
[01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:15.490]  It'll acidify the water with more hydrogen.
[01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.530]  And so what happens is when you put it in a chemical,
[01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:19.430]  it starts reacting with those hydrogen bonds
[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:22.770]  because those things want to react.
[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.370]  They have free electrons that are like,
[01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:28.050]  hey, we wanna like grab on to stuff.
[01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.850]  And so it starts reacting immediately.
[01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:33.890]  And then what happens is also because you have a chemical
[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:37.350]  that is in a ionic form and usually in a liquid solution,
[01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.490]  you'll put it into water, right?
[01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:45.930]  It'll react there.
[01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:50.250]  So becomes less bioavailable in that first action.
[01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.970]  And then you take that and then you put it into a system.
[01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:55.370]  And that system has a varying pH range.
[01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.370]  And depending on those pH ranges,
[01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.570]  a lot of those things start becoming unavailable
[01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:02.490]  and they'll start reacting with other things in that system,
[01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:06.730]  depending on things like temperature, hydrology, pH.
[01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:13.450]  So those are kind of factors that you have to consider.
[01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:15.750]  And so what happens is a lot of these things,
[01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.650]  they precipitate out of solution
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:21.810]  and precipitate out of their media
[01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:26.810]  as a chemical that can't be assimilated by the plant.
[01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:29.130]  Right, it has no use, it's just there.
[01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:31.530]  And it's an inorganic substance
[01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:33.490]  that is just sitting there.
[01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:36.090]  And oftentimes if it is a salt,
[01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:40.810]  it can cause osmotic interference
[01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:44.130]  from the plant being able to uptake water properly.
[01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:47.410]  It can really spike things like your EC.
[01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.730]  So it can just cause all kinds of issues
[01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:54.790]  as far as the system in general, even in hydroponics.
[01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:56.770]  And that's why the hydroponic media
[01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:58.290]  has to be replaced so often,
[01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:02.130]  because you can only run it so long
[01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.610]  before all those reactions have taken place
[01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:06.410]  and those things become unavailable.
[01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.130]  And it's also why they use chemicals
[01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:12.850]  to break back down those salts as well,
[01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.590]  because they can be broken down,
[01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:17.550]  but it takes either some type of enzymatic process
[01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:21.450]  or it has to be diluted heavily with water,
[01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:24.370]  or there's different ways
[01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.130]  to remediate these types of things.
[01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:30.450]  And don't forget the effect of salt on biology.
[01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:35.010]  Yeah, and the way that works is because
[01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:39.570]  the substances will have a charge associated,
[01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.330]  they'll have a polarity associated with it,
[01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:46.330]  and they will basically disrupt the membranes
[01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:51.970]  of these biologies by creating a kind of,
[01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:55.610]  you know, when I was talking about
[01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:00.910]  diffusion, how you have large,
[01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:05.570]  if you have a large quantity of regular water
[01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.170]  in a cellular membrane,
[01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:10.830]  and then you have a large quantity of sodium or salt
[01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:14.410]  or some type of chemical right on the outside of it,
[01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:19.410]  that chemical wants to diffuse into lower concentrations.
[01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:23.330]  And so if it does that, it contaminates those cells,
[01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:25.530]  they rupture, they don't function properly.
[01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:26.970]  Does that make sense?
[01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:32.190]  As always, great explanation, brother.
[01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.130]  So yeah, to answer the question,
[01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:36.610]  I guess that was given to Smiley,
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.450]  you guys agree that using synthetic salts
[01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.330]  is obviously gonna have some negative effect
[01:18:42.330 --> 01:18:45.450]  to your system, at least to your liver.
[01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:46.890]  Depends on how much, though, too.
[01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.010]  I mean, and the thing is, too,
[01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:50.730]  usually what would happen is
[01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:54.330]  you would see great results using it, right?
[01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:55.170]  You're gonna see,
[01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:57.650]  you might even see some biostimulating properties,
[01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:02.350]  but it's the compounding of using it over and over and over,
[01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.370]  it compiles a problem.
[01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:06.490]  So inherently, a lot of those same minerals
[01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:08.850]  can be used by biology,
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:11.970]  but it can also, if you didn't know what you were doing,
[01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:14.410]  you added something like a bunch of phosphate
[01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:18.330]  into your system, you could end up tying calcium up,
[01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:23.330]  you could end up tying up things like iron and zinc,
[01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.810]  and manganese, you know?
[01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.450]  So there's like a lot of different reactions
[01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:32.850]  that could possibly happen by over-applying,
[01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:36.130]  or even just applying small amounts
[01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:37.990]  over a long period of time
[01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.930]  without understanding your ratios
[01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:42.090]  of what needs to be balanced in these systems
[01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:44.330]  and what's happening with the system itself.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.220]  All right, I'm gonna try to condense,
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.460]  this was like a, almost a page question,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.580]  but is there a difference in synthetic salts
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.020]  where it's like maybe even simple kosher salt
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.380]  versus like a Himalayan salt?
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.780]  And if so, is there a synthetic salt
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.020]  that you would recommend that would not,
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.860]  well, I guess we're learning
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.060]  that it would still disrupt the living soil system,
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:13.460]  but that you would recommend that would be at least a pure
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:17.180]  or higher quality than just probably anything
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.020]  that's probably coming from China or something like that?
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.900]  Even if, does that even exist?
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.260]  I hope that's paraphrased enough.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.620]  It makes perfect sense because your source matters,
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.340]  your source, because wherever it's mined at
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:32.380]  and the source that it's mined from,
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.860]  you have to be able to test that mineral.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.780]  I went down to Texas earlier in the week
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.340]  and I sat down and I went over a huge list
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.200]  of different mineral amendments
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.700]  that we are going to have tested for heavy metals
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.820]  to make sure that these things are clean,
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.180]  because if we're building soil with them,
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.500]  we don't wanna put this in the system,
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.540]  we wanna start off clean.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.540]  So the source does matter because they can be brought in
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:01.020]  and it's the compound, again, compounding problems over time
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:04.740]  so being able to test, again, you can test and make sure,
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.380]  oh, what does the soil look like?
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.460]  What does this look like?
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.980]  If you're a small scale farmer,
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.620]  you gotta be able to find companies
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.300]  that are able to do that.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.980]  And there's a bunch of good people
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.700]  that have good quality products on the market.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:25.300]  But there's a lot of things on the market
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:28.820]  that also have high metal content, heavy metal content.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.700]  So you have to be aware of that.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:35.500]  The source is really important
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.860]  and it's important whether it's inorganic
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.860]  or if it's organic, if it's just a mined thing
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.640]  or if it's synthetically created.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:56.380]  Yeah, Leighton or Smiley, you have anything to add to that?
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.540]  I just wanted to touch back on that,
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.180]  do salts affect biology?
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.740]  There's one example that we do know of
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.580]  and people talk about commonly is like,
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.500]  if you're applying available phosphorus,
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.860]  your plant's not necessarily gonna make a relationship
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.660]  with mycorrhizal fungi.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.220]  So that's just one example of knowing that,
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:19.140]  yeah, supplying a nutrient like that
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:21.740]  can affect the biology of the soil.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.740]  So that being said, I think there's a lot to that
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.300]  that could be looked at more.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:32.580]  The term of, I guess, I peeked over,
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.220]  chat was flying by too fast.
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.980]  But it comes back to that idea of a microbial collapse
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.540]  or a collapse of the soil food web in that system.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.140]  So if you know you can affect one part of it
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.700]  and it's obvious that it would affect
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.500]  other higher level parts of that system as well.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:57.420]  Well, so there's so much biology in the soil
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:02.100]  that and it's always in flux, it's always changing.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.460]  Just because something's there
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.300]  and you can quantify it at one moment,
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.460]  doesn't mean that it's gonna be the same always, right?
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.220]  The only way that you could do that
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:17.140]  is by doing things like greenhouse or indoor cultivation
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.780]  where you're regulating temperature,
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.260]  you're regulating humidity,
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:24.100]  you're regulating every aspect of that environment.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.500]  And then you're also regulating your hydrology,
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:32.080]  but still as the soil chemistry changes,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.860]  so does the biology.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.700]  All of these things are inherently connected.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.220]  There is no difference between chemistry,
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.940]  there's no difference between physics,
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:43.580]  chemistry and biology.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.420]  There is only the different scales
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.540]  at which we are interpreting them.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:57.720]  Again, it goes back to those, everything is in flux.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.200]  It's always in flux.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.040]  Right, so.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.240]  And it's always just trying to create homeostasis
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.840]  within that fluctuating cycle.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.240]  If you can keep it how it's doing, you can,
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.380]  it's like, here's a good example, right?
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:17.060]  pH, your pH in a highly organic soil
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.060]  can quickly acidify and drop
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.460]  due to the release of things like organic acids
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:30.820]  and enzymes from the biology in the soil
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:36.380]  and from the release of that organic matter.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.740]  Now, different minerals can be absorbed at higher levels
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.300]  if the pH is decreased.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.540]  So let's say the plant is absorbing
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.380]  as much of these minerals as it is,
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.580]  and then you go and you fluctuate
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.740]  because your pH is a little bit too low
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.140]  and you compensate for that.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:57.780]  It might be going through these fluxes
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.940]  that are a good thing, right?
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:02.540]  Because some stuff isn't always available at this point.
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:03.520]  Here's an example.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  Manganese solubility spikes as pH drops.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.560]  Now, manganese is like kind of the king of micronutrients
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.120]  and it really helps with the onset of flowering.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.300]  And it also helps with early bulking.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.440]  And so if you knew that and you were to go,
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.360]  just let your pH naturally fall in your organic system,
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.520]  in early flower,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.200]  and then make your pH adjustments afterwards,
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.800]  okay, I'm gonna go ahead and now do my pH adjustments,
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.360]  bring this thing back up to six from like 5.8.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.680]  And then you're going through,
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.680]  then you're increasing the availability
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.060]  of some of those other nutrients.
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.760]  Or think about like this.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.600]  If you do have a constant pH,
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.880]  let's say your pH is right around like six
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.380]  or something like that, or six, three, wherever it's at.
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:13.920]  And you go and use like a microbial product
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.360]  like my Micro Plus.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.800]  If you're adding the recommended amount,
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.760]  which is about an ounce to a gallon,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.100]  it's gonna drop the pH of your water, right?
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.800]  And so you might have be watering with clean water
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.720]  that's like, you know, 5.0.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.100]  Now for that moment in time, when you do that watering,
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:39.500]  you're gonna slightly acidify the soil momentarily.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.860]  And what that's gonna do is it's gonna create
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:45.340]  some availability of the nutrients
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:50.340]  that are more soluble at that lower pH range.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:52.540]  Now the soil is gonna buffer that
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.720]  and it's gonna go back to normal.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.500]  But then let's say you're using your water
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.060]  and then there's another, you go, you're like,
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.300]  hey, I need to add a little bit of potassium.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.980]  And you add that into your water source.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:10.380]  And like a water soluble potassium sulfate, for instance,
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.700]  you added that into your water system
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.900]  and it jacks the pH of your clean water up to like 10, right?
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.420]  And your soil system still sitting at that six or six, three
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.140]  and you go in and you water with that.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:27.140]  Then in that instance, the differentiation between that pH
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.700]  is gonna have a different solubility of nutrients
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.700]  for that slightly, for that period of time
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.860]  while you're watering that in, right?
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.860]  And so these fluxes are always changing
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.100]  depending on what you're doing.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.700]  And even just with your water, right?
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:50.080]  Because your pH of your system could be at one thing,
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.140]  your water's that different.
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.420]  And so there's constant chemistry that's happening.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:00.860]  The exchange of hydrogen atoms, man, it's complicated.
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.060]  It's complex, there's a lot going on.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.780]  No, you explained that really well, man.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:09.380]  Cause I've never really thought of it in that manner
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:11.140]  of like kind of just messing around with pH
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:14.620]  and getting more of the trace minerals, I guess,
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.100]  that the miners and then really getting the full aspect
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.740]  of what you're trying to farm.
[01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:26.210]  I mean, the reason why we keep things in a range, right?
[01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:28.430]  We keep it in a range that works best,
[01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:29.770]  but even at that range,
[01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:32.770]  things like iron are still greatly unavailable.
[01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:35.530]  Especially in these highly organic systems.
[01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:40.050]  Phosphate, really like it really gets real soluble
[01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:41.970]  at really lower pHs.
[01:28:41.970 --> 01:28:44.810]  So if you're able to add those types of biology
[01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:49.130]  that live and operate at those ranges, you're getting that.
[01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:51.570]  That's why I use these bio-stimulants, you know?
[01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:53.570]  Because for that period of time,
[01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:57.650]  I have a microbial consortium that has a food source
[01:28:57.650 --> 01:28:59.490]  that's gonna temporarily drop.
[01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:01.930]  And it's gonna get me some of those other things
[01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:05.050]  that are a lot harder to get at the regular pH ranges.
[01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:10.050]  So I'm helping facilitate the uptake and transport
[01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:13.050]  of specific elements when you do that.
[01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.450]  And I can know what those are.
[01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:20.170]  It's like phosphate, manganese, iron.
[01:29:20.170 --> 01:29:25.170]  Those both go up when your soil pH drops.
[01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.970]  And then you get better calcium uptake
[01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:32.410]  at magnesium and potassium uptake
[01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:34.330]  at a little higher pH ranges than that.
[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:38.030]  So it's balance right there.
[01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:43.050]  Iron seems to be just something special
[01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:46.330]  that we just definitely don't talk enough about.
[01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:49.410]  And it does seem like the higher end farmers,
[01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.050]  that's kind of what they start to talk more of.
[01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:54.530]  Highly biologically dependent.
[01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:59.570]  It's because most higher order plants,
[01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:05.530]  you need and assimilate ferric iron,
[01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.010]  and that's Fe2.
[01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:17.370]  The oxidized iron is used,
[01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:22.650]  but I think like mostly in just some grasses or something,
[01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.250]  I think is what I read about.
[01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:28.270]  So they can use, some plants can use both kinds,
[01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:29.450]  but for the most part,
[01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:35.810]  and the problem is the pH range that it stays available
[01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:41.450]  in that specific ionic form and with water,
[01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:45.250]  it just doesn't want to stay in that form.
[01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:48.090]  It oxidizes so easily.
[01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.450]  I mean, you could see the chemical reaction
[01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:53.770]  of oxidation take place with iron,
[01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:56.610]  with real iron, pure iron, immediately.
[01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:58.370]  You put it in water and it turns red.
[01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:59.970]  You come back 15 minutes later,
[01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:04.330]  look at that blue mineral or that greenish blue mineral
[01:31:05.490 --> 01:31:09.930]  that was iron, iron sulfate becomes an oxidized substance.
[01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:12.250]  And that's exactly what happens
[01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:14.490]  with a lot of these minerals.
[01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:16.850]  That's why when they become oxidized,
[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:18.330]  they're not available to the plant
[01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:22.330]  and the biology has to convert back to an available form.
[01:31:22.330 --> 01:31:24.410]  Or you use something like a humic and full,
[01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:27.570]  look, why humic and fulvic acids?
[01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:30.250]  People never, I don't think are thinking of on the term
[01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:33.290]  that you're actually dropping the pH with these things.
[01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:35.450]  You're stimulating the biology
[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:39.050]  and then they're making biologically available
[01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:42.810]  these minerals at those pH ranges.
[01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:44.010]  So it works both ways.
[01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:47.090]  Some of the stuff is more highly biologically available,
[01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:48.250]  higher pH range.
[01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:49.970]  There's different ways to approach it,
[01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:54.970]  but using microbes and humic fulvic acids.
[01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:59.970]  I mean, that's how I kind of approach the,
[01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:05.410]  that is not the main approach,
[01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:08.210]  but it's one of the aspects of the approaches
[01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:11.650]  that I kind of look at when I'm looking at these systems.
[01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:14.650]  I agree with you a hundred percent.
[01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:17.890]  That fulvic acid is such a slow,
[01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:20.810]  a low molecular weight that it can absolutely be absorbed
[01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:22.690]  right into the cells.
[01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:24.890]  So that's, what's so powerful about that.
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:29.010]  And the humic acid just makes everything play nice.
[01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.130]  So even if it's not in the right pH range,
[01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:36.050]  it's going to allow it to be able to remineralize
[01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:36.890]  and be uptaken.
[01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:39.850]  So again, those are tricks that I hope
[01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:42.730]  the audience is listening to,
[01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:46.610]  is the power of humic and fulvic acids.
[01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:52.410]  From organic sources, that was old living things,
[01:32:52.410 --> 01:32:54.490]  whether it was a plant or an animal,
[01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:57.290]  but somehow it got compressed into brown coal
[01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:59.370]  or through heat and pressure over time.
[01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:00.190]  So think about it.
[01:33:00.190 --> 01:33:03.730]  Think about how plant available it actually is
[01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:05.830]  and powerful for the chemistry.
[01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:08.790]  It's one of the, you know,
[01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.990]  that carbon that we were talking about earlier,
[01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.950]  the reason why it is important
[01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:15.890]  is because there's microorganisms
[01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:19.630]  that utilize organic sources of carbon
[01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:22.530]  in their metabolism,
[01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:27.190]  as opposed to sequestering atmospheric carbon.
[01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:31.910]  And so if you have more
[01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:36.910]  biologically available carbon sources in your soil,
[01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:40.590]  then it acts as a bio-stimulant, you know?
[01:33:42.710 --> 01:33:44.990]  This segues into another question we had here
[01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:46.470]  from the audience.
[01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:49.990]  Is there such thing as too much carbon
[01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:51.390]  in a living soil system?
[01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.910]  Well, you'll immobilize your nitrogen, is what happens,
[01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:59.750]  because you stimulate biology
[01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:01.930]  and you have the out competition, right?
[01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:05.110]  You have that competition between microbes
[01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:06.510]  and you stimulate biology
[01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:11.110]  and you're basically mineralizing the nitrogen sometimes.
[01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:12.550]  Or if you do the wrong thing,
[01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:15.670]  you have a bunch of denitrifying bacteria,
[01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:18.790]  you convert all of the nitrogen in your system
[01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:21.590]  into atmospheric nitrogen and off gases.
[01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:23.790]  Or it ties it up
[01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:29.430]  inside of the actual cells of the biology itself,
[01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:34.790]  of the microbes itself.
[01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.710]  You guys got something to add to that?
[01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:41.350]  Is the carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:43.270]  So it's always trying to balance.
[01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:44.950]  So if you have an excess of carbon,
[01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:47.630]  it's gonna try to eat up whatever nitrogen's there.
[01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:49.070]  If you have an excess of nitrogen,
[01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:50.750]  it's gonna burn up your carbon
[01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:52.550]  until they get in that balance.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:55.150]  Okay, so here's a good example.
[01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:59.230]  If you use like complex carbohydrate,
[01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:01.070]  like molasses, for instance, right?
[01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:05.150]  So that has carbon in it, it's got hydrogen, oxygen,
[01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:09.510]  and like in its molecular form, right?
[01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:13.510]  It's a sugar, it's a complex carbohydrate.
[01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:17.910]  So when you add something like that into a soil system,
[01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:21.470]  it will temporarily stimulate the biology
[01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:25.510]  of whatever is in that soil at that time
[01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:30.510]  that can use that type of available carbon, right?
[01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:37.670]  That's an example of available carbon sources,
[01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.670]  glucose, right?
[01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:42.230]  Or suracose or these, a sugar.
[01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:48.110]  And so it'll utilize that, but in process of doing so,
[01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.830]  it'll also use the nitrogen from its environment.
[01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:54.470]  Some of them will use nitrogen from the atmosphere.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.740]  So it can go both ways.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:01.100]  Blayton, I think you were.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.340]  Yeah, yeah, the only thing I'd like to add to that
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.900]  is that we are talking about the cannabis plant, right?
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.180]  So there are some soil systems
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:12.060]  where you're going to have different relationships
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:14.340]  between C to N.
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:17.580]  And you will notice that there are specific types of plants
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:20.140]  that will grow in that particular environment.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:22.180]  So I think, you know, going back to like
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:24.580]  keeping the head glued on here,
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.980]  that yeah, there's definitely a very delicate
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:31.660]  and important balance of C to N in our soil systems
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.860]  based on the plant that we are trying to grow.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.060]  So there's my two cents.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.160]  Yeah, but I think too, the important thing to remember
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.920]  is like when you're stimulating biology to grow
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.640]  and reproduce that biology needs all the carbon,
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.680]  nitrogen, magnesium, iron,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.840]  it needs all that for its own bodies too.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.440]  So that in turn is like why,
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.120]  I think it's Dr. Alene always calls them
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.280]  nutrient sacks or whatever.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.440]  So the bacteria are basically gathering these nutrients
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.400]  in their own bodies and they're, you know,
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.240]  as that colony grows and then the higher level predators
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.120]  are called the nutrient spreaders or whatever,
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.760]  because those come through popping
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.680]  all the little nutrient sacks
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.280]  and releasing everything for themselves
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.280]  and for the plant, you know.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.640]  Unless she's changed the language,
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.640]  she used to refer to the bacteria as having a pantry
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:34.200]  and in its pantry, it stores all these different nutrients
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.640]  so that it can have functions like changing the pH
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.120]  within its body, you know,
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.160]  providing the necessary things to buy.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.600]  And then she calls the protozoa as the nutrient cyclers
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.680]  because they're basically, they eat that bacteria
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.920]  and they either steal the N or the C,
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.920]  depending on what they're looking for.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.840]  And by default, that pantry is then released
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:00.920]  into solution in the rhizosphere
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.160]  where it is now being absorbed or can be taken up by the plant
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.240]  So just, I don't know if she's changed that language,
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.960]  but that's the way she used to describe it
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.960]  as the bacteria has the pantry and the nutrient cycler.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.720]  So that would be your protozoa,
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.680]  your flagellates and amoeba,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.640]  as well as ciliates actually do this too.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.240]  Ciliates are, you know, in the soil food web world,
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.200]  ciliates are viewed as very negative.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.440]  But if you're in a dark system,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.600]  those ciliates do an amazing job
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.440]  of starting to break up that compaction
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.880]  and they can survive in that low oxygen environment
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:48.400]  in the goal of turning it back into soil.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.080]  That's a great place to start.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.400]  I mean, more often than not,
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.400]  I will use a low oxygen extract for the first application.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.200]  And then I go into a highly oxygenated,
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.200]  so eight parts per million plus compost extract
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.960]  for the second application.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.000]  And I see amazing results in two applications
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.200]  with a food in the middle.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.400]  And that food in the middle is a liquid carbon source.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.480]  So some kind of, you know,
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.760]  I do definitely use a simple sugars.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.760]  So a molasses along with humic acid and then kelp.
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.960]  And so by providing that food in the middle,
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.280]  I've helped transition from a oxygen tolerant
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.000]  or anaerobic, I would call them facultative anaerobic
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  into a more, you know, high level of,
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.160]  oxygen where the positive protozoa or not positive,
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.960]  can't call them positive.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  Just there, that's where you're gonna get
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.680]  a higher level of nutrients cycling
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.320]  because you have multiple species
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.160]  that are consuming those bacteria
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.920]  and releasing them plant available.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.760]  Dr. Lainey-Hamm was the first one where at least the,
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.680]  sorry, I hit my mic there,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.920]  was the first person that was explaining to me
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.000]  that when we were first getting into these teas,
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.840]  everybody wanted to throw everything under the sun
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.360]  into these teas, let them brew for three days
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.600]  or something ridiculous, five days and all this stuff,
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.040]  adding unsulfured blackstrap molasses,
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.560]  really getting those sugar.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.280]  And she was the first one to really point out,
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.120]  okay, you've added all of these things.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.840]  The goal was supposedly diversity.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.640]  And now you've basically created something that
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.040]  for the most part has created just the alphas to emerge.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.160]  So you spent all this time, this energy, this money,
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.760]  and you're kind of just shooting yourself in the foot.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.760]  I wanted to see what you guys, your thoughts on that.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.880]  So I did a shit ton of work with teas
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.720]  when I was down at Rodeo.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.120]  I tried every recipe.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.440]  I used her recipes.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.040]  I found that you would have a constant decrease
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.920]  of organisms the more different things that you added.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:10.240]  So fish hydrolysis knocked back things really bad.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.960]  Kelp had some issues.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.360]  It definitely knocked stuff back.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.360]  And pretty much at the end of the day,
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.720]  if I'm going to make a tea,
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.360]  the only thing that I'm gonna use
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.400]  is blackstrap molasses at the appropriate levels
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.160]  because that's the other thing.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.400]  If you use too much,
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:35.400]  I suggest one teaspoon per 20 gallons of water
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.400]  and never let it brew over 30 hours
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.440]  because what happens is you've grown out that bacteria
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.680]  and you've reduced the protozoa,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.200]  but eventually that bacteria is gonna outgrow the protozoa
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.400]  to a point where now it's gonna crash and go anaerobic.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:55.040]  So again, I did a shit ton of work over 18 months
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.400]  on trying to figure out what the best recipe was.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.360]  And at the end of the day,
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.480]  one ounce to 20 gallons of molasses,
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.720]  brew for 30 hours,
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.200]  and you will see an incredible variety
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.120]  of both bacteria and protozoa,
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.620]  the highest level you can get.
[01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:17.090]  Smiley, do you want to throw anything on teas
[01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:21.490]  or from any insight from kind of studying,
[01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:22.810]  making compost teas?
[01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:25.810]  Man, I ran through the gambit of them,
[01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:27.850]  but I really have just gone away
[01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:32.210]  from making any kind of actively aerated compost tea.
[01:42:32.210 --> 01:42:34.690]  So where you're bubbling it like that,
[01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:37.490]  I don't have anything against it.
[01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:40.410]  I don't really, I just, I don't know.
[01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:42.290]  It got to be kind of a chore.
[01:42:43.130 --> 01:42:47.770]  And if I needed to apply something I found as good,
[01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:50.930]  if not a better benefit to just doing,
[01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:54.530]  getting a really biocomplete, so to speak,
[01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:57.050]  but getting a really great compost source.
[01:42:57.050 --> 01:43:01.290]  And that was the major key to having a successful tea
[01:43:01.290 --> 01:43:03.450]  was the source of the compost.
[01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.730]  Cause that's your biology
[01:43:05.730 --> 01:43:07.810]  that you're putting into the system to grow out,
[01:43:07.810 --> 01:43:09.730]  so to speak, and you're actively aerated.
[01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:12.450]  But when you're just rinsing that biology
[01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:15.890]  and applying it to the soil, it's a fast, easy thing.
[01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:18.850]  I mean, I can do my whole garden in a couple hours,
[01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:19.690]  you know what I mean?
[01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:22.810]  And get it accomplished versus trying to bubble them.
[01:43:22.810 --> 01:43:25.530]  But I don't know, that's just mine.
[01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:28.010]  I, and I've even gone a little bit away
[01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:30.850]  from even doing that because I apply, you know,
[01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:35.850]  an inch layer of vermicompost at, you know, transplant.
[01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:39.410]  And then I have a blue moth soaker hose
[01:43:40.090 --> 01:43:41.650]  that waters through that all the time too.
[01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:45.050]  So it's kind of, I've kind of left it to that now,
[01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:47.730]  but yeah, it's more just an apply for,
[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:50.170]  the way I'm doing things is more something I would only do
[01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:53.490]  if I'm noticing an issue in nutrient cycling.
[01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:58.990]  Brandon, do you have anything on teas?
[01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:01.030]  Did you ever mess around with those or anything?
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:04.190]  I used to do teas, but I don't do teas anymore.
[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:07.350]  They're kind of, I just have,
[01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:09.590]  I have just a simpler system, you know?
[01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:14.150]  When I want to water in biology,
[01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:19.150]  I use the Micro Plus, which is some lactobacillus.
[01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:25.030]  It's got a couple of different strains of bacillus,
[01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:27.070]  like Bacillus subtilis.
[01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:33.310]  It has right up Pseudomonas and Saccharomyces in it.
[01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:36.910]  Just, it works great.
[01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:41.310]  And then I also use the Trichoderma bacillus subtilis.
[01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:46.310]  I also use BT, Bacillus thuringiensis.
[01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:53.190]  And I also use Boovaria bacillana.
[01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:59.890]  Do you mind kind of diving deeper a little bit
[01:44:59.890 --> 01:45:02.770]  on just why you're using that?
[01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:04.010]  Sure, yeah.
[01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:09.010]  So what I've also found is really, really interesting.
[01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:13.250]  And it seems to be, have a positive effect.
[01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:18.250]  I'm gonna have, I'm gonna do some actual like experiments
[01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:21.050]  and have it all written down and all this,
[01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:24.210]  because I wasn't sure if it was gonna work,
[01:45:24.210 --> 01:45:29.210]  but using a protein hydrolysate,
[01:45:29.690 --> 01:45:34.690]  soy amino acid, mixing that in with the microbe spores
[01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:40.090]  when I inoculate a system helps increase efficacy.
[01:45:43.410 --> 01:45:47.050]  And so I tried it out with the Trichoderma.
[01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:52.050]  And the reason I use Trichoderma is my soils are adequate
[01:45:52.570 --> 01:45:53.810]  in phosphorus already.
[01:45:55.250 --> 01:46:00.250]  And I don't inoculate with a root colonizing microbe
[01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:03.650]  like mycorrhizae.
[01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:10.170]  And the reason I don't is because I like what Trichoderma
[01:46:10.170 --> 01:46:15.170]  as a species has to offer because it's not endophatic,
[01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:20.890]  but it will create an association around the root system.
[01:46:20.890 --> 01:46:25.890]  And it helps with the uptake of iron,
[01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:28.130]  like we spoke about before,
[01:46:28.130 --> 01:46:30.130]  because Trichoderma produces,
[01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:35.410]  it has like the highest affinity for iron of any microbe.
[01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:41.610]  And so what's able to do is outcompete other organisms
[01:46:42.330 --> 01:46:44.930]  simply because it takes all of the resource.
[01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:50.810]  And so it can outcompete pathogens that are in the soil.
[01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:57.490]  And the Bacillus subtilis will make a functional relationship
[01:46:58.690 --> 01:47:00.570]  with the Trichoderma.
[01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:03.010]  So they work well together as a consortium.
[01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:05.970]  One is a bacteria, one's a fungus.
[01:47:06.810 --> 01:47:09.750]  And the Trichoderma also,
[01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:15.570]  it has kind of a plant signaling response.
[01:47:16.410 --> 01:47:18.690]  One of its metabolites that it produces
[01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:23.690]  triggers an immune response in plants.
[01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:26.650]  So it's one of the ways that you can also trigger
[01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:31.610]  that immune responses by using certain types of microbiology.
[01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:34.490]  But mainly I use it for,
[01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:40.470]  in this instance, I used it at transplant.
[01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:44.450]  Usually when someone would use like a mycorrhizae
[01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:46.610]  to help promote the root growth
[01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:49.810]  or try to protect that root from things
[01:47:49.810 --> 01:47:53.210]  like maybe overwatering when a plant is really young,
[01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:55.970]  I opt for something like the Trichoderma
[01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.930]  with the amino acids.
[01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:02.370]  And the reason I do that, or the reason I tried that,
[01:48:02.370 --> 01:48:05.450]  because this is the first time I've done that combination.
[01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:09.670]  I have, however, done the Trichoderma for years now,
[01:48:11.290 --> 01:48:16.290]  is because I wanna see, I was using smaller cups
[01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:22.130]  and I wanted to see how it would work.
[01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:25.690]  But it's just a bioprotection.
[01:48:25.690 --> 01:48:29.090]  You wanna make sure these things don't dampen off
[01:48:29.090 --> 01:48:34.090]  from overwatering in some anaerobic microorganism,
[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:40.330]  infect the plant and kill it off.
[01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:42.970]  So that's what the Trichoderma is for.
[01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:46.050]  The Boveria bossiana is an endopathogenic fungi
[01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:50.190]  and that has parasitic,
[01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:56.130]  properties for a lot of different arthropod species,
[01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:57.590]  including aphids.
[01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:02.970]  And so it's used as an inoculant in soil.
[01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:06.090]  It's found throughout the world in soils.
[01:49:06.090 --> 01:49:11.090]  I just use pretty large quantities of it
[01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:14.170]  in just a pure spore form.
[01:49:14.170 --> 01:49:16.770]  And I watered in to the system.
[01:49:16.770 --> 01:49:20.670]  So I'll keep it in water, it'll get watered in.
[01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:22.310]  My Rezi, it'll sit for a little bit.
[01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:27.310]  Well, it's, you know, the spores are hydrophobic
[01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:32.630]  so they have to rehydrate, become active.
[01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:38.510]  And then I water them in and I use that as a bioprotectant
[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:41.930]  for my integrated pest management, you know, SOPs.
[01:49:43.230 --> 01:49:45.710]  Same with the Bacillus thuringiensis
[01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:50.710]  and those are different ones of fungus,
[01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:53.910]  ones of bacteria.
[01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:57.970]  So you can use those in conjunction.
[01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:00.970]  Usually I'm not drenching with the Bacillus thuringiensis.
[01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:06.870]  Usually that's used as a foiler application.
[01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:09.710]  And usually I only use it in the outdoors
[01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:13.190]  and it's to help protect things like those cutworms,
[01:50:13.190 --> 01:50:15.230]  the little caterpillars that chew through your weed,
[01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:16.630]  mold the shit out.
[01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:22.270]  So those are some of the applications for those
[01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:24.510]  and why I use those specifically.
[01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:26.830]  I talked a little bit about the Micro Plus,
[01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:30.610]  also known in like a lot of science papers,
[01:50:30.610 --> 01:50:34.590]  it's known as effective microorganisms or EM1.
[01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:38.110]  It's a very similar consortium.
[01:50:38.110 --> 01:50:43.110]  It has this, you know, the same properties
[01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:45.310]  as far as the metabolites
[01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:47.110]  that are produced by those microbes.
[01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:53.210]  You know, it's really trying to promote certain things
[01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:56.750]  at certain times and use certain things
[01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:01.750]  for a certain purpose that I focus on for the microbe
[01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:05.110]  portion as opposed to just like,
[01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:08.950]  oh, I'm gonna just add everything that I can all at once.
[01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:11.710]  You know, I was like, they don't all play well together
[01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:14.710]  and they're all competing for a lot of the same resources.
[01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:19.710]  And so kind of taking the approach of, you know,
[01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:25.730]  having a general inoculant that helps
[01:51:25.730 --> 01:51:29.010]  with nutrient cycling out competing pathogens
[01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:32.330]  and then having something that works synergistically
[01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:37.070]  with that in the other microbes that you're gonna be using
[01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:38.850]  if you're gonna be putting them in the system.
[01:51:38.850 --> 01:51:40.750]  That's, you know, that's kind of what I did.
[01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:42.990]  Those are the things that I use.
[01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:46.910]  That's what's cool about the Soil Food Web
[01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:48.670]  is for the most part, everything does work
[01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:51.310]  in a symbiotic synergistic manner.
[01:51:54.150 --> 01:51:56.710]  Can I jump in for a second?
[01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:57.850]  Absolutely.
[01:51:57.850 --> 01:52:00.230]  We got a special guest.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:05.460]  How's it going?
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:06.280]  What's up brother?
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.140]  Hey, are you okay?
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:12.700]  How you doing man?
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.460]  Peter always throw the curve ball.
[01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:17.580]  Different.
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:19.540]  So should we talk more about fulvics and?
[01:52:28.770 --> 01:52:31.970]  Okay, I just get a phone call from my wife.
[01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:32.810]  Anyway.
[01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:36.610]  Yeah, so what are you guys doing there?
[01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:38.930]  Talking about?
[01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:40.510]  We're talking about kind of the differences
[01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:43.090]  in synthetics and organics salts,
[01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:46.070]  kind of letting individuals kind of rant
[01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.210]  on a variety of different things.
[01:52:48.210 --> 01:52:51.370]  We kind of harped on humic acids and fulvic acids.
[01:52:51.370 --> 01:52:54.090]  So maybe we could talk about that for a moment
[01:52:54.090 --> 01:52:56.970]  and then see where that conversation goes.
[01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:57.810]  Sure.
[01:52:58.730 --> 01:52:59.570]  You bet.
[01:53:04.570 --> 01:53:06.210]  So one thing I was gonna touch on,
[01:53:06.210 --> 01:53:09.970]  Brandon, when you were saying like humics and fulvics,
[01:53:09.970 --> 01:53:11.370]  they're acids and they're lower,
[01:53:11.370 --> 01:53:14.650]  but I've heard Dr. Faust talk about that before
[01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:16.850]  where one is an alkaline extraction
[01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:18.450]  and one is an acid extraction.
[01:53:18.450 --> 01:53:20.610]  Maybe that would be a good spot, sir.
[01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:27.370]  Yeah, people are always kind of confused about humic acid
[01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:31.410]  because it's with an S, humic acids with an S.
[01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:36.810]  So it's really kind of primitive on that level
[01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:39.410]  because it was something they came up with
[01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:40.970]  over a hundred years ago.
[01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:43.270]  We know a lot more since then,
[01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:46.430]  but it's just defined as fractions.
[01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:50.710]  And the fulvic acid, which is the real bioactive part
[01:53:50.710 --> 01:53:55.050]  that does stuff with plants is acid soluble.
[01:53:56.370 --> 01:53:59.830]  And the humic acid is not acid soluble.
[01:53:59.830 --> 01:54:02.870]  It's only alkaline soluble.
[01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:06.630]  So if you put an, if you take a,
[01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:11.630]  make an extract, an alkaline extract with humic acid,
[01:54:11.630 --> 01:54:13.350]  you know, the black stuff,
[01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:15.390]  for one thing, black isn't humic acid.
[01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:17.750]  In the spectrum of humic acids,
[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:20.230]  it goes from gray to brown.
[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:25.230]  Black is like tar, coal, hydrocarbons,
[01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:27.310]  all that kind of stuff.
[01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:31.470]  Because a lot of the humate products are made with lignite
[01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:33.870]  or oxidized coal or lignite.
[01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:38.790]  So there's tar and wax and sulfur
[01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:41.510]  and stuff that you'd find in coal and oil.
[01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:42.390]  Okay.
[01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:43.910]  So that's no good.
[01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:45.590]  That doesn't do you any good at all.
[01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:49.110]  That's not the good stuff.
[01:54:49.110 --> 01:54:51.030]  The good stuff is the acid soluble.
[01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:54.310]  And it's gonna be acid.
[01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:59.310]  If somebody says they have fulvic acid and the pH is 10,
[01:54:59.430 --> 01:55:01.230]  no, no.
[01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:04.550]  Fulvic acid has a pH, our fulvic acid has a pH
[01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:06.690]  about 3.5 to 3.8.
[01:55:07.690 --> 01:55:10.810]  And then it's also fulvic means in Latin,
[01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:13.450]  it means brass or gold color.
[01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:17.690]  So if somebody says they have fulvic acid
[01:55:17.690 --> 01:55:21.130]  and it's any other color, well, good luck.
[01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:24.050]  Because it's defined by color.
[01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:27.950]  Fulvicus means gold or brass color.
[01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:31.730]  So fulvic acid is gonna have acid pH
[01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:35.730]  and it's gonna be brass and gold color, period.
[01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:36.970]  Okay.
[01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:40.490]  So then you have products like the full humic that we have.
[01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:43.330]  And that's a combination of all the humic substances,
[01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:48.890]  which is humic, fulvic, olvic, olmic.
[01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:51.710]  And there's five different fulvic acid fractions.
[01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:57.090]  So they consider that this humic science
[01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:59.290]  is the most complex chemistry on earth.
[01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:03.310]  So it's not a simple thing.
[01:56:04.150 --> 01:56:07.550]  When I started, we had no idea how it really worked,
[01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:09.390]  just guessing, you know.
[01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:14.170]  Now we've got all kinds of new techniques and methods,
[01:56:14.170 --> 01:56:16.750]  but we still go back to plant bioassay,
[01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:18.790]  where you actually take plants,
[01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:20.630]  usually corn, maybe tomatoes,
[01:56:20.630 --> 01:56:23.430]  maybe in my case, maybe it's hemp.
[01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:28.790]  And we do a series of tests where we soak the seeds
[01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:32.550]  and the different extracts and we grow a plant
[01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:35.110]  and we see which plants grow better,
[01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:37.450]  which have better root expression.
[01:56:37.450 --> 01:56:39.870]  And of course, if it really is fulvic acid,
[01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:42.790]  like our full power, it'll be dramatic.
[01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:44.770]  You got a lot of fine root development.
[01:56:45.710 --> 01:56:50.510]  Really the functional groups that make the fulvic acid work
[01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:55.510]  are associated with producing fine root systems.
[01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:57.190]  And you can see the difference
[01:56:57.190 --> 01:57:00.510]  when you dig the plant up, the bioassay,
[01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:05.270]  and you compare treated and untreated, it becomes obvious.
[01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:06.710]  Okay.
[01:57:06.710 --> 01:57:10.350]  So that's about the only thing that can do that.
[01:57:11.710 --> 01:57:13.750]  Yeah, I've often, you know,
[01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:16.950]  I tell people all the time that the carboxylic acid
[01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:21.950]  groupings are able to hold on to the inorganic minerals
[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:25.910]  in a bioavailable form that can be,
[01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:28.150]  and that can be used as a transport catalyst
[01:57:28.190 --> 01:57:32.470]  to move these things around for the plant.
[01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:35.270]  Yeah, it's very good.
[01:57:36.110 --> 01:57:39.110]  Yeah, see, there's a lot more awareness, but that's true.
[01:57:39.110 --> 01:57:40.790]  Matter of fact, the scientists now,
[01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:43.670]  a lot of the chemists involved with this all over the world,
[01:57:43.670 --> 01:57:46.550]  think we ought to just eliminate the name humic acid
[01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:49.330]  and call it phenyl carboxylic acids.
[01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:53.030]  Phenyl carboxylic acids.
[01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:55.510]  Well, since we're talking about weird names,
[01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:59.670]  why can't you call the product fulvic in California
[01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:01.870]  or whatever, whatever the silly,
[01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:05.830]  like why does it matter with the terminology and the verbiage
[01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:07.550]  Well, I thought it would matter,
[01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:09.350]  but it didn't as it turned out.
[01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:13.630]  They kind of made exception for us
[01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:17.310]  and they allowed us to sell it in California
[01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:21.630]  as long as we label it with the minimum detectable level
[01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:22.650]  of humic acid.
[01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:25.410]  And we even got in trouble for that.
[01:58:25.410 --> 01:58:27.970]  You know, they go, well, you registered just for humic acid,
[01:58:27.970 --> 01:58:29.330]  there isn't any in there.
[01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:32.250]  And they say, yeah, you guys told us we could do that.
[01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:33.090]  Remember?
[01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:35.970]  Oh yeah, okay.
[01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:41.690]  No, it's because in Oregon here, Oregon accepted AFCO.
[01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:44.690]  AFCO is the American Association
[01:58:44.690 --> 01:58:47.250]  of Feed and Fertilizer Officials.
[01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:50.650]  And they're the ones that kind of write the rules
[01:58:50.650 --> 01:58:53.570]  on fertilizers and how they'll be tested
[01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:56.170]  and what claims and blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:58.370]  See, and then the states can accept that.
[01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:59.850]  Some states have to.
[01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:02.690]  California, you know, I mean,
[01:59:02.690 --> 01:59:04.370]  they have their own EPA and everything.
[01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:09.370]  I mean, so California would not accept AFCO for fulvic acid
[01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:14.510]  because their lab isn't set up to do it.
[01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:18.430]  And they just thought, well, that's too much of a problem.
[01:59:18.430 --> 01:59:20.250]  Everybody's got to change their labels
[01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:21.810]  and blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:24.530]  It just had all these lame excuses, you know,
[01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:27.130]  like, well, we're not set up for that.
[01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:30.170]  Now, what they are set up for in California
[01:59:30.170 --> 01:59:32.810]  for their testing is for humic acids.
[01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:34.610]  And when they test our product,
[01:59:34.610 --> 01:59:37.650]  they use a technique that's not even appropriate.
[01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:40.330]  It gives us quite an advantage.
[01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:44.410]  In other words, it reads high in humic.
[01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:48.850]  But so yeah, there's no uniform standard
[01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:51.930]  that's been accepted by all the states.
[01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:54.450]  Now in Canada, it's not like that.
[01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:58.150]  Canada is one country, one registration.
[01:59:58.150 --> 02:00:00.610]  Yeah, it's fulvic in Canada.
[02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:04.110]  And we use the approved test method
[02:00:04.110 --> 02:00:05.810]  that was same one we use in Oregon,
[02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:08.370]  which is the only approved test method
[02:00:08.370 --> 02:00:12.250]  in the scientific world and in the regulatory world.
[02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:16.870]  So you have five or six test methods.
[02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:19.150]  And that's always been a problem.
[02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:21.630]  And so we tried, it took years for us
[02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:25.750]  to get this test method approved.
[02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:29.110]  And now there's only a couple of states that go for it.
[02:00:29.110 --> 02:00:32.430]  Oregon's one, I think we have the only label too,
[02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:35.490]  because there's a lot of phony fulvic acid
[02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:40.490]  that's made with lignosulfonates, even barley malt extract.
[02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:45.790]  And then they try, because that'll test as fulvic acid,
[02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:47.590]  even though it isn't.
[02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:51.030]  So in Oregon, they make you test for sulfur too,
[02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:55.370]  and other elements, so they can eliminate fraud.
[02:00:56.430 --> 02:01:00.270]  Because there's a lot of fraud in this world.
[02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:04.070]  But our products, that's our niche.
[02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:07.150]  You know, it's reality is our niche,
[02:01:07.150 --> 02:01:11.390]  or we try to get to the truth of whatever it is
[02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:12.510]  and fight the battle.
[02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:18.510]  So yeah, so there is the complex answer, you know,
[02:01:20.150 --> 02:01:21.510]  about California.
[02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:24.670]  But we sell the hell out of it in California.
[02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:26.430]  Matter of fact, our major distributor,
[02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:29.310]  which is Hydro Farm is in California.
[02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:33.710]  So it's, the product speaks for itself.
[02:01:33.710 --> 02:01:36.790]  And a lot of people understand the problem with the labeling.
[02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:40.950]  You know, so it's bad because we have to,
[02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:43.710]  we're making the product
[02:01:43.710 --> 02:01:45.430]  and we had to put different labels on it
[02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:46.550]  and get everything straight,
[02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:49.630]  what state it's gonna go to,
[02:01:49.630 --> 02:01:53.390]  which label they're gonna accept, you know.
[02:01:54.510 --> 02:01:57.630]  And of course I developed all this stuff in Hawaii
[02:01:57.630 --> 02:01:58.630]  and sold it in Hawaii,
[02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:00.430]  because Hawaii doesn't even have fertilizer
[02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:01.590]  registration law.
[02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:07.770]  So you're on your own, you know, do what you want.
[02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:13.610]  But here, Oregon, strict, but our product passes.
[02:02:13.690 --> 02:02:16.970]  I mean, we have our own lab for quality control.
[02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:19.770]  We have the equipment to test for fulvic acid
[02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:22.290]  by the approved test method,
[02:02:22.290 --> 02:02:27.290]  the human product trade association, IHS method.
[02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:31.090]  Okay, we do, the state of Oregon doesn't.
[02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:34.050]  They have to send it out, you know.
[02:02:35.050 --> 02:02:39.970]  But so we maintain, we have a full-time lab guy
[02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:42.090]  to maintain the quality control.
[02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:46.250]  So you can expect, you know, the same results,
[02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:48.930]  the same amount every time, you know.
[02:02:49.930 --> 02:02:54.930]  And California even came up here, believe it or not.
[02:02:56.530 --> 02:02:58.570]  California sent a man to Oregon,
[02:02:59.770 --> 02:03:01.250]  California Department of Food and Ag
[02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:02.790]  to inspect our facility.
[02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:09.290]  You know, and that's mainly for the organic certification.
[02:03:09.690 --> 02:03:14.690]  So we're also certified organic in California, in OMRI.
[02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:18.290]  And so we're the only fulvic that does that.
[02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:20.850]  And California sent their own people.
[02:03:20.850 --> 02:03:23.550]  We've never even been inspected by somebody in Oregon.
[02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:29.330]  But California sends a guy, so we passed.
[02:03:30.690 --> 02:03:33.530]  So that's it, you know, it's confusing.
[02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:35.490]  It's been confusing.
[02:03:38.370 --> 02:03:41.090]  You know, there's so much variation.
[02:03:43.650 --> 02:03:46.170]  I could go into intense detail
[02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:49.330]  because now we know there's new test methods
[02:03:49.330 --> 02:03:50.410]  and then bioassays.
[02:03:50.410 --> 02:03:53.290]  We know kind of what compounds are doing what
[02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:56.950]  in fulvic acid in the functional groups.
[02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:59.650]  You know, like you mentioned,
[02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:03.490]  carboxylic and phenolics and quinones.
[02:04:03.490 --> 02:04:06.450]  And so you're talking in humic acid,
[02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:09.250]  they figure there's at least 800 different
[02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:13.570]  specific chemical compounds, organic chemicals.
[02:04:15.650 --> 02:04:17.610]  They don't know what they are by name.
[02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.570]  Dr. Faust, on this show,
[02:04:19.570 --> 02:04:21.770]  we've talked to a variety of people
[02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:25.290]  that are for foiler feeding, against foiler feeding.
[02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:26.250]  And since I have you here,
[02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:29.570]  I was hoping that you could maybe talk on a deeper level
[02:04:30.450 --> 02:04:33.370]  when someone is spraying a fulvic acid
[02:04:33.370 --> 02:04:36.170]  onto the cannabis plant, what is going on
[02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:40.090]  and how quickly are things kind of starting to move
[02:04:40.090 --> 02:04:41.310]  once that is applied?
[02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:45.410]  Yeah, well, in the case of the fulvic,
[02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:49.090]  it's rapidly absorbed by cells,
[02:04:49.090 --> 02:04:50.430]  whether it's your own body.
[02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:52.090]  I mean, people use it,
[02:04:52.090 --> 02:04:54.910]  we sell it to a cosmetic company in California.
[02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:58.330]  And the women are spraying it on their face.
[02:04:58.330 --> 02:05:02.090]  It makes your face, it renews your cells.
[02:05:02.090 --> 02:05:04.330]  So it's absorbed by cells.
[02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:07.410]  It doesn't matter whether it's human cells or plant cells.
[02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:11.890]  So it's very rapidly absorbed by a leaf, leaf surface.
[02:05:11.890 --> 02:05:13.370]  If it doesn't run off, I mean,
[02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:15.810]  there's some kinds of plants it's gonna run off.
[02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:16.730]  Cannabis, no.
[02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:19.890]  Cannabis leaf, it stays on there pretty good.
[02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:21.870]  It doesn't really roll off,
[02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:23.690]  but you have to spray up to the point
[02:05:23.690 --> 02:05:25.730]  before it starts rolling off.
[02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:27.010]  Okay.
[02:05:27.010 --> 02:05:30.090]  But the plant will absorb it in a matter of minutes.
[02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:33.970]  And because it's a low molecular weight,
[02:05:33.970 --> 02:05:38.090]  so it can get through the cell wall, cell membrane.
[02:05:39.650 --> 02:05:40.590]  That's the key.
[02:05:41.450 --> 02:05:45.650]  If it's a high molecular weight, if it's black or brown,
[02:05:45.650 --> 02:05:49.470]  that connotes a higher molecular weight, see?
[02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:54.090]  So you go from brown or black to like almost clear.
[02:05:54.170 --> 02:05:58.090]  And it's the almost clear to yellow golden stuff
[02:05:58.090 --> 02:05:59.570]  that's got low molecular weight
[02:05:59.570 --> 02:06:02.090]  and can get through the cell membrane.
[02:06:02.090 --> 02:06:03.530]  The rest of it, no.
[02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:07.370]  No, I mean, now if you use our full humic,
[02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:09.850]  it has, it's brown or black.
[02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:14.490]  And it's got a high fulvic content.
[02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:17.850]  And so the plant will absorb the fulvic from it,
[02:06:17.850 --> 02:06:19.850]  but the humic is gonna stay on the leaf.
[02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.370]  It will not be absorbed.
[02:06:23.370 --> 02:06:25.370]  It will oxidize.
[02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:27.730]  But the interesting thing about it is
[02:06:27.730 --> 02:06:30.650]  on crops that get fungal diseases,
[02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:35.650]  like tomatoes get leaf spot or blight or lots of things.
[02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:39.890]  The humic acid that stays on the leaf
[02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:42.890]  can attach to viral particles and fungal spores
[02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:45.910]  and deactivate them.
[02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:49.810]  So it prevents infection of leaf,
[02:06:50.410 --> 02:06:54.290]  fungi, spores or viruses.
[02:06:56.570 --> 02:07:00.070]  So there's a protective effect there if you need it.
[02:07:03.450 --> 02:07:04.290]  In front of this-
[02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:05.730]  There have been people that have talked about that
[02:07:05.730 --> 02:07:07.370]  with the Dutch.
[02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:09.370]  I'm sorry, sorry if you had another point.
[02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:10.210]  No, go ahead.
[02:07:11.050 --> 02:07:12.610]  Well, just with powdery mildew,
[02:07:12.610 --> 02:07:13.690]  does it, is that,
[02:07:13.690 --> 02:07:15.570]  cause people have always wondered if that was true.
[02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:17.370]  And there's a lot of people out there that say yes.
[02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:18.570]  There's a lot of people that say no.
[02:07:18.570 --> 02:07:19.410]  So it was just,
[02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:21.770]  the audience would love to know if that's
[02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:24.050]  also true with powdery mildew.
[02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:26.610]  Oh yeah, powdery mildew.
[02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:28.690]  Yeah, that's a big one on just about all crops.
[02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:30.050]  I mean, I work with grapes.
[02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:34.250]  I work with tree crops, all kinds of food crops.
[02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:37.730]  Powdery mildew is wow, really a problem.
[02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:40.810]  I mean, especially here in the grape vineyard country.
[02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:42.050]  You know, they're out there spraying
[02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:44.250]  every couple of times a week.
[02:07:44.250 --> 02:07:45.250]  But guess what?
[02:07:46.650 --> 02:07:48.050]  We figured that one out.
[02:07:49.410 --> 02:07:54.090]  The main reason these plants are so susceptible
[02:07:54.090 --> 02:07:58.250]  to powdery mildew is because they're so deficient
[02:07:58.250 --> 02:08:02.490]  in not just humic acids, but silicic acids,
[02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:06.490]  or the soluble available form of silica,
[02:08:06.490 --> 02:08:09.530]  the form of silicic or monosilicic acid.
[02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:13.010]  Okay, so once you spray a plant with a humic
[02:08:13.010 --> 02:08:17.210]  and or the full, either one, let's say full power,
[02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:24.570]  full combined with a silica, the right form of silica,
[02:08:24.850 --> 02:08:27.290]  you're not gonna have any powdery mildew, period.
[02:08:28.610 --> 02:08:30.530]  I mean, I work, I mean, we had, I don't know,
[02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:31.890]  I get how many acres.
[02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:33.490]  I don't know whether you saw my presentation
[02:08:33.490 --> 02:08:35.410]  on the hemp research we did.
[02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:36.930]  It was like 30 acre field.
[02:08:36.930 --> 02:08:38.850]  It was like huge field.
[02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:43.250]  But we developed a product called BioAg Super Sil
[02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:45.010]  or Bio Super Sil.
[02:08:45.010 --> 02:08:47.690]  So what it is, it's a combination of humic substances
[02:08:47.690 --> 02:08:52.690]  like fulvic acid and a nano sized,
[02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:58.370]  the real thing, not a hype, silica.
[02:08:58.370 --> 02:09:02.070]  Okay, so when you have a nano sized silica particle,
[02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:07.690]  the plant, it's absorbed directly by the plant roots
[02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:09.810]  or through the leaf.
[02:09:09.810 --> 02:09:12.250]  And then when it's helped, it's transported
[02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:13.690]  by the fulvic acid,
[02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:17.530]  aids in penetration of the cell membrane.
[02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:21.330]  So if you use, we also have monosilicic acid.
[02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:23.930]  If you use monosilicic acid, for instance,
[02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:27.410]  in hydroponics, pretty quick, it just ties up.
[02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:31.050]  It just, if you put too much in, you'll see it turn white.
[02:09:31.050 --> 02:09:32.610]  So it's reactive.
[02:09:32.610 --> 02:09:33.970]  It's very, very reactive.
[02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:36.330]  It's got a high pH, it's reactive.
[02:09:36.330 --> 02:09:41.330]  So you put a monosilicic acid in a nutrient solution,
[02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:44.410]  it ties up like with phosphate and calcium,
[02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.630]  you know, it's that reactive.
[02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:48.510]  Okay, so then forget it, you know,
[02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:50.690]  it's not gonna make it into the plant.
[02:09:50.690 --> 02:09:53.030]  But our new product, BioAg SuperSil,
[02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:56.070]  and we did a lot of research on hemp,
[02:09:56.070 --> 02:10:01.070]  on cannabis, on grapes, in hydro, it does not tie up.
[02:10:04.130 --> 02:10:05.470]  It is not reactive.
[02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:08.990]  The plant processes it.
[02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:12.350]  It's a nano size, it's down to angstroms.
[02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:14.670]  And the only way you can determine if it really is,
[02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:16.070]  is that's just bullshit hype,
[02:10:16.510 --> 02:10:17.950]  which is a lot of these products,
[02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:21.310]  is it's put under an electron microscope.
[02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:24.230]  Yeah, okay, is it really micron size?
[02:10:24.230 --> 02:10:25.910]  Well, yeah.
[02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:28.790]  So, you know, so we get this nano,
[02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:31.310]  so this is a breakthrough in the whole thing,
[02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:33.830]  because the yield limiting factor
[02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:38.750]  and what causes disease is two things,
[02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:43.630]  or what we call decline, is activated human compounds
[02:10:43.630 --> 02:10:46.150]  and monosilicic acid.
[02:10:46.150 --> 02:10:48.870]  They're the two big limiting factors.
[02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:52.430]  If you break through that, you know,
[02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:55.630]  then the genetic potential of the plant can be realized.
[02:10:55.630 --> 02:10:58.070]  And disease is not gonna be a problem.
[02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:00.870]  And you can tell because it makes the leaf
[02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:04.290]  of whatever plant, cannabis or whatever,
[02:11:04.290 --> 02:11:07.390]  kind of shiny, kind of a shine, see.
[02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:09.310]  And that's the silica.
[02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:13.030]  It forms something that's the same mineral as opal.
[02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:16.790]  And it's like a armored thing.
[02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:18.950]  And then on top of that, the fulvic acid,
[02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:23.710]  our fulvic acid, full power, has been tested in Germany
[02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:27.430]  in Humboldt University in Berlin.
[02:11:27.430 --> 02:11:28.630]  And they're hydroponic,
[02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:32.030]  it's one of the biggest universities
[02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:33.790]  for hydroponics in the world.
[02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:35.110]  They have their own big greenhouse,
[02:11:35.110 --> 02:11:37.030]  it's hydroponic research.
[02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:38.590]  They're really, really into it.
[02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:40.550]  So they tested our product.
[02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:44.670]  And they did molecular genetics on our product, okay?
[02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:49.130]  So it turns out that the fulvic acid, our product,
[02:11:49.130 --> 02:11:54.130]  activates a pathway in the cells, the MAP2-5 pathway.
[02:11:56.710 --> 02:11:59.610]  And that particular pathway is activated
[02:11:59.610 --> 02:12:04.550]  by a minute amount of compound that's in the fulvic acid.
[02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:08.090]  One of the canons, okay?
[02:12:09.090 --> 02:12:11.130]  And there's hundreds of them, okay.
[02:12:11.130 --> 02:12:15.290]  So that activates a pathway that the plant and people
[02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:18.970]  and animals turns on resistance to pathogens.
[02:12:18.970 --> 02:12:21.090]  It's like flipping a switch.
[02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:24.330]  Oh, here's a minute amount of this compound,
[02:12:24.330 --> 02:12:27.290]  this organic carbon compound.
[02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:28.890]  It flips a switch.
[02:12:28.890 --> 02:12:31.490]  Now the plant is on defensive
[02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:36.490]  and it starts to produce substances that are repellent,
[02:12:36.810 --> 02:12:38.770]  that are antiviral,
[02:12:40.810 --> 02:12:43.870]  and they also produce plant growth regulators.
[02:12:45.210 --> 02:12:47.530]  All they're doing is turning on the switch
[02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:49.250]  and the plant does the rest.
[02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:51.330]  The cells do the rest, really.
[02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:53.650]  And I knew nothing about this.
[02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:55.010]  This is all new to me.
[02:12:55.930 --> 02:12:57.970]  10 years ago, 15 years ago.
[02:12:59.050 --> 02:13:01.970]  Because it's new, it's new science.
[02:13:01.970 --> 02:13:04.610]  So we always said, well, how do these things work?
[02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.890]  You know, some plants don't get a disease,
[02:13:07.890 --> 02:13:10.050]  other plants get a disease.
[02:13:10.050 --> 02:13:11.090]  Like what's going on?
[02:13:11.090 --> 02:13:13.590]  Well, it's in the molecular genetics.
[02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:17.870]  There's pathways, the plants can defend themselves.
[02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:22.250]  Obviously, cannabis has defended itself
[02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:26.810]  for hundreds of thousands of years without our help, okay?
[02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:31.610]  So you just have to give plants or animals what they need
[02:13:31.610 --> 02:13:33.350]  and they have it, it's built in.
[02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:39.170]  But when you're dealing with hydroponics or modern farming,
[02:13:39.170 --> 02:13:40.810]  these compounds aren't present.
[02:13:40.810 --> 02:13:42.370]  They've already leached out of the soil
[02:13:42.370 --> 02:13:43.570]  because they're soluble.
[02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:49.250]  And organic matter and humus oxidizes, it goes away.
[02:13:49.250 --> 02:13:51.850]  It gets washed down the river, okay?
[02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:56.170]  So everything is susceptible to disease
[02:13:56.170 --> 02:13:59.530]  because the defensive compounds
[02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:03.730]  that you find in a good soil are no longer there.
[02:14:03.730 --> 02:14:05.930]  So now it's crop rescue.
[02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:07.650]  So now we've got to spray and pray.
[02:14:07.650 --> 02:14:09.770]  So it's, oh, I gotta spray sulfur,
[02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:13.130]  stop, oh no, that's not working.
[02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:15.730]  We gotta use a systemic fungicide,
[02:14:15.730 --> 02:14:17.270]  we gotta use insecticide.
[02:14:18.170 --> 02:14:22.210]  So it's crop rescue, crop rescue.
[02:14:22.210 --> 02:14:24.370]  So our product, Bio Supercil,
[02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:26.090]  and I'm not really trying to give it a pitch,
[02:14:26.090 --> 02:14:28.050]  but I mean, I think it's a breakthrough
[02:14:29.290 --> 02:14:32.010]  because you have the two main limiting factors
[02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:35.770]  that we know for sure.
[02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:37.570]  And then we have the components
[02:14:37.570 --> 02:14:41.690]  that do activate the genetic pathways
[02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:43.930]  that provide resistance to plants.
[02:14:43.930 --> 02:14:48.770]  And then we have a silica form that will be absorbed
[02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:51.130]  and will not be reactive, will not tie up,
[02:14:51.130 --> 02:14:55.370]  and the plant processes it into the form of silica it needs.
[02:14:56.570 --> 02:14:57.410]  That simple.
[02:14:58.170 --> 02:15:02.050]  You know, I mean, it's not that simple,
[02:15:02.050 --> 02:15:06.650]  but there's the answer to powdery mildew.
[02:15:06.650 --> 02:15:09.450]  And so we've had some of my neighbors
[02:15:09.450 --> 02:15:10.770]  that have grape vineyards,
[02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:14.570]  and we use those for experimenting.
[02:15:14.570 --> 02:15:18.010]  We actually have our own grape deal too.
[02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:20.890]  We have our own greenhouse and outside grow
[02:15:20.890 --> 02:15:22.930]  for cannabis and hemp.
[02:15:22.930 --> 02:15:26.290]  And we work with large scale hemp growers
[02:15:26.290 --> 02:15:27.890]  where we set up test plots.
[02:15:29.530 --> 02:15:31.290]  We do all kinds of research.
[02:15:32.770 --> 02:15:34.730]  So that's what we found.
[02:15:34.730 --> 02:15:37.410]  Now, we also found out with cannabis
[02:15:37.410 --> 02:15:41.810]  that you can manipulate the THC and the CBD levels
[02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:44.370]  by how you use humic substances.
[02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:50.050]  In other words, the full power, full humic,
[02:15:50.050 --> 02:15:51.730]  these are humic substances.
[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:57.290]  They, the big number one thing that they do
[02:15:57.290 --> 02:16:02.290]  or they claim to do is their stress reduction compounds.
[02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:05.170]  Okay, so you reduce abiotic stress.
[02:16:05.170 --> 02:16:07.930]  They found that out in research too in Germany.
[02:16:08.850 --> 02:16:11.730]  Try to grow in Northern Europe in the winter
[02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:14.770]  in a greenhouse, yeah, a lot of stress.
[02:16:14.770 --> 02:16:18.290]  So the full decreases stress of the plant.
[02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:23.290]  So it can handle like a suboptimum nutrient blend.
[02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:27.970]  It can handle like cold or hot better.
[02:16:27.970 --> 02:16:32.650]  It can handle other stresses in the environment.
[02:16:34.050 --> 02:16:35.930]  Okay, that's great.
[02:16:36.930 --> 02:16:41.930]  Except cannabis, if you're growing it for THC,
[02:16:42.450 --> 02:16:47.450]  cannabinoids, what makes the THC work?
[02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:53.170]  I mean, the plant pump THC, right?
[02:16:53.170 --> 02:16:58.170]  Is stress because it's about a stress hormone
[02:16:59.970 --> 02:17:04.130]  that the plant produces called abscisic acid.
[02:17:04.130 --> 02:17:09.130]  And so that's related to the plant's defensive mechanism
[02:17:10.130 --> 02:17:14.290]  that makes it produce THC.
[02:17:15.210 --> 02:17:19.210]  So if you're growing hemp, like a lot of guys here,
[02:17:19.210 --> 02:17:22.370]  if they are over like 0.3 THC,
[02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:24.690]  then they had to destroy their crop.
[02:17:24.690 --> 02:17:28.970]  So they don't want THC, okay?
[02:17:28.970 --> 02:17:30.890]  They want CBD.
[02:17:30.890 --> 02:17:32.010]  So what do you do?
[02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:34.290]  Okay, so if you want THC,
[02:17:34.290 --> 02:17:37.850]  you stop the fulvic acid treatment.
[02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:42.210]  You know, at the beginning of flowering
[02:17:42.210 --> 02:17:46.490]  and you spray with a kelp-based product
[02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:48.970]  like our CytoPlus, for instance,
[02:17:48.970 --> 02:17:51.570]  it has kelp and trace elements.
[02:17:51.570 --> 02:17:55.130]  And that switches the energy from the male energy
[02:17:55.130 --> 02:17:57.170]  to the female energy.
[02:17:57.170 --> 02:18:00.170]  And then the flowering occurs.
[02:18:00.170 --> 02:18:01.890]  And then at the very end, you know,
[02:18:01.890 --> 02:18:03.610]  you start reducing the water
[02:18:04.890 --> 02:18:06.890]  because it doesn't need much water
[02:18:06.890 --> 02:18:09.370]  towards the end of flowering,
[02:18:09.370 --> 02:18:11.770]  the bud ripening doesn't need much water.
[02:18:13.210 --> 02:18:15.450]  And I even, in this last year,
[02:18:15.450 --> 02:18:18.250]  I even put it under increasing stress
[02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:20.690]  by using LED lights, you know,
[02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:23.530]  in an outside scenario, you know,
[02:18:23.530 --> 02:18:25.890]  in a covered outside greenhouse
[02:18:27.010 --> 02:18:30.930]  to try to duplicate Hawaii, Columbia, Panama, you know,
[02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:34.250]  Jamaica, which I'm convinced, I don't care.
[02:18:34.290 --> 02:18:37.210]  Nobody grows cannabis here in Oregon
[02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:40.130]  as good as what you're gonna get in Jamaica, you know,
[02:18:41.010 --> 02:18:42.330]  or Columbia or Hawaii.
[02:18:43.090 --> 02:18:46.650]  It's just because you don't have the stress from the sun,
[02:18:46.650 --> 02:18:48.050]  the intense UV.
[02:18:49.010 --> 02:18:52.410]  So if you want THC, it's stress.
[02:18:52.410 --> 02:18:55.970]  So you stop using the full power
[02:18:55.970 --> 02:18:58.490]  or anything that relieves stress,
[02:18:58.490 --> 02:19:03.490]  any stuff that will reduce stress, you wanna stop.
[02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:06.770]  You want stress, but you wanna keep the plant going,
[02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:08.210]  but you don't wanna like,
[02:19:08.210 --> 02:19:10.650]  and people say, well, it's starting to yellow
[02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:12.050]  at the bottom and drop.
[02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:13.410]  Yeah, good.
[02:19:13.410 --> 02:19:15.690]  Yeah, I wanna see that.
[02:19:15.690 --> 02:19:18.410]  I wanna see those bottom leaves turn yellow and drop off
[02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:20.730]  because that's some cystic acid doing that.
[02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:24.850]  I don't wanna keep the plant green and growing
[02:19:26.570 --> 02:19:27.850]  at the end of the season.
[02:19:27.850 --> 02:19:30.810]  I don't wanna see it turn yellow, drop the leaves.
[02:19:30.810 --> 02:19:32.890]  I want those buds to fill.
[02:19:33.850 --> 02:19:34.970]  That's what I'm after.
[02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:39.650]  Okay, so if you're after hemp, well, go for it.
[02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:40.970]  Just keep her going.
[02:19:42.770 --> 02:19:44.330]  Keep the stress off of it.
[02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:47.650]  If you wanna keep the THC down, you want high CBD.
[02:19:48.690 --> 02:19:52.050]  So you continue with the treatments,
[02:19:52.050 --> 02:19:55.690]  the anti-stress, let's say, from the fulvic.
[02:19:56.610 --> 02:19:59.690]  And then that'll keep the THC level down
[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:04.690]  so you can pass their criteria, which is ridiculous,
[02:20:05.290 --> 02:20:07.010]  but that's what it is.
[02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:10.530]  So yeah, that took us a couple of years
[02:20:10.530 --> 02:20:13.170]  of large field trials to come up with that.
[02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:18.490]  And they'd already done this kind of work in Israel
[02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:19.690]  and came up with that,
[02:20:19.690 --> 02:20:23.250]  but nobody ever did a large field scenario.
[02:20:23.250 --> 02:20:25.650]  Well, we did it here in Oregon.
[02:20:25.690 --> 02:20:30.650]  And I have a video on that to do a presentation.
[02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:34.530]  Matter of fact, I gave a presentation on that whole thing
[02:20:34.530 --> 02:20:37.250]  to the International Humic Substance Society
[02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:38.890]  meeting this year.
[02:20:38.890 --> 02:20:39.850]  So I have that.
[02:20:39.850 --> 02:20:43.210]  It's like a YouTube or a PowerPoint or something.
[02:20:44.290 --> 02:20:47.290]  So that's important to remember when you're foliar spraying.
[02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:52.850]  But early in the growing season,
[02:20:52.850 --> 02:20:55.010]  yeah, you wanna use the fulvic.
[02:20:55.050 --> 02:20:56.930]  And if you're gonna use a nutrient,
[02:20:59.530 --> 02:21:02.570]  I mean, you really need to know if you need that nutrient.
[02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:03.730]  That's the other part.
[02:21:05.050 --> 02:21:07.570]  I like to use amino acids.
[02:21:07.570 --> 02:21:12.570]  We have a new amino acid product, nitrogen amino,
[02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:14.930]  and it's amazing.
[02:21:16.330 --> 02:21:19.090]  I mean, we used to use things like urea in a foliar.
[02:21:19.090 --> 02:21:21.730]  We'd see the plant kind of get a little pale,
[02:21:21.730 --> 02:21:22.650]  needs nitrogen.
[02:21:22.690 --> 02:21:25.210]  We test the leaf, low in nitrogen.
[02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:29.410]  Some cannabis requires a lot more nitrogen
[02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:31.810]  like Blue Dream, Quantum Kush.
[02:21:32.810 --> 02:21:35.810]  These specific ones need higher nitrogen.
[02:21:35.810 --> 02:21:38.010]  I mean, there's variation between the strains
[02:21:38.010 --> 02:21:39.570]  of what nutrients they need.
[02:21:41.090 --> 02:21:45.410]  So if you know, then you would,
[02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:49.010]  back in the day, use urea because that's the only form,
[02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:50.570]  that's the only way you can get nitrogen
[02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:52.290]  in the plant in a foliar.
[02:21:53.250 --> 02:21:57.250]  Okay, so now we're using an amino acid product
[02:21:57.250 --> 02:22:02.250]  that we have, nitro amino, combined with full power,
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:07.490]  fulvic, my God, it turns it around overnight.
[02:22:08.250 --> 02:22:11.050]  I mean, not only does it provide the nitrogen,
[02:22:11.050 --> 02:22:14.250]  but other stuff that we don't know about.
[02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:16.770]  I mean, the growth stimulating effect
[02:22:16.770 --> 02:22:19.450]  of these amino acids, for instance.
[02:22:19.450 --> 02:22:22.370]  So that is incredibly effective as a foliar.
[02:22:23.370 --> 02:22:24.850]  Especially if you need nitrogen,
[02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:27.370]  is the nitro amino with full power.
[02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:30.890]  But most of the things people spray on plants
[02:22:30.890 --> 02:22:32.770]  aren't gonna be absorbed.
[02:22:32.770 --> 02:22:34.210]  You know, they're gonna like burn.
[02:22:34.210 --> 02:22:36.090]  Oh, people say that to us,
[02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:37.450]  oh, will your product burn?
[02:22:37.450 --> 02:22:38.890]  You know, like, will the full power burn?
[02:22:38.890 --> 02:22:40.370]  No, it will not burn.
[02:22:41.410 --> 02:22:43.370]  That's not even an appropriate term.
[02:22:45.930 --> 02:22:47.490]  No, it's not a salt.
[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:49.730]  Salt is what burns.
[02:22:49.730 --> 02:22:52.090]  So that's like NPK.
[02:22:52.090 --> 02:22:54.810]  And, you know, for instance, phosphate
[02:22:54.810 --> 02:22:56.730]  is not easily absorbed by the leaf.
[02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:01.170]  Potash, yeah, a little bit, but yeah.
[02:23:01.170 --> 02:23:03.450]  I mean, foliar spraying is great,
[02:23:03.450 --> 02:23:05.170]  but you gotta know what you're doing.
[02:23:05.170 --> 02:23:08.210]  I mean, it's not a shotgun approach.
[02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:13.210]  But our products are made to work for a reason.
[02:23:14.370 --> 02:23:16.330]  And the new product, totally new.
[02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:18.970]  I mean, it's just, I think we're gonna introduce it.
[02:23:19.810 --> 02:23:23.410]  This year, this spring is the nitro amino
[02:23:23.410 --> 02:23:25.730]  and the other aminos we have.
[02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:30.730]  And, you know, so use that in combination with the fulvic.
[02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:35.450]  And then we have our bio-ag super seal,
[02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:40.250]  which is the full spectrum humics
[02:23:40.250 --> 02:23:45.250]  and nano silica dynamite, I'll tell you.
[02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:50.690]  And I've been growing this crop for over 50 years.
[02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:55.090]  So, you know, we finally, you know,
[02:23:55.090 --> 02:23:56.730]  made the kind of some of the breakthroughs,
[02:23:56.730 --> 02:23:58.690]  but a lot of people back to the other thing.
[02:23:58.690 --> 02:24:00.730]  I mean, a lot of people call me and contact me,
[02:24:00.730 --> 02:24:03.330]  says, since we've been using your product,
[02:24:03.330 --> 02:24:04.530]  we don't have any insect.
[02:24:04.530 --> 02:24:06.850]  We don't have any fungal problems.
[02:24:06.850 --> 02:24:08.490]  We don't have any powdery mildew.
[02:24:09.890 --> 02:24:11.050]  We don't have anything.
[02:24:12.090 --> 02:24:14.770]  And of course we see the same thing on our farm.
[02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:20.010]  We grow a lot of stuff, vegetables, same thing.
[02:24:21.490 --> 02:24:23.890]  And you realize people have been growing crops
[02:24:23.890 --> 02:24:26.490]  and hemp and cannabis for 10,000 years,
[02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:28.170]  probably more than that.
[02:24:28.170 --> 02:24:33.170]  I'm pretty sure more like 50,000 or even more.
[02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:36.970]  They didn't have any pesticides or fertilizers
[02:24:36.970 --> 02:24:38.050]  or anything like that.
[02:24:38.050 --> 02:24:42.450]  I mean, how did things work before we had industrial
[02:24:42.450 --> 02:24:45.610]  farming and petrochemicals and all that?
[02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:49.090]  Well, obviously it worked or we wouldn't be here.
[02:24:50.290 --> 02:24:52.570]  I mean, that was back when they used humus,
[02:24:52.570 --> 02:24:56.810]  compost, manure, leaves, like the Hawaiians,
[02:24:56.810 --> 02:24:59.530]  they just use leaves that they tromp into the mud
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:02.250]  and let them turn into humic substances
[02:25:02.250 --> 02:25:03.530]  and release the silica.
[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:09.810]  So all's we're doing is trying to give back what was lost.
[02:25:12.890 --> 02:25:17.890]  And hydroponics is, it's nothing but the Liebig theory.
[02:25:18.890 --> 02:25:23.730]  I mean, Liebig back in 1915 or whenever it was,
[02:25:23.730 --> 02:25:26.570]  German chemist, he proved that,
[02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:29.170]  oh, you don't need organic matter, you don't need humus.
[02:25:29.170 --> 02:25:31.770]  See, I can grow a plant in a hydroponic,
[02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:34.290]  just NPK solution.
[02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:37.850]  And so forget all that rest, forget organic,
[02:25:37.850 --> 02:25:39.410]  it's all you need.
[02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:41.970]  And of course that sold because they had a big push
[02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:44.170]  behind it, the chemical companies.
[02:25:45.330 --> 02:25:49.730]  And then it just opened up the market for pesticides.
[02:25:50.850 --> 02:25:54.490]  So back in the day, that's what happened.
[02:25:54.490 --> 02:25:59.210]  There was a split between biodynamic or organic
[02:25:59.210 --> 02:26:02.050]  or just plain agriculture
[02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:06.530]  and what we have industrial chemical agriculture
[02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:08.050]  and rescue chemistry.
[02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:14.050]  So keep in mind, the plant knows how to protect itself
[02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:15.850]  if you give it what it needs.
[02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:22.650]  So, yeah, I mean, we just don't generally see a problem
[02:26:22.810 --> 02:26:24.850]  if we use the right program,
[02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:29.370]  which is something that people have been saying for ages.
[02:26:29.370 --> 02:26:32.610]  Well, a healthy plant, it can resist everything.
[02:26:32.610 --> 02:26:35.050]  Okay, but how do you define that?
[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:36.850]  I mean, how do you get there?
[02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:40.690]  Okay, on the healthy plant, what does the plant really need?
[02:26:40.690 --> 02:26:42.330]  Okay, well, now we know.
[02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:45.410]  It needs stuff we didn't even know about
[02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:49.690]  to activate genetic pathways.
[02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:51.170]  What's a genetic path?
[02:26:51.170 --> 02:26:55.210]  When I went to college, there was no molecular genetics.
[02:26:55.210 --> 02:26:56.930]  We didn't know shit at that point.
[02:26:56.930 --> 02:27:00.810]  You know, it was like, so, you know,
[02:27:00.810 --> 02:27:04.210]  the advancement in science, and I'm telling you,
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:09.850]  the cannabis industry is kind of ahead of the curve
[02:27:09.850 --> 02:27:13.370]  in terms of a lot of this compared to regular agriculture.
[02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:17.530]  So that's why I specialize in the cannabis side
[02:27:17.530 --> 02:27:21.650]  because I'm fed up with industrial agriculture.
[02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:23.210]  You know, trying to talk to these people,
[02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:27.050]  you might as well go talk to a Holstein cow, you know,
[02:27:27.050 --> 02:27:32.050]  because they're just so brainwashed.
[02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:36.010]  So, you know, we're trying to move ahead.
[02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:38.930]  So anyway.
[02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:43.330]  That was a great rant.
[02:27:43.330 --> 02:27:44.170]  Thank you for that.
[02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:45.770]  That was beautiful.
[02:27:45.770 --> 02:27:47.130]  It's explaining a lot.
[02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:50.130]  We had a question come in from Peter's side.
[02:27:50.130 --> 02:27:54.470]  What pH does that foiler of full power and MSA have to be?
[02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:59.210]  Well, to best absorption of a foliar,
[02:27:59.210 --> 02:28:02.130]  you want to be on a little bit on the acid side,
[02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:03.610]  you know, like for, matter of fact,
[02:28:03.610 --> 02:28:06.610]  a lot of times they use an acidifying agent
[02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:11.610]  in agricultural, you know, spraying a buffer.
[02:28:11.730 --> 02:28:14.690]  So yeah, you want to be somewhat on the acidic side,
[02:28:14.690 --> 02:28:17.450]  you know, because if you're using water
[02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:19.570]  that's highly alkaline,
[02:28:19.570 --> 02:28:23.250]  well, that means it's got calcium or sodium or magnesium,
[02:28:23.250 --> 02:28:25.290]  and that tends to tie stuff up.
[02:28:25.290 --> 02:28:26.610]  It's not going to be absorbed.
[02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:29.650]  It's going to, it's not right.
[02:28:29.650 --> 02:28:31.330]  Now we prefer rainwater.
[02:28:31.330 --> 02:28:33.650]  Matter of fact, we make our full power
[02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:35.370]  is made with rainwater,
[02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:38.510]  though we don't fool around with the water.
[02:28:39.730 --> 02:28:40.850]  We use rainwater.
[02:28:41.650 --> 02:28:46.650]  And so unless you have good water or rainwater,
[02:28:46.770 --> 02:28:48.250]  you know, a lot of this well water
[02:28:48.250 --> 02:28:53.010]  or California water and stuff is very hard water.
[02:28:53.010 --> 02:28:55.370]  And so that messes everything up.
[02:28:56.250 --> 02:28:59.050]  So yeah, you want to keep your pH like between,
[02:28:59.050 --> 02:29:04.050]  you know, 5.5 or even between six and four
[02:29:04.330 --> 02:29:08.410]  in that range, three to four, you know,
[02:29:08.410 --> 02:29:10.690]  but not much above six.
[02:29:11.650 --> 02:29:14.090]  Really, I mean, if you could keep it
[02:29:14.090 --> 02:29:15.890]  offered to about five.
[02:29:15.890 --> 02:29:18.050]  Yeah, I used to sell a really nice foliar spray
[02:29:18.050 --> 02:29:22.330]  that was buffered, came buffered with citric acid.
[02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:28.250]  So yeah, so you'd end up putting in your water,
[02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:30.250]  which is usually it's well watered,
[02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:32.210]  usually high pH.
[02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:34.330]  And so that would buffer it down.
[02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:36.430]  So you can use a little citric acid.
[02:29:38.010 --> 02:29:42.330]  That's organic approved to buffer your pH.
[02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:46.650]  That's something people forget about.
[02:29:46.650 --> 02:29:49.370]  And yeah, the water is important
[02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:53.530]  since plants are 85% water.
[02:29:53.530 --> 02:29:55.650]  And we're like something like that too,
[02:29:55.650 --> 02:29:57.810]  you know, the 80s, I don't know.
[02:29:57.810 --> 02:30:02.570]  So, you know, living forms of life are about water.
[02:30:02.570 --> 02:30:03.650]  They're mostly water.
[02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:07.810]  So the water is crucial.
[02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:12.330]  That's why we use purified rainwater.
[02:30:12.330 --> 02:30:14.290]  It comes off the Gulf of Alaska
[02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:18.510]  and these storms we get out here in the winter.
[02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:20.110]  So it's a virgin water.
[02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:22.430]  It hasn't come through an industrial area.
[02:30:22.430 --> 02:30:25.490]  It's, I don't know if you've ever been up to Alaska
[02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:27.870]  and Ketchikan and there,
[02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:32.870]  but it's just clouds and mist and rain.
[02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:38.150]  And it's like the most humid kind of cloudy environment.
[02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:41.790]  And then big chunks of ice are falling off these glaciers.
[02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:42.630]  I've been there.
[02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:45.350]  I've seen where my water comes from.
[02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:49.010]  And then it gets delivered down here.
[02:30:50.170 --> 02:30:51.870]  And that's what you use.
[02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:54.390]  So water isn't so important.
[02:30:54.390 --> 02:30:55.750]  And that's a rant in itself.
[02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:59.250]  Okay, I don't wanna go into the whole water thing,
[02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:01.490]  but I could.
[02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:04.910]  So it's crucial.
[02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:09.590]  He goes back to Victor Schellenberger
[02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:13.750]  and some of that scientists
[02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:16.070]  that the state of water,
[02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:18.150]  like water different states,
[02:31:20.110 --> 02:31:22.350]  it's more physics than it is biology.
[02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:29.150]  But yeah, so I can answer your questions about water.
[02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:34.310]  So have you done any actual plant testing
[02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:40.750]  on what kind of cannabinoids are being expressed
[02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:43.790]  versus synthetic in your products?
[02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:45.490]  Please talk on that.
[02:31:45.490 --> 02:31:48.990]  That's always been a point of contention
[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:52.030]  that I think that this living soil industry
[02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:54.470]  or group is all about,
[02:31:54.470 --> 02:31:57.070]  hey, this is gonna give you a greater variety
[02:31:57.070 --> 02:32:01.350]  of expressions of miners, higher terpene content, et cetera.
[02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:04.850]  Synthetic, but we've never had anybody
[02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:05.910]  that's actually done that.
[02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:07.030]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:08.790]  Oh yeah, no.
[02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:12.030]  No, we've done a lot of,
[02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:16.710]  we have equipment that we can do basic CBDs,
[02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:19.710]  CBD, A, B, whatever it is.
[02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:24.710]  There's a bunch of CBDs, THC, several.
[02:32:24.910 --> 02:32:27.090]  Okay, so we can do basic testing,
[02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:30.010]  but to really get deep into it,
[02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:34.470]  which I think the Israelis have in some of their papers.
[02:32:34.470 --> 02:32:35.510]  I mean, it's expensive,
[02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:38.330]  very expensive research to do all that.
[02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:44.630]  But just in short, we can manipulate the CBD in it.
[02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:46.350]  But yeah, okay.
[02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:48.870]  But you're talking about the whole,
[02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:51.630]  all the different components.
[02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:54.990]  Well, it's just like coffee, I'll tell you.
[02:32:54.990 --> 02:32:57.310]  Because I worked in the coffee industry in Kona.
[02:32:57.310 --> 02:32:59.110]  Matter of fact, I had a coffee farm.
[02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:01.830]  There's a two big crops in Kona
[02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:05.670]  was Pacololo and coffee.
[02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:11.550]  But I helped people win the coffee cupping contests,
[02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:17.070]  cannabis cups, okay.
[02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:21.950]  And these were newcomers and all the locals thought,
[02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:22.910]  oh, yeah, right.
[02:33:22.910 --> 02:33:24.730]  You know, you know, can do.
[02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:30.230]  We've been doing for 50 years.
[02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:31.790]  You know, someone highly come in,
[02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:33.550]  they know how to grow coffee.
[02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:36.670]  But anyway, my client won.
[02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:39.390]  It's like a blind tasting test.
[02:33:39.390 --> 02:33:41.510]  Okay, that's all your flavonoids.
[02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:44.630]  That's all these quality components.
[02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:46.150]  It's the same in cannabis.
[02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:49.830]  You know, the plant has to synthesize all these,
[02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:51.490]  it has to get it from somewhere.
[02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:57.510]  You know, and it gets it from the soil and the air.
[02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:59.790]  Okay, so we're finding out, okay.
[02:33:59.790 --> 02:34:00.830]  Here's what we're finding out.
[02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:02.270]  This is really cutting edge.
[02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:05.150]  That there are compounds,
[02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:09.350]  there are volatile organic compounds
[02:34:09.350 --> 02:34:12.150]  that are produced by soil fungi in the soil.
[02:34:13.390 --> 02:34:18.390]  And these volatile organic compounds exude from the soil.
[02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:24.350]  They're taken up by the plant, leaf and root, okay.
[02:34:24.350 --> 02:34:27.070]  Those what we call VOCs,
[02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:30.870]  it's really complex chemistry, okay.
[02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:31.950]  Really complex.
[02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:36.550]  We're not even sure like what we're looking at
[02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:40.590]  in terms of actually chemistry, like what's doing it.
[02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:42.990]  Well, because it's so goddamn complex.
[02:34:42.990 --> 02:34:46.350]  You have fungi, all kinds, hundreds,
[02:34:46.350 --> 02:34:49.070]  bacteria all working together in the soil,
[02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:52.390]  breaking down different kinds of organic matter
[02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:54.070]  under different conditions.
[02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:58.390]  And then they produce, we didn't even know this,
[02:34:58.390 --> 02:35:01.510]  but all these fungi and all these things
[02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:02.870]  working on organic matter,
[02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:05.630]  they're producing humic substances, okay.
[02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:11.230]  Well, it turns out also mycorrhizal fungi
[02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:13.950]  that live on the root and other organisms
[02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:18.950]  that live in the root zone are producing humic substances.
[02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:22.630]  Matter of fact, mycorrhizal fungi produces humic acid
[02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:24.510]  in the roots of the plant.
[02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:28.950]  If you inoculate the plant with the humic,
[02:35:28.990 --> 02:35:31.910]  with the VAM, it's our product called VAM,
[02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:36.910]  which is eight mycorrhizal fungi in a humic acid base, right.
[02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:41.110]  But it turns out that these fungi,
[02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:42.950]  if you have a healthy root system
[02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:45.670]  and the fungi are living there, VAM,
[02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:48.150]  they produce humic substances, but more.
[02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:49.590]  And there's other organisms
[02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:52.270]  that produce these volatile organic compounds
[02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:57.230]  that are taken up by the roots and the leaves of the plant.
[02:35:57.270 --> 02:36:02.070]  Okay, so that's super complex chemistry.
[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:05.910]  Okay, so the plant utilizes compounds,
[02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:07.990]  these unnamed compounds
[02:36:10.190 --> 02:36:15.190]  from a very complex ecosystem in the soil
[02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:20.230]  to produce its own chemistry.
[02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:24.230]  Okay, the microbes in the soil, especially the fungi
[02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:26.590]  are the world's cheapest chemists.
[02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:28.950]  They're producing chemistry all the time.
[02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:31.670]  They just need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
[02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:35.990]  and they're producing enzymes and growth stimulants
[02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:40.070]  and signaling compounds, the volatile organics.
[02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:43.950]  So the fungi send up volatile organic compounds,
[02:36:43.950 --> 02:36:46.150]  the plant absorbs them.
[02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:48.870]  It uses some of those compounds
[02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:51.710]  to produce what it wants to do.
[02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:55.310]  It wants to have a nice smell to attract bees, let's say.
[02:36:55.310 --> 02:36:59.950]  It wants to produce protective compounds, whatever.
[02:37:01.470 --> 02:37:03.110]  Who knows the reasons,
[02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:07.710]  but generally the reason is survival for everything.
[02:37:07.710 --> 02:37:10.350]  And so if you don't provide all that stuff,
[02:37:10.350 --> 02:37:14.830]  so we found out a lot of this stuff just by chance,
[02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:18.790]  let's say, which is how a lot of good inventions are made,
[02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:24.730]  that just by anecdotally, so activating the soil.
[02:37:24.730 --> 02:37:26.890]  So use the soluble humic acids,
[02:37:26.890 --> 02:37:31.890]  like full power, full humic, compost, vermicompost,
[02:37:32.250 --> 02:37:33.850]  things like that.
[02:37:33.850 --> 02:37:37.650]  So you're providing these raw materials
[02:37:37.650 --> 02:37:41.850]  for these chemists in the soil, these fungi,
[02:37:41.850 --> 02:37:43.170]  which are always gonna be there.
[02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:45.370]  I mean, you can add them too,
[02:37:45.370 --> 02:37:48.130]  which is a good idea in some cases.
[02:37:48.130 --> 02:37:50.570]  And then they feed the plants.
[02:37:50.570 --> 02:37:52.130]  So it's not like plants are sitting
[02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:54.490]  with their roots hanging in the soil
[02:37:55.250 --> 02:37:58.050]  and there's some NPK and it's taking it up and growing.
[02:37:58.050 --> 02:38:02.410]  Okay, yeah, that kind of works, kind of works,
[02:38:02.410 --> 02:38:05.450]  but it's shit quality, okay?
[02:38:05.450 --> 02:38:09.390]  Whether it's coffee, whether it's cannabis, whatever,
[02:38:09.390 --> 02:38:11.050]  you're talking about low quality.
[02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:16.930]  Doesn't have that smell, doesn't have that shelf life.
[02:38:16.930 --> 02:38:21.930]  It doesn't have the sugars, doesn't have the flavonoids,
[02:38:22.170 --> 02:38:25.670]  the alkaloids, all that stuff.
[02:38:26.930 --> 02:38:30.450]  Needs a complete package.
[02:38:30.450 --> 02:38:32.170]  And we just look at nature.
[02:38:32.170 --> 02:38:33.570]  I mean, back in the bio,
[02:38:33.570 --> 02:38:37.210]  when I was just a biodynamic farmer, an organic farmer,
[02:38:37.210 --> 02:38:40.010]  we didn't know much, but we knew more than most people.
[02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:43.450]  But we knew it would work.
[02:38:44.610 --> 02:38:49.610]  We maybe we didn't have, or maybe we couldn't prove it,
[02:38:49.970 --> 02:38:51.330]  but we knew it would work.
[02:38:53.050 --> 02:38:55.570]  We knew we could produce, for instance,
[02:38:55.570 --> 02:39:00.130]  a better tasting apple or tomato or whatever it was,
[02:39:00.130 --> 02:39:05.130]  or grapes that could win the grape wine tasting contest,
[02:39:05.970 --> 02:39:09.370]  like my neighbor did from using our products,
[02:39:09.370 --> 02:39:11.990]  or the coffee contest, things like that.
[02:39:13.290 --> 02:39:15.650]  So you have to look at the big picture,
[02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:18.330]  and get a living soil.
[02:39:18.330 --> 02:39:22.490]  And we're getting closer to knowing what that takes.
[02:39:22.490 --> 02:39:24.850]  But bottom line, you just go back
[02:39:24.850 --> 02:39:27.490]  to the most primitive method of farming,
[02:39:28.570 --> 02:39:31.330]  which was how the Hawaiians and the Mayans
[02:39:31.330 --> 02:39:33.390]  and people like that farmed.
[02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:36.250]  And we could study how the Hawaiians farmed
[02:39:36.250 --> 02:39:40.650]  because actually naturalists like Captain Cook's voyage
[02:39:40.650 --> 02:39:44.450]  recorded like what they were amazed
[02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:48.010]  how these Hawaiians could produce what they were producing.
[02:39:48.690 --> 02:39:49.570]  They were amazed.
[02:39:49.570 --> 02:39:53.970]  So I went into the study of, okay, how did Hawaiians do it?
[02:39:53.970 --> 02:39:55.130]  They didn't have metal.
[02:39:56.130 --> 02:39:58.530]  They didn't have like tillage animals.
[02:39:58.530 --> 02:40:00.890]  They didn't have like fertilizers.
[02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:05.430]  And they lived 2,400 miles from the closest mainland.
[02:40:06.490 --> 02:40:09.050]  They had no contact with the rest of the world,
[02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:12.730]  but they could produce crops that the English
[02:40:12.730 --> 02:40:14.130]  were blown away by.
[02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:16.450]  I mean, the giant sized potatoes
[02:40:16.450 --> 02:40:19.810]  and the bananas and everything
[02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:23.370]  and other crops that Hawaiians grew, like, wow.
[02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:27.050]  I mean, cut off from the world on a rocky island
[02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:28.610]  that's made from a volcano.
[02:40:29.770 --> 02:40:31.250]  How did they do it?
[02:40:32.450 --> 02:40:33.770]  Okay.
[02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:38.170]  And this is the only tools they had
[02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:39.830]  was like a sharpened stick.
[02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:45.670]  So they didn't know about all this stuff of humic acids
[02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:51.590]  or volatile organics or genetic expression
[02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:54.530]  or plant nutrition, or they didn't know any of that,
[02:40:56.110 --> 02:40:59.310]  but the results they got spoke for themselves.
[02:40:59.310 --> 02:41:04.310]  So taking that knowledge, the basic principles of that
[02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:08.890]  and then trying to understand it, why it worked,
[02:41:10.270 --> 02:41:13.670]  is what I did or do.
[02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:18.150]  And that's how we come up with what we came up with.
[02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:21.830]  I can tell you how Hawaiians farmed,
[02:41:21.830 --> 02:41:25.630]  but you're not gonna be able to do it.
[02:41:28.270 --> 02:41:30.790]  The interesting part of it was the only fertilizer
[02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:32.910]  they used that they were allowed to use,
[02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:36.270]  they weren't allowed to use manure or human waste.
[02:41:36.270 --> 02:41:40.630]  That was a kapu, or like taboo.
[02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:45.390]  Their main fertilizer was leaves.
[02:41:45.390 --> 02:41:48.030]  This leaves that they send kids up these trees
[02:41:48.030 --> 02:41:53.030]  and strip the leaves, hardwood trees, broadleaf,
[02:41:53.270 --> 02:41:57.270]  kukui nut, it's oil, it's also called candle nut,
[02:41:57.270 --> 02:42:02.270]  mango, other broadleaf tree leaves.
[02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:07.790]  And then they'd mash them in the flooded paddocks.
[02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:12.870]  And that's what would happen.
[02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:17.910]  So we can't be doing that.
[02:42:18.910 --> 02:42:20.210]  We can't be doing that.
[02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:24.510]  So yeah, so that's all we're doing.
[02:42:24.510 --> 02:42:27.230]  We're just trying to give the plant what it needs.
[02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:31.310]  And I think we already knew that.
[02:42:32.790 --> 02:42:35.150]  But then you get the chemical industry involved
[02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:38.910]  and the fertilizers and all that, and the misinformation.
[02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:43.910]  It's just self-serving of certain industries,
[02:42:45.590 --> 02:42:48.990]  pushing that idea and we're in trouble because of it.
[02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:56.150]  So what I try to do, and I've been all over the world,
[02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:59.190]  how did people do it before they had all this stuff?
[02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:01.270]  What was going on?
[02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:04.730]  And then how can we learn from that?
[02:43:06.270 --> 02:43:08.150]  And that's what agroecology is.
[02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:14.590]  So how can we grow plants that's as potent
[02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:21.150]  as the maroons and the rastafarians in Jamaica?
[02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:24.950]  That's an interesting one.
[02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.910]  Yeah.
[02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:32.430]  Because that's the same point.
[02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:35.670]  They're growing organic.
[02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:38.070]  They're growing organic.
[02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:43.150]  And they may not understand all this stuff,
[02:43:43.150 --> 02:43:46.050]  but they know what's good ganja.
[02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:50.450]  I mean, that's anecdotal.
[02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:53.550]  But if you go to Jamaica and you talk to these people,
[02:43:53.550 --> 02:43:58.550]  and I have, they say,
[02:43:58.590 --> 02:44:01.150]  what's the best ganja you have?
[02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:03.650]  Oh, goat shit, man, goat shit.
[02:44:05.350 --> 02:44:09.750]  So the really high grade stuff, they just call it goat shit.
[02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:14.870]  Oh yeah, I want goat shit.
[02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:16.430]  Give me that hydroponic.
[02:44:18.430 --> 02:44:21.870]  So to them, goat, sheep, if they had them,
[02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:25.410]  whatever it is, is the best fertilizer, period.
[02:44:28.390 --> 02:44:31.750]  And it is, because it's more balanced
[02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:33.650]  like than cow or chicken.
[02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:40.430]  So just over thousands of years, they learned that,
[02:44:40.430 --> 02:44:44.010]  yeah, that's how you do it.
[02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:50.110]  Didn't you say earlier too,
[02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:53.110]  that the salts make the plants angry is what they said too?
[02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:55.070]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:57.870]  Yeah, it makes the plant mad.
[02:44:59.790 --> 02:45:02.710]  Yeah, all normal, no use of chemical fertilizer.
[02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:04.270]  It makes the plant mad.
[02:45:05.550 --> 02:45:08.270]  And how ironic that we talk about cold manures
[02:45:08.270 --> 02:45:11.310]  and the value of them versus the hot manures.
[02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:16.650]  There's something magical about rabbit, goat, llama,
[02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:19.850]  that's unlike the other animals.
[02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:23.630]  That's right, because you got all that fungi.
[02:45:23.630 --> 02:45:25.670]  Like I did a research project
[02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:28.150]  for the biomass user network years ago.
[02:45:29.630 --> 02:45:33.510]  Okay, we want you to write a book on composting
[02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:36.330]  that the average person can use.
[02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:40.270]  So I did my research on that and came up with,
[02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:42.830]  okay, you can make the best inoculant in the world.
[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:45.910]  You get some goat or sheep manure,
[02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:48.750]  some soil from virgin forest,
[02:45:48.750 --> 02:45:53.330]  some finished compost, and then some molasses.
[02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:57.350]  And you mix them together in a liquid solution.
[02:45:57.350 --> 02:46:02.350]  And then you use that as an inoculant on your compost.
[02:46:02.650 --> 02:46:06.190]  And then what happens is what they call cold composting.
[02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:09.670]  Okay, so you're inoculating
[02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:12.670]  because there's millions of species of fungi
[02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:15.350]  involved in here and you're putting some molasses
[02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:18.190]  and they like that as an energy source.
[02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:23.190]  And you got bacteria and fungi from like the rumen
[02:46:24.270 --> 02:46:28.470]  of a rumenant, which is a goat or sheep or cow.
[02:46:28.470 --> 02:46:32.150]  Then you have the forest, the humic substances
[02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:36.150]  and the fungi, the higher fungi from that forest,
[02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:37.870]  and then rich soil.
[02:46:37.870 --> 02:46:39.830]  And so you're bringing a combination
[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:42.150]  of all these different sources of microbes
[02:46:43.150 --> 02:46:48.150]  into a liquid and letting it, well, ferment, I guess.
[02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:52.630]  And then spraying that on as an inoculant onto your compost.
[02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:55.070]  And then of course you want fungal decomposition.
[02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:57.070]  You want the fungi breaking it down.
[02:46:57.070 --> 02:47:00.630]  You don't necessarily want the heating, the thermophilic,
[02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:03.510]  you know, the conventional composting where it steams
[02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:05.830]  and you turn it and that's what you do
[02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:08.470]  to grow mushrooms though, that technique.
[02:47:09.350 --> 02:47:12.230]  But the cold composting where you just let fungi
[02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:14.430]  take it down, that's how you get humic acid,
[02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:19.990]  humic acids and all the good fungi and bacteria
[02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:21.910]  from that method.
[02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:27.630]  So, yeah.
[02:47:27.630 --> 02:47:29.310]  Again, diversity.
[02:47:29.310 --> 02:47:31.710]  In diversity, there's stability.
[02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:33.950]  And salts, yeah, right.
[02:47:33.950 --> 02:47:37.110]  Cannabis is a humus loving plant.
[02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:41.350]  It's a salt hating plant.
[02:47:44.030 --> 02:47:46.030]  That's it, okay.
[02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:49.910]  And it just is.
[02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:53.430]  I mean, where it grows native, natural,
[02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:57.150]  India and places like that, it's just big acres, acres,
[02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:59.710]  big fields, and they've been there for thousands of years.
[02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:01.590]  You know, nobody ever fertilized it.
[02:48:03.310 --> 02:48:08.310]  They fertilize themselves by the leaves and decomposition.
[02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:13.030]  Stocks, all that lignin, you know, cellulose,
[02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:15.470]  just feeds the soil, feeds the microbes,
[02:48:15.470 --> 02:48:19.030]  then crop comes back every year from seed.
[02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:24.710]  So, that's all you need to know.
[02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:28.310]  Yeah, it's all you need to know.
[02:48:29.350 --> 02:48:32.150]  I mean, I learned, the most I learned about farming
[02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:34.310]  was from people like the Amish
[02:48:34.310 --> 02:48:37.110]  when I was first farming myself
[02:48:37.950 --> 02:48:39.990]  and going to the University of Delaware.
[02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:43.910]  They had eighth grade education.
[02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:46.790]  I learned more about farming from them
[02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:48.070]  than I did the university.
[02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:50.150]  And I went to the College of Agriculture.
[02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:57.510]  And then Hawaiians, Jamaicans, Mayans, yeah.
[02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:03.590]  Yeah, I visited Mayans.
[02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:09.590]  I stayed with Mayans and Belize and also Jamaicans
[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:12.790]  in observing what they're doing.
[02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:15.990]  You know, and these are people with no education whatsoever
[02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:20.990]  other than passed down and what they know from centuries.
[02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:27.030]  And yeah, so you don't need to go to college.
[02:49:27.310 --> 02:49:30.030]  You just need to take a look at nature
[02:49:31.350 --> 02:49:33.150]  and don't try to subvert it.
[02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:34.990]  I mean, that's what's basically going on
[02:49:34.990 --> 02:49:36.190]  with agriculture now.
[02:49:36.190 --> 02:49:37.030]  It'll fail.
[02:49:38.430 --> 02:49:40.830]  You know, I mean, they did research.
[02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:44.030]  They don't want you to know about this research.
[02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:45.790]  So, in all these farming areas,
[02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:48.870]  they've correlated loss of soil.
[02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:53.870]  And you lose a bushel of soil for every bushel of corn.
[02:49:55.230 --> 02:49:57.830]  I mean, they're blowing away, washing away.
[02:49:57.830 --> 02:50:02.830]  Okay, so from every inch of soil you lose,
[02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:06.270]  the yield, you lose the yield potential
[02:50:06.270 --> 02:50:07.470]  that'll never come back.
[02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:11.670]  And more fertilizer doesn't work.
[02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:16.930]  So, it's a one-way street to disaster.
[02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:22.830]  You know, as the soil goes away, yield goes down,
[02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:26.710]  crop rescue is needed, all kinds of problems.
[02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:28.470]  And then the civilization goes away
[02:50:28.470 --> 02:50:30.470]  and it's left in the jungle.
[02:50:30.470 --> 02:50:33.390]  And somebody comes, archeologists come years later,
[02:50:33.390 --> 02:50:35.750]  they're like, wow, look at this city out here in the jungle.
[02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:37.250]  What happened to these people?
[02:50:37.250 --> 02:50:42.250]  You know, well, they started out okay,
[02:50:44.350 --> 02:50:46.790]  but they just got carried away.
[02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:49.510]  Of course, a lot of that is a hierarchical structure
[02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:51.830]  where the royalty taxes people
[02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:54.470]  and they have to try to grow more stuff
[02:50:54.470 --> 02:50:57.110]  and, you know, shorter rotations.
[02:50:58.110 --> 02:51:01.750]  You know, there's reasons behind all these things
[02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:02.590]  that happen.
[02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:07.550]  But I think we know the key
[02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:12.550]  and I think biodynamics knew the key way back, you know.
[02:51:14.190 --> 02:51:16.510]  But people thought it was woo-woo,
[02:51:16.510 --> 02:51:20.630]  you know, it was crazy and stuff, complex, you know,
[02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:23.990]  and it had a certain Germanic aspects to it
[02:51:23.990 --> 02:51:28.990]  that were a little obscure, but it worked.
[02:51:33.350 --> 02:51:37.670]  So think biodynamic or what we do,
[02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:41.390]  which is what we call biological agriculture.
[02:51:41.390 --> 02:51:43.630]  So we're thinking on the biological side
[02:51:43.630 --> 02:51:48.450]  and not the mineral side, chemical side.
[02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:52.120]  So.
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:54.800]  We're getting close to the end here
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:58.560]  and I kind of wanted to open it up for questions to you, sir,
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:00.720]  to Smiley or to Leighton.
[02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:03.760]  I appreciate you coming on here as always
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:07.320]  and a shout out to Peter for always making it a surprise.
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:10.520]  Okay, good, I like surprises too.
[02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:13.000]  Hey, much, great to see you again, brother.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.200]  It's been too long
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:16.160]  and we probably ought to have you back on the show
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:17.920]  and really chop it up on water
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:20.560]  because you make a very valid point
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:23.920]  that we are so much water
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:26.920]  and so is everything that we consume
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:29.720]  and yet we've horribly polluted it.
[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:34.240]  You know, there was a comment about,
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:35.960]  well, how do you get clean water?
[02:52:35.960 --> 02:52:39.040]  And it's like, well, you gotta run it through biology.
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:40.200]  You gotta run it through soil.
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:41.440]  You gotta run it through plants.
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:44.840]  And if you don't have soil or plants,
[02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:46.440]  you're not gonna get good water.
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:50.200]  And unfortunately, that's gonna be a huge problem.
[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:52.600]  Water is the next oil in my mind.
[02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:53.560]  What's up, Peter?
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:57.200]  Uh-oh, what's that?
[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:01.080]  Oh, bio-ag samples.
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:06.080]  Peter says he sends out more bio-ag than you guys do.
[02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:12.160]  No, no, no, I said, outside of the company itself,
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:16.000]  I probably send out more samples than anybody else.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:17.040]  That's good.
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:18.000]  Yeah, because I don't even,
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:19.680]  I'm not around the company anymore.
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:22.800]  I'm doing research out here in the woods.
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:23.640]  But yeah, there you go.
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:25.320]  So he knows more about me.
[02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:26.840]  But somebody asked a question.
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:31.320]  I wanna clarify about humics reduce THC,
[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:34.640]  but do they help with other cannabinoids besides CBD?
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:35.760]  Yes, they do.
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:37.960]  What I'm saying, well, our research,
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.840]  yeah, I probably gave the wrong impression.
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:41.400]  Our actual testing and research
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:45.440]  showed that our product increased THC.
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:51.440]  In other words, if we discontinued the fulvic acid
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:55.440]  in the bud or bloom state,
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:58.680]  I mean, the bud formation stage,
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:05.240]  we would get a higher THC than we would
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:10.280]  if we continued the fulvic or the humic.
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:14.240]  But we still got a higher THC than the control.
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.440]  A whole bunch and we got a way higher yield.
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:22.800]  So it's about juggling yield versus THC, CBD.
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:24.680]  And yeah, all the other cannabinoids
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:26.800]  were off the spectrum.
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:31.480]  I mean, they found CBDG, I think it was or something.
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:34.240]  It's normal, you don't find very high levels.
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.240]  But yeah, I mean, this is all new science.
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:45.240]  And I think, I don't know, that's all I can say.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:51.720]  These are tools and you need to know how to use them
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:58.920]  to make that kind of manipulation to do what you're doing.
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:02.720]  But as far as I'm concerned, it's yeah.
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:07.480]  You can talk to some of our people in the company
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:10.040]  and they can get more into the details of that.
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:12.480]  What when you were talking-
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:14.880]  All I know is it makes good shit, man.
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:15.720]  It's good shit.
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:22.240]  When you were talking to silica stuff,
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:25.520]  can you talk about the difference?
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:30.040]  So there's the bios, the super sil, right?
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:36.920]  And then there's the, hold on, let's hold on one second.
[02:55:37.480 --> 02:55:39.040]  There we go, all right.
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:41.680]  We got the super sil, right?
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:46.680]  We got the ion 14 L and then we have the dry.
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.720]  So what would be kind of the nuanced differences
[02:55:52.720 --> 02:55:54.280]  between all three of these,
[02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:57.880]  which are silicon based products?
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:00.520]  Yeah, okay, well, yeah, okay.
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:03.600]  The ion 14 is my original product.
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:08.640]  That's reacting monosilicic acid with humic acid.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.120]  In other words, so the humic acid is like the elater
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:15.680]  and it's not nano.
[02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:18.840]  Well, I mean, it probably is nano after all that.
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:21.840]  So that you have the liquid,
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:23.360]  you can use that in hydroponics
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:26.200]  or you can water the plants or foliar with it.
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:28.880]  And the ion 14 powder,
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:30.960]  you can make your own liquid out of that,
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.800]  but it's not easy, it takes hot water.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.720]  But generally that's for mixing with other fertilizers
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.280]  or organics and using dry.
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.200]  Like I'm gonna use ion 14 pre-plant on the soil
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:47.800]  because that's gonna help cycle the silica
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:49.760]  and everything else.
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:53.560]  Matter of fact, we use that in ponds, fish ponds.
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:56.560]  I have my own fish pond here where I am now.
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:59.000]  And I threw a bag of ion 14 in there.
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:03.280]  And we started making ion 14 for people
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:07.360]  that were raising shrimp in Ecuador
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:11.840]  because it benefits the whole ecosystem
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:16.320]  of the aquatic ecosystem and health of the animals,
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:18.600]  fish and stuff.
[02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:21.800]  So the same thing happens if you use it on the soil.
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:26.800]  So you're giving the microbes their ammunition,
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:30.120]  their raw materials with that ion 14.
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.800]  And if you use that, it doesn't matter which one you use,
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:37.280]  but the SpioAg SuperSilt is the one with the nano.
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:41.880]  And that was one you'd wanna use in a situation
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:46.880]  like hydroponics or foliar spray or watering,
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:48.280]  a container plant.
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:52.720]  Ones that they don't have like big spreading roots
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:57.680]  like out here in the forest where they can scavenge silica.
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:01.200]  So I don't know whether that answers it or not.
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:04.840]  And then the aminos can be used in combination
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:07.920]  with all that if you need it.
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:14.080]  But the aminos in a small amount are like a growth regulator.
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:15.520]  It's beyond the nitrogen.
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:19.600]  I wasn't a believer until I tried it.
[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:24.040]  Yeah, I'm a believer now.
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:25.760]  Well, it requires less energy.
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:30.600]  Yeah, microbes love it.
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:33.600]  Yeah, it's in a form that everybody likes.
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:34.440]  Pizza.
[02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:39.080]  Dr. Fels, I've heard of it discussed
[02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:42.880]  that it increases the rate of calcium uptake.
[02:58:42.880 --> 02:58:46.000]  Is that what you guys saw too in the aminos?
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:47.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:50.800]  Well, they have the calcium amino that has the calcium.
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:52.520]  It's cal amino, calcium.
[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:56.640]  Yeah, because when it's in an amino acid form,
[02:58:57.680 --> 02:59:01.840]  the roots, the cells just gobbles it up.
[02:59:01.840 --> 02:59:05.240]  And so normally, yeah, calcium is difficult.
[02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:07.640]  I mean, you can lime a soil
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:12.400]  and it might take six months before there's any increase
[02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:14.800]  in soluble calcium in the plant.
[02:59:15.600 --> 02:59:16.520]  It's very difficult.
[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:19.640]  And foliar spraying it kind of doesn't work
[02:59:19.640 --> 02:59:20.600]  or not very well.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:24.240]  But when you have a key, it's like a chelate
[02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:29.240]  when it's calcium and amino, aminos, calcium.
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:31.160]  And calcium is really important
[02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:34.360]  for the sweetness of fruits and sugars
[02:59:34.360 --> 02:59:36.240]  and just all kinds of things.
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:38.080]  I mean, if they consider it
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:42.520]  under the Albrecht testing theory of soil management,
[02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:44.200]  it's the queen of nutrients.
[02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:48.280]  It's the queen of nutrients.
[02:59:48.280 --> 02:59:52.160]  And so you have to have your pH right, or it doesn't matter.
[02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:55.080]  You know, it will be unavailable.
[02:59:55.080 --> 03:00:00.080]  But does you use lime to manage the pH too at the same time?
[03:00:00.280 --> 03:00:02.800]  So it's a nutrient and it's a soil amendment.
[03:00:03.840 --> 03:00:08.000]  So yeah, you gotta think about calcium.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:08.840]  That's another one.
[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:12.080]  Yeah, I mean, I could talk for an hour on that.
[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:15.280]  It's a big, big issue.
[03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:17.240]  Yeah, like my pond here the other day,
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:22.240]  I limed it with ultra fine agricultural limestone.
[03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:26.120]  I put ion 14 in there after that.
[03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:29.960]  And it's the same thing I'll do for the soil.
[03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:34.480]  The same thing I'll do for orchards or gardens,
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:37.160]  the same thing, at least here,
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:39.720]  where we have acid soils.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:41.080]  Let me get that straight.
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:44.400]  We get a lot of rain, okay?
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:45.920]  And that rain is acidic.
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:50.080]  So the soils will become the same pH as the rain.
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:51.760]  That's not good.
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:54.600]  So that's why, you know, we had to use a lot of lime.
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.040]  Well, in Idaho and California, and it's just the opposite.
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:01.720]  You had to use a lot of sulfur or acidic stuff
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:03.120]  to get the pH down.
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:09.840]  So it's that adjustment of pH has a super important effect
[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:14.720]  on phosphate and calcium availability and uptake.
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:17.080]  Super important.
[03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:23.520]  And we actually used lots and lots of biochar
[03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:26.520]  just because it's cheap.
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:30.300]  And because I know a guy that's got a big biochar operation.
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:35.300]  And so they use hardwoods and it's got a lot of lime
[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:41.100]  and potash from all these trees.
[03:01:41.100 --> 03:01:43.620]  Then they make a biochar out of it.
[03:01:43.620 --> 03:01:46.980]  So what's valuable in the biochar is all that ash.
[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:50.300]  There's a calcium and phosphorus and carbons and stuff.
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:53.860]  I'm not endorsing biochar,
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:58.860]  but if you can get it cheap locally, you know,
[03:01:59.660 --> 03:02:01.700]  it's got a pretty good blend of minerals
[03:02:01.700 --> 03:02:04.300]  because it's what was the tree.
[03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:09.300]  Hopefully a hardwood tree, not a Douglas fir or pine.
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:10.780]  Not that, not that.
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:14.900]  The hard, it goes back to the same old thing,
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:19.140]  just like agriculture where you burn down the forest
[03:02:19.140 --> 03:02:20.480]  and then you plant corn.
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:22.460]  Then you wait 20 years and do it again.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:28.980]  That's how you keep calcium available.
[03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:30.820]  If you don't have limestone,
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:32.600]  if you don't have an amendment,
[03:02:36.140 --> 03:02:36.980]  big subject.
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:41.620]  Yeah, we probably shouldn't say that for another time.
[03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:42.460]  Yeah.
[03:02:44.220 --> 03:02:46.220]  I don't know about you, Brian and Smiley,
[03:02:46.220 --> 03:02:48.980]  but I got to wrap it up like quickly.
[03:02:48.980 --> 03:02:52.020]  So I'd love to stay on for another hour,
[03:02:52.020 --> 03:02:54.540]  but I just can't today, unfortunately.
[03:02:54.540 --> 03:02:56.900]  And Doc, again, thank you so much for coming on.
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:02:58.460]  You bet, no problem.
[03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:01.160]  I was in the mood today, so.
[03:03:02.420 --> 03:03:04.460]  Well, hopefully you'll be in the mood in the future
[03:03:04.460 --> 03:03:06.160]  to do your water deep dive.
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:07.860]  Yeah, that'd be excellent.
[03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:09.900]  Yeah, my water deep dive.
[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:11.900]  Sounds good, I like the sound of that.
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:15.020]  Yeah, all right, well, some Thursday in the near future,
[03:03:15.020 --> 03:03:17.220]  let's set something up behind the scenes.
[03:03:17.220 --> 03:03:19.300]  Bob, I like it when you're in the mood.
[03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:23.780]  Well, that's because I ate mushrooms yesterday.
[03:03:23.780 --> 03:03:24.620]  Oh, there you go.
[03:03:24.620 --> 03:03:25.460]  Yeah.
[03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:27.380]  Hell yeah.
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:29.420]  Nice.
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:30.260]  All right.
[03:03:30.260 --> 03:03:32.100]  Peter, do you have any house cleaning or?
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:34.860]  Yeah, so I don't know if we're gonna,
[03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:43.860]  cool, Chad just emailed a flyer for Saturday's show.
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:46.300]  We're gonna do, so tomorrow,
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:49.640]  supposedly we have Bruce Bugbee coming on.
[03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:55.100]  So today, are you still on the chat?
[03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:56.900]  Are you prepping your PowerPoint?
[03:03:56.900 --> 03:03:58.180]  Oh, we just lost Bob.
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:01.700]  I don't know if you met, did you mean to leave?
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:04.740]  I'm still here, Noah, I hear you, I see you.
[03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:12.140]  So Ken, who was in the chat, let's see if Ken,
[03:04:12.420 --> 03:04:13.500]  Ken, are you still there?
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:16.620]  Ken was gonna give a quick basics of,
[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:19.020]  yes, there you are, Ken.
[03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:20.060]  Ken is still there.
[03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:23.460]  All right, so after this, we're gonna quickly,
[03:04:23.460 --> 03:04:26.580]  Ken's gonna do a lighting 101
[03:04:27.580 --> 03:04:32.580]  based off of some Dr. Bugbee presentations.
[03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:36.940]  And then tonight, Hota Erb and Nick will be talking,
[03:04:36.940 --> 03:04:38.540]  I think, phosphorus.
[03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:41.780]  And then tomorrow,
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:48.540]  we have a minor cannabinoid conversation with Dr. Marks.
[03:04:50.220 --> 03:04:52.940]  Thank you, Shredder Bob, we need to see that tattoo.
[03:04:53.020 --> 03:04:57.940]  Scandlone or Scandone, sorry, Mark, if you're watching.
[03:04:57.940 --> 03:04:59.740]  He's gonna talk minor cannabinoids,
[03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:01.860]  and we're gonna have some minor cannabinoid breeders
[03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:03.940]  come on, that's with Elka.
[03:05:03.940 --> 03:05:06.460]  And then after that, I think, is the Dr. Faust.
[03:05:06.460 --> 03:05:10.580]  So as much as I can remember calendar-wise,
[03:05:14.340 --> 03:05:15.700]  oh, you do have them confirmed, okay.
[03:05:15.700 --> 03:05:17.700]  Yeah, no, but I didn't know what time.
[03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:23.060]  So anyway, but with that, everybody enjoy your lunch
[03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:27.380]  or very, very early dinner, depending on where you are.
[03:05:28.740 --> 03:05:31.620]  And actually, sorry, and I wish,
[03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:35.380]  with Brandon, one of the things I wanted to ask
[03:05:35.380 --> 03:05:39.260]  related to the first conversation was kind of like,
[03:05:39.260 --> 03:05:42.380]  not necessarily one versus the other, but I think,
[03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:44.860]  and this maybe applies more in a commercial setting
[03:05:44.860 --> 03:05:47.740]  where people's livelihood depends on it.
[03:05:47.740 --> 03:05:50.460]  Someone's trying to be kind of like living soil
[03:05:50.460 --> 03:05:54.780]  and sourcing everything locally from their farm, whatever,
[03:05:54.780 --> 03:05:57.940]  but they have some sort of issue or deficiency
[03:05:57.940 --> 03:06:02.940]  and they reach for a bottle of something as a quick fix.
[03:06:03.660 --> 03:06:07.180]  And I think that's probably a situation you see
[03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:09.700]  more frequently, at least at the commercial level
[03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:11.860]  of people doing kind of living soil things
[03:06:11.860 --> 03:06:15.260]  where it's like, they're halfway through a grow
[03:06:15.260 --> 03:06:18.420]  and something's wrong and they just need something quick.
[03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:19.900]  And then the question is like,
[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:22.420]  if you just add a little bit of something,
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:25.500]  you're not gonna hopefully kill all the microbial,
[03:06:25.500 --> 03:06:28.780]  but it's more like, I need a fix of something.
[03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:32.380]  I'm gonna reach for something is kind of what I've seen.
[03:06:32.380 --> 03:06:33.420]  Yeah.
[03:06:33.420 --> 03:06:36.220]  As long as they re-inoculate, it's not gonna be a problem.
[03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:40.220]  But if you don't, you knock back some of your diversity,
[03:06:40.220 --> 03:06:41.740]  then you're gonna have issues.
[03:06:42.980 --> 03:06:45.900]  Yeah, you might have issues, but you can fine tune,
[03:06:45.900 --> 03:06:50.020]  but it's, this is what we used to do in big scale organics.
[03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:54.060]  You go out in the field and you do a foliar test,
[03:06:54.060 --> 03:06:57.140]  a leaf analysis, and you know what the standards are
[03:06:57.140 --> 03:07:00.540]  because they've established what these standards are.
[03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:03.780]  So you find out, oh, oh, oh shit,
[03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:05.940]  looks like a zinc deficiency.
[03:07:05.940 --> 03:07:09.100]  So then you go out and they get the sprayer out
[03:07:10.700 --> 03:07:15.700]  or the airplane and we'd spray, we'd go zinc
[03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:21.820]  kelp using sulfate, kelp extract, humic acid,
[03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:25.020]  and then if you needed manganese,
[03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:27.900]  that was frequently a problem, we'd add manganese.
[03:07:28.780 --> 03:07:33.580]  So yeah, so if you do that, you can do the quick fix,
[03:07:33.580 --> 03:07:35.700]  but you know what you're trying to fix.
[03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:39.100]  So that's how we did it.
[03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:43.940]  So you test, get back, and we did it with hemp too.
[03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:48.540]  There's a lab that we send samples to for hemp
[03:07:48.540 --> 03:07:51.700]  that have the standards for hemp.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:55.020]  So we're looking at it and then we're adjusting
[03:07:55.020 --> 03:08:00.020]  what we're doing with the foliar to try to,
[03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:01.700]  up whatever the problem was.
[03:08:03.300 --> 03:08:07.340]  So yeah, it's doable, but a shotgun approach,
[03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:08.940]  oh, I need something, well, what do you need?
[03:08:08.940 --> 03:08:10.620]  I don't know, but I need something.
[03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:13.860]  Okay, when farmers would say that to me,
[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:19.820]  I'd say, okay, kelp, kelp extract, go spray it.
[03:08:22.620 --> 03:08:25.300]  And they feel like they're doing something,
[03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:26.460]  they're doing some good.
[03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:31.300]  Okay, and a lot of times you get a nice response,
[03:08:31.300 --> 03:08:36.300]  you get a nice green up and they look good.
[03:08:37.420 --> 03:08:39.260]  A lot of the farmers were skeptical,
[03:08:39.260 --> 03:08:42.860]  they'd say, well, I'll try it on half of my field.
[03:08:43.660 --> 03:08:45.660]  Okay, they spray kelp.
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:49.820]  And then this was like sugar beets or potatoes or something.
[03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:51.700]  And they'd come back to me later and say,
[03:08:51.700 --> 03:08:54.260]  why didn't you have me put it on the whole field?
[03:08:54.260 --> 03:08:55.620]  Look at the difference here.
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:08:59.140]  Because you didn't want to, you didn't trust me,
[03:08:59.140 --> 03:09:00.980]  you want to put on half of the field.
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:04.780]  You know, why didn't you put it on?
[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:08.740]  So yeah, I mean, that's just a good kelp product.
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:12.540]  If you're gonna do a shotgun approach,
[03:09:13.220 --> 03:09:14.340]  that's probably your best.
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:16.820]  Because the kelp has everything.
[03:09:16.820 --> 03:09:18.380]  I mean, it has, it's a plant.
[03:09:19.860 --> 03:09:23.940]  So, but there's other stuff.
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:26.700]  I mean, I know what you got in grow shops, you know,
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:29.380]  because I go to grow shops.
[03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:33.700]  Matter of fact, the guy that works for me now,
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:36.620]  he ran a grow shop for 20 years.
[03:09:36.620 --> 03:09:38.580]  My key guy, Josh.
[03:09:39.580 --> 03:09:43.220]  So yeah, there's a lot of products out there that,
[03:09:44.220 --> 03:09:45.820]  it's just like agriculture.
[03:09:45.820 --> 03:09:49.380]  I mean, it just doesn't necessarily work.
[03:09:49.380 --> 03:09:51.620]  They just got people thinking they need it,
[03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:53.020]  and that it works.
[03:09:54.460 --> 03:09:56.460]  You know, maybe it works, I don't know.
[03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:00.660]  But if I tell you something that works, it'll work.
[03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:05.660]  And it's not because I read a lot of books.
[03:10:07.660 --> 03:10:11.660]  Well, with that, I can see Leighton thinking about,
[03:10:11.660 --> 03:10:14.460]  I can see like the little thought bubble
[03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:19.460]  with like a big side of steak
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:22.260]  floating around above your head or something.
[03:10:22.260 --> 03:10:23.740]  No, but he's spot on.
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:26.620]  How often do I say kelp is the key, right?
[03:10:26.620 --> 03:10:28.420]  Kelp is an important part of life.
[03:10:28.460 --> 03:10:30.220]  Kelp is the key, right?
[03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:32.620]  Kelp is an amazing additive.
[03:10:32.620 --> 03:10:33.460]  And so it's nice to use.
[03:10:33.460 --> 03:10:35.620]  It's been used for centuries.
[03:10:35.620 --> 03:10:38.340]  It's been used for thousands of years
[03:10:38.340 --> 03:10:41.460]  by my Scandinavian ancestors, for sure.
[03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:46.460]  Irish, Scandinavians, you know, they use kelp,
[03:10:46.460 --> 03:10:51.460]  fed it to animals even, you know, and then use the manure.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:54.500]  But no, I had some guy in Germany named Thomas
[03:10:54.540 --> 03:10:58.620]  who wants me to do a whole series of like a school,
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:03.180]  online courses and stuff, you know,
[03:11:04.580 --> 03:11:05.820]  a series of things.
[03:11:05.820 --> 03:11:07.580]  And I don't know the logistics
[03:11:07.580 --> 03:11:09.180]  of trying to do stuff like that.
[03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:15.300]  But yeah, the world needs it, you know.
[03:11:18.580 --> 03:11:22.380]  If we're gonna survive at all, which I don't think we are,
[03:11:22.380 --> 03:11:27.380]  but you know, I'm still willing to try to help people,
[03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:30.220]  individuals, I don't know about the world.
[03:11:30.220 --> 03:11:31.900]  World can take care of itself.
[03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:37.380]  All right, Smiley, give us something to be optimistic about
[03:11:37.380 --> 03:11:39.260]  as we close this out.
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:45.680]  Well, you can be optimistic looking forward
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:48.760]  to see Chad Westport on Eagle Gardens tonight.
[03:11:50.720 --> 03:11:52.800]  Excellent, all right.
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:55.360]  There is optimism left in the world.
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:57.680]  There's optimism, in dope there's hope.
[03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:02.960]  All right, with that, I will let everyone go
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:04.800]  because I gotta fire this back up
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:09.800]  with a lighting primer in advance of tomorrow.
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:12.760]  Good, good, well, I'm gonna go have my breakfast.
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:15.640]  Thank you for your time, Mr. Klaus.
[03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:20.800]  Are there any stray mushrooms left on the coffee table
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:22.440]  or are you all done?
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:24.880]  I don't know.
[03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:30.000]  Undecided, the day is young.
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:32.160]  Yeah.
[03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:34.160]  Maybe after, if you can ping me
[03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:35.640]  after you eat those mushrooms,
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:39.080]  I'll fire up the channel and we'll bring you back on.
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:41.840]  I can talk about that all day.
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:43.800]  We'll see where the conversation goes, yeah.
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:45.880]  That's my favorite subject now
[03:12:45.880 --> 03:12:49.520]  because I'm on all these YouTube or all these Zoom calls
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:53.160]  because the state of Oregon is developing regulations
[03:12:53.160 --> 03:12:56.480]  for psilocybin mushrooms, for healing centers,
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:58.640]  for growers, for the whole thing.
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:02.520]  So it's a first in the world, it's history.
[03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:06.400]  It's the first time, like, yeah, which I mean, of course,
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:10.520]  since Nixon, let's say, I mean,
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:14.120]  I remember before the war on drugs
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:17.080]  when the shit was legal, okay, so, but yeah.
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:20.240]  So yeah, so they're developing this program,
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:21.840]  which I think is a breakthrough
[03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:24.880]  and I'm trying to help with it.
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:29.280]  So that's something we can do a seminar on too,
[03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:30.520]  growing mushrooms.
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:32.920]  If we do it after my kids go to bed,
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:37.520]  I have some mushrooms right over there and yeah.
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:39.240]  I got some stored away too.
[03:13:40.240 --> 03:13:44.160]  Oh, well, we have the Zoom ceremony then, you know.
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:45.000]  I've always wanted to do that.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.560]  You see what happened, the state voted on this
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:48.520]  just this week.
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:53.280]  We were lobbying for the indigenous and sacramental use,
[03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:57.040]  the religious use of sacred mushrooms
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:00.800]  as a part of their overall program, see?
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:03.240]  And they voted yes.
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:05.000]  Nice.
[03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:09.840]  All right, well, that's, this is the best idea.
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:11.440]  That's good news, that's good, you wanted good news,
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:12.360]  there's good news.
[03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:18.000]  Yeah, we will do our mushroom show at some point.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.160]  For me, it just has to be after my kids go to bed.
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:22.800]  But I'm always so tired at night that
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:23.840]  I usually fall asleep.
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:27.520]  Yeah, well, me too, but not if I didn't have mushrooms.
[03:14:27.520 --> 03:14:29.200]  Zoom and shroom.
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:30.960]  All right, thank you everyone.
[03:14:30.960 --> 03:14:32.400]  I'm gonna kill the broadcast.
