[00:00.000 --> 00:04.680]  All right, everybody tell me if we are live in the chat
[00:05.320 --> 00:07.320]  Let's wait to see
[00:08.640 --> 00:12.560]  All right, well, well I'm actually he's
[00:14.400 --> 00:20.800]  Six five with the afro six nine is Masonic smoker
[00:24.080 --> 00:26.000]  So
[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  Take it away Brian
[00:28.440 --> 00:34.480]  Yeah, what's up guys Brian Waksman 303 organic cannabis here last these last two weeks
[00:34.480 --> 00:39.200]  I put up a few things in my stories and I was trying to ask the community who you know
[00:39.200 --> 00:40.720]  Who do you guys want to hear from?
[00:40.720 --> 00:47.160]  I mean overwhelmingly everything in the and the DMS came back Masonic smoker Masonic smoker Eddie Edgar
[00:47.440 --> 00:50.720]  So we've reached out to him and that's why he's on the show today
[00:50.720 --> 00:53.720]  It's because you guys reached out to me and said that you wanted to hear from him
[00:53.720 --> 01:00.560]  So we're excited to hear all about Masonic and what he's after and let's talk a little bit also about your store
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.560]  I heard that's a opening up here soon as well
[01:03.640 --> 01:10.360]  Yeah, man. Thanks for asking about the store. That's cool. I'm I was trying to open a store on
[01:10.880 --> 01:12.320]  in the hood
[01:12.320 --> 01:18.520]  But I figure there's too much shock factor for people to come to the hood like like they'd have to think of two things
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.120]  You know, like alright, do you want to go to the hood and like?
[01:22.240 --> 01:27.360]  You know, there'd be different things to think about like maybe your car getting broken into or something and I don't want that pressure on me
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.040]  So we're not doing it in the hood
[01:29.040 --> 01:33.840]  We figured why not where all the dudes that go by cool stuff buy stuff
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.040]  We'll set up there Fairfax where supreme that rip and dip all these, you know, hype be shop
[01:40.040 --> 01:45.960]  So I set up shop directly on that Avenue freakin walking distance from Shabinsky shop
[01:45.960 --> 01:49.680]  Which is literally you can count the steps it takes to get there from my place
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.760]  60 days give or take I mean, you know already demoed the place already set in the floor already did all types of things
[01:56.760 --> 02:02.680]  So that place is ready to go and I only got the second part of your question. I
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.320]  Was the first part? Oh
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.080]  I was just letting everybody know that I put out the stories in my
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.080]  Instagram last week and the overwhelming majority of them wanted to hear from you. Oh
[02:15.080 --> 02:22.200]  Yeah, we're trying to give everybody a platform and just people that are influencing the industry people that have influenced the industry
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.360]  And that's why I reached out at least on my side of things
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.680]  To our viewers and we're like, you know, who do you want to talk to man? And they said the boy from Compton
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.680]  So that's why I'm here
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.000]  Shout out those guys. I'm gonna go ahead and get the next question. I'm gonna go ahead and get the next question
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I'm gonna go ahead and get the next question. I'm gonna go ahead and get the next question
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.720]  Yeah, we've had some interesting guests talking about pollen shocking, you know from a lot from the or two from the West Coast one from the
[02:47.720 --> 02:52.160]  Midwest and dying to hear what it's like in the urban, you know scene. I mean
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.360]  I mean
[02:53.360 --> 02:57.840]  Call it what you want to call it pollen chuck and seed making all this other shit
[02:57.840 --> 03:02.760]  But at the end of the day fucking I call it just putting seeds in people's hands and then running nose
[03:02.760 --> 03:06.480]  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean
[03:06.480 --> 03:12.360]  Fucking I call it just putting seeds in people's hands and then running numbers on their hash or yield or whatever, you know
[03:12.600 --> 03:15.680]  so fucking I think pollen chucking has a
[03:16.560 --> 03:19.040]  You know like a negative connotation towards it
[03:19.040 --> 03:21.440]  I don't think I would want to be called a pollen checker, you know
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.140]  So so just you know seed maker would be a better one, you know what I mean?
[03:25.440 --> 03:29.360]  So so seed maker on the West Coast just just do it man
[03:29.360 --> 03:35.160]  I tell everybody just do it fucking make seeds make seeds. Fuck it. Fuck. Fuck the unwritten rules
[03:35.480 --> 03:37.480]  It's never set in stone
[03:37.800 --> 03:43.000]  Just it's just another barrier for you to you know, not do whatever so just do whatever you want
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.240]  It's plant who cares they want it. They can have it if they don't you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't
[03:49.480 --> 03:51.480]  Love the toad man. Love the toad
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.760]  Yeah
[03:53.760 --> 03:56.040]  People have you can come out on these last few weeks
[03:56.840 --> 04:01.560]  You know kind of stating how they feel about it as a breeder as a seed maker saying, you know
[04:01.560 --> 04:03.560]  a few of them were even saying hey once I
[04:03.840 --> 04:09.240]  Buy your seeds, you know, they belong to me now and I and I'm gonna do what I want with them and that kind of
[04:09.240 --> 04:12.340]  Stuff and then there's you know, the other camp that feels like
[04:12.860 --> 04:15.280]  There is unwritten rules and you have to kind of play that
[04:15.280 --> 04:18.580]  So if you want to kind of wrap about that for a little bit
[04:18.580 --> 04:21.440]  I know a lot of people would love to hear like your side of things
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.920]  One thing I do get is okay. Say say for instance capulator gave me a shiver me timbers, right?
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.440]  I any and I made a cross with it. This is a highly esteemed guy
[04:32.440 --> 04:38.520]  We did a face-to-face interaction is like a real handshake, you know what I mean? So that's that's
[04:38.840 --> 04:44.120]  Enough written for me. I respect that now. There's guys that sell you a $500 pack
[04:44.200 --> 04:48.520]  They never do this coral jewel thing. Then they see somebody, you know
[04:49.080 --> 04:54.760]  Make a name for themselves per se off of you know, something they got from somebody else's work now. They're upset
[04:55.520 --> 05:01.760]  People got to address things, you know the right way and and and there's a time to be upset about things
[05:01.760 --> 05:03.760]  but then there's like
[05:04.880 --> 05:11.920]  Corn ball maze about it. I don't trip personally on anything if I don't want people to have it. I don't release it
[05:11.920 --> 05:13.920]  It's that simple
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.240]  Yeah, I would say that most people probably echo that that sentiment. I mean once it's out there
[05:20.160 --> 05:26.800]  We were even joking with Bodhi last week with a fish. You're not up putting out like once I release something she belongs to the streets
[05:27.800 --> 05:33.480]  Yeah, that's kind of corny I don't like that that way of talking all right fair enough
[05:35.600 --> 05:41.660]  Nice so, uh, hey, can we dive into your growing technique you in the ground and pots and beds? What are you doing?
[05:42.040 --> 05:47.400]  Everything dude, I've done a little bit of everything right now. I'm growing for seed production. So I do the bare minimum
[05:47.400 --> 05:50.200]  I'll grab a I'll grab a one gallon
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.120]  I'll let that shit tap into the ground and fucking blow up and
[05:53.400 --> 05:58.120]  Call it a day or I'll grab a 30 gallon pot and it won't happen to the ground or it may happen
[05:58.320 --> 06:00.320]  Let it blow up call it a day
[06:00.600 --> 06:05.960]  Freaking right on this last run. I literally used I used a bunch of roots organics. I used
[06:06.480 --> 06:11.600]  Like roots organics. I was just like as the medium I use the redbud soil living soil, but I'm over here
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.720]  I don't even like the chlorinate or you know reverse osmosis. I just like water. I'm like, whatever
[06:16.720 --> 06:20.800]  I just kind of I just did it whatever it in a I top dressed with
[06:21.200 --> 06:24.160]  What's that was that thing called beanstalk agriculture, it's one of my
[06:24.800 --> 06:28.720]  Buddies things either like try this. It's like an extended release feeding program
[06:28.720 --> 06:33.440]  But at the end of the day all that is for seed production. It's not no none of this is gonna get smoked
[06:33.440 --> 06:38.000]  It's just to maximize and as far as the last time I did for
[06:38.640 --> 06:42.480]  Hash, which was recently to show out the seeds that I made recently
[06:42.480 --> 06:48.000]  I did a I ran mills and call it a day and fucking knows some of the best hash probably the best hash I've had
[06:48.560 --> 06:50.560]  today
[06:50.800 --> 06:52.800]  What was the cultivar you were using
[06:53.600 --> 06:58.560]  Everything I used the everybody stuff every clone anything cool on the market
[06:59.120 --> 07:03.120]  Last run I did a all my Wilson hybrids that I crossed to everything
[07:04.240 --> 07:10.800]  Everything like I really have to sit here with like a list like going out the door of what I grew any given time
[07:11.520 --> 07:13.760]  And you threw all that into the hash mix
[07:14.560 --> 07:18.240]  Yes, mix hash phenol hunt run or whatever. It was like 6% average
[07:18.480 --> 07:20.480]  Nice nice
[07:21.040 --> 07:23.600]  So smorgasbord of friggin cultivars
[07:24.640 --> 07:26.640]  Or the ones that are sticking out for you
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.520]  Uh shoot like my the the poontang pie will send stuck out
[07:31.520 --> 07:36.080]  This is from the the recent hash run the Malibu Marsha and sure enough like I
[07:38.080 --> 07:43.020]  Told people well the a guys these are the numbers come back in left and right
[07:43.020 --> 07:46.540]  Oh, you know five five five five, you know five percent close to six
[07:46.540 --> 07:51.500]  You know a lot of a lot of five in any given, you know, 12 pack of seeds people are finding fives
[07:51.500 --> 07:53.500]  Which is pretty dope
[07:54.060 --> 07:56.060]  Yeah
[07:56.060 --> 07:59.820]  And that's whole plant fresh frozen for anybody that's like what is he talking about fives like no
[07:59.820 --> 08:04.460]  This is when they wash it do do do do they got you know the mail and then they squish it
[08:04.460 --> 08:09.820]  They're left with the you know, five percent from whatever whole plant fresh frozen material that they washed
[08:11.820 --> 08:13.820]  And that's really what I
[08:14.060 --> 08:18.300]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you were you know, maybe two years ago
[08:18.940 --> 08:24.220]  Really starting to come on to the scene on instagram and then um just continuing to post. I know that you're
[08:24.780 --> 08:26.780]  You know you post constantly and it seems like
[08:27.420 --> 08:33.660]  Now you've really made a name for yourself. I'm coming from you know where you came from. I would love to learn more about that
[08:34.380 --> 08:37.660]  Kind of as a self-made individual. I like that kind of story
[08:38.460 --> 08:42.060]  I mean, I just gave it my best shot. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie
[08:42.060 --> 08:47.980]  I mean, I just gave it my best shot. I've been growing i've been smoking since I was you know, 15
[08:48.540 --> 08:50.540]  Never stopped not once
[08:50.620 --> 08:55.420]  uh, just kept smoking kept growing I always grow for funsies and uh
[08:55.980 --> 09:01.980]  Little did I know i'd end up in this position, you know getting interviewed or something crazy like that. I was working at ride-aid
[09:02.540 --> 09:06.460]  Uh two years ago, you know what I mean? So freaking life's crazy like that
[09:07.020 --> 09:13.100]  What just shows man, I mean you're on there all day long you're obviously putting in the work, um, i'm on instagram
[09:13.180 --> 09:16.300]  I know I know the amount of work that it takes to really start to build a following
[09:16.540 --> 09:18.860]  I know you're getting your accounts deleted for your you know
[09:18.860 --> 09:25.020]  Your own personality and having fun with it and that kind of stuff. Um, and now you really build a uh following and it really
[09:25.740 --> 09:29.020]  It doesn't really matter now if they delete your account that following comes right back
[09:29.100 --> 09:34.140]  And I feel like that's the real difference in the cannabis space. A lot of these guys have these fake followers fake accounts
[09:34.620 --> 09:39.500]  Um, and so they're not able to sell when they put out a t-shirt or something like that because they don't actually have a real
[09:39.580 --> 09:43.020]  Following so that's something else that I like to see man is that you're authentic
[09:43.340 --> 09:47.340]  Um that your following comes back no matter what the ig police try to do to you
[09:48.300 --> 09:56.220]  Yeah, man freaking uh, I just kept it true. I kept it true and uh, I tell people just be good good people usually
[09:56.940 --> 09:59.820]  prevail, I mean if you're a shitty person that shit will
[10:00.540 --> 10:02.540]  Show so if I could
[10:02.540 --> 10:09.340]  And I just kept it kept it real. I keep it real. So sounds like we're like this guy keeps it real. He's you know, whatever
[10:10.140 --> 10:13.580]  I just don't keep it real till it goes wrong like dave chapelle, but you know
[10:16.620 --> 10:18.620]  So tell us a little bit about the wilson
[10:19.880 --> 10:22.880]  Wilson wilson is banana og papaya
[10:23.740 --> 10:27.100]  times tropicana f2 so banana og papaya
[10:27.740 --> 10:28.940]  is oni
[10:28.940 --> 10:36.220]  Uh is is is from the oni banner when harry palms used to work with oni. So that's a banana og papaya
[10:36.860 --> 10:39.660]  femme stock that I found freaking
[10:40.300 --> 10:44.140]  Feels like four years ago now. I I I I popped a couple of those
[10:44.940 --> 10:47.980]  And uh, this is when the first some of the first papaya
[10:48.620 --> 10:52.700]  femmes were available to people point blank period and I I just had my kind of
[10:53.900 --> 10:57.260]  Nose on that and I figured here goes nothing. I I grew
[10:58.220 --> 11:03.020]  A banana og papaya purple punch papaya three chem papaya
[11:04.040 --> 11:06.040]  fabuloso papaya
[11:06.060 --> 11:09.020]  And I think there's one more but I can't think of it right now
[11:09.420 --> 11:15.260]  And I grew those out and the banana og papaya really stuck out to me amongst those papaya hybrids
[11:15.740 --> 11:21.260]  And at the time I had a tropicana f2 mel from growing those out because that's when the trop f2s were released as well
[11:21.420 --> 11:25.900]  Which everybody fucking loves and grows to this day and i'm all like that's a special plant
[11:26.540 --> 11:31.180]  Uh, I I I asked harry palms at the time because he was part of the oni banner. I was like, hey
[11:31.980 --> 11:36.940]  Is this a good you know, here goes the unwritten rules like i'm following the rules, you know, i'm asking permission
[11:37.100 --> 11:39.100]  So I asked permission. He says go for it
[11:39.660 --> 11:42.860]  Oni hits me up. He's like hey, what the fuck I was gonna do that
[11:43.100 --> 11:48.940]  And that's how we work together because I was all like hey i'm like if you say no, it's no he's like i'll you know
[11:49.100 --> 11:53.900]  We can work together. So we we work together and that's how I you know, you play your cards, right?
[11:54.620 --> 11:55.900]  You know
[11:55.900 --> 11:58.460]  You'd be in a good spot like I didn't break any of the rules
[11:58.540 --> 12:05.020]  That's what people give me. I broke the rules after I just started popping seeds and just just killing first asking questions later
[12:05.420 --> 12:09.820]  That's when I started breaking rules, but that's like I wasn't that's not a cash grab for me
[12:09.820 --> 12:11.820]  That's just me having fun in my backyard
[12:12.140 --> 12:16.780]  And uh and throwing it on the side apparently but who gives a rat's ass people can do whatever the fuck they want
[12:16.780 --> 12:18.780]  And that's where the unwritten rules get mixed up
[12:19.020 --> 12:23.260]  But like i'm not trying to make a namesake off of a f1 hybrid now
[12:23.660 --> 12:28.300]  The wilson f1 hybrid I did kind of make a namesake, but I asked permission and followed
[12:28.620 --> 12:31.100]  You know the routes and when as far as f2 in it
[12:31.180 --> 12:36.780]  I have an f3 that only me oni and probably two other people have that i'm f4ing but people want to be like
[12:37.260 --> 12:39.260]  I like to people like blood man
[12:39.340 --> 12:41.740]  They don't want to hear all this shit and when they do hear the shit
[12:41.820 --> 12:46.380]  They got to come to avenues like this because instagram they only get you know
[12:46.700 --> 12:51.580]  Gems here and there if they go to like any given interview i'll talk to you guys like this, you know what I mean?
[12:53.660 --> 12:55.260]  How's it going
[12:55.260 --> 12:57.980]  That's one of the reasons why we wanted to reach out to you man
[12:57.980 --> 13:01.900]  Is because we're trying to build a platform where we can have open dialogue and let's talk
[13:02.220 --> 13:06.080]  Let's air certain things out without like drama sake, you know, we're just having a conversation
[13:06.460 --> 13:11.260]  Bunch of men sitting around having a conversation. I feel like that sadly is missing in our industry
[13:11.340 --> 13:15.660]  Yeah, instagram. Everybody has a rock and and they're just throwing it at each other. They don't give a fuck
[13:16.220 --> 13:19.420]  They'll never see each other and when you do they're just like
[13:20.060 --> 13:26.940]  Like dude you were talking all that stuff man, what's up with you now? They're like, oh you're crazy masonic. Okay, whatever i'm crazy
[13:26.940 --> 13:28.940]  I'm the crazy person
[13:31.020 --> 13:33.020]  Love it dude, love it
[13:33.660 --> 13:34.780]  so
[13:34.780 --> 13:39.820]  There's been some uh drama in the industry that i'd like to air out. Um
[13:40.780 --> 13:43.900]  I believe recently you got a cut of acapulco gold
[13:44.380 --> 13:50.940]  Yeah, man, that's this is crazy this is I didn't even know uh that that acapulco gold shit man
[13:50.940 --> 13:53.980]  That guy is a scumbag. Not not not michael
[13:54.780 --> 14:01.820]  The fucking steven lindow, whatever the fuck his name is. I knew him through his instagram tag through two short
[14:02.620 --> 14:07.020]  Uh interactions. Yo, I got these cool cuts you want them? Fuck. Yeah. I don't know nothing about dude
[14:07.020 --> 14:09.020]  I just know that he has these cool cuts
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.380]  Cool cuts
[14:10.380 --> 14:12.400]  Met him once got a starfighter
[14:13.100 --> 14:19.600]  And a couple other things whatever that was like back in march or some shit. Then he recently comes in october
[14:20.140 --> 14:20.940]  like
[14:20.940 --> 14:24.940]  fucking fifth or fourth or some shit like two days before you know, uh
[14:25.580 --> 14:32.700]  That crazy shit happened and and and and fucking little did I know there was a fucking psychopath sitting in front of me
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.780]  for for like an hour
[14:34.940 --> 14:39.180]  For for a fucking trade and then and then fucking two days later
[14:40.540 --> 14:43.900]  Dudes that know me hit me up. They're like they're like, hey, dude, you're homie
[14:44.140 --> 14:47.020]  I'm, like dude miss know your boy people like to say your boy
[14:47.340 --> 14:52.380]  And i'm like man miss me that with your boy shit because my only boy is is at school right now
[14:52.460 --> 14:57.900]  He's in front of his fucking class. I don't have boys. I have you know, I keep it short. I keep it tight
[14:58.140 --> 15:00.620]  I'd have a lot of interactions. I have a big platform
[15:00.700 --> 15:05.180]  I'm, very polarized and of course everybody's gonna be my boy if you look at it from that perspective
[15:05.340 --> 15:10.220]  But yeah, that guy's a fucking shithead scumbag and as far as the alcapoco goals, uh concern
[15:10.540 --> 15:17.740]  It's under my 24 hour light greenie nice and clean tuck and with that proceeds anything I do with that is gonna go
[15:18.060 --> 15:19.660]  to his lady
[15:19.660 --> 15:21.660]  for any you know, uh
[15:22.220 --> 15:27.340]  Voids that can be filled with with that, you know, because because that's that's that's a shit show man. I'm not
[15:27.980 --> 15:31.180]  I do not condone murdering especially somebody so
[15:31.900 --> 15:37.040]  I didn't know michael. I didn't know nobody dude. I didn't know nothing. All I knew was I was trading genetics
[15:37.820 --> 15:41.340]  And and if you want to take it that far we can get like spiritual the plant
[15:42.060 --> 15:48.560]  Made it here. You know what I mean? And and it's gonna freaking end up in people's hands because that's what I do. I encapsulate
[15:49.500 --> 15:50.600]  freaking
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.900]  Profile and and put it in people's hands and and I can do it in in a good way too where I can
[15:56.300 --> 15:59.260]  Actually give you know money to his uh
[15:59.820 --> 16:06.380]  Estate or whatever it is that that might need some money. You know what I mean? And and freaking rest in peace. Michael hendon
[16:07.020 --> 16:10.780]  Uh, steven lindow, whatever the fuck his name is. I hope you rot in jail
[16:11.580 --> 16:13.580]  That's my two cents on that
[16:14.380 --> 16:18.620]  Oh, dude, I I'm so happy to hear that. I mean michael was a genius
[16:19.260 --> 16:20.540]  huge heart
[16:20.540 --> 16:25.340]  Uh loving soul, you know his relationship with brianna is is beyond
[16:26.060 --> 16:30.300]  Words for what love really is and and steven was a part of their fucking crew
[16:30.860 --> 16:37.100]  So poor brianna got her fucking ass handed to her, you know a part of her crew for six seven years murders her fucking man
[16:37.580 --> 16:43.100]  Over this shit. I don't even know any of this. Like yeah. Yeah. No, I know. I know i'm just hey, it's all good, dude
[16:43.180 --> 16:44.220]  I'm, just airing this shit out
[16:44.220 --> 16:46.620]  Oh, no, that's why like just to give you perspective like yeah
[16:46.700 --> 16:51.580]  Like all this is new to me and it's crazy man, and and I fucking and it sucks, you know what I mean?
[16:51.820 --> 16:56.620]  Dude it does I was with her yesterday and i'm like, you know girl i'ma i'ma bring this up
[16:56.700 --> 17:01.900]  I'm gonna lay it out and and I believe he's probably gonna be you know behind all this shit and for you to say that
[17:01.980 --> 17:06.060]  Is just beautiful man. It's just an honor to meet another honest person and peter
[17:06.060 --> 17:10.380]  Will you throw up that uh, go fund me page so the listeners out there can help?
[17:10.700 --> 17:15.660]  I mean, I know this community rowels if you look at this screen, it's it's right under all of us
[17:16.280 --> 17:20.620]  Beautiful, uh, you know help help this girl out man. She's trying to carry on his work
[17:21.180 --> 17:25.580]  She's trying to you know make a go at living here and and finishing stuff
[17:25.740 --> 17:30.300]  Um and not bailing and going back to florida where she'd be lost and and all of his you know
[17:30.380 --> 17:32.620]  Years of work would be lost. So yeah
[17:34.300 --> 17:41.500]  Let me say one last thing I am not gonna release any of the cuts i'm gonna encapsulate it in the seed cross to wilson
[17:41.660 --> 17:43.900]  So that that all that hard work
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.200]  There he is, there's our boy you can have it, you know what I mean? Uh
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.480]  Random joe schmoe. They are not allowed to have this this this, you know this thing, you know what I mean?
[18:00.560 --> 18:02.560]  It's not it's not worth it for them
[18:03.040 --> 18:09.440]  And you know, I totally believe in the spirituality and the universe hard at work and that you needed to get that fucking cut
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.560]  You need it. You hit it right on the head. You hit it right on the right
[18:13.280 --> 18:20.160]  And uh, she's she's gonna roll out a seed company because she's got a ton of his work that that she's now carrying on
[18:20.720 --> 18:23.760]  Uh peter, can you flip up that um that ig?
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.880]  Logo so people can see that as well. And I just hope the community rallies around her
[18:29.440 --> 18:34.080]  Brings her big love and support as she rolls out these seeds and you know
[18:34.320 --> 18:40.480]  Michael was all about getting the genetics out and giving people stuff to work with some elite shit some stuff that no one's got
[18:41.040 --> 18:44.880]  And so, you know when she when she releases these seeds, they're going to the market
[18:44.960 --> 18:47.120]  They're they're for the people by the people
[18:47.680 --> 18:53.040]  And she's hoping that people really take it to the next level with with her work now and his work that was
[18:53.760 --> 18:55.520]  So, you know
[18:55.520 --> 19:02.800]  Community get behind her, you know, just give her love give her support and uh and help help this tragedy turn into something beautiful
[19:04.640 --> 19:06.320]  Fuck yeah, man
[19:06.320 --> 19:10.800]  Uh as far as any any any help that she might need i'll you know, I got her on
[19:11.520 --> 19:14.180]  You know letting everybody all the whole masonic demographic
[19:14.880 --> 19:16.880]  they will be very privy to
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.640]  uh, I I'm first time pronouncing it but modern genetics modern pi genetics like
[19:24.080 --> 19:26.180]  Epigenetics epigenetic modern epigenetics
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.080]  Modern epigenetics all masonic demographic. They're gonna know very much. Well what that is
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.620]  Thank you for carrying his name and his work on bro. So so deeply respectful
[19:40.340 --> 19:45.940]  Yeah, and i'll do it in the right way, you know, there's there's ways that I approach things and this is the way i'll do this
[19:45.940 --> 19:47.940]  Everything has its approach
[19:49.220 --> 19:51.220]  Nice nice and you know, I
[19:51.700 --> 19:54.820]  I needed to say that and thank you for accepting it and thank you guys
[19:54.820 --> 19:58.020]  You know for allowing me to air this shit out because you know, he was
[19:58.660 --> 20:04.820]  He was like my son for christ's sake he and I were geeking every sunday for a few months on on his work and and
[20:05.060 --> 20:08.740]  He's got a formula a nutrient system that is fast release
[20:09.060 --> 20:11.060]  for plant food
[20:11.060 --> 20:16.100]  It's a foliar and I took it and I fucked around with it in a compost pile to see how it would react
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.260]  And week three and four
[20:18.580 --> 20:22.900]  The growth of organisms outpaced the growth of my system
[20:23.460 --> 20:26.340]  So I know it works both biologically as well as foliar
[20:26.900 --> 20:31.380]  And I know that you know, this is getting closer and closer to full genetic potential
[20:31.380 --> 20:33.380]  Which you know was one of his dreams
[20:34.260 --> 20:40.840]  So that that that that product will roll out, you know, hopefully within a year hopefully less, um, there are some formulations
[20:41.460 --> 20:44.260]  Or he was working literally reformulating this shit
[20:44.660 --> 20:50.740]  You know the day and nights before this all went down and he finished it. He fucking finished it
[20:51.220 --> 20:57.380]  So i'm helping her get that into a chemist hands so that it can get dialed the fuck in
[20:57.700 --> 21:01.460]  Um and then put in a manner that it's easy to work with right now
[21:01.460 --> 21:04.820]  It's still you know a little bit tricky to measure out all this shit
[21:05.220 --> 21:08.260]  Um, so we're going to get it into like a part a b c
[21:08.900 --> 21:11.940]  Easy for the people to use they don't have to formulate the shit
[21:12.500 --> 21:15.460]  Um, so hopefully just keep your eyes out, you know when we roll this out
[21:15.620 --> 21:18.340]  I'm sure we'll we'll blast it out. Let everybody know all about it
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.980]  For sure, man. That's thank you
[21:21.460 --> 21:25.060]  Rest in peace. Michael hinden. Yeah, rest in peace brother, man rock on
[21:25.540 --> 21:31.140]  So anyway, uh, let's get back to the grind here. Um, so what is what is your future plans, bro?
[21:31.140 --> 21:35.620]  I mean, you're just gonna just keep rolling out. Uh, all this stuff as fast as you can produce it
[21:36.420 --> 21:39.860]  Uh, well like I was saying earlier I work lines
[21:39.860 --> 21:46.020]  I have males that i've backcrossed before but fucking I like to do everything absolutely everything
[21:46.660 --> 21:52.740]  Land races. Oh, you got that clone. Bring it boom here. Wilson bam got seeds of it
[21:53.140 --> 21:53.940]  Got seeds of it
[21:53.940 --> 22:00.900]  It's just literally do everything and and it just so happens in everything everything happens to follow in everything whether it be a land race
[22:01.300 --> 22:08.340]  Whether it be a washer whether it be a flower producer even the shitty ones, you know, like everything falls under that category
[22:08.420 --> 22:12.580]  so I kind of just hit every because I see people like what should I hit guys like
[22:12.900 --> 22:16.020]  I got these plants that are potential things I can hit just hit them all
[22:16.420 --> 22:19.540]  Fucking get knock that out figure it out. You know what I mean?
[22:19.540 --> 22:23.300]  But and and it used to be you know, uh, and it still is
[22:24.100 --> 22:26.740]  Uh, it's it's it's a matter of time and space
[22:26.820 --> 22:30.180]  Well, you know if you got the time in the space fucking do it. I got all the time
[22:30.500 --> 22:32.500]  I got as much space as I need
[22:32.820 --> 22:36.660]  Knock it out. You know what I mean? It used to be really really illegal to grow weed
[22:36.740 --> 22:40.420]  So it's harder to find cool shit because you can only grow in a basement or some shit
[22:40.660 --> 22:43.940]  And you you didn't want to compromise your basement just to make seed stock
[22:44.740 --> 22:46.740]  We're in a different time
[22:47.300 --> 22:50.740]  Nice and you know what you're actually doing which is a beautiful thing. Um
[22:51.300 --> 22:57.220]  been in a lot of groups and and discussions about patenting shit and you know, my my
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.500]  Philosophy has always been look if you guys are out pacing what they can fucking patent
[23:03.060 --> 23:08.500]  Then you don't have to worry about these genetic crosses because they can't blank and patent anything anymore
[23:08.980 --> 23:15.140]  And so your greatest security is to keep on fucking running and and blowing lines out as fast as you can
[23:15.460 --> 23:20.500]  And keep crossing them with each other because there's just there's no way they can keep up with the work that you're doing
[23:20.900 --> 23:23.860]  So, you know kudos to you for like really powering through
[23:24.340 --> 23:28.100]  You know the fear of of oh my god, they're gonna patent this plan and take it away from me
[23:28.340 --> 23:32.740]  They can't fucking keep up with you man. You're traveling at the speed of fucking light and it's beautiful, dude
[23:32.900 --> 23:38.260]  It's fucking beautiful and i'm actually doing the legwork like i'm actually planting the seed
[23:38.340 --> 23:41.700]  I'm actually seeing what the flower does as far as you know
[23:42.180 --> 23:45.220]  What I remember because i'm not out there with a journal I got you know
[23:45.460 --> 23:50.900]  This this is my method and and people forget that they they just see the memes. They see the ha ha has they see the live?
[23:50.980 --> 23:56.180]  They see me taking dabs. No, I get dirty. I get nasty like when my workers see me get in the trenches
[23:56.180 --> 24:01.140]  They're like, oh like get the fuck out of here. You sweaty nasty got weed all over you man, and they're like
[24:01.940 --> 24:02.820]  You know what? I mean?
[24:02.820 --> 24:08.020]  Not that they're office people but like they i'm barely teaching them how to get in the trenches, you know, and it's outdoor
[24:08.020 --> 24:15.780]  It's not a clean little indoor like there's bird shit everywhere. I got chickens everywhere, you know, it's fucking like it's it's a farm
[24:15.860 --> 24:20.340]  You know, it's fucking and and and I get down and dirty. I actually pop the seeds
[24:20.340 --> 24:23.540]  I just went through my whole seed collection, which is like
[24:24.180 --> 24:26.020]  freaking probably
[24:26.020 --> 24:32.500]  10 15 one gallon, you know bags full of seeds just stuffed in there and I managed to pick out like
[24:32.900 --> 24:36.740]  Well, it's like 20 actually and I got like five that I picked that I need to sort through those
[24:36.980 --> 24:40.420]  So I can go get dirty again and start popping shit and getting in the dirt
[24:42.020 --> 24:47.140]  Nice so are most of those like f1s that you're just playing with or no, it's everybody's gear
[24:47.220 --> 24:52.420]  It's all of exotics gear all the jungle boys gear some bode gear some shit that homeboy made, you know
[24:52.500 --> 24:56.740]  Some shit that you would made i'll throw it in there. I pop everything man. I like everything
[24:57.620 --> 25:00.820]  Nice and then do you feno hunt from there or you just keep doing it?
[25:00.820 --> 25:04.900]  Like like I you know, of course call the males and the coolest moms
[25:04.900 --> 25:08.100]  I do keep cuts of everything too. Like all my little you know
[25:08.100 --> 25:11.940]  I have a group of people that I work with it's not just me. I can't handle everything by myself
[25:12.260 --> 25:15.860]  I I keep as much as I can I go have my homies come and
[25:17.300 --> 25:21.780]  Take cuts of all the females. They all have everything i've grown most of it is
[25:21.860 --> 25:27.700]  Available and it's just a matter of who you go talk to and get it but uh, so there's my selection, you know
[25:27.700 --> 25:33.140]  Like I I do select as far as that's concerned and then I grow it and then people can figure it out from there
[25:33.140 --> 25:36.100]  You know and and I don't like if it's a runty flower
[25:36.660 --> 25:40.180]  Like that shit does not go out to the people like that's that's trash, you know
[25:40.260 --> 25:45.140]  Or if it's like just mids like i'm gonna tell you like hey guys like you're about to buy
[25:45.620 --> 25:49.780]  Malawi panama red f2 times wilson like do not buy it
[25:49.780 --> 25:57.620]  Red f2 times wilson like do not expect a wilson dominant plant. You're gonna get a lot of land racy traits, which is what?
[25:58.660 --> 26:02.420]  You know a newcomer per se maybe like maysonic is selling me mids
[26:02.500 --> 26:07.060]  No, dude, you bought a land race straight strain, which is not mids to some people like
[26:07.620 --> 26:13.540]  A more esteemed grower like they'd appreciate it for it being a land race, but it's just all how you look at things
[26:13.620 --> 26:18.980]  That's a great point dude, uh, I think that a lot of times people want to jump on shit and throw stones
[26:18.980 --> 26:25.220]  Like you said instead of taking that and saying hey, you know what if I cross this with other plants, you know
[26:25.220 --> 26:30.980]  Maybe that land race is going to pull something out of uh, another cultivar that that's unexpected
[26:31.380 --> 26:37.140]  So, you know, that's the magic of what you're doing. And and you know, I love your fucking shotgun approach, bro. It's beautiful
[26:37.540 --> 26:43.380]  Yeah, i've freaking grown russian auto land races I get I get the weirdest seeds I can find man if the weirder they sound
[26:43.540 --> 26:49.860]  I'm, like bring it and also the hype too. Hey, why is it hype? Oh, that's why it's hype. It's actually really good
[26:50.500 --> 26:55.300]  Oh, that's why people aren't growing land races anymore, but I still appreciate it. You know what I mean?
[26:57.140 --> 27:05.180]  What's the stuff that's really sticking out for you, uh, especially for 2020 that you've been working on uh besides, you know
[27:05.180 --> 27:07.740]  Your wilson that you you feel like is going to be
[27:08.300 --> 27:12.940]  Something that people are going to hype up wear t-shirts. I'll tell you what i'm stoked on
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.760]  Like i'm stoked on popping these mac v2s
[27:16.540 --> 27:23.260]  I'm stoked on popping these uh, the chem cookies the where people found gmo at like this is what i'm stoked on right now
[27:23.260 --> 27:28.380]  I'm stoked on popping these and and finding something cool in that to hit to wilson like that's that's
[27:28.940 --> 27:31.340]  Like those two things off the top like that's what i'm stoked on
[27:31.340 --> 27:35.500]  And that says a lot about me because I don't get to I have a lot of things I can work with but those two
[27:35.500 --> 27:38.380]  Things got mac v2. I know what i'm gonna get in mac
[27:38.380 --> 27:41.580]  I'm gonna get mac, you know, but it's cool to find that in seed form
[27:41.900 --> 27:46.300]  You can only find that in cut but now they have it in seed form and then they got uh,
[27:46.940 --> 27:52.060]  I'm, find me some gmo. You know what I mean? Hopefully fingers crossed a quicker finisher or something
[27:53.980 --> 27:59.200]  Yeah, you never know what you're gonna get that's yeah life's not always easy
[27:59.920 --> 28:07.520]  Yeah, you never know what you're gonna get that's yeah life's a box of chocolates man, yeah, it could be dog shit looking at
[28:12.320 --> 28:14.640]  Oh, dude, I love that you get your hands dirty man
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.640]  I love playing in the dirt and the compost and and you know playing with the biology
[28:18.720 --> 28:24.320]  so it's just it's nice to be refreshing to hear other people that are you know get into the chicken shit and the fucking shit
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.120]  And all that stuff and you know not afraid to roll up your sleeves and play with the mud man beautiful
[28:30.240 --> 28:32.240]  straight up
[28:32.880 --> 28:34.880]  Urban fucking warrior
[28:36.400 --> 28:38.240]  Fuck it
[28:38.240 --> 28:40.240]  So how many chickens you got brother?
[28:40.400 --> 28:42.080]  All right. Uh
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.360]  There's the original seven. They had six one dive this morning
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.320]  Uh, so was that 12 and then I got two other ones. So that's 14. I think I did the math, right?
[28:55.280 --> 28:58.880]  So you're using the chicken shit as fertilizer or you just collect yeah
[29:00.080 --> 29:05.520]  All the dookie I throw it into uh, my spent soil and just let it do its thing in there. Nice
[29:06.240 --> 29:07.280]  Nice
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.000]  Well, i'll have to come down i'm up in oxnard one of these days
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.040]  I'll have to blast down there and see what your operation looks like and uh, yeah playing the mug with you a little bit
[29:15.600 --> 29:17.600]  Yeah, man, let's let's get dirty
[29:17.600 --> 29:19.600]  I'm
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  I thought you were playing around with red buds
[29:24.400 --> 29:26.400]  So yeah, I met that joe
[29:27.120 --> 29:28.640]  When I saw you at the expo
[29:28.640 --> 29:29.680]  Shout out red bud, man
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.600]  He he sent me a pallet all the way here to compton to my front steps, man
[29:33.680 --> 29:37.840]  That that dude's a g I I use this cover crop. I use I use uh,
[29:37.920 --> 29:42.320]  I just I have some of his oriental herb nutrients that i'm about to start pumping out onto these plants
[29:42.720 --> 29:44.720]  I fucks with all that man
[29:45.200 --> 29:46.960]  Right on man. Yeah
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.040]  You seem like a pretty good dude, man
[29:50.160 --> 29:54.880]  Yeah, i'd love to i'd love to hear more about this, uh cat soil what is it is it a super soil
[29:56.080 --> 29:58.960]  It's a living soil and it's a bag living soil
[29:59.680 --> 30:02.320]  That's kind of hard to do. I mean i've been playing with this shit for years
[30:04.400 --> 30:06.400]  When you open it up, does it smell like the forest
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.520]  it's very uh
[30:09.680 --> 30:15.060]  Uh, it's it's it's hard to wet. You know what I mean? It's hard to get it wet. It's hydrophobic
[30:15.220 --> 30:19.300]  Yeah, it's hydrophobic so he's he sounds like what he's done is a um,
[30:20.180 --> 30:26.020]  Uh kind of a suspended, uh animation to the organism so that basically he's put him in cyst form
[30:26.420 --> 30:34.020]  So as things hydrate they're released. Um, you know, one of the things I make is a uh living inoculant and that's what I have to do
[30:34.100 --> 30:37.620]  Because if you try to ship that shit or put it on a shelf
[30:38.100 --> 30:43.240]  Uh, what happens is uh, the organisms start consuming all the oxygen and the next thing you know goes anaerobic
[30:43.800 --> 30:47.640]  So, uh, yeah i'ma i'ma chase that boy around see what he's actually doing because
[30:48.120 --> 30:52.680]  um, that's that is the future is is having you know, these living soils that are
[30:53.480 --> 30:58.760]  shelf stable, um, and then once you do finally get the wetting to occur
[30:59.240 --> 31:01.400]  Uh, they come to life and and do their work man
[31:02.200 --> 31:08.120]  Yeah, and and that's cool that I can just like like that kind of makes it true that that's what I got
[31:08.200 --> 31:12.600]  It different from everything like that. There was rice hole very very little rice hole in there
[31:12.840 --> 31:16.600]  But like it was kind of hard to get this wet like it almost got muddy at one point
[31:16.680 --> 31:21.320]  But once it got wet like it was good to go and and everything that grew in it
[31:21.880 --> 31:28.760]  Like needed minimal input compared to its counterparts that were in roots organics that needed like, uh,
[31:29.320 --> 31:33.800]  You know, they needed more tlc per se those kind of had a better jump start
[31:34.440 --> 31:39.640]  Yeah, yeah, the boy's definitely doing some good work for sure and I can't wait to dive down that hole with him and see what
[31:39.960 --> 31:41.400]  He's all about
[31:41.400 --> 31:43.880]  Straight up shout out red blood soil. Yeah, right
[31:45.560 --> 31:50.940]  So, uh, what is your favorite, uh smoke brother, I mean, what what's your what's your pleasure you got multiples
[31:51.800 --> 31:55.800]  Oh, i'ma, i'ma i'ma hash dude, man. I'm a hash snob man. I don't know
[31:57.800 --> 32:00.840]  Look wait right here. Wait, right? All right. All right, bring it on bro
[32:04.870 --> 32:06.870]  I love the fucking cats in the background
[32:07.670 --> 32:10.710]  I love this. This is all the stuff that I didn't like
[32:12.390 --> 32:15.270]  I don't I didn't like any of this stuff. Not that I didn't like it
[32:15.430 --> 32:20.870]  But like this stuff is like a month or two three months old. They're all full of hash
[32:21.430 --> 32:24.230]  And and if I don't like it, I don't smoke it. It's that simple
[32:27.030 --> 32:29.030]  So that's the rejected pile
[32:30.770 --> 32:34.250]  Disregard all the hash companies in here, but I didn't like this shit
[32:39.160 --> 32:41.160]  Oh, that's funny, dude
[32:43.880 --> 32:47.320]  The hash company is fine, it's whatever they fucking put in there
[32:52.680 --> 32:57.480]  So are you making your own smokes your your own hash is that is that your favorite
[32:58.280 --> 33:02.920]  Yeah, I like to make my own hash like uh, but the thing is I like to make my own seed even more
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.560]  So it's not like what am I gonna do?
[33:06.120 --> 33:11.400]  I usually make seeds because it makes more sense in in every way, you know
[33:11.960 --> 33:15.000]  Uh as opposed to hash like I can get hash
[33:15.560 --> 33:20.200]  Anyway, and it's like how much hash do you need? Okay. Now you're stuck with all this hash. I don't sell hash
[33:20.200 --> 33:23.240]  I don't sell weed on do none of it's it's a waste of my time. So
[33:24.200 --> 33:28.280]  I'm not gonna make a big amount for myself either. I'd rather go, you know, make some seeds
[33:28.360 --> 33:30.920]  I like to make seed that shit's fucking dope. It's fun to me
[33:31.560 --> 33:35.560]  And I agree with you it's nice to mix up your smoke, you know, not not just stay on one cultivar
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.640]  But you know get some blends and and that way I never never have a tolerance issue
[33:40.200 --> 33:43.540]  Even if it is like the pheno hunt blend like you're stuck with that blend
[33:50.200 --> 33:52.200]  Fuckin beautiful dude beautiful
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.520]  So, uh, tell us some more about what it's like down there during the corona man. Has it been fucked up or
[33:58.520 --> 34:04.580]  Fucked up or it's more lax now. It's more lax. You still got to wear your mask in the stores
[34:07.320 --> 34:09.880]  It's it's more lax though like like the
[34:10.560 --> 34:17.900]  The the grocery stores like Target Walmart any big chain like that like you you would have to like like when it first started
[34:17.920 --> 34:23.900]  Well, like let me give you the story of Corona for starters Corona was hitting the news and and people were like, yeah
[34:23.900 --> 34:26.940]  Yeah, whatever Corona. I still got to make it to Barcelona
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.580]  My wife's like don't go to Barcelona stupid. You're gonna get stuck over there. You're gonna get stuck
[34:31.580 --> 34:37.700]  I'm like nah, nah Corona man Corona smarona and fucking I fucking fly out to Barcelona
[34:38.220 --> 34:39.300]  I
[34:39.300 --> 34:44.740]  Stay there for like 24 hours and then it's the next day and then we're at a martini bar in the middle of night
[34:44.740 --> 34:47.640]  And I don't know what fucking time it is in the States
[34:47.640 --> 34:51.940]  But my wife hits me up and she's all no no my buddy poetry of plants hits me up
[34:51.940 --> 34:55.180]  And he's like hey Edgar get the fuck out of Barcelona
[34:55.700 --> 34:59.540]  Trump's about to close the borders. I'm like what the fuck and I call my wife on my baby
[35:03.060 --> 35:05.340]  And then like somehow some way dude
[35:05.740 --> 35:11.100]  Her buddy that I never like not that I never want her on the phone with but her buddy that she's always on the phone
[35:11.100 --> 35:15.540]  With and I'm like get off the phone with her. You're always on the phone with her. She found me a ticket
[35:15.740 --> 35:20.460]  So fucking shout out her that she's like, so go ahead talk to her all you want
[35:21.460 --> 35:22.660]  For
[35:22.660 --> 35:24.620]  $900 to escape Barcelona
[35:24.620 --> 35:28.500]  I was the first person at the fucking airport in Barcelona or one of the first
[35:28.620 --> 35:31.780]  As soon as I get there people just start coming in to stooge stooge
[35:31.780 --> 35:36.340]  All my friends are like you're crazy. You're crazy. You're like it's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fine
[35:36.500 --> 35:38.900]  They try to come like the next day
[35:38.900 --> 35:39.220]  No
[35:39.220 --> 35:45.280]  They had to wait till the day that they were scheduled to leave if they were even able to leave that day
[35:45.280 --> 35:49.220]  So I was like, haha motherfuckers like I'm over here overreacting now
[35:49.220 --> 35:55.060]  I'm the only motherfucker that made it home. So I make it home and sure enough. I make it home. I got my wife and
[35:56.180 --> 35:58.180]  She's like pregnant is fun
[35:59.860 --> 36:05.460]  Freaking I managed to make it to the stores and be crazy with everybody else during the panic and you know
[36:05.460 --> 36:08.300]  Rack up on you know, whatever we need not too crazy
[36:08.300 --> 36:09.860]  I wasn't that crazy, but I'm you know
[36:09.860 --> 36:10.700]  I you know
[36:10.700 --> 36:15.340]  You got to be a little bit crazy with them and get your piece just enough because or else we would have been
[36:15.540 --> 36:17.940]  Toilet paperless waterless, etc
[36:17.940 --> 36:24.100]  So we got our whatever we needed worth and I made it back right on time when they hit so it was crazy when it
[36:24.100 --> 36:28.100]  Hit and then shit started chilling out. We're stuck at home. I thought I had the fucking Corona
[36:28.100 --> 36:32.740]  I probably did but I didn't sleep for like 24 hours and I smelt like dog shit
[36:32.740 --> 36:34.900]  Like when my wife picked me up from LAX
[36:34.900 --> 36:39.360]  I smelt terrible because I was on the plane for like 18 hours or some shit
[36:39.360 --> 36:45.020]  I forgot plus not sleeping plus being scared sweating running through the airport and shit sleeping at the airport
[36:45.020 --> 36:47.020]  All types of shit. So
[36:47.180 --> 36:52.300]  Corona was crazy at first now it's lax like you can go to the store on weekends
[36:52.300 --> 36:55.620]  Sometimes you still got to wait in the line to get into like Best Buy and stuff
[36:55.620 --> 37:01.500]  But it totally fucked up everything honestly, like we can't just go to a restaurant now. You got to sit outside
[37:01.500 --> 37:06.340]  You got to make a reservation like like we live in a weird fucking time, man
[37:07.420 --> 37:14.260]  Yeah, and it's especially prevalent in the cities the urban guys. You guys had a much tougher time with us
[37:14.980 --> 37:22.700]  You know, I'm up I'm up in kind of suburbia. So it wasn't it wasn't as crazy here. They never really shut the beaches down
[37:22.700 --> 37:25.980]  Yeah, we ran out of toilet paper water paper towels all that shit
[37:26.660 --> 37:32.280]  But fortunately we had like you, you know enough to get through it until until the shit came back on the market
[37:32.940 --> 37:34.380]  Yeah, I was a similar situation
[37:34.380 --> 37:41.620]  I mean my babe Pauline and I left, New Mexico to move out here to Oxnard and we literally got here
[37:41.820 --> 37:45.900]  Fucking two days later man, everything shut down and it got really fucking weird and
[37:46.900 --> 37:51.260]  You know, we were just trying to like figure out like what is all this shit going on man?
[37:51.580 --> 37:55.780]  So yeah, I'm glad you were safe through all that because it definitely got fucked up
[37:56.380 --> 37:58.380]  in a big way
[37:58.660 --> 38:02.900]  Yeah, and then my son has to you know, fucking no more school dog
[38:02.900 --> 38:08.940]  Like you gotta you're stuck on the computer dog. You need to wear pants. No more. You could wear underwear all day. Fuck it
[38:12.580 --> 38:14.580]  Me too, I need wearing pants right now
[38:17.300 --> 38:22.500]  So did you keep did you keep breeding and growing through all this or did you hunker down into the house I
[38:23.260 --> 38:28.300]  Stepped it up 20 notches. You know how everybody started getting livestock making their own chickens and shit
[38:28.300 --> 38:32.060]  Well, I freaking I had a vegetable garden. I had everything man
[38:32.060 --> 38:38.420]  I might well at least I was you know, putting stuff in the ground. I built four more beds. I only have one I
[38:39.220 --> 38:41.220]  Really stepped it up
[38:41.620 --> 38:45.100]  Nice, so you took advantage of the time. That's that's fucking awesome, bro
[38:45.140 --> 38:51.840]  Yeah, I grew up a lot during this pandemic like I had like like, you know the joke from South Park
[38:51.840 --> 38:56.940]  I don't know if you guys watched it, but he had the pandemic special. Well, I had a pandemic special too when it dropped
[39:00.300 --> 39:03.540]  Yeah, I feel the same way man I got to play with did you see the quick
[39:05.060 --> 39:09.700]  Go ahead Peter. Did you see the question about the shop kind of an update on?
[39:10.300 --> 39:12.300]  Is it open when's it opening?
[39:13.340 --> 39:15.340]  What are you carrying?
[39:15.380 --> 39:17.980]  Give or take I'm selling merchandise 60 days
[39:17.980 --> 39:24.300]  So designer t-shirts like I really went to like a private designer that does like celebrity clothing
[39:24.300 --> 39:27.380]  They only have one store on Sunset Boulevard. Like I'm making some
[39:28.020 --> 39:33.660]  Fucking dope shit. That'll make you feel like like people already buy these t-shirts for a good penny
[39:33.660 --> 39:36.020]  Well now I'm gonna make it worth that shit
[39:36.020 --> 39:40.220]  Like people really invested in it to get it to where they can rock it and be like fuck
[39:40.220 --> 39:42.220]  Yeah, this is like a real brand now, you know
[39:43.900 --> 39:45.540]  Are you selling
[39:45.540 --> 39:47.540]  cannabis related products to or just
[39:47.940 --> 39:49.940]  Gear just gear
[39:50.340 --> 39:51.660]  nice
[39:51.660 --> 39:56.740]  We're gonna I'm aiming for you know, Fairfax vibes. I'm aiming for supreme vibes
[39:56.740 --> 40:02.580]  I'm aiming for people lining up to go by the t-shirt and the art on it because I got an eye for art too
[40:02.580 --> 40:06.060]  Like I'm I like seeds too, but I'm very artsy as well
[40:08.100 --> 40:12.740]  Did you ever have fish as a kid maybe maybe
[40:15.420 --> 40:20.740]  It's just funny man a lot of artsy cannabis related people had fished when they were growing up
[40:20.740 --> 40:24.260]  So I always like to ask that question like fish my son has fish I have
[40:26.580 --> 40:29.220]  I knew it dude. I fucking knew it. Yeah
[40:29.340 --> 40:33.860]  So Brian you've been awful quiet back there brother I got muted
[40:38.380 --> 40:40.380]  Yeah for the echo
[40:40.860 --> 40:44.700]  Yeah, we have we're still working on that audio man, but we bought everything
[40:45.220 --> 40:48.860]  So we'll be able to fix up the studio with the foam and all that kind of stuff
[40:48.860 --> 40:52.820]  But I've enjoyed the conversation. I know that a lot of the viewers
[40:53.540 --> 40:56.420]  Edgar they really want to learn more about your breeding process
[40:56.420 --> 41:00.500]  You know you do your own thing you're more of a you know, you don't write anything down
[41:00.500 --> 41:03.700]  It's just moving along and it seems like that's what works for you
[41:04.740 --> 41:08.580]  It seems like almost in everything everything in your life. I'm sure you didn't really have a plan for Instagram
[41:08.580 --> 41:12.980]  It just seems like you put stuff together. You're putting out content and now you put together a
[41:13.500 --> 41:16.820]  Seat company for yourself and you have a you know to me
[41:16.820 --> 41:21.700]  I've always said you know that you're on to something especially when I saw the Jumbo Boys when people going out of their way to
[41:21.700 --> 41:23.700]  Buy the t-shirts buy the merch
[41:23.980 --> 41:29.340]  To rep that brand because it meant something to the consumer and now I see that for you man
[41:29.620 --> 41:33.540]  People buying the t-shirts people wanting to be representing your your brand
[41:33.740 --> 41:38.700]  Which is pretty cool and hats off to you man for being able to build that in two three years
[41:38.900 --> 41:45.300]  Yeah, man freakin. I just love the weed and the weed loves me apparently fuck it. Let's do it
[41:47.180 --> 41:49.180]  And as far as breeding you want to know what I'm talking about
[41:49.700 --> 41:56.860]  And as far as breeding you want to talk about breeding I like to find like a last run was a
[41:57.780 --> 42:02.540]  F2 Wilson now that I found and he's fucking huge everybody's seen pictures of them
[42:02.540 --> 42:04.140]  And I have him in
[42:04.140 --> 42:09.340]  Veggie form I have them in clone form so I can go make a real back cross so everybody can be like oh
[42:09.340 --> 42:13.900]  He's serious now, so that's what I'm doing now. Just so everybody knows. What's my approach?
[42:13.900 --> 42:17.340]  My approach is to make a real back cross not a
[42:17.940 --> 42:24.100]  In-cross or whatever the fuck you call it when it's crossed to a whole different parent from like the same generation etc, but uh
[42:25.180 --> 42:31.700]  I'm gonna go make a real in cross from a male that I selected and cross it back to the f1 stock and
[42:32.340 --> 42:35.420]  Should I'll go as far as you know I got more time now
[42:35.420 --> 42:39.580]  And and and you know you grow up, and you learn things and I watched a couple
[42:40.100 --> 42:46.260]  Breeding things like you think you know everything till you go back, and you dive in the books, and you're like I'm a fucking asshole man
[42:46.260 --> 42:50.540]  I'm over here thinking I know everything you know what you know and you fucking only know that
[42:50.620 --> 42:55.380]  So I went back and I went back to like I like I watched some mean gene videos
[42:55.380 --> 42:57.940]  And I was like fuck I'm an asshole like I never
[42:58.300 --> 43:02.420]  Put it in perspective like that like when he's talking about how the red leaves
[43:02.780 --> 43:06.460]  Anything that had a red leaf had a sweeter nose and anything that was greener
[43:07.100 --> 43:13.260]  Green was more pungent like I never I'm just like fuck it. You know grow it. Oh, that's cool nice
[43:13.260 --> 43:20.020]  That smells like oranges make it across or you know that's for everything, but uh I will go in and and freakin
[43:20.540 --> 43:26.160]  You know give it my best shot. There's a lot of time, and I'm 28 man. I got 100 years ahead of me
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.940]  I'll make a I'm making a back cross. I've done it f2. I've done it f3
[43:31.340 --> 43:35.940]  Freakin and like I said man. You're damned if you do you're damned if you don't do a little bit of everything
[43:39.700 --> 43:43.380]  So what's your eye on when you're making your male selections?
[43:45.980 --> 43:47.700]  You know
[43:47.700 --> 43:50.780]  Big I like big big is always better with the males
[43:50.780 --> 43:54.980]  I like the stem rum whoever has this close to stem rope any runs get thrown out
[43:56.740 --> 44:01.340]  Whoever stacks more as far as males are concerned and even as far as a
[44:02.180 --> 44:03.340]  freakin
[44:03.340 --> 44:07.020]  How they're how early they show pollen sacks and shit like that so I
[44:07.580 --> 44:15.140]  Like to choose big shit big males stinkier mouths usually they show they choose you they're like hey, I'm right here fool
[44:15.140 --> 44:17.140]  What are you doing like it came with me?
[44:17.380 --> 44:19.380]  Just to be on some spiritual shit
[44:20.980 --> 44:25.860]  Yeah, I love it you're focused on the intuition that's beautiful brother as beautiful
[44:26.460 --> 44:32.900]  Do you look at the thickness of the stock when it hits the root ball too is that is that important for a structure?
[44:33.340 --> 44:37.140]  I'd be lying if I said anything like that. I'd be lying. I'd be lying
[44:37.780 --> 44:40.520]  Yeah, it's one of those things that you know I've picked up
[44:41.500 --> 44:49.220]  some of these guys really like to look at you know the structural support of the plant and the root ball to determine you know
[44:49.220 --> 44:51.220]  Hey, this is going to be a fast eater
[44:51.860 --> 44:53.860]  And support a heavy canopy
[44:53.900 --> 45:00.220]  You know you know some of those plants that just kind of start bending over when they get stacked and so that's why I asked
[45:00.220 --> 45:01.980]  I'm a structural guy
[45:01.980 --> 45:04.420]  That's new to me. That's that's gangster, man
[45:04.420 --> 45:11.220]  I never put that in perspective a fat root ball can keep up a plant better. That's dope man. I'll keep my eye out for that
[45:11.940 --> 45:13.940]  yeah, and it also provides a
[45:14.420 --> 45:19.980]  more surface area to harvest nutrients so that you know that root ball is an indication of
[45:20.180 --> 45:23.720]  The potential that it could could make up over time
[45:24.500 --> 45:28.740]  No, no, no, man. Thanks for that tip. Yeah. Yeah, all good, bro
[45:29.700 --> 45:31.700]  Glad I could drop something on you
[45:32.900 --> 45:38.100]  We only know what we know gee I'm freaking I just know how to make freaking a bunch of seeds
[45:39.780 --> 45:44.300]  Yeah, it's great that you brought up mean gene, man. I'm dying to rap with that boy
[45:44.300 --> 45:49.140]  I mean he's been he's done some like huge pheno huts up in humble
[45:50.100 --> 45:57.740]  You know and I've always wondered like how far did he actually go you know chasing chasing these plants to find proper
[45:58.500 --> 46:04.340]  Mating partners and so hopefully some point we'll get him on the show and we can we can deep dive down about you know
[46:04.340 --> 46:09.260]  How big of a sift that he was actually working on or has been working on you know cool shit?
[46:09.260 --> 46:14.300]  I I think he he were trying to lock in something I
[46:15.180 --> 46:17.900]  think either Friday or Saturday night, but uh
[46:19.500 --> 46:23.580]  Nice nice yeah, he's a great cat met him a couple times
[46:24.580 --> 46:28.540]  Just a real honest, you know good soul so great vibe to him
[46:30.380 --> 46:34.300]  Yeah mean jeans dope man, he's a triple OG quadruple OG
[46:35.860 --> 46:37.860]  Amen amen
[46:41.460 --> 46:46.520]  Just I just want to pack a black lime reserve in an auction for 1,500 man
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.300]  I'm about to cross that bitch to listen. Let's do it, baby
[46:53.580 --> 46:58.460]  That was well that was gonna be one of my next questions what what's exciting you and it sounds like
[46:59.060 --> 47:05.220]  I just won that BLR, and I think they're they're gonna send me some chem 91 Williams wonder
[47:05.220 --> 47:10.680]  I know all you food love that type of shit, and I love it too. I fucking cam heavy, so I'm fucking
[47:10.680 --> 47:12.560]  I'm stoked for those beans, too
[47:12.560 --> 47:13.820]  There's only so much shit
[47:13.820 --> 47:19.100]  I'm stoked on and it's those three things that I've named so far in the thing is the Mac V to
[47:19.580 --> 47:23.860]  The the GMO where GMO was found which is chem cookies and
[47:24.380 --> 47:30.100]  And and the shit that I'm waiting for the BLR and that Williams wonder stuff, which is for you
[47:32.380 --> 47:34.740]  Do you see that already working on my gear I
[47:35.260 --> 47:36.580]  Already worked karma gear
[47:36.580 --> 47:37.940]  I actually
[47:37.940 --> 47:45.140]  Was one of the people that went to Spain and met up with karma to get that seed stock for the United States for the
[47:45.140 --> 47:49.340]  Speakeasy drop I was one of the people that went there to grab that seed stock
[47:49.460 --> 47:54.940]  You know physical seed stock for the people so you know if you guys want some background
[47:54.940 --> 47:58.040]  You know behind the scene shit. That's some shit that you know
[47:58.620 --> 48:00.620]  You know we went out of our way to do
[48:02.100 --> 48:06.380]  So you got some family over there in Spain, or you know what's I'm connect
[48:06.540 --> 48:11.940]  I'm just I just freakin I got people that like Masonic seeds in Spain
[48:11.940 --> 48:16.060]  So I gave it my best shot and actually went to Spain in
[48:17.740 --> 48:20.060]  2018 or 2019 when did I first go to Spain?
[48:20.060 --> 48:21.060]  I don't know
[48:21.060 --> 48:25.220]  But I've been to Spain like prior to and I was like working at right age still and my boss is like what do you?
[48:25.220 --> 48:30.420]  Mean you're going to Spain and then freaking like three weeks later. I'm like I need to go to Spain again
[48:30.460 --> 48:35.140]  He's like what the fuck you work at righty dude like how are you going to Spain so much?
[48:35.140 --> 48:37.740]  I don't know man. I just I sell t-shirts
[48:38.900 --> 48:40.900]  Freaking next to you know like I got a good
[48:42.340 --> 48:46.740]  Like I speak Spanish too, but I'm Mexican so I can like you know they I
[48:47.620 --> 48:51.620]  Know a lot of cafe owners and stuff in Spain. I've been to Spanabus
[48:52.540 --> 48:54.540]  before freakin
[48:54.540 --> 48:59.860]  Like Spain fucks with Masonic. That's pretty much the name South Africa fucks with Masonic, too
[48:59.900 --> 49:04.940]  Like there's like some pockets of people that really fuck with the seeds heavy because I you know
[49:05.260 --> 49:07.260]  Went out of my way to say what's up to them?
[49:07.420 --> 49:11.660]  Who would you like to work with that you haven't worked with yet shit
[49:13.260 --> 49:16.340]  Well you know I'm I do all the force collapse so I've
[49:17.220 --> 49:19.820]  In essence worked with a lot of people's gear
[49:20.340 --> 49:24.020]  But like actually work with somebody work work with somebody
[49:24.780 --> 49:26.780]  shit, man
[49:26.820 --> 49:31.660]  Who do I think is like the fucking the seed guy who's the seed guy to me?
[49:32.540 --> 49:34.540]  shit, man
[49:34.540 --> 49:39.820]  It'd probably be you know mean gene he he he talks a big lot and not like in the bad way
[49:39.820 --> 49:45.420]  But like I look at him like he's the guy you probably want to go talk to so it'd probably be that motherfucker
[49:47.740 --> 49:49.740]  Oh, yeah
[49:50.860 --> 49:55.540]  So tell us a little bit about South Africa, well, how did you end up landing there, man?
[49:55.540 --> 50:00.540]  I didn't land there my seeds made it there, and they fucking love South Africa, man
[50:00.540 --> 50:03.140]  Like coming up in the scene. I was like fuck it
[50:03.140 --> 50:08.060]  I just sent like a lot of seeds over there for free and I sent them to the right guy
[50:08.220 --> 50:13.300]  Because he gave them all out for free so like a hundred people ended up with seeds in South Africa
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.300]  for free
[50:15.300 --> 50:17.300]  Which is fucking dope you know that's like?
[50:18.020 --> 50:23.660]  It was good. I didn't I did it on a whim. I was like here dude like whatever here are these seeds
[50:23.660 --> 50:29.660]  He's like Masonic. I'm gonna. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
[50:29.780 --> 50:35.820]  I'm gonna put your name out there. I'm gonna and fucking next you know freaking I have a freaking mural of
[50:36.940 --> 50:44.020]  Cape Town South Africa in my son's room they sent me a pipe they sent me aloe vera seeds. They sent me all types of shit
[50:44.020 --> 50:46.020]  It's beautiful
[50:47.380 --> 50:54.820]  Like you're starting to make a name for yourself on is trading your seats for it seemed like practically almost anything man comic books
[50:55.140 --> 50:56.980]  glass pipes
[50:56.980 --> 50:58.980]  Kind of
[50:58.980 --> 51:03.900]  All day, baby some people don't have money man some people don't want to spend money
[51:03.980 --> 51:10.500]  But some people got a lot of extra shit that you might want that they don't want and and dude is that is that?
[51:10.500 --> 51:12.500]  How you got a bunch of shit?
[51:16.860 --> 51:21.100]  Did you see the question the story of how you name Wilson oh
[51:21.860 --> 51:23.860]  Oh
[51:24.060 --> 51:28.020]  They're asking me how did I name Wilson yeah, I didn't name Wilson
[51:30.100 --> 51:34.660]  Only name Wilson it's a play on castaway castaway is banana og papaya
[51:34.860 --> 51:41.620]  So he just played on that term which is like if you smoke castaway before like that's banana og papaya so
[51:42.180 --> 51:47.580]  Castaway times Tropicana f2 is just a play on the word still so it turned into Wilson
[51:47.580 --> 51:51.220]  Nice yeah, he ran with that at the endo expo
[51:51.220 --> 51:57.020]  He had a buddy of yours or somebody is walking around with Wilson with the red hand and everything
[51:57.540 --> 52:04.100]  So well people I had my buddy put on a Wilson inflatable ball and walk around and get free seat
[52:04.860 --> 52:07.900]  And then I had people paint their face like Wilson
[52:12.580 --> 52:14.580]  Nice nice
[52:14.980 --> 52:20.860]  Nice all right, I got I got a wild one off the cuff you feed your chickens any of your seeds
[52:22.300 --> 52:24.300]  They eat everything man
[52:25.660 --> 52:31.520]  Dude the birds man this season the birds got me hard my wife's like oh look at the cute birds outside
[52:31.540 --> 52:37.180]  I'm all like that's why my fucking seeds are I'm over here thinking like I have a like a rat
[52:37.540 --> 52:42.180]  Infestation like I'm scared like I'm like oh, that's nasty like there's a rat out here
[52:42.220 --> 52:49.780]  No these birds are going to town on the fucking nugs in the air like leaving them like like a whole nug like just
[52:50.420 --> 52:55.660]  Bear like all you see is like the seed pocket where it should have been at fucking birds man
[52:55.660 --> 52:58.820]  They suck and they're like orange chested birds. They're like some smart birds
[52:58.900 --> 53:02.300]  They're not like any given bird and there's a bunch of them
[53:02.300 --> 53:05.060]  They now there's no more shit because I already harvested everything
[53:05.260 --> 53:11.960]  But when this whole fucking place was full those motherfuckers were going to town on specific plants too like there's some
[53:12.180 --> 53:16.100]  Plants that they couldn't stand like the ones that were more healthy I'd imagine
[53:17.580 --> 53:21.380]  Well you never know hey, they may be spreading those seeds all over the place dude
[53:27.620 --> 53:32.280]  Volunteer rogue fucking Wilson's I'm sorry ahead of time everybody
[53:35.580 --> 53:39.220]  Hey one your fault the birds are the ones that did the work man fucking birds
[53:39.220 --> 53:42.580]  Be interesting to find out what type they were I'll find out
[53:44.580 --> 53:46.580]  People are trying to help you out oh
[53:48.180 --> 53:52.420]  Dude, that's thank you, and you know you're it's funny
[53:52.420 --> 53:55.060]  You say that because I went to go visit acre farm
[53:55.060 --> 54:01.300]  And I'm like why what's up with all this fucking party tape like on top of the hoops you know on the one acre farm
[54:01.300 --> 54:06.660]  So thank you, man. I figured it had to do something with keeping past away my G. Thank you very much
[54:06.660 --> 54:11.300]  Thank you very much, but you you solidified it for me. Thank you so much. I appreciate you
[54:13.940 --> 54:19.100]  Yeah, someone said we're gonna shit Compton land-raised seeds all over LA
[54:20.620 --> 54:22.620]  Hell yeah
[54:23.180 --> 54:28.580]  That's the way it used to work till we got all fucking crazy right wild hemp was everywhere
[54:29.180 --> 54:34.660]  So so what what's the relationship with jungle boys because you had posted a while back a bunch of?
[54:34.780 --> 54:37.260]  Jungle boys related stuff
[54:38.780 --> 54:45.660]  Yeah, man, we talked breeding man. I'm actually part of like some you know like breeding program that
[54:46.300 --> 54:50.100]  It's not like we don't sit down in a room or nothing
[54:50.100 --> 54:55.460]  But we do we do talk to each other about breeding and I don't know much like I don't know no root ball type
[54:55.460 --> 54:57.460]  But like I know what I know
[54:58.420 --> 55:00.420]  The root balls the stomach man
[55:03.780 --> 55:05.780]  I'm just I like I like
[55:13.300 --> 55:16.380]  Yeah, but yeah, man shout out I work with jungle boys I
[55:17.260 --> 55:21.060]  Work with people keep asking me that I work for no I work with jungle boys
[55:22.500 --> 55:24.500]  It's different
[55:24.820 --> 55:26.820]  It's different
[55:28.020 --> 55:30.020]  It's very different
[55:32.370 --> 55:34.530]  Thank You Sun grown I appreciate that
[55:38.350 --> 55:40.350]  So what is your work week like are you?
[55:40.630 --> 55:47.310]  You know chilling most of the time and in the shops or you you know homebody being you know dad and all that or
[55:49.310 --> 55:53.950]  Mondays is crunch day. I like to handle most of lingering things on Monday
[55:53.950 --> 55:57.910]  I have workers that do stuff for me like I have people that water for me
[55:58.510 --> 56:01.110]  People that handle all the logistics for me
[56:02.110 --> 56:03.190]  I
[56:03.190 --> 56:07.550]  Have a daughter. She's like four months, so I like to be with her most of the time
[56:09.670 --> 56:11.670]  Instagram is a whole job within itself
[56:12.470 --> 56:16.430]  Content is a whole job within itself. I used to do it for nothing now
[56:16.430 --> 56:21.350]  It's for a reason like every time I answer the hundred messages in my phone
[56:21.350 --> 56:22.510]  It'll take me like an hour
[56:22.510 --> 56:27.710]  Maybe maybe less to get all those mentions and everything going and that's every day so every day
[56:27.710 --> 56:32.710]  I have to fuck up my hands pretty much and and and it beats breaking rocks, though
[56:32.710 --> 56:35.790]  You know what I mean, so I'm very thankful for that job
[56:36.670 --> 56:37.950]  and
[56:37.950 --> 56:39.150]  just
[56:39.150 --> 56:43.270]  You know being creative man thinking of cool things to put on t-shirts
[56:43.270 --> 56:51.190]  You know hollering at people getting seeds, but that's not a work week. That's just what my job consists of but yeah, man freakin
[56:51.990 --> 56:57.590]  It's more of like arm leg head. You know I'm the head of the operation, but I can be
[56:57.750 --> 57:00.150]  the whole body sometimes if I really need to

[57:36.470 --> 57:41.230]  I'm not hating on you. I'm not disrespecting you. It's just it's tough to take that time
[57:41.750 --> 57:43.950]  to keep up with the pace of the shit, but
[57:44.550 --> 57:48.190]  You know hopefully some point. I'll get someone more techie than I am that can help me
[57:49.470 --> 57:52.390]  Hey, it takes a village to get that shit going man
[57:53.390 --> 57:59.270]  Got to find the right people I luckily have family members that work for me, so you know thank God for that
[58:05.410 --> 58:07.410]  So Brian
[58:08.330 --> 58:16.090]  You had mentioned Nelson before so can you poetry of plans so can you talk about kind of some of the people that
[58:17.250 --> 58:22.510]  like that you learn from or you collaborate with or talk shop with and kind of like
[58:23.270 --> 58:29.490]  Some lessons you know you said you're learning new things and kind of what are some of the more recent things you've learned
[58:31.630 --> 58:33.950]  Nelson's the man with the plan man Nelson
[58:33.950 --> 58:39.570]  You know like there's people that I listen to and and there's people that when I'm fucking up
[58:39.570 --> 58:45.470]  They'll call me right away be like hey, you're fucking up, and he's one of those guys. You know what I mean I I
[58:46.470 --> 58:53.710]  Listen to Nelson and there's probably like three people like that in my life, but he's one of the three so shout out Nelson
[58:53.710 --> 58:55.430]  He's a really nice
[58:55.430 --> 59:00.750]  Upstanding dude very you know blunt too, so shout out that food
[59:02.110 --> 59:03.750]  Was he able to reach out to you?
[59:03.750 --> 59:08.750]  I know that you were pretty vocal on your Instagram about the one night where you got pretty drunk and
[59:09.750 --> 59:11.350]  Yeah
[59:11.350 --> 59:16.350]  Forced you to kind of the next morning kind of wake up and be like holy shit. Yeah, man
[59:16.350 --> 59:18.190]  I haven't drank since that day, bro
[59:18.190 --> 59:23.070]  I've been sober since that day well not sober, but I haven't drank a lick of alcohol since that day
[59:23.070 --> 59:28.950]  I really reflected on that day was a wake-up call it beats getting in a car accident or fighting at a bar
[59:29.670 --> 59:33.990]  You know so thank God it was that and not fucking
[59:34.630 --> 59:37.510]  Something worse man, and Nelson was like hey
[59:38.750 --> 59:40.750]  You need help
[59:43.910 --> 59:47.310]  He's like no you need help like professional help I was like nah I got it
[59:47.310 --> 59:49.350]  I got it, and I figured it out
[59:49.350 --> 59:54.510]  It was you know it was kind of like I put myself on the line because if like I had a lot of people to
[59:54.510 --> 01:00:00.390]  Impress at that point you know Instagram. I'm like okay. I'm going I'm gonna stop drinking guys like if I would have went right back
[01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:04.730]  To drinking four days later. You're scumbag. I'm like 60 days right now. I don't even feel like
[01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.450]  Good for you, man, yeah
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:16.090]  Yeah, I think you know people want to see in my opinion the real people also want to see people succeed and come from
[01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.450]  Nothing and make something of themselves
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:22.090]  I know the majority of people on the internet want to see people bleed and they love to see that
[01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:26.410]  Blood in the water, but for some of us out there. We want to see people succeed
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:32.370]  That's really the whole goal of this show too is just to to put other people on so that we can have an intelligent conversation
[01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:38.290]  And today, I'm really excited to the you've almost been like a mystery. I feel like for some people out there
[01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:44.050]  You know there's so many people that you know you've been on the scene for what two years and all of a sudden everybody knows
[01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:47.450]  Your life it seems like so that was one of the reasons why I reached out to you
[01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:52.930]  But it's because I think people deserve to hear you know what you're about and the fact that you know from the from
[01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.490]  from the point when Layton asked you about
[01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:01.290]  Michael and his family and stuff like that it really resonated with me when you were talking about you know
[01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.450]  I'm gonna give all that all that to his lady, and I feel like that's a
[01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:11.890]  An idea that comes from more of like an OG mindset and to really have that at 28 years old hats off to you brother
[01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.370]  yeah, man, just
[01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:18.770]  Freaking that's just me man. That's how I was brought up man. I got a good family
[01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:24.050]  Has nothing to do with weed and everything to do how you brought up brought up pretty cool with
[01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.770]  Okay, did you see this one?
[01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:30.690]  Talk about fat Billy times Wilson and GMO sourdough Wilson all right
[01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:39.050]  Fat Billy times Wilson you'll get a lot of GMO and that motherfucker so fat Billy is legend og
[01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.810]  times GMO which is fat so
[01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:50.370]  Backcross no no it's not back cross. That's an older strain, but yeah, it's GMO Dom as fuck. What is fat Billy? It's it's uh?
[01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.890]  It's fat so times
[01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:54.890]  It's fat so times
[01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:58.090]  Triangle Kush or some shit I forgot I made that shit like two years ago now
[01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.770]  But I make a lot of strains, but fat Billy dumps
[01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:05.210]  GMO Dom so like if you want GMO turps go grab you some fat Billy and
[01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:10.050]  As far as GMO sourdough which has GMO in it as well
[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:16.410]  Which is but it's fem stock the sourdough was was reversed on to the GMO so it's sourdough
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:22.790]  Dom it's not GMO Dom you're gonna get a lot of sourdough with GMO undertones with the sexiness
[01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.890]  From the Wilson so you're gonna get a lot of purple
[01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:29.130]  Pungent plants from the GMO sourdough some people got blueberry from it
[01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.070]  I don't know what the fuck they got blueberry, but everybody has a different nose

[01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:24.590]  Talked to everybody man. I'd rather be not friends
[01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:31.110]  I'd rather be cool with everybody then like have then be like known as a hater or anything like that
[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:34.970]  I don't have to love you. I don't have to have dinner with you. I don't have to hate you either
[01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:39.070]  I don't have to like you, but I can know you I could I could say what's up
[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.830]  You know I don't even have to say what's up, but like
[01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:47.470]  Disliking somebody is a lot of energy for me like I was the original burner hater. I was the original
[01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:52.310]  Jungle boy hater. I was the original coma hater, and they'll tell you they'll be like yeah
[01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:55.630]  May Sonic used to be a dick like he fucked me
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:05:02.030]  He made a million memes about me everybody knows the burner shit with me, and if you don't well fucking I was
[01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:08.310]  Somehow part of the circle that made the fucking rest in peace burner t-shirts and and there I said it
[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:11.430]  But like I like and and for some reason
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:15.230]  I'm still like cool burner because I rather be cool with him than be like
[01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.230]  Then do that shit because that shit's not funny
[01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.030]  It's funny, but it's not funny once you take it too far
[01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.630]  So like I'm cool with everybody now
[01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:28.230]  And and that's how I play my cards like with everybody if anybody has a beef with me
[01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:31.970]  It's it's in their own head because I don't have a beef with nobody
[01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:38.850]  Even the people that I still like go and dig out the ground and kick them a little bit still I don't hate you
[01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.570]  I just just just make a formal apology letter and we could be cool
[01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.890]  Do you see that one
[01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.610]  F3 I got an f3 that I'm about to pop about the f4
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.680]  Give me one
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.440]  Work the line
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:07.380]  Shit f3 f3 and I've done a I've crossed you know in cross. I think it's called like where you cross to a different
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.560]  Generation, but of the same seed stock or some shit like that
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.960]  I've done that but I've never like I've never been like oh
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.960]  I'm gonna go get all the plants with the narrow leaves and and and
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.600]  Isolate those traits and make that seed stock. I've yet to do anything like that
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.040]  I've done Wilson photos times
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:33.240]  Autos, but those are mostly photos. They are photos, so I don't have any Wilson autos no
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.640]  Pineapple Wilson is great fuck yeah, man. That's pineapple under the sea that was given to me from like a
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:46.880]  Who knows how many generations of farmery like this is our pineapple seed stock you really need to grow it
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.520]  I was like fuck it like I said I like growing weird shit sure enough. I grew it pineapple is fuck
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.200]  Fucking called it pineapple under the sea how do you cure I throw that shit?
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:02.880]  well I grew four seeds this time and I freaking I I dried them outside on the on the frames of the greenhouse and
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.120]  100% germ rate my D. How do I dry for weed freaking?
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.560]  I've yet to harvest anything in a while
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.320]  But I would dry it inside my indoor and I would like set up with the Huey and just keep it fresh in there
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.560]  Now dry it for like 14 days. I don't cure shit. I just dry it
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.560]  What strain is your best hash shielder?
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:27.520]  There's a lot grab Malibu Marshall Wilson Poon tank pie Wilson Sunday driver Wilson Skittles Tropicana Wilson Wilson by itself
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.840]  there's tons of dumpers in my
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.600]  You know and weed so
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  Any family lines nah gee I need to do a family line ASAP
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.360]  What are your thoughts on autumn flowers?
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.360]  Autos are cool. They have a time and place for whatever they do
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.240]  They're fun
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:52.400]  Hey, I got a good one for you. I've been doing some work with endophytic bacteria and and
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.080]  maintaining or supporting its biological viability on the seed and
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.000]  Some some interesting information is coming out about how
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.160]  Drying the seed too much or you know washing the seed
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.040]  Can can actually affect that that special relationship between that bacteria in the seed and
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.840]  So I was speaking with a gentleman James White
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:23.200]  He's a doctor back east that is specifically targeting at endophytic both bacteria and fungi
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.440]  And he and I had a you know a chopped up conversation about like hey
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:35.440]  Wouldn't it be better to actually store the seeds in the buds so that the buds prevented or provided an insulation layer?
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.720]  And a little bit of biomass to just protect that those endophytic bacteria
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.080]  Do you dry your seeds out or how do you how do you store them?
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.880]  I uh
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.880]  So I dry them in the plants of course
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.080]  So it's it's hard to get seeds out of wet stock, you know
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.160]  Like it's so I dry them brittle dry and then I you know
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040]  And then I put them in people's hands, you know
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.480]  I keep as I store them in the freshness because if I if like these seeds are gonna go in people's hands ASAP
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040]  so uh
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.400]  so uh
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.160]  uh, I do see what you're coming at though, like if we were to like
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.760]  Have buds and like give them to people in the buds. That'd be fucking dope, but it's hard to get buds
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.880]  In people's hands like maybe if it was a local show
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:29.040]  And you just so happen to have it a fresh harvest or even keeping like your buds around bagged up and as you go
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.240]  Shucking them that like that'd be cool. And I have seen somebody do that
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.800]  And uh, I kind of talked
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.200]  Down on him, but he he did have an idea
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.360]  A whole plant
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.720]  Wellness or something like that some dude who's like super into knf
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.640]  uh who
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.880]  Whatever that dude did that like when he gives you his seeds
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.320]  He leaves them in the bud which is fucking a cool way to see what the mom was about at least
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.000]  And that's what I got from that
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.960]  But never did I get from it a better way of storing it because of whatever bacterium is in there, you know
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.960]  And I mean that's dope. That's gangster
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.360]  Yeah
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  That fool right there
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.440]  That was a bit sketchy peter when you put it up, but yeah, it was all bad
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.200]  I can't see shit man
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:25.280]  Cool i'm glad i'm glad you're uh, you're thinking on that and you know, we're we're putting on a conference coming up
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.400]  um in in december, excuse me november
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:34.320]  and uh, I I would hope or I would ask you to uh help promote it, um, it's going to
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.280]  Good causes keeping some of us alive keeping the work being carried on and uh,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:46.400]  And supporting our families and but we're not asking for charity. We're asking for you know support in the industry and
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.280]  You know if you would if you'd be so kind as to you know
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.240]  Hook us up with people that want to go down the living soils trail and don't really know where to start or
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.200]  Need a refresher or want to get to the next level
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.880]  Um, you know, please come out. Uh, i'm brian and I've been posting it up and we'll make sure that you know
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.160]  We get it out as much as we can until the date's coming up
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.120]  Um, but we got a heavy hitter lineup for the first show
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.260]  And the first show only builds or prepares everybody or sets the foundation
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.000]  Uh for the second one, which is going to be pretty hardcore deep
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.720]  Uh, and then right down the line until we till we roll at the finish it out in in april
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:29.440]  um as a way to you know, support the industry and and push this or drive this toward toward a more
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240]  organic, uh plant-fed
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.460]  event-friendly uh plant potential
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.400]  uh goal
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.200]  Yeah, let's do that. That's easier for me because every day people are asking me sonic. How do you grow?
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.280]  Well, boom look here talk to these guys. They're gonna help you out, man
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.160]  But yeah, i'm really appreciate that
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.480]  Really appreciate it
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:58.640]  Learn living soil.com where they can register for that academy and uh, like layton said we have some of the the biggest superstars from
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.480]  the soil science world
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:07.040]  That we have talking, uh the first day we have layton morrison, uh chip osborne and dr
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.800]  Laneyham and then on the second day we have uh, kevin jobbery
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.760]  Uh joshua steensland and then dragon, uh dragon earth fly medicine
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.000]  So we're we're really excited to be able to work with those guys and and promote living soil on a virtual
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.160]  platform
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.280]  and we have uh, we have no problem with if you guys buy a ticket and you had 50 people at
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.600]  At your house watching the event. Uh, we're encouraging that we want to have a community
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.520]  We want people to work together and start to have a dialogue back and forth
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.560]  So that's something that layton and myself as well as daniel and king have really been working on behind the scenes
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.220]  Yeah, and we wanted to make it like more conference-like because unfortunately
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.240]  Those aren't going to be around for a while
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.740]  So that's where we came up with the idea. Hey, you know have 10 friends, you know be corona responsible
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.460]  But have 10 friends each guy puts in five bucks
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:02.100]  I mean that's not gonna hurt and you got a weekend party you can sit around your living room dabbing drinking
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.220]  eating popcorn
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:08.340]  whatever whatever your game is and have your buddies with you and and we'll drop some hardcore knowledge and
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.040]  You'll be able to take notes. You'll have access to the speaker's emails
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:17.780]  And it'll really you know foundation you up as as you move forward in breeding or growing
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.620]  Straight up man. There's always something to learn i'll put the message out there. That's nothing but uh, you know
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.340]  That ain't a problem for me. I got you guys. Thanks, brother
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.660]  Appreciate that man. Yeah, it's learn living soil.com for you. Uh
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:35.080]  For some of you in the chat there you said learn living soil.com
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.100]  That's correct. That's what i'm talking about
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.340]  Yeah
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:48.660]  Have I crossed any aoe genetics? Yeah, man. I crossed cherry cupcake. I crossed. Hey, holy girl. I crossed skittles mints
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:56.820]  Uh, i'd get to put them available to people i'm probably gonna sort through those myself and find something cooler for you guys to fuck with
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.860]  Probably cross it back or something get a bigger seed stock who knows
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:10.340]  Hey, man, did you always have the mindset like look i'm gonna blow up instagram if that they delete 100 accounts fuck them
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:15.380]  I'm, just gonna keep doing my thing and then eventually i'll figure it out and i'll be able to keep one or
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.300]  Dude i've
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.500]  When my wife used to have instagram like five years ago
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.100]  I was like, what are you doing on there?
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:27.060]  Like that's a waste of time like go read a book because I read I read a lot of comic books
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.340]  I have hobbies actual hobbies and i'm like, what are you doing?
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.980]  Get off instagram and then i'm all like I got on there
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.540]  I'm, like damn there's a lot of wheat stuff on here
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:41.220]  And and and then little by little my way of getting attention back in the day was to fuck with people
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:46.260]  So I would fuck with a lot of people like I would fuck with cali out there i'd fucking poke fun at him
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.820]  I poke fun at coma. I go poke fun at jungle boys and I was good with memes
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.660]  I come from the 4chan era so I I knew about memes before they were cool
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.980]  So I knew how to orchestrate a meme well and make it funny and and you know
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:04.420]  And and that's what i'm good at and and used to be good at I still am but I don't do that no more
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.820]  but uh, that's and and I had no intentions no plans of
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:16.500]  Becoming a uh, uh, uh, you know a 30k going on 40k phenomenon on instagram. I didn't know that was gonna happen
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.280]  I just wrote like you said everything happened like spontaneously
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.220]  Like this ass over here get away, dude
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:29.940]  So we got two calculator questions you do yeah, man, I did uh, and then
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:37.300]  I did shiver me timbers, uh times wilson with calculator. He has a his half of the stock
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.300]  I have my half half of the stock
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.380]  I've yet to release any
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.940]  Uh, it's up to him when he wants to release it. I grew the shit out of stranded. It's just up to him
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:52.020]  He has to test it. I've smoked hash of it. I've smoked at least five different phenos of it. I grew it out
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:56.020]  For as long as i've made the seed i'm thinking about growing it again
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:02.420]  This will be my third time growing out with the stranded and but I I can't release it because the big homie said no so
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.900]  You guys gotta wait go go ask cap be like cap when it's stranded dropping he'll give you an answer
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.620]  Go bug him about it
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.540]  Do you wash your seeds nah, no, no, no, no straight off the the plant into the bag
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.620]  That's how oh I shouldn't even say nothing but that's how you lose a big germ rate
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.900]  You know some people wash seeds
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:33.460]  Washing product making hash and then they realize they can make a little money off those seeds that they washed
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.020]  And then they sell them
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.140]  And then the germ rates terrible and then everybody wants to kill him
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:47.380]  I'll just leave that at that. Hey, that tea is dope. Masonic smoker. Hope you enjoy. Hey, thanks, man. I appreciate man lately
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:53.380]  I've been doing trades for maple syrup and honey. So I got tons of maple syrup and honey. Thank you guys. You guys are the best
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.180]  Relentless man shout out relentless man. I see them doing work. I grew some
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.020]  Frosted chopped cherry cookies and I smoked some chopped frosted cookies the other day is really good stuff
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.820]  Yeah, man shout out seed breeders dog
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:15.280]  Okay, there are a lot of comments in the chat
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.770]  Here while I'm scrolling you guys
[01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:26.210]  Peanut Gallery have any comments? Yeah, your mics pretty low, but I sorry
[01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:34.050]  Yeah, my wife came over here she was trying to put up the volume when Peter was talking I'm like nah, that's just how his mic is
[01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:37.090]  Yeah
[01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:43.250]  What's that
[01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:50.460]  I thought late late you're gonna hit him the question. Uh, no, I was just gonna say Peter
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.300]  I'm gonna say Peter. I'm gonna say Peter. I'm gonna say Peter
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:18:01.260]  The question, uh, no, I was just gonna say Peter, thank you you're doing a great job keeping rapid firing on this boy
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.620]  Yeah, and then I got way behind on the comments i'm trying to scroll through them
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.220]  Yeah
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.060]  I've seen you on instagram
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.100]  Every single day for it seems like two years straight, you know
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:21.340]  I mean if you lay one day off the people get scared. They're like, where is he? He's not going live today
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.980]  Where's where's my sonic at? Are you okay? So
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:30.140]  It's consistency is key. And I mean it's part of the job now to go live, you know
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:35.180]  Once or twice a day and it beats breaking rocks. Like I said, what do you think about barney farm?
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:40.460]  I don't know anything about barney farm besides the fact that they're old school and i'm into old school stuff
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:47.260]  So I would need to grow it to be able to know you use dmt. Hell. Yeah, man dmt. Shout out dmt, bro
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.660]  If you haven't done dmt
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:51.980]  Go do you some man that shit's like, you know
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.980]  There's things you do in life
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.580]  And and that shit
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.140]  They don't give it to the people for a reason because we might be a little bit enlightened if we all did that shit
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.220]  So you're actually doing the crystalline
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.340]  I did the refined dmt I did it
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:14.220]  Without with the alkalines or however you say it and I also have done it with pure guava esters in a in a bait pan
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:19.980]  Before i've done it like 50 probably more times. I have a video of me gone for like 15 minutes
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:26.060]  And i've done it to the point where i've come back to reality and everything is still kind of geometric
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.540]  So I kind of thought I lost it. So I started crying
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:33.340]  Because it had been like fucking 20 minutes almost and it never lasted that long
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.980]  and uh, that was like
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.420]  I get it now, you know
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.020]  and that was that's why I don't do it as much no more because I get it now and I used to
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.860]  Have my little dark nights where I would drink and when you drink you get gutsy
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.660]  And if you just happen to have dmt around you're just doing it like every other three days. So
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.260]  uh
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:55.020]  It was good and and and I get it, you know, shout out dmt
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:58.380]  It's cool that we can escape this reality for a bit
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.540]  and not have like
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:03.980]  Become a fucking meth addict or something after it's just like a thing
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:11.020]  Yeah, it's interesting. What it what it does is it actually kind of rewires your brain to some degree and uh,
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:16.060]  There's another one mdma, which is a natural resources from the plants
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:22.480]  It's a little bit longer lasting but it definitely uplifting and if you're dealing with depression or anxiety
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:27.740]  You know some of these things can be used responsibly and micro-dosed and I love what you said
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.220]  I used it till I didn't need it anymore and uh green bode green bode hit on that ship man
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:36.460]  He was like, you know, I got to a point where you know, i'm cool now i'm rewired
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.060]  I you know, i'm in a great place in a great headspace and um, yeah
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.740]  I've had the pleasure of talking with a lot of people about micro dosing. Um
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:47.100]  And using some of these plant derived, uh natural
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:52.860]  uh products like cannabis to to enlighten themselves and enlighten their mood and uh,
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.980]  So yeah, i'm glad glad that came up dude. Glad that came up
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.140]  Yeah
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.900]  Do you have a strain that's easier to grow than others? If so, what is it and how would you describe it?
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:07.420]  Thanks. I mean, uh when it comes to that it's usually feedback from growers like they'll be like dude
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.580]  This strain grows itself. So i've heard like chemdi95 wilson
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.420]  Hits every box and it grows itself. So go grab you some of those, you know
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.220]  So yeah, there are strains that grow easier than others for sure
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:25.340]  What do you think about symbiotic? Uh symbiotic man? I don't have nothing to say. I think all breeding foods are cool
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.580]  you know not I think all
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:28.540]  Seed makers are cool
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.980]  It's just like some people are shitty people and and and and I wouldn't say you're shitty on on a public platform
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.460]  I kind of keep that to myself because you know, if you ain't got something nice to say don't say nothing
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:42.620]  So shout out everybody that makes seeds wilson times golden goat. Yeah, man
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:47.420]  I'm about to get some golden goat seed. Somebody told me that that's a really good cool cross from irie
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.180]  and uh in colorado cold weather strain, uh, damn

[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:01.100]  I'll think about what good everything grew fine in the winter run. Nothing was like
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.740]  But what grew the best?
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:08.460]  The bad motherfuckers got really big in the cold grow some bad motherfuckers time wilson those get really big
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.220]  That's and it is not even that cold. It's california cold. I don't even count
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.100]  And not california cold but like los angeles cold it ain't that cold over here
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.740]  I would need some dude growing like in maine or something to be like dude, here are the results
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.380]  Or some dude that just turned the temps all the way down and is indoor

[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:48.300]  Yeah, man, let's do it. I seen a slimer that uh, slimer bx wilson and it's not
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:55.900]  Bx was before I I called it bx before I knew the true meaning of what bx was so it's it's it's it's actually
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:02.300]  In-cross to a different same generation, but a different parent so my slimer wilson times wilson
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:07.820]  Like fucking died got frost on it and then it came back to life the next morning. So that one's cool
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:14.060]  But i'd want it to stay alive during the cold to be like, okay that's stronger
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:20.060]  Advices for doing breeding at home. Just do it. G easy does it man? Don't overthink it
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:27.040]  So
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.440]  So the questions slow down a little peter

[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.360]  Yeah, and I and I learned that too even some days I try to I do some little malicious things here and there
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.080]  But it's just to have my leg up and on people that think they have their leg up on me
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.520]  so and that's you know, one in a few people here and there so
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.000]  Uh besides that I just spread the good vibes man because lord knows it can get dark in the spring
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.160]  Yeah, i'm into that
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480]  What is the best og for you may sonic?
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.360]  Uh, damn, man, that's a good question because i'm from la and that's what I grew up on
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.160]  and uh, there was so many ogs that
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.160]  It was almost like a mexican, uh song like they all sound the same
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.960]  So, you know now that i'm older and more versed in my palate is you know
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.040]  Stuff is more accessible and I can distinguish the og amongst another og
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840]  I still don't have an answer for you, but gee
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.280]  You know what? I mean? I've grown hardcore og. I've grown tahoe og
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.280]  but uh
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.680]  It's like a mexican song. They all sound the same to me
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.040]  most interesting tech profile shit, uh
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.240]  I was growing some gelato 45 blood orange
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.680]  And
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.120]  Like two weeks three weeks before harvest like it was smelling like bubblegum like legit bubblegum
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:22.080]  But then it transitioned into orange and that's one of the weirdest terpene profiles i've gotten off of
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.800]  Of a cannabis plant because i've yet to really really get a bubblegum plant and get any bubblegum seeds
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:33.840]  I'm surprised I haven't gone out of my way to go find somebody with some bubblegum genetics just to get you know
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.760]  Bubblegum smells off of anything that smells like bubblegum to them
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.200]  So, yeah, that was one of the most interesting terpene profiles i've ever had point blank period
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.680]  I'm looking for uh, someone asked, uh what your favorite memes are
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040]  My favorite memes
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.680]  Yeah, hold on i'm i'm looking for the that's a weird question. Uh, well you you you you

[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.840]  Oh, man, that's that's all of them man. They're always good. If they're not good. I just don't put them out like uh,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.520]  Like they're like I like to put like the dude that you know
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:29.120]  He looks like unfit kind of heavy stature and he'll be like you're not allowed to breed with that
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.880]  And just like stuff like that. Like I like stuff like that
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  But those are funny to me
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.840]  I'm gonna tell you the truth. I like that meme template
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.480]  I'm gonna just tell you
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.760]  But yeah memes are just memes man, there's so many
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.960]  Like I dropped so many it's hard to me to be like, okay, that's like a piece of art like
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  Uh memes just mean man
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.700]  And i'm like, uh, I don't make them that much anymore. But when I do they're hilarious
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.240]  What's the best yielding purple strains? I don't know man. Uh
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.840]  Shh
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.640]  Go grab you some well those sold out as soon as I dropped them
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.320]  but uh

[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.280]  What's your ipm process just keep mixing it up fool?
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:18.240]  Use some always use some labs

[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:45.120]  Like you actually have to spray it like if you spray every two three days your plants will probably be fine, you know
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.280]  Masonic you spread the best word on the ground lately cutting out shout out shout out all the medicated mesquite
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:28:00.000]  Hey, you're spreading the eagle 20 for the turps, right? I mean eagle 20 is it it fucking you get high off the eagle, too

[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.600]  Shit, don't even spray your buds
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.640]  If you don't even have to just spray during veg stay on top of your shit so you don't have to spray during flower
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.960]  A healthy plant will not have issues. That's for sure. Yeah
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.360]  And then you can also get predatory insects too people fuck with those too. Well, there's a there's a there's a hundred ways to skin
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.880]  That motherfucker. So

[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  About breeding that's all self-education
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:09.200]  That's all bro. That's all hands-on. Nobody can tell me like yo, I taught me sonic out of nah, bro

[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.960]  That's all
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:20.880]  Yeah, eagle 20 is uh the foundation of korean natural farming actually yeah master cho actually
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  Him and his son
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:32.560]  Yeah, they brought that over that's why we still uh give homage to them with the korean korean natural farming with the eagle 20
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.040]  straight up
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:44.160]  Yeah, I think dude I dabbled in knf really deep I even went as far as doing whatever jdom I could do uh
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.880]  I freaking did ohhn
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.420]  fpj faa
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.320]  fucking a little bit of everything man, I I
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120]  I spread it in
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.160]  Amongst my peers on instagram people were like, what are you doing, dude?
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:05.120]  I would I was like the first knf meme nazi actually so like haha like that's not knf it sucks
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.960]  Like I was that guy dude. That was the first one. So shut up. Hey, that brings up a really good question
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.680]  Where did you get a imo in your city where in your surrounding area? You don't you don't?
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.560]  You go find a dead body or somewhere man
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:26.560]  I had to drop that dude. I just had to fucking ask
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.920]  If you don't get fucking kf or nf imo is the foundation and you don't collect it in a place. That's yeah
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.480]  I mean, I I put like insect frass on top of my imo box
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.160]  I put earthworm castings just so it could like feed off of those, you know
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:49.120]  Organisms that might have been in there to repopulate and I have you know, lord knows compton used to be farming land
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.960]  But it's also kind of track soil so like you ain't finding no fucking imos out here no good ones at least
[01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:01.270]  Ain't nothing indigenous about track soil and comfy
[01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:07.890]  Oh, dude too cool
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.900]  But i've done imos with my
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:20.060]  indigenous over here i've even brought it all the way to imo three and i've like crushed the fucking you know, the the
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.900]  The the sugar mixed with rice into like a 60 gallon drum
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.860]  and let it just you know populate in there and then
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:32.400]  Throw that 60 gallon drum onto the ground and then it literally just made like this whole layer of mycelium
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.260]  Uh, and this was when my my backyard was cement
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:40.640]  So whatever like little piece of dirt that I had the whole thing was inoculated with a whole fuzzy layer of mycelium
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.300]  Oh, that's beautiful dude nice. Yeah
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.780]  inoculation bombs
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:51.900]  Do you get worms? Yeah, man, just spray bt bro. You gotta be hard on your bt during veg bro sprayed everywhere
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.400]  What are your herbs of choice to make gym i've never done a jaydom pesticide I only did the
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.600]  The the the like the fertilizer it's not fertilizer
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.860]  But if you let it sit too long, it turns into a fertilizer
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.240]  I just did where you grab the potato
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.440]  And you put like some soil in there and then like that soil
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.120]  Eats the starch from the potato and it populates in there. That's all I did on jaydom
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.560]  I didn't dive that deep into there
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.120]  that's when I started going back into easy does it where I was just making my seeds as opposed to
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.480]  growing for you know education purposes
[01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.870]  And then I found out like
[01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:36.830]  Jaydom is better than knf. You know what?
[01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:40.590]  I mean according to his son and then people are like knf you use too much sugar
[01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:46.910]  And then knf is like a roll of the dice and then there's bad organisms that could be populated and people are just kind of
[01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:50.510]  just grabbing bananas from the store and shit that've been sprayed with shit like
[01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:55.390]  There's somebody really has to like set it in stone like these are the ones you want to use
[01:32:55.470 --> 01:33:00.430]  But at the end of the day, it's cool to know new things have something else in your toolbox. It doesn't hurt. So
[01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:05.230]  Uh shit, I did a knf indoor like three four years ago
[01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:12.430]  Like in in a bed like people were like you're crazy. I was like nah, man knf, you know, and I was a little crazy
[01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.430]  And
[01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:18.590]  Sublime is dope man. I rock with sublime. I used to think they were the best rock band when I was a kid
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:23.310]  That's how much rock I listened to when I was a kid. That's how i'm growing mushrooms in the same pot
[01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:25.230]  uh mushrooms
[01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:27.870]  I think you still get in more trouble for mushrooms just because
[01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:32.110]  They still looked at a little bit different like if you had a bunch of mushrooms on you
[01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:38.190]  Well, you just grow the non-psychedelic types and they actually actually do wonderful things, uh building soil structure
[01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:41.070]  releasing globulin, which is the glue that comes from the
[01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:45.250]  Hyphae so yeah, they they're they're good. They're very complimentary
[01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:54.030]  Nice i'm surprised nobody's made a hyphy meme or anything like bay area mushroom hyphy meme. That's that's you're on it. You're on it
[01:33:56.430 --> 01:34:00.510]  That's your job for this afternoon, bro, I got one job today
[01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:03.790]  Yeah, man
[01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:05.790]  What are your favorite crosses of all time?
[01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:06.830]  Uh
[01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:12.030]  All of them man. I'm not too particular to uh, one thing. I like a lot of things
[01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:17.870]  I don't I don't have one favorite cross. I like to smoke pungent strains more than anything. So if that helps
[01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:23.490]  And what is pungent to me pungent is like gas ogs
[01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:25.390]  you know
[01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:30.270]  Sours stuff like that gmos cans. I like that type of stuff
[01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:34.910]  Uh, yeah, there's actually a podcast on shaping fire
[01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:41.550]  I think it's episode 45. I get into a deep uh, there's actually a little youtube 10-minute clip first
[01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:45.950]  Uh, then listen to the podcast you'll have all the information you need to dive down that hole
[01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:49.390]  Dope i'm gonna look at that too
[01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:53.390]  Yeah, layton's the no g in his world, man. So it's cool that you guys
[01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:56.430]  A little bit right here
[01:34:56.430 --> 01:35:03.230]  Uh, sure, I mean it it it was something like my background is um, I came came out of rodale
[01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:07.790]  uh, and how it was thrown into how to uh, get
[01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:14.590]  Microbes to colonize engineered soil engineered soil is 90 percent sand 10 organic matter
[01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:19.230]  And more often than not that gets down as low as one percent organic matter
[01:35:19.390 --> 01:35:25.790]  And so you have something that drains so fast that you know, the advanced micro, uh, mycology cannot hold
[01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:28.190]  Fungi can't set up shop
[01:35:28.330 --> 01:35:30.670]  protozoas nematodes can't live in that environment
[01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:34.030]  so right away I started playing with uh,
[01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:40.670]  Very biologically active hemic acid which I made uh through a stripping process and it worked like a charm
[01:35:41.230 --> 01:35:45.150]  Um, so then I got tossed into some really really high-end landscapes, you know
[01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:47.870]  The three and a half million dollars just for the landscape
[01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:51.710]  eight hundred thousand dollars in material plant material
[01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:54.030]  and
[01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:58.750]  Now they're like, all right. We want to we want to do this 100 organic. We do not want any runoff
[01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:01.010]  This is a you know, what sensitive watershed?
[01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:08.290]  Um, so I learned how to engineer soils, uh to the next level so that each plant even though they are completely different succession
[01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:12.030]  Can live next to each other which is these crazy architects would design
[01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:18.270]  And so right away, you know, I did the deep dive on engineering sandstone clay
[01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:23.490]  um in an organic matter for specific plants in specific successions
[01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:30.990]  Um, so then when I got introduced into the cannabis industry, I was like, yeah, you guys are growing living soils
[01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:37.230]  You know, are you using any sand silt and clay and and basically I got laughed at you know for even suggesting it
[01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:44.990]  But people that have used the horizon system have had wonderful results, especially if they're never going to touch their soil again
[01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:50.030]  You know if you're if you are going to grow with a salt or or uh, even an organic nutrient
[01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:57.790]  Um, you may have issues with with a what we call a soilless medium because you get anaerobic and hydrophobic pockets
[01:36:58.350 --> 01:37:02.110]  Uh that prevent watering like we were talking a little bit earlier about that soil mix
[01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:07.550]  Um, yeah, you got to hydrate it which takes time and and if your plant's in there, you're going to have issues
[01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:09.550]  so, you know the
[01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:14.670]  The the idea behind the the horizon system is that the a horizon which is in the middle
[01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:21.950]  Acts like heart and lungs. So if there's excess moisture above in the o horizon, which is your soilless medium
[01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.670]  It will pull that moisture out
[01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:29.090]  But it will not let that top layer that o horizon go hydrophobic
[01:37:30.190 --> 01:37:32.350]  Because as it starts to dry down
[01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:40.190]  The water naturally wicks back up out of that a horizon and if necessary the a horizon can pull it from the e horizon
[01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:42.450]  So it just keeps the whole pot at equilibrium
[01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:45.170]  And you know that's going to be
[01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:50.290]  uh another deep dive at some point in the near future about redox potential and understanding how
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:55.010]  You need these kinds of things to to achieve that level of uh,
[01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:57.310]  plant
[01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:59.010]  perfection or potential
[01:37:59.010 --> 01:38:00.370]  Um, but anyway, so yeah
[01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:04.690]  Just watch the watch the uh, watch the little quick video first so that you can see
[01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:09.730]  You can get a visual of what i'm talking about and then then listen to the podcast. It's deep
[01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.970]  It'll it'll get you all the information you really need
[01:38:13.090 --> 01:38:18.920]  No doubt
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Is it getting quiet over there peter
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.280]  No, I was posting some of the go fund me stuff in the chat. Uh, thank you man. Thank you
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.160]  And brie, I love you girl. We're gonna we're gonna take care of you man. Community is going to get behind you
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:35.150]  You're gonna be okay
[01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:37.310]  Yeah, what
[01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:42.290]  Let's talk off air on that how we can all help each other promote that stuff. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely
[01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:45.490]  That just happened two weeks ago layton is it oh, yeah
[01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:49.170]  Fifth I think it was
[01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:51.730]  Yeah, yeah, you're right
[01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:56.050]  And ironically, I literally finished that first experiment
[01:38:56.690 --> 01:38:59.090]  That night I pulled the compost pile apart
[01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:04.050]  And I had put started assembling my notes so that I could call him the next day and you know
[01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:07.570]  Tell him how well his his his uh nutrient system worked
[01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:14.290]  Yeah, fuck me that that that conversation never happened and uh, yeah, I really missed the boy I really do he was a genius
[01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:16.930]  And boy, did he have a big heart?
[01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:19.650]  Good guy
[01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:25.170]  Yeah that steven dude had a chip on his fucking shoulder when I was fucking across from him, dude
[01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:28.080]  It was like
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.320]  I'd fucking say apples and he'd say fucking oranges even though we're talking about
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.720]  Yeah, I'm glad I never got the opportunity to meet him because
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:44.960]  Yeah, yeah, there was definitely some issues there and you know, michael was kind to him that fucking dude stole all michael's
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:51.120]  Science gear so that he could continue formulating and you know, it's fucking tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.440]  And he was kind to me and I was kind to him and I was kind to him
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.200]  And I was kind to him and I was kind to him and I was kind to him
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.400]  And you know, it's fucking tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.960]  Plus he stole the fucking genetics and you know
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:10.080]  He just went out with a fucking really bad nasty taste and michael was still loving on him saying. Hey, dude
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.640]  Just don't fucking hate on me. I'm not gonna hate on you and when he and I talked about you know
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.160]  The setback on losing that equipment. He's like no. No, no, i'll get it. I'll get it again, you know
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.720]  I'm starting to work with some other people and and you know, they're gonna give me a lab give me you know
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.280]  Set up that I can start really reformulating again
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.440]  So even after the guy fucked him michael was like, you know stand up about it
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:36.480]  He wasn't you know a fucking hater and uh, you know got all wrapped up in a bullshit
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:42.800]  And that just goes to testimony of who he was and how big his heart was, you know, he was a really fucking good, dude
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.400]  Terrible. Yeah fucking huge loss
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.800]  So layton, why don't you take this one?
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.480]  That's for you late
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.960]  Dude, all right. Look there's there's microbes that live in volcanic vents at the bottom of the ocean ph0
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.740]  Uh, there's there's organisms that live in ph14
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:14.000]  There's fucking organisms living in biofilm off the space shuttle for three fucking years or the space station. So
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:18.480]  ph is all based on you know, the
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:25.120]  availability of nutrients or minerals, uh in the soil system, so it really doesn't
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:32.000]  There's microbes that live in all of that. I think the better question would have been like what temperature do microbes die at?
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:37.520]  So as soon as you hit 120 degrees in your compost pile, you're losing diversity
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.920]  You're losing organisms and in natural farming
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  Uh, the same thing is true when you're making an imo3 if you hit 120 man, you're screwed. You got to turn it real quick
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.400]  So, you know my my philosophy it was always low and slow
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:56.960]  Uh, I get my best results when i'm growing a biological compost at between 80 and 100 80 and 90 degrees
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.280]  You know it often as I put the greens and browns together and then inoculate it
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.780]  I'll have it go up as high as 110 115
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.640]  And if I get there i'll flip it right away
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:12.080]  um, but I I I usually try to target 110 as my height and
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.760]  Then let it cool back down and the way I control that is the amount of greens the nitrogen I add in so
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:25.440]  Quickly, uh, you use two-thirds browns one-third greens if you're going to fuck with high nitrogen, which is like a manure or a
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.980]  distillers or brewers waste
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.760]  Five percent max got to keep that really low and increase the browns a little but um, the goal is to just keep that
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.080]  You know 80 to 90 degrees and you're going to be multiplying organisms like it's sand
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.480]  Um, you know, and then you can get into a little ferments which are foods for them
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.360]  I found that that was a really good ad
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.120]  you know one of the benefits of being trapped here during the corona was that I did get to complete a lot of the
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:56.880]  Experiments and work that I wanted to do that. I hadn't been able to in the last few years just because I was traveling so much
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.640]  But um, yeah, we'll definitely get into that in in depth, you know at this conference or you know
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:08.000]  Hit me up, but be patient because you know i'm doing the best I can to keep up with all this shit
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.900]  Magsil oh you're talking about
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:22.020]  Yeah, all right, so there are a couple key chemistry things that people uh need to respect
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:26.760]  Which is not public information. Everyone's like mpk mpk
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:31.160]  Well, really it's it's calcium magnesium to potassium
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.340]  That ratio is way more important
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:38.340]  um than your and to you know, your uh,
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:41.700]  Npk ratios and then yes, there are some
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:46.520]  Uh upper level stuff I think it's copper to sulfur relationships
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:54.260]  Um now i'm not the chemist, you know, I I've been working hard at deep diving on this stuff, but it's complicated as hell
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:58.980]  And that's why at the conference. We have chip speaking because he can really speak to these
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.680]  nuances of of understanding
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:05.700]  soil chemistry and and things to uh track
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:13.620]  Uh back and forth and compare, um, I love the the rust the guy down in oklahoma man, he's doing some badass shit
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.100]  um with with
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:21.780]  Actually managing microbes which you know, i'm really excited to get down there and scope his shit and see what he's doing
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:28.900]  Um, and he tests bi-weekly. All right, so finally someone's getting a fucking message that if you test
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:33.160]  You can start setting data points and start saying hey this cultivar
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.640]  Is chewing up this material and now I know I got to put it back in
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.360]  If i'm going to run the same strain or cultivar or if i'm not running that cultivar
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.200]  I got to be aware of what's what's missing for this next cultivar
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:49.320]  um chip, and I've been working for years on trying to
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.660]  Come up with a general guideline for cannabis nutrition
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:45:01.080]  While looking at all the strains so create a create a baseline that you say. Hey, look if you have these levels of these
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.080]  Minerals and nutrients in your soil you're off to the races
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:07.240]  But that being said that's the base
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.440]  And so each plant that you grow each run that you do
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.160]  You've got to be testing to see what is what is in excess so you don't add more of it
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.040]  And what you're missing so you can add some of it
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.840]  Um, if you add too many nutrients, you're going to get into lockout
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.600]  You're going to have all kinds of other imbalances that are going to cause other problems
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:32.360]  So chemistry's chemistry's a fucking deep one and uh, I will never proclaim to be in any way, uh proficient other than
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.760]  You know a basic understanding of that
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.080]  I got some of russ brandon's weed right here. Do you?
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:45.800]  Yeah, yeah, you sent me this jar and everything. He's a cool guy, man. Yeah, he is. He's a badass, you know, he's another
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.160]  Yeah, he's another fucking, you know genius who's self-taught
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.840]  And uh, you know has really doing he's doing the work man
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:59.400]  He's setting up data points for people to learn from and you know, they should they should respect his work
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:07.400]  Layton this one is probably for you too. Oh diatomaceous earth. Don't don't fuck with that man. That shit that shit's bad it
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.720]  It rips up nematodes. Um, yeah, it's great for an insecticide, but i'd never put it in the e horizon
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.040]  It's good if you got ants and shit
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  Yeah, yeah, no and
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.560]  uh
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.800]  one of the things I do is uh, i'm
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.660]  Getting ready to release an amo which is an aquatic microorganism
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:30.360]  um liquid, um, it's it's highly unstable you've got to
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:35.000]  Get it and use it right away or put it into a situation a brewer so you can
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:39.480]  Aerobically continue to stabilize it but it has live diatoms in it
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.340]  And diatoms are badass because they're little oxygen generators
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:51.100]  I'm working with a group of strawberry growers here in oxenard and they have to use this white plastic mulch, which I hate
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:55.580]  um, and i'm trying to encourage them to use the amo because
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:00.220]  Underneath that plastic you have an anaerobic environment. You don't have gas exchange
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:05.580]  So by putting in the diatoms into that soil profile will help to generate
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:08.140]  enough oxygen to maintain some
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:16.560]  Oxygen tolerant microbes or anaerobes depending on you if you want to call them facultative anaerobes or oxygen tolerant anaerobes
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:23.900]  So yeah, it works a little works being done. But every time i've used that that specific, uh product from my buddy
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:30.700]  As far as on cape cod i've had amazing results and when i've gone back and microscoped it the diatoms were still present
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:34.960]  So that indicates that they are able to uh be used as an inoculant
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.420]  But yeah stay away from diatomaceous earth it tears up worms and it tears up nematodes
[01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:50.130]  There you go
[01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:54.930]  Rabbits, I love cold poop man. Love it rabbits friggin llamas sheep
[01:47:55.650 --> 01:48:01.650]  There they have some magic stuff in in their compost or in their poop that you can add to compost not worry about
[01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:07.730]  What I would call high nitrogen source now again be careful when you're adding stuff like that in you don't want to get crazy
[01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:12.290]  Um, but you can be a little bit more liberal with a with a cold poop species like
[01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:14.770]  diamond set of the chickens and the cows
[01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:18.130]  But how did this end up all about me man?
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:28.450]  I killed almost all my plants this season going heavy on the kelp man. I was like just
[01:48:29.490 --> 01:48:32.210]  Fucking uh, what was it the down to earth amendments?
[01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:37.490]  I was just grabbing handfuls of kelp and throwing them into the one gallons and then the next day I woke up
[01:48:38.050 --> 01:48:42.610]  And everything was like dead pretty much and I managed to transplant it all
[01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:49.090]  And uh everything grew back to normal, but uh lord knows there's a lot of sodium or something going on in there
[01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:57.330]  Um, yeah kelp kelp concentrate can have have some issues. Uh, both coli and other uh factors that will add
[01:48:57.410 --> 01:49:02.610]  Such a high level of nitrogen that you'll get lockout and you'll fry shit. So like chicken
[01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:08.610]  They fried they fried half the yard got fried that's when I ran out of that shit, so thank god it ran out
[01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:15.650]  So dude don't take it personal but I always tell people hey, don't be a moron don't put more
[01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:20.930]  And I knew when I was doing it. I'm like i'm about to kill these motherfuckers, you know when you do that
[01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:24.370]  10 fucking times i'm like here goes nothing
[01:49:24.770 --> 01:49:30.850]  And and sure enough man, I felt the gut feeling while I was top dressing next day came and i'm like
[01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:39.090]  Well, I hate to be I hate to be an asshole, but I I often kill shit just to see what happens like
[01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:42.850]  I locked up my tomatoes and made them turn purple, dude
[01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:46.610]  I mean they were so fucking phosphorate deficit was insane
[01:49:46.690 --> 01:49:51.650]  These things were purple and they still still puked out a few fucking tomatoes and the tomatoes were delicious
[01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:55.970]  but they were not happy campers and I was I was playing to see if I could just
[01:49:56.450 --> 01:50:02.770]  Just bring them back with with with a compost extract and not not care that the phosphorus was there
[01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:07.410]  Um, it didn't work, but it was a lesson, you know, it's all all valuable lessons
[01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:13.250]  No such thing. Not everything is all perfectly green. There's some shit. You don't want to see in these pockets over here
[01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:16.210]  But we try I give it my best shot man, you know
[01:50:17.170 --> 01:50:23.810]  Hey, you know sometimes the coolest shit comes out of testing and playing with it. Like you just accidentally stumble upon this shit
[01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:32.130]  um, I think nick risden made a made a cross that was just insane because he missed the hermey branch and it powdered up or
[01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:34.530]  Pollined up the another plant
[01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:39.410]  Uh, kevin jodrey grew some of it out up on his up on his hill and uh for him to grow it out
[01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:44.850]  There's got to be something special there. So yeah, it's nothing but lessons man. No failures. They're just lessons
[01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:46.930]  Yeah, man
[01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:50.210]  No bad trips just lessons. Oh, man, brother. Amen
[01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:56.450]  Howard root rise microbes or a great white brand. I have not had a chance to play with them
[01:50:56.530 --> 01:51:00.690]  I mean I am blessed I do a shit ton of beta testing products. Um,
[01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:03.490]  So hey, yeah, if those guys want to shoot something out
[01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:05.490]  I'll definitely scope it let you know what I think
[01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:11.170]  Uh and post it up for for everybody to know but i'll let them know first and let them decide whether they want
[01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:17.730]  That kind of information released. I've seen great white on every hydro store since i've been going to hydro stores, man
[01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:23.890]  I'm saying that yeah, you know i'm always leery of bugs in a jug and i'll tell you why because
[01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:30.370]  If if they're not living in there, they're either consuming something and releasing something
[01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:33.570]  you know, that's one of the things like em1 is badass because
[01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:39.810]  One organism is pooping something the other one's eating it and vice versa all the way through the three main organisms
[01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:45.330]  So there's a a prime example of what I would consider a living culture that can sustain itself
[01:51:45.730 --> 01:51:49.810]  But for the most part every time i've ever worked with any of these, you know bugs in a jug
[01:51:49.890 --> 01:51:51.890]  It's they they're either ph suspended
[01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:55.650]  Which means that they've locked them out, uh, either low or high ph
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:52:03.170]  And then when you go to use them now, you're fucking up your ph and worse yet you lose diversity and the vast majority cannot
[01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:09.010]  Uh cyst up in that situation and therefore they become what I want to call nutrient solution
[01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:13.650]  So yeah, if you take my product products and you just let them cook, you know
[01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:16.290]  Just let them get really nasty anaerobic and stinky
[01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:23.330]  They're still going to have a nutrient pump. They're still going to release all of the stuff that's inside of their bodies plant available
[01:52:23.730 --> 01:52:27.250]  The problem is when it rains or your water you're flushing it all out
[01:52:27.730 --> 01:52:33.970]  And that's the whole goal here is to get living biology into the soil so it can function and slow release
[01:52:34.290 --> 01:52:41.490]  Uh and keep producing itself not just instant, you know solution that that you know gets chewed up and disappears
[01:52:41.490 --> 01:52:44.790]  So it's all about colonization not neutral nutrients
[01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:48.270]  Sorry got stumbled on that one
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.060]  Oh that laden, can I ask you a question?
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:02.540]  So when we get dive deeper into like how important calcium is
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:07.900]  I know even you and I have discussed this before but I was hoping that you would talk with the uh, the viewers on that
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:14.220]  Um, just how important calcium not only is to the plant but also to the microbial calcium is a foundation of everything
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.260]  um, you know in the ratio, it's like
[01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:23.200]  Four three one or four two one. So that's four parts calcium
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:26.800]  two parts magnesium one part potassium
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:33.420]  So in and the only way to get that is a saturated paste test, which most people don't get or don't ask for
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:38.300]  I like a little bit logan labs because I think they just include that automatically in the package
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:45.900]  Um, but those ratios are critical and this is where you know, I was playing with michael's stuff and and his stuff is definitely
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:47.660]  cal heavy
[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:53.680]  Um, but again, he's mixing it with other things. Uh, and I won't get into all the formulation
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:58.720]  But I definitely saw something that was unique and was outside of that traditional
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.420]  Cal mag potassium formula
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:06.620]  Um, and I have to attribute it to the work beyond just that. Um,
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:10.400]  But yeah calcium is is probably one of the biggest deficiencies
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:16.880]  And if that ratio is balanced correctly and the plants are healthy and you have a proper microbial
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:24.780]  communities in the soil, um that calcium will really help protect the plant from falling over from
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:31.580]  Uh, you know branches breaking off the calcium is the foundation the strength the concrete in the cell
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.500]  Uh the plant cell
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:37.740]  And then then you get into some other things like you're adding in like a fulvic acid
[01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:44.060]  Which really increases the strength and helps to bind those calcium atoms on a molecular level
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:51.260]  But not now i'm getting probably a little too deep but calcium is really really important and and often overlooked. Uh nutrient
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:55.980]  And what are some uh
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.060]  sources of calcium that
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:59.400]  are
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:01.260]  cost-effective and
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:02.700]  readily available
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:08.780]  All right, so that's some more of michael's work and you know, this will all become available soon enough
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:13.420]  But he's found some resources similar to soilscape solutions phyllo skier
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.060]  um that is really plant available and
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.540]  It's by doing by taking this approach, right? Think about it like this
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.100]  Um, if the plant doesn't have to expend half of its energy
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:29.120]  Making exudates and excreting it down and feeding the biology
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.740]  Um, and it can just uptake these nutrients which the biology would actually have been doing is breaking down the calcium and magnesium
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.360]  In in the soil structure and then releasing it back
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:45.940]  The plant doesn't have to work that hard. So now now the plants has these nutrients on its leaves fully
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:47.520]  and
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:51.380]  Therefore it's not it's not being forced to to provide as much exudates
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.800]  Down into the soil, which is an energy exchange
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:01.840]  Um, so therefore it can spend more time either stretching or setting up bud sites or actually producing flowers
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.480]  So, you know that is the future
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:11.040]  Um, you know kev kev proved it to me, you know a couple years back and on some of the work he did with soilscape solutions
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.120]  phyllos product
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.040]  Um, you know because he's on top of a mountain man
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:20.800]  He's got freaking 80 degree temperature swings and from day to night and the wind is freaking insane up there
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.560]  And when he showed me how heavily they stacked
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.880]  Uh, I was I was like, all right
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:33.520]  What what are you doing? And so we deep dove down that and we chopped it up about hey, you know, this is probably
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.480]  Allowing the plant to express itself
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.740]  More than just try to fucking survive up there in that extremes
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:48.640]  And yeah, he dropped me a couple of nugs when I saw him, uh last of some, uh, cherry pie and oh bam
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.040]  That shit's greasy
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:58.480]  I had to be real careful when I was playing with that shit. Uh, but that goes to prove to you that there's definitely something to
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.780]  Um not making the plant work so hard so it can really express its genetics
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:09.940]  And hit its full potential and yields, um, you know and and these volatile compounds like terpene production
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.720]  so, um, yeah, i'm a big fan of feeding the soil and the plant and I think that's going to be uh,
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.800]  the future of of you know
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:26.560]  High value crop production is is taking that, you know, give the plant a little bit of slack so it can it can perform
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:28.880]  but also feed the soil so that
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:35.920]  The soil is as healthy as the plant and then the combination, you know is pushing you toward what I would consider full plant potential
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:41.680]  And it's going to be easier for everybody once they learn this shit because you don't have to go and pump
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.040]  Shit and mix reservoirs all day. You just kind of just let it be once you figure out, you know any given no-till
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:52.080]  Or something like that and your shit's going to be better
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.600]  Yeah, yeah, and and your seeds are more potent or your or your cannabis is going to be more potent
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:03.280]  And yes gypsum gypsum is under rated a lot of people like, you know, oh don't throw gypsum
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.440]  Again, you got to be you know on top of your chemistry here
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.320]  You can't just be like oh i'm gonna use i'm gonna use i'm gonna be a moron just throw a whole bunch of gypsum down
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:15.680]  If you don't need it, you're gonna cause fucking problems. So
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.800]  uh again test test test
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:23.520]  Do small incremental adjustments. Don't just get fucking stupid
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:28.160]  And and then after you've done the amendment, you know a couple weeks later test again
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.720]  I mean what you're trying to do is hit that sweet spot that that perfect
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:39.760]  Vibration in the soil that everything is there if the plant needs it and not in excess as soon as you get
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:45.840]  Excessive you're going to have lockout and that's going to cause pest pressure. This is more less is more when it comes to growing
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.840]  Absolutely
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:54.160]  Don't go and use the biggest freaking dose on something start from the bottom and work your way up whatever it is
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:56.720]  I've always found that helpful
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:01.840]  Thank you, brother. Thank you for pounding that home because you know so many times I hear horror stories
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:06.320]  Oh, yeah, I was using knf and I I did 25 to 1 dilution. I'm like dude
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:11.760]  That's a fucking 1000 to 1 dilution. What the fuck are you doing? Oh, you're just dropping it in there
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:17.840]  A little is good more is better. Yeah, moron fucking keep it up man. Don't complain when you fuck shit up
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.440]  Yeah, five mls per gallon, baby
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:26.960]  That's that's that's usually what I kind of use, uh when it comes to knf any given solution
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:32.080]  And even then work from your bottom way up use less if you can't use three five
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:34.640]  Work your way up in there
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:39.600]  And then you got to remember there's a lot of shit that you're creating in those ferments. So there's a way you can
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.680]  Say if there's good and bad in there, you got to show me who that guy is
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:46.880]  you know what I mean because any given ferment is new because
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.560]  it's like
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:55.760]  fucking a lot of people are probably grabbing stuff from the grocery store and fermenting bananas trying to get potassium, but
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.560]  These bananas, you know, they come from some
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:04.240]  Farm, you don't know what the fuck they're doing there. So probably has pesticides spread all over the banana
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:06.720]  And you're fermenting that shit
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:10.800]  And you know that the nutrient value is low because it was all jacked up on mpk
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:16.180]  And you ain't getting fucking nutrients out of the soil when you grow that way you're feeding your plants mcdonald's
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.600]  Big max
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.840]  That's gonna go well
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.080]  Yeah
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.960]  No, yeah, you really if you're gonna if you're gonna dabble in
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.760]  um playing with
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.120]  Nf which is what we americanized it and call it
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:41.840]  Knf, but the whole rest of the world calls us natural farming or nf and it was actually invented in japan. Uh to begin with so
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:48.820]  Uh, anyway, yeah, if you're gonna go down the rabbit hole be responsible follow the fucking directions
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:55.940]  You know don't be all experiment like you think you're smarter this is thousands of years of hard work and
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:02.260]  Lessons to get to that far. Um, yeah that pop up on the wca. Yeah, I love that shit. Uh,
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.300]  You know all of these nutrients again
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:09.380]  Have been formulated from natural things. Um, they are
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:16.580]  Plant available because they've been fermented in a way that the bacteria are not going to have to spend a lot of energy
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:20.740]  Mining them they'll just be able to consume them and and release them right away
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.260]  Uh plant available or or to some degree, you know
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:28.500]  The the colonization of the leaves themselves will have the necessary bacteria to release it
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.580]  Instead of pumping all the exudates down and then sucking all the nutrients back up
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:41.780]  I'm a big fan of morning big fan of morning before the fucking sun comes up or just as it's coming up
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:48.500]  Um, or a little bit at night doesn't hurt because you know, the plant's going to shut down a lot of its work, you know at night
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:55.380]  Um, so it'll be available for for the plant as it slows down, but I think you know breakfast
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.860]  An important meal so, you know
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:03.460]  If you're going to feed feed really early in the morning, but not not at fucking high to high high noon
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:06.020]  You're you're going to stress your fucking plan out
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:11.780]  And people forage for knf in the morning because the plant up takes all the nutrients in the morning
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:17.460]  I'd imagine that's kind of the same thing when you're feeding and then it's kind of like sucking up all that stuff into the plant
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.820]  that's just my two cents on that, you know as opposed to
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:23.560]  When it's going to sleep a lot of the activities
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:29.060]  Going to sleep right spot on dude spot on. That's that's why they do that
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:34.100]  That's why they harvest the the plants and nf first thing in the morning because that's when they're charging
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:39.460]  Uh breakfast of champions, I love it and i'm sorry I lost that last one but uh, you know
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:44.260]  There's dolmenic line is is completely different than calcitic lime. So, you know
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:48.680]  Understand that calcitic lime is more heavily in in calcium
[02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:53.780]  Um, so if that's if you're looking for a source of calcium, um, that's where you start
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:59.060]  But remember you're fucking your ph up, you know, so again, you got to be really careful about this shit
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:05.540]  Uh, yes, of course the the finer the lime is the easier it is for it to be broken down
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:10.600]  Lime flower is by far the best but again, you have to be careful about application
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:14.900]  If it's if it's in the summer months and the soil's hot you're gonna fucking do some damage
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:20.580]  So you really gotta learn what you're doing and the difference between the two. Oh god. Yes. I love
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.220]  Biodynamics, you know people laughed at me when I first started talking about that years ago planting on the moons harvesting on the moons
[02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:31.380]  You know the 501 through the 507 or 8 I think it is
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:35.060]  The 500s are the preps made and basically you take
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:41.880]  Cow manure you put it in a horn you bury it at a certain time, you know in the fall at the right direction
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:47.780]  And then you come back in spring and guess what that is. It's a fucking imo collection man. That's all it is
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:53.320]  That stinky nasty cow poop that you buried now smells like forest inoculant
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:57.880]  So, I mean gene gene has a video where he talks about the natives
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:02.080]  harvesting trees for their bowls when the full moon was out because all the
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.520]  Energy was in the wood and he put that perspective in harvesting for flower, you know
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.280]  Preserving the taste even more so because he harvests whenever he can
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.160]  Can on the full moon, you know what I mean? Whenever you know, and he keeps that in perspective
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:19.160]  So the moon's got a lot to do with
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:25.840]  Growing that's for sure and how humans act that's for sure. All right. I mean, come on how much percentage of we are water
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:32.480]  So to think that we would not be affected like the ocean high tide low tide are directly affected by
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.400]  Full moons and new moons. So to think to think that that doesn't have something to do with everything
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.920]  You're is foolish. You're being arrogant
[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:48.280]  Yeah, right and look at astrology man, I mean you're born in a certain chart at a certain time
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:53.280]  You're gonna have these tendencies and you can't tell me that shit don't fucking work if you're dealing with
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Scary when you're reading
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:10.440]  No, but the people I've worked with that are what I want to consider
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:15.640]  really solid in the understanding and knowledge of birth charts and
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.200]  Rotational pulls of different planets because that's what it is
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.780]  The planets are no different than the fucking moon man when they're close enough to pull in one way when they're further enough away
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.920]  They have less of an effect. So all of this goes back to
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.640]  Biodynamics is that you're using?
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.320]  magnetic pulls as a
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.420]  as a force in the way you're
[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:43.640]  Relating to or harvesting or taking care of your plants and there's definitely something to it. I mean that ain't fucking woo-woo
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.560]  But you know teach their own straight up
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.860]  All right, boys, you know, I mean I do the whole teaming series with
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:04.220]  Lohenfeld's but what do you guys recommend for for people that want to you know, really dive down the understanding of the cannibals plan
[02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:16.300]  It's my book and it's a Masonic's guide to pollination
[02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:18.620]  I heard about that
[02:06:18.620 --> 02:06:24.240]  Nice, I teach you how to pollinate in one simple. I friendly book
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.580]  beautiful
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.580]  All right. What are you gonna do the next one?
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:35.960]  I'm doing the coloring book and I'm dropping issue to issue two is gonna be on simple can that permits nice nice
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:41.420]  All right, then water soluble calcium from fish amino acids, you know some easy stuff
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:48.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah nice and I think you I think you've got to go to the next level and do a deep dive on the
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:50.080]  history of the cannabis plant
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:56.900]  Well, this is actually the
[02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:00.020]  Illegalization of weed in America. This is a good read too
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:06.220]  But it has nothing to do on how to grow weed, but it gives you a lot of perspective on what we smoke every single day
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:08.300]  nice
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:09.700]  Yeah
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:15.460]  Yeah, there's there's a lot of good books coming out. I think that now people are more mainstream about
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.260]  understanding, you know the relationship between
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:20.940]  the soil
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:26.540]  Biota and the plant itself, you know, I still use this phrase to date and that's you know
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:29.740]  What Leonardo da Vinci stated back in 1735?
[02:07:29.740 --> 02:07:36.780]  I believe that we know more about the movement of the celestial bodies overhead that we know about the soil underfoot
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:44.060]  And yeah, we're fucking getting ready to land on Mars and build space fucking colonies on the moon and what the fuck man
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:47.740]  We got half of our world is polluted because of the shit we've been doing in the past
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:53.580]  Let's you know, let's reel back a little here peeps and you know, let's let's fix the shit here before we go
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:08:01.480]  You know blasting off to fucking colonize other fucking planets. It's fucking insanity, but sorry didn't mean to soapbox that one
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:03.800]  Do
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:09.080]  You worry about pollen drift seeing that you're outdoors, I mean I grow in Compton, California
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:12.360]  I'm not in like some place where dude has a cash crop next door
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:17.460]  My next-door neighbor works at Metro the next one to him. They all have nine to five jobs
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:24.000]  This open pollen shit is irrelevant to me compromising anybody's crop my neighbor Cory grows
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:29.360]  He brought me some flour. There's like one seed in every fucking three ounces of it
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:35.000]  I mean like there's no pollen drift going on over here and it's just one mouth that's hitting everything
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:37.280]  You know
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.520]  Yeah, it's definitely an issue in the hemp industry
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.240]  I've had some peeps in New Mexico that got pretty frustrated with a
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:52.640]  careless grower who didn't know what he was doing and just thought he was gonna have a great cash crop and he fucking
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:57.520]  Cross-pollinated like I don't know three or four other grows that were being really responsible
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:02.160]  You know, I know that you know, there were there was talk of making pollen bombs, you know
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.800]  You're making some seeds and throwing them and you know, they're throwing them off the side of the road
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:07.120]  but I
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:14.080]  Hope people are understanding that you know that can really fuck somebody up if you're doing it and to be careful with pollen for sure
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:21.500]  Yeah, like if anything I was the guinea pig that started growing here not to be like, oh, this is my stomping grounds
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:24.440]  Like dude, I've been doing this shit before it was cool here
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:29.840]  You know, like I really put my fucking neck out there to be able to grow let alone start breeding here
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.320]  You know, I used to I used to grow for you know, cash crop get a little money
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:36.840]  So now it's all like I got Wilson now and trust me
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:42.120]  It's like my neighbor has plants that aren't fucking fully seated. That's my
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.080]  science behind
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:51.800]  pollen straying all over the fucking LA like LA madness and Wilson seeds everywhere like like the shit and like
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:59.320]  If people shits fucking pollinate that's because they freaking have a Mel in their garden that they forgot to pull and usually that's the case
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.320]  You know
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:04.660]  Can I grow my ladies next to you so Wilson can pimp them out
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:16.680]  You grow them close enough you might get a stray the stray seed here their best way to keep them out
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:19.440]  I like to keep them in veg and whenever you need them
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.720]  You just take a clone off and go get them to work. You know what I mean?
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:29.840]  But but you really got to keep them in veg like as soon as they show because once those pollen sacks start forming
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:34.320]  Like it's like a fucking snowball and if you don't catch it early enough when you find your mouth
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:39.600]  Then you're you're in for a treat. You're not gonna have a mouth. You're gonna have a mouth that died
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.220]  fucking whatever reasons
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:48.760]  Peter
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.760]  Stressed them
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.640]  The the males do I purpley no?
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:57.360]  No, I just let him I just let him show and I always keep cuts of everything even before anything sexist
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:59.360]  so I see what everything kind of looks like and
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.060]  I always you know have something to backtrack on
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:10.160]  Kill, you know everything as they show I'm always left with one good Mel and that's what I use right now
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.920]  I use my Wilson f2 Mel and I'm gonna back cross everything to right now
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.840]  You ever fucked around with nitrogen sickness to as to get a plant to Herme
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:22.200]  No, I've never I've never stressed a plant like that
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:28.720]  the only way I stress a plant is like me fucking being a shitty gardener and putting too much kelp or you know
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.240]  LST low stress training simple things like that. It's never been like a
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.800]  An intentional stress besides LST or a shitty hiccup in my gardening
[02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:45.030]  Put a strobe light on it
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:50.020]  Yeah, do you ever play music to your plants do
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:55.140]  There's some there's some new
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.540]  stuff coming out on
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.420]  Well, you have to understand that the vibration of the planet as I think
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.260]  3.21
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:08.380]  I think that our all of our instruments are tuned at
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:15.980]  3.18 so there's a variation of what the harmony of the planet versus the harmony of
[02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:23.580]  what we tune instruments to but there's some cats that have been fucking around with that that vibration and
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:27.060]  Apparently, it's it's it's it's getting some traction
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:28.420]  You know
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:34.540]  I keep in my eye out on it and you know as as I have time and more information and time to you know
[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:39.220]  Chase it I will but you know, that was that was an old thing when I was growing up that they oh, yeah
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:44.040]  You got to play rock and roll or you got to play fucking classical to your plant to see what to happen
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:50.840]  Good yeah, there's some shit to it for sure. One room was playing rap music one room didn't have music
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:56.200]  You know the one with classical music produced the best, you know, who knows that that'd be cool
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:02.360]  You know somebody has to really and somebody is like you said somebody's over there actually charting that stuff. That's gnarly
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.600]  Yeah, my buddies on IG
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.440]  livity
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:11.440]  They've always got music in the background when they're working and they've got I think eight or nine rooms
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:18.160]  Completely environmentally controlled and if you look at the fucking porn they're putting up on IG, you're just like whoa
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:24.920]  I mean, they're they're fucking bussing a move big-time and I gotta believe them plants are liking the music they're playing for sure
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.800]  Here in Denver, Denver, Colorado
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:33.400]  I believe in like the the 60s or the 70s that was trying to do a demonstration on that
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.760]  And she was playing the plants like classical music and then hard rock and roll and supposedly, you know
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.200]  Her conclusions was that the the classical music helped the plant grow
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.480]  Are you familiar with that study at all later? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I grew up with it, man
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:51.280]  That's that was what I was talking about because I you know, I was born in 63

[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:48.980]  But you know, I just didn't wasn't consistent in my side-by-side experiment. But yeah that that was that was what it was all about
