[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  days of dry up here. Michigan like trying to drive here in Michigan compared to Kentucky
[00:06.600 --> 00:10.800]  where I've been. I mean it's a it's a long process. So.
[00:10.800 --> 00:21.660]  Dude, one of these days you got to take us stoners to the Kentucky Derby.
[00:21.660 --> 00:30.140]  Man, we can have a blast at the Derby. I've been to about, I don't know, 12 of them. 11
[00:30.140 --> 00:38.100]  of them. And been in different parts of the Derby. The infield is, it is just debauchery
[00:38.100 --> 00:45.780]  to a different level. But it was pretty wild seeing it ran today being September and nobody
[00:45.780 --> 00:51.140]  in the infield or the crowds. So. But the Derby is a fun time.
[00:51.140 --> 01:01.660]  All right. So by the way, we are now live on YouTube. All right. So tonight we're raising
[01:01.660 --> 01:09.980]  money for Food Not Bombs. We are a little more energized than last night. And we got
[01:09.980 --> 01:15.260]  our ringer. We got Nick. He's going to hype everything up.
[01:15.260 --> 01:16.740]  Yeah.
[01:17.740 --> 01:26.500]  Why don't we, Leo, you want to start? So basically just to kind of give people the
[01:26.500 --> 01:33.900]  background. So Food Not Bombs, they're all over the country, but specifically in Santa
[01:33.900 --> 01:40.860]  Cruz right now. This guy Keith McHenry, who's going to be joining us. He's actually feeding
[01:40.860 --> 01:44.940]  people right now and then he's driving home and then he's going to jump on with us and
[01:44.940 --> 01:49.540]  kind of talk about what's going on and what he's seen on the ground. But, you know, they
[01:49.540 --> 01:55.940]  could use food, they could use tents, they could use blankets. And that's what we're
[01:55.940 --> 02:03.220]  raising money for. So let us raise a lot of money for Food Not Bombs. And we're going
[02:03.220 --> 02:10.180]  to kick things off with blockchain novelty. Is it novelties or novelty?
[02:10.220 --> 02:12.420]  Novelties. Blockchain.com.
[02:12.420 --> 02:17.780]  The S is so important. I was just saying last night, the fucking S.
[02:17.780 --> 02:18.780]  The hats?
[02:18.780 --> 02:19.780]  The S.
[02:19.780 --> 02:22.780]  Oh, the blockchain novelties.
[02:22.780 --> 02:26.780]  I remember last night.
[02:26.780 --> 02:30.780]  So what we got up is a pack of Longpoint Lime Sour. There's 50...
[02:30.780 --> 02:32.780]  What do you got there?
[02:32.780 --> 02:33.780]  What's that?
[02:33.780 --> 02:36.780]  Nick, you got the fucking, the garden.
[02:37.380 --> 02:41.380]  Oh yeah, I bought that from you at the Regenerative C Company.
[02:41.380 --> 02:44.380]  Oh, they got that at the conference too.
[02:44.380 --> 02:54.980]  At the Regenerative Conference out in Humboldt. So I broke my rolling tray. So I was reading
[02:54.980 --> 02:58.380]  this and it just became a rolling tray real quick.
[02:58.380 --> 03:03.380]  I've never seen that. Can you tell us what it is?
[03:03.980 --> 03:08.980]  It's a comic book that... Here, I'll dump this shit off here. I got plenty of stuff.
[03:08.980 --> 03:16.980]  It's a comic book that Jesse did and different people did. And it's really wrote out very
[03:16.980 --> 03:25.980]  simple on different methods of just regenerative agriculture, man. And it's really awesome.
[03:25.980 --> 03:31.980]  And what's even better about it is I've got a niece and when she saw this, she thought
[03:31.980 --> 03:35.980]  this was cool as could be. And she started reading it and she's seven years old. So the
[03:35.980 --> 03:43.580]  fact that she read a comic about regenerative agriculture was pretty awesome. But that's
[03:43.580 --> 03:44.580]  Jesse's thing.
[03:44.580 --> 03:46.580]  I had no idea.
[03:46.580 --> 03:52.580]  Now they have me as a comic book character inside of it too. And some of the passages.
[03:52.580 --> 03:56.580]  Yeah, it's fucking awesome to get turned into a comic book character.
[03:56.580 --> 03:59.580]  It's so crazy. It was like in print first.
[04:00.180 --> 04:05.180]  And then it's in Dutch and Spanish and Italian now.
[04:05.180 --> 04:12.180]  10 years ago you go to prison. Now you get made into a comic book character. I'm loving how it's all changing.
[04:16.180 --> 04:21.180]  I want to ask about it, but I also want to give Leo a chance because he's in the tattoo part.
[04:21.180 --> 04:22.180]  Yeah, let's do it.
[04:22.180 --> 04:27.180]  Oh no, it's fine. I'm just chilling, guys. I'm hanging out with all y'all. So I was basically just trying
[04:27.780 --> 04:34.780]  to explain what's going on here. We do have graphics for the terpene ratings on that Longpoint Lime Sour.
[04:34.780 --> 04:40.780]  It's two sour diesels from the Humboldt area mixed with the Black Lime Reserve.
[04:40.780 --> 04:48.780]  And these genetics I got, we actually got these from one of Mean Jeans auctions for Nikko.
[04:48.780 --> 04:52.780]  I ended up paying four racks for that main pack in the picture right there.
[04:52.780 --> 04:54.780]  And it was one of the best things I ever did.
[04:55.380 --> 05:01.380]  For Mandelbrot's son, by the way, to just give context for everyone on that.
[05:01.380 --> 05:06.380]  Right. Yeah. So basically what it turned out to be is I did some hunts on that.
[05:06.380 --> 05:09.380]  And what we started calling it was Sour on Steroids.
[05:09.380 --> 05:12.380]  It's basically one of the best sour diesels I've ever run across.
[05:12.380 --> 05:18.380]  That's how I picture it. It's basically a sour diesel plus, you know?
[05:18.980 --> 05:25.980]  Okay. So let me pull up the... Yeah. And we can take our time starting the clock on this one.
[05:25.980 --> 05:31.980]  Let some more people come into the room. So let me grab the other pictures too.
[05:31.980 --> 05:32.980]  Oh, fuck.
[05:33.980 --> 05:38.980]  Yeah. So what was the original pack you bought? Was it bigger? Obviously bigger.
[05:38.980 --> 05:42.980]  That is the pack in the picture right there. The entire pack that I got.
[05:43.580 --> 05:50.580]  Basically, it was the entire reader pack. He basically threw it to the wind and was like,
[05:50.580 --> 05:53.580]  I have the ones that I'm working with for all my terpene extraction.
[05:53.580 --> 05:58.580]  So I'm going to put this up for the auction for Niko. And that's the one I ended up picking up.
[06:00.580 --> 06:04.580]  Award-winning terps. He primarily does terpene extraction with that.
[06:06.910 --> 06:12.910]  Okay. So here we have some awards. Here we have...
[06:13.510 --> 06:16.510]  Oh shit. Is that limonene? Holy shit.
[06:16.510 --> 06:19.510]  Yeah, you need that out loud. That's the important part.
[06:19.510 --> 06:20.510]  Holy shit.
[06:20.510 --> 06:21.510]  That's a real seller here.
[06:21.510 --> 06:23.510]  Those are insane. That's fucking incredible.
[06:23.510 --> 06:25.510]  It's off the charts. It's sour on steroids.
[06:28.510 --> 06:29.510]  Okay. Wow.
[06:30.510 --> 06:31.510]  Yeah.
[06:31.510 --> 06:35.510]  Thank you for putting up these terpenes. Holy shit. This says everything. Wow.
[06:36.510 --> 06:37.510]  Wow.
[06:38.510 --> 06:39.510]  That's what you get.
[06:40.110 --> 06:46.110]  Might be a dumb question, but it's 22% of what? 22% of...
[06:46.110 --> 06:48.110]  That's limonene on top.
[06:48.110 --> 06:52.110]  Right. Right. But what's like... Did it have a mass?
[06:53.110 --> 06:55.110]  Oh, that's the percentage of the terpenes divided up.
[06:55.110 --> 06:56.110]  Right. Right.
[06:57.110 --> 07:02.110]  Oh, wait. No, no, no. Or is that for... No, no, no. That's not total. Yeah, you're right.
[07:02.110 --> 07:06.110]  Right. That's the percentage of the overall terpenes. So what I'm getting at is like,
[07:06.710 --> 07:08.710]  what was the overall terpenes?
[07:09.710 --> 07:11.710]  Do you have the total terpenes?
[07:11.710 --> 07:16.710]  There should be some more graphics you can throw up there. Like all the analysis I forwarded to him.
[07:17.710 --> 07:19.710]  It's hard for me to read on this little screen.
[07:19.710 --> 07:20.710]  Totally.
[07:20.710 --> 07:21.710]  No problem. There it is.
[07:21.710 --> 07:23.710]  Well, wait. I spoke too soon.
[07:24.710 --> 07:26.710]  Are those cannabinoids?
[07:26.710 --> 07:27.710]  That's cannabinoids.
[07:27.710 --> 07:32.710]  It has terpene here, but it doesn't have the... No, it doesn't have the information on terpenes on that.
[07:32.710 --> 07:33.710]  Gotcha.
[07:34.310 --> 07:37.310]  Keep going. Is there any more tests besides?
[07:38.310 --> 07:40.310]  That was all the slides I got.
[07:41.310 --> 07:44.310]  That's pretty awesome, though. 22% of whatever it was.
[07:44.310 --> 07:48.310]  Well, climate can dominate like that too. Beta carotene filing like right after.
[07:50.310 --> 07:52.310]  Yeah, it's just huge. That doesn't happen.
[07:52.310 --> 07:55.310]  Wait. Go to the bottom. What's on the bottom? It says total.
[07:55.310 --> 07:56.310]  Oh, wow.
[07:56.310 --> 07:58.310]  Go to the bottom of...
[07:58.310 --> 07:59.310]  Oh, there it is.
[08:01.310 --> 08:02.310]  959.
[08:02.910 --> 08:11.910]  That's the total. That's a total terpene analysis, not the percentage of terpenes to plant material.
[08:13.910 --> 08:15.910]  And there's 29 unknowns.
[08:15.910 --> 08:20.910]  It's cool that the caryophyllene is almost one to one with the limonene, though. That's awesome.
[08:20.910 --> 08:26.910]  Well, limonene dom is kind of rare. That's very rare, actually.
[08:27.510 --> 08:32.510]  I'm not personally a big fan of limonene myself, but I see the potential for it for sure.
[08:32.510 --> 08:33.510]  Oh, man.
[08:34.510 --> 08:39.510]  I know there's people that are. They just geek out over it. But it doesn't do it for me.
[08:46.150 --> 08:47.150]  That's awesome, though.
[08:54.150 --> 08:56.150]  Oh, it's milligrams per gram.
[08:56.150 --> 08:57.150]  Yep.
[08:57.150 --> 08:58.150]  Right here?
[08:58.750 --> 08:59.750]  It's underneath the mass.
[09:00.750 --> 09:06.750]  Well, let's get an auction going on this now that we got an idea of what we're dealing with.
[09:10.750 --> 09:14.750]  Cascading, can you get us again with the timer in the chat? I'm on my mobile again.
[09:15.750 --> 09:18.750]  I just kind of clued myself into what's going on here.
[09:18.750 --> 09:21.750]  Yeah, we're just kind of figuring it out, too.
[09:22.350 --> 09:28.350]  But what should we start? What should we start this out off, Leo? Give us a baseline here.
[09:28.350 --> 09:31.350]  You paid four racks for the pack.
[09:31.350 --> 09:35.350]  Yeah, I paid four racks for the pack and it's completely unreleased.
[09:36.350 --> 09:39.350]  I'll leave that in your guys' hands.
[09:39.350 --> 09:47.350]  Don't put that in my hands because I feel weird about it. So throw a baseline out there and then we'll do our best to get as much as we can for it.
[09:47.350 --> 09:50.350]  I'd say at least start at a couple of bills, you know?
[09:50.950 --> 09:51.950]  Yeah.
[09:51.950 --> 09:53.950]  I mean, like five?
[09:54.950 --> 09:55.950]  Yeah, probably.
[09:56.950 --> 09:57.950]  Five in the face.
[09:57.950 --> 09:58.950]  Done.
[09:59.950 --> 10:02.950]  It's like, fuck.
[10:03.950 --> 10:04.950]  I missed what strain it was.
[10:04.950 --> 10:05.950]  Potential in that is insane.
[10:06.950 --> 10:12.950]  That you can do a hunt and carry that on forever. And like I said, very, very few people have that.
[10:17.670 --> 10:19.670]  Nick, what are your thoughts? Let's see that look on your face.
[10:20.270 --> 10:25.270]  I was just about to be like, I was like, Nick, we don't have any money. But if we did.
[10:28.270 --> 10:34.270]  I'm sitting here trying not to bid on anything. I'm dealing with the first time ever.
[10:35.270 --> 10:43.270]  I went through russet mites for the first time three weeks ago and I misdiagnosed it and I lost like 40% of my genetics at one location.
[10:43.870 --> 10:47.870]  And I'm sitting here looking at this and Shannon's like shaking her head no.
[10:47.870 --> 10:50.870]  And then she gave me a thumbs up. What the fuck does that mean?
[10:50.870 --> 10:53.870]  That's like a no you can't bid, yes you can bid.
[10:55.870 --> 10:59.870]  But I would love to see that Leo put back into Rural Kush.
[10:59.870 --> 11:01.870]  You've already got sire diesel, sire diesel there.
[11:02.870 --> 11:06.870]  I mean, you saw the percentages on that thing. It has so much potential for real.
[11:07.470 --> 11:13.470]  Yeah, that gives you like three points of sire diesel on that Rural Kush.
[11:13.470 --> 11:22.470]  And I like the sire diesel terpenes that come out of the rural more so than like the floral or the fruit lines.
[11:22.470 --> 11:24.470]  And getting that chemical.
[11:25.470 --> 11:26.470]  Go ahead.
[11:27.470 --> 11:30.470]  Straight lemon gas with a little bit of that lime on the back end.
[11:31.070 --> 11:37.070]  Yeah, and like on the Royals I'm really trying to hunt through right now on this mashup are the ones that
[11:39.070 --> 11:51.070]  For the guys that are 40 or above, I don't know if you remember the smell of those home perms that your mom and your aunts would do back in like the late 80s and early 90s.
[11:51.070 --> 11:56.070]  Are you kidding me? I had a short long and I had my mom perm that shit for me.
[11:56.070 --> 11:58.070]  I'm just gonna say that right now.
[11:58.670 --> 12:03.670]  Don't ever tell anybody that story again, Josh. Don't ever tell anybody that story again.
[12:04.670 --> 12:08.670]  But that chemical perm smell is what I'm looking for.
[12:09.670 --> 12:12.670]  Now I'm looking for a picture of Josh with that fucking perm.
[12:14.670 --> 12:16.670]  Josh, you gotta dig one up.
[12:17.670 --> 12:22.670]  And you throw that sire diesel, sire diesel, black lime reserve back into that Royal.
[12:23.270 --> 12:29.270]  And I mean, Lord, there should be some chemical fermented fruit smells in there.
[12:29.270 --> 12:31.270]  So that would be lovely.
[12:32.270 --> 12:34.270]  The only smell you get out of that is the lime.
[12:36.270 --> 12:42.270]  It's just gas. It's gas and lemons. That's what it's coming out of. Gas and lime.
[12:43.270 --> 12:51.270]  But you can get some like cases of certain strains that even though it's fruit, the fruit goes so sour it's almost a fermented danish fruit.
[12:51.870 --> 12:55.870]  No, exactly. And a lot of the stuff from Jackson gets that. It's one of my favorite things.
[12:56.870 --> 12:59.870]  Exactly, because I'm into more Jackson stuff than you.
[13:02.870 --> 13:08.870]  Josh is hopefully digging up that video because my mom just sent me this. This is from 1981.
[13:11.870 --> 13:12.870]  What were you eating?
[13:13.870 --> 13:14.870]  It must have been chocolate.
[13:15.870 --> 13:16.870]  Yeah, it's definitely chocolate.
[13:17.870 --> 13:19.870]  How much air do I get? Like one pound or something?
[13:23.270 --> 13:24.270]  All right. So what are we at?
[13:27.270 --> 13:34.270]  Yeah, Ezekiel asked if people can snipe. Yeah, I think some people don't like that. Other people...
[13:36.270 --> 13:39.270]  Whatever. Nobody likes being sniped. That's the way it goes.
[13:40.270 --> 13:49.270]  This is about charity. If we can raise 50 extra cents for charity, then snipes is absolutely fine.
[13:49.870 --> 13:52.870]  How about we give the person who has sniped one last chance to...
[13:53.870 --> 13:54.870]  Call it?
[13:55.870 --> 13:56.870]  You can snipe back.
[13:57.870 --> 13:58.870]  Yeah, you can snipe back.
[13:59.870 --> 14:00.870]  Do extensions.
[14:03.870 --> 14:08.870]  The thought was that if someone's going to keep it going, we aren't going to shut it down because we're trying to raise money.
[14:11.870 --> 14:18.870]  Hey, Peter, can you put that picture back up of you with the perm, man? I didn't get a screenshot of that. So I need to screenshot that real quick.
[14:19.870 --> 14:20.870]  For future memes and stuff.
[14:21.870 --> 14:22.870]  Wait, of me?
[14:23.870 --> 14:24.870]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[14:27.870 --> 14:31.870]  Yeah, there you go. I just screenshotted that one.
[14:33.870 --> 14:34.870]  Went in.
[14:35.870 --> 14:37.870]  You're rocking a turtleneck too in that picture. I just want to point that out.
[14:38.470 --> 14:43.470]  So all my clothes were hand-me-downs and my oldest brother is nine years older than me.
[14:44.470 --> 14:53.470]  So in 1985, shit that was in style and 1976 was waiting for me in the attic.
[14:54.470 --> 15:00.470]  And my dad used to always want soccer cleats from my oldest brother that were nine years old.
[15:01.070 --> 15:05.070]  That were like dry and the leather was all dry and cracked.
[15:06.070 --> 15:10.070]  My traumas were going up to the attic to go through my oldest brother's.
[15:12.070 --> 15:15.070]  And he was also fat when he was little. So his pajamas would always...
[15:16.070 --> 15:20.070]  I'd always have to hold him up with one hand because I was like stick thin.
[15:21.070 --> 15:26.070]  So you got dry rotted fat cleats to play soccer.
[15:26.670 --> 15:31.670]  Oh, that's therapy right there, brother. That's therapy.
[15:32.670 --> 15:36.860]  What's up, Daniel?
[15:37.860 --> 15:38.860]  Hey, how's it going?
[15:42.930 --> 15:43.930]  Good. Good to see you.
[15:44.930 --> 15:46.930]  You too. Look at this cutie here.
[15:47.930 --> 15:48.930]  Oh my freaking God.
[15:49.930 --> 15:50.930]  Those cheeks, bud.
[15:54.930 --> 15:57.930]  Oh, we make little Gerber babies.
[15:59.930 --> 16:00.930]  Yeah, that's...
[16:01.530 --> 16:02.530]  Put them on my label.
[16:03.530 --> 16:04.530]  Without a mask.
[16:05.530 --> 16:07.530]  We peel them off the label, yeah.
[16:11.530 --> 16:12.530]  Well, like we were already...
[16:13.530 --> 16:15.530]  Without a mask.
[16:16.530 --> 16:18.530]  And then I was like most overvalued payment.
[16:19.530 --> 16:20.530]  And Zach and...
[16:21.530 --> 16:22.530]  Dang.
[16:23.130 --> 16:26.130]  So someone asked payment by Venmo.
[16:27.130 --> 16:30.130]  No, tonight it's basically just going to
[16:33.130 --> 16:37.130]  the Food Not Bombs website and there's a donate.
[16:38.130 --> 16:40.130]  There are a couple donation options.
[16:41.130 --> 16:43.130]  So you basically just pick the one where you can use your...
[16:44.130 --> 16:48.130]  You can type in your own amount and use either your credit card or PayPal.
[16:50.130 --> 16:51.130]  But let me find it.
[16:51.730 --> 16:53.730]  But let me put that back in the...
[16:56.730 --> 16:58.730]  That's the link right there.
[17:04.730 --> 17:05.730]  And then...
[17:07.730 --> 17:09.730]  Dan, what was your...
[17:15.110 --> 17:17.110]  Since you'll probably be up next.
[17:19.110 --> 17:20.110]  What was what?
[17:20.710 --> 17:21.710]  Your...
[17:23.710 --> 17:25.710]  What's your brand or...
[17:30.710 --> 17:32.710]  Either Heart Rock Mountain Farm or Pride of the Lion Seeds.
[17:33.710 --> 17:34.710]  Okay.
[17:35.710 --> 17:36.710]  Okay, yeah.
[17:37.710 --> 17:40.710]  Sorry, you sent me the Lion Claw graphic, right?
[17:41.710 --> 17:44.710]  Yeah, I think on that one it says Heart Rock Mountain Farm on that one.
[17:45.710 --> 17:46.710]  Dude, I just saw the...
[17:47.310 --> 17:50.310]  Those autos from Garden of Greece that they grew up.
[17:51.310 --> 17:52.310]  Those look insane.
[17:53.310 --> 17:54.310]  Yeah.
[17:54.310 --> 17:55.310]  What?
[17:55.310 --> 17:56.310]  Those are autos?
[17:56.310 --> 17:57.310]  Yeah.
[17:57.310 --> 17:59.310]  I've grown some nice autos, but that was like...
[18:00.310 --> 18:02.310]  That kind of stunned me this morning when I was looking at those.
[18:03.310 --> 18:04.310]  Yeah, I guess...
[18:06.310 --> 18:08.310]  You just got on the chat here.
[18:09.310 --> 18:10.310]  Sorry, I'm going to pop in here on this.
[18:11.310 --> 18:14.310]  I've been the telemarketer director here.
[18:14.910 --> 18:22.910]  We're at $690 with two minutes to go on a pack the dude paid $4000 for that he put up.
[18:24.910 --> 18:27.910]  If this thing doesn't pop off really quick, I'm going to just throw down.
[18:30.910 --> 18:31.910]  I'm up here in Chaz.
[18:33.910 --> 18:34.910]  You're in the Chaz?
[18:35.910 --> 18:36.910]  Yeah, straight up.
[18:36.910 --> 18:37.910]  We should give this one a little bit more time.
[18:38.910 --> 18:39.910]  Oh, for sure.
[18:39.910 --> 18:40.910]  I mean, it's already proven before winning.
[18:41.910 --> 18:43.910]  People are fucking tripping if they're not doing it.
[18:44.910 --> 18:45.910]  Yeah, that's like half the...
[18:46.910 --> 18:47.910]  Sunnyland popped up to $700.
[18:48.910 --> 18:49.910]  On.
[18:50.910 --> 18:51.910]  Yeah, give that one a couple days.
[18:55.910 --> 18:56.910]  That's real shit right there.
[19:00.250 --> 19:01.250]  In a 50 pack?
[19:02.250 --> 19:04.250]  You're just definitely going to find these insane...
[19:05.250 --> 19:06.250]  Oh, for sure.
[19:06.250 --> 19:07.250]  ...insane gas line monsters.
[19:08.250 --> 19:09.250]  Two units, throw down $1000.
[19:10.250 --> 19:11.250]  There we go.
[19:11.250 --> 19:12.250]  Get it moving.
[19:12.250 --> 19:13.250]  All right.
[19:13.250 --> 19:14.250]  Thank you, sir.
[19:14.250 --> 19:15.250]  What is a 50 pack?
[19:15.850 --> 19:16.850]  Save Josh from having to buy these.
[19:17.850 --> 19:18.850]  Yeah, I can't afford it, dude.
[19:19.850 --> 19:21.850]  Save me from making a fool of myself being like, dude, I'm sorry.
[19:21.850 --> 19:22.850]  I shouldn't have bid.
[19:24.850 --> 19:25.850]  I'll go hass with you, Josh.
[19:27.850 --> 19:28.850]  But it wouldn't be okay if it's like...
[19:29.850 --> 19:30.850]  I mean, it's worth a lot.
[19:31.850 --> 19:32.850]  I'm tempted to go in with you, Josh.
[19:33.850 --> 19:34.850]  Damn, I don't know what these people are doing.
[19:38.850 --> 19:39.850]  What if all the panelists just split it?
[19:41.850 --> 19:42.850]  I will definitely go in.
[19:43.850 --> 19:44.850]  I'm definitely down.
[19:45.850 --> 19:46.850]  Testing charts again.
[19:49.850 --> 19:50.850]  So after...
[19:51.850 --> 19:52.850]  How many more minutes do we have on this one?
[19:55.850 --> 19:56.850]  45 seconds left on the clock.
[19:57.850 --> 20:01.850]  So do we all go in and then we just get one of us to open, pollinate, and redistribute?
[20:02.850 --> 20:03.850]  Is that the game?
[20:08.850 --> 20:13.850]  So when we wrap this one up, Keith McHenry just joined us from Food Not Bombs,
[20:14.450 --> 20:16.450]  which is the organization we're raising money for.
[20:17.450 --> 20:24.450]  So we'll give him some time to set the table of why we're raising money tonight.
[20:25.450 --> 20:28.450]  But we got, what, 30 seconds, 15, something like that?
[20:32.450 --> 20:33.450]  And if everybody wants to...
[20:34.450 --> 20:35.450]  So what are we at right now?
[20:40.830 --> 20:41.830]  I can't see the screen.
[20:46.450 --> 20:47.450]  We got awards.
[20:48.050 --> 20:49.050]  It's a little bit fuzzy, but...
[20:50.050 --> 20:52.050]  We got a sniper coming in at 1,001.
[20:55.050 --> 20:56.050]  Oh, no.
[20:57.050 --> 20:58.050]  You gotta do increments.
[20:59.050 --> 21:00.050]  It's 10.
[21:01.050 --> 21:02.050]  Can't do that.
[21:03.050 --> 21:04.050]  Scrape that piggy bank.
[21:08.050 --> 21:12.600]  Unless it's 1,100, that's not legit.
[21:13.600 --> 21:16.600]  I think like snipers have to come in at increments of 100.
[21:17.600 --> 21:19.600]  If you're gonna come in at the last minute, you know, you gotta be like,
[21:20.600 --> 21:21.600]  you gotta go big.
[21:22.600 --> 21:23.600]  You don't give it to the $1.
[21:24.600 --> 21:25.600]  You don't give it to the $1.
[21:27.600 --> 21:28.600]  We gotta call it then.
[21:29.600 --> 21:30.600]  Wow.
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.600]  Because we were out of time, right?
[21:34.600 --> 21:35.600]  Cannabis, Cascadian.
[21:36.600 --> 21:37.600]  Cascadian.
[21:38.600 --> 21:39.600]  Cascadian.
[21:40.600 --> 21:41.600]  Yeah, you got that one.
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.600]  G-Unit's got that one for 1,000, dude.
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.600]  Yeah, man.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.200]  Thank you very much, Leo, for putting up, dude.
[21:51.200 --> 21:52.200]  Super appreciate it, guys.
[21:54.200 --> 21:58.200]  Okay, so G-Unit, if you can email me.
[22:02.200 --> 22:06.200]  G-Unit's got a serious library he's been building.
[22:07.200 --> 22:12.200]  Because, yeah, I see the things that get grabbed up, and that collection is deep.
[22:12.800 --> 22:15.800]  Okay, so just quickly, G—
[22:16.800 --> 22:18.800]  Sorry, give me one second.
[22:19.800 --> 22:20.800]  So appropriate.
[22:21.800 --> 22:26.800]  So G-Unit, you're gonna make a donation for what, what was it, 1,000 bucks?
[22:28.800 --> 22:29.800]  Right?
[22:30.800 --> 22:31.800]  Yeah, how's this work?
[22:31.800 --> 22:33.800]  You guys just gonna email me as information?
[22:34.800 --> 22:37.800]  Yeah, so I'll coordinate or we'll coordinate with you.
[22:38.800 --> 22:39.800]  So basically, G—
[22:40.400 --> 22:43.400]  So, and Keith, this is where we need you to confirm that the payment was made.
[22:44.400 --> 22:45.400]  Okay.
[22:46.400 --> 22:49.400]  So I just put in—basically, you go to foodnotbombs.net.
[22:50.400 --> 22:52.400]  I actually sent you straight to the donate page.
[22:53.400 --> 22:59.400]  Then you scroll down, and on the left side, it says make a donation.
[23:00.400 --> 23:05.400]  And you can type in the amount, and then just put in 1,000 bucks, and hit submit.
[23:06.400 --> 23:07.400]  And those seeds are yours.
[23:08.000 --> 23:17.000]  And with that, let me pass it off to Keith to kind of talk about what's been going on in Santa Cruz and what you've been doing.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Yeah, well, thanks so much for having me.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  It's like really cool you're doing this.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  So, you know, so Food Not Bombs in Santa Cruz has been around since 1992.
[23:28.000 --> 23:37.000]  And the—and largely, we were doing like twice a week for the food not bombs.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Things like that over most of those years.
[23:40.000 --> 23:51.000]  And then on the 14th of March, we started getting news that the St. Francis Soup Kitchen and MH Can
[23:52.000 --> 23:58.000]  and a whole bunch of the programs that people depended on—the senior meal at Loudon Nelson and so on—
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  would be shut down because of the pandemic.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.000]  So we're like, oh my goodness, where are people going to eat?
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  What are they going to do?
[24:05.600 --> 24:09.600]  So we set up a COVID relief center at the town clock.
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.600]  We moved there from the post office because about 20 people were living up against the post office.
[24:16.600 --> 24:18.600]  And we wanted to do social distancing.
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.600]  We get like 100 to 200 people per meal coming to eat.
[24:23.600 --> 24:26.600]  We didn't want them by the campers there at all.
[24:27.200 --> 24:33.200]  And then we had a—we had to come up with a whole social distancing protocol that morning,
[24:34.200 --> 24:35.200]  Saturday morning of the 14th.
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.200]  Fortunately, we had a volunteer who worked at Good Samaritan Hospital
[24:43.200 --> 24:46.200]  who had just went through the COVID-19 protocols.
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.200]  And we also have a volunteer who's one of the leading virologists in the world.
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.200]  And we discussed with her what we needed to do.
[24:54.800 --> 25:02.800]  So then we set up those protocols and we became very quickly the only fresh water for people living outside.
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.800]  And eventually people, you know, you could buy it at CVS or you could buy it at Walgreens,
[25:09.800 --> 25:12.800]  although Walgreens went under, or New Leaf or something like that.
[25:13.800 --> 25:14.800]  But you had to have money.
[25:15.800 --> 25:16.800]  There was no fresh water.
[25:17.800 --> 25:18.800]  And we—I was shocked.
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.800]  And even today, we went through lots and lots of water because it's very hot out there
[25:23.400 --> 25:29.400]  and there's no taps out available currently because the restrooms are shut down for COVID.
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.400]  So we also quickly became the principal food,
[25:36.400 --> 25:42.400]  although in recent weeks, it's gotten to be a bit better where the university,
[25:43.400 --> 25:46.400]  the kitchen up there has been providing meals to people on the bench lands.
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  And Michael and the others at Meals on Wheels still are trying to find pockets of people.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  So there's been a hobbling together of more food programs,
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  although there's still a lot less than what was happening before the pandemic.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  Yet at the same time, there's a lot more people needing the food.
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  And not only the—like the very first day after the fire and the evacuations,
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.600]  we started having people coming to us, not so much for food initially, but for clothing.
[26:19.600 --> 26:20.600]  And quite a number of people said,
[26:21.600 --> 26:23.600]  well, all the clothing I have is on me now.
[26:24.600 --> 26:26.600]  I just ran. I don't have anything.
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.600]  So we have this clothing distribution that we operate as well
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.600]  as the food and the fresh water and the hand-washing station
[26:37.200 --> 26:43.200]  and masks and gloves and first aid, things like that.
[26:44.200 --> 26:52.200]  So anyway, when there became suddenly an increase of people because of the fire, of course,
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.200]  but then also we're getting the increase because even though there's evictions moratoriums,
[26:59.200 --> 27:06.200]  there is—people are still—there's, you know, issues happen and people end up losing their places.
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.200]  And so I think that we are very concerned that that's going to be the next major crisis.
[27:13.200 --> 27:15.200]  Let's hope it's not an earthquake or more fires.
[27:16.200 --> 27:17.200]  You know, that's enough.
[27:18.200 --> 27:24.200]  But that there is a—you know, that we are probably going to see an increase in homelessness
[27:25.200 --> 27:34.200]  because of the hobbled together aspect of the eviction relief and all these programs like that.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.800]  It's just—like I'm saying, there's already people falling through the cracks
[27:39.800 --> 27:43.800]  and ending up moving into their cars and finding safety there.
[27:44.800 --> 27:52.800]  And that could sadly increase much, much more over the next several months,
[27:53.800 --> 27:55.800]  and particularly in January and February,
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.800]  we might see a very notable increase of people living outside.
[28:03.400 --> 28:06.400]  And the other thing that's happening is we are worldwide,
[28:07.400 --> 28:09.400]  and I'm one of the original co-founders of Food Not Bombs.
[28:10.400 --> 28:12.400]  I helped start the first group in 1980 in Boston,
[28:13.400 --> 28:16.400]  and I designed the logo, the carrot in the fist,
[28:17.400 --> 28:23.400]  and coined the name from me handing out food to people at a housing project.
[28:24.400 --> 28:25.400]  I was a grocery worker.
[28:26.400 --> 28:29.400]  I was taking what wouldn't sell to this housing project,
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  and across the street there was a lab called Draper Lab
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  that was designing a guidance system for nuclear missiles.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  Ronald Reagan was running for president and then became president.
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.000]  And so our first kind of action really was we needed to raise money
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  to pay bail back for somebody who had been one of the co-founders,
[28:52.600 --> 28:59.600]  was arrested at Seabrook Nuclear Power Station at a protest on May 24, 1980,
[29:00.600 --> 29:04.600]  which is the date that we considered the founding of Food Not Bombs
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.600]  because the eight of us became a collective on that day
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.600]  when we bailed Brian out of jail.
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.600]  And so we were doing bake sales and it weren't working very well,
[29:14.600 --> 29:17.600]  so we decided we would, oddly enough,
[29:18.600 --> 29:19.600]  I had a moving company called Smooth Move,
[29:20.200 --> 29:21.200]  and I found a sign that said,
[29:22.200 --> 29:25.200]  wouldn't it be a beautiful day if the schools had all the money they needed
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.200]  and the airports had to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.
[29:29.200 --> 29:33.200]  And so we decided to buy surplus uniforms and go out with our baked goods
[29:34.200 --> 29:36.200]  and pretend like we were buying a bomber.
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.200]  I had red version of the hair that you currently see at that time.
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.200]  And that was, we thought, well, while we didn't really make more money,
[29:46.800 --> 29:51.800]  we had a lot of great conversations with people about nonviolence,
[29:52.800 --> 29:54.800]  anti-militarism, those kinds of things.
[29:55.800 --> 29:59.800]  And so then the final thing that really became Food Not Bombs
[30:00.800 --> 30:02.800]  was we decided we would dress up as hobos
[30:03.800 --> 30:05.800]  and do a soup kitchen outside the stockholders' meeting
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.800]  of the Bank of Boston on Atlantic Avenue
[30:09.800 --> 30:10.800]  at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[30:11.800 --> 30:13.800]  They're having their stockholders' meeting on March 26, 1981.
[30:14.400 --> 30:17.400]  And we made a huge amount of soup and we realized,
[30:18.400 --> 30:20.400]  oh my God, we won't be able to have a line of people.
[30:21.400 --> 30:22.400]  We didn't do enough flyering and so on.
[30:23.400 --> 30:25.400]  So let's go to the Pine Street Inn,
[30:26.400 --> 30:30.400]  which was at that time a very one-room shelter on Pine Street in Boston.
[30:31.400 --> 30:32.400]  And I gave a speech at about midnight
[30:33.400 --> 30:35.400]  to about maybe 50 people sitting around in this room.
[30:36.400 --> 30:41.400]  And the next day they came and it was very dramatic.
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  It was very inspiring, the people eating with us.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  And they suggested we do it every day
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  because there was no food for people living outside.
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  So we, that night when we were washing the pots and pans
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  and cleaning up everything, we thought,
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.000]  okay, this is what we're going to do.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  And that became what I've ended up doing the last 40 years.
[31:01.000 --> 31:07.000]  So right now we're on the front lines in Lebanon right now,
[31:07.600 --> 31:10.600]  in Beirut, feeding some of the 300,000 people
[31:11.600 --> 31:13.600]  that were left homeless by the explosion.
[31:14.600 --> 31:17.600]  We are doing a ton of things
[31:18.600 --> 31:21.600]  and actually feeding protests and serving,
[31:22.600 --> 31:26.600]  doing a lot of refugee work and so on in Sofia, Bulgaria.
[31:27.600 --> 31:31.600]  We have a very, very active pandemic relief work
[31:32.600 --> 31:34.600]  going on in Johannesburg, South Africa.
[31:35.200 --> 31:37.200]  And then we are also,
[31:40.200 --> 31:43.200]  in the Philippines, there's a lot of organizing
[31:44.200 --> 31:45.200]  and not only feeding the people, which is huge
[31:46.200 --> 31:48.200]  and going around on tricycles and bikes and so on,
[31:49.200 --> 31:50.200]  motorcycles, handing out meals and stuff.
[31:51.200 --> 31:53.200]  But there's also a resistance to the anti-terrorism act
[31:54.200 --> 31:57.200]  that they're facing there and their country.
[31:58.200 --> 32:02.200]  And at Yangon, we got a ton of things going on there.
[32:02.800 --> 32:06.800]  And so, and then it's similar throughout Canada, Mexico,
[32:07.800 --> 32:13.800]  throughout Europe, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Istanbul, Izmir.
[32:14.800 --> 32:16.800]  And we've been recently arrested in Russia
[32:17.800 --> 32:19.800]  for feeding people at the main train station
[32:20.800 --> 32:25.800]  and saying we're violating the shelter in place law there.
[32:26.800 --> 32:28.800]  And so it's like...
[32:29.400 --> 32:33.400]  Just quickly, I wanna get another auction going
[32:34.400 --> 32:37.400]  while you're talking so we can continue to raise the money.
[32:38.400 --> 32:47.400]  Can you check to confirm that you got $1,000 in the account?
[32:48.400 --> 32:49.400]  Yeah, okay.
[32:50.400 --> 32:52.400]  And while you're doing that, I'm gonna mute you for a second
[32:53.400 --> 32:55.400]  and I'm gonna tee up the next one
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.000]  and then we'll get back to what's going on with Food Not Bombs.
[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  So where did Daniel go?
[33:06.000 --> 33:07.000]  There you are.
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.000]  Although...
[33:10.000 --> 33:15.000]  Okay, so you are up next.
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  Let me just quickly grab your...
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  So why don't you start talking about what you're gonna auction
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.600]  and then I'll start throwing pictures up.
[33:27.600 --> 33:29.600]  Yeah, we're gonna auction off 2,000
[33:31.600 --> 33:34.600]  Lion Claw auto flower seeds.
[33:34.600 --> 33:36.600]  It's a 100-day auto flower.
[33:38.600 --> 33:43.600]  It's from a Siberian ruderala that was brought into Mexico.
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.600]  Made fully auto with a Mexican cultivator there
[33:47.600 --> 33:50.600]  and brought into Mendocino County as early grow.
[33:51.200 --> 33:54.200]  And when I got the seeds, they're labeled early
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.200]  but they were not early, they were definitely auto flower.
[33:58.200 --> 34:00.200]  And before I realized what was happening,
[34:01.200 --> 34:03.200]  they made babies in my nursery.
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.200]  And I've been working with them for about like five years now
[34:11.200 --> 34:18.200]  and they're hitting 20%, as high as 27% total cannabinoids
[34:18.800 --> 34:21.800]  and pretty high terpene levels.
[34:22.800 --> 34:24.800]  I think we had one above 3%.
[34:25.800 --> 34:27.800]  I'll mail those over to you.
[34:28.800 --> 34:31.800]  Just quickly, I'm gonna kill your video
[34:31.800 --> 34:33.800]  so your audio comes in better.
[34:34.800 --> 34:35.800]  Okay, yeah.
[34:36.800 --> 34:37.800]  Yep, that sounds much...
[34:38.800 --> 34:39.800]  All right, go ahead.
[34:40.800 --> 34:46.800]  So here's the branding and then here's...
[34:47.400 --> 34:48.400]  I heard you right, we're standing two,
[34:48.400 --> 34:50.400]  what's this, 2,000 seeds?
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.400]  Yes, 2,000 seeds.
[34:59.180 --> 35:01.180]  And it's a 100-day regular auto flower.
[35:01.180 --> 35:05.180]  They transplant really well, unlike most auto flowers.
[35:06.180 --> 35:08.180]  And you get really high yields from these.
[35:10.180 --> 35:12.180]  Some of my friends in Covalo, I think,
[35:12.180 --> 35:15.180]  had average height, five foot pounders.
[35:16.180 --> 35:17.180]  We did ours...
[35:17.780 --> 35:18.780]  Like a pound?
[35:18.780 --> 35:19.780]  Yeah.
[35:19.780 --> 35:20.780]  Did you say a pound?
[35:20.780 --> 35:21.780]  A pound of plant, yeah.
[35:21.780 --> 35:22.780]  On the auto?
[35:23.780 --> 35:24.780]  On the auto, yeah.
[35:24.780 --> 35:27.780]  I grow mine in native clay, which is a little bit of compost
[35:27.780 --> 35:30.780]  and we hit three ounces plus, which is pretty good.
[35:30.780 --> 35:35.780]  But yeah, people who are growing them in amended beds
[35:35.780 --> 35:38.780]  are getting 10 ounces, it's not uncommon.
[35:38.780 --> 35:39.780]  Unbelievable.
[35:40.380 --> 35:46.920]  I'll just hand them over to you.
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.920]  And I've seen no difference from rounds I did direct sow
[35:51.920 --> 35:53.920]  versus ones I transplanted three times.
[35:56.920 --> 35:58.920]  All right, where would you put the starting on that?
[35:59.920 --> 36:02.920]  So, yeah, and let's be clear.
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.920]  So are we auctioning the lot, like all 2,000
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.920]  or do you want to...
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.520]  Because you had said something like per seed pricing,
[36:13.520 --> 36:17.520]  but I think just for sake of...
[36:17.520 --> 36:19.520]  Of math.
[36:20.520 --> 36:22.520]  Yeah, of not being confused.
[36:22.520 --> 36:23.520]  Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.520]  If you want to say like a certain number
[36:25.520 --> 36:26.520]  and we'll start it at...
[36:27.520 --> 36:34.520]  Yeah, I mean, I was saying we could start it at 750,
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.120]  which would come in just under 40 cents.
[36:39.120 --> 36:41.120]  Jesse is shaking his...
[36:42.120 --> 36:45.120]  For all 2,000.
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.120]  Yeah, yes.
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.120]  And I think that's totally cool.
[36:51.120 --> 36:56.120]  And can you break down the math on that?
[36:56.120 --> 36:59.120]  Like a what if scenario, like, right?
[37:00.120 --> 37:04.120]  What is the potential of each one of those seeds gonna yield?
[37:04.720 --> 37:07.720]  Oh, I think if you're...
[37:07.720 --> 37:10.720]  Like I said, if you're doing it in native clay,
[37:10.720 --> 37:12.720]  you're gonna get minimum...
[37:12.720 --> 37:15.720]  You should get minimum three ounces minimum.
[37:15.720 --> 37:17.720]  Three to 10 is what...
[37:17.720 --> 37:20.720]  Depending on what you're growing them in
[37:20.720 --> 37:23.720]  and what time of year you're growing them to.
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.720]  You wanna hit that optimal conditions with an auto.
[37:31.320 --> 37:34.320]  So if you start them in February,
[37:34.320 --> 37:36.320]  they're gonna be a little bit shorter
[37:36.320 --> 37:39.320]  than if you start them in March, April.
[37:41.320 --> 37:44.320]  But I've heard from friends who've grown them
[37:44.320 --> 37:45.320]  in like that beds
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.320]  that they were getting a quarter pound of plant.
[37:47.320 --> 37:49.320]  I've heard almost a pound of plant.
[37:51.320 --> 37:52.320]  Right, so at three ounces,
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.320]  that's like 180 to 200 pounds.
[37:56.320 --> 37:57.320]  I mean, you could.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.320]  Yeah, I mean, you could.
[37:58.920 --> 38:01.920]  Let's say you get a thousand females
[38:01.920 --> 38:02.920]  at the low end of that.
[38:02.920 --> 38:03.920]  Right, that's what I did.
[38:03.920 --> 38:06.920]  I did a thousand females, yeah.
[38:09.510 --> 38:13.510]  And autos, you don't need to feed like other plants
[38:13.510 --> 38:15.510]  and you shouldn't feed like other plants.
[38:17.510 --> 38:20.510]  You might get more hermaphrodites than normal.
[38:24.510 --> 38:25.510]  What's your feed program
[38:25.510 --> 38:28.510]  when you're doing the running?
[38:29.110 --> 38:32.110]  We just did like two shovels of compost in the hole.
[38:36.110 --> 38:37.110]  Do you water them?
[38:37.110 --> 38:38.110]  A couple of turns.
[38:38.110 --> 38:39.110]  What?
[38:39.110 --> 38:40.110]  Do you water them?
[38:41.110 --> 38:42.110]  Yeah, we water them.
[38:42.110 --> 38:43.110]  Yeah, we're not dry farming.
[38:43.110 --> 38:44.110]  We're at.
[38:48.540 --> 38:50.540]  So Santa Cruz Cannabis Company asked,
[38:50.540 --> 38:51.540]  what's the germination rate?
[38:52.540 --> 38:53.540]  Oh, I mean,
[38:54.540 --> 38:56.540]  if it's not operator air,
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.540]  it should be 98% plus.
[38:58.140 --> 38:59.140]  You know,
[39:01.140 --> 39:03.140]  I've only had a few people not hit that.
[39:04.140 --> 39:05.140]  They all cracked.
[39:06.140 --> 39:09.140]  Yeah, some people had some issues with cold.
[39:12.140 --> 39:14.140]  Is this from this year or last year's?
[39:14.140 --> 39:15.140]  Last year.
[39:15.140 --> 39:16.140]  Oh, cool.
[39:16.140 --> 39:17.140]  Cool.
[39:17.140 --> 39:18.140]  Yeah, those are tested as fuck.
[39:18.140 --> 39:19.140]  Like, I mean,
[39:20.140 --> 39:21.140]  what keep,
[39:21.140 --> 39:22.140]  yeah,
[39:22.140 --> 39:23.140]  Amanda just like,
[39:23.140 --> 39:24.140]  we're selling off at.
[39:25.140 --> 39:26.140]  We're hitting, yeah, 99%.
[39:26.740 --> 39:27.740]  Cool, Kirk.
[39:27.740 --> 39:28.740]  I mean,
[39:28.740 --> 39:29.740]  and Amanda,
[39:29.740 --> 39:30.740]  we're showing off at the Garden of Greece.
[39:30.740 --> 39:31.740]  This is insane.
[39:31.740 --> 39:32.740]  Just so beautiful.
[39:32.740 --> 39:33.740]  Oh, yeah.
[39:33.740 --> 39:34.740]  I mean,
[39:34.740 --> 39:35.740]  and like most people who have grown on my,
[39:35.740 --> 39:36.740]  I hear a lot of times,
[39:36.740 --> 39:38.740]  oh, this is my favorite smoke this year.
[39:38.740 --> 39:39.740]  This is my favorite smoke ever.
[39:39.740 --> 39:40.740]  You know,
[39:40.740 --> 39:41.740]  it's like really turpy,
[39:41.740 --> 39:42.740]  really good high.
[39:46.740 --> 39:48.740]  And it's ready in 100 days.
[39:50.740 --> 39:53.740]  When's your favorite germination time for the year?
[39:54.740 --> 39:55.740]  It depends.
[39:56.340 --> 39:57.340]  If you're trying to get two rounds,
[39:57.340 --> 39:59.340]  I start in February.
[39:59.340 --> 40:00.340]  If you're trying to get,
[40:00.340 --> 40:01.340]  so,
[40:01.340 --> 40:04.340]  and we give our autos our own zone.
[40:04.340 --> 40:08.340]  How is that work in February?
[40:08.340 --> 40:09.340]  Do they do okay with the cold?
[40:09.340 --> 40:10.340]  How does that compare?
[40:10.340 --> 40:11.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:11.340 --> 40:12.340]  They do okay with,
[40:12.340 --> 40:13.340]  I mean,
[40:13.340 --> 40:14.340]  start them in a greenhouse.
[40:14.340 --> 40:15.340]  Okay.
[40:15.340 --> 40:16.340]  Yeah.
[40:16.340 --> 40:19.340]  I've never direct sowed in the spring time.
[40:19.340 --> 40:21.340]  I think we're going to try it next year.
[40:21.340 --> 40:24.340]  I just came across some of these little baskets
[40:24.940 --> 40:26.940]  that my dad made to direct sow and keep the birds out.
[40:26.940 --> 40:27.940]  I'm like,
[40:27.940 --> 40:28.940]  oh yeah,
[40:28.940 --> 40:30.940]  we should do this with autos next year.
[40:30.940 --> 40:33.940]  Cause we tried this year starting a bunch for like sprinklers
[40:33.940 --> 40:35.940]  and I don't know how about water for that.
[40:36.940 --> 40:37.940]  I did some direct sow,
[40:37.940 --> 40:39.940]  like dry farmed in the yard this year.
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.940]  And I was like,
[40:40.940 --> 40:41.940]  amazing.
[40:41.940 --> 40:43.940]  They just grew so fast and like pretty.
[40:43.940 --> 40:44.940]  And yeah,
[40:44.940 --> 40:46.940]  it's just super fun to have autos in the,
[40:46.940 --> 40:47.940]  in the,
[40:47.940 --> 40:48.940]  in the backyard,
[40:48.940 --> 40:50.940]  like just finished early and yeah.
[40:50.940 --> 40:51.940]  Or late.
[40:51.940 --> 40:52.940]  I just,
[40:53.540 --> 40:56.540]  I have some one inch seedlings that just came up from a direct
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.540]  sow in our greenhouses.
[40:58.540 --> 41:00.540]  I got the Mustafa,
[41:00.540 --> 41:03.540]  which is the lion claw by sour stomper.
[41:04.540 --> 41:06.540]  And then I got the Aurora lion.
[41:12.820 --> 41:13.820]  But yeah,
[41:13.820 --> 41:14.820]  Noah from golden figs.
[41:14.820 --> 41:16.820]  He says he likes growing them out.
[41:16.820 --> 41:17.820]  He grew some out.
[41:17.820 --> 41:19.820]  Does he do it with plants?
[41:19.820 --> 41:20.820]  Like,
[41:20.820 --> 41:23.820]  like cause he grows those monsters and all the veggies and stuff,
[41:23.820 --> 41:25.820]  but does he do them around them or do it?
[41:26.420 --> 41:30.420]  I actually haven't seen where he has any pictures of them.
[41:31.420 --> 41:32.420]  Yeah.
[41:34.420 --> 41:35.420]  Yeah.
[41:35.420 --> 41:36.420]  Yeah.
[41:36.420 --> 41:37.420]  There's spots so beautiful.
[41:37.420 --> 41:38.420]  So yeah,
[41:38.420 --> 41:40.420]  they've been going on there too.
[41:40.420 --> 41:41.420]  And he's,
[41:41.420 --> 41:42.420]  he knows plants,
[41:42.420 --> 41:44.420]  but I went to his place like,
[41:44.420 --> 41:47.420]  or I saw you right after seeing his place.
[41:47.420 --> 41:49.420]  Like I think a little bit ago.
[41:49.420 --> 41:50.420]  Okay.
[41:50.420 --> 41:51.420]  Yeah.
[41:51.420 --> 41:52.420]  For the,
[41:52.420 --> 41:53.420]  for the region.
[41:53.420 --> 41:54.420]  Yeah.
[41:54.420 --> 41:55.420]  Yeah.
[41:56.020 --> 41:58.020]  We're planning to hit up there soon.
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.020]  Cause
[42:00.020 --> 42:03.020]  and visit them at some point before it gets crazy.
[42:06.800 --> 42:07.800]  Yeah.
[42:07.800 --> 42:09.800]  How bad is the smoke right now?
[42:09.800 --> 42:11.800]  I guess it's worse than Kovalo.
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.800]  And then it's been really bad and Potter like really bad.
[42:17.800 --> 42:18.800]  See
[42:20.800 --> 42:23.800]  and then I guess high winds are coming back to the area.
[42:23.800 --> 42:24.800]  Maybe Monday,
[42:24.800 --> 42:25.800]  Tuesday.
[42:25.800 --> 42:26.800]  So
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.400]  after all that,
[42:28.400 --> 42:30.400]  basically like all those like what?
[42:30.400 --> 42:33.400]  27 separate lightning fires that are burning into one.
[42:35.400 --> 42:37.400]  And then here on the table,
[42:37.400 --> 42:40.400]  I have some lion claw crossed with red cross,
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.400]  which is a high CBD auto.
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.400]  Maybe try your video again.
[42:44.400 --> 42:45.400]  In case it doesn't,
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.400]  I don't know.
[42:46.400 --> 42:48.400]  I can't turn it back on.
[42:48.400 --> 42:49.400]  Oh,
[42:49.400 --> 42:51.400]  let me ask you to start your video.
[42:53.400 --> 42:55.860]  Yeah,
[42:55.860 --> 42:56.860]  we don't.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.460]  There you are.
[42:58.460 --> 42:59.460]  The what?
[42:59.460 --> 43:01.460]  I don't know if the wifi works that.
[43:01.460 --> 43:02.460]  No,
[43:02.460 --> 43:03.460]  we can see you.
[43:03.460 --> 43:04.460]  Yeah.
[43:05.460 --> 43:08.890]  I guess.
[43:08.890 --> 43:09.890]  Yeah.
[43:09.890 --> 43:10.890]  With the,
[43:10.890 --> 43:14.890]  when you with the CBD with the THC auto,
[43:15.890 --> 43:17.890]  you one out of four will be high THC.
[43:17.890 --> 43:23.890]  One out of four will be high CBD and two out of four will be in the middle.
[43:25.890 --> 43:30.860]  Have you had anyone put all that together for extraction?
[43:31.460 --> 43:33.460]  See what like what that comes out like?
[43:34.460 --> 43:35.460]  Well,
[43:35.460 --> 43:36.460]  yeah.
[43:36.460 --> 43:41.460]  So Wildland did when they did the electric jaw cards,
[43:41.460 --> 43:49.460]  it was from seed and where they did the jog you with the AC DC and they washed
[43:49.460 --> 43:52.460]  it up chemistry washed it all and it came out one to one,
[43:52.460 --> 43:55.460]  which kind of makes sense then because it would,
[43:55.460 --> 43:56.460]  you know,
[43:56.460 --> 43:57.460]  yeah,
[43:57.460 --> 43:59.460]  some 21 some like one to one some,
[43:59.460 --> 44:00.460]  you know,
[44:01.060 --> 44:03.060]  some type to use them all mixed up.
[44:04.060 --> 44:05.060]  Yeah.
[44:05.060 --> 44:06.060]  So yeah,
[44:06.060 --> 44:08.060]  I guess you could cross that would,
[44:08.060 --> 44:10.060]  it would work out like that.
[44:10.060 --> 44:12.060]  Almost every time you did a high THC,
[44:12.060 --> 44:14.060]  the high CBD and washed it all.
[44:18.450 --> 44:19.450]  But yeah,
[44:19.450 --> 44:20.450]  I got some,
[44:20.450 --> 44:21.450]  some fun projects in the,
[44:21.450 --> 44:22.450]  in the nursery this year.
[44:22.450 --> 44:24.450]  It's pretty exciting right now.
[44:24.450 --> 44:26.450]  Seeing all the flavors come out.
[44:26.450 --> 44:27.450]  What's sticking out?
[44:27.450 --> 44:28.450]  I got,
[44:28.450 --> 44:29.450]  Oh,
[44:30.050 --> 44:33.050]  well for the Lion Claw hybrids,
[44:33.050 --> 44:38.050]  the Lion Claw with my blueberry african diesel was phenomenal.
[44:38.050 --> 44:42.050]  I already harvested some tops on one of them or,
[44:42.050 --> 44:43.050]  well,
[44:43.050 --> 44:44.050]  yeah,
[44:44.050 --> 44:45.050]  because it's an F1.
[44:45.050 --> 44:46.050]  So it's photo,
[44:46.050 --> 44:47.050]  it's photo period,
[44:47.050 --> 44:49.050]  but some of them already in August.
[44:49.050 --> 44:50.050]  Oh,
[44:50.050 --> 44:52.050]  and some of them are normal.
[44:52.050 --> 44:55.050]  And then the Lion Claw velvet perps turned out really,
[44:55.050 --> 44:56.050]  really good.
[44:56.650 --> 45:00.650]  And then the Lion Claw velvet perps turned out really nice,
[45:00.650 --> 45:03.450]  but I didn't get a purple dude.
[45:03.450 --> 45:07.850]  So maybe next year,
[45:07.850 --> 45:09.850]  but they came or they turned out for some of that.
[45:09.850 --> 45:15.250]  And then the light Lion Claw lemon head from that's from will it's from Kelly box card.
[45:15.250 --> 45:24.450]  Those turned out like really nice that lit and we hunted through the lemon head last year and found a male and veg that hit like 4% THC.
[45:28.810 --> 45:30.610]  We have a tattoo going on right here.
[45:30.610 --> 45:34.810]  We do let let let me.
[45:34.810 --> 45:40.780]  What are you getting?
[45:40.780 --> 45:45.680]  What's it going to be?
[45:45.680 --> 45:51.180]  It's a little mermaid tattoo.
[45:51.180 --> 45:52.580]  You're muted right now.
[45:52.580 --> 45:52.980]  Leo.
[45:52.980 --> 45:54.780]  I'll just go ahead and tell you for him.
[45:54.780 --> 45:56.380]  It's a little mermaid tattoo.
[45:56.380 --> 46:03.180]  You guys caught me on the run.
[46:03.180 --> 46:07.180]  So I already have it scheduled with you guys brought me on.
[46:07.180 --> 46:12.780]  Figure might as well show everybody for some entertainment.
[46:12.780 --> 46:17.580]  How they doing on aerial man is a little mermaid coming out good or great.
[46:17.580 --> 46:22.780]  It's right next to my Gargamel from the Smurfs.
[46:22.780 --> 46:25.780]  Say Gargamel one more time for me.
[46:25.780 --> 46:25.980]  Hold on.
[46:25.980 --> 46:26.980]  Let me let me show him real quick.
[46:26.980 --> 46:33.060]  Nice.
[46:33.060 --> 46:36.060]  That's really fucking Gargamel from the Smurfs.
[46:36.060 --> 46:39.260]  I thought he was joking after my aerial comment.
[46:39.260 --> 46:43.660]  And he's actually getting aerial next to it.
[46:43.660 --> 46:48.660]  I have nothing to say to a grown-ass man putting Gargamel on his body except for respect, dude.
[46:48.660 --> 46:49.860]  Respect to you.
[46:53.060 --> 46:54.660]  Don't mind me.
[46:55.660 --> 46:56.460]  All right.
[46:56.460 --> 47:02.660]  We have Santa Cruz Adams stealing 2,000 seeds right now.
[47:02.660 --> 47:08.660]  And I was actually texting with him earlier talking about how many steals there were yesterday.
[47:08.660 --> 47:16.370]  And he's gonna get it for so.
[47:17.370 --> 47:29.170]  So did that first thousand dollar payment come through?
[47:29.170 --> 47:29.770]  Yep.
[47:29.770 --> 47:30.570]  It certainly did.
[47:30.570 --> 47:31.570]  All right.
[47:31.570 --> 47:32.570]  Fantastic.
[47:32.570 --> 47:33.570]  My God.
[47:33.570 --> 47:36.370]  Being able to verify payments is an amazing thing.
[47:36.370 --> 47:38.770]  Okay.
[47:38.770 --> 47:43.370]  So and who is the first winner again?
[47:43.370 --> 47:44.770]  It was a G unit, right?
[47:45.170 --> 47:46.170]  G unit.
[47:46.170 --> 47:47.170]  Really?
[47:47.170 --> 47:48.170]  All right.
[47:48.170 --> 47:51.170]  I'm gonna mute the buzzing on Leo.
[47:51.170 --> 47:52.170]  Sorry.
[47:52.170 --> 47:55.170]  This is day two.
[47:55.170 --> 47:58.170]  G unit was the first one.
[47:58.170 --> 48:03.170]  And Santa Cruz was the second one.
[48:03.170 --> 48:04.170]  All right.
[48:04.170 --> 48:07.170]  So we have a winner, right?
[48:07.570 --> 48:14.900]  So Adam, yeah, go to Cascadia and put the link up and just go there.
[48:14.900 --> 48:23.250]  And I think I assume you can do all credit card and PayPal options.
[48:23.250 --> 48:26.250]  I don't think that does Venmo, right?
[48:26.250 --> 48:27.250]  Keith?
[48:27.250 --> 48:29.250]  No, it's just right now.
[48:29.250 --> 48:30.250]  It's just PayPal.
[48:30.250 --> 48:31.250]  Why?
[48:31.250 --> 48:33.250]  I think also credit card and PayPal.
[48:33.250 --> 48:34.250]  I don't know.
[48:34.250 --> 48:36.250]  I don't think that does Venmo.
[48:36.250 --> 48:38.250]  I don't think that does Venmo.
[48:38.250 --> 48:40.250]  I don't think that does Venmo.
[48:40.650 --> 48:41.650]  Why?
[48:41.650 --> 48:42.650]  I think also credit card.
[48:42.650 --> 48:43.650]  Yeah.
[48:43.650 --> 48:46.650]  So basically you can use all credit cards are welcome.
[48:46.650 --> 48:47.650]  Correct.
[48:47.650 --> 48:48.650]  All right.
[48:48.650 --> 48:56.650]  So let's I see Jackson.
[48:56.650 --> 49:01.650]  You're muted though.
[49:01.650 --> 49:06.500]  Oh, wait, I think.
[49:06.500 --> 49:13.020]  Yeah, I'm trying to.
[49:13.420 --> 49:14.420]  Hold on.
[49:14.420 --> 49:15.420]  There's Leo.
[49:15.420 --> 49:18.420]  I think I spotlighted him.
[49:18.420 --> 49:25.420]  So do we want to go since we have Jackson on the line with us?
[49:25.420 --> 49:29.420]  Do we want to go something from him?
[49:29.420 --> 49:34.020]  Yeah, if he's interested.
[49:34.020 --> 49:41.350]  Jackson, are you willing to throw something towards a good cause?
[49:41.750 --> 49:56.860]  I think you're still muted.
[49:56.860 --> 49:59.860]  I'll fuck you.
[49:59.860 --> 50:00.860]  Fuck you.
[50:00.860 --> 50:06.860]  He's still muted.
[50:06.860 --> 50:09.860]  You want a donation?
[50:09.860 --> 50:12.860]  All right, I'm out of here.
[50:13.260 --> 50:24.260]  Well, we could while we're waiting for Jackson to hit the right button and not the or hit
[50:24.260 --> 50:25.260]  the unmute button.
[50:25.260 --> 50:33.260]  So we who could we could go to Josh, you give me some guidance here.
[50:33.260 --> 50:34.260]  I mean, we could go to Bodie.
[50:34.260 --> 50:35.260]  Yeah.
[50:35.260 --> 50:38.260]  I saw that was a buzz.
[50:38.260 --> 50:41.260]  Let's go to do the Bodie stuff.
[50:41.660 --> 50:43.660]  There's Jackson.
[50:43.660 --> 50:44.660]  He's back.
[50:44.660 --> 50:45.660]  All right.
[50:45.660 --> 50:51.660]  So we thought you were not happy that I asked if you wanted to donate something and.
[50:51.660 --> 50:53.660]  Oh, yeah, no, I got out of there.
[50:53.660 --> 50:57.660]  I thought I thought just leaving for a second would make that pretty clear.
[50:57.660 --> 50:58.660]  No, I'm just kidding.
[50:58.660 --> 51:05.660]  I was on some kind of weird setting there with my screen, so I couldn't see that the
[51:05.660 --> 51:07.660]  place to unmute it.
[51:08.060 --> 51:14.060]  I was going to I was going to put up 20 seeds of.
[51:14.060 --> 51:18.060]  Of a good.
[51:18.060 --> 51:25.060]  Root beer clone that I have that I call Coca-Cola and I crossed it with the Animal West F3 male
[51:25.060 --> 51:30.060]  and I haven't grown them yet, but I was going to put up 20 seeds of that.
[51:30.060 --> 51:34.060]  It's like it'll be a root beer cookies kind of thing.
[51:34.460 --> 51:40.460]  The Coca-Cola is like a more more soda smelling than the root beer clone.
[51:40.460 --> 51:45.460]  Okay, so just quickly, this was not the untested runs, right?
[51:45.460 --> 51:47.460]  No, that was last night, right?
[51:47.460 --> 51:49.460]  I don't think we got to do it.
[51:49.460 --> 51:51.460]  Josh, we didn't get around to it.
[51:51.460 --> 51:54.460]  Yeah, we want to start with that.
[51:54.460 --> 51:57.460]  Yeah, so that was that was a run.
[51:57.460 --> 51:58.460]  Because I have a graphic of it.
[51:58.460 --> 51:59.460]  Hold on.
[51:59.460 --> 52:01.460]  Let me go for it.
[52:01.860 --> 52:05.860]  So talk about that one and then I'll make a graphic for the next one.
[52:05.860 --> 52:08.860]  Yeah, so that was the that was the runs.
[52:08.860 --> 52:10.860]  Runs clone.
[52:10.860 --> 52:13.860]  Which I think is pretty cool.
[52:13.860 --> 52:18.860]  It's I have a few different gelatos and the runs is a little bit more skittly.
[52:18.860 --> 52:20.860]  It's definitely not just a renamed.
[52:20.860 --> 52:28.860]  Gelato 33 and it's not a renamed gelato, whatever the other ones that I have are so.
[52:29.260 --> 52:33.260]  It's a it's a cool plant and then I have that.
[52:33.260 --> 52:39.260]  I hit that with that gelato 33 cherry limeade male.
[52:39.260 --> 52:42.260]  So it's going to be some cool stuff.
[52:42.260 --> 52:46.260]  I haven't grown them yet and they'll go into testing pretty soon.
[52:46.260 --> 52:51.260]  But you know, it's a chance for somebody to get some before they go out.
[52:51.260 --> 52:52.260]  And I don't know.
[52:52.260 --> 52:54.260]  I might not release it.
[52:54.260 --> 52:55.260]  I might release it.
[52:55.260 --> 52:56.260]  I'm not sure.
[52:56.660 --> 52:58.660]  So I don't know.
[52:58.660 --> 53:02.660]  I just figured it was something to put up that would be some tasty and purple.
[53:02.660 --> 53:05.660]  And it should be pretty nice.
[53:05.660 --> 53:09.660]  All the parents are really hard and purple and tasty and potent.
[53:09.660 --> 53:12.660]  So I think it would be pretty good.
[53:12.660 --> 53:14.660]  It'll definitely be good outside inside.
[53:14.660 --> 53:15.660]  It could be unstable.
[53:15.660 --> 53:20.660]  I don't know because I've never I've never bred with the runs before.
[53:20.660 --> 53:22.660]  And it's a new combination.
[53:22.660 --> 53:23.660]  So I don't know.
[53:24.060 --> 53:25.060]  Something cool.
[53:25.060 --> 53:29.060]  I had them sitting on the table ready to go out for a couple people to test.
[53:29.060 --> 53:33.060]  But like I said, I don't know if it'll be released.
[53:33.060 --> 53:37.060]  But 20 seeds should be a good one in there.
[53:37.060 --> 53:38.060]  So.
[53:38.060 --> 53:40.060]  Is this one root beer?
[53:40.060 --> 53:44.060]  I heard you say a root beer cross and then I heard you go on.
[53:44.060 --> 53:45.060]  No, sorry.
[53:45.060 --> 53:47.060]  That's going to be another.
[53:47.060 --> 53:50.060]  I'm going to have to go back and look at that.
[53:50.460 --> 53:53.060]  Sorry, that's going to be another.
[53:53.060 --> 53:54.060]  Another.
[53:54.060 --> 53:56.060]  Set of seeds.
[53:56.060 --> 54:00.060]  This is the one that he thought we did last night and we didn't do it last night.
[54:00.060 --> 54:01.060]  So we're going to do it tonight.
[54:01.060 --> 54:03.060]  So no root beer in this.
[54:03.060 --> 54:06.060]  So a good number.
[54:08.060 --> 54:11.060]  So what do we want to start it at?
[54:11.060 --> 54:16.060]  I can start at anything started it like ten bucks or something.
[54:16.060 --> 54:17.060]  I don't know.
[54:17.060 --> 54:18.060]  No, no, no, no.
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.180]  I started at whatever.
[54:19.180 --> 54:20.420]  It doesn't matter, right?
[54:20.420 --> 54:22.940]  I always start them, you know, like-
[54:22.940 --> 54:23.780]  Started at 200 bucks.
[54:23.780 --> 54:25.340]  I usually start them really low.
[54:25.340 --> 54:27.100]  Well, start it at 200.
[54:28.420 --> 54:29.860]  That's what we've been starting.
[54:29.860 --> 54:32.100]  All decent good packs.
[54:32.100 --> 54:34.540]  I almost said, yeah.
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.820]  All decent packs with a jackass.
[54:36.820 --> 54:38.540]  We're talking about the rush cost,
[54:38.540 --> 54:40.500]  not the root beer cost, right?
[54:40.500 --> 54:41.580]  Yeah.
[54:41.580 --> 54:43.100]  There is no root beer.
[54:43.100 --> 54:44.780]  Root beer is a myth.
[54:44.780 --> 54:46.000]  Root beer is not a myth,
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.700]  and I'm about to bid on that shit,
[54:47.700 --> 54:49.840]  so I'm making sure that I have it clear
[54:49.840 --> 54:51.840]  as to which one we're talking about here.
[54:51.840 --> 54:56.840]  So, look at Josh smiling in that bottom screen there.
[54:58.680 --> 55:00.440]  He's ripped, dude.
[55:00.440 --> 55:01.360]  Yeah.
[55:01.360 --> 55:02.440]  No, and I just texted him.
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.560]  I was like, bro, I got about 200 of those Sky Gyros going.
[55:06.560 --> 55:09.240]  If you want that root beer, I may have a shot at it.
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.520]  Gene Jackson's the baby, though.
[55:11.520 --> 55:13.920]  I'm like, okay, go for it.
[55:13.920 --> 55:16.200]  I'm looking for this, so.
[55:17.180 --> 55:18.020]  Plus his charity.
[55:18.020 --> 55:19.700]  You can put a bag of seeds here?
[55:21.620 --> 55:23.900]  Look at this shit.
[55:23.900 --> 55:27.300]  So, we're already at 450, I think,
[55:27.300 --> 55:29.860]  from Dave Zno there.
[55:30.700 --> 55:31.920]  Started at $10.
[55:31.920 --> 55:34.260]  But then other people are going backwards,
[55:34.260 --> 55:38.060]  but yeah, Dave's currently, yeah.
[55:38.900 --> 55:41.520]  You tell this G-Unit guy to back off
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.060]  on the root beer cost option right now.
[55:44.320 --> 55:48.240]  I'm stepping up, this G-Unit guy needs to back the hell off.
[55:48.240 --> 55:50.120]  Yeah, this is the untested run, so.
[55:51.560 --> 55:54.320]  Oh, I'm not bidding on the runs.
[55:54.320 --> 55:56.160]  Not that there's no problem with the runs,
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.160]  it's just that I've had my eye on his other crawls for a while.
[56:08.010 --> 56:10.530]  You got any chicken top ramen flavors?
[56:13.920 --> 56:14.760]  I used to.
[56:14.760 --> 56:17.600]  I used to have a crazy chicken stain.
[56:18.500 --> 56:20.660]  I bet Fino comes up every once in a while
[56:20.660 --> 56:24.500]  on some seed bots I got, just like chicken top ramen.
[56:26.500 --> 56:28.340]  Yeah, that's tricky, man.
[56:28.340 --> 56:32.500]  I found some tortilla chip flavor
[56:32.500 --> 56:35.740]  in some of the Duke stuff I was going through this time.
[56:35.740 --> 56:37.060]  I kept coming back to it, I was like,
[56:37.060 --> 56:38.780]  this is fucking tortillas, dude.
[56:41.780 --> 56:42.860]  That's because you put in those-
[56:42.860 --> 56:43.700]  Are you sure?
[56:43.700 --> 56:45.900]  They didn't just rehydrate the bag?
[56:46.000 --> 56:46.840]  Yeah.
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.840]  Because you got tortillas, the whole pack of tortillas, man.
[56:51.840 --> 56:54.740]  You got that 80 pack of tortillas in the hefty bag, man.
[56:56.280 --> 56:58.080]  You gotta remember to take those out.
[57:02.360 --> 57:04.960]  What was that, the 2,000 seeds that,
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.400]  in that bag right in front of you?
[57:08.400 --> 57:09.240]  Oh, this?
[57:09.240 --> 57:10.840]  No, that's a little bit more.
[57:10.840 --> 57:12.300]  That's like a million seeds.
[57:13.600 --> 57:15.760]  Quarter million, maybe, half a million?
[57:15.760 --> 57:16.920]  Half a million. Quarter million.
[57:16.920 --> 57:17.840]  Quarter.
[57:17.860 --> 57:19.500]  Legit quarter, yeah.
[57:19.500 --> 57:20.380]  This is my office.
[57:20.380 --> 57:21.740]  You know, I'm just working.
[57:21.740 --> 57:23.780]  Over here working, don't mind me.
[57:23.780 --> 57:25.140]  It's not an office job.
[57:26.460 --> 57:27.580]  It is, yeah, it's nice, you know,
[57:27.580 --> 57:28.900]  because my little four-year-old,
[57:28.900 --> 57:31.100]  he loves to watch the seed counter go round,
[57:31.100 --> 57:34.440]  and it's a good time.
[57:35.820 --> 57:38.300]  Doing some metric track and tracing.
[57:39.680 --> 57:40.860]  Oh, that was so annoying,
[57:40.860 --> 57:43.020]  getting everything in before the deadline.
[57:44.020 --> 57:44.860]  Like.
[57:48.740 --> 57:51.220]  Wow, so Santa Cruz Cannabis Company asked,
[57:51.220 --> 57:53.260]  can I throw an extra 25 bucks
[57:53.260 --> 57:54.940]  to get those autos overnighted?
[57:54.940 --> 57:57.780]  He's ready to throw them in the ground.
[58:01.180 --> 58:02.460]  They should come up.
[58:02.460 --> 58:03.300]  They should come up and visit.
[58:03.300 --> 58:04.140]  Yeah.
[58:05.340 --> 58:08.360]  Yeah, yeah, we can get them overnighted, don't.
[58:10.620 --> 58:12.340]  Today's Saturday, right?
[58:12.340 --> 58:14.060]  So, Monday, yeah.
[58:16.300 --> 58:19.700]  I take some time, I'm a fucking USPS.
[58:21.300 --> 58:24.260]  Hey, Keith, I just wanted to get you back on the mic, man.
[58:24.260 --> 58:27.700]  I appreciated hearing your story,
[58:27.700 --> 58:30.940]  and I kinda, I didn't know much about it,
[58:30.940 --> 58:32.300]  but hearing that you were the founder,
[58:32.300 --> 58:34.460]  I think we just really appreciate you coming on, man,
[58:34.460 --> 58:35.660]  and giving us time,
[58:35.660 --> 58:38.460]  and I'd love to hear more or anything you'd love to share,
[58:38.460 --> 58:41.100]  man, and we're stoked to be raising some funds for you guys.
[58:41.100 --> 58:42.100]  Yeah, this is beautiful.
[58:42.100 --> 58:43.260]  It's real fun.
[58:43.280 --> 58:46.840]  So, one thing that came to mind is,
[58:46.840 --> 58:48.580]  when we first started,
[58:49.960 --> 58:54.600]  our original name was the Food and Drug Administration,
[58:54.600 --> 58:59.040]  and so we were going with that name a little bit,
[58:59.040 --> 59:00.160]  and then we started realizing,
[59:00.160 --> 59:01.560]  well, that's gonna probably interfere
[59:01.560 --> 59:04.580]  with our fundraising program,
[59:04.580 --> 59:08.280]  which was selling mushrooms and herb.
[59:08.280 --> 59:11.360]  So, anyway, so we changed our name
[59:11.380 --> 59:15.340]  to the Food for Free Committee for one week,
[59:17.220 --> 59:19.140]  and I had a headline that said,
[59:19.140 --> 59:22.820]  food not bombs, we never sell out on this flyer,
[59:22.820 --> 59:26.220]  and that was the end of using the Food for Free Committee.
[59:26.220 --> 59:29.320]  We just became Food Not Bombs after that.
[59:29.320 --> 59:34.320]  So, today, so for the first eight years,
[59:36.740 --> 59:40.380]  we were in Boston, and I lived in Boston.
[59:40.400 --> 59:41.960]  I was a painter in Boston,
[59:44.640 --> 59:47.760]  going to art school and doing sculpture and painting,
[59:47.760 --> 59:51.200]  and my American history professor was Howard Zinn,
[59:51.200 --> 59:53.200]  and some of you might have heard of him,
[59:53.200 --> 59:56.680]  and he wrote A People's History of the United States,
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.600]  and then I moved out to San Francisco,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.600]  and 1988, I started the second chapter,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.320]  and I thought, well, San Francisco,
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.900]  I'd been in and out of there my whole life,
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.660]  it's a really hip town.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.740]  Well, I just set up at Golden Gate Park
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.040]  with some of my friends,
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.500]  and we'll serve food every Monday at Golden Gate Park,
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.260]  and we decided to do that because the soup kitchen,
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.580]  just like we're doing with COVID now,
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.180]  in that case, there was a soup kitchen
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.060]  that served Tuesday through Friday,
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.580]  and there was meals on Saturday and Sunday at churches,
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.220]  but no food for people living in the park on Mondays,
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.800]  and part of our guests there
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.400]  were whatever the Grateful Dead passed through
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400]  at the Oakland Coliseum or something,
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.700]  we'd have huge numbers of people come to eat,
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.540]  but it turned out on August 15th of 1988,
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.360]  the San Francisco police arrested me and eight other people
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.840]  for serving food without a permit,
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.920]  and as it turned out, we had applied for a permit
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920]  and that on July 11th,
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.500]  and we never heard back from the government.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.260]  They had no intention of issuing a permit,
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.900]  it turned out no permit existed,
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.140]  but that catapulted us into global notoriety.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.320]  There was a next,
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.860]  maybe the next Monday or the Monday after that,
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.540]  CNN broadcast riot police arresting
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.800]  about over like 25 people for feeding people,
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.540]  and it just was in the times of London
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160]  and New York Times and so on,
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.080]  there's all these stories.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.320]  So people started writing letters and calling
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.280]  to figure out how to start a Food Not Bombs,
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.200]  and so I had taken notes on how I started the second one
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.880]  and I wrote, I made a flyer called
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.800]  "'Seven Steps to Starting the Food Not Bombs,"
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.280]  and I'd send it to the people that were interested.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.920]  So before long, there were chapters
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.760]  in Victoria, British Columbia,
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.680]  Lower East Side in New York City,
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:07.700]  down in Washington, DC, Long Beach, California,
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.060]  and then the next year we did,
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.940]  people living on the streets started an encampment
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.660]  in front of City Hall as a protest,
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.220]  and they were modeling their action after Tenement Square.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:24.400]  So this is before there was a massacre.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.420]  This is in the news,
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.300]  students camping out in front of their government building,
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.680]  so these people, they're calling it Tenement Square
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.360]  as opposed to Tenement Square,
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.840]  or Tent City protest was another such thing.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.360]  So about probably 300 or 400 people
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.120]  camped out in front of City Hall,
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.200]  and it lasted 27 days,
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.980]  and we provided vegan meals 24 hours a day
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.480]  for those 27 days,
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.080]  and then arrests started again,
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.080]  and only ended the night of October 17th of 89
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:06.260]  when Loma Prieta hit,
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.020]  and all the power of electricity and gas
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.900]  went off in San Francisco.
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.420]  There was the game between the A's and the Giants,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.860]  candlestick, they had to evacuate that,
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.620]  and we found ourselves as the only food
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.960]  in town for the first three days.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.440]  So the police ended up having to eat with us,
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.720]  and that's ultimately why they stopped arresting us,
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.240]  because we were their food.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.080]  But that just generated all this interest,
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.460]  so we ended up having,
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:45.880]  we decided that we would do our first world gathering
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.880]  on October 10th and 11th in 92,
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.300]  because there was going to be an indigenous
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.060]  First Nations protest against the 500 years of Columbus
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.100]  in San Francisco, which had been chosen
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.380]  as the official city to mark the 500th anniversary
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.840]  because of the Columbus Day Parade on Columbus Avenue,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.020]  which was the oldest parade,
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.100]  and Columbus Day Parade in the country.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.040]  And so there was a massive protest afterwards,
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.300]  but during the gathering, we decided on three principles.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.840]  About 70 people showed up, mostly from the US,
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  but also some from Canada,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.740]  and we decided that the food would always be vegan
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.960]  or vegetarian and free to anyone,
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.760]  rich or poor, drunk or sober,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.380]  that there'd be no leaders or presidents
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.720]  or directors or headquarters,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.240]  that each group would be a collective
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.020]  that would make decisions by consensus
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.360]  and try to involve the people that depended on the food
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.260]  in helping organize and determine the direction
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.900]  of the local chapter.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.480]  And third, that we're not a charity,
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.560]  but they're dedicated to nonviolent direct action
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.580]  to change society so that no one has to live in the streets
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.620]  or eat at a soup kitchen.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.780]  And so those principles and the seven steps and the logo
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.260]  have been the glue that has kind of held together
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.460]  Food Not Bombs chapters
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.380]  in now over a thousand cities of the world
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.040]  and over 65 countries.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.520]  So, you know, and I've been very blessed
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.080]  to have traveled the world to visit these chapters
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.080]  in many places, and it's just,
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.000]  it's mind blowing that this happens.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.600]  And then here in Santa Cruz, we do it every day.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.080]  This is our 176th day in a row.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.660]  And we need, one of our biggest issues is volunteers,
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.020]  although we've been having very consistent volunteers,
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.900]  but we could use more and funding
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.360]  because we are renting two kitchens right now.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:59.220]  And so that's where a lot of the resources are going.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.980]  But also, you know, we have a whole,
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.940]  we have a shipping container that we,
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.860]  it's refrigerated that we place the back food
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.760]  that needs to be refrigerated.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.160]  We essentially are doing a lot of what we had done
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:19.120]  from the very beginning, which is we are recovering food
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.000]  now often directly from farmers
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.640]  because they're having a really hard time.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:27.640]  And that food we turn into these meals
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.880]  and give out groceries.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.400]  And like, for instance, today,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.400]  we gave a ton of food to the Beach Flats,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.980]  you know, the garden there to the families down there.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.540]  And, you know, so we have this massive network,
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.300]  not only the free meals every day at Laurel and Front Street,
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.620]  weekends with the meals really officially start at four
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:53.940]  and end at six, but we often have snacks and stuff
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.900]  as early as like two o'clock.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.860]  And then Monday through Friday,
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.600]  we're there from noon until six o'clock.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.700]  And it's probably in the,
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.060]  it was definitely around 200 people a day
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.100]  towards the end of the month.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:14.100]  And it's probably more like 120 to 150 people right now
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.380]  at this time in the month.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.860]  But there's definitely a growing, growing consistent need.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.580]  We're all, for the most part,
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.180]  polyculture cannabis farmers,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.700]  meaning that cannabis is our main crop,
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.320]  but in the understory, we grow other plants.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.480]  And a lot of it's vegetables and flowers
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.120]  and, you know, mixed varieties.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.600]  So I guess my question is to you,
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.240]  what like, what are the top crops
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.320]  that are really powerful to receive, you know,
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.440]  that we could advocate for, you know?
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:54.240]  Well, you know, we can get potatoes and onions
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.480]  and we do use a lot of them,
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.060]  but organic greens of different kinds would be great.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.060]  So cabbages, squash, both winter and summer squash,
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.100]  herbs are very useful, those kinds of things.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.660]  And so, and the best thing to do is to deliver,
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.700]  if you can, one of our other issues
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.980]  is we are limited in our vehicle capacity.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.320]  So we have to, you know, we're like,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.120]  have to move things in and out of our vehicle.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.440]  So if it's possible to deliver to the Little Red Church
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.900]  at Lincoln and Cedar Street, that is a big help.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:41.720]  You can contact us if it's a real big,
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.680]  if it's a small load,
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.080]  you can just drop it off at the meal between,
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.800]  like, it's good to drop it off around,
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.280]  on the weekdays, around two or three o'clock.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.740]  So we have time to get it into the refrigerator and so on.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.540]  But on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays,
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.820]  you could just drop off at the church
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.480]  anytime from around noon on in the afternoon.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.260]  Thank you so much for sharing all that history.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.300]  I was curious, did you know my friend Parusha Obluda?
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.420]  Yeah, nice.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.940]  He had the show on KPFA, but I grew up with, you know,
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.940]  he was our roommate growing up
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.720]  and every weekend he was always cooking up a bunch of soup
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.400]  and going out to food not bombs.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.240]  That's beautiful.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.760]  Yeah, it is, yeah.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.600]  That's so cool.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.100]  Yeah, it's a big, it's an amazing family of people.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.680]  It's just, you know, in Santa Cruz,
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.400]  there's couples that are here with children
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.120]  who met doing food not bombs, you know?
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.560]  And so I run into their children and they'll go,
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.480]  yeah, I'm here because of food not bombs,
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.280]  because my mom and dad met feeding people
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.920]  wherever it was, you know?
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.780]  And there's like four generation food not bombs chapters,
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.460]  you know, it's like grandparents, great grandparents,
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:59.420]  the mom and dad, the kids, you know, it's like insane.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.100]  Yeah.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:02.940]  I grew up in Struggle Mountain,
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.860]  it was Joan Baez's old place and part of the land
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.060]  and the back of the land movement
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.940]  out there in the Santa Cruz Hills.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.500]  That's beautiful, wow.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.520]  Just quickly to, so to keep on raising more money,
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.100]  we gotta put more items up.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.020]  What was the winning, that was Dave Zno there for how much?
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.100]  450 and then Adam should be sending 751.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.300]  Adam's also wondering who to send the 520,
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.580]  or the 25 to for the overnight, he's pretty serious.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.540]  Maybe he can just talk to,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:45.980]  we can connect him with Dan to.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.240]  He can just add that 25 into the, to the seven.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.080]  Yeah.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.080]  So just do another 25 on the food not bombs donation.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:59.520]  And so Keith, can you confirm that you're seeing 450
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.700]  at some point?
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.160]  And then Jackson, what was your next,
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.560]  I'm gonna create the graphic for it
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.020]  while you're talking about it, but what was the next one?
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:14.020]  Well, so I've got a 751 has come in and a 450.
[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:23.490]  So the 751 was G unit, right?
[01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.490]  No, sorry, that was Santa Cruz, that was Adam, right?
[01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.330]  Yeah.
[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:28.150]  Adam Brooks, yeah.
[01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:30.850]  Yeah, 450 should be from Dave.
[01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.650]  So we're all paid up so far.
[01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:35.050]  And then G unit was a thousand, right?
[01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:35.930]  Right.
[01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:36.830]  Yeah.
[01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:41.490]  All right, I am keeping these spreadsheet up to date
[01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:45.170]  tonight, which is a, I feel like that's gonna pay dividends
[01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.250]  tomorrow morning when I wake up hungover.
[01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:53.690]  All right, so Jackson, what was the next one?
[01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:59.570]  So that one is the clone I call Coca Cola.
[01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:03.090]  And that's like, it's like a-
[01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:03.930]  COCOA?
[01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:11.570]  COCOLA, Coca Cola.
[01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:15.150]  Two words or one?
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.230]  Two words.
[01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:23.350]  Okay, Coca Cola, Coca Cola.
[01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:26.990]  Crossed with the Animal West F3 mail.
[01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:31.390]  How do you spell animal and what was the next one?
[01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:32.230]  West.
[01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.050]  Oh, West.
[01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.890]  W, yep, West.
[01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:34.730]  F3.
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.950]  What is the Animal West?
[01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:37.790]  Yeah, what's the Animal West?
[01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:42.310]  Animal West is animal cookies crossed with a Cherry West.
[01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.990]  Which is the cherry pie.
[01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:50.270]  And then I bred it forward to be, it's just like a,
[01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:54.150]  right, it's like all cookies, they're all purple.
[01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:56.590]  It's darker than the animal cookies.
[01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:58.750]  It's pretty nice.
[01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:02.510]  Okay, so it's a Coca Cola crossed with an Animal West F3
[01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:04.390]  and it's 20 seeds.
[01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:07.030]  20 seeds and I haven't grown them yet.
[01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.710]  They basically like brand new.
[01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:11.550]  I would grow the hell out of them outside,
[01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:13.990]  but they're probably not that good for inside.
[01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.630]  So if people are bidding on them, I'd say to,
[01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.470]  if you're outside, it'd be,
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:23.350]  you're more likely to have success with them
[01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.270]  just because inside the root beer is pretty unstable.
[01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.870]  200 a good place to start?
[01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:30.710]  Start at three.
[01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.790]  I mean, I always start things really low,
[01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:34.950]  but you can start wherever you want.
[01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.750]  Here, let me get my bidding face on real quick.
[01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:40.910]  No, dude, no.
[01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:41.790]  No.
[01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.590]  Real quick right now.
[01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:47.630]  So I'll put that bidding face on
[01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:51.910]  and I'll start this shit off at $500 right now.
[01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:54.110]  You're blacklisted on this one.
[01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:55.270]  I'm not blacklisted.
[01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:58.110]  My fiance gave me permission to bid on this one
[01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:01.030]  and I'm gonna grow that shit.
[01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.310]  I was already gonna get you a different Coca Cola one
[01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:05.110]  so you could find a vanilla bourbon.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.750]  32 me talk, 32 me talk.
[01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.590]  Lord, Lord.
[01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.950]  Let's start this off at $500 people.
[01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:20.190]  Okay, that sounds good to me.
[01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:27.830]  I've got a Coca Cola story if there ends up a break.
[01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:31.670]  Sure, let's hear the Coca Cola story.
[01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:36.670]  Okay, so we're in Brattle Square, Harvard Square really,
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.790]  doing Food Not Bombs every day.
[01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:44.430]  And it's like maybe an 82 or something like that, 81.
[01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.150]  And there was a thing called the Pepsi Challenge.
[01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:51.190]  And so they set up right next to us
[01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:54.550]  with their kind of pop-up tent type thing they had.
[01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:59.550]  And the idea was you would get blindfolded
[01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:02.550]  and they would have college kids open up all the Coke
[01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:04.670]  so it'd go flat.
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:06.830]  So then you would see which you like better,
[01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:10.070]  the Pepsi or the Coke, right?
[01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.550]  And so you'd always choose Pepsi
[01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.950]  because it was the one that wasn't flat.
[01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:16.790]  And that line would go right by our table
[01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:18.990]  and they have a lot of advertising and stuff.
[01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:21.270]  So we had like this great crowd.
[01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:24.950]  So we had also received a broach.
[01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:27.310]  We moved the New England Free Press
[01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:29.550]  and they had this information about death squads
[01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:33.990]  killing labor organizers in the cane fields in Guatemala
[01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.110]  for sugar for Coca-Cola.
[01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:41.350]  And so we had big stacks of those from this overprints.
[01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:44.830]  And so we decided what we would do
[01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:48.990]  is we would start the tofu smoothie challenge
[01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:51.150]  as we'd been received little cups
[01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:53.790]  that were just like the Pepsi Challenge cups.
[01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.030]  So we have like our sign,
[01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.590]  take the tofu smoothie challenge.
[01:15:57.590 --> 01:16:00.590]  There's more nutrition in this one cup of tofu smoothie
[01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.750]  than all the products that Pepsi makes.
[01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:05.350]  And then we'd hand you a brochure
[01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:08.550]  about the Coke hiring death squads in Guatemala.
[01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:11.790]  And that went on for like maybe a week or two
[01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.550]  and they would call the police on us
[01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:15.190]  because they're very upset.
[01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:17.310]  But we turned out we were good friends
[01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.390]  with the Cambridge police.
[01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:21.350]  And then they go,
[01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:22.630]  well, if you don't really like them
[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:24.990]  doing the tofu smoothie challenge next to you,
[01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:26.470]  then move to another corner.
[01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:29.550]  They like packed up, gave us the middle finger
[01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:31.310]  and went off to another corner.
[01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:33.710]  We had to go do street theater some other way.
[01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.830]  So we're at what?
[01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:41.510]  500, I haven't looked at the chat,
[01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:42.950]  but what are we at right now?
[01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:46.710]  500 still from Nick?
[01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:49.670]  Yeah.
[01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:56.270]  I thought we saw a 510 or something.
[01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:57.790]  I thought we did see a 510,
[01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.270]  but then there's a bunch of...
[01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:02.310]  Looks like Andre Foster 510.
[01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:12.480]  And Jackson, what else can you tell us about?
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.880]  There we go.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.400]  Andre Foster confirms his 510 bid.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.240]  Cool.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.600]  The Coca-Cola is really cool.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.360]  It's a root beer that has the same profile,
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.560]  but it's louder than the mom.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.560]  It's from the second back cross,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.480]  back to the root beer.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.760]  Last year I had about, I think, 90 root beers
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.280]  and it was the most visibly resinous
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.320]  and it got the really loud, loud root beer terps
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.160]  from really early out.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.160]  And then it kind of got this like chocolate cola smell
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.040]  that stuck out to me too.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.000]  So that's why I called it Coca-Cola
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.800]  because it was like a chocolate cola.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.760]  And then the mom,
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.720]  and then it's just a little,
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.280]  it grows faster than root beer.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.440]  It roots earlier.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.920]  It buds faster.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.200]  It gets bigger buds.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.200]  It looks better.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.240]  It's just a really, really nice plant.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.520]  And it's a little more stable.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:28.320]  And then the Animal West is just like,
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.320]  really consistently purple.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.960]  There's on my Instagram, there's pictures of Animal West.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.040]  It's like real consistently purple,
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.720]  all kind of the same kind of a deep color.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.880]  It doesn't have to get cold to get dark.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.200]  The smells range from kind of like a really,
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.120]  like a deep, deep animal cookies kind of smell
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  to like almost with like a touch of like gelato 41
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.560]  or something a little more of that sweet on top of it.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.440]  They're nice.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.320]  It's a nice, it's really nice for a cookie seed.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.360]  And I know that the combination will wind up
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:14.400]  being a cool combo.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.320]  And like I said, if you grow them outdoor,
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.240]  they'll be totally stable.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.040]  You grow them indoor, I'm not really sure,
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.560]  but like I said, they haven't been grown yet.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.120]  They're just still just getting cut.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:29.960]  So.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.960]  What's the root beer?
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.320]  The root beer is the headband, the old, old headband,
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.040]  the one they call LA Kush.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.800]  It's like a sour diesel, but skunkier.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.760]  It's a really, really good, like,
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:48.560]  it's like if you could get like sour diesel
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.360]  that was just better than sour diesel,
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.360]  it's kind of what it is.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.920]  It's gonna be that hard to do.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.160]  That was crossed with a,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.160]  that was crossed with,
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.160]  I took a old black Afi from up here
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.240]  and I put it on the old Hindu clone from here.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.400]  And then I put that on the Hollywood pure Kush,
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.520]  the OG type.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.520]  And then I took that male and I put that on,
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.680]  on that headband.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.880]  And then out of that, I grew some of those out
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:23.200]  and one of them was just a really nice plant.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.520]  And I kept it around because it was great weed.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.520]  And I liked how it looked.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.280]  It finished like October 10th,
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.320]  the first time I grew it from seed.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.320]  Nice, like seven and a half, almost eight pounds, I think.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.920]  And just like really nice to harvest, really easy,
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.960]  like really kind of neatly arranged plant.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.760]  You can see what root beer seeds look like on,
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.720]  if you go way back on my Instagram, you can see,
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.200]  it's just like really neat, pretty weed.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.080]  And then,
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.600]  just it turned out to be like, I had it and I kept it
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.720]  because it was such a nice plant.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.160]  And then we smoked it and smoked it
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.400]  and smoked tons of other stuff.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.480]  And after a while we were like,
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:04.240]  damn, this is like way better than we thought it was.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.640]  And then eventually I was like,
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:11.000]  this really smells like soda, like cola.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.640]  And then I realized it smelled a lot like root beer.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.920]  And then I just started calling it root beer.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.240]  And that's what that is.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.160]  But I back-crossed to it.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.160]  I had a male that was the same Hollywood cross,
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.920]  Hindu cross Afi male.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.840]  I called that OG Coffee.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.760]  I put that on sour and I put that on headband.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.640]  And so I got the root beer clone that first year,
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.680]  I hit it with the sour version
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.680]  instead of the headband version.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.600]  And then I took that out of that.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.720]  Then I back-crossed again to the root beer
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.440]  and then I back-crossed again to the root beer.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.520]  So it's like not quite the same thing.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.960]  It's not completely like a inbred back-cross,
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.720]  but the only difference was it was sour instead of headband.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.160]  So it was like a really good way to do it
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.360]  because it wasn't that different.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.760]  And it just turned out those seeds came out really good
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.520]  and they kill it outside.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.880]  But they're just not that great for the inside.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.200]  So it's just still a work in progress
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.000]  to get it in a good seed, but it's outside.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.480]  It just smashes like, you get weed from top to bottom on them
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:34.000]  it's just a really, really pretty stretchy plant.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.400]  And all of them from them are pretty consistently,
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.120]  like they really butt up nice and they're really pretty.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.400]  Like I said, you can look back on my Instagram feed
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.120]  and there's some cool pictures of them.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.000]  So is this the Animal West?
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.400]  That's the Animal West, yeah, that Skunk Tech did inside.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.320]  And it's like a lot of cookie funk,
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.520]  but then it has more, a little bit more
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.200]  of the squishier texture from the Black Affie in Hindu.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.320]  So it's not like, you know, the animal is so dense
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.920]  that when you go to break it up to roll it,
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.000]  it likes to kind of shred up.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.080]  But the Animal West is a little bit better,
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.280]  like for joints, because it's got a little bit
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.680]  more sponginess to it.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.720]  It's nice, they're really pretty outside too.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.160]  That was inside that Skunk Tech did that one.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.800]  That's regular animal right there.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.120]  So the animal too, the animal that I got,
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.080]  I got the animal like in the first wave
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.080]  of it being ever leaked from Sear gave it to like
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.600]  a few dudes, Frost Boss, Unknown Prophet,
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.120]  a few different people.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.080]  And I just had like the dumb luck of my buddy, Mike Meesey
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.880]  was like, hey Jack, I got this,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.000]  these red solo cups with these, with this.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.240]  So this is the cookies called animal cookies.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.440]  And I was like, all right, I got it.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.760]  That was like end of 2009 probably.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.600]  So it was like people hadn't, you know,
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.720]  hadn't been around yet.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.960]  It was like the very first, I think me and like
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.720]  four other people were the first people to get it.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.200]  So it is the real, it was the real one.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.920]  And then I crossed it with Cherry West,
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:30.720]  but Cherry West was at that point a seed line
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.640]  and I used a male out of it.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.880]  The male that I used didn't carry any of that terpeneline
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:40.280]  that was really rare in the original Cherry West.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.320]  So even though it's animal cookies crossed Cherry West,
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:49.080]  it's a different, it's a different direction.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.080]  So that right there is a little bit different.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.600]  That was the animal West put back
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.480]  on the animal cookies again.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.280]  And then I crossed that with sour strawberry.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.240]  So it's a little bit different in the directions, you know,
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.240]  it does look pretty similar to that.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.760]  Except this is a little bit more leafy
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:18.760]  and not quite as dark.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.840]  It's a little bit more bright,
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.360]  but those are pretty similar,
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.480]  but that's a little, that's a different line.
[01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:34.910]  And we have a winner at, what was it?
[01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:35.830]  520?
[01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:37.630]  520.
[01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:39.430]  520.
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.100]  Nick, you were outbid by 20 bucks, right?
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.620]  Shit, how the fuck are you gonna limit me to $500?
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.700]  540 was a winning bid.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.820]  I'm about to break up with the love of my life
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:59.100]  over 20 fucking dollars right now.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.220]  She didn't even answer.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.540]  She's like, ah, close the bedroom door.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.100]  He's stoked you guys got 500 bucks.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.900]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.580]  Hey Jackson, real quick before they go to the next thing,
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:14.340]  you were talking about terpeneline.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.860]  I'm sitting here with a tray of your juker's cock.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:21.980]  That's got all the terpeneline, yeah.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:26.100]  Yeah, this is the F1, the one I sent you a picture
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.460]  and I know we can't get it.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.700]  I can't get this in this screen.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.700]  This is the most metallic blood terpeneline type smells
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:39.580]  I have ever smelled on a plant.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.700]  And I went through about 120
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.820]  of these juker's cocks this year.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.780]  Jackson's been good to me in my medical stuff
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.700]  and everything else, but this strain is so offensive
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:55.500]  in a blood metallic smell in a good way.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.900]  I know that sounds weird, but it's a good way
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:03.700]  that Shannon wants to make it into potpourri.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.220]  I mean, like she loves this smell,
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.980]  this and the penis so much
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.980]  that it's, I mean, she's not a smoker.
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.460]  So that's some of her favorite things to even grow and smell.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.100]  So big props to you on the terpenes, man.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:23.260]  I mean, this is a consistent thing in our family
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:27.300]  that she's just crazy about and she's not a smoker.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.220]  Nice.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.340]  Just a minute ago, she walked by and she's like,
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.180]  what are you trimming?
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:35.140]  I was like, and as soon as I said juker's cock,
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.580]  she almost finished the sentence.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.740]  So just mad love to you, man.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:40.980]  I appreciate everything.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.460]  So you said Jupiter and she said cock.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.220]  Yeah, dude, you don't even want to get me started.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:51.100]  My backyard in one field is nothing but Jupiter's cock.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.740]  And there she is standing in these 12 foot tall
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.220]  Jupiter's cock plants, just scrogging them down.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.780]  And she's like, oh, look at me standing in all this cock.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.220]  And I'm like, you know, it's one thing for me to say it.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.140]  It's a different thing for you to say it.
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:05.540]  You need to calm down over there.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.380]  So, but yeah, the terpenes on this stuff,
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:14.900]  I mean, it's like, I don't know how to,
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.300]  it's almost like the cherry is so fermented,
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.260]  the cherry, the fruit has turned into gas
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:23.980]  and then it goes into a blood smell.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:28.980]  But it's one of my favorite strains of this year.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.740]  We consistently keep it going.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.500]  Yeah, but the name is hilarious.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.500]  I actually sent some of this back to a buddy
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.060]  in a different state and he was like, man, it's great weed,
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.940]  but I got a friend that won't even smoke it.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.900]  Cause he's like, I can't put anything named cock
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:48.740]  in my mouth.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.860]  And I was like, well, that's on him
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:51.340]  cause it tastes fabulous.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.700]  So, you know, people are,
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.740]  the name is one thing,
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.620]  but the smells on it is completely different.
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:06.020]  It's all terpene, it's all fermented cherry,
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.260]  a little bit of like rotten lime,
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:13.100]  but mostly it goes back in that fermented cherry.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.500]  But I just want to say what's up man, one more time.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:19.180]  And it's close to one o'clock in the morning here
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.020]  on the East Coast.
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:21.780]  So I'm gonna hop off here on this one
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.860]  and I lost this stuff by $20,
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.820]  but you all have a wonderful evening.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.940]  And I appreciate all the love people are doing for charity
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.020]  cause I wouldn't even be talking to here without charity.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.020]  So much love to you guys.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.780]  Now we'll talk to you all soon.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.940]  All right, thanks Nick.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.260]  Hey Jackson, I just want to say, man,
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.700]  I really liked your t-shirt.
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.500]  I don't know if anybody else has read it yet,
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.860]  but I'm a big fan of that particular t-shirt.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:48.660]  I got this.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:51.260]  Every time I looked, I could only see the top half of it.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.260]  So it was just like, there's no business.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:56.340]  And then now I'm finally seeing the full shirt.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:59.860]  Yeah, I got that from my buddy.
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:01.980]  It was-
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.220]  Wait, was Nick wearing the same hat as you?
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.060]  Yeah.
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:05.900]  Okay.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.220]  Yeah, I was trying to bite my tongue there,
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.980]  but I really want one of those hats.
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:09.820]  Fuck.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:10.660]  I gotta get a-
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.220]  That is a one fine fucking hat.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.740]  I'll say, of all the hats that are going around,
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:19.540]  it's a really nice hat.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.140]  And who's that from?
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.980]  These are grassroots hats.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:29.460]  These are grassroots hats with the hemp canvas.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.300]  So they're like shiny.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.060]  They never get dirty, really.
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.340]  Like I've worn this in the river and the ocean all year,
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.860]  and it's like just stayed totally new.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.180]  They have the nice embroidery on the bottom
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.260]  and they have the silk in the inside,
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.420]  all custom printed with the flowers.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.180]  And they're really nice.
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:52.540]  My buddy, my buddy Shanti Farms on Instagram,
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.220]  he helped me design them.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.460]  He kind of steered.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.700]  He was like, oh, let's put this here and put that there.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.660]  And they came out really nice.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.180]  Those guys do really nice work
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.660]  and they're easy to work with.
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:08.580]  They weren't a pain in the ass to have something made
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.740]  that was kind of elaborate at all.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:14.340]  Like this was kind of a streamlined one.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.740]  They can do just tons of stuff on there.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.060]  I remember going to the first,
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.340]  I don't know if it was the first and only,
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:25.500]  but the 710 Cup in Denver,
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.500]  and that was like 2014 or something like that.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.380]  And it was at Grassroots and then Adam Dunn's place.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.580]  What was that, Hood Lab or Hood?
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.660]  Hood Lamb, yeah.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.660]  Yeah, Hood Lamb.
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:46.420]  That's when I, that was my introduction to Grassroots.
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:52.260]  So I emailed Bodhi to see if he wants,
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.300]  he was taking care of kids and see if he wants to come on.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.700]  But can any of you guys talk,
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:03.260]  he has six things he's offering up.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.380]  Can you guys kind of talk about him
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:08.780]  while we start with the first one?
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.460]  Talk about Bodhi?
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.300]  Yeah.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.260]  And let me actually.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.580]  So let me show you what we're gonna,
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.540]  well, go ahead if you have something to say,
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.100]  but I'll grab it.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.060]  Yeah, Bodhi's hella cool.
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:31.900]  Bodhi's super cool to me because he's like way, way,
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.460]  way interested in all kinds of trippy stuff.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:40.140]  And it was funny, the first time I met him,
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:43.460]  I was talking to my friend, George,
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.420]  and we were all standing together
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.740]  and he was talking to him and he's like,
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.820]  yeah, I was doing the,
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.260]  I was growing this and growing that.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:54.340]  And he goes, oh, and I was growing that good medicine
[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:55.900]  and it came out really good.
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.260]  And so thanks for that.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.460]  And he had just introduced me a minute before
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:02.060]  and was like, oh, this is my buddy, Bodhi.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:02.900]  And I was like, oh, cool.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.660]  And then I was like, oh, you're Bodhi, the seed guy?
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.500]  And he was like, yeah.
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.140]  And I was like, oh, damn, dude, that's super cool.
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.580]  You do a lot of crazy work.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.220]  Like I had seen these lists online
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:13.860]  of like his different crosses and stuff.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.420]  And I was like, wow, that guy's doing a lot,
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.620]  does a lot of crazy stuff.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:19.860]  And I met him for like, we stood there,
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.660]  I talked to him for 30 seconds or something.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.020]  The next time I saw him,
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:29.020]  he was doing his Santa Claus trip at the Emerald Cup.
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:32.220]  And he had like this crazy different incenses
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:37.220]  and like tree resins and like Palo Santo
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:42.940]  and also a bunch of really cool tobacco seeds.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.940]  He's like, oh, I heard you that you grow tobacco
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:45.780]  a little bit.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.460]  And I was like, yeah, I do some.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.620]  And he had given me like, I don't know,
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:55.620]  like five or six, like really cool tobacco varieties.
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:00.740]  One from Maria Sabina's garden in Oaxaca
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:04.980]  and one that was from like ancient,
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:07.900]  they had found the seeds in like an ancient burial mound
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:10.100]  in British Columbia, I think.
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.300]  They were like a thousand years old or something,
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.580]  but they would have been frozen.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.420]  So they got them back, made more seeds
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.220]  and Bodhi wound up with them and gave me some of those.
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.380]  And this year I did some of the Maria Sabina ones
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:22.580]  and those are beautiful.
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:27.140]  The plants are like eight feet tall and five gallon pots
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.820]  and just getting tons of flowers right now on them and stuff.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:32.860]  And Bodhi's just super cool.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.940]  That was like, kind of blew me away to like meet somebody
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:36.780]  just for a second.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.860]  And the next time you see him, they're like, oh, here,
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.500]  you know, he hooked me up with all this stuff.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.540]  It was super thoughtful.
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.340]  And every time you see Bodhi, he's just like the,
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.100]  you got the greatest vibe, you know, super cool,
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.980]  super cool guy and super nice.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:55.980]  And also just like so much interesting plant stuff
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:01.020]  and, you know, all different kind of stuff
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.260]  and the crazy, you know, he does the crazy traveling
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:08.100]  and collecting and, you know, he's a real heavy,
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:13.860]  heavy hitting seed guy.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.620]  It's crazy, like the stuff that he does.
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.820]  He just goes and chills out with people in the mountains
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:22.380]  and lives with them for a while and, you know,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:26.300]  gets seeds from people and brings heirloom veggie seeds
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.380]  and stuff for them, different things they don't have
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.020]  so that it won't like cross contaminate stuff
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:35.060]  and just like brings new species to new areas.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:40.060]  And so just quickly, this is why you're talking.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.380]  I'm gonna show the first pack.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.500]  200 or what?
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.740]  Let's start it at two and get it going.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.420]  Okay, keep talking.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.380]  So like Bodhi's work too, a lot of Bodhi's work
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:01.380]  is super collectible because people who are into Bodhi's
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:07.060]  stuff knows it's has, there's a lot of stuff in there
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.340]  that you can't get.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:13.340]  Like, you know, he's got a lot of different stuff.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:18.900]  Like this is Supernatural Selections is a side company
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.900]  where he takes like heirloom land race things.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:27.660]  So like improved land races, like the Vietnamese
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.460]  would be like an original collection from Vietnam
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.060]  and then bred to be like nice.
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:39.060]  And then crossed with this cashmere that he has
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.780]  that was like an original thing pure,
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:41.860]  but then bred to be nice.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:46.860]  So it's like original, real land race things,
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.700]  but then with a little bit of the kinks worked out
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:52.340]  and then in Supernatural Selections, he takes them
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:57.660]  and he makes true F1s to bring back like, you know,
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:02.180]  the kind of stuff that you would have seen way back
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:05.100]  in the day when people first started making these things
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:10.100]  with that crazy hybrid vigor and real unique combinations
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.100]  and stuff.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:14.220]  And so like a lot of this stuff, I know how he does.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.380]  Like, I don't know all this stuff,
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.500]  but I know how he does for auctions.
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.060]  He usually will pull out something and he'll be like,
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.300]  yeah, there's only, you know,
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.620]  I'm not sure about these ones,
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.540]  but a lot of times when he's given me stuff for auctions,
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.860]  he's like, yeah, there's only been three of these put out
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:33.020]  or I only dropped 10 of these or 20 of these or whatever.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:37.660]  So a lot of times when he auctions stuff,
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.060]  he wind up being able to get some stuff that, you know,
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.260]  you can't really get anywhere else.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.700]  So they're worth keeping an eye on for people
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.620]  who do know his stuff, like, you know,
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:51.820]  you know, gotta watch these.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:55.380]  And what are we at now?
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.260]  Like 360 or something?
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.460]  Looks like taco with 360.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.100]  Taco fall.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.280]  What else does Bode have up there?
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.320]  Just like know what's coming up next.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.160]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.760]  That's a good question, Jesse.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.960]  We got, so he has six things.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.120]  So actually I think once we get past this one,
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.760]  we could go maybe five minutes each and.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:40.840]  Just run through it, yeah.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.720]  Purple Goji, huh?
[01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:11.370]  So yeah, Jackson, you're gonna have to try to decipher,
[01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:15.730]  give people some color on what some of these might be.
[01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:17.210]  The pure fish shit, huh?
[01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:21.850]  Yeah, I mean, Bode, like he makes so many crosses,
[01:39:21.850 --> 01:39:22.690]  it's crazy.
[01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:25.410]  I always have to ask him or he'll kind of usually
[01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:30.290]  give me a heads up on what, you know, what stuff is.
[01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:33.610]  But I just, I assume when I see him give stuff to auctions,
[01:39:33.610 --> 01:39:35.770]  he usually puts stuff up for auction
[01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:40.290]  that he either only gave away
[01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:43.330]  or that he hardly released any of, you know?
[01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:47.810]  Like stuff that's pretty much not,
[01:39:47.970 --> 01:39:48.930]  you don't really get it.
[01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:50.290]  Like I think those Gojis,
[01:39:50.290 --> 01:39:52.210]  I don't think he put out very many of those
[01:39:52.210 --> 01:39:53.650]  at all, the worked Goji.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.740]  All right, and this is the one we're on right now.
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:15.400]  Someone asked what generation of stabilization
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.480]  and filial are these?
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.600]  These are F1.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  So they're gonna be, you know, Vietnamese is like,
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.800]  is very, very narrow leaf, you know, tripped out.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.080]  Hardcore, you know, knock you in the head,
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.160]  get you really flying.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.200]  We typically, and then cashmere is more of a,
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.680]  that's more of like a hash, you know, for hash production.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.520]  More of a broad leaf as far as I know.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:53.200]  I don't know about the specific line,
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.360]  but when I look at it, I imagine that he probably took
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.720]  something long running and something a little quicker
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.160]  and mashed them up.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.480]  And then you're gonna get,
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.960]  in that first generation is where you're gonna get
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:08.160]  really special stuff.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.200]  And then, you know, if he would have bred them again,
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.240]  then all of a sudden you get a bunch of crazy stuff
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.000]  would pop back out and then you'd have to stabilize it
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:16.840]  going forward.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  But the F1 is really the best place to get a clone out of.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.640]  If you're just looking for a keeper,
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:29.480]  that's the F1 generation on a cross like this.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.720]  This would be where, if it was me,
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.880]  where I'd wanna get a clone to keep, you know,
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.320]  because there's gonna be a level of vigor
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.480]  that's gonna be hard to beat, you know.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.080]  So on a side note, Adam Corlett said,
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.880]  please ask Jackson how he selected the sour strawberry
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.480]  in one of his crosses.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:01.600]  Well, that's really funny actually,
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.640]  because I didn't, what happened was I had a pack
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:11.880]  that I bought from Bog when he was at the farmer's market
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.480]  at Healing Harvest years ago.
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.920]  And I was just hanging out and I was like,
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.920]  oh, he had a bunch of crosses.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.000]  And I was like, okay, well, I'll try the sour bubble
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.400]  and the sour strawberry.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.640]  And then I think I got a couple other ones.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.120]  And then I grew them and I had them in little,
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.960]  I had them in little six inch pots.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.240]  And I wound up having too many different things going on.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.640]  And so I was like, all right,
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.160]  I'm just gonna get rid of the males from these,
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.920]  cause they're just little plants.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.240]  And I wound up thinking I had killed all the males,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.880]  but then I discovered that there was one male left
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:53.320]  and it had opened probably like four or five flowers
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.200]  down on the bottom of it.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.480]  And I was like, oh damn.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.600]  And I killed it.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.280]  And it was back with like some kind of like,
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.960]  oddball menagerie of little plants.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:09.120]  And so it wound up just blowing a little bit of pollen
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.080]  on a few different things.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.080]  And one of them was that animal cookies bat cross.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.240]  And there was a few different other things.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.240]  I don't think I ever planted.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.840]  Trying to remember which other crosses,
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.880]  but that one seems cool to me
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.520]  because of the sour strawberry girls
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.120]  were like really dense and frosty and had a great smell.
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.760]  And I was like, huh, it probably would go good with that.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.720]  So I went ahead and planted those seeds
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.640]  even though they were accidental.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.840]  I was like, screw it.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.520]  If I wouldn't have been so overwhelmed,
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.240]  I might've made it on purpose anyway.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.000]  And then when I popped them, I was like,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.560]  damn, these things are pretty.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.680]  They had all the frost from the animal
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:55.000]  and they had a little bit of extra,
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.240]  like a jelly thing from the sour strawberry.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.920]  And it just wound up being a kind of cool thing.
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.520]  So I kept playing with it.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.760]  I just, I grew the F1s and I made a couple F2s
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.680]  and I've grown a couple of the different F2s
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.080]  and made some F3 lines with it now.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.480]  And so it was just accidental,
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.280]  but it was something that I wanted to do something with,
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.200]  but gave up on.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.320]  And it was like, nope, you're not giving up on me.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:27.360]  And so then it was just a happy accident.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.200]  And then I have other crosses too that it was on
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.040]  because there was no,
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.840]  there wasn't supposed to be pollen back there,
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.160]  but then there was four or five little flowers.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.040]  And that was how that ended up happening.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.640]  It's trippy, but turned out to be good luck.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:50.700]  All right, and we're at 400 or does someone come up?
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.140]  Someone come up?
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:56.820]  We're at 400 right now with never, and a minute to go.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.980]  I love all the YouTube names.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:17.790]  Fat Damon, we could have a winner.
[01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:24.550]  Let me just show what the,
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.280]  so that's what's up right now.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.540]  And then this is what's coming.
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:46.510]  Keith, this is the cannabis version of fundraising.
[01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:57.670]  Wait, you're muted.
[01:45:57.670 --> 01:45:59.030]  Hold on, let me unmute you.
[01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:05.060]  Wait, still muted, hold on.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.500]  Yeah.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.940]  Yeah, so yeah, my first pound was when I was like 14, 15
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.340]  in Salt Lake out of a back of his car.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:18.260]  15 and Salt Lake out of a back of a car
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:20.700]  and driven up from Yuma.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.620]  It was probably the worst part ever.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.900]  Wait, so you grew up in Boston?
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:33.820]  So I grew up in National Parks.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.500]  And so I lived at Yosemite, Grand Canyon,
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.100]  Big Bend, Everglades, Shenandoah, Rocky Mountain.
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:47.060]  And then I went, a lot of Park Service kids go away
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.020]  to Utah for high school
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:53.340]  to what used to be a very inexpensive boarding school.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.100]  So I did a lot of high school in Utah.
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:01.540]  And then I went to, my mom's from Boston
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.260]  and we had, my dad's last job was in Boston.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:08.660]  So I went to high school, graduated there,
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:11.820]  went to Boston University, studied painting and sculpture.
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:16.820]  And so, but that's, and then I've lived a lot
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:23.100]  in San Francisco, a lot in Santa Cruz, Kansas City,
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:29.660]  Taos, New Mexico, Tucson, Arizona, Lawrence, Kansas.
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.660]  I'm jealous, I'm so jealous.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.940]  I lived in Istanbul for a while, that was fantastic.
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:43.620]  Christophe, you keep saying no traduction francais.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.940]  Merci beaucoup.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:53.140]  But then you're speaking kind of gibberish French.
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:59.180]  All right, so on that one, we had a winner.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.020]  It was-
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.660]  NetBurr with 400.
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.260]  Okay, where are you NetBurr?
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.420]  So let's do-
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.140]  I've got a notification here.
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:13.780]  No, that's somebody in between.
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:17.060]  Somebody donating $25.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:19.060]  Oh, that's Adam doing $25.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:23.140]  Oh yeah, Adam is on his shit tonight for the...
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:28.860]  All right, so NetBurr, do we put the-
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:31.140]  Link up to it or something?
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.860]  Yeah, the FoodNut bombs.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:33.940]  Oh yeah, there we go.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.460]  And then, sorry, while I'm doing this.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:47.980]  So the next one is...
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:53.060]  That's the one NetBurr took home,
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:54.300]  and this is the next one.
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.340]  So Jackson, decipher this for us.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:01.020]  All right, this one, strawberry milk.
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.380]  I don't know, someone in the comments
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:04.380]  might be able to help us out with that.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:09.540]  The Jalalabad star,
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:14.660]  I remember Bodhi put people up on,
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.180]  he told people where to get that.
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.900]  There's a guy in Russia
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.180]  who I was in contact with a little bit,
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:27.180]  and his brother brought stuff back from Afghanistan,
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:33.180]  and maybe Pakistan, definitely Afghanistan though.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.900]  And he said he brought it back
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:38.380]  maybe in like 83 or something like that,
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:39.940]  and then they just kept it,
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:43.940]  and kept it as an heirloom and kept making more.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:47.020]  It's just a really, really nice Afghani.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:52.020]  And I know that that's where Bodhi sourced his
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:54.060]  was from the Russian guy.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:01.340]  And so I haven't personally done any of it,
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:07.420]  but I know a guy that was doing some
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.220]  and said they were coming out like,
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:11.900]  they were coming out almost like,
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:15.220]  what did he say, like a lemon Larry,
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:18.820]  like a really, really good cushy Afghani,
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.300]  which I thought was super cool.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.420]  Which I thought was super cool.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.980]  So I assume because Bodhi has the seeds
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:27.700]  and has, I think, done increases,
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.180]  it probably has a lot.
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:31.740]  The one that he bred is probably really nice.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:33.780]  That's the only, that's all I know about that though.
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:34.940]  The strawberry milk,
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.700]  I know I've heard what it is before,
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.260]  but I can't remember.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:42.780]  And, you know, there probably,
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.100]  there's probably not a lot of these,
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.620]  like I said, if it's for the auction,
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.140]  but I can't say that for sure.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.420]  But someone in the comments might know
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:55.340]  cause heavy Bodhi heads,
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:57.900]  like a lot of times know all the different.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:04.580]  They said the mother to the strawberry milk
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:06.820]  was mother's milk crossed with Goji-Oji
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:10.740]  and the father is Baba Kush crossed with sour diesel IVL.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:16.380]  So strawberry milk is Nepali Oji crossed instant karma.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:17.220]  I think that's.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.580]  Sounds gnarly.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:30.470]  So this will just do five minutes, right?
[01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:35.380]  So rapid fire round.
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:38.860]  Yeah, there's three minutes and 10 seconds left on the clock.
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:48.640]  And then Josh, did Vision Creator say,
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.960]  cause he's watching, right?
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.080]  He's been in chat.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.040]  He's been in chat.
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:02.520]  So when he said, how about Roberts Creek Congo?
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.800]  Was that like, I will put that up?
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.920]  S1, he made an S1 of it.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.240]  That's cool.
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.760]  Yeah, that's what he's saying.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:19.460]  And how does he feel about coming on Zoom
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:20.940]  and out of the chat?
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:28.370]  I'm also getting messages from Josh and Kelly.
[01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:31.770]  I'm not sure if they're down to come on right now.
[01:52:31.770 --> 01:52:34.890]  They wanna donate for sure and support.
[01:52:34.890 --> 01:52:44.540]  And I don't have direct contact.
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:48.860]  All right, let's see if he pops back up in the.
[01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:55.850]  You said Josh and Kelly link?
[01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:57.650]  Yeah.
[01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:00.530]  Yeah, send them a link.
[01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:02.250]  I'm not sure if they're gonna be able to pop on,
[01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:05.050]  but they wanna auction seeds and stuff.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:12.180]  So Benjamin said, with Bodhi's gear,
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:15.620]  you never get the same old hype bottleneck genetics.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:18.140]  You're always finding unique stuff in his gear.
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:22.220]  I've heard many breeders say
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:24.580]  they find killer males in Bodhi's gear.
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.580]  Do you guys agree with that?
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.700]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.740]  I mean, yeah.
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:36.820]  He does different stuff.
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:38.740]  He does a ton of different things.
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:43.540]  And so he has some things that would be in the realm
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.260]  of what everybody's got.
[01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:48.660]  And then he has some things that are way, way out.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.820]  Like that last one, the Vietnamese cashmere cross.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:56.820]  You're not gonna get that from anybody else.
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.860]  Those are his lines that he's kind of pushed
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.020]  in their own directions.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.780]  And then he put them together.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:07.460]  So yeah, I mean, some of his stuff
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.220]  is like super, super unique.
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:10.620]  Like you couldn't, there's no way
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.300]  to get anything like it at all.
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:18.340]  Luis Fernando Esquinza said,
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:20.140]  can you please say thanks to Jackson
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:23.460]  for the moon harvest video on YouTube?
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.420]  This harvest, it was like all my girls
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.740]  were waiting for that day.
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:29.220]  Greetings from Chiapas, Mexico.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:31.860]  Nice.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:35.420]  What's the moon harvest?
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.060]  It was just a trippy thing.
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.220]  It was funny.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:42.940]  I made fun of myself for it being some woo woo,
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:47.940]  hippie bullshit, which I always like some good
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:52.220]  pseudoscience superstition bullshit that makes sense.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.300]  It was a trippy thing.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:01.300]  I have some different like native survival books
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.100]  and in one of them, they talk about a thing to do
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:14.260]  to check out how wood behaves with like the sugars
[01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.060]  and the saps and everything in it.
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.940]  Basically that on the full moon, everything is more full.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:22.940]  I mean, it's funny.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:24.740]  People don't think the moon affects that much,
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:27.340]  but you can look at the tides and how everything is.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.460]  The moon has a, when the moon's full for whatever reason,
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.580]  I don't know about the science of it, it tends to draw.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:39.700]  If you have a toothache, it'll get worse by the full moon.
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:43.900]  If you have something that, like inflammation,
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:45.980]  like you can feel it if you pay attention
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:49.860]  or if you have a spring that's a big spring in the ground,
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:50.740]  when the moon gets full,
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.660]  you'll have more water coming out of your spring
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:54.780]  and you can study that and you can go check
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:57.180]  and you can look and be like, yeah, okay.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:56:01.060]  It does have a, it has a drawing effect
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:02.380]  where it's pulling up.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:07.820]  And so I had just said on one thing that if I can,
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:18.420]  if it's a matter of like things are where I want them,
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:21.500]  if they're where I want them when the moon is full,
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.540]  then I feel better about it
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:28.980]  because I know everything's drawn into it.
[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.980]  And the native thing was that they would cut wood
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:39.060]  and they would bury it halfway in the ground
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:44.060]  and the wood cut on the full moons would outlast the wood
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.980]  that was cut on the new moon
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.660]  because it was just more durable.
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:52.940]  And so, like I said, it's pseudoscience.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.820]  I don't really know, cause I've never studied it.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.740]  I don't have the data to really say this works,
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.500]  but just based on that.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.140]  Like a sap brick test, like a, on a-
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:03.460]  Yeah, I mean, you could test it.
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.620]  You could see what it is,
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:07.420]  but it was just a thing of going, okay,
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.580]  things are more durable.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:10.940]  So I'm like, okay, well, if wood lasts longer
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.860]  and weed is a plant and it's kind of,
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.300]  if that gives it durability,
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:19.300]  you want your weed to have durability and shelf life too.
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:24.300]  And so, and also people who grow,
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.620]  have grown weed for a long time,
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.460]  you'll always hear them like,
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.540]  I was gonna take them, but this full moon's coming.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:31.380]  And I know it's gonna bring out a lot more.
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:33.180]  They're gonna really do their thing.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.660]  They're really gonna swell up.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:39.180]  And it all sounds like a bunch of bullshit if you don't,
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:42.500]  there's no way to prove any of it,
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:46.260]  but it's just something that I've tried to do
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:48.500]  over the years and not,
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:49.780]  I always make sure to tell people like,
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:53.460]  yeah, I don't have any data to back this up,
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:57.860]  but it makes sense to me in that context,
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:58.940]  and it's something you can do,
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.580]  go just go cut wood from the same tree
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.980]  and bury it through the winter
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:07.740]  and see how many winters that wood lasts.
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.660]  And according to that,
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:12.820]  they said that it was just a consistent thing.
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:15.900]  Like if you're gonna make bows, arrows,
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.780]  wood tools, different things like that,
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:19.420]  you wanna cut them on the full moon
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:21.060]  because then you'll have durable wood
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:25.660]  and otherwise it won't be as durable in the element.
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:27.060]  So, I don't know.
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:31.260]  That was just the full moon in general has always been,
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:32.860]  old hippies always told me like,
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:33.980]  oh no, that moon's gonna come.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:34.820]  And you kind of watch,
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:37.260]  you're like, they did kind of seem done.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.660]  And then the moon comes and they really start going.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.420]  Some people say it's because there's more light.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.980]  So it's a light cycle, whatever it is.
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:48.980]  I just do know that back in the day I had a cracked tooth
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.300]  and it was like, it would get sensitive.
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:54.220]  And then I'd go, oh no, there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.300]  And it'll get sensitive.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.940]  And then, oh no, there's nothing wrong with it.
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:58.420]  And then, you look and you go,
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:00.260]  oh, it's the full moon is when your tooth hurts.
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.620]  That's when there's more pressure and everything.
[01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.260]  Everything is going like this.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:08.340]  And then, so I always like myself to crack seeds
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:11.420]  like before the full moon and like the second quarter,
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:13.700]  have them so that they're being brought out.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:17.700]  And then the moon gets full and then the moon starts waning.
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:20.300]  And then that's more of when stuff draws down.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.140]  And so it's like, boom, bring it out.
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:24.020]  And then bam, get that root into the dirt.
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:25.660]  And that's just, like I said, it's a theory.
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.140]  I've never tested it.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:32.180]  I'm not gonna tell people that it's the gospel.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:35.460]  But yeah, it makes sense to me.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.780]  I just do it like that.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.820]  And, but I mean, some people will tell you,
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.260]  oh, the clones will strike better
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.140]  if you do them on the full moon
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:45.180]  because then everything's in it.
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:47.820]  So it has more, it's a richer cutting
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:51.700]  and then it has more energy to put down after the full moon.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.500]  And then, but then, you know, you talk to somebody
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.420]  and they're like, no, dude,
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.940]  we take a million clones all the time
[01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:58.780]  and it's all the same, you know?
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:02.220]  So I don't know, but it's just, you know, like I said,
[02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:05.140]  for me, I use the moon because it puts a fire under my ass
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:07.180]  to be like, dude, second quarter,
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.300]  if you don't plant today,
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:10.340]  you're gonna have to wait until this next time.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.180]  And then it just helps to keep me, you know,
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.380]  in that kind of a flow.
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:16.940]  So I don't try to say that I have, you know,
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:18.180]  that it really does anything,
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.860]  but it's good if you just can pick something.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.100]  Even if you were like, dude, I plant on the fifth,
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.900]  it's gotta be the fifth, then, you know,
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.980]  that would be helpful too, so that you don't just go,
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:30.300]  oh, well now it's the 13th and now it's the 19th.
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:31.820]  I'll get it together.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.020]  Like, no, it's always this.
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:36.180]  So that's why I use the moon the most,
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.260]  but you know, you do stuff by the moon too.
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:41.900]  Paying attention and it's intention and-
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:42.980]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:45.900]  So just quickly, we,
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:52.780]  who is the guy who won the Amrita?
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:59.660]  That, Andre?
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.060]  Yep.
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:02.260]  Do you see a payment?
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:03.100]  Yep.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:03.940]  For how much?
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:05.220]  300.
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:06.180]  300?
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:07.740]  Yep.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:12.740]  Okay, and then who won the previous one?
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:14.140]  Whoops.
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:14.980]  Whoops.
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.820]  The Pleidian Love Nest.
[02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:24.380]  I've got a 751 from Adam.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:26.620]  Yeah, that was a while back and then-
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:27.660]  Yeah.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.500]  So I haven't seen another one.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:31.660]  Never down won the one before the-
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.700]  Oh, wait a minute, maybe I got something.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:40.780]  Sorry, who'd you say won the one right before this one?
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:41.620]  Never the one.
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:42.860]  Never the one.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.700]  Oh, right, how do you spell that?
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:45.980]  Netbird?
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:49.060]  N-E-B-E-R, N-E-T-B-E-R,
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:53.140]  space down, D-O-W-N-S.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:57.740]  Okay, and so I don't know if Netbird,
[02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:58.740]  or actually some of these people,
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:00.780]  I don't know if they paid yet,
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.780]  but if you haven't paid, please pay.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:09.980]  Let's go, do we want to take a Josh break?
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:13.100]  Well, let's get the next one up before we do.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.060]  Okay, and then go to Josh?
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:16.580]  Yeah, hey Josh, hey Kelly.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:19.660]  Can you guys stay up a little bit longer?
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.260]  Well, just get it rolling and then let's get to it.
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:24.300]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.740]  All right, cool.
[02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:26.700]  In the flow.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:29.740]  We're just beginning our evening, we're up all night.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:31.580]  Nice, all right.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:36.140]  So now we're on Bodie, Boisenberry,
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:39.420]  Jackson, you want to be our translator?
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:44.620]  Um, let me see.
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:52.140]  Let me check real quick, I might be able to pull up,
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:55.420]  I think I might have a little info on this.
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:03:00.420]  I mean, you can see there, there is that info, but.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:04.900]  Speaking of the full moon,
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:07.100]  it's on the 1st of October this year.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.820]  So that's like, I don't know,
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:11.060]  it's pretty nice harvest time for all those early flowers.
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:15.060]  It's like, yeah, I think all those early flowers
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:17.100]  are going to be very beautiful this year.
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:22.940]  Okay, so what he told me was that
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:25.580]  the Boisenberry Gojis, Purple Goji F3
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.180]  had a super limited release.
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:29.300]  So I don't know what that means,
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:33.260]  but for him that probably means like, you know,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:36.260]  in the double digits,
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:39.540]  I don't think he probably put out a lot of those.
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:42.900]  I'm thinking maybe 10 or 20 packs if he says super limited,
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.820]  because Bodie does a lot of little releases.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:49.820]  So I don't know, that's his, to quote him, it says,
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:54.220]  here's more info, Boisenberry Gojis, the Purple Goji F3
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:56.020]  that had a super limited release.
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:57.620]  That's all I have on that.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.980]  That's what he told me when he put one up for,
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:08.100]  Duke, so.
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.520]  What did Netber win at?
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.180]  The first Bodie pack?
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.060]  Anyone remember?
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:34.180]  Let's pop in and say hi to Josh and Kelly.
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:38.440]  Hey guys.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:41.440]  How are you all doing tonight?
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.480]  Thanks for doing this, we appreciate it.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:47.240]  You guys know Keith?
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:51.320]  I'm not sure if we've met before.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.160]  Hi.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.320]  Hi Keith, how are you tonight?
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.720]  Good, good, good seeing you, Kate.
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:56.560]  Right on.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.240]  Nice seeing you.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:00.360]  Yay, hey, thanks guys so much.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.960]  I'm really stoked that you guys put this together.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:06.400]  It's so necessary to show support.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:09.160]  I'm just really thankful to you.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:11.720]  So any way that we can help out.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:13.520]  Sorry, we couldn't make it for Brett last night,
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:15.560]  but it's good it's happening, you know.
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:17.800]  Yeah, I'm stoked you guys are doing this tonight.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.000]  Netber won with 400.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.360]  400, all right.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:25.200]  Keith gave some amazing history
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.840]  on the whole Food Not Bombs.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  Just timeline and history and the community grown
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.240]  and all dead shows.
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:38.040]  And then a thousand different places all over the world,
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.280]  you know, continuing on the mission.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:41.760]  Yay.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.840]  Rainbow gatherings, we've had a lot of that.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.880]  We've had a lot of rainbow gatherings
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:49.360]  and hung out with Diamond Dave
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:52.080]  and Kid City and all that.
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.320]  Awesome.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.880]  Good one, any country fair times?
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.360]  Yeah, country fair, yeah.
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.960]  And then, and we've been like,
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:08.920]  like in Yangon, we're like kicking up
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:11.120]  a huge storm over there.
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:12.920]  Oh yeah, nice.
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:17.160]  Indonesia, like we're in a hundred cities in Indonesia.
[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.440]  What's happening in Indonesia?
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.600]  Wow, they just like, they're mostly,
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.960]  they've been like organizing against,
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:27.160]  well, like it depends on what part of the country,
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:30.040]  but there's like trying to save orangutans
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:32.360]  and dealing with that and trying to stop
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:36.320]  like this whole harvesting and palm oil thing
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:40.240]  that's going up in Java and-
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.360]  Yeah, yeah, we know about that.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.720]  Yeah, so we've been,
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:49.720]  so that's one of the things there's been like these kind of
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:52.400]  another whole campaign to stop iron mining
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:57.400]  on a beach in Sumatra, oil exploration that's going on.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:00.160]  Palm oil, oh, oil, right.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.960]  Yeah, yeah, off the coast.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:06.920]  And then there's also, oh, there's a very strong,
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:11.240]  there's a thing called, what is it called?
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.080]  I forget the name of it,
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.760]  but it's like, is it Plan Indonesia or something?
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:18.160]  And it was by this company in Boston.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.280]  And they're trying to build like a highway
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:25.720]  to connect Sumatra to Java, longest bridge.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:30.720]  Wow, like over Krakatoa, that's what that would be.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.120]  They would be making a bridge over Krakatoa.
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.360]  Yeah.
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:36.200]  That's funny.
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.360]  We did some work in Indonesia, a lot of it,
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.320]  and did a lot of work with Sumatran Orangutan Society
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:45.240]  and Lucy Wisdom from a long time ago.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:49.440]  She had a orangutan sanctuary in Northern Sumatra.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.920]  And we also worked with Friends of the Earth in Indonesia
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:57.480]  and the E-DEP, which is Indonesian Department
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.800]  of Education and Permaculture.
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:01.120]  And they did a lot of work.
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:03.360]  And so we did a lot of disaster relief
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:05.840]  and first responder stuff in that area.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:10.840]  And WALHI, W-A-L-H-I, WALHI, that's another Friends,
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:13.240]  like an earth foundation.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.880]  Do you work with any of those groups, Keith?
[02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:18.320]  I don't think that our local chapters
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:21.240]  necessarily do directly, I'm not sure, but.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:24.120]  That's cool.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:27.040]  So tell us what you're doing over there.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:30.160]  Well, what we do everywhere is,
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.800]  in there we've been collecting food that can't be sold
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:38.320]  or getting donations from the traditional markets.
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.400]  And our whole connection has been
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.280]  with the traditional markets.
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:45.440]  And also there's a lot of organizing with them
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:48.000]  to defend them against this whole new policy
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.880]  of making everything McDonald's and Burger King and stuff.
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:55.240]  So we take that food and then we share it on the streets,
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.240]  usually in town squares.
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:00.600]  That's awesome.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:01.760]  That's a lot of it.
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:04.160]  And then we've also been taking that food,
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:07.520]  not only to just feed people that are desperate for food,
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:09.680]  but also to protest.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:12.160]  And sometimes there's a couple of really interesting,
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.520]  one, there was a cement factory that was massive,
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.880]  that was destroying some beautiful area.
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:25.920]  And they decided that they would combine
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:28.240]  defending the traditional market.
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.480]  So what they had was each of the traditional meals,
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:35.080]  they would give you the recipe on a piece of paper
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.480]  and that was part of what they were handing out.
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.320]  So you'd learn that,
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:40.840]  but then they'd also have information
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.840]  on upcoming protests against the cement factory.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.040]  And every plate had that.
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.640]  Now, during the pandemic,
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.840]  I have to say I haven't connected much
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:53.680]  with everybody over there.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.960]  A lot more with the Philippines right now.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.560]  And that's because they just came out
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.000]  with that terrorism act,
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.240]  which could potentially make Food Not Bombs
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:11.240]  a terrorist group in the Philippines.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.920]  So they have been organizing around that.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:18.160]  And so I've been talking a lot to them
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:21.360]  and also to the Beirut chapter
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.400]  has been corresponding with us quite a bit
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:24.840]  ever since the explosion.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:29.120]  Yeah, because that took out their whole port
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:31.800]  and everything which feeds their country.
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:34.240]  Yeah, well, thanks so much, Keith.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:36.080]  That's super important work.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.960]  No, thank you.
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:40.800]  We're silently running the auction in the background.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:41.920]  We're on the next item.
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:46.920]  DJ Blueberry, Mom, Apollo 11, Genius, Fino.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.280]  Jackson, do you wanna?
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:53.600]  Yeah, this one I don't really know.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.560]  I saw someone commented,
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.440]  they said that this one was really limited
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:03.440]  because DJ didn't want the blueberry being bred with
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.560]  because he was doing his own work with it.
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:09.840]  And that could have even been just Bodhi just going,
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:12.000]  oh, DJ is doing stuff with it again, cool.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.720]  I'll stop making it.
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.440]  And then the same story, I guess,
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  with the Apollo 11 was Mr. Soul,
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.200]  Brothers Grimm was back in business again.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:29.160]  And so he just stopped doing stuff with it.
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:30.880]  So probably Bodhi put a few of these out
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.520]  and then went, oh no, I'm not gonna do that
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.520]  because those guys are doing their own stuff.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.480]  And then you can see too, it was a freebie.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:42.480]  So that means it was limited in a way too.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:46.640]  I love how when you say you don't know much
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.360]  about something, you give out all this background information.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.960]  Well, like I said, it was somebody's comment on there.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.960]  I read about, I read on there.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:00.360]  So I'm just playing telephone at all.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:01.520]  You're well-researched.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.120]  YouTube comments.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:09.760]  In the moment too.
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.200]  Has it got started off yet or?
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.840]  This meme game is strong.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:19.640]  Yeah, we're at 290 right now.
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:21.680]  Lone Stoner.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:28.720]  Dave Zeno is known there at 300.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:30.160]  Dave's not here.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.160]  Read it as one word.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:33.680]  There we go.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.080]  That makes much more sense.
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:42.300]  So what's going on in the Dragonfly Farm?
[02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:47.310]  What's happening up here?
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:48.150]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:51.310]  A lot of really good things.
[02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:56.310]  We had the cold spring
[02:12:57.350 --> 02:13:01.270]  and the really beautiful summer.
[02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:05.670]  So in this area, we won't have a lot of light
[02:13:05.670 --> 02:13:07.230]  this really beautiful year.
[02:13:07.230 --> 02:13:09.150]  So all the food and everything
[02:13:09.150 --> 02:13:11.670]  is just really growing at full potential.
[02:13:11.670 --> 02:13:16.670]  And it's just, we don't always have a sunny summer up here.
[02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:21.830]  So it's really amazing to see what a full sun summer
[02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:23.350]  can do for plants.
[02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:25.350]  And so a lot of things.
[02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:27.950]  Right now we have a bear up in the tree
[02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:29.590]  hassling our chickens.
[02:13:29.590 --> 02:13:33.470]  And it really, it opened up the car doors the other night.
[02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:35.870]  It's kind of like all up in our business.
[02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:37.550]  Now, have you guys crossed paths
[02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:39.230]  with Breeder Steve in the pool?
[02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:42.110]  We haven't, no.
[02:13:42.110 --> 02:13:43.430]  No, we haven't.
[02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:44.350]  We missed that.
[02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:47.910]  That's awesome though.
[02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:50.470]  I like the pool, but yeah.
[02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:51.710]  No, but things are good.
[02:13:51.710 --> 02:13:52.550]  Things are really good.
[02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:53.390]  We're really thankful this year.
[02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:55.310]  We've been doing a lot of building as well
[02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:58.390]  and creating some really beautiful,
[02:13:58.390 --> 02:14:00.710]  feels like timeless, you know,
[02:14:00.710 --> 02:14:02.550]  timber frame structures and stuff.
[02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:05.550]  So been getting into that.
[02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:09.230]  And breeding, doing lots of breeding, lots of growing.
[02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:11.830]  Definitely really loving the lion claw.
[02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:13.670]  The otter.
[02:14:13.670 --> 02:14:16.830]  The otter, yeah, those are just phenomenal up here.
[02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:18.150]  And they're going off everywhere.
[02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:20.550]  We put up 2000 seeds earlier.
[02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:21.390]  Really?
[02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:22.670]  For the auction, yeah.
[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:23.790]  That's beautiful.
[02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:24.790]  Those are valuable.
[02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:27.310]  The pictures of the ones that Brandon and Amanda
[02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:29.630]  were harvesting, they looked insane.
[02:14:29.630 --> 02:14:31.310]  Yeah, nice.
[02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:32.710]  And then I heard like in co-blow,
[02:14:32.710 --> 02:14:34.710]  they can get up to a pound.
[02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:35.710]  Oh, really?
[02:14:35.710 --> 02:14:36.550]  Yeah.
[02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:39.950]  Everything gets big in co-blow.
[02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:40.790]  Right?
[02:14:42.670 --> 02:14:46.590]  Um, what do you guys have up tonight?
[02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:51.190]  Well, we have some Zellies gift seeds
[02:14:51.190 --> 02:14:55.190]  that we could give away and some healer seeds
[02:14:55.190 --> 02:14:57.910]  or to put up for the auction.
[02:14:57.910 --> 02:15:01.310]  Is it a Zellies gift cross or just straight?
[02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:03.270]  It's a straight one.
[02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:06.190]  We definitely are making some really good crosses
[02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:09.230]  with it this year, which we're really excited about.
[02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:10.750]  And, um,
[02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:14.230]  I have some Black Dog to give you from the,
[02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:17.430]  the one you'd given me a while back.
[02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:18.270]  Nice.
[02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:22.950]  We have a really good Voltron, um, velvet perps.
[02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:24.110]  Oh, oh my God.
[02:15:24.110 --> 02:15:24.950]  Yeah.
[02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:26.670]  Like I have, um,
[02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:29.150]  actually I have the banana dog velvet perps
[02:15:29.150 --> 02:15:30.670]  and it's so gorgeous.
[02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:31.510]  Yeah.
[02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:32.350]  Nice.
[02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:34.190]  The velvet perps that Sunroots put on there,
[02:15:34.190 --> 02:15:36.150]  it's just, they're so pretty.
[02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:37.950]  The males are just insane too.
[02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:40.190]  Just insane purple antlers.
[02:15:40.190 --> 02:15:42.550]  It's just, they look, they look nice.
[02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:44.590]  Dark, dark stalks.
[02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:46.470]  Are you getting those purple stalks and-
[02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:47.430]  We did.
[02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:49.510]  We did get, we did get some,
[02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:52.830]  but we didn't end up with like the full purple plant,
[02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:55.870]  um, you know, as far as what turned female and everything.
[02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:58.070]  So, um,
[02:15:58.070 --> 02:16:01.390]  we started a lot of our seeds
[02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:03.670]  just in the greenhouse this year.
[02:16:03.670 --> 02:16:07.830]  So if we wanted to keep any males from that, you know,
[02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:12.110]  we dug a few of them up to put them in pots
[02:16:12.110 --> 02:16:13.310]  and to keep them out and stuff.
[02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:15.310]  And I definitely wouldn't say that's like
[02:16:15.310 --> 02:16:17.190]  the recommended way to do it and everything,
[02:16:17.190 --> 02:16:19.470]  but it worked out good for us on a few of the males
[02:16:19.470 --> 02:16:22.230]  that kind of turned out like really good.
[02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:26.830]  And that was better than like cutting the top off of it
[02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:28.070]  and stuff, you know.
[02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.230]  But one of the strains that we really loved,
[02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:34.590]  we did a lot of glazed cherry.
[02:16:34.590 --> 02:16:35.430]  Oh, cool.
[02:16:35.430 --> 02:16:36.990]  F5 from Green Source?
[02:16:36.990 --> 02:16:39.350]  Yeah, that was last year.
[02:16:39.350 --> 02:16:41.830]  And we came out with some really,
[02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:43.870]  some of our favorite crosses this year
[02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:46.830]  are those out of our strains.
[02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:51.830]  And so the glazed ghost is one that really kind of
[02:16:52.350 --> 02:16:54.190]  is standing out this year.
[02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:56.110]  And it's the ghost,
[02:16:56.110 --> 02:17:01.110]  we got a ghost OG Mendo dog from the Gage Green crew
[02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:04.510]  like seven or eight years ago
[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:09.470]  and grew that and just kind of have been keeping it around
[02:17:09.470 --> 02:17:10.670]  over the years and stuff.
[02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:13.710]  Also a really nice Grateful Breath cherry puff
[02:17:13.710 --> 02:17:17.710]  that was been making its way through our stuff.
[02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:20.470]  But the glazed ghost is the combination
[02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:23.550]  of the white lotus glazed cherries.
[02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:24.390]  Oh, cool.
[02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:25.350]  In the temple.
[02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:26.190]  Yeah.
[02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:29.190]  The white lotus glazed cherries by the,
[02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:31.110]  well, Kelly's in the background.
[02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:34.270]  The ghost, there's a ghost temple,
[02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:38.070]  which is the ghost OG by the Temple Spice.
[02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:43.070]  And the Temple Spice is the 840,
[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:46.710]  the Mothership 840, which is our,
[02:17:46.710 --> 02:17:48.270]  the one that we've had the longest,
[02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:51.470]  which is the Afgoo clone from Eugene.
[02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:55.030]  But that's an older, really old one.
[02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:58.030]  That's kind of like that classic like kind bud flavor
[02:17:58.030 --> 02:18:00.230]  and stuff from the nineties and everything.
[02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:02.870]  And super crystally.
[02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:05.470]  And has that purple tie in there
[02:18:05.470 --> 02:18:09.510]  from what I've been told through the family and Eugene,
[02:18:09.510 --> 02:18:11.030]  but this is a long time ago.
[02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:16.030]  And then, so the 840 is the Afgoo by purple tie
[02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:19.750]  by super lemon haze Hawaiian god bud.
[02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:23.030]  Yeah.
[02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.870]  I love it.
[02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:27.590]  So the Temple Spice would be the 840, yeah,
[02:18:27.590 --> 02:18:31.870]  by the Zellie's Gift, I think is what it is.
[02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:35.550]  Anyway, we could offer the Glazed Ghost,
[02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:38.070]  the Healer and the Zellie's Gift if that sounds good.
[02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:41.670]  We could also offer a bucket of fat flowers
[02:18:41.670 --> 02:18:45.830]  and some Myco Canna Caps if that seemed like a good thing
[02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:47.390]  and we would be super stoked to do that.
[02:18:47.390 --> 02:18:48.230]  Yeah.
[02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:51.350]  However that works.
[02:18:51.350 --> 02:18:53.030]  I don't even know how to do it.
[02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:54.630]  Why don't we pick a couple of things
[02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:56.150]  and I'll create graphics for them
[02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:58.110]  while we're finishing off with Bodhi.
[02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.990]  Yeah.
[02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:02.750]  So Josh, are you a master?
[02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:07.970]  What's, oh.
[02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:13.540]  Glazed Ghost.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:15.660]  Here's some Glazed Ghost.
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:16.500]  Wow.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:21.740]  So we do definitely a lot of light depping up here
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:25.420]  because we've had summers where we don't have
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:27.380]  more than two days of sunshine
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:31.580]  and it's just rainy all year and it's super cold.
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:35.140]  Right now it's kind of exceptionally warm everywhere,
[02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:38.620]  especially even here, but by September we can get,
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.460]  it's supposed to get down to six degrees Celsius here
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:44.940]  in the next few days.
[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:46.220]  I love seeing this flower right now.
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:47.420]  This is great.
[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:48.260]  You know what's cool?
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:49.500]  So the first time I met Nick,
[02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:53.060]  I was with Ryan, the Pummeled Seed Organization
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:56.020]  and we traded some seeds,
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:58.020]  well, we just gave a bunch of seeds and
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:03.180]  one of the ones was the Glazed Cherries then
[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:06.100]  and some Black Dog and Athena,
[02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:08.340]  but then they just, they kept breeding it every year
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:10.060]  and brought it to like F5.
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:13.060]  And I remember early on from you getting the 840
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:15.420]  and Temple Spice and like growing that out too.
[02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:17.980]  And it's neat to see all those things put together
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:18.820]  in that flower.
[02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:19.940]  Yeah, no doubt.
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:20.780]  Oh, you know what?
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:21.620]  My mind.
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:26.620]  Josh, just quickly, Jackson, can you give us a,
[02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:29.700]  this is what's currently up in the background.
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:32.660]  Do you see this?
[02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:36.700]  Yeah, I mean, I don't have a really good rundown on it.
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:41.700]  Calio is a orange thing.
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:50.180]  That clone is like the old real Calio cut as far as I know.
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:56.580]  And then I've heard the story of the Apollo 11
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:58.900]  I can't really remember.
[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:01.580]  I know that that was a Brothers Grimm thing.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:06.300]  I think that's what they used that to breed Cinderella,
[02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:08.300]  maybe Cindy 99.
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:14.580]  So, yeah, I don't know too much about it.
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:18.540]  I'm assuming though that if you put it in,
[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:21.540]  he probably didn't make many once again,
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:23.260]  probably because he started using,
[02:21:23.260 --> 02:21:25.220]  he probably started using that Apollo 11
[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:30.740]  and then stopped when Mr. Soul started selling seeds again.
[02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:33.180]  So it probably a really was like a quick run
[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:34.940]  and then he pulled it or something.
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:42.740]  So it's DH20.
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:45.100]  This is what's currently up.
[02:21:56.590 --> 02:22:03.850]  So it's Edrin, who's Edrin?
[02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:09.350]  Going through the chat.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:18.320]  So we have, wow, it's gonna go for potentially 200.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.760]  All right, so Josh, as we're finishing this one, carry on.
[02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:37.850]  My mind went blank on the Temple Spice,
[02:22:37.850 --> 02:22:41.770]  but the Temple Spice was the 840 by Royal Sour.
[02:22:41.770 --> 02:22:42.810]  I just, just to say,
[02:22:42.810 --> 02:22:47.810]  so the Royal Sour was the Royal Kush by Sour Diesel,
[02:22:48.490 --> 02:22:50.250]  of course, so.
[02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:53.730]  Yeah, so however you wanna do it
[02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:56.170]  with what we wanna give away.
[02:22:57.210 --> 02:23:00.610]  The Glazed Ghost is a new one this year.
[02:23:00.610 --> 02:23:02.490]  It's from last year, but we grew it this year
[02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:04.570]  and it was really amazing.
[02:23:04.570 --> 02:23:05.650]  So there's that.
[02:23:07.010 --> 02:23:08.890]  And we're making lots of crosses.
[02:23:08.890 --> 02:23:11.730]  There's some good outdoor genetics
[02:23:11.730 --> 02:23:14.970]  from up here in British Columbia too,
[02:23:14.970 --> 02:23:16.170]  which are really good.
[02:23:16.170 --> 02:23:18.930]  And the Foxy Fruity's one,
[02:23:18.930 --> 02:23:23.930]  and there's some strain from the Lillooet area,
[02:23:24.170 --> 02:23:25.650]  which is all purple.
[02:23:25.650 --> 02:23:27.970]  We're making some really good outdoor crosses
[02:23:27.970 --> 02:23:29.930]  that I don't have available right now,
[02:23:29.930 --> 02:23:32.730]  but there's some good,
[02:23:32.730 --> 02:23:35.130]  the outdoor strains up here finish really good
[02:23:35.130 --> 02:23:36.810]  and really like heavy weather.
[02:23:36.810 --> 02:23:40.290]  And they're all finishing right now
[02:23:41.690 --> 02:23:43.290]  under natural lighting, so.
[02:23:44.730 --> 02:23:46.130]  And they're not auto flower,
[02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:48.690]  so they're kind of like big plant.
[02:23:49.450 --> 02:23:51.650]  They can be big plants.
[02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:54.770]  So we're excited about that for what's coming.
[02:23:54.770 --> 02:23:58.410]  So we're on our last Bodhi pack.
[02:23:58.410 --> 02:24:01.740]  Jackson, take a look at this one.
[02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:04.540]  All right, so this one,
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:09.540]  I don't really know the Pure Kush Shug.
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:13.380]  That's not a Pure Kush like the one I have.
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:15.780]  That's like one that really looks like
[02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:18.660]  actually like a Pure Kush.
[02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:21.660]  A Hindu Kush type, like a little Afghani,
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:24.780]  like a Baba Kush kind of, but different.
[02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:27.020]  And I don't know, there's some controversy
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:29.780]  over whether or not people have the real one
[02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:31.580]  or if the one that's circulated
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:33.900]  is actually just some Baba,
[02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:39.780]  alternate kind of the Baba or something.
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:41.020]  It's different from the Baba,
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:42.660]  but it's really similar to what you're talking about.
[02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:45.420]  Like at least the one that I always like came across
[02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:47.140]  as that Shug Pure Kush.
[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:50.580]  Yeah, we have the other PK and then-
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.020]  Incredibly sweet, it had that full,
[02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:55.980]  it had some of that Kush gas and stuff,
[02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:57.820]  but it was a really, really sweet version of it.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:00.860]  It wasn't like the OG Pure Kush that-
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:02.340]  Yeah, yeah, it's more of a little,
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:05.180]  it's a little broadly short spot.
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:08.060]  It'd be like seven weeks and be done too in depth
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:11.060]  and full season too, but yeah, it was really-
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:13.620]  Yeah, when I first saw it,
[02:25:13.620 --> 02:25:15.700]  I thought that it was just like a mislabeled one.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:17.380]  I was like, that's not PK.
[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:18.940]  And then I found out there's a couple,
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.220]  there's like a few different plants that go as Pure Kush.
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:24.340]  I was really drawn to it.
[02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:26.020]  Like I love the effect, the smell,
[02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:28.820]  and I used it for crossing a bunch of stuff on.
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:35.020]  Yeah, so then with that old, what was it?
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:38.540]  88G13.
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:40.740]  Yeah, so then that's another,
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:45.740]  like an old school broadly stout little thing.
[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:47.700]  So that's probably a neat cross
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:50.220]  if someone wants some kind of a broadly little.
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:51.900]  I remember-
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:56.900]  We grew a cross of the 88G13 hash plant from Bodhi.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:00.620]  And shit, I forget what the,
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:03.260]  it wasn't a Pure Kush male, I remember that.
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:05.500]  Or if it was a female or male, I don't know.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:08.300]  But what it turned out to be
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:11.980]  was just a really super interesting flower
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:14.820]  that was, it definitely finished early.
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:17.540]  It was really a lot of brown and orange hairs
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:19.580]  through the whole flower cycle.
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:24.580]  And then really kind of fluffy flowers.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.020]  I don't know if that sounds like what,
[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:28.620]  if any of you guys have grown that,
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:31.980]  if that came out like that, but it was really interesting.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:35.780]  A really interesting terpene flavor.
[02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:43.310]  What terpenes were you getting?
[02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:48.150]  They were like light terpenes,
[02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:50.790]  a little bit on the kind of
[02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:57.950]  light, like piney lemony a little bit in those areas.
[02:26:58.870 --> 02:27:02.150]  Not very fruity, kind of hazy almost.
[02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:06.670]  A little bit in the kind of hazy category,
[02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:07.990]  I would say in flavor.
[02:27:08.390 --> 02:27:14.850]  Not very heavy though, in that sense.
[02:27:14.850 --> 02:27:17.850]  The Pure Kush might be a really good match for it,
[02:27:17.850 --> 02:27:18.690]  I would think.
[02:27:20.290 --> 02:27:26.690]  Is the 88 a date or a specific plant or?
[02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:28.010]  It's a date.
[02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:28.850]  I thought it was a date.
[02:27:28.850 --> 02:27:33.850]  Old stock, I guess, that got circulated a little bit.
[02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:39.450]  Yeah, I've never seen him in person.
[02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:41.370]  I just know, I don't know.
[02:27:41.530 --> 02:27:43.530]  I've never seen him in person, I just know,
[02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:45.970]  I've just seen people talk about him,
[02:27:45.970 --> 02:28:01.140]  but people are posting a little bit of info
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:02.340]  in the comments, it looks like,
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:04.060]  from different crosses of that.
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:04.900]  What do you got?
[02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:14.430]  The 88's a hash dumper.
[02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:19.030]  I remember, yeah, I mean that,
[02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:21.830]  well, I wasn't growing G13 until like,
[02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:27.910]  probably 2003 or something, but yeah.
[02:28:28.830 --> 02:28:30.230]  It was definitely hashy.
[02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:32.630]  Yeah, I mean, I-
[02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:34.670]  It was a G13 hash plant cross, I mean, so.
[02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:39.470]  Knowing Bodhi, like, he really likes this one,
[02:28:39.470 --> 02:28:41.710]  or he wouldn't have put it up for a charity,
[02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:43.430]  because that's what he does usually.
[02:28:43.430 --> 02:28:46.110]  He's like, ooh, this is this, these are the ones,
[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:48.790]  you know, like he doesn't ever put up stuff.
[02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:51.630]  Yeah, he tries to put up stuff that's really good,
[02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:55.990]  like I wouldn't, if I was looking for something from Bodhi,
[02:28:56.030 --> 02:29:00.230]  I'd be trying to get these ones that he puts up,
[02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:02.310]  because I'm sure he grew these and was like,
[02:29:02.310 --> 02:29:05.030]  these are dank and there's not many of them, you know.
[02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:08.590]  Sounds like a really good combination.
[02:29:10.750 --> 02:29:14.110]  There'd be a really like, true kind of fun hybrid,
[02:29:14.110 --> 02:29:16.110]  like, I think that would like,
[02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:19.550]  lock in really nice, that first generation.
[02:29:27.970 --> 02:29:30.450]  Jesse, we did get some really nice
[02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:35.330]  SFV banana dogs this year.
[02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:36.170]  Oh, cool. I know I'm forgetting one.
[02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:38.330]  Was that the double banana SFV dog,
[02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:40.930]  or was it one that they gave you this year?
[02:29:41.890 --> 02:29:43.690]  It was, it was from this year.
[02:29:43.690 --> 02:29:45.970]  Cool, yeah, I think that's the double banana SFV dog.
[02:29:45.970 --> 02:29:48.410]  Okay, nice, yeah.
[02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:50.570]  They're not like super early though for out there,
[02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:54.010]  but they should be pretty resistant as far as rot goes.
[02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:55.370]  Yeah, it's been a beautiful-
[02:29:55.690 --> 02:29:56.530]  It's been a beautiful-
[02:29:56.530 --> 02:29:57.410]  And they're dumpers for Hash,
[02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:59.530]  I mean, the Hash will just be insane.
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:01.730]  Nice, I'm looking forward to it.
[02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:03.130]  Where are they at right now?
[02:30:04.490 --> 02:30:06.130]  Well, they're just finishing,
[02:30:06.130 --> 02:30:07.730]  so we've got some downstairs.
[02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:09.450]  Oh, cool, oh, you got some, or they're-
[02:30:09.450 --> 02:30:11.290]  Yeah. Oh, cool.
[02:30:11.290 --> 02:30:12.410]  Yeah. Oh, cool.
[02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:16.490]  So, we got a freeze dryer and everything,
[02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:21.490]  so we're gonna be making some killer stuff coming up soon.
[02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:24.210]  How do the trichomes look?
[02:30:24.250 --> 02:30:26.090]  Really good, really good.
[02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:29.410]  Very covered, very thick, solid little,
[02:30:29.410 --> 02:30:33.370]  not little buds, but solid style buds, you know?
[02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:34.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:35.650 --> 02:30:38.970]  And a little bit of darkness.
[02:30:38.970 --> 02:30:40.930]  They divide, so you don't have those spots
[02:30:40.930 --> 02:30:42.570]  where you can get the rot.
[02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:43.690]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:30:43.690 --> 02:30:45.530]  And it's better for washing too,
[02:30:45.530 --> 02:30:47.210]  because you have more surface area.
[02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:50.810]  And the head consistency is very strong.
[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:52.010]  There's no greasing out.
[02:30:52.290 --> 02:30:53.970]  It actually has that sandy-
[02:30:53.970 --> 02:30:54.810]  Right.
[02:30:54.810 --> 02:30:55.650]  Join or something.
[02:30:55.650 --> 02:30:56.490]  It's that kind of stuff
[02:30:56.490 --> 02:30:59.610]  that will just dump all over the table.
[02:30:59.610 --> 02:31:02.090]  But yeah, they just break off
[02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:05.330]  and you'll get really good percent yields on that.
[02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:07.210]  That's sweet, that's sweet.
[02:31:08.610 --> 02:31:09.890]  Looking forward to it.
[02:31:11.050 --> 02:31:15.050]  So, just quickly, we just wrapped up with Bodhi,
[02:31:15.970 --> 02:31:18.010]  but I feel like I'm missing something.
[02:31:18.010 --> 02:31:22.730]  Unless I missed one, because I have six packs,
[02:31:24.290 --> 02:31:26.850]  but I see Netbers won the first one,
[02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:31.730]  Andre Foster the second, it's DH2O the third,
[02:31:31.730 --> 02:31:34.130]  it's DH2O the fourth, and then G-Unit.
[02:31:34.130 --> 02:31:35.690]  Or did I miss someone in there?
[02:31:41.770 --> 02:31:44.050]  Because that would only be five Bodhi packs,
[02:31:44.050 --> 02:31:47.810]  and I have six, so unless I skipped one.
[02:31:48.690 --> 02:31:51.130]  But while we're trying to figure that out,
[02:31:51.130 --> 02:31:52.970]  all right, so Josh and Kelly,
[02:31:55.170 --> 02:31:59.890]  give me a first item while you're talking about it,
[02:31:59.890 --> 02:32:01.090]  and I'll make a graphic.
[02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:07.490]  Did Dave's Not Here win one?
[02:32:07.490 --> 02:32:08.610]  Did you have that one?
[02:32:11.490 --> 02:32:13.290]  That makes sense that-
[02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:18.570]  Yeah, even Dave said Dave's Not Here, you missed Dave.
[02:32:18.610 --> 02:32:21.610]  Yeah, Dave, we didn't mean to leave you out.
[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:23.130]  Okay, so that was the sixth,
[02:32:23.130 --> 02:32:26.650]  and if Dave can also post which one he won,
[02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:30.410]  so I know where I missed him.
[02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:31.930]  But anyway, all right, Josh,
[02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:38.850]  launching Photoshop to make my world-class graphics.
[02:32:40.570 --> 02:32:43.250]  What are you gonna put up?
[02:32:48.010 --> 02:32:49.010]  Up, you're muted.
[02:32:51.450 --> 02:32:52.370]  Sorry about that.
[02:32:54.090 --> 02:32:59.090]  The Glazed Ghost, I think people will really enjoy.
[02:33:00.130 --> 02:33:04.170]  It's got nice red colors on it,
[02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:07.210]  and really beautiful red stalks and stuff.
[02:33:07.210 --> 02:33:09.010]  And how many seeds?
[02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:14.410]  You know, probably close to 20, 15 to 20.
[02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:18.650]  Call it, you have to say the amount.
[02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:20.090]  I would be very-
[02:33:21.210 --> 02:33:23.730]  How about 15 plus seeds?
[02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:27.330]  Let's do 15 heavy, let's do 15 heavy,
[02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:32.890]  and then we'll have a good amount of flower seeds
[02:33:32.890 --> 02:33:33.730]  coming for it.
[02:33:33.730 --> 02:33:36.890]  You know, I'll probably send like a bunch of also
[02:33:36.890 --> 02:33:39.770]  other flower seeds like zinnias and marigolds
[02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:44.770]  and companion flowers to go with that, poppies,
[02:33:45.210 --> 02:33:49.370]  different, you know, that'll be good.
[02:33:49.370 --> 02:33:50.210]  So-
[02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:52.850]  Can you break down the cross on that Glazed Ghost?
[02:33:52.850 --> 02:33:57.090]  Yes, the glaze, so it's a white lotus glazed cherries.
[02:33:58.290 --> 02:34:03.290]  And do you, Jackson, do you recognize the white lotus?
[02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:05.850]  Is the white lotus a Bodhi?
[02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:08.810]  I can't remember if that white lotus was a Bodhi cross
[02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:11.650]  with the glazed cherries, and if Nick was here,
[02:34:11.650 --> 02:34:14.730]  I feel like I've talked to them about this, but-
[02:34:15.570 --> 02:34:17.810]  It sounds like it to me just because he has the snow lotus.
[02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:20.370]  I almost think it's the white cross snow lotus,
[02:34:20.370 --> 02:34:21.890]  but I'm not sure about that.
[02:34:21.890 --> 02:34:23.930]  I just have that in the back of my head.
[02:34:25.770 --> 02:34:30.770]  Yeah, but I mean, I know Bodhi has some with lotus in there
[02:34:31.690 --> 02:34:33.370]  just because of that snow lotus.
[02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:38.370]  The snow lotus, I think, is that's like
[02:34:38.690 --> 02:34:40.770]  Afgu and Blockhead, I think.
[02:34:41.690 --> 02:34:43.090]  Oh, really?
[02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:44.090]  I'm pretty sure.
[02:34:45.730 --> 02:34:47.850]  And what was the Blockhead?
[02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:52.730]  Blockhead is something from Breeder Steve from Spice of Life,
[02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:55.970]  and I can't remember what it was.
[02:34:55.970 --> 02:34:59.930]  I think it's Sweet Tooth cross something else.
[02:35:00.770 --> 02:35:01.610]  Oh, okay.
[02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:04.490]  It was funky, man, just solid and sweet smelling.
[02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:10.130]  That's awesome.
[02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:10.970]  Orange.
[02:35:11.970 --> 02:35:14.130]  Well, I just know that we've had,
[02:35:14.130 --> 02:35:17.410]  the one we've had was a white lotus glazed cherries,
[02:35:17.410 --> 02:35:18.890]  and that's the one we've been growing
[02:35:18.890 --> 02:35:22.250]  over the last three years on the property.
[02:35:22.250 --> 02:35:23.610]  It does really well here,
[02:35:23.610 --> 02:35:28.610]  and it just has this deep, rich cherry flavor,
[02:35:29.290 --> 02:35:32.530]  and it's just super special for us.
[02:35:32.530 --> 02:35:37.530]  And then going with everything that went onto the ghost,
[02:35:38.090 --> 02:35:42.770]  OG Mendo Dog, turned out just super flavorful.
[02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:46.450]  And it's got a really kind of nice,
[02:35:47.610 --> 02:35:52.610]  kind of gassy, kind of fuel-ish tone to it as well.
[02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:55.970]  So it's got that kind of,
[02:35:55.970 --> 02:35:57.210]  I think a little bit of everything.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:35:58.850]  I like the dark color.
[02:35:58.850 --> 02:36:03.850]  Medium stature, really strong, can be really fat stalks.
[02:36:04.250 --> 02:36:06.210]  We didn't trellis it ever.
[02:36:06.250 --> 02:36:09.090]  It was totally able to grow without trellises too,
[02:36:09.090 --> 02:36:12.690]  which was, maybe if it turns into a 10 pound
[02:36:12.690 --> 02:36:14.930]  or a 15 pound plant, that's different.
[02:36:16.730 --> 02:36:18.050]  So that's the breakdown on that one.
[02:36:18.050 --> 02:36:19.810]  And the white lotus glazed cherries,
[02:36:19.810 --> 02:36:22.170]  but yeah, ghost, OG Mendo Dog.
[02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:24.410]  Stay Fly has done a bunch of crosses
[02:36:24.410 --> 02:36:25.810]  with the white lotus, right?
[02:36:26.730 --> 02:36:27.570]  Who's that?
[02:36:27.570 --> 02:36:28.410]  Stay Fly?
[02:36:29.690 --> 02:36:31.050]  I'm not sure.
[02:36:31.050 --> 02:36:32.450]  They might have.
[02:36:32.450 --> 02:36:34.130]  They did a black lotus with the white lotus,
[02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:34.970]  like just black lotus.
[02:36:35.410 --> 02:36:40.410]  The moon gazer grew out and yeah, it's really beautiful.
[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:43.610]  By the way, have we started this?
[02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:45.610]  Is the clock ticking?
[02:36:45.610 --> 02:36:46.770]  Any bids yet or?
[02:36:46.770 --> 02:36:50.410]  Yeah, we're at 225 with just over two minutes left to go.
[02:36:53.490 --> 02:36:55.250]  And you could put flower seeds on there
[02:36:55.250 --> 02:36:58.890]  if you wanted to on your graphic, but it's up to you.
[02:36:58.890 --> 02:37:01.810]  So basically 50 plus flower seeds.
[02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:03.650]  That's what I'm saying, yeah.
[02:37:03.690 --> 02:37:05.210]  From your flower seeds.
[02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:07.010]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:37:07.010 --> 02:37:10.170]  From our farm, from our farm to yours.
[02:37:10.170 --> 02:37:12.010]  We did that with a bunch of seeds last year
[02:37:12.010 --> 02:37:14.130]  and it's been a lot of fun seeing, you know,
[02:37:14.130 --> 02:37:17.250]  some of the pictures and stuff of it and stuff.
[02:37:17.250 --> 02:37:19.810]  I love having like the garden in the backyard
[02:37:19.810 --> 02:37:22.770]  with like plants and seeds from all of the friends
[02:37:22.770 --> 02:37:24.970]  and farms and just like seeing them come out
[02:37:24.970 --> 02:37:25.810]  and do their things.
[02:37:25.810 --> 02:37:28.130]  Like there's stuff from you guys that just come up
[02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:30.570]  every year for the last like several years.
[02:37:30.570 --> 02:37:33.170]  And it's like kind of having you in the backyard.
[02:37:34.170 --> 02:37:39.170]  It's a nice intimate connection that you get to continue,
[02:37:39.250 --> 02:37:41.650]  continuous connection that you get to have.
[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:44.450]  And I like that spiritual kind of connection as well
[02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:46.610]  in there, which is really nice.
[02:37:47.770 --> 02:37:52.770]  So I have to admit it's been really awesome
[02:37:52.850 --> 02:37:56.890]  just being on the farm every single day,
[02:37:56.890 --> 02:37:58.930]  just taking care of business,
[02:37:58.930 --> 02:38:00.650]  doing everything that needs to be done.
[02:38:00.690 --> 02:38:04.170]  I mean, we have been doing,
[02:38:04.170 --> 02:38:06.210]  there's been a lot of travel, you know,
[02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.050]  and as great as that is.
[02:38:08.050 --> 02:38:10.130]  I was gonna say, you guys are usually
[02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:11.490]  on the road all the time.
[02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:16.210]  And we always have that route here and everything,
[02:38:16.210 --> 02:38:20.370]  but it's just nice to be here in that space
[02:38:20.370 --> 02:38:22.130]  because it's our true love and passion.
[02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:25.650]  And yeah, I think a lot of people feel that way this year.
[02:38:26.810 --> 02:38:28.730]  You're the gardener.
[02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:30.250]  And the plants like,
[02:38:30.250 --> 02:38:33.970]  and then to put like an epic year on top of it
[02:38:33.970 --> 02:38:37.010]  is sort of, it's beautiful.
[02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:39.090]  We're saving more seeds than ever.
[02:38:39.090 --> 02:38:42.650]  So not just cannabis, you know, all of our food seeds,
[02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:45.490]  we've been very focused on letting those go.
[02:38:45.490 --> 02:38:48.170]  And it's funny, because you kind of see gardens
[02:38:48.170 --> 02:38:49.890]  and you're like, you're used to seeing gardens
[02:38:49.890 --> 02:38:53.490]  that are super tidy and sweet and like in this flowering.
[02:38:53.490 --> 02:38:54.330]  I mean, not flowering,
[02:38:54.330 --> 02:38:56.210]  but in the fruiting stage of whatever it's growing,
[02:38:56.250 --> 02:38:59.330]  but like letting your plants grow into seed
[02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:01.770]  and all your lettuce plants grow into seed,
[02:39:01.770 --> 02:39:05.370]  it turns into like a bigger garden.
[02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:08.570]  Actually, Cass, just before we close it,
[02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:13.570]  because Claude asked if you in Canada can ship to Canada.
[02:39:13.610 --> 02:39:16.370]  They indeed can ship to Canada.
[02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:17.970]  So if you want to put a-
[02:39:17.970 --> 02:39:19.810]  Are they in Canada?
[02:39:19.810 --> 02:39:23.890]  Claude Lemieux, if you want to put in a bid.
[02:39:24.770 --> 02:39:26.490]  Yeah, we're in Canada right now.
[02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:27.410]  Yeah, of course.
[02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:31.530]  Otherwise you even Grow Bro is the winner, right?
[02:39:31.530 --> 02:39:33.690]  But if Claude wants from,
[02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:35.570]  Claude, where in Canada are you from?
[02:39:36.450 --> 02:39:39.090]  Probably French, Canada.
[02:39:39.090 --> 02:39:40.050]  Yeah.
[02:39:40.050 --> 02:39:40.890]  Montreal.
[02:39:40.890 --> 02:39:42.610]  But you know, of course, you never know.
[02:39:42.610 --> 02:39:46.250]  There's a lot of, you know, it's a country.
[02:39:49.450 --> 02:39:50.610]  They can be everywhere.
[02:39:51.450 --> 02:39:53.970]  It's a vast territory.
[02:39:53.970 --> 02:39:55.770]  All right, so we didn't hear from Claude.
[02:39:55.770 --> 02:39:58.050]  So I guess you even Grow Bro,
[02:40:02.010 --> 02:40:03.410]  should we call it a winner?
[02:40:04.810 --> 02:40:08.280]  All right, we got a winner.
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:10.000]  So for 260,
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:18.450]  you are the winner of the Glazed Ghost
[02:40:19.450 --> 02:40:21.450]  plus some other stuff.
[02:40:26.090 --> 02:40:31.090]  So Josh, talk about what the next one is
[02:40:32.530 --> 02:40:35.890]  and I'll create a graphic.
[02:40:35.890 --> 02:40:37.610]  So you know what?
[02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:40.250]  We're going to give out some Zelly's Gift
[02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:42.530]  and we've given it out before.
[02:40:42.530 --> 02:40:44.570]  And a lot of people have grown it.
[02:40:44.570 --> 02:40:46.010]  We just really like it a lot.
[02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:48.010]  It's got a Jack Herrera mother.
[02:40:49.330 --> 02:40:53.330]  And the Jack Herrera clone is from Eugene
[02:40:53.330 --> 02:40:58.170]  and big love to the family in Eugene that it comes from.
[02:40:58.170 --> 02:41:02.210]  And we grew it again this year, that mother clone,
[02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:04.010]  the same one that we made the Zelly's out of.
[02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:08.850]  We made the Zelly's in 2014 and it has the A40,
[02:41:08.850 --> 02:41:10.810]  which I described earlier today,
[02:41:10.810 --> 02:41:14.570]  which has the Hawaiian genetics in it and stuff.
[02:41:14.570 --> 02:41:16.970]  And guys, hang on just a sec.
[02:41:17.970 --> 02:41:22.970]  And so yeah, Jack Herrera and A40 as a father.
[02:41:25.490 --> 02:41:28.650]  But in the A40 is a super lemon.
[02:41:28.650 --> 02:41:33.650]  A is created in North Shore of Kauai.
[02:41:34.250 --> 02:41:39.250]  So it must have been 2013 or 12, probably 13.
[02:41:42.810 --> 02:41:44.170]  Yeah, it was 2013.
[02:41:44.170 --> 02:41:46.410]  We were in the North Shore of Kauai.
[02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:49.890]  And old school growers in there,
[02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:52.130]  kind of super gorilla farming at the style.
[02:41:52.130 --> 02:41:55.730]  They were doing a lot of breeding up there.
[02:41:55.730 --> 02:41:58.410]  And so the super lemon haze Hawaiian God Bud
[02:41:58.410 --> 02:41:59.890]  was something they created.
[02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:01.650]  And we grew that out here
[02:42:01.650 --> 02:42:03.770]  and it finished the first year outdoors
[02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:05.850]  with no light deprivation.
[02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:09.290]  And then we liked that a lot and it had that lemony flavor.
[02:42:09.290 --> 02:42:12.210]  So we put that into the Jack Herrera,
[02:42:12.210 --> 02:42:14.850]  which has a really beautiful,
[02:42:15.850 --> 02:42:19.010]  I don't know if anyone would agree with this,
[02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:23.450]  but a kind of a banana-y, lemony sort of flavor to it.
[02:42:23.450 --> 02:42:26.530]  And it's always gift has been really beautiful
[02:42:26.530 --> 02:42:28.530]  for us and a lot of people.
[02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:31.050]  All right, how do you, Z-E-L-L-I-E-S?
[02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:35.330]  Z-E-L-L-Y, Z-E-L-L-Y.
[02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:36.730]  Apostrophe S.
[02:42:36.730 --> 02:42:38.330]  Yeah, gift.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:41.570]  And is it 15 plus seeds?
[02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:42.610]  Yeah, same thing.
[02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:43.610]  Same, same.
[02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:46.370]  Sorry, what's the other thing I'm adding plus what?
[02:42:47.370 --> 02:42:48.930]  Flower seeds.
[02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:53.170]  And incense.
[02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:57.970]  Incense will be good in there too, for sure.
[02:42:57.970 --> 02:43:00.650]  I-N-S?
[02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:03.490]  S-C, oh.
[02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:04.330]  Fuck.
[02:43:07.090 --> 02:43:09.010]  Can I get a spell check on incense?
[02:43:09.010 --> 02:43:12.570]  C-E-N-S-E, that's what I'm going with.
[02:43:12.570 --> 02:43:15.610]  Okay, does anybody disagree?
[02:43:15.610 --> 02:43:19.090]  I-N-C-E-N-S-E, all right, I am exporting that.
[02:43:20.250 --> 02:43:21.650]  And I would love to describe to you
[02:43:21.650 --> 02:43:23.010]  what the incense is made from,
[02:43:23.010 --> 02:43:24.490]  but I won't do that right now.
[02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:28.610]  Yeah, it's really special though, from Bali.
[02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:33.860]  You could describe it.
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:35.860]  But I would like to also just tell people,
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:37.860]  go ahead if you have something to say.
[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:39.060]  No, no, no, I was gonna say,
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:41.340]  we gotta kill some time until I get this graphic up,
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.420]  so say whatever you're gonna say.
[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.060]  Okay, well, first off,
[02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:48.460]  Zelly's Gift is a gift to our friend Zelly,
[02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:52.980]  who is a local artist in Eugene and Portland,
[02:43:52.980 --> 02:43:55.300]  has done hip hop, had Rebel Skates,
[02:43:55.300 --> 02:43:58.380]  a skateboard company in Portland back in the day,
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:01.860]  has sung in punk rock bands and different things.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:04.380]  He's just a local awesome person.
[02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:08.420]  And Gina is his partner, and it was horrible.
[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:11.300]  But back in the day when it was really hardcore,
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:15.700]  they got busted driving weed back East
[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:18.460]  and went to jail for three years in Illinois.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:21.060]  And it was really horrible.
[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:23.580]  And they were really close friends of a lot of people
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:26.100]  in the family at Country Fair and in Eugene.
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:29.100]  And yeah, I mean, it was,
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:31.580]  and so they went to jail for three years.
[02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:34.460]  And so when they got out, we were creating this,
[02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:37.460]  the strain was kind of creating itself in a way.
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:39.100]  We were just kind of doing these crosses
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:43.180]  and this one plant just like really stood out to us.
[02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:46.060]  And we decided to call it the Zelly's Gift
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:50.140]  with his permission, of course, at the time.
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:51.180]  And he's really stoked
[02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:52.980]  and they're both really stoked about it.
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:56.020]  But yeah, so Zelly lives in Eugene.
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:45:01.020]  So give big love to Eugene and Zelly and G-Yvonne
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:02.900]  and the whole crew down there.
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:08.200]  Holding it down.
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:14.440]  If we are killing time,
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.520]  I could tell you that the incense
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.120]  is special because it's made from tapioca roots.
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:27.800]  And it's like an old world, like in Bali,
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:31.040]  all the temples have palm scripture
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:33.920]  known as Lantar scripture and their palm leaves.
[02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:36.040]  And they're all written on there,
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.240]  thousands of years old, some of them,
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:42.000]  and there are old like recipes and chants
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:43.560]  and prayers and different things.
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:47.080]  But there's this one of these, there's oil recipes
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:48.760]  and there's special oil recipes.
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:53.760]  And the incense that we have is a tapioca root
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:56.320]  that they make a paste out of the root
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:59.920]  and then they burn coconut husk
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:01.680]  and get black coconut husk
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:04.240]  and add all kinds of different spices,
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:08.000]  frankincenses and mers and canaga and ylang ylang
[02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:10.960]  and all the different things, clove.
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.040]  I don't think, no, clove's not in that one.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.080]  There's different ones that I don't know the exact recipe
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:18.320]  because I'm not open.
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:21.480]  I mean, I've been to the temples, but anyway.
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.760]  So then they take strips of bamboo
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:30.000]  and roll it in the sticky tapioca root
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  and then they roll it on the charcoal of coconut husk,
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.600]  which has got all the spices in it.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:40.640]  And then, so it's really clean.
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:43.200]  And then when you dip it, you dip it in oil,
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:45.640]  this really beautiful oil, essential oil.
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:48.600]  It's made in Bali of all natural products.
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:53.440]  And it's just the most magical smell in the world for us.
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.200]  I mean, I like anything natural.
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.640]  So of course there's white sage and palo santo
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:00.200]  and frankincense and myrrh.
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:01.560]  All those things are important,
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:04.480]  but this incense has been something,
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.600]  important in our lives for a long time.
[02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:10.160]  So that's a little story.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:14.680]  So Josh, just quickly, someone asked if it's CBD rich
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:15.600]  or does it have-
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:18.040]  It's not, no, it's not.
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:22.280]  We do have, we could do some CBD rich ones
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:24.680]  if that was interesting to people.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:26.240]  The healers one we've done in the past,
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:27.200]  which is a one-to-one,
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.440]  but we also did some hemp crosses last year as well.
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:37.220]  So we've done a lot of hemp breeding
[02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:42.220]  and there's some auto flower in the hemp too,
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:45.260]  which has been pretty awesome.
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:51.020]  And what are we at right now?
[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:58.020]  Yeah, why is everyone doing like the no sense?
[02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:05.940]  They're like, what's this incense?
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:06.780]  But you know what?
[02:48:06.820 --> 02:48:10.460]  You can put the incense on the full moon
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:14.660]  in accordance with the right crystals that you want.
[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:17.660]  And you maybe put the seeds in your mouth
[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:22.660]  and put some of your own saliva and DNA on the seed.
[02:48:26.980 --> 02:48:28.740]  And then if you put it in the soil,
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:31.780]  I mean, magical things happen.
[02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:33.460]  And, you know.
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:36.020]  That's how you change the world.
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:39.540]  You know, start seeds, make seeds.
[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:41.620]  As Bodie says, plant more seeds.
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:46.860]  So it's DH20 with 310.
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:51.300]  Is that a, it's DH20, can you confirm?
[02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:52.820]  He had it at 270
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:54.700]  and then everybody started monkeying around.
[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:56.580]  So he just tried to make sure he won.
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:48:59.060]  So I would give it to him for 270
[02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:00.820]  unless he really wants to pay 310.
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:03.060]  Donate, donate 310.
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:03.900]  Yeah, donate.
[02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.820]  Put it in a positive.
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:08.220]  It's a cause, this is for a cause.
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:14.020]  Jackson, we got some of that hash from you last year
[02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:15.380]  and it's just been really wonderful.
[02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:17.340]  And I wanna thank you for it since we're,
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:19.580]  if you're still, I think you're still here.
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:21.580]  Yeah, I'm just, I gotta get going in a second.
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:23.340]  I gotta walk the dog, but I got stuck.
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:25.140]  I was gonna go right before the incense
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:27.340]  and I had to stay for the incense story.
[02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:29.220]  So I'm gonna go ahead and get going.
[02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:31.140]  I'm gonna stay for the incense story.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:33.420]  Yeah, that's cool, man.
[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:36.940]  That was, that hash is from 2009 from this clone
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:40.060]  that I got from these bag seeds from the HP13
[02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:42.500]  that my buddy brought back from Hana in Maui.
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:43.460]  Okay, okay.
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:46.260]  I used to get that weed from my Rasta buddy over there,
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:47.580]  like a gram at a time.
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:49.860]  It was so hard to get any of it from him.
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:52.260]  He'd be like, yo, I got the HP, man.
[02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:54.180]  And I'd like eat a little piece.
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:57.700]  And then my buddy was coming back in 2008
[02:49:57.700 --> 02:50:00.260]  and he said, I got some, I'm coming back.
[02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:01.380]  I just got back from Maui.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:04.340]  I got some seeds from you, some special seeds.
[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:07.300]  And he goes, he goes, they're really cool, you know?
[02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:10.140]  And I go, oh, are they HP13?
[02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:10.980]  And he, cause he goes,
[02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:12.940]  I got it from some of the killer weed over there,
[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:14.300]  you know, and I goes, HP13?
[02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:16.380]  He goes, man, how the fuck did you know?
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:18.940]  I go, it's the only thing I know in Maui
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:21.980]  that really is like, people are like trip out on that.
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.940]  And then there was this dog back then too
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:26.580]  that was like a chem dog bag seed or something.
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:29.300]  But that, I got that.
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:33.260]  And it's this like, it smells like straight, like pine saw.
[02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:39.140]  And then when the hash got like super cured
[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:40.980]  after a few years, it started to have like,
[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:42.700]  kind of almost like a peppermint patty,
[02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:44.740]  dark chocolate smell to it.
[02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:47.020]  But with that little bit, cause all that pining in it,
[02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:49.660]  it had that little bit of coolness to it.
[02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:52.380]  And I just noticed that once it got old,
[02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:55.900]  it was like when I would have times where I wasn't smoking
[02:50:56.380 --> 02:50:58.500]  I would have just like no tolerance
[02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:00.500]  and everything would creep me out when I smoked it.
[02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:02.820]  I could smoke that and it would be exact,
[02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:06.340]  it would be like the same feeling that I would get
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:08.260]  when I was used to stuff, you know?
[02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:11.620]  But yeah, I'm stoked.
[02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:12.780]  I was gonna ask you about that.
[02:51:12.780 --> 02:51:15.860]  I was hoping you guys, that you guys got to try that out.
[02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:16.900]  Cause it's like, you know,
[02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:18.660]  I have this big chunk of it still.
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:22.940]  I took all my trim that time and just made this big,
[02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:26.420]  it was like a, you know, bigger than a softball
[02:51:26.420 --> 02:51:28.420]  of just this big gob of that stuff.
[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:30.660]  And I still have a bunch of it.
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:31.500]  It's really killer.
[02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:36.220]  But yeah, that's like my favorite, like mellow.
[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:37.380]  Like it just, it gives you,
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:39.060]  it's just like nothing but warmth, right?
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:40.620]  Like you don't get this edge.
[02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:43.100]  It's just like, Ooh, okay, this is nice.
[02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:43.940]  Yeah.
[02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:45.220]  It's fulfilling.
[02:51:45.220 --> 02:51:46.140]  Yeah.
[02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:47.220]  Cool, man.
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:51.260]  And we have a couple of Sky Cutler Kush crosses in here
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:54.020]  that we kind of got through the family and stuff
[02:51:54.020 --> 02:51:54.860]  and everything.
[02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:55.700]  So those are awesome.
[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:57.340]  Cool, those are usually pretty quick.
[02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:58.180]  They do good.
[02:51:58.180 --> 02:51:59.500]  And they do really good.
[02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:02.500]  The only people who I've had not have good results with it,
[02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:06.900]  like push the hell out of them with a bunch of nitrogen.
[02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:09.700]  And it's just like that, those Kushes don't really,
[02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:11.700]  that's why they're so dark green usually.
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:12.540]  Like OG, it's-
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:13.380]  Right, they don't need it.
[02:52:13.380 --> 02:52:14.420]  It doesn't need it.
[02:52:14.420 --> 02:52:15.940]  And so then people do it and they're like,
[02:52:15.940 --> 02:52:16.820]  I don't know, is LARFy?
[02:52:16.820 --> 02:52:20.220]  And I'm like, the one thing it's not is like,
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:22.260]  it's usually just meatballs, you know?
[02:52:22.260 --> 02:52:23.500]  Right.
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:25.620]  But yeah, so, you know, they'll do great for you
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:27.900]  cause you're just using the soil and not-
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:31.180]  Josh, don't give him too much salt fertilizer.
[02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:35.340]  Yeah, you really want the soil, the life to be carried.
[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:37.500]  It was just your urge to do that.
[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:39.820]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:40.780]  So hard.
[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:46.900]  These guys, he's gotta tell, keep Josh out of that,
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:48.940]  keep him from dipping into the 30, 10, 10.
[02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:50.300]  Don't let me go to town.
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:51.140]  You know what I mean?
[02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:52.500]  No Peter self.
[02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:53.740]  No Grow More, bro.
[02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:57.780]  All right, well shit, I gotta get going,
[02:52:57.780 --> 02:52:59.740]  but it was great to see you guys
[02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:02.580]  and everybody doing stuff on here.

[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:13.100]  for me and I wish everybody luck on getting stuff
[02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:16.140]  and doing stuff and everybody, if I don't talk to you,

[02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:21.900]  in real life at some point.
[02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:22.900]  Yeah.
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:25.100]  Right on, Jackson, take care of yourself.
[02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:25.940]  Have a good one, yeah.

[02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:41.740]  cause she just got fed and she's gonna start scratching
[02:53:42.060 --> 02:53:44.900]  on the door and I gotta feed myself and stuff.

[02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:45.430]  Let's see, we, I'm gonna compare both the emails
[02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:47.550]  and the PayPal account.
[02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:49.870]  Let me see what I've got.
[02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:58.590]  So the most recent one would be Eric at,
[02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:07.150]  yeah, 270, and then Nicholas at 260,
[02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:16.870]  Brent 250, Eric again at 200,
[02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:21.710]  George at 520, Kelly,
[02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:26.510]  that's not part of this,
[02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:31.390]  that's somebody donating $20, Tim, Eric again.
[02:55:34.470 --> 02:55:39.470]  Before that, Andre, David, Adam, Tim, Brent,
[02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:47.430]  and that's the beginning.
[02:55:48.430 --> 02:55:49.270]  All right.
[02:55:49.270 --> 02:55:50.110]  All right.
[02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:55.110]  Well, do we wanna call it a night on that?
[02:55:55.470 --> 02:55:56.710]  Do we wanna?
[02:55:56.710 --> 02:55:59.790]  Well, I'm gonna have to move to another location,
[02:55:59.790 --> 02:56:03.470]  which, so I would be happy to sign off.
[02:56:03.470 --> 02:56:08.470]  Do you feel good about, can the money we raised
[02:56:09.790 --> 02:56:10.750]  do you some good?
[02:56:10.750 --> 02:56:13.430]  Oh my God, yeah, it's the most money we've ever raised,
[02:56:13.430 --> 02:56:16.310]  and since the Green Day concert,
[02:56:16.310 --> 02:56:21.310]  when they did the concert at Oakland.
[02:56:22.910 --> 02:56:24.870]  So we're going head to head with Green Day
[02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:25.990]  and we're holding our own.
[02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:27.790]  You're holding your own.
[02:56:27.790 --> 02:56:28.990]  Nice.
[02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:29.990]  That's pretty amazing.
[02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:32.390]  Thank you so much, everyone.
[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:35.670]  The cannabis community stepping up.
[02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:36.950]  It's amazing, yeah.
[02:56:38.350 --> 02:56:39.190]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:42.590]  Yeah, I mean, we, yeah, it's since it's 11,
[02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:44.830]  we do these things, we try to be fast,
[02:56:44.830 --> 02:56:48.390]  and then we're super slow with the auctions,
[02:56:48.390 --> 02:56:49.430]  but we do our best.
[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:52.150]  We're running a tighter and tighter ship,
[02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:56.910]  but we appreciate you and hope that.
[02:56:58.630 --> 02:57:00.070]  This is a big help.
[02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.910]  It's so beautiful.
[02:57:00.910 --> 02:57:03.190]  It makes a dent and yeah, it does some good.
[02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:04.790]  And just for everybody watching,
[02:57:06.190 --> 02:57:07.710]  in the future, we'll do stuff
[02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:09.790]  that's much lower ticket items,
[02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:11.590]  so more people can participate.
[02:57:11.590 --> 02:57:14.390]  I'm thinking more like raffles and just like,
[02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:19.910]  we have 50 grassroots fabric pot raise beds
[02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:24.110]  and they go for a hundred bucks
[02:57:24.110 --> 02:57:27.910]  and you can all get them for 75 tonight,
[02:57:27.910 --> 02:57:30.870]  like kind of better than you could get
[02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:32.750]  if you went to the retail websites.
[02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:37.510]  And I think that'll, for whatever the cause may be,
[02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:39.990]  that'll help more people kind of contribute.
[02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:42.550]  And so everybody just hold tight.
[02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:44.150]  We're doing our best.
[02:57:45.150 --> 02:57:48.230]  I'd like to thank the Brady Bunch lineup
[02:57:48.230 --> 02:57:51.430]  that I'm seeing in my Zoom window.
[02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:58.310]  I think Josh, his phone must've died,
[02:57:58.310 --> 02:58:00.990]  which is usually what happens when he leaves unannounced,
[02:58:00.990 --> 02:58:05.550]  but thank you everyone for watching.
[02:58:05.550 --> 02:58:08.590]  And for the people whose stuff we didn't get to,
[02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:13.150]  I am cognizant that we didn't get to,
[02:58:13.150 --> 02:58:15.630]  I'm thinking of you Elke and some other people,
[02:58:17.310 --> 02:58:19.190]  but hopefully we're gonna do more.
[02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:22.590]  And then we're also working on building
[02:58:22.590 --> 02:58:26.190]  kind of a donation platform in the background
[02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:27.390]  where it doesn't have to be,
[02:58:27.390 --> 02:58:30.510]  I view this as like the YouTube telethon,
[02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:32.430]  but there's also just the like,
[02:58:32.430 --> 02:58:35.150]  I wanna donate something and it goes on a website
[02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:39.630]  and people can either buy it or bid on it or whatever
[02:58:39.630 --> 02:58:42.310]  and pick the charity it goes to
[02:58:42.310 --> 02:58:45.510]  or the person whose home burnt down or whatever it may be.
[02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:50.950]  So anyway, with that, I hope everyone has a good night.
[02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:55.670]  And for all the people who won, please email me
[02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:58.270]  and Keith, I'll reconcile with you.
[02:58:58.270 --> 02:59:00.350]  Cause for me, for everyone watching,
[02:59:00.350 --> 02:59:03.350]  one of the big things is once these things end,
[02:59:03.350 --> 02:59:05.310]  since we don't have any visibility
[02:59:05.310 --> 02:59:08.190]  into payments being made,
[02:59:08.510 --> 02:59:11.550]  we have to rely on both like Keith.
[02:59:11.550 --> 02:59:15.270]  And then last night we had Brett and Sean.
[02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:18.190]  So they have to be like, yes,
[02:59:18.190 --> 02:59:22.510]  I'm seeing on PayPal that someone paid $290
[02:59:22.510 --> 02:59:25.230]  and it's not the YouTube name, it's a real name.
[02:59:26.270 --> 02:59:27.630]  So we got to kind of match,
[02:59:27.630 --> 02:59:29.870]  then tell the people who made the donations
[02:59:29.870 --> 02:59:33.230]  or the readers, like, you know,
[02:59:33.230 --> 02:59:34.390]  let me connect you with a guy
[02:59:34.390 --> 02:59:37.710]  you need to send the seeds to so that I can help.
[02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:39.310]  So I'm gonna send the seeds to you
[02:59:39.310 --> 02:59:41.950]  so that that guy doesn't start getting all pissed off.
[02:59:43.870 --> 02:59:46.510]  But what we do know is that there's gonna be an overnight
[02:59:46.510 --> 02:59:50.750]  of 2000 seeds to Adam in Santa Cruz
[02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:54.670]  to start the rebuilding, auto flower style.
[02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:55.510]  Beautiful.
[02:59:57.510 --> 03:00:01.710]  So with that, I'm gonna kill the YouTube
[03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:03.390]  and everybody have a good night.
[03:00:03.390 --> 03:00:06.030]  Bye bye, thanks everyone for all your support.
[03:00:06.030 --> 03:00:07.070]  That's so beautiful.
