[00:00.000 --> 00:05.180]  Like in little and we are a couple nugs of this stuff. He's got a weird one
[00:05.180 --> 00:07.940]  He says he gave me this one. It's like all dark chocolate
[00:08.760 --> 00:13.960]  There's nothing nothing mean about it. There's it's just really pleasant
[00:14.760 --> 00:17.900]  Dark chocolate. It smells like that kind of
[00:18.520 --> 00:20.520]  kind of you know
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.520]  Dark chocolatey, you know, it's not like a bad. It's very kind of dark chalky
[00:25.520 --> 00:31.280]  It's got a sweetness to it like it has that coke that bitter cocoa
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.840]  So just I managed to hit the live like 30 seconds into the description that you were there so what
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.600]  Is I like we absolutely need to share that and I'll just do the quick intro so everybody knows what the fuck is happening
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.840]  Welcome to planting seeds with mr. Trees where we hang out with mr
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.680]  Trees and plant seeds and grow his plants and talk about them if they're great. We'll tell them if they're not so great
[00:56.680 --> 01:04.320]  Well, we don't know we haven't come to that conclusion yet, but we won't get there probably because so far these plants look fucking awesome
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.320]  And I've been super impressed like I mean like really cool really good so far. I've got them
[01:10.320 --> 01:13.300]  They're kind of on the screen there. You can kind of see them a little bit
[01:13.880 --> 01:15.880]  But you want to do you want to say?
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.280]  Hello, mr. Trees and tell us about exactly what you just said there and I'm gonna I want to I want to see that we
[01:21.800 --> 01:23.800]  yeah, so I was saying my
[01:24.280 --> 01:27.200]  my buddy down the road was growing some of the ice cream cake and
[01:27.640 --> 01:30.560]  he was gracious enough to hand me a couple of buds of it and
[01:31.420 --> 01:34.600]  he said that this one in particular he had a couple of them and
[01:35.400 --> 01:41.000]  This one in particular was kind of a you know interesting to him because it was very just dark chocolate
[01:41.080 --> 01:43.600]  It was dark chocolate on the taste and the flavor
[01:43.880 --> 01:49.500]  It kind of held holds that way through a few few good rips out of the pipe so far
[01:49.500 --> 01:51.680]  And I haven't rolled a joint with it. I'm gonna do that tonight
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.880]  But it holds that dark dark chocolate kind of flavor. It's very kind of
[01:57.520 --> 01:59.520]  cocoa II and
[02:00.080 --> 02:01.360]  You know
[02:01.360 --> 02:03.440]  Mildly pleasant. It's very interesting
[02:03.440 --> 02:09.920]  It didn't get any of the nastiness that that I was looking for it to get and it developed this strange
[02:10.920 --> 02:15.160]  Dark chocolate, you know tone to it and it's throughout
[02:15.160 --> 02:21.520]  it's it's the kind of the smell has this sweetness and this cocoa and and this dark chocolate kind of tone to it and
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.640]  It tastes exactly how it smells. I mean, it's it's very strange, you know, they don't usually they don't always do that
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.200]  You know, I was just saying I was smoking dog walker earlier and I'm like god damn it
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.920]  I wish it tasted as nasty as it smelled, you know, I wish I could get the nastiest, you know taste out of there
[02:37.320 --> 02:43.760]  The smell just doesn't match up all the time every time so but this does this one matches up exactly with that dark chocolate tone
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.720]  It's got good resin content, can you move your camera a little bit there? Mr.
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.600]  Trees you keep your beautiful face keeps bobbing off. Oh, yeah
[02:54.800 --> 02:56.800]  There you go. Yeah
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.860]  There we go. Everybody can see your pretty face now I can go like this. Everybody can see your pretty face
[03:03.680 --> 03:05.680]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.520]  Yeah, I just started tearing into this a little earlier, you know, and I've got some drying
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.200]  Myself I got a couple of these drying and I got a couple of the SFV Canada ours, you know
[03:19.200 --> 03:22.080]  I'm just now starting to get get looking pretty so
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.840]  Be able to show some of those probably next time here. But yeah, I was I was intrigued
[03:27.840 --> 03:33.880]  This is I wish I could show it. I'll take a picture on Instagram today. Anybody follows me or knows that stuff?
[03:33.880 --> 03:38.640]  I'll take a little nice picture of some of the nugs up close and kind of post a
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.400]  Post a picture of this ice cream cake. I'm up some time in a little bit
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.160]  So what's going on with y'all
[03:47.440 --> 03:53.680]  You want to start with garden updates, why don't you you get us rolling there coastal growing? Oh gee, how's your garden growing?
[03:58.680 --> 04:00.680]  Tell me if you can see
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.000]  Yeah, we can look at that there we go, that's a bushy looking plant
[04:07.760 --> 04:14.040]  Yeah, the one on the this side right here that's a female the other ones are I think
[04:14.480 --> 04:19.720]  There's a male right here. And then I think a male in the back and I haven't sexed the back one
[04:20.520 --> 04:22.520]  over there
[04:22.720 --> 04:28.200]  But yeah, they're doing well there I think honestly from what I've seen
[04:30.680 --> 04:34.640]  Drop the phone. I think from what I've seen
[04:37.040 --> 04:44.160]  Morphologically, I I'm betting the tall one that female will be the best one out of all of them
[04:44.560 --> 04:51.100]  because it always happens with these Afghan ease with the the one with a stretchy internet that always looks more like a
[04:51.720 --> 04:54.040]  sour diesel always ends up like a
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.320]  Lot lot more potent it might not yield more or anything
[04:58.320 --> 05:03.000]  but it will always be more potent and I just I'm thinking this this one is uh,
[05:03.480 --> 05:06.680]  It's gonna be the the winner on all of them
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.240]  But uh
[05:10.240 --> 05:17.040]  Yeah, one once I suss through it all and and I can make some I'm gonna be crossing that against like I said, uh against some
[05:17.040 --> 05:18.120]  purple haze
[05:18.120 --> 05:25.680]  Pollen and then I'll be trying to throw those seeds through FCP and obviously everyone on here is
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.600]  Is getting anything I make so
[05:37.080 --> 05:39.720]  All right, well what I would love to do
[05:41.320 --> 05:47.360]  Farming hopped in and before we hop over and ask Cory about what's going on in his garden. Well, we'll hop over to mr
[05:47.360 --> 05:54.280]  Trees and ask him a question as you are the lead breeder and I figure it's more fun that way
[05:55.880 --> 06:02.140]  Because everybody hears about my shit and what my opinions are all the time anyways, so nobody nobody really cares about my opinion
[06:03.040 --> 06:05.580]  At least that's what it feels like in my home
[06:06.400 --> 06:12.520]  Anyways, how long do I need to wait for photo plants to tell me whether or not it's a boy or a girl?
[06:13.040 --> 06:22.300]  You know it it varies it needs to reach sexual maturity so it's got to have several several node sites
[06:23.100 --> 06:28.860]  Depends on the size pot. I mean it depends on how you you know, how your growth conditions are
[06:28.860 --> 06:30.860]  I mean it really can vary a lot
[06:31.980 --> 06:35.860]  I find that I'm trying to force them to show me sex
[06:36.700 --> 06:40.500]  Before they really want to and I do that by flipping them early
[06:40.620 --> 06:45.340]  Taking clones off of them and flipping, you know flipping them to figure out who's who a
[06:46.180 --> 06:49.940]  Bunch of different ways keeping them in small pots the smaller pot you keep them in
[06:51.020 --> 06:53.900]  The more stressed out they'll kind of get when they're when they're vegging out
[06:53.900 --> 07:00.140]  They'll reach the the edges of the pots and I'll like kind of you know sense they should you know get on with it
[07:00.140 --> 07:05.780]  So they'll start showing sex but it's you know, it's it's several weeks
[07:05.780 --> 07:07.780]  I mean you're you're you know six weeks
[07:07.780 --> 07:15.300]  Eight weeks certain cases. I mean depends on the strain and the type but you got several weeks there of veg time before you see anything
[07:15.300 --> 07:19.500]  And it's you know, it depends on the size of the pot in your in your grow environment what you're gonna do
[07:19.500 --> 07:24.020]  My best advice is if you want to know what it is, then you know
[07:24.900 --> 07:27.620]  Top it a little bit more keep it in a smaller pot
[07:28.180 --> 07:33.060]  Put it under a little bit more, you know a little bit more stress and it will it'll show you sooner
[07:33.060 --> 07:36.500]  But usually when a plants growing like a young seedling I can go I
[07:37.220 --> 07:43.460]  Don't have a seedling near me, but a seedling will grow straight up. I have a seedling. I have a yeah
[07:43.460 --> 07:46.700]  Yeah, just got a couple of sets on it, right? So like as it's growing up
[07:47.460 --> 07:51.500]  You'll see that the sets are even on the plant. It'll be boom
[07:51.500 --> 07:57.140]  The nodes will be even branches will come out. Boom. The nodes will be even they'll be coming out the exact same point
[07:57.140 --> 07:59.140]  And then as soon as that plant reaches maturity
[07:59.140 --> 08:02.700]  They'll start staggering one branch will start coming off low and then right above it
[08:02.700 --> 08:06.140]  They'll start coming off a little stagger. You'll see it start to stagger off
[08:06.460 --> 08:11.860]  Instead of being matched up and having branches come out evenly on both sides when it reaches sexual maturity
[08:11.860 --> 08:15.380]  you'll start seeing the the the you know, the
[08:18.540 --> 08:20.540]  You'll start seeing a
[08:21.700 --> 08:26.020]  Branch coming out on one side and then it'll go up a little bit and then it'll come down a little bit
[08:26.140 --> 08:30.860]  Branch coming out on one side and then it'll go up a little bit and then a branch will start coming out on the other
[08:30.860 --> 08:37.660]  Side, but a seedling a young seedling that's not mature or sick, you know sexually capable showing anything will be they'll be they'll be dead
[08:37.660 --> 08:42.540]  Even they'll be one and one one and one one and one and they'll always come in pairs until it reaches maturity
[08:44.420 --> 08:48.660]  So if you want to know if your plants mature that's when it'll start showing you you know
[08:48.660 --> 08:54.420]  Where the nodes don't line up anymore and you'll know you're getting really close to seeing what the sex is of the plant
[08:55.020 --> 08:59.900]  It'll happen, you know one or two times and then you'll see a sex organ pop out of there
[09:00.580 --> 09:02.580]  when it's ready to go, but
[09:02.940 --> 09:08.420]  No exact timeline that I can I can say that I've timed it personally and said it takes this long
[09:08.700 --> 09:10.020]  For it to show me sex
[09:10.020 --> 09:14.380]  It just shows me what it shows me and I try to speed it up as much as I can, you know
[09:14.380 --> 09:17.620]  I agree 100% on this stress
[09:17.620 --> 09:22.980]  I feel like stress drives it to sexual maturity because it's trying to just live
[09:23.540 --> 09:25.540]  And reproduce and
[09:27.100 --> 09:35.220]  Yeah, you like the plants behind me are like roughly what four feet tall and some of them aren't really showing large
[09:36.580 --> 09:41.980]  Reproductive organs and typically like I can even get a plant to sex out at like 18 inches
[09:41.980 --> 09:46.820]  you know pretty pretty short and a six inch pot and these are in three gallon pots and
[09:47.420 --> 09:52.020]  It's just one of those things. It's just if that plant is happy
[09:52.020 --> 09:54.900]  It's just gonna keep trying to live its best life. I guess
[09:55.780 --> 09:57.780]  It's not helpful for us
[09:57.900 --> 10:02.260]  But that's what it wants to do. So it's gonna do it and
[10:03.060 --> 10:07.020]  yeah, I you know, I'll just you know, I just accept it and just go with it and
[10:07.540 --> 10:12.500]  If you want to force it, you can just force it into 1212 and that'll do it
[10:12.500 --> 10:15.460]  I mean you can force the seedling in 1212 and like
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.940]  drive the
[10:17.940 --> 10:24.860]  Drive the flowering early. I mean the plants not gonna have a lot of biomass on it, but you know, it is what it is
[10:25.660 --> 10:28.340]  So yeah, I agree. I agree completely about that
[10:29.420 --> 10:33.460]  So it's a peace of mind farming. When did you put your seeds down?
[10:34.700 --> 10:38.700]  Like well, how old are they because it really it depends on when you started your outdoor
[10:38.700 --> 10:43.700]  Like some people like me start some outdoor stuff like maybe in you know, November
[10:43.940 --> 10:49.780]  Maybe maybe I get really ballsy and started in September and like really well, you know, like go big go home
[10:49.780 --> 10:52.700]  You know, maybe be an idiot depends on you
[10:53.420 --> 10:59.020]  But my question is like it really depends on the point in time. I was going to clip them and flip them
[10:59.020 --> 11:01.420]  Oh, you'll find out really quick that way. I
[11:02.180 --> 11:08.700]  find it's like eight weeks of like hard vegetative growth roundabout is when you can start expecting it and
[11:08.820 --> 11:12.100]  You know what I see most have often happened wrong is people just
[11:12.420 --> 11:15.980]  Jump the gun on it and they like they think it's a boy
[11:15.980 --> 11:21.500]  They just chop this is like oh, it's a boy fuck chop chop chop chop chop and sometimes it's just like
[11:22.500 --> 11:25.380]  If you wait a little bit longer you would have seen some pistols
[11:26.420 --> 11:33.300]  That brack might look extended or what have you? You know, it's it is what it is. It's it's funny
[11:33.300 --> 11:38.460]  I think it's better to save a plant than to and to not and people think it's like how how long
[11:38.940 --> 11:44.820]  Before flowers start showing up. Do you guys do you usually start worrying about pollen dropping? Mr. Trees?
[11:47.500 --> 11:50.380]  You got a while, you know, you got a while
[11:52.540 --> 11:54.540]  Like you you're you figure
[11:55.260 --> 11:59.900]  You're gonna flip them and then you know a week week and a half maybe two weeks
[11:59.980 --> 12:02.460]  You know, you're starting to see some things happening
[12:03.300 --> 12:05.300]  You know and it's gonna take another
[12:05.700 --> 12:07.700]  You know week or two
[12:08.540 --> 12:13.700]  Growing before anything's really formed and sometimes you'll get those males that'll have that that little flower
[12:13.700 --> 12:19.660]  It'll just hang off and just be like this one flower that it's like super pioneer and wants to open up early
[12:19.660 --> 12:23.780]  You know what? I mean? But as soon as you start seeing some actual formed balls
[12:24.540 --> 12:26.540]  then you know the
[12:27.300 --> 12:30.300]  The count is on it could be any day at that point
[12:30.660 --> 12:33.140]  One or two of those things could start opening up
[12:33.220 --> 12:34.820]  But if you're watching it
[12:34.820 --> 12:39.980]  I mean you can see it a mile away and you can watch it and let it hang out for a long time to
[12:39.980 --> 12:45.260]  Be sure, you know what? I mean? I've had males completely nugged up like they look like friggin colas, you know
[12:45.260 --> 12:51.060]  And none of the balls have opened up yet. And you know, there's no problem, you know, you can throw that out or whatever
[12:51.060 --> 12:58.420]  You know, that's you know at that point, but sometimes I have those pioneer males that'll throw that one or two little little flowers
[12:58.420 --> 13:02.060]  so just you know, look at the plants and
[13:02.940 --> 13:08.620]  You know, it's usually those lower branches to those that bottom half will throw those little pioneer ones a little quicker
[13:08.900 --> 13:12.700]  But you know look at the plant overall and if you actually see a fully formed
[13:13.020 --> 13:18.100]  Ball hanging off of its little stem dangling their clothes like a little eyeball then
[13:18.540 --> 13:23.040]  Yeah, it's time to make a decision whether you stand or going because he could open it any minute
[13:23.340 --> 13:29.260]  But you're you you can watch it. It's good. It takes several weeks three four weeks before you have to worry about it
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.260]  What's up, what's up coastal?
[13:32.860 --> 13:36.380]  So I pull them as soon as I see male
[13:36.900 --> 13:45.220]  Flowers pulling out and actually fruiting like when they the balls actually start to hang off with like the stems when they actually start
[13:45.220 --> 13:47.220]  to get to fruition
[13:47.500 --> 13:52.140]  That's when I pull them and it's usually 10 to 14 days into flowering
[13:52.540 --> 13:54.900]  With 12 12, it depends
[13:55.300 --> 14:02.540]  The other thing I was geeking out laughing because it's like the other thing I was thinking about is every chem line and every ogk line
[14:03.580 --> 14:07.740]  Freaking goes berm at and and you can't ever predict it
[14:07.740 --> 14:13.940]  I or I guess you can predict it at six weeks. There's going to be a ghost male flower
[14:14.780 --> 14:18.300]  Somewhere and it's gonna pollinate it in by nine weeks
[14:18.460 --> 14:23.580]  If you pull it early, you know, cuz you know chem chem D chem for chem 91
[14:24.300 --> 14:26.300]  And ogk
[14:26.340 --> 14:28.780]  original educate and then all the other educate lines
[14:29.060 --> 14:34.340]  they all do the same thing and they all want to run to like 10 weeks at least and
[14:35.620 --> 14:41.940]  By six weeks. There's some ghost male flower somewhere that pops out and you never can find it and
[14:42.900 --> 14:50.260]  and yeah, you always in with one seed somewhere in that and that's why every single bag of like
[14:50.900 --> 14:56.940]  Any chem based thing always you if you buy an O of something you're gonna find at least one seat and
[14:57.460 --> 15:02.620]  I just think it's hilarious because it's like you're just fighting the tide with all this
[15:05.260 --> 15:06.820]  Hmm I
[15:06.820 --> 15:08.820]  Think that's super well put man
[15:09.060 --> 15:14.020]  Appreciate that. I'm a little bit stoned. I've had a long tiring day in the Sun. It's been beautiful
[15:14.020 --> 15:18.860]  Probably not as long and tiring day as mr. Tree. So they feel like he doesn't leave the Sun. He's like outside all day long
[15:19.020 --> 15:21.020]  No, I don't
[15:21.380 --> 15:23.380]  You have scale
[15:23.420 --> 15:25.420]  That sucks
[15:25.660 --> 15:31.500]  It doesn't suck. It's just part of life. It depends on how you look at it, right? No. Yeah. No. Yeah, that's
[15:32.460 --> 15:38.380]  It's never it's a normal thing around here. You go to any citrus place and we find scale places, you know
[15:38.380 --> 15:40.380]  But when it gets ugly
[15:40.660 --> 15:46.500]  Whoo, it's fun. You know, you can see some cool stuff happening, you know, but it's you know
[15:46.500 --> 15:48.500]  it's one of those things and it's
[15:48.980 --> 15:54.940]  you know, look it's a nutritional thing those sucking insects are picking on on plants and
[15:56.420 --> 16:01.340]  It's just one of those things man, I found sit with Asian citrus psyllid today out in
[16:02.060 --> 16:07.180]  East County today. I was looking at some trees. I found some Asian citrus psyllid, you know, that's a nasty
[16:07.580 --> 16:12.580]  That's the bad one. That's the one you don't really want to see and then everywhere else you go
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.420]  And
[16:15.660 --> 16:17.660]  You know
[16:19.100 --> 16:21.100]  You know
[16:21.820 --> 16:25.980]  Especially right now especially in San Diego because we don't really have a winner to kill anything either
[16:26.420 --> 16:28.980]  so everything can kind of just hang out and
[16:30.100 --> 16:35.460]  Not die off and just pick up where it left off as soon as it kind of the warm weather kicks in, you know
[16:35.860 --> 16:36.860]  so
[16:36.860 --> 16:38.860]  If you're not on top of it
[16:39.860 --> 16:41.860]  See
[16:43.060 --> 16:49.700]  You kind of get that homeostasis point where everything's kind of in balance and then you don't really have too many you have pressures
[16:49.700 --> 16:56.820]  But everything seems to be working itself off. It seems like you could you can maintain that better that being said you always have pressure
[16:57.140 --> 16:59.140]  Yeah
[17:00.020 --> 17:03.780]  Isn't it though well, no I get break I get a break in the winter
[17:03.780 --> 17:08.020]  Like it's it's like I get pressure in the greenhouse, but I have to like like this spring
[17:08.020 --> 17:15.000]  I've been getting a lot of a fit and a lot of a fit and they stay on the cover crop mainly
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.980]  But I've had to do some releases and I put out some brown late swing
[17:21.220 --> 17:25.360]  And we did a video on that which is pretty cool. They're voracious motherfuckers
[17:26.060 --> 17:30.620]  But that that I'm dealing with that right now and they're still around and they're here
[17:30.620 --> 17:34.580]  They're not like any huge volume or pressure at this point, but
[17:35.700 --> 17:39.660]  You know, there was clearly an imbalance to happen, but I get the winter and like things
[17:40.380 --> 17:46.060]  Once I fight off the initial fall like things try and get somewhere fucking warm
[17:46.980 --> 17:51.340]  It's it's like it's clean sailing up until fucking you know
[17:51.340 --> 17:54.880]  March up until that point in time unless I have other stuff come in
[17:55.880 --> 18:02.120]  Pretty well balanced and then it seems like I got my plants go in there into the flower tent
[18:02.120 --> 18:04.500]  and then I have like a pretty heavy level of like
[18:05.120 --> 18:08.200]  Predatory pests in there like like crazy my like all
[18:08.800 --> 18:10.800]  large population of rover beetles
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.600]  Also, so when that when that soil comes back around and gets back into the greenhouse into these pots
[18:15.600 --> 18:20.440]  I feel like I've like souped it up with some predator and then like brought it back
[18:21.320 --> 18:24.900]  But shit happens man life life goes sideways, you know
[18:26.080 --> 18:32.320]  It's even more tough. It's even more tough here, you know, because you know, we have like the most
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.480]  We're either like number one or number one and a half or something like that
[18:36.480 --> 18:42.840]  But we got the most diverse plant population on planet Earth here in this little San Diego little zone more plants
[18:43.480 --> 18:45.280]  From around the world
[18:45.280 --> 18:50.600]  Will live here and thrive here more so than anywhere else on the planet like we get a more variety of that
[18:50.600 --> 18:57.520]  It's like the sweet spot for climate exactly exactly. So that's also the case like with different insects, right?
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.040]  So we have like pressures from all over and then we have insects that don't have any predators
[19:02.200 --> 19:05.880]  Naturally like the Asian citrus psyllid and other things like that
[19:05.880 --> 19:12.960]  It just they those predators don't really exist here currently and there's nothing that really is taking that thing down at this moment
[19:12.960 --> 19:15.740]  we're waiting for nature to recalibrate and then like
[19:16.680 --> 19:22.200]  You know you you throw in like bad water and then you know people who you know
[19:22.200 --> 19:29.240]  Don't really have a lot of you know, know how or or time they you you're you're gonna be battling stuff for the rest of your life
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.840]  There's never really a little point here
[19:30.840 --> 19:36.400]  You know what? I mean? It's stuff that's balanced. So like the best thing to do is to like up your up your fungal
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.880]  You know your bark chip zones your fungal capabilities. You're getting good minerals
[19:42.640 --> 19:48.360]  You're not feeding things that are really powerful and strong and like given Joel to things all the time because
[19:48.880 --> 19:53.040]  Sucking insects pick on plants that have you know out of balance sap fluids, you know
[19:53.040 --> 19:59.160]  So if you do like sap analysis testing and stuff like that the sugars and the content and the nitrogen all these different things are
[19:59.480 --> 20:01.240]  regulated in the sap and
[20:01.240 --> 20:04.880]  If it's out if it's a little high on one side or the other you're all sudden
[20:04.880 --> 20:07.720]  You'll start calling in different different sucking bugs and things like that
[20:07.720 --> 20:15.360]  So like when you're pushing plants extra hard by feeding them too often or other things like that, you're encouraging poor cell development
[20:16.240 --> 20:22.000]  Because you're not allowing the fungi and the organisms around you to kind of to kind of do your thing and protect and feed it
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.480]  The ratios that it needs so its ratios are off and then it's getting picked on and because it doesn't have those good
[20:27.480 --> 20:28.120]  You know
[20:28.120 --> 20:31.800]  relationships happening the cells that build the plant are thin walled and
[20:32.080 --> 20:37.160]  Easier sucked on by those sucking bugs like aphids and scale and all those other things
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.160]  so it's like
[20:39.200 --> 20:41.680]  those trees the best thing you can kind of do is
[20:42.400 --> 20:46.040]  You know almost less, you know in a weird way, you know
[20:46.040 --> 20:52.000]  It's like you gotta you gotta allow them to kind of function on their own and give them give them a good
[20:52.240 --> 20:57.800]  Environment so that they can start cycling their own nutrients and give them things like composts and worm castings that are
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.200]  Not very powerful and strong but our plant ready and you know build up their immune system in other words
[21:04.360 --> 21:10.400]  Yeah, and in time of year feeding and stuff are a big thing like you don't want to do things at certain times because you're
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.240]  Gonna encourage certain things
[21:12.240 --> 21:17.120]  I mean, there's all kinds of stuff, but we'll never learn the end all the intricacies
[21:17.120 --> 21:22.520]  You know what? I mean on how to outrun them and how it's always changing. We're gonna fucking try I'll tell you what
[21:26.920 --> 21:28.920]  And we would just want to control it
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.920]  Right
[21:31.120 --> 21:33.120]  No, you know, it's
[21:33.120 --> 21:36.560]  Everybody wants to eat. We all get families to feed. We all got to do our jobs
[21:36.560 --> 21:38.840]  We all gotta find a way and we're all gonna do what it takes
[21:39.200 --> 21:44.880]  To make that happen and the insects and the predators and the little microbes all that shits no different
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.240]  You know what? I mean when it comes down to it
[21:46.240 --> 21:52.120]  So everybody's gonna be fighting and battling and you're going here and you're gonna go here and sometimes we might be up and other times
[21:52.120 --> 21:57.080]  You're not but it's just like yeah work on having a healthy rhizosphere gut bacteria, you know
[21:57.080 --> 22:01.720]  And you're gonna have you know a better chance at fighting those things and like that lemon tree
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.880]  It it doesn't have any bark chips under it. It's it's just sitting there. It's been it's you know, probably vulnerable
[22:08.480 --> 22:13.960]  You know, you know liquids and other things and funny things going on with it. It's just yeah, you don't you know
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.960]  It's not something that
[22:16.120 --> 22:21.840]  Is ideal for its rhizosphere, so it's getting picked on by sucking insects. It's no surprise, you know, so
[22:22.640 --> 22:25.800]  Hey, can I show my plants real quick so I can shut my lights off?
[22:27.200 --> 22:29.200]  Okay
[22:29.200 --> 22:35.720]  Cory if you want to shoot I totally forgot to mess you my apologies if next week next time you want to shoot a video
[22:35.840 --> 22:38.160]  And then just send it to me
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.560]  We can we can make sure that it's there so you don't have to fuck around too much if that's a little bit easier. I
[22:45.200 --> 22:46.520]  And that's that's cool
[22:46.520 --> 22:47.560]  I may take you up on that
[22:47.560 --> 22:52.920]  The thing is is I usually have my lights go out at 10 and they start getting saggy and droopy as you know
[22:52.960 --> 22:59.040]  So I just kind of wanted to and plus two I got this one and maybe somebody here can help me with it
[22:59.040 --> 23:03.560]  But so obviously they're kind of all saggy droopy, but they're all looking fantastic
[23:04.880 --> 23:07.040]  as far as you know the leaves and
[23:07.800 --> 23:15.220]  Trying to really slow your camera a little bit and if you could I just want to get to this one. I'm sorry London
[23:15.220 --> 23:21.040]  I'll focus in on this one real strong. But this is driving me nuts. This plant is just getting worse and worse
[23:21.040 --> 23:23.040]  I've potted it. I
[23:23.880 --> 23:27.240]  Just don't know what the story is with it. Can you see how it's like?
[23:28.600 --> 23:32.200]  Like clarine you okay. How is it being watered?
[23:34.360 --> 23:36.920]  As far as like how often or
[23:37.560 --> 23:40.800]  How often is it being watered on the drip table?
[23:40.800 --> 23:46.960]  Like is it being flooded on a table or is that table just serving the purpose of just holding the plant? I
[23:47.960 --> 23:49.960]  I
[23:50.680 --> 23:52.680]  Hand water it. Is that what you're saying?
[23:52.960 --> 23:59.960]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, um, I would just repot it in something with more with more
[24:00.480 --> 24:01.800]  porous
[24:01.800 --> 24:07.120]  material like like I would literally just add a ton of cocoa and
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.520]  perlite
[24:10.520 --> 24:12.000]  and
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  You don't know
[24:14.040 --> 24:20.200]  Plant is going all sorts of weird like it's got hooking on one side. It's got super flat leaf on the other
[24:21.440 --> 24:23.440]  That's what I'm saying. Like some
[24:26.040 --> 24:30.320]  The front left like at the same stage point is isn't hooked at all
[24:31.360 --> 24:34.480]  You've done any like any like
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.760]  Like spraying or feeding with liquid liquid stuff or anything like that
[24:39.760 --> 24:47.640]  Like when when things clawed downward you get like nitrogen toxicity, you know, sometimes in some cases sometimes you we spray things
[24:47.640 --> 24:54.360]  You start getting those kind of warbled up leaves as they're trying to develop. They get misshapen. I haven't done any kind of I
[24:55.160 --> 25:02.200]  Haven't done anything foliar on these and I haven't done anything as far as feeding and watering
[25:02.560 --> 25:05.160]  different from any of the other plants
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.920]  Has it been in that position most of the time in the tent like is it usually been right there in that center spot
[25:12.280 --> 25:18.520]  No, I've moved them all over and and like last to last episode
[25:18.520 --> 25:22.500]  I was starting to notice that claw ring and it looked like it was coming out of it
[25:22.560 --> 25:25.720]  but then it started looking weird again, so I up parted it and
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.400]  You know thought that that might help all it did was send it into a frenzy
[25:33.400 --> 25:35.400]  Wow
[25:35.400 --> 25:37.880]  Yeah, it almost like it almost looks like a root
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.800]  Like I see clawing like that can happen sometimes if like one side of the pots really cold
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.880]  Or like there's you know what? I mean? Like it's um, it's like
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.480]  And you're feeding in the way. I don't know you got but I've seen
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.980]  You got any loops or anything funny to look at the leaves on the on the veins or anything for?
[25:59.420 --> 26:02.100]  Yeah, you haven't spotted spider mites or anything like that
[26:02.100 --> 26:07.220]  I I'm all over the plants for that stuff too, especially we seeing stuff like this
[26:07.220 --> 26:09.900]  I haven't seen anything and I've gone so far as
[26:12.100 --> 26:13.540]  Using the microscope
[26:13.540 --> 26:20.300]  What's the what's the soil like? I mean, there's the soil like, you know, is it is it spongy? Is it wet? Is it?
[26:21.140 --> 26:23.140]  Is it good?
[26:24.020 --> 26:30.220]  Like what it's pretty dry it could be I'd say it's on the drier side if anything
[26:31.620 --> 26:35.860]  You know, I try not to go super heavy on the watering your fingers
[26:35.860 --> 26:38.980]  They're on your camera lens a little bit. I don't know. I mean, I
[26:39.620 --> 26:42.700]  guess I guess I'd have more problem with it if
[26:44.300 --> 26:49.740]  Somebody was more than one plant. Yeah, you know what I mean? I don't see any of that on I
[26:50.540 --> 26:52.060]  Still got you guys
[26:52.060 --> 26:53.980]  Yeah, I lose you when I go in my tent
[26:53.980 --> 27:00.620]  My problem is I think I think my problem with all of this is is that it's the only one and I'm doing everything
[27:01.140 --> 27:04.980]  Exactly the same to all the rest of them, you know, and I
[27:05.940 --> 27:07.260]  Don't know
[27:07.260 --> 27:13.540]  You're doing a good job. Don't don't beat yourself up. This shit happens to all of us. We all do
[27:14.060 --> 27:17.900]  I may never get an answer for this, but it'll drive me nuts. Oh
[27:18.820 --> 27:20.820]  Yeah, I don't
[27:20.980 --> 27:26.300]  At least you have the balls to show up to everyone and so, you know, it happens to all of us
[27:29.900 --> 27:33.700]  I'm definitely not ashamed of it. I just want to figure it out if I could you know
[27:34.500 --> 27:40.020]  If it was me, I would take it out of the fabric pot and I put it in the hardwalled pot that way
[27:40.100 --> 27:44.980]  You know, it would hold on to the moisture better and we could kind of figure out if you know
[27:45.860 --> 27:48.380]  What's what the deal is cuz like that if it's
[27:49.220 --> 27:54.980]  If it's throwing those weird claws and the leaves look funny and there's no bugs on it like that
[27:54.980 --> 27:56.380]  And there's you know
[27:56.380 --> 27:59.100]  No foliars or sprays been done to it
[27:59.100 --> 28:03.340]  None of the other ones are having a having a hell of a time with it and that tells me it's something in the root
[28:03.340 --> 28:05.340]  System, right? Like it's something
[28:05.540 --> 28:12.380]  Something that the command center of that plant is messed up. You know what I mean in some aspects so like
[28:13.140 --> 28:18.660]  It's something happened to it is it like, you know, is it too dry or whatever?
[28:18.660 --> 28:24.900]  but you can you can you can bring back all the integrity to that to that rise of spirit by putting some walls on it and
[28:25.860 --> 28:30.060]  Keeping it, you know keeping it in an old-fashioned plastic pot to see if that does any difference
[28:30.060 --> 28:34.340]  But if it was me and it was looking all junky like that and I didn't have any answers for it
[28:34.340 --> 28:36.340]  I'd probably isolate the son of a bitch and
[28:36.700 --> 28:37.860]  And
[28:37.860 --> 28:39.860]  Figure out what was going on that way, you know
[28:39.860 --> 28:42.780]  I mean before before it got it got the boot, you know what I mean?
[28:42.780 --> 28:47.020]  Cuz that's it ain't cool and that's it that tells me something going on, you know
[28:47.540 --> 28:51.660]  Somewhere somewhere in control center, you know what I mean? That's control center problem
[28:51.660 --> 28:55.580]  I thought the same thing and I thought maybe up part and it would have helped and I you know
[28:55.980 --> 29:00.100]  Usually if I'm having a struggle in any way shape or form if I up part them
[29:00.580 --> 29:03.580]  Generally within a week or so I can try to get them back
[29:07.100 --> 29:13.200]  The roots look the roots looked all the same I mean I didn't notice anything crazy on it
[29:15.900 --> 29:20.100]  Sometimes I wish it was still in plastic so I could pull it and look at the roots but yeah
[29:24.420 --> 29:28.300]  So so I that just reminded me of
[29:29.420 --> 29:31.420]  What Tyler was saying?
[29:31.740 --> 29:36.300]  Made a lot of sense because that was the first thing that went through my mind was root rot or
[29:38.260 --> 29:40.860]  The plants either over watered or underwater
[29:41.380 --> 29:46.020]  The so that's why I responded saying make it be able to be drier
[29:46.300 --> 29:49.940]  But it could be that it's underwater and it's not holding
[29:50.060 --> 29:54.460]  But what you can do to figure out if it's root rot and it's over watered
[29:54.460 --> 29:57.260]  it's just pull the plant out of the container and
[29:57.420 --> 30:03.420]  Then just look at the bottom of the container and if it's brown and you see brown roots, there you go
[30:04.300 --> 30:10.180]  And like I it just occurred to me. I was like, this is the simplest thing ever like why not just
[30:10.900 --> 30:14.580]  Do it that way, you know figure out the solution right there
[30:15.380 --> 30:17.380]  But uh, that's my little
[30:19.300 --> 30:25.860]  Thing I just realized in the middle of him like speaking about that because yeah, I agree 100% on all that
[30:27.260 --> 30:29.140]  I
[30:29.140 --> 30:34.780]  Like that isolating that plant. I think that I think that's an excellent decision at this point. I really like
[30:35.740 --> 30:40.080]  something's not go not going right right there and regardless it's like
[30:41.740 --> 30:46.660]  You don't have to terminate it, you know, it's not killing no the plants just pissed off
[30:46.660 --> 30:49.140]  I mean if I could get it back, I'd love to do that
[30:53.100 --> 30:55.100]  For a man with too many plants
[31:00.300 --> 31:04.180]  God damn it. Cory you like he always hits the wrong buttons
[31:12.020 --> 31:14.020]  There he is welcome back
[31:14.420 --> 31:15.940]  Hey
[31:15.940 --> 31:17.940]  At least once an episode
[31:18.340 --> 31:23.840]  Please at least once at least at least once before the episode and then once during the episode
[31:23.840 --> 31:25.840]  I'll do it a bunch of times
[31:30.740 --> 31:37.560]  So why what what's your hate for fabric pots there mr. Trees
[31:42.380 --> 31:47.260]  Properly and they knew that so they started lying them with a plastic liner
[31:51.500 --> 31:54.900]  They don't hold themselves up they're structurally unsound
[31:55.620 --> 32:01.820]  You can't slide a pot a plant in and out of them very easily without fucking doing this whole
[32:02.420 --> 32:05.980]  Hipscop dance thing and having weird tools that you don't need
[32:07.940 --> 32:09.940]  They
[32:10.460 --> 32:13.940]  Yeah, every time I put something in a fabric pot I really you know
[32:14.980 --> 32:17.700]  Really just like it pisses you off by the end of it. Yeah
[32:17.700 --> 32:21.900]  I always regret it. I've never had a good time. Yeah, like God through
[32:21.900 --> 32:25.540]  I have all my old fabric pots are outside and they got vegetables in them
[32:25.540 --> 32:28.980]  But I took a saran wrap and I wrapped the outside with plastic
[32:36.980 --> 32:43.380]  Made plastic I I have a I that's how I roll, you know, that's that's the way it should be
[32:43.380 --> 32:48.620]  You know, I have a solution for fabric pots. It's basically
[32:49.500 --> 32:51.340]  Excuse me
[32:51.340 --> 32:53.540]  Use them once and throw them the fuck away
[32:54.340 --> 32:56.340]  That's basically how usable they are
[32:56.860 --> 33:03.100]  I like using them. Um, they're very cheap if you go on Amazon and you buy both fabric
[33:03.620 --> 33:09.180]  They're cheaper than buying the plastic pots. I mean I used to do commercial and those little six-inch pots
[33:09.180 --> 33:13.580]  I mean you could do four per square foot and you could easily end up with 400 in a room and
[33:13.820 --> 33:18.100]  that would easily end up over a thousand dollars for these containers and
[33:18.620 --> 33:20.620]  it's like
[33:21.020 --> 33:23.020]  The fabric containers
[33:23.020 --> 33:27.380]  especially going and upsizing and doing larger plants you can do a lot less and
[33:28.420 --> 33:31.820]  And so it is good, but it's like yeah
[33:31.980 --> 33:37.980]  They do dry out really quick. And then what you end up with is where you end up with that night like
[33:38.980 --> 33:41.980]  Basically cannabis eats a lot of nitrogen really fast and
[33:42.620 --> 33:48.420]  So it but it doesn't eat all the phosphorus and potassium and then it ends up with this lockout
[33:48.860 --> 33:51.620]  where you start to see it where
[33:52.300 --> 33:55.100]  towards the end of it drying out it starts to
[33:56.580 --> 33:58.580]  Look like it's overfed and
[33:58.780 --> 34:04.100]  So then people do all sorts of things to try to fix this problem. The reality is all you need to do is just flush
[34:05.220 --> 34:06.980]  and
[34:06.980 --> 34:08.980]  I just see that a lot and
[34:09.780 --> 34:17.700]  that's just something that I've been really well aware of on top of the the pots tend to hold the salts on
[34:18.100 --> 34:22.420]  The outside and you'll see like white on the outside of the containers
[34:22.420 --> 34:26.900]  and that's just the salts that have just dried out on the outside of the container and
[34:27.260 --> 34:31.900]  And frankly on top of that for IPM purposes, you know
[34:32.180 --> 34:40.140]  The whole idea that you could be transferring insects from one grow to another it's like it's not worth a $1 and
[34:40.140 --> 34:41.900]  something
[34:41.900 --> 34:43.300]  spent
[34:43.300 --> 34:50.860]  So I think they are they have a place but I think they are kind of like something that you you really can't rely on
[34:52.620 --> 34:58.700]  Yeah, I like to saying yeah the use treat them as disposable items that that's it every week
[34:58.700 --> 35:00.980]  This is going the same for me, you know
[35:03.620 --> 35:07.820]  Every week this goes the same with me. It's like hey, you know, I do my whole cloning thing
[35:07.820 --> 35:09.340]  It's like I put all this stuff in the water
[35:09.340 --> 35:13.580]  It's like now you got to put it in the fucking water like just fucking water
[35:13.580 --> 35:20.260]  And then this week it's like, you know every like just just I wanted to highlight this while you were shit-talking fabric pots
[35:22.500 --> 35:24.500]  How many fabric pots
[35:24.500 --> 35:26.500]  There
[35:26.740 --> 35:32.940]  I'll give a free pack of seeds to a to whoever can get the number right because you're not going to there's a lot
[35:35.220 --> 35:40.060]  No fucking pots in pots on pots round pots
[35:42.940 --> 35:46.220]  Those are cannabis cannabis pots, you know what I mean?
[35:46.220 --> 35:53.140]  Like that is like cannabis growers and cannabis people have adopted this air this air pruning and these these fabric pots
[35:53.140 --> 35:57.820]  Like really really more so than any other, you know industry, you know out there
[35:58.540 --> 36:05.140]  Most any nursery. I mean you go to Home Depot, you know, Bonnie plants are in those little plastic little plastic pots, right?
[36:05.140 --> 36:08.100]  You know, I mean like if it if it was really that much better
[36:08.300 --> 36:14.180]  You would see more plants and trees shipped around and sold in bags like that
[36:14.180 --> 36:16.980]  You know what? I mean, and you don't well, I mean
[36:17.340 --> 36:24.580]  It's not one of those things the root system on trees encased in a burlap sack typically upon shipping traditionally
[36:24.580 --> 36:27.020]  They used they used to keep them in burlap sacks
[36:27.020 --> 36:30.180]  And I still have a nursery here here right down the road for me
[36:30.180 --> 36:35.060]  That's old-fashioned like that and they keep all their citrus and burlap sacks and let me tell you that sucks ass
[36:36.620 --> 36:42.060]  Like planning them and dealing with that and they degrade and fall apart in my hand
[36:42.060 --> 36:46.380]  I've had more root balls fall apart in my hands from those burlap wrap things that are just too old
[36:46.940 --> 36:51.700]  Like there's a million things that this wrong with that in every aspect of the game. I
[36:52.660 --> 36:57.520]  Personally have pots out there five gallon pots one gallon pots two gallon pots
[36:57.520 --> 37:04.740]  They're probably like 25 years old that I've used for like 20 25 years and and counting
[37:04.740 --> 37:09.300]  You know what? I mean? Like I can no bullshit, you know, I mean more tons more
[37:09.300 --> 37:09.620]  Where are you?
[37:09.620 --> 37:10.500]  Where do you get these?
[37:10.500 --> 37:16.740]  Where do you get these pots cuz that's that's kind of thing is is the pots that I get that are plastic from my store
[37:16.740 --> 37:19.420]  Like they're fucking terrible. They just
[37:19.940 --> 37:22.100]  Right away, like yeah, they don't make it
[37:22.900 --> 37:28.460]  Even know but even like the bigger ones like they're just shit the better parts are the are the fabrics
[37:32.580 --> 37:35.140]  Older than him got it from my grandpa
[37:35.140 --> 37:37.140]  You must have some old tools at home
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.660]  No, you're both wrong there's more than that
[37:49.980 --> 37:55.520]  69 87 is not the correct question their answer
[37:56.800 --> 38:00.120]  So what you know what I'll do is I'll take a minute here because I think this is important
[38:00.120 --> 38:04.240]  And I've been pushing this out a little bit lately check out the unicorn cup
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.920]  When I got them at when when these were plants at the nursery that I worked at when I was a youngster
[38:10.920 --> 38:18.840]  I was like 20 these thing these two pots right here have probably been around for I haven't worked at the nursery for
[38:19.360 --> 38:21.840]  10 years and I got these
[38:22.880 --> 38:26.160]  Like I don't know probably like the first couple years of my life
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.280]  I've been using these pots and I've been using them for like a year and a half
[38:31.280 --> 38:33.560]  But not one of them is cracked or broken
[38:45.960 --> 38:47.960]  You got to get rid of that now
[39:00.280 --> 39:02.280]  I
[39:02.280 --> 39:05.760]  Mean more years at least God, but it's still
[39:06.280 --> 39:09.880]  You know it's still stronger and will stand up better than that damn fabric pot
[39:09.880 --> 39:16.520]  And I'll use it before I use a fabric pot you know so it's just interesting. You know I don't I don't care about
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.000]  My dad always said the best tool in the toolbox is the one that works for you that you know how to use
[39:24.480 --> 39:27.340]  You know I mean and some people grow dank weed
[39:27.340 --> 39:31.860]  I mean, I've probably smoked tons of dank weed that were grown in fabric pots. You know I mean, that's not that
[39:31.860 --> 39:35.740]  I don't think the pots gonna depend on the success of dank weed
[39:35.740 --> 39:39.600]  I think yeah, it's like more the grower. You know at that point, and it's like
[39:40.300 --> 39:47.420]  But if they just make my job harder as a grower at in general it makes things harder to transplant
[39:47.660 --> 39:54.100]  Makes things harder to water makes things harder to feed makes things harder to like stack up next to each other
[39:54.100 --> 39:58.980]  It just makes things harder, so I just don't use that I can throw I can carry friggin 10 plastic pots
[39:58.980 --> 40:03.540]  I can put them all my fingertips like little one gallons and carry like three or four at a time
[40:03.860 --> 40:08.820]  You know I mean like really get through without anything structure, and yeah, you got that square boy. You know what's up?
[40:09.460 --> 40:15.220]  But that looks harder for me. You know so I don't I don't use them for I don't I don't pay them
[40:15.220 --> 40:19.220]  I'll use them if I have like them lying around or if I need something in an emergency, but
[40:20.060 --> 40:22.060]  Shit, I'll go buy a plastic pot before that
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.580]  Sure these are
[40:24.580 --> 40:28.620]  15 this is 15 fucking years old look at this ball
[40:28.620 --> 40:33.780]  I finally I finally have to retire it after 15 fucking years, but
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.900]  Yeah
[40:35.900 --> 40:39.580]  The shit eventually does fall apart, but yeah, it happens
[40:39.700 --> 40:45.940]  It's always tragedy because you're like ah damn it there were three dollars and fifty cents a piece, and you gotta buy a lot
[40:48.300 --> 40:50.300]  Out of that
[40:52.060 --> 40:54.060]  Yeah
[40:55.340 --> 41:01.260]  Push it through another little put some tape around the rim tape that up another run
[41:05.700 --> 41:11.220]  You know it's it's to each his own you know I'm not I'm not here to throw shade on any of that stuff
[41:11.220 --> 41:17.540]  It's just over the over the years. I really know I'm in salt nurseries, and no you made good points
[41:18.020 --> 41:24.660]  They're all good points you can't pick the bags up without everything falling apart really I mean unless the roots are in control completely you're gonna
[41:24.660 --> 41:29.940]  End up with a mess that makes a great point you definitely have to water a lot more with them
[41:29.940 --> 41:36.100]  So unless you're right on top of it. They're drying out a lot that I mean you make a lot of great points
[41:36.100 --> 41:42.020]  I I don't know why I like them. I just heard London. You're doing it wrong I
[41:43.020 --> 41:46.180]  Hear that every day anyways no matter what I do
[41:50.060 --> 41:52.220]  Why are people telling you that I'm doing it wrong
[41:58.300 --> 42:04.220]  Stuff can't go through the bottom right they don't have the holes in the bottom so that more insects and root dwelling
[42:04.300 --> 42:08.200]  Insects can't like sneak up through and like have little houses under there
[42:08.320 --> 42:11.360]  You're like you know your battle and stuff like that every once in a while
[42:11.360 --> 42:18.360]  I'll throw a plastic pot inside a fabric pot to seal off the bottom for a fungus net control if I have like a fungus
[42:18.360 --> 42:19.800]  net outbreak
[42:19.800 --> 42:22.900]  I'll use them for that you know what I mean, or I'll bag the bottom
[42:25.040 --> 42:27.680]  So basically they're part of your IPM only
[42:28.680 --> 42:30.680]  Every
[42:30.680 --> 42:36.280]  Tool is usable. It's just you know what works for you. We were discussing IPM last week
[42:37.200 --> 42:41.800]  And I was discussing using a perlite as like a liner
[42:42.920 --> 42:44.920]  to prevent fungus nets
[42:46.280 --> 42:49.600]  Because when they try to go in it it breaks their
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.080]  Exoskeletons up and it breaks their
[42:54.200 --> 43:01.000]  Exoskeletons up and it screws them up and for whatever reason it really actually works because it's like glass
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.960]  it's like if someone was walking on like a whole bunch of glass shards and
[43:06.840 --> 43:08.840]  We also discussed
[43:10.080 --> 43:12.080]  This was interesting of painting
[43:13.280 --> 43:15.280]  the stems of
[43:16.160 --> 43:18.000]  the
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  the plants and
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.120]  The plants and
[43:22.160 --> 43:27.760]  This is really interesting because I went and talked to my farming family, and then I also looked it up on the internet
[43:28.080 --> 43:30.360]  We're both right and we're both wrong
[43:30.920 --> 43:37.320]  In a way, I don't know how this hell that was happened. I went down this rabbit hole of
[43:38.640 --> 43:46.720]  Internet bullshit and with my family and all the farmers that I'm related to they basically told me this
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.240]  They so they run like a few thousand acres of farmland and
[43:51.800 --> 43:56.040]  They said that they do the painting on the plants
[43:57.120 --> 43:59.440]  for for ants and for
[44:00.320 --> 44:02.320]  rat and iguana
[44:03.400 --> 44:07.880]  Prevention, but then I've heard other people say that they only paint the
[44:08.680 --> 44:12.520]  Plants just to make them look pretty especially in tourist areas
[44:12.680 --> 44:20.120]  And that it doesn't help with rat rat and iguana for that for prevention the whole point of it is if a rat eats
[44:20.680 --> 44:22.680]  a piece of like a
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.600]  Banana, you can't like people would try to cut off the piece of a banana
[44:28.360 --> 44:30.120]  To try to make it clean
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.760]  But because it wicks up the bacteria or virus because you know, it's it's a plant
[44:35.760 --> 44:37.760]  It's a wick it naturally wicks everything
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.680]  People would still get sick and so they thought that they could do that. They also tried to wrap plants in aluminum
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.520]  like metal like flashing
[44:47.320 --> 44:49.320]  and
[44:49.360 --> 44:51.360]  So it became a and
[44:51.920 --> 44:53.920]  It was for what you said
[44:54.800 --> 44:58.480]  Tyler you were very correct. They did do it. They told me for
[44:59.160 --> 45:04.240]  anti-desiccation properties for the for the stems and then they also
[45:04.360 --> 45:08.160]  Some of them thought it was good for anti pest
[45:09.040 --> 45:12.560]  applications and then they also did it for just vanity and
[45:13.120 --> 45:18.400]  It was kind of funny to just see like all these people that I talked to all been like no
[45:18.400 --> 45:22.880]  No, that's wrong. This is what it is. This is what it is. This is what it is and it's not
[45:22.880 --> 45:29.520]  Yeah, it's the tale of you ask you ask a thousand, you know people you're gonna get that whole, you know answer
[45:29.520 --> 45:31.520]  There's there is zero
[45:32.160 --> 45:33.400]  zero
[45:33.400 --> 45:35.920]  prevention of insects with that white
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.880]  Latex paint stuff an insect ant can crawl right up that no matter what color it is
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.760]  You're not stopping it from crawling up that trunk. You're not stopping an iguana. You're not stopping a rat
[45:45.760 --> 45:50.800]  I've seen it I can show you countless evidence of that happening
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.480]  So like as for pest and prevention unless you're putting some sort of pesticide
[45:56.640 --> 46:04.560]  Unless you're putting some sort of pesticide inside of that so that if something eats the bark and it is discouraging or
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.040]  You know, it's a contact thing. There's zero pest effects from it at all
[46:09.480 --> 46:13.480]  Vandy for sure because people think that looks really sharp, especially in those desert zones
[46:13.480 --> 46:16.660]  They like get that like green that white stuff, but like
[46:17.680 --> 46:23.740]  100% it's sunscreen. That's all it is white reflects light and those old those old friggin
[46:24.740 --> 46:30.420]  Aluminum, you know canisters those things people still try to deploy for rats and other things
[46:30.420 --> 46:32.660]  But I have I have cameras
[46:33.180 --> 46:37.380]  Watching rats and squirrels jump from like a six-foot standstill
[46:37.740 --> 46:42.300]  Into traps and up into trees and and do their thing and they find other ways
[46:42.540 --> 46:44.860]  But yeah, those little slick metal things are hard
[46:44.860 --> 46:47.700]  But then they create this micro climate inside
[46:47.900 --> 46:54.940]  Where the trunk is in between the middle and the thing which other insects and things kind of build their homes and it becomes too
[46:54.940 --> 46:58.700]  Moist and it becomes this whole other, you know problem, you know what I mean?
[46:58.700 --> 47:03.820]  When you start putting stuff on the trunk of the tree, so like right all you shouldn't put shit on the tree number one
[47:03.820 --> 47:08.620]  I mean on the trunk because the trunk needs to do its thing, but there's so many ways
[47:08.620 --> 47:14.980]  I mean so many funny things like I've heard people say so many things over the years like about what what those what they're doing
[47:14.980 --> 47:20.380]  And how they're painting them and all those other stuff, but the only thing it really works for is sunscreen
[47:20.420 --> 47:24.440]  That's it and to look good. Yeah, and that's the only thing it actually works for so
[47:24.900 --> 47:30.380]  It was a hilarious because the last person I talked to was my mom and she lived on a on a big farm
[47:30.380 --> 47:33.620]  And she was like what the fuck she was like hell no
[47:33.620 --> 47:38.460]  Yeah, people think it works to keep rats and stuff off of it, but it doesn't do jack shit
[47:38.460 --> 47:40.460]  They just use it to make it look pretty
[47:45.860 --> 47:47.700]  Have like all these like
[47:47.700 --> 47:50.500]  Crystalline, whatever I forget all the ingredients
[47:50.500 --> 47:55.700]  But there used to be some toxic ass ingredients and a lot of that stuff that they used to put into those into those paints
[47:55.700 --> 47:59.340]  And people used to paint their trees with it. You're painting with all this toxic ass shit
[47:59.460 --> 48:06.540]  So then some somebody I forget who it is, but somebody started making an organic water-based one specifically for
[48:07.260 --> 48:10.740]  fruit trees and it's like a tan color and it's
[48:11.140 --> 48:13.220]  Forget where it is, but it's like you mix it yourself
[48:13.500 --> 48:18.940]  and it's like all natural and nice and you can paint your tree for you know if it's got a bunch of sunburn problems and
[48:18.940 --> 48:24.620]  And that helps but it's hard to find you know it's hard to find any number one, and then it's number two
[48:24.620 --> 48:28.660]  It's just it's hard to find any real information about what it actually does
[48:29.780 --> 48:34.840]  With anything in farming you know that's that's it's all of us. You know playing around and doing our thing
[48:34.840 --> 48:37.740]  You know it's always something to learn. There's always something to try
[48:38.380 --> 48:40.380]  You know
[48:40.740 --> 48:42.740]  World
[48:43.300 --> 48:45.300]  You know these right here you see these
[48:45.900 --> 48:47.900]  It's a loquat seed oh
[48:49.060 --> 48:53.060]  Yeah, oh look at that loquat popping out of its out of its skin
[48:53.700 --> 48:55.140]  this one
[48:55.140 --> 48:57.980]  How long have you been working on germinating those?
[49:00.860 --> 49:02.860]  About two weeks
[49:03.060 --> 49:05.060]  That's pretty big yeah
[49:06.060 --> 49:11.780]  Because I know some apple and some other seeds can take a really epically long time like you got like cold
[49:12.180 --> 49:15.580]  Put them in the fridge for a month and stuff like that. Yeah
[49:16.900 --> 49:21.700]  Will take a lot longer like things that actually need a chill time or a rest time a rest period
[49:22.020 --> 49:26.820]  Those things take really you know you they need a little bit of time to settle in you know whether they get
[49:27.060 --> 49:29.780]  Refrigerated or cold or not they still need to rest
[49:30.380 --> 49:34.180]  but like tropical plants like friggin mangoes and
[49:35.060 --> 49:36.900]  friggin loquat
[49:36.900 --> 49:42.300]  Avocado things that like don't freeze you know what I mean to stay going all the time all you need is a really
[49:42.620 --> 49:47.600]  Really nice ripe fruit. That's fully mature and you can take that seed out and dry it out
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.020]  You know within a week or two germinate it, and it will pop you know what I mean
[49:52.020 --> 49:57.220]  It'll it'll do its thing like right away, which is way cool same thing with cannabis. There's some cannabis. That's
[49:57.740 --> 50:02.540]  You know the equatorial stuff will friggin pop inside the inside the bud on the plant
[50:02.540 --> 50:04.540]  Actually friggin do that
[50:04.540 --> 50:07.420]  Nuts and then I've seen some of those around
[50:07.980 --> 50:11.940]  Yeah, go ahead. I've said I've seen some of those photos pretty epic
[50:12.220 --> 50:20.180]  Yeah, and that yeah, and that's those are those are normally like equatorial sativa type type plants or plants that don't
[50:20.700 --> 50:24.460]  Come from a colder region per se you know what I mean
[50:24.460 --> 50:29.740]  You know in there in their lineage you know and the ones that do they come from different places those other things they need more
[50:29.740 --> 50:31.740]  of that that fridge time
[50:31.860 --> 50:37.260]  Or to sit around in the in the cooler or dry it out for a month or two a few months before you can actually
[50:37.340 --> 50:39.840]  You know get a good germ rate on them. You know
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.980]  Germ rate will go up on some over time some the germ rates great right away, and we'll go down
[50:44.980 --> 50:49.060]  You know as the longer it sits you know what I mean, so it's really kind of strange
[50:49.380 --> 50:53.460]  So with all plants I kind of you know I kind of adopted
[50:53.460 --> 50:59.100]  I've got some honey crisp apple seeds, and I'm gonna germinate this year. They've been in the fridge for the last six weeks
[50:59.100 --> 51:04.940]  They'll be in another couple weeks, and then I'll take those out and I'll germinate those and hopefully they'll go that way
[51:06.100 --> 51:08.100]  But whenever I don't don't
[51:08.220 --> 51:14.460]  You know wait on an apple or get an apple seed cold. They don't like they don't like to come up as easy
[51:14.460 --> 51:16.460]  You know some will yeah
[51:18.460 --> 51:21.700]  I've been trying to pop I gotta look it up
[51:23.900 --> 51:25.580]  It's like
[51:25.580 --> 51:28.940]  I gotta look up in a minute in some sort of a vine
[51:28.940 --> 51:34.340]  But it needs like some coal for the cold time as well, and it was just like I've tried three times so far
[51:34.340 --> 51:36.220]  I'm like I gotta I gotta go again
[51:36.220 --> 51:40.860]  Try again, and I think I'm just like being impatient. You know and then sometimes I put stuff down
[51:40.860 --> 51:44.580]  It's just like and go and like you just just don't care
[51:45.340 --> 51:47.340]  It's you know
[51:51.220 --> 51:54.620]  Take it super easy, what are you smoking on today Corey you look like you
[51:55.340 --> 51:57.340]  Rolled up
[51:57.540 --> 52:01.000]  I am smoking. This is juice box which is
[52:01.740 --> 52:05.820]  From James loud. It's gelato 41 by white runs
[52:06.940 --> 52:07.980]  and
[52:07.980 --> 52:13.420]  It's it's dry, but not cured, but I kind of like it a little bit tacky like that
[52:13.420 --> 52:19.660]  So I can't seem to put it down. I keep smoking on it because it's got that nice fresh sticky flavor. Yeah, sorry
[52:26.890 --> 52:28.890]  Hang on my lighter
[52:31.650 --> 52:33.650]  Terrible
[52:34.410 --> 52:36.410]  So don't mind me if I'm in my own world
[52:42.090 --> 52:44.090]  So how's the chat doing today?
[52:44.210 --> 52:50.010]  We're having a fun time so where you got like I I've got clones cut. I'm gonna. I'm probably like I
[52:51.010 --> 52:53.010]  Don't know I should have
[52:53.450 --> 52:56.770]  Sex I think I have sex, but I don't know if I have sex
[52:56.770 --> 53:02.210]  You know I'm probably about three weeks before I'm like really really really confident on it
[53:03.130 --> 53:10.330]  Before I see before you know I'm not gonna rush it if I find a really good man. You know I'll keep them around
[53:12.290 --> 53:18.090]  My house is full of women. It's like I got I got I got my wife two daughters
[53:19.090 --> 53:23.450]  My and then upstairs my dad was lives with my stepmom and my
[53:24.730 --> 53:27.810]  And and my little sister, so it's like it's all girls
[53:28.570 --> 53:30.050]  It's just a lot more of them
[53:30.050 --> 53:34.930]  So I like I got to keep a couple stud males around once in a while, and you know kick it
[53:38.370 --> 53:42.650]  I'm so nice on a couple, but but not not on all of them
[53:42.970 --> 53:44.970]  I
[53:45.170 --> 53:48.410]  You know I'd like to get going on them, but
[53:49.290 --> 53:55.330]  You know I still haven't really I don't think I'm not in my opinion. I don't want to take clones off of yet
[53:55.330 --> 53:57.330]  I don't think they're quite big enough
[53:57.330 --> 54:01.530]  Yeah, minor minor actually doing pretty good. They're there in the front there
[54:03.330 --> 54:05.210]  You can see it really well
[54:05.210 --> 54:10.210]  Let's see I need to get my longer cords so that I can reach it because I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
[54:10.210 --> 54:11.690]  Make it all the way there
[54:11.690 --> 54:14.090]  You flower in three gallon too, don't you?
[54:14.770 --> 54:16.770]  Yeah, I go all the way through
[54:20.090 --> 54:22.090]  Can you see me okay there
[54:26.610 --> 54:29.690]  So these are his one two three four
[54:30.610 --> 54:34.290]  And you can see can you see down to the bottom of the plant on the screen?
[54:35.370 --> 54:39.770]  Yeah, how hard you get on it? Yeah, they're pretty big so they're like they're up to my waist here
[54:39.770 --> 54:45.570]  I've stripped most of the lowers out of most of them this one's got a little bit extra
[54:46.530 --> 54:50.130]  But they're doing really really well, and they're not they're not quite
[54:51.290 --> 54:54.570]  There yet. They're starting to smell this one looks
[54:55.930 --> 54:58.570]  Looks quite masculine, but we'll find out soon
[54:59.970 --> 55:04.250]  So I got one that looks it looks male this one. I really want to be female
[55:04.930 --> 55:09.130]  But again, we still have very even noting. It's not even doing the spacing on them yet
[55:10.770 --> 55:12.770]  These are still really even as well
[55:14.690 --> 55:16.690]  Those are nice and big
[55:17.690 --> 55:20.490]  Doing well these are only in two gallon pots
[55:21.730 --> 55:25.450]  And they probably won't ever go any larger than two gallon pot
[55:26.970 --> 55:28.970]  Because these will stay as mums
[55:29.530 --> 55:34.490]  For most of the time and then of course you see the hundreds of fabric pots that are all floating around me
[55:35.010 --> 55:36.890]  Which is a pain in the butt?
[55:36.890 --> 55:41.610]  Which is pretty good. I like this this plant over here. You see the big yellow flowers are
[55:42.130 --> 55:45.650]  That's rutabaga from last season then flowering out to seed
[55:46.290 --> 55:49.610]  Which is fun all sorts of cool stuff broccoli
[55:50.530 --> 55:52.530]  the Saras of Elvis guys
[55:53.330 --> 55:54.890]  I've got
[55:54.890 --> 55:56.890]  What is this?
[55:58.010 --> 56:00.010]  Acapulco golds going in
[56:01.090 --> 56:06.410]  These are actually the cross of lemon cush headband and a land raise aqua cocoa golds
[56:06.890 --> 56:11.950]  Which is good. I got a whole big-ass tomato to eat. I mean, I've been excited. It's been a good season so far
[56:11.950 --> 56:18.370]  I'm excited for it to be like cheerful and nice and and and maybe actually get some fucking Sun instead of them
[56:18.890 --> 56:22.150]  Wicked horrible grows rain that we've had the whole fucking
[56:22.810 --> 56:27.490]  Last little while has been just disgusting like this is the first it's made to for weekend
[56:27.490 --> 56:31.650]  and this is the first time I've been able to fucking open up my
[56:32.650 --> 56:38.170]  My greenhouse at all and so I'm gonna be able to leave it out tonight because it's not raining at all
[56:38.410 --> 56:44.690]  And everything get nice airflow and get like full Sun without a greenhouse cover on it and everything just just pops
[56:44.690 --> 56:51.330]  It just blows up got to bring everything out and put it spread it spread it out into the garden and to the other sides
[56:51.330 --> 56:57.370]  I've got way more tomatoes than I want. I've got like whole big tomatoes ready to pull off the vine right now
[56:57.370 --> 56:59.370]  Which is pretty sick
[56:59.730 --> 57:01.970]  You guys can see them because they're like ready to
[57:04.970 --> 57:06.970]  Crank it up. That's good
[57:07.050 --> 57:12.210]  You're on top of it, man. You're not doing anything wrong. So, you know, you're doing it, bro
[57:13.050 --> 57:15.050]  That's the that's the key
[57:17.530 --> 57:21.130]  You're doing it man, look at this big fucking thing
[57:29.370 --> 57:31.890]  I got a question for Tyler. Yo
[57:32.930 --> 57:34.810]  my wife
[57:34.810 --> 57:36.810]  Tries to grow
[57:37.050 --> 57:40.050]  San Marzano tomatoes every year and
[57:40.970 --> 57:44.730]  The damn hornworms keep getting at them
[57:45.210 --> 57:50.610]  How the hell because I don't do outdoor growing I do indoor. I've only ever done in door
[57:51.410 --> 57:55.610]  How the hell do you control hornworms on tomatoes?
[57:56.930 --> 57:58.930]  Because they are terrible out here
[57:59.370 --> 58:01.050]  alright, so
[58:01.050 --> 58:03.050]  Hornworms are a bitch. They
[58:03.530 --> 58:07.330]  Hide in the soil too. So like they're like hide in the soil and you know
[58:07.330 --> 58:12.410]  That's why you can't find them sometimes and all kinds of weird stuff. They'll get big and ugly and fun
[58:12.690 --> 58:16.210]  BT man, you got a spraying with BT if you're gonna spray him with anything
[58:16.210 --> 58:20.290]  You got a spray with okay, and that solves the problem right there. You know what I mean?
[58:20.290 --> 58:25.410]  I'll be done. They'll be done right there kills all worms safe to use all that stuff. Well, I do it once
[58:26.610 --> 58:28.610]  Yep
[58:29.370 --> 58:33.770]  Yep, you can get any BT for cheap anywhere on the planet, you know what I mean?
[58:33.770 --> 58:38.770]  Just use that that's done or you know, get your get your little tomatoes
[58:38.770 --> 58:43.650]  You know doing their thing and you can always use my mosquito net, you know tactics
[58:43.650 --> 58:44.050]  You know what?
[58:44.050 --> 58:46.050]  I mean where you put them in a little mosquito net
[58:46.290 --> 58:50.930]  Tunnel and then it keeps the moths from flying because the worms come from moths man
[58:50.930 --> 58:55.110]  So all worms are like moth larvae, you know or butterfly larvae
[58:55.110 --> 59:00.590]  So they're flying in and they're visiting your plants and laying the eggs and you know
[59:00.590 --> 59:03.110]  And then they're hatching and doing their thing
[59:03.110 --> 59:06.990]  So if you eliminate them to be able to touch your plants, you know what I mean?
[59:06.990 --> 59:08.990]  That that solves a lot of the problems too
[59:09.110 --> 59:14.510]  But things like tomatoes need some pollination help and other things so screen them off too early can be a problem
[59:14.510 --> 59:15.430]  You know what I mean?
[59:15.430 --> 59:21.290]  But if you've got big tomatoes and you got tomatoes that are already set on there and you can set up a little green hut
[59:21.290 --> 59:24.950]  You don't have to spray them with nothing. You can get your tomatoes to the end, you know, no problem
[59:25.470 --> 59:27.790]  But if you just spraying with BT and do nothing else
[59:28.430 --> 59:29.870]  Solves the problem
[59:29.870 --> 59:34.030]  They're basically saying just have a greenhouse and get rid of all the bullshit
[59:44.070 --> 59:47.910]  But yeah, I'll get spend ten bucks get some BT and
[59:48.830 --> 59:54.070]  Friggin spray those things once or twice and you're and you'll never have that problem, you know you end up
[59:54.950 --> 59:58.790]  I have experience with BT and BS
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:06.030]  people might not know but still asparagus and then the syllabus their engen justice
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:12.030]  those are chemicals that are derived from bacteria that eat the gut of
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.070]  the insects and
[01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:17.830]  I used to actually
[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:21.630]  Run massive contracts for like thousands of acres
[01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:28.070]  For the federal government applying those things so I know exactly what you're talking about and
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:34.910]  It's it's funny that that that you actually mentioned that because I never thought of that as a as a useful application
[01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:42.270]  Cannabis because it was or even made it is because the man, you know, there's always to me something is used to kill
[01:00:44.590 --> 01:00:50.070]  Basically pests like mosquitoes and stuff because that's what they typically utilize it for
[01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.350]  You know done yeah all kinds of
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:59.030]  Bacillus species like that in there, but yeah like for tomatoes like I don't like you
[01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.550]  I mean you can use it on cannabis and people have been doing it for years
[01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:07.070]  I've done it, you know hundreds of times, you know, but I don't like spraying my cannabis with with BT even though you could
[01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:10.870]  That's why I always do my my my screen technique
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.150]  You know
[01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:16.910]  I mean I use the mosquito netting or or a hoop house type situation where I can kind of screen off the moths and then I
[01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:22.790]  Don't have to spray them with anything because cannabis doesn't need a pollinator from a from a bee or somebody to make it do its thing
[01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:23.430]  You know what? I mean?
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:30.110]  So I don't need any outside help so I can screen those SOBs off early and they don't have any bug traffic at all
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:32.150]  I don't have any balance to spray them or do nothing
[01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.010]  You know what? I mean, which is nice but BT shit
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:40.870]  If you got a too big of a plant can't screen off or you don't want to do that. You just spray with BT
[01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.310]  You're good to go
[01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:49.110]  Especially for tomato that's that's easy. That's good. I work really good solve your problem. Well, thank you. That's a good piece of information
[01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.870]  How long does the BT last folia?
[01:01:54.710 --> 01:02:00.470]  It depends on how hot it is and if it's really moist out my conditions outside I'd say, you know
[01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:05.910]  Somewhere between 10 and 30 days. Okay, you know somewhere in there. Okay, okay
[01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:11.790]  I think I've seen it only last two to three days in applications and large-scale applications
[01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:17.950]  But I guess it's probably the dosage. Yeah dose it like do do
[01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.590]  heat like like
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.930]  moisture content like all these different things when
[01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:28.030]  No, if you're knocking down whatever you're knocking down it could last 30 days
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:31.470]  But you need to apply it only lasts living for two. I follow
[01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:36.630]  I think I got a handle on what you guys are saying that makes sense. It'll tell you too on the bottle
[01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:37.550]  I don't have a bottle handy
[01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.630]  Anymore but like it'll tell you on the bottle like you do it every two weeks or you know
[01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.830]  This will last 30 days at this ratio and stuff like that
[01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:47.270]  You know what?
[01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:53.070]  I mean it must depend on what you're trying to fight to exactly and with cannabis and other things some things like sometimes you got
[01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:56.350]  To go like he said it might not last more than two or three days a week
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:00.830]  If you did it every week, you know what I mean? It might it might tuck her up and also like
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:05.550]  Like those biological type sprays all kinds of you know
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:11.030]  BT spin a set any other bacillus all those things that are just those biologicals when they are
[01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.870]  Kept in like like hot and cold conditions
[01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.270]  Like if it's sitting in an old hot shed
[01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:22.810]  It loses potency if it's really really cold like those types of conditions where the temperature fluctuates
[01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:27.390]  That's gonna affect your potency too. So it might only last two days if it's a real old bottle, right?
[01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.070]  But if you got a fresh bottle and it's like stored at room temperature
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:37.390]  Consistently, you know what? I mean? And you're in like, you know a dry ish climate
[01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.390]  You might get 30 days on it. You know what I mean?
[01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:46.510]  Which is kind of cool we we had we had those problems where it like you buy it when you're doing like large-scale
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:52.790]  Applications talking about thousands of acres. So you're buying 55 gallon drums or even larger those big gold
[01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.830]  plastic containers of
[01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.870]  You know a fertilizer
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.070]  Big T or whatever you're trying to get
[01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:05.110]  and
[01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:09.950]  One thing what that was a hell was if you fucking leave the damn
[01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:17.350]  Barrel in a cold warehouse like if you end up at the end of the season with extra freaking barrels
[01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:22.110]  They would start to crystallize up and it would be totally useless
[01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:29.150]  Because and the contractor could try and use like you can try to heat put like hot water and mix it dilute the shit out
[01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:35.430]  Of it, but you'll never be able to get it to work, right? And it was always just basically wasted out
[01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:43.190]  And yeah, that that's that's one real. Yeah. You you got to keep it really really happy
[01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:46.310]  The other thing we used to use was nail it
[01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:53.750]  The EPA doesn't really like to issue grants for usage of it anymore, but
[01:04:54.950 --> 01:05:00.310]  That stuff will kill bugs faster than anything. I wouldn't put it on flowering plants, but
[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:03.950]  for large-scale application or
[01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.350]  you know like and like
[01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:12.730]  large-scale application I would probably look at that if you're trying to knock down bugs, but
[01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.370]  It's a pretty nasty chemical I
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:26.720]  Just try to do as much laps as I can and I you know, if you have fungus now that works, too
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.440]  Are you using pucks? I love them. What are you doing? It's a Swiss charge
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.840]  But just which size what's this chart? I gotta get some charred going. I'm low on greens
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.720]  I gotta get some greens pumping man. I get some greens pumping
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.320]  Popping up these low quads got my Swiss charred potted up during this little talk. It's been productive, man
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.320]  I feel good feel good about what I'm doing here
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.760]  It's really mellow, you know, it's keeping me from you know, rambling on it's nice. It's good stuff
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.160]  But we like it when you ramble
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.760]  Say that it's just gonna say that
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.040]  Hey, we kind of invited you here to ramble. You like get some other week for us, please
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.800]  No, it's good man, it's definitely got that dark chocolate thing to that to that one which is really interesting it's cool
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:18.960]  I love it. Is that that colorful with a new showed on Instagram? No, no. Yeah. No, it's a different one
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.280]  Okay, that one might shake out to be that way too
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.320]  Cuz now that he said dark chocolate and I'm smelling this one like it's got a lot of the similar
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.960]  Characteristics to that purple one that's in there. Yeah, I'm gonna go with that one
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.960]  I'm gonna go with that one. I'm gonna go with that one. I'm gonna go with that one
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960]  I'm gonna go with that one. I'm gonna go with that one
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.220]  Like it's got a lot of the similar characteristics to that purple one that's hanging, you know, okay
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.080]  But yeah, it's it's an interesting thing that kind of popped out of there that I didn't really expect, you know
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.440]  Which is kind of cool, you know, it's interesting. It's always fun when that happens, you know, you're like wow, I just I
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960]  Didn't see that coming, you know
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.680]  So that's good I like that
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.120]  But it's got this real dark chocolate thing on the back end
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.280]  I can taste it right now. Like I took a rip second ago and
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.280]  Yeah, it tastes like dark chocolate knob, but right now it's really like I ate it some sort of like a Hershey kiss or something
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.720]  You know, I could dark. So you're doing something totally new from either of the two parents that you've tasted
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.600]  Yeah. Well, yeah, there's no chocolatiness. Well, I mean I wouldn't consider ice cream cake chocolatey at all
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.360]  I mean, it's got a it's got a thing to it, but I wouldn't consider that chocolate in any way and
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.240]  The candy heart self like I haven't smoked a whole ton of that
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.680]  I'm gonna smoke a bunch of it this this season with the pure stuff that we're going out
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:40.240]  But I didn't I didn't see any dark chocolate in in the ones that I had grown out already or anything
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.280]  It was like I'd say oh that's chocolate, you know
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.360]  Being that it is like really all the pure candy hearts are really more squat
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.560]  and the node spacing is pretty tight, you know together tighter together than other things and
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.960]  You know bubbles and stuff or kind of like that and those old Afghanis are like that and the chocolate hides in there
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.000]  You know, so I mean, I guess it's I guess it's it's hiding in there for sure
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.460]  But it's definitely not something that I expected and it's not something that I'd see and then the promise like that
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:16.880]  How strong it is on the aftertaste, you know is like really really kind of cool, you know
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.400]  It's really it's really I can see why he gave it to me
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.660]  You know what I mean? Because it's got a it's got a kind of a cool thing, you know with it
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:30.160]  It's like you look at it. It's not the the most super flashy thing in the world. It looks really good
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.760]  I mean, but it's not like super super flashy, but the taste that aftertaste has got something to it, man
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.360]  It really is. Yeah, I can see why he's eating them all back. Do you smoke it for a while? I like that
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.080]  I like that
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.640]  Yeah, so I'm interested
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.360]  I'm interested to taste more of those SFB ones now to see if you know
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.640]  there's any chocolate hiding in those because that the cake in this that's
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.640]  You know, that's that's interesting
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  so
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:06.160]  I've never talked about plants that I haven't smoked as much as these so every time we talk I get more and more excited about
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.840]  Well, that could be good and bad, you know, you never know you get oh, no, it's all good. It's all good
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.720]  I'm happy with it. I think I
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.920]  Think this is some fire stuff. I think people would enjoy smoking this with that chocolate stuff. That's nice
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:29.480]  There seems to be a good a good amount of variety in the in the pack, you know, like it's not
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440]  it's like consistent and
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.360]  but it's not overly so like I
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.960]  Half the time when people I look at it this way when people are buying packs of seeds when they're talking about home growing and
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.960]  Kind of bond on the level that we're doing it
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.040]  Especially for the hobbyists they're gonna pop a couple seeds probably flower them all the way out
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:56.560]  you know and then they're gonna go through their pack and the packet and they'll come back and visit here and there and and and
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.260]  Half the time these people want a little bit of variety, you know
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:07.440]  It's a lot more fun for them to get a little bit more fun and unique flavors and not every single plant be the same
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.360]  There's definitely that consistency there that that can be enjoyable
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360]  But I like a little bit of variety
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.840]  Especially if you're growing out like a whole tent in one round like I'm gonna put like 12
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840]  I'm gonna put down nine of these
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.320]  Ice cream cakes gonna and if they're all exactly the same
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.960]  You know
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.160]  Fucking now I got and you know, cuz you're just growing like, you know a couple pounds for yourself
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.700]  So it's not like I love the fact the breeder is surprised at finding something in there
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:43.140]  That's what's intriguing about this, you know, the guy that put it together is like wow, this is unique, you know
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.220]  I'm excited about that. That's cool
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.660]  Yeah, it's those surprises I think those surprises are fun man, I think that's cool
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.580]  I was going for something like this
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.220]  Didn't get that at all, but I got this it actually is kind of really neat
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.380]  You know what? I mean? It's own right? Like I didn't even consider, you know, I mean, you know on that side
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:05.740]  And that might be the only one like it
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:10.660]  Yeah, exactly it's not to say that there might be a bunch of others that are just you know the other way, you know
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.780]  so yeah, but that is cool. I
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.420]  I'm stoked. He gave me something that's
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:23.380]  That was worthy of the you know of the of the did you get to get familiar with the plant before it was harvested?
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.460]  Like this specific, you know, did you get to like know it?
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:34.140]  No, I saw it. I saw it once early on before it went into flower and then I hadn't seen it again
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:40.580]  I hadn't talked to him again about it either and then the other day I got a text that says hey
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.580]  I got a couple of buds. So
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.540]  Let's link up, you know what I mean? I said cool. I'd love I'd love to taste some I just harvested some myself, you know
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:56.540]  Yeah, that's what I got so next episode you get to you get to cocktease this by smoking some of it
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.000]  Like other than this stuff, but some of the stuff that you grew in front of us. Yes. Yes
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.080]  Yes, I'll have some of that some of my ice cream cake and are dry so that I can actually nice
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.200]  Taste that you know, it'll be pretty early in the cure then too. So we'll be able. Yeah, it's almost dry now
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.520]  So they're gonna I mean I can trim it up and put it in a jar if I really wanted to right now
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.480]  You know, I have some time so I'll do that the next day or so and
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.640]  I'll give it a couple days, but I don't mind smoking stuff early. I like smoking it, you know, if it's dry
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.240]  It's ready, you know, I hang right and I let it hang for a long while and I I'm a firm believer that the dry
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.080]  Is a lot of the cure, you know what I mean?
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.400]  Like I'm gonna put it in a jar and do that and it's gonna change but but dried it, right?
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:46.360]  It should be fucking delicious when I when I pull it off the stick, you know what I mean? I'm good with that, you know
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.840]  How often you find plants that are absolutely horrendous unless you give them a nice long time
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.880]  I've got a couple that are like yeah you if you but if you give it that that fucking that that you know
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.240]  Yeah, that's three four months. It's just like fuck
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.640]  What the hell and where did that come from? No, you're right
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.340]  Yeah
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:12.720]  There's some plants a whole lot of lots of chlorophyll, you know and other stuff and it's just like you can't you gotta get rid
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.480]  Of a lot of that you gotta let those those things break down and kind of you know
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.960]  Settle a little bit, you know, and then there's other ones that are like dude if you don't smoke me now
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:29.040]  I'm gonna I'm gonna lose everything that I have in in two months and you're gonna wish you smoked me right when I had me
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.800]  You know what? I mean? So it's like you got to be able to identify which one is which you know, and I'm always
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.120]  What you smoke them all fast? Yeah
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.280]  Like do you have anything you're enjoying to smoke today because if you don't you're probably gonna smoke the ganja that you're
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.840]  Yep
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.720]  White widow white widow like and then all the white widow hybrids
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.600]  They all you they're better when you're fresh and the same thing with like
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.640]  Some of the green a lot of the greenhouse stuff. I've noticed it's like it's always better fresh
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:15.240]  Some of the other stuff that's from Shanti Baba that separate is a little bit different
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:22.600]  What I've noticed is a lot of the greenhouse stuff separate of the the super silver haze is better when you cure it but
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:29.800]  Yeah, like strawberry haze is always better when you grow it fresh and then just
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.680]  immediately smoke it and the same thing with the great white shark and
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400]  with with any way to
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120]  process and
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:48.120]  Yeah, it's funny how that is but then there's other stuff like I was doing a haze cross that I was
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.320]  Oh, oh my gosh. What was it? It was a
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:55.480]  Shit it was a cat piss haze that I was developing
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:03.640]  It was what was that make a ways from the
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440]  Damn green and
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960]  and then
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.680]  Which was Kiwi seeds and then it was a cross with Hawaiian snow from the greenhouse and
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360]  So I took these two
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.240]  Basically, I brought back some of these seeds and like I basically crossed these two lines of different hazes
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.280]  and basically made
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  an F8
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.440]  These over the years and I just kept banging and banging and banging and it was a lot different because when you
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.280]  grew that
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.000]  The fresh bud wasn't any good at all. Like it was kind of like me
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.880]  It's just kind of but when you let it like kind of cure out
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.200]  It would have these like peach and like woody flayers just come out
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.680]  It would just be so beautiful like always like but like he was saying
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:06.720]  You you wanna fucking smoke it because you like it. It's a matter of do I need weed right now? So
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.160]  You just fucking get to smoking them as all of it
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.320]  And then when you have like a little bit of nugs left that you just leave with like cuz I what I do is I'll leave
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.360]  Nugs with my seeds so I can remember. Oh, this is the reference of what this is
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.760]  Like but then I can like try it again and say okay. I want to do this with this. Um
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.920]  But it's like it's always so much better
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.520]  With with those like those old days is it's just it just gets better and better as like especially at six months
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.360]  Six months is right around where it's perfect that after about a year it degrades two years. It goes completely down
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.360]  The Pam's when like the Pam 15
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880]  It's got all this crazy
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  like skunky funk
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:02.600]  Candies and berries and all kinds of fun stuff like right on right off the bat. It's like deliciously, you know, like bright and
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.600]  Kind of it's got some funky must in there because that's what it is
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.760]  But it's got this really nice sparkling brightness to it
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.880]  This is really delicious you get like like caught like great great cough syrup type tones and like like really cool
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.960]  Tones come out of it. But if you let it sit
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.560]  For a couple months and it's jarred up and you're letting it sit and it's curing on you know in the dark
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.800]  I have this nice little situation, you know little place where I get everything
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.280]  It's like a wine cellar type situation you cure stuff in
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.000]  But if it's in the dark and it sit there for a few months man turns into cheese, you know
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.440]  And it's like all those all those berries and stuff kind of goes away and you get this like incense and cheese
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:51.200]  And it's like a sharp like parmesan II type cheese or a bad cheddar cheese or something like that
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.720]  You know like a funky one gone wrong, you know what I mean?
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.880]  Like it's got this cheesy tone to it and you know the same thing with Pam one
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.720]  She's very berry and blueberry and skunky and funky and beautiful up front
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.320]  But you let it sit and then it becomes this really must eat
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.160]  Cool great cheese, you know what I mean?
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.960]  And people go to a shit for the cheese and sometimes you show them the cheese. Oh my god
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.960]  I love you have cheese, you know, and it's like cheese and it's like I don't like that when it gets to that cheesy point
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.400]  You know what?
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:20.960]  I mean
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:26.560]  But like people love some of that some of that cheese that comes out of there and if you're waiting you wait for it
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.480]  You get this you get this cheese, but like it's weird how it does it does change they settle in, you know
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.920]  It's a great. It's a great thing. You know, it's that's the art man
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.800]  That's that's the art. I fucking love it when they when it changes. I
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:48.240]  Like I love tasting every single point no matter what like I'll go out and like every day. I'll go grab a little salad
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.860]  Little salad and I'll get a little mix everything. I'll try it out
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:58.040]  you know like you got to do it and you got to do it every single day and you got to see it what happens and
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.840]  So as a chef like I train my palate every day for years on end
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.800]  And it's all good
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:14.120]  It's all good. I train myself every day on years on it. Like it would drop my wife knocked out one of our cameras
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.700]  Years on end like going down a line and tasting like a hundred and fifty things
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:24.600]  Cuz I ran a movie restaurant we had to taste all this shit every day. It's like make sure it all tastes good
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.580]  So I I love I can I can tell when things like change just a little tiny bit and I fucking love it
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.900]  It's like a story happening. I swear to God
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:42.420]  Some plant some some some plants really transition through like kind of like they'll go day by day
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.580]  Like they'll go like when they get a little bit of that heavier moisture content when they're through a breathing phase
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:53.900]  They'll like they'll get really kind of chlorophyll a and and anchor and then they'll start drying a little bit
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.660]  You'll get a little bit more cleanliness out of them and each time it
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:02.220]  it's changes and develops a little bit more slightly and you have that flow that comes through it and then it's like
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:08.300]  Comes clear like I have one that when you when you grab it like even the first plant when you pull it off and you
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.540]  Put it in the jar doesn't smell great. No, it doesn't even have much of an aroma at all
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:12.980]  Really?
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.340]  It's not super fucking awesome
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:19.140]  but then you leave it and let it fester for a fucking while like good cheese and it's like it's
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:24.740]  Lemony and I'm like unique and funky and like a like a like a weird lemon
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.340]  And it comes through really nicely
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:32.100]  But like it smells like crap at the start like nothing it's just not great
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:37.060]  But as that time goes by but if you've dried too hard, I think you can fuck it up pretty fast
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:42.100]  But it's a beautiful plant, but it would be it's not one of those things that you do you'd open a bag
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.060]  Glorious goodness looking thing
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:53.460]  But but it'll get you high and it tastes really nice, which is what's important to me
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.460]  It
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.580]  Kind of remind me of something. Oh, sorry. Oh
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:07.040]  No, I just said fuck the looks it's all about how it tastes. That's about it
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.160]  I was thinking about London talking about being a chef and it's kind of like, you know
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.440]  Some food you have to eat it right when it's cooked and some things are better
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.280]  Like stews and stuff like that as they sit, you know
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.680]  Kind of reminded me of that when you were talking about being a chef
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:37.880]  Like it and it's cool and people think that you'd like you lose flavor or things go away and I just think they change
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.280]  You know, they don't necessarily if you do it, right, they shouldn't go anywhere. They should just
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.520]  Change a little bit and they can be good or bad
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.360]  Favorable or not, but they you know
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.280]  Yep London, I have a question for you
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.960]  shoot
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.960]  Why is it that so many people that grow we worked in the food industry?
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.480]  I think we're
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:10.640]  Experiential people we really like we're always we're about consumption. We're about
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.080]  consumption and
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:20.840]  In all of its glory and all of its greatness right from the finer things in life to food to to wine to
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.840]  whiskey to late nights and glorious
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.760]  glorious marble tables and and weird coke nights and
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.320]  Famous people that you shouldn't run into on a regular basis and you really wish
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.600]  I have I have I have served the rock
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.200]  Potatoes and it was hell it was the worst fucking experience of my life
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.560]  No shit. No shit on the Rockies. It's probably a very fantastic person
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:55.280]  But he came to our restaurant at lunch at like two o'clock in the afternoon while we're setting up for dinner service and
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.800]  in the between periods and ordered
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:05.920]  Ten ten fucking baked potatoes for the fucking table and it's like they're like dude like it's lunch
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.240]  We don't have baked fucking potatoes. I'm like
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.880]  microwaving baked potatoes by the dozen in the fucking microwave like
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.440]  25 fucking 40 minutes and they're like well why did it take so long?
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:26.040]  In the afternoon you ordered fucking a dozen baked potatoes these and and we got we got special potatoes
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:32.440]  They were 50 count. So they were like big there every single one of them was like boom, right?
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.480]  So like you throw that in the microwave, it's gonna take a fucking while
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:46.200]  Yeah, my sous-chef like standing there all the food waiting for these fucking potatoes to come through
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:53.760]  You know and and there's the owner going. Well, I could teach you how to cook potatoes faster. I'm like, oh really?
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:59.600]  Really? Oh, yeah, you could do that. Okay. Sure. You got another microwave
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.320]  Thank you
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.880]  You look at it or something that what I used to tell people, you know, if you look at things
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:12.760]  Like like you really want to do them like you're really enjoying it and you're really focused
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.440]  Let's cook quicker
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.440]  Where to God do that when you're looking at your plants, I'm pretty sure they'll grow weird
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560]  That explains a lot for me
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.560]  Why
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.480]  Why is it though like you were talking about getting jammed on our lunch rush
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.280]  Why is it like at like 12 o'clock on the lunch rush?
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:42.980]  There's always some Karen that comes in and orders 20 fucking things and everyone's name has to be
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:50.640]  Individually ordered and everything has to be done expected to like this their fucking thing that the death that that that that
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.080]  And you're sitting here making $8 an hour and you're making about $100 of sandwiches
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:04.000]  Yeah, I mean like that that that is how I never I never really worked in those spaces
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.280]  I always tried to go like really expensive high-end restaurants that had ridiculously priced menus
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.760]  Just because I didn't want to deal with too much of that and even then you get a lot of specific
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.440]  specificity
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.560]  but
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.960]  You know people are people are shitty
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.360]  It's not like in Europe
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.280]  We can't like in Europe if you go to the menu and if you go to an Italian restaurant and sit in there and go
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.200]  Like hey, can I get my avocado toast, but the avocado on the side and did it it it it there
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.680]  Look at you and say fuck off like just tell you to leave like just go away
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.240]  I don't want you to come here like fuck you
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.800]  But in in but the thing is is in North America
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.040]  And whether you like it or not, that's how it is
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:55.640]  So you can get frustrated by it and and that you could beat yourself up all day for that because they're just horrendous human beings
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.800]  They're they're they're the the lowest low of the lower people that are rude to restaurant people
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.800]  Like they're the worst human beings in the world
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  And there's a lot of them guys
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:12.840]  No idea how many people there are that are just flat-out rude to restaurant folks and
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.360]  and
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.360]  Yeah, so
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.400]  Rest not to do that to somebody dealing with your food either
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.560]  Yeah, oh no
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.040]  Hell no
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.160]  Restaurant tours in Amsterdam don't don't put up with a damn fucking thing
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.240]  They they will tell you get the fuck out like you go in and buy some weed and then you're like sitting down and you
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.760]  want to go smoke most of the time they'll tell you to get the hell out if you're not buying anything and
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  And they were very those are very strong women
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.960]  I heard working there and I have nothing but respect for them because you know
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.400]  they're just trying to make their living and
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.120]  it's
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:59.200]  Yeah, it's a very different culture versus here where we think the customer is always right there. The customer is always wrong
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760]  but
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160]  It is what it is
[01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.330]  I've never worked in the food service
[01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:16.010]  But I do all the cooking liar
[01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:20.850]  No, you're you're full of shit. You know why because you grow food
[01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:23.490]  Yes, no
[01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:30.650]  I'm the chef at the house like my wife is the chef. I do all the cooking
[01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:31.290]  You know what? I mean?
[01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:36.650]  So I make fucking sushi from the vegetables in the garden by hand and shit, you know what I mean?
[01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:40.410]  And homemade that you know chicken noodle soup and shit like that, you know, so
[01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:44.050]  Definitely. I know how it is in the kitchen
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:49.490]  Getting the turps, but I always go to restaurants and I'm always like don't do that. Don't do that
[01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:53.050]  You're pissing off people at the restaurant. Please don't ask that way. Please don't do this
[01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:56.850]  Just stop, you know, is this your wife?
[01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:02.490]  Just be cool to anybody. It's like don't talk to the box like that. Like, you know, these people
[01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:06.370]  Really nice to people, you know, you're really nice to them. Yeah
[01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:10.130]  I like making my own food. It's good thing. I
[01:28:11.170 --> 01:28:14.290]  Started we're gonna need to in Canada really quick here
[01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:17.890]  There's gonna be such a food collapse and the restaurant industry is gonna be just yeah
[01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:24.690]  I was gonna say during that whole friggin virus situation in the world. You know what I mean? Like I
[01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:30.530]  We you know, I had to learn how to cook a lot of things that I really enjoyed that I wasn't getting
[01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:32.210]  You know what? I mean from here?
[01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:36.090]  I make some of the best friggin hot wings on planet Earth these days
[01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:41.370]  You know what? I mean some of the coolest hand I learned so many cool like hamburger techniques and stuff
[01:28:41.370 --> 01:28:44.650]  So when I come to your house, you're gonna make me hot wings. Is that what you're doing?
[01:28:44.650 --> 01:28:46.650]  I will blow your mind with some friggin hot wings
[01:28:46.650 --> 01:28:51.610]  They're straight up from Buffalo like the anchor bike the origin where they came from and I've been
[01:28:52.130 --> 01:29:00.610]  To the anchor bar in Buffalo where they supposedly were spawned or whatever and like so I've tasted like I've tasted like the bar
[01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:04.850]  You know what? I mean? And then I learned recipes and stuff. So I know how it stacks up, bro
[01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:08.210]  I can make some hot wings man. That's no doubt about that. It's one of my specialties
[01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:11.010]  Do you make the hot sauce yourself too?
[01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.170]  Sometimes sometimes I'll just cheat and use Frank's, you know
[01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.050]  Because you can put that shit on anything
[01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:21.970]  I
[01:29:21.970 --> 01:29:24.570]  Got a few have an arrow plants. I'm gonna try and do this year
[01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:29.610]  Do you have any like does anybody have any interesting plants since we're in the spring and we're all going through?
[01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:34.330]  And we're all gardeners. Anyways, is there something fun that you have that you're gonna be throwing down?
[01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:43.530]  What you got coastal talk to me so I am desperately trying to find daikon radish
[01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:47.730]  But not on amazon.com is I'm not trying to support
[01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:53.010]  Especially with our Chinese source seed so I'd rather do
[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:56.170]  someone in the US
[01:29:56.170 --> 01:30:02.130]  And then I'm gonna try to do carrots then I have oh shit load of I got right here
[01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:06.970]  And more Thanos and
[01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:10.370]  like heirloom Sam art zone is and
[01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:14.450]  different types of beans and all that so
[01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:18.050]  I'm just hoping my dog won't try to run over
[01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:21.130]  my patch my I have a
[01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:26.430]  Chocolate lab you can see her running back and forth in the videos sometime
[01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:34.650]  Basically she runs over every plant that's tall she intentionally does it so
[01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:37.250]  that's what I'm gonna be trying to run this year and
[01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:43.770]  then I'm gonna try to do some potatoes and other stuff in raised beds and and in pots, but
[01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:53.290]  That that's my hopes for the year but yeah last last time we had the silliest like harvest my wife did a corn and
[01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.050]  She had a corn nugget that was about the size of a golf ball
[01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:06.330]  It was the cutest thing I think it's on it's on if you look at mrs. Coastal ground
[01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:08.330]  G
[01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:15.530]  It's on her Instagram, it's the funniest the tiniest piece of corn that's ever existed on planet Earth, but yeah
[01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:19.690]  But yeah, that those are the plans for this next year right now
[01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:24.330]  That's cool, what about you Cory what you got
[01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:33.410]  I was gonna say about the about the daikon radishes if you I've gotten them free from PETA
[01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:36.850]  Yeah call Peter I was gonna say if you can email
[01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:47.650]  Everybody everybody let's just take to Peter Peter
[01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:54.730]  He's watching the gator. It's still on I don't even know he always puts the shows on it Peter
[01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:56.970]  Peter
[01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:58.970]  You there Peter Peter
[01:31:58.970 --> 01:32:00.970]  There
[01:32:02.730 --> 01:32:04.890]  We need daikon radish seed sent
[01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.730]  He's there he's gonna pop up in like 30 seconds
[01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:25.610]  You know, I just a couple of foolish things I ran some planted some of the
[01:32:26.490 --> 01:32:28.890]  Charm and tobacco that I got from PETA
[01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:33.050]  Not sure but thought it was kind of cool
[01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:39.130]  I've got got your radishes in my 4x4 bed
[01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:44.530]  That's kind of fun, you know running those right with my cannabis. Oh, yeah. Nice
[01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:50.250]  Check that out. I get some daikons in there. Those are some cool like it's like a weird open pollination of like
[01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:55.370]  Three or four different awesome radishes that are in there. So in the radical. Yeah
[01:32:55.610 --> 01:33:00.010]  Radical radishes. Yeah, you get some funky cool stuff in there, you know, I mean, so yeah
[01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:03.050]  There's some cool radishes in there, but they don't all look around, you know
[01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:08.330]  I got some of those in there and I've got
[01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:15.330]  I've got some Berkeley tie-dye tomatoes that I'm gonna try this year. They look kind of cool
[01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:22.530]  I don't know London had some neat looking tomato. He was showing but it looked kind of cool different figured I tried that
[01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:25.810]  Um, nothing crazy, but I've got a
[01:33:27.170 --> 01:33:29.170]  purple
[01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:33.490]  Basil that I'm trying something different but nothing
[01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:38.690]  Nothing too out of the box. I think that's the shaman tobacco is a little different for me, you know
[01:33:38.690 --> 01:33:40.690]  Yeah, you gotta be careful with that, bro
[01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:44.170]  Oh, I'm definitely not gonna ingest it. I
[01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:50.610]  Just quit smoking cigarettes like a couple years ago and have no I think it was singing
[01:33:52.530 --> 01:33:54.530]  Probably get me
[01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:56.810]  Special about this tobacco like it was it
[01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:06.410]  High high nicotine it's got crazy levels of stuff. It's like it's like hallucinating tobacco or something, man
[01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:07.330]  I don't know
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:10.910]  It's intense stuff, you know sounds like sounds like a good time to me
[01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:16.770]  Yeah
[01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:23.410]  Okay, so there's there's there's some really good applications for using tobacco in like plant ferments for your
[01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:30.050]  Preventative methods, you know, what else is really fucking awesome about tobacco and I have a bunch of tobacco plants. Yeah
[01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:37.770]  You can just a moment. So soak that crap in water and make some some insecticides man spray stuff boundaries
[01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:40.250]  Things don't like that, you know, they're really sticky
[01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:47.090]  They're like crazy sticky ass plants and like you walk by them and they they rub on this is jasmine tobacco
[01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:50.290]  It's like a hybrid kind of so it's a little bit different
[01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:57.810]  Beautiful is that how they all grow or is that just particular to that one variety that one?
[01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:04.130]  Okay, this is a little bit because I was gonna say the one I have is really larvae like it's big fatter leaves in some
[01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:08.010]  Cases, you know like more at the bottom. There you go. Yes
[01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:12.650]  Didn't have that stretch, but maybe it will I don't know that that's neat
[01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:19.050]  So it but it catches everything so any bug that lands on it fucking die
[01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:24.250]  Like done except for it can land on the flowers
[01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:30.290]  But about other than that, it's got a really sticky like you walk by it and it leaves you with with the text
[01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:33.970]  It's like it it'll grab you when you walk by it, which is kind of cool
[01:35:34.450 --> 01:35:39.970]  Like yeah, cuz it's got like it's really really soft and fuzzy and
[01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:46.930]  It's kind of cool which shout out you can actually get it's in one of the packs from cunning folk. You can get this one
[01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:50.770]  Oh, I had a bunch of them, but they're they're really cool pests
[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:55.170]  Things cuz they're like now I don't buy sticky traps because bugs
[01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:58.370]  Yeah, right like you
[01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:03.890]  I saw a good fungus net come out the other day and it was all up in here and it was pretty pretty epic
[01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:06.210]  It was neat. I've got so I've got in place throughout the yard
[01:36:06.930 --> 01:36:12.210]  And in strategic spots so I can kind of see what happens and I go check them every once in a while
[01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:16.730]  And so we'll be going if you keep them cut they keep bouncing back and and re
[01:36:17.490 --> 01:36:22.770]  Do they flower or how do they go to seed? Yeah. Yeah, they flower out. So there's these beautiful
[01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.570]  little white flowers
[01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:31.010]  Things okay. All right. I didn't even see that. Gotcha. Yep. Yep. I think I can bring
[01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:36.850]  Yeah, tobacco is one of those things. I don't I don't have tons. I don't have tons of experience growing tobacco
[01:36:36.850 --> 01:36:44.210]  I never I never had the had the it's to plant tobacco. Oh, yeah, you know lots of places and it's really cool
[01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:48.930]  So I've seen a lot of different types a lot of different looks to it, you know a lot of different types
[01:36:48.930 --> 01:36:53.070]  I kind of planted it because I've never seen it. I wanted to try it. Just don't look at it
[01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:57.550]  Okay, can you see the fuzziness on the leaf can you see
[01:37:00.190 --> 01:37:06.310]  Yeah, that's cool, that's cool I knock it over like three fucking times a day because it's
[01:37:06.710 --> 01:37:10.670]  Gene when I walk by it's like and I got it in a one fucking gallon pot
[01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:16.030]  But like they seem to really choose this what this variety does
[01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:20.190]  Seem to choose its its flower by its pot size
[01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:25.470]  So the other one seemed to be going and getting quite a bit larger
[01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:32.630]  Like I have one in a pot right over there that like in a bed and it's just keeps stacking
[01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:38.470]  And getting wider and wider, which is pretty cool. And that's kind of it's been fun
[01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:44.510]  My wife wanted to dig into some new and unique plants. And so that's been kind of an area that we've been digging into
[01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:47.390]  One that you guys might think is neat is this
[01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:51.550]  You like you like celery. Oh, yeah
[01:37:57.630 --> 01:38:04.390]  Yeah, the red I got the red celery dude the Chinese red or the Chinese pink or whatever that stuff's fire man
[01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:06.390]  That's great. Isn't it good?
[01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:13.710]  I just I just saw
[01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:19.430]  I like an envelope from Baker Creek and they had the picture of that on the back and I was like, oh
[01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:26.430]  We got to do a trade I got some I got some I can send you you get like a billion in a pack
[01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:28.670]  I got a bad. What kind of flavor is it?
[01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.670]  Lot sharper a lot sharper. Okay
[01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:35.830]  Then then your traditional
[01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:41.590]  Celery some more of a spice or something. Have you have you tried salad Barnett?
[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:45.950]  Have you tried growing salad Barnett? That's kind of a weird one. No, I have not
[01:38:59.110 --> 01:39:03.710]  Oh, it's like a thicker set like a thicker succulent type set of saladers. Yeah
[01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:10.270]  Yeah, it's like a it's interesting. Yeah, it's like a Malabar spinach or yeah, kind of
[01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:14.110]  Yeah
[01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:16.290]  It's in the Malabar spinach family
[01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:23.790]  Yeah, it's got that thicker leaf and it grows more spindly and viney and you can't eat the individual leaflets
[01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:26.590]  You know, and those are those are cool super nutritious probably
[01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:32.070]  Really good flavor to like they're not like too sharp. They got a bit of flavor, but not too much
[01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:36.830]  I've been trying to find like a knife like lettuce II light light flavored
[01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:38.830]  Yeah
[01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:47.390]  Kind of nice but easy to grow I get I get a lot of slugs and I have a ridiculous volume of isopods
[01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:54.150]  Yeah, I got so many isopods it's ridiculous but I'm okay with that
[01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:57.270]  Yeah, because that's just part of what it is
[01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:58.590]  Like I also have mushroom
[01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:04.150]  I found a mushroom in my in my little compost corner that when I cleaned out the corner of my greenhouse today
[01:40:04.150 --> 01:40:06.150]  That was like that big around
[01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:09.430]  Like I fucked it right up in the process. So I didn't
[01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:13.270]  Dig it around
[01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:17.130]  And like nice big way home like the one so I was like awesome
[01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:18.310]  I found some good
[01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:24.550]  like I put I put a layer of wood down underneath this section and then then put the compost up and was able to get
[01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:30.510]  A really good like white mold growing out throughout it. So it's like composting really nicely
[01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:32.710]  so I'm getting to like a nice under layer to my
[01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:36.030]  To my base garden there because I just put that down and
[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:40.770]  Hey, and then wood and then hey and then rotate through and it's pretty good
[01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:43.670]  I get like what I get it. I get a lot of worm droppings
[01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:49.230]  It's kind of like I can go through and pick them up and move them in certain bins if I want to but yeah
[01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:56.750]  What's I turn you up what's the ETA on being able to get some worm juice by the way
[01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:59.550]  Not
[01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:02.110]  To cut you off, but
[01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.790]  That was my
[01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:14.590]  Reposter story this week with that
[01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:22.670]  Don't you know, I just don't like going through the hassle stuff like that
[01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:27.830]  Answer much written questions and checking that box. Like I just don't want to check the box, you know what I mean?
[01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:40.030]  So I'm gonna have to check that box if I send the liquid so I gotta figure out what that means exactly
[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:42.030]  You know, so I don't really know
[01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:47.950]  But yeah, I'm gonna be setting up the farmers markets and stuff around here and I'm gonna be bringing it around with me
[01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:49.550]  I'm doing lots of cool tests with it, too
[01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:54.870]  Because I'm trying to figure out how long I can actually make it go so I could I can seal that bottle up
[01:41:54.870 --> 01:42:00.430]  I can aerate it and you know feed it a little my FAA and then I can
[01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:04.150]  Bottle it and I can stay good for a couple weeks now
[01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:09.070]  I've got bottles that don't smell funky and are beautiful and are usable and all that stuff
[01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:11.470]  so then I started putting them in my fridge and
[01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:15.790]  I'm waiting to open a couple that are a couple weeks old now
[01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:22.390]  That have been sitting in the fridge instead and under a cold and I'm gonna see what they look like and I'm gonna look
[01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:24.750]  at those under the microscope a little bit and then I'm
[01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:30.950]  fiddle around a little bit with that and figure out if I should store them in the fridge or I shouldn't and
[01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:36.350]  You know what the deal is with all that so I'm working on I'm working on all those little details
[01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:38.030]  But right now I know that the shit works
[01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:42.670]  I've just never tried to bottle it before and like share it with anybody and if I do people
[01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:48.390]  You know what I mean and I wanted to work the way that it's supposed to work so I've been working on that and
[01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:50.670]  It's working. So I'm
[01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:57.470]  Yeah, I'm getting close. I'm figuring it all out. It's exciting. I saw that I wanted I thought about it when you said, you know
[01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.830]  Yeah
[01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:59.350]  people
[01:42:59.350 --> 01:43:05.270]  I work for all kinds of different people doing orchard stuff and we do trees and all kind of stuff and the people always ask
[01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:09.990]  Me all the time like I want some of your funny little things that you use because I use all kinds of funny little
[01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.390]  Teas and brews and funny little you know
[01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:17.710]  Extracts and this thing and that thing and I put stuff together all the time and their trees kick ass
[01:43:17.710 --> 01:43:21.170]  You know what? I mean? They're like I want to buy something, you know magic potions
[01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:28.310]  This I can guarantee is gonna do what it does, you know, so what's up coastal?
[01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:35.430]  Okay, I'm just dying because it's like London you have
[01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:43.590]  I suppose in your grow tents and I don't even understand how my wife would even tolerate
[01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:50.470]  Well, actually no there's is a positive micro 10
[01:43:52.830 --> 01:44:00.770]  And then and then and then like Tyler is talking about like keeping up like the teas in the
[01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:08.250]  Refrigerator and I'm just like I'm lucky to be able to have like a closet to put a tea in and I still get full
[01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.650]  I have to stop
[01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:13.730]  And I'm just like well, I'm grateful. She lets me like make a bio
[01:44:14.530 --> 01:44:16.530]  reactor somewhere but like
[01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:21.450]  Yeah, it's just fucking hilarious. I'm just sitting here just dying Wow
[01:44:21.930 --> 01:44:27.090]  We like really have to have some tolerant women to like put up this shit. I
[01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:32.650]  Brew like 100 liter. I wrote 200 liters of tea a week
[01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:38.530]  During certain periods the time it's like hey, there's always shit brewing here
[01:44:44.610 --> 01:44:46.610]  On the windowsill in the kitchen
[01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:52.490]  Like that's like the shadier windowsill that's bright that I can put little cuttings and start like basil things
[01:44:53.490 --> 01:44:59.410]  Cuttings and put them up there cut half of my onion and leave the root chunk up there and like stuff like that
[01:44:59.410 --> 01:45:03.850]  That'll plant later, you know weird stuff like the potato that starts growing. I'll set it in the windows
[01:45:03.850 --> 01:45:09.730]  So like she hates that I always get in trouble. She's always threatening to throw out my windowsill plants, you know
[01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:13.050]  So I'm always like I'll clean it out. I promise it's out of here
[01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:16.570]  We gotta get a tour of this
[01:45:16.570 --> 01:45:18.570]  Because
[01:45:18.570 --> 01:45:24.250]  Now I'm like now I imagine you put like a piece of wood so the windowsills extended and then you have a heavier plant on
[01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:25.130]  one side
[01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:30.490]  That you have more you can fit more plants there and he scoops them all up to rescue
[01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:41.610]  Strategic move to get washed dishes
[01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:47.490]  The wrong move you're gonna kill 15 of mr. Tree's favorite basil product
[01:45:49.610 --> 01:45:52.370]  And then she does it she's like fuck you I did it on purpose
[01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:03.690]  I'm growing some some yellow mountain watermelon again. It's one of my favorite watermelons of all time
[01:46:04.450 --> 01:46:10.970]  Really friggin amazing. So if you guys like growing watermelon or you like watermelon grow the yellow ones
[01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:12.970]  You know what? I mean the ones with the yellow insides
[01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:20.130]  Whatever right you can find but I'm growing growing some mountain yellow watermelon. I'm growing some
[01:46:20.850 --> 01:46:24.970]  Like super black carrots like beyond black carrots
[01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:31.610]  They're like better for juicing for this crazy black juice as opposed to like eating
[01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:34.450]  They stain your teeth really bad because they're that
[01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:36.970]  juicy and black
[01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:41.370]  So I'm excited to see those I'm interested I forget the name of them all
[01:46:43.050 --> 01:46:45.210]  Anybody's interested or whatever I can you hit me up
[01:46:45.210 --> 01:46:47.290]  I'll send you the picture of the name or whatever
[01:46:47.290 --> 01:46:52.170]  But I'm growing those this year and I'm kind of stoked about among all my other carrots because I grow lots of carrots
[01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:57.210]  I grow all kinds of colored carrots and funky carrot. I like carrots. So I grow carrots
[01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:01.410]  I'm growing those those are cool. I'm growing some accordion
[01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:05.930]  Orange tomatoes
[01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:11.810]  Which are cool so they get really friggin big and they're like all ribbly and accordion like and they look like an accordion coming up
[01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:15.490]  You know and they get like, you know, pretty good size like you know, like you're
[01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:19.650]  Like, you know, I had a face hated one last week. That was like
[01:47:20.410 --> 01:47:23.450]  Yeah, they get all like weird looking. Yeah. Yeah
[01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:29.670]  They're like a weird one that does that and like a nice Michelin style like stack each, you know, it's kind of cool
[01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:32.650]  It's it's kind of very it's very interesting
[01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:39.990]  I'm growing lots of lot more like flower corn this year. I'm growing popping corn. I'm growing a little patch of sweet corn
[01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:46.410]  multicolored sweet corn and some different colored popping corns because I always do those I love having
[01:47:46.570 --> 01:47:49.210]  Popping corn. It's one of my favorite things to grow in the world
[01:47:50.690 --> 01:47:53.170]  Little cobs of popping corn is the best
[01:47:54.450 --> 01:48:01.570]  but I'm growing a lot more flower corn so like Mohawk red and some magic mana and some
[01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.450]  Some purple funky stuff that
[01:48:06.970 --> 01:48:12.290]  Didn't send some John a blank on a man. I'm high but some cool cat sent me some cool corns
[01:48:12.290 --> 01:48:14.290]  I've grown some of his purple ones
[01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:17.410]  Are you gonna be selling that
[01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:23.450]  So, yeah, I don't know how that's I've never really grown a big plot of just flower corn in
[01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:27.090]  Planning to grind it up for cornmeal. You know what I mean?
[01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.610]  Like I'm planning to pretty much just grind it all up or most of it up for cornmeal
[01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:33.130]  Almond seeds are you gonna be selling?
[01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:35.930]  Yeah, I have those now I can yeah
[01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:41.330]  Anybody wants corn funky corn seeds some flower corn seeds some popping corn seeds funky stuff like that
[01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:46.410]  I haven't got it. I haven't got it all dog a stocked up, you know as a recently on some of those
[01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:50.430]  Which I will but if anybody wants any of that weird stuff hit me up
[01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:55.490]  I'll send you a vegetable list of all kinds of funky stuff that I have. I want that list
[01:48:57.650 --> 01:48:59.650]  Right after the episode
[01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:02.610]  I
[01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:07.850]  Want to grind corn this year
[01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:12.090]  I'm excited about grind some some funky colored cornmeal and making some cornbread
[01:49:12.250 --> 01:49:19.090]  I will come and make you some of the most badass fucking tacos man. Yeah, make you like Michelin star

[01:49:31.090 --> 01:49:33.090]  Yeah, I'm gonna do that this year so
[01:49:33.770 --> 01:49:39.610]  Among all the other funky stuff because I got all kinds of stuff squashes and pumpkins growing lots of pumpkins
[01:49:39.610 --> 01:49:41.970]  Oh, I'm growing growing a cool pumpkin
[01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:48.010]  Huskless seed pumpkin that's the seed doesn't have a husk on it for eating the seed a little better, you know, so
[01:49:49.170 --> 01:49:53.850]  Which is like 90% of pumpkin seed or squash seeds suck. Yeah
[01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:57.210]  Yeah
[01:49:57.210 --> 01:50:03.690]  I'm planning on getting like those huskless ones so that you just eat this awesome meaty seed in the middle
[01:50:03.690 --> 01:50:08.250]  It's just full these meaty. Are they like really bred for seed? So they like got a really thin, right?
[01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:10.250]  Yeah, they're like really full. It's the okay
[01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:13.290]  Pumpkin that is grown for seed
[01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:16.490]  I don't know how much is in the actual cavity is and stuff like that
[01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:20.450]  but I'm gonna select out of there and I'm gonna play around with some of those and I'm gonna take the
[01:50:20.690 --> 01:50:25.770]  Take the seed from the ones that are the best and have the those types of characteristics, you know
[01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:28.410]  Most
[01:50:28.610 --> 01:50:30.250]  Good, you know
[01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:33.050]  Good strength good shape all those funny things
[01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:37.170]  I'll look at and I'll start taking those seeds and I'll start using those seeds for the future
[01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:39.410]  But I'm growing that for the first time. I've never grown a huskless
[01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:46.570]  You know pumpkin for pumpkin seed variety before and that's something that I'm growing. I grow lots of pumpkins
[01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:51.290]  I'm growing big giant ones little ones, but I never grown that type before so it's new for me
[01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:54.450]  This year, which is cool
[01:50:56.290 --> 01:51:00.330]  I like pumpkins me too. I do okay with squash
[01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:06.890]  But they just I have such a small space that it's always about like how many plants can I fit in the 3x3?
[01:51:07.290 --> 01:51:09.290]  square spot
[01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:13.890]  How many because I could I could fit a lot at this point depending on where they are
[01:51:14.650 --> 01:51:18.530]  But pumpkins and squash don't do really good, but I am trying to do this
[01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:21.210]  This melon this year
[01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:24.410]  Which is kind of a dolce de la tabla
[01:51:25.210 --> 01:51:32.010]  Cool table. I don't know why French and half English on a table. Why is it dolce de la table?
[01:51:32.970 --> 01:51:37.570]  Okay, I'm half French, but it's really like it's a funky old-school
[01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:41.050]  Variety
[01:51:41.530 --> 01:51:47.550]  Looks like a candle. Oh, yeah, that's cool. Yeah, I'm growing lots of weird melons this year, too
[01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:53.350]  I don't have that one. But yeah, I got I like melons too. That's cool. I have a question for you. Mr
[01:51:53.350 --> 01:52:00.190]  Trees about watermelons. Yeah. Yeah. I remember being a kid eating watermelon had seeds in it
[01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:03.350]  delicious tons of flavor
[01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:08.350]  Now I get these small watermelons with no seeds and they taste like nothing
[01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:12.350]  Yeah, is that because they bred them for seedless and not flavor?
[01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:16.790]  Is it because they're growing them different and they're lousy like what are we dealing with?
[01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:21.950]  So it's a combination of both of those things, you know, mostly when you took the seed away
[01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:27.790]  That's the most important thing was it to be a seedless watermelon? That's edible. You don't care about how it tastes
[01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:39.870]  That's it because it's like it's a seedless watermelon so how are you gonna propagate it so that plant in itself?
[01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:44.150]  You know what? I mean? However, they're you know, however, they're getting that puppy to do its thing
[01:52:45.150 --> 01:52:49.270]  So it's like you know, you've got it locked down that's how you're gonna do it, you know, I mean so
[01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:54.430]  that's got something to do with it and then yeah, they have to pick them a little earlier because
[01:52:55.230 --> 01:52:57.230]  You pick something really ripe and you know
[01:52:57.510 --> 01:53:00.830]  Sometimes you can flick a watermelon and sometimes you know
[01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:04.990]  You can get those things to pop open you get it a little bit dang below of it and you can like flick it
[01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:08.270]  You know crack open, you know, I mean really easy when they're really ripe
[01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:11.930]  There's like all these cool videos. You can actually check out like
[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:14.650]  Just google it and like like
[01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:18.130]  Like
[01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:23.610]  Nailing a watermelon open to like take a nail and they'll just like hammer a little nail or they'll take a knife and just put
[01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:27.170]  One little dot and they'll just hit it and the whole watermelon will crack perfectly in half
[01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:29.450]  You know what? I mean when it's perfectly ripe, so
[01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:36.050]  They pick them a little earlier. So it's harder for you know, so you're not getting that that really rich
[01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:41.690]  killer meat, you know what I mean and they're doing them on a bigger scale than they were back in the day because
[01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:45.010]  You know, there were there were less less of us around and stuff, you know, so
[01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:50.170]  Mostly that seedless thing soon as you start taking the seeds out of things
[01:53:50.170 --> 01:53:55.490]  I always the thorns the thorns away from stuff like there's a thornless Mexican lime, you know and
[01:53:56.530 --> 01:54:02.450]  Like the real Mexican lime the key lime has all these nasty thorns. It'll tear up your arm. It's like horrible
[01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:06.370]  It's like a really tough nasty plant. So they were like, okay, let's take the thorns away
[01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:08.810]  So they made they made one that didn't have the thorns
[01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:13.690]  But then sometimes that one doesn't produce as well as the original one, you know
[01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:18.730]  It's a little shyer to get barren and sometimes in certain situations. It doesn't bear at all
[01:54:19.530 --> 01:54:23.330]  Then there are other other ones that do okay, but it like has this
[01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:26.090]  more emotional less less
[01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:30.370]  Frequent bearing characteristic that you kind of lost some of the magic
[01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:37.650]  Compared to you know, the old thornbrite. It's the old thornbrite. It would have freaking lines on it all the time 24 7
[01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:43.970]  You know seven days a week some were ripe some weren't ripe some were dropping off and like you lost that when you lost the thorns
[01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:45.970]  So soon as you start taking those things away
[01:54:46.330 --> 01:54:51.170]  Yeah, you're losing you're losing something, you know else with it genes are locked together, you know
[01:54:51.330 --> 01:54:57.330]  But yeah, those seedless watermelons. Those are crap. Dude. Don't buy those man. That's about all we see ever
[01:54:57.330 --> 01:55:03.970]  Yeah, we got it. You got a grow some you just get any pack manny any you can buy the grow the little ones
[01:55:03.970 --> 01:55:05.970]  You know just
[01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:11.250]  With seeds in it man, those are the bomb dude. Yeah, and they're the most nutritious
[01:55:11.250 --> 01:55:13.970]  You're supposed to eat some of those seeds, you know, I'm chewing up
[01:55:14.490 --> 01:55:16.490]  You know, definitely. Yeah
[01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:23.570]  It's like grapes another thing like the seedless great same exact thing. Yes
[01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:25.570]  You know
[01:55:28.050 --> 01:55:31.690]  You think about wine and they say why is wine good for you?
[01:55:31.690 --> 01:55:35.770]  you know what I mean this red wine is good for you because those grapes actually were have seeds and
[01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:41.570]  Those wine grapes have seeds in them and they're crushing those grapes and they're getting those I forget what the chemicals are
[01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:47.770]  There's these certain chemicals that are really good for heart health and anti-cancer and all kinds of other things that are contained in the grape
[01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:55.010]  And so like, you know that red wine is is really magical more so because the seeds in there
[01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.450]  You know what?
[01:55:55.450 --> 01:56:00.370]  I mean that were crushed and all that stuff and those enzymes and stuff from that in addition to you know
[01:56:00.370 --> 01:56:04.890]  Those other arid aspects so like the ones that don't have the seeds are actually a little less nutritious
[01:56:05.210 --> 01:56:12.290]  Than what they could be instead of you chewing up that seed and swallowing that seed and getting those those extra properties, you know
[01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:15.690]  So taking shit away has its consequences. That's for sure
[01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:17.690]  So
[01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:21.250]  Go for a coastal jump in there man
[01:56:22.930 --> 01:56:24.930]  Agreed 100%
[01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:27.370]  Um
[01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:30.410]  Actually, I've seen with the inbreeding with cannabis
[01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:37.250]  That like it really becomes a huge fucking problem and I've also seen it with animals and everything else
[01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:42.230]  So I'll go from cannabis and then I'll bring it back down to the other stuff if I can remember to
[01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:45.530]  basically
[01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:50.930]  With cannabis it really becomes a huge fucking problem and
[01:56:52.690 --> 01:57:00.210]  You you just you can't try to pull at one thing and not expect it to push at the other
[01:57:01.330 --> 01:57:05.210]  and it's the same thing with the inbreeding with
[01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:07.850]  All
[01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:09.610]  animals and
[01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:12.730]  Vegetables like if you want good tomatoes
[01:57:12.730 --> 01:57:17.490]  You want to get heirloom tomatoes if you want to get like good pork?
[01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:23.010]  You're going to have to get heirloom pork and typically it's going to have to be like a dark pig
[01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:29.930]  like all the lighter pigs the white pigs and the brown pigs are basically bred for
[01:57:32.090 --> 01:57:34.090]  Production
[01:57:34.330 --> 01:57:35.290]  And
[01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:40.330]  That's why they don't taste as as good and it's the same thing with with the chickens, too
[01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:45.970]  and so if you go to the grocery store and you're buying like a whole chicken and then you
[01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:49.050]  happen to see these little black tips at the end of the
[01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:52.050]  of the wings
[01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:58.770]  It's probably a good assumption that that chicken is probably better than some of the other ones there
[01:57:59.610 --> 01:58:06.770]  It because like like Wegmans for example will do large-scale production, but they'll use both the
[01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:13.570]  Black and white chickens so you could get a it's a mishmash of what you can get
[01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:21.370]  So you got a guy kind of sucks through it like I got I'm always just looking looking looking through whatever I'm getting
[01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:24.370]  to get the best one, but
[01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:27.450]  It's been this thing in the industry, um
[01:58:28.130 --> 01:58:33.810]  All the agricultural industry over the last hundred years is to take
[01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:42.890]  What was good and then say no, that's not good enough because it's not producing enough and then saying
[01:58:43.450 --> 01:58:46.850]  We're going to try to push it like it
[01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:49.410]  reminds of
[01:58:49.410 --> 01:58:51.410]  Go ahead. It's follow the money
[01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:53.450]  It's follow the money
[01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:57.810]  Yes, at the end of the day right bottom line follow the money
[01:58:59.210 --> 01:59:02.730]  Yep, and and that's why you saw big bud in the
[01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:07.170]  1990s become like such a huge thing and it was like the shittiest weed ever
[01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:13.170]  I mean it was just covered in fucking leaves and stuff and like yeah, it created large buds
[01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:16.210]  But I mean chem deep freaking makes large buds, too
[01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:22.610]  And I mean speaking all that that stuff doesn't even taste good when you smoke it I mean I I I
[01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:29.530]  Really feel bad for anyone who smokes chem D because it tastes so fucking bad. I mean, it's good for breeding but
[01:59:30.650 --> 01:59:32.810]  For all those big bud
[01:59:34.650 --> 01:59:37.650]  Plants they just they're terrible I and
[01:59:38.930 --> 01:59:40.930]  Like, you know, they have their place
[01:59:41.250 --> 01:59:43.730]  There is a place and people need to make a living
[01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:51.730]  But I don't really care for it for my personal self and so that's where I stand on it
[01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:55.330]  Mm-hmm. I
[01:59:56.370 --> 02:00:02.690]  Agree with you. I think they it's it's it's in all industries that you know
[02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:08.650]  If if you get greedy things lack quality, I guess that's what it boils down to
[02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:15.450]  Yeah, I'll say this I don't think people set out to go I'm gonna make a shittier food, you know
[02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:23.050]  Anybody's plan no, but I think when they say I'm gonna make more money it becomes shitty already in place, right?
[02:00:23.050 --> 02:00:24.570]  and
[02:00:24.570 --> 02:00:27.130]  But there's also people that have the opposite priority, right?
[02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:32.730]  Like I I mean like I I hear what you're saying coastal growing about a variety of colored of chicken
[02:00:32.730 --> 02:00:35.610]  But it's also a breed of color of chicken. Like I've like
[02:00:35.730 --> 02:00:41.130]  Sourced chicken breeds like from all over the world to find like, you know from Asian
[02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:47.930]  black-skinned ones to that very high-end ones with the weird feet and all sorts of weird shit like that and and
[02:00:48.490 --> 02:00:50.490]  the color of the color of the
[02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:53.290]  I don't think has too much to do with it
[02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:57.530]  but the breed of the chicken and the uniqueness that it is is what's critical and
[02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:02.650]  Critical important and that's the thing is that we have read they've read for mass production
[02:01:02.650 --> 02:01:09.290]  On the conveyor and puts through the most chickens quickly as possible and they're easiest to sex
[02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:14.570]  And I can get the production down by 10% by having chickens that show
[02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:21.210]  High higher developed sexual organs so that they're easier to sex by my sectors because I think that's still done by hand
[02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:26.490]  In most facilities. I'm not aware of anybody sorting if they're being a machine that sorts them
[02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:30.650]  Fucking they have lasers that shoot bugs off of plants nowadays. So who fucking knows
[02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:39.530]  Yeah, that's exactly my point that's exactly my point is is like these heritage breeds are being wiped out
[02:01:39.930 --> 02:01:41.930]  Because they want to do these like
[02:01:42.490 --> 02:01:48.490]  Really really like vanilla plant or not plant vanilla
[02:01:49.210 --> 02:01:52.810]  Like chicken or like chicken with a lot of fat
[02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:58.570]  Or not plant vanilla, uh, like chickens, it's the same thing with the cows
[02:01:59.050 --> 02:02:04.730]  uh, because like angus beef it like angus beef and then um, like the uh,
[02:02:05.690 --> 02:02:07.530]  the wagyu beef
[02:02:07.530 --> 02:02:12.810]  That usually has more flavor. I honestly believe angus has the most flavor out of all of them
[02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:14.890]  and then uh,
[02:02:14.890 --> 02:02:21.210]  Yeah, you see it with the black pigs from spain and portugal and uh in italy. It's got a funny story
[02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:24.010]  The black the black angus
[02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:30.570]  So angus cattle is actually like it's a european breed of cattle. That's traditionally red
[02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:34.010]  And it actually doesn't have black on it
[02:02:34.090 --> 02:02:39.770]  And the funniest fucking thing about the north american certification for black angus is when they when they brought over angus
[02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:42.490]  beef from europe into
[02:02:42.730 --> 02:02:48.010]  North america they bred they crossbred it with some of the traditional cattle that gave it a black color
[02:02:48.490 --> 02:02:51.770]  And now the certification for black angus beef is you have to have
[02:02:52.570 --> 02:02:55.850]  Like something like 90 percent of the cattle needs to be black
[02:02:57.210 --> 02:02:59.210]  well
[02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:01.610]  Traditionally angus beef cattle is red
[02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:06.650]  So that sounds like a bullshit certification to me
[02:03:07.610 --> 02:03:09.610]  You know what? I mean? Like it's just
[02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:16.730]  What is that the carcass or the or the the number of animals per uh acre
[02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:18.970]  What
[02:03:18.970 --> 02:03:20.970]  What I didn't say anything about that
[02:03:21.610 --> 02:03:23.690]  Oh that it has to be 90 percent
[02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:30.330]  90 no the color of the cow the color of the cow needs to be a certain percentage black for it to be considered
[02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:32.410]  angus beef in north america
[02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:38.490]  Whereas the traditional color of the skin of the cow is actually red had no red whatsoever
[02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:42.250]  So it's just when they took it and crossed into north american breeds
[02:03:42.250 --> 02:03:45.850]  We created a misconception and then the black angus came out and then
[02:03:46.570 --> 02:03:50.890]  It took off across the world. You could you could google that i'm pretty sure
[02:03:51.850 --> 02:03:53.850]  You can go ahead and try
[02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:56.170]  I'm solid on that one
[02:03:56.170 --> 02:04:01.050]  Um, but it's weird like wagus in interesting cattle and beef altogether
[02:04:01.450 --> 02:04:05.130]  Like it's and it's actually like depending on who you are. I think it's kind of gross
[02:04:06.090 --> 02:04:11.130]  There's just so much fat that there's more fat than there is meat depending on the grade
[02:04:11.210 --> 02:04:13.210]  Like if you have a5
[02:04:13.210 --> 02:04:20.810]  um, it's it's it's it's interesting it's like I used to watch people they come in and they buy a 12 or 13 ounce
[02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:22.890]  steak and vomit
[02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:29.690]  Because it's so rich and it's something just crazy and they eat like a 14 ounce. It's like a 14 ounce pad of fat
[02:04:29.850 --> 02:04:35.770]  It's like eating a pound of butter, you know, like yeah, and then and then all these and then they just they get meat sweats
[02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:38.110]  They just start fucking sweating violently
[02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:46.430]  And then it's just like oh it was great this this one guy used to come in 82 fucking 50 ounce aged rib eyes
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:53.790]  It's like that's like meat equal to the size of my head and like by the end of it he was just like
[02:04:56.590 --> 02:05:02.110]  We didn't give him any of it for free it was like a 600 fucking dinner just in the steak
[02:05:02.670 --> 02:05:04.670]  It's weird it's craziness
[02:05:04.670 --> 02:05:09.390]  It's what people do for meat and what people do for what we do for these plants is just ridiculous
[02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:11.390]  What I want to do is find out what's around me
[02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:15.870]  And what's like relatively good and how I how I can use that to make it better like
[02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:22.430]  It's it's we have the ability to also have a lot of plants that we can pull in from around us as well that are like
[02:05:23.150 --> 02:05:25.150]  From california from people like mr
[02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:27.710]  trees that are breeding and stuff like that that that we can
[02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:33.390]  That weren't accessible before like if you look at the traditional tomato which came from south america
[02:05:33.790 --> 02:05:37.230]  When we first like we brought it over from south america
[02:05:38.110 --> 02:05:45.550]  Colonized it it was just like a shitty little fucking tiny like not really great thing and they bred it and cry and change it
[02:05:46.110 --> 02:05:50.990]  Developed all these amazing heirloom varieties over generations in time that we have now
[02:05:51.550 --> 02:05:53.550]  And now there's like these big beautiful
[02:05:53.550 --> 02:05:57.950]  And you can just buy that at the grocery store, it's like you get these seeds pretty easily like that's not too
[02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:04.750]  Challenging to get really cool good heirloom quality seeds nowadays. I don't I don't think anyways
[02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:08.590]  So I think it's like it's an interesting cult. It's an interesting
[02:06:09.230 --> 02:06:13.470]  Area, it's great for the hobbyist. It's not great for the person that shops at walmart
[02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:17.950]  And the unfortunate thing is a person that shops at walmart, you know
[02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:20.270]  probably
[02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:26.030]  Is trying to work so hard that they can't really take the time to grab into the garden and plant something to
[02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:28.570]  subsidize a little bit of their costs
[02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:30.910]  Because that's what it is is you're printing money
[02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:37.710]  It's you're just going into your backyard. You're putting something down and it's taking what what's there around you and you're you're you have to eat
[02:06:39.310 --> 02:06:43.390]  Might as well grow something right even if it's just a pot or something like that, right?
[02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:46.590]  Dude, I was working in the yard today when I got home from work
[02:06:46.670 --> 02:06:50.990]  And I didn't eat anything because I was running behind all day like I started off behind
[02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:55.550]  I was behind it was like two hours behind. I was trying to play catch up all day, you know
[02:06:56.110 --> 02:06:59.630]  And I was even behind here, but I was only a couple minutes behind and made my way back
[02:06:59.630 --> 02:07:04.190]  You know what? I mean? I got back got back on track, but that's besides the point, but I was behind all day
[02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:08.030]  All day and I was out there working when I got home. I went out
[02:07:08.670 --> 02:07:11.870]  On the farm and I was doing work and I had to put up a couple of fences
[02:07:12.190 --> 02:07:15.150]  And then protect a couple of beds that I had from the dogs and from
[02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:18.350]  The squirrels and all kinds of stuff that'll run through them, you know right now
[02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:22.110]  I just got them set up so I was putting up some fences and working on the little pond area
[02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:27.390]  And then I was like man, I am starving and i'm like looking around and i'm like, okay
[02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:31.310]  I got a moringa over there. So I walked over the moringa started eating moringa tree leaves
[02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:35.470]  You know what? I mean start eating some of those leaves and walked over there. I got some tangerine a tangerine
[02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:38.750]  Got some more of that and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna go over there
[02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:40.990]  I got some tangerine a tangerine
[02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:43.790]  Got some mulberries got some mulberries in me, you know
[02:07:45.070 --> 02:07:46.190]  It's gonna rock
[02:07:46.190 --> 02:07:50.270]  Then I walked over and I got some purslane because I just potted up all these nice little purslane plants
[02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:52.670]  I was eating some of those grains for a minute then I dug up a carrot
[02:07:53.070 --> 02:07:57.550]  And I and I ate a carrot and i'm like I brushed there is nothing better than that smell
[02:07:57.550 --> 02:08:00.830]  I went back to work, you know, I mean completely fed myself like
[02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:03.470]  Right there just walking around in the back
[02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:08.030]  You know didn't have to go anywhere and was like rocking and rolling, you know
[02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:11.710]  I mean great granted it wasn't a big old nice steak or some chicken wings or something
[02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:18.670]  But yeah, he wouldn't have wanted to move after that. It was nobody. Nobody ate nothing. Nobody ate meat every fucking meal
[02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:20.910]  That's what I mean
[02:08:22.190 --> 02:08:24.190]  I was like back to work, you know, so
[02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:26.270]  Kept me on time
[02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:29.950]  You know i'm saving everything and I love eating things when they're screaming at you
[02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:31.790]  you know, I always say that like
[02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:34.990]  You take you pick somewhere you pulled that carrot right up out of the ground, you know
[02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:39.950]  You clean it off and then you take a bite and it's like you listen really close and fucking things scream. It's like
[02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:43.310]  You know because it's alive still, you know, it's like still
[02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:47.630]  Alive and like, you know that tangerine just came off the tree, you know
[02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:51.390]  I mean, it was just being pumped full of living good stuff. You know what I mean?
[02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:56.270]  It's hanging out and alive, you know, or you know that leaf was alive, you know, I mean when I ate it
[02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:58.770]  You know what? I mean it totally directly transferred
[02:08:59.310 --> 02:09:01.310]  What it had you know what I mean?
[02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:03.310]  It was wiggling in my mouth
[02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:11.150]  Not that it's pretty cool I think about that all the time he's screaming at me you hear that he's screaming, you know, it's great
[02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:17.790]  There's nothing better than that smell when you pull a carrot out of the soil, you know
[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:20.510]  like he just like
[02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:24.190]  And it's just that really carrot carrot carrot carrot smell
[02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:25.870]  Yeah
[02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:29.470]  I love that. I worked with a guy for a long time that only ate things
[02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:32.110]  That were given to him
[02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.630]  um
[02:09:33.630 --> 02:09:38.350]  Ready to eat like from mother earth, right? So like if he had to do something to it
[02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:40.830]  Or he had to kill it
[02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:42.830]  He wouldn't eat it. So like a carrot for example
[02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:46.750]  You have to kill a carrot in order to like, you know, eat it unless you're gonna replant it, right?
[02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:52.510]  There's like technicalities but like technically you're pulling it out and you're killing that carrot and you're gonna eat that root and that plant's gonna die
[02:09:52.670 --> 02:09:55.630]  Right, so that's not food right to him, right?
[02:09:55.710 --> 02:09:59.150]  That's what he said and we always used to have arguments about stuff where a chicken he's like
[02:09:59.150 --> 02:10:03.550]  You can't just take a chicken and put it on a plate, you know, he's this really rasta dude
[02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:07.950]  Like, you know really cool dude one of the smartest people I ever knew but we always we always talked about that
[02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:11.790]  And every time I eat something and i'm and i'm eating more off the plants and the trees, you know
[02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:16.270]  The way that like they're giving them to you like a fruit to pull it off the tree. You don't have to kill it
[02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:18.670]  The tree's gonna live another day
[02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:22.350]  It's giving you something that's ready to eat and it's already ready to go package
[02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:27.230]  You know what? I mean? Like that's what he considered food, you know actual food, you know and stuff like that
[02:10:27.230 --> 02:10:30.190]  So he didn't have to do anything to it and he didn't have to kill it
[02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:34.670]  That was that was his actual food, you know, that was what he was supposed to be eating and he was
[02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:38.770]  He was an older guy, but he was a wild thinker man, but some of those principles
[02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:43.550]  You know what? I mean? I think about sometimes you know what I mean when i'm eating stuff or i'm doing things
[02:10:43.630 --> 02:10:46.350]  You know what? I mean? And there's something, you know, there's some weird stuff to that, you know
[02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:51.710]  But there ain't no way in hell that i'd give up carrots or I'd give up chicken wings or any other shit
[02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:56.590]  You know what I mean? So I mean you got to take that with a grain of salt, but we used to argue all the time
[02:10:56.990 --> 02:11:01.310]  About you know, what was really food, you know, and you could go down the rabbit hole with you, you know, so
[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:04.110]  That's hilarious. I could imagine this
[02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:08.270]  Is broccoli food
[02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:10.910]  Uh, no, you have to kill it I think right
[02:11:12.110 --> 02:11:15.230]  It depends on the breed of broccoli, right? You could just keep that
[02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:19.390]  So yeah, we would go down this rabbit hole we'd be at the nursery and we'd be talking about this
[02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:23.710]  It's like well, is this really food, you know, and we'd have these exact conversations, you know
[02:11:23.710 --> 02:11:28.190]  And it was funny because I was always on the other side like well, you could always try it
[02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:30.430]  You're just trying to figure out how to get him to eat a carrot
[02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:34.830]  Guess what bro? I got this carrot in the fridge for three weeks
[02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:41.470]  I never I needed the whole other carrot to replant just so you could eat it and guess right
[02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:48.910]  It's just mind-blowing, you know, like how like it can be thought of you know in weird ways, you know, and it's kind of interesting
[02:11:49.150 --> 02:11:50.670]  About
[02:11:50.670 --> 02:11:54.670]  Plants are cool. It's like the moral of the story, you know, they can do a lot
[02:11:56.030 --> 02:12:02.590]  I love that. Yeah, I never eat my food food that only shows weakness to your dog
[02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:10.770]  Totally I don't want this rabbit food, you know, you're like get this salad out of here
[02:12:10.770 --> 02:12:14.930]  I've been sneaking greens into my wife's diet slowly for years
[02:12:16.130 --> 02:12:22.450]  She's like when I first met her she's only eating steak and potato. I'm just like well slowly it'll make things happen
[02:12:22.450 --> 02:12:24.450]  First it was asparagus
[02:12:24.450 --> 02:12:26.450]  It was a long three months
[02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:29.730]  but regardless
[02:12:30.850 --> 02:12:36.370]  And we're at like two hours and 15 minutes and before my conversation degrades any further because
[02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:40.130]  What do you guys what do you guys say what do you what do you want to talk about we got it
[02:12:40.210 --> 02:12:42.690]  I think next in the next little bit we're gonna have
[02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:45.570]  Hopefully, are you gonna be flowering soon? Cory?
[02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:48.530]  I am going to
[02:12:48.850 --> 02:12:52.370]  Up pot and try to save that one and get some clones
[02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:56.050]  Excellent. Are you good? What about you coastal?
[02:12:57.170 --> 02:12:59.650]  I am holding out and I'm
[02:13:00.370 --> 02:13:03.410]  And then I'm going to veg them out a little bit more
[02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:07.330]  I'm gonna probably defoliate to 30 to 50 percent of the lower
[02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:09.570]  stock
[02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:14.050]  and then run them under a thousand watt hps, but
[02:13:15.090 --> 02:13:20.370]  I'm just gonna keep pushing them. They're not gonna be able to stay in this tent any longer. So they're going out
[02:13:21.250 --> 02:13:23.970]  I'm gonna keep pushing them. I'm gonna keep pushing them
[02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:28.530]  I'm just gonna keep pushing them. They're not gonna be able to stay in this tent any longer
[02:13:28.530 --> 02:13:32.610]  so they're going out of here pretty soon like in the next day or two, but
[02:13:33.250 --> 02:13:36.690]  uh, i've been holding out on on taking clones and then um
[02:13:37.730 --> 02:13:42.850]  Tyler if you uh want to reach out to me about clones, I will give you
[02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:47.250]  um copies of your your girls because these belong to you
[02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:50.050]  and uh, so
[02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:53.330]  Just let me know whatever you need and uh, yeah
[02:13:54.850 --> 02:14:00.130]  Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean if you see something you want, you know, yeah
[02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:06.130]  You know, there's there's there's a lot of plants there's a lot of clones, you know out there but if there's ever a weird
[02:14:06.850 --> 02:14:12.290]  Super elite like you'll know you'll know you found superman. You know what I mean? If you find superman
[02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:15.170]  You know, you can call me i'm down with that. I'll
[02:14:17.890 --> 02:14:23.170]  I won't be able to get any together by it by and be able to enter it into the unicorn tub
[02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:28.850]  But I bet you I could get some flour out by the unicorn cup and get it in front of like
[02:14:29.650 --> 02:14:35.010]  Everybody that's cool would be there and just be like hey, this is the awesome flower. I grew of mr. Trees
[02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:41.490]  The ice cream cake is badass. It should be exciting. Give me some dope people there. I'm excited to go to
[02:14:42.290 --> 02:14:46.930]  Cannabis competition here in canada. It's gonna be sick. Yeah, dude. Yeah, that's cool. So
[02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:51.670]  I love that anybody ever enters the competition if anybody ever enters the competition
[02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:53.830]  And uses my shit
[02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:59.990]  And does any does does well with it, you know places in any category puts it puts it puts a win on the board in any

[02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:11.350]  You know free gear free seeds and free stuff is a thank you, you know, so that's cool enter competition
[02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:13.910]  He'll hug you like in real life
[02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:20.310]  I've won competitions but like
[02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:25.990]  To have my stuff win competitions for somebody else growing it and doing their thing in their own little world
[02:15:26.150 --> 02:15:30.550]  That's like a whole that is like that's the that's the holy grail you want people to be able to do that
[02:15:30.630 --> 02:15:32.630]  You know what? I mean and have that
[02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:37.910]  So do that man people enter competitions, man. That's cool stuff. Now that you say that
[02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:45.350]  I I won't be able to enter it for this one, but I will enter it if if we find the right now
[02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:47.430]  You heard me say it. So now for the next one
[02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:53.670]  It's gotta be it's gotta be it's gotta be better than anything else I have I know i'll be honest mr
[02:15:53.670 --> 02:16:00.070]  Trees, but i'll run it three times, but I'll promise you this i'll run every one of the plants three times this woman
[02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:02.310]  and and if if
[02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:04.310]  And and let you know each time how they do
[02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:11.590]  Yeah, well, I better know cut anything. Yeah. Yeah, you don't have to run anything three times unless you want to or you think?
[02:16:11.590 --> 02:16:16.310]  You did a bad job. I like to I like to try and give it a three times because I fuck up half the time
[02:16:16.630 --> 02:16:18.630]  No, i'm being sarcastic
[02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:20.550]  uh
[02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:26.550]  So I grew the dog walker right when I was I took the grow off competition and I we got this unknown cut and was the dog
[02:16:26.630 --> 02:16:33.190]  Walker and nobody knew what the fuck it was and I grew it like three different ways in three different places to maximize to see
[02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:39.270]  What what my innery was going to be like I'd have three different chances at winning the thing if I split it up, you know
[02:16:39.590 --> 02:16:41.190]  And I grew it
[02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:44.710]  The first way that I grew it I got none of what is great about the plant
[02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:47.270]  I got some weird piece of shit that I never would have
[02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:49.830]  You know considered any good, you know what I mean?
[02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:53.590]  And if it wasn't for the other plants that I had growing
[02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:56.230]  I would have never known what that plant did
[02:16:56.310 --> 02:17:00.470]  You know what? I mean if I would have just killed it after that first time I would have never known
[02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:04.550]  You know what? I mean that it actually had had something that I still have today
[02:17:04.630 --> 02:17:07.990]  You know what? I mean? Like I would never lose that thing. It's like it's unlosable, you know
[02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:11.030]  It's like one of those plants that I would not lose, you know, so
[02:17:11.670 --> 02:17:16.150]  Yeah growing it a second time sometimes is wise, you know, but you usually know
[02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:19.750]  Is that the competition?
[02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:25.270]  But sorry, go ahead cory I was gonna say is that the competition that you dried in the hotel room
[02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:31.110]  Yeah, that's the same plant. Yeah, that's a great story. Yeah. Yeah, I ended up trying no cure
[02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:35.030]  Fucking dried it not in my truck and in a hotel
[02:17:35.590 --> 02:17:39.510]  In a hotel room closet in between when my my wife and kids were there
[02:17:39.510 --> 02:17:42.070]  So when they were coming back i'd have to box it all up
[02:17:42.390 --> 02:17:47.430]  And tupperwares and take it to my truck and open it up and put it in my truck and seal up the truck
[02:17:47.510 --> 02:17:49.430]  And then when nobody was there
[02:17:49.430 --> 02:17:53.750]  I would take it back out and put it in the hotel room and open it all up and put it all in the closets
[02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:56.230]  And all that stuff and do it and I did that for the entire
[02:17:56.710 --> 02:18:01.830]  Drying process of that plant and I ended up fucking winning third and terps fucking the socal
[02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:05.750]  And the girl which is off the hook, you know, I was like, oh, yeah
